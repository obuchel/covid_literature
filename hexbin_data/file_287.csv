596,596,596,Long-term respiratory follow-up of H1N1 infection,14.572887,7.8653846,2011-06-25,"BACKGROUND: The first case of 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus infection was documented in our Hospital on 10th August 2009. METDODS AND FINDINGS: Real-time reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) testing was used to confirm the diagnosis. All patients were treated with oseltamivir from the first day of hospitalization. Upon admission 12/44 had local patchy shadowing in their chest x-ray and additionally antibiotic regimen was added to these patients as pneumonia was suspected based on clinical evidence. In total 44 patients were hospitalized 15/44 had asthma, 6/44 COPD, 5/44 leukemia. Lung function was evaluated with forced vital capacity, forced expiratory volume in 1 sec and diffused carbon monoxide upon discharge and every 3 months, until 6 months of observation was completed after discharge. The purpose of this retrospective cohort study was to evaluate whether influenza A (H1N1) had an impact on the respiratory capacity of the infected patients. CONCLUSIONS: An improvement of pulmonary function tests was observed between the first two measurements, implicating an inflammatory pathogenesis of influenza A (H1N1) to the respiratory tract. This inflammation was not associated with the severity or clinical outcome of the patients. All patients had a mild clinical course and their respiratory capacity was stable between the second and third measurement, suggesting that the duration of respiratory inflammation was two months. Early treatment with antiviral agents and vaccination represent the mainstay of management.","Zarogoulidis, Paul; Kouliatsis, George; Papanas, Nikolaos; Spyratos, Dionysis; Constantinidis, Theodoros C; Kouroumichakis, Ioannis; Steiropoulos, Paschalis; Mabroudi, Maria; Matthaios, Dimitris; Kerenidi, Theodora; Courcoutsakis, Nikolaos; Zarogoulidis, Konstantinos; Maltezos, Efstratios",Virol J,287,1
1312,1312,1312,DC-SIGN gene promoter variants and IVIG treatment response in Kawasaki disease,14.912897,8.490029,2013-09-05,"BACKGROUND: Genetic variants in the inhibiting FcγRIIB mediate anti-inflammatory responses and influence IVIG refractoriness (IVIG-R). However, these variants are rare in Asian and Hispanic populations so other genes in the pathway could be potentially involved. IVIG is ineffective in mice lacking SIGN-R1, a related molecule to human DC-SIGN. Further, DC-SIGN is a known receptor for sialylated Fc, the component responsible for the anti-inflammatory action of IVIG. Thus, we hypothesized that DC-SIGN would also be involved in the pathway of IVIG response in Kawasaki Disease (KD) patients. FINDINGS: A case-control approach was performed to examine the differential distribution of five single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in DC-SIGN promoter with IVIG-R among White (158 vs. 62), Asian (64 vs. 12) and Hispanic (55 vs. 20) KD patients. Distinct differences in allele frequency distributions of several variants in the DC-SIGN promoter were observed in the three ethnic groups. Further, Asians with the major allele “A” in rs2287886 were more likely (OR = 1.76, p = 0.04) to be IVIG non-responder, but this allele is a minor allele in other two ethnic groups, where the association was not apparent. CONCLUSIONS: DC-SIGN can potentially complement the role of FcγRIIB in the anti-inflammatory cascade involved in the IVIG response mechanism.","Portman, Michael A; Wiener, Howard W; Silva, Miriam; Shendre, Aditi; Shrestha, Sadeep",Pediatr Rheumatol Online J,287,17
2168,2168,2168,A Novel Sample Processing Method for Rapid Detection of Tuberculosis in the Stool of Pediatric Patients Using the Xpert MTB/RIF Assay,14.907273,8.364907,2016-03-23,"BACKGROUND: Tuberculosis (TB) is difficult to diagnose in children using molecular tests, because children have difficulty providing respiratory samples. Stool could replace sputum for diagnostic TB testing if adequate sample processing techniques were available. METHODS: We developed a rapid method to process large volumes of stool for downstream testing by the Xpert MTB/RIF (Xpert) TB-detection assay. The method was tested and optimized on stool samples spiked with known numbers of M. tuberculosis colony forming units (CFU), and stools from M. tuberculosis-infected cynomolgus macaques (Macaca fascicularis). Performance was scored on number of positive Xpert tests, the cycle thresholds (Cts) of the Xpert sample-processing control (SPC), and the Cts of the M. tuberculosis-specific rpoB probes. The method was then validated on 20 confirmed TB cases and 20 controls in Durban, South Africa. RESULTS: The assay’s analytical limit of detection was 1,000 CFU/g of stool. As much as one gram of spiked stool could be tested without showing increased PCR inhibition. In analytical spiking experiments using human stool, 1g samples provided the best sensitivity compared to smaller amounts of sample. However, in Macaques with TB, 0.6g stool samples performed better than either 0.2g or 1.2g samples. Testing the stool of pediatric TB suspects and controls suggested an assay sensitivity of 85% (95% CI 0.6–0.9) and 84% (95% CI 0.6–0.96) for 0.6g and 1.2g stool samples, respectively, and a specificity of 100% (95% CI 0.77–1) and 94% (95% CI 0.7–0.99), respectively. CONCLUSION: This novel approach may permit simple and rapid detection of TB using pediatric stool samples.","Banada, Padmapriya P.; Naidoo, Uvistra; Deshpande, Srinidhi; Karim, Farina; Flynn, JoAnne L.; O’Malley, Melanie; Jones, Martin; Nanassy, Oliver; Jeena, Prakash; Alland, David",PLoS One,287,1

This retrospective study examined data from 23 cases that suffered from ONFH but presented a normal image at the first MRI examination after corticosteroid therapy from June 2005 to December 2013. Data on protopathy, age, sex, time of pain onset, MRI examination, and initial diagnosis were collected and analyzed. Average time from steroid therapy to first MRI examination was 45.7 ± 25.5 days (range, 10–94 days). Average time to final diagnosis was 199.9 ± 165.8 days (range, 32–762 days). Of the 23 cases, 21 cases complained of discomfort and were misdiagnosed because of a normal initial MRI scan. Twelve hips progressed to collapse and 1 hip received lumbar discectomy when got the final diagnosis. Cases with continuous pain (9/21) presented with pain at a later time than those with intermittent pain (12/21), although the continuous pain cases were diagnosed earlier. MRI performed 2 to 3 months after steroid therapy may present normal images. Another MRI examination is necessary to make a definite diagnosis.","Zhao, Feng-Chao; Hu, Huai-Xia; Zheng, Xin; Cang, Ding-Wei; Liu, Xiaoyun; Zhang, Jian-Zhi; Guo, Kai-Jin",Medicine (Baltimore),287,19
3394,3394,3394,Influenza-associated thrombotic microangiopathies,14.623343,8.730543,2017-09-07,"Thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) refers to phenotypically similar disorders, including hemolytic uremic syndromes (HUS) and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP). This review explores the role of the influenza virus as trigger of HUS or TTP. We conducted a literature survey in PubMed and Google Scholar using HUS, TTP, TMA, and influenza as keywords, and extracted and analyzed reported epidemiological and clinical data. We identified 25 cases of influenza-associated TMA. Five additional cases were linked to influenza vaccination and analyzed separately. Influenza A was found in 83%, 10 out of 25 during the 2009 A(H1N1) pandemic. Two patients had bona fide TTP with ADAMTS13 activity <10%. Median age was 15 years (range 0.5–68 years), two thirds were male. Oligoanuria was documented in 81% and neurological involvement in 40% of patients. Serum C3 was reduced in 5 out of 14 patients (36%); Coombs test was negative in 7 out of 7 and elevated fibrin/fibrinogen degradation products were documented in 6 out of 8 patients. Pathogenic complement gene mutations were found in 7 out of 8 patients tested (C3, MCP, or MCP combined with CFB or clusterin). Twenty out of 24 patients recovered completely, but 3 died (12%). Ten of the surviving patients underwent plasma exchange (PLEX) therapy, 5 plasma infusions. Influenza-mediated HUS or TTP is rare. A sizable proportion of tested patients demonstrated mutations associated with alternative pathway of complement dysregulation that was uncovered by this infection. Further research is warranted targeting the roles of viral neuraminidase, enhanced virus-induced complement activation and/or ADAMTS13 antibodies, and rational treatment approaches.

We aimed to audit clinical practices before and after introduction of a national guideline in Wales on RDS management. Anonymised, prospective data on all infants born at <34 weeks of gestation and cared for at one of the participating neonatal units in Wales were collected in two six-month time periods in 2015 and 2018. A national guideline was introduced in 2016 by the Wales Neonatal Network. Data collection included areas of antenatal management, delivery room stabilisation, invasive and non-invasive respiratory support, surfactant treatment and elements of supportive care. Univariate and multivariate methods were used to compare data between the two epochs. Comparing care before and after introduction of the national guideline, areas of significant improvement include use of targeted tidal volume ventilation, use of caffeine therapy, oxygen therapy post-surfactant and increasing early use of parenteral nutrition. Areas of poorer management included levels of positive end expiratory pressures and timing of introduction of enteral feeds. Little variation was seen between level two and three units, although gestational age was a significant independent variable for several practices, including delayed cord clamping, stabilisation with intubation, early enteral feeding and caffeine administration. A national guideline for management of RDS in Wales has significantly improved practice in several areas. However, despite a large volume of high-quality evidence and robust guidance, there remains a significant variation in some elements of best practice for RDS management. Further work should focus on education and training, especially for elements requiring cross-departmental work.","Course, Christopher; Chakraborty, Mallinath",Sci Rep,287,11

These side effects rarely have pathognomonic features. Therefore, they are relevant differential diagnoses of naturally occurring pulmonary diseases. Side effects of drug therapy may mimic much of the clinical-radiological-pathological pattern of interstitial lung diseases; however, precise figures on the frequency of medicamentous induction of interstitial lung disorders are lacking. The diagnostics are based mainly on verifying a compatible disease pattern, excluding differential diagnoses, and assessing the temporal relationship and the consequences of drug abstention. Reexposure is rarely indicated. Strict elimination of the responsible drugs is the most important therapeutic measure. Additional drug therapy, mostly with glucocorticosteroids, may be indicated.

This is due to the positive development of decreasing death rates and a nearly stable rate of new infections. This development is based on the improved prognosis for HIV/AIDS patients due to the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in 1996. Considering this, a new look at the HIV patient as a potential ICU candidate is necessary. The most common referral for ICU therapy is respiratory failure, followed by neurological disorders. In rare cases, HAART-induced side-effects require therapy in the ICU. Very few clinical trials directly compare the outcome of HIV-positive and HIV-negative patients, and most of these data were collected in the pre-HAART era. The ICU outcome does not correlate with HIV-genuine parameters, such as the CD4 cell counts. Thus, a HIV patient can benefit from ICU treatment. Regarding HAART management, open questions still exist especially considering the mechanically ventilated patient. Actually only AZT (Retrovir®) is available as an i.v. formulation. Other antiretroviral medication can only be administered after grinding the tablets. The consequenses of the altered galenic composition with regard to efficacy and development of resistance has not been sufficiently studied. This also applies to risks and benefits of interrupted therapy versus a possibly inappropriate application of HAART. In this survey we also describe possible interactions between HAART and sedative/antiepileptic/tuberculostatic etc. medication. Finally special aspects of HIV exposure in the health care setting are discussed, including essential immediate measures after an injury. Current recommendations for post-exposure prophylaxis are given.","Mandraka, Falitsa; Salzberger, Bernd; Glück, Thomas",Intensivmed Notfallmed,287,8

Results: Gene transfer as a therapeutic option was first successfully applied in children with severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) in 1990. The majority of gene marking or gene therapy protocols approved for human clinical trials to date are related to the treatment of cancer. Besides viral vectors for brain tumors, non-viral vectors, liposomes particularly, with almost no side effects are increasingly used. Conclusions: Different approaches of gene transfer in cancer patients are under investigation. Experimental data of septic shock treatment and rejection therapy of the allograft in organ recipients with gene transfer are encouraging for future applications in clinical trials.","Rogy, M.

6832,6832,6832,Treatment of Complications from Immune Checkpoint Inhibition in Patients with Lung Cancer,14.7581215,8.788888,2018-08-13,"The angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a key factor in the maintenance of intestinal homeostasis. Dysregulation of homeostasis can lead to inflammation of the colon (colitis), which can cause life-threatening enfeeblement or even cancer. Animal models are valuable surrogates in deciphering the pathology behind such human conditions and for screening of putative therapeutic targets or treatment paradigms. However, development of disease models can be time-consuming and technical demanding, which might hamper their application-value. In this study, we genetically disrupted the mouse Ace2 gene by direct injection of in vitro transcribed mRNA coding for transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) into the cytoplasm of outbred Kunming mouse zygotes. Consequently, somatic mutations were induced with an efficiency of 57 %, of which 39 % were frameshift mutations. Moreover, all modifications were stably transferred during germline transmission. In Ace2-knockout male mice (Ace2 (−/y)), we observed severe chemical induced colitis, characterized by considerable weight loss, diarrhea and a shortened colon length. Histologically, Ace2 mutations resulted in the infiltration of leukocytes and the overt damage of the intestinal mucosal barrier. In addition, we detected an increased expression of inflammatory cytokines in the colon tissue of Ace2 (−/y) mice. Collectively, the data indicate that high targeting efficiency and heritability can be achieved in an outbred mouse model by zygote injection of TALEN mRNA. Furthermore, the generated Ace2 (−/y) mice display phenotypic traits reminiscent of colitis and we anticipate that such mice can be of value in studies of the intestinal microbiome or fecal transplantation.

The recognition of risk factors for invasive levofloxacin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae is important for the design of treatment. METHODS: A retrospective review of cases of invasive pneumococcal infections in adults was undertaken. Epidemiologic data, predisposing factors, clinical variables, and outcome were recorded from previously established protocols. Antimicrobial susceptibility was determined by disk diffusion and the Etest method. Serotyping was performed by latex agglutination and Quellung reaction. RESULTS: Twenty patients with infection caused by levofloxacin-resistant pneumococci [minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) ≥2 μg/ml] were compared with 102 patients harboring levofloxacin-susceptible strains; 80 % of levofloxacin-resistant pneumococci were resistant to ≥3 antibiotics but susceptible to penicillin. Most levofloxacin-resistant strains (80 %) belonged to serotype 8. In comparison, only 8 % of levofloxacin-susceptible pneumococci belonged to serotype 8. In the multivariate analysis, residence in public shelters [odds ratio (OR) 26.13; p 0.002], previous hospitalization (OR 61.77; p < 0.001), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection (OR 28.14; p = 0.009), and heavy smoking (OR 14.41; p = 0.016) were associated with an increased risk of infection by levofloxacin-resistant pneumococci. Mortality caused by levofloxacin-resistant and levofloxacin-susceptible pneumococci was 35 and 14 %, respectively. Among HIV-positive individuals infected with levofloxacin-resistant pneumococci 44 % died, but only 12.5 % of HIV-positive patients with levofloxacin-susceptible strains died. CONCLUSIONS: We observed the emergence of serotype 8 as the main cause of invasive disease caused by levofloxacin-resistant S. pneumoniae. HIV-positive patients seem to be prone to infection caused by multidrug-resistant serotype 8 and have a high mortality rate.","Isea-Peña, M. C.; Sanz-Moreno, J.

BALF samples were harvested and used for mNGS as well as microbiological detection. Infectious bacteria or fungi were defined according to relative abundance and number of unique reads. We performed mNGS on 35 BALF samples from 32 patients. The positive rate reached 100% in the mNGS analysis of nine immunocompromised patients. Compared with the culture method, mNGS had a diagnostic sensitivity of 88.89% and a specificity of 74.07% with an agreement rate of 77.78% between these two methods. Compared with the smear method and PCR, mNGS had a diagnostic sensitivity of 77.78% and a specificity of 70.00%. In 13 cases, detection results were positive by mNGS but negative by culture/smear and PCR. The mNGS findings in 11/32 (34.4%) cases led to changes in treatment strategies. Linear regression analysis showed that diversity was significantly correlated with interval between disease onset and sampling. Dynamic changes in reads could indirectly reflect therapeutic effectiveness. BALF mNGS improves sensitivity of pathogen detection and provides guidance in clinical practice.

In silico mutagenesis of two charged residues of the anchor helices of the envelope proteins of DENV shows that Arg-471 and Arg-60 are fundamental to produce bending stress on the membrane.

A prospective, observational, analytical study was conducted at Clermont‐Ferrand University Hospital to correlate serum CC16 level with clinical severity of bronchiolitis in hospitalized infants aged less than 1 year. We analyzed correlations between serum and urinary CC16, CC16 levels and Wainwright score, immediate morbidity due to bronchiolitis, causal viruses, and recurrent wheezing 1 year after inclusion. In 166 infants, serum CC16 did not correlate with acute bronchiolitis severity (P = .49), but urinary CC16 did (P < .001). In multivariate analysis, urinary CC16 correlated mainly with urinary retinol binding protein (RBP; r = 0.70; P < .001). The logCC16u/logRBPu ratio correlated significantly with severity (P = .02). CC16 levels were not correlated with recurrent wheezing at 1 year. Urinary CC16 could be a useful biomarker in acute bronchiolitis for specific indications. This noninvasive assay would be particularly useful in the young infant population. Several factors must be taken into account in its interpretation, mainly tubular function. Further studies are needed to assess these factors.","Egron, Carole; Labbé, André; Rochette, Emmanuelle; Mulliez, Aurélien; Bernard, Alfred; Amat, Flore",Pediatr Pulmonol,287,1

CSF studies undertaken during experimental infection of mice with JHM strain virus (JHMV) of mouse hepatitis virus are presented. A critical pitfall which can lead to erroneous or invalid results is contamination of the CSF by even minute quantities of blood. Means of avoiding this contamination are attention to anatomical reference points, the use of a micropipet, and prior intracardiac perfusion of animals with phosphate-buffered saline. Cells in the CSF were typed as either B, T, polymorphonuclear, or mononuclear cells by the combination of a microcytotoxicity assay and histologic stains. A radioimmunoassay (RIA) allowed quantification of antibodies to JHMV in the CSF and indicated the presence of intrathecal synthesis of antibody in chronically infected mice. The combined use of these sensitive methods makes possible CSF analysis in individual mice rather than in pooled groups.","Fleming, John O.; Ting, Jenny Y.P.; Stohlman, Stephen A.; Weiner, Leslie P.",J Neuroimmunol,287,1

In order to examine effects of an individual movement and spatial control measures on a disease outbreak, we developed a multiscale model and extended the semi-stochastic simulation method by linking individual movements to pathogen’s diffusion, linking the slow dynamics for disease transmission at the population level to the fast dynamics for pathogen shedding/excretion at the individual level. Numerical simulations indicate that during a disease outbreak individuals with the same infection status show the property of clustering and, in particular, individuals’ rapid movements lead to an increase in the average reproduction number [Formula: see text] , the final size and the peak value of the outbreak. It is interesting that a high level of aggregation the individuals’ movement results in low new infections and a small final size of the infected population. Further, we obtained that either high diffusion rate of the pathogen or frequent environmental clearance lead to a decline in the total number of infected individuals, indicating the need for control measures such as improving air circulation or environmental hygiene. We found that the level of spatial heterogeneity when implementing control greatly affects the control efficacy, and in particular, an uniform isolation strategy leads to low a final size and small peak, compared with local measures, indicating that a large-scale isolation strategy with frequent clearance of the environment is beneficial for disease control.","Xiao, Yanni; Xiang, Changcheng; Cheke, Robert A.; Tang, Sanyi",Bull Math Biol,287,1

Although the total number of protein-producing (coding) genes in the mammalian genome is ~20,000, it is evident that the intricate processes of cardiac development and the highly regulated physiological regulation in the normal heart, as well as the complex manifestation of pathological remodeling in a diseased heart, would require a much higher degree of complexity at the transcriptome level and beyond. Indeed, in addition to an extensive regulatory scheme implemented at the level of transcription, the complexity of transcript processing following transcription is dramatically increased. RNA processing includes post-transcriptional modification, alternative splicing, editing and transportation, ribosomal loading, and degradation. While transcriptional control of cardiac genes has been a major focus of investigation in recent decades, a great deal of progress has recently been made in our understanding of how post-transcriptional regulation of mRNA contributes to transcriptome complexity. In this review, we highlight some of the key molecular processes and major players in RNA maturation and post-transcriptional regulation. In addition, we provide an update to the recent progress made in the discovery of RNA processing regulators implicated in cardiac development and disease. While post-transcriptional modulation is a complex and challenging problem to study, recent technological advancements are paving the way for a new era of exciting discoveries and potential clinical translation in the context of cardiac biology and heart disease.","Gao, Chen; Wang, Yibin",Physiol Rev,287,1

The disorder which reportedly has a significant protraction through repeated cousin marriages results in the social maladjustment of the parents of the sick children due to constant depression, anxiety, and weak social interaction and may lead to social isolation as well. This research aims to find out the significant effect of socio-religious trends on psychosocial burden of beta thalassemia major among cousin and non-cousin couples in the province of Punjab in Pakistan. It takes a sample of 932 parents of sick children, among whom 735 were married with cousins and 197 with non-cousins, for data collection. The findings reveal that inadequate knowledge of the disease, insufficient or misdirected social support, stigmatization, and marriage breakups caused by the disease, superstitions, and misinterpretations of religion and the subsequent practices accordingly as significant predictors of psychosocial burden of beta thalassemia major among non-cousins and cousin couples.

Samples of 86 lateral head cephalograms from Dundee Dental School (mean age, 11.8 years) and 335 lateral head cephalograms from the Universitas Padjadjaran Dental Hospital, Bandung, Indonesia (mean age 24.2 years), were measured. The method of nose profile estimation based on skull morphology previously proposed by Rynn and colleagues in 2010 (FSMP 6:20–34) was tested in this study. Following this method, three nasal aperture-related craniometrics and six nose profile dimensions were measured from the cephalograms. To assess the accuracy of the method, six nose profile dimensions were estimated from the three craniometric parameters using the published method and then compared to the actual nose profile dimensions. In the Scottish subadult population, no sexual dimorphism was evident in the measured dimensions. In contrast, sexual dimorphism of the Indonesian adult population was evident in all craniometric and nose profile dimensions; notably, males exhibited statistically significant larger values than females. The published method by Rynn and colleagues (FSMP 6:20–34, 2010) performed better in the Scottish subadult population (mean difference of maximum, 2.35 mm) compared to the Indonesian adult population (mean difference of maximum, 5.42 mm in males and 4.89 mm in females). In addition, regression formulae were derived to estimate nose profile dimensions based on the craniometric measurements for the Indonesian adult population. The published method is not sufficiently accurate for use on the Indonesian population, so the derived method should be used. The accuracy of the published method by Rynn and colleagues (FSMP 6:20–34, 2010) was sufficiently reliable to be applied in Scottish subadult population.","Sarilita, Erli; Rynn, Christopher; Mossey, Peter A.; Black, Sue; Oscandar, Fahmi",Int J Legal Med,287,22

Important also to note the impact of Brazilian authors in international collaboration that is well above the world mean. The collaboration of Brazil with foreign partners brings benefits for both sides, creating the opportunity of Brazilian research access to financing from international agencies. Increases in measures of impact are also seen for both sides. Foreign partners likewise benefit from higher impact factors in the same topic cluster, when collaborating with Brazilian partners.

However, the mechanisms through which the establishment of PAs achieved significant positive effects remain unclear, and how different conservation mechanisms have achieved significant positive social and ecological benefits has also not been sufficiently studied. In this study, we systematically reviewed exemplary cases from Asia, Africa, and South America, using panel data to assess the conservation effectiveness of nature reserves and national parks. By surveying 629 literature samples reported in 31 studies, we found that the establishment of PAs has positive influences on poverty reduction, family incomes, household expenditure, employment, forest cover, biodiversity, carbon sequestration, and a reduction in forest fragmentation. Furthermore, we analyzed the specific aspects that influence the publication of a paper in a high-impact journal. We found that publication is more likely when the research uses panel data, matching methods of data analysis, large samples, and plots or PAs as research units and has significant evaluation results. Our results suggest that future studies should use panel data and matching method analysis to assess the impacts of PAs from multiple perspectives and focus on the effectiveness of specific conservation mechanisms in achieving positive effects.","Ma, Ben; Zhang, Yuqian; Hou, Yilei; Wen, Yali",Int J Environ Res Public Health,287,19

Maintaining their activity with functional electrical stimulation (FES) may improve outcome. We studied feasibility of breath-synchronized expiratory population muscle FES in a mixed ICU population (“Holland study”) and pooled data with our previous work (“Australian study”) to estimate potential clinical effects in a larger group. METHODS: Holland: Patients with a contractile response to FES received active or sham expiratory muscle FES (30 min, twice daily, 5 days/week until weaned). Main endpoints were feasibility (e.g., patient recruitment, treatment compliance, stimulation intensity) and safety. Pooled: Data on respiratory muscle thickness and ventilation duration from the Holland and Australian studies were combined (N = 40) in order to estimate potential effect size. Plasma cytokines (day 0, 3) were analyzed to study the effects of FES on systemic inflammation. RESULTS: Holland: A total of 272 sessions were performed (active/sham: 169/103) in 20 patients (N = active/sham: 10/10) with a total treatment compliance rate of 91.1%. No FES-related serious adverse events were reported. Pooled: On day 3, there was a between-group difference (N = active/sham: 7/12) in total abdominal expiratory muscle thickness favoring the active group [treatment difference (95% confidence interval); 2.25 (0.34, 4.16) mm, P = 0.02] but not on day 5. Plasma cytokine levels indicated that early FES did not induce systemic inflammation. Using a survival analysis approach for the total study population, median ventilation duration and ICU length of stay were 10 versus 52 (P = 0.07), and 12 versus 54 (P = 0.03) days for the active versus sham group. Median ventilation duration of patients that were successfully extubated was 8.5 [5.6–12.2] versus 10.5 [5.3–25.6] days (P = 0.60) for the active (N = 16) versus sham (N = 10) group, and median ICU length of stay was 10.5 [8.0–14.5] versus 14.0 [9.0–19.5] days (P = 0.36) for those active (N = 16) versus sham (N = 8) patients that were extubated and discharged alive from the ICU. During ICU stay, 3/20 patients died in the active group versus 8/20 in the sham group (P = 0.16). CONCLUSION: Expiratory muscle FES is feasible in selected ICU patients and might be a promising technique within a respiratory muscle-protective ventilation strategy. The next step is to study the effects on weaning and ventilator liberation outcome. Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov, ID NCT03453944.

Enrichment analyses of neurodevelopmental expression signatures show that genes associated with MMN tend to be overexpressed in the frontal cortex during prenatal development but are significantly downregulated in adulthood. Endophenotype ranking value calculations comparing MMN and three other candidate psychosis endophenotypes (lateral ventricular volume and two auditory-verbal learning measures) find MMN to be considerably superior.

Our results indicate that a non-parametric GW-RF model shows a high potential for explaining spatial heterogeneity of, and predicting, T2D prevalence over traditional local and global models when inputting six major risk factors. Some of these predictions, however, are marginal. These findings of spatial heterogeneity using GW-RF demonstrate the need to consider local factors in prevention approaches.

This study aimed at investigating the rate of ICU-acquired infections (ICU-AIs) in Iran. METHODS: For the purpose of this multi-center study, the rate of ICU-AIs calculated based on the data collected through Iranian nosocomial infections surveillance system and hospital information system. The data expanded based on 12 months of the year (13,632 records in terms of “hospital-ward-month”), and then, the last observation carried forward method was used to replace the missing data. RESULTS: The mean (standard deviation) age of 52,276 patients with HAIs in the ICUs was 47.37 (30.78) years. The overall rate of ICU-AIs was 96.61 per 1000 patients and 16.82 per 1000 patient-days in Iran’s hospitals. The three main HAIs in the general ICUs were ventilator-associated events (VAE), urinary tract infection (UTI), and pneumonia events & lower respiratory tract infection (PNEU & LRI) infections. The three main HAIs in the internal and surgical ICUs were VAE, UTI, and bloodstream infections/surgical site infections (BSI/SSI). The most prevalent HAIs were BSI, PNEU & LRI and eye, ear, nose, throat, or mouth (EENT) infections in the neonatal ICU and PNEU & LRI, VAE, and BSI in the PICU. Device, catheter, and ventilator-associated infections accounted for 60.96, 18.56, and 39.83% of ICU-AIs, respectively. The ventilator-associated infection rate was 26.29 per 1000 ventilator-days. Based on the Pabon Lasso model, the lowest rates of ICU-AIs (66.95 per 1000 patients and 15.19 patient-days) observed in zone III, the efficient area. CONCLUSIONS: HAIs are common in the internal ICU wards. In fact, VAE and ventilator-related infections are more prevalent in Iran. HAIs in the ICUs leads to an increased risk of ICU-related mortality. Therefore, to reduce ICU-AIs, the specific and trained personnel must be responsible for the use of the devices (catheter use and ventilators), avoid over use of catheterization when possible, and remove catheters earlier.

The usage of chimeric antigens allows serological differentiation between naturally infected and vaccinated animals. In this work, recombinant pentameric vaccination protein particles spontaneously assembled from identical subunits-chimeric fusion proteins derived from circovirus capsid antigen Cap and a multimerizing subunit of mouse polyomavirus capsid protein VP1 were purified and characterized using asymmetric flow field-flow fractionation (AF4) coupled with UV and MALS/DLS (multi-angle light scattering/dynamic light scattering) detectors. Various elution profiles were tested, including constant cross-flow and decreasing cross-flow (linearly and exponentially). The optimal sample retention, separation efficiency, and resolution were assessed by the comparison of the hydrodynamic radius (R(h)) measured by online DLS with the R(h) values calculated from the simplified retention equation according to the AF4 theory. The results show that the use of the combined elution profiles (exponential and constant cross-flow rates) reduces the time of the separation, prevents undesirable sample-membrane interaction, and yields better resolution. Besides, the results show no self-associations of the individual pentameric particles into larger clusters and no sample degradation during the AF4 separation. The R(g)/R(h) ratios for different fractions are in good correlation with morphological analyses performed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM).

The vision for this technology is direct integration into DNA synthesisers thereby omitting manual synthesis and storage of phosphoramidites.","Sandahl, Alexander F.; Nguyen, Thuy J.

However, the mechanism underlying allosteric activation of SIRT6 by the activator MDL-801 remains largely elusive because no major conformational changes are observed upon activator binding. By combining molecular dynamics simulations with biochemical and kinetic analyses of wild-type SIRT6 and its variant M136A, we show that conformational rotation of 2-methyl-4-fluoro-5-bromo substituent on the right phenyl ring (R-ring) of MDL-801, which uncovers previously unseen hydrophobic interactions, contributes to increased activating deacetylation activity of SIRT6. This hypothesis is further supported by the two newly synthesized MDL-801 derivatives through the removal of the 5-Br atom on the R-ring (MDL-801-D1) or the restraint of the rotation of the R-ring (MDL-801-D2). We further propose that the 5-Br atom serves as an allosteric driver that controls the ligand allosteric efficacy. Our study highlights the effect of allosteric enzyme catalytic activity by activator binding and provides a rational approach for enhancing deacetylation activity.","Lu, Shaoyong; Chen, Yingyi; Wei, Jiacheng; Zhao, Mingzhu; Ni, Duan; He, Xinheng; Zhang, Jian",Acta Pharm Sin B,287,1
17921,17921,17921,Racial and socioeconomic disparity associates with differences in cardiac DNA methylation among men with end-stage heart failure,14.770496,8.820228,2021-05-01,"PURPOSE: Open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) are commonly utilized for the repair of distal radius fractures (DRF). While general anesthesia (GA) is typically administered for ORIF, recent studies have also demonstrated promising results with the usage of regional anesthesia (RA) in the surgical treatment of distal radius fractures. This study will compare complication rates between the use of RA versus GA for ORIF of DRFs. METHODS: A multi-institutional surgical registry was utilized to identify patients who had undergone ORIF for DRFs from 2005 to 2018—these patients were stratified into GA and RA cohorts. Patients were matched utilizing coarsened-exact-matching (CEM) to compare postoperative outcomes and rates of 30-day complications were compared between the two cohorts. RESULTS: Upon CEM-matching, 1191 patients receiving RA were matched to 9250 patients who had received GA, with a multivariate imbalance measure (L1) statistic of < 0.001. In the matched-cohort analysis, no significant differences were observed in rates of any complication (all p ≥ 0.083). On multivariate regression analyses, RA was not associated with increased risk for any complication (p = 0.445), minor complications (p = 0.093), major complications (p = 0.758), unplanned reoperations (p = 0.355), unplanned readmissions (p = 0.799), or mortality (p = 0.579). CONCLUSION: With similar safety profiles, RA is a safe and reasonable alternative to GA when managing DRFs surgically. RA may be the preferred anesthetic technique for ORIF of DRFs in patients at high risk with GA, such as those with reactions to GA in the past or with significant cardiopulmonary risk factors.

To provide tailored global prevention strategies, we analyzed the global trends and regional differences in incidence of dengue infection from 1990 to 2019. METHODS: We obtained data on annual dengue episodes and incidence rates, which reflected the epidemic status of dengue infection from the 2019 Global Burden of Disease (GBD) Study. The changes in dengue episodes and estimated annual percentage changes (EAPCs) of the age-standardized incidence rate (ASR) were calculated to quantify the temporal trends of dengue infection. RESULTS: Globally, dengue ASR increased by 1.70% (95% CI 1.62%–1.78%) per year from 1990 to 2011; subsequently, it decreased by 0.41% (95% CI 0.20%–0.62%) per year from 2011 to 2019. However, the global number of dengue episodes increased steadily by 85.47% from 30.67 million in 1990 to 56.88 million in 2019. Against the global trend of decreasing ASR from 2011 to 2019, an increasing trend was reported in Oceania (EAPC 11.01, 95% CI 8.79–13.27), East Asia (EAPC 4.84, 95% CI 2.70–7.03) and Southeast Asia (EAPC 0.38, 95% CI 0.13–0.62). For socio-demographic index (SDI) regions, ASR continued to have an increasing trend in the middle (EAPC 0.26, 95% CI 0.07–0.45) and high-middle (EAPC 1.70, 95% CI 0.98–2.42) SDI regions from 2011 to 2019. In contrast to the global peak age of dengue incidence rate (10 to 25 years), the dengue incidence rate of older people (> 65 years) was higher than in other age groups in low and low-middle SDI regions. Additionally, the proportions of dengue episodes in the > 70-year-old age group increased in 2019 (using the baseline in 1990 or 2011) in most GBD regions. CONCLUSIONS: Global dengue episodes have increased tremendously in 3 decades. Although global dengue ASR decreased in the last decade, it is still increasing in hyperendemic regions including Oceania, East Asia and Southeast Asia, and also in the middle and high-middle SDI regions. More attention should be paid to the elderly because of the higher dengue incidence rate among them in low and low-middle SDI regions and the increased proportions of dengue episodes among the elderly in most GBD regions. Therefore, more efforts should be undertaken to develop targeted prevention strategies for crucial regions and older populations.

The electronic Clinical Reasoning Educational Simulation Tool (eCREST) was developed to improve the clinical reasoning of future physicians. A feasibility trial demonstrated acceptability and potential impacts; however, the processes by which students gathered data were unknown. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to identify the data gathering patterns of final year medical students while using eCREST and how eCREST influences the patterns. METHODS: A mixed methods design was used. A trial of eCREST across 3 UK medical schools (N=148) measured the potential effects of eCREST on data gathering. A qualitative think-aloud and semistructured interview study with 16 medical students from one medical school identified 3 data gathering strategies: Thorough, Focused, and Succinct. Some had no strategy. Reanalysis of the trial data identified the prevalence of data gathering patterns and compared patterns between the intervention and control groups. Patterns were identified based on 2 variables that were measured in a patient case 1 month after the intervention: the proportion of Essential information students identified and the proportion of irrelevant information gathered (Relevant). Those who scored in the top 3 quartiles for Essential but in the lowest quartile for Relevant displayed a Thorough pattern. Those who scored in the top 3 quartiles for Relevant but in the lowest quartile for Essential displayed a Succinct pattern. Those who scored in the top 3 quartiles on both variables displayed a Focused pattern. Those whose scores were in the lowest quartile on both variables displayed a Nonspecific pattern. RESULTS: The trial results indicated that students in the intervention group were more thorough than those in the control groups when gathering data. The qualitative data identified data gathering strategies and the mechanisms by which eCREST influenced data gathering. Students reported that eCREST promoted thoroughness by prompting them to continuously reflect and allowing them to practice managing uncertainty. However, some found eCREST to be less useful, and they randomly gathered information. Reanalysis of the trial data revealed that the intervention group was significantly more likely to display a Thorough data gathering pattern than controls (21/78, 27% vs 6/70, 9%) and less likely to display a Succinct pattern (13/78, 17% vs 20/70, 29%; χ(2)(3)=9.9; P=.02). Other patterns were similar across groups. CONCLUSIONS: Qualitative data suggested that students applied a range of data gathering strategies while using eCREST and that eCREST encouraged thoroughness by continuously prompting the students to reflect and manage their uncertainty. Trial data suggested that eCREST led students to demonstrate more Thorough data gathering patterns. Virtual patients that encourage thoroughness could help future physicians avoid missed diagnostic opportunities and enhance the delivery of clinical reasoning teaching.","Plackett, Ruth; Kassianos, Angelos P; Timmis, Jessica; Sheringham, Jessica; Schartau, Patricia; Kambouri, Maria",J Med Internet Res,287,1

Furthermore, the reduction of dielectric screening in vdW materials enables electrostatic tunability of different polariton modes, including plasmons, excitons, and phonons. One-dimensional vdW materials, particularly single-walled carbon nanotubes, possess unique form factors with confined excitons to enable single-molecule detection as well as in vivo biosensing. We discuss basic sensing principles based on vdW materials, followed by technological challenges such as surface chemistry, integration, and toxicity. Finally, we highlight progress in harnessing vdW materials to demonstrate new sensing functionalities that are difficult to perform with conventional metal/dielectric sensors.","Oh, Sang-Hyun; Altug, Hatice; Jin, Xiaojia; Low, Tony; Koester, Steven J.; Ivanov, Aleksandar P.; Edel, Joshua B.; Avouris, Phaedon; Strano, Michael S.",Nat Commun,287,22

However, it has been associated with various infections such as liver and brain abscesses, bacteremia, osteo-articular infections, and endocarditis. Since 2005, high throughput genome sequencing methods enabled understanding the genetic landscape and diversity of bacteria as well as their pathogenic role. Here, in order to determine whether specific virulence genes could be related to specific clinical manifestations, we compared the genomes from 27 S. intermedius strains isolated from patients with various types of infections, including 13 that were sequenced in our institute and 14 available in GenBank. RESULTS: We estimated the theoretical pangenome size to be of 4,020 genes, including 1,355 core genes, 1,054 strain-specific genes and 1,611 accessory genes shared by 2 or more strains. The pangenome analysis demonstrated that the genomic diversity of S. intermedius represents an “open” pangenome model. We identified a core virulome of 70 genes and 78 unique virulence markers. The phylogenetic clusters based upon core-genome sequences and SNPs were independent from disease types and sample sources. However, using Principal Component analysis based on presence/ absence of virulence genes, we identified the sda histidine kinase, adhesion protein LAP and capsular polysaccharide biosynthesis protein cps4E as being associated to brain abscess or broncho-pulmonary infection. In contrast, liver and abdominal abscess were associated to presence of the fibronectin binding protein fbp54 and capsular polysaccharide biosynthesis protein cap8D and cpsB. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the virulence gene content of 27 S. intermedius strains causing various diseases, we identified putative disease-specific genetic profiles discriminating those causing brain abscess or broncho-pulmonary infection from those causing liver and abdominal abscess. These results provide an insight into S. intermedius pathogenesis and highlights putative targets in a diagnostic perspective.","Sinha, Dhiraj; Sun, Xifeng; Khare, Mudra; Drancourt, Michel; Raoult, Didier; Fournier, Pierre-Edouard",BMC Genomics,287,1

Thirty-eight TX children with a median age of 13 (range 3–19) years were investigated. Mental health was assessed by the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL) 4.0 Generic Core Scales and the Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ-20).

Male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into control, ADR nephrosis, and simvastatin-treated ADR nephrosis groups. ADR nephropathy was induced by a single-tail intravenous injection of ADR (6.5 mg/kg). Anti-inflammatory effects of simvastatin were studied by evaluating the expression of the inflammatory mediators interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β), transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1), and transcription factor nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB). In addition, renal function, serum lipid levels, and histopathology were compared between groups. Simvastatin significantly decreases IL-1β and TGF-β1 expression and NF-κB activation, accompanied by significant attenuation of glomerulosclerosis and renal function at 12 weeks after ADR injection, and these changes occurred in the absence of lowering of serum lipids. These results suggest that overexpression of inflammation in the renal region may contribute to development of glomerulosclerosis in ADR-induced-nephropathy rats, and simvastatin treatment prevented glomerulosclerosis independent of the lipid-lowering effects. The beneficial effect of simvastatin might be mediated by the effect of anti-inflammatory action through a reduction of NF-κB activation, and IL-1β and TGF-β expression.","Zhang, Wei; Li, Qiu; Wang, Lijia; Yang, Xiqiang",Pediatr Nephrol,287,1

Studying the factors that make such a system successful and favourable is important to ensure the merits of its implementation in clinical practice. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate the success of a telepathology system from the users’ perspectives, using specific evaluation criteria, namely: system quality, information quality, technical service quality, user satisfaction, and benefits. METHODS: A sequential explanatory mixed methods design was adopted in this study, which consists of two phases. Initially, a questionnaire was distributed via WhatsApp to all of the pathologists (total: 45) working at governmental hospitals in Kuwait. Followed by, semi-structured interviews with ten senior pathologists. RESULTS: Forty pathologists responded to the questionnaire, giving an 89% response rate. There were 42.5% of the respondents aged between 35–44 years old, and 52.5% were male. The quantitative results reveal that most of the respondents were satisfied with the quality of the telepathology system with a mean of 2.6025 (Standard Deviation (SD) = 0.47176), whereas they were dissatisfied with the quality of the information with a mean of 2.4100 (SD = 1.580) and the technical support services with a mean of 2.2750 (SD = 0.99535). In addition, there was disagreement on the benefits of telepathology in clinical practice among the pathologists with a mean of 2.4667 (SD = 0.77552). The qualitative results indicate that the lack of interest in and little experience with using the system were behind the general dissatisfaction of most of the respondents. All of the interviewees were satisfied with the performance of the telepathology system and considered it successful; however, the quality of the technical support services, including training workshops, was deemed deficient. CONCLUSION: This study concluded that telepathology system in Kuwait is functioning well and has been successful in its implementation; however, pathologists are dissatisfied with it, mainly due to the deficient quality of the technical support services provided. In addition, the successful implementation of such advanced technologies requires careful steps to be taken on multiple levels: technical, organisational, and managerial.

Listeria monocytogenes (Lm), a facultative intracellular foodborne pathogen, can exploit the type I IFN response as part of their pathogenic strategy, but the molecular mechanisms involved remain unclear. Here we show that type I IFN suppresses the antibacterial activity of phagocytes to promote systemic Lm infection. Mechanistically, type I IFN suppresses phagosome maturation and proteolysis of Lm virulence factors ActA and LLO, thereby promoting phagosome escape and cell-to-cell spread; the antiviral protein, IFN-induced transmembrane protein 3 (IFITM3), is required for this type I IFN-mediated alteration. Ifitm3(−/−) mice are resistant to systemic infection by Lm, displaying decreased bacterial spread in tissues, and increased immune cell recruitment and pro-inflammatory cytokine signaling.

Mechanisms involved in PPARγ signaling are poorly understood, yet globally increasing T2DM prevalence demands improvements in drug design. Synthetic, nonactivating PPARγ ligands can abolish the phosphorylation of PPARγ at Ser273, a posttranslational modification correlated with obesity and insulin resistance. It is not understood how these ligands prevent phosphorylation, and the lack of experimental mechanistic information can be attributed to previous ambiguity in the field as well as to limitations in experimental approaches; in silico modeling currently provides the only insight into how ligands block Ser273 phosphorylation. The future availability of experimental evidence is critical for clarifying the mechanism by which ligands prevent phosphorylation and should be the priority of future T2DM-focused research. Following this, the properties of ligands that enable them to block phosphorylation can be improved upon to generate ligands tailored for blocking phosphorylation and therefore restoring insulin sensitivity. This would represent a significant step forward for treating T2DM. This review summarizes current knowledge of the roles of PPARγ in T2DM as well as the effects of synthetic ligands on the modulation of these roles. We hypothesize potential factors that contribute to the reduction in recent developments and summarize what has currently been done to shed light on this critical field of research.","Frkic, Rebecca L.; Richter, Katharina; Bruning, John B.",J Biol Chem,287,17

A targeted, local approach may catalyze actionable change that holds schools accountable for addressing community needs through representation. The aims of our study are to (1) analyze the student racial/ethnic profiles of allopathic and osteopathic medical schools in the diverse state of Illinois and (2) compare student race/ethnicity with that of schools' local county and primary teaching hospital patient populations. Methods: Data from the Association of American Medical Colleges and American Association of College of Osteopathic Medicine were used to gather matriculated student race/ethnicity from the eight allopathic schools and one osteopathic medical school in Illinois. Representational inequity quotients (RIQs) were calculated to determine the proportion of Hispanic/Latinx, black/African American, and total underrepresented in medicine (UIM) individuals in three reference populations (U.S., county, and primary teaching hospital patient populations) relative to each medical school's student racial/ethnic profile. Results: Across Illinois schools, mean RIQs were highest (showed greater inequity) when county demographics were used as the reference population as opposed to U.S. or hospital populations. For all schools individually, Hispanic county-student RIQs were higher than RIQs based on hospital population. For a majority of schools with primary teaching hospital in Cook County, hospital-student RIQs magnified representational inequity for the black population. Conclusions: Using county data to evaluate medical school representation inequities may better reflect UIM representation goals than the U.S. population. Examining hospital demographics may further reveal other structural inequities relevant to medical education, such as primary teaching hospitals that are not adequately serving their surrounding communities. By evaluating RIQs on a local and hospital-population level, schools can periodically assess to what degree their student body and hospital populations represent their communities and adjust recruitment, retention, and service efforts.","Francone, Nicolás O.; Simon, Melissa A.; Ortega, Pilar",Health Equity,287,1

This unusual process is mediated by the viral nuclear egress complex (NEC) that deforms the membrane around the capsid by oligomerizing into a hexagonal, membrane-bound scaffold. Here, we found that highly basic membrane-proximal regions (MPRs) of the NEC alter lipid order by inserting into the lipid headgroups and promote negative Gaussian curvature. We also find that the electrostatic interactions between the MPRs and the membranes are essential for membrane deformation. One of the MPRs is phosphorylated by a viral kinase during infection, and the corresponding phosphomimicking mutations block capsid nuclear egress. We show that the same phosphomimicking mutations disrupt the NEC-membrane interactions and inhibit NEC-mediated budding in vitro, providing a biophysical explanation for the in vivo phenomenon. Our data suggest that the NEC generates negative membrane curvature by both lipid ordering and protein scaffolding and that phosphorylation acts as an off switch that inhibits the membrane-budding activity of the NEC to prevent capsid-less budding.","Thorsen, Michael K.; Lai, Alex; Lee, Michelle W.; Hoogerheide, David P.; Wong, Gerard C.

Among them, the detection and extraction of human skeleton in a dance video based on this technology has a huge market demand in education and training. However, the existing detection and extraction technology has the problems of slow recognition speed and low extraction accuracy. Therefore, this paper proposes a neural network based on particle swarm optimization to detect and extract human skeletons in a dance video. Through the research and test on different data sets, it is found that the neural network based on particle swarm optimization algorithm has good detection and extraction ability and has high accuracy for the detection and recognition of human skeleton points. Among them, on all MPII data sets, the average accuracy of PSO-LSTM proposed in this paper is 3.9% higher than that of other optimal algorithms; on the PoseTrack data set, the average accuracy of detection and extraction is improved by 2.3%. The above results show that the neural network based on particle swarm optimization has fast detection speed and good extraction accuracy and can be used for the detection and extraction of human skeleton in a dance video.","Li, Dingxin",Comput Intell Neurosci,287,1

Among them, leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptors (LILRs) consist of activating and inhibitory receptors that play an important role in regulating immune responses modulating the course of disease progression. On the one hand, inhibitory LILRs constitute a safe-guard system that mitigates the inflammatory response, allowing a prompt return to immune homeostasis. On the other hand, because of their unique capacity to attenuate immune responses, pathogens use inhibitory LILRs to evade immune recognition, thus facilitating their persistence within the host. Conversely, the engagement of activating LILRs triggers immune responses and the production of inflammatory mediators to fight microbes. However, their heightened activation could lead to an exacerbated immune response and persistent inflammation with major consequences on disease outcome and autoimmune disorders. Here, we review the genetic organisation, structure and ligands of LILRs as well as their role in regulating the immune response and inflammation. We also discuss the LILR-based strategies that pathogens use to evade immune responses. A better understanding of the contribution of LILRs to host–pathogen interactions is essential to define appropriate treatments to counteract the severity and/or persistence of pathogens in acute and chronic infectious diseases lacking efficient treatments.","Abdallah, Florence; Coindre, Sixtine; Gardet, Margaux; Meurisse, Florian; Naji, Abderrahim; Suganuma, Narufumi; Abi-Rached, Laurent; Lambotte, Olivier; Favier, Benoit",Front Immunol,287,22

However, scant published research has reported the relationship between serum antibody titers to specific infectious agents in vaccinated cows, the colostrum of these cows, and the serum of calves consuming their colostrum. As part of a larger study, the relationship between cow serum and colostrum antibody titers and calf titers was evaluated. Fifty-four multiparous Jersey and Jersey-cross cows were vaccinated between dry-off and calving with commercially available vaccines containing bovine herpesvirus-1 (BHV-1), bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV), bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV), rotavirus, coronavirus, E. coli J-5, and Salmonella siderophore receptor and porin (SRP); blood was collected at dry off, mid-dry, and at calving. Calves born to enrolled cows were fed colostrum from only their dams; calf serum was collected at 7 and 30 d of life. Antibody titers against agents in the vaccine were measured in serum and colostrum of cows by standard neutralizing techniques or ELISA, and correlations between cow serum antibodies at 30 d before calving, cow colostrum, and calf serum antibodies at 7 d of life were evaluated. Correlations between cow serum antibodies and colostrum antibodies for different agents were significant (P < 0.05) but only moderately strong (Pearson correlation coefficient [PCC] range: 0.32–0.7), and varied for different agents. Similarly, correlations between cow colostrum antibodies and calf serum antibodies were usually significant, but only moderate (PCC range: 0.36–0.77). The R(2) value for the correlation between colostrum antibodies and calf antibodies ranged from 0.11–0.59, indicating that for most agents, the colostrum antibody titer to a given agent did not explain a majority of variation in the calf serum antibody titer to that agent. Antibody titers to specific agents in cows are significantly, but not strongly, correlated with their colostrum antibody titers, and colostrum antibody titers are significantly but not strongly, related to antibody titers in calves. These data suggest that, in addition to maternal antibody concentration, other factors have an important impact on serum antibody titers to specific infectious agents in young dairy calves.","McLean, D.

Although antibiotics have been shown to be somewhat effective in the treatment of these disorders, increasing concern over the emergence of pathogen resistence to these agents underscores the need for the development of other treatment options, including agents to treat and/or prevent vURIs. Earlier research implicated roles for cytopathology, cellular infiltration, and inflammatory mediators such as bradykinin, in the pathogenesis of vURIs and its complications, including OM and sinusitis, but these factors are now recognized as late events with specific and limited contributions to disease expression. Current therapies are relatively ineffective and aimed at reducing symptoms rather than moderating underlying mechanisms. Nasal elevations of proinflammatory cytokines and leukotrienes track symptom expression during vURIs, and it is hypothesized that these chemicals orchestrate a common response to infection with many different viruses causing vURIs. Moreover, recent evidence demonstrates that specific cytokine gene polymorphisms may modulate the severity of illness and incidence of complications during episodes of vURI. Additionally, other evidence supports a role for neurogenic inflammation in the development of complications. Future studies should dissect the role of proinflammatory cytokines, leukotrienes, and neuropeptides in the expression of symptoms, signs, pathophysiologies, and complications of vURIs.","Gentile, Deborah A.; Schaffner, Timothy J.; Schad, Christine A.; Skoner, David P.",Allergy Frontiers: Clinical Manifestations,287,1

Food distribution is a complex system that can be seen as a network of trade flows connecting supply chain actors. Identifying the source of an outbreak of foodborne disease distributed across this network can be solved by considering this network structure and the dimensions of information it contains. The literature on the network source identification problem has grown widely in recent years covering problems in many different contexts, from contagious disease infecting a human population, to computer viruses spreading through the Internet, to rumors or trends diffusing through a social network. Much of this work has focused on studying this problem in analytically tractable frameworks, designing approaches to work on trees and extending to general network structures in an ad hoc manner. These simplified frameworks lack many features of real-world networks and problem contexts that can dramatically impact transmission dynamics, and therefore, backwards inference of the transmission process. Moreover, the features that distinguish foodborne disease in the context of source identification have not previously been studied or identified. In this article we identify these features, then provide a review of existing work on the network source identification problem, categorizing approaches according to these features. We conclude that much of the existing work cannot be implemented in the foodborne disease problem because it makes assumptions about the transmission process that are unrealistic in the context of food supply networks—that is, identifying the source of an epidemic contagion whereas foodborne contamination spreads through a transport network-mediated diffusion process, or because it requires data that is not available—complete observations of the contamination status of all nodes in the network.","Horn, Abigail L.; Friedrich, Hanno",Dynamics On and Of Complex Networks III,287,1

Previous work has shown that higher resistance against PD has underlying additive genetic components and can potentially be improved through selective breeding. To better understand the genetic basis of PD resistance in Atlantic salmon, we challenged 4506 smolts from 296 families of the SalmoBreed strain. Fish were challenged through intraperitoneal injection with the most virulent form of the virus found in Norway (i.e., SAV3). Mortalities were recorded, and more than 900 fish were further genotyped on a 55 K SNP array. RESULTS: The estimated heritability for PD resistance was 0.41 ± 0.017. The genetic markers on two chromosomes, ssa03 and ssa07, showed significant associations with higher disease resistance. Collectively, markers on these two QTL regions explained about 60% of the additive genetic variance. We also sequenced and compared the cardiac transcriptomics of moribund fish and animals that survived the challenge with a focus on candidate genes within the chromosomal segments harbouring QTL. Approximately 200 genes, within the QTL regions, were found to be differentially expressed. Of particular interest, we identified various components of immunoglobulin-heavy-chain locus B (IGH-B) on ssa03 and immunoglobulin-light-chain on ssa07 with markedly higher levels of transcription in the resistant animals. These genes are closely linked to the most strongly QTL associated SNPs, making them likely candidates for further investigation. CONCLUSIONS: The findings presented here provide supporting evidence that breeding is an efficient tool for increasing PD resistance in Atlantic salmon populations. The estimated heritability is one of the largest reported for any disease resistance in this species, where the majority of the genetic variation is explained by two major QTL. The transcriptomic analysis has revealed the activation of essential components of the innate and the adaptive immune responses following infection with SAV3. Furthermore, the complementation of the genomic with the transcriptomic data has highlighted the possible critical role of the immunoglobulin loci in combating PD virus.","Hillestad, Borghild; Makvandi-Nejad, Shokouh; Krasnov, Aleksei; Moghadam, Hooman K.",BMC Genomics,287,19

Inflammation is initiated as a result of the TBI, which is in association with severity of illness and mortality in brain trauma patients, especially in subdural hemorrhage and epidural hemorrhage cases. A high percentage of adults admitted to the intensive care unit with TBI are diagnosed with vitamin D deficiency; this deficiency may induce impaired immune responses and increase the risk of infections. Vitamin D intervention has been shown to modulate pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines in non-critically ill patients, but to date, there is no substantial data on the effectiveness of vitamin D for the improvement of immune function in traumatic brain injury patients. METHODS/DESIGN: A randomized clinical trial (RCT) will be performed on 74 Iranian adults 18–65 years old with brain trauma and will be treated daily with vitamin D supplements (100,000 IU oral drop) or a similar placebo (1000 IU) for 5 days. DISCUSSION: If this randomized clinical trial demonstrates reductions in inflammatory cytokines, it would provide evidence for a multicenter clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy of vitamin D supplementation in neurocritically ill patients. Since vitamin D supplements are inexpensive and safe, this clinical trial could have the potential to improve clinical outcomes in traumatic brain injury patients through reduction of inflammation and infection-associated morbidity and mortality rates.

CASE REPORT - CASE DESCRIPTION: A 37-year-old male hospital doctor of presented to the Early Inflammatory Arthritis clinic with a four-week history of acute onset joint pain, swelling and early morning stiffness in excess of two hours. The symptoms began at the left ankle with Achilles’ tendonitis but progressed over the following 72 hours to a symmetrical polyarthritis affecting the wrists, proximal interphalangeal joints, shoulders, elbows, and knees. Approximately five weeks prior to the onset of his joint symptoms he had laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection with six days of fever, non-productive cough, and fatigue. He did not require hospitalisation. His past medical history was significant for biopsy proven non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. There was no prior history of inflammatory arthritis and no personal or family history of skin psoriasis, inflammatory bowel disease or uveitis. There was no preceding genitourinary or gastrointestinal upset. His family history was significant for a sister with seronegative rheumatoid arthritis for which she was taking sulfasalazine. Examination revealed a normal BMI, synovitis at the wrists and proximal interphalangeal joints without evidence of joint effusion in the large joints. Blood tests revealed elevations in the ESR (83 mm/hour, reference range 0-10 mm/hour) and CRP (25mg/dL, reference range <5mg/dL). Serology was negative for the rheumatoid factor, anti-CCP antibodies, antinuclear antibodies, and an extractable nuclear antigen panel. Radiographs of the affected joints were unremarkable. Serological testing was positive for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies. He was started on oral Prednisolone 20mg daily and an NSAID with good symptomatic response and normalisation of his ESR (5mm/hour) and CRP (<1mg/dL). The course of prednisolone was tapered over a 6-week period and he is still in steroid free remission with normal inflammatory markers at follow up. The patient was given a diagnosis of a post-viral reactive arthritis which was attributed to the preceding COVID-19 illness. CASE REPORT - DISCUSSION: Post infectious inflammatory arthritis has been described with many viral infections including: hepatitis virus, parvovirus B19, enterovirus, rubella, alphavirus (including Chikungunya), flavivirus (including Zika), herpes viruses (including Epstein-Barr virus), varicella, cytomegalovirus and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Interestingly, viral arthritis has not been reported in influenza and human coronaviruses (including SARS and MERS). Arthralgia was reported in 14.9% of laboratory confirmed COVID-19 cases in China during the early phases of the pandemic but inflammatory arthritis was not well described. The clinical course of the inflammatory arthritis in this case was self-limiting with enthesitis and synovitis resolving within six weeks of onset with the mainstay of treatment being symptomatic relief in the form of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and corticosteroids. Patient perspective: When I woke up that Tuesday morning with severe joint pains and stiffness, I knew something was not right. It was not like anything I have felt before in terms of my joints, having had sports injuries in the past. It was to the point where I was even struggling to go from sitting to standing. Without Prednisolone, I feel as if I would not have been able to work and may even have been house bound. I was relieved that this inflammatory arthritis did respond to Prednisolone. After six weeks of taking Prednisolone, the condition seemed to settle. CASE REPORT - KEY LEARNING POINTS: A self-limiting episode of inflammatory arthritis may occur following COVID-19 infection.","Gibson, Mark; Sampat, Karan; Coakley, Gerald",Rheumatol Adv Pract,287,16

Healthcare workers (HCWs) are particularly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic with high infection rates reported from HCWs in hard-hit regions(2,3), raising concerns about nosocomial infections and the effectiveness of personal protective equipment in protecting HCWs. Asymptomatic infection is estimated 17.9% to 33.3%(4) and is a common source of transmission(5). We designed a HCW testing program to address patient and employee concerns about exposures in the healthcare setting at our 808-bed health system. During the time of employee testing, the mean (range) number of inpatients with a diagnosis of COVID was 30 (22–38) of a mean (range) daily census of 560 (492–602) (approximately 5.4%). METHODS: This opt-in program offered SARS-CoV-2 testing of asymptomatic HCWs with paired nasopharyngeal or mid-turbinate swab for PCR (Roche) and serum IgG antibody testing (Diazyme). While initially designed as a pilot project in the Emergency Departments and COVID-19 units, it was quickly expanded to a health system-wide initiative. RESULTS: From April 22 to June 2, PCR testing was performed on 5826 asymptomatic HCWs with four PCR tests resulting positive (0.09%). Of 5589 serologic tests (anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG) performed, 57 tested positive (1.02 %). All HCW with a positive IgG had a concurrent negative PCR. CONCLUSION: In this cross-sectional evaluation, the point prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG in asymptomatic HCWs at UC San Diego was less than 1%, supporting modeling estimations at the San Diego County level of very low levels of community exposure at the time of this testing. Further analyses of incidence rates and potential risk factors such as employee roles within the healthcare system, community and healthcare exposures, and home zip code are underway. Asymptomatic HCW testing is a strategy that can provide the perception of additional safety to both the workforce and patients as the health system reopens, while potentially reduce transmission from asymptomatic persons through active case finding and isolation.

Here, from 273 COVID-19 patients, we identified six reinfections based on clinical, phylogenetic, virological, serological, and epidemiological data. During the second episode, we observed re-emergence of COVID-19 symptoms, new pulmonary lesions on CT images, increased viral load, and secondary humoral immune responses. The interval between the two episodes ranged from 19 to 57 days, indicating COVID-19 reinfections could occur after a short recovery period in convalescent patients. More importantly, reinfection occurred not only in patients with inadequate immunity after the primary infection, but also in patients with measurable levels of neutralizing antibodies.

METHOD: A rapid retrospective audit was conducted of all patients presenting to our T&O service in April 2020, with particular emphasis compliance with COVID BOAST. RESULTS: Our service conducted 511 outpatient reviews, and 95 operative procedures. 94% of outpatients were treated non-operatively. We provided telephone appointments to 12.8% of follow-up patients, and 39% of new patients. 82% of patients were treated with removable casts/splints/boots. 23% of patients were discharged direct from VFC or after one face-to-face fracture clinic review.

They are found in abundance in semen as compared to other fluids. Exosomes contain a cargo of lipid molecules, proteins, phospholipids, cholesterol, mRNAs, and miRNAs. Each molecule of seminal exosomes (SE) has a potential role in male reproduction for childbirth. Many potential candidates are available within the seminal exosomes that can be used as diagnostic markers for various diseases or syndromes associated with male reproduction. Also these seminal exospmes play a major role in female reproductive tract for effective fertilization. AIM: The aim of this review is to focus on the advancement of human seminal exosomal research and its various properties. METHODS: We used many databases like Scopus, Google scholar, NCBI-NLM and other sources to filter the articles of interest published in exosomes. We used phrases like “Exosomes in human semen”, “Composition of exosomes in human semen” and other relevant words to filter the best articles. RESULTS: Seminal exosomes play a major role in sperm functions like cell-to-cell communication, motility of the sperm cells, maintaining survival capacity for the sperm in the female reproductive tract and spermatogenesis. Also, seminal exosomes are used as a carrier for many regulatory elements using small RNA molecules. miRNAs of the seminal exosomes can be used as a diagnostic marker for prostate cancer instead of prostate specific antigen (PSA). Epididymosomes can be used as a biomarker for reproductive diseases and male infertility. CONCLUSION: Seminal exosomes could be used as biological markers for various reproductive disorders, male infertility diagnosis, and it can be used in anti-retroviral research for the identification of novel therapeutics for HIV-1 infection and transmission.","Vickram, A.S.; Srikumar, P.S.; Srinivasan, S.; Jeyanthi, Palanivelu; Anbarasu, K.; Thanigaivel, S.; Nibedita, Dey; Jenila Rani, D.; Rohini, Karunakaran",Saudi J Biol Sci,287,16

However, PCa eventually progresses to castration‐resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), largely because of androgen receptor variation and increased intratumoral androgen synthesis. Several studies have reported that one abnormal lipid accumulation is significantly related to the development of PCa. Melatonin (MLT) is a functionally pleiotropic indoleamine molecule and a key regulator of energy metabolism. The aim of our study is finding the links between CRPC and MLT and providing the basis for MLT treatment for CRPC. METHODS: We used animal CRPC models with a circadian rhythm disorder, and PCa cell lines to assess the role of melatonin in PCa. RESULTS: We demonstrated that MLT treatment inhibited tumor growth and reversed enzalutamide resistance in animal CRPC models with a circadian rhythm disorder. A systematic review and meta‐analysis demonstrated that MLT is positively associated with an increased risk of developing advanced PCa. Restoration of carboxylesterase 1 (CES1) expression by MLT treatment significantly reduced lipid droplet (LD) accumulation, thereby inducing apoptosis by increasing endoplasmic reticulum stress, reducing de novo intratumoral androgen synthesis, repressing CRPC progression and reversing the resistance to new endocrine therapy.

Patients with ASUC can deteriorate rapidly and hence require close monitoring of vital signs correlated with clinical, biochemical and radiological investigations. Traditionally, patients are admitted to hospital to facilitate endoscopic assessment, exclude concomitant infective complications, monitor response to first-line corticosteroid treatment and determine the need for and timing of rescue therapy and/or colectomy. Ambulatory care pathways, which utilise outpatient monitoring and drug delivery, have been shown to deliver safe and effective treatment for conditions which have historically mandated hospitalisation e.g. pulmonary embolus. To date there are a paucity of data regarding the use of ambulatory pathways in ASUC cohorts. We used data from PROTECT, a UK multicentre observational COVID-19 i (IBD) study, to report the extent, safety and effectiveness of ASUC ambulatory pathways. METHODS: Adults (≥ 18 years old) meeting Truelove and Witts criteria between 01/01/2019- 01/06/2019 and 01/03/2020–30/06/2020 were recruited to PROTECT (Figure 1). We utilised demographic, disease phenotype, treatment outcomes and 3-month follow-up data. Primary outcome was rate of rescue therapy and/or colectomy. Secondary outcomes included corticosteroid response, response to rescue therapy, colectomy, mortality and hospital readmission within 3-months. We compared outcomes in 3 cohorts: i) patients treated entirely in inpatient setting; ambulatory patients subdivided into ii) patients hospitalised and subsequently discharged to ambulatory care; iii) patients managed as ambulatory from diagnosis. RESULTS: 38%(23/60) participating hospitals used ambulatory pathways. Of 770 eligible patients, 700(91%) patients received entirely inpatient care, 55(7%) patients were discharged to ambulatory pathways and 15(2%) patients were managed as ambulatory from diagnosis. The rate of rescue therapy and/or colectomy (49%[339/696] vs 41%[22/54] vs 67%[10/15], respectively, p=0.18) (figure 2) and secondary outcomes were similar among all three cohorts. After 3-months follow up from the index ASUC diagnosis there was no significant difference in either rate of UC flare, readmission to hospital with UC flare or colectomy between the cohorts. CONCLUSION: In the largest description of ambulatory ASUC care to date, we report an emerging practice which challenges treatment paradigms. Our data suggest ambulatory ASUC treatment may be safe and effective in selected patients but further studies exploring clinical and cost effectiveness as well as patient and physician acceptability are needed.","Patel, K V; Segal, J; Sebastian, S; Subramanian, S; Conley, T; Gonzalez, H; Kent, A; Saifuddin, A; Hicks, L; Mehta, S; Bhala, N; Brookes, M; Lamb, C; Kennedy, N; Walker, G",J Crohns Colitis,287,1

The COVID‐19 pandemic displaced students and teachers from classrooms around the world. In response to these alterations, universities emergently transitioned to online course offerings. In this study, the perceptions and attitudes towards emergency remote teaching for faculty using the FT method were compared to those practicing the TT method, A survey instrument was used to collect the experiences of both FT educators (FTEs; n=23) and TT educators (TTEs; n=18) during their transition to mandatory online teaching. It was hypothesized that the FTEs would experience a smoother transition to online teaching compared to TTEs because FTEs had access to previously developed resources such as lecture videos and engaging resources for students to utilize outside the classroom. Three researchers coded the participants’ responses to the survey questions and extracted common and recurring themes. It was found that 47% of FTEs reported a smooth transition to online teaching whereas only 17% of TTEs made a similar claim. Conversely, only 4% of FTEs reported having a difficult transition to online teaching compared to 33% of TTEs. Moreover, 100% of FTEs felt that at least one aspect of their flipped classroom helped them transition their course to the online platform. FTEs generally reported higher levels of confidence and experience with online teaching. These findings suggest that FTEs were more experienced with online teaching, had greater confidence in their skillset, and FT strategies supported their transition to emergency remote learning. Thus, the FT model could be one of the remote teaching methods to be used.","Gopalan, Chaya; Serrano, Charles; Dickey, Paige; Bracey, Georgia; Fickas, Julie; Bartels, Lynn; Locke, Sharon",FASEB J,287,8

In humans and mice, nonpathogenic viruses present in the gastrointestinal tract enhance the effects of the native bacterial microbiota. However, it is unclear whether nonpathogenic gastrointestinal viruses, such as Nora virus that infects Drosophila melanogaster, lead to similar observations. Longevity analysis of Nora virus infected (NV+) and uninfected (NV−) D. melanogaster in relationship to presence (B+) or absence (B-) of the native gut bacteria using four different treatment groups, NV+/B+, NV+/B−, NV−/B+, and NV−/B−, was conducted. Data from the longevity results were tested via Kaplan-Meier analysis and demonstrated that Nora virus can be detrimental to the longevity of the organism, whereas bacterial presence is beneficial. These data led to the hypothesis that gastrointestinal bacterial composition varies from NV+ to NV− flies. To test this, NV+ and NV− virgin female flies were collected and aged for 4 days. Surface sterilization followed by dissections of the fat body and the gastrointestinal tract, divided into crop (foregut), midgut, and hindgut, were performed. Ribosomal 16S DNA samples were sequenced to determine the bacterial communities that comprise the microflora in the gastrointestinal tract of NV+ and NV− D. melanogaster. When analyzing operational taxonomic units (OTUs), the data demonstrate that the NV+ samples consist of more OTUs than NV− samples. The NV+ samples were both more rich and diverse in OTUs compared to NV−. When comparing whole body samples to specific organs and organ sections, the whole fly was more diverse in OTUs, whereas the crop was the most rich. These novel data are pertinent in describing where Nora virus infection may be occurring within the gastrointestinal tract, as well as continuing discussion between the relationship of persistent viral and bacterial interaction.","Schissel, Makayla; Best, Rebecca; Liesemeyer, Shelby; Tan, Yuan-De; Carlson, Darby J.; Shaffer, Julie J.; Avuthu, Nagavardhini; Guda, Chittibabu; Carlson, Kimberly A.",AIMS Microbiol,287,1

Digital media enable journalists to report even in quarantine, but new challenges such as the wide circulation of health mis-/disinformation and private information emerge. Moreover, journalists have to contend with broader structural contexts of shutdown not just of a mainstream broadcast but also of community newspapers serving as critical sources of pandemic-related information.

This research aimed to investigate the effect of an influencer moderating the path between the coproducer and brand’s mutual information. To fulfil this objective, we collected Thai customers’ message posts from 50 brands’ fan pages in 2020. The data preparation process used word segmentation and keyword relevance identification. Finally, the data set of 300 vectors with four measurement variables, including coproducer, influencer, mutual information, and customer value, was analysed by PROCESS Model 7 in SPSS. The results showed that the antecedent variables have positive effects on customer value, with the exception of the influencer moderating variable, which has a negative coefficient of − 0.055 (p < 0.1). Since the moderating effect of influencers has decreased the indirect effect on customer value, traditional influencer marketing must be improved to support customers who engage in expertise consumption as coproducers.","Piriyakul, Intaka; Piriyakul, Rapepun",J Market Anal,287,1

We showed previously that rotaviruses block gene expression induced by type I and II IFNs, through a mechanism allowing activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 1 and STAT2 but preventing their nuclear accumulation. This normally occurs through activated STAT1/2 dimerization, enabling an interaction with importin α5 that mediates transport into the nucleus. In rotavirus-infected cells, STAT1/2 inhibition may limit the antiviral actions of IFN produced early in infection. Here we further analysed the block to STAT1/2 nuclear accumulation, showing that activated STAT1 accumulates in the cytoplasm in rotavirus-infected cells. STAT1/2 nuclear accumulation was inhibited by rotavirus even in the presence of the nuclear export inhibitor Leptomycin B, demonstrating that enhanced nuclear export is not involved in STAT1/2 cytoplasmic retention. The ability to inhibit STAT nuclear translocation was completely conserved amongst the group A rotaviruses tested, including a divergent avian strain. Analysis of mutant rotaviruses indicated that residues after amino acid 47 of NSP1 are dispensable for STAT inhibition. Furthermore, expression of any of the 12 Rhesus monkey rotavirus proteins did not inhibit IFN-stimulated STAT1 nuclear translocation. Finally, co-immunoprecipitation experiments from transfected epithelial cells showed that STAT1/2 binds importin α5 normally following rotavirus infection. These findings demonstrate that rotavirus probably employs a novel strategy to inhibit IFN-induced STAT signalling, which acts after STAT activation and binding to the nuclear import machinery.","Holloway, Gavan; Dang, Vi T; Jans, David A; Coulson, Barbara S",The Journal of general virology,287,1

Since that time the implementation of measures for risk prevention and safety precaution was socially and politically accepted. Currently emerging pathogens like arboviruses and the well-known bacterial contamination of platelet concentrates still remain major concerns of blood safety with important clinical consequences, but very rarely with fatal outcome for the blood recipient. In contrast to the well-established pathogen inactivation strategies for fresh frozen plasma using the solvent-detergent procedure or methylene blue and visible light, the bench-to-bedside translation of novel pathogen inactivation technologies for cell-containing blood components such as platelets and red blood cells are still underway. This review summarizes the pharmacological/toxicological assessment and the inactivation efficacy against viruses, bacteria, and protozoa of each of the currently available pathogen inactivation technologies and highlights the impact of the results obtained from several randomized clinical trials and hemovigilance data. Until now in some European countries pathogen inactivation technologies are in in routine use for single-donor plasma and platelets. The invention and adaption of pathogen inactivation technologies for red blood cell units and whole blood donations suggest the universal applicability of these technologies and foster a paradigm shift in the manufacturing of safe blood.","Schlenke, Peter",Transfusion medicine and hemotherapy : offizielles Organ der Deutschen Gesellschaft fur Transfusionsmedizin und Immunhamatologie,287,7

However, there is often uncertainty about its applicability and feasibility in non-Western countries. OBJECTIVE To provide an overview and assessment of interventions that aimed to improve patients' participation in decision making in non-Western countries. METHOD Ovid Medline, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, CINAHL, Ovid MEDLINE(R) Epub Ahead of Print, In-Process, Other Non-Indexed Citations, without Revisions and Daily Update and Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects, were searched from respective inception to February 2018. Studies were included if they (a) were randomized controlled trials, before-and-after studies and interrupted time series studies; (b) were conducted in non-Western countries; (c) aimed to improve patients' participation in dyadic decision making; and (d) reported outcomes relevant to patient participation in decision making. Studies were excluded if they included children, were about triadic decision making or solely focused on information provision without reporting outcomes related to patient participation. Narrative synthesis method was used for data analysis and presentation. RESULTS A total of 17 studies, 6 RCTs and 11 non-RCTs, were included across ten countries. Intervention strategies included patient and/or provider communication skills training, decision aids and a question prompt material. Whilst most of the studies reported increased patient participation, those interventions which had provider or patient training in communication skills were found to be more effective. CONCLUSION Interventions to improve patient participation, within the context of dyadic decision making, in non-Western countries can be feasible and effective if communication skills training is provided for health-care providers and/or patients.","Dolan, Hankiz; Li, Mu; Trevena, Lyndal",Health expectations : an international journal of public participation in health care and health policy,287,12

The titer change of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 needs to be further clarified, the clinical and preventive value of antibodies still needs to be further investigated. METHOD An ELISA was established by coating with SARS-CoV-2 recombinant spike protein and used to detect serum IgM and IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in COVID-19 patients to evaluate the pattern of changes of antibodies. RESULTS The specificity of the ELISA for detection SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG were 96% (144/150) and 100% (150/150), respectively. The sensitivity of ELISA was 100% (150/150) for IgM, and 99.3% (149/150) for IgG. SARS-CoV-2-SP-IgM and SP-IgG antibodies could be detected on day 1 of hospitalization in 12.5% patients, and SP-IgM began to decrease after reaching its peak at around 22-28 days, and become negative at month 3 in 30% patients and negative at month 7 in 79% of these patients after onset; IgG reached its peak around day 22-28 and kept at a high level within the longest observation period for 4 months, it dropped very sharply at 7 months. The positive rates of SP-IgM and SP-IgG were higher than those of RT-qPCR on day 7 and 4. CONCLUSION The established indirect ELISA has good specificity and sensitivity. IgM and IgG against SARS-CoV-2 appeared almost simultaneously in the early stage, and the level of IgG antibodies couldn't maintain a high plateau in the observation period of 7 months.

This systematic review of the literature was performed to appraise the existing clinical evidence concerning the use of the single-incision technique for spleen resection. METHODS We performed a systematic search of the PubMed and Scopus databases, and the studies retrieved were included in our review. The references of the included studies were also hand searched. RESULTS Thirty-one relevant studies were found in the field including 81 patients with an age range from 0.6 to 90 years and a body mass index range from 18 to 36.7 kg/m2. Splenomegaly (44.6%), idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (31%), and immune thrombocytopenic purpura (6.8%) were the most common indications for the procedure. Concerning the applied port system, multiple single ports (5 to 12 mm) were used in 54.4% of patients, the SILS port (Covidien, Mansfield, Massachusetts) was used in 26.6%, the TriPort (Advanced Surgical Concepts, Wicklow, Ireland) was used in 7.6%, glove ports were used in 6.3%, and the GelPort (Applied Medical, Rancho Santa Margarita, California) was used in 5.1%. The median operative time was 125 minutes (range, 45-420 minutes), and the median quantity of blood loss was 50 mL (range, 10-450 mL). No conversion to open surgery and no transfusion were needed. The length of hospital stay was between 1 and 9 days. Low rates of complications and no patient deaths were found. The existing evidence on cosmesis is limited. CONCLUSION Single-site/single-port laparoscopic surgery is a minimally invasive procedure that seems to be a challenging alternative in the management of spleen resection.","Gkegkes, Ioannis D; Mourtarakos, Sarantis; Iavazzo, Christos",JSLS : Journal of the Society of Laparoendoscopic Surgeons,287,1

Few studies have investigated these associations among African American women. METHODS To assess the relation of aspirin use to risk of breast cancer in African American women, we conducted a prospective analysis within the Black Women's Health Study, an ongoing nationwide cohort study of 59,000 African American women. On baseline and follow-up questionnaires, women reported regular use of aspirin (defined as use at least 3 days per week) and years of use. During follow-up from 1995 through 2017, 1919 invasive breast cancers occurred, including 1112 ER+, 569 ER-, and 284 triple-negative (TN) tumors. We used age-stratified Cox proportional hazards regression models to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for associations of aspirin use with risk of ER+, ER-, and TN breast cancer, adjusted for established breast cancer risk factors. RESULTS Overall, the HR for current regular use of aspirin relative to non-use was 0.92 (95% CI 0.81, 1.04). For ER+, ER-, and TN breast cancer, corresponding HRs were 0.98 (0.84, 1.15), 0.81 (0.64, 1.04), and 0.70 (0.49, 0.99), respectively. CONCLUSIONS Our findings with regard to ER- and TN breast cancer are consistent with hypothesized inflammatory mechanisms of ER- and TN breast cancer, rather than hormone-dependent pathways. Aspirin may represent a potential opportunity for chemoprevention of ER- and TN breast cancer.","Bertrand, Kimberly A; Bethea, Traci N; Gerlovin, Hanna; Coogan, Patricia F; Barber, Lauren; Rosenberg, Lynn; Palmer, Julie R",Breast cancer research : BCR,287,20

Mean width was 3.1 cm ± 1.0, 4.4 cm ± 0.7, 3.8 cm ± 0.4, and 4.5 cm ± 0.7, respectively. Paired-antenna ablations were more spherical (aspect ratios, 0.72-0.79 for 5-10 min) than single-antenna ablations (aspect ratios, 0.57-0.59). For paired-antenna ablations, 1-cm spacing appeared optimal, with improved circularity and decreased clefting compared with 2-cm spacing (circularity, 0.85 at 1 cm, 0.78 at 2 cm). CONCLUSIONS Modified triaxial antennas can generate relatively short, spherical ablation zones. Paired-antenna ablations were rounder and larger in transverse dimension than single antenna ablations, with 1-cm spacing optimal for confluence of the ablation zone.","Lubner, Meghan G; Ziemlewicz, Tim J; Hinshaw, J Louis; Lee, Fred T; Sampson, Lisa A; Brace, Christopher L",Journal of vascular and interventional radiology : JVIR,287,24

The growing need for ESKD services for a surging population of dialysis-dependent patients has made obvious a workforce crisis affecting nephrology. For a multitude of reasons, the physician workforce supply available to provide dialysis care has failed to expand commensurate with patients need in recent years. Of most importance, fewer US trainees are choosing to enter nephrology, and fewer international medical graduates are available to fill training program rosters. Equally important but less frequently cited are occupational shortages of trained dialysis nurses and PCTs. This article brings attention to this complex workforce shortage and addresses the limited information available regarding how it might constitute a barrier to optimal dialysis care.","Gaietto, Karen J; Williams, Mark E",Seminars in dialysis,287,1

Data from sentinel travelers upon their return to medically sophisticated environments can also benefit local populations in resource-limited countries. RECENT FINDINGS Provider-based surveillance of travelers is increasingly sophisticated. Recently, networks such as GeoSentinel have provided cumulative trends in travel-related illness to assess pretravel risk for a mass gathering event--the Beijing Olympic Games. Data provided by the GeoSentinel also helped in determining the seasonality of dengue by region of travel and risk of acquiring schistosomiasis after a single short exposure. For chikungunya fever, detailed study of returned travelers exposed new clinical aspects of a disease previously studied in the tropics only. Clusters of hepatitis A, a vaccine-preventable disease, among European travelers, illustrated continued gaps in the preparation of the traveling public. Plasmodium knowlesi has emerged as the fifth human malaria parasite and is now a consideration in the diagnosis of febrile travelers from Asia. Automated global news scanning software is increasingly being able to detect and prioritize disease events. SUMMARY Every year millions of travelers visit countries where they are exposed to pathogens that are usually rare in their home countries. Global surveillance of travel-related disease represents a powerful tool for the detection of infectious diseases. These data should encourage clinicians to take a detailed travel history during every patient encounter.","Marano, Cinzia; Freedman, David O",Current opinion in infectious diseases,287,16

In particular, viral RNA molecules are a key example of conformationally adapting molecules that have evolved to switch between many functional conformations. The transactivation response element (TAR) RNA from the type-1 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) is a viral RNA molecule that is being increasingly explored as a potential therapeutic target due to its role in the viral replication process. In this work, we have studied the dynamics in TAR RNA in apo and liganded states by performing explicit-solvent molecular dynamics (MD) simulations initiated with 27 distinct structures. We determined that the TAR RNA structure is significantly stabilized on ligand binding with especially decreased fluctuations in its two helices. This rigidity is further coupled with the decreased flipping of bulge nucleotides, which were observed to flip more frequently in the absence of ligands. We found that initially-distinct structures of TAR RNA converged to similar conformations on removing ligands. We also report that conformational dynamics in unliganded TAR structures leads to the formation of binding pockets capable of accommodating ligands of various sizes.","Levintov, Lev; Vashisth, Harish",Physical chemistry chemical physics : PCCP,287,16
62810,62810,62810,COVID-19 outcomes in people with cystic fibrosis.,14.58372,8.4238405,2021-11-01,"BACKGROUND Virtual reality (VR) is increasingly being used for the assessment and treatment of impairments arising from acquired brain injuries (ABIs) due to perceived benefits over traditional methods. However, no tailored options exist for the design and implementation of VR for ABI rehabilitation and, more specifically, traumatic brain injury (TBI) rehabilitation. In addition, the evidence base lacks systematic reviews of immersive VR use for TBI rehabilitation. Recommendations for this population are important because of the many complex and diverse impairments that individuals can experience. OBJECTIVE This study aims to conduct a two-part systematic review to identify and synthesize existing recommendations for designing and implementing therapeutic VR for ABI rehabilitation, including TBI, and to identify current evidence for using immersive VR for TBI assessment and treatment and to map the degree to which this literature includes recommendations for VR design and implementation. METHODS This review was guided by PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses). A comprehensive search of 11 databases and gray literature was conducted in August 2019 and repeated in June 2020. Studies were included if they met relevant search terms, were peer-reviewed, were written in English, and were published between 2009 and 2020. Studies were reviewed to determine the level of evidence and methodological quality. For the first part, qualitative data were synthesized and categorized via meta-synthesis. For the second part, findings were analyzed and synthesized descriptively owing to the heterogeneity of data extracted from the included studies. RESULTS In the first part, a total of 14 papers met the inclusion criteria. Recommendations for VR design and implementation were not specific to TBI but rather to stroke or ABI rehabilitation more broadly. The synthesis and analysis of data resulted in three key phases and nine categories of recommendations for designing and implementing VR for ABI rehabilitation. In the second part, 5 studies met the inclusion criteria. A total of 2 studies reported on VR for assessment and three for treatment. Studies were varied in terms of therapeutic targets, VR tasks, and outcome measures. VR was used to assess or treat impairments in cognition, balance, and anxiety, with positive outcomes. However, the levels of evidence, methodological quality, and inclusion of recommendations for VR design and implementation were poor. CONCLUSIONS There is limited research on the use of immersive VR for TBI rehabilitation. Few studies have been conducted, and there is limited inclusion of recommendations for therapeutic VR design and implementation. Future research in ABI rehabilitation should consider a stepwise approach to VR development, from early co-design studies with end users to larger controlled trials. A list of recommendations is offered to provide guidance and a more consistent model to advance clinical research in this area.","Brassel, Sophie; Power, Emma; Campbell, Andrew; Brunner, Melissa; Togher, Leanne",Journal of medical Internet research,287,31

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the feasibility and results of intrasaccular double microcatheter endovascular coil embolization of overwide and undertall small intracranial aneurysms. METHODS Small (<7 mm), overwide (dome-to-neck ratio [DNR] ≤1.2), and undertall (ASPECT ratio ≤1.2) aneurysms which were treated with double microcatheter technique were selected. For the double microcatheter technique, two microcatheters were selected simultaneously into the aneurysm sac and coil insertion was performed alternatingly. The initial results, ASPECT, DNR ratios, complications, and follow-up results were assessed. RESULTS Twenty small (mean, 3.8 mm), overwide (mean DNR, 1.1), and undertall (mean ASPECT, 1.0) aneurysms were treated with the double microcatheter technique. Overall, complete or near complete occlusion was achieved in 19/20 cases. This was achieved with only the double microcatheter technique in 16/20 cases (ASPECT mean, 1.0; DNR mean, 1.1). Adjuvant balloon remodeling was performed in 4/20 cases (ASPECT mean, 0.8; DNR mean, 1.1). The ASPECT ratio was significantly lower in the adjuvant balloon remodeling cases (p = 0.027). Coiling failed in one patient with both DNR and ASPECT ratio <1.0. Overall, one patient developed a focal visual field defect after the procedure. No other patients developed neurologically significant complications. CONCLUSIONS Double microcatheter technique may be a safe and effective method for the treatment of overwide and undertall small intracranial aneurysms.","Kim, Dong Joon; Kim, Byung Moon; Park, Keun Young; Ihm, Eun Hyun; Baek, Jang Hyun; Kim, Dong Ik",Acta neurochirurgica,287,16

MATERIALS AND METHODS Patients with TAAAs or pararenal aortic aneurysms who had more than 4 TVs due to renovisceral arterial anatomical variations of renal, celiac, and/or superior mesenteric arteries and received F/B-EVAR between January 2017 and September 2019 at a single aortic center were included in this study. We analyzed technical success, feasibility, and early outcomes. RESULTS Twelve patients (mean age 70±10 years, 9 males) were included. The anatomical variations included 6 right accessory renal arteries, 8 left accessory renal arteries, and 1 celiac artery variant. Stent-grafts were fenestrated, branched or combined in 6, 5, or 1 patients, respectively. The mean operating time was 346±120 minutes, the mean fluoroscopy time was 80±29 minutes, and the mean radiation dose area product was 430±219 Gy·cm2. The mean contrast volume was 129±45 mL. The total number of TVs was 64; 5 TVs in 9 patients, 6 in 2 patients, and 7 in 1 patient. Technical success was achieved in all cases. The mean intensive care unit stay was 6±5 days, and the mean total hospital stay was 14±10 days. One patient died early (30-day). Early morbidities included respiratory complication in 1 patient, renal insufficiency in 1 patient, and wound infection in 2 patients. No spinal cord ischemia, stroke, or bowel ischemia occurred. Early computed tomography angiography showed 100% patency of the bridging covered stents and TVs. The mean follow-up was 13±4.3 months. No mortality or adverse major event occurred during the follow-up. Two patients with developed type Ic endoleak related to 1 right renal artery and 1 celiac artery covered stent. Patency of the TVs during follow-up was 100%. CONCLUSION The use of F/B-EVAR for the treatment of TAAA with more than 4 TVs due to renovisceral arterial anatomical variations in our own experience is feasible and not related to increased morbidity and mortality.","Eleshra, Ahmed; Panuccio, Giuseppe; Spanos, Konstantinos; Rohlffs, Fiona; Tsilimparis, Nikolaos; Kölbel, Tilo",Journal of endovascular therapy : an official journal of the International Society of Endovascular Specialists,287,11

In addition, cognitive coping strategies can influence sensory perception. However, the role of coping strategy on acupuncture modulation of pain and sensory thresholds, and the association between acupuncture sensation and these modulatory effects, is currently unknown. METHODS Electroacupuncture (EA) was applied at acupoints ST36 and GB39 of 61 healthy adults. Different coping conditions were experimentally designed to form an active coping strategy group (AC group), who thought they could control EA stimulation intensity, and a passive coping strategy group (PC group), who did not think they had such control. Importantly, neither group was actually able to control EA stimulus intensity. Quantitative sensory testing was performed before and after EA, and consisted of vibration (VDT), mechanical (MDT), warm (WDT), and cold (CDT) detection thresholds, and pressure (PPT), mechanical (MPT), heat (HPT) and cold (CPT) pain thresholds. Autonomic measures (e.g. skin conductance response, SCR) were also acquired to quantify physiological response to EA under different coping conditions. Subjects also reported the intensity of any acupuncture-induced sensations. RESULTS Coping strategy was induced with successful blinding in 58% of AC subjects. Compared to PC, AC showed greater SCR to EA. Under AC, EA reduced PPT and CPT. In the AC group, improved pain and sensory thresholds were correlated with acupuncture sensation (VDTchange vs. MI: r=0.58, CDTchange vs. tingling: r=0.53, CPTchange vs. tingling; r=0.55, CPTchange vs. dull; r=0.55). However, in the PC group, improved sensory thresholds were negatively correlated with acupuncture sensation (CDTchange vs. intensity sensitization: r=-0.52, WDTchange vs. fullness: r=-0.57). CONCLUSIONS Our novel approach was able to successfully induce AC and PC strategies to EA stimulation. The interaction between psychological coping strategy and acupuncture sensation intensity can differentially modulate pain and sensory detection threshold response to EA. In a clinical context, our findings suggest that instructions given to the patient can significantly affect therapeutic outcomes and the relationship between acupuncture intensity and clinical response. Specifically, acupuncture analgesia can be enhanced by matching physical stimulation intensity with psychological coping strategy to acupuncture contexts.

Polyp removal using combined endolaparoscopic surgery may be an effective alternative to bowel resection in select patients. OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to evaluate short-term and long-term outcomes of patients who underwent endolaparoscopy at our institution. DATA SOURCES Medical records and a prospectively maintained database were reviewed. STUDY SELECTION This study constituted a retrospective review of consecutive patients who underwent endolaparoscopy for benign polyps from 2003 to 2012. INTERVENTIONS Combined endolaparoscopic surgery was performed. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The primary outcomes measured were success rate, rate of recurrence, rate of malignancy, length of stay, and complication rate. RESULTS A total of 75 patients were taken to the operating room with the intention of endolaparoscopy. The most common indications were large polyp size and difficult location. Based on intraoperative findings, 10 patients were suspected of having cancer and underwent immediate laparoscopic colectomy. Of 65 attempted cases, 48 patients (74%) underwent successful combined endolaparoscopic surgery. Median follow-up time was 65 (8-87) months. Patients in whom combined endolaparoscopic surgery was unsuccessful were converted to colectomy (2 open, 15 laparoscopic). Two patients were converted because of concerns of cancer and 15 because of technical difficulties. Median operative time for successful endolaparoscopy was 145 (50-249) minutes. The complication rate was 4.4% (2/48). Median length of stay was 1 (0-6) day for endolaparoscopy vs 5 (3-19) days for those converted to colectomy. Median polyp size was 3 (1.0-7.0) cm. One patient was found to have cancer on final pathology, but refused to have further surgery. Sensitivity and specificity of predicting malignancy based on clinical findings were 33% (4/12) and 98.5% (64/65). Four of 5 patients who had recurrence (10%) after endolaparoscopy had complete endoscopic polypectomy. One patient required delayed laparoscopic colectomy for a second recurrence. LIMITATIONS This study was limited by its retrospective nature. CONCLUSIONS Combined endolaparoscopic surgery appears to be a safe and effective alternative to colectomy in all parts of the colon in patients who have benign polyps not removable with colonoscopy alone.","Lee, Sang W; Garrett, Kelly A; Shin, Joong H; Trencheva, Koiana; Sonoda, Toyooki; Milsom, Jeffrey W",Diseases of the colon and rectum,287,20

OBJECTIVE To describe the characteristics of shock and myocardial injury in children with confirmed or suspeted COVID-19 during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in Spain, including clinical presentation, laboratory and imaging findings, treatment, disease course, and outcome. An extensive literature review is provided. METHODS Retrospective case series including all children (age 1 month-18 years) admitted to a pediatric intensive care unit in Madrid, Spain, between March 15 and April 30, 2020 with suspected or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and shock. RESULTS Twelve previously healthy patients with shock, age 5 to 14 years, were included. All required volume resuscitation and 75% required vasoactive/inotropic support. Distributive shock was present on admission in 67% (n = 8), and 4 patients (33%) showed features of cardiogenic shock. Myocardial injury was diagnosed in 67% (n = 8) and ventricular dysfunction in 33% (n = 4). The most common symptoms on presentation were fever (100%), anorexia (100%), diarrhea (75%), and vomiting (75%). Five patients showed signs of Kawasaki disease but none met the criteria for the classic form. Laboratory findings revealed lymphopenia (83%), thrombocytopenia (83%), and increased inflammatory markers (100%). Respiratory status was not significantly impacted. Chest X-ray showed bilateral alveolar infiltrates in 7 (58%) and bilateral pneumonia in 3 (25%). COVID-19 was confirmed in 11 cases (92%). All received empirical therapy against COVID-19, thromboprophylaxis and immunomodulation. Median stay in the PICU and inpatient ward was 4.5 and 10 days, respectively. No patients died. CONCLUSION Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children with COVID-19 can mimic Kawasaki disease and lead to a combination of distributive and cardiogenic shock, probably secondary to a hyperinflammatory state that remains to be precisely defined. Treatment strategies include hemodynamic support, empirical therapies against COVID-19, thromboprophylaxis, and immunomodulation.","Caro-Patón, Gema de Lama; de Azagra-Garde, Amelia Martínez; García-Salido, Alberto; Cabrero-Hernández, Marta; Tamariz, Amalia; Nieto-Moro, Montserrat",Journal of intensive care medicine,287,1

However, data from patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS) are sparse. METHODS Determination of PRA was made in 550 patients with ACS, including a subgroup of 287 patients not on treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers or diuretics, and without heart failure. We evaluated the relations between PRA and all-cause mortality after three years and long-term, and to cardiovascular events after median 8.7 years. Adjustments were made for variables that influenced the hazard ratio (HR) > 5% for the relation between PRA and outcome. RESULTS Baseline PRA was associated with all-cause mortality during three-years (unadjusted HR 1.74 per 1 SD increase in logarithmically transformed PRA; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.39-2.16, p < 0.0001) and long-term (HR 1.12, CI 1.00-1.25, p = 0.046). After adjustments, only the three-year association remained significant. In unadjusted analyses, PRA was associated with cardiovascular death, but not with nonfatal cardiovascular events. In the subgroup there was an inverse relation between PRA and long-term all-cause mortality. CONCLUSION Higher PRA was a significant independent predictor of all-cause mortality after three years, but not at long-term follow-up and not significantly associated with cardiovascular incidence. The renin-angiotensin-system pathophysiology is of great interest, not least due to its association with the COVID-19 pandemic. Our findings indicate a need for further research on the prognostic/predictive aspects of the renin-angiotensin-system in ACS.","Hartford, Marianne; Herlitz, Hans; Perers, Elisabeth; Karlsson, Thomas; Herlitz, Johan; Persson, Anita; Caidahl, Kenneth",International journal of cardiology,287,16

Frequency according to disease subtype varies, with serotype having particular influence in IIM, and genotype in the inherited muscle diseases. Innovative techniques for examining cardiac function have been investigated further, including speckle-tracking echocardiography and cardiac magnetic resonance tomography. The present work has highlighted a likely underestimate of the burden of cardiac disease to date. The complex relationship between IIM, atherosclerosis, and traditional cardiovascular risk factors has been further elucidated. Consensus recommendations for managing patients with inherited muscle diseases and prominent cardiac involvement have been recently published. In addition to supportive care, disease modifying treatments are increasingly becoming available for inherited muscle diseases which may also improve cardiac outcomes.

The molecular operating environment (MOE) was used to dock the identified inhibitors on the MERS-CoV helicase nucleotide binding. Strong inhibitors docked well in the nucleotide-binding site and established interactions with some of the essential residues. There was a reasonable correlation between the observed IC50 values and the MOE docking scores of the strong inhibitors (r 2 = 0.74), indicating the ability of the in silico docking model to predict the binding of strong inhibitors.

STUDY DESIGN Cadaveric and experimental study. ANIMALS Cadaveric (n=8) and healthy (n=6) adult dogs. METHODS The retroperitoneal access technique was developed in 3 cadavers based on the human technique and transperitoneal observation. Its application and working space establishment with carbon dioxide (CO2 ) insufflation alone was evaluated in 5 cadavers by observing with a transperitoneal telescope and in 6 live dogs by repeated computed tomography (CT) scans at pressure of 0, 5, 10, and 15 mmHg. Recordings of retroperitoneoscopy as well as working space volume and linear dimensions measured on CT images were analyzed. RESULTS Retroperitoneal access and working space establishment with CO2 insufflation alone were successfully performed in all 6 live dogs. The only complication observed was in 1 dog that developed subclinical pneumomediastinum. As pressure increased, working space was established from the ipsilateral to the contralateral side, and peritoneal tearing eventually developed. Working space volume increased significantly from 5 mmHg and linear dimensions increased significantly from 0 to 10 mmHg. With pneumo-retroperitoneum above 5 mmHg, retroperitoneal organs, including kidneys and adrenal glands, were easily visualized. CONCLUSION The retroperitoneal access technique and working space establishment with CO2 insufflation starting with 5 mmHg and increasing to 10 mmHg provided adequate working space and visualization of retroperitoneal organs, which may allow direct access for retroperitoneal laparoscopy in dogs.","Jeong, Junemoe; Ko, Jonghyeok; Lim, Hyunjoo; Kweon, Oh-Kyeong; Kim, Wan Hee",Veterinary surgery : VS,287,24

Methods Uncinate process tissues were obtained from 61 chronic rhinosinusitis patients (of which, 39 had allergy and 22 did not) who were infected with HRV16 using an air-liquid interface organ culture system. The expression levels of programmed cell death-ligand (PD-L)1, PD-L2, intracellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), IFN-γ, IL-4, IL-5, and IL-10 were evaluated in the infected nasal mucosa. Results The HRV infection rates were not significantly different between allergy (74.4 %) and non-allergy (72.7 %) groups. In the allergy group, the expression of PD-L1 (P=0.013) and IL-10 (P=0.040) was significantly elevated in the HRV-infected tissues; there was a strong correlation between PDL1 and IL-10 (r= 0.868, P<0.001). In contrast, infected tissues from the non-allergy group displayed increased levels of IL-4 (P=0.039), IL-5 (P=0.023), and IFN-γ (P=0.031) as well as an increased IL-4/IFN-γ ratio after HRV infection (P=0.043). Conclusion This study shows that, regardless of the presence of allergy, HRV infection rates are similar in the nasal mucosa of patients with CRS. HRV infection enhances the Th2 environment by modulating PD-L1 and PD-L2 expression levels in allergic mucosa and by increasing the IL-4/IFN-γ ratio in non-allergic mucosa.","Ko, Young-Kyung; Zhang, Yu-Lian; Wee, Jee Hye; Han, Doo Hee; Kim, Hyun Jik; Rhee, Chae-Seo",Clinical and experimental otorhinolaryngology,287,16

Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) transplantation is emerging as a promising strategy to alleviate the neuropathic pain conditions induced by peripheral nerve injury. The aim of this systematic review was to assess the efficacy and safety of MSCs transplantation in neuropathic pain induced by peripheral nerve injury in controlled animal studies, and thus to yield evidence-based decision making. Following the PRISMA guidelines, PubMED, Cochrane Central Library, Embase and CINAHL were searched for preclinical controlled animal studies from the inception to April 16th, 2020. Seventeen studies are included in this review. Substantial heterogeneity is observed regarding the animal's species, models of neuropathic pain, regimen of MSCs transplantation and outcome of measures across the included studies. Both mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia could be significantly attenuated by transplanted MSCs. The MSCs-elicited analgesic effect is independent on type of MSCs, time of administration, and route of delivery, and is efficiently enhanced by genetic transfection with fibroblast growth factor, proenkephalin and glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor. The migration of MSCs after intrathecal or intravenous injection has been shown to be directed towards the surface of dorsal spinal cord or dorsal root ganglions on the ipsilateral side of injury. No adverse effects have been reported. The accumulating evidence demonstrates the therapeutic effect of MSCs-based cell therapy on prevention and alleviation of the neuropathic pain induced by peripheral nerve injury in rat or mouse models. The robust preclinical studies are deserved to optimize the regimen of MSCs transplantation, and to promote the translation of this potentially MSCs-based therapeutic approach into clinical studies.","Wang, Qian; He, Hongchen; Xie, Shuhang; Wei, Quan; He, Chengqi",Stem cells and development,287,27

METHODS Fever characteristics were analyzed in 584 consecutive patients with aSAH. Fever was defined as core body temperature ≥38.3 °C on ≥2 consecutive days. Subfebrile measurements were those between 37 and 38.2 °C. Febrile and subfebrile loads were the number of hours with fever or subfebrile measurements, respectively. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression models were developed to define predictors of outcome using various categorizations of fever cause, severity, and duration. RESULTS Febrile measurements were observed in 281/584 (48.1 %) patients, recurring over a mean duration of 2.1 ± 3.0 days. Early fever within 24 and 72 h was encountered in 69 (11.9 %) and 110 (18.9 %) of patients, respectively. An infectious source was discovered in 126 (44.8 %) febrile patients. On univariate analysis, days of fever, febrile load, and fever onset within 24 and 72 h were associated with poor outcome (all p < 0.001); but subfebrile load was not (p = 0.56). On multivariate model constructed with all variables associated with outcome on univariate analyses, days of fever remained independently associated with poor outcome (OR 1.14 of poor outcome per day of fever, 95 % CI 1.06-1.22; p = 0.0006) displacing all other fever measures from the final model. CONCLUSIONS Early onset of fever, number of hours with fever, and especially days of fever are associated with poor functional outcome. Conversely, subfebrile load does not influence clinical outcome. These data suggest prolonged fever should be avoided, but subfebrile temperatures may not justify intervention.","Kramer, Christopher L; Pegoli, Marianna; Mandrekar, Jay; Lanzino, Giuseppe; Rabinstein, Alejandro A",Neurocritical care,287,1

For an optimal management of COVID-19 (Coronary Virus Disease) we depend on a fast and reliable diagnosis and severity assessment. The gold standard so far is RT-PCR (reverse transcriptase polmerase chain reaction) from the nasopharyngeal smear. Current tests have a sensitivity of 60-90 %. As a consequence, we must expect 10-40 % false negative results. In addition to oxygen saturation for severity classification, stethoscope, chest X-ray and lung computer tomography are routinely used. However, the standard methods stethoscope and chest X-ray are unreliable. Moreover, all three diagnostic examination techniques expose physicians, support staff and subsequent patients to an additional risk of exposure. In view of the contagiousness of SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Corona Virus), lung point-of-care ultrasound (Lu-PoCUS) is a still underutilized valuable alternative, especially when using pocket devices. In this review the current value and role of stethoscope, pulsoxymetry, chest x ray, lung computer tomography and lung point-of-care ultrasound will be determined based on the available literature.","Osterwalder, Joseph",Praxis,287,8

Accurate leakage monitoring is however necessary. This study aimed to verify the accuracy of radionuclide leakage monitoring in patients undergoing ILuP, by comparing this method with serial blood sampling. METHODS A total of 15 consecutive ILuP procedures were performed on eleven patients affected by lung metastases from soft tissue sarcoma. After establishing isolated perfusion, erythrocytes of systemic blood (SB) were labelled with 0.2 MBq/kg of 99mTc. The baseline SB counting rate (CR) was assessed using a γ-probe. Subsequently, erythrocytes of the circuit blood (CB) were labelled with 2 Mbq/kg of 99mTc. Radioactivity leakage factor (RLF) was continuously measured using a formula, accounting for CR, systemic/circuit activity ratio and total/systemic volume ratio. The TNF-α concentration in SB and CB was measured by enzymelinked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) throughout the procedure. RESULTS RLF averaged 2.3 ± 1.5%, while the systemic/circuit TNF-α ratio was 0.05 ± 0.12%. These two indices were strictly correlated in all of the procedures (average Rvalue 0.88 ± 0.07). RLF exceeded 5% during three of 15 procedures, prompting the application of compensatory manoeuvres. ELISA confirmed a marked increase in systemic TNF-α levels in these patients (2.6 ± 3.5 ng/ml). Conversely, patients whose RLF did not exceed the 5% threshold presented a mean TNF-α of 0.02 ± 0.005 ng/ml (p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS In patients submitted to ILuP, RLF monitoring is feasible and accurate. Moreover, it grants immediate results, permitting for the adoption of corrective manoeuvres for leakage, thus minimising toxicity.","Fiz, Francesco; Villa, Giuseppe; Ferrari, Enrico; Pomposelli, Elena; Morbelli, Silvia; Alloisio, Antonella; Pende, Daniela; Meazza, Raffaella; Gereloni, Cristina; Marini, Cecilia; Ratto, Giovanni Battista; Sambuceti, Gianmario","International journal of hyperthermia : the official journal of European Society for Hyperthermic Oncology, North American Hyperthermia Group",287,16

Planners anticipated the possibility of a pandemic involving high mortality, high health care demands, rates of absenteeism rising up to 20-30% among health care workers, rationing of health care, and extraordinary psychological stress. METHOD The intervention we describe emerged from the recognition that an expected influenza pandemic indicated a need to build resilience to maintain the health of individuals within the organization and to protect the capacity of the organization to respond to extraordinary demands. Training sessions were one component of a multifaceted approach to reducing stress through effective preparation and served as an evidence based platform for our hospital's response to the H1N1 pandemic. RESULTS The training was delivered to more than 1250 hospital staff representing more than 22 departments within the hospital. The proportion of participants who felt better able to cope after the session (76%) was significantly higher than the proportion who felt prepared to deal confidently with the pandemic before the session (35%). Ten key themes emerged from our qualitative analysis of written comments, including family-work balance, antiviral prophylaxis, and mistrust or fear towards health care workers. CONCLUSIONS Drawing on what we learned from the impact of SARS on our hospital, we had the opportunity to improve our organization's preparedness for the pandemic. Our results suggest that an evidence-based approach to interventions that target known mediators of distress and meet standards of continuing professional development is not only possible and relevant, but readily supportable by senior hospital administration.","Aiello, Andria; Khayeri, Michelle Young-Eun; Raja, Shreyshree; Peladeau, Nathalie; Romano, Donna; Leszcz, Molyn; Maunder, Robert G; Rose, Marci; Adam, Mary Anne; Pain, Clare; Moore, Andrea; Savage, Diane; Schulman, Rabbi Bernard",The Journal of continuing education in the health professions,287,1

Little is known about the clinical characteristics of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection in the high-altitude region of China. We reported the clinical characteristics of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Gansu province, China. METHODS In this retrospective study, patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were consecutively enrolled from January 21, 2020 to February 11, 2020. The information on the epidemiological, clinical characteristics, laboratory tests, radiological features on admission, treatment and outcome were obtained with the final follow-up of March 13, 2020. On the basis of the median length of hospital stay, patients were further analyzed in two groups (long- vs. short-hospital stay). RESULTS Of the 86 patients of COVID-19 in 11 cities of Gansu Province, the median hospital stay was 14.0 days (interquartile rang, 11.0-19.0 days). In the overall cohort, the median age was 41.0 years (interquartile rang, 31.0-54.3 years), and 48 (55.8%) patients were female. Forty (46.5%) had a history of exposure to epidemic regions, but none exposed to the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan. Common symptoms included fever (41, 47.7%), and cough (37, 43.0%). On admission, 30 (34.9%) and 58 (67.4%) patients had leukopenia and lymphopenia. According to chest CT scans, 53 (66.3%) of 80 patients showed bilateral pneumonia, and 19 (23.8%) of 80 patients showed unilateral pneumonia. Of the 15 asymptomatic cases, 10 (66.6%) cases were found CT findings of pneumonia. Besides, there were 65 (75.6%) patients with mild and moderate type of COVID-19.

This study compared the impact of vascular pedicle ligation method on the number of retrieved lymph nodes in patients undergoing laparoscopic right hemicolectomy for cancer. Mesenteric root dissection with individualized vessel ligation was compared to en bloc vascular root stapling. METHODS Data were retrospectively collected from a database of patients' charts including operative and pathological reports. All patients that underwent laparoscopic colectomy in a single department were identified. Patients that underwent elective laparoscopic right hemicolectomy for cancer were further evaluated. The impact of the method used for ileo-colic vascular transection, age, gender, nodes status, T stage, BMI and the operating surgeon on the number of retrieved lymph nodes was studied. RESULTS Among 239 laparoscopic colectomies, 75 patients underwent elective laparoscopic right colectomy for cancer. Ileo-colic vascular transection was routinely performed at the level of the inferior border of the pancreas. In total, 34 patients underwent ileo-colic vascular root dissection with individualized vessel ligation and 41 underwent vascular root stapling. No difference was found in the mean number of retrieved lymph nodes between pedicle dissection and vascular root stapling (18.7 ± 5.9 vs. 19.6 ± 7.9, P = 0.396), and in the rate of patients who had 12 nodes or more (97.1 vs. 92.7 %, P = 0.401). BMI above 30 was associated with decreased number of retrieved nodes (P = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS No difference was found in the number of retrieved lymph nodes between ileo-colic vascular root dissection with individual vessel ligation and vascular root stapling in patients undergoing laparoscopic right hemicolectomy for cancer. High BMI was associated with decreased number of retrieved nodes in both groups. A standard approach regarding the level of mesenteric root transection, regardless of the ligation approach, leads to adequate lymph node harvesting by different surgeons.","Kent, Ilan; Rudnicki, Yaron; Abu-Ghanem, Yasmin; White, Ian; Spitz, Baruch; Avital, Shmuel",Surgical endoscopy,287,24

TLR2 gene knockout (TLR2KO) mice have been widely used for animal models of neurological diseases. Since there is close relationship between immune system and neurobehavioral functions, it is important to clarify the exact role of TLR2 defect itself in neurobehavioral functions. The present study aimed to investigate the effect of TLR2KO on neurobehavioral functions in mice and the mechanisms underlying the observed changes. METHODS Male TLR2KO and wild type (WT) mice aged 3, 7, and 12 months were used for neurobehavioral testing and detection of protein expression by Western blot. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), electrophysiological recording, and Evans blue (EB) assay were applied to evaluate regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF), synaptic function, and blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity in 12-month-old TLR2KO and age-matched WT mice. RESULTS Compared to WT mice, TLR2KO mice showed decreased cognitive function and locomotor activity, as well as increased anxiety, which developed from middle age (before 7-month-old) to old age. In addition, significantly reduced regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF), inhibited long-term potentiation (LTP), and increased blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability were observed in 12-month-old TLR2KO mice. Furthermore, compared with age-matched WT mice, significant reduction in protein levels of tight junction proteins (ZO-1, Occludin and Claudin5) and increased neurofilament protein (SMI32) were observed in 7 and 12-month-old TLR2KO mice, and that myelin basic protein (MBP) decreased in 12-month-old TLR2KO mice. CONCLUSION Our data demonstrated that TLR2 defect resulted in significantly observable neurobehavioral dysfunctions in mice starting from middle age, as well as multiple abnormalities in brain structure, function, and molecular metabolism.","Hu, Yuting; Sun, Xiaoyu; Wang, Shang; Zhou, Chao; Lin, Li; Ding, Xiaohui; Han, Jingjing; Zhou, Yan; Jin, Guoliang; Wang, Yuqiao; Zhang, Wei; Shi, Hongjuan; Zhang, Zuohui; Yang, Xinxin; Hua, Fang","Brain, behavior, and immunity",287,26

This study performed contrast-enhanced high-resolution cone beam CT (CE-HRCBCT) during deployment of the stent retriever to observe the interaction between the strut and intraluminal thrombus intraoperatively. We also discuss the mechanism by which the thrombus is retrieved. METHODS In 11 patients, mechanical thrombectomy was performed with a Solitaire stent retriever. The presence or absence of flow restoration (FR) was evaluated immediately and at least 5 min after deployment. Stent retriever findings on CE-HRCBCT were divided into two groups: (1) complete expansion; and (2) incomplete expansion. RESULTS FR was observed in all 11 cases (100%) immediately after deployment of the Solitaire stent retriever. Complete expansion was observed in only one case and incomplete expansion was observed in 10 cases. The thrombus was observed mainly near to or outside the strut of the stent retriever by CE-HRCBCT. Loss of FR was seen in only one of the 11 cases. Regardless of this, successful recanalization was achieved with only the stent retriever in nine cases. CONCLUSIONS CE-HRCBCT showed that the Solitaire stent retriever rarely expanded fully and the thrombus was mainly near to or outside the strut. It may not be necessary to wait a long time to allow the stent to expand fully into the thrombus because the main capture mechanism seems to be engagement of the clot between the crossings of the struts of the Solitaire.","Tsumoto, Tomoyuki; Tsurusaki, Yuichiro; Tokunaga, So",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,287,1

The push for telemedicine during the COVID-19 pandemic has challenged the face-to-face rounding paradigm and creates an opportunity for reflection on the benefits of telemedicine, especially for balancing competing corporate and clinical demands. METHODS The 117-month video-based inpatient telerounding experience of a colorectal surgeon in an academic medical system was recorded, including patient characteristics, diagnoses, technology, content of telerounding encounters, and logistical considerations. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics. RESULTS 163 patients were seen in 201 telerounding encounters, primarily for routine postoperative care (90.5%). Most were admitted for inflammatory bowel disease (63.2%). Changes were made to plans of care during 28.9% of encounters, and discharge planning was part of 26.4%. Encounters were conducted primarily from the surgeon's administrative office (68.7%) or other work-related locations (10.9%), while 6.5% originated from the surgeon's home.

STUDY DESIGN Subjects with spastic CP (n = 19; 4-20 years of age; Gross Motor Function Classification System Expanded and Revised [GMFCS-E&R] levels I-V) participated in this cohort study. Energy-expenditure and muscle activity were measured during lying supine, sitting with support, sitting without support, and standing. Energy-expenditure was measured using indirect calorimetry and expressed in metabolic equivalents (METs). Muscle activation was recorded using surface electromyography. The recorded values were calculated for every child and then averaged per posture. RESULTS Mean energy expenditure was >1.5 METs during standing for all GMFCS-E&R levels. There was a nonsignificant trend for greater muscle activation for all postures with less support. Only for children classified at GMFCS-E&R level III did standing result in significantly greater muscle activation (P < .05) compared with rest. CONCLUSIONS Across all GMFCS-E&R levels, children and adolescents with CP had elevated energy expenditure during standing that exceeded the sedentary threshold of 1.5 METs. Our findings suggest that changing a child's position to standing may contribute to the accumulation of light activity and reduction of long intervals of sedentary behavior.","Verschuren, Olaf; Peterson, Mark D; Leferink, Svenja; Darrah, Johanna",The Journal of pediatrics,287,31

Cough and apnea are common findings in pertussis and also in bronchiolitis, the most common cause of hospitalization in U.S. infants. The objective was to determine the prevalence of B. pertussis infection in children hospitalized with bronchiolitis and to describe its clinical course. METHODS Children hospitalized with bronchiolitis and age <2 years were eligible for a prospective, multicenter cohort study during 3 consecutive winter seasons (November-March) from 2007 to 2010. Sixteen sites in 12 states participated using a standardized enrollment protocol. Families were asked the 2010 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention pertussis classification questions. Nasopharyngeal aspirates were obtained and tested by real-time polymerase chain reaction for 16 viruses, Mycoplasma pneumoniae and B. pertussis. RESULTS Two thousand sixty-eight (94%) of 2207 children had 1 or more respiratory pathogens. B. pertussis was identified in 4 children [0.2%; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.1-0.5%] with 3 having a viral co-infection. All 4 were younger than 4 months; 2 met the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention definition of probable pertussis; and 3 had received at least 1 dose of an acellular pertussis vaccine. During the hospitalization, 2 had paroxysmal cough, 1 required intensive care unit care and the median length of stay was 13 days. CONCLUSIONS Our data support that B. pertussis is an uncommon pathogen in U.S. children hospitalized with bronchiolitis in the winter. Making a diagnosis of pertussis can be challenging because the disease can be atypical and may not meet the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention definition of probable infection.","Piedra, Pedro A; Mansbach, Jonathan M; Jewell, Alan M; Thakar, Sneha D; Grant, Cameron C; Sullivan, Ashley F; Espinola, Janice A; Camargo, Carlos A",The Pediatric infectious disease journal,287,1

However, the association between both entities has been suggested through case reports in immunocompetent patients. CASE REPORT We present the case of an immunocompetent 26-year-old man presenting with fever, adynamia, retrosternal pain, and dysphagia. Endoscopy was performed, showing whitish lesions in circular plates with erosions, and in some depressed areas in the middle and distal esophagus. Biopsies showed the presence of ulcerated foci covered by fibrinoleukocyte exudate in granulation tissue and nuclear inclusions with a viral appearance. The immunohistochemical study for herpes simplex virus (HSV) was positive. The patient was treated symptomatically and progressed favorably. The endoscopic control carried out at 3 months showed longitudinal grooves and trachealization, findings compatible with the diagnosis of eosinophilic esophagitis and with biopsies that confirmed the etiology by showing an increase in eosinophil count >20 per field, without isolating HSV. CONCLUSIONS This clinical case confirms the possible relationship between esophagitis caused by HSV and eosinophilic esophagitis. Alterations at the immune level and damage to the esophageal mucosa barrier may explain this relationship. In this scenario, an endoscopic follow-up should be considered.","Quera, Rodrigo; Sassaki, Ligia Yukie; Nuñez, Paulina; Contreras, Luis; Bay, Constanza; Flores, Lilian",The American journal of case reports,287,16

It is currently unclear whether and why this ""behavioral immune system"" targets unfamiliar individuals more than familiar ones. Here I answer this question in humans, using publicly available data of a recent study on 1969 participants from India and 1615 from the USA. The apparent health of a male stranger, as estimated from his face, and the comfort with contact with him were a direct function of his similarity to the men in the local community. This held true regardless of whether the face carried overt signs of infection. I conclude that our behavioral immune system is finely tuned to degrees of outgroupness - and that cues of outgroupness are partly processed as cues of infectiousness. These findings, which were consistent across the two cultures, support the notion that the pathogens of strangers are perceived as more dangerous.","Bressan, Paola","BioEssays : news and reviews in molecular, cellular and developmental biology",287,8

Cytokine measurement was performed 2 days post-challenge in cell extracts of the small intestine and 2, 7, and 14 days post-challenge in serum. Virulence gene allele type of these strains was analyzed. Challenged mice survived by avoiding exacerbated inflammation and inhibiting the overproduction of cytokines. Local and systemic cytokine response in challenged mice was similar to chronic controls and quite distinct in mice acutely infected with the EGS or CH3 strains. Allelic combinations of the virulence genes ROP5/ROP18 was predictive of virulence in mice when tested in these T. gondii strains.

METHODS A preliminary design process yielded optimal high-resistance proximal ventricular catheters with a ""scaled"" design and parallel-oriented, U-shaped inlets. Prototypes were manually constructed using carving tools to stamp through silicone tubings. A testing apparatus was developed to simulate cerebrospinal fluid flow through a catheter, and the prototypes were tested against a control catheter for exhibition of an ""on/off"" phenomenon whereby no flow occurs at low pressures, and flow begins beyond a pressure threshold. Flow distribution was visualized with India ink. Regression analysis was performed to determine linearity. RESULTS The new designs showed varying amounts of improved flow control with the ""scaled"" design showing the most practical flow rate control across various pressures, compared to the standard catheter; however, no true ""on/off"" phenomenon was observed. The ""scaled"" design showed various degrees of dynamism; its flow rate can be time dependent, and certain maneuvers such as flushing and bending increased flow rate temporarily. Variation in the number of inlets within each ""scaled"" prototype also affected flow rate. Contrastingly, the flow rate of standard catheters was found to be independent of the number of inlet holes. Ink flow showed even flow distribution in ""scaled"" prototypes. CONCLUSIONS This initial feasibility study showed that high-resistance ventricular catheters can be designed to mimic the current/valved system. The ""scaled"" design demonstrated the best flow control, and its unique features were characterized.","Qi, David; Olson, Elsa; Ivankovic, Sven; Sommer, Taylor; Nair, Kalyani; Morris, Martin; Lin, Julian",Child's nervous system : ChNS : official journal of the International Society for Pediatric Neurosurgery,287,1

It is demonstrated that the viscosity equation can be simplified to a four-parameter version: η(T) = A·T·exp(Hm/RT)]·[1 + C·exp(Hd/RT)]. The Sheffield model gives a correct description of viscosity, with two exact Arrhenius-type asymptotes below and above the glass transition temperature, whereas near the Tg it gives practically the same results as well-known and widely used viscosity equations. It is revealed that the constants of the Sheffield equation are not universal for all temperature ranges and may need to be updated for very high temperatures, where changes occur in melt properties leading to modifications of A and Hm for both salol and α-phenyl-o-cresol.","Ojovan, Michael I",Molecules,287,16

The presence of specific estrogen receptors is required for estrogen to have its characteristic ubiquitous action in almost all tissues. Estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) and estrogen receptor beta (ERβ) are the major isoforms of estrogen that are highly specific in humans and enable selective hormonal actions in different tissues. This article reviews some of the observed estrogen actions and effects in different tissues and cells through these specific receptors.

The success rate and prognostic factors for complete treatment were analysed. MATERIAL/METHODS The medical records of all patients who had undergone curatively intended thermal ablation of bone metastases between September 2001 and February 2012 were retrospectively analysed. The goal was to achieve complete treatment of all bone metastases in patients with oligometastatic disease (group 1) or only of bone metastases that could potentially lead to skeletal-related events in patients with a long life expectancy (group 2). We report the rate of complete treatment according to patient characteristics, primary tumour site, bone metastasis characteristics, radiofrequency ablation/cryotherapy and the treatment group (group 1/group 2). RESULTS Eighty-nine consecutive patients had undergone curatively intended thermal ablation of 122 bone metastases. The median follow-up was 22.8 months [IQR = 12.2-44.4]. In the intent-to-treat analysis, the 1-year complete treatment rate was 67% (95%CI: 50%-76%). In the multivariate analysis the favourable prognostic factors for complete local treatment were oligometastatic status (p = 0.02), metachronous (p = 0.004) and small-sized (p = 0.001) bone metastases, without cortical bone erosion (p = 0.01) or neurological structures in the vicinity (p = 0.002). CONCLUSION Thermal ablation should be included in the therapeutic arsenal for the cure of bone metastases. KEY POINTS • Thermal ablation techniques are currently performed to palliate pain caused by bone metastases. • In selected patients, thermal ablation can also be indicated with a curative intent. • Oligometastatic and/or metachronous diseases are good prognostic factors for local success. • Small-size (<2 cm) bone metastases and no cortical erosion are good prognostic factors.","Deschamps, F; Farouil, G; Ternes, N; Gaudin, A; Hakime, A; Tselikas, L; Teriitehau, C; Baudin, E; Auperin, A; de Baere, T",European radiology,287,1

MATERIAL AND METHODS Charts of all women who had pelvic venography for PVI from September 2013 to August 2014 were reviewed. The procedure was performed under local anesthesia through left femoral approach. In case of reflux without associated obstructive lesions, embolization with coils and polidocanol foam was performed during the same procedure. RESULTS 119 women, with median age 39 years were explored (86 with PCS and 102 with lower limb venous disease). Of these, 78 had an isolated reflux and were embolized and 41 had an obstructive disease (29 iliocaval obstructive lesions (ICOL), 4 nutcracker syndrome (NCS), and 8 with an association of both). Median follow-up was 4 months. Of the 12 NCS, 5 had surgical treatment and 7 had stenting of the left iliac vein without embolization. All patients with ICOL without NCS were treated by stenting in 28 and by a Palma procedure in 1 (failure to recanalize). Primary and secondary patency rates were 97% at 12 months. Embolization led to improvement of PCS in 91% (60% without any pain) and of lower limb varicose veins in 51% by itself. If 82% need an additional treatment of lower limb varicose veins, embolization allowed a switch of strategy from surgery to sclerosis. CONCLUSION PVI can cause lower limb symptoms. In most cases, it is due to reflux and can be treated under local anesthesia by embolization. This technique is safe and efficient. Obstructive lesions must be recognized and treated.","Hartung, O",Phlebology,287,5

The hypothesis was that capillary transit time heterogeneity in selected brain regions is greater during phenylephrine than during ephedrine, thus reducing cerebral oxygen tension. METHODS In this single-center, double-blinded, randomized clinical trial, 24 anesthetized brain tumor patients were randomly assigned to ephedrine or phenylephrine. Magnetic resonance imaging of peritumoral and contralateral hemispheres was performed before and during vasopressor infusion. The primary endpoint was between-group difference in capillary transit time heterogeneity. Secondary endpoints included changes in cerebral blood flow, estimated oxygen extraction fraction, and brain tissue oxygen tension. RESULTS Data from 20 patients showed that mean (± SD) capillary transit time heterogeneity in the contralateral hemisphere increased during phenylephrine from 3.0 ± 0.5 to 3.2 ± 0.7 s and decreased during ephedrine from 3.1 ± 0.8 to 2.7 ± 0.7 s (difference phenylephrine versus difference ephedrine [95% CI], -0.6 [-0.9 to -0.2] s; P = 0.004). In the peritumoral region, the mean capillary transit time heterogeneity increased during phenylephrine from 4.1 ± 0.7 to 4.3 ± 0.8 s and decreased during ephedrine from 3.5 ± 0.9 to 3.3 ± 0.9 s (difference phenylephrine versus difference ephedrine [95%CI], -0.4[-0.9 to 0.1] s; P = 0.130). Cerebral blood flow (contralateral hemisphere ratio difference [95% CI], 0.3 [0.06 to 0.54]; P = 0.018; and peritumoral ratio difference [95% CI], 0.3 [0.06 to 0.54; P = 0.018) and estimated brain tissue oxygen tension (contralateral hemisphere ratio difference [95% CI], 0.34 [0.09 to 0.59]; P = 0.001; and peritumoral ratio difference [95% CI], 0.33 [0.09 to 0.57]; P = 0.010) were greater during ephedrine than phenylephrine in both regions. CONCLUSIONS Phenylephrine caused microcirculation in contralateral tissue, measured by the change in capillary transit time heterogeneity, to deteriorate compared with ephedrine, despite reaching similar mean arterial pressure endpoints. Ephedrine improved cerebral blood flow and tissue oxygenation in both brain regions and may be superior to phenylephrine in improving cerebral macro- and microscopic hemodynamics and oxygenation.

All studies demonstrated a positive association; in adults (Odds Ratio/Risk Ratio range: 1.8-8.1) and children (Odds Ratio/Risk Ratio range: 1.9-6.8). Studies were limited by moderate or serious risk of confounding bias, exposure misclassification, and protopathic biases and sparse data bias. The results of this review demonstrate that published studies on the effect of NSAIDs use and risk of pneumonia complications are subject to a number of biases. These results should not be extrapolated as evidence of harm for NSAIDs, including ibuprofen, in respiratory ailments but highlight the need for more methodologically robust studies to evaluate this potential relationship.","Sodhi, Mohit; Khosrow-Khavar, Farzin; FitzGerald, J Mark; Etminan, Mahyar",Pharmacotherapy,287,30

Since the main route of infection with SARS-CoV-2 is probably via contact with virus-containing droplets of the exhaled air, any method of securing the airway is of extremely high risk for the health care professionals involved. We evaluated the aerosol exposure to the interventional team during a tracheotomy in a semi-quantitative fashion. In addition, we present novel protective measures. MATERIALS AND METHODS To visualize the air movements occurring during a tracheotomy, we used a breathing simulator filled with artificial fog. Normal breathing and coughing were simulated under surgery. The speed of aerosol propagation and particle density in the direct visual field of the surgeon were evaluated. RESULTS Laminar air flow (LAF) in the OR reduced significantly the aerosol exposure during tracheostomy. Only 4.8 ± 3.4% of the aerosol was in contact with the surgeon. Without LAF, however, the aerosol density in the inspiratory area of the surgeon is ten times higher (47.9 ± 10.8%, p < 0.01). Coughing through the opened trachea exposed the surgeon within 400ms with 76.0 ± 8.0% of the aerosol - independent of the function of the LAF. Only when a blocked tube was inserted into the airway, no aerosol leakage could be detected. DISCUSSION Coughing and expiration during a surgical tracheotomy expose the surgical team considerably to airway aerosols. This is potentially associated with an increased risk for employees being infected by airborne transmitted pathogens. Laminar airflow in an operating room leads to a significant reduction in the aerosol exposure of the surgeon and is therefore preferable to a bedside tracheotomy in terms of infection prevention. Ideal protection of medical staff is achieved when the procedure is performed under endotracheal intubation and muscle relaxation.","Loth, Andreas German; Guderian, Daniela Brigitta; Haake, Birgit; Zacharowski, Kai; Stöver, Timo; Leinung, Martin",Shock,287,23

Artificial intelligence (AI) with its capability to objectively identify, localize and quantify fluid introduces fully automated tools into OCT imaging for personalized disease management. Deep learning performance has already proven superior to human experts, including physicians and certified readers, in terms of accuracy and speed. Reproducible measurement of retinal fluid relies on precise AI-based segmentation methods that assign a label to each OCT voxel denoting its fluid type such as intraretinal fluid (IRF) and subretinal fluid (SRF) or pigment epithelial detachment (PED) and its location within the central 1-, 3- and 6-mm macular area. Such reliable analysis is most relevant to reflect differences in pathophysiological mechanisms and impacts on retinal function, and the dynamics of fluid resolution during therapy with different regimens and substances. Yet, an in-depth understanding of the mode of action of supervised and unsupervised learning, the functionality of a convolutional neural net (CNN) and various network architectures is needed. Greater insight regarding adequate methods for performance, validation assessment, and device- and scanning-pattern-dependent variations is necessary to empower ophthalmologists to become qualified AI users. Fluid/function correlation can lead to a better definition of valid fluid variables relevant for optimal outcomes on an individual and a population level. AI-based fluid analysis opens the way for precision medicine in real-world practice of the leading retinal diseases of modern times.","Schmidt-Erfurth, Ursula; Reiter, Gregor S; Riedl, Sophie; Seeböck, Philipp; Vogl, Wolf-Dieter; Blodi, Barbara A; Domalpally, Amitha; Fawzi, Amani; Jia, Yali; Sarraf, David; Bogunovic, Hrvoje",Progress in retinal and eye research,287,1

However, the prevalence and characteristics of anemia in older individuals are not fully understood, and national data on these aspects in older Korean adults are lacking. This study aimed to evaluate the prevalence and characteristics of anemia in older adults using data from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES), which is a nationwide cross-sectional epidemiological study conducted by the Korean Ministry of Health and Welfare. METHODS Data from a total of 62,825 participants of the 2007-2016 KNHANES were compiled and analyzed to investigate differences in participant characteristics and potential risk factors for anemia. Differences in clinical characteristics of participants were compared across subgroups using the chi-square test for categorical variables and independent t-test for continuous variables. Univariate and multivariate analyses using logistic regression were performed to identify related clinical factors. RESULTS The prevalence of anemia was higher in the population aged ≥65 years than in the younger population. Anemia was also more prevalent among females than among males, but this difference was not significant in people aged > 85 years. Being underweight, receiving a social allowance, living alone, and having comorbidities such as hypertension, rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes mellitus (DM), cancer, and chronic renal failure (CRF) were more common among older adults with anemia than among the population without anemia. In univariate and multivariate analyses, older age, female sex, underweight, and presence of comorbidities including rheumatoid arthritis, DM, cancer, and CRF were associated with an increased risk of anemia. CONCLUSIONS This study revealed that age, female sex, underweight, and the presence of comorbidities such as rheumatoid arthritis, DM, cancer, and CRF were associated with an increased risk of anemia in older Korean adults. Further study on causal relationships between anemia and other variables in the older population is necessary.","Chueh, Hee Won; Jung, Hye Lim; Shim, Ye Jee; Choi, Hyoung Soo; Han, Jin Yeong",BMC geriatrics,287,31

Although the treatment of BPPV is relatively successful, many patients suffer recurrence after treatment. Therefore, identifying potential risk factors for BPPV recurrence may help improve treatment outcome and patient prognosis. However, some related risk factors for BPPV recurrence are relatively controversial and poorly studied. This meta-analysis aims to identify potential risk factors associated with BPPV recurrence, thereby reducing the recurrence rate of BPPV and improving the prognosis of patients. METHODS This meta-analysis was conducted through systematically searching PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library for eligible English original studies published up to June 2020. All search results were reviewed based on our inclusion and exclusion criteria. We calculated the pooled odds ratios (ORs) or the mean differences (MDs) with their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to evaluate the effects of included risk factors on BPPV recurrence. RESULTS A total of 14 studies involving 3060 BPPV patients published between 2010 and 2019 were finally included, including six prospective studies and eight retrospective studies, with a NOS score ranged from 6 to 9. Our pooled results of this meta-analysis suggested that the recurrence of BPPV was closely related to female gender (OR = 1.42; 95% CI 1.17-1.74; P = 0.0004), hypertension (OR = 2.61; 95% CI 1.22-5.59; P = 0.01), diabetes mellitus (OR = 2.62; 95% CI 1.25-5.48; P = 0.01), hyperlipidemia (OR = 1.60; 95% CI 1.23-2.09; P = 0.0006), osteoporosis (OR = 1.72; 95% CI 1.03-2.88; P = 0.04) and vitamin D deficiency (MD = - 3.29; 95% CI - 5.32 to - 1.26; P = 0.001). CONCLUSION This meta-analysis indicated that female gender, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, osteoporosis, and vitamin D deficiency were risk factors for BPPV recurrence. However, the effects of other potential risk factors including advanced age, migraine, head trauma, and Menière's disease on BPPV recurrence need further investigations. Furthermore, most studies included in this meta-analysis were performed in Asia, so our results cannot easily be extended to the whole world population. Therefore, more large-scale prospective studies in different countries are required to further investigate these risk factors.","Chen, Jinbao; Zhang, Senlin; Cui, Kai; Liu, Chuxuan",Journal of neurology,287,7

COVID-19 is not only a critical threat for the population with risk factors, but also generates a dramatic economic impact in terms of morbidity and the overall interruption of economic activities. AREAS COVERED Advanced materials are the basis of several technologies that could diminish the impact of COVID-19: biosensors might allow early virus detection, nanosized vaccines are powerful agents that could prevent viral infections, and nanosystems with antiviral activity could bind the virus for inactivation or destruction upon application of an external stimulus. Herein all these methods are discussed under the light of cutting-edge technologies and the previously reported prototypes targeting enveloped viruses similar to SARS-CoV-2. This analysis was derived from an extensive scientific literature search (including pubmed) performed on April 2020. EXPERT OPINION Perspectives on how biosensors, vaccines, and antiviral nanosystems can be implemented to fight COVID-19 are envisioned; identifying the approaches that can be implemented in the short term and those that deserve long term research to cope with respiratory viruses-related pandemics in the future.","Palestino, Gabriela; García-Silva, Ileana; González-Ortega, Omar; Rosales-Mendoza, Sergio",Expert review of anti-infective therapy,287,1

All E proteins have conserved cysteine residues located on the carboxy side of the long hydrophobic domain, suggesting functional significance. In this study, we confirmed that mouse hepatitis coronavirus A59 E protein is palmitoylated. To understand the role of the conserved residues and the necessity of palmitoylation, three cysteines at positions 40, 44, and 47 were changed singly and in various combinations to alanine. Double- and triple-mutant E proteins resulted in decreased virus-like particle output when coexpressed with the membrane (M) protein. Mutant E proteins were also studied in the context of a full-length infectious clone. Single-substitution viruses exhibited growth characteristics virtually identical to those of the wild-type virus, while the double-substitution mutations gave rise to viruses with less robust growth phenotypes indicated by smaller plaques and decreased virus yields. In contrast, replacement of all three cysteines resulted in crippled virus with significantly reduced yields. Triple-mutant viruses did not exhibit impairment in entry. Mutant E proteins localized properly in infected cells. A comparison of intracellular and extracellular virus yields suggested that release is only slightly impaired. E protein lacking all three cysteines exhibited an increased rate of degradation compared to that of the wild-type protein, suggesting that palmitoylation is important for the stability of the protein. Altogether, the results indicate that the conserved cysteines and presumably palmitoylation are functionally important for virus production.","Lopez, Lisa A; Riffle, Ambere J; Pike, Steven L; Gardner, Douglas; Hogue, Brenda G",Journal of virology,287,1

MATERIALS AND METHODS A straight and a curved blade laparoscopic ultrasonic dissector were activated on tissue and in a liquid environment to evaluate plume emission. Plume emission was characterized as either laminar or turbulent and the plume settlement times were compared. Devices were then placed in liquid to observed consistency in the fluid disruption. RESULTS Two types of plume emission were identified generating different directions of plume: laminar flow causes minimal visual obstruction by directing the aerosol downwards, while turbulent flow directs plume erratically across the cavity. Laminar plume dissipates immediately while turbulent plume reaches a second maximum obstruction approximately 0.3 s after activation and clears after 2 s. Turbulent plume was observed with the straight blade in 10 % of activations, and from the curved blade in 47 % of activations. The straight blade emitted less obstructive plume. CONCLUSION Turbulent flow is disruptive to laparoscopic visibility with greater field obstruction and requires longer settling than laminar plume. Ultrasonic dissectors with straight blades have more consistent oscillations and generate more laminar flow compared with curved blades. Surgeons may avoid laparoscope smearing from maximum plume generation depending on blade geometry.","Kim, Fernando J; Sehrt, David; Pompeo, Alexandre; Molina, Wilson R",Surgical endoscopy,287,17

The complete manuscript is available on OrthoGuidelines (www.orthoguidelines.org) and the Musculoskeletal Tumor Society website (www.msts.org). This clinical practice guideline is designed to assist practitioners without specialization in musculoskeletal tumors to determine the most efficacious imaging modalities for establishing an accurate diagnosis and treatment plan when confronted with a bone or soft-tissue lesion of unknown etiology. A panel of experts with interest and expertise in orthopaedic surgery, orthopaedic oncology, and musculoskeletal radiology created relevant questions and synthesized existing literature into 12 topics and 27 recommendations. The group considered several common clinical and radiographic features often seen at the initial presentation of a bone or soft-tissue tumor of the pelvis or extremities. This guideline is intended to inform front-line practitioners to give insight into imaging modalities that are of minimal clinical utility, as well as those that are critical to establishing an accurate diagnosis and assessing the urgency of referral to an oncologic specialist. In addition to a summary of the primary findings of the report, we included three cases that illustrate clinical scenarios in which the guidelines can assist in determining the most appropriate first-line management. The strengths of the relevant guidelines are noted.","Miller, Benjamin J",The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons,287,8

Using a prototype analysis (a bottom-up approach collecting laypeople's views on hope), the present research defines hope and provides insights into its associations with other related constructs. Study 1 identified a list of features of hope derived from characteristics generated by laypeople in the Netherlands and the United States when asked to think about hope. Study 2 determined the centrality of each of these features of hope, where the most frequently mentioned features were classified as ""central features,"" whereas the less frequently as ""peripheral features."" Studies 3-5 then tested the validity of this classification and showed that central features (compared with peripheral ones) were more often recalled and recognized (Study 3), were classified as a feature of hope more quickly (Study 4), and were more representative in autobiographical situations involving hope (Study 5). Our findings are in part consistent with the definitions of hope reported in previous literature, and suggest in addition that some features deserve more attention than before. Based on our findings and previous literature, we propose the following core elements of hope: belief, positive, future, desire, and possibility. Accordingly, we propose the working definition that hope is a belief that a positive future outcome is possible combined with a desire for that outcome. As our research provides a more nuanced understanding of hope and its associations with other related constructs, we hope the current findings will contribute to future research on this important topic.

First-line management involves intravenous antibiotics, with surgical or endovascular management reserved for cases of failed medical treatment or aneurysmal rupture. Endovascular therapy has become the primary approach for treating these small, distally located aneurysms. Liquid embolic agents are well suited for use because of their ability to fill the aneurysm and parent vessel. We present our experience in treating these aneurysms via Onyx embolization and review the literature. METHODS We retrospectively reviewed the endovascular treatment of IIAs at our institution from 2010 to 2012. Eight patients with 16 IIAs ranging in size from 1 to 16 mm underwent treatment. Seven of the patients initially presented after aneurysmal rupture. Onyx was pushed until the aneurysm and parent artery were filled.

Our genome-wide CRISPR-based screen harnessed the capacity of herpesvirus mutants that trigger antiviral necroptotic cell death upon early viral gene expression. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and semaphorin-binding receptor Neuropilin-1 (Nrp-1) emerge as crucial determinants of MCMV infection. We find that elimination of Nrp-1 impairs early viral gene expression and reduces infection rates in endothelial cells, fibroblasts, and macrophages. Furthermore, preincubation of virus with soluble Nrp-1 dramatically inhibits infection by reducing virus attachment. Thus, Nrp-1 is a key determinant of the initial phase of MCMV infection.","Lane, Rebecca K; Guo, Hongyan; Fisher, Amanda D; Diep, Jonathan; Lai, Zhao; Chen, Yidong; Upton, Jason W; Carette, Jan; Mocarski, Edward S; Kaiser, William J",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,287,19

In the past decade, maternal vaccination has emerged as a promising public health strategy to prevent and combat maternal, fetal and neonatal infections. Despite a number of universally recommended maternal vaccines, the development and evaluation of safe and effective maternal vaccines and their wide acceptance are hampered by the lack of thorough understanding of the efficacy and safety in the pregnant women and the offspring. METHODS An outline was synthesized based on the current status and major gaps in the knowledge of maternal vaccination. A systematic literature search in PUBMED was undertaken using the key words in each section title of the outline to retrieve articles relevant to pregnancy. Articles cited were selected based on relevance and quality. On the basis of the reviewed information, a perspective on the future directions of maternal vaccination research was formulated. RESULTS Maternal vaccination can generate active immune protection in the mother and elicit systemic immunoglobulin G (IgG) and mucosal IgG, IgA and IgM responses to confer neonatal protection. The maternal immune system undergoes significant modulation during pregnancy, which influences responsiveness to vaccines. Significant gaps exist in our knowledge of the efficacy and safety of maternal vaccines, and no maternal vaccines against a large number of old and emerging pathogens are available. Public acceptance of maternal vaccination has been low. CONCLUSIONS To tackle the scientific challenges of maternal vaccination and to provide the public with informed vaccination choices, scientists and clinicians in different disciplines must work closely and have a mechanistic understanding of the systemic, reproductive and mammary mucosal immune responses to vaccines. The use of animal models should be coupled with human studies in an iterative manner for maternal vaccine experimentation, evaluation and optimization. Systems biology approaches should be adopted to improve the speed, accuracy and safety of maternal vaccine targeting.","Faucette, Azure N; Unger, Benjamin L; Gonik, Bernard; Chen, Kang",Human reproduction update,287,17

This test has been validated mostly in hospital settings. Here we have evaluated Fever-7 to identify the presence of respiratory viral infections in a Community Health Center. METHODS A prospective study was conducted in the ""Servicio de Urgencias de Atención Primaria"" in Salamanca, Spain. Patients with clinical signs of respiratory infection and at least one point in the National Early Warning Score were recruited. Fever-7 mRNAs were profiled on a Nanostring nCounter® SPRINT instrument from blood collected upon patient enrolment. Viral diagnosis was performed on nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs) using the Biofire-RP2 panel. RESULTS A respiratory virus was detected in the NPAs of 66 of the 100 patients enrolled. Median National Early Warning Score was 7 in the group with no virus detected and 6.5 in the group with a respiratory viral infection (P > .05). The Fever-7 score yielded an overall AUC of 0.81 to predict a positive viral syndromic test. The optimal operating point for the Fever-7 score yielded a sensitivity of 82% with a specificity of 71%. Multivariate analysis showed that Fever-7 was a robust marker of viral infection independently of age, sex, major comorbidities and disease severity at presentation (OR [CI95%], 3.73 [2.14-6.51], P < .001).

CF is caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene which encodes a protein of the same name. Protein dysfunction results in abnormal chloride and bicarbonate transport in mucus membranes, including those in the respiratory, gastrointestinal and reproductive tracts. Abnormal anion transport causes viscous secretions at the site of involvement. The majority of people with CF succumb to respiratory failure following recurrent cycles of infection and inflammation in the airways. Historically, providers treated the signs and symptoms of CF, but since 2012, have been able to impact the basic defect for the subset of people with CF who have mutations that respond to the new class of drugs, CFTR protein modulators. With the improved health and longevity afforded by CFTR modulators, more women are interested in parenthood and are becoming pregnant. Furthermore, this class of drugs likely increases fertility in women with CF. However, the safety of CFTR modulators in pregnancy and lactation is only beginning to be established.

The advent of reverse genetics technology, cell-culture production techniques and novel adjuvants has improved the vaccine strain preparation, production process and immunogenicity of the vaccines, respectively, and has accelerated the availability of pandemic influenza vaccines. However, there is still room for improvement, and alternative vaccine preparations can be explored, such as viral vectors. Modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA), originally developed as a safe smallpox vaccine, can be exploited as a viral vector and has many favourable properties. Recently, we have demonstrated that an MVA-based vaccine could protect mice and macaques against infection with highly pathogenic influenza viruses of the H5N1 subtype. In the present study, recombinant MVA expressing the haemagglutinin (HA) gene of pandemic influenza A/H1N1 virus was evaluated in the ferret model. A single immunization induced modest antibody responses and afforded only modest protection against the development of severe disease upon infection with a 2009(H1N1) strain. In contrast, two immunizations induced robust antibody responses and protected ferrets from developing severe disease, confirming that MVA is an attractive influenza vaccine production platform.","Kreijtz, Joost H C M; Süzer, Yasemin; Bodewes, Rogier; Schwantes, Astrid; van Amerongen, Geert; Verburgh, R Joyce; de Mutsert, Gerrie; van den Brand, Judith; van Trierum, Stella E; Kuiken, Thijs; Fouchier, Ron A M; Osterhaus, Albert D M E; Sutter, Gerd; Rimmelzwaan, Guus F",The Journal of general virology,287,23

It is well known that growth factors have the potential to enhance/accelerate tissue regeneration, however their poor stability which results in rapid loss of their activity, together with their rapid clearance from defected tissues (when applied as free molecules) is a serious drawback for their use; their highly hydrophilic nature and low capability to permeate through biological barriers (cell membranes) are additional factors that limit their applicability. In the last years, the advantages of liposomal drug delivery systems have motivated efforts to deliver growth factors (GFs) in liposomal form. Herein, after briefly introducing the basic structural characteristics of liposome types and their advantages when used as drug carriers, as well as the basic problems encountered when GFs are applied for tissue regeneration, we focus on recent reports about development and potential regenerative effects of liposomal GFs, towards defects of various tissues. The methodologies used for incorporation, attachment or immobilization of liposomal GFs in order to sustain their retention at the defected tissues, are highlighted as well.","Natsaridis, E; Mouzoura, P; Gkartziou, F; Marazioti, A; Antimisiaris, S G",The International journal of developmental biology,287,24

Objective We present our early experience with the use of LIGASURE vessel sealing system for the procedure of thyroidectomy. Materials and Methods This was a quasi-experimental study comparing outcome of LigaSure thyroidectomy in a prospective nonrandomized cohort with another retrospective cohort of preintervention clamp-and-tie thyroidectomy. Results A total of 30 patients with a clinical diagnosis of goiter were recruited into the study. There were two males and 28 females with a mean age of 42.6 years. Diagnosis was simple multinodular goiter 24 (80%), controlled toxic nodular goiter 3 (10%), grave disease 1 (3.3%), and multinodular goiter with retrosternal extension 2 (6.7%). The mean thyroid weight was 121.0 g. The mean duration of surgery was 59 min compared to 128 min for traditional technique (P < 0.01).

Particular attention has focused on interleukin-6 (IL-6) and its correlation with psychotic symptom severity. Cannabis use is associated with an increased risk of psychosis and also has immunomodulating properties. It has been hypothesized that inflammatory disturbances are a common underlying pathology between cannabis use and psychosis. We measured inflammatory markers in individuals admitted to a psychiatric unit with acute psychosis who had toxicology positive for natural and/or synthetic cannabinoids (n = 59) compared to patients with negative cannabinoid toxicology (n = 60). Psychosis severity was assessed using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). While PANSS scores were similar between groups, cannabinoid-positive participants were more likely to receive pro re nata (PRN or as-needed) medications for agitation in the psychiatric emergency room, particularly synthetic cannabinoid-positive participants. In unadjusted models, cannabinoid-positive participants had lower interferon-γ (IFN-γ) levels (p = 0.046), but this finding was not significant after adjusting for covariates and multiple comparisons. Among cannabinoid-positive participants, IL-6 levels negatively correlated with PANSS total score (p = 0.040), as well as positive (p = 0.035) and negative (p = 0.024) subscales. Results suggest inflammatory alterations among psychotic individuals with comorbid cannabinoid use.","Gibson, Claire L; Bassir Nia, Anahita; Spriggs, Sharron A; DeFrancisco, Daniel; Swift, Amy; Perkel, Charles; Zhong, Xiaobo; Mazumdar, Madhu; Fernandez, Nicolas; Patel, Manishkumar; Kim-Schulze, Seunghee; Hurd, Yasmin L",Psychiatry research,287,19

The objective of this study was to describe the fluid challenge techniques reported in fluid responsiveness studies and to assess the difference in the proportion of 'responders,' (PR) depending on the type of fluid, volume, duration of infusion and timing of assessment. METHODS Searches of MEDLINE and Embase were performed for studies using the fluid challenge as a test of cardiac preload with a description of the technique, a reported definition of fluid responsiveness and PR. The primary outcome was the mean PR, depending on volume of fluid, type of fluids, rate of infusion and time of assessment. RESULTS A total of 85 studies (3601 patients) were included in the analysis. The PR were 54.4% (95% CI 46.9-62.7) where <500 ml was administered, 57.2% (95% CI 52.9-61.0) where 500 ml was administered and 60.5% (95% CI 35.9-79.2) where >500 ml was administered (p = 0.71). The PR was not affected by type of fluid. The PR was similar among patients administered a fluid challenge for <15 minutes (59.2%, 95% CI 54.2-64.1) and for 15-30 minutes (57.7%, 95% CI 52.4-62.4, p = 1). Where the infusion time was ≥30 minutes, there was a lower PR of 49.9% (95% CI 45.6-54, p = 0.04). Response was assessed at the end of fluid challenge, between 1 and 10 minutes, and >10 minutes after the fluid challenge. The proportions of responders were 53.9%, 57.7% and 52.3%, respectively (p = 0.47). CONCLUSIONS The PR decreases with a long infusion time. A standard technique for fluid challenge is desirable.","Toscani, Laura; Aya, Hollmann D; Antonakaki, Dimitra; Bastoni, Davide; Watson, Ximena; Arulkumaran, Nish; Rhodes, Andrew; Cecconi, Maurizio",Critical care,287,1

Cerebral (rSO2-C) and abdominal (rSO2-A) NIRS sensors were used during transport in air ambulance and connecting ground ambulance. Data were electronically stored by the monitor during transport, extracted and analyzed off-line after the transport. After removal of all zero and floor effect values, the Savitzky-Golay algorithm of data smoothing was applied on the NIRS-signal. The second order of smoothing polynomial was used and the optimal number of neighboring points for the smoothing procedure was evaluated. NIRS-data from 38 pediatric patients was examined. Reliability, defined as measurements without values of 0 or 15%, was acceptable during transport (> 90% of all measurements). There were, however, individual patients with < 90% reliable measurements during transport, while no patient was found to have < 90% reliable measurements in hospital. Satisfactory noise reduction of the signal, without distortion of the underlying information, was achieved when 20-50 neighbors (""window-size"") were used. The use of NIRS for measuring rSO2 in clinical studies during pediatric transport in ground and air-ambulance is feasible but hampered by unreliable values and signal interference. By applying the Savitzky-Golay algorithm, the signal-to-noise ratio was improved and enabled better post-hoc signal evaluation.","Hamrin, Tova Hannegård; Radell, Peter J; Fläring, Urban; Berner, Jonas; Eksborg, Staffan",Journal of clinical monitoring and computing,287,31

Although engagement in physical activity through sport is recognized as cardioprotective, an estimated one-quarter of deaths in American football players are associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD), predominately in players classified as obese. Purpose To systematically investigate the cardiovascular health profile of retired field-based athletes. Study Design Systematic review; Level of evidence, 4. Methods This review was conducted and reported in accordance with the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines and preregistered with PROSPERO. Four databases (PubMed, CINAHL, Embase, and Web of Science) were systematically searched from inception to October 2018 using MeSH terms and keywords. Inclusion criteria were retired field-based athletes, age >18 years, and at least 1 CVD risk factor according to the European Society of Cardiology and the American Heart Association. Review articles were not included. Control groups were not required for inclusion, but when available, an analysis was included. Eligible articles were extracted using Covidence. Methodological quality was assessed independently by 2 reviewers using the AXIS tool. The accuracy of individual study estimates was analyzed using a random-effects meta-analysis. Results This review yielded 13 studies. A total of 4350 male retired field-based athletes from 2 sports (football and soccer; age range, 42.2-66 years) were included. Eight studies compared retired athletes with control groups. Retired athletes had elevated systolic blood pressure in 4 of 6 studies; approximately 50% of studies found greater high-density lipoprotein, approximately 80% found lower triglyceride levels, and all studies found greater low-density lipoprotein for retired athletes compared with controls. The prevalence and severity of coronary artery calcium and carotid artery plaque were similar to controls. Retired linemen had double the prevalence of cardiometabolic syndrome compared with nonlinemen. Conclusion The overall findings were mixed. Inconsistencies in the reporting of CVD risk factors and methodological biases reduced the study quality. Retired athletes had a comparable CVD risk profile with the general population. Retired athletes with an elevated body mass index had an increased prevalence and severity of risk factors. Significant gaps remain in understanding the long-term cardiovascular effects of elite athleticism.","McHugh, Cliodhna; Hind, Karen; Davey, Daniel; Wilson, Fiona",Orthopaedic journal of sports medicine,287,1

Here, we aim to explicitly estimate the protective effect of case isolation, reconstructing the time events of onset of illness and hospitalization as well as the transmission network. We show that case isolation reduced the reproduction number and shortened the serial interval. Employing Bayesian inference with the Markov chain Monte Carlo method for parameter estimation and assuming that the reproduction number exponentially declines over time, the protective effect of case isolation was estimated to be 39.7% (95% credible interval: 2.4%-82.1%). The individual protective effect of case isolation was also estimated, showing that the effectiveness was dependent on the speed, i.e. the time from onset of illness to hospitalization.","Chan, Yat Hin; Nishiura, Hiroshi","Journal of the Royal Society, Interface",287,33

The usual treatment of hypercapnia is to increase ventilation. During the recent surge of COVID-19, respiratory acidosis unresponsive to increased mechanical ventilatory support was common. Increasing mechanical ventilation comes at the expense of barotrauma and hemodynamic compromise from increasing positive end-expiratory pressures or minute ventilation. Treating acute respiratory acidemia with sodium bicarbonate remains controversial. RECENT FINDINGS There are no randomized controlled trials of administration of sodium bicarbonate for respiratory acidemia. A recent review concluded that alkali therapy for mixed respiratory and metabolic acidosis might be useful but was based on the conflicting and not conclusive literature regarding metabolic acidosis. This strategy should not be extrapolated to treatment of respiratory acidemia. Low tidal volume ventilation in acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) has beneficial effects associated with permissive hypercapnia. Whether the putative benefits will be negated by administration of alkali is not known. Hypercapnic acidosis is well tolerated, with few adverse effects as long as tissue perfusion and oxygenation are maintained. SUMMARY There is a lack of clinical evidence that administration of sodium bicarbonate for respiratory acidosis has a net benefit; in fact, there are potential risks associated with it.","Chand, Ranjeeta; Swenson, Erik R; Goldfarb, David S",Current opinion in nephrology and hypertension,287,16

Minimally invasive laparoscopic resection has been used recently in liver surgery for treating selected hepatic hemangiomas. However, laparoscopic liver surgery poses the significant technical challenges and high rate of conversion. Radiofrequency (RF) ablation has been proved feasible in the treatment of hepatic hemangiomas with a size range of 5.0-9.9 cm. It is controversial to treat giant hepatic hemangiomas (≥10.0 cm) by means of RF ablation, due to the low technique success rate and high incidence of ablation-related complications. We aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of combined laparoscopic resection with intratumoral RF-induced coagulation for giant hepatic hemangiomas. METHODS We treated 2 patients with giant subcapsular hepatic hemangioma (12.0 cm and 13.1 cm in diameters respectively) by laparoscopic resection following intratumoral coagulation of the tumor with RF ablation. RESULTS Blood loss during resection was 100 ml (case 1) and 300ml (case 2) respectively. No blood transfusion and dialysis were needed during perioperative period. The two patients were discharged 6 days (case 1) and 12 days (case 2) after surgery without any complications, respectively. Postoperative contrast-enhanced CT follow up showed there was no residual tumor. CONCLUSIONS It is feasible to treat giant subcapsular hepatic hemangioma by laparoscopic tumor resection boosted by intratumoral coagulation using RF ablation, which may open a new avenue for treating giant hemangioma.","Wang, Shaohong; Gao, Jun; Yang, Mengmeng; Ke, Shan; Ding, Xuemei; Kong, Jian; Xu, Li; Sun, Wenbing",Oncotarget,287,0

This study examines factors associated with PrEP awareness and willingness, and identifies perceived barriers to PrEP among PWID. Methods: PWID were interviewed in Los Angeles and San Francisco, CA from 2016 to 2018. We analyzed data from self-reported HIV-negative participants who had injected drugs within the past 6 months (n = 469). Questions on PrEP included awareness, willingness, barriers, and uptake. Multiple logistic regression models of factors associated with awareness of, and willingness to, take PrEP were developed. Descriptive statistics on perceived PrEP barriers are reported. Results: Among HIV-negative PWID, 40% were aware of PrEP, 59% reported willingness to take PrEP, and 2% were currently taking PrEP. In multivariable analysis, PrEP awareness was associated with study site and sexual minority status, higher educational attainment, and HIV testing in the last 6 months. Willingness to take PrEP was associated with self-reported risk (paying sex partner in the last 6 months, sharing drug paraphernalia, and being injected by another PWID) and perceived HIV risk. The most common perceived barriers to PrEP were copays, concerns about increased HIV or sexually transmitted risk with PrEP, and concerns about reduction of medication efficacy without daily use. Conclusion: PrEP awareness among PWID remains inadequate. Willingness to take PrEP was moderate and was most desired by PWID who engaged in high-risk behaviors. Interventions to increase PrEP awareness and willingness, and to facilitate PrEP uptake among PWID are needed.","Walters, Suzan M; Kral, Alex H; Simpson, Kelsey A; Wenger, Lynn; Bluthenthal, Ricky N",Substance use & misuse,287,1

METHODS Women with ovarian cancer diagnosed before the age of 35 years and/or with a suggestive personal or family history of Lynch syndrome cancers underwent tumour testing with immunohistochemistry for mismatch repair deficiency and, where indicated, MLH1 promoter methylation testing followed by constitutional testing for Lynch syndrome. RESULTS In total, 261 ovarian cancers were tested and 27 (10.3%; 95% CI 6.9% to 14.7%) showed mismatch repair deficiency by immunohistochemistry. Three of 7 with MLH1 loss showed MLH1 promoter hypermethylation, and 18 of the remaining 24 underwent constitutional testing for Lynch syndrome. A further 15 women with mismatch repair proficient tumours underwent constitutional testing because of a strong family history of Lynch syndrome cancers. Pathogenic variants were identified in 9/33 (27%) women who underwent constitutional testing, aged 33-59 years (median 48 years), including one whose tumour was mismatch repair proficient. Most Lynch syndrome tumours were of endometrioid histological subtype.

Previous analyses have focused on specific regions, such as EU, OECD, provinces of China. This paper fills this gap, providing new evidence on the convergence process of RES for the 176 countries that account for more than 98% of the world population, from 1990 to 2018. A common panel data set has been used to take into account countries' specific effects. Several socio-economics and political variables are introduced to test conditional convergence such as openness to trade, developments in financial markets, income distribution, level of education. The results of this new contribution reveal that there is evidence of sigma-absolute and conditional beta-convergence process for several groups of countries. Moreover, the conditional convergence analysis shows that spatial spillover effects exert rich and complex impact on convergence speed. Finally, we provide policy recommendations, highlighting that the decarbonization target in 2050 needs additional mobilization of public and private resources to pursue a common, convergence path worldwide.","Bigerna, Simona; Bollino, Carlo Andrea; Polinori, Paolo",Journal of environmental management,287,1

In patients with known or suspected risk factors for gastrointestinal stenosis, the PillCam patency capsule (PC) is given before a video capsule endoscopy (VCE) in order to minimize the risk of capsule retention (CR). CR is considered unlikely upon excretion of the PC within 30 hours, excretion in an undamaged state after 30 hours, or radiological projection to the colon. Methods. We performed a retrospective analysis of 38 patients with risk factors for CR, who received a PC from 02/2013 to 04/2015 at Klinikum Augsburg. Results. Sixteen of our 38 patients observed a natural excretion after a mean time of 34 hours past ingestion. However, only 8 patients observed excretion within 30 hours, as recommended by the company. In 20 patients passage of the PC into the colon was shown via RFID-scan or radiological imaging (after 33 and 45 hours, resp.). Only 2 patients showed a pathologic PC result. In consequence, 32 patients received the VCE; no CR was observed. Conclusion. Our data indicates that a VCE could safely be performed even if the PC excretion time is longer than 30 hours and the excreted PC was not screened for damage.","Römmele, C; Brueckner, J; Messmann, H; Gölder, S K",Gastroenterology research and practice,287,5

One such approach is laparoendoscopic single-site surgery (LESS), which can also be applied for transvesical surgery. The aim of the study was to present our initial clinical experience of using this technique for transvesical vesicovaginal fistula (VVF) repair. In August 2011, we carried out the LESS repair of a 3-mm in diameter vesicovaginal fistula on a 72-year-old woman, who failed the conservative treatment with Foley placement. The procedure was performed transvesically (percutaneous intraluminal approach) with a single-port device (4-channel, TriPort+, Olympus Winter&IBE GMBH) via a 1.5-cm incision made 2 cm above the pubic symphysis. A standard 10-mm optic and straight laparoscopic instruments were used. The fistulous tract was dissected and partially excised. The bladder and vaginal wall defects were closed in two layers with running absorbable V-Loc (Covidien, Norwalk, CT, USA) suture. Ureteral catheters were left for 5 days and the Foley catheter for 14 days. The operative time was 170 min. The blood loss was minimal. No complications were observed. The postoperative period was uneventful. During a 6-month follow-up the patient reported no involuntary discharge of urine into the vagina. Diagnostic scans revealed no presence of VVF and laboratory examination results were all within the normal range. Although substantial development of the instruments and skills is needed, the transvesical LESS vesicovaginal fistula repair appeared to be feasible and safe. Nevertheless, further experience and observations are necessary.","Roslan, Marek; Markuszewski, Marcin M; Bagińska, Joanna; Krajka, Kazimierz",Wideochirurgia i inne techniki maloinwazyjne = Videosurgery and other miniinvasive techniques,287,7

Excessive food intake is the main behavioural determinant of obesity; therefore, a better understanding of food reward and its relationship with food intake and weight outcomes could contribute to more effective weight management solutions. METHODS This systematic review assessed the role of changes in food reward (directly or indirectly measured) during weight management interventions. Four databases were searched for articles published until April 2018 involving weight management interventions (all types and designs) in healthy adults with overweight or obesity. RESULTS Of 239 full-text articles assessed, 17 longitudinal studies were included. Twelve studies reported a significant change in food reward over time. When compared with control interventions, dietary, pharmacological, behavioural and cognitive interventions were effective in decreasing liking and/or wanting for high-energy food using a range of methodologies to assess food reward. Three studies reported that decreased food reward was associated with improved weight management outcomes. CONCLUSION Food reward appears to decrease rather than increase during weight management interventions. Future studies specifically targeting the hedonic aspects of food intake (liking/wanting) are needed to gain a better understanding of how to uncouple the obesogenic relationship between food reward and overeating.","Oustric, P; Gibbons, C; Beaulieu, K; Blundell, J; Finlayson, G",Obesity reviews : an official journal of the International Association for the Study of Obesity,287,1

White Leghorn specific-pathogen-free chickens were immunized with EV71 antigens and a specific isolated immunoglobulin (IgY) was prepared from the chicken egg yolk. IgY was further purified and characterized by SDS-PAGE, ELISA, western blotting and bidirectional immune agar diffusion testing. The antiviral activity and dose-response of the IgY were determined by assessing the cytopathic effect in rhabdomyosarcoma (RD) cells in vitro. It was indicated that the levels of IgY were increased at day 7, peaked at week 7 and were maintained at a higher level for 4 weeks following immunization when compared with the negative control. The results of western blotting and bidirectional immune agar diffusion testing revealed that the IgY had cross-binding properties in EV71 and CVA16 strains through targeting the envelope proteins (VP0, VP1 and VP3) of EV71 and CVA16. Neutralization assay results indicated that the infectivity of EV71 and CVA16 strains in RD cells was cross-blocked by IgY in a dose-dependent manner. To conclude, these findings indicate that IgY has cross antiviral activity against EV71 and CVA16 in vitro, and could potentially be developed as a passive immunotherapy for EV71- and CVA16-induced HFMD.","Gao, Enyi; Wu, Shuwen; Xu, Qing; Zeng, Yonglian; Tan, Ning; He, Songqing; Yang, Yang; Wei, Jingchen",Experimental and therapeutic medicine,287,1

We assess how health varied for hospitality workers due to the lockdown (i.e., comparing health a month before to a month after), employment change (i.e., comparing those with loss vs. no change), and employee response (i.e., more job threat vs. more personal recovery). Comparing pre- and post-lockdown surveys of 137 U.S. and U.K. hospitality employees, psychological health (i.e., negative and positive affect) worsened but physical health (i.e., symptoms and sleep) improved. We proposed those facing work loss (66% had reduced hours, furloughs, or layoffs) had more job threat but also more personal recovery (i.e., relaxation, mastery, exercise), resulting in opposing pathways to health. Results from a path analysis showed that work loss indirectly linked to higher psychological distress due to job threat, but to lower distress and fewer physical symptoms due to relaxation. Regardless of work loss, mastery (e.g., hobbies) was related to immediate changes in positive affect and sleep, while exercise did not have short-term health benefits. Further, recovery benefits from work loss were short-lived; only job threat carried the effect to psychological distress 2 months later. We offer quotes from the hospitality workers to contextualize the blessing and curse of work loss during the lockdown for these particularly vulnerable employees.

Accurate detection of infection with SARS-CoV-2 is an essential component of efforts to treat individual patients and to contain spread of the virus in the community. The purpose of this review is to describe current diagnostic modalities for SARS-CoV-2 and outline their use. Special considerations for pediatric age groups are included. RECENT FINDINGS RNA PCR from the upper respiratory tract remains the gold standard for detection of infection with SARS-CoV-2. Antigen testing is being widely deployed as a faster and more convenient alternative to PCR, but is less sensitive and should only be used for diagnosis early after symptom onset. Serologic assays can document prior infection and are helpful in diagnosing multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children. Serologic testing should not be used to diagnose acute or active infection. Immune assays are likely to provide a useful measure of protection against COVID19 in the future as knowledge of protective responses improves. SUMMARY A variety of SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics have recently been developed and deployed. Clinicians should understand the appropriate use and interpretation of RNA PCR, antigen testing and immune assays for SARS-CoV-2 in order to diagnose and treat patients in this evolving pandemic.","Spearman, Paul",Current opinion in pediatrics,287,5

Current FDA approved inhibitors (Vemurafenib, Dabrafenib, Encorafenib) although improved progression-free survival of mtBRAF melanoma patients suffer from this treatment related side effect. mtBRAF Colorectal Cancer (CRC) is resistant to the approved BRAF inhibitors, although combinatorial treatment co-targeting BRAF and EGFR/MEK is offering a promising prospect. In an effort to explore the potential of the novel BRAF inhibitors-PB to impede CRC cell proliferation, they were tested on RKO, HT29 and Colo-205 cells, bearing the BRAFV600E mutation. This study shows that the BRAF paradox breakers PLX7904 and PLX8394 cause a more prolonged MAPK pathway inhibition and achieve a stronger blockage of proliferation and reduced viability than PLX4720, the sister compound of Vemurafenib. In some treatment conditions, cells can undergo apoptosis. Genomic analysis on the more resistant RKO cells treated with PLX7904, PLX8394 and PLX4720 showed similar gene expression pattern, but the alterations imposed by the PB were more intense. Bioinformatic analysis resulted in a short list of genes representing potential master regulators of the cellular response to BRAF inhibitors' treatments. From our results, it is clear that the BRAF paradox breakers present a notable differential regulation of major pathways, like MAPK signalling, apoptosis, cell cycle, or developmental signalling pathways. Combinatorial treatments of BRAFi with Mcl-1 and Notch modulators show a better effect than mono-treatments.

This study aims to investigate the effect of bismuth-based treatment (BBT) combined with proton pump inhibitor (PPI) on wall thicknesses measured in the postoperative gastric specimen and early postoperative complications in patients with Hp-positive pre-LSG endoscopic gastric biopsies. MATERIALS AND METHODS The patients who underwent LSG procedure for morbid obesity were divided into three groups as follows: Hp-negative, Hp-positive without eradication treatment, and Hp-positive, and LSG was performed after eradication treatment. Macroscopic and microscopic gastric wall thickness measurements were made at a distance of 1 cm from the proximal surgical margin, from the middle part of the specimen, and 1 cm from the distal surgical margin in the gastric specimen and the results were compared. RESULTS A total of 132 patients were included in the study, 44 patients in each group. Microscopically measured antrum mucosal thickness was found to be statistically significantly higher in group 2 compared to other groups (groups 1.15, 1.35, 1.16 mm, respectively, p = 0.000). There was no difference between the groups in terms of early complications such as bleeding, wound site infection, or leakage from the staple line within the first 28 days after surgery. CONCLUSION This study found that LSG had no effect on early complications due to Hp positivity or eradication of Hp. KEY POINTS • The presence of HP increases the wall thickness of the gastric antrum mucosa. • After HP eradication, stomach antrum wall thickness returns to normal. • HP eradication before LSG reduces the wall thickness of the gastric antrum mucosa. • It was determined that HP scanning and eradication before LSG had no effect on postoperative complications.","Ergin, Anıl; Çiyiltepe, Hüseyin; Karip, Aziz Bora; Fersahoğlu, Mehmet Mahir; Bulut, Nuriye Esen; Çakmak, Ahmet; Topaloğlu, Berk; Bilgili, Ali Cihan; Somay, Adnan; Taşdelen, İksan; Akyüz, Ümit; Memişoğlu, Kemal",Obesity surgery,287,23

VP56, a putative fibrin inlaying the outer surface of GCRV-II and GCRV-III, is involved in cell attachment. In the present study, we found that VP56 localizes at the early endosome, lysosome, and endoplasmic reticulum, recruits the cytoplasmic viral RNA sensor retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) and binds to it. The interaction between VP56 and RIG-I was detected by endogenous coimmunoprecipitation (co-IP), glutathione S-transferase (GST) pulldown, and subsequent liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and was then confirmed by traditional co-IPs and a novel far-red mNeptune-based bimolecular fluorescence complementation system. VP56 binds to the helicase domain of RIG-I. VP56 enhances K48-linked ubiquitination of RIG-I to degrade it by the proteasomal pathway. Thus, VP56 impedes the initial immune function of RIG-I by dual mechanisms (blockade and degradation) and attenuates signaling from RIG-I recognizing viral RNA, subsequently weakening downstream signaling transduction and interferon (IFN) responses. Accordingly, host antiviral effectors are reduced, and cytopathic effects are increased. These findings were corroborated by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and VP56 knockdown. Finally, we found that VP56 and the major outer capsid protein VP4 bind together in the cytosol to enhance the degradation of RIG-I and more efficiently facilitate viral replication. Collectively, the results indicated that VP56 allies VP4, recruits, blocks, and degrades RIG-I, thereby attenuating IFNs and antiviral effectors to facilitate viral evasion more effectively. This study reveals a virus attacking target and an escaping strategy from host antiviral immunity for GCRV and will help understand mechanisms of infection of reoviruses. IMPORTANCE Grass carp reovirus (GCRV) fibrin VP56 and major outer capsid protein VP4 inlay and locate on the outer surface of GCRV-II and GCRV-III, which causes tremendous loss in grass carp and black carp industries. Fibrin is involved in cell attachment and plays an important role in reovirus infection. The present study identified the interaction proteins of VP56 and found that VP56 and VP4 bind to the different domains of the viral RNA sensor retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) in grass carp to block RIG-I sensing of viral RNA and induce RIG-I degradation by the proteasomal pathway to attenuate signaling transduction, thereby suppressing interferons (IFNs) and antiviral effectors, facilitating viral replication. VP56 and VP4 bind together in the cytosol to more efficiently facilitate viral evasion. This study reveals a virus attacking a target and an escaping strategy from host antiviral immunity for GCRV and will be helpful in understanding the mechanisms of infection of reoviruses.","Su, Hang; Liao, Zhiwei; Yang, Chunrong; Zhang, Yongan; Su, Jianguo",Microbiology spectrum,287,27

MATERIALS AND METHODS In a retrospective study from May 2010 to June 2011, 75 men (150 pelvic sides) underwent pelvic CT angiography and selective pelvic DSA before PA embolization for BPH. Each pelvic side was evaluated regarding the number of independent PAs and their origin, trajectory, termination, and anastomoses with adjacent arteries. RESULTS A total of 57% of pelvic sides (n = 86) had only one PA, and 43% (n = 64) had two independent PAs identified (mean PA diameter, 1.6 mm ± 0.3). PAs originated from the internal pudendal artery in 34.1% of pelvic sides (n = 73), from a common trunk with the superior vesical artery in 20.1% (n = 43), from the anterior common gluteal-pudendal trunk in 17.8% (n = 38), from the obturator artery in 12.6% (n = 27), and from a common trunk with rectal branches in 8.4% (n = 18). In 57% of pelvic sides (n = 86), anastomoses to adjacent arteries were documented. There were 30 pelvic sides (20%) with accessory pudendal arteries in close relationship with the PAs.

Experimental design comprised of both whole-cell and cell-attached single-channel recordings using the patch-clamp techniques. The liposomal form of NO, Lip(NO), increased whole-cell outward K+ currents in a dose dependent manner while shifting the activation curve negatively by about 50 mV with respect to unstimulated cells with the EC50 value of 0.55 ± 0.17 µM. At the single channel level, Lip(NO) increased the probability of the open state (Po) of Maxi-K channels from 0.0020 ± 0.0008 to 0.74 ± 0.02 with half-maximal activation occurring at 4.91 ± 0.01 μM, while sub-maximal activation was achieved at 10-5 M Lip(NO. Channel activation was mainly due to significant decrease in the mean closed dwell time (about 500-fold), rather than an increase in the mean open dwell time, which was comparatively modest (about 2-fold). There was also a slight decrease in the amplitude of the elementary Maxi-K currents (approximately 15%) accompanied by an increase in current noise, which might indicate some non-specific effects of Lip(NO) on the plasma membrane itself and/or on the phospholipids environment of the channels. In conclusion, the activating action of Lip(NO) on the Maxi-K channel is due to the destabilization of the closed conformation of the channel protein, which causes its more frequent openings and, accordingly, increases the probability of channel transition to its open state.","Ivanova, Irina V; Melnyk, Mariia I; Dryn, Dariia O; Prokhorov, Vitalii V; Zholos, Alexander V; Soloviev, Anatoly I",Journal of liposome research,287,23

One key take home message from these discourses is the role of institutions in nurturing and investing in scholarship. Given the current challenges faced by both higher education and healthcare, there is a risk that activities and resources for scholarship in HPE may be neglected. How do institutions make a case for continuous investment in HPE scholarship? Despite being a relatively new and small private university with no public funding, IMU has made fairly significant progress in delivering a unique model of HPE programmes with HPE scholarly output. This commentary discusses the importance of investing in scholarship for HPE with the International Medical University (IMU) in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia as a case study.

However, some CSDAVFs may be associated with angiographic occlusive IPS making access difficult. The purpose of this study was to report our experience of transvenous embolization of the CSDAVF via angiographic occlusive IPS. METHODS We reviewed the cases of 20 patients who underwent transvenous embolization via angiographic occlusive IPS over a 6 year period. The study consisted of seven men and 13 women, ranging from 46 years to 78 years of age (mean, 60 years). We retrospectively analyzed the angioarchitecture of the CSDAVFs, the procedural time and the angiographic as well as the clinical outcomes after embolization. RESULTS True occlusive IPS was found in 13 of the patients, while patent IPS with compartment of the IPS-CS was demonstrated in the remaining seven patients. The microcatheter was successfully navigated to the fistula site of the CS in 16 patients (80%), while such navigation failed in four patients following numerous attempts. The mean procedural times for truly occlusive IPS and for compartment of the IPS-CS were 111 minutes and 129 minutes, respectively. No recurrent fistula was observed on follow-up neuroimages. Three patients had transient third or sixth cranial nerve palsy, and one patient had perforation of the IPS leading to temporary headache. The mean clinical follow-up period was 18 months. CONCLUSION Angiographic occlusive IPS of CSDAVF may be related to true occlusion of IPS or patent IPS with compartment of the IPS-CS. There is no statistically significant difference in procedural times for these two different fistula anatomies. Transvenous embolization via angiographic occlusive IPS is a safe and effective method to manage CSDAVFs.","Luo, Chao-Bao; Chang, Feng-Chi; Teng, Michael Mu-Huo; Guo, Wan-Yuo; Ting, Ta-Wei",Journal of the Chinese Medical Association : JCMA,287,1
88683,88683,88683,Lower pretreatment cerebral blood volume affects hemorrhagic risks after intra-arterial revascularization in acute stroke.,14.587624,8.703101,2008,"UNLABELLED Mitochondrial lipid raft-like microdomains, experimentally also termed mitochondrial detergent-resistant membrane fractions (mDRM), play a role as platforms for recruiting signaling molecules involved in antiviral responses such as apoptosis and innate immunity. Viruses can modulate mitochondrial functions for their own survival and replication. However, viral regulation of the antiviral responses via mDRM remains incompletely understood. Here, we report that human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8) gene product viral interferon regulatory factor 1 (vIRF-1) is targeted to mDRM during virus replication and negatively regulates the mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS)-mediated antiviral responses. The N-terminal region of vIRF-1 interacts directly with membrane lipids, including cardiolipin. In addition, a GxRP motif within the N terminus of vIRF-1, conserved in the mDRM-targeting region of mitochondrial proteins, including PTEN-induced putative kinase 1 (PINK1) and MAVS, was found to be important for vIRF-1 association with mitochondria. Furthermore, MAVS, which has the potential to promote vIRF-1 targeting to mDRM possibly by inducing cardiolipin exposure on the outer membrane of mitochondria, interacts with vIRF-1, which, in turn, inhibits MAVS-mediated antiviral signaling. Consistent with these results, vIRF-1 targeting to mDRM contributes to promotion of HHV-8 productive replication and inhibition of associated apoptosis. Combined, our results suggest novel molecular mechanisms for negative-feedback regulation of MAVS by vIRF-1 during virus replication. IMPORTANCE Successful virus replication is in large part achieved by the ability of viruses to counteract apoptosis and innate immune responses elicited by infection of host cells. Recently, mitochondria have emerged to play a central role in antiviral signaling. In particular, mitochondrial lipid raft-like microdomains appear to function as platforms in cell apoptosis signaling. However, viral regulation of antiviral signaling through the mitochondrial microdomains remains incompletely understood. The present study demonstrates that HHV-8-encoded vIRF-1 targets to the mitochondrial detergent-resistant microdomains via direct interaction with cardiolipin and inhibits MAVS protein-mediated apoptosis and type I interferon gene expression in a negative-feedback manner, thus promoting HHV-8 productive replication. These results suggest that vIRF-1 is the first example of a viral protein to inhibit mitochondrial antiviral signaling through lipid raft-like microdomains.","Hwang, Keun Young; Choi, Young Bong",Journal of virology,287,1

Using this approach, we identify 70 new histone Kme marks with a 90% validation rate. H2BK43me2, which undergoes dynamic changes during stem cell differentiation, is found to be a substrate of KDM5b.

Here, we compared the efficacy and safety of propofol and dexmedetomidine, which are commonly administered during MAC when performing RFA to assess hepatic neoplasm.In this randomized controlled trial, 40 patients were randomly allocated to 2 groups for elective RFA. Patients received either dexmedetomidine (group D) or propofol (group P). Both groups received the continuous infusion of remifentanil for pain control. The primary outcomes were opioid consumption and differences in partial pressure of arterial carbon dioxide (PaCO2) between pre- and postprocedure RFA. In addition, hemodynamic parameters, patient satisfaction, and interventional radiologist satisfaction were determined.There were significant differences in opioid consumption (50.1 ± 16.8 ng/kg/min [group D] vs 71.2 ± 18.7 ng/kg/min [group P]; P = 0.001) and delta PaCO2 (10.4 ± 6.4 mm Hg vs 17.2 ± 9.2 mm Hg, respectively; P = 0.016). Moreover, respiratory rates were significantly different between groups during RFA (P < 0.001). However, blood pressure and heart rate did not significantly change during RFA.

One particularly challenging situation quadrupeds may face is when the functionality of a limb is reduced or lost. To better understand how mammals manage in such situations and which muscular adaptations they exhibit when locomoting on three legs, we recorded the activity patterns of two limb and one back extensor muscle in nine dogs using surface electromyography. We compared the timing and the level of recruitment before and after the loss of a hindlimb was simulated. Both the intensity and the timing of the activity changed significantly in the m. vastus lateralis of the remaining hindlimb, consistent with this limb bearing a greater proportion of the body weight as well as with previously reported kinematic changes. In accordance with the greater body weight supported by the forelimbs, the m. triceps brachii showed first and foremost an increased level of excitation. The very asymmetrical changes in the timing and the level of activity in the m. longissimus dorsi reflects the highly asymmetrical functional requirements imposed on the trunk and the pelvis when one hindlimb is no longer involved in the production of locomotor work while the other hindlimb partially compensates the loss. Integration of our electromyographical findings with kinetic and kinematic results illustrates that dogs exhibited a well-coordinated response to the functional requirements of tripedalism and underlines the importance of moment-to-moment modulation in muscular recruitment for the functional plasticity of the mammalian locomotor system.","Fuchs, Aniela; Anders, Alexandra; Nolte, Ingo; Schilling, Nadja","Journal of experimental zoology.

METHODS Thirty-two patients with familial Mediterranean fever and 30 healthy controls were included in the study. All the patients underwent a complete ophthalmologic examination, including best-corrected visual acuity and intraocular pressure measurement. The AngioVue optical coherence tomography angiography device (Optovue, Fremont, CA) with split-spectrum amplitude-decorrelation angiography was used to evaluate and examine the retinal microvascular structure. Three-dimensional en face Optical coherence tomography angiography images were obtained by examining the macula using the 3 x 3 mm scanning protocol in the Angio Retina mode and the optic nerve using the 3 x 3 mm scanning protocol in the Angio Disk mode. All the patients' right eyes were examined. RESULTS A total of 62 subjects were included in the study, of whom 32 (53.3%) were female and 30 (46.7%) were male. No statistically significant difference was found between the two groups in terms of optic nerve head or radial peripapillary capillary vessel density. On examination, the superficial capillary plexuses were statistically similar between the two groups, but the deep capillary plexus vessel density in the parafovea, superior hemi, temporal, and superior areas were significantly lower in the patients with familial Mediterranean fever. CONCLUSIONS We found that the capillary plexus vessel density was significantly lower in the parafovea, superior hemi, temporal, and superior regions in the patients with familial Mediterranean fever than in the control group. Therefore, OCTA, a noninvasive study, may be useful for understanding the systemic effects of familial Mediterranean fever.","Erdem, Seyfettin; Karahan, Mine; Ava, Sedat; Dursun, Mehmet Emin; Cevik, Figen Ceylan; Özkul, Emin; Keklikci, Ugur; Çevik, Remzi",Arquivos brasileiros de oftalmologia,287,1

Viral fusion glycoproteins from many viruses contain a short region in the ectodomain and near the transmembrane domain, referred to as the pre-transmembrane (PTM) domain. In some cases, the PTM domain is rich in aromatic amino acids and plays an important role in membrane fusion. Although the 23-amino-acid (aa) PTM domain of AcMNPV GP64 lacks aromatic amino acids, we asked whether this region might also play a significant role in membrane fusion. We generated alanine scanning and single and multiple amino acid substitutions in the GP64 PTM domain. We specifically focused on amino acid positions conserved between baculovirus GP64 and thogotovirus GP75 proteins, as well as hydrophobic and charged amino acids. For each PTM-modified construct, we examined trimerization, cell surface localization, and membrane fusion activity. Membrane merger and pore formation were also examined. We identified eight aa positions that are important for membrane fusion activity. Critical positions were not clustered in the linear sequence but were distributed throughout the PTM domain. While charged residues were not critical or essential, three hydrophobic amino acids (L465, L476, and L480) played an important role in membrane fusion activity and appear to be involved in formation of the fusion pore. We also asked whether selected GP64 constructs were capable of rescuing a gp64null AcMNPV virus. These studies suggested that several conserved residues (T463, G460, G462, and G474) were not required for membrane fusion but were important for budding and viral infectivity.","Li, Zhaofei; Blissard, Gary W",Journal of virology,287,24

Haemoglobin-based oxygen carrier (HBOC) can expand the volume and provide oxygen for tissues. Vascular leakage is common complication in the process of haemorrhagic shock and resuscitation. The aim of this study was to observe the effects of HBOC (a bovine-derived, cross-linked tetramer haemoglobin oxygen-carrying solution, 0.5 g/L) on vascular leakage in rats after haemorrhagic shock. A haemorrhagic shock rat model and hypoxic vascular endothelial cells (VECs) were used. The role of intercellular junctions and endothelial glycocalyx in the protective effects of HBOC and the relationship with mitochondrial function were analysed. After haemorrhagic shock, the pulmonary vascular permeability to FITC-BSA, Evans Blue was increased, endothelial glycocalyx was destroyed and the expression of intercellular junction proteins was decreased. After haemorrhagic shock, a small volume of HBOC solution (6 ml/kg) protected pulmonary vascular permeability, increased structural thickness of endothelial glycocalyx, the levels of its components and increased expression levels of the intercellular junction proteins ZO-1, VE-cadherin and occludin. Moreover, HBOC significantly increased oxygen delivery and consumption in rats, improved VEC mitochondrial function and structure. In conclusion, HBOC mitigates endothelial leakage by protecting endothelial glycocalyx and intercellular junctions through improving mitochondrial function and tissue oxygen delivery.","Zhao, Hong Liang; Zhang, Jie; Zhu, Yu; Wu, Yue; Yan, Qing Guang; Peng, Xiao Yong; Xiang, Xin Ming; Tian, Kun Lun; Li, Tao; Liu, Liang Ming","Artificial cells, nanomedicine, and biotechnology",287,0

This study was conducted to investigate whether the observed shedding of ischemically damaged epithelial cells affects IR induced inflammation in the human small gut. METHODS AND FINDINGS Using a newly developed IR model of the human small intestine, the inflammatory response was studied on cellular, protein and mRNA level. Thirty patients were consecutively included. Part of the jejunum was subjected to 30 minutes of ischemia and variable reperfusion periods (mean reperfusion time 120 (+/-11) minutes). Ethical approval and informed consent were obtained. Increased plasma intestinal fatty acid binding protein (I-FABP) levels indicated loss in epithelial cell integrity in response to ischemia and reperfusion (p<0.001 vs healthy). HIF-1alpha gene expression doubled (p = 0.02) and C3 gene expression increased 4-fold (p = 0.01) over the course of IR. Gut barrier failure, assessed as LPS concentration in small bowel venous effluent blood, was not observed (p = 0.18). Additionally, mRNA expression of HO-1, IL-6, IL-8 did not alter. No increased expression of endothelial adhesion molecules, TNFalpha release, increased numbers of inflammatory cells (p = 0.71) or complement activation, assessed as activated C3 (p = 0.14), were detected in the reperfused tissue. CONCLUSIONS In the human small intestine, thirty minutes of ischemia followed by up to 4 hours of reperfusion, does not seem to lead to an explicit inflammatory response. This may be explained by a unique mechanism of shedding of damaged enterocytes, reported for the first time by our group.","Matthijsen, Robert A; Derikx, Joep P M; Kuipers, Dian; van Dam, Ronald M; Dejong, Cornelis H C; Buurman, Wim A",PloS one,287,1

Since these artifacts can represent an obstacle for the detection of periprocedural bleeding, this study investigated the effect of artifact reduction by an iterative metal artifact reduction (iMAR) software in CT in a brain phantom. METHODS Two different in vitro models with two-dimensional tube and three-dimensional AVM-like configuration were filled with Onyx 18. The models were inserted into a brain imaging phantom and images with (n = 5) and without (n = 10) an experimental hemorrhage adjacent were acquired. Afterwards, the iMAR algorithm was applied for artifact reduction. The IAs of the original and the post-processed images were graded quantitatively and qualitatively. Moreover, qualitative definition of the experimental hemorrhage was investigated. RESULTS Comparing the IAs of the original and the post-processed CT images, quantitative and qualitative analysis showed a lower degree of IAs in the post-processed images, i.e. quantitative analysis: 2D tube model: 23.92 ± 8.02 Hounsfield units (HU; no iMAR; mean ± standard deviation) vs. 5.93 ± 0.43 HU (with iMAR; p < 0.001); qualitative analysis: 3D AVM model: 4.93 ± 0.18 vs. 3.40 ± 0.48 (p < 0.001). Furthermore, definition of the experimental hemorrhage was better in the post-processed images of both in vitro models (2D tube model: p = 0.004; 3D AVM model: p = 0.002). CONCLUSION The iMAR algorithm can significantly reduce the IAs evoked by Onyx 18 in CT.

Visual search is also used in professional contexts, such as medical diagnostic imaging and airport baggage screening. These contexts are often characterised by low-prevalence or rare targets. Here we tested whether individual differences in the detection of targets in visual search could be predicted from variables derived from the rich informational source of participants' subjective experience of their cognitive and attentional function in everyday life. We tested this in both low-prevalence (Experiment 1) and high-prevalence (Experiment 2) visual search conditions. In both experiments, participants completed a visual search with arrays containing multiple photorealistic objects, and their task was to detect the presence of a gun. Following this, they completed the Cognitive Failures Questionnaire (CFQ) and the Attentional Control Scale (ACS). In Experiment 1, the target was present on 2% of trials, while in Experiment 2, it was present on 50%. In both experiments, participants' scores on the False Triggering component of the CFQ were negatively associated with accuracy on target-present trials, while participants' scores on the Forgetfulness component of the CFQ were positively associated with target-present accuracy. These results show that objective performance in visual search can be predicted from subjective experiences of cognitive function. They also highlight that the CFQ is not monolithic.

All these entities are rare with small series published to date, mostly containing primary and secondary forms of disease. LIP is histologically characterized by diffuse polyclonal lymphoid cell infiltrate surrounding the airways and expanding the interstitium. Thin-walled cysts and diffuse ground glass are considered the typical radiologic features. The clinical course is highly variable with corticosteroid responsiveness evident in approximately half of cases. IPPFE is defined histologically by coexisting upper lobe pleural and intra-alveolar fibrosis with elastosis. Dense subpleural irregular fibrosis and consolidation are the cardinal radiologic features. A history of recurrent lower respiratory tract infection is frequent. Responses to immunomodulation have not been reported and the rate of progression appears to be highly variable. AFOP is a rare histologic pattern lying within the spectrum of acute/subacute lung injury, characterized by organizing pneumonia and intra-alveolar fibrin deposition without hyaline membranes. BPIP is characterized histologically by fibrosis and/or inflammation confined to the alveolar interstitium around bronchovascular bundles, overlapping with peribronchial metaplasia and fibrosis in some series. Currently, AFOP and BPIP are both best viewed as histological entities rather than true clinical disorders, in the absence of characteristic associated imaging patterns and clinical features.","Kokosi, Maria A; Nicholson, Andrew G; Hansell, David M; Wells, Athol U",Respirology,287,13

However, a 20 second SI in surfactant-deficient preterm lambs caused an acute phase injury response without decreasing lung injury from subsequent mechanical ventilation. HYPOTHESIS A 20 second SI at birth will decrease lung injury from mechanical ventilation in surfactant-treated preterm fetal lambs. METHODS The head and chest of fetal sheep at 126±1 day GA were exteriorized, with tracheostomy and removal of fetal lung fluid prior to treatment with surfactant (300 mg in 15 ml saline). Fetal lambs were randomized to one of four 15 minute interventions: 1) PEEP 8 cmH2O; 2) 20 sec SI at 40 cmH2O, then PEEP 8 cmH2O; 3) mechanical ventilation with 7 ml/kg tidal volume; or 4) 20 sec SI then mechanical ventilation at 7 ml/kg. Fetal lambs remained on placental support for the intervention and for 30 min after the intervention. RESULTS SI recruited a mean volume of 6.8±0.8 mL/kg. SI did not alter respiratory physiology during mechanical ventilation. Heat shock protein (HSP) 70, HSP60, and total protein in lung fluid similarly increased in both ventilation groups. Modest pro-inflammatory cytokine and acute phase responses, with or without SI, were similar with ventilation. SI alone did not increase markers of injury. CONCLUSION In surfactant treated fetal lambs, a 20 sec SI did not alter ventilation physiology or markers of lung injury from mechanical ventilation.","Hillman, Noah H; Kemp, Matthew W; Miura, Yuichiro; Kallapur, Suhas G; Jobe, Alan H",PloS one,287,33

It has been suggested that they affect each other. The aim of this study is to evaluate the association between clot burden score, thrombus perviousness, and collateral score and to determine whether collateral score influences the association of thrombus characteristics with functional outcome. METHODS Patients with baseline thin-slice noncontrast computed tomography and computed tomographic angiography images from the MR CLEAN trial (Multicenter Randomized Clinical Trial of Endovascular Treatment of Acute Ischemic Stroke in the Netherlands) were included (n=195). Collateral score and clot burden scores were determined on baseline computed tomographic angiography. Thrombus attenuation increase was determined by comparing thrombus density on noncontrast computed tomography and computed tomographic angiography using a semiautomated method. The association of collateral score with clot burden score and thrombus attenuation increase was evaluated with linear regression. Mediation and effect modification analyses were used to assess the influence of collateral score on the association of clot burden score and thrombus attenuation increase with functional outcome. RESULTS A higher clot burden score (B=0.063; 95% confidence interval, 0.008-0.118) and a higher thrombus attenuation increase (B=0.014; 95% confidence interval, 0.003-0.026) were associated with higher collateral score. Collateral score mediated the association of clot burden score with functional outcome. The association between thrombus attenuation increase and functional outcome was modified by the collateral score, and this association was stronger in patients with moderate and good collaterals. CONCLUSIONS Patients with lower thrombus burden and higher thrombus perviousness scores had higher collateral score. The positive effect of thrombus perviousness on clinical outcome was only present in patients with moderate and high collateral scores. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION URL: http://www.trialregister.nl.

The CES-D scale (Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression scale) was used to measure major depressive symptoms (CES-D score ≥23) in 5337 pregnant women interviewed at 24-26 weeks of pregnancy. Multivariate logistic regression models were developed to identify risk factors associated with major depressive symptoms. Prevalence of major depressive symptoms was 11.9% (11.0-12.8%) for all pregnant women. Working women had the lowest proportion of major depressive symptoms [7.6% (6.6-8.7%); n = 2514] compared to housewives [19.1% (16.5-21.8%); n = 893], women who had stopped working [14.4% (12.7-16.1%); n = 1665], and students [14.3% (10.3-19.1%); n = 265]. After adjusting for major risk factors, the association between pregnant women's employment status and major depressive symptoms remained significant for women who had stopped working (OR: 1.61; 95% CI 1.26 to 2.04) and for housewives (OR: 1.46; 95% CI 1.10 to 1.94), but not for students (OR: 1.37; 95% CI 0.87 to 2.16). In multivariate analyses, low education, low social support outside of work, having experienced acute stressful events, lack of money for basic needs, experiencing marital strain, having a chronic health problem, country of birth, and smoking were significantly associated with major depressive symptoms. Health professionals should consider the employment status of pregnant women when they evaluate risk profiles.

METHODS A comprehensive systematic search of online databases from January 1946 through June 2015 was completed. The maternal outcomes were: fetal loss, preterm birth, full-term birth, complications of pregnancy, the type of delivery, and periconception hemorrhage. The fetal outcomes were: intrauterine growth restriction/LGA, fetal anomalies, APGAR score, and neonatal death. RESULTS Twenty articles were included in the systematic review and 15 included in the meta-analysis. There was a 2.60 greater likelihood of fetal loss (I2 = 99%). Newborns of women of a very advanced maternal age were 2.49 more likely to have a concerning 5-minute APGAR score. Very advanced maternal age women had a 3.32 greater likelihood of pregnancy complications (I2 = 91%). There was a 1.96 greater likelihood of preterm birth at very advanced maternal age (I2 = 91%) and a 4 times greater likelihood of having to deliver through Caesarean section (I2 = 97%). CONCLUSION This systematic review showed an increased risk of adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes.

The characteristics of this cohort of patients, including the risk of bleeding and the need for systemic anticoagulation, are generally considered as relative contraindications to ECMO treatment. However, recent evidence suggests that the use of ECMO should be taken in consideration even in this group of patients. RECENT FINDINGS The recent findings suggest that venous-venous ECMO can be feasible in the treatment of refractory respiratory failure and severe acute respiratory distress syndrome trauma-related. The improvement of ECMO techniques including the introduction of centrifugal pumps and heparin-coated circuits are progressively reducing the amount of heparin required; moreover, the application of heparin-free ECMO showed good outcomes and minimal complications. Venous-arterial ECMO has emerged as a salvage intervention in patients with cardiogenic shock and after cardiac arrest. Venous-arterial ECMO provides circulatory support allowing time for other treatments to promote recovery in presence of acute cardiopulmonary failure. Only poor-quality evidence is available, for venous-arterial ECMO in trauma patients. SUMMARY ECMO can be considered as a safe rescue therapy even in trauma patients, including neurological injury, chest trauma as well as burns. However, evidence is still poor; further studies are warranted focusing on trauma patients undergoing ECMO, to better clarify the effect on survival, the type and dose of anticoagulation to use, as well as the utility of dedicated multidisciplinary trauma-ECMO units.","Della Torre, Valentina; Robba, Chiara; Pelosi, Paolo; Bilotta, Federico",Current opinion in anaesthesiology,287,24

TEM has some limitations, such as the need for special equipment, expensive cost, and steep learning curve. In this study, we address the technical feasibility of TAMIS under spinal anesthesia and its short-term postoperative outcomes. METHODS From July 2011 to September 2012, 25 consecutive patients with middle or upper third rectal masses underwent TAMIS. Tumors were located 6-17 cm from the anal verge. After spinal anesthesia, a single-incision laparoscopic surgery port was inserted into the anal canal. With this access, conventional laparoscopic instruments, including a grasper and monopolar electrocautery and suction device, were used to perform the transanal excision. A hook-type monopolar electrocautery or harmonic scalpel was used for dissection. The defect of the rectum was closed by interrupted sutures. Data concerning demographics, details of operative procedure, postoperative pain, and pathologic results were collected prospectively. To evaluate anal sphincter injury, an endoanal ultrasonography and fecal incontinence severity index survey were performed at 3-6 months after the operation. RESULTS Of the 25 patients, nine had adenocarcinomas, nine had neuroendocrine tumors, three had tubular adenomas with high-grade dysplasia, three had tubular adenomas, one had a tubulovillous adenoma, and one had a gastrointestinal stromal tumor. The median distance from the tumor mass to the anal verge was 9.0 (range 6-17) cm. The median operative time was 45.0 (range 20-120) min. All patients received TAMIS without conversion to laparoscopic resection. There were no intraoperative complications or postoperative morbidity. The median postoperative hospital stay was 3.0 (range 2-7) days. No sphincter injury was detected by endoanal ultrasonography. CONCLUSIONS TAMIS under spinal anesthesia is a safe and feasible technique for resection of middle and upper rectal masses. Spinal anesthesia is adequate for this procedure.","Lee, Taek-Gu; Lee, Sang-Jeon",Surgical endoscopy,287,17

Our aim was to quantify the change in acute or subacute ischemic strokes detected on CT or MR imaging during the pandemic using natural language processing of radiology reports. MATERIALS AND METHODS We retrospectively analyzed 32,555 radiology reports from brain CTs and MRIs from a comprehensive stroke center, performed from March 1 to April 30 each year from 2017 to 2020, involving 20,414 unique patients. To detect acute or subacute ischemic stroke in free-text reports, we trained a random forest natural language processing classifier using 1987 randomly sampled radiology reports with manual annotation. Natural language processing classifier generalizability was evaluated using 1974 imaging reports. RESULTS The natural language processing classifier achieved a 5-fold cross-validation classification accuracy of 0.97 and an F1 score of 0.74, with a slight underestimation (-5%) of actual numbers of acute or subacute ischemic strokes in cross-validation. Importantly, cross-validation performance stratified by year was similar. Applying the classifier to the complete study cohort, we found an estimated 24% decrease in patients with acute or subacute ischemic strokes reported on CT or MR imaging from March to April 2020 compared with the average from those months in 2017-2019. Among patients with stroke-related order indications, the estimated proportion who underwent neuroimaging with acute or subacute ischemic stroke detection significantly increased from 16% during 2017-2019 to 21% in 2020 (P = .01). The natural language processing classifier performed worse on external data. CONCLUSIONS Acute or subacute ischemic stroke cases detected by neuroimaging decreased during the COVID-19 pandemic, though a higher proportion of studies ordered for stroke were positive for acute or subacute ischemic strokes. Natural language processing approaches can help automatically track acute or subacute ischemic stroke numbers for epidemiologic studies, though local classifier training is important due to radiologist reporting style differences.","Li, M D; Lang, M; Deng, F; Chang, K; Buch, K; Rincon, S; Mehan, W A; Leslie-Mazwi, T M; Kalpathy-Cramer, J",AJNR.

The learning curve for this method is not yet established. The aim was to evaluate the learning curve of anesthesiology residents in ultrasound measurement of subglottic airway diameter for prediction of endotracheal tube size using cumulative sum (CUSUM) analysis. METHODS Sixteen anesthesiology residents measured transverse subglottic airway diameter in children undergoing general anesthesia with cuffed endotracheal intubation. Each resident performed 30 ultrasound examinations. Primary outcome was the successful prediction of endotracheal tube size according to ultrasound measurement. CUSUM analysis was performed with acceptable and unacceptable failure rates set as 20 and 40% respectively. RESULTS Ten out of 16 residents (62.5 %) were deemed successful as they were able to pass lower decision boundary, whereas six residents' CUSUM scores were between the decisions lines deeming them indeterminate. The overall success rate for determining the correct endotracheal tube size was 77.5%. Median number of attempts to cross lower decision boundary was 29 with minimum of 18 and maximum of 29 attempts among successful residents. CONCLUSION Learning curves constructed with CUSUM analysis in this study showed that only 62.5% of residents were able to correctly predict cuffed endotracheal tube size with 80% success rate.

CASE PRESENTATION A young woman presented to our institution with acute abdominal pain, tenderness and constipation. Ultrasound reported a right ovarian mass; at laparoscopy, we discovered ascites, peritoneal carcinomatosis and a voluminous pelvic mass. CLINICAL DISCUSSION Diagnosis was confirmed as non-Hodgkin sporadic Burkitt's lymphoma: the careful workup was the key to initiate multiagent chemotherapy. CONCLUSION Primary ovarian Burkitt's lymphoma, in a young woman in a non-endemic zone, is a rarity that represents a strong diagnostic challenge, but rapid identification can lead the patient to appropriate therapies and improvement of prognosis.","Sergi, William; Marchese, Tiziana Rita Lucia; Botrugno, Ivan; Baglivo, Arturo; Spampinato, Marcello",International journal of surgery case reports,287,19

METHODS A review of literature reviews and meta-analyses published from January 2013 to 2019 was conducted using PubMed, PsycINFO, Sociological Abstracts, and Web of Science. Articles were considered for inclusion using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) framework. RESULTS Twenty-nine studies met the criteria for review. Both domestic and international studies find that experiences of discrimination reported by adults are adversely related to mental health and indicators of physical health, including preclinical indicators of disease, health behaviors, utilization of care, and adherence to medical regimens. Emerging evidence also suggests that discrimination can affect the health of children and adolescents and that at least some of its adverse effects may be ameliorated by the presence of psychosocial resources. CONCLUSIONS Increasing evidence indicates that racial discrimination is an emerging risk factor for disease and a contributor to racial disparities in health. Attention is needed to strengthen research gaps and to advance our understanding of the optimal interventions that can reduce the negative effects of discrimination.","Williams, David R; Lawrence, Jourdyn A; Davis, Brigette A; Vu, Cecilia",Health services research,287,16

We explore the role of vaccines in control and eradication of a novel emerging pathogen. METHODS : We hypothetically simulate emergence of a novel wild poliovirus (nWPV) in 2020 assuming an immunologically naïve population. Assuming different nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), we explore the impacts of vaccines resembling serotype-specific oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV), novel OPV (nOPV), or inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV). RESULTS : Vaccines most effectively change the trajectory of an emerging disease when disseminated early, rapidly, and widely in the background of ongoing strict NPIs, unless the NPIs successfully eradicate the emerging pathogen before it establishes endemic transmission. Without strict NPIs, vaccines primarily reduce the burden of disease in the remaining susceptible individuals and in new birth cohorts. Live virus vaccines that effectively compete with the nWPVs can reduce disease burdens more than other vaccines. When relaxation of existing NPIs occurs at the time of vaccine introduction, nWPV transmission can counterintuitively increase in the short term. CONCLUSIONS : Vaccines can increase the probability of disease eradication in the context of strict NPIs. However, successful eradication will depend on specific immunization strategies used and a global commitment to eradication.","Thompson, Kimberly M; Kalkowska, Dominika A; Badizadegan, Kamran",Expert review of vaccines,287,23

Importantly, no studies addressed the relationship between sleep disturbance or sleep quality and ovarian cancer incidence. Moreover, few studies have examined the relationships between sleep measures and subtypes of ovarian cancer. This study included 109,024 postmenopausal women aged 50-79 from the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) during 1993-1998 and followed through 2018. The Cox proportional hazards model was used to estimate adjusted hazard ratios for the associations between sleep habits and the incidence of ovarian cancer and its subtypes. No association was observed between sleep duration, sleep quality, sleep disturbance, or insomnia and risk of overall ovarian cancer, serous/non-serous or Type I/Type II ovarian cancer subtype. However, compared with women with average sleep quality, women with restful or very restful sleep quality had a significantly lower risk of invasive serous subtype (HR: 0.73, 95% CI: 0.60-0.90) while insomnia was associated with a higher risk of invasive serous subtype (HR: 1.36, 95% CI: 1.12-1.66). Associations with insomnia differed significantly by serous and non-serous subtypes, and Type I and Type II subtypes (Pheterogeneity=0.001 and Pheterogeneity<0.001, respectively). This study provides no evidence on association between sleep habits and overall ovarian cancer risk among postmenopausal women. However, restful or very restful sleep quality was associated with a lower risk of invasive serous ovarian cancer, and insomnia was associated with a higher risk of invasive serous ovarian cancer. Associations with insomnia differed by subtypes.","Liang, Xiaoyun; Harris, Holly R; Hendryx, Michael; Shadyab, Aladdin H; Hale, Lauren; Li, Yueyao; Crane, Tracy E; Cespedes Feliciano, Elizabeth M; Stefanick, Marcia L; Luo, Juhua",Cancer prevention research,287,29

Peripherally inserted central venous catheters have a low rate of fatal mechanical complications when compared to non-tunnel central venous catheters. However, as peripherally inserted central venous catheter access requires a smaller vein, there is a high risk of thrombosis. The axillary vein (confluence of the basilic and brachial veins) can serve as an access for cannulation. Moreover, as this vein is larger than the basilic or brachial vein, it might be a superior option for preventing thrombosis. The risk of catheter-related bloodstream infection should be considered when the puncture site is at the axillary fossa. The aim of this study was to present our new protocol involving peripherally inserted central venous catheters (non-tunneled/tunneled) and a tunneling technique and assess its feasibility and safety for improving cannulation and preventing thrombosis and infection. METHODS The study included 20 patients. The axillary vein in the upper arm was used for peripherally inserted central venous catheters in patients with a small-diameter basilic vein (<3 mm). When the puncture site was in the axillary fossa, a subcutaneous tunnel of about 3 cm was constructed easily using a peripheral venous catheter. RESULTS The observed catheter duration was 645 days (median ± standard deviation, 26 ± 22.22 days). Catheterization was successful in all cases, however, two accidental dislodgements were identified. No fatal or serious complications were observed after catheterization. CONCLUSION Our new protocol for axillary peripherally inserted central venous catheters/tunneled axillary peripherally inserted central venous catheters use for a small-diameter basilic vein is safe and feasible.","Saijo, Fumito; Odaka, Yoshinobu; Mutoh, Mitsuhisa; Katayose, Yu; Tokumura, Hiromi",The journal of vascular access,287,19

METHODS We conducted a prospective, multi-center, observational study of consecutive hospitalized adults in the NYC metropolitan area with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. The prevalence of new neurologic disorders (as diagnosed by a neurologist) was recorded and in-hospital mortality and discharge disposition were compared between COVID-19 patients with and without neurologic disorders. RESULTS Of 4,491 COVID-19 patients hospitalized during the study timeframe, 606 (13.5%) developed a new neurologic disorder in a median of 2 days from COVID-19 symptom onset. The most common diagnoses were: toxic/metabolic encephalopathy (6.8%), seizure (1.6%), stroke (1.9%), and hypoxic/ischemic injury (1.4%). No patient had meningitis/encephalitis, or myelopathy/myelitis referable to SARS-CoV-2 infection and 18/18 CSF specimens were RT-PCR negative for SARS-CoV-2. Patients with neurologic disorders were more often older, male, white, hypertensive, diabetic, intubated, and had higher sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) scores (all P<0.05). After adjusting for age, sex, SOFA-scores, intubation, past history, medical complications, medications and comfort-care-status, COVID-19 patients with neurologic disorders had increased risk of in-hospital mortality (Hazard Ratio[HR] 1.38, 95% CI 1.17-1.62, P<0.001) and decreased likelihood of discharge home (HR 0.72, 95% CI 0.63-0.85, P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS Neurologic disorders were detected in 13.5% of COVID-19 patients and were associated with increased risk of in-hospital mortality and decreased likelihood of discharge home. Many observed neurologic disorders may be sequelae of severe systemic illness.","Frontera, Jennifer A; Sabadia, Sakinah; Lalchan, Rebecca; Fang, Taolin; Flusty, Brent; Millar-Vernetti, Patricio; Snyder, Thomas; Berger, Stephen; Yang, Dixon; Granger, Andre; Morgan, Nicole; Patel, Palak; Gutman, Josef; Melmed, Kara; Agarwal, Shashank; Bokhari, Matthew; Andino, Andres; Valdes, Eduard; Omari, Mirza; Kvernland, Alexandra; Lillemoe, Kaitlyn; Chou, Sherry H-Y; McNett, Molly; Helbok, Raimund; Mainali, Shraddha; Fink, Ericka L; Robertson, Courtney; Schober, Michelle; Suarez, Jose I; Ziai, Wendy; Menon, David; Friedman, Daniel; Friedman, David; Holmes, Manisha; Huang, Joshua; Thawani, Sujata; Howard, Jonathan; Abou-Fayssal, Nada; Krieger, Penina; Lewis, Ariane; Lord, Aaron S; Zhou, Ting; Kahn, D Ethan; Czeisler, Barry M; Torres, Jose; Yaghi, Shadi; Ishida, Koto; Scher, Erica; de Havenon, Adam; Placantonakis, Dimitris; Liu, Mengling; Wisniewski, Thomas; Troxel, Andrea B; Balcer, Laura; Galetta, Steven",Neurology,287,1

It impacts patients' quality of life significantly. The pathophysiology of CRS has some similarities to allergic asthma and allergic rhinitis (AR) and includes eosinophilia, T-helper cell 2 cytokines, and local immunoglobilin E formation. Monoclonal antibody therapy has been used successfully in asthma and AR and more recently in CRS. Our was aim to systematically review the literature and identify the role of monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) in the treatment of CRS with polyps (CRSwNP) and without polyps (CRSsNP), especially with regard to comparability with current medical treatment, efficacy, and risk of complications. In addition, the role of surgery and biologics was evaluated. METHODS We identified at total of 5341 relevant studies after a comprehensive database search. Six studies met the inclusion criteria, all 6 randomized, controlled trials. RESULTS Treatment with omalizumab and mepolizumab demonstrated improvements in endoscopic nasal polyp score (EPS) and symptoms score in patients with CRSwNP when compared with placebo. Reslizumab reduced nasal polyp size in patients with raised intranasal interleukin-5 levels. Dupilumab treatment resulted in a 70% reduction in EPS compared with 20% in the placebo group (p < 0.001). These MAbs target different inflammatory markers involved in the pathophysiology of CRSwNP. None of the studies reported on CRSsNP or combined surgery with biologics. No severe adverse events were reported. CONCLUSION Evidence demonstrates that use of MAbs leads to clinical improvement in CRSwNP. However, further research is required to determine their long-term effects, comparability to other medical treatments, and potential side effects.","Iqbal, Isma Z; Kao, Stephen Shih-Teng; Ooi, Eng Hooi",International forum of allergy & rhinology,287,1

To continue pharmacy services, it is critical that pharmacists are prepared for disasters. A systematic literature review was conducted to explore pharmacists' and pharmacy students' preparedness for disasters and the factors that affect preparedness. METHODS This review was conducted in April 2020 through electronic databases CINAHL, MEDLINE, Embase, PubMed, Scopus and PsycINFO, and two disaster journals. Search terms such as 'pharmacist*', 'disaster*' and 'prepared*' were used. The search yielded an initial 1781 titles. Articles were included if they measured pharmacists or pharmacy students' disaster preparedness. After screening and quality appraisal by two researchers, four articles were included in final analysis and review. Data were extracted using a data collection tool formulated by the researchers. Meta-analysis was not possible; instead, results were compared across key areas including preparedness ratings and factors that influenced preparedness. KEY FINDINGS Three articles focused on pharmacy students' preparedness for disasters, and one on registered pharmacists' preparedness. Preparedness across both groups was poor to moderate with <18% of registered pharmacists found to be prepared to respond to a disaster. Factors that potentially influenced preparedness included disaster competency, disaster interventions and demographic factors. CONCLUSION For pharmacists, the lack of research around their preparedness speaks volumes about their current involvement and expectations within disaster management. Without a prepared pharmacy workforce and pharmacy involvement in disaster management, critical skill and service gaps in disasters may negatively impact patients.","McCourt, Elizabeth; Singleton, Judith; Tippett, Vivienne; Nissen, Lisa",The International journal of pharmacy practice,287,1

Systematic literature search in electronic databases was performed to identify studies that investigated the preadmission use of inhaled corticosteroids on the risk of a fatal or severe course of illness in patients with COVID-19 and reported adjusted measures of association. Adjusted odds ratios or relative risks and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals from each study were pooled to produce pooled odds ratio and 95% confidence interval. The meta-analysis revealed no significant difference in the risk for the development of a fatal course of COVID-19 with preadmission use of inhaled corticosteroids in patients with COVID-19 relative to non-use of inhaled corticosteroids (pooled odds ratio =1.28; 95% confidence interval 0.73-2.26). Similarly, the meta-analysis observed no significant difference in the risk for the development of a severe course of COVID-19 with preadmission use of inhaled corticosteroids in patients with COVID-19 relative to non-use of inhaled corticosteroids (pooled odds ratio =1.45; 95% confidence interval 0.96-2.20).","Kow, Chia Siang; Hasan, Syed Shahzad",The Journal of asthma : official journal of the Association for the Care of Asthma,287,31

The purpose of the present study was to determine the long-term traumatic outcomes among the population. A preliminary study aimed at obtaining the Italian translation of the first 16 item of HTQ IV part [1] which was administered, 20 months after the disaster, at 281 survivors. In backward stepwise logistic regressions models, we estimated among the respondent's characteristics and event-related variables the best predictors of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD).A Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) revealed a HTQ five-factors solution as best model, with satisfactory indexes of fit. HTQ held a positive correlation with both the SQD-P (r = .65, p < .05) and SQD-D subscales (r = .47, p < .05). ROC analysis suggested an area of .951 (95% CI = .917-.985) for the PTSD prediction. Basing on sensibility (.963) and specificity (.189), the best cut-off of 2.0 allowed discriminating for PTSD positive cases. After 20 months of the earthquake, the estimate prevalence of PTSD among the survivors is of 21.71% with a consistent and graded association between exposure variables and vulnerability factors (gender, age, exposure to death and home damage) and PTSD symptoms.","Pino, Olimpia; Pelosi, Annalisa; Artoni, Valentina; Mari, Massimo",The Psychiatric quarterly,287,1

DESIGN Retrospective cohort study. SETTING University-affiliated fertility center. PATIENT(S) Patients who underwent FET at the New York University Langone Fertility Center. INTERVENTION(S) None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S) The primary outcome was incidence of SCH by protocol in FET cycles. RESULT(S) There were 1,273 FET cycles that met criteria for inclusion. The frequency of SCH was lower in natural compared with programmed cycles (P<.05; relative risk = 0.4 [0.27-0.78]; odds ratio = 0.4 [0.23-0.75]). Serum estrogen level was higher in programmed compared with natural cycles on day of progesterone initiation (P<.001) and cycle day 28 (P<.001). However, serum estrogen levels at the same time points were not associated with formation of SCH in programmed or natural cycles. CONCLUSION(S) This is the first study to evaluate the formation of SCHs by FET protocol type. Our results highlight that high serum estradiol levels do not independently lead to an increase in rate of SCH. Further research must be done to understand other clinical, or perhaps molecular, differences between natural and programmed FET cycle preparations that can be better associated with SCH formation.","Reich, Jenna; Blakemore, Jennifer K; Grifo, James A",Fertility and sterility,287,29

Forkhead box protein P1 (Foxp1) is a large multi-domain transcriptional regulator belonging to the Fox family with winged helix DNA-binding protein, which plays critical roles in cardiovascular homeostasis and disorders. The broad distribution of Foxp1 and alternative splicing isoforms implicate its distinct functions in diverse cardiac and vascular cells and tissue types. Foxp1 is essential for diverse biological processes and has been shown to regulate cellular proliferation, apoptosis, oxidative stress, fibrosis, angiogenesis, cardiovascular remodeling, and dysfunction. Notably, both loss-of-function and gain-of-function approaches have defined critical roles of Foxp1 in CVD. Genetic deletion of Foxp1 results in pathological cardiac remodeling, exacerbation of atherosclerotic lesion formation, prolonged occlusive thrombus formation, severe cardiac defects, and embryo death. In contrast, activation of Foxp1 performs a wide range of physiological effects, including cell growth, hypertrophy, differentiation, angiogenesis, and cardiac development. More importantly, Foxp1 exerts anti-inflammatory and anti-atherosclerotic effects in controlling coronary thrombus formation and myocardial infarction (MI). Thus, targeting for Foxp1 signaling has emerged as a pre-warning biomarker and a novel therapeutic approach against progression of CVD, and an increased understanding of cardiovascular actions of the Foxp1 signaling will help to develop effective interventions. In this review, we focus on the diverse actions and underlying mechanisms of Foxp1 highlighting its roles in CVD, including heart failure, MI, atherosclerosis, congenital heart defects, and atrial fibrillation.","Liu, Xin-Ming; Du, Sheng-Li; Miao, Ran; Wang, Le-Feng; Zhong, Jiu-Chang",Heart failure reviews,287,1

PROCEDURES Dogs or cats receiving an ACell Vet(™) graft for corneal reconstruction due to severe ulcerative keratitis or after a keratectomy to remove a corneal sequestrum were included. All received a single layer of ACell Vet(™) , bandage contact lens, and temporary tarsorrhaphy. Bandage contact lens and temporary tarsorrhaphy were removed after graft vascularization or epithelialization. Topical steroids, cyclosporine, tacrolimus were started after epithelialization. Based on their last examination, outcomes were categorized into five groups based on the presence of corneal vessels, appearance of the scar, and the ability to visualize the posterior and/or the anterior segment through the grafted area. RESULTS There were 82 eyes included in the study, with 68 eyes with sufficient follow-up time for final assessment. Scarring was minimal in 47 eyes, moderate but not enough to obscure visualization of the posterior segment in 12, and severe in nine. There were five eyes that developed phthisis bulbi, glaucoma or were enucleated and nine that were lost to follow up. Graft dehiscence occurred in 19 eyes. Twelve healed without additional surgical intervention while three required a second graft, two became phthisical, and two were enucleated. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE Corneal reconstruction with ACell Vet(™) alone is a viable alternative and results in minimal scarring and complications in cats. In dogs, scarring is more pronounced than in cats and graft dehiscence rate is higher compared to conventional techniques.","Chow, Derek W Y; Westermeyer, Hans D",Veterinary ophthalmology,287,5

Research on young breast cancer survivors (diagnosed < 45 years old) are limited. METHODS Young breast cancer survivors diagnosed between age 30 and 44, stage I-III, and treated at the University of Alabama at Birmingham Hospital between 2012 and 2015 were included. Cardiovascular disease risk was estimated using excess heart age (calculated using age, systolic blood pressure, blood pressure medication, diabetes, smoking, body mass index) and examined at two time points: diagnosis and 2-year follow-up. Statistical analyses included within-group mean comparison tests and linear regression to examine predictors of excess heart age. RESULTS A total of 152 young breast cancer survivors were included; 95 received anthracyclines and/or trastuzumab, and 57 did not. Overall excess heart age was 4.2 at diagnosis and 5.4 years at 2-year follow-up (p = 0.08). Change in excess heart age from diagnosis to 2-year follow-up among those receiving or not receiving anthracyclines and/or trastuzumab was 4.3-4.4 years, p = 0.93; and 4.0-7.1 years, p < 0.01; respectively. Factors that predicted excess heart age included endocrine therapy (p = 0.049) and change from premenopausal to postmenopausal status (p = 0.048). CONCLUSIONS Anthracyclines and trastuzumab were not predictors of excess heart age. Subclinical changes undetected by heart age may still occur. Future research is needed to evaluate heart age over longer follow-up and to develop a modified heart age tool, that incorporates treatment risk, that facilitates identification of high-risk cancer patients for early intervention in cardiac risk prevention.","Vo, Jacqueline B; Kenzik, Kelly M; Landier, Wendy; Raju, Dheeraj; Kirklin, James K; Meneses, Karen",Cancer causes & control : CCC,287,33

Laparoscopic repair has been gaining popularity for both incisional and ventral herniae. However, the perceived benefits have not been convincingly demonstrated by randomized-controlled studies or meta-analyses. METHODS Case notes from 54 patients undergoing consecutive laparoscopic repairs of the abdominal wall hernia at a single center were reviewed. Demographic data, postoperative complications, length of stay, and recurrence rates were all recorded. RESULTS The majority of the patients had incisional hernia, with de novo ventral hernia comprising 7.4% of the total. Forty percent of patients had undergone at least 1 previous repair of their incisional hernia. The median recorded diameter of the hernia defect was 5 cm. No recurrences were recorded over a median follow-up of 26 months. Complications were all minor and included seroma formation, hematoma, and wound infection (n=5 patients). Median operative duration was 45 minutes and median length of stay postoperatively was 1 day. CONCLUSIONS The results compare well with those in the published literature and would support the continued use of laparoscopic incisional/ventral hernia repair. Any benefits from this approach, however, are likely to be operator dependent. As a result, all units undertaking such repairs should regularly review their results and compare them with the reported standard.","Garcea, Giuseppe; Ngu, Wee; Neal, Christopher P; Robertson, Gavin S","Surgical laparoscopy, endoscopy & percutaneous techniques",287,32

We recently reported that human placenta-derived multipotent stem cells (hPDMCs) process potent anti-inflammatory effects. In this study, we examined the protective effect of hPDMC transplants in a rodent model of stroke. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were anesthetized. hPDMCs labeled with a vital dye of fluorescing microparticles, DiI, or vehicle were transplanted into three cortical areas adjacent to the right middle cerebral artery (MCA). Five minutes after grafting, the right MCA was transiently occluded for 60 min. Stroke animals receiving hPDMCs showed a significant behavioral improvement and reduction in lesion volume examined by T2-weighted images 4 days poststroke. Brain tissues were collected 1 day later. Human-specific marker HuNu immunoreactivity and DiI fluorescence were found at the hPDMC graft sites, suggesting the survival of hPDMCs in host brain. Grafting of hPDMCs suppressed IBA1 immunoreactivity and deramification of IBA1(+) cells in the perilesioned area, suggesting activation of microglia was attenuated by the transplants. Taken together, our data indicate that hPDMC transplantation reduced cortical lesions and behavioral deficits in adult stroke rats, and these cells could serve as a unique anti-inflammatory reservoir for the treatment of ischemic brain injury.","Wu, Kou-Jen; Yu, Seong-Jin; Chiang, Chia-Wen; Cho, Kuna-Hung; Lee, Yu-Wei; Yen, B Linju; Kuo, Li-Wei; Wang, Yun",Cell transplantation,287,1

Since the first case of diagnosed COVID-19 pneumonia was reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, in December 2019, the infection has spread rapidly to all over the world. The knowledge gained from previous human coronavirus infection outbreaks suggests that pregnant women and their foetuses represent a high-risk population during infectious disease epidemics. Moreover, a pregnancy, due to the physiological changes involving immune and cardiopulmonary systems, is a state predisposing women to respiratory complications of viral infection. The constantly increasing number of publications regarding the course of COVID-19 infection in pregnant women has been published, however, the available data remains limited and many questions remain unanswered. The aim of this review was to summarize the literature data and adjusted to current recommendations regarding pregnancy care, delivery and postpartum period. An extremely important issue is the need to register all the cases of COVID-19 affected women and the course of these pregnancies to local, regional, or international registries, which will be helpful to answer many clinical and scientific questions and to create guidelines ensuring an adequate level of care for women affected by COVID-19 infection during pregnancy, delivery and during postpartum period, as well as their newborns.","Stanczyk, Patrycja; Jachymski, Tomasz; Sieroszewski, Piotr",Ginekologia polska,287,1

Although many of these fractures require surgery, nearly all are stabilized in the ED with a long leg splint or bivalved cast. Long leg splinting is often challenging for a single health care provider. Further, even with assistance or previously described techniques for fracture reduction and stabilization, fracture angulation may occur, potentially leading to pain for the patient, fracture displacement, or further soft tissue injury. The authors propose a method for splinting tibial fractures that avoids fracture angulation, is cost-effective and quick, and can be easily performed by a single health care provider.","Watkins, Colyn; Todd, Dane; Jamieson, Sarah; Mansour, Ashton",Orthopedics,287,1

Depalmitylation of mouse hepatitis virus S proteins abolished this interaction, resulting in the failure of S incorporation into virions. In contrast, an immunofluorescence assay (IFA) showed that depalmitylated severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SCoV) S proteins still co-localized with the M protein in the budding site. Here, we determined the ability of depalmitylated SCoV S mutants to incorporate S into virus-like particles (VLPs). IFA confirmed that all SCoV S mutants co-localized with the M protein intracellularly. However, the mutants lacking two cysteine residues (C(1234/1235)) failed to incorporate S into VLPs. This indicated that these palmitylated cysteines are essential for S incorporation, but are not involved in S co-localization mediated by the M protein. Our findings suggest that M-S co-localization and S incorporation occur independently of one another in SCoV virion assembly.","Ujike, Makoto; Huang, Cheng; Shirato, Kazuya; Matsuyama, Shutoku; Makino, Shinji; Taguchi, Fumihiro",The Journal of general virology,287,24

A total of 31 studies (5078 lactating women) were included in the qualitative synthesis and nine studies (872 lactating women) in the quantitative synthesis. Overall, maternal body mass index (BMI) and adiposity measurements were associated with higher HM fat and lactose concentrations at different stages of lactation, whereas protein concentration in HM did not appear to differ between overweight and/or obese and normal weight women. However, given the considerable variability in the results between studies and low quality of many of the included studies, further research is needed to establish the impact of maternal overweight and obesity on HM composition. This is particularly relevant considering potential implications of higher HM fat concentration on both growth and fat deposition during the first few months of infancy and long-term risk of obesity.","Leghi, Gabriela E; Netting, Merryn J; Middleton, Philippa F; Wlodek, Mary E; Geddes, Donna T; Muhlhausler, And Beverly S",Nutrients,287,1

MATERIALS AND METHODS A total of 100 patients 8 to 24 months old affected by distal isolated penile hypospadias were considered for this study. Patients were randomized and assigned to 2 different groups according to the suture material used during the surgical procedure (tubularized incised plate repair with or without preputial reconstruction). Polyglytone was used in group A and polydioxanone was used in group B. All patients were evaluated at 4 intervals (1 week, 1 month, 6 months and 2 years postoperatively). Persistence of sutures on penile skin, urethral fistulas, skin dehiscence, infection and skin tracks were recorded. Statistical analysis was performed using chi-square test. RESULTS Followup data documented the absence of significant differences in terms of urethral fistula rate, skin dehiscence and acute skin infection. Persistence of sutures and multiple skin tracks at long-term followup were significantly greater in patients in group B. CONCLUSIONS Both sutures are adequate for hypospadias surgery in small children. The use of a rapid absorption monofilament may allow much more rapid disappearance of the skin sutures. In the long term this outcome means almost complete absence of suture tracks. No statistically significant difference in terms of urethrocutaneous fistula was observed, suggesting that the tensile strength of polyglytone is adequate.","Guarino, Nino; Vallasciani, Santiago Andres; Marrocco, Giacinto",The Journal of urology,287,16

METHODS We enrolled 4485 patients discharged from six sub-specialty medical services. We implemented late-afternoon CAPP rounds to identify patients who could have morning discharge the subsequent day. After an initial successful implementation of the intervention, we identified lack of sustainability. We made changes with sustained implementation of the intervention. This is a before-after study of a quality improvement intervention. PROGRAM EVALUATION Primary measures of intervention effectiveness were percentage of patients who received EDO by 11am and patients discharged by noon. Additional measure of effectiveness were percent of patients admitted to the correct ward, emergency department (ED)-to-ward transfer time compared between intervention and non-intervention periods. We compared the overall expected LOS and the average weekly discharges to assess for comparability across the control and intervention time periods. We used the readmission rate as balancing measure to ensure that the intervention was not have unintended negative patients consequences. RESULTS Expected length of stay based upon discharge diagnosis/comorbidities and readmission rates were similar across the intervention and control time periods. The average weekly discharges were not statistically significant. Percentage of EDO by 11 am was higher in the first intervention period, second intervention period and combined intervention periods (28.9% vs. 21.8%, P<0.001) compared with the respective control periods. Percent discharged before noon increased in the first intervention period, second intervention period and for the combined intervention periods (17 vs. 11.8%, P <0.001). There was no difference in the percent admitted to the correct ward and ED-to-ward transfer time. CONCLUSION Afternoon CAPP rounds to identify early patient discharges the following day led to increase in EDO entered by 11 am and discharges by noon without an adverse change in readmission rates and LOS.","Kher, Sucharita; Haas, Mark; Schelling, Kimberly; Wright, Seth; Allison, Harmony; Poutsiaka, Debra D; Roberts, Kari E; Chang, Hong; Salem, Deeb N; Kopelman, Richard; Freund, Karen M",Hospital practice,287,12

This study aimed to assess whether (i) continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) applied during stair climbing prevents dynamic hyperinflation and thereby reduces exercise-induced dyspnea in oxygen-dependent COPD-patients, and (ii) the CPAP-device and oxygen tank can be carried in a hip belt. In a randomised cross-over design, oxygen-dependent COPD patients performed two stair-climbing tests (44 steps): with supplemental oxygen only, then with the addition of CPAP (7 mbar). The oxygen tank and CPAP-device were carried in a hip belt during both trials. Eighteen COPD patients were included in the study. Although all patients could tolerate stair climbing with oxygen alone, 4 patients were unable to perform stair climbing while using CPAP. Fourteen COPD patients (mean FEV1 36 ± 14% pred.) completed the trial and were analyzed. The mean flow rate of supplemental oxygen was 3 ± 2 l/min during stair climbing. Lung hyperinflation, deoxygenation, hypoventilation, blood lactate production, dyspnea and the time needed to manage stair climbing were not improved by the application of CPAP (all p > 0.05). However, in comparison to climbing with oxygen alone, limb discomfort was reduced when oxygen was supplemented with CPAP (p = 0.008). In conclusion, very severe COPD patients are able to carry supporting devices such as oxygen tanks or CPAP-devices in a hip belt during stair climbing. However, the application of CPAP in addition to supplemental oxygen during stair climbing prevents neither exercise-induced dynamic hyperinflation, nor dyspnea.","Walterspacher, Stephan; Walker, David J; Kabitz, Hans-Joachim; Windisch, Wolfram; Dreher, Michael",COPD,287,1

A Clinical Evaluation of Two ACT Monitors.,14.597722,6.756206,2020-09-01,"BACKGROUND Sleeve gastrectomy is a restrictive procedure for treatment of obese patients with different body mass index (BMI) and presents good results in terms of a reduction of percentage of excess weight loss and BMI. There is no consensus which is the optimal technique regarding to the diameter of the gastric tube, but a capacity of 100-120 ml has been suggested. In this prospective study, we compare the gastric capacity evaluated with barium sulfate or computer-aided tomography (CAT) scan early and 24 months after operation compared to the changes in body weight and BMI reduction in a small group of 15 consecutive patients submitted to sleeve gastrectomy. METHODS Fifteen successive obese patients submitted to laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy were included. They were studied in order to measure the residual gastric capacity with barium sulfate and CAT scan early (3 days) and late (2 years) after surgery. RESULTS The early postoperative gastric volume was 108 +/- 25 ml (80-120 ml) and 116.2 +/- 78.24 assessed with barium sulfate and CAT scan, respectively. The gastric capacity at the late control increased to 250 +/- 85 and 254 +/- 56.8 assessed with the same techniques. However, patients remained stable with a BMI close to 25 without regain of weight at least at the time of observation. CONCLUSIONS Gastric capacity can increase late after sleeve gastrectomy even after performing a narrow gastric tubulization. It is very important to measure objectively residual gastric volume after sleeve gastrectomy and its eventual increase in order to determine the late clinical results and to indicate eventual strategy for retreatment.","Braghetto, Italo; Cortes, Claudio; Herquiñigo, David; Csendes, Paula; Rojas, Alejandro; Mushle, Maher; Korn, Owen; Valladares, Héctor; Csendes, Attila; Maria Burgos, Ana; Papapietro, Karin",Obesity surgery,287,31

During POEM, carbon dioxide (CO2) is insufflated to aid surgical dissection, but it may inadvertently track into surrounding tissues, causing systemic CO2 uptake and tension capnoperitoneum. This in turn may affect cardiorespiratory function. This study quantified these cardiorespiratory effects and treatment by hyperventilation and percutaneous abdominal needle decompression (PND). METHODS One hundred and seventy-three consecutive patients who underwent POEM were included in this four-year retrospective study. Procedure-related changes in peak inspiratory pressure (pmax), end-tidal CO2 levels (etCO2), minute ventilation (MV), mean arterial pressure (MAP), and heart rate (HR) were analyzed. We also quantified the impact of PND on these cardiorespiratory parameters. RESULTS During the endoscopic procedure, cardiorespiratory parameters increased from baseline: pmax 15.1 (4.5) vs 19.8 (4.7) cm H2O; etCO2 4.5 (0.4) vs 5.5 (0.9) kPa [34.0 (2.9) vs 41.6 (6.9) mmHg]; MAP 73.9 (9.7) vs 99.3 (15.2) mmHg; HR 67.6 (12.4) vs 85.3 (16.4) min-1 (P < 0.001 for each). Hyperventilation [MV 5.9 (1.2) vs 9.0 (1.8) L·min-1, P < 0.001] was applied to counteract iatrogenic hypercapnia. Individuals with tension capnoperitoneum treated with PND (n = 55) had higher peak pmax values [22.8 (5.7) vs 18.4 (3.3) cm H2O, P < 0.001] than patients who did not require PND. After PND, pmax [22.8 (5.7) vs 19.9 (4.3) cm H2O, P = 0.045] and MAP [98.2 (16.3) vs 88.6 (11.8) mmHg, P = 0.013] decreased. Adverse events included pneumothorax (n = 1), transient myocardial ischemia (n = 1), and subcutaneous emphysema (n = 49). The latter precluded immediate extubation in eight cases. Postanesthesia care unit (PACU) stay was longer in individuals with subcutaneous emphysema than in those without [74.9 min (34.5) vs 61.5 (26.8 min), P = 0.007]. CONCLUSION Carbon dioxide insufflation during POEM produces systemic CO2 uptake and increased intra-abdominal pressure. Changes in cardiorespiratory parameters include increased pmax, etCO2, MAP, and HR. Hyperventilation and PND help mitigate some of these changes. Subcutaneous emphysema is common and may delay extubation and prolong PACU stay.","Löser, Benjamin; Werner, Yuki B; Punke, Mark A; Saugel, Bernd; Haas, Sebastian; Reuter, Daniel A; Mann, Oliver; Duprée, Anna; Schachschal, Guido; Rösch, Thomas; Petzoldt, Martin",Canadian journal of anaesthesia = Journal canadien d'anesthesie,287,1

This study aims to determine the incidence of, risk factors for, and clinical outcomes of capsule retention in a large heterogenous cohort of patients and define cross-sectional imaging findings predictive of capsule retention. METHODS A retrospective review of all capsule endoscopy (CE) examinations performed at our center from January 2002 to January 2013 was undertaken. Data on patient demographics, CE indication, findings, and details of management were analyzed. Radiologic images of patients with computed tomography scan performed 6 months before CE for patients with CE retention and for controls without CE retention but at high risk based on clinical computed tomography reports were examined by a gastrointestinal radiologist, blinded to history, and classified as worrisome based on the presence of stricture, partial obstruction, or small bowel (SB) anastomosis. RESULTS Seventeen CE retentions (0.3%) occurred in 15 patients. Obscure gastrointestinal bleeding (47%) was the most common indication. Outcomes included surgical intervention (n = 10), endoscopic retrieval (n = 2), passing of capsule after treatment of inflammation (n = 3), passage after conservative measures for SB obstruction (n = 1), and loss to follow-up (n = 1). Patients with CE retention were more likely to have SB anastomoses (88% versus 23%) and partial obstruction (63% versus 38%) than patients with high-risk features for capsule retention who passed the capsule. CONCLUSIONS In a tertiary care population without obstructive symptoms, capsule retention occurred in only 0.3% of cases. Review of surgical history and prior imaging for obstruction or SB anastomoses may help to reduce retention.","Al-Bawardy, Badr; Locke, Giles; Huprich, James E; Fletcher, Joel G; Fidler, Jeff L; Barlow, John M; Becker, Brenda; Rajan, Elizabeth; Loftus, Edward V; Bruining, David H; Hansel, Stephanie L",Inflammatory bowel diseases,287,27

In addition, lpp(T) RNA, with a sequence identical to the decay intermediate of lpp mRNA and a triphosphate at 5'-end, was also destabilized by Srd. The destabilization of these RNAs by Srd was not observed in RNase E-defective cells. The initial cleavage of a primary transcript by RNase E can be either direct or dependent on the 5'-end of transcript. In the latter case, host RppH is required to convert the triphosphate at 5'-end to a monophosphate. lpp(T) RNA, but not lpp and ompA mRNAs, required RppH for Srd-stimulated degradation, indicating that Srd stimulates both 5'-end-dependent and -independent cleavage activities of RNase E. Furthermore, pull-down and immunoprecipitation analyses strongly suggested that Srd physically associates with the N-terminal half of RNase E containing the catalytic moiety and the membrane target sequence. Finally, the growth of T4 phage was significantly decreased by the disruption of srd. These results strongly suggest that the stimulation of RNase E activity by T4 Srd is required for efficient phage growth.","Qi, Dan; Alawneh, Abdulraheem M; Yonesaki, Tetsuro; Otsuka, Yuichi",Genetics,287,26

In the words of the novelist scholar Arundhati Roy, the COVID-19 pandemic is not merely an epic calamity. It has opened up a new space, a portal, to rethink everything, for example, in how we live, work, produce scientific knowledge, provide health care, and relate to others, be they humans or nonhuman animals in planetary ecosystems. Meanwhile, as the intensity of the pandemic escalates, digital health tools such as the Internet of Things (IoT), biosensors, and artificial intelligence (AI) are being deployed to address the twin goals of social distancing and health care in a ""no touch"" emergency state. Permanent integration of digital technologies into every aspect of post-pandemic civic life-health care, disease tracking, education, work, and beyond-is considered by governments and technology actors around the world. Although digital transformation of health care and industry are in the works, we ought to ensure that digital transformation does not degenerate into ""digitalism,"" which we define here as an unchecked and misguided belief on extreme digital connectivity without considering the attendant adverse repercussions on science, human rights, and everyday practices of democracy. Indeed, the current shrinking of the critically informed public policy space amid a devastating pandemic raises principled questions on the broader and long-term impacts that digital technologies will have on democratic governance of planetary health and society. To this end, a wide range of uncertainties-technical, biological, temporal, spatial, and political-is on the COVID-19 pandemic horizon. This calls for astute and anticipatory innovation policies to steer the health sciences and services toward democratic ends. In this article, we describe new and critically informed approaches to democratize COVID-19 digital health innovation policy, especially when the facts are uncertain, the stakes are high, and decisions are urgent, as they often are in the course of a pandemic. In addition, we introduce a potential remedy to democratize pandemic innovation policy, the concept of ""epistemic competence,"" so as to check the frames and framings of the pandemic innovation policy juggernaut and the attendant power asymmetries. We suggest that if epistemic competence, and attention to not only scientific knowledge but also its framing are broadly appreciated, they can help reduce the disparity between the enormous technical progress and investments made in digital health versus our currently inadequate understanding of the societal dimensions of emerging technologies such as AI, IoT, and extreme digital connectivity on the planet.","Bayram, Mustafa; Springer, Simon; Garvey, Colin K; Özdemir, Vural",Omics : a journal of integrative biology,287,25

It is, however, not known whether LVR influences sexual function (SF). The aim of this study was, therefore, to determine the impact of this procedure on the SF of patients. METHODS All female patients after LVR procedure in a single institution were identified and were sent a questionnaire concerning SF. This addressed sexual activity, satisfaction, preoperative SF, and the impact of surgery on SF. Furthermore, the PISQ-12 validated sexual functioning questionnaire was sent to all female patients. RESULTS A total of 217 patients were sent a questionnaire. These patients underwent LVR for rectal prolapse, symptomatic rectocele, or enterocele between 2004 and 2011. Mean age was 62 years (range 22-89). Mean follow-up was 30 months (range 5-83). Response rate was 64 % (139 patients). The number of sexual active patients dropped from 71 to 54 % after surgery. The number of patients being satisfied with their SF remained relatively equal; 91 % of patients before and 85 % of patients after surgery. Forty-three percent of patients stated that the LVR procedure did not influence their sexual function, in 16 % of patients, the procedure positively influenced their SF, and in 13 % of respondents, SF decreased after surgery. The mean PISQ-12 score postoperatively was 34 out of 48. CONCLUSIONS The impact of LVR on SF of patients seems limited in this cross-sectional study in a large cohort of patients.","Formijne Jonkers, H A; Poierrié, N; Draaisma, W A; Broeders, I A M J; Consten, E C J",International journal of colorectal disease,287,16

Possible interaction of SARS-CoV-2 with DPP4 peptidase may partly contribute to the viral pathogenesis. An integrative bioinformatics approach starting with mining the biomedical literature for high confidence DPP4-protein/gene associations followed by functional analysis using network analysis and pathway enrichment was adopted. The results indicate that the identified DPP4 networks are highly enriched in viral processes required for viral entry and infection, and as a result, we propose DPP4 as an important putative target for the treatment of COVID-19. Additionally, our protein-chemical interaction networks identified important interactions between DPP4 and sitagliptin. We conclude that sitagliptin may be beneficial for the treatment of COVID-19 disease, either as monotherapy or in combination with other therapies, especially for diabetic patients and patients with pre-existing cardiovascular conditions who are already at higher risk of COVID-19 mortality.","Bardaweel, Sanaa K; Hajjo, Rima; Sabbah, Dima A",Acta pharmaceutica,287,10

Newly formed centrioles remain associated with their mother centrioles. The two centrioles disengage at the end of mitosis, which licenses centriole duplication in the next cell cycle. Therefore, timely centriole disengagement is critical for the proper centriole duplication cycle. However, the mechanisms underlying centriole engagement during interphase are poorly understood. Here, we show that Cep57 and Cep57L1 cooperatively maintain centriole engagement during interphase. Codepletion of Cep57 and Cep57L1 induces precocious centriole disengagement in interphase without compromising cell cycle progression. The disengaged daughter centrioles convert into centrosomes during interphase in a Plk1-dependent manner. Furthermore, the centrioles reduplicate and the centriole number increases, which results in chromosome segregation errors. Overall, these findings demonstrate that the maintenance of centriole engagement by Cep57 and Cep57L1 during interphase is crucial for the tight control of centriole copy number and thus for proper chromosome segregation.","Ito, Kei K; Watanabe, Koki; Ishida, Haruki; Matsuhashi, Kyohei; Chinen, Takumi; Hata, Shoji; Kitagawa, Daiju",The Journal of cell biology,287,19

Despite intensive years of research, the etiology of this neurological disorder remains elusive. Nevertheless, the abundance of immune cells such as T lymphocytes and their products in CNS lesions of MS patients supports the notion that MS is an immune-mediated disorder. An important body of evidence gathered from MS animal models such as experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), points to the central contribution of CD4 T lymphocytes in disease pathogenesis. Both Th1 (producing interferon-γ) and Th17 (producing interleukin 17) CD4 T lymphocytes targeting CNS self-antigens have been implicated in MS and EAE pathobiology. Moreover, several publications suggest that CD8 T lymphocytes also participate in the development of MS lesions. The migration of activated T lymphocytes from the periphery into the CNS has been identified as a crucial step in the formation of MS lesions. Several factors promote such T cell extravasation including: molecules (e.g., cell adhesion molecules) implicated in the T cell-blood brain barrier interaction, and chemokines produced by neural cells. Finally, once in the CNS, T lymphocytes need to be reactivated by local antigen presenting cells prior to enter the parenchyma where they can initiate damage. Further investigations will be necessary to elucidate the impact of environmental factors (e.g., gut microbiota) and CNS intrinsic properties (e.g., microglial activation) on this inflammatory neurological disease.","Legroux, Laurine; Arbour, Nathalie",Journal of neuroimmune pharmacology : the official journal of the Society on NeuroImmune Pharmacology,287,16

METHODS Fifteen consecutive patients (three men and twelve women, with a mean age of twenty-two years) with seventeen knees were matched by sex and age to thirty-two reference subjects in this prospective study. The follow-up period was a minimum of twenty-four months. The medial patellofemoral ligament reconstruction used an autograft semitendinosus tendon and an interference screw system with or without lateral release under 10 N of laterally directed force. The medial patellar stiffness and lateral patellar stiffness were measured in 0° of knee extension using the Patella Stability Tester preoperatively; postoperatively at three, six, twelve, and eighteen months; and at the time of the latest follow-up. Before and after the surgical procedure, patients were evaluated for apprehension and Kujala and Lysholm scores; radiographic examinations were performed to evaluate changes, including osteoarthritic changes. RESULTS The medial stiffness of the affected side before the surgical procedure was significantly lower than the lateral stiffness (p = 0.004) and the stiffness for healthy reference knees (p = 0.004). Medial stiffness three months after the surgical procedure was significantly elevated compared with lateral values (p = 0.027), preoperative values (p < 0.001), and reference group values (p = 0.002); reached the reference level by six months; and was maintained for up to two years. Furthermore, medial stiffness and lateral stiffness were well balanced after six months and this balance was sustained for up to two years postoperatively. No recurrent dislocation occurred during the follow-up period; one patient experienced apprehension. Postoperative radiographic findings and clinical scores were significantly improved at the time of the latest follow-up (p < 0.05). One knee progressed to patellofemoral osteoarthritis. CONCLUSIONS The value for medial stiffness was significantly improved three months after medial patellofemoral ligament reconstruction compared with the preoperative and lateral values and returned to the reference level by six months. Medial stiffness and lateral stiffness of the patella were well balanced by six months and retained that balance for up to two years, with good clinical results.

Although it is now well established that leukocyte extravasation elicits the inflammation typically associated with FIP lesions, relatively few studies have aimed at elucidating this key pathogenic event. The upregulation of adhesion molecules on the endothelium is a prerequisite for stable leukocyte-endothelial cell (EC) adhesion that necessarily precedes leukocyte diapedesis. Therefore, the present work focused on the expression of the EC adhesion molecules and possible triggers of EC activation during the development of FIP. Immunofluorescence analysis revealed that the endothelial expression of P-selectin, E-selectin, intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) and vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1) was elevated in veins close to granulomatous infiltrates in the renal cortex of FIP patients compared to non-infiltrated regions and specimens from healthy cats. Next, we showed that feline venous ECs become activated when exposed to supernatant from feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV)-infected monocytes, as indicated by increased adhesion molecule expression. Active viral replication seemed to be required to induce the EC-stimulating activity in monocytes. Finally, adhesion assays revealed an increased adhesion of naive monocytes to ECs treated with supernatant from FIPV-infected monocytes. Taken together, our results strongly indicate that FIPV activates ECs to increase monocyte adhesion by an indirect route, in which proinflammatory factors released from virus-infected monocytes act as key intermediates.","Acar, Delphine D; Olyslaegers, Dominique A J; Dedeurwaerder, Annelike; Roukaerts, Inge D M; Baetens, Wendy; Van Bockstael, Sebastiaan; De Gryse, Gaëtan M A; Desmarets, Lowiese M B; Nauwynck, Hans J",The Journal of general virology,287,24

Much of this is due to a greater awareness of disease as a cause of mortality in some of our highly threatened species or as a limiting factor to the successful captive rearing of intensely managed species such as hihi (Notiomystis cincta), kiwi (Apteryx spp.) and kakapo (Strigops habroptilus). An important factor contributing to the increase of our knowledge has been the development of new diagnostic techniques in the fields of molecular biology and immunohistochemistry, particularly for the diagnosis and epidemiology of viral and protozoan diseases. Although New Zealand remains free of serious exotic viruses there has been much work on understanding the taxonomy and epidemiology of local strains of avipox virus and circoviruses. Bacterial diseases such as salmonellosis, erysipelas and tuberculosis have also been closely investigated in wildlife and opportunist mycotic infections such as aspergillosis remain a major problem in many species. Nutritional diseases such as hyperplastic goitre due to iodine deficiency and metabolic bone disease due to Ca:P imbalance have made significant impacts on some captive reared birds, while lead poisoning is a problem in some localities. The increasing use of wildlife translocations to avoid the extinction of threatened species has highlighted the need for improved methods to assess the disease risks inherent in these operations and other intensive conservation management strategies such as creching young animals. We have also become more aware of the likelihood of inbreeding suppression as populations of many species decrease or pass through a genetic bottleneck. Climate change and habitat loss, however, remain the greatest threats to biodiversity and wildlife health worldwide. Temperature changes will affect our wildlife habitats, alter the distribution of disease vectors and wildlife predators, or directly harm threatened species in vulnerable localities.","Alley, M R; Gartrell, B D",New Zealand veterinary journal,287,16

Traditionally, accessory auricles are managed by paediatricians with suture ligation at the base of the accessory auricle to induce ischaemic necrosis (Mehmi et al, 2007). This method can be associated with complications and poor cosmesis thus leading to the vogue of surgical excision ( Frieden et al, 1995; Sebben, 1989). We present our experience in managing these lesions in children with the application of a titanium clip in a one-stop outpatient setting. Methods. Data was collected retrospectively through review of patient records and telephone questionnaire identifying outcomes from the parents' perspective. Results. Of 42 patients, 24 (57.1%) responded. Eleven (26.2%) underwent surgical excision, 6 (14.3%) had no intervention, and 1 (2.4%) was not contactable. All parents were happy with the outcome and would recommend this management to other parents. Twenty-three (96%) had no complications apart from a tiny residual nubbin, which was considered cosmetically acceptable. One child had a residual nubbin that grew in size requiring surgical excision at later stage. Conclusion. Management of accessory auricles by the application of a titanium clip in one-stop outpatient setting is safe, simple, quick, and well tolerated with no need for admission, anaesthesia, or followup due to the low complication rate.","Wong, Phui Yee; Laing, Tereze; Milroy, Catherine",Plastic surgery international,287,30

For this, professors should plan how to insert this knowledge into the program content of their discipline. OBJECTIVE This commentary aims to present how this insertion will be conducted in the second academic semester of 2020 in the discipline ""Productive Systems"" of the mechanical engineering undergraduate course offered by a Brazilian university. METHODS This commentary is based on the authors' points of view and experiences. However, the presented discussion is based on institutional websites and international articles. RESULTS It is possible to verify that human factors and ergonomic aspects related to the pandemic can be debated in several topics of the analyzed discipline. CONCLUSIONS Besides presenting the planning of inserting these aspects, this commentary expands the debates on the subject.","Anholon, Rosley; Rampasso, Izabela Simon; Cooper Ordóñez, Robert E",Work,287,29

Strong immunological responses induced by T cells are associated with HBV clearance during acute infection; however, the repertoire of epitopes (epi) presented by major histocompatibility complexes (MHCs) to elicit these responses in various African populations is not well understood. In silico approaches were used to map and investigate 15-mers HBV peptides restricted to 9 HLA class II alleles with high population coverage in Botswana. Sequences from 44 HBV genotype A and 48 genotype D surface genes (PreS/S) from Botswana were used. Of the 1819 epi bindings predicted, 20.2% were strong binders (SB), and none of the putative epi bind to all the 9 alleles suggesting that multi-epitope, genotype-based, population-based vaccines will be more effective against HBV infections as opposed to previously proposed broad potency epitope-vaccines which were assumed to work for all alleles. In total, there were 297 unique epi predicted from the 3 proteins and amongst, S regions had the highest number of epi (n = 186). Epitope-densities (Depi) between genotypes A and D were similar. A number of mutations that hindered HLA-peptide binding were observed. We also identified antigenic and genotype-specific peptides with characteristics that are well suited for the development of sensitive diagnostic kits. This study identified candidate peptides that can be used for developing multi-epitope vaccines and highly sensitive diagnostic kits against HBV infection in an African population. Our results suggest that viral variability may hinder HBV peptide-MHC binding, required to initiate a cascade of immunological responses against infection.","Choga, Wonderful Tatenda; Anderson, Motswedi; Zumbika, Edward; Phinius, Bonolo B; Mbangiwa, Tshepiso; Bhebhe, Lynnette N; Baruti, Kabo; Kimathi, Peter Opiyo; Seatla, Kaelo K; Musonda, Rosemary M; Bell, Trevor Graham; Moyo, Sikhulile; Blackard, Jason T; Gaseitsiwe, Simani",Viruses,287,17

KIF23 over-expression in cancer has been associated with tumor growth, progression, and poor prognosis, indicating a potential to be a cancer biomarker. A mutation in KIF23 (c.2747C > G, p.P916R) was shown to cause congenital dyserythropoietic anemia, type III (CDA III). To-date, fifteen KIF23 transcripts have been annotated, but their expression is poorly investigated. We hypothesized that tissue specific expression of a particular transcript can be critical for CDA III phenotype. In this study, we quantified expression of alternative Kif23 transcripts in a mouse model with human KIF23 mutation and investigated its association with a regulator of alternative splicing, serine/arginine-rich splicing factor 3 (Srsf3). We confirmed presence of an additional exon 8 in both human and mouse KIF23 transcripts. A transcript lacking exons 17 and 18 was ubiquitously expressed in mice while other isoforms were common in human tissues however in bone marrow of knock-in mice a transcript without exon 18 was prevalent as it was in bone marrow of a CDA III patient. We conclude that the possibility that the tissue specific expression of KIF23 alternative transcripts influence the CDA III phenotype cannot be neglected.","Vikberg, Ann-Louise; Malla, Sandhya; Golovleva, Irina","Blood cells, molecules & diseases",287,16

Three single-center randomized trials reported no significantly different or improved outcomes for patients who received general anesthesia compared with procedural sedation. Objective To detect differences in functional outcome at 3 months between patients who received general anesthesia vs procedural sedation during thrombectomy for anterior circulation acute ischemic stroke. Data Source MEDLINE search for English-language articles published from January 1, 1980, to July 31, 2019. Study Selection Randomized clinical trials of adults with a National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score of at least 10 and anterior circulation acute ischemic stroke assigned to receive general anesthesia or procedural sedation during thrombectomy. Data Extraction and Synthesis Individual patient data were obtained from 3 single-center, randomized, parallel-group, open-label treatment trials with blinded end point evaluation that met inclusion criteria and were analyzed using fixed-effects meta-analysis. Main Outcomes and Measures Degree of disability, measured via the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score (range 0-6; lower scores indicate less disability), analyzed with the common odds ratio (cOR) to detect the ordinal shift in the distribution of disability over the range of mRS scores. Results A total of 368 patients (mean [SD] age, 71.5 [12.9] years; 163 [44.3%] women; median [interquartile range] National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score, 17 [14-21]) were included in the analysis, including 183 (49.7%) who received general anesthesia and 185 (50.3%) who received procedural sedation. The mean 3-month mRS score was 2.8 (95% CI, 2.5-3.1) in the general anesthesia group vs 3.2 (95% CI, 3.0-3.5) in the procedural sedation group (difference, 0.43 [95% CI, 0.03-0.83]; cOR, 1.58 [95% CI, 1.09-2.29]; P = .02). Among prespecified adverse events, only hypotension (decline in systolic blood pressure of more than 20% from baseline) (80.8% vs 53.1%; OR, 4.26 [95% CI, 2.55-7.09]; P < .001) and blood pressure variability (systolic blood pressure >180 mm Hg or <120 mm Hg) (79.7 vs 62.3%; OR, 2.42 [95% CI, 1.49-3.93]; P < .001) were significantly more common in the general anesthesia group. Conclusions and Relevance Among patients with acute ischemic stroke involving the anterior circulation undergoing thrombectomy, the use of protocol-based general anesthesia, compared with procedural sedation, was significantly associated with less disability at 3 months. These findings should be interpreted tentatively, given that the individual trials examined were single-center trials and disability was the primary outcome in only 1 trial.","Schönenberger, Silvia; Hendén, Pia Löwhagen; Simonsen, Claus Z; Uhlmann, Lorenz; Klose, Christina; Pfaff, Johannes A R; Yoo, Albert J; Sørensen, Leif H; Ringleb, Peter A; Wick, Wolfgang; Kieser, Meinhard; Möhlenbruch, Markus A; Rasmussen, Mads; Rentzos, Alexandros; Bösel, Julian",JAMA,287,12

The aim of this systematic review was to review financial and/or economic assessment studies of prevention and/or mitigation activities of BVDV at national, regional and farm level worldwide. Once all predefined criteria had been met, 35 articles were included for this systematic review. Studies were analyzed with particular focus on the type of financially and/or economically-assessed prevention and/or mitigation activities. Due to the wide range of possible prevention and/or mitigation activities, these activities were grouped into five categories: i) control and/or eradication programs, ii) monitoring or surveillance, iii) prevention, iv) vaccination and v) individual culling, control and testing strategies. Additionally, the studies were analyzed according to economically-related variables such as efficiency, costs or benefits of prevention and/or mitigation activities, the applied financial and/or economic and statistical methods, the payers of prevention and/or mitigation activities, the assessed production systems, and the countries for which such evaluations are available. Financial and/or economic assessments performed in Europe were dominated by those from the United Kingdom, which assessed mostly vaccination strategies, and Norway which primarily carried out assessments in the area of control and eradication programs; whereas among non-European countries the United States carried out the majority of financial and/or economic assessments in the area of individual culling, control and testing. More than half of all studies provided an efficiency calculation of prevention and/or mitigation activities and demonstrated whether the inherent costs of implemented activities were or were not justified. The dairy sector was three times more likely to be assessed by the countries than beef production systems. In addition, the dairy sector was approximately eight times more likely to be assessed economically with respect to prevention and/or mitigation activities than calf and youngstock production systems. Furthermore, the private sector was identified as the primary payer of prevention and/or mitigation activities. This systematic review demonstrated a lack of studies relating to efficiency calculations, in particular at national and regional level, and the specific production systems. Thus, we confirmed the need for more well-designed studies in animal health economics in order to demonstrate that the implementation and inherent costs of BVDV prevention and/or mitigation activities are justified.","Pinior, Beate; Firth, Clair L; Richter, Veronika; Lebl, Karin; Trauffler, Martine; Dzieciol, Monika; Hutter, Sabine E; Burgstaller, Johann; Obritzhauser, Walter; Winter, Petra; Käsbohrer, Annemarie",Preventive veterinary medicine,287,6

Percutaneous microwave ablation (MWA) showed same benefits and some advantages over radiofrequency ablation (RFA). To date, a disadvantage of both was the not totally predictable size and shape of ablation volume. The aim of this study was to assess feasibility and safety of MWA in nonresectable pancreatic head cancer using a new technology of MW with high power (100 W) and frequency of 2,450 MH. Methods Five patients with pancreatic head cancer treated with percutaneous MWA under ultrasound guidance were retrospectively reviewed. Mean lesion diameter was 27.8 mm (range, 25-32 mm). Follow-up was performed by CT after 1, 3, 6 and, when possible, 12 months. The shape of the ablation volume was evaluated with multiplanar reformatting (MPR) using roundness index (RI): a value near 1 represents a more spherical ablation zone shape, and a value distant from 1 implies an oval configuration. Ablation and procedure times were registered, together with hospital stay. The feasibility, safety and quality of life (QoL) were reported. Results The procedure was feasible in all patients (100%). A spherical shape of ablation zone was achieved in all cases (mean RI =0.97). Mean ablation and procedure time were respectively of 2.48 and 28 minutes. Mean hospital stay was 4 days. No major complications were observed. Minor complications resolved during the hospital stay. An improvement in QoL was observed in all patients despite a tendency to return to preoperative levels in the months following the procedure. Conclusions Percutaneous MWA is a feasible and safe approach for the palliative treatment of advanced stage tumors of the head of the pancreas, despite its complex anatomic relations. The spherical shape of the ablation volume could be related with an improving of the effectiveness and safety.","Ierardi, Anna Maria; Biondetti, Pierpaolo; Coppola, Andrea; Fumarola, Enrico Maria; Biasina, Alberto Magenta; Alessio Angileri, Salvatore; Carrafiello, Gianpaolo",Gland surgery,287,1

METHODS From January 2010 to June 2015, 39 patients with MCO received SEMS, TDT, and ESFD. We evaluated the outcomes including success rates of placement, clinical outcomes after decompression, and histopathologic findings of the resected specimens. RESULTS Technical success rates were 100% for SEMS and 78.9% for TDT. Clinical success rates were 100% for SEMS and 80.0% for TDT. Postoperative ileus was significantly less frequent after SEMS than after TDT (p = 0.014). Histopathologic edema grade was significantly lower for SEMS than for TDT and ESFD (p < 0.0001). There was no significant difference between edema grade and duration of decompression in the TDT group (p = 0.629), while all patients with SEMS were classified in a low edema grade (grade 0-2). The rate of stoma creation was significantly higher in patients with a high edema grade (grade 3) than in those with a low edema grade (grade 0-2) (p = 0.003). There was no microscopic perforation in any group. CONCLUSION Significantly greater resolution of histopathologic edema was achieved after placement of SEMS than after placement of TDT.

Minimally invasive ablation modalities, including cryoablation, radiofrequencey ablation, microwave ablation and irreversible electroporation, are currently being used to treat SRMs in select groups of patients. Cryoablation and radiofrequency ablation have been extensively studied. Presently, cryoablation is gaining popularity because the resulting ice ball can be visualized easily using ultrasonography. Tumour size and location are strong predictors of outcome of radiofrequency ablation. One of the main benefits of microwave ablation is that microwaves can propagate through all types of tissue, including desiccated and charred tissue, as well as water vapour, which might be formed during the ablation. Irreversible electroporation has been shown in animal studies to affect only the cell membrane of undesirable target tissues and to spare adjacent structures; however, clinical studies that depict the efficacy and safety of this treatment modality in humans are still sparse. As more experience is gained in the future, ablation modalities might be utilized in all patients with tumours <4 cm in diameter, rather than just as an alternative treatment for high-risk surgical patients.","Castro, Arturo; Jenkins, Lawrence C; Salas, Nelson; Lorber, Gideon; Leveillee, Raymond J",Nature reviews.

METHODS Eighty-eight patients with clinical stage I gastric cancer underwent LTG in our hospitals (n = 55) and affiliated hospitals (n = 33). Esophagojejunostomy was performed intracoporeally using a circular stapler with an incision in the left upper abdomen. We investigated the patients' clinicopathologic factor, and evaluated the effect of hospital volume on short-term outcomes. RESULTS Fixed insertion of the anvil head was successfully achieved in all patients (lift-up method in 58 patients and transoral method in 28 patients), although 2 patients were converted to open surgery. The approach using a circular stapler through a small incision from the upper left quadrant of the abdomen facilitated a good laparoscopic visual field for the plane of the esophagojejunostomy. Fourteen patients developed Clavien-Dindo classification grade II or more postoperative complications, and the overall operative morbidity rate was 15.9 %. No anastomotic leakage was encountered in this series. No significant difference was observed in clinical outcomes between patients in the high- and low-volume hospital groups.

We previously detected the nucleic acids of bacterial pathogens in EBC. Influenza viruses can be transmitted through aerosols during coughing and exhaling. Existing detection methods for influenza have various limitations. The EBC collection method is convenient, non-invasive, and reduces the risk of exposure. We investigated the detection of influenza virus in EBC using a sensitive nucleic acid testing method and performed quantitative analysis to evaluate the present and content of influenza virus in the breath. We evaluated 30 patients with respiratory tract infection during the 2019 influenza season. The clinical data and samples of nasal swabs were collected for rapid influenza diagnostic (antigen) tests. Pharyngeal swab and EBC samples were used for influenza virus nucleic acid detection. Each EBC sample was assessed twice as well as at one-month follow-up of the patients. The nucleic acid test in the EBC of 30 cases revealed 20 and two cases of influenza A and B, respectively, giving a detection rate of 73.3%. The rapid influenza diagnostic (antigen) tests revealed four and 12 cases of influenza A and B, respectively, with a detection rate of 53.3%. All pharyngeal swab samples evaluated by the nucleic acid test were influenza-positive; 12 cases were positive for both influenza A and B and 18 cases were positive for influenza B alone. The influenza viral load in the EBC was 103-107 copies ml-1. Among the 16 patients followed-up after 1 month, 4 were positive (25%) in EBC samples and 10 were positive (62.5%) in pharyngeal swab samples.

In the event of an influenza pandemic, logistical and practical implications such as storage and fit testing will restrict the use of RPDs to certain high-risk procedures that are likely to generate large amounts of infectious bioaerosols. Studies have shown that in such circumstances increased numbers of surgical masks are worn, but the protection afforded to the wearer by a surgical mask against infectious aerosols is not well understood. AIM To develop and apply a method for assessing the protection afforded by surgical masks against a bioaerosol challenge. METHODS A dummy test head attached to a breathing simulator was used to test the performance of surgical masks against a viral challenge. Several designs of surgical masks commonly used in the UK healthcare sector were evaluated by measuring levels of inert particles and live aerosolised influenza virus in the air, from in front of and behind each mask. FINDINGS Live influenza virus was measurable from the air behind all surgical masks tested. The data indicate that a surgical mask will reduce exposure to aerosolised infectious influenza virus; reductions ranged from 1.1- to 55-fold (average 6-fold), depending on the design of the mask. CONCLUSION We describe a workable method to evaluate the protective efficacy of surgical masks and RPDs against a relevant aerosolised biological challenge. The results demonstrated limitations of surgical masks in this context, although they are to some extent protective.","Makison Booth, C; Clayton, M; Crook, B; Gawn, J M",The Journal of hospital infection,287,27

On the basis of conflicting results from the two available studies, the panel rated the quality of the evidence, the harm-to-benefit ratio, patient preferences, and costs. Finally, the panel, including representatives from a patient advocate group (International Kidney Cancer Coalition) voted and reached a consensus to not recommend adjuvant therapy with sunitinib for patients with high-risk RCC after nephrectomy. PATIENT SUMMARY In two studies, sunitinib was given for 1 yr and compared to no active treatment (placebo) in patients who had their kidney tumour removed and who had a high risk of cancer coming back after surgery. Although one study demonstrated that 1 yr of sunitinib therapy resulted in a 1.2-yr longer time before the disease recurred, the other study did not show a benefit and it has not been shown that patients live longer. Despite having been diagnosed with high-risk disease, many patients remain without recurrence, and the side effects of sunitinib are high. Therefore, the panel members, including patient representatives, do not recommend sunitinib after tumour removal in these patients.","Bex, Axel; Albiges, Laurence; Ljungberg, Börje; Bensalah, Karim; Dabestani, Saeed; Giles, Rachel H; Hofmann, Fabian; Hora, Milan; Kuczyk, Markus A; Lam, Thomas B; Marconi, Lorenzo; Merseburger, Axel S; Staehler, Michael; Volpe, Alessandro; Powles, Thomas",European urology,287,1

In response to the harmful effects of tobacco smoking, the use of electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) has emerged and gained significant popularity over the past 15 years. E-cigarettes are promoted as safe alternatives for traditional tobacco smoking and are often suggested as a way to reduce or quit smoking. However, evidence suggests they are not harmless. DISCUSSION The rapid evolution of the e-cigarette market has outpaced the legislator's regulatory capacity, leading to mixed regulations. The increasing use of e-cigarettes in adolescents and young individuals is of concern. While the long-term direct cardiovascular effects of e-cigarettes remain largely unknown, the existing evidence suggests that the e-cigarette should not be regarded as a cardiovascular safe product. The contribution of e-cigarette use to reducing conventional cigarette use and smoking cessation is complex, and the impact of e-cigarette use on long-term cessation lacks sufficient evidence. CONCLUSION This position paper describes the evidence regarding the prevalence of e-cigarette smoking, uptake of e-cigarettes in the young, related legislations, cardiovascular effects of e-cigarettes and the impact of e-cigarettes on smoking cessation. Knowledge gaps in the field are also highlighted. The recommendations from the population science and public health section of the European Association of Preventive Cardiology are presented.","Kavousi, Maryam; Pisinger, Charlotta; Barthelemy, Jean-Claude; Smedt, Delphine De; Koskinas, Konstantinos; Marques-Vidal, Pedro; Panagiotakos, Demosthenes; Prescott, Eva Bossano; Tiberi, Monica; Vassiliou, Vassilios S; Løchen, Maja-Lisa",European journal of preventive cardiology,287,30

However, individuals who are exposed to environmental allergens are characterized by elevated values of FeNO. The aim of this study was to analyze the effects of subcutaneous immunotherapy (SCIT) on the dynamics of FeNO determined during consecutive pollination seasons. METHODS This study, performed between 2005 and 2008, included 41 patients with confirmed sensitivity to grass pollens and predominating symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis, randomly assigned to desensitization by preseasonal or maintenance SCIT. FeNO was measured prior to and during each pollen season (November-January and May-July, respectively). The results were conferred to data on grass pollination intensity in 2006-2008 (air concentration of grass pollen grains, seasonal number of days when air concentration of grass pollen reached at least 50 grains per 1 m(3)). RESULTS Median content of FeNO in exhaled air was significantly higher in 2007 compared to 2006 and 2008 pollen seasons. During 2007 and 2008 pollen seasons, significant increase in FeNO was observed compared to the respective preseasonal values. Median number of days with air concentration of grass pollen ≥ 50 grains per 1 m(3) of air during 4 weeks preceding seasonal FeNO measurement was significantly higher in 2007, corresponding to higher FeNO value recorded during this pollen season. However, no significant correlation was observed between seasonal number of days with ≥ 50 grass pollen grains per 1 m(3) of air and FeNO in exhaled air (r=0.09, p=0.362). CONCLUSIONS Most seasonal allergic rhinitis patients show physiological levels of FeNO prior to the pollen seasons and a marked increase in this parameter, probably proportional to pollination intensity, is observed within the seasons.

Despite growing concern about occupational burnout among CRAs in China, little is known about this topic. AIMS We evaluated the factors associated with occupational burnout among CRAs in China and assessed the extent and nature of this syndrome in order to develop effective countermeasures. METHODS In October 2020, we collected data from a convenience sample of 438 CRAs from 26 major cities across China using a custom-designed questionnaire. We evaluated their psychopathological status and degree of occupational burnout based on the Maslach Burnout Inventory. Factors associated with burnout were identified using the Wilcoxon rank test, Kruskal-Wallis test, Spearman's rank correlation and multivariable ordinal logistic regression. RESULTS Of the 438 CRAs analyzed, 82% showed signs of occupational burnout, with a large proportion experiencing moderate burnout (50%). Burnout in Chinese CRAs manifested as emotional exhaustion (77%), depersonalization (66%) and low sense of accomplishment (15%). The severity of burnout was significantly affected by mode of working (odds ratio [OR] 1.56, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.04-2.34), average number of working hours per week (OR 1.68, 95% CI 1.14-2.46), support provided by the hospital (OR 3.13, 95% CI 1.40-6.99) and likelihood of receiving a promotion (OR 4.05, 95% CI 1.34-12.22) (all P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS The incidence of occupational burnout among CRAs in China is high.

However, the findings of a recent meta-analysis suggest that the rate of surgical site infections (SSIs) is increased by using staples to close surgical wounds. Less clear is the effect of closure material on the incidence of non-infectious wound complications.The aim of this study was to compare sutures and staples in terms of: incidence of wound complications to determine the sample size for a definitive trial comparing wound closure methods. METHODS Eligible adult orthopaedic patients were randomized to have wounds closed with sutures or staples. Time for skin closure was recorded. Wounds were assessed for complications for six weeks. The incidence of complications was compared using Fisher's exact test. Time to close and pain with removal of closure material were compared using a Student's t-test. RESULTS The total number of patients reporting a wound complication was 59 of 148 patients completing six-week followup (41%), with no differennce between sutures and staples (RR = 0.77, CI = 0.52-1.14). The time to close wounds was shorter in the staple group (mean=4.8 min, CI = 2.6-7.1) than the suture group (mean=12 min, CI = 7.9-16). Patients in the staple group (mean=3.7, CI =2.8-4.6) reported more pain with removal than suture group (mean=2.5, CI =1.6-3.4). CONCLUSIONS This study suggests that 42% of patients report a wound complication with no difference between sutures and staples. It was demonstrated that suturing skin requires more time and staples are more painful to remove.

The secondary objective was to investigate the status of systemic inflammatory parameters, such as neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), lymphocyte-monocyte ratio (LMR), platelet-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), and platelet-monocyte ratio (PMR). MATERIALS AND METHODS The records of patients with primary TCBC who underwent transurethral resection were retrospectively evaluated. The relationship of DRR and systemic inflammatory parameters with clinicopathological findings, recurrence, and progression status was evaluated separately. RESULTS There was no significant difference in the DRR according to the clinicopathological findings, recurrence, and progression. Significant differences were found between the NLR and the patient groups for tumor diameter, tumor stage, tumor grade, and progression. In univariate analysis, the LMR was found to be associated with progression, and also the PLR and LMR were found to be associated with recurrence. Decrease in LMR and increase in LMR score demonstrated by multiple analysis was shown as independent predictors of progression and recurrence development. CONCLUSIONS This paper shows a positive correlation between poor prognosis in TCBC and the systemic inflammatory markers, namely NLR, LMR, PLR, and PMR, but not DRR.","Batur, Ali Furkan; Aydogan, Muhammed Furkan; Kilic, Ozcan; Korez, Muslu Kazım; Gul, Murat; Kaynar, Mehmet; Goktas, Serdar; Akand, Murat",International journal of clinical practice,287,1

Adhesions and recurrences are a common problem. A study was conducted to compare Chitosan coated polypropylene mesh and a polypropylene-polydioxanone composite with oxidized cellulose coating mesh (Proceed™) in repair of abdominal wall defect in a Rabbit hernia model. METHODS A randomized controlled experimental study was done on twelve New Zealand white rabbits. A ventral abdominal defect was created in each of the rabbits. The rabbits were divided into two groups. In one group the defect was repaired with Chitosan coated polypropylene mesh and Proceed mesh™ in the other. The rabbits were operated in two phases. They were followed up at four weeks and twelve weeks respectively after which the rabbits were sacrificed. They were evaluated by open exploration and histopathological examination. Their efficacy in reducing adhesion and ability of remodeling and tissue integration were studied. RESULTS There was no statistical significance in the area of adhesion, the force required to remove the adhesions, tissue integration and remodeling between Chitosan and Proceed™ group. Histological analysis revealed that the inflammatory response, fibrosis, material degradation and remodeling were similar in both the groups. There were no hernias, wound infection or dehiscence in any of the studied animals. CONCLUSION Chitosan coated polypropylene mesh was found to have similar efficacy to Proceed™ mesh. Chitosan coated polypropylene mesh, can act as an anti adhesive barrier when used in the repair of incisional hernias and abdominal wall defects.","Jayanth, S T; Pulimood, Anna; Abraham, Deepak; Rajaram, A; Paul, M J; Nair, Aravindan",Annals of medicine and surgery,287,27

However, whether the alteration of methylation status, a most commonly used marker for the alteration of gene expression in epidemiological investigation, of RUNX2 is associated with low-to-moderate fluoride exposure and BMD changes has not been reported. Our study aims to explore the role of RUNX2 promoter methylation in BMD changes induced by low-to-moderate fluoride exposure. A total of 1124 adults (413 men and 711 women) were recruited from Kaifeng City in 2017. We measured BMD using ultrasound bone densitometer. Concentrations of urinary fluoride (UF) were measured using ion-selective electrode, and the participants were grouped into control group (CG) and excessive fluoride group (EFG) according to the concentration of UF. We extracted DNA from fasting peripheral blood samples and then detected the promoter methylation levels of RUNX2 using quantitative methylation-specific PCR. Relationships between UF concentration, RUNX2 promoter methylation and BMD changes were analyzed using generalized linear model and logistic regression. Results showed in EFG (UF concentration > 1.6 mg/L), BMD was negatively correlated with UF concentration (β: -0.14; 95%CI: -0.26, -0.01) and RUNX2 promoter methylation (β: -0.13; 95%CI: -0.22, -0.03) in women. The methylation rate of RUNX2 promoter increased by 2.16% for each 1 mg/L increment in UF concentration of women in EFG (95%CI: 0.37, 3.96). No any significant associations between UF concentration, RUNX2 promoter methylation, and BMD were observed in the individuals in CG. Mediation analysis showed that RUNX2 promoter methylation mediated 18.2% (95% CI: 4.2%, 53.2%) of the association between UF concentration and BMD of women in EFG. In conclusion, excessive fluoride exposure (>1.6 mg/L) is associated with changes of BMD in women, and this association is mediated by RUNX2 promoter methylation.","Gao, Minghui; Sun, Long; Xu, Kaihong; Zhang, Luoming; Zhang, Yanli; He, Tongkun; Sun, Renjie; Huang, Hui; Zhu, Jingyuan; Zhang, Yawei; Zhou, Guoyu; Ba, Yue",Ecotoxicology and environmental safety,287,1

Its causative agent, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is an enveloped single stranded positive-sense ribonucleic acid virus that enters cells via the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 receptor or several other receptors. While COVID-19 primarily affects the respiratory system, other organs including the brain can be involved. In Western clinical studies, relatively mild neurological dysfunction such as anosmia and dysgeusia is frequent (~70-84%) while severe neurologic disorders such as stroke (~1-6%) and meningoencephalitis are less common. It is unclear how much SARS-CoV-2 infection contributes to the incidence of stroke given co-morbidities in the affected patient population. Rarely, clinically-defined cases of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, Guillain-Barré syndrome and acute necrotizing encephalopathy have been reported in COVID-19 patients. Common neuropathological findings in the 184 patients reviewed include microglial activation (42.9%) with microglial nodules in a subset (33.3%), lymphoid inflammation (37.5%), acute hypoxic-ischemic changes (29.9%), astrogliosis (27.7%), acute/subacute brain infarcts (21.2%), spontaneous hemorrhage (15.8%), and microthrombi (15.2%). In our institutional cases, we also note occasional anterior pituitary infarcts. COVID-19 coagulopathy, sepsis, and acute respiratory distress likely contribute to a number of these findings. When present, central nervous system lymphoid inflammation is often minimal to mild, is detected best by immunohistochemistry and, in one study, indistinguishable from control sepsis cases. Some cases evince microglial nodules or neuronophagy, strongly supporting viral meningoencephalitis, with a proclivity for involvement of the medulla oblongata. The virus is detectable by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, immunohistochemistry, or electron microscopy in human cerebrum, cerebellum, cranial nerves, olfactory bulb, as well as in the olfactory epithelium; neurons and endothelium can also be infected. Review of the extant cases has limitations including selection bias and limited clinical information in some cases.

However, an inappropriate dose of dexmedetomidine can cause prolonged sedation and cardiovascular complications. Thus, we evaluated the optimal dose (ED95) of dexmedetomidine for preventing EA with sevoflurane and remifentanil anesthesia after pediatric tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy. Methods: We enrolled American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) I and II children 3-7 years of age who underwent tonsillectomy with adenoidectomy. During induction, dexmedetomidine was infused for 10 min. Anesthesia was induced with sevoflurane and maintained with sevoflurane and remifentanil, resulting in a bispectral spectrum index (BIS) range from 40 to 60. Extubation time, surgical and anesthetic duration time, and duration time in the postanesthesia care unit (PACU) stay were recorded. EA [measured with Pediatric Anaesthesia Emergence Delirium (PAED) scores] and pain [measured with Face, Legs, Activity, Cry, Consolability (FLACC) scores] were assessed at extubation (E0), 15 min after extubation (E1), and 30 min after extubation (E2). If EA occurred, the next surgical procedure included increased dexmedetomidine by 0.1 μg/kg, and if not, the drug was reduced by 0.1 μg/kg. Results: The 50% effective dose (ED50) of dexmedetomidine for preventing EA after sevoflurane and remifentanil anesthesia for tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy was 0.13 μg/kg, and its 95% confidence interval is 0.09-0.19 μg/kg; ED95 was 0.30 μg/kg, and its 95% confidence interval is 0.21-1.00 μg/kg. Conclusion: Intravenous dexmedetomidine infusion at ED50 (0.13 μg/kg) or ED95 (0.30 μg/kg) during induction for 10 min can prevent half or almost all EA after sevoflurane and remifentanil anesthesia during pediatric tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy.","Zhang, Yan-Zhuo; Wang, Xue; Wu, Jia-Min; Song, Chun-Yu; Cui, Xiao-Guang",Frontiers in pharmacology,287,1

Contrary to the recent trend, increased caseloads of enucleation and stereotactic radiosurgery (p > 0.05), in comparison to fewer proton beam therapy (p < 0.05), were performed. In the 4-month period following lockdown, there was a surge in clinical activities with more advanced diseases (p < 0.05) presenting to the services. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to mount pressure and reveal its hidden impact on the eye cancer care, it is imperative for the Ocular Oncology Services to plan recovery strategies and innovative ways of working.","Wang, Haoyu; Elsheikh, Mohammed; Gilmour, Kenneth; Cohen, Victoria; Sagoo, Mandeep S; Damato, Bertil; Anguita, Rodrigo; Heimann, Heinrich; Hussain, Rumana; Cauchi, Paul; Chadha, Vikas; Connolly, Julie; Rundle, Paul; Salvi, Sachin M",British journal of cancer,287,17

Its tissue tropism and replication in different cell lines are not well understood. OBJECTIVE Compare the growth characteristics of cell lines infected by S-OIV, seasonal influenza A H1N1 (sH1N1) and avian influenza A H5N1 (H5N1) viruses and the effect of temperature on viral replication. STUDY DESIGN Cytopathic effect (CPE), antigen expression by immunofluorescence (IF) and viral load profile by quantitative RT-PCR in 17 cell lines infected by S-OIV, sH1N1 and H5N1 were examined. Comparison of their replication efficiency in chick embryo was performed. The effect of temperature on viral replication in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells was determined by TCID(50) at 33 degrees C, 37 degrees C and 39 degrees C for 5 consecutive days. RESULTS S-OIV replicated in cell lines derived from different tissues or organs and host species with comparable viral load to sH1N1. Among 13 human cell lines tested, Caco-2 has the highest viral load for S-OIV. S-OIV showed a low viral load with no CPE or antigen expression in pig kidney cell PK-15, H5N1 demonstrated the most diverse cell tropism by CPE and antigen expression, and the highest viral replication efficiency in both cell lines and allantoic fluid. All three viruses demonstrated best growth at 37 degrees C in MDCK cells. CONCLUSION Cell line growth characteristics of S-OIV, sH1N1 and H5N1 appear to correlate clinically and pathologically with involved anatomical sites and severity. Low replication of S-OIV in PK-15 suggests that this virus is more adapted to human than swine.","Li, I W S; Chan, K H; To, K W K; Wong, S S Y; Ho, P L; Lau, S K P; Woo, P C Y; Tsoi, H W; Chan, J F W; Cheng, V C C; Zheng, B J; Chen, H; Yuen, K Y",Journal of clinical virology : the official publication of the Pan American Society for Clinical Virology,287,26

The nasal allergen challenge (NAC) and allergen exposure chamber (AEC) are two translational models of AR that can be used to investigate the properties, safety, and efficacy of AIT. AREAS COVERED Peer-reviewed, human-centered articles utilizing AEC or NAC models to investigate AIT between 2010-2020 were curated from PubMed, EMBASE, and OVID Medline databases. AECs have been used to evaluate traditional subcutaneous and sublingual administrations of AIT, including cross-protective effects and different dosing regimens. More recently, the effectiveness of novel AIT formulations have been evaluated. NACs are another model used to study AIT, including using novel intralymphatic routes of administration. It is an especially powerful and versatile tool to determine if basic science and animal model findings are clinically translatable. EXPERT OPINION The AEC and NAC models both produce clinically-relevant and reproducible results. AECs are more effective for studying many participants but are limited because they require a specialized facility. As more AIT therapies and new formulations are developed over time, the versatility of the NAC will be especially useful.","Hossenbaccus, Lubnaa; Ellis, Anne K",Expert review of clinical immunology,287,25

MATERIALS AND METHODS Epidemiological, clinical features, laboratory findings and radiological characteristics of 1,563 hospitalised patients with COVID-19 in Ankara were collected, reviewed and analysed in this study. The risk factors associated with disease severity were investigated. RESULTS Non-severe (1,214; 77.7%) and severe cases (349; 22.3%) were enrolled in the study. Compared with the non-severe group, the severe group were significantly older and had more comorbidities (i.e. hypertension, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease and chronic kidney disease). Smoking was more common in the severe group. Severe patients had higher respiratory rates and higher incidences of cough and dyspnea compared to non-severe patients. Compared to the non-severe patients, the severe patients had increased C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin, neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and CRP/albumin ratio and decreased albumin. The occurrence rates of consolidation, subpleural sparing, crazy-paving pattern, cavity, halo sign, reversed halo sign, air bronchogram, pleural thickening, micronodule, subpleural curvilinear line, multilobar and bilateral involvement in the CT finding of the severe patients were significantly higher than those of the non-severe patients. CONCLUSIONS Many factors are related to the severity of COVID-19, which can help clinicians judge the severity of the patient and evaluate the prognosis. This cohort study revealed that male sex, age (≥55 years), patients with any comorbidities, especially those with cardiovascular disease, dyspnea, increased CRP, D-dimer and NLR, and decreased lymphocyte count and CT findings of consolidation and multilobar involvement were predictors of severe COVID-19.","Yılmaz Demirci, Nilgün; Uğraş Dikmen, Asiye; Taşçı, Cantürk; Doğan, Deniz; Arslan, Yakup; Öcal, Nesrin; Taşar, Mustafa; Bozlar, Uğur; Artuk, Cumhur; Yılmaz, Gülden; Karacaer, Zehra; Avcı, İsmail Yaşar; Tuncer Ertem, Günay; Erdinç, Fatma Şebnem; Kınıklı, Sami; Altun Demircan, Şerife; Ergün, Elif; Nercis Koşar, Pınar; Karakoç, Ayşe Esra; Gökçek, Atila; Aloğlu, Melike; Gülgösteren, Sevtap; Atikcan, Şükran; Akçay, Şule; Erol, Çiğdem; Hekimoğlu, Koray; Cerit, Mahi Nur; Erbaş, Gonca; Özger, Hasan Selçuk; Bozdayı, Gülendam; Şenol, Esin; Yurdakul, Ahmet Selim; Yılmaz, Aydın",International journal of clinical practice,287,1

Commercial smartphone applications (apps) that promote self-monitoring for weight loss are widely available. Evidence is lacking regarding what support is required to enhance user engagement with and effectiveness of those technologies. Pragmatically comparing these apps effectiveness, including rural men's desired forms of support when using them, can lead to greater weight loss intervention impact and reach. This study assessed the feasibility and acceptability of a mobile technology application applied differently across two groups for weight loss. METHODS In a two-armed, pragmatic pilot feasibility study, 80 overweight and obese men aged 40-69 were randomized using a 1:1 ratio to either an enhanced Mobile Technology Plus (MT+) intervention or a basic Mobile Technology (MT) intervention. The MT+ group had an enhanced smartphone app for self-monitoring (text messaging, discussion group, Wi-Fi scale) whereas the MT group received a basic app that allowed self-monitoring logging only. Assessments were collected at baseline, 3 and 6 months. App logs were analyzed to track engagement and adherence to self-monitoring. Acceptability was assessed via focus groups. Analysis included descriptive statistics and qualitative content analysis. RESULTS Of 80 men recruited, forty were allocated to each arm. All were included in the primary analysis. Recruitment ended after 10 months with a 97.5 and 92.5% (3 month, 6 month) retention rate. Over 90% of men reported via survey and focus groups that Lose-It app and smart scale (MT+) was an acceptable way to self-monitor weight, dietary intake and physical activity. Adherence to daily app self-monitoring of at least 800 dietary calories or more (reported respectively as MT+, MT) was positive with 73.4, 51.6% tracking at least 5 days a week. Adherence to tracking activity via recorded steps four or more days weekly was positive, 87.8, 64.6%. Men also adhered to self-weighing at least once weekly, 64, 46.3%. At 6 months, an observed mean weight loss was 7.03 kg (95% CI: 3.67, 10.39) for MT+ group and 4.14 kg (95% CI: 2.22, 6.06) for MT group, with 42.9 and 34.2% meeting ≥5% weight loss, respectively. No adverse events were reported. CONCLUSIONS This National Institutes of Health-funded pilot study using mobile technologies to support behavior change for weight loss was found to be feasible and acceptable among midlife and older rural men. The interventions demonstrated successful reductions in weight, noting differing adherence to lifestyle behaviors of eating, monitoring and activity between groups, with men in the MT+ having more favorable results. These findings will be used to inform the design of a larger scale, clinical trial.

It has been a provocative challenge for modern medicine to diagnose CVD in its crib, owing to its etiological factors being attributed to a large array of systemic diseases, as well as its non-binary hideous nature that gradually leads to functional disability. Novel echocardiography techniques have enabled the cardiac ultrasound to provide a comprehensive analysis of the heart in an objective, feasible, time- and cost-effective manner. Speckle tracking echocardiography, contrast echocardiography, and 3D echocardiography have shown the highest potential for widespread use. The uses of novel modalities have been elaborately demonstrated in this study as a proof of concept that echocardiography has a place in routine general practice with supportive evidence being as recent as its role in the concurrent COVID-19 pandemic. Despite such evidence, many uses remain off-label and unexploited in practice. Generalization of echocardiography at the point of care can become a much-needed turning point in the clinical approach to case management. To actualize such aspirations, we recommend further prospective and interventional studies to examine the effect of implementing advanced techniques at the point of care on the decision-making process and evaluate their effectiveness in prevention of cardiovascular morbidities and mortalities.","Iskander, John; Kelada, Peter; Rashad, Lara; Massoud, Doaa; Afdal, Peter; Abdelmassih, Antoine Fakhry",Current problems in cardiology,287,1

Here, the authors compared demographic variables, aneurysm-related variables, and comorbidities in patients who received microsurgical or endovascular treatment and those who were conservatively managed to determine which factors push the surgeon toward recommending treatment. METHODS A retrospective chart review was conducted of all patients diagnosed with an unruptured intracranial aneurysm at their institution between January 1, 2013, and January 1, 2016. These patients were dichotomized based on whether their aneurysm was treated. Demographic, geographic, socioeconomic, comorbidity, and aneurysm-related information was analyzed to assess which factors were associated with the decision to treat. RESULTS A total of 424 patients were identified, 163 who were treated surgically or endovascularly and 261 who were managed conservatively. In a multivariable model, an age < 65 years (OR 2.913, 95% CI 1.298-6.541, p = 0.010), a lower Charlson Comorbidity Index (OR 1.536, 95% CI 1.274-1.855, p < 0.001), a larger aneurysm size (OR 1.176, 95% CI 1.100-1.257, p < 0.001), multiple aneurysms (OR 2.093, 95% CI 1.121-3.907, p = 0.020), a white race (OR 2.288, 95% CI 1.245-4.204, p = 0.008), and living further from the medical center (OR 2.125, 95% CI 1.281-3.522, p = 0.003) were all associated with the decision to treat rather than observe. CONCLUSIONS Whereas several factors were expected to be considered in the decision to treat unruptured intracranial aneurysms, including age, Charlson Comorbidity Index, aneurysm size, and multiple aneurysms, other factors such as race and proximity to the medical center were unanticipated. Further studies are needed to identify such biases in patient treatment and improve treatment delineation based on patient-specific aneurysm rupture risk.","Guan, Jian; Karsy, Michael; Couldwell, William T; Schmidt, Richard H; Taussky, Philipp; MacDonald, Joel D; Park, Min S",Journal of neurosurgery,287,19

This cyclometallated Ir(III) complex in itself displays good, micromolar activity against the chloroquine-sensitive NF54 strain of Plasmodium falciparum. Live-cell confocal microscopy found negligible localisation of the fluorescent complex within the digestive vacuole of the parasite, eliminating the haem detoxification pathway as a potential mechanism of action. Similarly, no localisation of the complex within the parasitic nucleus was found, suggesting that this complex likely does not interfere with the DNA replication process. A substantial saturation of fluorescence from the complex was found near phospholipid structures such as the plasma and nuclear membranes but not in neutral lipid bodies. This indicates that an association with these membranes, or organelles such as the endoplasmic reticulum or branched mitochondrion, could be essential to the efficacies of these types of antimalarial compounds.","Melis, Diana R; Hsiao, Chiao-Yu; Combrinck, Jill M; Wiesner, Lubbe; Smith, Gregory Stuart",Chembiochem : a European journal of chemical biology,287,8

For the United States to achieve these benchmarks, public health responses must target high-risk populations, such as people who inject drugs (PWID), a group with high rates of HCV incidence and low rates of treatment uptake. Objective To evaluate potential improvements in the HCV care cascade among PWID, focusing on improved testing, treatment uptake, and access to harm reduction. Design, Setting, and Participants This decision analytic model used a differential equation-based dynamic transmission model based on data from New Hampshire, an illustrative state with a large number of PWID and limited HCV treatment infrastructure. Surveillance data through 2020 was used for model parameterization, and the final analysis was conducted in May 2021. Main Outcomes and Measures Model forecasts of chronic HCV cases and advanced-stage HCV outcomes from 2022 to 2045. Results A total of 6 scenarios were tested: (1) the base case, (2) improved harm reduction, (3) improved testing, (4) improved treatment, (5) improved testing and treatment, and (6) improved testing, treatment, and harm reduction. All scenarios with improved testing, treatment uptake, and/or access to harm reduction were associated with decreases in forecasted HCV prevalence and HCV-associated mortality compared with the base case. Improving harm reduction, testing, and treatment individually were forecast to reduce prevalence of HCV in 2045 from 69.7% in the base case to 62.8%, 45.7%, and 35.5%, respectively. Combining treatment and testing improvements was associated with a 2045 prevalence of 0.3%; adding harm reduction improvements was associated with further reductions in prevalence forecasts (to 0.2%), with fewer total treatments (10 960 vs 13 219 from 2022-2045). Conclusions and Relevance In this modeling study, no single intervention was projected to achieve World Health Organization HCV elimination targets. Scenarios with improvements in both testing and treatment were associated with a prevalence of less than 3% by 2030 and achieved elimination targets. Adding improvements in harm reduction was associated with faster reductions in prevalence and fewer treatments.","Blake, Andrew; Smith, James E",JAMA network open,287,19

SARS-CoV-2 uses the Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor as an entry route, associated with the transmembrane serine protease protein (TMPRSS2), which makes the testis and particularly spermatogenesis potentially vulnerable, since this tissue has high expression of ACE2. MATERIAL AND METHODS We performed a systematic literature review by electronic bibliographic databases in Pubmed, Scopus and ScienceDirect up to August 2020 about the effect of SARS-CoV-2 on male sexual function and its transmission, to assess possible repercussions on sex organs and the existence of a sexual transmission path. RESULTS Although SARS-CoV-2 presence has not been found in testicle samples, it has been demonstrated that it causes histological changes compatible with orchitis, and sex hormone disturbances. TMPRSS2 is up-regulated in prostate cancer where it supports tumor progression, thus these patients may have a higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. TMPRSS2 inhibitors may be useful for the treatment or prevention of COVID-19. No viral material has been found in blood or semen, however it has been proven to be present in stool and saliva. CONCLUSION The male reproductive system would be highly vulnerable and susceptible to infection by SARS-CoV-2 given the expression of the ACE2 receptor in somatic and germ cells. The seminal fluid would remain free of viral presence in patients with COVID-19. Regardless, non-genital sex could be an important source of viral transmission. In assisted reproduction techniques all necessary tests must be carried out to ensure the donor is free of the virus at the time of collection and handling of the seminal sample.","Rodriguez Bustos, Héctor; Bravo Maturana, Gonzalo; Cortés-Chau, Felipe; Defaur Torres, Joelle; Cortés-Pino, Felipe; Aguirre, Pablo; Arriaza Onel, Camilo","Archivio italiano di urologia, andrologia : organo ufficiale [di] Societa italiana di ecografia urologica e nefrologica",287,33

Recently, researchers have proposed various methods for feature extraction and classification based on MI signals. The decoding model based on deep neural networks (DNNs) has attracted significant attention in the field of MI signal processing. Due to the strict requirements for subjects and experimental environments, it is difficult to collect large-scale and high-quality electroencephalogram (EEG) data. However, the performance of a deep learning model depends directly on the size of the datasets. Therefore, the decoding of MI-EEG signals based on a DNN has proven highly challenging in practice. Based on this, we investigated the performance of different data augmentation (DA) methods for the classification of MI data using a DNN. First, we transformed the time series signals into spectrogram images using a short-time Fourier transform (STFT). Then, we evaluated and compared the performance of different DA methods for this spectrogram data. Next, we developed a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify the MI signals and compared the classification performance of after DA. The Fréchet inception distance (FID) was used to evaluate the quality of the generated data (GD) and the classification accuracy, and mean kappa values were used to explore the best CNN-DA method. In addition, analysis of variance (ANOVA) and paired t-tests were used to assess the significance of the results. The results showed that the deep convolutional generative adversarial network (DCGAN) provided better augmentation performance than traditional DA methods: geometric transformation (GT), autoencoder (AE), and variational autoencoder (VAE) (p < 0.01). Public datasets of the BCI competition IV (datasets 1 and 2b) were used to verify the classification performance. Improvements in the classification accuracies of 17% and 21% (p < 0.01) were observed after DA for the two datasets. In addition, the hybrid network CNN-DCGAN outperformed the other classification methods, with average kappa values of 0.564 and 0.677 for the two datasets.","Zhang, Kai; Xu, Guanghua; Han, Zezhen; Ma, Kaiquan; Zheng, Xiaowei; Chen, Longting; Duan, Nan; Zhang, Sicong",Sensors,287,26

METHODS Fifty-two patients (37 men and 15 women, ages 41-94 years) were treated (12/2011-12/2015) with EVT for anastomotic insufficiency secondary to esophagectomy or gastrectomy (n = 39), iatrogenic esophageal perforation (n = 9) and Boerhaave syndrome (n = 4). After diagnosis, polyurethane sponges were endoscopically positioned with a total of 390 interventions and continuous negative pressure of 125 mm of mercury (mmHg) was applied to the EVT-system. Sponges were changed endoscopically twice per week. Clinical and therapy-related data and mortality were analyzed. RESULTS After 1-25 changes of the sponge at intervals of 3-5 days with a mean of 6 sponge changes and a mean duration of therapy of 22 days, the defects were healed in 94.2 % of all patients without revision surgery. In three patients (6 %), EVT failed. Two of these patients died due to hemorrhage related to EVT. Four postinterventional strictures were observed during the follow-up of up to 4 years. CONCLUSION Esophageal wall defects of different etiology in the upper gastrointestinal tract can be treated successfully with EVT, considering that indication for EVT should be weighed carefully. EVT can be regarded as a novel life-saving therapeutic tool.","Laukoetter, Mike G; Mennigen, Rudolf; Neumann, Philipp A; Dhayat, Sameer; Horst, Gabriele; Palmes, Daniel; Senninger, Norbert; Vowinkel, Thorsten",Surgical endoscopy,287,13

Driven by legislative enactments to improve access to care, the PA has emerged as a ready and able medical professional to address workforce shortages. The aim of this study was to review the literature on patient satisfaction of PAs. OBJECTIVES The basis for this review was to clarify working definitions, synthesize the evidence, and establish conceptual boundaries around the topic of patient satisfaction with PAs. The intent was to identify gaps in the literature and offer suggested undertakings for more clarification on the subject. METHODS A scoping review was undertaken. Literature from 1968 to 2019 was searched and filtered for eligibility. Those that met criteria were categorized by date, method, geography, themes, and design. RESULTS In total, there were 987 papers or reports that were identified through bibliography database searching. Additional articles found through snowball methodology-reviewing references (n = 11). Only English language articles emerged for analysis. From this effort, 25 articles surfaced from the filtering process for final inclusion. Most (72%) of the articles came from the United States of America, three from the United Kingdom, and one each from Ireland, the Netherlands, and New Zealand. Most articles were descriptive in nature. Some variations in methods emerged. CONCLUSION PAs are operational in 15 nations; their acceptance appears successful and satisfaction with their care largely indistinguishable from physicians. Findings from this analysis highlight one theory that when patient's needs are met, satisfaction is high regardless of the medical provider. Areas for further research are identified.","Hooker, Roderick S; Moloney-Johns, Amanda J; McFarland, Mary M",Human resources for health,287,1

The outward-facing components of cellular membranes and lipid nanoparticles, the lipid headgroups, regulate membrane interactions with approaching substances, such as proteins, drugs, RNA, or viruses. Because lipid headgroup conformational ensembles have not been experimentally determined in physiologically relevant conditions, an essential question about their interactions with other biomolecules remains unanswered: Do headgroups exchange between a few rigid structures, or fluctuate freely across a practically continuous spectrum of conformations? Here, we combine solid-state NMR experiments and molecular dynamics simulations from the NMRlipids Project to resolve the conformational ensembles of headgroups of four key lipid types in various biologically relevant conditions. We find that lipid headgroups sample a wide range of overlapping conformations in both neutral and charged cellular membranes, and that differences in the headgroup chemistry manifest only in probability distributions of conformations. Furthermore, the analysis of 894 protein-bound lipid structures from the Protein Data Bank suggests that lipids can bind to proteins in a wide range of conformations, which are not limited by the headgroup chemistry. We propose that lipids can select a suitable headgroup conformation from the wide range available to them to fit the various binding sites in proteins. The proposed inverse conformational selection model will extend also to lipid binding to targets other than proteins, such as drugs, RNA, and viruses.","Bacle, Amélie; Buslaev, Pavel; Garcia-Fandino, Rebeca; Favela-Rosales, Fernando; Mendes Ferreira, Tiago; Fuchs, Patrick F J; Gushchin, Ivan; Javanainen, Matti; Kiirikki, Anne M; Madsen, Jesper J; Melcr, Josef; Milán Rodríguez, Paula; Miettinen, Markus S; Ollila, O H Samuli; Papadopoulos, Chris G; Peón, Antonio; Piggot, Thomas J; Piñeiro, Ángel; Virtanen, Salla I",Journal of the American Chemical Society,287,17

Guidelines recommend nasogastric tube (NGT) feeding if swallowing impairment persists for 7 days or longer and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement if dysphagia does not recover within 30 days, but, to our knowledge, a systematic prediction method does not exist. Objective To develop and validate a prognostic model predicting swallowing recovery and the need for enteral tube feeding. Design, Setting, and Participants We enrolled participants with consecutive admissions for acute ischemic stroke and initially severe dysphagia in a prospective single-center derivation (2011-2014) and a multicenter validation (July 2015-March 2018) cohort study in 5 tertiary stroke referral centers in Switzerland. Exposures Severely impaired oral intake at admission (Functional Oral Intake Scale score <5). Main Outcomes and Measures Recovery of oral intake (primary end point, Functional Oral Intake Scale ≥5) or return to prestroke diet (secondary end point) measured 7 (indication for NGT feeding) and 30 (indication for PEG feeding) days after stroke. Results In total, 279 participants (131 women [47.0%]; median age, 77 years [interquartile range, 67-84 years]) were enrolled (153 [54.8%] in the derivation study; 126 [45.2%] in the validation cohort). Overall, 64% (95% CI, 59-71) participants failed to recover functional oral intake within 7 days and 30% (95% CI, 24-37) within 30 days. Prolonged swallowing recovery was independently associated with poor outcomes after stroke. The final prognostic model, the Predictive Swallowing Score, included 5 variables: age, stroke severity on admission, lesion location, initial risk of aspiration, and initial impairment of oral intake. Predictive Swallowing Score prediction estimates ranged from 5% (score, 0) to 96% (score, 10) for a persistent impairment of oral intake on day 7 and from 2% to 62% on day 30. Model performance in the validation cohort showed a discrimination (C statistic) of 0.84 (95% CI, 0.76-0.91; P < .001) for predicting the recovery of oral intake on day 7 and 0.77 (95% CI, 0.67-0.87; P < .001) on day 30, and a discrimination for a return to prestroke diet of 0.94 (day 7; 95% CI, 0.87-1.00; P < .001) and 0.71 (day 30; 95% CI, 0.61-0.82; P < .001). Calibration plots showed high agreement between the predicted and observed outcomes. Conclusions and Relevance The Predictive Swallowing Score, available as a smartphone application, is an easily applied prognostic instrument that reliably predicts swallowing recovery. It will support decision making for NGT or PEG insertion after ischemic stroke and is a step toward personalized medicine.","Galovic, Marian; Stauber, Anne Julia; Leisi, Natascha; Krammer, Werner; Brugger, Florian; Vehoff, Jochen; Balcerak, Philipp; Müller, Anna; Müller, Marlise; Rosenfeld, Jochen; Polymeris, Alexandros; Thilemann, Sebastian; De Marchis, Gian Marco; Niemann, Thorsten; Leifke, Maren; Lyrer, Philippe; Saladin, Petra; Kahles, Timo; Nedeltchev, Krassen; Sarikaya, Hakan; Jung, Simon; Fischer, Urs; Manno, Concetta; Cereda, Carlo W; Sander, Josemir W; Tettenborn, Barbara; Weder, Bruno J; Stoeckli, Sandro J; Arnold, Marcel; Kägi, Georg",JAMA neurology,287,5

In particular, immunochemistry, specifically pertaining to antibodies, was extensively studied. These studies laid the foundations for employing antibodies in a variety of ways. Not surprisingly, antibodies have been used for applications ranging from biomedical research to disease diagnostics and therapeutics to evaluation of immune responses during natural infection and those elicited by vaccines. Despite recent advancements in cellular immunology and the excitement of T cell therapy, use of antibodies represents a large proportion of immunotherapeutic approaches as well as clinical interventions. Polyclonal antibodies in the form of plasma or sera continue to be used to treat a number of diseases, including autoimmune disorders, cancers, and infectious diseases. Historically, antisera to toxins have been the longest serving biotherapeutics. In addition, intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIg) have been extensively used to treat not only immunodeficiency conditions but also autoimmune disorders. Beyond the simplistic suppositions of their action, the IVIg have also unraveled the immune regulatory and homeostatic ramifications of their use. The advent of monoclonal antibodies (MAbs), on the other hand, has provided a clear pathway for their development as drug molecules. MAbs have found a clear place in the treatment of cancers and extending lives and have been used in a variety of other conditions. In this review, we capture the important developments in the therapeutic applications of antibodies to alleviate disease, with a focus on some of the recent developments.","Kumar, Deepak; Gauthami, Sulgey; Bayry, Jagadeesh; Kaveri, Srinivas V; Hegde, Nagendra R",Monoclonal antibodies in immunodiagnosis and immunotherapy,287,5

Two of the foremost bioactive factors, bone morphogenetic protein-2 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), are widely applied using a ceramic scaffold. The aim of this study was to determine the use of hydroxyapatite microcarrier (MC) for dual delivery of osteogenic and angiogenic factors to accelerate hard tissue regeneration during the regenerative process. METHODS Two MCs of different sizes were fabricated by emulsification of gelatin and alpha-tricalcium phosphate (α-TCP). The experimental group was divided based on the combination of MC size and growth factors. For investigating the in vitro properties, rat mesenchymal stem cells (rMSCs) were harvested from bone marrow of the femur and tibia. For in vivo experiments, MC with/without growth factors was applied into the standardized, 5-mm diameter defects, which were made bilaterally on the parietal bone of the rat. The animals were allowed to heal for 8 weeks, and samples were harvested and analyzed by micro-computed tomography and histology. RESULTS Improved proliferation of rat mesenchymal stem cells was observed with VEGF loaded MC. For osteogenic differentiation, dual growth factors delivered by MC showed higher osteogenic gene expression, alkaline phosphatse production and calcium deposition. The in vivo results revealed statistically significant increase in new bone formation when dual growth factors were delivered by MC. Dual growth factors administered on a calcium phosphate matrix showed significantly enhanced osteogenic potential. CONCLUSION We propose this system has potential clinical utility in providing solutions for craniofacial bone defects, with the added benefit of early availability.","Kim, Tae-Woo; Ahn, Woo-Beom; Kim, Joong-Min; Kim, Joong-Hyun; Kim, Tae-Hyun; Perez, Roman A; Jang, Hyon-Seok",Tissue engineering and regenerative medicine,287,1

A number of reviews have summarized the validity and reliability of well-being and mental health measures for children but there are fewer attempts to consider utility for routine use. METHOD This review considers four child self-report measures: the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), the Revised Child Anxiety and Depression Scale (RCADS), (Child) Outcomes Rating Scale (C/ORS) and Goals Based Outcomes (GBOs). It explores the strengths and limitations of each and considers how they can be used to support both clinical practice and service evaluation. RESULTS There is evidence for the clinical utility of RCADS, C/ORS and GBOs, although the utility of the SDQ as a feedback measure remains unclear. For service evaluation, the SDQ has the greatest evidence for norms making it useful for comparison and there is evidence that the RCADS may be the most sensitive to change of the measures reviewed; C/ORS has issues around ceiling effect, data error and data manipulation. More research is required around GBOs before their use for service evaluation can be determined. CONCLUSIONS In summary, these different measures may be viewed as complementary tools and determining the best way to make use of them severally and individually in clinical and community settings is a current focus for child mental health practitioners.","Wolpert, Miranda; Cheng, Helen; Deighton, Jessica",Child and adolescent mental health,287,12

Case report.,14.961463,9.55678,2010,"While bone has a remarkable capacity for regeneration, serious bone trauma often results in damage that does not properly heal. In fact, one tenth of all limb bone fractures fail to heal completely due to the extent of the trauma, disease, or age of the patient. Our ability to improve bone regenerative strategies is critically dependent on the ability to mimic serious bone trauma in test animals, but the generation and stabilization of large bone lesions is technically challenging. In most cases, serious long bone trauma is mimicked experimentally by establishing a defect that will not naturally heal. This is achieved by complete removal of a bone segment that is larger than 1.5 times the diameter of the bone cross-section. The bone is then stabilized with a metal implant to maintain proper orientation of the fracture edges and allow for mobility. Due to their small size and the fragility of their long bones, establishment of such lesions in mice are beyond the capabilities of most research groups. As such, long bone defect models are confined to rats and larger animals. Nevertheless, mice afford significant research advantages in that they can be genetically modified and bred as immune-compromised strains that do not reject human cells and tissue. Herein, we demonstrate a technique that facilitates the generation of a segmental defect in mouse femora using standard laboratory and veterinary equipment. With practice, fabrication of the fixation device and surgical implantation is feasible for the majority of trained veterinarians and animal research personnel. Using example data, we also provide methodologies for the quantitative analysis of bone healing for the model.","Clough, Bret H; McCarley, Matthew R; Gregory, Carl A",Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,287,1

This review outlines the current evidence of the epidemiology of infection in children, the clinical manifestations of disease, the role of children in transmission of the virus and the recently described hyperinflammatory syndrome observed later during the first phase of the pandemic. RECENT FINDINGS International seroprevalence studies have found younger children to have lower prevalence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, indicating they have not been infected as much as adults. This may be due to shielding by school closures, or by a reduced susceptibility to infection, as indicated by a significantly lower attack rate in children than adults in household contact tracing studies. The most well recognized symptoms in adults of cough, fever, anosmia and ageusia are less frequent in children, who may often present with mild and nonspecific symptoms, or with gastrointestinal symptoms alone. Risk factors for severe disease in children include chronic lung, cardiac or neurological disease, and malignancy. However, the absolute risk still appears very low for these cohorts. A new hyperinflammatory syndrome has emerged with an apparent immune cause. SUMMARY Important questions remain unanswered regarding why children have mild disease compared with adults; how children of different ages contribute to asymptomatic community transmission of the virus; and the pathophysiology of and most appropriate investigation and treatment strategies for the novel hyperinflammatory syndrome.","Munro, Alasdair P S; Faust, Saul N",Current opinion in infectious diseases,287,1

Apical pressure was correlated with the extent of dye clearance from the end of a needle tip in a plastic root canal model with similar dimensions. METHODS The mesiobuccal canal of a mandibular molar was instrumented to #35/06 and placed into a chamber coupled to a pressure transducer. Irrigation was performed using a digital peristaltic pump using flow rates from 1-15 mL/min with irrigation needles of different sizes and designs. A plastic root canal model instrumented to the same size filled with dye was used to measure the extent of dye clearance beyond the needle tip using the same irrigation conditions. RESULTS Positive-pressure irrigation revealed a flow rate-dependent increase in apical pressure (P < .05). The apical pressure at high irrigation flow rates was several times higher than at low flow rates. Needle designs with safety features yielded statistically significant lower apical pressures than needles without safety features (P < .05). There was no further increase in dye clearance from the end of the needle tip in a plastic root canal model at flow rates higher than 4 mL/min. CONCLUSIONS If apical clearance of dye beyond the needle tip is a measure of irrigation effectiveness, then maximum effectiveness with safe apical pressures can be gained at specific flow rates using specific needle tip designs. The use of an irrigation flow rate of 4 mL/min was able to achieve maximum effectiveness in this study.","Park, Ellen; Shen, Ya; Khakpour, Mehrzad; Haapasalo, Markus",Journal of endodontics,287,5

Of these patients, 452 were matched 1:1 on age, sex, year of surgery, and type of surgery to patients with noncardiac surgery who were not diagnosed with AF within 30 days following the surgery (no AF). The last date of follow-up was December 31, 2018. Exposures Postoperative AF vs no AF after noncardiac surgery. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcome was ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA). Secondary outcomes included subsequent documented AF, all-cause mortality, and cardiovascular mortality. Results The median age of the 452 matched patients was 75 years (IQR, 67-82 years) and 51.8% of patients were men. Patients with postoperative AF had significantly higher CHA2DS2-VASc scores than those in the no AF group (median, 4 [IQR, 2-5] vs 3 [IQR, 2-5]; P < .001).

This study explored the support medical and nonmedical operating room staff received after being involved in a surgical patient safety incident(s) in 5 UK teaching hospitals. METHODS An invitation letter and information sheet were e-mailed to all medical and nonmedical operating room staff (N = 927) across the 5 sites. Semistructured interviews were arranged with a range of different healthcare professionals working in operating rooms across a wide variety of surgical specialities. Interviews were audio recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analyzed using an inductive thematic approach. RESULTS We conducted 45 interviews with medical and nonmedical operating room staff, who emphasized the importance of receiving personalized support soon after the incident. Operating room staff described how the first ""go to"" people were their peers and reported feeling comforted when their peers empathized with their own experience(s). Other participants found it very difficult to seek support, perceiving it as a sign of weakness. Although family members played an important role in supporting second victims, some participants felt unable to discuss the incident with them, fearing that they might not understand. CONCLUSIONS There should be clear support structures in place for operating room staff who have been involved in surgical incidents. Health organizations need to offer timely support to frontline staff after these incidents. Senior clinicians should be proactive in offering support to junior colleagues and empathize with their own experiences, thus shifting the competitive culture to one of openness and support.","Serou, Naresh; Husband, Andy K; Forrest, Simon P; Slight, Robert D; Slight, Sarah P",Journal of patient safety,287,31

METHODS We conducted a prospective cohort study of nulliparous women with singleton gestations, recruited between 110 and 136 weeks gestation. Data on the following were collected: maternal age; ethnicity; chronic diseases; use of fertility treatment; body mass index; mean arterial blood pressure (MAP); serum levels of pregnancy-associated plasma protein A (PAPP-A), placental growth factor (PlGF), soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 (sFlt-1), alpha fetoprotein (AFP), free beta human chorionic gonadotropin (ß-hCG); and mean uterine artery pulsatility index (UtA-PI). We constructed a proportional hazard model for the prediction of preterm preeclampsia selected based on the Akaike information criterion. A receiver operating characteristic curve was created with the predicted risk from the final model. Our primary outcome was preterm preeclampsia and our secondary outcome was a composite of preeclampsia, small for gestational age, intrauterine death, and preterm birth. RESULTS Among 4659 nulliparous women with singleton gestations, our final model included 4 variables: MAP MoM, log10PlGF MoM, log10AFP MoM and log10UtA-PI MoM. We obtained an area under the curve of 0.84 (95% CI 0.75-0.93) with a detection rate of preterm preeclampsia of 55% (95% CI 37%-73%) and a false-positive rate of 10%. Using a risk cut-off with a false-positive rate of 10%, the positive predictive value for our composite outcome was 33% (95% CI 29%-37%). CONCLUSIONS The combination of MAP, maternal serum PlGF and AFP, and UtA-PI are useful to identify nulliparous women at high risk of preterm preeclampsia but also at high risk of other great obstetrical syndromes.","Boutin, Amélie; Gasse, Cédric; Guerby, Paul; Giguère, Yves; Tétu, Amélie; Bujold, Emmanuel",Journal of obstetrics and gynaecology Canada : JOGC = Journal d'obstetrique et gynecologie du Canada : JOGC,287,19

As sports at all levels resume, sports medicine physicians may be interested in how telehealth can be used for concussion care. Questions/Purpose: We sought to assess how telehealth has been used in the baseline testing, diagnosis, and/or management of concussion. Secondarily, we sought to assess the strengths and weaknesses of telehealth for concussion care and identify aspects of concussion care for which telehealth has not yet been studied. Methods: A systematic review was performed in September 2020 of PubMed and Embase using the following terms: concuss*, ""mild traumatic brain,"" ""head injur*,"" telehealth, telemedicine, telecare, ""mobile health,"" m-health, virtual. Studies included were original research articles investigating the use of telehealth in the care of concussion (including baseline testing, diagnosis, and management), published in English, and had full text available. Results: A total of 356 articles were screened, of which 5 were determined to meet inclusion criteria. These articles described the use of telehealth for managing concussion in military and rural settings. No articles involved the use of telehealth for baseline concussion testing of athletes or for sideline evaluation. Conclusion: Despite the limited original research on the use of telehealth for concussion care, the articles identified provide a foundation for exploring the potential value of telehealth in the office practice and sports team setting. Telehealth may expand the ability of a sports medicine physician to provide timely and effective concussion care to athletes during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond.

Despite the fact that DT is frequently used as an LVAD indication across other major European countries and the United States, with consistent improvements in quality-of-life and longevity, National Health Service (NHS) England does not currently fund DT, mainly due to concerns over cost-effectiveness. On the basis of the recently published ENDURANCE Supplemental Trial studying DT patients, we assessed for the first time the cost-effectiveness of DT LVADs compared with medical management (MM) in the NHS England. METHODS AND RESULTS We developed a Markov multiple-state economic model using NHS cost data. LVAD survival and adverse event rates were derived from the ENDURANCE Supplemental Trial. MM survival was based on Seattle Heart Failure Model estimates in the absence of contemporary clinical trials for this population. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated over a lifetime horizon. A discount rate of 3.5% per year was applied to costs and benefits. Deterministic ICER was £46 207 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY). Costs and utilities were £204 022 and 3.27 QALYs for the LVAD arm vs. £77 790 and 0.54 QALYs for the MM arm. Sensitivity analyses confirmed robustness of the primary analysis. CONCLUSIONS The implantation of the HeartWare™ HVAD™ System in patients ineligible for cardiac transplantation as DT is a cost-effective therapy in the NHS England healthcare system under the end-of-life willingness-to-pay threshold of £50 000/QALY, which applies for VAD patients.","Schueler, Stephan; Silvestry, Scott C; Cotts, William G; Slaughter, Mark S; Levy, Wayne C; Cheng, Richard K; Beckman, Jennifer A; Villinger, Jonas; Ismyrloglou, Eleni; Tsintzos, Stelios I; Mahr, Claudius",ESC heart failure,287,7

However, the contents of MSC-EVs would change as their parent MSCs change, hence the therapeutic efficacy of MSC-derived EVs (MSC-EVs) would largely depend on donors, tissue sources and culture conditions of MSCs. To overcome limitations of tissue-derived MSCs, we previously used MSCs derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iMSCs) to produce EVs and demonstrated their therapeutic potential in a mouse model of secondary Sjo¨gren's Syndrome. Here, we further found that EVs from early-passage iMSCs had better immunomodulatory potency than EVs from late-passage iMSCs in TLR4-stimulated splenocytes and in a mouse model of primary Sjögren's syndrome. Comparative molecular profiling using proteomics and microRNA sequencing revealed distinctive molecular profiles of iMSC-EVs with or without immunomodulation capacity. Amongst them, manipulation of TGF-β1, miR-21 and miR-125b levels in iMSC-EVs significantly affected their immunosuppressive effects. These findings would help improve our understanding of the molecular mechanism underlying iMSC-EV-mediated immunomodulation and further provide strategies to improve regulatory function of EVs for the treatment of immune-mediated diseases.","Kim, Hyemee; Zhao, Qingguo; Barreda, Heather; Kaur, Gagandeep; Hai, Bo; Choi, Jong Min; Jung, Sung Youn; Liu, Fei; Lee, Ryang Hwa",Aging and disease,287,11

We, therefore, aim to describe our experience with the use of early proning in awake, non-intubated patients with confirmed COVID-19. In our retrospective observational study, 23 patients with confirmed positive PCR test results for Severe Acute respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) and hypoxemia that required oxygen therapy with or without non-invasive ventilation were treated with PP. Patients were classified into mild, moderate and severe COVID-19 disease. There were no targeted number of hours for proning per day and patients were kept in prone position according to their tolerance. The primary outcome measure was the avoidance of intubation and secondary outcomes were in-hospital mortality, length of hospital stays and complications related to PP. The mean (standard deviation) age of our cohort was 54.5 (11.7) years, and the majority were males (21/23, 91.3%). Sixty-one per cent (14/23) of the patients were suffering from severe disease and 82.6% (19/23) had bilateral lung involvement with interstitial infiltrates. Majority of the patients were prone positioned for a median of 6 days (IQR 4 - 8). Only one patient required transfer to ICU for mechanical ventilation and subsequently died due to severe ARDS. All 22 patients showed progressive improvement in oxygen requirement and PF ratio, mostly after 3-5 days of proning. The mean length of hospital stay was 12 days. All patients, except one, were discharged in stable conditions, on room air or on a minimal oxygen requirement of 1-2 liters. No major complication of PP was recorded. Awake prone positioning is a valuable and safe therapeutic adjunct that can be applied in patients with moderate-to-severe COVID-19. It can also be included in the home-based management protocols of COVID-19 to improve patient outcomes and mitigate the burden on health care facilities.","Khanum, Iffat; Samar, Fatima; Fatimah, Yousuf; Safia, Awan; Adil, Aziz; Kiren, Habib; Nasir, Nosheen; Nosheen, Nasir; Faisal, Mahmood; Bushar, Jamil",Monaldi archives for chest disease = Archivio Monaldi per le malattie del torace,287,5

Here, we test the participation of KCa-channels in human heart explant-derived cell (EDC) physiology and therapeutic potential. TRAM34-sensitive KCa3.1-channels, encoded by the KCNN4 gene, are exclusively expressed in therapeutically bioactive EDC subfractions and maintain a strongly polarized resting potential; whereas therapeutically inert EDCs lack KCa3.1 channels and exhibit depolarized resting potentials. Somatic gene transfer of KCNN4 results in membrane hyperpolarization and increases intracellular [Ca2+], which boosts cell-proliferation and the production of pro-healing cytokines/nanoparticles. Intramyocardial injection of EDCs after KCNN4-gene overexpression markedly increases the salutary effects of EDCs on cardiac function, viable myocardium and peri-infarct neovascularization in a well-established murine model of ischemic cardiomyopathy. Thus, electrophysiological engineering provides a potentially valuable strategy to improve the therapeutic value of progenitor cells for cardioprotection and possibly other indications.","Vigneault, Patrick; Parent, Sandrine; Kanda, Pushpinder; Michie, Connor; Davis, Darryl R; Nattel, Stanley",Nature communications,287,26

Using a zein suspension prepared by the antisolvent precipitation method, the impact of varying the voltage during dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) treatment on the physicochemical and conformational properties of zein in water was investigated. Analysis of the particle size, specific surface area, and free sulfhydryl content indicated that the protein solubility was maximized by treatment at 70 V for 70 s. DBD treatment destroyed covalent bonds and introduced some hydrophilic groups onto the zein surface, thus enhancing the contact area with water molecules and leading to a more uniform dispersion. A decrease in the hydrodynamic radius of zein micelles indicated that intermolecular interactions were disrupted, thus improving dispersion stability. A more hydrophilic microenvironment was formed owing to the reduction in hydrophobic interactions. Additionally, evaluation of the secondary structure demonstrated that DBD treatment broke hydrogen bonds, resulting in a loose conformation with more exposed sites of action for water. These results are expected to facilitate the development of technologies for improving utilization of zein. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: Strong hydrophobicity limits the application of zein in the food industry. The study indicated that DBD treatment could promote loose structure, and improve dispersion stability and hydrophilicity of zein suspension prepared by antisolvent precipitation method. This work revealed the potential of cold plasma treatment for modifying zein and other insoluble proteins, which would expand their scope of application.","Li, Nan; Yu, Jiao-Jiao; Jin, Nan; Chen, Yue; Li, Shu-Hong; Chen, Ye",Journal of food science,287,12

Due to the systemic nature of the disease, patients with CLI are inherently medically complex and often present with multiple comorbidities. Successful care for these patients depends on community screening, early referral, accurate diagnosis, risk stratification, risk factor modification, invasive and non-invasive treatment strategies, and appropriate surveillance. Patients with CLI are often treated by multiple subspecialists-often lacking a unified team which could lead to inefficiencies and redundancy. Establishing an effective critical limb ischemia program relies on the joint efforts of multiple physician specialists, nurses, technicians, wound care specialists, researchers, and administrators who together form an integrated network that is easily accessible to the patient. This article will focus on the various modalities needed to build an advanced critical limb ischemia program, while addressing the challenges facing the medical community in caring for this population.","Galmer, Andrew M; Selim, Samy M; Giri, Jay; Lau, Joe F; Weinberg, Mitchell D",Current treatment options in cardiovascular medicine,287,1

The present study examined change in loneliness in response to the social restriction measures taken to control the coronavirus spread. A nationwide sample of American adults (N = 1,545; 45% women; ages 18 to 98, M = 53.68, SD = 15.63) was assessed on three occasions: in late January/early February 2020 (before the outbreak), in late March (during the President's initial ""15 Days to Slow the Spread"" campaign), and in late April (during the ""stay-at-home"" policies of most states). Contrary to expectations, there were no significant mean-level changes in loneliness across the three assessments (d = .04, p > .05). In fact, respondents perceived increased support from others over the follow-up period (d = .19, p < .01). Older adults reported less loneliness overall compared to younger age groups but had an increase in loneliness during the acute phase of the outbreak (d = .14, p < .05). Their loneliness, however, leveled off after the issuance of stay-at-home orders. Individuals living alone and those with at least one chronic condition reported feeling lonelier at baseline but did not increase in loneliness during the implementation of social distancing measures. Despite some detrimental impact on vulnerable individuals, in the present sample, there was no large increase in loneliness but remarkable resilience in response to COVID-19.

Heterozygous SCD (SC) patients had increased splenic volumes, but diminished FSV, homozygous SCD (SS) patients were asplenic. Splenectomized and SS patients had a strongly reduced phagocytic and immunological function. SC patients had reduced anti-polysaccharide responses without an increase in PIT. FSV correlated significantly with phagocytic and immunological function. HJB were indicative of splenic dysfunction, HJB absence was not indicative of normal functioning splenic tissue.

METHODS Using data (n = 495; mean age 62.9 years (SD 18.6), 50.5% female) from a prospective cohort study of patients discharged from medical wards at two university hospitals, the prognostic ability of EQ-5D-3L was examined using C-statistic, Integrated Discrimination Improvement (IDI) Index, and Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC). The associations between EQ-5D-3L dimensions, total sum, index and VAS scores at the time of discharge and 30-day post-discharge ED visits, readmission, and readmission/death were examined using multivariate logistic regression. RESULTS At the time of discharge, 58.6% of participants reported problems in mobility, 28.3% in self-care, 62.1% in usual activities, 62.7% in pain/discomfort, and 42.4% in anxiety/depression. Mean (SD) total sum score was 7.9 (2.0), index score was 0.69 (0.21), and VAS score was 63.7 (18.4). In adjusted analyses, mobility, self-care, usual activities, and the total sum score were significantly associated with 30-day readmission and readmission/death. Differences in C-statistic for LACE readmission prediction models with and without EQ-5D-3L were small. AIC analysis suggests that readmission prediction models containing EQ-5D-3L dimensions or scores were more often preferred to those with the LACE index only. IDI analysis indicates that the discrimination slope of readmission prediction models is significantly improved with the addition of mobility, self-care, or the total sum score of the EQ-5D-3L. CONCLUSION The EQ-5D-3L, especially the mobility and self-care dimensions as well as the total sum score, improves 30-day readmission prediction of the LACE index and is associated with 30-day readmissions or readmissions/death.","Al Sayah, Fatima; McAlister, Finlay A; Ohinmaa, Arto; Majumdar, Sumit R; Johnson, Jeffrey A","Quality of life research : an international journal of quality of life aspects of treatment, care and rehabilitation",287,31

Female physicians, now accounting for a larger share of the workforce, are thought to experience higher levels of BO in some situations compared with their male counterparts. The current review aimed to systematically examine extant literature on physician BO as it relates especially to the female physician. METHODS Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guided search of 4 databases yielding empirical studies with relevant findings regarding female physician BO, published during the time period 2010-2019. RESULTS A total of 43 studies were included in the current review. Both male and female doctors have higher percentages of burned out doctors, with a third or more of each group indicating BO in each of the studies examined. These higher levels of BO remained regardless of where physicians worked, their clinical specialty, workloads, or age. However, the review supports the notion that for women doctors, there is generally a higher likelihood of experiencing BO compared with male doctors, particular with respect to the emotional exhaustion dimension of BO. CONCLUSIONS BO is important for both female and male physicians; although women doctors may experience it to a greater degree. Women doctors will benefit from talent management approaches by health care organizations that recognize their greater tendency to BO compared with men. These approaches should be aimed at ameliorating the factors that give rise to feelings of emotional exhaustion in particular. Additional research is needed to better understand the full extent to which physician gender plays a role in BO.","Hoff, Timothy; Lee, Do R",Medical care,287,9

In each dog, the extent of pericardectomy and any complications were evaluated. RESULTS Technical difficulties with tube placement occurred in 4 dogs, but alternating OLV was achieved in all dogs and SPP completed successfully. Median surgical time was 87.5 minutes (range, 80-105 minutes). At necropsy, 0.5-2 cm of pericardial tissue remained ventral to the intact phrenic nerve in 6 dogs; in 1 dog, the phrenic nerve was transected on the left side only. CONCLUSIONS Thoracoscopic subphrenic pericardectomy is a technically feasible procedure in healthy dogs. Double-lumen endobronchial intubation allowed alternating OLV without intraoperative bronchoscopically guided tube manipulation in all but 1 dog. CLINICAL RELEVANCE Thoracoscopic subphrenic pericardectomy could potentially be used for management of conditions where relief of pericardial constriction or access to intrapericardial structures is desired.","Mayhew, Kelli N; Mayhew, Philipp D; Sorrell-Raschi, Laurie; Brown, Dorothy Cimino",Veterinary surgery : VS,287,17

By means of mucociliary clearance, those epithelia provide a first line of defense against inhaled particles and pathogens. Mucociliary clearance relies on the correct composition of cell types, that is, the proper balance of ciliated and secretory cells. A failure to generate and to maintain correct cell type composition and function results in impaired clearance and high risk to infections, such as in congenital diseases (e.g., ciliopathies) as well as in acquired diseases, including asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). While it remains incompletely resolved how precisely cell types are specified and maintained in development and disease, many studies have revealed important mechanisms regarding the signaling control in mucociliary cell types in various species. Those studies not only provided insights into the signaling contribution to organ development and regeneration but also highlighted the remarkable plasticity of cell identity encountered in mucociliary maintenance, including frequent trans-differentiation events during homeostasis and specifically in disease. This review will summarize major findings and provide perspectives regarding the future of mucociliary research and the treatment of chronic airway diseases associated with tissue remodeling.","Walentek, Peter","Cells, tissues, organs",287,12

Meth could affect the retina and optic nerve by inducing the release of vasoconstrictive agents such as endothelin 1 and induction of severe oxidative stress with accumulation of reactive oxygen species. AIM To evaluate the effects of chronic Meth abuse on the retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL), ganglion cell layer (GCL) and the Bruch's membrane opening minimum rim width (MRW). METHOD In this case-control study, we recruited 55 Meth abusers and 49 healthy individuals with mean age of 44.63 ± 0.97 and 43.08 ± 0.91 years, respectively. RNFL thickness, GCL thickness and MRW were evaluated using optical coherence tomography. RESULTS We found statistically significant decrease in RNFL, MRW thickness in Meth abusers (P: 0.002 and P: 0.006, respectively). We did not detect statistically significant difference regarding GCL thickness between the groups (P = 0.320). Our results showed a weak but statistically significant correlation of Meth dose increment and decrement of RNFL thickness ((P: 0.005, r = -0.193) and MRW (P: 0.013, r = -0.174). We found no correlation between duration of Meth consumption with RNFL and MRW thickness (P: 0.205, r= -0.124; P: 0.771, r= -0.029, respectively). CONCLUSION We found a statistically significant adverse association in meth abusers with RNFL thickness and MRW. These two parameters were also statistically associated with the meth dose as measured by daily dose of Meth. Although we found a decrease in the GCL thickness, it did not reach statistical significance.","Talebnejad, Mohammadreza; Khazaei, Peyman; Jahanbani-Ardakani, Hamidreza; Moghimi-Sarani, Ebrahim; Khalili, Zahra Mohammadreza",Neurotoxicology,287,1

In this study, human milk oligosaccharide (HMO) 2'-fucosyllactose (α-L-Fuc-(1,2)-D-Galβ-1,4-Glu, 2'FL) and its isomer 3'-fucosyllactose (α-L-Fuc-(1,3)-D-Galβ-1,4-Glu, 3'FL) with potential prebiotic effect were synthesized efficiently by a novel recombinant α-L-fucosidase. An α-L-fucosidase gene (PbFuc) from Pedobacter sp. CAU209 was successfully cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli (E. coli). The deduced amino acid sequence shared the highest identity of 36.8% with the amino sequences of other reported α-L-fucosidases. The purified α-L-fucosidase (PbFuc) had a molecular mass of 50 kDa. The enzyme exhibited specific activity (26.3 U/mg) towards 4-nitrophenyl-α-L-fucopyranoside (pNP-FUC), 3'FL (8.9 U/mg), and 2'FL (3.4 U/mg). It showed the highest activity at pH 5.0 and 35 °C, respectively. PbFuc catalyzed the synthesis of 3'FL and 2'FL through a transglycosylation reaction using pNP-FUC as donor and lactose as acceptor, and total conversion ratio was up to 85% at the optimized reaction conditions. The synthesized mixture of 2'FL and 3'FL promoted the growth of Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus NRRL B-548, L. casei subsp. casei NRRL B-1922, L. casei subsp. casei AS 1.2435, and Bifidobacterium longum NRRL B-41409. However, the growths of E. coli ATCC 11775, S. enterica AS 1.1552, L. monocytogenes CICC 21635, and S. aureus AS 1.1861 were not stimulated by the mixture of 2'FL and 3'FL. Overall, our findings suggest that PbFuc possesses a great potential for the specific synthesis of fucosylated compounds.Key Points• A novel α-L-fucosidase (PbFuc) from Pedobacter sp. was cloned and expressed.• PbFuc showed the highest hydrolysis activity at pH 5.0 and 35 °C, respectively.• It was used for synthesis of 3'-fucosyllactose (3'FL) and 2'-fucosyllactose (2'FL).• The mixture of 3'FL and 2'FL promoted the growth of some Lactobacillus sp. and Bifidobacteria sp.","Shi, Ran; Ma, Junwen; Yan, Qiaojuan; Yang, Shaoqing; Fan, Zhihong; Jiang, Zhengqiang",Applied microbiology and biotechnology,287,1

We aim to assess the effect of gender on the time to achieve complete remission of intestinal metaplasia (CRIM) among patients with BE, who underwent RFA. METHODS This was a retrospective, observational study using a large RFA database in a tertiary referral center. The primary outcome was time to CRIM compared between males and females. Covariates included age, race, smoking history, use of endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR), histology before RFA, and the number of RFA sessions. Time to CRIM (in months) was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared using the log-rank test. Multivariable Cox-proportional hazard models were used to assess for any association between time to CRIM and gender. RESULTS Two hundred and fifty-seven patients, 11% (n=23) female, underwent RFA for BE between May 2005 and June 2012. Males and females were similar in mean age, race, smoking history, median BE length, history of EMR, and baseline histology. Median time to CRIM for females was longer than males (24 months (95% confidence interval (CI): 10.3-60.2) vs. 11.7 months (95% CI: 10-15), P=0.03). Using Cox-regression analysis, controlling for age, use of EMR, BE segment length, and the number of RFA sessions, female gender was associated with a 55% decrease in the rate of CRIM compared with that in males (hazard ratio=0.45 (95% CI: 0.25-0.82), P=0.009). CONCLUSIONS Females take longer time to achieve CRIM when treated with RFA when compared with males of similar age and BE length.","Qumseya, Bashar; David, Waseem; McCrum, Marta; Dong, Yan; Raimondo, Massimo; Woodward, Timothy A; Wallace, Michael B; Wolfsen, Herbert C",The American journal of gastroenterology,287,1

METHODS A single-institution retrospective review was performed of 792 patients undergoing RALP. Preoperative patient variables, tumor characteristics, and perioperative variables were collected and analyzed. The first 150 patients were excluded from analysis to account for the learning curve of robotic surgery. Univariate and multivariate linear regression models were used to assess factors affecting operative time (ORT). RESULTS A total of 257 and 385 patients underwent RALP utilizing the VTS and conventional insufflation, respectively. There were no significant differences in American Society of Anesthesiologist score, body mass index (BMI), prostate volume, final Gleason score, estimated blood loss, and complications between the cohorts. The only difference noted was a significantly shorter mean ORT in the VTS cohort (149.5 vs. 170.1 min, p < 0.0001). In light of this finding, further analysis was performed to identify associations with ORT. Multivariable analysis demonstrated that VTS, BMI, final Gleason score, prostate volume, surgeon, and node dissection were significantly associated with ORT. The use of the VTS decreased mean ORT by 23.2 min when controlling for confounding factors (p < 0.001). The performance of a nerve sparing operation was found to decrease ORT by 15.9 min (p < 0.001), though more often performed for lower-risk disease. CONCLUSION The use of a novel VTS demonstrated decreased ORT in patients undergoing RALP when controlling for confounding factors. Prospective randomized trials are needed to evaluate its ultimate benefit in various surgical cohorts.","George, Arvin K; Wimhofer, Reinhard; Viola, Kate V; Pernegger, Markus; Costamoling, Walter; Kavoussi, Louis R; Loidl, Wolfgang",World journal of urology,287,31

All specialities have changed their way of working during the pandemic. In this study, we evaluated the impact of COVID-19 on the practice of interventional pulmonology at our centre. All interventional pulmonology procedures done during the three months after implementation of lockdown were evaluated retrospectively for patient demographics, clinical diagnosis, indication for procedure and diagnostic accuracy. The changes in practices, additional human resources requirement, the additional cost per procedure and impact on resident training were also assessed. Procedures done during the month of January 2020 were used as controls for comparison. Twenty-two flexible bronchoscopies (75.8%), four semirigid thoracoscopies (13.7%) and three EBUS-TBNAs (10.3%) were carried out during three month lockdown period as compared to 174 during January 2020. Twenty-three of the procedures were for the diagnostic indication (79%), and six were therapeutic (20.6%). The diagnostic yield in suspected neoplasm was 100% while for suspected infections was 58.3%. The percentage of independent procedures being done by residents reduced from 45.4% to 0%. The workforce required per procedure increased from 0.75 to 4-8, and the additional cost per procedure came out to be 135 USD. To conclude, COVID 19 has impacted the interventional pulmonology services in various ways and brought about a need to reorganize the services, while also thinking of innovative ideas to reduce cost without compromising patient safety.","Tyagi, Rahul; Mittal, Saurabh; Madan, Karan; Mohan, Anant; Hadda, Vijay; Tiwari, Pawan; Guleria, Randeep",Monaldi archives for chest disease = Archivio Monaldi per le malattie del torace,287,33

The most common sialic acid in humans is a mono-N-acetylated version termed Neu5Ac (5-N-acetyl-neuraminic acid). Many bacteria are known to access sialic acid using sialidase enzymes. However, in humans a high proportion of sialic acid contains a second acetyl group attached via an O-group, i.e. chiefly O-acetylated Neu5,9Ac2 or Neu5,4Ac2. This diacetylated sialic acid is not cleaved efficiently by many sialidases and in order to access diacetylated sialic acid, some organisms produce sialate-O-acetylesterases that catalyse the removal of the second acetyl group. In the present study, we performed bioinformatic and biochemical characterization of a putative sialate-O-acetylesterase from T. forsythia (NanS), which contains two putative SGNH-hydrolase domains related to sialate-O-acetylesterases from a range of organisms. Purification of recombinant NanS revealed an esterase that has activity against Neu5,9Ac2 and its glycolyl form Neu5Gc,9Ac. Importantly, the enzyme did not remove acetyl groups positioned at the 4-O position (Neu5,4Ac2). In addition NanS can act upon complex N-glycans released from a glycoprotein [erythropoietin (EPO)], bovine submaxillary mucin and oral epithelial cell-bound glycans. When incubated with its cognate sialidase, NanS increased sialic acid release from mucin and oral epithelial cell surfaces, implying that this esterase improves sialic acid harvesting for this pathogen and potentially other members of the oral microbiome. In summary, we have characterized a novel sialate-O-acetylesterase that contributes to the sialobiology of this important human pathogen and has potential applications in the analysis of sialic acid diacetylation of biologics in the pharmaceutical industry.","Phansopa, Chatchawal; Kozak, Radoslaw P; Liew, Li Phing; Frey, Andrew M; Farmilo, Thomas; Parker, Jennifer L; Kelly, David J; Emery, Robert J; Thomson, Rebecca I; Royle, Louise; Gardner, Richard A; Spencer, Daniel I R; Stafford, Graham P",The Biochemical journal,287,33

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS A search of the current literature was conducted using the MEDLINE and Embase databases. This search, limited to studies performed in humans and published in English between January 1, 1990 and October 31, 2009, included the terms 'acquired pneumonia', 'associated pneumonia', 'nursing home', 'long-term care', 'institution', and 'healthcare'. RESULTS Older age, male gender, swallowing difficulty, and inability to take oral medications are all significant risk factors for pneumonia. Medications such as antipsychotics and anticholinergics, histamine receptor blockers and proton pump inhibitors have also been linked to higher risk of pneumonia. The etiology of NHAP overlaps with that of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), with Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae as predominant pathogens in long-term care facilities. In patients who require hospitalization, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, and influenza virus have also been identified. In contrast, the etiology of severe NHAP overlaps with that of hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), with S. aureus, including methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and enteric Gram-negative bacilli as important causative pathogens. Therapy is dependent on disease severity and, on the treatment setting. Respiratory fluoroquinolones or β-lactams plus a macrolide are recommended in patients with NHAP. Patients hospitalized with severe NHAP may require triple combination therapy that covers both MRSA and P. aeruginosa. However, there is little evidence of the clinical superiority of one regimen over another, making it challenging to establish guidelines for the treatment of NHAP in the nursing home setting. CONCLUSION There is a pressing need for clinical trials of antibiotic therapy in nursing home patients that would help establish uniform guidelines to standardize therapy in the nursing home setting.","El-Solh, Ali A; Niederman, Mike S; Drinka, Paul",Current medical research and opinion,287,12

OBJECTIVES We tested the hypothesis that recruited lung areas do not resume elastic properties of adjacent baby lung. METHODS Twenty-five anesthetized, mechanically ventilated pigs were studied. Four lung-healthy pigs served as controls and the remaining 21 were divided into three groups (n = 7 each) in which lung injury was produced by surfactant lavage, lipopolysaccharide infusion, or hydrochloride inhalation. Computed tomography scans, respiratory mechanics, and gas exchange parameters were recorded under three conditions: at baseline, during lung recruitment maneuver, and at end-expiration and end-inspiration when ventilating after an open lung protocol. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS During recruitment maneuver and open lung protocol, the gas volume entering the insufficiently aerated compartment was 96% (75-117%) and 48% (41-63%) (median [interquartile range]) of the functional residual capacity measured before and at zero end-expiratory pressure, respectively. Nonetheless, the volume of hyperinflated lung increased during both recruitment maneuver (by 1-28% of total lung volume; P < 0.01) and open lung protocol ventilation at end-inspiration (by 1-15% of total lung volume; P < 0.01). Regional elastance of recruited lung tissue was consistently higher than that of the baby lung regardless of the ARDS model (P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS Alveolar recruitment is not protective against hyperinflation of the baby lung because lung parenchyma is inhomogeneous during ventilation with the open lung strategy.","Grasso, Salvatore; Stripoli, Tania; Sacchi, Marianna; Trerotoli, Paolo; Staffieri, Francesco; Franchini, Delia; De Monte, Valentina; Valentini, Valerio; Pugliese, Paolo; Crovace, Antonio; Driessen, Bernd; Fiore, Tommaso",American journal of respiratory and critical care medicine,287,1

S-1, an oral fluoropyrimidine, is one of the standard regimens in adjuvant chemotherapy, and is also used in first-line treatment for advanced/metastatic gastric cancer. It is controversial as to whether the same treatment strategy can be applied for patients who develop recurrence after adjuvant chemotherapy and those who did not receive adjuvant chemotherapy. To investigate this issue, we compared the outcomes of patients who developed recurrences after treatment with or without adjuvant chemotherapy using the results of the Adjuvant Chemotherapy Trial of S-1 for Gastric Cancer (ACTS-GC). METHODS Patients who had confirmed recurrence in the ACTS-GC trial were analyzed. We defined 2 independent cohorts. Cohort 1 patients were divided by whether they received adjuvant chemotherapy (adjuvant S-1 group and surgery-only group). Cohort 2 patients were divided by whether they received a regimen including S-1 (IS) or not including S-1 (NIS) after recurrence. RESULTS A total of 375 patients experienced recurrence (160 in the adjuvant S-1 group and 215 in the surgery-only group). In cohort 1, the median time from recurrence to death (TFRD) was 11.4 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 8.4-13.9) in the adjuvant S-1 group and 11.3 months (95% CI, 9.7-13.1) in the surgery-only group (hazard ratio [HR], 1.05; 95% CI, 0.84-1.31). In cohort 2, 292 patients received chemotherapy after recurrence and were divided into the IS (n = 189) or the NIS group (n = 103). The median TFRD was 13.9 months (95% CI, 12.7-15.6) in the IS group and 8.1 months (95% CI, 6.6-9.7) in the NIS group (HR, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.45-0.76), and there was no significant interaction between the adjuvant S-1 group and surgery-only group. CONCLUSION Adjuvant chemotherapy with S-1 prolonged overall survival without influencing the TFRD. The same treatment strategy may be applied for patients who develop recurrence after adjuvant chemotherapy and those who did not receive adjuvant chemotherapy. TRIAL REGISTRATION NCT00152217 .

Most of these cases are not diagnosed preoperatively and the surgical approach is dependent on the type present and associated intraoperative findings. We present a case of a preoperatively diagnosed Amyand's hernia in a man who underwent treatment by simultaneous laparoscopic totally extraperitoneal repair and laparoscopic appendectomy. CASE PRESENTATION We encountered the case of a 76-year-old Japanese man with a right inguinal pain. Ultrasound and computed tomography confirmed his vermiform appendix herniated into the right inguinal canal. We managed a simultaneous laparoscopic total extraperitoneal inguinal hernia repair with mesh and laparoscopic appendectomy. He was discharged without any postoperative morbidity. CONCLUSIONS We recommend laparoscopic appendectomy and totally extraperitoneal hernia repair with mesh after laparoscopic reduction for Amyand's hernia.,"Muroya, Daisuke; Sato, Shinji; Okabe, Masayuki; Kishimoto, Yukiya; Tayama, Keiichiro",Journal of medical case reports,287,20

However, they are still largely reserved for uncomplicated elective cases. To determine whether laparoscopic groin hernia repair can achieve similar results for acute strangulated hernias as laparoscopic cholecystectomy for acute cholecystitis, we analyzed and compared the results of emergency laparoscopic surgery and open repair for strangulated groin hernias performed by our team over the past 4 years. METHODS This is a retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data. We analyzed the results of patients admitted between January 2007 and January 2011 who were diagnosed with acute strangulated groin hernia and underwent emergency open or laparoscopic hernia repair during the same admission. Patients' demographic details, mode of presentation, type of hernia, intraoperative findings, operative time, postoperative course and complications were compared. RESULTS In total, 188 patients fulfilled the criteria for emergency surgical repair of strangulated groin hernias; 57 received laparoscopic and 131 received open repairs. The mean operative time was 79.82 ± 29.571 min and 80.75 ± 35.161 min, respectively. More laparotomies were performed in the open group (19 vs 0). The wound infection rate was significantly higher in the open group (12 vs 0). The mean hospital stay was shorter in the laparoscopic group (4.39 days vs 7.34 days). There was no mesh infection in either group. Recurrence occurred one case in the laparoscopic group and in three cases in the open group. CONCLUSIONS Emergency laparoscopic repair for strangulated groin hernias is feasible and appears to have a lower morbidity relative to open repair. Further study should be performed to evaluate its full potential.","Yang, G P C; Chan, C T Y; Lai, E C H; Chan, O C Y; Tang, C N; Li, M K W",Asian journal of endoscopic surgery,287,8
124429,124429,124429,Neurothrombectomy in the treatment of acute ischaemic stroke.,14.864952,8.292001,2013,"Postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) represents a potentially debilitating and often undertreated form of neuropathic pain that disproportionately affects vulnerable populations, including the elderly and the immunocompromised. Varicella zoster infection is almost universally prevalent, making prevention of acute herpes zoster (AHZ) infection and prompt diagnosis and aggressive management of PHN of critical importance. Despite the recent development of a herpes zoster vaccine, prevention of AHZ is not yet widespread or discussed in PHN treatment guidelines. Diagnosis of PHN requires consideration of recognized PHN signs and known risk factors, including advanced age, severe prodromal pain, severe rash, and AHZ location on the trigeminal dermatomes or brachial plexus. PHN pain is typically localized, unilateral and chronic, but may be constant, intermittent, spontaneous and/or evoked. PHN is likely to interfere with sleep and daily activities. First-line therapies for PHN include tricyclic antidepressants, gabapentin and pregabalin, and the lidocaine 5 % patch. Second-line therapies include strong and weak opioids and topical capsaicin cream or 8 % patch. Tricyclic antidepressants, gabapentinoids and strong opioids are effective but are also associated with systemic adverse events that may limit their use in many patients, most notably those with significant medical comorbidities or advanced age. Of the topical therapies, the topical lidocaine 5 % patch has proven more effective than capsaicin cream or 8 % patch and has a more rapid onset of action than the other first-line therapies or capsaicin. Given the low systemic drug exposure, adverse events with topical therapies are generally limited to application-site reactions, which are typically mild and transient with lidocaine 5 % patch, but may involve treatment-limiting discomfort with capsaicin cream or 8 % patch. Based on available clinical data, clinicians should consider administering the herpes zoster vaccine to all patients aged 60 years and older. Clinicians treating patients with PHN may consider a trial of lidocaine 5 % patch monotherapy before resorting to a systemic therapy, or alternatively, may consider administering the lidocaine 5 % patch in combination with a tricyclic antidepressant or a gabapentinoid to provide more rapid analgesic response and lower the dose requirement of systemic therapies.","Nalamachu, Srinivas; Morley-Forster, Patricia",Drugs & aging,287,26

These children represent a diverse group, with some going on to present with asthma at school age and others experiencing complete resolution of symptoms. The primary care physician is faced with a dilemma of when to recommend daily therapy. He or she must also answer parents' concerns, often expressed as, ""Does my child have asthma?"" and ""Will my child have to take medication the rest of his or her life?"" This article presents recent studies and recommendations that can guide the physician in approaching the child and the parent with rational management. The emphasis is on viewing recurrent wheezing as a continuum requiring a plan of monitoring that starts with the very first episode. Using background information from the parents and a history of the child's allergic disposition, one can discuss with parents the risks of developing asthma and, together with planned monitoring, prescribe appropriate management. The primary care physician can plan management by using the Asthma Predictive Index and employing specific questions for features present during the intervals between acute episodes. Together with close monitoring, the physician will have a compass that effectively directs rational management.","Bloomberg, Gordon R",Postgraduate medicine,287,20

Blood samples were collected from 21 healthy Holstein cows at 5, 10, 14, and 21 d postpartum. Serum samples were used to measure concentrations of total calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, total protein, albumin, globulin, cholesterol, urea, glucose, gamma-glutamyl transferase, aspartate aminotransferase, glutamate dehydrogenase, haptoglobin (Hp), β-hydroxybutyrate, non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA), and insulin-like growth factor-1. The shift of percentage of activated neutrophils for phagocytosis (PPC) and oxidative burst (POB) and the median fluorescence intensity (MFI) for PC (MFIPC), OB (MFIOB), and endocytic and proteolytic degradation measured via DQ-ovalbumin (MFIDQ) were evaluated using flow cytometry. Mixed linear regression models were used to assess the associations of serum concentrations of metabolites and blood neutrophil counts with each neutrophil function assay outcome accounting for d postpartum, parity, and body condition score. Pearson correlation tests (r) were used to describe the relationships of metabolites and neutrophil counts with neutrophil function assays that were significant in the regression models. Greater serum concentrations of Hp were associated with lesser OB function (POB and MFIOB; r = -0.2 for both), but greater PPC and MFIDQ (r = 0.3 for both). Greater serum NEFA and cholesterol were associated with lesser (r = -0.3) and greater (r = 0.2) POB function, respectively. Blood neutrophil counts were associated with PPC (r = -0.2) and MFIDQ (r = -0.3). At 5 d postpartum, greater serum total protein was associated with greater OB function (POB and MFIOB; r = 0.4 for both). Other markers were not associated with neutrophil function. Some metabolic and inflammatory markers in healthy postpartum dairy cows were associated with circulating neutrophil function. However, these associations only explained a small proportion of the variance in neutrophil function. Serum Hp concentration was most associated with neutrophil function changes but had opposite directions of association with OB- and PC-related functions. Future studies should focus on understanding the mechanisms by which Hp and other metabolic indicators affect neutrophil function in healthy and diseased postpartum dairy cows.","Bogado Pascottini, O; Bruinjé, T C; Couto Serrenho, R; Mion, B; LeBlanc, S J",Veterinary immunology and immunopathology,287,31

DESIGN An interpretative phenomenology was used to discover the lived experiences of the nurses and physicians of Tabriz hospitals, Iran, with family presence during resuscitation (FPDR). A total of 12 nurses and 9 physicians were interviewed over a 6-month period. METHODS The interviews were audio recorded and semistructured, and were transcribed verbatim. Van Manen's technique was used for data analysis. FINDINGS Two major themes and 10 subthemes emerged, including destructive presence (cessation of resuscitation, interference in resuscitation, disruption to the resuscitation team's focus, argument with the resuscitation team, and adverse mental image in the family) and supportive presence (trust in the resuscitation team, collaboration with the resuscitation team, alleviating the family's concern and settling their nerves, increasing the family's satisfaction, and reducing conflict with resuscitation team members). CONCLUSIONS Participants stated that FPDR may work as a double-edged sword for the family and resuscitation team, hurting or preserving quality. It is thus recommended that guidelines be created to protect patients' and families' rights, while considering the positive aspects of the phenomenon for hospitals. CLINICAL RELEVANCE A liaison support person would act to decrease family anxiety levels and would be able to de-escalate any potentially aggressive or confrontational events during resuscitation. Well-trained and expert cardiopulmonary resuscitation team members do not have any stress in the presence of family during resuscitation. Resuscitation events tend to be prolonged when family members are allowed to be present.","Hassankhani, Hadi; Zamanzadeh, Vahid; Rahmani, Azad; Haririan, Hamidreza; Porter, Joanne E",Journal of nursing scholarship : an official publication of Sigma Theta Tau International Honor Society of Nursing,287,8

When weaponized, it can cause inhalation anthrax, the deadliest form of the disease. Due to the rapid course of inhalation anthrax, delays in initiation of antibiotics may decrease survival chances. Because a rapid response would require cooperation from the public, there is a need to understand the public's response to possible mass dispensing programs. To examine the public's response to a mass prophylaxis program, this study used a nationally representative poll of 1,092 adults, supplemented by a targeted focus on 3 metropolitan areas where anthrax attacks occurred in 2001: New York City (n=517), Washington, DC (n=509), and Trenton/Mercer County, NJ (n=507). The poll was built around a ""worst-case scenario"" in which cases of inhalation anthrax are discovered without an identified source and the entire population of a city or town is asked to receive antibiotic prophylaxis within a 48-hour period. Findings from this poll provide important signs of public willingness to comply with public health recommendations for obtaining antibiotics from a dispensing site, although they also indicate that public health officials may face several challenges to compliance, including misinformation about the contagiousness of inhalation anthrax; fears about personal safety in crowds; distrust of government agencies to provide sufficient, safe, and effective medicine; and hesitation about ingesting antibiotic pills after receiving them. In general, people living in areas where anthrax attacks occurred in 2001 had responses similar to those of the nation as a whole.","SteelFisher, Gillian; Blendon, Robert; Ross, Laura J; Collins, Blanche C; Ben-Porath, Eran N; Bekheit, Mark M; Mailhot, Johanna R","Biosecurity and bioterrorism : biodefense strategy, practice, and science",287,1

METHODS We searched PubMed until May 31, 2012, for randomized clinical trials using the following search items: atrial fibrillation, anticoagulation, warfarin, and previous stroke or transient ischemic attack. Studies had to be phase III trials in atrial fibrillation patients comparing warfarin with a non-VKA currently on the market or with the intention to be brought to the market in North America or Europe. Analysis was performed on intention-to-treat basis. A fixed-effects model was used as more appropriate than a random-effects model when combining a small number of studies. RESULTS Among 47 potentially eligible articles, 3 were included in the meta-analysis. In 14 527 patients, non-VKAs were associated with a significant reduction of stroke/systemic embolism (odds ratios, 0.85 [95% CI, 074-0.99]; relative risk reduction, 14%; absolute risk reduction, 0.7%; number needed to treat, 134 over 1.8-2.0 years) compared with warfarin. Non-VKAs were also associated with a significant reduction of major bleeding compared with warfarin (odds ratios, 0.86 [95% CI, 075-0.99]; relative risk reduction, 13%; absolute risk reduction, 0.8%; number needed to treat, 125), mainly driven by the significant reduction of hemorrhagic stroke (odds ratios, 0.44 [95% CI, 032-0.62]; relative risk reduction, 57.9%; absolute risk reduction, 0.7%; number needed to treat, 139). CONCLUSIONS In the context of the significant limitations of combining the results of disparate trials of different agents, non-VKAs seem to be associated with a significant reduction in rates of stroke or systemic embolism, hemorrhagic stroke, and major bleeding when compared with warfarin in patients with previous stroke or transient ischemic attack.","Ntaios, George; Papavasileiou, Vasileios; Diener, Hans-Christoph; Makaritsis, Konstantinos; Michel, Patrik",Stroke,287,1

However, little is documented about how patients and health workers perceive patients' rights during care-seeking practices. METHODS A qualitative study was conducted in four hospitals in Ethiopia through 8 focus group discussions with patients and 14 individual interviews with diverse groups of patients, caretakers, and 14 interviews with health workers. Participants were recruited through a purposive sampling method to meet the saturation of ideas about patients' rights. The sampled patients, caretakers, and professionals were enlisted from various departments in the hospitals. The data analysis was assisted by ATLAS.ti 7.1.4. RESULTS The study identified three major categories of healthcare rights (clinical, socio-cultural, and organizational), incorporating supporting elements of education, engagement, and empowerment. Study participants reported detailed rights the patients would have during hospital visits which included the right to timely access to care and treatment, adequate medications) with full respect, dignity, and without any discrimination. Patients widely perceived that they had the right to tell their illness history and know their illness in the language they can understand. It was also widely agreed that patients have the right to be educated and guided to make informed choices of services, procedures, and medications. Additionally, patients reported that they had the right to be accompanied by caretakers together with the right to use facilities and resources and get instructions on how to utilize these resources, the right to be protected from exposure to infections and unsafe conditions in hospitals, right to get a diet of their preference, and right to referral for further care. Nevertheless, there was a common concern among patients and caretakers that these rights were mostly non-existent in practice which were due to barriers related to patients (fear of consequence; a sense of dependency, feeling of powerlessness, perceptions of low medical literacy), health workers (negligence, lack of awareness and recognition of patient rights, undermining patients), and facilities' readiness and support, including lack of guiding framework. CONCLUSIONS Perceived patients' rights in the context of hospital visits were profoundly numerous, ranging from the right to access clinical and non-clinical services that are humanely respectful, fulfilling socio-cultural contexts, and in a manner that is organizationally coordinated. Nonetheless, the rights were not largely realized and fulfilled. Engaging, educating, and empowering patients, caretakers, and health care providers supported with policy framework could help to move towards patient-centered and right-based healthcare whereby patients' rights are protected and fulfilled in such resource-limited settings.","Birhanu, Zewdie; Abamecha, Fira; Berhanu, Nimona; Dukessa, Tadesse; Beharu, Mesfin; Legesse, Shimelis; Kebede, Yohannes",PloS one,287,16

The experimental and theoretical analysis allows excluding the possible thermal effect or hot electron transfer. We found that plasmon interaction with unsymmetrical ISs led to the intramolecular excitation of electron followed by the regioselective cleavage of C-I bond with the formation of electron-rich radical species, which cannot be explained by the hot electron excitation or thermal effects. The high regioselectivity is explained by the direct excitation of the electron to LUMO with the formation of the dissociative excited state according to quantum-chemical modeling, which provides a novel opportunities to the fine control of reactivity using plasmon energy.","Miliutina, Elena; Guselnikova, Olga; Soldatova, Natalia S; Bainova, Polina; Elashnikov, Roman; Fitl, Přemysl; Kurtén, Theo; Yusubov, Mekhman S; Švorčík, Václav; Valiev, Rashid Rinatovich; Chehimi, Mohamed Mehdi; Lyutakov, Oleksiy; Postnikov, Pavel S",The journal of physical chemistry letters,287,23

There were 45 women (2.2%) with complications (bladder injury, 26; bowel injury, 9; vascular injury, 9; and ureteral injury, 1). A history of previous cesarean section (twice or more) was a significant risk factor for complications [odds ratio (OR) 3.38]. A body mass index ≥30 kg/m(2) (OR 2.98), history of previous myomectomy (OR 6.19) and uterine weight ≥500 g (OR 3.24) independently influenced the risk of conversion to laparotomy. CONCLUSIONS Risk factors identified in this study include a history of previous cesarean section (twice or more) and myomectomy, body mass index ≥30 kg/m(2) and uterine weight ≥500 g. The findings may be useful in counseling women preoperatively about the potential complications of LAVH.","Song, Taejong; Kim, Tae-Joong; Kang, Heeseok; Lee, Yoo-Young; Choi, Chel Hun; Lee, Jeong-Won; Kim, Byoung-Gie; Bae, Duk-Soo",Acta obstetricia et gynecologica Scandinavica,287,31

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) and osteoporosis often co-exist in older adults, and they present a major healthcare challenge. CKD mineral and bone disorder (CKD-MBD) occurs as renal function declines and this syndrome affects most patients in CKD stages 4 and 5. The biochemical abnormalities of CKD-MBD, renal bone disease and risk factors associated with age-related bone loss and osteoporosis lead to a cumulative effect on fracture risk and mortality. There is a need for routine evaluation of fracture risk and fracture prevention in this population. Measurement of bone mineral density (BMD) and the use of the FRAX tool have predictive value for incident fractures in the general population and in CKD. This enables physicians to identify CKD patients most at risk of sustaining a fragility fracture and allows a more targeted approach to fracture prevention. Data analysis from the pivotal trials of therapeutic agents used in osteoporosis show that these drugs can be considered in mild and moderate CKD (stages 1-3 CKD). Off-label drug use in patients with CKD-MBD and more severe renal impairment (CKD stages 4 and 5) could offer significant benefits to sub-groups of patients when carefully tailored to each individual's bone turnover and calcium and phosphate balance. However, this requires a selective approach and treatment decisions based on inference from pathophysiology while we await further trials. Guidelines advocate the correction and/or reduction of the biochemical abnormalities of CKD-MBD before initiation of treatment with osteoporosis drugs and close monitoring during treatment.","Hampson, Geeta; Elder, Grahame J; Cohen-Solal, Martine; Abrahamsen, Bo",Endocrine,287,5

When the observed variables are collected at various occasions on the same statistical units, the data have a three-way structure and standard factor analysis may fail. To overcome these limitations, three-way models, such as the Parafac model, can be adopted. It is often seen as an extension of principal component analysis able to discover unique latent components. The structural version, i.e., as a reparameterization of the covariance matrix, has been also formulated but rarely investigated. In this article, such a formulation is studied by discussing under what conditions factor uniqueness is preserved. It is shown that, under mild conditions, such a property holds even if the specific factors are assumed to be within-variable, or within-occasion, correlated and the model is modified to become scale invariant.","Giordani, Paolo; Rocci, Roberto; Bove, Giuseppe",Psychometrika,287,1

In this study, we seek to evaluate the feasibility of a non-invasive transcutaneous nerve stimulation method in generating haptic feedback in a transradial amputee subject as well as intact able-bodied subjects. APPROACH An electrode grid was placed on the skin along the medial side of the upper arm beneath the short head of the biceps brachii, in proximity to the median and ulnar nerves. Varying stimulation patterns were delivered to different electrode pairs, in order to emulate different types of sensations (Single Tap, Press-and-Hold, Double Tap) at different regions of the hand. Subjects then reported the magnitude of sensation by pressing on a force transducer to transform the qualitative haptic perception into a quantitative measurement. MAIN RESULTS Altering current stimulations through electrode pairs on the grid resulted in repeatable alterations in the percept regions of the hand. Most subjects reported spatial coverage of individual fingers or phalanges, which can resemble the whole hand through different pairs of stimulation electrodes. The different stimulation patterns were also differentiable by all subjects. The amputee subject also reported haptic sensations similar to the able-bodied subjects. SIGNIFICANCE Our findings demonstrated the capabilities of our transcutaneous stimulation method. Subjects were able to perceive spatially distinct sensations with graded magnitudes that emulated tapping and holding sensation in their hands. The elicitation of haptic sensations in the phantom hand of an amputee is a significant step in the development of our stimulation method, and provides insight into the future adaptation and implementation of prostheses with non-invasive sensory feedback to the users.","Shin, Henry; Watkins, Zach; Huang, He Helen; Zhu, Yong; Hu, Xiaogang",Journal of neural engineering,287,5

This is a cross-sectional study with students from two public and four private schools in the metropolitan region of Rio de Janeiro. Body dissatisfaction was evaluated using the Body Silhouette Scale, by the difference between the image they perceive as their current image and the one they would like to have. The association was assessed by hierarchical logistic regression multinomial model, by estimating odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI). Among the 1,019 adolescents evaluated (13-19 years), 75% showed body dissatisfaction, 41.4% wishing for a smaller silhouette and 33.7% wishing for larger silhouettes. The wish for a smaller silhouette was more significant in girls, overweight adolescents, those with an unsatisfactory meal pattern, and with higher waist circumference. Adolescents that had been exposed to teasing due to their body shape increased the probability of wishing for both smaller and larger silhouettes. Strategies are required for a more positive perception of body image, especially for girls and for overweight adolescents, which provide guidance on adequate meal consumption and prevent exposure to peer teasing, valuing coexistence and well-being in the face of existing bodily differences.","Carvalho, Giulia Xavier de; Nunes, Ana Paula Nogueira; Moraes, Claudia Leite; Veiga, Gloria Valeria da",Ciencia & saude coletiva,287,1

National figures from the UK suggest that 8.75% of over 170,000 caesarean sections are performed under general anaesthetic. We explored whether general anaesthesia rates for caesarean section changed during the peak of the pandemic across six maternity units in the north-west of England. We analysed anaesthetic information for 2480 caesarean sections across six maternity units from 1 April to 1 July 2020 (during the pandemic) and compared this information with data from 2555 caesarean sections performed at the same hospitals over a similar period in 2019. Primary outcome was change in general anaesthesia rate for caesarean section. Secondary outcomes included overall caesarean section rates, obstetric indications for caesarean section and regional to general anaesthesia conversion rates. A significant reduction (7.7 to 3.7%, p < 0.0001) in general anaesthetic rates, risk ratio (95%CI) 0.50 (0.39-0.93), was noted across hospitals during the pandemic. Regional to general anaesthesia conversion rates reduced (1.7 to 0.8%, p = 0.012), risk ratio (95%CI) 0.50 (0.29-0.86). Obstetric indications for caesarean sections did not change (p = 0.17) whilst the overall caesarean section rate increased (28.3 to 29.7%), risk ratio (95%CI) 1.02 (1.00-1.04), p = 0.052. Our analysis shows that general anaesthesia rates for caesarean section declined during the peak of the pandemic. Anaesthetic decision-making, recommendations from anaesthetic guidelines and presence of an on-site anaesthetic consultant in the delivery suite seem to be the key factors that influenced this decline.","Bhatia, K; Columb, M; Bewlay, A; Eccles, J; Hulgur, M; Jayan, N; Lie, J; Verma, D; Parikh, R",Anaesthesia,287,16

Recently, we have shown that the mouse model of predator odor trauma (POT) displayed contextual conditioning and core features of PTSD including sleep disturbances (hyperarousal) and retrieval of traumatic memories following exposure to objective reminders (re-experiencing). PTSD is a disorder of memory function. Since memory consolidation requires the expression of BDNF along with an activation of MAPK/pERK signaling pathway in limbic brain structures (hippocampus and amygdala) and sleep favors memory consolidation, we hypothesized that short-term sleep deprivation (SD, 3 hours), immediately after contextual conditioning will attenuate molecular correlates of memory consolidation, sleep disturbances, and memory consolidation. We performed two experiments in adult male C57BL/6J mice to test our hypothesis. Experiment 1 determined the effects of SD on contextual conditioning and changes in sleep wakefulness. Experiment 2 determined the effects of SD on contextual conditioning-induced changes in the expression of BDNF and pERK in hippocampus and amygdala. SD immediately after contextual conditioning (POT+SD group) significantly attenuated sleep disturbances, memory retrieval, and expression of pERK and BDNF in the hippocampus and amygdala as compared to POT-SD group (no SD after contextual conditioning). No significant differences were observed between POT+SD, NOC-SD (no contextual conditioning + no SD), and NOC+SD (no contextual conditioning + SD) groups. Memory consolidation requires sleep and the expression of pERK and BDNF in hippocampus and amygdala immediately after contextual conditioning in POT model of PTSD in mice.","Sharma, Rishi; Sahota, Pradeep; Thakkar, Mahesh M",Brain research,287,5

Composite mesh types have been developed to address the shortcomings of standard meshes. The authors evaluated the host reaction to intraperitoneal placement of a novel composite material. MATERIALS AND METHODS A comparison of an innovative polypropylene/polylactide composite mesh was made to parietex composite (PCO), Proceed, and DualMesh. Eighteen meshes per group were implanted on intact peritoneum in New Zealand white rabbits. The main outcome measures included the formation of visceral adhesions, adhesion tenacity, tensiometric measurements, and histological analysis. Evaluations of adhesions were made at 1, 4, and 16 weeks using a 2-mm minilaparoscopy. RESULTS There were no significant differences in the mean adhesion scores between the composite mesh types at week 1 (P = .15) and week 16 (P = .06). At 4 weeks, PCO had significantly fewer adhesions when compared with the other 3 mesh types (P = .02). Adhesion tenacity was also equivalent within the group at 16 weeks (P = .06). Tensiometry and histological analysis revealed no statistically significant differences between the mesh types. CONCLUSIONS Four different composite mesh types had equivalent intra-abdominal soft tissue attachments in a rabbit model after a 16-week implantation period. PCO demonstrated the lowest mean adhesion score of each mesh type. Each mesh exhibited equivalent stiffness and energy to failure after explantation. The 4 composite mesh types demonstrated the successful formation of a neoperitoneum and comparable host biocompatibility as evidenced by similar degrees of inflammation.","Dolce, Charles J; Keller, Jennifer E; Stefanidis, Dimitrios; Walters, K Christian; Heath, Jessica J; Lincourt, Amy L; Norton, H James; Kercher, Kent W; Heniford, B Todd",Surgical innovation,287,27

We review alternative pricing strategies (cost-recovery models, monetary prizes, advanced market commitments) for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) drugs, vaccines, and diagnostics. Hybrid pricing strategies are undoubtedly needed in a pandemic, but even in a public health crisis, value-based pricing is important. Cost-effectiveness analyses can inform pricing. Ideally, analyses would be conducted from both a health system and societal perspective. Incorporating the added value of social benefits into cost effectiveness analyses doesn't mean manufacturers should capture the entire societal benefit of a diagnostic, vaccine, or therapy. Such analyses can provide important information and help policy makers consider the full costs and benefits of products and the wide-ranging ramifications of their actions.

Contact tracing identifies people who were recently in contact with an infected individual, in order to isolate them and reduce further transmission. Digital technology could be implemented to augment and accelerate manual contact tracing. Digital tools for contact tracing may be grouped into three areas: 1) outbreak response; 2) proximity tracing; and 3) symptom tracking. We conducted a rapid review on the effectiveness of digital solutions to contact tracing during infectious disease outbreaks. OBJECTIVES To assess the benefits, harms, and acceptability of personal digital contact tracing solutions for identifying contacts of an identified positive case of an infectious disease. SEARCH METHODS An information specialist searched the literature from 1 January 2000 to 5 May 2020 in CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and Embase. Additionally, we screened the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register. SELECTION CRITERIA We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), cluster-RCTs, quasi-RCTs, cohort studies, cross-sectional studies and modelling studies, in general populations. We preferentially included studies of contact tracing during infectious disease outbreaks (including COVID-19, Ebola, tuberculosis, severe acute respiratory syndrome virus, and Middle East respiratory syndrome) as direct evidence, but considered comparative studies of contact tracing outside an outbreak as indirect evidence. The digital solutions varied but typically included software (or firmware) for users to install on their devices or to be uploaded to devices provided by governments or third parties. Control measures included traditional or manual contact tracing, self-reported diaries and surveys, interviews, other standard methods for determining close contacts, and other technologies compared to digital solutions (e.g. electronic medical records). DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Two review authors independently screened records and all potentially relevant full-text publications. One review author extracted data for 50% of the included studies, another extracted data for the remaining 50%; the second review author checked all the extracted data. One review author assessed quality of included studies and a second checked the assessments. Our outcomes were identification of secondary cases and close contacts, time to complete contact tracing, acceptability and accessibility issues, privacy and safety concerns, and any other ethical issue identified. Though modelling studies will predict estimates of the effects of different contact tracing solutions on outcomes of interest, cohort studies provide empirically measured estimates of the effects of different contact tracing solutions on outcomes of interest. We used GRADE-CERQual to describe certainty of evidence from qualitative data and GRADE for modelling and cohort studies. MAIN RESULTS We identified six cohort studies reporting quantitative data and six modelling studies reporting simulations of digital solutions for contact tracing. Two cohort studies also provided qualitative data. Three cohort studies looked at contact tracing during an outbreak, whilst three emulated an outbreak in non-outbreak settings (schools). Of the six modelling studies, four evaluated digital solutions for contact tracing in simulated COVID-19 scenarios, while two simulated close contacts in non-specific outbreak settings. Modelling studies Two modelling studies provided low-certainty evidence of a reduction in secondary cases using digital contact tracing (measured as average number of secondary cases per index case - effective reproductive number (R eff)). One study estimated an 18% reduction in R eff with digital contact tracing compared to self-isolation alone, and a 35% reduction with manual contact-tracing. Another found a reduction in R eff for digital contact tracing compared to self-isolation alone (26% reduction) and a reduction in R eff for manual contact tracing compared to self-isolation alone (53% reduction). However, the certainty of evidence was reduced by unclear specifications of their models, and assumptions about the effectiveness of manual contact tracing (assumed 95% to 100% of contacts traced), and the proportion of the population who would have the app (53%). Cohort studies Two cohort studies provided very low-certainty evidence of a benefit of digital over manual contact tracing. During an Ebola outbreak, contact tracers using an app found twice as many close contacts per case on average than those using paper forms. Similarly, after a pertussis outbreak in a US hospital, researchers found that radio-frequency identification identified 45 close contacts but searches of electronic medical records found 13. The certainty of evidence was reduced by concerns about imprecision, and serious risk of bias due to the inability of contact tracing study designs to identify the true number of close contacts. One cohort study provided very low-certainty evidence that an app could reduce the time to complete a set of close contacts. The certainty of evidence for this outcome was affected by imprecision and serious risk of bias. Contact tracing teams reported that digital data entry and management systems were faster to use than paper systems and possibly less prone to data loss. Two studies from lower- or middle-income countries, reported that contact tracing teams found digital systems simpler to use and generally preferred them over paper systems; they saved personnel time, reportedly improved accuracy with large data sets, and were easier to transport compared with paper forms. However, personnel faced increased costs and internet access problems with digital compared to paper systems. Devices in the cohort studies appeared to have privacy from contacts regarding the exposed or diagnosed users. However, there were risks of privacy breaches from snoopers if linkage attacks occurred, particularly for wearable devices. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS The effectiveness of digital solutions is largely unproven as there are very few published data in real-world outbreak settings. Modelling studies provide low-certainty evidence of a reduction in secondary cases if digital contact tracing is used together with other public health measures such as self-isolation. Cohort studies provide very low-certainty evidence that digital contact tracing may produce more reliable counts of contacts and reduce time to complete contact tracing. Digital solutions may have equity implications for at-risk populations with poor internet access and poor access to digital technology. Stronger primary research on the effectiveness of contact tracing technologies is needed, including research into use of digital solutions in conjunction with manual systems, as digital solutions are unlikely to be used alone in real-world settings. Future studies should consider access to and acceptability of digital solutions, and the resultant impact on equity. Studies should also make acceptability and uptake a primary research question, as privacy concerns can prevent uptake and effectiveness of these technologies.","Anglemyer, Andrew; Moore, Theresa Hm; Parker, Lisa; Chambers, Timothy; Grady, Alice; Chiu, Kellia; Parry, Matthew; Wilczynska, Magdalena; Flemyng, Ella; Bero, Lisa",The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,287,31

Despite administration of dual antiplatelet therapy, there may also be subclinical cortical vein thrombosis that contributed to DAVF formation. In addition to the aforementioned mechanisms, increased inflammation induced by VSS may upregulate vascular endothelial growth factor and platelet-derived growth factor expression and also promote DAVF pathogenesis. Since VSS has been used to obliterate DAVFs, DAVF formation after VSS may seem counterintuitive. Previous stents have generally been closed cell, stainless steel designs used to maximize radial compression of the fistulous sinus wall.

A previous national shortage of papaverine prompted evaluation of an alternative, effective vasodilator. This study aims to assess the experience of a solution of verapamil and nitroglycerin (VG) as a potential alternative pharmacologic vasodilator. STUDY DESIGN Retrospective case series. SETTING Two tertiary academic medical centers. SUBJECTS AND METHODS Among 298 patients, 306 consecutive free tissue transfers performed between 2014 and 2017 for head and neck defect reconstruction utilized a VG solution. Patient and flap characteristics, intraoperative patient and flap complications, and postoperative complications were reviewed. Diameter of the cervical recipient artery was measured intraoperatively before and after topical application of the VG solution in a subset of 43 patients (44 flaps). RESULTS Flaps included fibula, radial forearm, subscapular system, and anterolateral thigh. In total, 3 (0.98%) flaps failed with varied etiology unrelated to the VG solution (venous thrombosis, arterial anastomosis thrombosis, physical damage to the perforator). Specific to topical application of the VG solution, the mean recipient artery diameter increased from 2.1 to 3.1 mm, a 48% increase (P < .01). There were no intraoperative cardiac events or complications attributable to the VG solution. CONCLUSION We describe the use of a VG solution for pharmacologic vasodilation during microvascular free tissue transfer. Its use was associated with an acceptable incidence of adverse events, none of which were directly attributable to the VG solution. Apparent and sustained vasodilation was demonstrated. The VG solution represents a safe and efficacious alternative to papaverine in microvascular surgery.","Seth, Rahul; Badran, Karam W; Cedars, Elizabeth; Plonowska, Karolina; Benjamin, Tania; Saggi, Satvir; Knott, P Daniel; Heaton, Chase M; Blackwell, Keith E",Otolaryngology--head and neck surgery : official journal of American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery,287,1

Although drug resistance in dermatophytes is not routinely investigated, resistance in Trichophyton spp. is increasingly reported worldwide. The highest rates are observed in India (36% and 68% for terbinafine (MIC ≥4 mg/L) and fluconazole (MICs ≥16 mg/L), respectively), and apparently involve the spread of a unique clade related to the T. mentagrophytes/T. interdigitale complex. OBJECTIVES The EUCAST-AFST (European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing Subcommittee on Antifungal Susceptibility Testing) has released a new method (E.Def 11.0) for the antifungal susceptibility testing against microconidia-forming dermatophytes including tentative MIC ranges for QC control strains and tentative breakpoints against T. rubrum and T. interdigitale. Here, the details of the new procedure E.Def 11.0 are described. SOURCES This technical note is based on the multicentre validation of the EUCAST dermatophyte AFST method, the mould testing method (E.Def 9.3.2) and the updated QC tables for antifungal susceptibility testing document, v 5.0 (available on the EUCAST website). CONTENTS The method is based on the EUCAST microdilution method for moulds but significant differences include: a) an altered test medium selective for dermatophytes; b) an altered incubation time and temperature; and c) a different endpoint criterion (spectrophotometric determination) of fungal growth. It can easily be implemented in laboratories already performing EUCAST microdilution methods and has been validated for terbinafine, voriconazole, itraconazole and amorolfine against T. rubrum and T. interdigitale. IMPLICATIONS This standardised procedure with automated endpoint reading will allow broader implementation of susceptibility testing of dermatophytes and thus facilitate earlier appropriate therapy. This is important, as resistance is rapidly emerging and largely underdiagnosed.","Arendrup, Maiken Cavling; Kahlmeter, Gunnar; Guinea, Jesus; Meletiadis, Joseph",Clinical microbiology and infection : the official publication of the European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases,287,28

However, in group B, the mean %EWL was 42.1 ± 13.4, 63.8 ± 19.8, 80.0 ± 22.1, and 81.5 ± 22.9% at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months, respectively. Patients in group B experienced statistically significant greater weight loss than patients in group A. Statistically significant greater weight regain was seen in group A. Group A had a higher incidence of reflux symptoms (six patients; 11%) than group B (four patients; 7.1%). CONCLUSIONS Radical antral resection in association with LSG safely potentiates the restrictive effect achieved and may result in greater and better maintained weight loss.","Obeidat, Firas; Shanti, Hiba; Mismar, Ayman; Albsoul, Nader; Al-Qudah, Mohammad",Obesity surgery,287,14

But if social learning is indeed more efficient (whether less costly or more accurate) than individual learning, it raises the question of why would anyone engage in individual information seeking, which is a necessary condition for social learning's efficacy. We propose an evolutionary model solving this paradox, provided agents (i) aim not only at information quality but also vie for audience and prestige, and (ii) do not only value accuracy but also reward originality-allowing them to alleviate herding effects. We find that under some conditions (large enough success rate of informed agents and intermediate taste for popularity), both social learning's higher accuracy and the taste for original opinions are evolutionarily-stable, within a mutually beneficial division of labour-like equilibrium. When such conditions are not met, the system most often converges towards mutually detrimental equilibria.","de Courson, Benoît; Fitouchi, Léo; Bouchaud, Jean-Philippe; Benzaquen, Michael",Scientific reports,287,1

However, as endovascular techniques continue to progress, they are increasingly applied to this patient population, especially to the high-risk surgical cohort or patients with limited surgical options. This enthusiasm to employ endovascular interventions in IP CLI is accompanied by persistent controversies, as demonstrated in the recent literature. Percutaneous transluminal balloon angioplasty has been the predominant endovascular intervention applied to treat IP CLI and recent literature supports its role. The durability of percutaneous transluminal balloon angioplasty is limited, and thus this intervention is recommended for high-risk patients with limited life expectancy. Bare-metal stents for IP CLI currently do not have supportive data to warrant their use as a primary treatment. Newer drug-eluting stents improve patency and prevent restenosis, but they do not significantly improve patient clinical status compared with bare-metal stents alone. Drug-coated balloons are still relatively new tools in this arena and evidence of their safety and clear efficacy are still lacking. The data on atherectomy, in all of its forms, for IP CLI are overall variable, without any clear benefit to justify its increased complication risks and costs over other modalities. Use of retrograde tibial/pedal access for treating IP CLI as a viable alternative to antegrade access and treatment from a totally retrograde approach has recently been described. Level I evidence to aid in clarifying the true efficacy for each of these endovascular modalities is greatly needed. As we await these data, we must remember that, as with any arterial intervention, proper patient selection is extremely important and the intervention, whether endovascular or open surgical repair, should be tailored to the individual patient's anatomy and disease characteristics.","Huang, Zhen S; Schneider, Darren B",Seminars in vascular surgery,287,11

In this regard, the designing and proper implementation of RL, in addition to increasing the level of customer satisfaction, reduces inventory and transportation costs. In this paper, in order to minimize the costs associated with fixed costs, material flow costs, and the costs of building potential centres, a complex integer linear programming model for an integrated direct logistics and RL network design is presented. Due to the outbreak of the ongoing global coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) at the beginning of 2020 and the consequent increase in medical waste, the need for an inverse logistics system to manage waste is strongly felt. Also, due to the worldwide vaccination in the near future, this waste will increase even more and careful management must be done in this regard. For this purpose, the proposed RL model in the field of COVID-19 waste management and especially vaccine waste has been designed. The network consists of three parts - factory, consumers' and recycling centres - each of which has different sub-parts. Finally, the proposed model is solved using the cuckoo optimization algorithm, which is one of the newest and most powerful meta-heuristic algorithms, and the computational results are presented along with its sensitivity analysis.","Shadkam, Elham","Waste management & research : the journal of the International Solid Wastes and Public Cleansing Association, ISWA",287,8

A major portion of the population has become susceptible to this strain. Scientists are pushing their limits to formulate a vaccine against Covid-19 with the least side effects. Although the recent discoveries of vaccines have shown some relief from the covid infection rate, however, physical fatigue, mental abnormalities, inflammation and other multiple organ damages are arising as post-Covid symptoms. The long-term effects of these symptoms are massive. Patients with such symptoms are known as long-haulers and treatment strategy against this condition is still unknown. In this study, we tried to explore a strategy to deal with the post-Covid symptoms. We targeted three human proteins namely ACE2, Interleukin-6, Transmembrane serine protease and NRP1 which are already reported to be damaged via Covid-19 proteins and upregulated in the post-Covid stage. Our target plant in this study is Cannabis (popularly known as 'Ganja' in India). The molecular docking and simulation studies revealed that Cannabidiol (CBD) and Cannabivarin (CVN) obtained from Cannabis can bind to post-Covid symptoms related central nervous system (CNS) proteins and downregulate them which can be beneficial in post-covid symptoms treatment strategy. Thus we propose Cannabis as an important therapeutic plant against post-Covid symptoms.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

Data sources covering the last decade on overdose deaths, drug treatment entrants and drug-related emergencies suggest that the health burden associated with opioid use is mostly related to the consumption of heroin - and to a lesser extent diverted opioid substitution treatment medications - and that it is primarily affecting an ageing cohort of vulnerable users, with little evidence of an increase in initiation. While opioid-related deaths are currently at much lower levels than in the US, they still represent a large preventable health burden with differences across EU countries. There is also increasing concern related to the high availability of heroin, illicitly produced synthetic opioids and diverted opioid pain medications on the European drugs market. Trends in the latter categories are poorly monitored and we may miss signs of emerging problems. Moreover, the economic recession following the COVID-19 pandemic has a potential to lead to resurgence in opioid use and harms.","Seyler, T; Giraudon, I; Noor, A; Mounteney, J; Griffiths, P",European journal of pain,287,12

This condition is caused by accumulation of large numbers of melanosomes (melanin granules) produced by melanocytes within neighboring keratinocytes. However, there is still no consensus regarding the melanosome transfer mechanism in senile lentigo. To date, most pathohistological studies of skin have been two-dimensional and do not provide detailed data on the complex interactions of the melanocyte-keratinocyte network involved in melanosome transfer. We performed a three-dimensional reconstruction of the epidermal microstructure in senile lentigo using three different microscopic modalities to visualize the topological melanocyte-keratinocyte relationship and melanosome distribution. Confocal laser microscopy images showed that melanocyte dendritic processes are more frequently branched and elongated in senile lentigo skin than in normal skin. Serial transmission electron micrographs showed that dendritic processes extend into intercellular spaces between keratinocytes. Focused ion beam-scanning electron micrographs showed that dendritic processes in senile lentigo encircle adjacent keratinocytes and accumulate large numbers of melanosomes. Moreover, melanosomes transferred to keratinocytes are present not only in the supranuclear area but throughout the perinuclear area except on the basal side. The use of these different microscopic methods helped to elucidate the three-dimensional morphology and topology of melanocytes and keratinocytes in senile lentigo. We show that the localization of melanosomes in dendritic processes to the region encircling recipient keratinocytes contributes to efficient melanosome transfer in senile lentigo.","Mizutani, Yuki; Yamashita, Mika; Hashimoto, Rie; Atsugi, Toru; Ryu, Akemi; Hayashi, Akinobu; Rikimaru-Nishi, Yukiko; Ohta, Keisuke",Microscopy,287,5

Recent findings that proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) directly modulate the expression of eotaxin-3, an eosinophil chemoattractant, in patients with eosinophilic diseases suggest therapeutic potential for PPIs in those with CRSwNP. OBJECTIVE We assessed the effect of type 2 mediators, particularly IL-13 and eotaxin-3, on tissue eosinophilia and disease severity in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS). Further investigation focused on PPI suppression of eotaxin-3 expression in vivo and in vitro, with exploration of underlying mechanisms. METHODS Type 2 mediator levels in nasal tissues and secretions were measured by using a multiplex immunoassay. Eotaxin-3 and other chemokines expressed in IL-13-stimulated human sinonasal epithelial cells (HNECs) and BEAS-2B cells with or without PPIs were assessed by using ELISA, Western blotting, real-time PCR, and intracellular pH imaging. RESULTS Nasal tissues and secretions from patients with CRSwNP had increased IL-13, eotaxin-2, and eotaxin-3 levels, and these were positively correlated with tissue eosinophil cationic protein levels and radiographic scores in patients with CRS (P < .05). IL-13 stimulation of HNECs and BEAS-2B cells dominantly induced eotaxin-3 expression, which was significantly inhibited by PPIs (P < .05). Patients with CRS taking PPIs also showed lower in vivo eotaxin-3 levels compared with those without PPIs (P < .05). Using intracellular pH imaging and altering extracellular K+, we found that IL-13 enhanced H+,K+-exchange, which was blocked by PPIs and the mechanistically unrelated H,K-ATPase inhibitor, SCH-28080. Furthermore, knockdown of ATP12A (gene for the nongastric H,K-ATPase) significantly attenuated IL-13-induced eotaxin-3 expression in HNECs. PPIs also had effects on accelerating IL-13-induced eotaxin-3 mRNA decay. CONCLUSION Our results demonstrated that PPIs reduce IL-13-induced eotaxin-3 expression by airway epithelial cells. Furthermore, mechanistic studies suggest that the nongastric H,K-ATPase is necessary for IL-13-mediated epithelial responses, and its inhibitors, including PPIs, might be of therapeutic value in patients with CRSwNP by reducing epithelial production of eotaxin-3.","Min, Jin-Young; Ocampo, Christopher J; Stevens, Whitney W; Price, Caroline P E; Thompson, Christopher F; Homma, Tetsuya; Huang, Julia H; Norton, James E; Suh, Lydia A; Pothoven, Kathryn L; Conley, David B; Welch, Kevin C; Shintani-Smith, Stephanie; Peters, Anju T; Grammer, Leslie C; Harris, Kathleen E; Hulse, Kathryn E; Kato, Atsushi; Modyanov, Nikolai N; Kern, Robert C; Schleimer, Robert P; Tan, Bruce K",The Journal of allergy and clinical immunology,287,13

RECENT FINDINGS Evidence to date does not suggest that people living with HIV (PLWH) have a markedly higher susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection, with disparities in the social determinants of health and comorbidities likely having a greater influence. The majority of literature has not supported a higher risk for severe disease among PLWH in Europe and the United States, although a large, population-based study in South Africa reported a higher rate of death due to COVID-19. Higher rates of comorbidities associated with COVID-19 disease severity among PLWH is an urgent concern. COVID-19 is leading to decreased access to HIV prevention services and HIV testing, and worsening HIV treatment access and virologic suppression, which could lead to worsening HIV epidemic control. CONCLUSION COVID-19 is threatening gains against the HIV epidemic, including the U.S. Ending the HIV Epidemic goals. The ongoing collision of these two global pandemics will continue to need both study and interventions to mitigate the effects of COVID-19 on HIV efforts worldwide.","Brown, Lillian B; Spinelli, Matthew A; Gandhi, Monica",Current opinion in HIV and AIDS,287,13

BACKGROUND Although bariatric procedures are associated with substantial weight loss, few studies have compared surgical outcomes to nonsurgical treatment, particularly for SG. METHODS In this retrospective, matched cohort study, adult patients with body mass index ≥35 kg/m who underwent RYGB or SG procedures from January 2005 through September 2015 were matched to 87,965 nonsurgical patients. Hierarchical linear models were used to investigate percent total weight loss (%TWL) and regain at 5 years among RYGB, SG, and nonsurgical patients, and at 10 years for RYGB and nonsurgical patients. RESULTS Among 13,900 SG, 17,258 RYGB, and 87,965 nonsurgical patients, the 5-year follow-up rate was 70.9%, 72.0%, and 64.5%, respectively. At 1 year, RYGB patients had 28.4%TWL (95% confidence interval: 28.2, 28.5), SG 23.0%TWL (22.8, 23.2), and nonsurgical patients 0.2%TWL (0.1, 0.4). At 5 years, RYGB had 21.7%TWL (21.5, 22.0), SG 16.0%TWL (15.4, 16.6), and nonsurgical patients 2.2%TWL (2.0, 2.5). After 5 years, 3.7% of RYGB and 10.1% of SG patients had regained weight to within 5% of baseline. At 10 years, RYGB patients had 20.2%TWL (19.3, 21.0) and nonsurgical patients 4.8%TWL (4.0, 5.5). CONCLUSIONS In this study, patients with severe obesity who underwent SG and RYGB lost significantly more weight at 5 years than nonsurgical patients. Weight regain was common after surgery but regain to within 5% of baseline was rare.","Arterburn, David E; Johnson, Eric; Coleman, Karen J; Herrinton, Lisa J; Courcoulas, Anita P; Fisher, David; Li, Robert A; Theis, Mary Kay; Liu, Liyan; Fraser, James R; Haneuse, Sebastien",Annals of surgery,287,24

This attracts attention to the possibilities of telemedicine again. In support of stopping the spread of the novel coronavirus infection, whilst keeping the healthcare system running and minimizing the risk of being infected, we also need to find new ways, methods, and platforms to deal with this pandemic. By providing a literature overview and sharing practical guidelines, including the special example of Hungarian teledentistry, we present both international and Hungarian initiatives to involve telemedicine on different levels of healthcare systems regarding COVID-19. Both international and national data show that telemedicine can play a major role in the triage process, early identification, diagnosis and treatment of infected individuals, and management of patient pathways in a way that ensures the medical team does not come into contact with potentially infected patients. It also plays an important role in remote monitoring of medical conditions and care of patients with chronic diseases and reconnects vulnerable groups of healthcare personnel to the care system. In addition to the potential benefits of telemedicine, we must not forget the limitations of this method. However, it is important to emphasize that due to its wide availability, telemedicine services can provide sufficient flexibility for both primary and specialist care (outpatient and inpatient clinical care). For that very reason, it is an urgent need to define the national professional guidelines, legal and financing possibilities in this field in a long-term sustainable way.* Orv Hetil. 2020; 161(24): 983-992. *Disclaimer: We closed the writing of this manuscript on the 30th of April, 2020.

STUDY DESIGN The study design was a prospective cadaveric experiment to examine the feasibility of a novel treatment for ET dysfunction. SETTING Academic medical center in a research-oriented operating room with intraoperative computed tomography (CT) capabilities. METHODS Seven fresh-frozen cadaver heads were obtained, each of which was thawed for 36 hours prior to use. The preprocedural volumes of the cartilaginous ET were measured by filling the ET with an iodine-containing radiocontrast agent via the nasopharynx and then obtaining CT images. Submucosal flaps in the soft palate were raised, and sutures were placed in the tensor veli palatini bilaterally to increase tension. After completion of the procedure, contrast placement and CT imaging were repeated. Three-dimensional models of the ETs were created, and the volumes were measured and compared. RESULTS Of the 14 ETs evaluated, 13 showed an increase in postprocedure volume. On average, postprocedure volumes showed a 57% increase from preprocedure volumes (mean relative change, 57.1%; P = .013). CONCLUSION Placement of a tension-holding suture in the tensor veli palatini muscle can reliably dilate the cartilaginous portion of the ET. Such a procedure may be useful in the treatment of ET dysfunction.","Eisen, Eric A; Wu, Xiaotian; Rees, Christiaan A; Pastel, David A; Paydarfar, Joseph A; Saunders, James E",Otolaryngology--head and neck surgery : official journal of American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery,287,17

Objectives To assess preparedness for surgical residency, to identify factors associated with preparedness, to examine the association between preparedness and burnout, and to explore resident and faculty perspectives on resident preparedness. Design, Setting, and Participants This cross-sectional study used convergent mixed-methods analysis of data from a survey of US general surgery residents delivered at the time of the 2017 American Board of Surgery In-Training Examination (January 26 to 31, 2017) in conjunction with qualitative interviews of residents and program directors conducted as part of the Flexibility in Duty Hour Requirements for Surgical Trainees (FIRST) trial. A total of 262 Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education-approved US general surgery residency programs participated. Survey data were collected from 3693 postgraduate year (PGY) 1 and PGY2 surgical residents (response rate, 99%) and 98 interviews were conducted with residents and faculty from September 1 to December 15, 2018. Data were analyzed from June 1, 2017, to February 15, 2018. Main Outcomes and Measures Hierarchical regression models were developed to examine factors associated with preparedness and to assess the association between preparedness and resident burnout. Qualitative interviews were conducted to identify themes associated with preparation for residency. Results Of the 3693 PGY1 and PGY2 residents who participated (2258 male [61.1%]), 1775 (48.1%) reported feeling unprepared for residency. Approximately half of surgery residents took overnight call infrequently (≤2 per month) during their core medical student clerkship (1904 [51.6%]) or their subinternship (1600 [43.3%]); 524 (14.2%) took no call during their core clerkship. In multivariable analysis, residents were more likely to report feeling unprepared for residency if they were female (odds ratio [OR], 1.34; 95% CI, 1.15-1.57) or did not take call as a medical student (OR for 0 vs >4 calls, 2.72; 95% CI, 2.10-3.52). Residents who did not complete a subinternship were less likely to report feeling prepared for residency (OR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.48-0.96). Feeling adequately prepared for residency was associated with a nearly 2-fold lower risk of experiencing burnout symptoms (OR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.48-0.68). In interviews, the dominant themes associated with preparedness included the following: (1) various regulations limit the medical school experience, (2) overnight call facilitates preparation and selection of a specialty compatible with their preferences, and (3) adequate perceptions of residency improve expectations, resulting in improved preparedness, lower burnout rates, and lower risk of attrition. Conclusions and Relevance In this cross-sectional study, the perception of feeling unprepared was associated with inadequate exposure to resident responsibilities while in medical school. These findings suggest that effective preparation of medical students for residency may result in lower rates of subsequent burnout.","Engelhardt, Kathryn E; Bilimoria, Karl Y; Johnson, Julie K; Hewitt, D Brock; Ellis, Ryan J; Hu, Yue Yung; Chung, Jeanette W; Kreutzer, Lindsey; Love, Remi; Blay, Eddie; Odell, David D",JAMA surgery,287,1

The aim of the study was to evaluate the effectiveness of standard practice in maintaining cuff pressure within the target range. METHODS This was a prospective observational study conducted in a tertiary-care intensive care unit, in which respiratory therapists (RTs) measured the cuff pressure 6 hourly by a handheld manometer. In this study, a research RT checked cuff pressure 2-4 h after the clinical RT measurement. Percentages of patients with cuff pressure levels above and below the target range were calculated. We identified predictors of low-cuff pressure. RESULTS We analyzed 2120 cuff-pressure measurements. The mean cuff pressure was 27 ± 2 cmH2O by the clinical RT and 21 ± 5 cmH2O by the research RT (p < 0.0001). The clinical RT documented that 98.0 % of cuff pressures were within the normal range. The research RT found the cuff pressures to be within the normal range in only 41.5 %, below the range in 53 % and above the range in 5.5 %. Low cuff pressure was found more common with lower ETT size (OR, 0.34 per 0.5 unit increase in ETT size; 95 % CI, 0.15-0.79) and with lower peak airway pressure (OR per one cm H2O increment, 0.93; 95 % CI, 0.87-0.99) on multivariate analysis. CONCLUSIONS Cuff pressure is frequently not maintained within the target range with low-cuff pressure being very common approximately 3 h after routine measurements. Low cuff pressure was associated with lower ETT size and lower peak airway pressure. There is a need to redesign the process for maintaining cuff pressure within the target range.","Alzahrani, Amer R; Al Abbasi, Shatha; Abahoussin, Othman Khalid; Al Shehri, Tariq Othman; Al-Dorzi, Hasan M; Tamim, Hani M; Sadat, Musharaf; Arabi, Yaseen M",BMC anesthesiology,287,20

However, previous studies were performed in a small number of patients and determined a single cutoff point to make clinical discrimination. The authors sought to test the predictive value of PPV in a large, multicenter study and to express it using a gray zone approach. METHODS The authors studied 413 patients during general anesthesia and mechanical ventilation in four centers. PPV, central venous pressure, and cardiac output were recorded before and after volume expansion (VE). Response to VE was defined as more than 15% increase in cardiac output after VE. The following approaches were used to determine the gray zones: resampled and two-graph receiver operator characteristic curves. The impact of changes in the benefit-risk balance of VE on the gray zone was also evaluated. RESULTS The authors observed 209 responders (51%) and 204 nonresponders (49%) to VE. The area under receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.89 (95% CI: 0.86-0.92) for PPV, compared with 0.57 (95% CI: 0.54-0.59) for central venous pressure (P < 10). The gray zone approach identified a range of PPV values (between 9% and 13%) for which fluid responsiveness could not be predicted reliably. These PPV values were seen in 98 (24%) patients. Changes in the cost ratio of VE moderately affected the gray zone limits. CONCLUSION Despite a strong predictive value, PPV may be inconclusive (between 9% and 13%) in approximately 25% of patients during general anesthesia.","Cannesson, Maxime; Le Manach, Yannick; Hofer, Christoph K; Goarin, Jean Pierre; Lehot, Jean-Jacques; Vallet, Benoît; Tavernier, Benoît",Anesthesiology,287,13

The ""JArDinS"" quasi-experimental study aimed to assess the impact of community garden participation on the adoption of more sustainable lifestyles among French adults. METHODS Individuals entering a community garden in Montpellier (France) in 2018 (n = 66) were compared with pairwise matched individuals with no experience in community gardening (n = 66). Nutritional quality, environmental impact and cost of monthly household food supplies, level of physical activity measured by accelerometers, as well as mental and social well-being, sensitivity to food waste, and connection with nature were evaluated at baseline (t0) and 12 months later (t1) to explore sustainability of lifestyles in social/health, environmental and economic dimensions. Linear mixed models were used to determine the independent effect of community gardening on investigated lifestyles components. In-depth interviews were conducted at t1 with 15 gardeners to better understand changes that may have occurred in gardeners' lives during the first year of gardening. RESULTS At t0, gardeners had lower education level, lower BMI and their household reported lower percentage of meals consumed outside of the home compared to non-gardeners (p < 0.05). Participating in the community garden had no significant impact, in spite of sufficient statistical power, on fruit and vegetables supplies (main outcome), nor on physical activity parameters, nor on others of the social/health, environmental and economic lifestyles components investigated. Qualitative interviews suggested the existence of pre-established health and environmental consciousness in some gardeners and revealed several barriers to the participation such as lack of time, lack of gardening knowledge, physical difficulty of gardening, health problems and conflicts with other gardeners. CONCLUSIONS The health benefits of community gardening previously reported by cross-sectional studies might be confounded by selection bias. The JArDinS study highlights the need to identify solutions to overcome barriers related to community garden participation when designing relevant public health interventions for the promotion of sustainable lifestyles.

Several screening tests for dysphagia have been developed and are used in clinical practice to prevent dysphagia complications. The Gugging Swallowing Screen is 1 such screening test. It is suggested for use in the assessment of the ability of patients to swallow fluid and non-fluid foods separately. It also promotes effective communication between healthcare providers. OBJECTIVES We aimed to investigate the validity and benefit of the Gugging Swallowing Screen. DESIGN This was a systematic review. DATA SOURCE We sourced data from electronic databases including Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, KoreaMed, Research Information Sharing Service, and Korean studies Information Service System. REVIEW METHODS We conducted a systematic review of electronic databases. We included studies published in English and Korean up to November 2018 that pertained to the Gugging Swallowing Screen. We designed strategies that included Medical Subject Headings and keywords, such as ""dysphagia,"" ""swallowing,"" ""assessment,"" ""screening,"" and ""GUSS,"" used alone or in combination. RESULTS Of the 297 studies that appeared in the search result, 219 articles were reviewed by 2 independent reviewers after duplicate studies were eliminated. Finally, 8 articles were included in this study. With regard to validity, the Gugging Swallowing Screen had a pooled sensitivity of 0.97 (95% confidence interval: 0.93-0.99), a pooled specificity of 0.67 (95% confidence interval: 0.59-0.74), and an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.9381. With regard to benefit, early systematic dysphagia screening using Gugging Swallowing Screen performed by nurses reduced both screening time and pneumonia rate compared to the control group (p = 0.004). The incidence of X-ray-verified pneumonia was significantly lower in the Gugging Swallowing Screen group than in the clinical screening group (p ˂ 0.01), but no significant difference was observed in the incidence of pneumonia compared to the value predicted using the 10 mL water swallowing test. CONCLUSIONS The Gugging Swallowing Screen is a reliable and sensitive tool for screening dysphagia. Early and systematic assessment can prevent aspiration and pneumonia. However, further studies are needed to confirm the effectiveness of this tool.","Park, Ki Deok; Kim, Tae Hee; Lee, Seon Heui",International journal of nursing studies,287,5

METHOD Children with community-acquired pneumonia were randomly assigned to receive 3-5 mg/kg propofol i.v. or 8% inhaled sevoflurane. Haemodynamic variables, stress hormone responses and serum cytokines were compared between the two groups. RESULTS Out of 50 children aged 2-12 years (propofol, n = 25; sevoflurane, n = 25), there were no significant between-group differences in haemodynamic variables and stress hormones. Interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-10 decreased significantly following FFB in both groups. IL-6 levels were significantly lower in the sevoflurane group than propofol group at 4 h and 1 d following FFB (61.3 ± 11.9 versus 82.6 ± 19.7 pg/ml; 52.8 ± 9.7 versus 75.4 ± 13.6 pg/ml, respectively). IL-10 levels in the sevoflurane group were significantly lower than in the propofol group at 1 d following FFB. CONCLUSIONS In children with community-acquired pneumonia, use of sevoflurane was associated with lower circulating IL-6 and IL-10 levels compared with propofol, following FFB. Pneumonia severity is reflected by higher blood cytokine levels, thus, sevoflurane may be more beneficial to recovery from community-acquired pneumonia than propofol, however further studies are required to test this hypothesis.","Chen, Lin; Cheng, Jing; Wang, Yan-Lin",The Journal of international medical research,287,16

This perspective discusses the burden, challenges and potential opportunities for improvement of CVD prevention and control efforts in SSA. AREAS COVERED This paper focuses on ischaemic heart disease and stroke, and their key contributors of obesity, hypertension, diabetes and dyslipidaemia which are well-established, rapidly rising and significant contributors to disease burden in SSA. However, their prevention, detection, treatment and control of are currently disorganised, inconsistent, unreliable and insufficient with most SSA countries not geared to respond to this growing problem. National policies are frequently lacking or, if available, remain poorly implemented, for the control of these conditions. Primary healthcare systems have not adapted to cope with these rising CVD burdens and remain weak, underfunded and under resourced. Numerous barriers at the healthcare service, healthcare provider and patient levels prevent optimal CVD risk factor care. EXPERT OPINION Innovative approaches such as task-shifting with the reallocation of care to lower-level healthcare workers and the potential use of inexpensive technological options should be encouraged to provide equitable CVD preventive and curative solutions to SSA's poor.","Peer, Nasheeta; Baatiema, Leonard; Kengne, Andre-Pascal",Expert review of cardiovascular therapy,287,1

The recent development of AAV-PHP.eB, highly BBB-permeable capsid variant of AAV serotype 9, has opened up systemic application for whole brain transduction. To attain high transduction efficacy, much efforts have been paid to purify AAV vectors using gradient centrifugation or column chromatography. These methods are time-consuming, cost substantially and require expensive equipment. NEW METHOD We propose a simple purification method for the production of systemically applicable AAV-PHP.eB targeting the brain. The new method, which we named minimal purification (MP) method, requires only 2 steps: removal of cell debris using a syringe filter and concentration using a disposable ultrafiltration device. RESULTS The MP method yielded 2 times more AAV-PHP.eB than the standard ultracentrifuge purification (UCP) method. Intravenous injection of AAV-PHP.eB prepared using the MP method caused robust whole brain transduction without overt toxicity on the liver and kidney. Moreover, we found almost no difference in cellular density and morphology of brain microglia between control mice and mice treated systemically with the MP viral solution, suggesting no influence of the viral injection on brain immunity. COMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHODS The new method, which requires only a benchtop centrifuge and takes only 2 - 4 h to obtain a ready-to-use viral solution, is much less expensive than the existing UCP method, and can avoid cumbersome and time-consuming purification processes. CONCLUSIONS This simplified method further expands the use of AAV vectors in the neuroscience community.","Konno, Ayumu; Hirai, Hirokazu",Journal of neuroscience methods,287,11

OBJECTIVES To evaluate the effect of the COVID-19 response on biochemical test requests received from outpatient departments (OPDs) and peripheral clinics serviced by the National Health Laboratory Service Chemical Pathology Laboratory at Tygerberg Hospital, Cape Town, South Africa (SA). Request volumes were used as a measure of the routine care of patients, as clinical information was not readily available. METHODS A retrospective audit was conducted. The numbers of requests received from OPDs and peripheral clinics for creatinine, glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c), lipid profiles, thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), free thyroxine, free tri-iodothyronine (fT3), serum and urine protein electrophoresis, serum free light chains and neonatal total serum bilirubin were obtained from 1 March to 30 June for 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020. RESULTS The biggest impact was seen on lipids, creatinine, HbA1c, TSH and fT3. The percentage reduction between 1 March and 30 June 2019 and between 1 March and 30 June 2020 was 59% for lipids, 64% for creatinine and HbA1c, 80% for TSH and 81% for fT3. There was a noteworthy decrease in overall analyte testing from March to April 2020, coinciding with initiation of level 5 lockdown. Although an increase in testing was observed during June 2020, the number of requests was still lower than in June 2019.

The TLR4 is the prototypical sensor of infection or injury that orchestrates the innate response via sequential activation of both cell surface and endocytic signaling pathways that trigger distinct downstream consequences. CD14 binds and delivers LPS to TLR4 and has been identified as a positive regulator of TLR4 signal transduction. It is logical that negative regulators of this process also exist to maintain the critical balance required for fighting infection, healing damaged tissue, and resolving inflammation. We showed that CD13 negatively modulates receptor-mediated Ag uptake in dendritic cells to control T cell activation in adaptive immunity. In this study, we report that myeloid CD13 governs internalization of TLR4 and subsequent innate signaling cascades, activating IRF-3 independently of CD14. CD13 is cointernalized with TLR4, CD14, and dynamin into Rab5(+) early endosomes upon LPS treatment. Importantly, in response to TLR4 ligands HMGB1 and LPS, p-IRF-3 activation and transcription of its target genes are enhanced in CD13(KO) dendritic cells, whereas TLR4 surface signaling remains unaffected, resulting in a skewed inflammatory response. This finding is physiologically relevant as ischemic injury in vivo provoked identical TLR4 responses. Finally, CD13(KO) mice showed significantly enhanced IFNβ-mediated signal transduction via JAK-STAT, escalating inducible NO synthase transcription levels and promoting accumulation of oxidative stress mediators and tissue injury. Mechanistically, inflammatory activation of macrophages upregulates CD13 expression and CD13 and TLR4 coimmunoprecipitate. Therefore, CD13 negatively regulates TLR4 signaling, thereby balancing the innate response by maintaining the inflammatory equilibrium critical to innate immune regulation.","Ghosh, Mallika; Subramani, Jaganathan; Rahman, M Mamunur; Shapiro, Linda H",Journal of immunology,287,1

We agree with Bernard Lo and Doug White that equity implications of triage frameworks should be continually reassessed, which is why we offered six concrete options for improvement, and called for monitoring the consequences of adopted triage models. We disagree with their assessment that we mis-characterised their Model Guidance, as included in the NJ Directive, in ways that undermine our conclusions. They suggest we erroneously described their model as a two-criterion allocation framework; that recognising other operant criterion reveals it 'likely mitigate[s] rather than exacerbate[s] racial disparities during triage', and allege that concerns about inequitable outcomes are 'without evidence'. We highlight two major studies robustly demonstrating why concerns about disparate outcomes are justified. We also show that White and Lo seek to retrospectively-and counterfactually-correct the version of the Model Guideline included in the NJ Directive. However, as our facsimile reproductions show, neither the alleged four-criteria form, nor other key changes, such as dropping the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score, are found in the Directive. These points matter because (1) our conclusions hence stand, (2) because the public version of the Model Guidance had not been updated to reduce the risk of inequitable outcomes until June 2021 and (3) NJ's Directive still does not reflect these revisions, and, hence, represents a less equitable version, as acknowledged by its authors.

METHODS AND MATERIALS We retrospectively reviewed 194 STEMI consecutive patients who underwent primary PCI to evaluate the predictors for CI-AKI and 187 survivors to examine all-cause mortality and cardiovascular events. Outcomes were compared between patients with CI-AKI and those without CI-AKI, which was defined as an increase >50% or >0.5mg/dl in serum creatinine concentration within 48hours after primary PCI. RESULTS CI-AKI occurred in 23 patients (11.9%). Multivariate analysis identified pre-procedural renal insufficiency as a predictor of CI-AKI, and this predictor was independent from hemodynamic instability and excessive contrast volume. Receiver-operator characteristics analysis demonstrated that patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of ≤43.6ml/min per 1.73m(2) had the potential for CI-AKI. Patients who developed CI-AKI had higher mortality and cardiovascular events than did those without CI-AKI (27.8% vs. 4.7%; log-rank P=.0003, 27.8% vs. 11.2%; log-rank P=.0181, respectively). Cox proportional hazards model analysis identified CI-AKI as the independent predictor of mortality and cardiovascular events [hazard ratio [HR]=5.36; P=.0076, HR=3.10; P=.0250, respectively].

Although majority of COVID-19 patients present with respiratory symptoms, gastrointestinal symptoms are also seen. COVID-19 has also disrupted gastrointestinal endoscopy services in numerous ways. There are also concerns regarding the impact of these changes on gastrointestinal cancer screening and management of chronic gastrointestinal diseases. The purpose of this review is to provide an overview of the implications of COVID-19 for the practicing gastroenterologist. RECENT FINDINGS COVID-19 patients can have gastrointestinal symptoms including diarrhea, nausea and vomiting, abdominal pain and anorexia. Separate from the management of COVID-19 patients, there has been a reduction in endoscopy volume worldwide. This has also resulted in reduction/cessation of in-person clinic visits and an increasing use of telemedicine services. In addition, patients with certain chronic diseases like chronic liver disease or inflammatory bowel disease may have worse outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic. SUMMARY Gastroenterologists need to rapidly adapt to the challenges being faced and need to make both systems and practice-based changes to the endoscopy unit and outpatient clinic practices. Gastroenterologists should stay up-to-date with the rapidly evolving literature regarding gastrointestinal symptoms in COVID-19 patients as well as its impact on chronic gastrointestinal illnesses.","Bilal, Mohammad; Sawhney, Mandeep S; Feuerstein, Joseph D",Current opinion in gastroenterology,287,1

Previously, coexpression of two putative transmembrane nonstructural proteins (nsp2 and nsp3) was found to suffice to induce these remarkable membrane structures, which are typical of arterivirus infection. Here, site-directed mutagenesis was used to investigate the role of nsp3 in more detail. Liberation of the hydrophobic N terminus of nsp3, which is normally achieved by cleavage of the nsp2/3 junction by the nsp2 protease, was nonessential for the formation of DMVs. However, the substitution of each of a cluster of four conserved cysteine residues, residing in a predicted luminal loop of nsp3, completely blocked DMV formation. Some of these mutant nsp3 proteins were also found to be highly cytotoxic, in particular, exerting a dramatic effect on the endoplasmic reticulum. The functionality of an engineered N glycosylation site in the cysteine-containing loop confirmed both its presence in the lumen and the transmembrane nature of nsp3. This mutant displayed an interesting intermediate phenotype in terms of DMV formation, with paired and curved membranes being formed, but DMV formation apparently being impaired. The effect of nsp3 mutations on replicase polyprotein processing was investigated, and several mutations were found to influence processing of the region downstream of nsp3 by the nsp4 main protease. When tested in an EAV reverse genetics system, none of the nsp3 mutations was tolerated, again underlining the crucial role of the protein in the arterivirus life cycle.","Posthuma, Clara C; Pedersen, Ketil W; Lu, Zhengchun; Joosten, Ruth G; Roos, Norbert; Zevenhoven-Dobbe, Jessika C; Snijder, Eric J",Journal of virology,287,1

The neonatal mortality rate from COVID-19 was 10%. Seven newborns (37%) were discharged from the hospital as healthy but required readmission for symptoms of COVID-19. There were 2 multifetal gestations - one set each of twins and triplets, each with disparate testing and clinical outcomes. Premature delivery was common, occurring in 12 of 19 infants (63%). Initial testing for COVID-19 was negative in 4 of the 19 neonates (21%) who subsequently became positive. In 2 cases, neonates tested positive at 1 and 2 h after birth which was suspicious for vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2. CONCLUSIONS These cases have notable variation in the epidemiology, clinical features, results of testing and clinical outcomes among the infected newborns. Neonates initially testing negative for COVID-19 may require readmission due to infection. Two neonates were highly suspicious for intrauterine vertical transmission. Repeat testing of neonates who initially test negative for COVID-19 is recommended, without which 21% of neonatal infections would have been undiagnosed.","Schwartz, David A; Mohagheghi, Parisa; Beigi, Babak; Zafaranloo, Nazanin; Moshfegh, Fereshteh; Yazdani, Anita","The journal of maternal-fetal & neonatal medicine : the official journal of the European Association of Perinatal Medicine, the Federation of Asia and Oceania Perinatal Societies, the International Society of Perinatal Obstetricians",287,30

METHODS Eighty-three patients with STGD1 were screened for CBS. They underwent a full eye examination. All patients completed the social functioning domain of the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey questionnaire. Participants suspected of CBS were interviewed to further evaluate their visual hallucinations. RESULTS CBS prevalence was 8.4%. Six out of seven patients with CBS were women. CBS was not associated with age (p=0.279, Mann-Whitney). Patients with CBS had a significant lower social functioning score (p<0.05, Mann-Whitney). All seven patients with CBS were in the category of vision impairment (visual acuity <6/12, but ≥3/60). Moreover, first hallucinations manifested after a drop in visual acuity. The retinal atrophic area of the worst eye tended to be lower in the CBS group (range 0.11-9.86 mm2) as compared with controls (range 0-180 mm2). There was no relation between the position of the scotoma and the location of the visual hallucinations. CONCLUSION The relative high CBS prevalence in STGD1 suggests that CBS may be more prevalent in younger ophthalmic patients than currently presumed. In this specific group of patients, we established social isolation and acquired vision impairment as risk factors for CBS. There was a female preponderance among patients with CBS. Age and retinal pigment epithelium atrophy were not identified as significant risk factors. We should actively diagnose CBS in patients of any age who fulfil the criteria for the category vision impairment, especially in cases where social isolation is suspected.","Dhooge, Patty P A; Teunisse, Rob J; Liefers, Bart; Lambertus, Stanley; Bax, Nathalie M; Hoyng, Carel B; Cruysberg, Johannes R M; Klevering, B Jeroen",The British journal of ophthalmology,287,8

However, there is currently no consensus on the potential survival benefit of SpTR in GBM compared to gross total resection (GTR). In this study, we compare the impact of SpTR versus GTR on overall survival (OS) of GBM patients. METHODS We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of literature published on PubMed, Embase, The Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Scopus, and ClinicalTrials.gov, from inception to August 16, 2018, to identify articles comparing OS after SpTR versus GTR. RESULTS We identified 8902 unique citations, of which 11 articles met study inclusion criteria. 810 patients underwent SpTR out of a total of 2056 patients. 9 of 11 studies demonstrated improved outcomes with SpTR compared to GTR (median improvement in OS of 10.5 months), with no significant difference in postoperative complication rate. Overall study quality was variable, with ten studies presenting level IV evidence and one study presenting level IIIb evidence. Subgroup meta-analysis based on SpTR definition demonstrated a statistically significant 35% lower risk of mortality in patients who underwent anatomical SpTR compared to patients who underwent GTR (Hazard ratio = 0.65, 95% CI 0.47- 0.91, p = 0.003). CONCLUSION Our systematic review indicates SpTR may be associated with improved OS compared to GTR for GBM, especially with anatomical SpTR. However, this is limited by variable study design and significant clinical and methodological heterogeneity among studies. There is need for prospective clinical data to further guide parameters regarding the use of SpTR in GBM.","Jackson, Christina; Choi, John; Khalafallah, Adham M; Price, Carrie; Bettegowda, Chetan; Lim, Michael; Gallia, Gary; Weingart, Jon; Brem, Henry; Mukherjee, Debraj",Journal of neuro-oncology,287,28

Anecdotal reports suggest that endurance trained (ET) athletes with a high maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max) may be at increased risk for AMS. Possible underlying mechanisms include a training-induced increase in resting parasympathetic activity, higher resting metabolic rate (RMR), and lower hypoxic ventilatory response (HVR). METHODS In 38 healthy, non-acclimatized men (19 ET and 19 untrained controls (UT), VO2max 66±6 vs. 45±7 mL/min/kg; p<0.001) peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2), heart rate variability, RMR, and poikilocapnic HVR were assessed at 424m and during 48 hours at 3450m following passive ascent by train (~2 hours). AMS was evaluated by AMS-C score. RESULTS On day 1 at altitude, ET presented with a higher AMS incidence (42% vs. 11%; p<0.05) and severity (AMS-C score: ET: 0.48±0.5 vs UT: 0.21±0.2; p=0.03), but no group difference was found on day 2 and 3. SpO2 decreased upon arrival at altitude (ET: 82±6% vs. UT: 83±4%; ptime<0.001) with a significantly different time course between ET and UT (ptime*group=0.045). Parasympathetic activity decreased at altitude (p<0.001) but was always higher in ET (p<0.05). At altitude RMR increased (p<0.001) and was higher in ET (p<0.001). HVR increased only in ET (p<0.05) and was greater than in UT after 24 and 48 hours (p<0.05). CONCLUSION ET are at higher risk for developing AMS on the first day following passive and rapid ascent to 3450m, possibly due to an increased parasympathetic activity and an increased RMR, while HVR appeared to be of minor importance. Differences in AMS time course and physiological responses should be taken into consideration when ET are planning high-altitude sojourns.","Sareban, Mahdi; Schiefer, Lisa M; Macholz, Franziska; Schäfer, Larissa; Zangl, Quirin; Inama, Franciscus; Reich, Bernhard; Mayr, Barbara; Schmidt, Peter; Hartl, Arnulf; Bärtsch, Peter; Niebauer, Josef; Treff, Gunnar; Berger, Marc M",Medicine and science in sports and exercise,287,1

COVID-19 is a disease characterized by a range of clinical syndromes including variable degrees of respiratory symptoms from mild respiratory illness and severe interstitial pneumonia to acute respiratory distress syndrome, septic shock, coagulopathies, and multiorgan dysfunction. This virus carries the potential to manifest in a wide range of pulmonary findings and hypoxemias, from mild respiratory symptoms to more severe syndromes, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome. The rapid accumulation of evidence and persistent gaps in knowledge related to the virus presents a host of challenges for clinicians. This creates a complex environment for clinical decision-making. OBJECTIVE To examine oxygenation strategies in critically ill patients with hypoxia who are hospitalized with COVID-19. DISCUSSION These proposed strategies may help to improve the respiratory status and oxygenation of those affected by COVID-19. However, additional high-quality research is needed to provide further evidence for improved respiratory management strategies. Areas of future research should focus on improving understanding of the inflammatory and clotting processes associated with the virus, particularly in the lungs. High-level evidence and randomized controlled trials should target the most effective strategies for improving oxygenation, time requiring mechanical ventilation, and survival for hospitalized patients with COVID-19 presenting with hypoxemia.","Evers, Julianne M; Pehlke, Sarah J; Jones, Lauren L; Urquhart, Michelle G",Dimensions of critical care nursing : DCCN,287,31

Family functioning, coping strategies, and posttraumatic growth of family caregivers of PwD were measured. Data were processed using descriptive statistics, correlation analysis, regression analysis, and structural equation modelling.Results: Posttraumatic growth was observed in family caregivers of PwD. The caregiver's gender, relationship with the patient, and difficulty balancing financial income and expenditures in the past month, as well as disease severity of PwD, are significant predictors of posttraumatic growth. There were significantly positive correlations among posttraumatic growth, family functioning and positive coping strategies (P＜0.01). Positive coping strategies exert a complete mediating effect between family functioning and posttraumatic growth (β = 0.49, P < 0.05).Conclusions: A model of the posttraumatic growth of family caregivers of PwD can be established, and the relevant mechanisms can be explored.

To overcome this resistance, 4-anilinoquinazoline-based irreversible inhibitors afatinib, dacomitinib has been developed. However, the clinical application of these irreversible inhibitors is limited due to its narrow selectivity against L858R/T790M mutant EGFR. In an attempt to develop potent and selective EGFR T790M inhibitors, we have designed and synthesized two series of novel acrylamide linked quinazolines. Among them, compounds 2i (IC50 0.171 µM) and 11h (IC50 0.159 µM) were identified as potent compounds, which displayed selective and potent anti-proliferative activity on gefitinib-resistant cell line NCI-H1975 as compared to the gefitinib and WZ4002 in cellular assay. Furthermore, a molecular dynamic simulation of 11h was carried out to assess the stability to form a complex with the L858R/T790M EGFR Kinase domain, which demonstrated that complex was stable for the 100 ns and form strong crucial covalent binding contacts with the thiol group of Cys797 residue. Finally, satisfactory in silico pharmacokinetics properties of 2i, 11h and 11i compounds were predicted. The synthesized compounds were also evaluated for in vitro cytotoxic activity/hepatotoxicity against HepG2 cell line through MTT assay. The results revealed that compounds exhibited lower cytotoxicity to HepG2 cells.","Pawara, Rahul; Ahmad, Iqrar; Nayak, Deepika; Wagh, Shivani; Wadkar, Avinash; Ansari, Azim; Belamkar, Sateesh; Surana, Sanjay; Nath Kundu, Chanakya; Patil, Chandragauda; Patel, Harun",Bioorganic chemistry,287,33

The early identification of who will progress on AA/P is limited. OBJECTIVE This study investigates the role of prostate surface antigen (PSA) kinetics as a predictor of progression in mHSPC patients treated with AA/P. PATIENTS AND METHODS All patients with mHSPC who initiated androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) and AA/P from June 2017 to February 2019 at the Cleveland Clinic were eligible. PSA-mCRPC was defined as a PSA rise at two consecutive time points. Patients were followed until first mCRPC or last contact after AA/P. Patterns of PSA change were evaluated using a longitudinal mixed model at time 0, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months from AA/P initiation. The association between PSA profile at 3 months and PSA-mCRPC was examined using survival analysis. Radiographic progression (Rad-mCRPC) was also analyzed. RESULTS A total of 130 men with follow-up were included. The median (interquartile range [IQR]) follow-up time was 15.3 (10.5, 22.5) months. Eighty-two percent were Caucasian (median age 68.5 years); participants had a median (IQR) PSA of 16.8 (5.3, 48.0) ng/mL. Half of the patients had de novo disease, and 46.2% had high-risk disease (61% had a Gleason score ≥ 8, 16% had visceral disease, and 54% had three or more bony lesions). The greatest PSA percentage reduction from baseline after AA/P initiation occurred at the first 3 months (median 98.3%). The reduction at 6-12 months from baseline was small (99.7-100%). Patients without PSA-mCRPC had a significantly greater 3-month reduction of PSA values compared to patients who developed PSA-mCRPC (p interaction = 0.0002). 50.8% of patients were able to achieve a non-detectable PSA (median 13.1 months). PSA-mCRPC (n = 20) was observed from 4 to 24 months after AA/P, with the majority of events occurring within the first 12 months. Patients with PSA < 0.3 ng/mL (12-month PSA-mCRPC-free 94.5% vs. 69.4%, p = 0.0004) or a ≥ 98% reduction (94.9% vs. 68.0%, p = 0.0002) at 3 months had better PSA-mCRPC-free survival compared to their counterparts. Absolute reduction at 3 months was not associated with PSA-mCRPC. Similar PSA patterns were seen in those who had Rad-mCRPC compared to no Rad-mCRPC (p interaction < 0.05). CONCLUSION The degree of PSA decline at 3 months predicted serologic progression to mCRPC. Those who developed castration-resistant disease had higher PSA and a lower percentage reduction by 3 months. Tracking early PSA pattern changes may alert clinicians to poor treatment effect and potential progression; they should consider frequent PSA measurement and imaging, as well as the initiation of sequential therapy.","Sheng, Iris Y; Fallah, Jaleh; Gupta, Ruby; Li, Hong; Allman, Kimberly; Martin, Allison; Barata, Pedro; Ornstein, Moshe C; Gilligan, Timothy D; Rini, Brian I; Garcia, Jorge A",Targeted oncology,287,26

Family-centered care and its delivery rapidly changed and left the family behind-unable to actively participate in their loved one's care. LOCAL PROBLEM A southeastern academic medical center pediatric cardiac intensive care unit (PCICU) needed to augment family-centered medical rounds when parents could not be at the bedside. No alternative to physical presence for daily medical rounds existed in the PCICU. METHODS A virtual rounding (VR) program was implemented allowing parents of patients admitted to PCICU to join medical rounds remotely through teleconferencing. Preintervention and postintervention rounding times, staff perceptions of the program, and parental satisfaction scores using the Pediatric Family Satisfaction in the Intensive Care Unit (pFS-ICU) tool were measured. INTERVENTIONS This quality improvement project implemented a VR program offered to all families of patients in the PCICU. RESULTS VR did not increase rounding times after implementation (p = .673). Staff satisfaction surveys revealed that staff felt the VR program did not prolong rounding times (p ≤ 0.001), workload impact perceptions improved after intervention (p = <0.001), and staff felt VR should be offered to families in PCICU (p ≤ 0.001). Only nine pFS-ICU surveys were completed giving the family a limited voice in the evaluation of this project. CONCLUSIONS This project demonstrates that VR can be successfully implemented for family engagement without increased burden on staff.","Tallent, Sarah; Turi, Jennifer L; Thompson, Julie; Allareddy, Veerajalandhar; Hueckel, Rémi",Journal of the American Association of Nurse Practitioners,287,16

METHODS This retrospective claims analysis included 6680 Medicare beneficiaries over age 66 with ovarian cancer who survived at least one year after diagnosis, had at least 4 outpatient evaluation and management visits and died between 2000 and 2016. We calculated the Bice-Boxerman Continuity of Care Index (COC) for each woman, and split COC into tertiles (high, medium, low). We compared late or no hospice use, >1 emergency department (ED) visit, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, >1 hospitalization, terminal hospitalization, chemotherapy, and invasive and/or life extending procedures among women with high or medium vs. low COC using multivariable adjusted logistic regression. RESULTS In this sample, 49.8% of women received aggressive care in the last month of life. Compared to women with low COC, women with high COC had 66% higher odds of chemotherapy (adjusted OR 1.66 CI 1.23-2.24) in the last two weeks of life. Women with high COC also had 16% greater odds of not enrolling in hospice compared to women with low COC (adjusted OR 1.16 CI 1.01-1.33). COC was not associated with late enrollment in hospice, hospital utilization, or aggressive procedures. CONCLUSIONS COC at the end of life is complicated and may pose unique challenges in providing quality end of life care. Future work exploring the specific facets of continuity associated with quality end of life care is needed.","Mullins, Megan A; Ruterbusch, Julie J; Clarke, Philippa; Uppal, Shitanshu; Cote, Michele L; Wallner, Lauren P",Gynecologic oncology,287,16

Recently, single-incision laparoscopic surgery to reduce the invasiveness of traditional laparoscopy further is under development. This study aimed to assess the safety and feasibility of the single-port approach for laparoscopic totally extraperitoneal (TEP) repair of inguinal hernia and to report the authors' initial experience using the TriPort system. METHODS Between 18 October 2008 and 1 April 2009, 19 single-incision laparoscopic TEP repairs of inguinal hernia were performed for 16 patients at the Royal Surrey County Hospital, Guildford, United Kingdom. Data regarding patient demographics, type of hernia, operating time, complications, postoperative hospital stay, and recurrence were prospectively collected. The length of the incision at the time of the operation and at a clinic follow-up visit also was measured. RESULTS All 16 patients were men, ranging in age from 21 to 87 years. Of the 16 men, 13 had a unilateral inguinal hernia. For 7 of the 13 men, the hernia was on the left side. The median operating time was 40 min for unilateral hernia and 70 min for bilateral hernia. There were no intraoperative complications and no deaths. Discharge was on the same day for 12 of the men, and within 24 h for the remaining 4 men. Minor wound complications developed for two men. One man reported transient pain in his testicle. There was no evidence of early recurrence during a median follow-up period of 72.5 days. The median incision length was 30 mm, and the median scar length at the clinic follow-up visit was 25 mm. CONCLUSION The authors' experience has shown that single-port laparoscopic TEP inguinal hernia repair with the TriPort system is safe and feasible. Prospective randomized studies comparing single-access and conventional multiport laparoscopic TEP repairs with long-term follow-up evaluation are needed to confirm the authors' initial experience.","Agrawal, S; Shaw, A; Soon, Y",Surgical endoscopy,287,1

Although some studies suggest that rectal surgery differs from colon surgery for SSI incidence and risk factors, the National Nosocomial Infection Surveillance system categorizes all colorectal surgeries into only one group. The aim of this study was to determine incidence, characteristics, and risk factors of SSIs according to the subclassification of colorectal surgery into right colon surgery (RCS), left colon surgery (LCS), and rectum surgery (RS). METHODS From November 2005 to July 2009, all patients requiring colorectal resectioning were enrolled into our program. The outcome of interest was an SSI diagnosis. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to determine SSI predictors in each group. RESULTS Two hundred seventy-seven consecutive colorectal resections were analyzed. SSI rates were 8% in RCS, 18.4% in LCS, and 17.6% in RS. LCS and RS showed significantly higher SSI incidences (p = 0.022) and greater rates of organ/space infections compared to RCS (p = 0.029). Predictors of SSI were steroid use among RCS, age greater than 70 years, multiple comorbidities, steroid use, non-neoplastic colonic disease, urgent operation, ostomy creation, postoperative intensive care among LCS, preoperative chemoradiation, heart disease, and prolonged operation among RS patients. On multivariate analysis, the coupled LCS and RS groups showed an increased risk for SSI compared to RCS (OR, 2.57). CONCLUSIONS SSI incidences, characteristics, and risk factors seem to be different among RCS, LCS, and RS. A tailored SSI surveillance program should be applied for each of the three groups, leading to a more competent SSI recognition and reduction of SSI incidence and related costs.","Degrate, Luca; Garancini, Mattia; Misani, Marta; Poli, Silvia; Nobili, Cinzia; Romano, Fabrizio; Giordano, Laura; Motta, Vittorio; Uggeri, Franco",International journal of colorectal disease,287,1

Since several lysine residues in this protein are critical for PS binding, we engineered a new protein, C2AcH, to include the C-terminal sequence CKLAAALEHHHHHH, incorporating a free cysteine (for site-specific covalent modification) and a hexahistidine tag (for site-specific radiolabeling with [99mTc(CO)3(OH2)3]+). We also engineered a second derivative, C2Ac, in which the C-terminal sequence included only the C-terminal cysteine. These proteins were characterized by electrospray mass spectrometry, SDS/PAGE, and size exclusion chromatography and radiolabeled with [99mTc(CO)3(OH2)3]+. Conjugates of the proteins with the rhenium analogue [Re(CO)3(OH2)3]+ were also synthesized. Site-specific labeling was confirmed by performing a tryptic digest of rhenium tricarbonyl-labeled C2AcH, and only peptides containing the His-tag contained the [Re(CO)3]+. The labeled proteins were tested for binding to red blood cells (RBC) with exposed PS in a calcium dependent manner. Labeling 100 microg of C2AcH with [99mTc(CO)3(OH2)3]+ at 37 degrees C for 30 min gave a radiochemical yield of > 96%. However, C2AcH that had first been conjugated with fluorescein maleimide or iodoacetamide via the Cys residue gave only 50% and 83% radiochemical yield, respectively, after incubation for 30 min at 37 degrees C. Serum stability results indicated that >95% of radiolabeled C2AcH remained stable for at least 18 h at 37 degrees C. Site-specifically labeled C2AcH exhibited calcium-dependent binding to the PS on the RBC, whereas a nonspecifically modified derivative, C2AcH-B, in which lysines had been modified with benzyloxycarbonyloxy, did not. We conclude that (i) the combination of Cys and a His-tag greatly enhances the rate and efficiency of labeling with [99mTc(CO)3(OH2)3]+ compared to either the His-tag or the Cys alone, and this sequence deserves further evaluation as a radiolabeling tag; (ii) non-site-specific modification of C2A via lysine residues impairs target binding affinity; (iii) 99mTc-C2AcH has excellent radiolabeling, stability and PS binding characteristics and warrants in vivo evaluation as a cell-death imaging agent.","Tavaré, Richard; Torres Martin De Rosales, Rafael; Blower, Philip J; Mullen, Gregory E D",Bioconjugate chemistry,287,1

INITIAL WORK Implementation of telehealth began in 2017. Health system barriers, provider and patient reluctance, and inadequate reimbursement prevented widespread adoption at the time. COVID-19 served as the catalyst to accelerate telehealth efforts. IMPLEMENTATION COVID-19 resulted in the need for patient care with ""social distancing."" In addition, due to the pandemic, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and other insurers began expanded reimbursement for telehealth. More than 2000 providers received virtual health training in less than 2 weeks. In March 2020, we provided 2376 virtual visits, and in April 5293, which was more than 75 times the number provided in February; 73% of all visits in April were virtual (up from 0.5% in October 2019). As COVID-19 cases receded in May, June, and July, patient demand for virtual visits decreased, but 28% of visits in July were still virtual. LESSONS LEARNED Several key lessons are important for future efforts regarding clinical implementation: (1) prepare for innovation, (2) cultivate an innovation mindset, (3) standardize (but not too much), (4) technological innovation is necessary but not sufficient, and (5) communicate widely and often.","Knierim, Kyle; Palmer, Christina; Kramer, Erik Seth; Rodriguez, Rachel S; VanWyk, Jill; Shmerling, Alison; Smith, Peter; Holmstrom, Heather; Bacak, Brian S; Brown Levey, Shandra M; Staton, Elizabeth W; Holtrop, Jodi Summers",Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine : JABFM,287,1

The aim of this study was to validate a simple clinical test, the Volume-Viscosity Swallow Test (V-VST), to detect oropharyngeal dysphagia in this population. PATIENTS AND METHODS Twenty patients were included in this study (mean age: 66.1 ± 8.13, six women). All patients had their swallowing function assessed by videofluoroscopy and V-VST. RESULTS Among these 20 patients, 15 presented oropharyngeal dysphagia, diagnosed by videofluoroscopy, and five had normal swallowing. Norris score was lower in patients with oropharyngeal dysphagia compared to the patients with normal swallowing (27 ± 6 versus 36 ± 2; P=0.003). Among the 15 patients with oropharyngeal dysphagia, 14 had abnormal V-VST, and only one had normal V-VST. The sensibility of V-VST to detect oropharyngeal dysphagia in these patients with ALS was of 93%, and the specificity was of 80% (P=0.007). There was no significant difference between the two populations for ALSFRS score (22 ± 6 versus 20 ± 6) and body mass index (BMI) (26 ± 6 versus 26 ± 6 kg/m(2)). CONCLUSION The V-VST presented good sensibility and specificity. It may be interesting to use it systematically for the detection of oropharyngeal dysphagia in ALS, after confirming these results on a wider patient sample.","Paris, G; Martinaud, O; Hannequin, D; Petit, A; Cuvelier, A; Guedon, E; Ropenneck, P; Verin, E",Annals of physical and rehabilitation medicine,287,8

Patients should be selected for therapy based on an FDA-approved companion diagnostic test. Approval was primarily based on the FeDeriCa trial, a randomized, open-label, multi-center comparability study of pertuzumab, trastuzumab, and hyaluronidase-zzxf subcutaneous injection compared to intravenous (IV) pertuzumab and IV trastuzumab administered in the neoadjuvant and adjuvant settings with chemotherapy for the treatment of patients with early breast cancer. The pharmacokinetic endpoints were, first, to demonstrate that the exposure of subcutaneous pertuzumab was not inferior to that of IV pertuzumab, and then to demonstrate that the exposure of subcutaneous trastuzumab was not inferior to that of IV trastuzumab. The primary endpoints were met, with the observed lower limit of the two-sided 90% confidence intervals above the pre‑specified non-inferiority margins. The most common adverse reactions were alopecia, nausea, diarrhea, anemia, and asthenia.

The precise origin and subsequent path of transmission have not yet been established-but like the other novel coronaviruses that it closely resembles, it appears to have evolved naturally in a bat host. The disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection, designated as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), ranges from asymptomatic, to mild self-limited illness, to progressive pneumonia, respiratory compromise, multiorgan failure, and death. In addition, a hyperinflammatory disease state occurs in a subset of patients, and may be seen either during acute infection or following recovery. The search for effective pharmacological management of COVID-19 continues, but several promising candidates have been identified, including the viral nucleoside analog remdesivir. However, despite the existence of literally thousands of clinical trials, the management of COVID-19 remains challenging, and the development of an optimal, evidence-based therapeutic approach is ongoing. The impact of SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 on the biobanking world is evolving and profound-in particular, it is likely that many of mysteries surrounding COVID-19 will be solved via the availability of high-quality, large-scale collection, storage, and analysis of patient specimens. The purpose of this review article is therefore to provide a rapid, comprehensive, and relevant overview and primer on SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19, with attention to the epidemiology, virology, transmission, clinical features, and major therapeutic options currently existent.","Knight, Tristan E",Biopreservation and biobanking,287,16

Little is known about whether a one-stage procedure (one surgery for band removal and R-LRYGB) or a two-stage procedure (first band removal and later R-LRYGB) is superior. Aim of this study is to compare early- and long-term results of both methods at our institution. METHODS Retrospective analysis of 165 (m 26/f 139) consecutive patients (98 one-stage, 67 two-stage) with R-LRYGB. Mean follow-up time was 50.1 ± 38.8 months. Indications for one-stage vs. two-stage procedures, operating time, peri- and postoperative complications, morbidity, mortality, and length of stay (LOS) were analyzed. Data are reported as total numbers (%) and mean ± standard deviation. RESULTS Mean age at R-LRYGB was 43.9 ± 10.7 vs. 44.3 ± 10.7 years with a BMI of 37.1 ± 6.8 vs. 39.8 ± 7.1 (one-stage vs. two-stage). In the one-stage group, the main indication for revisional surgery was weight regain (57.1%), followed by dilatation of the esophagus or pouch (37.7%) and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) (36.7%), whereas in the two-stage group, it was band erosion (52.2%) and dilatation of the esophagus or pouch (17.9%) and GERD (11.9%). There was no significant difference in operative time (208.5 ± 61.2 vs. 206.3 ± 73.5 min), LOS (8.6 ± 3.4 vs. 9.3 ± 5.7 days) or mortality (0% overall). Major complications (Clavien-Dindo ≥ IIIa) occurred similarly often in both groups: 15.3% vs. 16.9% (one-stage vs. two-stage). CONCLUSION Both approaches achieve good results. However, the one-stage R-LRYGB is the preferable procedure because it reduces costs and LOS by doing without an additional surgical procedure.","Schäfer, A; Gehwolf, Philipp; Umlauft, J; Dziodzio, T; Biebl, M; Perathoner, A; Cakar-Beck, F; Wykypiel, H",Obesity surgery,287,12

METHODS We designed a multicentre pilot trial with 1:1:1 randomization to either 32 °C (n = 52), 33 °C (n = 49) or 34 °C (n = 49), via endovascular cooling devices during a 24-h period in comatose survivors of witnessed OHCA and initial shockable rhythm. The primary endpoint was the percentage of subjects surviving with good neurologic outcome defined by a modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score of ≤ 3, blindly assessed at 90 days. RESULTS At baseline, different proportions of patients who had received defibrillation administered by a bystander were assigned to groups of 32 °C (13.5%), 33 °C (34.7%) and 34 °C (28.6%; p = 0.03). The percentage of patients with an mRS ≤ 3 at 90 days (primary endpoint) was 65.3, 65.9 and 65.9% in patients assigned to 32, 33 and 34 °C, respectively, non-significant (NS). The multivariate Cox proportional hazards model identified two variables significantly related to the primary outcome: male gender and defibrillation by a bystander. Among the 43 patients who died before 90 days, 28 died following withdrawal of life-sustaining therapy, as follows: 7/16 (43.8%), 10/13 (76.9%) and 11/14 (78.6%) of patients assigned to 32, 33 and 34 °C, respectively (trend test p = 0.04). All levels of cooling were well tolerated. CONCLUSIONS There were no statistically significant differences in neurological outcomes among the different levels of TTM. However, future research should explore the efficacy of TTM at 32 °C.

PATIENTS, MATERIALS, AND METHODS From April 2007 to February 2013, 29 patients with upper gastrointestinal bleeding underwent endovascular diagnostics and treatment. The diagnosis was established by endoscopy, computed tomography or clinically based on a significant decrease in hemoglobin. Transcatheter arterial embolisation was performed with coils, liquid embolic agents, and particles. The technical and clinical outcomes were assessed by postinterventional endoscopy, hemoglobin concentrations, number of necessary transfusions, or surgical interventions, as well as by post-interventional mortality within 28 days after the procedure. RESULTS Selective angiographic embolisation in upper gastrointestinal bleeding was primarily successful technically and clinically in 22 of 29 patients. In 4/29 cases an angiographic reintervention was performed, which was successful in 3 cases. In 3 cases of primarily technically unsuccessful procedures reintervention was not attempted. No catheterisation-related complications were recorded. Peri-interventional mortality was 31%, but only 2 of these patients died due to uncontrolled massive bleeding, whereas the lethal outcome in the other 7 patients was due to their underlying diseases. CONCLUSION Transcatheter arterial embolisation is an effective and rapid method in the management of upper gastrointestinal bleeding. Radiological endovascular interventions may considerably contribute to reduced mortality in GI bleeding by avoiding a potential surgical procedure following unsuccessful endoscopic treatment. The study underlines the importance of the combination of interventional endoscopy with interventional radiology in secondary care hospitals for patient outcome in complex and complicated upper gastrointestinal bleeding situations.","Heining-Kruz, S; Finkenzeller, T; Schreyer, A; Dietl, K H; Kullmann, F; Paetzel, C; Schedel, J",Zeitschrift fur Gastroenterologie,287,16

METHODS The diagnosis and treatment process of one elderly patient with CAP accompanied by COVID-19 who was admitted to COVID-19 Treatment Center of Liaoning Province on February 7, 2020 were reviewed. The experience of treatment by analyzing the characteristics of such type of patients during diagnosis and treatment were summarized. RESULTS A female patient, aged 79 years ald, was admitted to the Center with following features: fever, dry cough, fatigue with dyspnea, scattered moist rales in both lungs, oxygenation index (PaCO2/FiO2) of 95 mmHg (1 mmHg = 0.133 kPa), and diffuse interstitial pneumonia in both lungs indicated by chest CT, of which the majority were ground glass-like and fibrous lesions. It was confirmed to be consistent with the feature of severe COVID-19 cases. The patient was successfully cured one month later following anti-inflammatory, anti-viral and high-flow oxygen therapies, homeostasis maintenance of the body, psychological counseling, etc. Accordingly, the treatment experience in CAP combined with COVID-19 in the elderly patients was summarized as follows. In respiratory system, the timing of high-flow oxygen therapy and mechanical ventilation should be seized. As for anti-inflammatory and antiviral therapy, attention should be paid to the treatment of CAP as well as antiviral therapy and symptomatic and supportive therapy. With the progression of the disease, the production of drug-resistant bacteria and the possibility of fungal infection should be paid attention to. For the circulatory system, we should pay attention to the stability of fluid volume and internal environment, and strengthen hemodynamic monitoring and bedside ultrasound to evaluate the cardiovascular capacity-load. In the aspect of the immune system, the selection of the application time of immune-enhancers and glucocorticoids should be paid attention to. In terms of enteral nutrition, early low-fat and high-protein diet is conducive to the recovery of intestinal function and the prevention of bacterial translocation. In addition to the protection of the function of important organs, therapies such as reasonable sedation and psychological intervention should also be used. CONCLUSIONS Elderly patients with CAP accompanied by COVID-19 have complicated conditions and high degree of difficulty in treatment. Comprehensive evaluation of the disease as well as synthetic and effective intervention are the key factors of successful treatment of such patients.","Li, Yongning; Ren, Yanbo; Kang, Jian; Zhang, Yu; He, Huanyu; Liu, Wenjuan; Zhang, Zhonghe",Zhonghua wei zhong bing ji jiu yi xue,287,12

This study's aim was to assess the impact of a healthy retail intervention on fruits and vegetables (FV) sales, as well as total sales, in tribally owned convenience stores where grocery stores are scarce. METHOD We analyzed weekly sales data over the first 6 months of a healthy retail intervention. We assessed the proportion of sales from two FV baskets. The FV basket included all fresh, canned, and dried FV sold at stores; while the fruits, vegetables, and salads (FVS) basket included all FV items as well as all salads sold. We compared mean weekly sales rates in intervention and control stores over the 6-month period using generalized estimating equations models to account for repeated measures. RESULTS Mean weekly FV basket sales rates were higher in intervention stores than control stores in both Nations. Mean weekly FVS baskets sales were significantly higher in intervention stores than control stores in one Nation and were higher, but not statistically significant, in intervention stores in the other Nation. Total sales remained steady throughout the intervention period. CONCLUSIONS The THRIVE (Tribal Health and Resilience in Vulnerable Environments) intervention increased FV sales without negatively affecting total sales. Policy and Practice Implications. Healthy retail interventions in tribal convenience stores, where many Native Americans living in rural areas shop due to scarcity of grocery stores, could improve diet-related disparities without reducing total sales.","Williams, Mary B; Wang, Wenyu; Taniguchi, Tori; Salvatore, Alicia L; Groover, William K; Wetherill, Mariana; Love, Charlotte; Cannady, Tamela; Grammar, Mandy; Standridge, Joy; Fox, Jill; Jernigan, Valarie Blue Bird",Health promotion practice,287,1

Increased adherence with the bundle is associated with better postoperative outcomes, but adherence is lowest in the postoperative period. Identifying risk factors for lower adherence may help design quality improvement strategies. The aim of this study was to estimate the extent to which patient, procedural, and organizational factors predict adherence to postoperative ERP elements in laparoscopic colorectal surgery. METHODS Patients in an institutional ERP registry undergoing elective laparoscopic colorectal surgery between 2012 and 2014 were analyzed. The ERP included 10 postoperative ERP elements classified into 2 groups: those requiring patient participation (PP, 5 elements, including nutritional intake and mobilization) and those provided by the clinical team (CT, 5 elements, including removal of catheters and type of analgesia). The impact of baseline and intraoperative factors on adherence was estimated using stepwise linear regression. RESULTS A total of 223 patients were included (mean age 60, 48% male). Mean adherence was 79% to the PP bundle (range 65-93% for individual elements), and 82% for the CT bundle (range 68-98% for individual elements). The occurrence of nausea/vomiting in the first 24 h was associated with lower adherence to both bundles. In the PP bundle, patients who arrived at the ward after 6 p.m. had lower adherence. In the CT bundle, patients who had rectal resection had lower adherence while thoracic epidural was associated with higher adherence. CONCLUSIONS With the exception of postoperative nausea and vomiting, predictors of adherence to ERP elements after colorectal surgery differed for elements requiring patient participation and those provided by the clinical team. Strategies to improve ERP adherence should target staff education and engagement of patients at risk for lower adherence.","Mata, Juan; Fiore, Julio F; Pecorelli, Nicolo; Stein, Barry L; Liberman, Sender; Charlebois, Patrick; Feldman, Liane S",Surgical endoscopy,287,7

A defining feature of EAG (Kv10-12) channels is a highly conserved domain on the amino-terminus, known as the eag-domain, consisting of a PAS domain capped by a short sequence containing an amphipathic helix (Cap-domain). The PAS and Cap domains are both vital for the normal function of EAG channels. Using heme-affinity pull-down assays and proteomics of lysates from primary cortical neurons, we identified that an EAG channel, hERG3 (Kv11.3), binds to heme. In whole cell electrophysiology experiments, we identified that heme inhibits hERG3 channel activity. In addition, we expressed the Cap and PAS domain of hERG3 in E.coli and, using spectroscopy and kinetics, identified the PAS domain as the location for heme binding. The results identify heme as a regulator of hERG3 channel activity. These observations are discussed in the context of the emerging role for heme as a regulator of ion channel activity in cells.","Burton, Mark J; Cresser-Brown, Joel; Thomas, Morgan; Portolano, Nicola; Basran, Jaswir; Freeman, Samuel L; Kwon, Hanna; Bottrill, Andrew R; Llansola-Portoles, Manuel J; Pascal, Andrew A; Jukes-Jones, Rebekah; Chernova, Tatyana; Schmid, Ralf; Davies, Noel W; Storey, Nina M; Dorlet, Pierre; Moody, Peter C E; Mitcheson, John S; Raven, Emma L",The Journal of biological chemistry,287,1

For that, the synthesis and characterization of this new platform as well as its spatiotemporal analysis from in vitro and in vivo topical application were explored and extensively discussed in this paper. The TAT or D4 peptides were chosen as CPP due to specific target strategies by the charge grouping on the skin surface or target the overexpressed epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) of cell membrane of keratinocytes, respectively. Thus, the nanoparticle characterization results when taken together suggested that designed LCNs maintained their hexagonal phase structure, nanoscale particle size, and low polydispersity index even after drug, lipopolymers, and peptide additions, which are proved to be favorable for topical skin delivery. There were no statistical differences among the LCNs investigated, except for superficial charge of LCN conjugated with TAT which may have altered the LCN zeta potential due to cationic charge of TAT amino acid sequence compared with D4. The cumulative amounts of LA retained into the skin were determined to be even higher coming from the targeted LCNs. Moreover, the exogenous antioxidant application of the LA from the LCNs can prevent ROS damage, which was demonstrated by this study with the less myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity and decrease in cytokine levels (TNF-alpha and IL-1β) generated by the oxidative stress modulation. Together, the data presented highlights the potential of these targeted LCNs, and overall, opens new frontiers for preclinical trials.","Campos, Patrícia Mazureki; Praça, Fabíola Garcia; Mussi, Samuel Vidal; Figueiredo, Sônia Aparecida; Fantini, Márcia Carvalho de Abreu; Fonseca, Maria José Vieira; Torchilin, Vladimir P; Bentley, Maria Vitória Lopes Badra",Drug delivery and translational research,287,1

The differential diagnosis for upper-extremity pain associated with paresthesias will be the focus of this review. Symptoms are often neurologic in etiology, originating from the spinal cord, nerve root(s), brachial plexus, or peripheral nerve(s). Localizing the pathology starts with a comprehensive understanding of neuromuscular anatomy. It also is imperative to understand the function of these respective structures. The differential diagnosis can be narrowed with a thorough history, including an assessment of sport-specific risk factors, along with a comprehensive physical examination and functional assessment. It is important to determine the sensory distribution of the patient's symptoms. If weakness also is present, the affected muscles must be identified. While the diagnosis can often be made clinically, electrodiagnostics, magnetic resonance imaging, and ultrasound can be used as needed for confirmation and more specific localization. Nonneurologic structures also may be causative or contributory to the patient's symptoms and also should be considered.","Smith, Sarah M; McMullen, Christopher W; Herring, Stanley A",Current sports medicine reports,287,5

OBJECTIVE To analyse systemic and local subclinical inflammation and adipose tissue lymphocyte content and phenotype in pregnant females with and without GDM. DESIGN Observational study. SETTINGS Academic hospital. PATIENTS Twenty-one pregnant females with GDM (GDM group), 16 pregnant women without GDM (non-GDM group) and 15 non-pregnant control females (N group). INTERVENTIONS Serum samples taken at 28-32 (V1) and 36-38 (V2) gestational week and 6-12 months after delivery (V3) in GDM and non-GDM group and before elective gynaecological surgery in N group. Subcutaneous (SAT) and visceral adipose tissue (VAT) obtained during Caesarean delivery or surgery. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Serum levels and adipose tissue expression of proinflammatory cytokines, adipose tissue lymphocyte content and phenotype (for a subset of GDM and non-GDM subjects). RESULTS Accented proinflammatory state in GDM was documented by increased circulating TNF-α levels. In both groups of pregnant females total lymphocytes were higher in VAT compared to SAT. In GDM subjects B and NKT cells were higher in SAT compared to VAT and Th cells were increased relative to SAT of non-GDM group, while no intercompartmental adipose tissue differences were seen in non-GDM females. CONCLUSIONS Pregnant females had higher total lymphocyte count in VAT relative to SAT regardless of GDM. In addition to increased systemic subclinical inflammation, GDM was associated with significant differences in lymphocyte composition between subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissue depots.","Cinkajzlová, Anna; Anderlová, Kateřina; Šimják, Patrik; Lacinová, Zdeňka; Kloučková, Jana; Kratochvílová, Helena; Krejčí, Hana; Pařízek, Antonín; Mráz, Miloš; Kršek, Michal; Haluzík, Martin",The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism,287,31

Because no intratumoral solid component was detected on diagnostic imaging, the tumor was diagnosed as a benign ovarian tumor and the patient underwent left ovarian laparoscopic cystectomy. Contrary to our expectations, however, the ovarian tumor was a mucinous carcinoma. We performed additional surgery, but the tumor recurred in the umbilical area, and multiple subcutaneous metastases later appeared. The curative effect of chemotherapy and radiation was limited. This atypical metastatic distribution of an extremely small amount of cancer might have been caused by the laparoscopic procedure.

Related HEs occur in influenza C, toro-, and coronaviruses, apparently as a result of relatively recent lateral gene transfer events. Here, we report the crystal structure of a coronavirus (CoV) HE in complex with its receptor. We show that CoV HE arose from an influenza C-like HE fusion protein (HEF). In the process, HE was transformed from a trimer into a dimer, whereas remnants of the fusion domain were adapted to establish novel monomer-monomer contacts. Whereas the structural design of the RDE-acetylesterase domain remained unaltered, the HE receptor-binding domain underwent remodeling to such extent that the ligand is now bound in opposite orientation. This is surprising, because the architecture of the HEF site was preserved in influenza A HA over a much larger evolutionary distance, a switch in receptor specificity and extensive antigenic variation notwithstanding. Apparently, HA and HEF are under more stringent selective constraints than HE, limiting their exploration of alternative binding-site topologies. We attribute the plasticity of the CoV HE receptor-binding site to evolutionary flexibility conferred by functional redundancy between HE and its companion spike protein S. Our findings offer unique insights into the structural and functional consequences of independent protein evolution after interviral gene exchange and open potential avenues to broad-spectrum antiviral drug design.","Zeng, Qinghong; Langereis, Martijn A; van Vliet, Arno L W; Huizinga, Eric G; de Groot, Raoul J",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,287,16

African-Americans and older patients have less frequently used electronic messaging with their physicians. This study compares the utilization of virtual health care before and during the COVID pandemic for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients. METHODS A chart review of all IBD patients seen at an academic medical center from 2014-2020 was conducted to evaluate the use of telehealth options (e-messaging, e-visits) during a pre-COVID and COVID timeframe. Analysis of telehealth use from March - August 2018 and March - August 2020 was performed. Patient age, gender, race, IBD type, electronic messaging and telehealth visits were obtained. A confidential database was created. Statistical analysis was performed using Fisher Exact test with significance set at p < 0.05. The study was IRB approved. RESULTS 392 patients were in the pre-COVID cohort. There were 204 White, 99 African-American, 11 Asian, and 78 racially un-identified patients. 160 (40.8%) initiated E-communication with their physicians. There was a significant difference in the use of e-messaging based upon age (51.1% < 50 vs 39.7% ≥ 50; p = 0.0396) and race (62.3% White vs 28.2% African-American; p < 0.00001).There were no significant differences in the use of e-messaging based upon patient gender (p = 0.6840) or IBD type (p = 0.6374). There were 295 patients in the COVID cohort. There were 155 White, 83 African American patients, 24 Hispanic patients, 10 Asian patients, and 22 racially un-identified patients. 109 (36.9%) utilized a telehealth option (53 via e-messaging; 56 via telemedicine visit). There was no significant difference in the use of a telehealth option based upon age (36.8% < 50 vs 37.25% ≥ 50 years; p = 1.00), race (42.6% White vs 35.9% African-American; p = 0.2693) or IBD type (p = 0.331). Males used telehealth more than females (46.1% vs 29.7%, respectively; p = 0.0051). DISCUSSION The COVID pandemic emergency increased e-visits and e-messaging for care delivery. Expanded telemedicine options for IBD patients eliminated previously identified racial and age disparities in virtual medical care. African Americans utilized electronic communication as frequently as Whites during the pandemic. Post-pandemic policy consideration for continued telemedicine options may expand patient-physician engagement and eliminate disparities in health care.","Hayrapetian, Laurie; Zepp, Molly; Rao, Sanjana; Hennessey, Megan; Houle, Matthew; Atienza, Matthew; Belfaqeeh, Omar Ali; Dharia, Ishaan; Khan, Ali; Borum, Marie L",Journal of the National Medical Association,287,10

However, postoperative pancreatic fistula (POPF) remains is the most feared complication, and the ideal technique for pancreatic reconstruction is undetermined. MATERIALS AND METHODS This study is a retrospective review of a prospectively maintained database. Data were collected from all consecutive robot-assisted pancreaticoduodenectomies (RAPD), performed by a single surgeon, at the University of Illinois Hospital & Health Sciences System, between September 2007 and January 2016. RESULTS A total of 28 consecutive patients (16 male and 12 female) who underwent a RAPD were included in this study. Patients had a mean age and mean BMI of 61.5 years (SD = 12.3) and 27 kg/m2 (SD = 4.9), respectively. The mean operative time was 468.2 min (SD = 73.7) and the average estimated blood loss was 216.1 ml (SD = 113.1). The mean length of hospitalization was 13.1 days (SD = 5.4). There was no clinically significant POPF registered. CONCLUSION Trans-gastric pancreaticogastrostomy (TPG) represents a valid and feasible option as a pancreatic digestive reconstruction during RAPD. Initial results showed decreased incidence of POPF with an increased risk of postoperative bleeding. Our experience suggests that TPG might be safer than pancreaticojejunostomy (PJ); further studies are needed in order to confirm.","Giulianotti, Pier C; Gonzalez-Heredia, Raquel; Esposito, Sofia; Masrur, Mario; Gangemi, Antonio; Bianco, Francesco M",Surgical endoscopy,287,1

The rapid spread of this species is facilitated by the prevalence of its preferred host, tree of heaven (Ailanthus altissima (Mill.) Swingle), as well as its use of many other host plants. While the spotted lanternfly has been previously reported to use over 65 plant species, most of these reports are from Asia and may not be applicable in North America. Additionally, many of the known hosts have not been specified as feeding hosts or as egg laying substrates. To better understand the potential impacts of this invasive insect on natural and cultivated systems in North America, we reviewed records from published and unpublished results and observations of host plant use by spotted lanternfly. We aggregated 172 host plant records worldwide and found feeding behaviors associated with 103 plant taxa across 33 families and 17 orders, 20 of which were not previously known to be associated with SLF and 15 of which were not confirmed as feeding hosts. North American records account for 56 of these taxa which include native, cultivated, and nonnative species. As a result, the spotted lanternfly has the potential to impact a wide assortment of ecosystems throughout its potential range and its North American distribution may not be limited by the presence of tree of heaven.","Barringer, Lawrence; Ciafré, Claire M",Environmental entomology,287,1

Clinical classification (mild, moderate, severe, and critical) was carried out according to the diagnosis and treatment program of novel coronavirus pneumonia (Trial Fifth Edition) issued by the National Health Commission. The research data were analyzed using SPSS19.0 statistical software. Quantitative data were expressed as median (interquartile range), and qualitative data were expressed as frequency and rate. Results: 32 confirmed cases that met the inclusion criteria were included. 28 cases were of mild or moderate type (87.50%), and four cases (12.50%) of severe or critical type. Four cases (12.5%) were combined with one underlying disease (bronchial asthma, coronary heart disease, malignant tumor, chronic kidney disease), and one case (3.13%) was simultaneously combined with high blood pressure and malignant tumor. The results of laboratory examination showed that the alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), albumin (ALB), and total bilirubin (TBil) for entire cohort were 26.98 (16.88 ~ 46.09) U/L and 24.75 (18.71 ~ 31.79) U/L, 39.00 (36.20 ~ 44.20) g/L and 16.40 (11.34- ~ 21.15) mmol/L, respectively.

Neurophysiological and neuroprosthetic research have the potential to improve quality of life for these patients; however, the lack of an ethical and sustainable nonhuman primate model for paraplegia hinders their advancement. Therefore, our multidisciplinary team developed a way to induce temporary paralysis in awake behaving macaques by creating a fully implantable lumbar epidural catheter-subcutaneous port system that enables easy and reliable targeted drug delivery for sensorimotor blockade. During treadmill walking, aliquots of 1.5% lidocaine with 1:200,000 epinephrine were percutaneously injected into the ports of three rhesus macaques while surface electromyography (EMG) recorded muscle activity from their quadriceps and gastrocnemii. Diminution of EMG amplitude, loss of voluntary leg movement, and inability to bear weight were achieved for 60-90 min in each animal, followed by a complete recovery of function. The monkeys remained alert and cooperative during the paralysis trials and continued to take food rewards, and the ports remained functional after several months. This technique will enable recording from the cortex and/or spinal cord in awake behaving nonhuman primates during the onset, maintenance, and resolution of paraplegia for the first time, thus opening the door to answering basic neurophysiological questions about the acute neurological response to spinal cord injury and recovery. It will also negate the need to permanently injure otherwise high-value research animals for certain experimental paradigms aimed at developing and testing neural interface decoding algorithms for patients with lower extremity dysfunction.NEW & NOTEWORTHY A novel implantable lumbar epidural catheter-subcutaneous port system enables targeted drug delivery and induction of temporary paraplegia in awake, behaving nonhuman primates. Three macaques displayed loss of voluntary leg movement for 60-90 min after injection of lidocaine with epinephrine, followed by a full recovery. This technique for the first time will enable ethical live recording from the proximal central nervous system during the acute onset, maintenance, and resolution of paraplegia.","Krucoff, Max O; Zhuang, Katie; MacLeod, David; Yin, Allen; Byun, Yoon Woo; Manson, Roberto Jose; Turner, Dennis A; Oliveira, Laura; Lebedev, Mikhail A",Journal of neurophysiology,287,31

This extends to the self-other relationship as there is both being infected and infecting the other. What this pandemic crisis tells us about our self and relatedness, its cultural differences, and how these are rooted in the brain's relation to the world. METHODS First, we discuss about the psychological and neuronal features of self and and self-other relation and how they are rooted in a deeper layer of the brain's neural activity complemeting its cognitive surface layer. Secondly, we demonstrate cultural differences of eastern and western concepts of self, i.e., independency and inter-dependency, and how these reflect the manifestation of the brain's neuro-social and -ecological alignment. Finally, we highlight how inter-subjective and cultural nature of self surface in the COVID-19 crisis. RESULTS Discussing various lines of empirical data showing the brain's intimate alignment to both social and ecological environmental contexts our results support the assumption of the brain's deep layer features by laying bare a continuum of different degrees of neuro-social and neuro-ecological alignment. This entails a a two-stage model of self with neuro-social-ecological and psychological levels that extends the previously suggested basis model of self-specificity (BMSS). CONCLUSION We conclude that the current pandemic shows the importance of the deeper inter-subjective and cultural layers of both self and brain; their neglect can be life-threatening for self and others and, paradoxically, might reduce, rather than enlarge, the self's sense of freedom and independence.

Angiotensin II (Ang II), as a key peptide of RAS, contributes to the contraction of human airway smooth muscle by activating the RhoA/Rho-associated coiled-coil containing protein kinase 2 (ROCK2) signaling pathway. Angiotensin-(1-7) [Ang-(1-7)], is a component of the angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)-Ang-(1-7)-Mas axis which counteracts the detrimental effects of the ACE- Ang II-angiotensin type 1 receptor (AT1R) axis in vivo; however, whether Ang-(1-7) can inhibit the effect of Ang II in the contraction of human airway smooth muscle cells (HASMCs) is unknown. In our study, collagen gel lattices and immunofluorescence were used to evaluate the contraction of HASMCs induced by Ang II. Real-time PCR and western blot analysis were performed to confirm the regulatory mechanism and the participating signaling pathway. Ang II caused the contraction of HASMCs; this effect was reversed by Ang‑(1‑7). In addition, irbesartan and A779, which are inhibitors of AT1R and Mas, respectively, attenuated the effect of Ang II and Ang-(1-7). Furthermore, Y-27632, an inhibitor of ROCK2, attenuated the Ang II-induced contraction of HASMCs by blocking the RhoA/ROCK2 signaling pathway which is involved in this contraction, and thus may be a major regulator involved in the basal maintenance of contractility in HASMCs. These data demonstrate that Ang II induces the contraction of HASMCs and that this effect can be reversed by Ang-(1-7), partially through the downregulation of of the RhoA/ROCK2 signaling pathway.","Li, Ning; Cai, Ruijun; Niu, Yi; Shen, Bin; Xu, Jian; Cheng, Yuanxiong",International journal of molecular medicine,287,19

The effects of climate change are complex and difficult to predict with certainty. Health risks include changes in the distribution of infectious disease, expansion of zoonotic diseases and vectors, changing migration patterns, impacts on food security and changes in water availability and quality, among others. A regional network of diverse stakeholder and transdisciplinary specialists from circumpolar nations and Indigenous groups can advance the understanding of complex climate-driven health risks and provide community-based strategies for early identification, prevention and adaption of health risks in human, animals and environment.

METHODS This systematic review followed the PRISMA guidelines (CRD42020172482 on PROSPERO). A search in MEDLINE, PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews was conducted from inception to March 5, 2020. Studies with patients ≥ 65 years undergoing EGS were included. The primary exposure was frailty, measured using the Clinical Frailty Scale or the Modified Frailty Index. The primary outcome was 30-day mortality. Secondary outcomes were 90-day and 1-year mortality, length of stay, complications, change in level of care at discharge, and loss of independence. Two independent reviewers screened articles and extracted data. Risk of bias was assessed according to the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale and quality of evidence was assessed using the GRADE approach. A meta-analysis was performed for 30-day mortality using a random-effects model. RESULTS Our search yielded 847 articles and six cohort studies were included in the systematic review. There were 1289 patients, 283 being frail. The pooled OR from meta-analysis for frail compared to non-frail patients was 2.91 (95% CI 2.00, 4.23) for 30-day mortality. Frailty was associated with increased odds of all secondary outcomes. CONCLUSION Frailty is significantly associated with worse outcomes after emergency general surgery in adults ≥ 65 years of age. The Clinical Frailty Scale could be used to improve preoperative risk assessment for patients and shared decision-making between patients and healthcare providers.

Several studies have suggested patients with more severe systemic presentations are most affected by neurological symptoms, 1,2 while data from brain of postmortem patients show that SARS-CoV-2 has neuroinvasive properties. The outcomes in the central nervous system (CNS) may be also associated with an exacerbated inflammatory process, or cytokine storm, a well-characterized effect of COVID-19 that result from an overreaction of immune system, particularly involving the augment of interleukin 6 (IL-6).

Neutrophils are innate immunity effector cells with well-established microbe-killing activities that are rapidly mobilized upon infection. They are also emerging as orchestrators of innate and adaptive immunities. However, their immunomodulatory activity during antiviral mAb immunotherapies has never been studied. Our data reveal that neutrophils have an essential role in immunotherapy-induced immune protection of infected mice. Unexpectedly, neutrophils have a limited effect in controlling viral propagation upon passive immunotherapy administration, which is mostly mediated by NK cells. Instead, neutrophils operate as essential inducers of a potent host humoral antiviral response. Thus, neutrophils play an unexpected key role in protective immunity induction by antiviral mAbs. Our work opens approaches to improve antiviral immunotherapies, as it suggests that preserving neutrophil functions and counts might be required for achieving mAb-induced protective immunity.","Naranjo-Gomez, Mar; Lambour, Jennifer; Piechaczyk, Marc; Pelegrin, Mireia",JCI insight,287,4

We also evaluated the accuracy of ischemic core and hypoperfusion volumes for predicting infarct volume in patients with the target mismatch profile. METHODS Baseline ischemic core and hypoperfusion volumes were assessed prior to randomized treatment with intravenous (IV) tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) alone versus IV tPA + endovascular therapy (Solitaire stent-retriever) using RAPID automated postprocessing software. Reperfusion was assessed with angiographic Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction scores at the end of the procedure (endovascular group) and Tmax > 6-second volumes at 27 hours (both groups). Infarct volume was assessed at 27 hours on noncontrast CT or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). RESULTS A total of 151 patients with baseline imaging with CT perfusion (79%) or multimodal MRI (21%) were included. The median baseline ischemic core volume was 6 ml (interquartile range= 0-16). Ischemic core volumes correlated with 27-hour infarct volumes in patients who achieved reperfusion (r = 0.58, p < 0.0001). In patients who did not reperfuse (<10% reperfusion), baseline Tmax > 6-second lesion volumes correlated with 27-hour infarct volume (r = 0.78, p = 0.005). In target mismatch patients, the union of baseline core and early follow-up Tmax > 6-second volume (ie, predicted infarct volume) correlated with the 27-hour infarct volume (r = 0.73, p < 0.0001); the median absolute difference between the observed and predicted volume was 13 ml.

As expected, we also observed an increase in the IFNβ levels, the first line of defense against viral infections. Subsequently, when AML1 was downregulated using siRNA, the IFNβ levels were found to be remarkably reduced.

At 12 months, in the ultrasound substudy, valvular reflux prevalence was similar between groups (85% vs 91%, p = 0.35). CFV non-compressibility at 1 month was associated with higher rates of any PTS (61% vs 46%, p < 0.001), a higher incidence of moderate-or-severe PTS (30% vs 19%, p = 0.003), and worse QOL (difference 8.2 VEINES-QOL (VEnous INsufficiency Epidemiological and Economic Study on Quality of Life) points; p = 0.004) at 24 months.

However, there has been no discussion of what may induce intravascular coagulation. Platelets are critical in the formation of thrombi and their most potent trigger is platelet activating factor (PAF), first characterized by Demopoulos and colleagues in 1979. PAF is produced by cells involved in host defense and its biological actions bear similarities with COVID-19 disease manifestations. PAF can also stimulate perivascular mast cell activation, leading to inflammation implicated in severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Mast cells are plentiful in the lungs and are a rich source of PAF and of inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1β and IL-6, which may contribute to COVID-19 and especially SARS. The histamine-1 receptor antagonist rupatadine was developed to have anti-PAF activity, and also inhibits activation of human mast cells in response to PAF. Rupatadine could be repurposed for COVID-19 prophylaxis alone or together with other PAF-inhibitors of natural origin such as the flavonoids quercetin and luteolin, which have antiviral, anti-inflammatory, and anti-PAF actions.","Demopoulos, Constantinos; Antonopoulou, Smaragdi; Theoharides, Theoharis C",BioFactors,287,23

In 2015/16 the network introduced intra-hospital transfer documentation and applied the same transfer training and audit methodology for critically ill patients being moved within hospitals. While increasing data capture and with a targeted training strategy adapted from transfer experience, the network has seen a reduction in number and severity of incidents in the region. In contrast to this experience, no formalised processes exists to support the inter-hospital or intra-hospital transfer of patients from enhanced care areas or wards not embedded within critical care. Often very little data is collected from these areas, but we suspect transfer risks are higher in these cases as a consequence of the deficit of structured transfers.

In addition, these proteases cleave the viral receptor, the carboxypeptidase angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), and it was proposed that ACE2 cleavage augments viral infectivity. However, no mechanistic insights into this process were obtained and the relevance of ACE2 cleavage for SARS-CoV S protein (SARS-S) activation has not been determined. Here, we show that arginine and lysine residues within ACE2 amino acids 697 to 716 are essential for cleavage by TMPRSS2 and HAT and that ACE2 processing is required for augmentation of SARS-S-driven entry by these proteases. In contrast, ACE2 cleavage was dispensable for activation of the viral S protein. Expression of TMPRSS2 increased cellular uptake of soluble SARS-S, suggesting that protease-dependent augmentation of viral entry might be due to increased uptake of virions into target cells. Finally, TMPRSS2 was found to compete with the metalloprotease ADAM17 for ACE2 processing, but only cleavage by TMPRSS2 resulted in augmented SARS-S-driven entry. Collectively, our results in conjunction with those of previous studies indicate that TMPRSS2 and potentially related proteases promote SARS-CoV entry by two separate mechanisms: ACE2 cleavage, which might promote viral uptake, and SARS-S cleavage, which activates the S protein for membrane fusion. These observations have interesting implications for the development of novel therapeutics. In addition, they should spur efforts to determine whether receptor cleavage promotes entry of other coronaviruses, which use peptidases as entry receptors.","Heurich, Adeline; Hofmann-Winkler, Heike; Gierer, Stefanie; Liepold, Thomas; Jahn, Olaf; Pöhlmann, Stefan",Journal of virology,287,19

In the current study, the potential for exebacase to treat S. aureus pneumonia was explored in vitro using bovine pulmonary surfactant (Survanta®) and in vivo using a lethal murine pneumonia model. Exebacase was active against a set of methicillin-sensitive and methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MSSA and MRSA, respectively), with an MIC90 of 2 μg/mL (n=18 strains), in the presence of a surfactant concentration (7.5%) inhibitory to the antistaphylococcal antibiotic, daptomycin, which is inactive in pulmonary environments due to specific inhibition by surfactant. In a rigorous test of the ability of exebacase to synergize with antistaphylococcal antibiotics, exebacase synergized with daptomycin in the presence of surfactant in vitro, resulting in daptomycin MIC reductions up to 64-fold against 9 MRSA and 9 MSSA strains. Exebacase was also observed to facilitate binding of daptomycin to S. aureus and elimination of biofilm-like structures formed in the presence of surfactant. Exebacase (5 mg/kg, q24d, administered intravenously for 3 days) was efficacious in a murine model of staphylococcal pneumonia, resulting in 50% survival compared to 0% survival in vehicle control; exebacase in addition to daptomycin (50 mg/kg, q24d, 3 days) resulted in 70% survival, compared to 0% survival in the daptomycin alone control. Overall, exebacase in active in pulmonary environments and may be appropriate for development as a treatment for staphylococcal pneumonia.","Swift, Steven M; Sauve, Karen; Cassino, Cara; Schuch, Raymond",Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy,287,1

Its collaborative and reflexive process invites stakeholders (e.g. pharmacists and pharmacy support staff) to participate in analysing their everyday work practices as captured on video footage. Through close collaboration with practitioners and attention to their work contexts, VRE may be a useful methodology to engage a time-poor pharmacy workforce in research about themselves, encouraging more practitioner involvement in practice-based research. Aside from research, VRE has also been used effectively as an intervention to facilitate learning and change in healthcare settings, and could be effective in provoking change in otherwise resistant pharmacy environments. Much like traditional ethnographic approaches, VRE researchers have relied on being present 'in the field' to observe, record and make sense of practices with participants. The COVID-19 pandemic however, has introduced restrictions around travel and physical distancing, which has required researchers to contemplate the conduct of VRE 'at a distance', and to imagine new ways in which the methodological 'closeness' to stakeholders and their workplace contexts can be maintained when researchers cannot be on site. In this commentary, we outline the rationale for participatory methods, in the form of VRE, in pharmacy research. We describe the underlying principles of this innovative methodology, and offer examples of how VRE can be used in pharmacy research. Finally, we offer a reflexive account of how we have adapted the method for use in community pharmacy research, to adapt to physical distancing, without sacrificing its methodological principles. This paper offers not only a new methodology to examine the complexity of pharmacy work, but demonstrates also the responsiveness of VRE itself to complexity, and the potential breadth of future research applications in pharmacy both during and beyond the current pandemic.","Yong, Faith R; Hor, Su-Yin; Bajorek, Beata V",Research in social & administrative pharmacy : RSAP,287,24

METHODS This study used data from the 2008-2011 Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Overall, 1,089 patients with diabetes aged >40 years were included. The duration of daily sunlight exposure was assessed via health interviews. Comprehensive ophthalmic evaluations, including standard retinal fundus photography after pupil dilation, were conducted. Diabetic retinopathy was graded using the modified Airlie House Classification. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to analyze the association between daily sunlight exposure duration and the diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy and non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy. RESULTS The risk of diabetic retinopathy was 2.66 times higher in the group with ≥5 h of daily sunlight exposure than in the group with less exposure after adjusting for risk factors such as duration of diabetes, serum hemoglobin A1c level, hypertension, and dyslipidemia (P = 0.023). Furthermore, the risk of non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy was 3.13 times higher in the group with ≥5 h of daily sunlight exposure than in the group with less exposure (P = 0.009). In patients with diabetes for <10 years, the risks of diabetic retinopathy and non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy were 4.26 and 4.82 times higher in the group with ≥5 h of daily sunlight exposure than the group with less exposure, respectively (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS This study revealed that sunlight exposure for ≥5 h a day was significantly associated with an increased risk of diabetic retinopathy and non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy in Korean patients with diabetes. The risks were significantly higher in patients with diabetes for <10 years. Therefore, reducing daily sunlight exposure could be an early preventive strategy against diabetic retinopathy in people with diabetes.","Lee, Hye Jun; Kim, Choon Ok; Lee, Duk Chul",PloS one,287,1

Some studies report that DFM is frequent among overweight or obese mothers. We aimed to determine the significance and associations of fetal movements in women of increased body size. MATERIAL AND METHODS This systematic review was conducted in accordance with the PRISMA statement and the protocol was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42016046352). Major databases were explored from inception to September 2017, using a predefined search strategy. We restricted inclusion to studies published in English and considered studies of any design that compared fetal movements in women of increased and normal body size. Two authors independently extracted data and assessed quality. RESULTS We included 23 publications from 19 observational studies; data were extracted from 10 studies. Increased maternal body size was not associated with altered perception of fetal movement (four studies, 95 women, very low-quality evidence), but was associated with increased presentation for DFM (two cohort studies, 20 588 women, OR 1.56, 95% CI 1.27-1.92: three case-control studies, 3445 women, OR 1.32, 95% CI 1.12-1.54; low-quality evidence). Among women with DFM, increased maternal body size was associated with increased risk of stillbirth and fetal growth restriction (one study, 2168 women, very low-quality evidence). CONCLUSIONS This systematic review identified limited evidence that women with increased body size are more likely to present with DFM but do not have impaired perception of fetal movements. In women with DFM, increased body size is associated with worse pregnancy outcome, including stillbirth.","Bradford, Billie F; Thompson, John M D; Heazell, Alexander E P; Mccowan, Lesley M E; McKinlay, Chris J D",Acta obstetricia et gynecologica Scandinavica,287,1

Many of these procedures are performed using laparoscopic minimally invasive techniques and employ the use of surgical mesh. The use of surgical mesh has been shown to reduce recurrence rates compared to standard suture repairs. The placement of surgical mesh in a ventral hernia repair procedure can be challenging, and may even complicate the procedure. Others have attempted to provide commercial solutions to the problems of mesh placement, but these have not been well accepted by the clinical community. In this article, two versions of shape memory polymer (SMP)-modified surgical mesh, and unmodified surgical mesh, were compared by performing laparoscopic manipulation in an acute porcine model. Also, SMP-integrated polyester surgical meshes were implanted in four rats for 30-33 days to evaluate chronic biocompatibility and capacity for tissue integration. Porcine results show that the modified mesh provides a controlled, temperature-activated, automated deployment when compared to an unmodified mesh. In rats, results indicate that implanted SMP-modified meshes exhibit exceptional biocompatibility and excellent integration with surrounding tissue with no noticeable differences from the unmodified counterpart. This article provides further evidence that an SMP-modified surgical mesh promises reduction in surgical placement time and that such a mesh is not substantially different from unmodified meshes in chronic biocompatibility.","Zimkowski, Michael M; Rentschler, Mark E; Schoen, Jonathan A; Mandava, Nageswara; Shandas, Robin","Journal of biomedical materials research.

The expansion has resulted in arbitrarily created synonyms of probe tags used in publications and software. The synonyms are problematic for readability of publications, accuracy of text/data mining, and bridging data from multiple platforms, protocols, and databases for Big Data analysis. Development and implementation of a universal language for probe tags will ensure equivalent quality and level of data being reported or extracted for clinical/scientific evaluation as well as help connect data from many platforms.

In addition, severe COVID-19 has been associated with an increased risk of arterial and venous thromboses. In this report, we describe the case of a hemodialysis patient who developed an otherwise-unexplained thrombosis of an arteriovenous fistula during a symptomatic COVID-19 infection. Despite prompt treatment with three technically successful thrombectomies along with systemic intravenous heparin and two rounds of catheter-directed thrombolysis with tissue plasminogen activator, the fistula rapidly re-thrombosed each time and he required tunneled dialysis catheter placement. He subsequently required admission for hypoxemia from COVID-19 pneumonia and ultimately developed a catheter-related blood stream infection that likely contributed to his death. As the fistula had been previously well functioning and no angiographic explanation for the thrombosis was found, we speculate in this case the recurrent thromboses were related to the hypercoagulable state characteristic of severe COVID-19. Interventionalists performing hemodialysis access procedures should be aware of the prothrombotic state associated with COVID-19 and should consider it when deliberating how to best plan and approach access interventions in patients with symptomatic COVID-19.","Teixeira, Joao Pedro; Combs, Sara A; Owen, Jonathan G",The journal of vascular access,287,19

DESIGN We performed an observational study of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients between March 2020 and December 2020. Coronavirus disease 2019 status (confirmed, suspected, or negative) was defined according to the World Health Organization's criteria. SETTING Information on the patients and their care was extracted from the French national out-of-hospital cardiac arrest registry. The French prehospital emergency medical system has two tiers: the fire department intervenes rapidly to provide basic life support, and mobile ICUs provide advanced life support. The study data (including each patient's coronavirus disease 2019 status) were collected by 95 mobile ICUs throughout France. PATIENTS We included 6,624 out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients: 127 cases with confirmed coronavirus disease 2019, 473 with suspected coronavirus disease 2019, and 6,024 negative for coronavirus disease 2019. INTERVENTIONS None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS The ""confirmed"" and ""suspected"" groups of coronavirus disease 2019 patients had similar characteristics and were more likely to have suffered an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with a respiratory cause (confirmed: 53.7%, suspected coronavirus disease 2019: 56.5%; p = 0.472) than noncoronavirus disease 2019 patients (14.0%; p < 0.001 vs confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 patients). Advanced life support was initiated for 57.5% of the confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 patients, compared with 64.5% of the suspected coronavirus disease 2019 patients (p = 0.149) and 70.6% of the noncoronavirus disease 2019 ones (p = 0.002). The survival rate at 30-day postout-of-hospital cardiac arrest was 0% in the confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 group, 0.9% in the suspected coronavirus disease 2019 group (p = 0.583 vs confirmed), and 3.5% (p = 0.023) in the noncoronavirus disease 2019 group. CONCLUSIONS Our results highlighted a zero survival rate in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients with confirmed coronavirus disease 2019.

Multi-channel ports, such as the SILS port (Covidien, JAPAN), are now available and are crucial for performing single-incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS) or reduced port surgery (RPS). We carried out reduced port distal gastrectomy (RPDG) using a dual-port method with a SILS port. METHODS Ten patients who were diagnosed as early stage gastric cancer were offered the RPDG. Mean age and body mass index (BMI) were 68.1 and 21.4, respectively. No distant metastasis or regional lymph node swelling was seen in any case. A 5-mm flexible scope (Olympus, JAPAN) and SILS port were used and a nylon ligature with a straight needle, instead of a surgical instrument, was available to raise the gastric wall. RESULTS The average operative time was 266.9 ± 38.3 min and blood loss was 37.8 ± 56.8 ml. Patients recovered well and experienced no complications after surgery. All patients could tolerate soft meals on the first day after surgery and the average hospital stay was 8.1 days. Past conventional LAG cases were evaluated to compare the short-term outcome and no difference was seen in the mean operative time or operative blood loss. The length of hospital stay after surgery was shorter for the RPDG group than the conventional operation group (p < 0.0001). Interestingly, the trend of serum CRP elevation after surgery was lower in the RPDG group than the conventional LAG group (p = 0.053). CONCLUSIONS Although the benefits of RPS have not been established, this type of surgery may be expected to have some advantages. Cosmetic benefits and shorter hospital stays are clear advantages. Less invasiveness can be expected according to the trend of serum CRP elevation after RPDG.","Kashiwagi, Hiroyuki; Kumagai, Kenta; Monma, Eiji; Nozue, Mutsumi",Surgical endoscopy,287,1

Attempts to better understand why such attitudes emerge are examined in the context of xenophobic actions during pandemics. Prevailing views suggest that xenophobia ultimately leads to increased stigmatization of those afflicted by disease, which in turn leads to decreased trust in the medical system, resulting in a negative feedback loop.

However, complete recanalization of the occluded vessel cannot be achieved in all patients, leading to poor clinical outcome. We analyzed the reasons for failed recanalization to help direct future improvements in therapy. METHODS 648 consecutive stroke patients with LVO and an MT attempt were retrospectively analyzed for none or minimal recanalization, assessed according to the Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction (TICI) score (0/1). Procedural parameters were evaluated in a standardized approach. Among other variables, number of retrieval attempts, devices, duration of the intervention, and rescue methods were analyzed. RESULTS TICI 0/1 was observed in 72/648 patients (11%). In these patients, the thrombus could not be reached in 21% (n=15/72), was reached but not passed in 21% (n=15/72), and was reached and passed in 58% (n=42/72). Only a minor degree of initial recanalization was achieved in 19% (n=8/42) of patients with a reached occlusion during the course of the intervention. Furthermore, a higher number of passes with a single retriever device led to significant prolongation of the intervention. Therefore, major reasons for failed endovascular recanalization were difficult anatomical access and hard or resistant occlusions that might reflect hard thrombi or pre-existing atherosclerotic stenosis. Procedural complications such as dissection or perforation played a minor role. CONCLUSION In stroke patients with failed MT attempts, approximately 60% of occlusions can be passed. In such cases, rescue therapy might be considered to improve recanalization and clinical outcome. Further development of access devices might help in the remaining cases where the microcatheter could not be manipulated to or through the occlusion.","Leischner, Hannes; Flottmann, Fabian; Hanning, Uta; Broocks, Gabriel; Faizy, Tobias Djamsched; Deb-Chatterji, Milani; Bernhardt, Martina; Brekenfeld, Caspar; Buhk, Jan-Hendrik; Gellissen, Susanne; Thomalla, Götz; Gerloff, Christian; Fiehler, Jens",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,287,17

The identification of ACE2 in as many as 72 tissues suggests that extra-pulmonary invasion and damage is likely, which indeed has already been demonstrated by cardiovascular and gastro-intestinal symptoms. On the other hand, identifying ACE2 dysregulation in patients with co-morbidities may offer insight as to why COVID-19 symptoms are often more severe in these individuals. This may be attributed to a pre-existing pro-inflammatory state that is further propelled with the cytokine storm induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection or the loss of functional ACE2 expression as a result of viral internalization. Here, we aim to characterize the distribution and role of ACE2 in various organs in order to highlight the scope of damage that may arise upon SARS-CoV-2 invasion. Furthermore, by examining the disruption of ACE2 in several co-morbid diseases, we offer insight into potential causes of increased severity of COVID-19 symptoms in certain individuals.

We aimed to evaluate the bacterial and viral etiology of hospitalized CAP cases and compare clinical and laboratory findings of patients with pure bacterial and bacterial and viral (mixed) infections. METHODOLOGY A total of 55 patients hospitalized with CAP were enrolled into the prospective study between February 2010 and December 2010. Clinical and laboratory follow-up were performed on days 0, 7 and 14. Deep tracheal aspiration samples were examined for bacterial and viral pathogens by multiplex PCR, and standard bacteriological culture method. RESULTS The etiological identification rate in 50 patients for bacteria, viruses and mixed virus-bacteria combination by PCR were 62%, 4%, 32%, respectively and 60% in 55 patients by bacterial culture method. Streptococcus pneumoniae concomitant with Haemophilus influenzae (36%) and rhinovirus (16%) was very common, whereas atypical pathogens (only Mycoplasma pneumoniae) were rare (6%). Rhinovirus was the most common viral agent (20%). Recently identified viruses, human coronavirus HKU1 and human bocavirus were not detected except for human metapneumovirus (one case). There was no significant difference in terms of mean age, immune status, leukocyte count, C-reactive protein (CRP) values, hospitalization duration and CURB-65 score between bacterial and mixed viral-bacterial detections. Advanced age (p < 0.01) and higher CURB-65 score (p = 0.01) were found to be associated with increased mortality.

SILENT may occur at any time during lithium treatment. This complication is most frequently observed during routine lithium treatment, with fewer than 10% of cases occurring after accidental or intentional overdoses. SILENT may occur even when lithium plasma levels are within the therapeutic range: 63% of cases had lithium plasma level <2.5 mEq/l (low/mild toxicity). Fever and/or infection were reported in nearly half of the patients (48%). The likelihood of presenting with cerebellar vs. other neurological sequelae was independently increased by elevated plasma lithium level (≥ 2.5 mEq/l) and by a history of fever and/or infection. Lithium users should be warned of the need to consult in case of fever to adjust their lithium dosage.","Verdoux, Hélène; Debruyne, Anne-Laure; Queuille, Emmanuelle; de Leon, Jose",Expert opinion on drug safety,287,1

Modifications were made to accomplish many tasks, including minimizing gross aspiration, isolating a lung, providing a clear facial surgical field during general anesthesia, monitoring laryngeal nerve damage during surgery, preventing airway fires during laser surgery, and administering medications. In critical care management, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is a major concern, as it is associated with increased morbidity, mortality, and cost. It is increasingly appreciated that the ETT itself is a primary causative risk for developing VAP. Unfortunately, contaminated oral and gastric secretions leak down past the inflated ETT cuff into the lung. Bacteria can also grow within the ETT in biofilm and re-enter the lung. Modifications to the ETT that attempt to prevent bacteria from entering around the ETT include maintaining an adequate cuff pressure against the tracheal wall, changing the material and shape of the cuff, and aspirating the secretions that sit above the cuff. Attempts to reduce bacterial entry through the tube include antimicrobial coating of the ETT and mechanically scraping the biofilm from within the ETT. Studies evaluating the effectiveness of these modifications and techniques demonstrate mixed results, and clear recommendations for which modification should be implemented are weak.","Haas, Carl F; Eakin, Richard M; Konkle, Mark A; Blank, Ross",Respiratory care,287,24

Currently, there is limited consensus on weight gain and dysglycaemia development among children using these medications. The objective of this study is to review and synthesise all the available evidence on serotonin-modulating medications and their effects on body mass index (BMI), weight and glycaemic control. METHODS AND ANALYSIS We will conduct a systematic review of all randomised controlled trials evaluating the use of serotonin-modulating medications in the treatment of children 2-17 years with mental health conditions. The outcome measures are BMI, weight and dysglycaemia. We will perform literature searches through Ovid Medline, Ovid Embase, PsycINFO and grey literature resources. Two reviewers from the team will independently screen titles and abstracts, assess the eligibility of full-text trials, extract information from eligible trials and assess the risk of bias and quality of the evidence. Results of this review will be summarised narratively and quantitatively as appropriate. We will perform a multiple treatment comparison using network meta-analysis to estimate the pooled direct, indirect and network estimate for all serotonin-modulating medications on outcomes if adequate data are available. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION Serotonin-modulating medications are widely prescribed for children with mental health diseases and are also used off-label. This network meta-analysis will be the first to assess serotonin modulating antidepressants and their effects on weight and glycaemic control. We anticipate that our results will help physicians and patients make more informed choices while considering the side effect profile. We will disseminate the results of the systematic review and network meta-analysis through peer-reviewed journals.

The published rate of pouch failure is approximately 10% at 10 years, resulting in a growing cohort of patients requiring excision. OBJECTIVE In this article, we aim to describe the indications for excision and postoperative outcomes at our center since 2004. DESIGN This is a retrospective observational study. SETTINGS This study was conducted at a tertiary referral center for ileal pouch dysfunction. Cases were documented from 2004 to 2017. PATIENTS The cohort comprised 92 patients; 83% were diagnosed with ulcerative colitis, 15% with familial adenomatous polyposis, and 2% with indeterminate colitis. INTERVENTIONS Patients underwent excision of pelvic ileal pouches. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The primary outcomes measured were the time to perineal wound healing and healing at 6 months. Thirty- and 90-day morbidity and mortality were evaluated. RESULTS Postoperative histology was consistent with Crohn's disease in 1 patient. The median time from pouch creation to excision was 7 years. The rate of perineal wound healing at 6 months was 78%, and regression analysis demonstrated significantly improved chances of healing for noninfective indications for excision (p = 0.023; OR, 15.22; 95% CI, 1.45-160.27) and for more recent procedures (p = 0.032; OR, 12.00; 95% CI, 1.87-76.87). LIMITATIONS This study was limited because it was retrospective in nature, and it was a single-center experience. CONCLUSIONS This study represents the most contemporary cohort of patients undergoing pouch excision surgery. The procedure retains a relatively high postoperative morbidity, but this study demonstrates a learning curve with improving perineal healing over time associated with a high institutional volume. Defunctioning ileostomy may improve perineal wound healing in patients with infective indications for excision. Further investigation is required to establish the quality-of-life benefits of pouch excision in this modern cohort.

It affects individuals of all ages but occurs most frequently in children and the elderly. Among children, pneumonia is the most common cause of death worldwide. Historically, in developed countries, deaths from pneumonia have been reduced by improvements in living conditions, air quality, and nutrition. In the developing world today, many deaths from pneumonia are also preventable by immunization or access to simple, effective treatments.

This move has been hailed as a positive step towards inclusivity in its attenuation of economic, physical, and legal barriers and effectively enabled many individuals from groups that have traditionally been underrepresented to join and participate. A number of studies have outlined how moving online made it possible to gather a more global community and has increased opportunities for individuals with various constraints, e.g., caregiving responsibilities. Yet, the mere existence of online conferences is no guarantee that everyone can attend and participate meaningfully. In fact, many elements of an online conference are still significant barriers to truly diverse participation: the tools used can be inaccessible for some individuals; the scheduling choices can favour some geographical locations; the set-up of the conference can provide more visibility to well-established researchers and reduce opportunities for early-career researchers. While acknowledging the benefits of an online setting, especially for individuals who have traditionally been underrepresented or excluded, we recognize that fostering social justice requires inclusivity to actively be centered in every aspect of online conference design. Here, we draw from the literature and from our own experiences to identify practices that purposefully encourage a diverse community to attend, participate in, and lead online conferences. Reflecting on how to design more inclusive online events is especially important as multiple scientific organizations have announced that they will continue offering an online version of their event when in-person conferences can resume.","Levitis, Elizabeth; van Praag, Cassandra D Gould; Gau, Rémi; Heunis, Stephan; DuPre, Elizabeth; Kiar, Gregory; Bottenhorn, Katherine L; Glatard, Tristan; Nikolaidis, Aki; Whitaker, Kirstie Jane; Mancini, Matteo; Niso, Guiomar; Afyouni, Soroosh; Alonso-Ortiz, Eva; Appelhoff, Stefan; Arnatkeviciute, Aurina; Atay, Selim Melvin; Auer, Tibor; Baracchini, Giulia; Bayer, Johanna M M; Beauvais, Michael J S; Bijsterbosch, Janine D; Bilgin, Isil P; Bollmann, Saskia; Bollmann, Steffen; Botvinik-Nezer, Rotem; Bright, Molly G; Calhoun, Vince D; Chen, Xiao; Chopra, Sidhant; Chuan-Peng, Hu; Close, Thomas G; Cookson, Savannah L; Craddock, R Cameron; De La Vega, Alejandro; De Leener, Benjamin; Demeter, Damion V; Di Maio, Paola; Dickie, Erin W; Eickhoff, Simon B; Esteban, Oscar; Finc, Karolina; Frigo, Matteo; Ganesan, Saampras; Ganz, Melanie; Garner, Kelly G; Garza-Villarreal, Eduardo A; Gonzalez-Escamilla, Gabriel; Goswami, Rohit; Griffiths, John D; Grootswagers, Tijl; Guay, Samuel; Guest, Olivia; Handwerker, Daniel A; Herholz, Peer; Heuer, Katja; Huijser, Dorien C; Iacovella, Vittorio; Joseph, Michael J E; Karakuzu, Agah; Keator, David B; Kobeleva, Xenia; Kumar, Manoj; Laird, Angela R; Larson-Prior, Linda J; Lautarescu, Alexandra; Lazari, Alberto; Legarreta, Jon Haitz; Li, Xue-Ying; Lv, Jinglei; Mansour L, Sina; Meunier, David; Moraczewski, Dustin; Nandi, Tulika; Nastase, Samuel A; Nau, Matthias; Noble, Stephanie; Norgaard, Martin; Obungoloch, Johnes; Oostenveld, Robert; Orchard, Edwina R; Pinho, Ana Luísa; Poldrack, Russell A; Qiu, Anqi; Raamana, Pradeep Reddy; Rokem, Ariel; Rutherford, Saige; Sharan, Malvika; Shaw, Thomas B; Syeda, Warda T; Testerman, Meghan M; Toro, Roberto; Valk, Sofie L; Van Den Bossche, Sofie; Varoquaux, Gaël; Váša, František; Veldsman, Michele; Vohryzek, Jakub; Wagner, Adina S; Walsh, Reubs J; White, Tonya; Wong, Fu-Te; Xie, Xihe; Yan, Chao-Gan; Yang, Yu-Fang; Yee, Yohan; Zanitti, Gaston E; Van Gulick, Ana E; Duff, Eugene; Maumet, Camille",GigaScience,287,1

We aimed to assess the impact of surgical bowel occlusion around the tumor and intraluminal lavage on the presence of exfoliated malignant cells at anastomosis sites in patients with colon cancer. METHODS In this prospective study, 32 patients with colon cancer, requiring right hemicolectomy between January 2007 and September 2008, were randomly assigned to a control group (no surgical bowel occlusion; 18 patients) and a ""no-touch"" group that underwent surgical bowel occlusion around the tumor before tumor manipulation (14 patients). The fluid used intraoperatively to irrigate the portion of the bowel clamped distal to the tumor was examined cytologically, and exfoliated cells of cytological classes IV and V were considered malignant. RESULTS In the control group, 2 (11.1%) and 10 (55.6%) of 18 patients had exfoliated malignant cells at the terminal ileum and distal colon anastomosis sites, respectively; however, only 1 (7.1%) of the 14 patients in the no-touch group had exfoliated malignant cells at both the sites. The frequency of exfoliated malignant cells at the distal colon anastomosis site was significantly lower in the no-touch group (p = 0.0024). No exfoliated malignant cells were found upon saline irrigation of 400 ml or more in either group. CONCLUSION Measures, such as surgical bowel occlusion around the tumor and intraluminal lavage, can prevent or eliminate exfoliated malignant cells at anastomotic sites in patients with colon cancer.","Hasegawa, Junichi; Nishimura, Junichi; Yamamoto, Shunsuke; Yoshida, Youichirou; Iwase, Kazuhiro; Kawano, Kiyoshi; Nezu, Riichiro",International journal of colorectal disease,287,1

SAMPLE Serum samples and EDTA-treated and heparinized plasma samples from 30 sick cats and 9 healthy client-owned cats and heparinized whole blood samples from 5 healthy purpose-bred cats. PROCEDURES Ability of the assay system to detect 19 recombinant and native immunologically active proteins in plasma and serum samples from healthy and purpose-bred cats was evaluated via spike-and-recovery tests, assessments of inter- and intra-assay variation, linearity results, and leukocyte stimulation. Effects of various concentrations of heparin and serum matrix solution on percentages of analytes recovered were also evaluated. Analyte concentrations in samples from healthy and sick cats were measured and compared between groups. RESULTS Percentages of analytes recovered were unsatisfactory for most assays. Serum and heparinized plasma samples yielded better recovery results than did EDTA-treated plasma samples. Use of serum matrix solution did not improve results. Use of heparin concentrations greater than the recommended range affected the results. Linearity of results was difficult to assess because of the poor recovery. For the analytes that were recovered sufficiently for assessment, linearity appeared to be reasonable despite the limited detection. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE Poor percentages of analytes recovered and adverse effects of sample protein matrix limited the usefulness of the multiplex, bead-based assay system for measurement of immunologically active proteins in solutions with high protein content; however, recovery results were fairly linear, potentially allowing evaluation of feline plasma or serum samples with high analyte concentrations.","Halpin, Rachel E; Saunders, Rebecca S; Thompson, Beverly J; Rohde Newgent, Allison S; Amorim, Juliana; Melillo, Gabrielle N; DeClue, Amy E",American journal of veterinary research,287,33

In Sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries, non-prescribed dispensing of antibiotics in community drug retail outlets (CDROs) has been flagged as one of the contributing factors for the widespread misuse of antibiotics in the community. OBJECTIVE The current review aimed to estimate the proportion of non-prescription antibiotics requests or consultations that resulted in provision of antibiotics without a valid prescription among CDROs in SSA region, and describe the type of antibiotics dispensed. METHODS A literature search was conducted using PubMed, CINAHL, Scopus and Google Scholar. We also searched reference lists of relevant articles. Random effect model meta-analysis was employed to determine the pooled proportion of over the counter sale of antibiotics. Subgroup and meta-regression was undertaken to explore the potential cause of heterogeneity in effect size across studies. RESULTS Of 671 total citations retrieved, 23 met the inclusion criteria (seven cross-sectional questionnaire-based surveys and 16 cross-sectional client-based studies). The overall pooled proportion of non-prescription antibiotics requests or consultations that resulted in supply of antibiotics without prescription was 69% (95% CI 58-80). Upper respiratory tract infections and/or acute diarrhoea were the most frequently presented case scenarios, and amoxicillin and co-trimoxazole were the most frequently dispensed antibiotics to treat those symptoms. CONCLUSIONS Non-prescribed dispensing of antibiotics was found to be a common practice among CDROs in several SSA countries. Ease of access to and overuse of antibiotics can potentially accelerate the emergence of resistance to antibiotics available in the region. Our review highlights the need for a stringent enforcement of existing policies and/or enacting new regulatory frameworks that would regulate antibiotic supply, and training and educational support for pharmacy personnel (e.g. pharmacists, pharmacy assistants) regarding judicious use of antibiotics and the importance of antimicrobial stewardship.","Belachew, Sewunet Admasu; Hall, Lisa; Selvey, Linda A",Antimicrobial resistance and infection control,287,1

Dressings form a key part of ulcer treatment, with clinicians and patients having many different types to choose from. A clear and current overview of current evidence is required to facilitate decision-making regarding dressing use. OBJECTIVES The review aimed to evaluate the effects of foam wound dressings on the healing of foot ulcers in people with diabetes. SEARCH METHODS For this first update we searched the following databases the Cochrane Wounds Group Specialised Register; The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid MEDLINE (In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations); Ovid EMBASE; and EBSCO CINAHL in April 2013. There were no restrictions based on language or date of publication. SELECTION CRITERIA Published or unpublished randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated the effects on ulcer healing of one or more foam wound dressings in the treatment of foot ulcers in people with diabetes. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Two review authors independently performed study selection, risk of bias assessment and data extraction. MAIN RESULTS We included six studies (157 participants) in this review. Meta analysis of two studies indicated that foam dressings do not promote the healing of diabetic foot ulcers compared with basic wound contact dressings (RR 2.03, 95%CI 0.91 to 4.55). Pooled data from two studies comparing foam and alginate dressing found no statistically significant difference in ulcer healing (RR 1.50, 95% CI 0.92 to 2.44). There was no statistically significant difference in the number of diabetic foot ulcers healed when foam dressings were compared with hydrocolloid (matrix) dressings. All included studies were small and/or had limited follow-up times. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS Currently there is no research evidence to suggest that foam wound dressings are more effective in healing foot ulcers in people with diabetes than other types of dressing however all trials in this field are very small. Decision makers may wish to consider aspects such as dressing cost and the wound management properties offered by each dressing type e.g. exudate management.","Dumville, Jo C; Deshpande, Sohan; O'Meara, Susan; Speak, Katharine",The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,287,1

Individuals afflicted with CCA often remain asymptomatic until late stages of disease, resulting in very limited possibilities for therapeutic intervention. The emergence of numerous preclinical models in vitro and in vivo has expanded the tool kit for CCA researchers; nonetheless, how these tools can be best applied to understand CCA biology and accelerate drug development requires further scrutiny. Areas covered: The paper reviews the literature on animal and organoid models of CCA (available through PubMed between September 2020 and January 2021) and examines their investigational role in CCA therapeutics. Finally, the potential of these systems for screening therapeutics to improve CCA patient outcomes is illuminated. Expert Opinion: The expansion of CCA models has yielded a diverse and interesting tool kit for preclinical research. However, investigators should consider which tools are best suited to answer key preclinical questions for real progress.

METHODS We performed a cross-sectional study of 106 air samples collected from 30 ambulances before patient services and 212 air samples collected during patient services to assess the bacterial and fungal counts at the two time points. Additionally, 226 surface swab samples were collected from medical instrument surfaces and the surrounding areas before and after ambulance runs. Groups or genus of isolated bacteria and fungi were preliminarily identified by Gram's stain and lactophenol cotton blue. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, t-test, and Pearson's correlation coefficient with a p-value of less than 0.050 considered significant. RESULTS The mean and standard deviation of bacterial and fungal counts at the start of ambulance runs were 318±485cfu/m(3) and 522±581cfu/m(3), respectively. Bacterial counts during patient services were 468±607cfu/m(3) and fungal counts were 656±612cfu/m(3). Mean bacterial and fungal counts during patient services were significantly higher than those at the start of ambulance runs, p=0.005 and p=0.030, respectively. For surface contamination, the overall bacterial counts before and after patient services were 0.8±0.7cfu/cm(2) and 1.3±1.1cfu/cm(2), respectively (p<0.001). The predominant isolated bacteria and fungi were Staphylococcus spp. and Aspergillus spp., respectively. Additionally, there was a significantly positive correlation between bacterial (r=0.3, p<0.010) and fungal counts (r=0.2, p=0.020) in air samples and bacterial counts on medical instruments and allocated areas. CONCLUSIONS This study revealed high microbial contamination (bacterial and fungal) in ambulance air during services and higher bacterial contamination on medical instrument surfaces and allocated areas after ambulance services compared to the start of ambulance runs. Additionally, bacterial and fungal counts in ambulance air showed a significantly positive correlation with the bacterial surface contamination on medical instruments and allocated areas. Further studies should be conducted to determine the optimal intervention to reduce microbial contamination in the ambulance environment.","Luksamijarulkul, Pipat; Pipitsangjan, Sirikun",Oman medical journal,287,13

We systematically evaluated the geographical variations of ACLF across the world in terms of prevalence, mortality, aetiology of chronic liver disease (CLD), triggers and organ failures. METHODS We searched EMBASE and PubMed from 3/1/2013 to 7/3/2020 using the ACLF-EASL-CLIF (European Association for the Study of the Liver-Chronic Liver Failure) criteria. Two investigators independently conducted the abstract selection/abstraction of the aetiology of CLD, triggers, organ failures and prevalence/mortality by presence/grade of ACLF. We grouped countries into Europe, East/South Asia and North/South America. We calculated the pooled proportions, evaluated the methodological quality using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale and statistical heterogeneity, and performed sensitivity analyses. RESULTS We identified 2369 studies; 30 cohort studies met our inclusion criteria (43 206 patients with ACLF and 140 835 without ACLF). The global prevalence of ACLF among patients admitted with decompensated cirrhosis was 35% (95% CI 33% to 38%), highest in South Asia at 65%. The global 90-day mortality was 58% (95% CI 51% to 64%), highest in South America at 73%. Alcohol was the most frequently reported aetiology of underlying CLD (45%, 95% CI 41 to 50). Infection was the most frequent trigger (35%) and kidney dysfunction the most common organ failure (49%). Sensitivity analyses showed regional estimates grossly unchanged for high-quality studies. Type of design, country health index, underlying CLD and triggers explained the variation in estimates. CONCLUSIONS The global prevalence and mortality of ACLF are high. Region-specific variations could be explained by the type of triggers/aetiology of CLD or grade. Health systems will need to tailor early recognition and treatment of ACLF based on region-specific data.","Mezzano, Gabriel; Juanola, Adria; Cardenas, Andres; Mezey, Esteban; Hamilton, James P; Pose, Elisa; Graupera, Isabel; Ginès, Pere; Solà, Elsa; Hernaez, Ruben",Gut,287,15

Excessive neutrophil activity associates with hyperinflammation and tissue damage during pathologies such as inflammatory bowel disease, diabetes mellitus, tuberculosis and COVID-19. Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) can modulate immune cells, including neutrophils, functions, therefore, nAChR ligands are considered as the potent agents for therapy of inflammation. Earlier it was shown, that about 30% of PMNs from the acute inflammatory site responded to nicotine by calcium spikes. In this work, we studied the generation of calcium spikes in murine granulocytes with different maturity level (evaluated by Gr-1 expression) isolated from bone marrow in response to ligands of nAChRs in control and under chronic nicotine consumption. It was found that nearly 20-25% cells in the granulocyte population responded to nicotine or selective antagonists of different type of nAChRs (α-cobratoxin, GIC and Vc1.1). We demonstrated that in the control group Ca2+ -mobilizing activity was regulated through α7 and α9α10 nAChRs in immature granulocytes (Gr-1int ), whereas in mature granulocytes (Gr-1hi ) it was regulated through α7, α3β2 and α9-contained nAChRs. Sensitivity of PMNs to nicotine depended on their maturity level after chronic nicotine consumption. Gr-1int cells responded to nicotine through α7 and α9-contained nAChRs, while Gr-1hi did not respond to nicotine. Thus, calcium response to nAChR ligands in bone marrow PMNs depends on their maturity level. This article is protected by copyright.

We postulated that treatment success depended on the size of the aneurysm ostium or defect in the parent artery. MATERIALS AND METHODS Flow diverter expansion and deformation were studied in silicone tubes with wall apertures of various sizes. Large and giant canine sidewall aneurysms, featuring a branch located immediately opposite the aneurysm, and a smaller 6- to 8-mm (group A, n = 6) or a larger 10- to 16-mm (group B, n = 6) ostium were created to study the effects of ostium size on aneurysm or branch occlusion by flow diverters. Angiographic results after deployment and at 3 months were scored by using an ordinal scale. The amount of neointima formation on the segment of the device overlying the aneurysm or the branch ostia was determined by specimen photography. RESULTS The fusiform deformation of flow diverters was maximal with larger defects in silicone tubes. At 3 months, group B aneurysms showed worse angiographic results than group A aneurysms, with larger residual aneurysm volumes (P = .002). Neointimal coverage of the aneurysm ostia was more complete in group A compared with group B (P = .002). CONCLUSIONS The effects of flow diversion may vary with the size of the aneurysm ostium.","Gentric, J C; Darsaut, T E; Makoyeva, A; Salazkin, I; Raymond, J",AJNR.

However, the classic laparoscopic approach requires five to seven incisions for multiple trocar placement. Recently, single incision laparoscopic surgery has been adopted for performing appendectomies, cholecystectomies, sleeve gastrectomies, and adjustable gastric band surgeries. Here, we described the first case of a patient receiving laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass through a single transumbilical incision. The operative time was 170 min. There were no intra-operative complications; the patient did very well postoperatively and was discharged 2 days later. Single incision laparoscopic surgery has been viewed as an alternative to natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery. When performed via the transumbilical route, it can make the abdominal wound scarless and cosmetically more acceptable.","Huang, Chih-Kun; Houng, Jer-Yiing; Chiang, Chen-Ju; Chen, Yaw-Sen; Lee, Po-Huang",Obesity surgery,287,1

However, the efficacy of recanalization therapy for BAO has not been established as yet. OBJECTIVE We analyzed consecutive cases of BAO treated with mechanical thrombectomy (MT) to evaluate its safety and efficacy and to determine factors associated with the prognosis. METHODS Between October 2011 and September 2016, MT was performed in 34 patients with BAO. MT was performed using the Penumbra system and stent retriever. CT perfusion was used for evaluating patients. Cerebral blood flow (CBF) maps and cerebral blood volume (CBV) maps were evaluated. CBF/CBV mismatch was defined as ≥50% penumbra. Clinical outcomes were correlated with demographic, clinical, and radiographic findings. RESULTS The median baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score was 29 (14-33). The recanalization rate (≥thrombolysis in cerebral infarction grades 2b) was 100%. The median onset to recanalization time (OTR) was 197 (160-256) min. Favorable outcomes (modified Rankin Scale ≤2) at 90 days occurred in 56% (n = 19 of 34). The mortality rate at 90 days was 12% (n = 4 of 34). In univariate analysis, intravenous (IV) recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA) use, and OTR were significantly associated with favorable outcomes. In a multivariate logistic regression model, IV rt-PA use and lower National Institute of Health Stroke Scale score were significantly related to favorable outcomes. Conclusion and Relevance: Multimodal endovascular therapy using the Penumbra system and stent retriever demonstrated a high recanalization rate and favorable outcomes for BAO. Both devices were feasible and effective in the treatment of BAO. An approach combining MT with IV thrombolysis provided a better recanalization rate and more favorable clinical outcomes.","Uno, Junji; Kameda, Katsuharu; Otsuji, Ryosuke; Ren, Nice; Nagaoka, Shintaro; Maeda, Kazushi; Ikai, Yoshiaki; Gi, Hidefuku",Cerebrovascular diseases,287,1

We investigated the effect of Sanguinate™ (SG), a PEGylated carboxyhemoglobin (COHb) gas transfer agent, on changes in collateral and reperfusion cerebral blood flow and brain injury in SHR during 2 h of MCAO. SG (8 mL/kg) or vehicle ( n = 6-8/group) was infused i.v. after 30 or 90 min of ischemia with 2 h reperfusion. Multi-site laser Doppler probes simultaneously measured changes in core MCA and collateral flow during ischemia and reperfusion using a validated method. Brain injury was measured using TTC. Animals were anesthetized with choral hydrate. Collateral flow changed little in vehicle-treated SHR during ischemia (-8 ± 9% vs. prior to infusion) whereas flow increased in SG-treated animals (29 ± 10%; p < 0.05). In addition, SG improved reperfusion regardless of time of treatment; however, brain injury was smaller only with early treatment in SHR vs. vehicle (28.8 ± 3.2% vs. 18.8 ± 2.3%; p < 0.05). Limited collateral flow in SHR during MCAO is consistent with small penumbra and large infarction. The ability to increase collateral flow in SHR with SG suggests that this compound may be useful as an adjunct to endovascular therapy and extend the time window for treatment.","Cipolla, Marilyn J; Linfante, Italo; Abuchowski, Abe; Jubin, Ronald; Chan, Siu-Lung",Journal of cerebral blood flow and metabolism : official journal of the International Society of Cerebral Blood Flow and Metabolism,287,16

In this study, the treatments and outcomes in 40 pediatric patients diagnosed with COVID-19 and treated with different drugs were evaluated. METHODOLOGY All cases were diagnosed with COVID-19 nucleic acid positive by using RT-PCR or clinical manifestations, imaging specific characteristics and epidemiological clinical diagnosis. The biological information and first symptom of all cases were collect. A variety of treatments were employed and the outcomes were evaluated by Cox regression analysis. Multivariable analysis was performed to evaluate cure rate at 14 days with different drug treatment. RESULTS The average length of hospital stay was 10.4 days. The cure rate was increased with the treatment time extended and 90% of pediatric patients were cured and discharged after 14 days' treatment. And multivariable analysis results proved that none of the covariates were related to the cure rate at 14 days with different drug treatment since p values were over 0.05. CONCLUSIONS Multivariable analysis suggested that the present drug treatments cannot significantly shorten the clinical cure time and improve the cure rate of children with COVID-19.","Li, Mengting; Wang, Yang; Xu, Hua; Liu, Changlin; Shi, Liang; Ye, Qi; Wang, Jun; Li, Sichan; Mei, Yan; Gao, Liuliu",Journal of infection in developing countries,287,1

However, it remained enigmatic how to rationally control their viscosity sensitivity, thus limiting their application. Herein, we resolve this problem by chemically installing extended π-rich alternating carbon-carbon linkage between the rotational electron donor and acceptor of RBFs. Our data reveal that the length of π-rich linkage strongly influences the viscosity sensitivity, likely resulted from varying height of the energy barriers between the fluorescent planar and the dark twisted configurations. This mechanism allows for the design of three scaffolds of RBF derivatives that span a wide range of viscosity sensitivities. Application of these RBFs is demonstrated by a dual-color imaging strategy that can differentiate misfolded protein oligomers and insoluble aggregates both in test tubes and live cells. Beyond RBFs, we envision that this chemical mechanism might be generally applicable to a wide range of photoisomerizable and aggregation-induced emission fluorophores.","Ye, Songtao; Zhang, Han; Fei, Jinyu; Wolstenholme, Charles H; Zhang, Xin",Angewandte Chemie,287,16

AAAE posits that (a) age-related cognitive, motivational, and physical changes fundamentally change the appraisal system in certain ways, and that (b) older adults often deploy appraisal processes in different ways relative to their younger counterparts. As such, we hypothesize that these age-related changes to the appraisal process underlie the finding that older and younger adults tend to experience different emotions. In this paper we integrate findings from the aging literature with appraisal theory, grounding AAAE in theoretical and empirical work relevant to the relationship between aging and appraisal processes. Using our theoretical framework, it is possible to identify critical points of investigation for aging and emotion researchers to further develop our understanding of the proximal-level determinants of age differences in emotion.","Young, Nathaniel A; Minton, Alyssa R; Mikels, Joseph A",Developmental review : DR,287,1

Although hypertension prevalence is well documented at national and state levels, less is known about rural-urban variation and county-level prevalence. To examine prevalence of self-reported hypertension and antihypertensive medication use by rural-urban classification and county, CDC analyzed data reported by 442,641 adults aged ≥18 years who participated in the 2017 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS). In rural (noncore) areas, 40.0% (unadjusted prevalence) of adults reported having hypertension, whereas in the most urban (large central metro) areas, 29.4% reported having hypertension. Age-standardized hypertension prevalence was significantly higher in the most rural areas, compared with the most urban areas within nearly all categories of age, sex, and other demographic characteristics. Model-based hypertension prevalence across counties ranged from 18.0% to 55.0% and was highest in Southeastern* and Appalachian† counties. Model-based county-level prevalence of antihypertensive medication use among adults with hypertension ranged from 54.3% to 84.7%. Medication use also was higher in rural areas compared with use in most urban areas, with prevalence highest in Southeastern and Appalachian counties as well as counties in the Dakotas and Nebraska. CDC is working with states to enhance hypertension awareness and management through a strategy of team-based care that involves physicians, nurses, pharmacists, dietitians, and community health workers. The increased use of telemedicine to support this strategy might improve access to care among underserved populations.","Samanic, Claudine M; Barbour, Kamil E; Liu, Yong; Wang, Yan; Fang, Jing; Lu, Hua; Schieb, Linda; Greenlund, Kurt J",MMWR.

We propose that the Endotrol(®) ETT may be an effective tool to facilitate video laryngoscope-assisted orotracheal intubation without the use of a stylet. After obtaining written and oral informed consent, 60-adult patients scheduled for elective surgery requiring general anesthesia with orotracheal intubation were enrolled. Patients were randomized, respectively, to 1 of 4 groups: Group A(1), (15 patients): McGrath(®) with Endotrol(®) ETT; Group A(2), (15 patients): McGrath(®) with GlideRite(®)-styletted standard ETT; Group B(1), (15 patients): GlideScope(®) with Endotrol(®) ETT; Group B(2), (15 patients): GlideScope(®) with GlideRite(®)-styletted standard ETT. Statistical analysis was performed with Stata (Stata Corp v10, College Station). Mean time to intubation was longer in the Endotrol(®) groups compared to the GlideRite(®) groups: 60.1 (31.6) vs. 44.4 (27.6) s (p < 0.05). It was subjectively more difficult to intubate using the Endotrol(®) than with a GlideRite(®)-styletted ETT (difficulty score median [range] 2 [1-5] vs. 1 [1-3], respectively). Three intubations using the Endotrol(®) were characterized as difficult, whereas there were no difficult intubations with the GlideRite(®)stylet. The Endotrol(®) ETT, as compared to a standard ETT with a non-malleable stylet, is associated with longer intubation times and a subjective increase in difficulty of use. It may, however, still be a clinically viable alternative in video laryngoscope-assisted orotracheal intubation when use of a rigid stylet is undesirable.","Cattano, Davide; Artime, Carlos; Maddukuri, Vineela; Daily, William H; Altamirano, Alfonso; Normand, Katherine C; Gilmore, Clarence E; Hagberg, Carin A",Internal and emergency medicine,287,27

The aim of this study was to evaluate of an institutional policy of EGD observation time on the detection rate of UGI neoplasms. METHODS From July 2017 to March 2019, all endoscopists were requested to adhere to our institutional policy of spending more than 3 minutes of observation time in every screening EGD. Observation time was defined as the time from when the endoscope reached the duodenum to when it was withdrawn. We obtained neoplasm detection rate (NDR) during this period, which was compared with that of baseline period from 2009 to 2015. RESULTS During the study period, 30,506 EGDs were performed. The age of subjects was 49.9 ± 10.5 years, and 56.5% were male. All endoscopists achieved the average EGD observation time more than 3 minutes during this period. Mean observation time was 3:35 ± 0:50, which was significantly longer than that of baseline (2:38 ± 0:21, P<0.001). NDR was 0.33%, which was higher than that of baseline (0.23%, P<0.001). Even after adjusting for subjects' age and gender, smoking history, and endoscopists' biopsy rate, prolonged EGD observation time more than 3 minutes increased NDR of UGI neoplasms (odds ratio, 1.51; 95% CI, 1.21 -1.75). CONCLUSIONS This study provides evidence that implementing a protocol of a prolonged observation time could increase NDR.

We aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of robotic reoperative ARS in comparison with primary robotic ARS. METHODS A retrospective review of patients undergoing primary or reoperative robotic ARS at a tertiary referral center between 2012 and 2017 was performed. Perioperative outcomes and long-term symptom resolution were evaluated. RESULTS A total of 200 patients were included (38 reoperative and 162 primary ARS). Baseline characteristics were comparable across groups. Seven (18.4%) of the reoperative patients had two or more prior foregut operations. Patients in the reoperative group had a longer operative time (226 vs. 180 min, p < 0.001). There were no conversions to open technique, and one patient in the reoperative group (2.6%) had an intraoperative perforation. Twenty of the 38 reoperative patients (52.6%) were discharged within 24 h as compared to 109/162 primary patients (64.9%) (p = 0.09). The readmission rate and postoperative complication rates were 6 and 3%, respectively, and did not differ between groups. At a mean follow-up of 1 year, complete or partial resolution of preoperative symptoms was achieved in 97% of primary patients and 100% of reoperative patients (p = 0.4).

A variety of methods have been tested in the attempt to prevent POPF, most of them without convincing results. METHODS A systematic literature search was conducted in PubMed, Embase and the Cochrane Library to identify clinical studies comparing pancreatic stump closure with the addition of Tachosil(®) to conventional stump closure. The identified studies were critically appraised, and meta-analyses were performed using a random-effects model. Dichotomous data were pooled using odds ratios, and weighted mean differences were calculated for continuous outcomes, together with the corresponding 95 % confidence intervals. RESULTS Four studies (two randomised controlled trials and two retrospective clinical studies) reporting data from 738 patients were included in the meta-analysis. Overall POPF, clinically-relevant POPF, mortality, reoperations, intraoperative blood loss and length of hospital stay did not differ significantly between conventional closure and additional covering of the pancreatic stump with Tachosil(®). A sensitivity analysis of only randomised controlled trials confirmed the results. CONCLUSIONS The application of Tachosil(®) to the pancreatic stump after distal pancreatectomy is a safe procedure but provides no relevant benefit in terms of POPF, mortality, reoperation rate, blood loss or length of hospital stay. Future research should concentrate on novel methods of pancreatic stump closure to prevent POPF after distal pancreatectomy.","Hüttner, Felix J; Mihaljevic, André L; Hackert, Thilo; Ulrich, Alexis; Büchler, Markus W; Diener, Markus K",Langenbeck's archives of surgery,287,1

OBJECTIVE The objective of work is to establish the inhibitory potential of nicotiflorin, a Kaempferol 3-O-rutinoside flavonoid, against the deadly coronavirus (COVID-19) 6W63 (main protease 3Clpro protein) , using molecular docking approach. METHOD The Molegro Virtual Docker software (MVD) with a 30 Å grid resolution was used. The structure was drawn by Chem 3D software and energy minimization was done by the MM2 force field. The protein 6W63 was downloaded from the protein data bank. Molegro modeller was used for score calculations. RESULT The molecular docking studies were carried out on nicotiflorin and standard inhibitor X77, where standard inhibitor was observed in a co-crystallized state with main protease 3Clpro protein 6W63.

Consequently, institutional surveillance of cleft concepts is essential. In addition to subjective expert rankings, three-dimensional (3D) photogrammetry of the face has become the gold standard for evaluation and objective assessment of facial structures. We evaluated cleft configuration preoperatively to determine the influence thereof on the long-term facial appearance/averageness of unilateral cleft lip patients. Methods: Plaster models of the patient's labio-oral region and nose were made preoperatively, digitized, and cleft configuration assessed (cleft width, cleft-columella angle, nasal projection, heminasal width ratio, transverse lip length, labial height). Between 4 and 12 years after surgery, stereophotogrammetry (3D face scans) were captured to determine the patients' individual facial averageness index (FAI) as a deviation from the population mean, using proportion indices (PIs) of facial landmarks and reference data provided by Farkas and FaceBase. Results: Cleft width (r = 0.77) and columella length correlated strongly with long-term facial averageness (r = 0.52). Decreasing FAI was seen with increasing patient age (r = -0.42), indicating increasing facial averageness. Other cleft properties showed weaker correlations. Cleft alveolus did not have any impact on FAI. Conclusions: The presented method allows objective measurement of facial appearance/averageness as well as preoperative cleft properties. It might be superior to subjective assessments of facial attractiveness/appearance. Objective cleft measurements are strong predictors for future facial averageness. Increasing averageness with growth and age suggests late corrective surgery.","Neuhaus, Michael-Tobias; Zimmerer, Rüdiger; Zeller, Alexander-Nicolai; Jehn, Philipp; Gellrich, Nils-Claudius; Tavassol, Frank",Facial plastic surgery & aesthetic medicine,287,1

Whilst patients might desire spiritual care and value the opportunities that nurses take to engage with them to meet their spiritual needs, research suggests that nurses do not consistently engage in spiritual care with their patients. To identify instruments available to nurses to assess spirituality in different patient groups and highlight the characteristics and psychometric properties of these instruments. METHOD A narrative literature review of the relevant literature published after 2008 was carried out in CINAHL, PsycINFO, MEDLINE and Google scholar databases in October 2020. Narrative review synthesized key findings and grouped instruments into macro areas by content. RESULTS After the screening, based on inclusion criteria, 31 articles were identified. 17 instruments were identified and divided into 4 macro areas: wellbeing (N = 4), attitude (N = 5) needs (N =6) and multiple domains (N = 2). CONCLUSIONS This review enables an increased awareness of the variety of instruments available to aid spiritual care and therefore increase their use within nurse clinical practice. The widening of the patient group to be considered (i.e., non-oncological) may have a significant impact on the practice, causing professionals to reflect on the necessity to investigate spiritual needs even at an early stage of a disease process. Future studies should aim to test reliability and validity of existing instruments rather than develop further ones.","Cosentino, Chiara; Harrad, Rachel A; Sulla, Francesco; Bertuol, Maria; Sarli, Leopoldo; Artioli, Giovanna",Acta bio-medica : Atenei Parmensis,287,1

Individual factors, such as intolerance of uncertainty, may impact risk for ED pathology and CE in response to COVID-19 anxiety. The current study examined associations between COVID-19 anxiety, trait intolerance of uncertainty, and COVID-19 intolerance of uncertainty and ED pathology and compulsive exercise. METHOD Undergraduate participants (N = 295) completed a series of online questionnaires between March and April of 2020. RESULTS COVID-19 anxiety and intolerance of uncertainty were associated with ED pathology, but not compulsive exercise. Additionally, both trait and COVID-19 intolerance of uncertainty moderated associations between COVID-19 anxiety and compulsive exercise and ED pathology. COVID-19 anxiety was more strongly related to compulsive exercise and ED pathology for individuals with lower intolerance of uncertainty. DISCUSSION COVID-19 anxiety may increase risk for ED pathology and may be specifically important in determining risk for ED pathology and compulsive exercise among individuals with lower intolerance of uncertainty. These results contribute to a growing body of research aimed at understanding the mental health consequences of the COVID-19 and suggest that individual factors (e.g., anxiety and intolerance of uncertainty) are important in determining risk for ED pathology and compulsive exercise in the context of the pandemic.","Scharmer, Christina; Martinez, Kimberly; Gorrell, Sasha; Reilly, Erin E; Donahue, Joseph M; Anderson, Drew A",The International journal of eating disorders,287,16

The port placement described for Si can be used for standard and S robotic systems. This is the first report in the literature on the use of the da Vinci Xi robotic platform for RNU. PATIENTS AND METHODS After a substantial experience of RNU using different da Vinci robots from the standard to the Si platform in a single-docking fashion for benign and malignant conditions, we started using the newly released da Vinci Xi robot since 2014. The most important differences are in port placement and effective use of the features of da Vinci Xi robot while performing simultaneous upper and lower tract surgery. Patient positioning, port placement, step-by-step technique of single docking RNU-LND-BCE using the da Vinci Si and da Vinci Xi robot are shown in an accompanying video with the goal that centres using either robotic system benefit from the hints and tips. The first segment of video describes RNU-LND-BCE using the da Vinci Si followed by the da Vinci Xi to highlight differences. There was no need for patient repositioning or robot re-docking with the new da Vinci Xi robotic platform. RESULTS We have experience of using different robotic systems for single docking RNU in 70 cases for benign (15) and malignant (55) conditions. The da Vinci Xi robotic platform helps operating room personnel in its easy movement, allows easier patient side-docking with the help of its boom feature, in addition to easy and swift movements of the robotic arms. The patient clearance feature can be used to avoid collision with the robotic arms or the patient's body. In patients with challenging body habitus and in situations where bladder cuff management is difficult, modifications can be made through reassigning the camera to a different port with utilisation of the retargeting feature of the da Vinci Xi when working on the bladder cuff or in the pelvis. The vision of the camera used for da Vinci Xi was initially felt to be inferior to that of the da Vinci Si; however, with a subsequent software upgrade this was much improved. The base of the da Vinci Xi is bigger, which does not slide and occasionally requires a change in table placement/operating room setup, and requires side-docking especially when dealing with very tall and obese patients for pelvic surgery. CONCLUSIONS RNU alone or with LND-BCE is a challenging surgical procedure that addresses the upper and lower urinary tract simultaneously. Single docking and single robotic port placement for RNU-LND-BCE has evolved with the development of different generations of the robotic system. These procedures can be performed safely and effectively using the da Vinci S, Si or Xi robotic platform. The new da Vinci Xi robotic platform is more user-friendly, has easy installation, and is intuitive for surgeons using its features.","Patel, Manish N; Aboumohamed, Ahmed; Hemal, Ashok",BJU international,287,16

In this paper, we review their operative principles, limitations, and utility in an integrated approach that could potentially change patients' outcome.

Because they are not chemically bound to these products and are widely used, the potential for environmental contamination is significant. Phthalates and their metabolites have been associated with endocrine disruption and reproductive impairment, among other adverse health effects, in laboratory animals and human epidemiologic studies. Common bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) are vulnerable to environmental pollutants due to their apex position in the food chain, long life spans, and habitat overlap with developed coastal areas. The objective of this study was to quantify phthalate metabolite concentrations in urine collected from bottlenose dolphins in Sarasota Bay, Florida, during May 2016 (n = 7) and May 2017 (n = 10). Screening of nine phthalate monoester metabolites in bottlenose dolphin urine was performed by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry using methods adapted from those used for analyzing human samples. At least one phthalate metabolite was detected in 71% of the dolphins sampled across both years, with the highest concentrations detected for monoethyl phthalate (MEP; GM = 5.4 ng/ml; 95%CI: 1.3-22.0 ng/ml) and mono-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (MEHP; GM = 1.9 ng/ml; 95%CI: 1.1-3.2 ng/ml). These data demonstrate exposure to two of the most commonly used phthalates in commercial manufacturing, diethyl phthalate (DEP) and di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP). This study establishes methods for urinary detection of phthalate metabolites in marine mammals and provides baseline data to address a significant and growing, yet poorly understood, health threat to marine wildlife.","Hart, Leslie B; Beckingham, Barbara; Wells, Randall S; Alten Flagg, Moriah; Wischusen, Kerry; Moors, Amanda; Kucklick, John; Pisarski, Emily; Wirth, Ed",GeoHealth,287,25

These three viruses, in addition to two older CoV zoonoses (HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63) are believed to be originally derived from wild bat reservoir species. We review the molecular biology of the bat-derived Alpha- and Betacoronavirus genera, highlighting features that contribute to their potential for cross-species emergence, including the use of well-conserved mammalian host cell machinery for cell entry and a unique capacity for adaptation to novel host environments after host switching. The adaptive capacity of coronaviruses largely results from their large genomes, which reduce the risk of deleterious mutational errors and facilitate range-expanding recombination events by offering heightened redundancy in essential genetic material. Large CoV genomes are made possible by the unique proofreading capacity encoded for their RNA-dependent polymerase. We find that bat-borne SARS-related coronaviruses in the subgenus Sarbecovirus, the source clade for SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, present a particularly poignant pandemic threat, due to the extraordinary viral genetic diversity represented among several sympatric species of their horseshoe bat hosts. To date, Sarbecovirus surveillance has been almost entirely restricted to China. More vigorous field research efforts tracking the circulation of Sarbecoviruses specifically and Betacoronaviruses more generally is needed across a broader global range if we are to avoid future repeats of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Ravelomanantsoa, Ny Anjara Fifi; Guth, Sarah; Andrianiaina, Angelo; Andry, Santino; Gentles, Anecia; Ranaivoson, Hafaliana Christian; Brook, Cara E",Emerging topics in life sciences,287,17

This study explores the characteristics and uses of the medial sural artery perforator flap along with postoperative outcomes and complications. METHODS A systematic literature review was performed using PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials to identify all cases of medial sural artery perforator flap reconstruction. Descriptive and meta-analyses were performed on pooled outcomes. Multivariate logistic regression identified factors associated with increased complication rates. RESULTS Thirty-five studies encompassing 526 medial sural artery perforator flaps were included for analysis. The most common reasons for surgery were oncologic (47.6 percent) and traumatic injuries (31.8 percent). The oral cavity was the most common recipient location (45.5 percent). Average flap dimensions were 6.0 ± 2.3 cm × 9.8 ± 3.6 cm, with an average pedicle length of 10.1 ± 6.6 cm. Meta-analysis revealed an overall complication rate of 14.3 percent (Q value = 22.16; p = 0.877; I(2)= -39.9). Use of chimeric medial sural artery perforator flaps was associated with significantly higher rates of complications (OR, 3.92; p = 0.039; 95 percent CI, 1.10 to 13.89). The majority of flap donor sites were closed primarily (68 percent) versus 32 percent that were covered with split-thickness skin grafts. A flap width greater than 5.75 cm had an odds ratio of 5.3 (95 percent CI, 1.3 to 21.8; p = 0.014) of having a donor-site complication if closed primarily. CONCLUSIONS The medial sural artery perforator flap offers thin, pliable tissue with a relatively long pedicle and has minimal donor-site morbidity when the donor site is managed appropriately. As such, it should be considered a workhorse flap for both head and neck and extremity reconstruction.","Daar, David A; Abdou, Salma A; Cohen, Joshua M; Wilson, Stelios C; Levine, Jamie P",Plastic and reconstructive surgery,287,1

We evaluated the feasibility and efficacy of laparoscopic intersphincteric resection for low rectal cancer. METHOD From 1990 to 2007, patients with rectal tumour below 6 cm from the anal verge and treated by open or laparoscopic curative intersphincteric resection were included in a retrospective comparative study. Surgery included total mesorectal excision with internal sphincter excision and protected low coloanal anastomosis. Neoadjuvant treatment was given to patients with T3 or N+ tumours. Recurrence and survival were evaluated by the Kaplan-Meier method and compared using the Logrank test. Function was assessed using the Wexner continence score. RESULTS Intersphincteric resection was performed in 175 patients with low rectal cancer: 110 had laparoscopy and 65 had open surgery. The two groups were similar according to age, sex, body mass index, ASA score, tumour stage and preoperative radiotherapy. Postoperative mortality (zero) and morbidity (23%vs 28%; P = 0.410) were similar in both groups. There was no difference in 5-year local recurrence (5%vs 2%; P = 0.349) and 5-year disease-free survival (70%vs 71%; P = 0.862). Function and continence scores (11 vs 12; P = 0.675) were similar in both groups. CONCLUSION Intersphincteric resection did not alter long-term tumour control of low rectal cancer. The safety and efficacy of the laparoscopic approach for intersphincteric resection are suggested by a similar short- and long-term outcome as obtained by open surgery.","Laurent, C; Paumet, T; Leblanc, F; Denost, Q; Rullier, E",Colorectal disease : the official journal of the Association of Coloproctology of Great Britain and Ireland,287,1

The most frequent pathogens are Trichophyton (T.) rubrum and T. mentagrophytes. In addition to local therapy, first-line treatment includes terbinafine, an allylamine antifungal agent that acts by inhibiting squalene epoxidase and thus interfering with ergosterol synthesis. In refractory cases, terbinafine resistance due to point mutation in the squalene epoxidase gene has been frequently detected. OBJECTIVES The aim is to present specific aspects in the epidemiology of dermatophytoses with terbinafine resistance and to illustrate them on the basis of four patient cases including diagnostic procedures. MATERIALS AND METHODS A review of handbook knowledge, a selective literature search, and a review of four patient cases were performed. RESULTS Detection of the terbinafine resistance was performed by in vitro testing using the breakpoint method as well as sequencing of the Trichophyton isolate and detection of the point mutation with amino acid substitution at position L393F or F397L of squalene epoxidase. CONCLUSION In refractory and recurrent dermatophytoses, terbinafine resistance should be considered, especially in T. mentagrophytes and T. rubrum, and in vitro resistance testing of the dermatophyte and point mutation analysis of squalene epoxidase (SQLE) should be performed. Therapeutically, intermittent administration of itraconazole in combination with antifungal local therapy is recommended. Nevertheless, a recurrent course is to be expected and long-term therapy with itraconazole is usually necessary.","Appelt, L; Nenoff, P; Uhrlaß, S; Krüger, C; Kühn, P; Eichhorn, K; Buder, S; Beissert, S; Abraham, S; Aschoff, R; Bauer, A","Der Hautarzt; Zeitschrift fur Dermatologie, Venerologie, und verwandte Gebiete",287,31

On 30-31 January 2020, the protocol and reagents for these assays were distributed to local public health institutes and quarantine depots in Japan, and nationwide, SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic testing was started. For further validation, the assays were compared with the commercially available kits using SARS CoV-2 viral RNA and the clinical specimens obtained from COVID19-suspected individuals. The LightMix Modular SARS and Wuhan CoV E-gene (LN S&W-E) assay was highly sensitive for SARS-CoV-2, as was the N2 set, and both assays had perfectly consistent results with the clinical specimens. While the LM S&W-E set targets the highly conserved region of the E gene in SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, the N2 set was designed to target the unique region in the SARS-CoV-2 N gene.

In Brazil, considerable improvements in social inclusion have fostered the emergence of hundreds of thousands of first-time fliers over the past decades. We apply a two-step regression methodology in which the first step consists of identifying air transport markets characterized by greater social inclusion, using indicators of the local economies' income distribution, credit availability, and access to the Internet. In the second step, we inspect the drivers of the plunge in air travel demand since the pandemic began, differentiating markets by their predicted social inclusion intensity. After controlling for potential endogeneity stemming from the spread of COVID-19 through air travel, our results suggest that short and low-density routes are among the most impacted airline markets and that business-oriented routes are more impacted than leisure ones. Finally, we estimate that a market with 1 per cent higher social inclusion is associated with a 0.153 per cent to 0.166 per cent more pronounced decline in demand during the pandemic. Therefore, markets that have benefited from greater social inclusion in the country may be the most vulnerable to the current crisis.","Santos, Luca J.; Oliveira, Alessandro V.

Providers of pre-service education have made pragmatic adaptations to course provision, including adopting the practice of ‘remote’ visits to schools to assess pre-service teachers during practicum and to meet and discuss the pre-service teachers’ practice with school-based mentors. Taking the form of a case study, this paper explores the views of University Tutors in relation to the impact of the use of remote school visits on the training experience. Seven University Tutors from a university in the North West of England delivering a Secondary Postgraduate Certificate in Education Course with Qualified Teacher Status responded to the invitation to participate. The data, gathered from written statements from participants, highlights that changing practices have seen increased opportunities for developing pre-service teachers’ autonomy and reflective practice and opportunities for University Tutors to ‘see’ mentors more frequently, and build relationships. There is evidence of shifts in agency that may have the possibility of enriching pre-service teachers’ experiences and facilitating opportunities for reflective practice and critical discussions. However, whilst the paper reports that shifts in agency within the training triad has the potential to be liberating, it also reports potential concerns with regard to equality within the training and assessment process. In accessing University Tutor voices about matters that involve them, this paper draws attention to both the challenges and opportunities faced by providers of pre-service education in the absence of accessing school settings.

From January 1, 2020 to April 14, 2020, a total of 22,928 users generated 27,501 tweets regarding face masks in the U.S. network, whereas 17,267 users produced 18,686 tweets in that of South Korea. The results of the semantic network analysis shed light on Americans' initial resistance to wearing masks as well as Koreans' willingness to comply. Details of the results are discussed further in the paper. With real-time data aggregation, this study gives insight into the rising controversy regarding wearing face masks during COVID-19 while providing implications for health officials designing strategic communication messages.","Choi, J.

Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) restrictions, particularly relating to the sale of alcohol and hours of curfew, have had a marked effect on the temporal pattern of unnatural deaths in South Africa. Methods. Death data were collected over 68 weeks from January 2020 to April 2021, together with information on the nature of restrictions (if any) on the sale of alcohol, and hours of curfew. Data were analysed using a simple ordinary least square (OLS) regression model to estimate the relative contribution of restrictions on the sale of alcohol and hours of curfew to the pattern of excess unnatural deaths. Results. The complete restriction on the sale of alcohol resulted in a statistically significant reduction in unnatural deaths regardless of the length of curfew. To the contrary, periods where no or limited restrictions on alcohol were in force had no significant effect, or resulted in significantly increased unnatural deaths. Conclusion. The present study highlights an association between alcohol availability and the number of unnatural deaths and demonstrates the extent to which those deaths might be averted by disrupting the alcohol supply. While this is not a long-term solution to addressing alcohol-related harm, it further raises the importance of implementing evidence-based alcohol control measures.","Moultrie, T. A.; Dorrington, R.

In our previous study on endothelial cells, the rose extract reduced the secretion of inflammatory markers significantly. Methods The red rose extract used in this study was prepared and stored until use at -20°C. T cells were seeded in 96-well plates at 313500 cells/well in 100μl of cell culture medium in duplicate, one half of the wells were used for biomarkers screening in the culture medium, and the other half for cytotoxicity assay. 24h after plating, the cells were treated in duplicate with 100μl of red rose extract diluted at 0.5%, 0.1%, 0.05%, 0.01% and 0.005% (v/v) in cell culture medium or with culture medium only as control for 72h. Some other wells were for untreated cells, and cells treated with rose extract at 0.005% for 48h incubation time. After 48h and 72h, the corresponding wells were used for the cytotoxicity assay and from the duplicate wells, the cell culture media were collected and stored at -80°C until the biomarkers screening assay. Results Cytotoxicity assay revealed insignificant changes. IFN-gamma, MCP-1, GRO, RANTES and TIMP, Angiopoietin 1 and MMP-9 were elevated. Except MMP-9 which had fold changes >2 other cytokines were minimally elevated at various concentrations and timing of rose extract treatment. None of the cytokines were less than 0.8-fold. Conclusions Unlike in the endothelial cells, there is mild elevation in few inflammatory markers on T lymphocytes treatment by rose extract.

Yet, while the patterns of neural activity engaged in striatum and amygdala during affective processing are well established, especially during reward anticipation, very little is known about subcallosal ACC. Here we recorded neural activity in non-human primate subcallosal ACC and compared this to interconnected parts of basolateral amygdala and rostromedial striatum while macaque monkeys performed reward-based tasks. Applying multiple analysis approaches, we found that neurons in subcallosal ACC and rostromedial striatum preferentially signal anticipated reward using short bursts of activity that form temporally-specific sequences. By contrast, basolateral amygdala uses a mixture of both sequential and more sustained activity to signal anticipated reward. Thus, sequential patterns of neural activity across populations of neurons are engaged in affect, especially in subcallosal ACC.

The clinical features and epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 in children with DS, and risk factors for severe outcomes, must be established to inform COVID-19 shielding advice and vaccination priority. Objective: To determine risk factors for a severe course of COVID-19 in pediatric DS patients and to compare the prevalence of severe COVID-19 between pediatric patients with and without DS. Design: This retrospective cohort study included pediatric cases (aged <18 years) with DS from the Trisomy 21 Research Society international survey and pediatric cases from the general population published by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (COVID-NET) collected during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic (controls). Setting: Cohorts included 328 children with DS (127 hospitalized, 39%) and 224 children without DS (all hospitalized) with COVID-19. Of the pediatric DS patients, 64.1% were from low-to-middle-income countries (LMICs), and 35.9% from high-income countries (HICs). Participants: Clinicians, family members, or caregivers completed the survey on behalf of children with DS affected by COVID-19. Results: Among the 328 COVID-19 patients with DS; older age, obesity, and epilepsy were significant risk factors for hospitalization; and age and thyroid disorder were significant risk factors for acute respiratory distress syndrome. The 127 hospitalized COVID-19 patients with DS had a higher incidence of cough, fever, nasal signs and shortness of breath than controls. Compared with controls, hospitalized children with DS (especially those from LMICs) had a higher prevalence of COVID-19-related medical complications (pneumonia, ARDS, acute renal failure). Conclusions and relevance: Children with DS are at higher risk for severe COVID-19 than the general pediatric population. Efforts should be made to monitor the health of children and young people with DS during the ongoing pandemic and to report any COVID-19 signs and symptoms in a timely manner, especially for those who have comorbidities which are risk factors for severe COVID-19.

An example is the ability of most living organisms of digesting proteins they feed off into amino acids and then using such amino acids in the ribosomal synthesis of new proteins. Recently, we have shown that such recycling of proteins can be reproduced outside living organisms. The key feature of proteins that allows for this type of recycling is their being sequence-defined polymers. Arguably, the most famous sequence-defined polymer in Nature is DNA. Here we show that it is possible starting from sheared calf-DNA to obtain all the four nucleotides as monophosphate-nucleotides (dNMPs). These dNMPs were phosphorylated in a one-pot, multi-enzymes, phosphorylation reaction to generate triphosphate-nucleotides (dNTPs). Finally, we used the dNTPs so achieved (with a global yield of ~60%) as reagents for PCR (polymerase chain reaction) and quantitative PCR (qPCR) to produce target DNA strands. This approach is an efficient, convenient, and environmentally friendly way to produce dNTPs and DNA through recycling according to the paradigm of circular economy.","Liu, Weina; Giaveri, Simone; Ortiz, Daniel; Stellacci, Francesco",bioRxiv,287,16

Theory indicates that the number of sites needed to accurately reconstruct a fully resolved tree grows at a rate proportional to the inverse square of the length of the shortest edge. However, when inferred trees are partially resolved due to short edges, “accuracy” should be defined as the rate of discovering false splits (clades on a rooted tree) relative to the actual number found. Thus, accuracy can be high even if short edges are common. Specifically, in a “near-perfect” parameter space in which trees are large, the tree length ξ (the sum of all edge lengths), is small, and rate variation is minimal, the expected false positive rate is less than ξ/3; the exact value depends on tree shape and sequence length. This expected false positive rate is far below the false negative rate for small ξ and often well below 5% even when some assumptions are relaxed. We show this result analytically for maximum parsimony and explore its extension to maximum likelihood using theory and simulations. For hypothesis testing, we show that measures of split “support” that rely on bootstrap resampling consistently imply weaker support than that implied by the false positive rates in near-perfect trees. The near-perfect parameter space closely fits several empirical studies of human virus diversification during outbreaks and epidemics, including Ebolavirus, Zika virus, and SARS-CoV-2, reflecting low substitution rates relative to high transmission/sampling rates in these viruses.","Wertheim, Joel O.; Steel, Mike; Sanderson, Michael J.",bioRxiv,287,1

Sixteen additional studies have been included in this update. The objective of this report is to identify comparative observational studies and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the efficacy and effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccination in reducing forward transmission from vaccinated people, and studies examining the biological plausibility of vaccination-induced transmission reduction. Method: A search of databases, MEDLINE, Embase, L-OVE and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials was conducted to identify RCTs or comparative observational studies evaluating the efficacy and effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccination in the prevention of transmission, asymptomatic infections and transmissibility of COVID-19 among vaccinated persons. An additional search of grey literature was conducted. This search is current to May 4th, 2021. Results: In this update, 16 additional studies, including 9 human and 7 animal studies, were included. Therefore, this review examines a total of 33 included studies: 21 human studies and 12 preclinical animal studies. Evidence from two large household surveillance studies from the UK suggests that a single or full dose of AstraZeneca (AZ) and Pfizer-BioNtech (PfBnT) vaccines may prevent household transmission of COVID-19 after 14 days of vaccination by up to 54%. The AZ vaccine trials in the general population suggest that an initial low dose followed by a standard dose may provide up to 59% protection against asymptomatic or unknown infection, although efficacy against these outcomes was not demonstrated following two standard doses. PfBnT vaccine observational studies in the general population suggest up to 90% effectiveness against asymptomatic infection after seven or more days of full dose vaccination. Up to 75% effectiveness against asymptomatic infection was reported after full-dose in healthcare workers. Across RCTs examining asymptomatic infection in the general population, one dose of Moderna was shown to provide an efficacy of 61.4% against asymptomatic infection 21 days after the first dose; in another trial, the J&J vaccine had an efficacy of 74% 28 days after the first dose. Lastly, seven of eight studies found significantly increased cycle threshold, suggestive of lower viral load, in PfBnT or AZ vaccinated individuals compared with those who were unvaccinated. Conclusion: The AZ and PfBnT vaccines may prevent household transmission of COVID-19 after 14 days of vaccination. More studies have found the vaccines to significantly reduce the risk of asymptomatic infection and significantly increase cycle threshold, suggestive of lower viral load. Further research is needed to evaluate post-vaccination infectivity and transmission of both the wild type COVID-19 virus and the variants of concern from other jurisdictions.","Egunsola, O.; Mastikhina, L.; Dowsett, L.; Farkas, B.; Hofmeister, M.; Saxinger, L.; Clement, F.",,287,17

A fundamental question is why these viruses are highly pathogenic in humans but fail to cause disease in bats. A number of hypotheses have been proposed to explain this unique aspect of bat biology. We hypothesized that the response of bats to filoviruses is systemic, involving multiple interrelated processes, and that the difference in the responses to infection between bats in humans is due to evolutionarily divergent genes. Results To understand how bats resist disease, we challenged two cohorts of Egyptian rousette bats with Marburg virus or Ebola virus and employed RNA-Seq to profile tissue-specific transcriptomic signatures. While we have found the viruses primarily in the liver, we detected transcriptomic changes in multiple tissues. The specific transcriptional responses observed suggest that bats limit viral replication and associated pathology by limiting the inflammatory response. This is largely achieved by tightly controlling expression and activation of acute phase proteins. Furthermore, we found evidence that important features of severe disease in humans, such as disseminated intravascular coagulation, are likely mitigated in bats through processes which involve vasodilation, iron metabolism, and avoidance of thrombosis through transcriptional changes in the coagulation pathway. Finally, we demonstrated transitioning of macrophages from the pro-inflammatory phenotype M1 to the anti-inflammatory, wound-healing phenotype M1. Conclusions Given the involvement of multiple pathways, we propose that Marburg and Ebola viruses induce a systemic response that results in an anti-inflammatory state that enables effective and lasting control of the infection. Our observations and analyses provide an experimental and computational framework for investigation of the resistance of bats to filovirus infection and identify genes involved in a systemic response of bats to Marburg and Ebola viruses that allows these animals to tolerate the infections. This framework and our results have the potential to aid in the development of new strategies to effectively mitigate and treat the effects of filovirus infections in humans.","Jayaprakash, Anitha D.; Ronk, Adam J.; Prasad, Abhishek N.; Covington, Michael F.; Stein, Kathryn R.; Schwarz, Toni M.; Hekmaty, Saboor; Fenton, Karla A.; Geisbert, Thomas W.; Basler, Christopher F.; Bukreyev, Alexander; Sachidanandam, Ravi",bioRxiv,287,5

The COVID-19 pandemic and responses by governments, including lockdowns, have had various consequences for lives and livelihoods. South Africa (SA) was one of the countries that implemented severely restrictive lockdowns to reduce transmission and limit the number of patients requiring hospitalisation. These interventions have had mixed consequences for routine health services. Objectives. To assess the impact of COVID-19 and restrictions imposed to limit viral transmission on routine health services in SA. Methods. Data routinely collected via the District Health Information System in 2019 and 2020 were analysed to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Results. Access to public health services between March 2020 and December 2020 was limited in all provinces. However, this was not linear, i.e. not all services in all provinces were similarly affected. Services most severely affected were antenatal visits before 20 weeks, access to contraceptives, and HIV and TB testing. The impact on outcomes was also noticeable, with a measurable effect on maternal and neonatal mortality. Conclusions. The responses to the COVID-19 pandemic, including different levels of lockdowns, the limitation of health services, lack of staff as a result of COVID-19 infection, and fear and stigma, resulted in a reduction in access to routine health services. However, the picture varies by type of service, province and district, with some faring worse than others. It is important to ensure that routine services are not significantly affected during future COVID-19 waves. This will require careful planning on the part of service providers and optimal communication with patients and communities.","Pillay, Y.; Pienaar, S.; Barron, P.; Zondi, T.",SAMJ South African Medical Journal,287,1

The objective of our study was to quantitatively compare the number of residents (supply) with the volume and duration of patient care activities (demand) to identify inefficiency. Methods: Using the most recently available data from an academic teaching hospital, we identified each occurrence of a set of patient care activities that took place on the clinical teaching unit. We completed a descriptive analysis of the frequencies of these activities and how the frequencies varied by hour, day, week, month, and year. Patient care activities included admissions, rounds, responding to pages, meeting with patients and their families, patient transfers, discharges, and responding to cardiac arrests. The estimated time to complete each task was based on the available data in our electronic healthcare system and interviews with general internal medicine physicians or trainees. To calculate resident utilization, the person-hours of patient care tasks was divided by the person-hours of resident supply. Resident utilization was computed for three scenarios corresponding to varying levels of resident absenteeism. Results: Between 2015 and 2019 there were 14,581 consultations to general internal medicine from the emergency department. Patient volumes tended to be highest during January and lowest during May and June; and highest on Monday morning and lowest on Friday night. Daily admissions into hospital from the emergency department were higher on weekdays than on weekends, and hourly admissions peaked at 8:00 AM and between 3:00 PM and 1:00 AM. Weekday resident utilization was generally highest between 8:00 AM and 2:00 PM and lowest between 1:00 AM and 8:00 AM. In a scenario where all residents were present apart from those who were post-call, resident utilization generally never exceeded 100%; in scenarios where at least one resident was absent due to illness and/or vacation, it was common for resident utilization to approach or exceed 100%, particularly during daytime working hours. Interpretation: Analyzing supply and demand on a general internal medicine ward has allowed us to identify periods where supply and demand are not aligned and to empirically demonstrate the vulnerability of current staffing models. These data have the potential to inform and optimize scheduling on an internal medicine ward.","Fralick, M.; Kaw, N.; Wang, M.; Mamdani, M.; Mourad, O.",,287,24

NPAs may also promote disease worsening in various inflammatory diseases. However, characterization of NPAs in cancer remains totally unexplored. Using ImageStream®X (ISX) imaging flow cytometer, we were not only allowed able to detect CD15+ CD14− CD36+ ITGA2B+ NPAs in both healthy donors’ (HDs) and cancer patients’ bloods, but we also showed that NPAs result from the binding of platelets preferentially to low-density neutrophils (LDNs) as opposed to normal-density neutrophils (NDNs). By re-analyzing two independent public scRNAseq data of whole blood leukocytes from cancer patients and HDs, we could identify a subset of neutrophils with high platelet gene expression that may correspond to NPAs. Moreover, we showed that cancer patients’ derived NPAs possessed a distinct molecular signature compared with the other neutrophil subsets, independently of platelet genes. Gene ontology (GO) term enrichment analysis of this NPAs-associated neutrophil transcriptomic signature revealed a significant enrichment of neutrophil degranulation, chemotaxis and trans-endothelial migration GO terms. Lastly, using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), we could show by multivariate Cox analysis that the NPAs-associated neutrophil transcriptomic signature was associated with a worse patient prognosis in several cancer types. These results suggest that neutrophils from NPAs are systemically primed by platelets empowering them with cancer progression capacities once at tumor site. NPAs may therefore hold clinical utility as novel non-invasive blood prognostic biomarker in cancer patients with solid tumors. Novelty and Impact Platelets physically interact with peripheral blood neutrophils to form neutrophil-platelet aggregates (NPAs), known to promote disease worsening in various inflammatory diseases. However, characterization of NPAs in cancer remains totally unexplored. We showed that NPAs-associated neutrophils were a yet-unreported unique subset of circulating neutrophils associated with a worse patient prognosis in several cancer types. NPAs may hold clinical utility as novel non-invasive blood prognostic biomarker in cancer patients with solid tumors.","Lecot, Pacôme; Ardin, Maude; Dussurgey, Sébastien; Alcazer, Vincent; Moudombi, Lyvia; Hubert, Margaux; Swalduz, Aurélie; Hernandez-Vargas, Hector; Viari, Alain; Caux, Christophe; Michallet, Marie-Cécile",bioRxiv,287,1

Such restrictions have altered physical activity (PA) habits. This study aimed to evaluate longitudinal trends in PA in a self-selected UK-based sample and the key predictors of these trends. Methods: From 23 April 2020 to 30 January 2021, an online survey collected detailed measures of PA engagement in a sample of 1,947 UK-based adults. Generalised estimating equations (GEE) were fitted to explore trends in PA engagement over time, and how sociodemographic, health, lifestyle and contextual factors impacted participant's attainment of Word Health Organisation (WHO) recommended levels of PA (constituting muscle strengthening activity (MSA), and moderate or vigorous PA (MVPA)). Results: Attainment of WHO recommended levels of total PA showed a decline. While one in five achieved the recommended levels of total PA in the first UK lockdown in April-June 2020 (19.5%, 95%, CI 17.8-21.3%) and a similar proportion in June-July 2020 (17.7%, 95%CI 16.1-19.5%), this reduced significantly during the period of eased restrictions in August-September 2020 (15.2%, 95%CI 13.7-16.9%) and the second UK lockdown in November 2020-January 2021 (14.1%, 95%CI 12.6-15.9%). The same trends were observed for MSA and MVPA individually. Better quality of life, higher socioeconomic position and higher pre-COVID-19 PA levels were associated with meeting WHO recommended PA levels, while having overweight or obesity, a limiting chronic health condition, or being in strict isolation showed the inverse associations. Time-specific associations with MSA or MVPA were observed for gender, age, ethnicity, and other health behaviours. Conclusion: Among a self-selected sample of UK-based adults, there were reductions in PA levels throughout the first UK lockdown without reversal during the ensuing period. Based on observed associations of reduced PA with socioeconomic and health-related indices, such changes may point towards deepening health inequities during the pandemic.","Mitchell, J.

However, little national cross-sectional data is available to inform potential gaps in access. We aimed to characterize overall access to and trends in telehealth availability for new cancer care patients at hospitals across the United States. Methods: We performed a cross sectional secret-shopper study to evaluate the availability of telehealth services for new patients for three major cancer types- colorectal, breast, and skin cancer-at Commission on Cancer accredited hospitals during the period of April to November 2020. American Hospital Association and Center for Medicare and Medicaid Service databases were queried to determine hospital characteristics. We described hospital variation in access to telehealth services using descriptive statistics. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression were used to identify factors associated with telehealth availability. Results: Of 334 successfully contacted facilities, 248 (74%) offered new patient telehealth services for at least one cancer type. However, access differed by cancer site: telehealth availability for new patients with skin, colorectal, and breast cancer was 47%, 42%, and 38%, respectively. Of the facilities sampled, 47% offered telehealth for one cancer type, 40% for two cancer types, and 14% for all three cancer types. Rates of any telehealth access among the cancer types ranged from 61% at Community Cancer Programs to 100% at NCI Designated Programs. In multivariable logistic regression, facility type was significantly associated with telehealth access while factors such as bed size, ownership, and volume were not significantly associated. Conclusions: Although access to telehealth services for patients with cancer has increased, overall gaps in access remain. Within facility differences in telehealth access imply opportunities to better align services within institutions, though further investigation is warranted as these offerings mature.

Novel techniques are needed for elucidation of their spatial relationships and architecture. Although a few multiplex immunofluorescence based techniques have been developed for visualization of the spatial relationships of various molecules in cells and tissues, there remains a significant need for newer methods that are rapid, easy to adapt and are gentle during the cyclic steps of fluorescence staining and de-staining. Here, we describe a novel, multiplex immunofluorescence imaging method, termed SeqStain, that uses fluorescent-DNA labelled antibodies for immunofluorescence staining of cells and tissues, and nuclease treatment for de-staining that allows selective enzymatic removal of the fluorescent signal. SeqStain can be used with primary antibodies, secondary antibodies and antibody fragments, such as Fabs, to efficiently analyse complex cells and tissues in multiple rounds of staining and de-staining. Additionally, incorporation of specific endonuclease restriction sites in antibody labels allows for selective removal of fluorescent signals, while retaining other signals that can serve as marks for subsequent analyses. The application of SeqStain on human kidney tissue provided spatialomic profile of the organization of >25 markers in the kidney, highlighting it as a versatile, easy to use and gentle new technique for spatialomic analyses of complex microenvironments.","Rajagopalan, Anugraha; Venkatesh, Ishwarya; Aslam, Rabail; Kirchenbuechler, David; Khanna, Shreyaa; Cimbaluk, David; Gupta, Vineet",bioRxiv,287,23

Compared to the adjuvant, curative setting, there is a scarcity of information about the impact of time to treatment initiation on outcomes in the palliative setting for gastrointestinal malignancies. We sought to determine the median time to initiation of systemic therapy (TIT) in mPC in the US prepandemic, and to assess the impact of TIT on survival outcomes. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed de-identified data of patients with mPC in the Flatiron Health nationwide EHRderived database. Metastatic diagnosis dates between 01/2014 and 04/2020 were included. Demographics, treatments, and outcomes were collected. TIT was defined as period between diagnosis and initiation of first-line systemic therapy and was split into 3 categories (I: < 2 weeks, II: 2- <4 weeks, and III: 4-8 weeks). Overall survival (OS) was defined from time of diagnosis to time of death. Post-chemotherapy survival (PCS) was time from initiation of firstline therapy to death. Adjusted and unadjusted multinomial logistic regression were used to evaluate the association of demographics and clinical factors with TIT. PCS and OS were estimated with Kaplan-Meier curves. Adjusted (demographics and clinical factors) Cox proportional hazard models were used to estimate the effect of TIT groups on PCS and OS. Category II served as control group. Results: 3231 patients with mPC who received at least one line of treatment were identified. 29% (N= 947), 43% (N=1375), and 28% (N= 909) were in TIT categories I-III respectively. The mean age at diagnosis was 67.4 years, with no significant difference in age (P=0.14) among categories. Median TIT was 20 days. Multinomial logistic regression showed that compared to TIT II, Black patients were less likely than White patients to receive chemotherapy in less than 2 weeks (P=0.02), and those who had recurrent disease were more likely to receive therapy in less than 2 weeks (P< 0.0001). There was no significant difference in median RW OS among the groups (I: 8.13, II: 8.07, III: 9.02 months, P=0.0532). RW PCS was also similar across categories (I: 7.8, II: 7.5, III: 7.8 months, P=0.88). Adjusted cox regression analysis suggests that compared to TIT of 2-4 weeks, TIT 4-8 weeks was associated with higher RW OS (HR, 0.88, 95% CI 0.8-0.97, P=0.009), but not RW PCS (HR, 0.95, 95% CI 0.87-1.05, P=0.32). Conclusions: This real-world analysis suggests that pre-pandemic, most patients with mPC who receive 1st line therapy were treated within 4 weeks of diagnosis. Compared to TIT of 2-4 weeks, TIT 4-8 weeks was associated with higher RW OS in mPC, although the clinical significance is minimal. In crisis situations, efforts to clinically optimize patients with mPC before systemic therapy should continue to be pursued.","Gbolahan, O. B.; Outlaw, D.

While these assembly intermediates are essential for maturation and quality control, how they form, and how their structure promotes quality control remains unknown. To address these questions, we determined the structure of an 80S-like ribosome assembly intermediate to an overall resolution of 3.4 Å. The structure, validated by biochemical data, resolves a large body of previously paradoxical data and illustrates how assembly and translation factors cooperate to promote the formation of an interface that lacks many mature subunit contacts but is stabilized by the universally conserved Dim1. We also show how Tsr1 enables this interface by blocking the canonical binding of eIF5B to 40S subunits, while maintaining its binding to 60S. The structure also shows how this interface leads to unfolding of the platform, which allows for temporal regulation of the ATPase Fap7, thus linking 40S maturation to quality-control during ribosome assembly.","Rai, Jay; Parker, Melissa D.; Huang, Haina; Choy, Stefan; Ghalei, Homa; Johnson, Matthew C.; Karbstein, Katrin; Stroupe, M.

In particular, single-molecule nucleotide sequence data originating from Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) sequencing platforms can be bioinformatically leveraged, in real-time, for enhanced biosurveillance of a vast array of zoonoses. The recently released nanopore adaptive sampling (NAS) pipeline facilitates immediate mapping of individual nucleotide molecules (i.e., DNA, cDNA, and RNA) to a given reference as each molecule is sequenced. User-defined thresholds then allow for the retention or rejection of specific molecules, informed by the real-time reference mapping results, as they are physically passing through a given sequencing nanopore. Here, we show how NAS can be used to selectively sequence entire genomes of bacterial tick-borne pathogens circulating in wild populations of the blacklegged tick vector, Ixodes scapularis.

However, very little is known regarding how patients with normal hypoglycemia unawareness (NAH) or impaired awareness (IAH) have responded to changes in diabetes management during the pandemic. Fifteen participants with T1DM from the Greater New Haven area participated in this study, which is part of a larger ongoing clinical study. Participants completed questionnaires measuring awareness (Clarke Score), current quality of diabetes care (Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction), and symptom severity (Hypo AQ) twice, pre-pandemic (prior to March 2020) and during pandemic (September to November 2020). Nine individuals had NAH (3F/6M, Clarke mean 1.00 ± SEM 0.4, age 32 ± 12 yrs, A1C 8.2 ± 1.3%, BMI 24.7 ± 4.7) and six had IAH, (4F/2M, Clarke 4.33 ± .3, age 39 ± 14, A1C 7.3 ± 0.9%, BMI 30.1 ± 7.4). There were no significant demographic differences between groups except for Clarke score.

Actions taken by governments and individuals to control the spread of the virus and mitigate economic impacts caused short-term disruptions in forest products supply chains and accelerated recent trends in consumer behavior. The COVID-19 containment measures delayed or postponed forest management and research;a surge in visitation of forests near urban areas increased vandalism, garbage accumulation, and the danger of fire ignitions. Forests and parks in remote rural areas experienced lower use, particularly those favored by international visitors, negatively affecting nearby communities dependent upon tourism. Physical distancing and isolation increased on-line shopping, remote working and learning;rather than emerging as novel drivers of change, these actions largely accelerated existing trends. On-line shopping sales had a positive effect on the packaging sector and remote working had a negative effect on graphic paper manufacturing.

This was the case although article 12(2) of the African Charter on Human and Peoples’ Rights provides that ‘[e]very individual shall have the right to leave any country including his own, and to return to his country’. However, article 12(2) also provides that ‘[t]his right may only be subject to restrictions, provided for by law for the protection of national security, law and order, public health or morality’. Article 12(2) of the African Charter provides for the rights both to leave and to return to one’s country. In this article the discussion is limited to the right to return. Unlike other regional human rights treaties in Europe, the Americas and the Arab world where the right to return to or enter one’s country is reserved for citizens only, the African Charter does not expressly limit this right to citizens. This raises the question of whether the right to return to one’s country is reserved for citizens or nationals only. In answering this question, one of two arguments could be made. The first argument is that the right to return under article 12(2) is reserved for citizens only (the strict approach). The second argument is that it is applicable to both citizens and to a few categories of foreign nationals (the broader approach). The jurisprudence of the African Commission and the African Court shows that these bodies have adopted the strict approach. This could be attributed to the fact that the communications they have so far dealt with have been filed by citizens (de jure or de facto) or on behalf of citizens. However, these bodies are likely to adopt a broad approach should the facts of the case(s) so require. In the constitutions of most African countries, states have also taken a strict approach. This article explains why it is better to take a broader approach when dealing with article 12(2) of the African Charter. This argument is made by partly comparing and contrasting article 12(2) of the African Charter with other regional and international instruments that protect the right to return. The article also demonstrates how the right to enter or return to one’s county has been approached in the constitutions of different African countries. © 2021, Pretoria University Law Press.

Motivated by recent findings of divergent hepaciviruses in rodents and a plausible African origin of HCV genotypes, we have screened a comprehensive collection of small mammals samples from seven sub-Saharan African countries. Out of 4,303 samples screened, 80 were found positive for the presence of hepaciviruses in 29 different host species. We here report 56 novel genomes that considerably increase the diversity of three divergent rodent hepacivirus lineages, which previously were almost exclusively represented by New World and European hepaciviruses. Further-more, we provide undisputable evidence for hepacivirus co-infections in rodents, which remarkably, we exclusively but repeatedly found in four sampled species of brush-furred mice. We also point at hepacivirus co-infections indirectly in different animal hosts by demonstrating evidence for recombination within specific host lineages.

As type I interferons (IFNs) are our first line of defense against severe viral respiratory infections, we explored whether glucocorticoids interfere with IFN signaling and whether their use associates to outcome of IFN beta treatment of ARDS. Methods: We performed a propensity-matched post-hoc-analysis using data from the recent randomized INTEREST trial comparing IFN beta 1a to placebo in ARDS patients. Based on the results of these analyses we utilized human lung tissue and human pulmonary endothelial cell cultures to investigate the effect of hydrocortisone on IFN nuclear signaling and the protein transcription of CD73, a molecule responsible for vascular integrity. Results: We found that hydrocortisone reduces the production, and prevents the nuclear translocation of IRF9, that is required for IFN beta-dependent signaling of multiple IFN-induced genes. In addition, hydrocortisone inhibits IFN beta dependent upregulation of CD73 in human lung tissue. Additionally, we found that use of glucocorticoids with IFN beta 1a was independently associated with increased mortality (OR 5.4, 95% CI 2.1-13.9, P< 0.001) in the INTEREST-trial. Conclusions: Glucocorticoids inhibit type I IFN beta signaling and the upregulation of CD73 in human lung. This provides the mechanistic basis for the harmful association of glucocorticoids in IFN beta treated patients in the INTEREST-trial. Most importantly, it strongly speaks against the use of glucocorticoids in viral-induced ARDS such as in the currently expanding corona virus outbreak.","Jalkanen, J.; Pettila, V.; Karvonen, M.; Huttunen, T.; Mandelin, J.; Jalkanen, M.; Malmberg, M.; Elima, K.; Bellingan, G.; Hollmen, M.; Ranieri, V.

Methods: Drug purchase data from the China Drug Supply Information Platform (CDSIP) database were used, involving nine ""4+7"" pilot cities and 12 non-pilot provinces in China. ""4+7"" policy-related drugs were included, which consisted of 25 ""4+7"" List drugs and 97 alternative drugs that have an alternative relationship with ""4+7"" List drugs in clinical use. ""4+7"" List drugs were divided into bid-winning and non-winning products according to the bidding results. Purchase volume, purchase expenditures, daily costs were selected as outcome variables, and were measured using Defined Daily Doses (DDDs), Chinese Yuan (CNY), and Defined Daily Drug cost (DDDc), respectively. Difference-in-Difference (DID) method was employed to estimate the net effect of policy impact. Results: After policy intervention, the DDDs of original drugs among ""4+7"" List drugs significantly reduced by 124.59%, while generic drugs increased by 52.12% (all p-values <0.01). 17.08% of the original drugs in DDDs were substituted by generic drugs. Prominent reductions of 121.69% and 80.54% were observed in the expenditure of original and generic drugs, with a total cost-saving of 5036.78 million CNY for ""4+7"" List drugs. The DDDc of bid-winning original and generic drugs, as well as non-winning original drugs, significantly decreased by 33.20%, 75.74%, and 5.35% (all p-values <0.01), while the DDDc of non-winning generic drugs significantly increased by 73.66% (p<0.001). The use proportion of bid-winning products and non-winning original drugs raised prominently from 39.66% to 91.93% Conclusions: ""4+7"" policy promoted the substitution use of generic drugs against original drugs, which conducive to drug costs saving. The overall quality level of drug use of public medical institutions significantly increased after ""4+7"" policy, especially in primary medical institutions.","Wang, J.; Yang, Y.; Xu, L.; Shen, Y.; Wen, X.; Mao, L.; Wang, Q.; Cui, D.; Mao, Z.",,287,19

The questionnaire consisted of 15 questions related to the children's knowledge of personal hygiene, the principles of food preparation and storage and the physiology of microorganisms and 13 questions related to the children's personal and food hygiene practice. In total, 169 questionnaires were collected. The study group of children had incomplete knowledge and often reported inappropriate food hygiene practices.FindingsThe subjects of food preparation and storage and knowledge of microbes were particular problem areas. By contrast, aspects related to handwashing, the appropriate practices while coughing or sneezing and washing fruit before consumption were positively evaluated. The children demonstrated the most knowledge in the field of personal hygiene. However, a very low percentage of correct answers was noted for the question about handwashing at school. None of the 13 questions related to this practice received more than 90% correct answers. The boys and girls demonstrated a comparable level of knowledge and practice in the area of food safety. It was showed that the place of school influenced answers to a greater extent compared to gender.Originality/valueThe results of the study play an important role in the prevention of food poisoning and are useful for the teachers, staff of training institutions and parents.

However, most mucosal adjuvants used are toxic and the identification of safe delivery systems is necessary. Here, we evaluate the potential of a recombinant Autographa californica baculovirus driving the expression of the LC3 fragment of the Gal-lectin to confer protection against amoebic liver abscess (ALA) in hamsters following oral or nasal immunization. Hamsters immunized by oral route showed complete absence (57.9%) or partial development (21%) of ALA, resulting in some protection in 78.9% of animals when compared with the wild type baculovirus and sham control groups. In contrast, nasal immunization conferred only 21% of protection efficacy. Levels of ALA protection showed lineal correlation with the development of an anti-amoebic cellular immune response evaluated in spleens, but not with the induction of seric IgG anti-amoeba antibodies. These results suggest that baculovirus driving the expression of E. histolytica vaccine candidate antigens is useful for inducing protective cellular and humoral immune responses following oral immunization, and therefore it could be used as a system for mucosal delivery of an anti-amoebic vaccine.","Meneses-Ruiz, DM; Laclette, JP; Aguilar-Díaz, H; Hernández-Ruiz, J; Luz-Madrigal, A; Sampieri, A; Vaca, L; Carrero, JC",Int J Biol Sci,287,22

Five cats were repeatedly used in each of the 9 groups. One group was not medicated. Cats in the other groups received 40 µg/kg medetomidine intramuscularly and saline (as the control), 160 µg/kg prazosin, or 40, 160 or 480 µg/kg atipamezole or yohimbine intravenously 0.5 hr later. Volume, pH and specific gravity of urine; plasma arginine vasopressin (AVP) level; and creatinine, osmolality and electrolyte levels in both urine and plasma were measured. Both atipamezole and yohimbine, but not prazosin, antagonized medetomidine-induced diuresis. The antidiuretic effect of atipamezole was more potent than that of yohimbine, but was not dose dependent, in contrast to the effect of yohimbine at the tested doses. Both atipamezole and yohimbine reversed medetomidine-induced decreases in both urine specific gravity and osmolality and increases in plasma osmolality and free-water clearance. Antidiuresis of either atipamezole or yohimbine was not related to the area under the curve for AVP level, although the highest dose of both atipamezole and yohimbine initially and temporarily increased plasma AVP levels, suggesting that this may partly influence the antidiuretic effects of both agents. The diuretic effect of medetomidine in cats may be mediated by α2-adrenoceptors, but not α1-adrenoceptors. Atipamezole and yohimbine can be used as antagonistic agents against medetomidine-induced diuresis in healthy cats.","Murahata, Yusuke; Yamamoto, Asami; Miki, Yuya; Hikasa, Yoshiaki",The Journal of veterinary medical science,287,19

In the United States, ""stay-at-home"" orders have led to loss of social routines and the closing of restaurants and bars; as a result, sales of alcohol have increased. The aim of this study was to assess changes in alcohol use patterns as a result of social distancing measures. METHODS A single online survey was sent to a convenience sample of adults through social media. Self-reported demographics and alcohol use patterns before and during social distancing were obtained. RESULTS Four hundred seventeen subjects completed the survey; 83% were women, 77% were married, 44% were between ages 35 and 44 years. Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT-C) scores increased from median value of 3 to 4 (P < 0.0001); the increase was statistically significant only in women (P < 0.0001). Fewer people use alcohol during social distancing; however, in those who use alcohol, the frequency and quantity ingested increased, as well as the frequency of alcohol use prior to 5 pm. Despite these increases, there was an overall reduction in binge drinking pattern. Multivariate analysis identified women, having children at home, and a history of substance abuse to be associated with increase in alcohol use. CONCLUSION Among those who continue to drink alcohol, social distancing has led to a significant increase in the amount of alcohol ingested, frequency of alcohol use, and an increase in AUDIT-C scores in women suggesting hazardous alcohol use behaviors. Clinicians should continue to assess patient alcohol use during the pandemic. Further studies will be needed to assess long-term outcomes after the COVID-19 pandemic resolves.","Boschuetz, Nicole; Cheng, Shanna; Mei, Ling; Loy, Veronica M",WMJ : official publication of the State Medical Society of Wisconsin,287,33

The assembly of HBsAg into cylindrical and spherical particles occurred intracellularly within the endoplasmic reticulum. HBsAg particles accumulated within large dilated areas of the endoplasmic reticulum and remained within these structures for most of the time prior to secretion from the cells. Once the particles were formed, the HBsAg polypeptides did not appear to become associated with subsequent intracellular organelle membranes or the plasma membrane. HBsAg within the dilated structures did not bind wheat germ agglutinin, indicating that its oligosaccharide chains had not yet been processed to the complex form (containing terminal sialic acid-N-acetylglucosamine residues). The oligosaccharide chains of HBsAg are processed to the complex form and can be detected on the HBsAg after secretion, but this event was not detected within cells. In addition, HBsAg was not observed on the cell surface by indirect immunofluorescence or immunoprecipitation, although immunoelectron microscopy revealed some staining at or near the cell surface. These results suggested that HBsAg was either secreted from cells without being incorporated into the plasma membrane, or that the levels of HBsAg in the plasma membrane were below the limits of detection.","Patzer, E J; Nakamura, G R; Simonsen, C C; Levinson, A D; Brands, R",Journal of virology,287,9

Hope is believed to act as a motivation to enable one to cope with the anxiety. This study was conducted to identify the role of hope in alleviating anxiety due to the COVID-19 outbreak during the primary phase among community dwellers in Iran. METHODS This cross-sectional study recruited 3,565 subjects with the convenience sampling method. Data collection tools used included the COVID-19 knowledge checklist, Generalised Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) questionnaires and Snyder Hope Scale. Participants were asked to fill in the questionnaires online. The data were analysed using descriptive and inferential statistics (multivariate linear regression analysis). RESULTS Participants' mean scores of anxiety and hope were 6.06±4.52 and 31.27±4.52, respectively. The results indicated that 27.1% of the changes in the anxiety scores were predictable with some of the variables examined in this study. A high score of hope was directly associated with a lower level of anxiety. In addition, the number of hours spent following news and information on COVID-19 was significantly related to anxiety level. Moreover, female gender, urban residence, and having relatives suffering from COVID-19 were significantly related to a higher level of anxiety (P<0.05). CONCLUSION The morbidity and mortality associated with the COVID-19 outbreak had brought a lot of anxiety among community dwellers. Hope, potentially, can contribute to overcoming anxiety.

It is becoming increasingly clear that T lymphocytes and gingival fibroblasts are capable of influencing each other. For example, the T cell cytokine interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) is able to induce MHC class II molecules on the surface of several cell types, including gingival fibroblasts. Histological sections of chronically inflamed gingival tissue showed a great number of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells that produced IFN-gamma, and in addition showed abundant expression of MHC class II molecules on gingival fibroblasts. Therefore, we investigated whether these gingival fibroblasts acquire the capacity to carry out MHC class II-restricted functions such as antigen presentation to local T cells. In this study, we show that IFN-gamma-treated gingival fibroblasts were able to function as antigen-presenting cells (APC) for superantigen-mediated T cell proliferation. However, these fibroblasts failed to present whole-cell antigens of periodontitis-associated bacteria. Moreover, gingival fibroblasts inhibited the presentation of the whole-cell antigens of these bacteria by professional APC. This inhibition could be overcome by the addition of IL-2. These results suggest that gingival fibroblasts play an important role in the local specific immune response in chronic inflammatory periodontal lesions by regulating the response of infiltrating T cells.","Wassenaar, A; Snijders, A; Abraham-Inpijn, L; Kapsenberg, M L; Kievits, F",Clinical and experimental immunology,287,9

The major concern is the chronic pain reported after mesh suture fixation. We studied the practical and clinical aspects of a Lichtenstein repair using the semi-resorbable self-fixating Parietex ProGrip mesh. METHODS Consecutive patients with inguinal hernia were operated according to the Lichtenstein technique using Parietex ProGrip. Complications were assessed. Pain and discomfort were evaluated at discharge, and at 1 and 4 weeks and minimum 6 months after the intervention. RESULTS 320 patients were included in the study. No intra-operative complications or difficulties occurred. Mean operating time was 36 minutes (range 20-65 minutes). 87.5% of the patients (280) were discharged at day of operation, 11.9% (38 patients) had an overnight stay and 0.6% (2 patients) stayed two nights. Mean number of days of analgesic use is 2.1. At the 1 week follow-up visit, minor pain or discomfort was reported by 45 patients (14%) and at 4 weeks 11 patients (3.4%) still had minor discomfort. At 6 months 1 patient suffered from persisting local numbness. Two recurrences were noted, both were re-operated. CONCLUSIONS This observational study confirms earlier findings with this semi-resorbable self-gripping mesh regarding operation time, complications and recurrence. The open Lichtenstein hernia repair with the semi-resorbable self-gripping Parietex Progrip mesh seems to offer a reliable alternative for the treatment of inguinal hernia with benefits on operating time as well as on postoperative pain.","Gys, T; Gys, B; Lafullarde, T",Acta chirurgica Belgica,287,28

Since several of these signal molecules are known to be associated with lipid raft (LR) domains, we investigated the role of LR during KSHV infection of HMVEC-d cells. Pretreatment of cells with LR-disrupting agents methyl beta-cyclo dextrin (MbetaCD) or nystatin significantly inhibited the expression of viral latent (ORF73) and lytic (ORF50) genes. LR disruption did not affect KSHV binding but increased viral DNA internalization. In contrast, association of internalized viral capsids with microtubules (MTs) and the quantity of infected nucleus-associated viral DNA were significantly reduced. Disorganized and disrupted MTs and thick rounded plasma membranes were observed in MbetaCD-treated cells. LR disruption did not affect KSHV-induced FAK and ERK1/2 phosphorylation; in contrast, it increased the phosphorylation of Src, significantly reduced the KSHV-induced PI3-K and RhoA-GTPase and NF-kappaB activation, and reduced the colocalizations of PI3-K and RhoA-GTPase with LRs. Biochemical characterization demonstrated the association of activated PI3-K with LR fractions which was inhibited by MbetaCD treatment. RhoA-GTPase activation was inhibited by PI3-K inhibitors, demonstrating that PI3-K is upstream to RhoA-GTPase. In addition, colocalization of Dia-2, a RhoA-GTPase activated molecule involved in MT activation, with LR was reduced. KSHV-RhoA-GTPase mediated acetylation and aggregation of MTs were also reduced. Taken together, these studies suggest that LRs of endothelial cells play critical roles in KSHV infection and gene expression, probably due to their roles in modulating KSHV-induced PI3-K, RhoA-GTPase, and Dia-2 molecules essential for postbinding and entry stages of infection such as modulation of microtubular dynamics, movement of virus in the cytoplasm, and nuclear delivery of viral DNA.","Raghu, Hari; Sharma-Walia, Neelam; Veettil, Mohanan Valiya; Sadagopan, Sathish; Caballero, Adriana; Sivakumar, Ramu; Varga, Laszlo; Bottero, Virginie; Chandran, Bala",Journal of virology,287,28

The antigen gave high HA titers using rat erythrocytes, suggesting that it contained large amounts of hemagglutinin esterase (HE) antigen. The CL antigen, combined with an oil adjuvant, was tested for protective and antibody-inducing activities in cattle. Four groups (2 cattle/group) of cattle were inoculated with CL antigen having HA titers of 16 000, 4000, 1000, and 250. Another group served as untreated controls. Two intramuscular inoculations were given at an interval of 3 wk. The animals were challenged with virus 1 wk after the second inoculation. The groups immunized with the CL antigen having an HA titer of 4000 or 16 000 produced hemagglutination inhibition (HI) antibody titers of > 320 and serum neutralizing (SN) antibody titers of > 1280. These groups of animals showed no clinical abnormalities after challenge. In the groups immunized with CL antigen at an HA titer of 1000 or 250, HI antibody titers were 40 to 160 and SN titers were 80 to 640. The cattle with HI antibody titers of > or = 160 and the SN titers of > or = 640 showed no clinical signs, but the cattle with the HI antibody titer < 80 and the SN antibody titer < 160 developed watery diarrhea and fever after challenge. These results indicate that CL antigen with high HA titer induces antibody production in cattle that provides effective protection against winter dysentery.","Takamura, K; Okada, N; Ui, S; Hirahara, T; Shimizu, Y",Canadian journal of veterinary research = Revue canadienne de recherche veterinaire,287,1

METHODS Ninety-three patients with confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 admitted in Ezhou Central Hospital from February to April in 2020 were analyzed. Among them, 43 patients were selected from Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with the diagnosis of critical type of COVID-19, and 50 cases of common type were selected from the Department of Respiratory Medicine. The baseline data, blood routine test and biochemical indexes of the patients were collected on the first day of admission. NLRs of the patients were calculated, and COX survival analysis according to the NLR 4-category method was performed. The patients' outcomes were analyzed with receiver operating curves (ROCs). The patients were divided into two groups according to NLR cutoff value for comparison of the biochemical indexes. Based on the patients' outcomes, NLR cutoff value classification and clinical classification, multiple binary logistics regression was performed to screen the key variables and explore their significance in COVID-19. RESULTS The NLR four-category method was not applicable for prognostic evaluation of the patients. The cut-off value of NLR for predict the prognosis of COVID-19 was 11.26, with a sensitivity of 0.903 and a specificity of 0.839; the laboratory indicators of the patients with NLR < 11.26 were similar to those in patients of the common type; the indicators were also similar between patients with NLR≥11.26 and those with critical type COVID-19. NLR, WBC, NEUT, PCT, DD, BUN, TNI, BNP, and LDH had significant effects on the clinical classification and outcome of the patients (P < 0.05); Cr, Ca, PH, and Lac had greater impact on the outcome of the patients (P < 0.05), while Na, PCO2 had greater impact on the clinical classification of the patients (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS NLR can be used as an important reference for clinical classification, prognostic assessment, and biochemical abnormalities of COVID-19. Patients of critical type more frequently have bacterial infection with more serious inflammatory reactions, severer heart, lung and kidney damages, and much higher levels of DD and LDH than those of the common type. NLR, NEUT, DD, TNI, BNP, LDH, Ca, PCT, PH, and Lac have obvious influence on the prognosis of COVID-19 and should be observed dynamically.","Li, Hongbing; Zhao, Maojun; Xu, Yingsheng",Zhejiang da xue xue bao.

Many of the ethical issues raised by infectious diseases are related to these diseases' powerful ability to engender fear in individuals and panic in populations. We address the association of some infectious diseases with high morbidity and mortality rates, the sense that infectious diseases are caused by invasion or attack on humans by foreign micro-organisms, the acute onset and rapid course of many infectious diseases, and, in particular, the communicability of infectious diseases. The individual fear and community panic associated with infectious diseases often leads to rapid, emotionally driven decision making about public health policies needed to protect the community that may be in conflict with current bioethical principles regarding the care of individual patients. The discussion includes recent examples where dialogue between public health practitioners and medical-ethicists has helped resolve ethical issues that require us to consider the infected patient as both a victim with individual needs and rights and as a potential vector of disease that is of concern to the community.","Smith, Charles B; Battin, Margaret P; Jacobson, Jay A; Francis, Leslie P; Botkin, Jeffrey R; Asplund, Emily P; Domek, Gretchen J; Hawkins, Beverly",Developing world bioethics,287,28

To mitigate the potential catastrophes that confront humanity in the new millennium, an evidence-based approach to disaster management is required urgently. This study moves toward such an evidence-based approach by identifying peer-reviewed publications following a range of disasters and events over the past three decades. METHODS Peer-reviewed, event-specific literature was identified using a comprehensive search of the electronically indexed database, MEDLINE (1956-January 2009). An extended comprehensive search was conducted for one event to compare the event-specific literature indexed in MEDLINE to other electronic databases (EMBASE, CINAHL, AMED, CENTRAL, Psych Info, Maternity and Infant Care, EBM Reviews). RESULTS Following 25 individual disasters or overwhelming crises, a total of 2,098 peer-reviewed, event-specific publications were published in 789 journals (652 publications following disasters/events caused by natural hazards, 966 following human-made/technological disasters/events, and 480 following conflict/complex humanitarian events).The event with the greatest number of peer-reviewed, event-specific publications was the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks (686 publications). Prehospital and Disaster Medicine published the greatest number of peer-reviewed, event-specific publications (54), followed by Journal of Traumatic Stress (42), Military Medicine (40), and Psychiatric Services (40). The primary topics of event-specific publications were mental health, medical health, and response. When an extended, comprehensive search was conducted for one event, 75% of all peer-reviewed, event-specific publications were indexed in MEDLINE. CONCLUSIONS A broad range of multi-disciplinary journals publish peer reviewed, event-specific publications. While the majority of peer-reviewed, event-specific literature is indexed in MEDLINE, comprehensive search strategies should include EMBASE to increase yield.","Smith, Erin; Wasiak, Jason; Sen, Ayan; Archer, Frank; Burkle, Frederick M",Prehospital and disaster medicine,287,9

Critical perioperative events require that the anesthesiologist perform procedures that are only used intermittently. Teaching these procedures is complicated by their infrequency and pressure to maximize operating room efficiency; therefore we created an annual 1-day anesthesiology skills lab as an innovative method of residency education. METHODS Anesthetized pigs served as the educational platform for first-year anesthesiology residents to gain hands-on experience performing regional, thoracic, vascular, and difficult airway techniques. A 20-question test was administered pre- and post-lab to assess the effectiveness of our educational intervention. Participants evaluated the quality of the educational experience (1-poor to 5-excellent). RESULTS First-year anesthesiology residents participated (n=70, 2008-2012). Residents' pre-test scores measured 50.3±2.6% (range 20-80). Following lab participation, their test scores signi ficantly improved to a mean of 84.2±1.9% (range 45-100, p<0.0001). Participants increased their knowledge and skills (mean 4.96±0.02), considered the skills lab to be a worthwhile educational experience (mean 4.99±0.01), and agreed that the lab should be repeated in the future (mean 5.00). CONCLUSIONS In vivo labs confers educational benefits which are both perceived and self-reported by the participants and objectively demonstrated by marked improvements in their post-test scores. Animal models provide high-fidelity tactile learning, real-time physiological changes, and potential for complications which builds residents' familiarity and confidence with anesthesiology-related procedures and crisis events that would otherwise involve potential patient risk.

Unlike clinical practice guidelines, a SCAMP is a flexible algorithm that undergoes iterative updates based on periodic data collection and review. We recently implemented a SCAMP for the closed treatment of pediatric torus fractures. The purpose of this study is to analyze the effect of SCAMP implementation on resource utilization, practice variability, cost of care, and outcomes. METHODS This study was a retrospective review of prospectively collected data on 273 patients with pediatric torus fractures. The pre-SCAMP cohort included 116 subjects from 2008 to 2010. The SCAMP cohort included 157 subjects from 2011 to 2013. The pre-SCAMP cohort was treated according to the judgment of attending fellowship-trained pediatric orthopaedic surgeons. The SCAMP cohort was treated with a standardized algorithm including radiographs and splint application at initial presentation, with a single follow-up at 3 weeks. Patient demographics were analyzed to verify comparability between cohorts. Follow-up data including clinic visits, x-rays and practice variability was recorded. Costing analysis was conducted using time-derived activity-based costing methodology. Outcomes were compared using Poisson regression analysis. Incident rate ratios (IRR) with 95% confidence limits were estimated. RESULTS No differences in clinical results were observed between the pre-SCAMP and SCAMP cohorts, and all patients demonstrated return to baseline activity at final follow-up. Patient demographics were comparable across cohorts. The SCAMP cohort had a 48% reduction in clinic visits [IRR, 0.52; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.44-0.60; P<0.001], 60% reduction in x-rays (IRR, 0.40; CI, 0.33-0.47; P<0.001), and a 23% reduction in x-rays per clinic visit (IRR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.65-0.91; P<0.001). Furthermore, SCAMP implementation resulted in a 49% reduction in the overall cost of care. CONCLUSIONS SCAMPs provide a novel alternative to CPGs to implement cost effective changes in Orthopaedic practice. For pediatric torus fractures, SCAMP implementation resulted in decreased practice variability, resource utilization, and overall cost of care while maintaining clinical outcomes.

When the patients are pregnant, most EWS still use non-pregnant reference ranges of vital signs to determine trigger thresholds. There are no published reference ranges for all vital signs in pregnancy. We aimed to define vital signs reference ranges for term pregnancy in the preoperative period, and to determine the appropriateness of EWS trigger criteria in pregnancy. We conducted a one-year retrospective study in a tertiary referral obstetric hospital. The study sample was healthy term women undergoing planned caesarean section (CS). Systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), heart rate (HR), oxygen saturation (SpO2) and temperature were all measured automatically and data was extracted from the medical record. Two hundred and fifty-eight women met inclusion criteria. Results were (mean ± SD [standard deviation]) SBP 118 ± 11.2 mmHg, DBP 75 ± 10.3 mmHg, HR 84 ± 10.2 /minute, respiratory rate 18 ± 1.5 /minute, SpO2 99% ± 1.0% and temperature 36.4°C ± 0.43°C. The reference ranges (mean ± 2SD) determined were SBP 96-140 mmHg, DBP 54-96 mmHg, HR 64-104/minute, RR 15-21 /minute, SpO2 97%-100% and temperature 35.5°C-37.3°C. This study defined a reference range for vital signs in healthy term pregnant women undergoing CS. Study findings suggest that currently used criteria for EWS triggers, based on non-pregnant values, may be too extreme for timely detection of deteriorating pregnant patients. Further research examining the modified HR triggers of ≤50 and ≥110 /minute in pregnant women and their relationship to clinical outcomes is required.","Dennis, A; Hardy, L",Anaesthesia and intensive care,287,1

Because there are more codons than residues, there is inherent redundancy in the coding. Certain residues (e.g., tryptophan) have only a single corresponding codon, while other residues (e.g., arginine) have as many as six corresponding codons. This freedom implies that the number of possible RNA sequences coding for a given protein grows exponentially in the length of the protein. Thus nature has wide latitude to select among mRNA sequences which are informationally equivalent, but structurally and energetically divergent. In this paper, we explore how nature takes advantage of this freedom and how to algorithmically design structures more energetically favorable than have been built through natural selection. In particular: (1) Natural Selection--we perform the first large-scale computational experiment comparing the stability of mRNA sequences from a variety of organisms to random synonymous sequences which respect the codon preferences of the organism. This experiment was conducted on over 27,000 sequences from 34 microbial species with 36 genomic structures. We provide evidence that in all genomic structures highly stable sequences are disproportionately abundant, and in 19 of 36 cases highly unstable sequences are disproportionately abundant. This suggests that the stability of mRNA sequences is subject to natural selection. (2) Artificial Selection--motivated by these biological results, we examine the algorithmic problem of designing the most stable and unstable mRNA sequences which code for a target protein. We give a polynomial-time dynamic programming solution to the most stable sequence problem (MSSP), which is asymptotically no more complex than secondary structure prediction. We show that the corresponding least stable sequence problem (LSSP) is NP-complete, and develop two heuristics for the construction of such sequences. We have implemented these algorithms, and present experimental results placing the high/low stability sequences in context with both wildtype and random encodings.

Their accuracy is unknown, which could affect downstream analyses. Objective: To compare the performance of fever-, cough-, and dyspnea-specific ICD-10 codes with medical record review among patients tested for COVID-19. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study included patients who underwent quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 at University of Utah Health from March 10 to April 6, 2020. Data analysis was performed in April 2020. Main Outcomes and Measures: The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) of ICD-10 codes for fever (R50*), cough (R05*), and dyspnea (R06.0*) were compared with manual medical record review. Performance was calculated overall and stratified by COVID-19 test result, sex, age group (<50, 50-64, and >64 years), and inpatient status. Bootstrapping was used to generate 95% CIs, and Pearson &#967;2 tests were used to compare different subgroups. Results: Among 2201 patients tested for COVD-19, the mean (SD) age was 42 (17) years; 1201 (55%) were female, 1569 (71%) were White, and 282 (13%) were Hispanic or Latino. The prevalence of fever was 66% (1444 patients), that of cough was 88% (1930 patients), and that of dyspnea was 64% (1399 patients). For fever, the sensitivity of ICD-10 codes was 0.26 (95% CI, 0.24-0.29), specificity was 0.98 (95% CI, 0.96-0.99), PPV was 0.96 (95% CI, 0.93-0.97), and NPV was 0.41 (95% CI, 0.39-0.43). For cough, the sensitivity of ICD-10 codes was 0.44 (95% CI, 0.42-0.46), specificity was 0.88 (95% CI, 0.84-0.92), PPV was 0.96 (95% CI, 0.95-0.97), and NPV was 0.18 (95% CI, 0.16-0.20). For dyspnea, the sensitivity of ICD-10 codes was 0.24 (95% CI, 0.22-0.26), specificity was 0.97 (95% CI, 0.96-0.98), PPV was 0.93 (95% CI, 0.90-0.96), and NPV was 0.42 (95% CI, 0.40-0.44). ICD-10 code performance was better for inpatients than for outpatients for fever (&#967;2 = 41.30; P < .001) and dyspnea (&#967;2 = 14.25; P = .003) but not for cough (&#967;2 = 5.13; P = .16). Conclusions and Relevance: These findings suggest that ICD-10 codes lack sensitivity and have poor NPV for symptoms associated with COVID-19. This inaccuracy has implications for any downstream data model, scientific discovery, or surveillance that relies on these codes.","Crabb, Brendan T; Lyons, Ann; Bale, Margaret; Martin, Valerie; Berger, Ben; Mann, Sara; West, William B; Brown, Alyssa; Peacock, Jordan B; Leung, Daniel T; Shah, Rashmee U",JAMA Netw Open,287,11

High infection ""hotspots"" interspersed within regions where infections remained sporadic were ubiquitous early in the outbreak, but the spatial signature of the infection evolved to affect most regions equally, albeit with distinct temporal patterns. The sparseness of Covid-19 infections in the United States was analyzed at scales spanning from 10 to 2,600 km (county to continental scale). Spatial evolution of Covid-19 cases in the United States followed multifractal scaling. A rapid increase in the spatial correlation was identified early in the outbreak (March to April). Then, the increase continued at a slower rate and approached the spatial correlation of human population. Instead of adopting agent-based models that require tracking of individuals, a kernel-modulated approach is developed to characterize the dynamic spreading of disease in a multifractal distributed susceptible population. Multiphase Covid-19 epidemics were reasonably reproduced by the proposed kernel-modulated susceptible-infectious-recovered (SIR) model. The work explained the fact that while the reproduction number was reduced due to nonpharmaceutical interventions (e.g., masks, social distancing, etc.), subsequent multiple epidemic waves still occurred; this was due to an increase in susceptible population flow following a relaxation of travel restrictions and corollary stay-at-home orders. This study provides an original interpretation of Covid-19 spread together with a pragmatic approach that can be imminently used to capture the spatial intermittency at all epidemiologically relevant scales while preserving the ""disordered"" spatial pattern of infectious cases.","Geng, Xiaolong; Katul, Gabriel G; Gerges, Firas; Bou-Zeid, Elie; Nassif, Hani; Boufadel, Michel C",Proc.

This virus spreads readily from person to person and predominantly to and from the respiratory route and through droplets. There are many different interventions that can be and are used to decrease successfully the risk and spread of COVID-19. Most of the principles underpinning these interventions relate to isolation and social distancing. These will need to be continued, at least in part, until safe and very effective vaccines become widely available and are delivered extensively and successfully globally. This new norm is isolation, plus social and physical distancing, and this new norm will likely be with us for some time to come. It will also be with us in any future pandemics, whether caused by bacteria or viruses, but especially when the causative pathogen spreads predominantly through the respiratory route. However, lockdowns and restrictions also cause many adverse but unintended economic, social and health consequences. Therefore, what is put into place needs to be proportionate to levels of risk of disease as well as spread, and which will vary in different localities and with time.","Collignon, Peter",Intern Med J,287,17

Whilst there is emerging evidence that negative mental health impacts associated with the COVID-19 pandemic may be more pronounced for women than men, less attention has focussed on changes to health behaviours and health seeking experienced by women. Similarly, the impact of the pandemic in rural areas has not been investigated in detail. Our research questions were 'have females residing in rural areas experienced changes in alcohol consumption, unhealthy food consumption, smoking, exercise or health seeking during the COVID-19 pandemic?' and 'are there differences in health behaviour changes between rural females living with or without children?'. Net increases (scale of 0-1) in consumption of unhealthy food (95% CI 0.05, 0.22) and alcohol (95% CI 0.12, 0.29) were observed. Net decreases (scale of -1 to 0) in visits to the doctor (95% CI -0.23, -0.35) and other health professionals (95% CI -0.40, -0.54) were observed.

Epidemics have a long-standing history in literature. We want to analyze if society's responses to the epidemic have changed over time, and what literature can teach about the society's reaction to an epidemic. Material and methods We searched and discussed the references to the social effects of the epidemic that are provided in three famous works of European literature providing descriptions about society's reactions to an epidemic throughout the centuries have been selected: “The Decameron” by Giovanni Boccaccio, “The Betrothed” by Alessandro Manzoni, and “The Plague” by Albert Camus. Results Literature teaches us that: the epidemic's spread is often preceded and favoured by a phase of negation or under evaluation of the problem;restrictive measures are the most efficient for containing the virus’ spread;some people have difficulties in being compliant with these measures;infodemia may accompany an epidemic, feeding chaos and fear among the people. Conclusion Looking at examples of epidemics reported in the past, we can conclude that the current COVID-19 pandemic shows that society's responses to an unknown disease are not changed over time.","Perciaccante, A.; Malacrea, M.; Coralli, A.; Donell, S.","Ethics, Medicine and Public Health",287,1

METHODS: A web-based national survey was developed by the Working Group Young Rheumatology of the German Society for Rheumatology and the German League against Rheumatism. The prospective survey was distributed via social media (Twitter, Instagram and Facebook), QR code and email. Descriptive statistics were calculated, and regression analyses were performed to show correlations. RESULTS: We analysed the responses of 299 patients and 129 rheumatologists. Most patients (74%) and rheumatologists (76%) believed that DHAs are useful in the management of rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases (RMDs) and felt confident in their own usage thereof (90%; 86%). 38% of patients and 71% of rheumatologists reported that their attitude had changed positively towards DHAs and that their usage had increased due to COVID-19 (29%; 48%). The majority in both groups agreed on implementing virtual visits for follow-up appointments in stable disease conditions. The most reported advantages of DHAs were usage independent of time and place (76.6%; 77.5%). The main barriers were a lack of information on suitable, available DHAs (58.5%; 41.9%), poor usability (42.1% of patients) and a lack of evidence supporting the effectiveness of DHAs (23.2% of rheumatologists). Only a minority (<10% in both groups) believed that digitalisation has a negative impact on the patient-doctor relationship. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic instigated an increase in patients' and rheumatologists' acceptance and usage of DHAs, possibly introducing a permanent paradigm shift in the management of RMDs.","Kernder, Anna; Morf, Harriet; Klemm, Philipp; Vossen, Diana; Haase, Isabell; Mucke, Johanna; Meyer, Marco; Kleyer, Arnd; Sewerin, Philipp; Bendzuck, Gerlinde; Eis, Sabine; Knitza, Johannes; Krusche, Martin",,287,16

Age-related changes in these cells may underlie the differential severity of pneumonia in older patients. We performed an integrated analysis of single-cell RNA-Seq data that revealed homogenous age-related changes in the alveolar macrophage transcriptome in humans and mice. Using genetic lineage tracing with sequential injury, heterochronic adoptive transfer, and parabiosis, we found that the lung microenvironment drove an age-related resistance of alveolar macrophages to proliferation that persisted during influenza A viral infection. Ligand-receptor pair analysis localized these changes to the extracellular matrix, where hyaluronan was increased in aged animals and altered the proliferative response of bone marrow-derived macrophages to granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). Our findings suggest that strategies targeting the aging lung microenvironment will be necessary to restore alveolar macrophage function in aging.","McQuattie-Pimentel, Alexandra C; Ren, Ziyou; Joshi, Nikita; Watanabe, Satoshi; Stoeger, Thomas; Chi, Monica; Lu, Ziyan; Sichizya, Lango; Aillon, Raul Piseaux; Chen, Ching-I; Soberanes, Saul; Chen, Zhangying; Reyfman, Paul A; Walter, James M; Anekalla, Kishore R; Davis, Jennifer M; Helmin, Kathryn A; Runyan, Constance E; Abdala-Valencia, Hiam; Nam, Kiwon; Meliton, Angelo Y; Winter, Deborah R; Morimoto, Richard I; Mutlu, Gökhan M; Bharat, Ankit; Perlman, Harris; Gottardi, Cara J; Ridge, Karen M; Chandel, Navdeep S; Sznajder, Jacob I; Balch, William E; Singer, Benjamin D; Misharin, Alexander V; Budinger, G R Scott",J. clin. invest,287,24

The purpose of this study was to explore caregiver burden and psychological distress among caregivers of children with DD as compared to caregivers of typically developing children across the United States as a result of COVID-19. Between 2 weeks and 1 month following COVID-19-related school closures, a total of 460 caregivers from across the U.S. completed an online survey via Qualtrics; recruitment and initial survey completion occurred simultaneously. Of the total sample of eligible participants (N = 407), 225 were the primary caregiver of a child with autism spectrum disorder (ASD)/attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and 182 were the primary caregiver of a child without ASD/ADHD. Participants across groups indicated varying levels of exposure to COVID-19 and an impact of COVID-19 at the community and individual or family levels. However, caregivers of children with ASD/ADHD reported significantly higher levels of burden, depression, anxiety, and stress. Overall, findings are consistent with anecdotal and preliminary reports that all caregivers are experiencing COVID-19-related challenges, with caregivers of children with ASD/ADHD experiencing even greater challenges, particularly with regard to burden and psychological distress.

METHODS: Open-access data and press releases on COVID-19 in Taiwan were collected on the website of the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control. All 55 community-acquired cases of COVID-19 confirmed from January 28 to April 12, 2020 in Taiwan were included. Basic demographic characteristics, symptom presentation, infection source, route of identification, and transmission dynamics were analyzed. RESULTS: Of the 55 cases, 52.7% were female and 74.5% were between 20-59 years of age. One sixth (16.4%) of community-acquired cases were asymptomatic. More than half (58.2%) of the cases were identified via contact tracing. The median incubation period was 6 days (range 1 to 13 days) and the median serial interval was 4 days (range -3 to 24 days). Twenty-six cases (47.3%) were transmitted from pre-symptomatic cases, eleven cases (20%) from symptomatic cases, and two cases (3.6%) from an asymptomatic case. The contagious period of symptomatic cases was from 7 days before to 15 days after the onset of symptoms. CONCLUSION: The high proportion of asymptomatic cases and the transmissibility in the pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic periods make control of COVID-19 challenging. Protective measures such as social distancing, wearing face masks, and hand washing are mandatory to prevent community transmission.","Liu, Jui-Yao; Chen, Tzeng-Ji; Hwang, Shinn-Jang",J. Chin. Med.

Because demand can exceed capacity at different areas and across different times of the day, drivers have to refuse passenger boardings at specific stops. Towards this goal, many public transport operators have modified their service routes by avoiding to serve stops with high passenger demand at specific times of the day. Given the urgent need to develop decision support tools that can prevent the overcrowding of vehicles, this study introduces a dynamic integer nonlinear program that proposes service patterns to individual vehicles that are ready to be dispatched. In addition to the objective of satisfying the imposed vehicle capacity due to COVID-19, the proposed service pattern model caters for the waiting time of passengers. Our model is tested in a bus line connecting the university of Twente with its surrounding cities demonstrating the improvement in terms of vehicle overcrowding, and analyzing the potential negative effects related to unserved passenger demand and excessive waiting times.","Gkiotsalitis, Konstantinos",,287,16

The objective of this study was to describe the structure, practice patterns, and outcomes of these vascular access teams during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional, self-reported study of central venous access line teams in hospitals afflicted with the COVID-19 pandemic. To participate in the study, hospitals were required to meet one of the following criteria: development of a formal plan for a central venous access line team during the pandemic; implementation of a central venous access line team during the pandemic; placement of central venous access by a designated practice group during the pandemic as part of routine clinical practice; or management of an iatrogenic complication related to central venous access in a patient with COVID-19. RESULTS: Participants from 60 hospitals in 13 countries contributed data to the study. Central venous line teams were most commonly composed of vascular surgery and general surgery attending physicians and trainees. Twenty sites had 2657 lines placed by their central venous access line team or designated practice group. During that time, there were 11 (0.4%) iatrogenic complications associated with central venous access procedures performed by the line team or group at those 20 sites. Triple lumen catheters, Cordis (Santa Clara, Calif) catheters, and nontunneled hemodialysis catheters were the most common types of central venous lines placed by the teams. Eight (14%) sites reported experience in placing central venous lines in prone, ventilated patients with COVID-19. A dedicated line cart was used by 35 (59%) of the hospitals. Less than 50% (24 [41%]) of the participating sites reported managing thrombosed central lines in COVID-19 patients. Twenty-three of the sites managed 48 iatrogenic complications in patients with COVID-19 (including complications caused by providers outside of the line team or designated practice group). CONCLUSIONS: Implementation of a dedicated central venous access line team during a pandemic or other health care crisis is a way by which physicians trained in central venous access can contribute their expertise to a stressed health care system. A line team composed of physicians with vascular skill sets provides relief to resource-constrained intensive care unit, ward, and emergency medicine teams with a low rate of iatrogenic complications relative to historical reports. We recommend that a plan for central venous access line team implementation be in place for future health care crises.","Chun, Tristen T; Judelson, Dejah R; Rigberg, David; Lawrence, Peter F; Cuff, Robert; Shalhub, Sherene; Wohlauer, Max; Abularrage, Christopher J; Anastasios, Papapetrou; Arya, Shipra; Aulivola, Bernadette; Baldwin, Melissa; Baril, Donald; Bechara, Carlos F; Beckerman, William E; Behrendt, Christian-Alexander; Benedetto, Filippo; Bennett, Lisa F; Charlton-Ouw, Kristofer M; Chawla, Amit; Chia, Matthew C; Cho, Sungsin; Choong, Andrew M T L; Chou, Elizabeth L; Christiana, Anastasiadou; Coscas, Raphael; De Caridi, Giovanni; Ellozy, Sharif; Etkin, Yana; Faries, Peter; Fung, Adrian T; Gonzalez, Andrew; Griffin, Claire L; Guidry, London; Gunawansa, Nalaka; Gwertzman, Gary; Han, Daniel K; Hicks, Caitlin W; Hinojosa, Carlos A; Hsiang, York; Ilonzo, Nicole; Jayakumar, Lalithapriya; Joh, Jin Hyun; Johnson, Adam P; Kabbani, Loay S; Keller, Melissa R; Khashram, Manar; Koleilat, Issam; Krueger, Bernard; Kumar, Akshay",J Vasc Surg,287,33

The purpose of this study was to understand the visible and invisible potential challenges being faced by the 1st year medical and dental students while attending digital anatomy classes. METHODS: The present study was conducted on 81st year medical and dental students who were admitted to their respective college in August 2019 and were willing to participate in the study. A multiple choice close-ended questionnaire regarding their opinion on virtual classes was designed and feedback was taken from the students. RESULTS: Majority (65%) of the students agreed that they missed their traditional anatomy learning i.e., dissection courses, face to face lectures and interaction with mentors. The students strongly felt the lack of confidence and difficulty in the topics completed without dissections, models, microscopic slides and other modalities. 83% felt lack of proper gadgets, high-band width and strong internet connections, a potential barrier in their digital learning. Lack of self-motivation was felt by 69% students. CONCLUSIONS: The current situation of anatomy education is not intentional, and is not the long term silver bullet solution for a visual subject like anatomy. Though learners face a lot of challenges, however, a shift to online must be supported at this time of health crisis. As the digital learning may go for indefinite period, the feedback of students may be helpful for relevant and timely modifications in digital anatomy education.","Singal, Anjali; Bansal, Agam; Chaudhary, Priti; Singh, Harsimranjit; Patra, Apurba",Surg Radiol Anat,287,10

The transcription factor nuclear factor-&#954;B (NF-&#954;B) modulates the functions of the immune cells and alters the gene expression profile of different cytokines in response to various pathogenic stimuli, while many proinflammatory factors have been known to induce NF-&#954;B signalling cascade. Besides, NF-&#954;B has been known to potentiate the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) leading to apoptosis in various tissues in many diseases and viral infections. Though the reports on the involvement of the NF-&#954;B signalling pathway in COVID-19 are limited, the therapeutic benefits of NF-&#954;B inhibitors including dexamethasone, a synthetic form of glucocorticoid, have increasingly been realized. Considering the fact, the abnormal activation of the NF-&#954;B resulting from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection might be associated with the pathogenic profile of immune cells, cytokine storm and multiorgan defects. Thus, the pharmacological inactivation of the NF-&#954;B signalling pathway can strongly represent a potential therapeutic target to treat the symptomatology of COVID-19. This article signifies pharmacological blockade of the phosphorylation of inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa B kinase subunit beta (IKKß), a key downstream effector of NF-&#954;B signalling, for a therapeutic consideration to attenuate COVID-19.","Kandasamy, Mahesh",Naunyn Schmiedebergs Arch Pharmacol,287,6

METHODOLOGY: The device consists of a rigid translucent acrylic structure (methyl polymethacrylate), adjusted to the dental chair, involving the patient's head, neck and chest. There is also a piping system to generate negative pressure, for aspiration and filtering of the air inside the device chamber. The operator works through small holes in the acrylic structure, to reduce contact with the microparticles arising from aerosols during dental procedures. Simulated dental procedures using a fluorescent dye in the water of the dental equipment were carried out, with and without the use of the device. The presence of the dye was analysed at various locations, such as on personal protective equipment (PPE), the dental chair and on the clinic floor. RESULTS: In the simulated dental procedure without the device, the dye was obvious on surgical gloves, aprons (waist, chest, legs, fists) and face shields, as well as on the dental chair (backrest, light reflector) and clinic floor. In the simulated dental procedure using the device, the dye was observed only on surgical gloves, apron (fists), inside the pipe system and internal walls of the acrylic chamber. There was a certain limitation of movement and visualization by the dentist whilst using the device. CONCLUSIONS: The present device is a low-cost complementary resource for use in conjunction with standard PPE, to reduce the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in the dental setting. Further clinical trials should be carried out to test the efficacy of this device to reduce aerosol dispersion and the consequent vector of contamination, as well as the ergonomic impacts related to its use.","Teichert-Filho, R; Baldasso, C N; Campos, M M; Gomes, M S",Int Endod J,287,20

METHODS: A geographic information system was used to integrate, map, and analyze SARS-CoV-2 testing data reported by LAC DPH, and data from the American Community Survey. Structural determinants included race/ethnicity, poverty, insurance status, education, population and household density. We examined which factors were associated with positivity rates, using a 5% test positivity threshold, with spatial analysis and spatial regression. RESULTS: Between 1 March and 30 June 2020 there were 843,440 SARS-CoV-2 tests and 86,383 diagnoses reported, for an overall positivity rate of 10.2% within the study area. Communities with high proportions of Latino/a residents, those living below the federal poverty line and with high household densities had higher crude positivity rates. Age- adjusted diagnosis rates were significantly associated with the proportion of Latino/as, individuals living below the poverty line, population, and household density. CONCLUSIONS: There are significant local variations in test positivity within LAC and several socio-structural determinants contribute to ongoing disparities. Public health interventions, beyond shelter in place, are needed to address and target such disparities.","Vijayan, Tara; Shin, Michael; Adamson, Paul C; Harris, Christina; Seeman, Teresa; Norris, Keith C; Goodman-Meza, David",Clin. infect. dis,287,1

METHODS: Using a structured strategy, the PubMed and Ovid:Embase databases were queried for articles about the clinical presentation and pathophysiology of coronavirus infections in the nervous system of children and young adults, aged 0 to 24 years. RESULTS: Of 2302 articles reviewed, 31 described SARS-CoV-2 infections in the nervous system of children and 21 described other human coronaviruses: HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-1. Excepting MERS-CoV, we found cases of neurological disease in children from each human coronavirus. Children with non-SARS-CoV-2 infections have suffered acute flaccid paralysis, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, encephalitis, and seizures. In addition, cases of ischemic, hemorrhagic, and microvascular strokes have occurred in children with SARS-CoV-2. Patients with multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children have suffered encephalitis, stroke, pseudotumor cerebri syndrome, and cytotoxic lesions of deep brain structures. Despite these reports, few articles evaluated the impact of human coronavirus infections on long-term neurodevelopmental domains including cognitive, language, academic, motor, and psychosocial outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Neurological manifestations of human coronavirus infections can cause severe disease in children. The case literature suggests a critical gap in knowledge of the long-term effects on child neurodevelopment of these infections. As the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic continues, this gap must be filled to facilitate optimal outcomes in recovering children.","Singer, Timothy G; Evankovich, Karen D; Fisher, Kristen; Demmler-Harrison, Gail J; Risen, Sarah R",Pediatr Neurol,287,11

The number of deaths associated with COVID-19 is often used as a key indicator for the size of the epidemic, but the observed number of deaths represents only a minority of all infections1,2. In addition, the heterogeneous burdens in nursing homes and the variable reporting of deaths of older individuals can hinder direct comparisons of mortality rates and the underlying levels of transmission across countries3. Here we use age-specific COVID-19-associated death data from 45 countries and the results of 22 seroprevalence studies to investigate the consistency of infection and fatality patterns across multiple countries. We find that the age distribution of deaths in younger age groups (less than 65 years of age) is very consistent across different settings and demonstrate how these data can provide robust estimates of the share of the population that has been infected. We estimate that the infection fatality ratio is lowest among 5-9-year-old children, with a log-linear increase by age among individuals older than 30 years. Population age structures and heterogeneous burdens in nursing homes explain some but not all of the heterogeneity between countries in infection fatality ratios. Among the 45 countries included in our analysis, we estimate that approximately 5% of these populations had been infected by 1 September 2020, and that much higher transmission rates have probably occurred in a number of Latin American countries. This simple modelling framework can help countries to assess the progression of the pandemic and can be applied in any scenario for which reliable age-specific death data are available.","O039,; Driscoll, Megan; Ribeiro Dos Santos, Gabriel; Wang, Lin; Cummings, Derek A T; Azman, Andrew S; Paireau, Juliette; Fontanet, Arnaud; Cauchemez, Simon; Salje, Henrik",Nature (Lond.),287,21

According to the COR theory, critical events (e.g., the coronavirus epidemic) make people fearful of losing their valuable resources. A prolonged state of anxiety may lead to sleeping troubles, which over time results in an increase in exhaustion. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Data were collected from 440 Polish healthcare providers, including nurses and midwives, doctors, paramedics, medical assistance workers, and wardens. Three measures were used: the Coronavirus Anxiety Scale, the Copenhagen Psychosocial Questionnaire (the sleeping trouble subscale) and the Oldenburg Burnout Inventory (the exhaustion subscale). Hypotheses were tested using structural equation modeling. RESULTS: The obtained results fully support the hypotheses. Both the direct and indirect relationships between coronavirus anxiety and exhaustion were observed. Specifically, high coronavirus anxiety increased insomnia, which in turn contributed to the development of exhaustion. CONCLUSIONS: The results are consistent with the COR theory. Prolonged coronavirus anxiety and sleeping problems depleted healthcare providers' resources and made them feel exhausted. Exhaustion among these workers can have serious consequences not only for themselves but also for the health of their patients. Therefore, research into effective ways to deal with coronavirus anxiety is needed.","Baka, Lukasz",Int. j. occup. med. environ. health,287,26

People with physical disabilities might be particularly likely to be negatively affected, but evidence is scarce. Our aim was to evaluate the emotional and social experience of older people with physical disabilities during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic in England. METHODS: In this longitudinal cohort study, we analysed data from the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing collected in 2018-19 and June-July, 2020, from participants aged 52 years and older and living in England. Physical disability was defined as impairment in basic and instrumental activities of daily living (ADL) and impaired mobility. Depression, anxiety, loneliness, quality of life, sleep quality, and amount of real-time and written social contact were assessed online or by computer-assisted telephone interviews. Comparisons of experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic of people with and without a physical disability were adjusted statistically for pre-pandemic outcome measures, age, sex, wealth, ethnicity, presence of a spouse or partner, number of people in the household, and chronic pain. All participants with full data available for both surveys were included in the analyses. FINDINGS: Between June 3 and July 26, 2020, 5820 participants responded, 4887 of whom had full data available for both the pre-pandemic measures and the COVID-19 survey and were included in the analysis. During the COVID-19 pandemic, significantly more people with ADL impairment had clinically significant symptoms of depression (odds ratio 1·78 [95% CI 1·44-2·19]; p<0·0001), anxiety (2·23 [1·72-2·89]; p<0·0001), and loneliness (1·52 [1·26-1·84]; p<0·0001) than people without ADL impairment. Significantly more people with ADL impairment also had impaired sleep quality (1·44 [1·20-1·72]; p<0·0001) and poor quality of life than people without ADL impairment. The results were similar when disability was defined by impaired mobility. People with ADL impairment had less frequent real-time contact (0·70 [0·55-0·89]; p=0·0037) and written social contact (0·54 [0·45-0·64]; p<0·0001) with family than people without ADL impairment. Results for social contact were similar when disability was defined by impaired mobility. INTERPRETATION: People with physical disability might be at particular risk for emotional distress, poor quality of life, and low wellbeing during the COVID-19 pandemic, highlighting the need for additional support and targeted mental health services.

Until recently, testing for the SARS-CoV-2 virus focused mainly on healthcare and care home settings. As such, there is far less understanding of community transmission. Protocol: The REal-time Assessment of Community Transmission (REACT) programme is a major programme of home testing for COVID-19 to track progress of the infection in the community. REACT-1 involves cross-sectional surveys of viral detection (virological swab for RT-PCR) tests in repeated samples of 100,000 to 150,000 randomly selected individuals across England. This examines how widely the virus has spread and how many people are currently infected. The age range is 5 years and above. Individuals are sampled from the England NHS patient list. REACT-2 is a series of five sub-studies towards establishing the seroprevalence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in England as an indicator of historical infection. The main study (study 5) uses the same design and sampling approach as REACT-1 using a self-administered lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) test for IgG antibodies in repeated samples of 100,000 to 200,000 adults aged 18 years and above. To inform study 5, studies 1-4 evaluate performance characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 LFIAs (study 1) and different aspects of feasibility, usability and application of LFIAs for home-based testing in different populations (studies 2-4). Ethics and dissemination: The study has ethical approval. Results are reported using STROBE guidelines and disseminated through reports to public health bodies, presentations at scientific meetings and open access publications. Conclusions: This study provides robust estimates of the prevalence of both virus (RT-PCR, REACT-1) and seroprevalence (antibody, REACT-2) in the general population in England. We also explore acceptability and usability of LFIAs for self-administered testing for SARS-CoV-2 antibody in a home-based setting, not done before at such scale in the general population. © 2021 Riley S et al.","Elliott, P.; Riley, S.; Atchison, C.; Ashby, D.; Donnelly, C.

METHODS: Prospective study based on the SNOT-22, item ""sense of smell or taste"" and additional outcomes. RESULTS: 268/315 patients (85.1%) completing the survey at baseline also completed the follow-up interview. The 12 months prevalence of self-reported COVID-19 associated chemosensory dysfunction was 21.3% (95% CI 16.5-26.7%). Of the 187 patients who complained of COVID-19 associated chemosensory dysfunction at baseline, 130 (69.5%; 95% CI 62.4-76.0%) reported complete resolution of smell or taste impairment, 41 (21.9%) reported a decrease in the severity, and 16 (8.6%) reported the symptom was unchanged or worse 1 year after onset.

Since then, the search for a vaccine or drug for COVID-19 treatment has started worldwide. In this regard, a fast approach is the repurposing of drugs, primarily antiviral drugs. Herein, we performed a virtual screening using 22 antiviral drugs retrieved from the DrugBank repository, azithromycin (antibiotic), ivermectin (antinematode), and seven non-structural proteins (Nsps) of SARS-CoV-2, which are considered important targets for drugs, via molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations. Drug-receptor binding energy was employed as the main descriptor. Based on the results, paritaprevir was predicted as a promising multi-target drug that favorably bound to all tested Nsps, mainly adipose differentiation-related protein (ADRP) (-36.2 kcal mol-1) and coronavirus main proteinase (Mpro) (-32.2 kcal mol-1). Moreover, the results suggest that simeprevir is a strong inhibitor of Mpro (-37.2 kcal mol-1), which is an interesting finding because Mpro plays an important role in viral replication. In addition to drug-receptor affinity, hot spot residues were characterized to facilitate the design of new drug derivatives with improved biological responses.","Nunes, Vinicius S; Paschoal, Diego F S; Costa, Luiz Antônio S; Santos, Hélio F Dos",J Biomol Struct Dyn,287,1

This is the first paper to model the technical efficiency of countries in managing the COVID-19 pandemic by modeling death rates and infection rates as undesirable outputs using the approach developed by You and Yan. We find that the average efficiency of global healthcare systems in managing the pandemic is very low, with only six efficient systems out of a total of 36 under the variable returns to scale assumption. This finding suggests that, holding constant the size of their healthcare systems (because countries cannot alter the size of a healthcare system in the short run), most of the sample countries showed low levels of efficiency during this time of managing the pandemic; instead it is suspected that most countries literally ""threw"" resources at fighting the pandemic, thereby probably raising inefficiency through wasted resource use.","Breitenbach, Marthinus C; Ngobeni, Victor; Aye, Goodness C",Front Public Health,287,22

The task force used different collaborative channels to redistribute resources and expertise to the hospital. Leading doctors from the departments of infectious diseases, critical care and pulmonology developed standardized guidelines for treatment coherence. Nurses from the infection control team provided regular training on donning and doffing of personal protective equipment and basic safety measures. Findings: Keimyung University Daegu Dongsan hospital became a red zone hospital for COVID-19 patients on 21 February 2020.

A random forest classifier with spectral densities of linear acceleration and angular velocity was built to classify head impact types (e.g., football), reaching a median accuracy of 96% over 1,000 random partitions of training and test sets. To test the classifier on data from different measurement devices, another 271 lab-reconstructed impacts were obtained from 5 other instrumented mouthguards with the classifier reaching over 96% accuracy. The most important features in the classification included both low-frequency and high-frequency features, both linear acceleration features and angular velocity features. Different head impact types had different distributions of spectral densities in low-frequency and high-frequency ranges (e.g., the spectral densities of MMA impacts were higher in high-frequency range than in the low-frequency range). Finally, with the classifier, type-specific, nearest-neighbor regression models were built for 95th percentile maximum principal strain, 95th percentile maximum principal strain in corpus callosum, and cumulative strain damage (15th percentile). This showed a generally higher R2-value than baseline models.

Military personnel are especially at risk for infectious diseases; thus, patient selection with an evidence-based prognostic model is critical for them. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to assess the usability of a novel platform used in the military hospitals in Korea to gather data and deploy patient selection solutions for COVID-19. METHODS: The platform's structure was developed to provide users with prediction results and to use the data to enhance the prediction models. Two applications were developed: a patient's application and a physician's application. The primary outcome was requiring an oxygen supplement. The outcome prediction model was developed with patients from four centers. A Cox proportional hazards model was developed. The outcome of the model for the patient's application was the length of time from the date of hospitalization to the date of the first oxygen supplement use. The demographic characteristics, past history, patient symptoms, social history, and body temperature were considered as risk factors. A usability study with the Post-Study System Usability Questionnaire (PSSUQ) was conducted on the physician's application on 50 physicians. RESULTS: The patient's application and physician's application were deployed on the web for wider availability. A total of 246 patients from four centers were used to develop the outcome prediction model. A small percentage (n=18, 7.32%) of the patients needed professional care. The variables included in the developed prediction model were age; body temperature; predisease physical status; history of cardiovascular disease; hypertension; visit to a region with an outbreak; and symptoms of chills, feverishness, dyspnea, and lethargy. The overall C statistic was 0.963 (95% CI 0.936-0.99), and the time-dependent area under the receiver operating characteristic curve ranged from 0.976 at day 3 to 0.979 at day 9. The usability of the physician's application was good, with an overall average of the responses to the PSSUQ being 2.2 (SD 1.1). CONCLUSIONS: The platform introduced in this study enables evidence-based patient selection in an effortless and timely manner, which is critical in the military. With a well-designed user experience and an accurate prediction model, this platform may help save lives and contain the spread of the novel virus, COVID-19.","Heo, JoonNyung; Park, Ji Ae; Han, Deokjae; Kim, Hyung-Jun; Ahn, Daeun; Ha, Beomman; Seog, Woong; Park, Yu Rang",J Med Internet Res,287,26

Objective: To develop and validate a clinical score at hospital admission for predicting which patients with COVID-19 will develop critical illness based on a nationwide cohort in China. Design, Setting, and Participants: Collaborating with the National Health Commission of China, we established a retrospective cohort of patients with COVID-19 from 575 hospitals in 31 provincial administrative regions as of January 31, 2020. Epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and imaging variables ascertained at hospital admission were screened using Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) and logistic regression to construct a predictive risk score (COVID-GRAM). The score provides an estimate of the risk that a hospitalized patient with COVID-19 will develop critical illness. Accuracy of the score was measured by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Data from 4 additional cohorts in China hospitalized with COVID-19 were used to validate the score. Data were analyzed between February 20, 2020 and March 17, 2020. Main Outcomes and Measures: Among patients with COVID-19 admitted to the hospital, critical illness was defined as the composite measure of admission to the intensive care unit, invasive ventilation, or death. Results: The development cohort included 1590 patients. the mean (SD) age of patients in the cohort was 48.9 (15.7) years; 904 (57.3%) were men. The validation cohort included 710 patients with a mean (SD) age of 48.2 (15.2) years, and 382 (53.8%) were men and 172 (24.2%). From 72 potential predictors, 10 variables were independent predictive factors and were included in the risk score: chest radiographic abnormality (OR, 3.39; 95% CI, 2.14-5.38), age (OR, 1.03; 95% CI, 1.01-1.05), hemoptysis (OR, 4.53; 95% CI, 1.36-15.15), dyspnea (OR, 1.88; 95% CI, 1.18-3.01), unconsciousness (OR, 4.71; 95% CI, 1.39-15.98), number of comorbidities (OR, 1.60; 95% CI, 1.27-2.00), cancer history (OR, 4.07; 95% CI, 1.23-13.43), neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (OR, 1.06; 95% CI, 1.02-1.10), lactate dehydrogenase (OR, 1.002; 95% CI, 1.001-1.004) and direct bilirubin (OR, 1.15; 95% CI, 1.06-1.24). The mean AUC in the development cohort was 0.88 (95% CI, 0.85-0.91) and the AUC in the validation cohort was 0.88 (95% CI, 0.84-0.93). The score has been translated into an online risk calculator that is freely available to the public (http://118.126.104.170/). Conclusions and Relevance: In this study, a risk score based on characteristics of COVID-19 patients at the time of admission to the hospital was developed that may help predict a patient's risk of developing critical illness.","Liang, Wenhua; Liang, Hengrui; Ou, Limin; Chen, Binfeng; Chen, Ailan; Li, Caichen; Li, Yimin; Guan, Weijie; Sang, Ling; Lu, Jiatao; Xu, Yuanda; Chen, Guoqiang; Guo, Haiyan; Guo, Jun; Chen, Zisheng; Zhao, Yi; Li, Shiyue; Zhang, Nuofu; Zhong, Nanshan; He, Jianxing",JAMA Intern Med,287,20

We aimed to explore the predictive value of risk factors during hospitalization (T0) for COVID-19 for anxiety, depression and PTSD and at three months (T1) because they could differ over these two time points. METHODS: We performed a screening of mental suffering in hospitalized patients for COVID-19, as well as specialized care and three months longitudinal follow-up. We evaluated at T0 and at T1 the prevalence of anxiety, depression and PTSD in survivors who benefited from early detection and treatment, and assessed possible risk factors in adults surviving COVID-19 between the 30th March and the 1st of July 2020. RESULTS: 109 patients were screened at T0 and 61 of these were reassessed at T1. At T0, we found 44.9% pathological score on peritraumatic dissociation experiences questionnaire (PDEQ), 85.4% of post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms (PTSS), 14.6% of pathological rate of post-traumatic stress disorder scale 5 (PCL5) and at T1, 86.9% of PTSS, 10.6% of pathological rate of PCL5. Finally, PDEQ score at T0 during hospitalization was positively correlated to PCL-5 score at T1 (ß = 0.26, p = 0.01) and that was confirmed in multivariate analysis (ß = 0.04, p = 0.02 for the log of PCL-5 per point on the PDEQ). CONCLUSION: Screening of psychiatric symptoms during hospitalization for COVID-19 should be systematic, especially peritraumatic dissociation to offer an early treatment and prevent PTSD, which seemed frequent for hospitalized patients for COVID-19 at three months.","Benzakour, Lamyae; Braillard, Olivia; Mazzola, Viridiana; Gex, Dominique; Nehme, Mayssam; Perone, Sigiryia Aebischer; Agoritsas, Thomas; Kopp, Garance; Sara, Cereghetti; Bondolfi, Guido; Lador, Frederic",J Psychiatr Res,287,1

The dynamic nature of the component elements of wind farms and considering the risks interdependencies motivate this combination. A questionnaire survey targeting experts is conducted for calculating the modified Risk Priority Numbers (RPNs). Thirty-four factors are ranked, and the nine critical risks identified as “Political instability”, “Sanctions”, “Economic insecurity”, “Interest rate fluctuations”, “Exchange rate fluctuations”, “Inflation rate fluctuations”, “Feasibility risk”, “Shortage of capital risk”, and “Supplier risk”. The values of RPNT = 260.26, RPNC = 251.31, and RPNQ = 238.77 indicate that “Exchange rate fluctuations” is the most important critical risk. The second one, is “Political instability” with RPNT = 255.35, RPNC = 247.28, and RPNQ = 230.56. The simulation results of a 50 MW wind farm reveal, with a 90% confidence level, “Sanctions” would cause 43.9% increase in project execution time and 28% decrease in project quality, and “Shortage of capital risk” has the greatest impact on project cost, with a 25.79% increase. This work further proposes several strategies to respond to the CRs and concludes that investments in REs can support post-COVID-19 economic recovery. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Zeinalnezhad, M.; Chofreh, A.

It is essential to develop diagnostic tests that can quickly identify infected individuals to limit the spread of the virus and assign treatment options. Herein, we report a proof-of-concept label-free electrochemical immunoassay for the rapid detection of SARS-CoV-2 virus via the spike surface protein. The assay consists of a graphene working electrode functionalized with anti-spike antibodies. The concept of the immunosensor is to detect the signal perturbation obtained from ferri/ferrocyanide measurements after binding of the antigen during 45 min of incubation with a sample. The absolute change in the [Fe(CN)6]3-/4- current upon increasing antigen concentrations on the immunosensor surface was used to determine the detection range of the spike protein. The sensor was able to detect a specific signal above 260 nM (20 µg/mL) of subunit 1 of recombinant spike protein. Additionally, it was able to detect SARS-CoV-2 at a concentration of 5.5 × 105 PFU/mL, which is within the physiologically relevant concentration range. The novel immunosensor has a significantly faster analysis time than the standard qPCR and is operated by a portable device which can enable on-site diagnosis of infection.","Mojsoska, Biljana; Larsen, Sylvester; Olsen, Dorte Aalund; Madsen, Jonna Skov; Brandslund, Ivan; Alatraktchi, Fatima AlZahra039",Sensors (Basel),287,4

However, research into PC and unhealthy food choice, a key health behaviour, still remains relatively unexplored. In the current pilot investigation, 284 participants were recruited to take part in an online food choice paradigm before completing the Perseverative Thinking Questionnaire (PTQ) and the Brief State Rumination Inventory (BSRI). As a reduced availability of unhealthy snacks has been shown to improve snack choice, participants were randomly allocated to either an even condition (a 3:3 ratio of &#8804;99 kcal and &#8805;199 kcal snacks) or an uneven condition (a 4:2 ratio in favour of &#8804;99 kcal snacks). It was hypothesized that higher levels of PC may predict greater instances of poorer snack choices across, or even within, this paradigm. Despite an increase availability of lower calorie snacks leading to a healthier snack choice, both state and trait PC measures did not significantly influence snack choice irrespective of this varying availability. Although, marginal trends were found for higher state PC and higher calorie crisp selections. The current pilot therefore adds to the growing literature advocating for the use of behavioural economic tactics to engender healthier food choices, yet further work is needed to unpick the mediating role of PC (and its components) in snack consumption paradigms.","Eschle, Timothy M; McCarrick, Dane",,287,33

This study examined the effects of COVID-19 on male sex work globally and investigated how men who sold sex responded to and engaged with the virus in the context of work. METHODS: This study made use of an existing database of deidentified data extracted from the online profiles maintained by male sex workers on a large, international website. Website engagement metrics were calculated for the periods before (September to December 2019) and during COVID-19 (January to May 2020); Poisson regression analyses were used to assess changes over time before and after, while a content analysis was undertaken to identify modes of engagement with the virus. RESULTS: Data were collected from 78 399 profiles representing 19 388 individuals. In the 'before' period, the number of active profiles was stable (inter-rate ratio (IRR)=1.01, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.01, p=0.339) but during COVID-19 decreased by 26.3% (IRR=0.90, 95% CI 0.89 to 0.91, p<0.001). Newly created profiles also decreased during COVID-19 (59.4%; IRR=0.71, 95% CI 0.69 to 0.74, p<0.001) after a period of stability. In total, 211 unique profiles explicitly referenced COVID-19; 185 (85.8%) evoked risk reduction strategies, including discontinuation of in-person services (41.2%), pivoting to virtual services (38.9%), COVID-19 status disclosure (20.9%), enhanced sanitary and screening requirements (12.3%) and restricted travel (5.2%). Some profiles, however, seemed to downplay the seriousness of COVID-19 or resist protective measures (14.7%). CONCLUSIONS: These findings support the contention that COVID-19 has dramatically impacted the sex industry; globally, male sex workers may be facing considerable economic strain. Targeted education and outreach are needed to support male sex workers grappling with COVID-19, including around the most effective risk reduction strategies. Those involved with the sex industry must have access to state-sponsored COVID-19 financial and other aid programmes to support individual and public health.","Callander, Denton; Meunier, Étienne; DeVeau, Ryan; Grov, Christian; Donovan, Basil; Minichiello, Victor; Kim, Jules; Duncan, Dustin",Sex. transm. infect,287,16

Obviously, OERs have high-potential to satisfy learners in many different circumstances, as they are available in a wide range of contexts. However, the low-quality of OER metadata, in general, is one of the main reasons behind the lack of personalised services such as search and recommendation. As a result, the applicability of OERs remains limited. Nevertheless, OER metadata about covered topics (subjects) is essentially required by learners to build effective learning pathways towards their individual learning objectives. Therefore, in this paper, we report on a work in progress project proposing an OER topic extraction approach, applying text mining techniques, to generate high-quality OER metadata about topic distribution. This is done by: 1) collecting 123 lectures from Coursera and Khan Academy in the area of data science related skills, 2) applying Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) on the collected resources in order to extract existing topics related to these skills, and 3) defining topic distributions covered by a particular OER. To evaluate our model, we used the data-set of educational resources from Youtube, and compared our topic distribution results with their manually defined target topics with the help of 3 experts in the area of data science. As a result, our model extracted topics with 79% of F1-score.","Molavi, Mohammadreza; Tavakoli, Mohammadreza; Kismih'ok, G'abor",,287,16

This study aimed to measure the level of mental health of the Malaysian public approximately 2 months after the pandemic's onset. Between 12 May and 5 September 2020, an anonymous online survey was conducted. The target group included all members of the Malaysian population aged 18 years and above. The Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS-21) was used to assess mental health. There were increased depressive, anxiety and stress symptoms throughout the study period, with the depression rates showing the greatest increase. During the end of the data collection period (4 August-5 September 2020), there were high percentages of reported depressive (59.2%) and anxiety (55.1%) symptoms compared with stress (30.6%) symptoms. Perceived health status was the strongest significant predictor for depressive and anxiety symptoms. Individuals with a poorer health perception had higher odds of developing depression (odds ratio [OR] = 5.68; 95% confidence interval [CI] 3.81-8.47) and anxiety (OR = 3.50; 95%CI 2.37-5.17) compared with those with a higher health perception. By demographics, young people-particularly students, females and people with poor financial conditions-were more vulnerable to mental health symptoms.

METHODS: An anonymous online survey was launched on March 24, 2020 in Brazil to assess how families with children aged up to 12 years are adjusting their daily routines to this situation. In the survey, each family reported the daily time each child spent in sedentary activity (sum of intellectual activities, play time on screen, playing without PA) and PA (sum of playing with PA and PA). RESULTS: The main findings based on data from 816 children indicate that most parents consider there was a reduction in the time that children spend practicing PA; increase in screen play time and family activities, differences between sex were found regarding screen play time (boys>girls) and in playing without PA (girls>boys), and there was an age effect for all categories analyzed, with a tendency to increase the total time of sedentary lifestyle and complementary reducing the time of PA over age. CONCLUSIONS: The household routines of families during the period of social isolation resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic confirm the general reduction tendency in PA time during childhood.","Sá, Cristina Dos Santos Cardoso de; Pombo, André; Luz, Carlos; Rodrigues, Luis Paulo; Cordovil, Rita",Rev Paul Pediatr,287,23

Experiments suggest that structural rearrangements dramatically enhance CoV2019 activity. We identify a new first stage of infection that precedes structural rearrangements by using biomolecular evolutionary theory to identify sequence differences enhancing viral attachment rates. We find a small cluster of mutations which show that CoV-2 has a new feature that promotes much stronger viral attachment and enhances contagiousness. The extremely dangerous dynamics of human coronavirus infection is a dramatic example of evolutionary approach of self-organized networks to criticality. It may favor a very successful vaccine.

Although previous studies reported a lower rate of death in patients treated with heparin, the potential benefit of chronic oral anticoagulation therapy (OAT) remains unknown. We aimed to investigate the association between OAT with the risk of ARDS and mortality in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. METHODS: This is a multicenter retrospective Italian study including consecutive patients hospitalized for COVID-19 from March 1 to April 22, 2020, at six Italian hospitals. Patients were divided into two groups according to the chronic assumption of oral anticoagulants. RESULTS: Overall, 427 patients were included; 87 patients (19%) were in the OAT group. Of them, 54 patients (13%) were on treatment with non-vitamin k oral anticoagulants (NOACs) and 33 (8%) with vitamin-K antagonists (VKAs). OAT patients were older and had a higher rate of hypertension, diabetes, and coronary artery disease compared to No-OAT group. The rate of ARDS at admission (26% vs 28%, P=0.834), or developed during the hospitalization (9% vs 10%, P=0.915), was similar between study groups; in-hospital mortality (22% vs 26%, P=0.395) was also comparable. After balancing for potential confounders by using the propensity score matching technique, no differences were found in term of clinical outcome between OAT and No-OAT patients CONCLUSION: Oral anticoagulation therapy, either NOACs or VKAs, did not influence the risk of ARDS or death in patients hospitalized with COVID-19.","Russo, Vincenzo; Bottino, Roberta; D039,; Andrea, Antonello; Silverio, Angelo; Di Maio, Marco; Golino, Paolo; Nigro, Gerardo; Valsecchi, Orazio; Attena, Emilio; Canonico, Mario Enrico; Galasso, Gennaro; Parodi, Guido; Scudiero, Fernando",Cardiovasc. drugs ther,287,2

Using an agent-based model, we explore one of the technology-based strategies proposed, a contact-tracing smartphone app. The model simulates the spread of COVID-19 in a population of agents on an urban scale. Agents are heterogeneous in their characteristics and are linked in a multi-layered network representing the social structure - including households, friendships, employment and schools. We explore the interplay of various adoption rates of the contact-tracing app, different levels of testing capacity, and behavioural factors, to assess the ability of this track-and-trace strategy to mitigate the epidemic. Results suggest that the app can contribute substantially to the reduction of infections in the population, although complete suppression of the virus is unlikely to be achieved. The model also shows that, while adopting the app is beneficial for epidemic control in most cases, a high adoption rate is likely to generate an extensive increase in the demand for testing, which, if not met with adequate supply, may render the app counterproductive. This points to the crucial role of an efficient testing policy and the necessity to upscale testing capacity.","Almagor, Jonatan; Picascia, Stefano",,287,1

The primary objective of this study was to describe EM clerkship directors' (CDs) perspectives on their experience adapting an EM VR curriculum during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: A 21-item survey with quantitative and qualitative questions was disseminated between June and August 2020 to EM CDs via the Clerkship Director of Emergency Medicine (CDEM) Listserv to describe their experience and perspectives in adapting a VR during the spring of 2020. Results: We analyzed 59 out of 77 EM clerkship survey responses. Among respondents, 52% adapted a VR while 47.5% did not. Of those who adapted a VR, 71% of CDs had 2 weeks or less to develop the new curriculum, with 84% reporting usual or increased clinical load during that time. Clerkships significantly diversified their asynchronous educational content and utilized several instructional models to substitute the loss of clinical experience. Reflecting on the experience, 71% of CDs did not feel comfortable writing a standardized letter of evaluation for students based on the VR, with the majority citing inability to evaluate students' competencies in a clinical context. Conclusion: A crisis, such as COVID-19 necessitates change in all facets of medical education. While EM educators demonstrated the ability to create emergency remote learning with limited time, this was not equivalent to the formal development of pre-planned VR experiences. Future faculty development and curriculum innovation are required to fully transition an in-person immersive experience to a non-inferior virtual experience.","Ren, Ronnie; Parekh, Kendra; Franzen, Doug; Estes, Molly; Camejo, Melanie; Olaf, Mark; Zhang, Xiao Chi",AEM Educ Train,287,1

Most patients have a mild form of disease and often recover at home over a period of weeks. For some, the highest morbidity of COVID-19 may not be associated with the acute phase of the disease, but rather the longstanding post-viral pulmonary fibrosis. Case Description: A 49-year-old man with a past medical history of coronary artery disease, obstructive sleep apnea, hypertension, and type two diabetes mellitus presented to the emergency department with a four-day history of fever, nausea, and diarrhea. He denied cough or dyspnea. Chest radiograph revealed bibasilar ground glass opacifications. He was positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 by polymerase chain reaction testing. His oxygen saturation was 95% on room air and he was discharged home without treatment. Over the following days, he developed a dry cough and mild dyspnea, but he did not desaturate on room air. He was prescribed a short course of steroids by his outpatient pulmonologist. He gradually improved over the course of two weeks and he was never hospitalized. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest 10 weeks after diagnosis revealed bilateral patchy ground glass opacities in all lobes and interstitial components with architectural distortion in the lower lobes (Image 1). A pulmonary function test performed 12 weeks after diagnosis showed an FVC 83%, FEV1 85%, TLC 75%, RV 37%, and DCLO 88%. The patient continued to experience mild dyspnea with exertion 2 months after the resolution of the infection. Conclusion: Pulmonary fibrosis is not a post-viral phenomenon limited to severe cases of COVID-19 and can occur following mild presentations managed at home. Thus far, risk factors for the development of pulmonary fibrosis secondary to COVID-19 have been reported to be advanced age, disease severity, length of intensive care unit stay, smoking, and alcoholism. Our case report calls for a re-evaluation of these risk factors. While pharmaceutical treatments are typically only administered to hospitalized patients, there may be basis for treating mild cases with the intent of preventing post-viral pulmonary fibrosis. Further, outpatient clinicians may consider monitoring for changes in pulmonary architecture with pulmonary function tests or high-resolution CT scans in all recovered COVID-19 patients regardless of symptom severity.","Reddy, R.; Chen, K.; Wellikoff, A.",American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine,287,1

During the last months, the scientific community has been debating on the potential harmful effect of Angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) or Angiotensin II receptor Type 1 receptor blockers (AT1-Receptor blockers, ARBs) during the COVID-19 pandemic. That is because the S spike protein of SARS8 CoV viruses utilizes the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a receptor to enter alveolar epithelial cells. Obesity, often associated to type 2 Diabetes, was shown to worsen the prognosis of SARS-CoV2 infection. Herein we discuss the complex interaction between the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System (RAAS), its receptors, and the interaction with the Kallikrein-Kinin-System (KKS) and the potential activation of the coagulation cascade. Alteration of the equilibrium between the RAAS system and the KKS cascade may explain the frequent thromboembolic complications of COVID-19 mainly seen in obese and diabetic-obese patients. In contrast, angiotensin (1-7) contributes to maintaining a correct balance between RAAS and KKS system. Our conclusion is that the higher mortality rate in patients with obesity is linked to the alteration of RAS and RAS-KKS interaction consequent to SARS-CoV2-cell entrance. At present, no data support the necessity of modifying ACEi or ARBs treatment in hypertensive patients.","Luzi, Livio; Bucciarelli, Loredana; Ferrulli, Anna; Terruzzi, Ileana; Massarini, Stefano",Minerva Endocrinol,287,7

Diabetes/hyperglycemia-triggered endothelial dysfunction and hyperactive inflammatory and immune responses are correlated to twofold to threefold higher intensive care hospitalizations and more than twice the mortality among diabetic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. While comorbidities such as obesity, cardiovascular disease, and hypertension worsen the prognosis of diabetic COVID-19 patients, COVID-19 infections are also associated with new-onset diabetes, severe metabolic complications, and increased thrombotic events in the backdrop of aberrant endothelial function. While several antidiabetic medications are used to manage blood glucose levels, we discuss the multifaceted ability of metformin to control blood glucose levels and possibly attenuate endothelial dysfunction, inhibit viral entry and infection, and modify inflammatory and immune responses during SARS-CoV-2 infections. These actions make metformin a viable candidate drug to be considered for repurposing and gaining ground against the SARS-CoV-2-induced tsunami in diabetic COVID-19 patients.","Samuel, Samson Mathews; Varghese, Elizabeth; Büsselberg, Dietrich",Trends microbiol,287,12

The doubling time is the best indicator of the course of the current COVID-19 pandemic. The aim of the present investigation was to determine the impact of policies and several sociodemographic factors on the COVID-19 doubling time in Mexico. Methods. A retrospective longitudinal study was carried out across March-August, 2020. Policies issued by each of the 32 Mexican states during each week of this period were classified according to the University of Oxford Coronavirus Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT), and the doubling time of COVID-19 cases was calculated. Additionally, variables such as population size and density, poverty and mobility were included. A panel data model was applied to measure the effect of these variables on doubling time. Results. States with larger population sizes issued a larger number of policies. Delay in the issuance of policies was associated with accelerated propagation. The policy index (coefficient 0.60, p < 0.01) and the income per capita (coefficient 3.36, p < 0.01) had a positive effect on doubling time; by contrast, the population density (coefficient -0.012, p < 0.05), the mobility in parks (coefficient -1.10, p < 0.01) and the residential mobility (coefficient -4.14, p < 0.01) had a negative effect. Conclusions. Health policies had an effect on slowing the pandemic's propagation, but population density and mobility played a fundamental role. Therefore, it is necessary to implement policies that consider these variables.","Díaz-Castro, Lina; Cabello-Rangel, Héctor; Hoffman, Kurt",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),287,1

To rapidly reach herd immunity, an affordable, easy to store and versatile vaccine platform is thus desirable. We previously designed a non-infectious adenovirus-inspired nanoparticle (ADDomer), and in the present work, we efficiently decorated this original vaccine platform with glycosylated receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2. Cryo-Electron Microscopy structure revealed that up to 60 copies of this antigenic domain were bound on a single ADDomer particle with the symmetrical arrangements of a dodecahedron. Mouse immunization with the RBD decorated particles showed as early as the first immunization a significant anti-coronavirus humoral response, which was boosted after a second immunization. Neutralization assays with spike pseudo-typed-virus demonstrated the elicitation of strong neutralization titers. Remarkably, the existence of pre-existing immunity against adenoviral-derived particles enhanced the humoral response against SARS-CoV-2. This plug and play vaccine platform revisits the way of using adenovirus to combat emergent pathogens while potentially taking advantage of the adenovirus pre-immunity.","Chevillard, Christopher; Amen, Axelle; Besson, Solene; Hannani, Dalil; Bally, Isabelle; Dettling, Valentin; Gout, Evelyne; Moreau, Christophe J; Buisson, Marlyse; Gallet, Salome; Fenel, Daphna; Vassal-Stermann, Emilie; Schoehn, Guy; Poignard, Pascal; Dagher, Marie-Claire; Fender, Pascal",,287,16

Information about the topic has been provided.Globally, as of mid-May 2020, there have been over 4.4 million confirmed cases of COVID-19. There are two main routes of transmission of COVID-19: respiratory droplets and contact transmission. PFTs are non-invasive tests that are commonly performed in routine assessment and follow-up of patients in the pulmonology units. However, PFTs may generate aerosols and require sharing common surfaces. With regard to the high prevalence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in the community, PFTs should not be performed routinely in confirmed or suspected patients with COVID-19 during the pandemic. Because of the risk of human-to-human transmission of COVID-19, PFTs should be restricted to a small patient population with selected indications. Triage for COVID-19 should be performed prior to testing. Only essential PFTs such as spirometry, diffusion capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide (DLCO), arterial blood gas analysis, or pulse oximetry should be performed in the selected cases. Tests should be scheduled to allow sufficient time for donning and doffing of the technical personnel with the full personal protective equipment (PPE) (gown, a filtering respirator mask, goggles or full-face shield, and disposable gloves), ventilation of the room, and application of post-test cleaning and disinfection procedures of the equipment and the testing room.","Gemicioglu, Bilun; Börekçi, Sermin; Dilektasli, Asli Görek; Ulubay, Gaye; Azap, Özlem; Saryal, Sevgi",Turk Thorac J,287,20

Nonetheless, since its introduction in human populations, SARS-CoV-2 must have been subject to the selective pressure imposed by the human immune system. We exploited the availability of a large number of high-quality SARS-CoV-2 genomes, as well as of validated epitope predictions, to show that B cell epitopes in the spike glycoprotein (S) and in the nucleocapsid protein (N) have higher diversity than nonepitope positions. Similar results were obtained for other human coronaviruses and for sarbecoviruses sampled in bats. Conversely, in the SARS-CoV-2 population, epitopes for CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were not more variable than nonepitope positions. A significant reduction in epitope variability was instead observed for some of the most immunogenic proteins (S, N, ORF8 and ORF3a). Analysis over longer evolutionary time frames indicated that this effect is not due to differential constraints. These data indicate that SARS-CoV-2 evolves to elude the host humoral immune response, whereas recognition by T cells is not actively avoided by the virus. However, we also found a trend of lower diversity of T cell epitopes for common cold coronaviruses, indicating that epitope conservation per se is not directly linked to disease severity. We suggest that conservation serves to maintain epitopes that elicit tolerizing T cell responses or induce T cells with regulatory activity.","Forni, Diego; Cagliani, Rachele; Pontremoli, Chiara; Mozzi, Alessandra; Pozzoli, Uberto; Clerici, Mario; Sironi, Manuela",Mol. ecol,287,16

Given such importance, many challenges emerged in order to collect, manage, process, and publish data. In this sense, personal data have got attention, and many regulations emerged, such as GDPR in the European Union and LGPD in Brazil. This regulation model aims to protect users' data from misusage and leakage and allow users to request an explanation from companies when needed. In pandemic situations, such as the COVID-19 and Ebola outbreak, the action related to sharing health data between different organizations is/ was crucial to develop a significant movement to avoid the massive infection and decrease the number of deaths. However, the data subject, i.e., the users, should have the right to request the purpose of data use, anonymization, and data deletion. In this sense, permissioned blockchain technology emerges to empower users to get their rights providing data ownership, transparency, and security through an immutable, unified, and distributed database ruled by smart contracts. The governance model discussed in blockchain applications is usually regarding the first layer governance, i.e., public and permissioned models. However, this discussion is too superficial, and they do not cover compliance with the data regulations. Therefore, in order to organize the relationship between data owners and the stakeholders, i.e., companies and governmental entities, we developed a second layer data governance model for permissioned blockchains based on the Governance Analytical Framework principles applied in pandemic situations preserving the users' privacy and their duties. From the law perspective, we based our model on the UE GDPR in regard to data privacy concerns.","Alves, Paulo Henrique; Frajhof, Isabella Z.; Correia, Fernando A.; Souza, Clarisse de; Lopes, Helio",,287,16

Functional rehabilitation of infectious COVID-19 patients has been implemented in the acute care wards and in appropriate, ad hoc, multidisciplinary COVID-19 rehabilitation units. However, because COVID-19 rehabilitation units are a clinical novelty, clinical and organizational benchmarks are not yet available. The aim of this study is to describe the organizational needs and operational costs of such a unit, by comparing its activity, organization, and costs with 2 other functional rehabilitation units, in San Raffaele Hospital, Milan, Italy. METHODS: The 2-month activity of the COVID-19 Rehabilitation Unit at San Raffaele Hospital, Milan, Italy, which was created in response to the emergency need for rehabilitation of COVID-19 patients, was compared with the previous year's activity of the Cardiac Rehabilitation and Motor Rehabilitation Units of the same institute. RESULTS: The COVID-19 Rehabilitation Unit had the same number of care beds as the other units, but required twice the amount of staff and instrumental equipment, leading to a deficit in costs. DISCUSSION: The COVID-19 Rehabilitation Unit was twice as expensive as the 2 other units studied. World health systems are organizing to respond to the pandemic by expanding capacity in acute intensive care and sub-intensive care units. This study shows that COVID-19 rehabilitation units must be organized and equiped according to the clinical and rehabilitative needs of patients, following specific measures to prevent the spread of infection amongs patients and workers.","Iannaccone, Sandro; Alemanno, Federica; Houdayer, Elise; Brugliera, Luigia; Castellazzi, Paola; Cianflone, Domenico; Meloni, Carlo; Ambrosio, Alberto; Mortini, Pietro; Spina, Alfio; Filippi, Massimo",J Rehabil Med,287,10

Despite recent advances in telecommunication technologies, the field of orthopedics has been slow to adopt these resources in offsetting barriers to care. The COVID-19 pandemic has forced departments to change their clinical approach, lending unprecedented opportunity to better understand how telehealth may bridge this care gap in foot and ankle practices. The purpose of this study was to assess patient-reported outcomes of telemedicine encounters, including comfort and patient satisfaction. Our hypothesis was that patients would be significantly less satisfied with telemedicine when compared with in-office appointments for all nonemergency visit types. METHODS: Telemedicine satisfaction was assessed via phone survey with a modified 1 to 5 Likert scale. Patients who had completed a telemedicine visit between April 13, 2020, and June 19, 2020, were eligible to participate. Patient demographics were recorded, and data were analyzed using paired and independent t tests for parametric continuous data and Fisher's exact and chi-square tests for noncontinuous data. A total of 216 patients completed the telemedicine questionnaire. RESULTS: The overall mean satisfaction for telemedicine visits (4.7) was significantly lower than that for in-office visits (4.9) (P < .001). However, the majority (90.3%) of patients reported they would use telemedicine again in the future. When compared, patients seeking fracture care had significantly higher telemedicine satisfaction (4.9, n = 38) than those receiving nonfracture care (4.6, n = 178) (P = .001), and those greater than 50 miles from the clinic had higher satisfaction (5.0, n = 14) than patients living within 50 miles of the clinic (4.7, n = 202) (P < .001). CONCLUSION: Patients were more satisfied with their in-office clinic visit than telemedicine, although the vast majority of patients endorsed a willingness to utilize telemedicine in the future. Patients with trauma and greater barriers to foot and ankle care were more satisfied with their telemedicine visits.

There is a significant amount of fear of acquiring COVID-19 by seeking health care services, which has adversely affected patients by worsening fixable situations. Another challenge is the decrease in diagnostic support for evaluating patients compared with a pre-COVID-19 world. Agencies providing at-home phlebotomy, portable radiology, and support services have had to limit their home visits due to an inability to access personal protective equipment. This loss of diagnostic and therapeutic support has had an emotional toll on patients and their caregivers. COVID-19 has had a tremendous impact on the health and finances of home health aides and their patients. Loss of long-term home health aides has adversely affected younger patients with ailments like Down syndrome as well as older patients with dementia. COVID-19 has also increased pressure on end-of-life decision making. Patients and their families are increasingly opting for palliative care and hospice programming to avoid separation. Families are being forced to consider advance directives under an increased emotional strain as patients become ""persons under investigation"" for COVID-19. Technology has allowed for the provision of services through telehealth, and changes to policy by CMS have aided widespread implementation of telemedicine. We anticipate continuing to be nimble in the face of challenge and to provide timely and meaningful care for those who depend on our efforts.","Seminara, Donna; Szerszen, Anita; Maese, John R; Shah, Zeel",Am J Manag Care,287,16

This study aims to investigate whether the COVID-19 pandemic is associated with increased referral of young people with OCD in one area of London and determine if COVID-19 has been associated with change in symptom severity and treatment offered in recent years.MethodA retrospective study was conducted using clinical service data investigating 58 young people (8–17 years) referred and assessed in CNWL NHS Foundation Trust CAMHS, before and during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 (months March–October 2018–2020). Changes in symptom severity were measured using the health of the nation outcome scale for children and adolescents (HoNOSCA). Total HoNOSCA and three HoNOSCA items were used;emotional symptoms, family relationships and school attendance. Patient clinical records were reviewed to assess if COVID-19 had exacerbated OCD symptoms. The type of treatment offered (cognitive behavioural therapy -CBT- only vs combined CBT and medication) was also compared. Analysis was carried out using Chi-square, Kruskal–Wallis and Mann–Whitney U tests.Result26 (5.62%) initial assessments to CAMHS were related to OCD in 2020, compared to 12 (1.30%) and 20 (2.27%) assessments pre-pandemic (2018 and 2019), showing a significant increase in the proportion of OCD cases (X2 (1, N = 58) = 20.3, p &lt; .001). There was no significant difference in total HoNOSCA, emotional, family relationships, or school attendance scores on initial assessment. However, 69.2% of clinical records in 2020 showed symptom worsening over the COVID-period, compared to 30.8% of cases assessed pre-pandemic.There was a significant difference between the type of treatment offered before and during COVID-19 (X2 (2, N = 58) = 12.7, p = .002), with a higher proportion of patients who were referred to CAMHS for OCD but discharged without treatment before the pandemic (37.5% vs 0%). While CBT only remains the most frequent treatment offered, combined treatment was more frequent during the pandemic, although this difference was not significant.ConclusionThe proportion of OCD-related initial assessments in CAMHS increased during the pandemic despite the overall number of referrals falling. Furthermore, fewer cases were discharged without treatment in CAMHS during this period. Given this, and that many were reported to have deteriorated during the pandemic, services will likely need to address the increased burden of more severe cases. Further research is warranted to assess the generalisability of our findings.","Henein, Anthony Pascual-Sanchez Ana Corciova Suzana Hodes Matthew",BJPsych Open,287,16

It is the most popular format of point-of-care test (POCT) and quickest and easiest way to detect a targeted molecule. In the combat against COVID-19 pandemic, hundreds of POCTs have been developed and are commercially available now. They are designed to detect either a SARS-CoV-2 viral antigen or IgG and IgM antibodies binding to it. Among the binding antibodies, a special type of functional antibodies that block the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 virus and its human receptor, neutralizing antibodies (NAbs), are of particular interest to public as well as in vaccination management. However as of today, POCTs for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 NAbs remain under late stage of development.Scope and method:In this review, we first summarize the importance of awareness and monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 NAbs in the combat against COVID-19 pandemic. Secondly, we compare the available methods for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 NAbs. Next, we describe challenges in the development of a rapid lateral flow test for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 NAbs. Finally, we outline its product formats and applications in research and in disease management. Conclusion:Vaccine effectiveness is unknown for an individual unless measured. NAb level is the most viable measurement for vaccine effectiveness or immunity.

Furthermore, criteria for the selection of patients that benefit most from this highly invasive and resource-demanding therapy are yet to be defined. In this study, we assess survival in an international multicenter cohort of COVID-19 patients treated with V-V ECMO and evaluate the performance of several clinical scores to predict 30-day survival. METHODS: This is an investigator-initiated retrospective non-interventional international multicenter registry study (NCT04405973, first registered 28 May 2020). In 127 patients treated with V-V ECMO at 15 centers in Germany, Switzerland, Italy, Belgium, and the United States, we calculated the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) Score, Simplified Acute Physiology Score II (SAPS II), Acute Physiology And Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) Score, Respiratory Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation Survival Prediction (RESP) Score, Predicting Death for Severe ARDS on V­V ECMO (PRESERVE) Score, and 30-day survival. RESULTS: In our study cohort which enrolled 127 patients, overall 30-day survival was 54%. Median SOFA, SAPS II, APACHE II, RESP, and PRESERVE were 9, 36, 17, 1, and 4, respectively. The prognostic accuracy for all these scores (area under the receiver operating characteristic-AUROC) ranged between 0.548 and 0.605. CONCLUSIONS: The use of scores for the prediction of mortality cannot be recommended for treatment decisions in severe COVID-19 ARDS undergoing V-V ECMO; nevertheless, scoring results below or above a specific cut-off value may be considered as an additional tool in the evaluation of prognosis. Survival rates in this cohort of COVID-19 patients treated with V­V ECMO were slightly lower than those reported in non-COVID-19 ARDS patients treated with V-V ECMO.","Supady, Alexander; DellaVolpe, Jeff; Taccone, Fabio Silvio; Scharpf, Dominik; Ulmer, Matthias; Lepper, Philipp M; Halbe, Maximilian; Ziegeler, Stephan; Vogt, Alexander; Ramanan, Raj; Boldt, David; Stecher, Stephanie-Susanne; Montisci, Andrea; Spangenberg, Tobias; Marggraf, Olivier; Kunavarapu, Chandra; Peluso, Lorenzo; Muenz, Sebastian; Buerle, Monica; Nagaraj, Naveen G; Nuding, Sebastian; Toma, Catalin; Gudzenko, Vadim; Stemmler, Hans Joachim; Pappalardo, Federico; Trummer, Georg; Benk, Christoph; Michels, Guido; Duerschmied, Daniel; von Zur Muehlen, Constantin; Bode, Christoph; Kaier, Klaus; Brodie, Daniel; Wengenmayer, Tobias; Staudacher, Dawid L",,287,21

RESULT: Among the 297 patients (median age of 48 years), 154 (51.9 %) were female, 245 (82.5 %) mild/moderate cases, and 52 (17.5 %) severe/critical cases. 270 patients were detected for SARS-CoV-2 RNA in anal swabs and/or blood samples, and the overall positive rate was 23.0 % (62/270), higher in severe/critical cases than in mild/moderate cases (52.0 % vs. 16.4 %, P < 0.001). The CD4/CD8 ratio on admission was significantly higher in severe/critical cases than in mild/moderate cases (1.84 vs. 1.50, P = 0.022). During a median follow-up period of 17 days, 36 (12.1 %) patients were admitted to intensive care unit (ICU), 16 (5.4 %) patients developed respiratory failure and underwent mechanical ventilation, four (1.3 %) patients needed extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), only one (0.34 %) patients died of multiple organ failure. Detectable SARS-CoV-2 RNA in anal swabs and/or blood samples, as well as higher CD4/CD8 ratio were independent risk factors of respiratory failure and ICU admission. CONCLUSIONS: Most of COVID-19 patients in Guangzhou are mild/moderate, and presence of extrapulmonary virus and higher CD4/CD8 ratio are associated with higher risk of worse outcomes.","Lei, Chunliang; Lin, Weiyin; Deng, Xilong; Hu, Fengyu; Chen, Fengjuan; Cai, Weiping; Li, Yueping; Wen, Chunyan; Guan, Yujuan; Wang, Jian; Chen, Xiaoting; Cao, Yi; Li, Feng; Tang, Xiaoping; Li, Linghua",J Clin Virol,287,24

This study constructs an integrated model to investigate the influencing mechanisms of internal locus of control (LOC) and objective peer effects. Methods: Residential college students (n = 494) were surveyed from a single department of a Chinese university. An item from the World Value Survey was employed to measure internal LOC, while objective peer effects were assessed via friends' mutual nominations. Finally, PIU was measured using Young's Internet Addiction Tests, while a social network analysis and logit regression were combined to estimate various factors' effects on PIU. Results: In our sample, the prevalence rate of PIU was 30.6%, and while internal LOC was a protective factor for PIU, its protective role was diluted when exposed to a peer environment with high PIU prevalence. Furthermore, indegree performed contrasting roles on PIU under various network conditions. It acted as a protective factor when exposed to a low prevalence of PIU in a peer environment; however, it became a risk factor when PIU peers were prevalent. Lastly, the protective efficacy of betweenness was activated when individuals had more than one PIU friend. Discussion and conclusions: Further intervention studies focusing on individuals with a weak internal LOC are recommended during the lockdown. Additionally, interventions that consider the network structures carefully, may enhance the prevention of PIU.","Xia, Yiwei; Fan, Yanying; Liu, Tzu-Hsuan; Ma, Zhihao",J. behav. addict. (Online),287,1

This descriptive, cross-sectional study was conducted with 162 patients with type 2 diabetes. Data were collected using the Information Form, Toronto Alexithymia Scale, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. For 83.3% of the participants, there was a decrease in sexual functioning after diabetes, 69.8% after the COVID-19 pandemic, and 67.2% due to both conditions. The majority of the patients stated the reasons for experiencing sexual problems related to not seeing sexuality as a priority (77.1%), and stress/anxiety experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic (67.9%). Moreover, patients' alexithymia, anxiety, and depression levels were found to be high during the pandemic, when the study was conducted. A positive correlation was identified between alexithymia and anxiety and depression. Further, multiple regression results indicated that about 50% of alexithymia levels could be explained by anxiety and depression levels. The anxiety, depression, and alexithymia scores of those who had decreased sexual functioning before and during the pandemic period were statistically significantly higher than those who did not have any change (p < 0.01). During the COVID-19 pandemic when the study was conducted, high levels of alexithymia, anxiety, and depression were observed in participants, and it was found that their sexual functioning was negatively affected.

Nevertheless, resolving the importance of indirect and environmental transmission in the ecology of epidemics remains a persistent challenge. It requires accurately measuring the free-living survival of pathogens across reservoirs of various kinds and quantifying the extent to which interaction between hosts and reservoirs generates new infections. These questions are especially salient for emerging pathogens, where sparse and noisy data can obfuscate the relative contribution of different infection routes. In this study, we develop a mechanistic, mathematical model that permits both direct (host-to-host) and indirect (environmental) transmission and then fit this model to empirical data from 17 countries affected by an emerging virus (SARS-CoV-2). From an ecological perspective, our model highlights the potential for environmental transmission to drive complex, nonlinear dynamics during infectious disease outbreaks. Summarizing, we propose that fitting alternative models with indirect transmission to real outbreak data from SARS-CoV-2 can be useful, as it highlights that indirect mechanisms may play an underappreciated role in the dynamics of infectious diseases, with implications for public health.","Ogbunugafor, C Brandon; Miller-Dickson, Miles D; Meszaros, Victor A; Gomez, Lourdes M; Murillo, Anarina L; Scarpino, Samuel V",Sci Rep,287,27

The pandemic is the result of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which has demonstrated high rates of infectivity leading to great morbidity and mortality in vulnerable populations. At present, scientists are exploring various approaches to curb this pandemic and alleviate its health consequences, while racing to develop a vaccine. A particularly insidious aspect of COVID-19 is the delayed overactivation of the body's immune system that is manifested as the cytokine storm. This unbridled production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines can directly or indirectly cause massive organ damage and failure. Systemic vascular endothelial inflammation and thrombocytopenia are potential consequences as well. In the case of COVID-19, the cytokine storm often fits the pattern of the macrophage activation syndrome with lymphocytopenia. The basis for the imbalance between the innate and adaptive immune systems is not clearly defined, but highlights the effect of SARS-CoV-2 on macrophages. Here we discuss the potential underlying basis for the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on macrophages, both direct and indirect, and potential therapeutic targets. These include granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), interleukin 6 (IL-6), interferons, and CXCL10 (IP-10). Various biopharmaceuticals are being repurposed to target the cytokine storm in COVID-19 patients. In addition, we discuss the rationale for activating the macrophage alpha 7 nicotinic receptors as a therapeutic target. A better understanding of the molecular consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection of macrophages could lead to novel and more effective treatments for COVID-19.","Booz, George W; Altara, Raffaele; Eid, Ali H; Wehbe, Zena; Fares, Souha; Zaraket, Hassan; Habeichi, Nada J; Zouein, Fouad A",Eur J Pharmacol,287,16

During a deep sunspot minimum (deepest in 100 years) such as we are now witnessing, two space related phenomena could have an effect on the disposition of viral disease and potential pandemics. With the weakening of the magnetic field in the Earth's vicinity, there would be a high flux of mutagenic cosmic rays. These processes would be likely to herald the onset of new pandemics. Neutron counts from Moscow Neutron Monitor show that the flux of cosmic rays reaching Earth in 2019 was indeed at a maximum over a timespan of half a century since 1962. It is of interest to note that immediately prior to the first recorded cases of the novel Corona virus in China a peak of cosmic rays was measured as is indicated by the Huon neutron monitor data. Recent research revealed that estimates of the timing of the most recent common ancestor of COVID-19 made with current sequence data point to emergence of the virus in late November 2019 to early December 2019, compatible with the earliest retrospectively confirmed cases and the cosmic ray spike in late November 2019.

METHOD: Participants were 316 spouse (and partner) caregivers of SMVs following a mild, moderate, severe, or penetrating TBI. Caregivers completed the Family Assessment Device General Functioning subscale, 24 HRQOL questionnaires, and the Mayo-Portland Adaptability Inventory (4th ed.; MPAI-4). The sample was divided into two family functioning groups: Healthy Family Functioning (HFF; n = 162) and Unhealthy Family Functioning (UFF; n = 154). Scores on HRQOL measures that generate T scores using normative data were classified as ""clinically elevated,"" using a cutoff of > 60T. RESULTS: Compared with the HFF group, caregivers in the UFF group reported worse scores on all HRQOL measures and worse SMV functional ability on the MPAI-4 Adjustment Index and Anxiety, Depression, and Irritability/Anger/Aggression items (all ps < .001, ds = .41-1.36). A significantly higher proportion of the UFF group had clinically elevated HRQOL scores compared with the HFF group on the majority of measures (Hs = .24-.75). When examining all HRQOL measures simultaneously, the UFF group consistently had a significantly higher cumulative percentage of clinically elevated scores compared with the HFF group (e.g., &#8805; 5 clinically elevated scores: UFF = 53.9% vs. HFF = 22.2%; H = .68). CONCLUSIONS: Caring for a SMV following TBI with comorbid mental health problems may have negative implications for their family functioning and the caregiver's HRQOL. Family-centered interventions could be beneficial for military families experiencing distress following SMV TBI and mental health comorbidity.

Health insurance mandates are effective mechanisms that many state policymakers use to increase the utilization of preventive health services, such as colorectal cancer (CRC) screening. The current study estimated the effects of health insurance mandate variations on CRC screening post Affordable Care Act (ACA) era. The study analyzed secondary data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) and the National Cancer Institute State Cancer Legislative Database (SCLD) from 1997-2014. BRFSS data were merged with SCLD data by state ID. The target population was U.S. adults, age 50 to 74, who lived in states where health insurance was mandated or non-mandated before and after the implementation of ACA. Using a difference-in-differences (DD) approach with a time-series analysis, we evaluated the effects of health insurance mandates on CRC screening status based on U.S. Preventive Services Task Force guidelines. The adjusted average marginal effects from the DD model indicate that health insurance mandates increased the probability of up-to-date screenings vs. non-compliance by 2.8% points, suggesting that an estimated 2.37 million additional age-eligible persons would receive a screening with such health insurance mandates. Compliant participants' mean age was 65 years and 57% were women (n=32,569). Our findings are robust for various model specifications. Health insurance mandates that lower out-of-pocket expenses constitute an effective approach to increase CRC screenings for the population, as a whole.","Preston, Michael A; Ross, Levi; Chukmaitov, Askar; Smith, Sharla A; Odlum, Michelle L; Dahman, Bassam; Sheppard, Vanessa B",Cancer prev. res.

As the COVID-19 outbreak has spread across the globe, it has brought significant changes to college campuses worldwide. College students have been heavily affected by the closure, as online learning has become increasingly common in higher education institutions. Using data collected from college students in South Korea and Taiwan in the spring of 2020, this study examines the effects of pandemic-related lifestyle changes on mental health conditions for college students in the two countries. The results were 3-fold. First, compared to college students in Taiwan, college students in South Korea reported greater decreases in time spent traveling, being with friends, eating at restaurants, and engaging in part-time employment, and greater increases in online shopping and ordering food for delivery. Second, college students in South Korea reported a higher level of worry, a greater possibility of contact with a person with COVID-19, and a lower level of happiness than did college students in Taiwan. Third, our findings indicate that social activities, including spending time with friends, were positively correlated with mental health conditions in South Korea and Taiwan. Comparing Korean and Taiwanese students' lifestyle changes and mental health conditions amid the pandemic, the study argues that the decrease in socialization and interaction under these new circumstances may be a significant factor that explains an increase in mental health issues in Korean college students compared to Taiwanese students, given the increase in confirmed COVID-19 cases in South Korea and the corresponding greater use of online teaching platforms there than in Taiwan.","Chen, Wei-Lin; Song, Sue-Yeon; Yap, Ko-Hua",Front Public Health,287,30

This paper reflects upon the proposition of public libraries as health literate multi-purpose workspaces for improving health literacy. We draw upon our combined experiences as evaluators of organizational health literacy initiatives, and library sector development, engagement and advocacy. Key ideas were presented as part of the 2020 State Library Victoria seminar series on 'Libraries: The Heart of a Healthy Community'. Key messages included: Public libraries are well positioned to contribute to the health literacy movement, as they provide the general public with: universal free access to information and services; extensive in-house and outreach educational collaborative learning opportunities; and health and wellbeing support by being welcoming, safe, and trusted community spaces. To date, limited discussion exists about conceptualizing public libraries as health literate multi-purpose workspaces for supporting and sustaining public library health literacy efforts. A health literate organizational framework is suggested to support libraries simply supporting health information literacy to being recognised as health literate organizations. Five workspace principles (empowerment, equitable, inclusive, collaborative and integrated) are suggested to provide directions for public libraries as health literate multi-purpose workspaces for improving the health literacy of individuals, communities, organizations and indeed systems. To inform the design, implementation and evaluation of public libraries as workspaces for improving health literacy, key principles-focused evaluation questions are suggested for consideration.

In this study, we assessed the understanding of osteoporosis treatment and its risk in dental professionals pre and post an education lecture. Method: Dental professionals were invited to an educational lecture on osteoporosis treatment and benefits. 2 lectures were conducted over the course of a year, with the 2nd lecture conducted virtually due to physical meeting restrictions in place for the COVID 19 pandemic. Attendees were invited to submit responses to a pre- and post- lecture survey assessing their knowledge of the current osteoporosis treatments and MRONJ. Results: There were 126 responses to the survey conducted. Majority (87%) of responders were dentists in private, including group dental practices, with 74% having more than 11 years of working experience. Most (81 %) have not had any encounters with patients with MRONJ. The pre-lecture survey showed that 60% of responders expressed slight or no confidence at all in treating patients who are on osteoporosis treatment. Only 19% of all responders were able to correctly identify the risk of MRONJ in patients on osteoporosis treatment. Majority of responders tended to inflate MRONJ risk by as much as 100 times the quoted baseline risk in the literature. One third of dentists would not perform any invasive treatments on patients on osteoporosis treatment. Post-lecture, the percentage of responders with slight and no confidence at all in treating patients who are on osteoporosis treatment decreased to 18%. 65% of responders were able to correctly identify the risk of MRONJ in patients on osteoporosis treatment as quoted in the literature. Only 3% of dentists would not perform any invasive treatments on patients on osteoporosis treatment. 95% of responders correctly stated that maintenance of good oral hygiene is the most important measure to prevent MRONJ. Attendees suggested the creation of a joint guidance from local osteoporosis and dental societies may better improve knowledge and instill confidence in treating osteoporosis patients. Conclusion: There is a significant knowledge gap within the dental practitioners in Singapore on the risk of MRONJ associated with osteoporosis treatments. This may result in dentists discouraging patients from starting osteoporosis medications and dentists not performing necessary dental treatments on patients on osteoporosis treatment. Both physical and virtual dental education lectures are effective in increasing the level of confidence and in correcting misconceptions on MRONJ risk. Continued engagement of the dental community would be important in reducing fear of MRONJ and facilitate treatment of osteoporosis in the population.","Gani, Linsey Chionh Siok Bee",Journal of the Endocrine Society,287,24

Being younger (p<0.0001) and most at risk of COVID-19 (p<0.05) were associated with greater depression, anxiety and stress. Greater positive mood, lower loneliness and greater exercise were protective factors for all outcomes (p<0.0001). Smoking (p=0.037) and alcohol consumption (p<0.05) were associated with increased anxiety. Pet ownership was associated with lower depression (p=0.006) and anxiety (p=0.008). When adjusting for age and gender differences, anxiety (p=0.002) and stress (p=0.007) were significantly lower in NZ than in the UK. The NZ sample reported lower perceived risk (p<0.0001) and worry about COVID-19 (p<0.0001) than the UK sample. CONCLUSIONS: The NZ population had higher depression and anxiety compared with population norms. Younger people and those most at risk of COVID-19 reported poorer mental health. Interventions should promote frequent exercise, and reduce loneliness and unhealthy behaviours.","Gasteiger, Norina; Vedhara, Kavita; Massey, Adam; Jia, Ru; Ayling, Kieran; Chalder, Trudie; Coupland, Carol; Broadbent, Elizabeth",BMJ Open,287,16

In fact, as the prevalence of COVID-19 decreases, this RT-PCR testing remains as the main preventive measure to avoid rebound. However, inconsistent results can lead to misdiagnoses in the clinic. These inconsistencies are due to the variability in (1) the collection times of biological samples post infection, and (2) sampling procedures. METHODS: We applied the Kaplan-Meier method and multivariate logistic regression on RT-PCR results from 258 confirmed patients with COVID-19 to evaluate the factors associated with negative conversion. We also estimated the proportion (%) of negative conversion among patients who had tested twice or more, and compared the proportions arising from oropharyngeal swabs, sputum, and combined double testing, respectively. MAIN RESULTS: The proportion of negative conversion was 6.7% on day 4, 16.4% on day 7, 41.0% at 2 weeks, and 61.0% at 3 weeks post-admission. We also found that 34.1% and 60.3% of subjects had at least one negative RT-PCR result on days 7 and 14 after the onset of symptoms, respectively. The proportion of negative conversions following sputum testing was higher than that from oropharyngeal swabs in the early stages but this declined after the onset of symptoms. CONCLUSION: In the absence of effective treatments or vaccines, efficient testing strategies are critical if we are to control the COVID-19 epidemic. According to this study, early, consecutive and combined double testing, will be the key to identify infected patients, particularly for asymptomatic and mild symptomatic cases. These strategies will minimize misdiagnosis and the ineffective isolation of infected patients.","Song, Yangzi; Chen, Chen; Wang, Yu; Zhang, Ju; Chen, Meiling; Gao, Guiju; Wang, Sa; Yang, Di; Song, Rui; Wang, Linghang; Xie, Wen; Yu, Fengting; Yan, Liting; Wang, Yajie; Zeng, Hui; Zhang, Fujie",Int J Infect Dis,287,24

The FCA is the primary mechanism for government enforcement against health care entities engaged in wrongdoing, and it is expected to be DOJ's key tool for addressing fraud arising out of government programs in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. DOJ has pointed to three key goals of its enforcement efforts (deterrence, incentivizing cooperation, and building a culture of compliance in the health care industry). However, careful examination of the settlements touted in those DOJ press releases calls into question whether DOJ's settlement practices are conveying the message DOJ seeks to impart or having the impact it hopes to achieve. Virtually all FCA cases resolve without requiring the defendant to admit wrongdoing, and many defendants issue explicit public denials of wrongdoing when the resolution is announced. The absence of any need to admit wrongdoing has fueled a cost-of-doing-business narrative in which health care entities are required periodically to pay inconsequential settlements to the government regardless of their conduct. DOJ thereby risks both diminishing the general deterrence value of resolutions and lending credence to the vocal skepticism among industry and the defense bar that DOJ could, in fact, prevail at trial. DOJ's willingness to allow settlements in health care fraud cases without admissions is diametrically contrary to DOJ's policy in criminal cases, which is against permitting resolutions without defendants' clear and unequivocal acceptance of responsibility for violating the law. Permitting no-responsibility settlements in the civil FCA context suggests both that DOJ pursues, illegitimately, weak cases it cannot prove at trial, and potentially weakens the general deterrence value of civil FCA claims in general. New defendants may be left with cover that they are not wrongdoers but are merely ensnared in an illegitimate money grab. Even defendants who frankly recognize that they are in violation of the statute may be comforted that they likely face paying little more than restitution, and no significant penalties or social opprobrium. These practices suggest that DOJ rewards willingness to settle, and the monetary recovery it brings, above all other factors. DOJ's focus on settling and monetary recoveries in turn lends credence to the widespread belief that civil health care fraud settlements simply do not signal wrongdoing. There is no law, policy, or practice that prevents DOJ from requiring admissions in FCA settlements. Yet an in-depth review of nearly 200 FCA resolutions involving health care entities over the past two years reveals that approximately 92% did not include defendants' clear acceptance of responsibility, and approximately 37% involved defendants actively denying responsibility. The absence of any DOJ policy favoring admissions has important negative consequences, undermining DOJ's goals of deterrence, incentivizing cooperation, and building a culture of compliance. First, when corporate actors believe DOJ will pursue claims regardless of wrongdoing and the consequences of even a settlement will be relatively painless from a financial and reputational perspective, those actors have reduced incentive to put in place compliance structures dedicated to preventing wrongdoing. Second, and perhaps more importantly, when corporate actors diminish the force of settlements with DOJ by denying responsibility, they undermine the system's legitimacy vital for DOJ to encourage cooperation and for the government and well-meaning corporate actors to cultivate an industry-wide culture of compliance. This Article examines DOJ policy both from an economic incentive perspective and in light of research surrounding the psychology of legal authority, concluding that under both lenses DOJ und rcuts its own goals. With DOJ actively reforming FCA policy and the FCA poised to take center stage in the government's fight against COVID-19 program abuse, it is beyond time to address this gap in DOJ's enforcement policy.

OBJECTIVE: We set-up a multicenter Italian collaboration to investigate the relationship between HCQ therapy and COVID-19 in-hospital mortality. METHODS: In a retrospective observational study, 3,451 unselected patients hospitalized in 33 clinical centers in Italy, from February 19, 2020 to May 23, 2020, with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, were analyzed. The primary end-point in a time-to event analysis was in-hospital death, comparing patients who received HCQ with patients who did not. We used multivariable Cox proportional-hazards regression models with inverse probability for treatment weighting by propensity scores, with the addition of subgroup analyses. RESULTS: Out of 3,451 COVID-19 patients, 76.3% received HCQ. Death rates (per 1,000 person-days) for patients receiving or not HCQ were 8.9 and 15.7, respectively. After adjustment for propensity scores, we found 30% lower risk of death in patients receiving HCQ (HR=0.70; 95%CI: 0.59 to 0.84; E-value=1.67). Secondary analyses yielded similar results. The inverse association of HCQ with inpatient mortality was particularly evident in patients having elevated C-reactive protein at entry. CONCLUSIONS: HCQ use was associated with a 30% lower risk of death in COVID-19 hospitalized patients. Within the limits of an observational study and awaiting results from randomized controlled trials, these data do not discourage the use of HCQ in inpatients with COVID-19.",,Eur. j. intern. med,287,16

By the mid-1960s, they presided over the three independent anaesthetic departments at Johannesburg's three main teaching hospitals, teaching generations of junior doctors. The first woman to register as a specialist anaesthetist in SA, Miriam (Mollie) Barlow, broke the glass ceiling in her own career by lobbying for the professional rights of medical women, although working within the constraints of the medical and political establishment. She also contributed to important SA research on malignant hyperthermia.

We hypothesize that changes in habits and medical care during coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) lockdown might have worsened the clinical course of migraine. DESIGN: Retrospective survey study collecting online responses from migraine patients followed-up by neurologists at three tertiary hospitals between June and July 2020. METHODS: We used a web-based survey that included demographic data, clinical variables related with any headache (frequency) and migraine (subjective worsening, frequency, and intensity), lockdown, and symptoms of post-traumatic stress. RESULTS: The response rate of the survey was 239/324 (73.8%). The final analysis included 222 subjects. Among them, 201/222 (90.5%) were women, aged 42.5 ± 12.0 (mean±SD). Subjective improvement of migraine during lockdown was reported in 31/222 participants (14.0%), while worsening in 105/222 (47.3%) and was associated with changes in migraine triggers such as stress related to going outdoors and intake of specific foods or drinks. Intensity of attacks increased in 67/222 patients (30.2%), and it was associated with the subjective worsening, female sex, recent insomnia, and use of acute medication during a headache. An increase in monthly days with any headache was observed in 105/222 patients (47.3%) and was related to symptoms of post-traumatic stress, older age and living with five or more people.

Critical factors affecting the virus detectability and the estimation of infection ratio include virus concentration methods, lag-period, per capita virus shedding amount, sewage generation rate, temperature-related decay kinetics of virus/biomarker in wastewater, and hydraulic retention time (HRT), etc. Theoretical simulation shows that the main factors affecting the detectability of virus in sewage are per capita virus shedding amount and sewage generation rate. While the decay of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in sewage is a relatively slow process, which may have limited impact on its detection. Under the ideal condition of high per capita virus shedding amount and low sewage generation rate, it is expected to detect a single infected person within 400,000 people.","Wu, Jinyong; Wang, Zizheng; Lin, Yufei; Zhang, Lihua; Chen, Jing; Li, Panyu; Liu, Wenbin; Wang, Yabo; Yao, Changhong; Yang, Kun",Sci Total Environ,287,27

METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted in April 2020. Participants of Chinese nationality aged â©¾ 18 years were asked to complete a modified validated Chinese version of a questionnaire regarding the impact of event scale (IES), family and social support, mental health-related lifestyle changes, and indicators of negative mental health impacts. RESULTS: A total of 728 participants (i.e., 217 males and 511 females) completed the questionnaire. The mean age of the participants was 32.9 ± 10.4 years, with a majority of them (92.2%) having a higher educational qualification level. The overall mean IES in participants was 21.5 ± 7.0, reflecting mild stressful impact (i.e., following the re-opening of the Wuhan city); 25.5% of the participants had an IES score â©¾ 26. Being females and married were significantly associated with a higher mean IES score. The overall mean scores for intrusion and avoidance score scales in participants were 9.4 ± 3.7 and 12.1 ± 4.2, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic was associated with increased stressful impact in our participants following the re-opening of the Wuhan city when compared with our previous study, which should not be taken lightly.","Ma, Zheng Feei; Zhang, Yutong; Luo, Xiaoqin; Li, Xinli; Li, Yeshan; Liu, Shuchang; Zhang, Yingfei",Int J Soc Psychiatry,287,22

There is growing optimism that social distancing restrictions and face mask requirements could be eased with widespread vaccine adoption soon. METHODS: We developed a dynamic compartmental model of COVID-19 transmission for the four most severely affected states (New York, Texas, Florida, and California). We evaluated the vaccine effectiveness and coverage required to suppress the COVID-19 epidemic in scenarios when social contact was to return to pre-pandemic levels and face mask use was reduced. Daily and cumulative COVID-19 infection and death cases from 26th January to 15th September 2020 were obtained from the Johns Hopkins University Coronavirus resource center and used for model calibration. RESULTS: Without a vaccine (scenario 1), the spread of COVID-19 could be suppressed in these states by maintaining strict social distancing measures and face mask use levels. But relaxing social distancing restrictions to the pre-pandemic level without changing the current face mask use would lead to a new COVID-19 outbreak, resulting in 0.8-4 million infections and 15,000-240,000 deaths across these four states over the next 12 months. Under this circumstance, introducing a vaccine (scenario 2) would partially offset this negative impact even if the vaccine effectiveness and coverage are relatively low. However, if face mask use is reduced by 50% (scenario 3), a vaccine that is only 50% effective (weak vaccine) would require coverage of 55-94% to suppress the epidemic in these states. A vaccine that is 80% effective (moderate vaccine) would only require 32-57% coverage to suppress the epidemic. In contrast, if face mask usage stops completely (scenario 4), a weak vaccine would not suppress the epidemic, and further major outbreaks would occur. A moderate vaccine with coverage of 48-78% or a strong vaccine (100% effective) with coverage of 33-58% would be required to suppress the epidemic. Delaying vaccination rollout for 1-2 months would not substantially alter the epidemic trend if the current non-pharmaceutical interventions are maintained. CONCLUSIONS: The degree to which the US population can relax social distancing restrictions and face mask use will depend greatly on the effectiveness and coverage of a potential COVID-19 vaccine if future epidemics are to be prevented. Only a highly effective vaccine will enable the US population to return to life as it was before the pandemic.","Shen, Mingwang; Zu, Jian; Fairley, Christopher K; Pagán, José A; An, Li; Du, Zhanwei; Guo, Yuming; Rong, Libin; Xiao, Yanni; Zhuang, Guihua; Li, Yan; Zhang, Lei",Vaccine,287,23

Heart transplantation and ventricular assist device (VAD) support represent the only available lifelines for end stage disease. In the context of donor organ shortage, the future role of VAD as destination therapy is emerging. Yet, major drawbacks are connected to the long-term implantation of current devices. Poor VAD hemocompatibility exposes the patient to life-threatening events, including haemorrhagic syndromes and thrombosis. Here, we introduce a new concept of artificial support, the Hybrid Membrane VAD, as a first-of-its-kind pump prototype enabling physiological blood propulsion through the cyclic actuation of a hyperelastic membrane, enabling the protection from the thrombogenic interaction between blood and the implant materials. The centre of the luminal membrane surface displays a rationally-developed surface topography interfering with flow to support a living endothelium. The precast cell layer survives to a range of dynamically changing pump actuating conditions i.e., actuation frequency from 1 to 4 Hz, stroke volume from 12 to 30 mL, and support duration up to 313 min, which are tested both in vitro and in vivo, ensuring the full retention of tissue integrity and connectivity under challenging conditions. In summary, the presented results constitute a proof of principle for the Hybrid Membrane VAD concept and represent the basis for its future development towards clinical validation.","Ferrari, Aldo; Giampietro, Costanza; Bachmann, Björn; Bernardi, Laura; Bezuidenhhout, Deon; Ermanni, Paolo; Hopf, Raoul; Kitz, Sarah; Kress, Gerald; Loosli, Christian; Marina, Vita; Meboldt, Mirko; Pellegrini, Giovanni; Poulikakos, Dimos; Rebholz, Mathias; Schmid Daners, Marianne; Schmidt, Tanja; Starck, Christoph; Stefopoulos, Georgios; Sündermann, Simon; Thamsen, Bente; Zilla, Peter; Potapov, Evgenij; Falk, Volkmar; Mazza, Edoardo",Ann. biomed. eng,287,26

The unintended consequences (positive and negative) indicate that social distancing has impacted church gatherings in some positive ways such as reducing the spread of COVID-19 among congregants, and enabling technological innovations for virtual Church services and programs. Conversely, social distancing has negatively impacted the social cohesion and overall social capital value of churches, and imprinted a long lasting disruptions to age-long ecclesiological identities, denominational practices, and liturgies of contemporary churches. We utilized Game Theory as the theoretical scaffold of our propositions. In addition we delineated the implications of social distancing on Christian religious gathering during pandemics such as COVID-19 and lessons from a socio-behavioral perspective for religious institutions.","Adegboyega, Adebola; Boddie, Stephanie; Dorvie, Hope; Bolaji, Bolanle; Adedoyin, Christson; Moore, Sharon E.",J.

The present study focuses on the demographic, clinical and laboratory profile of such patients from a tertiary level non-COVID respiratory care hospital. This is a retrospective observational study. Seventy-seven sick patients fulfilling COVID suspect criteria were admitted to the isolation area. Their RT-PCR test was done from the designated laboratory and 35 of them were confirmed to be COVID-19 patients. The detailed demographic, clinical and laboratory profile of these COVID-19 patients was studied. The mean age was 46±17 years with male predominance (57%). Majority of the cases (83%) were symptomatic. The most common symptom was cough (66%) followed by breathlessness and fever. Nineteen (54.3%) patients had one or the other co-morbidity and 16 (45.7%) had chronic lung diseases as one of the comorbidities. Nearly half of the patients (51%) required supplementary oxygen on presentation. Two patients were put on invasive mechanical ventilation while 4 patients required non-invasive ventilation before being shifted to the COVID hospital. Hence, it can be concluded that COVID-19 in patients of chronic respiratory diseases manifests with higher prevalence of symptoms and also higher severity of disease. Further, the symptomatology of COVID-19 closely mimics the acute exacerbation of chronic lung diseases, so cautious screening and testing should be done, especially at the pulmonary department.","Goel, Nitin; Spalgais, Sonam; Mrigpuri, Parul; Khanna, Madhu; Menon, Balakrishnan; Kumar, Raj",Monaldi arch. chest dis,287,6

However, unscented transforms developed using either the Gaussian assumption or a minimum set of sigma points typically fall short when the random variable is not Gaussian distributed and the nonlinearities are substantial. In this paper, we develop the generalized unscented transform (GenUT), which uses adaptable sigma points that can be positively constrained, and accurately approximates the mean, covariance, and skewness of an independent random vector of most probability distributions, while being able to partially approximate the kurtosis. For correlated random vectors, the GenUT can accurately approximate the mean and covariance. In addition to its superior accuracy in propagating means and covariances, the GenUT uses the same order of calculations as most unscented transforms that guarantee third-order accuracy, which makes it applicable to a wide variety of applications, including the assimilation of observations in the modeling of the coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) causing COVID-19.","Ebeigbe, D.; Berry, T.; Norton, M.

Thousands of pigs had to be destroyed on the farm due to reduced slaughter capacity caused by ill workers. In the future, both short-term and long-term remedies will be needed. In the short-term, a portable electrocution unit that uses scientifically validated electrical parameters for inducing instantaneous unconsciousness, would be preferable to some of the poor killing methods. A second alternative would be converting the slaughter houses to carcass production. This would require fewer people to process the same number of pigs. The pandemic revealed the fragility of large centralized supply chains. A more distributed supply chain with smaller abattoirs would be more robust and less prone to disruption, but the cost of pork would be greater. Small abattoirs can coexist with large slaughter facilities if they process pigs for specialized premium markets such as high welfare pork. The pandemic also had a detrimental effect on animal welfare inspection and third party auditing programs run by large meat buyers. Most in-person audits in the slaughter plants were cancelled and audits were done by video. Video audits should never completely replace in-person audits.","Grandin, Temple",,287,1

One way to decarbonize the energy industry is by converting electrical energy into chemical energy via water electrolysis to produce hydrogen. Hydrogen can then be stored, used in a fuel cell to generate electricity, or burnt cleanly with air to generate heat, steam, producing only water as a by-product. However, hydrogen has an extremely low density, even when compressed, which means that its energy density on a volumetric basis remains distinctly substandard to most liquid fuels, hydrogen also has a much wider range of concentrations over which it remains potentially explosive. Ammonia alternatively is ~ 18% hydrogen by weight, which means that in terms of hydrogen density, it is ~ 50% higher than compressed or liquefied hydrogen. One major advantage is that there is an existing infrastructure for the production, transport and distribution of ammonia worldwide. Although ammonia in theory can be combusted to produce only nitrogen and water as emissions, in practice, several challenges arise, nitrous oxides (NOx) are often generated, especially if the combustion happens at higher temperatures and/or under pressure, in vehicle engines, gas turbines and as rocket fuel. To overcome such challenges, further research into ammonia combustion phenomena is required. This review sheds light on recent technological advancements with ammonia from the production point to the utilization end point.

In a previous study, we investigated the presence of coronaviruses in faecal samples from bats at different locations in Denmark, and made phylogenies based on short, partial ORF1b sequences. In this study, selected samples containing bat coronaviruses from three different bat species were analysed, using a non-targeted approach of next-generation sequencing. From the resulting metagenomics data, we assembled full-genome sequences of seven distinct alphacoronaviruses, three astroviruses, and a polyomavirus, as well as partial genome sequences of rotavirus H and caliciviruses, from the different bat species. Comparisons to published sequences indicate that the bat alphacoronaviruses belong to three different subgenera-i.e., Pedacovirus, Nyctacovirus, and Myotacovirus-that the astroviruses may be new species in the genus Mamastrovirus, and that the polyomavirus could also be a new species, but unassigned to a genus. Furthermore, several viruses of invertebrates-including two Rhopalosiphum padi (aphid) viruses and a Kadipiro virus-present in the faecal material were assembled. Interestingly, this is the first detection in Europe of a Kadipiro virus.","Lazov, Christina M; Belsham, Graham J; Bøtner, Anette; Rasmussen, Thomas Bruun",Viruses,287,24

Similar to other medications, allergic reactions can occur during vaccination. While most reactions are neither frequent nor serious, anaphylactic reactions are potentially life-threatening allergic reactions that are encountered rarely, but can cause serious complications. The allergic responses caused by vaccines can stem from activation of mast cells via FcÎµ receptor-1 type I reaction, mediated by the interaction between immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies against a particular vaccine, and occur within minutes or up to four hours. The type IV allergic reactions initiate 48 h after vaccination and demonstrate their peak between 72 and 96 h. Non-IgE-mediated mast cell degranulation via activation of the complement system and via activation of the Mas-related G protein-coupled receptor X2 can also induce allergic reactions. Reactions are more often caused by inert substances, called excipients, which are added to vaccines to improve stability and absorption, increase solubility, influence palatability, or create a distinctive appearance, and not by the active vaccine itself. Polyethylene glycol, also known as macrogol, in the currently available Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna COVID-19 mRNA vaccines, and polysorbate 80, also known as Tween 80, in AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccines, are excipients mostly incriminated for allergic reactions. This review will summarize the current state of knowledge of immediate and delayed allergic reactions in the currently available vaccines against COVID-19, together with the general and specific therapeutic considerations. These considerations include: The incidence of allergic reactions and deaths under investigation with the available vaccines, application of vaccination in patients with mast cell disease, patients who developed an allergy during the first dose, vasovagal symptoms masquerading as allergic reactions, the COVID-19 vaccination in pregnancy, deaths associated with COVID-19 vaccination, and questions arising in managing of this current ordeal. Careful vaccine-safety surveillance over time, in conjunction with the elucidation of mechanisms of adverse events across different COVID-19 vaccine platforms, will contribute to the development of a safe vaccine strategy. Allergists' expertise in proper diagnosis and treatment of allergic reactions is vital for the screening of high-risk individuals.","Kounis, Nicholas G; Koniari, Ioanna; de Gregorio, Cesare; Velissaris, Dimitris; Petalas, Konstantinos; Brinia, Aikaterini; Assimakopoulos, Stelios F; Gogos, Christos; Kouni, Sophia N; Kounis, George N; Calogiuri, GianFranco; Hung, Ming-Yow",,287,24

Methods: A total of 52 patients with COVID-19 who were admitted to three hospitals in China from January 23, 2020 to February 1, 2020 were retrospectively analyzed using QCT. The accuracy of QCT segmentation was assessed. The relationship between the time from symptom onset to initial CT and QCT parameters acquired on the initial CT were explored. Results: First, the ability of QCT to detect and segment lesions was investigated and it was unveiled that results of segmentation of the majority of cases (42/52) were satisfactory and for 8 out of 52 patients, the images depicted lesions with miss-segmentation; besides, 2 out of 52 cases had negative finding on chest CT achieved by both radiologists and QCT. QCT-related parameters showed to have a relationship with the time from symptom onset to initial CT. In the early-stage (0-3 days), the percentage of lung involvement was 4%, with a mean density of - 462 ± 99 HU. The peak density of lesions appeared at the range of - 500 to - 700 HU on density histogram. In the intermediate-stage (4-6 days), the mean percentage of lung involvement noticeably increased compared with that in early stage (7%, p < 0.05). In late stage (7-14 days), the percentage of lung involvement decreased to 5%. The mean density of lesions was the highest (- 430 ± 80), and heterogeneity density distribution showed a dual-peak on density histogram. Conclusion: COVID-19 can be promptly detected by QCT.

The purpose of this article is to provide a translational and pragmatic approach to understanding mindfulness in the context of SY and psychological wellbeing through a rapid review of the literature. The background of mindfulness and SY practice are discussed and the emotional, neuroendocrine, and neurobiological responses are examined. Next, a rapid review of the literature examined six studies, published between 2010 and 2020 to determine what is known regarding the relationship between SY, mindfulness, and psychological wellbeing. The studies included 21-360 participants with a mean age of 20-55 years. The results demonstrated a significant positive correlation between nature, mindfulness, and measures of psychological wellbeing. During uncertain events, including COVID-19, weaving mindfulness with SY may be specifically important to at-risk groups, those experiencing depression, loneliness, and social isolation, and at-risk populations such as college students, veterans, and professionals with high levels of stress.

In this work, we study a social distancing game among the agents of a population, who determine their social interactions during the spread of an epidemic. The interconnections between the agents are modeled by a network and local interactions are considered. The payoffs of the agents depend on their benefits from their social interactions, as well as on the costs to their health due to their possible contamination. The information available to the agents during the decision making plays a crucial role in our model. We examine two extreme cases. In the first case, the agents know exactly the health states of their neighbors and in the second they have statistical information for the global prevalence of the epidemic. The Nash equilibria of the games are studied and, interestingly, in the second case the equilibrium strategies for an agent are either full isolation or no social distancing at all. Experimental studies are presented through simulations, where we observe that in the first case of perfect local information the agents can affect significantly the prevalence of the epidemic with low cost for their sociability, while in the second case they have to pay the burden of not being well informed. Moreover, the effects of the information quality (fake news), the health care system capacity and the network structure are discussed and relevant simulations are provided, which indicate that these parameters affect the size, the peak and the start of the outbreak, as well as the possibility of a second outbreak.","Lagos, A.-R.; Kordonis, I.; Papavassilopoulos, G.

However, this year, people on Earth have had to face a most obvious risk. The effects of Covid-19 have reached such proportions that the human world probably will never be the same again. However, the extent of jeopardies is not similar for all world inhabitants, neither are the tools to handle the risks. To face the threat and learn from it, humans need to change manners on many levels and in many social and physical areas.

This prospective cross-sectional study explored the inflammatory profiles and clinical recovery of COVID-19 patients at 3 months post-discharge. METHODS: COVID-19 patients discharged from four hospitals in Wuhan, recovered asymptomatic patients (APs) from an isolation hotel, and uninfected healthy controls (HCs) were recruited. Viral nucleic acid and antibody detection, laboratory examination, computed tomography, pulmonary function assessment, multiplex cytokine assay, and flow cytometry were performed. RESULTS: The 72 age-, sex- and body mass index-matched participants included 19 severe/critical patients (SPs), 20 mild/moderate patients (MPs), 16 APs, and 17 HCs. At 3 months after discharge, levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and factors related to vascular injury/repair in recovered COVID-19 patients had not returned to those of the HCs, especially among recovered SPs compared to recovered MPs and APs. These cytokines were significantly correlated with impaired pulmonary function and chest CT abnormalities. However, levels of immune cells had returned to nearly normal levels and were not significantly correlated with abnormal clinical features. CONCLUSION: Vascular injury, inflammation, and chemotaxis persisted in COVID-19 patients and were correlated with abnormal clinical features 3 months after discharge, especially in recovered SPs.","Zhou, Mei; Yin, Zhengrong; Xu, Juanjuan; Wang, Sufei; Liao, Tingting; Wang, Kai; Li, Yumei; Yang, Fan; Wang, Zhen; Yang, Guanghai; Zhang, Jianchu; Yang, Jin",J. infect. dis,287,16

CD73 is present on subsets of human B and T cells where it plays a role in lymphocyte activation and migration. CD73 also functions as an ectoenzyme that converts AMP into immunosuppressive adenosine. We have developed a humanized anti-CD73 antibody, mupadolimab (CPI-006), that blocks CD73 enzymatic activity and activates CD73POS B cells, thereby inducing differentiation into plasmablasts, immunoglobulin class switching, and antibody secretion independent of the adenosine modulatory activity. These effects suggest mupadolimab may enhance the magnitude, diversity, and duration of anti-viral responses in patients with COVID-19. This hypothesis was tested in a dose escalation phase 1 trial in 29 hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Single doses of 0.3 mg/kg - 5 mg/kg mupadolimab were well tolerated with no drug related adverse events. Doses greater than 0.3 mg/kg resulted in rapid generation of IgG and IgM to SARS-CoV-2 significantly above titers measured in convalescent controls, with elevated IgG titers sustained for more than 6 months beyond presentation of symptoms. Based on these findings, a randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study in hospitalized patients was initiated. The primary endpoint was proportion of patients alive and free from respiratory failure within 28 days. This trial was discontinued early during the period of waning COVID-19 incidence after enrolling 40 patients. Although underpowered, results from this trial suggest improvement in the primary and key secondary endpoints in patients treated with single doses of 2 mg/kg and 1 mg/kg compared to placebo.

Moreover, the lockdown measures decreed in Spain prohibit the holding of wakes to avoid contagion, and limit funerals to three people plus the officiant. Thus, coronavirus is robbing people of the opportunity of a final farewell, stripping the dead of their dignity and worsening the grief of the living. This article investigates the situation and the social and cultural impact it has provoked. The method used takes the line of critical dialogue analysis (CDA) applied to information contained in the mass media, employing qualitative material from a related small-scale study. The results show that in countries like Spain where there is a strong Roman Catholic tradition the importance of these rituals is unquestionable. Although the country has become laicized over recent years, many traditions around death are still maintained. Hence, the impossibility of holding funerals is triggering a large number of social and personal conflicts. Furthermore, they indicate that lockdown, and the lack of rituals and of accompaniment constitute some of the most crucial stressors in the epidemic. Grief in solitude has become widespread and all the more fundamental in a society that values social support from close friends and family members. The conclusions show that the social distancing imposed by the epidemic is especially hard to bear when relatives are passing into death.","Fernández, Óscar; González-González, Miguel",,287,16

Patients are often asymptomatic and have normal examinations at the time of evaluation. Thus, diagnosis depends heavily on eliciting key features from the history. Overreliance on symptom quality descriptions commonly leads to misdiagnosis. The goal of this article is to provide the reader with a straightforward approach to the diagnosis and management of conditions that cause episodic spontaneous dizziness. RECENT FINDINGS: Consensus diagnostic criteria have been established for vestibular migraine, Ménière disease, vestibular paroxysmia, and hemodynamic orthostatic dizziness/vertigo. Vertigo has been recognized as a common symptom in vertebrobasilar ischemia, cardiogenic dizziness, and orthostatic hypotension. Treatment recommendations for vestibular migraine still lack high-quality evidence, but controlled trials are occurring. SUMMARY: The evaluation should start with a detailed description of the episodes from the patient and any observers. Rather than focusing first on whether the symptom quality is most consistent with vertigo, dizziness, lightheadedness, or unsteadiness, the clinician should clarify the timing (episode frequency and duration), possible triggers or circumstances (eg, position changes, upright posture), and accompanying symptoms. History should identify any auditory symptoms, migraine features, posterior circulation ischemic symptoms, vascular risk factors, clues for anxiety, and potentially relevant medications. Carefully selected testing can help secure the diagnosis, but excessive and indiscriminate testing can lead to more confusion. Treatments for these conditions are vastly different, so an accurate diagnosis is critical.","Eggers, Scott D Z",Continuum (Minneap Minn),287,1

Has an increased risk of a severe form been identified in the adolescent AN patients? Method: We have recalled the French recommendations on the subject Then we carried out a review of the international literature via Medline, Google Scholar as well as data from the American organization Center for Disease Control and Prevention Results: The evolution of knowledge about the pandemic has clearly established a lower risk of infection in adolescents than in adults It seems that the virus spares this population, most of them remaining asymptomatic or paucisymptomatic Reassuringly, AN or low body weight has not been shown to pose a risk for the severe form of COVID-19 Conversely, the literature reports that lockdown worsens the symptoms of AN (food restriction, hyperactivity) in at least a third of these patients Most of the patients expressed a high level of anxiety during the first lockdown It may even have been difficult for these patients to continue to access care when they were confined Conclusion: In the end, it seems wise not to reproduce the strategy of early return home in adolescents with AN Current data support the need for continuity of care, as well as the continuation of hospital care when necessary, while a too rapid discharge runs the risk of destabilizing the patient in an already long and difficult course of care in the usual time © 2021","Verley, J.

Protecting those at high risk of infection/transmission, whilst addressing the multiple health and social needs of this group, is of utmost importance. This study aimed to document the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on individuals who were experiencing homelessness in one city centre in Scotland, and how services adapted in response. METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with individuals with lived/living experience of homelessness (n = 10), staff within onethird sector service (n = 5), and external professionals (n = 5), during April-August 2020, using a rapid case study design. These were audio-recorded, fully transcribed, and analysed using Framework. Analysis was informed by inclusion health and equity-orientated approaches to meeting the needs of people with multiple and complex needs, and emerging literature on providing harm reduction in the context of COVID-19. RESULTS: Those with lived/living experience of homelessness and problem substance use faced a range of additional challenges during the pandemic. Mental health and use of substances were affected, influenced by social isolation and access to services. A range of supports were provided which flexed over the lockdown period, including housing, health and social care, substance use treatment, and harm reduction. As well as documenting the additional risks encountered, findings describe COVID-19 as a 'path-breaking' event that created opportunities to get evidence into action, increase partnership working and communication, to proactively address risks. CONCLUSIONS: This rapid case study has described the significant impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on a group of people experiencing homelessness and problem substance use within one city centre in Scotland and provides a unique lens on service/professional responses. It concludes with lessons that can inform the international and ongoing response to this pandemic. It is vital to recognise the vision and leadership that has adapted organisational responses in order to reduce harms. We must learn from such successes that were motivated both by compassion and care for those vulnerable to harms and the desire to provide high-quality, evidence-based, harm reduction services.","Parkes, Tessa; Carver, Hannah; Masterton, Wendy; Falzon, Danilo; Dumbrell, Joshua; Grant, Susan; Wilson, Iain",Harm Reduct J,287,1

This elicits questions on the level of preparedness and capacity of health systems to respond to emergencies relative to other parts of the world. METHODS: This cross-sectional study uses publicly available core health data for 53 African countries to determine risk factors for cumulative COVID-19 deaths and cases per million in all countries in the continent. Descriptive statistics were determined for the indicators, and a negative binomial regression was used for modelling the risk factors. RESULTS: In sub-Saharan Africa, an increase in the number of nursing and midwifery personnel decreased the risk of COVID-19 deaths (p=0.0178), while a unit increase in universal healthcare (UHC) index of service coverage and prevalence of insufficient physical activity among adults increased the risk of COVID-19 deaths (p=0.0432 and p=0.0127). An increase in the proportion of infants initiating breast feeding reduced the number of cases per million (p<0.0001), while an increase in higher healthy life expectancy at birth increased the number of cases per million (p=0.0340). CONCLUSION: Despite its limited resources, Africa's preparedness and response to the COVID-19 pandemic can be improved by identifying and addressing specific gaps in the funding of health services delivery. These gaps impact negatively on service delivery in Africa, which requires more nursing personnel and increased UHC coverage to mitigate the effects of COVID-19.","Okeahalam, Charles; Williams, Victor; Otwombe, Kennedy",BMJ Open,287,1

While other countries deployed widespread testing as an early mitigation strategy, the U.S. experienced delays in development and deployment of organism identification assays. As such, there is uncertainty surrounding disease burden and community spread, severely hampering containment efforts. COVID-19 illuminates the need for a tiered diagnostic approach to rapidly identify clinically significant infections and reduce disease spread. Without the ability to efficiently screen patients, hospitals are overwhelmed, potentially delaying treatment for other emergencies. A multi-tiered, diagnostic strategy incorporating a rapid host immune response assay as a screening test, molecular confirmatory testing and rapid IgM/IgG testing to assess benefit from quarantine/further testing and provide information on population exposure/herd immunity would efficiently evaluate potential COVID-19 patients. Triaging patients within minutes with a fingerstick rather than hours/days after an invasive swab is critical to pandemic response as reliance on the existing strategy is limited by assay accuracy, time to results, and testing capacity. Early screening and triage is achievable from the outset of a pandemic with point-of-care host immune response testing which will improve response time to clinical and public health actions.Key messagesDelayed testing deployment has led to uncertainty surrounding overall disease burden and community spread, severely hampering public health containment and healthcare system preparation efforts.A multi-tiered testing strategy incorporating rapid, host immune point-of-care tests can be used now and for future pandemic planning by effectively identifying patients at risk of disease thereby facilitating quarantine earlier in the progression of the outbreak during the weeks and months it can take for pathogen specific confirmatory tests to be developed, validated and manufactured in sufficient quantities.The ability to triage patients at the point of care and support the guidance of medical and therapeutic decisions, for viral isolation or confirmatory testing or for appropriate treatment of COVID-19 and/or bacterial infections, is a critical component to our national pandemic response and there is an urgent need to implement the proposed strategy to combat the current outbreak.","Pulia, Michael S; O039,; Brien, Terrence P; Hou, Peter C; Schuman, Andrew; Sambursky, Robert",Ann Med,287,1

BACKGROUND: Burnout is a serious problem among nursing staff internationally with negative impacts on the quality of care and patient safety. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional online study among 1,004 Iranian nurses through the convenience sampling technique. Data were collected using the Maslach Burnout Inventory, five items of questions related to self-reported poor patient care quality and estimated occurrence of AEs. RESULTS: Prevalence of high burnout among nurses was 31.5%. The risk of AEs ranged from 26.1% to 71.7%. Self-reported quality of patient care was found to be poor. A positive correlation was found between emotional exhaustion and depersonalization scores and patient care quality, whereas a negative correlation was found between personal accomplishment scores and all poor care item scores. Depersonalization was found to increase the risk of the onset of all AEs (odds ratio [OR] = 1.06-1.08). Also, Personal accomplishmentreduced the risk of occurrence of 'medication errors' (OR = 0.99) and the onset of 'patient and their family verbal abuse' (OR = 0.97). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings confirmed the hypothesis that a higher degree of burnout is correlated with a perceived higher number of AEs and reduced perceived patient care quality. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING MANAGEMENT: Reducing burnout among nurses through implementing interventions may be an effective strategy to enhance patient care quality and reduce the number of AEs in Iranian public hospitals. Therefore, in order to minimize work burnout, primary approaches include access to psychosocial support, including Web-based services, psychological first aid, mental support hotlines and self-care techniques during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Kakemam, Edris; Chegini, Zahra; Rouhi, Amin; Ahmadi, Forouzan; Majidi, Soheila",J. nurs. manag,287,16

Data of this study were taken from the UAH's lecture which aired via Official Adi Hidayat Youtube account. Data analysis was carried out by transcribing the sermon, marking the information containing repetition and making analyzes. The results of this study conclude that not all forms of repetition styles are presented in UAH's preach, such as epistrophe. The styles of repetition contained in his preach consist of (1) epizeuxis, (2) tautotes, (3) anaphora, (4) symploce, (5) mesodiplosis, (6) epanalepsis, (7) anadiplosis. Besides, the finding also reveals the existence of two repetition styles in one data, namely (1) anaphora and tautotes, (2) epizeuxis and tautotes, and (3) anaphora and mesodiplosis. The styles of repetition used by UAH aim to emphasize the key points of the MUI fatwa so that it can be easily understood by audiences. It is proven by the dominance of the epizeuxis and tautotes style found in this study. The findings of repetition style in spoken discourse will be different from that of written discourse. The repetition style in spoken is spontaneous. Preachers generally develop their style until repetition becomes their characteristic.","Luthfi, Luthfi; Nuthihar, Rahmad; Rn, Herman; Wahdaniah, Wahdaniah",Bahastra,287,26

Also they used leaves with more abundance of closed, semi-open and open leaves of Heliconia sp., within a 5m radius around the leaf with bats. Probably they selected these leaves to roost because imply protection from weather conditions, and help to keep their body temperature constant. The abundance of opened leaves near the roost may keep away the bats from predators, since it could work as a long distance detector, transmitting predators movements.

Compared to many other countries Norway performs well in handling the crises and this must be understood in the context of competent politicians, a high trust society with a reliable and professional bureaucracy, a strong state, a good economic situation, a big welfare state and low density of the population. The government managed to control the pandemic rather quickly by adopting a suppression strategy, followed by a control strategy, based on a collaborative and pragmatic decision-making style, successful communication with the public, a lot of resources and a high level of citizens' trust in government. The alleged success of the Norwegian case is about the relationship between crisis management capacity and legitimacy.

During ischemia, succinate accumulates and its oxidation upon reperfusion by succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) drives ROS production. Inhibition of succinate accumulation and/or oxidation by dimethyl malonate (DMM), a cell permeable prodrug of the SDH inhibitor malonate, can decrease I/R injury. However, DMM is hydrolysed slowly, requiring administration to the heart prior to ischemia, precluding its administration to patients at the point of reperfusion, for example at the same time as unblocking a coronary artery following a heart attack. To accelerate malonate delivery, here we developed more rapidly hydrolysable malonate esters. METHODS: We synthesised a series of malonate esters and assessed their uptake and hydrolysis by isolated mitochondria, C2C12 cells and in mice in vivo. In addition, we assessed protection against cardiac I/R injury by the esters using an in vivo mouse model of acute myocardial infarction. RESULTS: We found that the diacetoxymethyl malonate diester (MAM) most rapidly delivered large amounts of malonate to cells in vivo. Furthermore, MAM could inhibit mitochondrial ROS production from succinate oxidation and was protective against I/R injury in vivo when added at reperfusion. CONCLUSIONS: The rapidly hydrolysed malonate prodrug MAM can protect against cardiac I/R injury in a clinically relevant mouse model.","Prag, Hiran A; Pala, Laura; Kula-Alwar, Duvaraka; Mulvey, John F; Luping, Du; Beach, Timothy E; Booty, Lee M; Hall, Andrew R; Logan, Angela; Sauchanka, Volha; Caldwell, Stuart T; Robb, Ellen L; James, Andrew M; Xu, Zhelong; Saeb-Parsy, Kourosh; Hartley, Richard C; Murphy, Michael P; Krieg, Thomas",Cardiovasc. drugs ther,287,29

The aim of this study is to explore the correlation between serum bilirubin level and mortality in patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI).Patients admitted with traumatic brain injury (TBI) in our hospital between January 2015 and January 2018 were enrolled in this study. Clinical and laboratory data of 361 patients were retrospectively collected to explore the independent risk factors of mortality.The comparison of baseline characteristics showed that non-survivors had lower Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) (Pâ<â.001) and higher level of serum total bilirubin (TBIL) (Pâ<â.001) and direct bilirubin (DBIL) (Pâ<â.001). We found that only GCS (Pâ<â.001), glucose (Pâ<â.001), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (Pâ=â.042) and DBIL (Pâ=â.005) were significant risk factors in multivariate logistic regression analysis. GCS and DBIL had comparable AUC value (0.778 vs 0.750, Pâ>â.05) on predicting mortality in TBI patients.

Nevertheless, cesarean section has a higher risk and might have more complications compared with natural delivery. A reasonable choice of delivery method is important for maternal and neonatal health. The incidence of complications after cesarean section for mothers and neonates during the second stage of labor significantly increases compared with planned cesarean section. During the second stage of labor, the fetal head is deep in the pelvic cavity. If a cesarean section is performed at this stage, it is prone to causing complications, including difficult delivery of the fetal head, delayed uterine incision, and massive hemorrhage, which seriously threaten the health of the mother and her neonate. For the first time, we report a case of cesarean section after complete opening of the uterine orifice, which led to almost mistakenly suturing the cervix to the uterus. This report will hopefully help surgeons anticipate such incidents during cesarean section in the future.","Zhan, Jun; Xing, Aiyun; Tan, Xi",J Int Med Res,287,20
434728,434728,434728,Generating evidence for therapeutic effects: the need for well-conducted randomized trials,14.770159,8.2936,2021,"BACKGROUND: Obesity is currently a worldwide health crisis. Nurses are integral members of the primary health care team and have an important role in managing obesity and administering physical activity (PA) for patients. However, research shows that nurses tend to be overweight or obese, have poor metabolic health, and do not meet PA recommendations. This is problematic because PA is linked to both physiological and psychological well-being and may also influence how nurses counsel their patients. Nursing students are the next generation of nurses; however, there is limited research examining PA (among other lifestyle factors) and metabolic health in nursing students. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this research is to examine multiple lifestyle factors (including PA, nutrition, sleep, and stress) and determine whether these factors are associated with metabolic health in full-time undergraduate nursing students. METHODS: An estimated 320 nursing students (18 years of age and older) will be assessed for their metabolic health. Metabolic status will be determined by measuring body mass index (BMI), waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), body fat percentage [skinfold measures (FitSystems Inc)], resting blood pressure [automated oscillatory (Omron Healthcare Inc)], and fasting blood glucose (glucometer). Lifestyle factors will also be measured, including PA and sleep [the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) and 7-day accelerometry (wGT3X-BT, Actigraph LLC)], nutrition [3-day diet log (Nutritionist Pro, Axxya Systems)], and stress [the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale, heart rate variability assessments, and salivary cortisol (ELISA, Eagle Biosciences)]. The association between metabolic status and PA, sleep quantity and quality, nutrition, and stress will be examined by linear regression analyses. Differences by year of study in metabolic health status, PA, sleep, nutrition, and stress will be examined by 1-way analyses of variance (ANOVAs). To determine the ability of PA, sleep, nutrition, and stress to discriminate prevalent overweight and obesity or poor metabolic status, logistic regression and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves will be constructed. Statistical analyses will be performed in Stata (version 16.1, StataCorp LLC). RESULTS: Based on pilot data, we believe senior nursing students will have worse metabolic health (ie, higher BMI and WHR, increased body fat percentage, higher blood pressure, and increased fasting blood glucose) compared to first-year students. We hypothesize that poor PA participation, poor sleep quantity and quality, increased food intake, poor nutrition, and increased stress will be associated with worse metabolic health in full-time nursing students. The study received funding in February 2020. Due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, work on this study has been delayed. We are currently completing our application for institutional research ethics approval. Data collection is projected to begin in January 2021, with data collection and analyses expected to be completed by May 2022. CONCLUSIONS: This study will be the first published research to examine the relationship between lifestyle choices and metabolic status in nursing students attending a Canadian institution. More importantly, the results of this study will support the development of an informed intervention that will target the identified lifestyle factors, improving the physiological and mental health and well-being of nursing students.

The negative impact of COVID-19 is widespread and includes not only people who contracted the disease but also those with chronic morbidities such as diabetes whose care is compromised due to diversion of medical resources. People with diabetes are generally more susceptible to infection as a result of altered immunity. People with diabetes have a worse prognosis from COVID-19 and there is evidence to suggest that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 may directly affect pancreatic function precipitating hyperglycaemic crises. In the United Kingdom, one of the most heavily affected countries, guidelines are in place to unify the management of people with diabetes hospitalized for COVID-19.

While acute and intermediate interactions between SARS-CoV-2 and the immune system have been studied extensively, long-term impacts on the cellular immune system remain to be analyzed. Here, we comprehensively characterized immunological changes in peripheral blood mononuclear cells in 49 COVID-19-convalescent individuals (CI) in comparison to 27 matched SARS-CoV-2-unexposed individuals (UI). Despite recovery from the disease for more than 2 months, CI showed significant decreases in frequencies of invariant NKT and NKT-like cells compared to UI. Concomitant with the decrease in NKT-like cells, an increase in the percentage of annexin V and 7-aminoactinomycin D (7-AAD) double-positive NKT-like cells was detected, suggesting that the reduction in NKT-like cells results from cell death months after recovery. Significant increases in regulatory T cell frequencies and TIM-3 expression on CD4 and CD8 T cells were also observed in CI, while the cytotoxic potential of T cells and NKT-like cells, defined by granzyme B (GzmB) expression, was significantly diminished. However, both CD4 and CD8 T cells of CI showed increased Ki67 expression and were fully able to proliferate and produce effector cytokines upon T cell receptor (TCR) stimulation. Collectively, we provide a comprehensive characterization of immune signatures in patients recovering from SARS-CoV-2 infection, suggesting that the cellular immune system of COVID-19 patients is still under a sustained influence even months after the recovery from disease.IMPORTANCE Wuhan was the very first city hit by SARS-CoV-2. Accordingly, the patients who experienced the longest phase of convalescence following COVID-19 reside here. This enabled us to investigate the ""immunological scar"" left by SARS-CoV-2 on cellular immunity after recovery from the disease. In this study, we characterized the long-term impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on the immune system and provide a comprehensive picture of cellular immunity of a convalescent COVID-19 patient cohort with the longest recovery time. We revealed that the cellular immune system of COVID-19 patients is still under a sustained influence even months after the recovery from disease; in particular, a profound NKT cell impairment was found in the convalescent phase of COVID-19.","Liu, Jia; Yang, Xuecheng; Wang, Hua; Li, Ziwei; Deng, Hui; Liu, Jing; Xiong, Shue; He, Junyi; Feng, Xuemei; Guo, Chunxia; Wang, Weixian; Zelinskyy, Gennadiy; Trilling, Mirko; Sutter, Kathrin; Senff, Tina; Menne, Christopher; Timm, Joerg; Zhang, Yanfang; Deng, Fei; Lu, Yinping; Wu, Jun; Lu, Mengji; Yang, Dongliang; Dittmer, Ulf; Wang, Baoju; Zheng, Xin",mBio (Online),287,16

Outbreak response measures also have immediate and long-term gendered effects. However, gender-based analysis of outbreaks and responses is limited by lack of data and little integration of feminist analysis within global health scholarship. Recognising these barriers, this paper applies a gender matrix methodology, grounded in feminist political economy approaches, to evaluate the gendered effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and response in four case studies: China, Hong Kong, Canada, and the UK. Through a rapid scoping of documentation of the gendered effects of the outbreak, it applies the matrix framework to analyse findings, identifying common themes across the case studies: financial discrimination, crisis in care, and unequal risks and secondary effects. Results point to transnational structural conditions which put women on the front lines of the pandemic at work and at home while denying them health, economic and personal security - effects that are exacerbated where racism and other forms of discrimination intersect with gender inequities. Given that women and people living at the intersections of multiple inequities are made additionally vulnerable by pandemic responses, intersectional feminist responses should be prioritised at the beginning of any crises.","Smith, Julia; Davies, Sara E; Feng, Huiyun; Gan, Connie C R; Grépin, Karen A; Harman, Sophie; Herten-Crabb, Asha; Morgan, Rosemary; Vandan, Nimisha; Wenham, Clare",Glob Public Health,287,1

The decision to administer antibiotics early in the course of SARS-CoV-2 infection depends on the likelihood of bacterial coinfection. METHODS: We performed a retrospective chart review of all patients admitted through the emergency department with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection over a 6-week period in a large healthcare system in the United States. Blood and respiratory culture results were abstracted and adjudicated by multiple authors. The primary outcome was the rate of bacteremia. We secondarily looked to define clinical or laboratory features associated with bacteremia. RESULTS: There were 542 patients admitted with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, with an average age of 62.8 years. Of these, 395 had blood cultures performed upon admission, with six true positive results (1.1% of the total population). An additional 14 patients had positive respiratory cultures treated as true pathogens in the first 72 h. Low blood pressure and elevated white blood cell count, neutrophil count, blood urea nitrogen, and lactate were statistically significantly associated with bacteremia. Clinical outcomes were not statistically significantly different between patients with and without bacteremia. CONCLUSIONS: We found a low rate of bacteremia in patients admitted with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. In hemodynamically stable patients, routine antibiotics may not be warranted in this population.","Lardaro, Thomas; Wang, Alfred Z; Bucca, Antonino; Croft, Alexander; Glober, Nancy; Holt, Daniel B; Musey, Paul I; Peterson, Kelli D; Trigonis, Russell A; Schaffer, Jason T; Hunter, Benton R",J. med. virol,287,20

METHODS: We performed a systematic literature search from PubMed, Scopus, and Embase databases from inception of databases up until 7 March 2021. Studies that met all of the following criteria were included: 1) observational studies or randomized controlled trials that report COVID-19 patients, 2) reporting DPP-4 inhibitor use, 3) mortality, and 4) mortality based on DPP-4 inhibitor use. The exposure was DPP-4 inhibitor, defined as DPP-4 inhibitor use that started prior to COVID-19 hospitalization. The control group was patients with no exposure to DPP-4 inhibitor. The outcome was mortality. The pooled effect estimate was reported as risk ratio (RR). RESULTS: There were 4,477 patients from 9 studies in this systematic review and meta-analysis. 31% of (15%, 46%) the patients use DPP-4 inhibitor. Mortality occurs in 23% (15%, 31%) of the patients. DPP-4 inhibitor was associated with lower mortality in patients with COVID-19 (RR 0.76 [0.60, 0.97], p = 0.030, I2: 44.5%, p = 0.072). Meta-regression analysis showed that the association between DPP-4 inhibitor and mortality was significantly affected by metformin (RR 1.02 [1.00, 1.04], p = 0.048) and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker (ACEI/ARB) use (RR 1.04 [1.01, 1.07], p = 0.006), but not age (p = 0.759), sex (reference: male, p = 0.148), and hypertension (p = 0.218). CONCLUSION: DPP-4 inhibitor use was associated with lower mortality in COVID-19 patients, and the association was weaker in patients who were also taking metformin and/or ACE inhibitors.","Rakhmat, Iis Inayati; Kusmala, Yudith Yunia; Handayani, Dewi Ratih; Juliastuti, Henny; Nawangsih, Eka Noneng; Wibowo, Arief; Lim, Michael Anthonius; Pranata, Raymond",Diabetes Metab Syndr,287,13

Reports from around the world are showing mounting number of cases even in healthcare professionals spite of usage of adequate personal protective equipment. There are a number of factors which could account for this, be it the affinity of the virus to the respiratory and other mucosa or to patient risk factors for developing severe forms of the disease. In view of the growing need for resuming other medical services, it is essential to find newer ways to protect ourselves better, whether by systemic or topical mucosal prophylaxis with various medications or lifestyle changes promoting wellbeing and immunity. This article discusses additional prophylactic measures including drug repurposing or new indication paradigms to render protection. Certain medications such as chloroquine, trehalose, antihistaminics, and interferons used topically for various ocular conditions with reasonably good safety records are known to have anti-viral properties. Hence, can be harnessed in preventing SARS-CoV-2 attachment, entry, and/or replication in host cells. Similarly, use of hypertonic saline for nasal and oral mucosa and dietary changes are possible methods of improving our resistance. These additional prophylactic measures can be cautiously explored by healthcare professionals to protect themselves and their patients.","Shetty, Rohit; Lalgudi, Vaitheeswaran Ganesan; Khamar, Pooja; Gupta, Krati; Sethu, Swaminathan; Nair, Archana; Honavar, Santosh G; Ghosh, Arkasubhra; D039,; Souza, Sharon",Indian J Ophthalmol,287,22

Objectives: The objective of this study was to determine patient and provider satisfaction with telemedicine visits at a community-based hospital in the United States. Methods: Patients and providers were electronically surveyed at the end of 2020 regarding telemedicine visit experiences. These visits took place throughout the majority of 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic. Results: A total of 85.7% (6) of providers reported spending the same or less time on telemedicine visits compared with in-person visits. All providers were either somewhat or very satisfied with the interpersonal connections made in telemedicine visits. All providers wished to see telemedicine visits continued in the future. A total of 355 patients responded. Over 90% of participants reported feeling comfortable speaking to their provider about personal issues through telemedicine. Around 73.2% of patients were very satisfied with their telemedicine visit. Around 69.8% of patients report that they would like to use either primarily telemedicine visits or a combination of telemedicine and in-person visits when it is safe to return to in-person care. Conclusions: Patients and providers exhibited high levels of satisfaction with telemedicine use in a weight management center. They both wish to see these visit types offered in the future. Patients who saved more than 30 min of time traveling with a telemedicine visit were significantly more likely to show high levels of satisfaction. Patients who found it easier to connect with the virtual platforms also were significantly more likely to have higher satisfaction levels.,"Vosburg, Ralph Wesley; Robinson, Kortney A; Gao, Chuanyun; Kim, Julie J",Telemed. j. e. health,287,1

During 2004-2018, an average of 702 heat-related deaths occurred in the United States annually. To study patterns in heat-related deaths by age group, sex, race/ethnicity, and level of urbanization, and to explore comorbid conditions associated with deaths resulting from heat exposure, CDC analyzed nationally comprehensive mortality data from the National Vital Statistics System (NVSS).* The rate of heat-related mortality tended to be higher among males, persons aged &#8805;65 years, non-Hispanic American Indian/Alaska Natives, and persons living in noncore nonmetropolitan and large central metropolitan counties. Natural heat exposure was a contributing cause of deaths attributed to certain chronic medical conditions and other external causes. Preparedness and response initiatives directed toward extreme heat events, currently underway at local, state, and national levels, can contribute to reducing morbidity and mortality associated with natural heat exposure. Successful public health interventions to mitigate heat-related deaths include conducting outreach to vulnerable communities to increase awareness of heat-related symptoms and provide guidance for staying cool and hydrated, particularly for susceptible groups at risk such as young athletes and persons who are older or socially isolated (2). Improved coordination across various health care sectors could inform local activities to protect health during periods of high heat. For instance, jurisdictions can monitor weather conditions and syndromic surveillance data to guide timing of risk communication and other measures (e.g., developing and implementing heat response plans, facilitating communication and education activities) to prevent heat-related mortality in the United States. CDC also recommends that federal, state, local, and tribal jurisdictions open cooling centers or provide access to public locations with air conditioning for persons in need of a safe, cool, environment during hot weather conditions. In light of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, CDC updated its guidance on the use of cooling centers to provide best practices (e.g., potential changes to staffing procedures, separate areas for persons with symptoms of COVID-19, and physical distancing) to reduce the risk for introducing and transmitting SARS COV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, into cooling centers.§.","Vaidyanathan, Ambarish; Malilay, Josephine; Schramm, Paul; Saha, Shubhayu",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,287,21

Many have praised the approach to be a platform for a new era of computing and some have argued that it is in fact a step backward. Though, both sides agree that there exist challenges that must be addressed in order to better utilize its potentials. This paper surveys existing challenges toward vast adoption of serverless services and also explores some of the challenges that have not been thoroughly discussed in the previous studies. Each challenge is discussed thoroughly and a number of possible directions for future studies is proposed.

It is freezing if there is an order on states such that the state evolution of any node is non-decreasing in any orbit. They are commonly used to model epidemic propagation, diffusion phenomena like bootstrap percolation or cristal growth. In this paper we establish how treewidth and maximum degree of the underlying graph are key parameters which influence the overall computational complexity of finite freezing automata networks. First, we define a general model checking formalism that captures many classical decision problems: prediction, nilpotency, predecessor, asynchronous reachability. Then, on one hand, we present an efficient parallel algorithm that solves the general model checking problem in NC for any graph with bounded degree and bounded treewidth. On the other hand, we show that these problems are hard in their respective classes when restricted to families of graph with polynomially growing treewidth. For prediction, predecessor and asynchronous reachability, we establish the hardness result with a fixed set-defiend update rule that is universally hard on any input graph of such families.","Goles, Eric; Montealegre, Pedro; R'ios-Wilson, Mart'in; Theyssier, Guillaume",,287,12

Ending the global SARS-CoV-2 pandemic requires implementation of multiple population-wide strategies, including social distancing, testing and contact tracing. We propose a new model that predicts the course of the epidemic to help plan an effective control strategy. The model considers eight stages of infection: susceptible (S), infected (I), diagnosed (D), ailing (A), recognized (R), threatened (T), healed (H) and extinct (E), collectively termed SIDARTHE. Our SIDARTHE model discriminates between infected individuals depending on whether they have been diagnosed and on the severity of their symptoms. The distinction between diagnosed and non-diagnosed individuals is important because the former are typically isolated and hence less likely to spread the infection. This delineation also helps to explain misperceptions of the case fatality rate and of the epidemic spread. We compare simulation results with real data on the COVID-19 epidemic in Italy, and we model possible scenarios of implementation of countermeasures. Our results demonstrate that restrictive social-distancing measures will need to be combined with widespread testing and contact tracing to end the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.","Giordano, Giulia; Blanchini, Franco; Bruno, Raffaele; Colaneri, Patrizio; Di Filippo, Alessandro; Di Matteo, Angela; Colaneri, Marta",Nat Med,287,24

Due to the pandemic, we were required to conduct our teacher education courses synchronously online through video-conferencing software. Although this mode of instruction allowed us to continue teaching despite the restrictions necessitated by COVID-19, the relational aspect of teaching and the role of care seemed to be limited and became an important concern for us. Through self-study, we aimed to improve our online teaching practices by enacting a pedagogy of care during one full semester. We detail our attempts to conceptualise a pedagogy of care for the online classroom, begin our courses from a position of care and prioritize and maintain care throughout the semester. We also present the ongoing challenges we experienced in implementing a pedagogy of care online. While recognising that everyone has been affected by COVID-19 in different ways, we hope through sharing our experiences, others can learn from them and conceptualise and implement a pedagogy of care in their contexts.

There is limited evidence about SARS-CoV-2 viral load in placenta. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between SARS-CoV-2 viral load in placenta and clinical development of HDP after COVID-19 throughout different periods of gestation. MethodsThis was a case-control study in women with and without gestational hypertensive disorders (HDP) after SARS-CoV-2 infection diagnosed by RT-PCR during pregnancy. Patients were matched by gestational age at the moment of COVID-19 diagnosis. We performed an analysis of SARS-CoV-2 RNA levels in placenta. ResultsA total of 28 women were enrolled. Sixteen patients were diagnosed with COVID-19 during the third trimester and the remaining twelve patients in the others trimesters. Ten placentas (35.7%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2, nine of them (90%) belonged to the HDP group versus one (10%) in control group (p=0.009). Those cases with the highest loads of viral RNA developed severe-preeclampsia. ConclusionThe presence of SARS-CoV-2 was more frequent in placentas of patients with HDP after COVID-19. There seems to be a relationship between high viral load in the placenta and the development of hypertensive disorders. We found SARS-CoV-2 viral load in placenta after birth in mothers infected at the first half of pregnancy, but with negative nasopharyngeal RT-PCR at delivery. Our data suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy could trigger gestational hypertensive disorders through placenta-related mechanisms.","FABRE, MARTA; CALVO, PILAR; RUIZ-MARTINEZ, SARA; PERAN, MARIA; OROS, DANIEL; MEDEL, ANA; STRUNK, MARK; BENITO, RAFAEL; SCHOORLEMMER, JON; PAULES, CRISTINA",,287,30

This is a worldwide reality, and it occurs as the demand for healthcare is vastly superior to the clinical resources in public systems. Moreover, this phenomenon has worsened due to the COVID-19 sanitary crisis. In order to reduce the impact of this situation, patients in the waiting lists are ranked according to a priority. However, the existing prioritization strategies are not necessarily systematized, and they usually respond only to clinical criteria, excluding other dimensions such as the personal and social context of patients. In this paper, we present a decision-support system designed for the prioritization of surgical waiting lists based on biopsychosocial criteria. The proposed system features three methodological contributions;first, an ad-hoc medical record form that captures the biopsychosocial condition of the patients;second, a dynamic scoring scheme that recognizes that patients' conditions evolve differently while waiting for the required elective surgery;and third, a methodology for prioritizing and selecting patients based on the corresponding dynamic scores and additional clinical criteria. The designed decision-support system was implemented in the otorhinolaryngology unit in the Hospital of Talca, Chile, in 2018. When compared to the previous prioritization methodology, the results obtained from the use of the system during 2018 and 2019 show that this new methodology outperforms the previous prioritization method quantitatively and qualitatively. As a matter of fact, the designed system allowed a decrease, from 2017 to 2019, in the average number of days in the waiting list from 462 to 282 days.","Silva-Aravena, F.; Alvarez-Miranda, E.; Astudillo, C.

Therefore, it is important to understand COVID-19 characteristics across different countries. Methods: This is a cross-sectional descriptive study of 525 hospitalized symptomatic COVID-19 patients, from the central federal hospital in Dubai-UAE during period of March to August 2020. Results: UAE's COVID-19 patients were relatively young; mean (SD) of the age 49(15) years, 130 (25%) were older than 60 and 4 (<1%) were younger than 18 years old. Majority were male(47; 78%). The mean (SD) BMI was 29 (6) kg/m2. While the source of contracting COVID-19 was not known in 369 (70%) of patients, 29 (6%) reported travel to overseas-country and 127 (24%) reported contact with another COVID-19 case/s. At least one comorbidity was present in 284 (54%) of patients and 241 (46%) had none. The most common comorbidities were diabetes (177; 34%) and hypertension (166; 32%). The mean (SD) of symptoms duration was 6 (3) days. The most common symptoms at hospitalization were fever (340; 65%), cough (296; 56%), and shortness of breath (SOB) (243; 46%). Most of the laboratory values were within normal range, but (184; 35%) of patients had lymphopenia, 43 (8%) had neutrophilia, and 116 (22%) had prolong international normalized ratio (INR), and 317 (60%) had high D-dimer.

Malta has one large acute general hospital, Mater Dei (MDH). This study retrospectively analysed these declines since soft lockdown commencing on the 13th March 2020 in a population-based study, the first of its kind. METHODS: Data was obtained as anonymised totals from MDH Clinical Performance Unit. Poisson regression was used to model the counts of weekly A&E attendances and hospital admissions. RESULTS: Outpatient attendances declined in March, stabilised in April 2020 and started to climb in May. April attendances fell to 18.8% in paediatrics and 23.4% in adults of the average of the previous January and February. A&E attendances showed the same pattern, down to 22.5% and all specialities registered a decline, paediatric > adult. Attendances dropped from circa 2600 to 588/month/100,000 population. These declines were abrupt after the second week of March. MDH admissions showed the same patterns, down from circa 1800 to 757/month/100,000 population. All declines were statistically significant.

METHODS: We retrospectively report on 1061 SARS-CoV-2 positive tested patients treated for at least three days with the following regimen: HCQ (200 mg three times daily for ten days) + AZ (500 mg on day 1 followed by 250 mg daily for the next four days). Outcomes were death, clinical worsening (transfer to ICU, and >10 day hospitalization) and viral shedding persistence (>10 days). RESULTS: A total of 1061 patients were included in this analysis (46.4% male, mean age 43.6 years - range 14-95 years). Good clinical outcome and virological cure were obtained in 973 patients within 10 days (91.7%). Prolonged viral carriage was observed in 47 patients (4.4%) and was associated to a higher viral load at diagnosis (p < .001) but viral culture was negative at day 10. All but one, were PCR-cleared at day 15. A poor clinical outcome (PClinO) was observed for 46 patients (4.3%) and 8 died (0.75%) (74-95 years old). All deaths resulted from respiratory failure and not from cardiac toxicity. Five patients are still hospitalized (98.7% of patients cured so far). PClinO was associated with older age (OR 1.11), severity of illness at admission (OR 10.05) and low HCQ serum concentration. PClinO was independently associated with the use of selective beta-blocking agents and angiotensin II receptor blockers (p < .05). A total of 2.3% of patients reported mild adverse events (gastrointestinal or skin symptoms, headache, insomnia and transient blurred vision). CONCLUSION: Administration of the HCQ+AZ combination before COVID-19 complications occur is safe and associated with a very low fatality rate in patients.","Million, Matthieu; Lagier, Jean-Christophe; Gautret, Philippe; Colson, Philippe; Fournier, Pierre-Edouard; Amrane, Sophie; Hocquart, Marie; Mailhe, Morgane; Esteves-Vieira, Vera; Doudier, Barbara; Aubry, Camille; Correard, Florian; Giraud-Gatineau, Audrey; Roussel, Yanis; Berenger, Cyril; Cassir, Nadim; Seng, Piseth; Zandotti, Christine; Dhiver, Catherine; Ravaux, Isabelle; Tomei, Christelle; Eldin, Carole; Tissot-Dupont, Hervé; Honoré, Stéphane; Stein, Andreas; Jacquier, Alexis; Deharo, Jean-Claude; Chabrière, Eric; Levasseur, Anthony; Fenollar, Florence; Rolain, Jean-Marc; Obadia, Yolande; Brouqui, Philippe; Drancourt, Michel; La Scola, Bernard; Parola, Philippe; Raoult, Didier",Travel Med Infect Dis,287,24

In this study, we evaluated the prevalence and severity of depression, anxiety, stress, and stress perception among a group of patients with COVID-19 who were hospitalized. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, 106 inpatients with COVID-19 who had stable clinical conditions were evaluated psychologically by two questionnaires: Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scales-21 (DASS-21) and Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-4). Results: More than one third of patients had underlying disease. Overall, 97.2% of patients with COVID-19 had some degree of depression. Severity of depression, according to the DASS questionnaire, was 85.8%. All patients (100%) had severe (0.9%) and very severe (99.1%) anxiety. Regarding to stress levels, 97.1% of patients had some degree of stress. In the severity of stress category, 84.9% of patients had severe and very severe stress. In terms of perceived stress, 73.6% of patients had high levels and 22.6% had moderate levels. A positive strong correlation was found between depression and perceived stress (Coefficient: 0.33, P-value: 0.001). Correlation between anxiety and perceived stress was statistically significant (Coefficient: 0.2, P-value: 0.04). Conclusions: The existence of such a high prevalence and severity of psychiatric disorders among hospitalized patients with COVID-19 underscores the need for serious attention to the mental health status of these patients. It seems that health policymakers need to have coherent plans for screening cases and managing related situations.","Zandifar, Atefeh; Badrfam, Rahim; Yazdani, Shahrooz; Arzaghi, Seyed Masoud; Rahimi, Fatemeh; Ghasemi, Somayeh; Khamisabadi, Somayeh; Mohammadian Khonsari, Nami; Qorbani, Mostafa",J Diabetes Metab Disord,287,16

The problem is to recover the representation of an image R(x), if we are only given a corrupted version A(x), for some known forward operator A. We propose a supervised inversion method that uses a contrastive objective to obtain excellent representations for highly corrupted images. Using a linear probe on our robust representations, we achieve a higher accuracy than end-to-end supervised baselines when classifying images with various types of distortions, including blurring, additive noise, and random pixel masking. We evaluate on a subset of ImageNet and observe that our method is robust to varying levels of distortion.

COVID-19 cases among prisoners are on the rise, with more than 143,000 confirmed cases to date. However, there is paucity of data addressing clinical outcomes and mortality in prisoners hospitalized with COVID-19. An observational study of all patients hospitalized with COVID-19 between March 10 and May 10, 2020 at two Henry Ford Health System hospitals in Michigan. Clinical outcomes were compared amongst hospitalized prisoners and non-prisoner patients. The primary outcomes were intubation rates, in-hospital mortality, and 30-day mortality. Multivariable logistic regression and Cox-regression models were used to investigate primary outcomes. Of the 706 hospitalized COVID-19 patients (mean age 66.7 ± 16.1 years, 57% males, and 44% black), 108 were prisoners and 598 were non-prisoners. Compared to non-prisoners, prisoners were more likely to present with fever, tachypnea, hypoxemia, and markedly elevated inflammatory markers. Prisoners were more commonly admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) (26.9% vs. 18.7%), required vasopressors (24.1% vs. 9.9%), and intubated (25.0% vs. 15.2%). Prisoners had higher unadjusted inpatient mortality (29.6% vs. 20.1%) and 30-day mortality (34.3% vs. 24.6%). In the adjusted models, prisoner status was associated with higher in-hospital death (odds ratio, 2.32; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.33 to 4.05) and 30-day mortality (hazard ratio, 2.00; 95% CI, 1.33 to 3.00). In this cohort of hospitalized COVID-19 patients, prisoner status was associated with more severe clinical presentation, higher rates of ICU admissions, vasopressors requirement, intubation, in-hospital mortality, and 30-day mortality.","Altibi, Ahmed M; Pallavi, Bhargava; Liaqat, Hassan; Slota, Alexander A; Sheth, Radhika; Al Jebbawi, Lama; George, Matthew E; LeDuc, Allison; Abdallah, Enas; Russell, Luke R; Jain, Saniya; Shirvanian, Nariné; Masri, Ahmad; Kak, Vivek",Sci Rep,287,24

This paper has proposed a mathematical model for studying its transmission dynamics in the presence of face mask wearing and hospitalization services of human population in Tanzania. Disease-free and endemic equilibria were determined and subsequently their local and global stabilities were carried out. The trace-determinant approach was used in the local stability of disease-free equilibrium point while Lyapunov function technique was used to determine the global stability of both disease-free and endemic equilibrium points. Basic reproduction number, R 0 , was determined in which its numerical results revealed that, in the presence of face masks wearing and medication services or hospitalization as preventive measure for its transmission, R 0 = 0.698 while in their absence R 0 = 3.8 . This supports its analytical solution that the disease-free equilibrium point E 0 is asymptotically stable whenever R 0 < 1 , while endemic equilibrium point E &#8727; is globally asymptotically stable for R 0 > 1 . Therefore, this paper proves the necessity of face masks wearing and hospitalization services to COVID-19 patients to contain the disease spread to the population.","Mumbu, Abdul-Rahman J; Hugo, Alfred K",J Biol Dyn,287,26

People faced social distancing, being forced to stay at home. Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) typically influences life habits and psycho-social relationship. It is now questionable how PAD can be affected by changes in lifestyle imposed by the Sars-CoV-19 Pandemic. This study's main objective is to evaluate how the limitations of social behavior set by Sars-CoV-19 Pandemic impact the perception and evolution of the disease in a group of patients with a diagnosed PAD. METHODS: The changes in the in the perception and the evolution of the PAD were evaluated by comparing results of a modified VascuQol-6 quality of life (QoL) survey referring to the time frame defined ""No-Sars-CoV-2 period"" (from July to December 2019) with results referring to the time frame defined ""Sars-CoV-2 period"" (from January to June 2020). An overall score (range 4-60) was calculated, and a comparison between the two period studies was reported. Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) Curves evaluated a delta value for each patient with revascularization of lower limb peripheral arteries. Optimal cut-offs were chosen based on their specificity, sensitivity. RESULTS: One-hundred-two PAD patients gave their informed consent to take part in the study. A significant general worsening of patients PAD perception in the Sars-CoV-2 period was recorded for the following items: lower limbs health status perception; overall activity limitation; walking ability limitation; overall daily walking distance; lower limbs fatigue perception; concerns about PAD worsening; pain discomfort (P < 0.05). The pain intensity changed from 4.7 ± 2.9 in the No-Sars-CoV-2 period to 6.3 ± 2.9 in the Sars-CoV-2 period significantly (P < 0.0001), even though analgesic drug intake did not increase considerably in Sars-CoV-2 period (Pâ¯=â¯0.15). The overall score was 20.3 ± 7.4 for the No-Sars-CoV-2 period and 27.4 ± 7.6 in the Sars-CoV-2 period (Pâ¯=â¯0.0001). The ROC curve built to analyze the relation between Delta-score and the need for revascularization identifies a cut-off > 8.5 (Area Under the Curve 0.5436; CI 95% 0.4252 to 0.6620) with a sensitivity and specificity respectively of 52.6% (CI 95% 37.26-67.52%) and 65.6% (CI 95% 53.40-76.08%). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with PAD were significantly hit by all the restrictions and the social limitations imposed to reduce the Sars-CoV-19 virus diffusion. Our study confirms that the perception and the evolution of PAD were significantly affected during the ""Sars-CoV-2 period"".","de Donato, Gianmarco; Pasqui, Edoardo; Alba, Giuseppe; Abu Leil, Mustafa; Palasciano, Giancarlo",Ann. vasc. surg,287,20

It is a good candidate to be treated with gene therapy, in which moderately low levels of enzyme activity should be sufficient for clinical efficacy. In the present work we have evaluated the efficacy of a non-viral vector based on solid lipid nanoparticles (SLN) to increase α-Gal A activity in an FD mouse model after intravenous administration. The SLN-based vector incremented α-Gal A activity to about 10%, 15%, 20% and 14% of the levels of the wild-type in liver, spleen, heart and kidney, respectively. In addition, the SLN-based vector significantly increased α-Gal A activity with respect to the naked pDNA used as a control in plasma, heart and kidney.

We exploit this history to investigate the possible role of health policy in the outcome. Using three different measures of the death rate, we find to a varying degree, evidence that the level of public expenditure on health has made a difference to the state-wise mortality rate. Based on this, we proceeded to analyse the expenditure pattern in the states. The average level of expenditure on health is found to be low both of itself and in relation to spending by governments in South and Southeast Asia. In much of the territory of India spending on the police exceeds that of spending on health. Furthermore, richer states spend relatively less on it, implying that spending on health is a matter of choice for states rather than dictated by financial constraints. Two conclusions follow. First, some of the mortality from COVID-19 is policy induced, and therefore was avoidable. Second, though the evidence is drawn from the experience with COVID-19, we may assume that assuring health security to the Indian population would require a radical restructuring of the spending priorities of the states.","Balakrishnan, Pulapre; Namboodhiry, Sreenath K",Indian Econ Rev,287,10

RECENT FINDINGS: Disrupted or disordered sleep can be associated with increased morbidity and mortality, the risk of cardiovascular events, increased seizure frequency, and altered immune responses. Studies have implicated disrupted sleep and circadian rhythm dysfunction with both amyloid-ß (Aß) deposition and tau deposition. A bidirectional relationship exists between disrupted sleep and the progression of Alzheimer disease pathology. Insomnia has been reported as a prodromal symptom in autoimmune encephalitis. Primary sleep disorders have now been increasingly recognized as a common comorbid condition in multiple sclerosis, making it imperative that neurologists feel comfortable differentiating multiple sclerosis fatigue from excessive daytime sleepiness caused by primary sleep disorders to optimally treat their patients. SUMMARY: Sleep disorders are common across the population. By recognizing sleep disorders in patients with neurologic conditions, neurologists can provide comprehensive care and, in some cases, reduce neurologic disease burden.","Benjamin, Sara E",Continuum (Minneap Minn),287,14

Here we show that using a new multiplexed set of primers in conjunction with the Oxford Nanopore Rapid Barcode library kit allows for faster, simpler, and less expensive SARS-CoV-2 genome sequencing. This primer set results in amplicons that exhibit lower levels of variation in coverage compared to other commonly used primer sets. Using five SARS-CoV-2 patient samples with Cq values between 20 and 31, we show that high-quality genomes can be generated with as few as 10 000 reads (â¼5 Mbp of sequence data). We also show that mis-classification of barcodes, which may be more likely when using the Oxford Nanopore Rapid Barcode library prep, is unlikely to cause problems in variant calling. This method reduces the time from RNA to genome sequence by more than half compared to the more standard ligation-based Oxford Nanopore library preparation method at considerably lower costs.","Freed, Nikki E; Vlková, Markéta; Faisal, Muhammad B; Silander, Olin K",Biol Methods Protoc,287,16

This study examined the impact of sheltering in place and social distancing among adults aged 60 and older during the 2020 outbreak of COVID-19 in the United States. Methods. Using convenience sampling respondents were asked to complete a web-administered survey to explore impact of social distancing on loneliness, stress, and behavioral changes. The analytic sample consisted of 833 responses of persons aged 60 and older. Results. A large portion reported being stressed (36%), and/or being lonely (42.5%). Nearly 1/3 stated that their sense of loneliness increased during the time of social distancing. Respondents reported engaging in more solitary activity (and fewer in-person activities), using email and text messages more than usual, and spending more time on computers/tablet than usual. Approximately 2/3 reported using more social media than usual. These differed significantly by younger (age 60-70) and older (71+) respondents. Additionally, changes in physical activity, drinking, recreational drug use and sleeping pattern changes differed by age. Conclusions. Social distancing has significant consequences on loneliness and health behaviors among adults in the United States, many of which differ by age group. Results have implications for continued shelter in place practices, but also for any older adult that may be homebound for other reasons.","Emerson, Kerstin Gerst",Rev. panam. salud pública,287,33

Design/Approach: The research was conducted using qualitative methods. As part of the research procedure, process analysis was carried out using the method of mapping processes in the mining industry supply chain (on the example of copper mining). To analyse and evaluate the examined processes were presented in the form of graphical maps developed using the ADONIS software. A case study was used to show the specificity of the studies case (copper mining supply chain) and accompanying phenomena. Findings: The results of the study indicate that the coordination and integration of logistics processes has a significant impact on the mining supply chain. It is necessary to point out that the mining processes are separate from production processes. The individual tier of copper mining supply chain has their specific determinants that can be identified in the following groups: natural and geological, political, economic, legislative, social, environmental, and technological. The COVID-19 pandemic increased the intensity of the search for new technologies, human security, remote communication processes and process tracking tools;it also increased the need for cooperation and searching for cooperative solutions regarding sustainable development and the circular economy. Practical Implications: The results can be used to improve the operation of the supply chain. The conducted analyses have significant practical implications for the design of efficiency, security, and resilience of supply chains. Originality/Value: The comprehensive analysis of the supply chain creates opportunities for comprehensive improvement of both the entire system and its individual components.","Wincewicz-Bosy, Marta Dymyt Małgorzata Wąsowska Katarzyna",European Research Studies,287,16

DESIGN: Retrospective observational cohort study of 115 patients at one acute district general hospital with a catchment population of approximately 500,000 people, during weeks 5 and 6 of the UK lockdown. RESULTS: More than 2 in 3 of the overall cohort had had contacts with the health and social care system prior to diagnosis. This figure rose to 85% in those 70 years and over. In the older cohort, the most common reasons for presentation were shortness of breath or falls, and 1 in 3 had neither cough nor fever. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 can present differently in the elderly, overlapping with many common presentations, so focusing testing on those with a cough or fever will miss at least 1 in 3 cases in those over the age of 70. A high degree of vigilance, suspicion and repeated testing is required if streaming into high and low risk areas is to succeed, allowing safe restarting of services such as elective surgery and cancer care.","Kerr, Andrew D; Stacpoole, Sybil Rl",Clin Med (Lond),287,24

This study aimed to assess COVID-19-related essential clinical resource demands in China, based on different scenarios involving COVID-19 outbreaks and interventions. We used a susceptible-exposed-infectious-hospitalized/isolated-removed (SEIHR) transmission dynamics model to estimate the number of COVID-19 infections and hospitalizations with corresponding essential healthcare resources needed. We found that, under strict non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) or mass vaccination of the population, China would be able to contain community transmission and local outbreaks rapidly. However, under scenarios involving a low intensity of implemented NPIs and a small proportion of the population vaccinated, the use of a peacetime-wartime transition model would be needed for medical source stockpiles and preparations to ensure a normal functioning healthcare system. The implementation of COVID-19 vaccines and NPIs in different periods can influence the transmission of COVID-19 and subsequently affect the demand for clinical diagnosis and treatment. An increased proportion of asymptomatic infections in simulations will not reduce the demand for medical resources; however, attention must be paid to the increasing difficulty in containing COVID-19 transmission due to asymptomatic cases. This study provides evidence for emergency preparations and the adjustment of prevention and control strategies during the COVID-19 pandemic. It also provides guidance for essential healthcare investment and resource allocation.","Zhang, Ting; Wang, Qing; Leng, Zhiwei; Yang, Yuan; Yang, Jin; Chen, Fangyuan; Jia, Mengmeng; Zhang, Xingxing; Qi, Weiran; Xu, Yunshao; Chen, Siya; Dai, Peixi; Ma, Libing; Feng, Luzhao; Yang, Weizhong",,287,24

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess real-time public awareness and behavioral responses to the COVID-19 epidemic across 12 selected countries. METHODS: Internet surveillance was used to collect real-time data from the general public to assess public awareness and rumors (China: Baidu; worldwide: Google Trends) and behavior responses (China: Ali Index; worldwide: Google Shopping). These indices measured the daily number of searches or purchases and were compared with the numbers of daily COVID-19 cases. The trend comparisons across selected countries were observed from December 1, 2019 (prepandemic baseline) to April 11, 2020 (at least one month after the governments of selected countries took actions for the pandemic). RESULTS: We identified missed windows of opportunity for early epidemic control in 12 countries, when public awareness was very low despite the emerging epidemic. China's epidemic and the declaration of a public health emergency of international concern did not prompt a worldwide public reaction to adopt health-protective measures; instead, most countries and regions only responded to the epidemic after their own case counts increased. Rumors and misinformation led to a surge of sales in herbal remedies in China and antimalarial drugs worldwide, and timely clarification of rumors mitigated the rush to purchase unproven remedies. CONCLUSIONS: Our comparative study highlights the urgent need for international coordination to promote mutual learning about epidemic characteristics and effective control measures as well as to trigger early and timely responses in individual countries. Early release of official guidelines and timely clarification of rumors led by governments are necessary to guide the public to take rational action.","Hou, Zhiyuan; Du, Fanxing; Zhou, Xinyu; Jiang, Hao; Martin, Sam; Larson, Heidi; Lin, Leesa",J Med Internet Res,287,20

Internationalisation draws on imagined virtuous flows of knowledge production and exchange, and is presented as an assemblage of detraditionalisation, expansiveness and epistemic and cultural opportunity for individuals, organisations and nation states. Policies target bodies, minds and affect, yet are presented as an unquestionable good in an imagined genderneutral, borderless, meritocratic and benign global knowledge economy. This paper explores the affective economy of internationalisation drawing upon interview data gathered in fifteen private, five national and eight public universities in Japan with thirty-four migrant academics and thirteen international doctoral researchers. We aim to contribute to internationalisation theory by exploring the sticky micropolitics of internationalisation in relation to affective assemblages, and how the gendered, racialised, linguistic and epistemic inequalities constituting academic mobility are frequently disqualified from discourse. Our discussion includes consideration of the Japanese policy context, the concept of affective assemblages, navigating gender regimes, precarity and linguistic imperialism. We conclude that the immaterial or affective labour that is required to unstick, install and maintain an internationalised academic identity and navigate the translations and antagonisms from everyday encounters with difference is substantially under-estimated.","Morley, Louise; Roberts, Paul; Ota, Hiroshi",High Educ (Dordr),287,15

As most of the countries relying on different preventive actions to control the outcomes of COVID-19, it is necessary to boost the knowledge about the effectiveness of such actions so that the policymakers take their country-based appropriate actions. This study generates evidence of taking the most impactful actions to combat COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: In order to generate community-based scientific evidence, this study analyzed the outcome of COVID-19 in response to different control measures, healthcare facilities, life expectancy, and prevalent diseases. METHODS: It used more than a hundred countries' data collected from different databases. We performed a comparative graphical analysis with non-linear correlation estimation using R. RESULTS: The reduction of COVID-19 cases is strongly correlated with the earliness of preventive initiation. The apathy of taking nationwide immediate precaution measures has been identified as one of the critical reasons to make the circumstances worse. There is significant non-linear relationship between COVID-19 case fatality and number of physicians (NCC = 0.22; p-value &#8804; 0.001), nurses and midwives (NCC = 0.17; p-value &#8804; 0.001), hospital beds (NCC = 0.20; p-value &#8804; 0.001), life expectancy of both sexes (NCC = 0.22; p-value &#8804; 0.001), life expectancy of female (NCC = 0.27; p-value &#8804; 0.001), and life expectancy of male (NCC = 0.19; p-value &#8804; 0.001).

The virus requires its proteins to replicate and reproduce in the host cell. The NS3 protease converts the polyprotein to functional proteins with the help of the NS2B cofactor. Thus, NS3 protease is a promising target to develop antiviral inhibitors against the dengue virus. A systematic screening including ADMET properties, molecular docking, molecular dynamics (MD) simulation, binding free energy calculation, and QSAR studies is carried out to predict potent inhibitors against the NS3 protease. From the screening of 40 antiviral phytochemicals, ADMET properties analysis was used to screen out ligands that violate ADME rules and have probable toxicity. Cyanidin 3-Glucoside, Dithymoquinone, and Glabridin were predicted to be potent inhibitors against the NS3 protease according to their binding affinity. These ligands showed several noncovalent interactions, including hydrogen bond, hydrophobic interaction, electrostatic interaction, pi-sulfur interactions. The ligand-protein complexes were further scrutinized using 250 ns molecular dynamics simulation. The MM-PBSA binding free energy calculation was conducted to investigate their binding stability in dynamic conditions. The calculated pIC50(mM) value was predicted using the QSAR model with 89.91% goodness of fit.

The learning characteristics we see in health care organizations responding to the COVID-19 pandemic—the need to manage fleeting, ever-changing knowledge that resists formalization and documentation but is also difficult to observe or share informally due to outside constraints—are likely representative of the kind of challenges all organizations will increasingly face in the future, and we invite organizational scholars to explore them further in order to build a more robust and nuanced understanding of learning in modern organizations. * Corresponding author.","Myers, Christopher G.; Rosen, Michael A.; Yuan, Christina T.",Industrial and Organizational Psychology,287,4

This infection, caused by the novel coronavirus Sars Cov2, primarily affects respiratory system, but there is increasing evidence of neurologic involvement and cerebrovascular accidents. CASE REPORT: We present a case of stroke in a 62-year-old COVID-19-positive patient, with multiple vascular risk factors. The patient arrived 1 h after onset of symptoms, was treated with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA) with improvement of neurologic deficits, and later developed right foot arterial ischemia (recanalized by balloon catheter angioplasty) and left arm superficial venous thrombosis. A control computed tomography (CT) scan 7 days after onset showed hemorrhagic transformation of ischemic lesion without mass effect. However, respiratory and neurologic conditions improved so that the patient was discharged to rehabilitation. DISCUSSION: Until now, few cases of stroke in COVID-19 have been described, mainly in severe forms. This patient had ischemic injuries in different sites as well as venous thrombosis; hence, we speculate that Sars Cov2 could have a direct role in promoting vascular accidents since its receptor ACE2 is a surface protein also expressed by endothelial cells. This case suggests that COVID-19 can favor strokes and in general vascular complications, even in milder cases, and the presence of preexisting risk factors could play a determinant role.","Saggese, Carlo Emanuele; Del Bianco, Chiara; Di Ruzza, Maria Rita; Magarelli, Maria; Gandini, Roberto; Plocco, Maurizio",Cerebrovasc Dis,287,33

The scientific goal was to characterize the residual concentrations in eggs from treated hens and suggest the withdrawal periods that should be respected to avoid risk for consumers. Thirty-four laying hens were allocated into two groups: Group A was treated with fipronil in feed, two single doses of 1 mg kg-1 day-1 ; Group B was administered a single dose of 1 mg kg-1 by the topical route. Fipronil egg residues were quantified by HPLC-MS/MS. Fipronil and its sulphone metabolite (fipronil-SO2 ) were measured in egg after both treatments. The highest egg residual profile was always for fipronil-SO2 . Mean maximum egg concentrations (Cmax ) of 228.5 ± 79.8 ng/g (fipronil) and 1,849 ± 867 ng/g (fipronil-SO2 ) were found after fipronil administration in feed. The lowest residual levels were quantified after the topical treatment with Cmax of 27.1 ± 4.9 and 163 ± 26 ng/g for fipronil and fipronil-SO2 .

However, no rationale for how to prioritize service shut down and patient care exists. A consensus-based ad-hoc expert panel of allergy/immunology specialists from the United States and Canada developed a service and patient prioritization schematic to temporarily triage allergy/immunology services. Recommendations and feedback were developed iteratively, using an adapted modified Delphi methodology to achieve consensus. During the ongoing pandemic while social distancing is being encouraged, most allergy/immunology care could be postponed/delayed or handled through virtual care. With the exception of many patients with primary immunodeficiency, patients on venom immunotherapy, and patients with asthma of a certain severity, there is limited need for face-to-face visits under such conditions. These suggestions are intended to help provide a logical approach to quickly adjust service to mitigate risk to both medical staff and patients. Importantly, individual community circumstances may be unique and require contextual consideration. The decision to enact any of these measures rests with the judgment of each clinician and individual health care system. Pandemics are unanticipated, and enforced social distancing/quarantining is highly unusual. This expert panel consensus document offers a prioritization rational to help guide decision making when such situations arise and an allergist/immunologist is forced to reduce services or makes the decision on his or her own to do so.","Shaker, Marcus S; Oppenheimer, John; Grayson, Mitchell; Stukus, David; Hartog, Nicholas; Hsieh, Elena W Y; Rider, Nicholas; Dutmer, Cullen M; Vander Leek, Timothy K; Kim, Harold; Chan, Edmond S; Mack, Doug; Ellis, Anne K; Lang, David; Lieberman, Jay; Fleischer, David; Golden, David B K; Wallace, Dana; Portnoy, Jay; Mosnaim, Giselle; Greenhawt, Matthew",J Allergy Clin Immunol Pract,287,16

The problem is that it is not exactly known how much. Since the outbreak of COVID-19, several aerosol safety recommendations have been issued-based on little empirical evidence, as almost no data are available on the exact aerosol concentrations generated during dental treatment. Similarly, little is known about the differences in the efficacy of different commercially available aerosol control systems to reduce in-treatment aerosol load. In this in vitro study, we used spectrometry to explore these questions. The time-dependent effect of conventional airing on aerosol concentrations was also studied. Everyday patient treatment situations were modeled. The test setups were defined by the applied instrument and its spray direction (high-speed turbine with direct/indirect airspray or ultrasonic scaler with indirect airspray) and the applied aerosol control system (the conventional high-volume evacuator or a lately introduced aerosol exhaustor). Two parameters were analyzed: total number concentration in the entire measurement range of the spectrometer and total number concentration within the 60 to 384 nm range. The results suggest that instrument type and spray direction significantly influence the resulting aerosol concentrations. Aerosol generation by the ultrasonic scaler is easily controlled. As for the high-speed turbine, the efficiency of control might depend on how exactly the instrument is used during a treatment. The results suggest that scenarios where the airspray is frequently directed toward the air of the operatory are the most difficult to control. The tested control systems did not differ in their efficiency, but the study could not provide conclusive results in this respect. With conventional airing through windows with a standard fan, a safety airing period of at least 15 minutes between treatments is recommended.","Kun-Szabó, Fruzsina; Gheorghita, Dorottya; Ajtai, Tibor; Hodovány, Szabolcs; Bozóki, Zoltán; Braunitzer, Gábor; Antal, Márk Ádám",PLoS One,287,24

However, the causative agent is often not identified, resulting in antibiotic overtreatment, which is a key driver of antimicrobial resistance and adverse events. We aim to test the hypothesis that comprehensive molecular testing, compared with routine microbiological testing, would be effective in reducing antibiotic use in patients with CAP. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will perform a randomised, controlled, open-label clinical trial with two parallel groups (1:1) at two tertiary hospitals between 2020 and 2022. Non-severely immunosuppressed adults hospitalised for CAP will be considered eligible. Patients will be randomly assigned to receive either the experimental diagnosis (comprehensive molecular testing plus routine microbiological testing) or standard diagnosis (only microbiological routine testing). The primary endpoint will be antibiotic consumption measured as days of antibiotic therapy per 1000 patient-days. Secondary endpoints will be de-escalation to narrower antibiotic treatment, time to switch from intravenous to oral antibiotics, days to reaching an aetiological diagnosis, antibiotic-related side effects, length of stay, days to clinical stability, intensive care unit admission, days of mechanical ventilation, hospital readmission up to 30 days after randomisation and death from any cause by 48 hours and 30 days after randomisation. We will need to include 440 subjects to be able to reject the null hypothesis that both groups have equal days of antibiotic therapy per 1000 patient-days with a probability >0.8.

The study aims to analyze the performance of LUS in the early identification of COVID-19 patients in ED during a SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. We prospectively collected consecutive adult patients admitted to a first-level ED in Powered by Editorial Manager® and ProduXion Manager® from Aries Systems Corporation Florence with history or symptoms suggestive for COVID-19 that underwent LUS during the ED management. LUS findings were categorized in 6 discrete main etiological patterns. ""A"", ""Cardiogenic B"" and ""Typical C"" patterns were referred as non-COVID-19-suggestive, while ""Atypical"" B or C patterns, ""Multiple Consolidations"" pattern and ""ARDS"" pattern were referred as COVID-19-suggestive. The primary outcome was the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. From 12 March to 12 May 2020, 360 patients were enrolled. COVID-19 suggestive LUS findings were significantly associated with final COVID-19 diagnosis (86% in COVID-19 vs 29% in non-COVID-19, p < 0.001). The presence in ED of at least one in positive swab OR a COVID-19-suggestive LUS showed a sensitivity of 97% and a negative predictive value (NPV) of 98%. In patients with known SARS-CoV-2 exposition in the last 14 days, a COVID-19-suggestive pattern at LUS had a positive predictive value (PPV) of 97% for COVID-19 diagnosis.

Molnupiravir is a broad-spectrum antiviral that is an orally bioavailable prodrug of the nucleoside analogue ß-D-N4-hydroxycytidine (NHC). Molnupiravir or NHC can increase G to A and C to U transition mutations in replicating coronaviruses. These increases in mutation frequencies can be linked to increases in antiviral effects; however, biochemical data of molnupiravir-induced mutagenesis have not been reported. Here we studied the effects of the active compound NHC 5'-triphosphate (NHC-TP) against the purified SARS-CoV-2 RdRp complex. The efficiency of incorporation of natural nucleotides over the efficiency of incorporation of NHC-TP into model RNA substrates followed the order GTP (12,841) > ATP (424) > UTP (171) > CTP (30), indicating that NHC-TP competes predominantly with CTP for incorporation. No significant inhibition of RNA synthesis was noted as a result of the incorporated monophosphate (NHC-MP) in the RNA primer strand. When embedded in the template strand, NHC-MP supported formation of both NHC:G and NHC:A base pairs with similar efficiencies. The extension of the NHC:G product was modestly inhibited, but higher nucleotide concentrations could overcome this blockage. In contrast, the NHC:A base pair led to the observed G to A (G:NHC:A) or C to U (C:G:NHC:A:U) mutations. Together, these biochemical data support a mechanism of action of molnupiravir that is primarily based on RNA mutagenesis mediated via the template strand.","Gordon, Calvin J; Tchesnokov, Egor P; Schinazi, Raymond F; Götte, Matthias",J Biol Chem,287,20

The sparse information available, mainly for seamounts outside Chilean jurisdiction and shallow-water fauna of the Desventuradas Islands, suggests that the area is a hotspot of endemism. This apparent uniqueness of the fauna motivated the creation of the large Nazca-Desventuradas Marine Park (NDMP, ~ 300,000 km2) around the small islands San Felix and San Ambrosio in 2015. We report for the first time a detailed description of benthic microhabitats (i.e., centimeter to meter scale), macrohabitats (i.e., meter to kilometer-scale) and associated megafauna within the NDMP. Descriptions were based on analysis of fauna collected by trawling and ROV video observations from ~ 50 to 370 m depth. Rocky, coarse sand and silty sediment bottom habitats were observed at island slopes. In contrast, rocky and coarse sandy bottom habitats with a predominance of rhodoliths, thanatocoenosis, and other biogenic components were observed at seamounts. Mobile fauna and predators dominated the oceanic islands and nearby seamounts, whereas seamounts farther from the islands were dominated by sessile and hemisessile fauna that were mainly suspension and deposit feeders. Based on the register of 118 taxonomic units, our results provide an expanded and updated baseline for the benthic biodiversity of NDMP habitats, which seemed pristine, without evidence of trawling or anthropogenic debris.","Tapia-Guerra, Jan M; Mecho, Ariadna; Easton, Erin E; Gallardo, María de Los Ángeles; Gorny, Matthias; Sellanes, Javier",Sci Rep,287,7

METHODS AND RESULTS: In a single‐centre cross‐sectional observational study, we included 355 patients with AMI containing ST‐elevation or non‐ST‐elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI or NSTEMI), admitted for emergency cardiac catheterization between January and April 2020 and the equivalent time in 2019. During the early phase of the Covid‐19 pandemic (e‐COV) in Berlin (March and April 2020), admissions for AMI halved compared with those in the pre‐Covid‐19 time (January and February 2020; pre‐COV) and with those in the corresponding months in 2019. However, mortality for AMI increased substantially from 5.2% pre‐COV to 17.7% (P < 0.05) during e‐COV. Severity of presentation for AMI was more pronounced during e‐COV [increased levels of cardiac enzymes, reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), an increase in the need of inotropic support by 25% (P < 0.01)], while patients' demographic and angiographic characteristics did not differ between pre‐COV and e‐COV. Time from symptom onset to first medical contact was prolonged in all AMI during e‐COV (presentation > 72 h +21% in STEMI, p = 0.04 and presentation > 72 h in NSTEMI +22%, p = 0.02). Door to balloon time was similar in STEMI patients, while time from first medical contact to revascularization was significantly delayed in NSTEMI patients (p = 0.02). Major cardiac complications after AMI occurred significantly more often, and cardiac recovery was worse in e‐COV than in pre‐COV, demonstrated by a significantly lower LVEF (39 ± 16 vs. 46 ± 16, p < 0.05) at hospital discharge and substantially higher NTproBNP levels. CONCLUSIONS: The Covid‐19 outbreak affects hospital admissions for acute coronary syndromes. During the first phase of the pandemia, significantly less patients with AMI were admitted, but those admitted presented with a more severe phenotype and had a higher mortality, more complications, and a worse short‐term outcome. Therefore, our data indicate that Covid‐19 had relevant impact on non‐infectious disease states, such as acute coronary syndromes.","Primessnig, Uwe; Pieske, Burkert M.; Sherif, Mohammad",ESC Heart Fail,287,16

In inverse probability of treatment weighted analyses, cumulative adjusted incidence of mortality at 30 days was 14.3% (95% CI 13.1–15.5) among those receiving prophylactic anticoagulation and 18.7% (95% CI 15.1–22.9) among those who did not. Compared to patients who did not receive prophylactic anticoagulation, those who did had a 27% decreased risk for 30-day mortality (HR 0.73, 95% CI 0.66–0.81). Similar associations were found for inpatient mortality and initiating therapeutic anticoagulation. Quantitative bias analysis demonstrated that results were robust to unmeasured confounding (e-value lower 95% CI 1.77). Results persisted in a number of sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE. Early initiation of prophylactic anticoagulation among patients hospitalized with COVID-19 was associated with a decreased risk of mortality. These findings provide strong real-world evidence to support guidelines recommending the use of prophylactic anticoagulation as initial therapy for COVID-19 patients upon hospital admission.","Rentsch, Christopher T; Beckman, Joshua A; Tomlinson, Laurie; Gellad, Walid F; Alcorn, Charles; Kidwai-Khan, Farah; Skanderson, Melissa; Brittain, Evan; King, Joseph T; Ho, Yuk-Lam; Eden, Svetlana; Kundu, Suman; Lann, Michael F; Greevy, Robert A; Ho, P.

Methods: Two hundred seventy COVID-19 pneumonia patients were retrospectively analyzed, including 146 males and 124 females, with median age of 51 (9,89). The clinical features, laboratory examination indexes and HRCT evolution findings of 270 COVID-19 pneumonia patients were analyzed. Results: 264 cases (95.74%) were positive at the first time nucleic acid test, 6 cases (2.22%) were negative, after multiple inspections, 270 cases (100%) were positive. According to the number of lung segments involved in the lesion, the lesions range from <30% of the lung area (Common type), 30–50% (Severe type), and> 50% (Critical type). At the first CT exam, 136 cases (50.37%) of the common type, 89 cases (32.96%) of the severe type and 45 cases (16.67%) of the critical type. At the second CT exam, 84 cases (31.11%) of the common type, 103 cases (38.15%) of the severe type and 83 cases (30.74%) of the critical type. In the third CT exam, there were 151 cases (55.93%) of the common type, 86 cases (31.85%) of the severe type and 33 cases (12.22%) of the critical type. The differences in image typing were statistically significant (P < 0.05). During this study, a total of 173 patients (64.08%) were recovered after treatment. Conclusion: In some epidemiological backgrounds, CT imaging manifestations and evolutionary characteristics are of great significance for early warning of lung injury, assessment of disease severity, and assistance in clinical typing and post-treatment follow-up.","Lu, Xuefang; Gong, Wei; Peng, Zhoufeng; Zeng, Feifei; Liu, Fang",Front Med (Lausanne),287,16

In accordance with the biopsychosocial model, the recommended treatment approach for chronic pain is multidisciplinary. Despite this, multidisciplinary components within existing online interventions have not been examined. The objective of the present review was to summarise and evaluate the content of existing online interventions for paediatric chronic pain by mapping intervention content to evidence-based guidelines for chronic pain management. METHODS Interventions were identified using an updated systematic review. Nine chronic pain management strategies that reflect evidence-based guidance for multidisciplinary chronic pain management were defined by the authors, examples of which include 'pain education', 'activity pacing' and 'physiotherapy'. Identified interventions were then coded against the target strategies. These codes were compiled descriptively to provide an overview of how well each chronic pain management strategy was represented across the dataset, and which interventions represented the most strategies. RESULTS Thirty-five articles, relating to 13 unique interventions for paediatric chronic pain management were identified; few encompassed a complete multidisciplinary approach. Many CBT-based interventions included multidisciplinary elements. Across interventions, physiotherapy and non-pharmacological physical therapies were the least represented chronic pain management strategies. CONCLUSIONS The content analysis revealed a lack of online interventions encompassing complete multidisciplinary pain management. It is important that new interventions for paediatric chronic pain management are evidence-based and reflect current best practice guidelines. Established intervention development approaches should be utilised and include a process evaluation to help identify which intervention components are effective in which contexts.","Hurley-Wallace, A L; Nowotny, E; Schoth, D E; Liossi, C",European journal of pain,287,23

One of the early agents targeted for repurposing to treat and prevent COVID-19 was hydroxychloroquine (HCQ). In this systematic review and meta-analysis, HCQ is evaluated for its potential role in decreasing mortality in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. We searched PubMed, Web of Science, and medRxiv databases using combinations of the terms “COVID-19”, “SARS-CoV-2”, “coronavirus”, “hydroxychloroquine”, and “mortality”. Articles were selected for further review based on the content of their abstracts. Studies were excluded if they were of poor methodological quality, were not based in the inpatient setting, or did not have available data to assess the primary outcome of death between patients treated with HCQ versus standard of care. Once the final dataset was compiled, a meta-analysis using the random-effects model was performed. Our search identified 14 studies involving 24,780 patients of whom 12,707 patients were on HCQ alone or in combination with other adjuvant therapies. HCQ alone or in combination with other drugs did not significantly decrease mortality in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 (odds ratio [OR], 0.95; 95% CI, 0.72–1.26; p = 0.732; I(2) = 91.05). Similar findings were observed in all subgroup analyses. HCQ did not significantly impact mortality in hospitalized patients with COVID-19.

This study assessed the immunogenicity and safety profile of HBV vaccination in pediatric hemato-oncological children. A nonrandomized interventional study was conducted from January 2017 to February 2020 in Shanghai, China. Seventy-three pediatric hemato-oncological children with hepatitis B surface antibody (anti-HBs) titers <10 mIU/ml were recruited. The participants received three doses of recombinant HBV vaccine according to the 0-, 1-, and 6- month immunization schedule. Adverse events following immunization and anti-HBs titers (at baseline, 1 month, and 6 months after inoculation) were recorded. Forty-three males and thirty females with median ages of 9.12 and 9.60 years, respectively, were included. The mean anti-HBs titer was 4.88 ± 2.61 mIU/ml, 893.12 ± 274.12 mIU/ml, and 711.45 ± 337.88 mIU/ml at baseline, one month, and six months after inoculation, respectively (P< .001). A total of fourteen adverse events following immunization were reported, and among them, 5 (6.85%), 5 (6.85%), and 4 (5.48%) events were reported after the first, second, and third inoculation, respectively (P= .927). In conclusions, the HBV vaccine is immunogenic and safe in children with hematological malignancies. It is worth noting that the anti-HBs titer was decreased at the 6-month follow-up, and periodic monitoring of the anti-HBs titer accompanied by timely booster vaccination should be carefully considered.Abbreviations: AEFI: Adverse events following immunization; HBV: Hepatitis B virus; Anti-HBs: Antibody against hepatitis B surface antigen; HBsAg: Hepatitis B surface antigen; APC: Antigen-presenting cell; HSCT: Hemopoietic stem cell transplantation; COVID-19: Corona Virus Disease 2019.","Deng, Pengfei; Yang, Tian; Zhang, Hua; Zhou, Fen; Xue, Caoyi; Fei, Yi; Gao, Yijin",Human vaccines & immunotherapeutics,287,20

The list of potential markers includes proteins involved in various pathogenetic processes, such as oxidative stress and protein aggregation. This list will undoubtedly grow in the near future by application of CSF proteomics and subsequent validation of identified proteins. Probably a single biomarker will not suffice to reach high sensitivity and specificity, because PD is pathogenetically heterogeneous and shares etiological factors with other neurodegenerative diseases. Furthermore, identified candidate biomarkers will have to be thoroughly validated before they can be implemented as diagnostic aids.","van Dijk, Karin D.; Teunissen, Charlotte E.; Drukarch, Benjamin; Jimenez, Connie R.; Groenewegen, Henk J.; Berendse, Henk W.; van de Berg, Wilma D.J.",Neurobiol Dis,287,1

While diagnostic and therapeutic efforts have been focused on respiratory complications of the disease, several ocular implications have also emerged. SARS-CoV-2 RNA has been found in tears of the infected patients, and reports suggest that the ocular surface could serve as a portal of entry and a reservoir for viral transmission. Clinically, COVID-19 has been associated with mild conjunctivitis, which can be the first and only symptom of the disease. Subtle retinal changes like hyperreflective lesions in the inner layers on optical coherence tomography (OCT), cotton-wool spots, and microhemorrhages have also been reported. In addition, COVID-19 has been associated with an increased incidence of systemic diseases like diabetes mellitus and Kawasaki disease, which are particularly relevant for ophthalmologists due to their potentially severe ocular manifestations. Several treatment strategies are currently under investigation for COVID-19, but none of them have been proved to be safe and effective to date. Intensive care unit patients, due to risk factors like invasive mechanical ventilation, prone position, and multiresistant bacterial exposure, may develop ocular complications like ocular surface disorders, secondary infections, and less frequently acute ischemic optic neuropathy and intraocular pressure elevation. Among the array of drugs that have shown positive results, the use of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine has raised a concern due to their well-known retinal toxic effects. However, the risk of retinal toxicity with short-term high-dose use of antimalarials is still unknown. Ocular side effects have also been reported with other investigational drugs like lopinavir-ritonavir, interferons, and interleukin-1 and interleukin-6 inhibitors.

With prompt and drastic measures, Vietnam is one of the few countries that has largely succeeded in controlling the outbreak. This result is derived from a harmonious combination of many factors, with the policy system playing a key role. This study assessed the policy responses to the COVID-19 pandemic in Vietnam from the early days of the outbreak in January 2020 to 24 July 2020 (with a total of 413 cases confirmed and 99 days of no new cases infected from the local community) by synthesizing and evaluating 959 relevant policy documents in different classifications. The findings show that the Vietnamese policy system responded promptly, proactively, and effectively at multiple authority levels (33 different agencies from the national to provincial governments), using a range of policy tools and measures. Parallel to the daily occurrence of 2.24 new cases, 5.13 new policy documents were issued on average per day over the study period. The pandemic policy response over the first six months in Vietnam were divided into four periods, I (23 January–5 March), II (6–19 March), III (20 March–21 April), and IV (22 April–24 July). This paper synthesizes eight solution groups for these four anti-pandemic phases, including outbreak announcements and steering documents, medical measures, blockade of the schools, emergency responses, border and entry control measures, social isolation and nationwide social isolation measures, financial supports, and other measures. By emphasizing diversification of the policy responses, from the agencies to the tools and measures, the case study reviews and shares lessons from the successful COVID-19 prevention and control in Vietnam that could be useful for other nations.","Le, Tuyet-Anh T.; Vodden, Kelly; Wu, Jianghua; Atiwesh, Ghada",Int J Environ Res Public Health,287,16

The objectives of this work were to assess the incidence of initially normal chest CT in a cohort of consecutive confirmed COVID-19 patients with respiratory symptoms and to compare their clinical characteristics and their outcome to matched patients with typical COVID-19 lesions at initial CT. METHODS: From March 6(th) to April 22(nd), all consecutive adult patients referred to the COVID-19 clinic of our Emergency Department were retrospectively analyzed. Each patient with a positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR and a normal initial chest CT after second reading was 1:1 matched based on sex, age and date of CT acquisition to a patient with positive RT-PCR and initial chest CT with typical COVID-19 lesions. Clinical data, laboratory results and outcomes (major being mechanical ventilation and/or death) were compared between both groups, using Wilcoxon signed-rank test, McNemar’s chi-squared test and/or exact McNemar’s test where appropriate. RESULTS: Fifty-seven chest CT out of 1091 (5.2%, 95% CI 4.0–6.7) in symptomatic patients with positive RT-PCR were normal, with a median onset of symptoms of 4.5 days (IQR [1.25–10.25]). After a median follow-up of 43 days, death and/or mechanical ventilation occurred in 3 patients (5.3%) in the study group, versus 11 (19.3%) in the control group (p = 0.011). CONCLUSIONS: Normal initial chest CT occurred in 5.2% of symptomatic confirmed COVID-19 cases in our cohort. While better than those with abnormal chest CT, outcome was not entirely benign with 5.3% death and/or mechanical ventilation. KEY POINTS: • In a cohort of 1091 symptomatic COVID-19 patients, initial chest CT was normal in 5.2% of cases. • Normal chest CT in confirmed COVID-19 is frequent even when onset of symptoms is greater than 3 days. • The outcome of COVID-19 patients with initial normal chest CT, while better than those with abnormal CT, was not entirely benign with 5.3% death and/or mechanical ventilation.","Leonard-Lorant, Ian; Severac, François; Bilbault, Pascal; Muller, Joris; Leyendecker, Pierre; Roy, Catherine; Ohana, Mickaël",Eur Radiol,287,1

It is assumed that there is no long-term immunity in asymptomatic superspreaders who have under- gone the infection, and the emergence of long-term immunity in those who have undergone severe illness. It is shown that, under these assumptions, the relaxation of quarantine measures leads to the resumption of virus circulation among asymptomatic superspreaders. Depending on the charac- teristics of the quarantine, its removal may or may not lead to a renewed wave of daily morbidity. A criterion for the occurrence and repeated wave of morbidity is proposed based on the analysis of the final phase of the first wave. Based on this criterion, the repeated wave of the epidemic is predicted in New Zealand. A natural explanation is given for the decrease in lethality among the infected against the background of an absolute increase in their number.","Dimaschko, J.",,287,16

However, most guidelines are based on resources found in high-income settings, with fewer examples that can be implemented in resource-constrained settings. This study describes the process of adapting and developing role-specific guidelines for comprehensive COVID-19 infection prevention and control in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs). METHODS: We used a collaborative autoethnographic approach to explore the process of developing COVID-19 guidelines. In this approach, multiple researchers contributed their reflections, conducted joint analysis through dialogue, reflection and with consideration of experiential knowledge and multidisciplinary perspectives to identify and synthesise enablers, challenges and key lessons learnt. RESULTS: We describe the guideline development process in the Philippines and the adaptation process in Sri Lanka. We offer key enablers identified through this work, including flexible leadership that aimed to empower the team to bring their expertise to the process; shared responsibility through equitable ownership; an interdisciplinary team; and collaboration with local experts. We then elaborate on challenges including interpreting other guidelines to the country context; tensions between the ideal compared with the feasible and user-friendly; adapting and updating with evolving information; and coping with pandemic-related challenges. Based on key lessons learnt, we synthesise a novel set of principles for developing guidelines during a public health emergency. The SPRINT principles are grounded in situational awareness, prioritisation and balance, which are responsive to change, created by an interdisciplinary team navigating shared responsibility and transparency. CONCLUSIONS: Guideline development during a pandemic requires a robust and time sensitive paradigm. We summarise the learning in the ‘SPRINT principles’ for adapting guidelines in an epidemic context in LMICs. We emphasise that these principles must be grounded in a collaborative or codesign process and add value to existing national responses.","Haldane, Victoria; Ratnapalan, Savithiri; Perera, Niranjala; Zhang, Zhitong; Ge, Shiliang; Choi, Mia; Lau, Lincoln L; Samaraweera, Sudath; Dodd, Warren; Walley, John; Wei, Xiaolin",BMJ Glob Health,287,26

Since then, this epidemic has spread worldwide; in Europe, Italy has been involved. Effective preventive and therapeutic strategies are absolutely required to block this serious public health concern. Unfortunately, few studies about SARS-CoV-2 concerning its immunopathogenesis and treatment are available. On the basis of the assumption that the SARS-CoV-2 is genetically related to SARS-CoV (about 82 % of genome homology) and that its characteristics, like the modality of transmission or the type of the immune response it may stimulate, are still poorly known, a literature search was performed to identify the reports assessing these elements in patients with SARS-CoV-induced infection. Therefore, we have analysed: (1) the structure of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV; (2) the clinical signs and symptoms and pathogenic mechanisms observed during the development of acute respiratory syndrome and the cytokine release syndrome; (3) the modification of the cell microRNome and of the immune response in patients with SARS infection; and (4) the possible role of some fat-soluble compounds (such as vitamins A, D and E) in modulating directly or indirectly the replication ability of SARS-CoV-2 and host immune response.","Fiorino, Sirio; Zippi, Maddalena; Gallo, Claudio; Sifo, Debora; Sabbatani, Sergio; Manfredi, Roberto; Rasciti, Edoardo; Rasciti, Leonardo; Giampieri, Enrico; Corazza, Ivan; Leandri, Paolo; de Biase, Dario",The British journal of nutrition,287,16

OBJECTIVES: This study estimates recovery delay intervals and identifies associated factors in a sample of Saudi Arabian patients admitted for suspected MERS‐CoV and diagnosed by rRT‐PCR assay. METHODS: A multicenter retrospective study was conducted on 829 patients admitted between September 2012 and June 2016 and diagnosed by rRT‐PCR procedures to have MERS‐CoV and non‐MERS‐CoV infection in which 396 achieved recovery. Detailed medical charts were reviewed for each patient who achieved recovery. Time intervals in days were calculated from presentation to the initial rRT‐PCR diagnosis (diagnosis delay) and from the initial rRT‐PCR diagnosis to recovery (recovery delay). RESULTS: The median recovery delay in our sample was 5 days. According to the multivariate negative binomial model, elderly (age ≥ 65), MERS‐CoV infection, ICU admission, and abnormal radiology findings were associated with longer recovery delay (adjusted relative risk (aRR): 1.741, 2.138, 2.048, and 1.473, respectively). Camel contact and the presence of respiratory symptoms at presentation were associated with a shorter recovery delay (expedited recovery) (aRR: 0.267 and 0.537, respectively). Diagnosis delay is a positive predictor for recovery delay (r = .421; P = .001). CONCLUSIONS: The study evidence supports that longer recovery delay was seen in patients of older age, MERS‐CoV infection, ICU admission, and abnormal radiology findings. Shorter recovery delay was found in patients who had camel contact and respiratory symptoms at presentation. These findings may help us understand clinical decision making on directing hospital resources toward prompt screening, monitoring, and implementing clinical recovery and treatment strategies.","Ahmed, Anwar E.; Al‐Jahdali, Hamdan; Alaqeel, Mody; Siddiq, Salma S.; Alsaab, Hanan A.; Sakr, Ezzeldin A.; Alyahya, Hamed A.; Alandonisi, Munzir M.; Subedar, Alaa T.; Ali, Yosra Z.; Al Otaibi, Hazza; Aloudah, Nouf M.; Baharoon, Salim; Al Johani, Sameera; Alghamdi, Mohammed G.",Influenza Other Respir Viruses,287,22

Loneliness describes the perceived quality of one’s own contacts and relationships with other individuals. Several prior studies reported associations of loneliness with different somatic and psychiatric disorders. AIM: To analyse the frequency of loneliness and its association with depression and anxiety symptoms in the first wave of the pandemic in Germany in May 2020. METHODS: The German National Cohort (NAKO) had recruited and examined 205,000 individuals aged 20 to 69 years in 18 study centres across Germany between 2014 and 2019. The follow-up examination was temporarily stopped due to the pandemic between March and July 2020. In this period a COVID-related questionnaire was developed and sent to all participants. We analysed the first 113,928 questionnaires that were sent back within four weeks in May 2020. Loneliness was assessed with the three-item UCLA Loneliness Scale and anxiety and depression symptoms were collected using the PHQ‑9 and GAD‑7 scales from the Patient Health Questionnaire. RESULTS: Among the NAKO participants, 31.7% reported to be lonely in May 2020. Women and young adults reported more loneliness than men and older adults. With increasing scores of loneliness, the severity of depression and anxiety symptoms also steadily increased. Individuals who were lonely during the pandemic had already reported higher PHQ‑9 and GAD‑7 scores during the baseline examination on average 2.5 years earlier, compared to those who did not feel lonely. CONCLUSIONS: Among participants of the German National Cohort, we observed an increase in loneliness during the first wave of the SARS-CoV‑2 pandemic in spring 2020 and a strong relationship of increasing loneliness with decreasing mental health.","Berger, Klaus; Riedel-Heller, Steffi; Pabst, Alexander; Rietschel, Marcella; Richter, Dirk",Bundesgesundheitsblatt Gesundheitsforschung Gesundheitsschutz,287,5

Prematurity is an independent risk factor for disease severity. Many infected infants require hospitalisation and those living in regional centres frequently require transfer to metropolitan hospitals capable of providing assisted ventilation. METHOD: We reviewed infants with bronchiolitis transported by the Victorian Newborn Emergency Transport Service between January 2003 and June 2007. We compared the clinical presentation and treatment required by infants born preterm with those of their term counterparts. RESULTS: Of the 192 infants transported, 92 were born preterm. Preterm infants were younger at time of transport (mean post‐menstrual age 41 weeks vs. 45 weeks) and were more likely to require invasive ventilation (60% vs. 32%, P < 0.001) and to receive a fluid bolus (47% vs. 34%, P = 0.04) when compared with infants who had been born at term. Apnoea, either as a presenting symptom or in combination with respiratory distress, was more common in the preterm group (70% vs. 36%, P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Higher illness severity should be anticipated in ex‐preterm infants who present with bronchiolitis. Preterm infants with bronchiolitis are more likely to require invasive ventilation and fluid resuscitation than term infants, suggesting the need for a lower threshold for referral and medical retrieval.","Fleming, Paul F; Richards, Susie; Waterman, Kelly; Davis, Peter G; Kamlin, C Omar F; Stewart, Michael; Sokol, Jenni",J Paediatr Child Health,287,21

Therefore, the invasion of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), which is usually prevalent in the bat population, into the human population is thought to have necessitated changes in the viral genome for efficient growth in the new environment. In the present study, to understand host-dependent changes in coronavirus genomes, we focused on the mono- and oligonucleotide compositions of SARS-CoV-2 genomes and investigated how these compositions changed time-dependently in the human cellular environment. We also compared the oligonucleotide compositions of SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses prevalent in humans or bats to investigate the causes of changes in the host environment. RESULTS: Time-series analyses of changes in the nucleotide compositions of SARS-CoV-2 genomes revealed a group of mono- and oligonucleotides whose compositions changed in a common direction for all clades, even though viruses belonging to different clades should evolve independently. Interestingly, the compositions of these oligonucleotides changed towards those of coronaviruses that have been prevalent in humans for a long period and away from those of bat coronaviruses. CONCLUSIONS: Clade-independent, time-dependent changes are thought to have biological significance and should relate to viral adaptation to a new host environment, providing important clues for understanding viral host adaptation mechanisms.

Keeping in mind (i) available evidence indicating need to better understand potential of wastewater mediated transmission and (ii) knowledge gaps in its occurrence, viability, persistence, and inactivation in wastewater, in this present work, we wanted to re-emphasize some strategies for management of SARS-CoV-2 contaminated wastewater to minimise any possible secondary transmission to human and environment. The immediate challenges to consider while considering wastewater management are uncertainty about this new biothreat, relying on prediction based treatments options, significant population being the latent asymptomatic carrier increased risk of passing out of the virus to sewage network, inadequacy of wastewater treatment facility particularly in populated developing countries and increased generation of wastewater due to increased cleanliness concern. In absence of regulated central treatment facility, installation of decentralized wastewater treatment units with single or multiple disinfection barriers in medical units, quarantine centre, isolation wards, testing facilities seems to be urgent for minimizing any potential risk of wastewater transmission. Employing some emerging disinfectants (peracetic acid, performic acid, sodium dichloro isocyanurate, chloramines, chlorine dioxide, benzalconium chloride) shows prospects in terms of virucidal properties. However, there is need of additional research on coronaviruses specific disinfection data generation, regular monitoring of performance considering all factors influencing virus survival, performance evaluation in actual water treatment, need of augmenting disinfection dosages, environmental considerations to select the most appropriate disinfection technology.","Kataki, Sampriti; Chatterjee, Soumya; Vairale, Mohan G.; Sharma, Sonika; Dwivedi, Sanjai K.",Resour Conserv Recycl,287,8

It is urgent to study how this group is faring during the pandemic and we focus here on their health-related worries. METHODS: A longitudinal survey at a Swedish hospital starting six months before (16 September 2019) and continuing during the COVID-19 outbreak (until 25 August 2020). 6,941 pregnant women and partners of diverse social backgrounds were recruited. 96 percent of birth-giving women in the city take early ultrasounds where recruitment took place. 62 percent of the women with an appointment and 51 percent of their partners gave consent to participate. RESULTS: Pregnant women experienced dramatically increased worries for their own health, as well as for their partner’s and their child’s health in the beginning of the pandemic. The worries remained at higher than usual levels throughout the pandemic. Similar, but less dramatic changes, were seen among partners. CONCLUSIONS: There is a need for heightened awareness of pregnant women’s and partners’ health-related worries as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic. Related feelings such as anxiety have been linked to adverse pregnancy outcome and might have long-term effects.

Calcium is an important intracellular messenger that controls diverse cellular processes. Two other clinically important coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-1 and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV, can use calcium ions to enter and replicate within host cells. Calcium may therefore be important in the pathophysiology of COVID-19 infection. We sought to investigate whether calcium derangement was a specific feature of COVID-19 that distinguishes it from other infective pneumonias, and its association with disease severity. Methods: We conducted a single centre retrospective study of albumin-corrected serum calcium on adult patients with COVID-19 who presented between March 1st and May 16th 2020. The primary outcome was maximal level of care based on the World Health Organization Clinical Progression Scale for COVID-19. Cases with community acquired pneumonia (CAP) and viral pneumonia (VP) were identified through a clinical database over three intervals (January to February 2018, January to February 2019 and September to December 2019). Results: We analysed data from 506 patients with COVID-19, 95 patients with CAP and 152 patients with VP. Hypocalcaemia (serum calcium <2.2mmol/L) was a specific and common clinical finding in patients with COVID-19 that was not present in other respiratory infections. Calcium levels were significantly lower in those with severe disease. Ordinal regression of risk estimates for categorised care levels showed that baseline hypocalcaemia was incrementally associated with odds ratio of 2.33 for higher level of care, superior to other variables that have previously been shown to predict worse COVID-19 outcome. Serial calcium levels showed improvement by day 7-9 of admission, only in in survivors of COVID-19. Conclusion: Hypocalcaemia may independently predict not only more severe but more progressive disease and warrants detailed prognostic investigation. The fact that decreased serum calcium is observed at the time of clinical presentation in COVID-19, but not other infective pneumonias, suggests that its early derangement is pathophysiological and may influence the deleterious evolution of this disease. If calcium is ultimately shown to be critical to the entry and replication of SARS-CoV-2 in host cells, unravelling how this mechanism could be therapeutically targeted deserves more intensive examination.

However, the extent to which SARS-CoV-2 vaccination induces serum responses that cross-react with other coronaviruses remains poorly studied. Here, we define serum profiles in rhesus macaques after vaccination with DNA- or Ad26-based vaccines expressing SARS-CoV-2 spike protein followed by SARS-CoV-2 challenge, or SARS-CoV-2 infection alone. Analysis of serum responses showed robust reactivity to the SARS-CoV-2 full-length spike protein and receptor binding domain (RBD), both included in the vaccine. However, serum cross-reactivity to the closely related sarbecovirus SARS-CoV-1 spike and RBD was reduced. Reactivity was also measured to the distantly related common cold alphacoronavirus (229E and NL63) and betacoronavirus (OC43 and HKU1) spike proteins. Using SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1 lentivirus-based pseudoviruses, we show that neutralizing antibody responses were predominantly SARS-CoV-2 specific. These data define patterns of cross-reactive binding and neutralizing serum responses induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection and vaccination in rhesus macaques. Our observations have important implications for understanding polyclonal responses to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, which will facilitate future CoV vaccine assessment and development. IMPORTANCE The rapid development and deployment of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines has been unprecedented. In this study, we explore the cross-reactivity of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody responses to other coronaviruses. By analyzing responses from nonhuman primates (NHPs) both before and after immunization with DNA or Ad26-vectored vaccines, we find patterns of cross-reactivity that mirror those induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection. These data highlight the similarities between infection and vaccine-induced humoral immunity for SARS-CoV-2 and cross-reactivity of these responses to other CoVs.","Jacob-Dolan, Catherine; Feldman, Jared; McMahan, Katherine; Yu, Jingyou; Zahn, Roland; Wegmann, Frank; Schuitemaker, Hanneke; Schmidt, Aaron G.; Barouch, Dan H.",J Virol,287,14

Those with severe infection are at risk of rapid clinical deterioration; as a result, intensive care unit (ICU) admission is not uncommon in such patients. A number of determinants have been identified as predictors of poor prognosis and in-hospital mortality, ranging from demographic characteristics, laboratory and/or radiological findings. Aim: To identify determinants of in-hospital mortality and examine the accuracy of seven early warning scores in predicting in-hospital mortality. Methods: This is a retrospective study conducted in Kuwait from July 2020 to March 2021, and participants were adult patients with a positive test on the real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for SARS-CoV-2 and who met the criteria for ICU admission. Data collected included: demographics, clinical status on hospital arrival, laboratory test results, and ICU course. Furthermore, we calculated seven early warning scores for each of our patients. Results: A total of 133 patients were admitted to our COVID-19 ICU with a median age of 59 years. Arrival to ICU on mechanical ventilation (MV), developing in-hospital complications, having chronic kidney disease (CKD), having a high white blood count (WBC), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), lactate, or urea levels were found to be significant predictors of in-hospital mortality. Furthermore, the 4C mortality score for COVID-19, VACO index for COVID-19 mortality, and the PRIEST COVID-19 clinical severity score proved to be the most superior in predicting in-hospital mortality.

METHODS: A total of 290 employees from various Chinese enterprises voluntarily participated in the two-wave surveys. Hierarchical regression and bootstrapping analyses based on Hayes’ Process Model were conducted to test the hypotheses. RESULTS: Results indicated that work engagement significantly mediates the association of workplace loneliness with OCBs. Gender serves as an important moderator in the relationship among workplace loneliness, work engagement, and OCBs that for female participants the indirect effect of work engagement linking workplace loneliness to OCBs was significant, but for male participants it was not. CONCLUSION: This study advances the current understandings of the moderated mediation mechanism among workplace loneliness, gender, work engagement, and OCBs.

PURPOSE: To evaluate the impact of a urinary tract infection (UTI) pocket card on preferred antibiotic prescribing for patients discharged from the emergency department (ED) with a diagnosis of cystitis. METHODS: A multicenter, retrospective, pre-post study was conducted to compare outcomes following the introduction of a UTI pocket card. The primary outcome was prescribing rates for institutional first-line preferred antibiotics (cephalexin and nitrofurantoin) versus other antimicrobials for cystitis. Secondary outcomes included prescriber adherence to recommended therapy in regards to discharge dose, frequency, duration, and healthcare utilization rates. RESULTS: The study included 915 patients in total, 407 in the preintervention group and 508 in the postintervention group. The frequency of preferred antibiotic prescribing was significantly increased after the introduction of a UTI pocket card compared to prior to its introduction (81.7% vs 72.0%, P = 0.001). Significant increases in prescribing of an appropriate antibiotic dose (78.0% vs 66.8%, P < 0.0001) and frequency (64.2% vs 47.4%, P < 0.0001) were also found post intervention. No significant differences were seen between the pre- and postintervention groups with regards to healthcare utilization rates. CONCLUSION: A UTI pocket card increased preferred antibiotic prescribing for cystitis in the ED.

It has caused a global outbreak which represents a major threat to global health. Public health resorted to non-pharmaceutical interventions such as social distancing and lockdown to slow down the spread of the pandemic. However, the effect of each of these measures remains hard to quantify. We design a multi-scale model that simulates the transmission dynamics of COVID-19. We describe the motion of individual agents using a social force model. Each agent can be either susceptible, infected, quarantined, immunized or deceased. The model considers both mechanisms of direct and indirect transmission. We parameterize the model to reproduce the early dynamics of disease spread in Italy. We show that panic situations increase the risk of infection transmission in crowds despite social distancing measures. Next, we suggest that pre-symptomatic transmission could be a significant driver of the infection spread. Then, we show that the restricted movement of the individuals flattens the epidemic curve. Finally, model predictions suggest that measures stricter than social distancing and lockdown were used to control the epidemic in Wuhan, China.","Bouchnita, Anass; Jebrane, Aissam",,287,21

He was prescribed acetaminophen with codeine. A few days later, he developed a rash on his right buttock and proximal thigh, similar to a rash he experienced in the past when he took over-the-counter (OTC) acetamenophen and an unknown lozenge to treat a presumed viral illness. A fixed drug eruption (FDE) was diagnosed and the patient was asked to avoid Tylenol and other OTC lozenges. Tylenol was entered as an allergy in the electronic medical records. However, since Tylenol, not acetaminophen was listed in the allergy profile, the order for acetaminophen and codeine did not generate an alert for the prescribing physician. Additionally, the dispensing pharmacist did not question the prescribing physician and the patient, unaware that acetaminophen in the pain medication is the same drug as Tylenol, took it and developed recurrent FDE.","Federman, Daniel; Gruen, Jadry A; Merchant, Naseema",BMJ case reports,287,8

Data sources: Articles in PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, PsycINFO, and medRxiv from March 2020 to February 6, 2021. Results: The pooled prevalence of anxiety symptoms in 23 studies comprising a total sample of 85,560 was 20% (95% CI: 15% - 25%, I2 = 99.9%), that of depression symptoms in 23 articles with a total sample comprising of 86,469 individuals was 23% (95% CI: 18% - 28%, I2 = 99.8%), and that of insomnia symptoms in 4 articles with a total sample of 915 were 52% (95% CI: 42-64%, I2 = 88.9%). The overall prevalence of mental illness symptoms in frontline HCWs, general population, and students in Spain are 42%, 19%, and 50%, respectively. Discussion: The accumulative evidence from the meta-analysis reveals that adults in Spain suffered higher prevalence rates of mental illness symptoms during the COVID-19 crisis with a significantly higher rate relative to other countries such as China. Our synthesis reveals high heterogeneity, varying prevalence rates and a relative lack of studies in frontline and general HCWs in Spain, calling future research and interventions to pay attention to those gaps to help inform evidence-based mental health policymaking and practice in Spain during the continuing COVID-19 crisis. The high prevalence rates call for preventative and prioritization measures of the mental illness symptoms during the Covid-19 pandemic.","Chen, R. Z.; Zhang, S. X.; Xu, W.; Yin, A.; Dong, R.

Little is known about the subjective burden, views, and COVID-19 infection status of HCWs. The aim of this work was to evaluate the subjective burden, the perception of the information policies, and the agreement on structural measures in a large cohort of German HCW during the COVID-19 pandemic. This country-wide anonymous online survey was carried out from April 15th until May 1st, 2020. 25 content-related questions regarding the subjective burden and other dimensions were evaluated. We evaluated different dimensions of subjective burden, stress, and perspectives using 5-point Likert-scale questions. Moreover, the individual COVID-19 infection status, the amount of people infected in circle of friends and acquaintances and the hours working overtime were assessed. A total of 3669 HCWs provided sufficient responses for analyses. 2.8% of HCWs reported to have been tested positive for COVID-19. Nurses reported in principle higher ratings on all questions of subjective burden and stress than doctors and other hospital staff. Doctors (3.6%) and nurses (3.1%) were more likely to be tested positive for COVID-19 than other hospital staff (0.6%, Chi((2))(2) = 17.39, p < 0.0005). HCWs who worked in a COVID-19 environment reported higher levels of subjective burden and stress compared to all other participants. Working in a COVID-19 environment increased the likelihood to be tested positive for COVID-19 (4.8% vs. 2.3%, Chi((1))(2) = 12.62, p < 0.0005) and the severity of the subjective burden. During the COVID-19 pandemic, nurses experience more stress than doctors. Overall, German HCWs showed high scores of agreement with the measures taken by the hospitals.

The model is based on an approach previously used to describe the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) epidemic. This methodology is used to describe the COVID-19 dynamics in six countries where the pandemic is widely spread, namely China, Italy, Spain, France, Germany, and the USA. For this purpose, data from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) are adopted. It is shown how the model can be used to forecast new infection cases and new deceased and how the uncertainties associated to this prediction can be quantified. This approach has the advantage of being relatively simple, grouping in few mathematical parameters the many conditions which affect the spreading of the disease. On the other hand, it requires previous data from the disease transmission in the country, being better suited for regions where the epidemic is not at a very early stage. With the estimated parameters at hand, one can use the model to predict the evolution of the disease, which in turn enables authorities to plan their actions. Moreover, one key advantage is the straightforward interpretation of these parameters and their influence over the evolution of the disease, which enables altering some of them, so that one can evaluate the effect of public policy, such as social distancing. The results presented for the selected countries confirm the accuracy to perform predictions.","Paiva, Henrique Mohallem; Afonso, Rubens Junqueira Magalhães; de Oliveira, Igor Luppi; Garcia, Gabriele Fernandes",PLoS One,287,9

The aim of this study was to qualify and quantify bioaerosol concentrations during bronchoscopy to estimate the occupational risk. METHODS: Full-day sampling was conducted in 2 rooms while bronchoscopies were performed on patients. Two microbial air samplers were used, a wet wall cyclonic sampler and an impactor, on culture media. Identification of the culturable bacterial flora was performed with chromatographic analysis of cellular fatty acid of the isolated strain and additional biochemical tests if needed. Specific polymerase chain reaction analysis was completed on wet wall cyclonic samples for the detection of influenza A and B and Mycobacterium spp. RESULTS: A wide variety of bacteria were collected from the ambient air. All samples yielded at least 1 Staphylococcus species. Although most of the culturable bacteria identified were normal nonpathogenic flora, such as Streptococcus spp, Neisseria spp, and Corynebacterium spp, some opportunistic pathogens, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, were found. Neither Mycobacterium spp nor influenza virus was detected with the polymerase chain reaction method during this study. CONCLUSIONS: Culturable bacteria from oral, nasal, and pulmonary flora are aerosolized during bronchoscopy and could be inhaled by medical staff. The potential presence of pathogens in those aerosols could represent an occupational infection risk.","Marchand, Geneviève; Duchaine, Caroline; Lavoie, Jacques; Veillette, Marc; Cloutier, Yves",Am J Infect Control,287,16

The measures to properly dispose of and allocate face masks during the early stage of an epidemic caused by respiratory infectious diseases deserve worldwide attention. METHODS: A qualitative research approach was used to document the practice of a citywide face mask–wearing strategy of the Shanghai Municipal Government (called the “Shanghai solution” in this article). Based on data from government work documents, an online face mask–allocation and sales system was built to offer real-time updates of face-mask appointments and sales information in all designated pharmacies and neighborhood committees in Shanghai. RESULTS: In the Shanghai solution, a total of 24.8 million residents in 6,031 committees were covered, in order to achieve universal wearing of face masks during the COVID-19 crisis. Up to 110 million face masks were dispensed to residents in six rounds of face-mask allocation during February to April. This practical experience in Shanghai solved two key problems (insufficient face-mask capacity, protection of vulnerable population) with the supply of face masks by addressing four essential characteristics: overall coordination, on-demand distribution, efficient distribution, and technical support. CONCLUSION: The practice of the citywide face mask–supply strategy of Shanghai could provide several pointers for management of a shortage of emergency materials, dispatch, and transport to other countries during the pandemic.","Zhang, Tiantian; Wang, Qian; Shi, Wenming; Sheng, Tao; Liu, Jiaxing; Zhao, Jiejin; Huang, Yuanmin; Xia, Yutian; Liu, Zhanyi; Dai, Ruiming; Bao, Zhenyu; Wu, Ping; Xu, Site; Luo, Li",Risk Manag Healthc Policy,287,30

Many of these assays have been launched by various manufacturers. Unfortunately, the new FDA emergency use regulations have resulted in a situation where laboratories have to perform their own validation studies. Numerous of these labs do not have the biobank needed to carry the studies out. Methods In this paper, we introduce a method that allows institutions to quickly perform a verifiation study in a low-prevalence infection situation. As proof of concept, we used the Roche Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 ECLIA assay and an SAP-based hospital information system. The Shenzhen YHLO Biotech IgM and IgG assay targetting other surface patterns, was used as confirmatory test. Results The Roche assay demonstrated a limit of detection of 0.069 COI (cutoff index) and successfully passed the performance validation according to CLSI EP15-A3. The study population of 627 in-patients exhibited an age median of 64 years and approximately 13% of the group were under intensive care at the respective time point. All included patients were tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 infection by qRT-PCR (cobas 6800®, Roche, Mannheim, Germany). Only one false positive result was obtained, resulting in a specificity for the Roche Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 test of 99.84% and a negative predictive value of 99.98%. Conclusions The anonymized use of residual material enables quick evaluation of anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoassays, as shown in this work with the Roche Elecsys assay. Comparison of the control population with economic data makes it possible to validate the sampling set and therefore to determine diagnostic specificity. Using the chosen approach, it was shown that the Roche test achieved very good results in terms of diagnostic specificity, reproducibility and limit of detection.","Kittel, Maximilian; Findeisen, Peter; Muth, Maria-Christina; Thiaucourt, Margot; Gerhards, Catharina; Neumaier, Michael; Haselmann, Verena",Int J Infect Dis,287,1

The samples were collected on daily basis by means of a high-volume sampling (HVS) system equipped with cascade impactor separating three size fractions, i.e., particles with aerodynamic diameters d < 1.0 μm (PM(1)), 1.0 μm <d<2.5 μm (PM(2.5)), and 2.5 μm <d<10 μm (PM(10)), respectively.

Most BAs are subsequently re-absorbed in the terminal ileum and are transported back for recycling to the liver. Some of them, however, reach the colon and change their physicochemical properties upon modification by gut bacteria, and vice versa, BAs also shape the composition and function of the intestinal microbiota. This mutual interplay of both BAs and gut microbiota regulates many physiological processes, including the lipid, carbohydrate and energy metabolism of the host. Emerging evidence also implies an important role of this enterohepatic BA circuit in shaping mucosal colonization resistance as well as local and distant immune responses, tissue physiology and carcinogenesis. Subsequently, disrupted interactions of gut bacteria and BAs are associated with many disorders as diverse as Clostridioides difficile or Salmonella Typhimurium infection, inflammatory bowel disease, type 1 diabetes, asthma, metabolic syndrome, obesity, Parkinson’s disease, schizophrenia and epilepsy. As we cannot address all of these interesting underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms here, we summarize the current knowledge about the physiologic and pathogenic interplay of local site microbiota and the enterohepatic BA metabolism using a few selected examples of liver and gut diseases.","Grüner, Niklas; Mattner, Jochen",Int J Mol Sci,287,1

Its impact in rare disease populations such as Gaucher disease (GD) is unknown. In GD, decreased acid β-glucosidase activity leads to the accumulation of inflammatory glycosphingolipids and chronic myeloid cell immune activation which a priori could predispose to the most severe effects of SARS-CoV-2. To evaluate the determinants of SARS-CoV-2 infection in GD, we conducted a cross-sectional study in a large cohort. 181 patients were enrolled, including 150 adults and 31 children, with a majority of patients on treatment (78%). Information on COVID-19 exposure, symptoms, and SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid and/or antibody testing was obtained during the peak of the pandemic in the New York City metropolitan area. Forty-five adults reported a primary exposure to someone with COVID-19 and 17 (38%) of these patients reported at least one COVID-19 symptom. A subset of adults was tested (n = 88) and in this group 18% (16/88) were positive. Patients testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 had significantly more symptoms (4.4 vs 0.3, p < 0.001) than patients testing negative. Among patients who were antibody-positive, quantitative titers indicated moderate to high antibody response. In GD adults, male gender, older age, increased BMI, comorbidities, GBA genotype, prior splenectomy and treatment status were not associated with the probability of reporting symptoms or testing positive.

While much writing to date focuses on the initial and vital responses to COVID‐19, the magnitude of this event also furthers insights into the risks of incomplete institutional designs and practices, such as the case of Brazil, an example of the administrative flaws in late democracies. This article is not a critique of responses to COVID‐19 per se, but an examination of these considering democratization processes that include state‐building and the need for another push in administrative and political reforms. Shortcomings in state‐building, which existed before COVID‐19, inflict heavy costs on society and, if left unaddressed, add to the costs of future disasters and unraveling of support for state and democratic institutions.","Puppim de Oliveira, Jose A.; Berman, Evan M.",Public Adm Rev,287,26

Here, we report a rationally designed novel HIV-1 fusion inhibitor derived from CHR-derived peptide (Trp628~Gln653, named CP), but with an innovative Ile-Asp-Leu tail (IDL) that dramatically increased the inhibitory activity by up to 100 folds. We also determined the crystal structures of artificial fusion peptides N36- and N43-L6-CP-IDL. Although the overall structures of both fusion peptides share the canonical six-helix bundle (6-HB) configuration, their IDL tails adopt two different conformations: a one-turn helix with the N36, and a hook-like structure with the longer N43. Structural comparison showed that the hook-like IDL tail possesses a larger interaction interface with NHR than the helical one. Further molecular dynamics simulations of the two 6-HBs and isolated CP-IDL peptides suggested that hook-like form of IDL tail can be stabilized by its binding to NHR trimer. Therefore, CP-IDL has potential for further development as a new HIV fusion inhibitor, and this strategy could be widely used in developing artificial fusion inhibitors against HIV and other enveloped viruses.","Zhu, Yun; Su, Shan; Qin, Lili; Wang, Qian; Shi, Lei; Ma, Zhenxuan; Tang, Jianchao; Jiang, Shibo; Lu, Lu; Ye, Sheng; Zhang, Rongguang",Sci Rep,287,16

Here we evaluated whether tocilizumab plus remdesivir provides greater benefit than remdesivir alone in patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia. METHODS: This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial included patients hospitalized with severe COVID-19 pneumonia requiring > 6 L/min supplemental oxygen. Patients were randomly assigned (2:1 ratio) to receive tocilizumab 8 mg/kg or placebo intravenously plus ≤ 10 days of remdesivir. The primary outcome was time from randomization to hospital discharge or “ready for discharge” (defined as category 1, assessed by the investigator on a 7-category ordinal scale of clinical status) to day 28. Patients were followed for 60 days. RESULTS: Among 649 enrolled patients, 434 were randomly assigned to tocilizumab plus remdesivir and 215 to placebo plus remdesivir. 566 patients (88.2%) received corticosteroids during the trial to day 28. Median time from randomization to hospital discharge or “ready for discharge” was 14 (95% CI 12–15) days with tocilizumab plus remdesivir and 14 (95% CI 11–16) days with placebo plus remdesivir [log-rank P = 0.74; Cox proportional hazards ratio 0.97 (95% CI 0.78–1.19)]. Serious adverse events occurred in 128 (29.8%) tocilizumab plus remdesivir and 72 (33.8%) placebo plus remdesivir patients; 78 (18.2%) and 42 (19.7%) patients, respectively, died by day 28. CONCLUSIONS: Tocilizumab plus remdesivir did not shorten time to hospital discharge or “ready for discharge” to day 28 compared with placebo plus remdesivir in patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia.

In this article, we contend that a contextual approach that appropriately balances children’s legal and moral rights and interests is needed when thinking about data protection issues with children. We examine three issues in health research through a child-focused lens: consent to data processing, data retention, and data protection impact assessments. We show that these issues present distinctive concerns for children and that the General Data Protection Regulation provides few bright-line rules.

Our study seeks to map, compare and contrast the symbolic responses to the Coronavirus crisis articulated by various far-right actors in two established democracies in the transatlantic area: The United States and France. We aim to shed light on how entrenched far-right mythologies and tropes—which appear increasingly transatlantic—are channeled into a new synthesis as part of an “alternative” political epistemology. Infused with the mythos of resistance and insurgency, resolutely anti-systemic, this alternative epistemology can better be described, following Michael Barkun, as a form of “stigmatized knowledge”.

METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted among all COVID-19 patients in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) of Asir Central Hospital in Saudi Arabia between the 1st and 30th of June 2020. Data extracted from patients’ medical records included their demographics, home medications, medications used to treat COVID-19, treatment durations, ICU stay, hospital stay, and ultimate outcome (recovery or death).Descriptive statistics and regression modelling were used to analyze and compare the results. The study was approved by the Institutional Ethics Committees at both Asir Central Hospital and King Khalid University. RESULTS: A total of 118 patients with median age of 57 years having definite clinical and disease outcomes were included in the study. Male patients accounted for 87% of the study population, and more than 65% experienced at least one comorbidity. The mean hospital and ICU stay was 11.4 and 9.8 days, respectively. The most common drugs used were tocilizumab (31.4%), triple combination therapy (45.8%), favipiravir (56.8%), dexamethasone (86.7%), and enoxaparin (83%). Treatment with enoxaparin significantly reduced the length of ICU stay (p = 0.04) and was found to be associated with mortality reduction in patients aged 50−75 (p = 0.03), whereas the triple regimen therapy and tocilizumab significantly increased the length of ICU stay in all patients (p = 0.01, p = 0.02 respectively). CONCLUSION: COVID-19 tends to affect males more significantly than females. The use of enoxaparin is an important part of COVID-19 treatment, especially for those above 50 years of age, while the use of triple combination therapy and tocilizumab in COVID-19 protocols should be reevaluated and restricted to patients who have high likelihood of benefit.","Assiri, Abdullah; Iqbal, Mir J.; Mohammed, Atheer; Alsaleh, Abdulrhman; Assiri, Ahmed; Noor, Adeeb; Nour, Redhwan; Khobrani, Moteb",J Infect Public Health,287,30

INTRODUCTION: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is responsible for COVID-19 infection. There has been uncertainty about use of RAAS inhibitors in COVID-19. The association of RAAS inhibitors with severity of infection and clinical outcomes was addressed in this study. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a single-center retrospective study from Indian intensive care unit (ICU). A total of 138 were included, who were divided into group A (RAAS inhibitor) and group B (non-RAAS inhibitor). They are followed up till ICU stay during which peak levels of ferritin, D dimer, interleukin-6 were noted (primary outcome). The number of ventilator days, ICU length of stay, and ICU outcome also compared. RESULTS: Of 138 patients, 18 are included in group A and 120, in group B. There is no difference in peak levels (mean) D dimer [5,893 vs 7,710, p 0.46], ferritin [2,388 vs 3,635, p 0.56], interleukin-6 [9,597 vs 3,625, p 0.06]. There is no difference in number of ventilator days (2.2 vs 1.78, p 0.53) and ICU length of stay (6.5 vs 6.1, p 0.74). CONCLUSION: RAAS inhibitors can be safely continued in COVID-19 infection.

For example, a patient admitted to a room previously occupied by a patient colonized or infected with one of these pathogens has a higher risk for acquiring one of these pathogens than a patient admitted to a room whose previous occupant was not colonized or infected. This risk is not surprising because multiple studies have demonstrated that surfaces in hospital rooms are poorly cleaned during terminal cleaning. To reduce surface contamination after terminal cleaning, no touch methods of room disinfection have been developed. This article will review the no touch methods, ultraviolet light devices, and hydrogen peroxide systems, with a focus on clinical trials which have used patient colonization or infection as an outcome. Multiple studies have demonstrated that ultraviolet light devices and hydrogen peroxide systems have been shown to inactivate microbes experimentally plated on carrier materials and placed in hospital rooms and to decontaminate surfaces in hospital rooms naturally contaminated with multidrug-resistant pathogens. A growing number of clinical studies have demonstrated that ultraviolet devices and hydrogen peroxide systems when used for terminal disinfection can reduce colonization or health care–associated infections in patients admitted to these hospital rooms.","Weber, David J.; Rutala, William A.; Anderson, Deverick J.; Chen, Luke F.; Sickbert-Bennett, Emily E.; Boyce, John M.",Am J Infect Control,287,29

This study reports the incidence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) during, respiratory complications and 30‐day mortality during the COVID‐19 pandemic. METHODS: This prospective observational cohort study included 100 consecutive patients. The primary outcome measure was 14‐day symptoms and/or SARS‐CoV‐2 test. The secondary outcome was 30‐day postoperative mortality. RESULTS: A total of 100 patients comprising 35 females and 65 males, with a mean age of 52.4 years (range, 16‐94 years) included 16 males aged greater than 70 years. The 51% of patients were tested during their admission for SARS‐CoV‐2; 5% were diagnosed/developed symptoms of SARS‐CoV‐2 during and until 14 days post‐discharge; four were male and one female, mean age 41.2 years (range, 17‐75 years), all had primary malignant bone or soft‐tissue tumours, four of five had received immunosuppressive therapy pre‐operatively. The 30‐day mortality was 1% overall and 20% in those with SARS‐CoV‐2. The pulmonary complication rate was 3% overall.

Compared to healthcare workers who did not experience childhood adversity, those who did reported more recent life events (median 11 vs. 5 over the previous 6 months, p < .001) and greater psychological distress (median score 17 vs. 13, p < .001). The relationship between life events and psychological distress was not linear. Most healthcare workers without childhood adversity (73%) reported a low number of life events which were not associated with psychological distress. Most healthcare workers with childhood adversity (81%) reported a higher number of life events, for which the correlation between events and distress was moderately strong (Spearman's rho = .50, p < .001). Childhood adversity was also associated with more missed work days. Each of these outcomes was higher in 22 healthcare workers (13%) who had experienced more than one type of childhood adversity. CONCLUSIONS: Childhood adversity is common among healthcare workers and is associated with a greater number of life events, more psychological distress and impairment.","Maunder, Robert G.; Peladeau, Nathalie; Savage, Diane; Lancee, William J.",Child Abuse Negl,287,16

Subunit vaccines may have distinct advantages when immunizing vulnerable individuals, children and pregnant women. Here, we present a new generation of subunit vaccines targeting viral antigens to CD40-expressing antigen-presenting cells. We demonstrate that targeting the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein to CD40 (αCD40.RBD) induces significant levels of specific T and B cells, with long-term memory phenotypes, in a humanized mouse model. Additionally, we demonstrate that a single dose of the αCD40.RBD vaccine, injected without adjuvant, is sufficient to boost a rapid increase in neutralizing antibodies in convalescent non-human primates (NHPs) exposed six months previously to SARS-CoV-2. Vaccine-elicited antibodies cross-neutralize different SARS-CoV-2 variants, including D614G, B1.1.7 and to a lesser extent B1.351. Such vaccination significantly improves protection against a new high-dose virulent challenge versus that in non-vaccinated convalescent animals.","Marlin, Romain; Godot, Veronique; Cardinaud, Sylvain; Galhaut, Mathilde; Coleon, Severin; Zurawski, Sandra; Dereuddre-Bosquet, Nathalie; Cavarelli, Mariangela; Gallouët, Anne-Sophie; Maisonnasse, Pauline; Dupaty, Léa; Fenwick, Craig; Naninck, Thibaut; Lemaitre, Julien; Gomez-Pacheco, Mario; Kahlaoui, Nidhal; Contreras, Vanessa; Relouzat, Francis; Fang, Raphaël Ho Tsong; Wang, Zhiqing; Ellis, Jerome; Chapon, Catherine; Centlivre, Mireille; Wiedemann, Aurelie; Lacabaratz, Christine; Surenaud, Mathieu; Szurgot, Inga; Liljeström, Peter; Planas, Delphine; Bruel, Timothée; Schwartz, Olivier; Werf, Sylvie van der; Pantaleo, Giuseppe; Prague, Mélanie; Thiébaut, Rodolphe; Zurawski, Gerard; Lévy, Yves; Grand, Roger Le",Nat Commun,287,24

PPE doffing practices of HCWs who cared for patients with viral respiratory infections were observed at an acute care hospital from March 2017 to April 2018. A trained observer recorded doffing performance of HCWs inside the patient rooms using a pre-defined checklist based on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guideline. Doffing practices were observed 162 times during care of 52 patients infected with respiratory viral pathogens. Out of the 52 patients, 30 were in droplet and contact isolation, 21 were in droplet isolation, and 1 was in contact isolation. Overall, 90% of observed doffing was incorrect, with respect to the doffing sequence, doffing technique, or use of appropriate PPE. Common errors were doffing gown from the front, removing face shield of the mask, and touching potentially contaminated surfaces and PPE during doffing. Deviations from the recommended PPE doffing protocol are common and can increase potential for contamination of the HCW’s clothing or skin after providing care. There is a clear need to change the approach used to training HCWs in PPE doffing practices.","Phan, Linh T.; Maita, Dayana; Mortiz, Donna C.; Weber, Rachel; Fritzen-Pedicini, Charissa; Bleasdale, Susan C.; Jones, Rachael M.",J Occup Environ Hyg,287,1

Due to geographical challenges and limited resources, clinicians developed novel strategies for managing patients. The use of a dual oxygen concentrator system for mechanical ventilation is one of the innovations developed by retrieval team members from the Emergency Department (ED) of the Sabah Women and Children’s Hospital. Due to conditions requiring isolation of patients suspected of or positive for COVID-19, high-risk patients were treated in an ED extension area that lacked central wall oxygen. Direct access to oxygen tanks became the only viable option, but ensuring a continuous supply was laborious. The novel setup described within this paper has been used on intubated patients in the ED extension area with moderate to high ventilator settings successfully. This simple setup, designed to meet the limited resources within a pandemic environment, needed only a turbine-driven ventilator, two oxygen concentrators, a 3-way connector, and three oxygen tubing. The application of this setup could potentially save more critically ill patients who are being managed in resource-limited conditions such as in smaller district hospitals or out in the field.","Cheah, Phee Kheng; Steven, Evelyn Marie; Ng, Khai Keam; Hashim, Muammar Iqbal; Abdul Kadir, Mohamed Hakimi; Roder, Nicholas Paul",Int J Emerg Med,287,5

Here, we demonstrated that the post-transcriptional gene silencing suppressor p19 protein from tomato bushy stunt virus substantially enhanced the transient expression of recombinant SARS-CoV nucleocapsid (rN) protein in Nicotiana benthamiana. The rN protein in the agrobacteria-infiltrated plant leaf accumulated up to a concentration of 79 μg per g fresh leaf weight at 3 days post infiltration. BALB/c mice were intraperitoneally vaccinated with pre-treated plant extract emulsified in Freund's adjuvant. The rN protein-specific IgG in the mouse sera attained a titer about 1:1,800 following three doses of immunization, which suggested effective B-cell maturation and differentiation in mice. Antibodies of the subclasses IgG1 and IgG2a were abundantly present in the mouse sera. During vaccination of rN protein, the expression of IFN-γ and IL-10 was evidently up-regulated in splenocytes at different time points, while the expression of IL-2 and IL-4 was not. Up to now, this is the first study that plant-expressed recombinant SARS-CoV N protein can induce strong humoral and cellular responses in mice.","Zheng, Nuoyan; Xia, Ran; Yang, Cuiping; Yin, Bojiao; Li, Yin; Duan, Chengguo; Liang, Liming; Guo, Huishan; Xie, Qi",Vaccine,287,9

As of March 8, 2021 more than 420,170 HCP in US had been infected with SARS CoV-2 with 1,388 deaths. In two Taiwan hospitals COVID-19 outbreaks involved HCP and resulted in shutdown of service. This report describes our prospective health surveillance of the HCP and COVID-19 containment measures in a teaching hospital in Taiwan during Jan. 1 through June 30, 2020. Methods We prospectively monitored incidents, defined as an HCP with the predefined symptoms, reported by HCP through the web-based system. HCP were managed based on an algorithm that included SARS CoV-2 RNA PCR testing. Infection prevention and control policy/practice were reviewed. Results This hospital took care of 17 confirmed COVID-19 cases during the study period and the first Case was admitted on January 23, 2020. Among the 14,210 HCP, there were 367 incident events. Of 283 HCP tested for SARS CoV-2, 179 had predefined symptoms. These included 10 HCP who met the national case definition for COVID-19 infection and 169 based on Extended COVID-19 Community Screening program. The other 104 asymptomatic HCP were tested based on hospital policy. All of them had tested negative.

Difficulties with implementation are highlighted, and a recommendation for the future is presented. This perspective is novel in the ERAS literature, and centres around increasing the understanding of perioperative care teams on the need for utilising a recognised QI method (e.g., plan–do–study–act cycles, Lean, and Six Sigma) to implement ERAS protocols (which are a QI intervention) successfully. The importance of differentiating between a QI method and a QI intervention has value across all other ERAS surgical procedures.","Wainwright, Thomas W.",Medicina (Kaunas),287,1

At present, SARS-CoV-2-infected nonhuman primates are considered the gold standard animal model for COVID-19 research. Here, we showed that northern pig-tailed macaques (Macaca leonina, NPMs) supported SARS-CoV-2 replication. Furthermore, compared with rhesus macaques, NPMs showed rapid viral clearance in lung tissues, nose swabs, throat swabs, and rectal swabs, which may be due to higher expression of interferon (IFN)-α in lung tissue. However, the rapid viral clearance was not associated with good outcome. In the second week post infection, NPMs developed persistent or even more severe inflammation and body injury compared with rhesus macaques. These results suggest that viral clearance may have no relationship with COVID-19 progression and SARS-CoV-2-infected NPMs could be considered as a critically ill animal model in COVID-19 research.","Song, Tian-Zhang; Zheng, Hong-Yi; Han, Jian-Bao; Feng, Xiao-Li; Liu, Feng-Liang; Yang, Xiang; Jin, Lin; Luo, Rong-Hua; Tian, Ren-Rong; Liu, Chao; Li, Ming-Hua; Cai, Hou-Rong; Zheng, Yong-Tang",Zool Res,287,18

A Medical Logistics Assessment,14.81003,8.718887,2020-07-09,"BACKGROUND: The accurate and rapid identification of the causative viruses is important for the timely diagnosis and management of respiratory infections. Multiplex molecular diagnostic techniques have been widely adopted to detect respiratory viruses. We compared the results of a newly upgraded, multiplex, molecular bead-based respiratory viral panel (RVP) assay with the results of Anyplex II RV16 detection kit and AdvanSure RV real-time RT-PCR assay. METHODS: We tested 254 respiratory specimens and cultured viral strains using the Luminex xTAG RVP Fast v2 assay (Luminex Molecular Diagnostics, Canada) and Anyplex II RV16 detection kit and compared the results. Specimens showing discordant results between the two assays were tested with a AdvanSure RV real-time RT-PCR assay. RESULTS: Of the 254 respiratory specimens, there was total agreement in the results between the xTAG RVP Fast v2 assay and the other real-time PCR assay in 94.1–100% of the specimens. The agreement levels were relatively low (94.1–97.6%) for specimens of adenovirus, coronavirus NL63, and parainfluenza type 3. In comparison to the other assay, the xTAG RVP Fast v2 assay detected a higher number of parainfluenza type 3 (4 cases) and metapneumovirus (9 cases). CONCLUSIONS: The xTAG RVP Fast v2 assay showed comparable capabilities compared with the other assays; it will be useful for identifying respiratory viral infections in patients with respiratory symptoms. Clinicians should be aware of the characteristics of the assays they use, since different assays show different detectability for each virus.","Ko, Dae-Hyun; Kim, Hyun Soo; Hyun, Jungwon; Kim, Han-Sung; Kim, Jae-Seok; Park, Kyoung Un; Song, Wonkeun",Ann Lab Med,287,20

We are hereby presenting analysis of clinical data collected from the first 30 COVID positive patients admitted to our teaching hospital in Sarasota Florida. METHODS: The present study was conducted at a not-for-profit 839-bed level-2 regional trauma center, level-3 neurointensive intensive care unit (ICU), and comprehensive stroke and cardiovascular center located on Florida's Central Gulf Coast. It was a single-center, retrospective review of the first 30 patients with reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction confirmed 2019-nCoV infection between March and April 2020. Deidentified patient demographic data, abnormal admission laboratory and radiology findings, treatment medications received, need for mechanical ventilation, complications, and final outcome were recorded. RESULTS: A total of 30 patients were included who were admitted during the study period. Majority of the patients (86%) were elderly, males were 57%, and the average age was 70 years (range, 38–90). About 43% had any travel history outside the region and most (83%) had a comorbidity. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath were common presenting symptoms. About 33% of the patients required ICU at presentation. Abnormal imaging on presentation was present in 80% of the patients and 42% of them had nonspecific bilateral opacities.

We approximate a 95% confidence interval (+/- 0.0755). RESULTS An overwhelming number of EMS providers report having limited access to N95 respirators, receiving little or no benefits from COVID-19 related work, and report no institutional policy on social distancing practices despite CDC recommendations. For providers who do have access to N95 respirators, 31% report having to use the same mask for 1 week or longer. Approximately [1/3] of the surveyed participants were unsure of when a COVID-19 patient is infectious. The data suggests regular decontamination of EMS equipment after each patient contact is not a regular practice. DISCUSSION Current practices to educate EMS providers on appropriate response to the novel coronavirus may not be sufficient, and future patients may benefit from a nationally established COVID-19 EMS response protocol. Further investigation on whether current EMS practices are contributing to the spread of infection is warranted.

We aimed to establish whether health outcomes and care differed between patients infected with COVID-19 with BD and patients without a diagnosis of severe mental illness. METHODS: We conducted a population-based cohort study of all patients with identified COVID-19 and respiratory symptoms who were hospitalized in France between February and June 2020. The outcomes were in-hospital mortality and intensive care unit (ICU) admission. We used propensity score matching to control for confounding factors. RESULTS: In total, 50 407 patients were included, of whom 480 were patients with BD. Patients with BD were 2 years older, more frequently women and had more comorbidities than controls without a diagnosis of severe mental illness. Patients with BD had an increased in-hospital mortality rate (26.6% v. 21.9%; p = 0.034) and similar ICU admission rate (27.9% v. 28.4%, p = 0.799), as confirmed by propensity analysis [odds ratio, 95% confidence interval (OR, 95% CI) for mortality: 1.30 (1.16–1.45), p < 0.0001]. Significant interactions between BD and age and between BD and social deprivation were found, highlighting that the most important inequalities in mortality were observed in the youngest [OR, 95% CI 2.28 (1.18–4.41), p = 0.0015] and most deprived patients with BD [OR, 95% CI 1.60 (1.33–1.92), p < 0.001]. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 patients with BD were at an increased risk of mortality, which was exacerbated in the youngest and most deprived patients with BD. Patients with BD should thus be targeted as a high-risk population for severe forms of COVID-19, requiring enhanced preventive and disease management strategies.","Fond, Guillaume; Pauly, Vanessa; Leone, Marc; Orleans, Veronica; Garosi, Alexandra; Lancon, Christophe; Auquier, Pascal; Baumstarck, Karine; Llorca, Pierre-Michel; Boyer, Laurent",Psychological medicine,287,27

Of the existing devices, all have shortcomings which render them ineffective and impractical in out-of-hospital environments. Therefore, we propose a new design for such a device, along with a pragmatic evaluation of its efficacy. Must-have criteria for the device included: reduction of aerosol transmission by at least 90% as measured by pragmatic testing; construction from readily available, inexpensive materials; easy to clean; and compatibility with common EMS stretchers. The Patient Particle Containment Chamber (PPCC) consists of a standard shower liner draped over a modified octagonal PVC pipe frame and secured with binder clips. 3D printed sleeve portals were used to secure plastic sleeves to the shower liner wall. A weighted tube sealed the exterior base of the chamber with the contours of the patient’s body and stretcher. Upon testing, the PPCC contained 99% of spray-paint particles sprayed over a 90s period.

Several published meta-analyses have provided quantitative summaries for some of these associations, but not for respiratory infections. Demonstrating a causal relationship between dampness-related agents, which are preventable exposures, and respiratory tract infections would suggest important new public health strategies. We report the results of quantitative meta-analyses of published studies that examined the association of dampness or mold in homes with respiratory infections and bronchitis. METHODS: For primary studies meeting eligibility criteria, we transformed reported odds ratios (ORs) and confidence intervals (CIs) to the log scale. Both fixed and random effects models were applied to the log ORs and their variances. Most studies contained multiple estimated ORs. Models accounted for the correlation between multiple results within the studies analyzed. One set of analyses was performed with all eligible studies, and another set restricted to studies that controlled for age, gender, smoking, and socioeconomic status. Subgroups of studies were assessed to explore heterogeneity. Funnel plots were used to assess publication bias. RESULTS: The resulting summary estimates of ORs from random effects models based on all studies ranged from 1.38 to 1.50, with 95% CIs excluding the null in all cases. Use of different analysis models and restricting analyses based on control of multiple confounding variables changed findings only slightly. ORs (95% CIs) from random effects models using studies adjusting for major confounding variables were, for bronchitis, 1.45 (1.32-1.59); for respiratory infections, 1.44 (1.31-1.59); for respiratory infections excluding nonspecific upper respiratory infections, 1.50 (1.32-1.70), and for respiratory infections in children or infants, 1.48 (1.33-1.65). Little effect of publication bias was evident. Estimated attributable risk proportions ranged from 8% to 20%. CONCLUSIONS: Residential dampness and mold are associated with substantial and statistically significant increases in both respiratory infections and bronchitis. If these associations were confirmed as causal, effective control of dampness and mold in buildings would prevent a substantial proportion of respiratory infections.","Fisk, William J; Eliseeva, Ekaterina A; Mendell, Mark J",Environ Health,287,10

Since the international sanctions regime negatively affected almost all dimensions of Iran’s health sector, this qualitative study was conducted to investigate the situation of the physical rehabilitation sector after these sanctions. METHODS: This qualitative study was conducted from January 2019 to June 2019 in Iran using Skype, telephone, and face-to-face in-depth semi-structured interviews. Purposive and snowball sampling approaches were used to identify the participants. Also, framework analysis approach was applied to analyze the collected data. RESULTS: In total, 38 individuals including health policy-maker, faculty member, rehabilitation expert, Physiotherapist, Occupational therapist, and Orthotist/Prosthetist, were involved in the study. Based on our findings, a number of challenges facing the Iranian physical rehabilitation sector during the international sanctions period included: 1) socioeconomic challenges (inadequate funding, rising inflation rate, high unemployment rate, catastrophic expenditures, and inappropriate employment status of practitioners); 2) education challenges (decreased international collaboration and shortage of training devices and materials); 3) international challenges (rising issues in accessing services for patients from neighborhood countries); and 4) service delivery challenges (shortage of raw materials for producing the orthoses and prostheses, hardening of the importing the needed equipment, inappropriate infrastructures, and impossibility to use external assistance). CONCLUSION: After international sanctions, the Iranian physical rehabilitation sector has faced considerable multifaceted challenges. Therefore, the international community must be aware of the situation and be concerned about the irreparable consequences.","Shahabi, Saeed; Teymourlouy, Ahmad Ahmadi; Shabaninejad, Hosein; Kamali, Mohammad; Lankarani, Kamran Bagheri; Mojgani, Parviz",Global Health,287,16

Despite the respiratory complication which is the most common symptomatology, multi-organ dysfunction and multiple cardiovascular complications were described such as acute myocarditis, heart failure and even arrhythmias. CASES PRESENTATION: Two patients aged 26 and 56 year-old, developed acute myocarditis related to Covid-19 infection but with different symptomatology. CASE 1: Presented to the emergency room with digestive symptomatology, Covid-19 infection was confirmed by a positive chest CT scan and positive COVID-19 serology testing. Clinical, biological, radiological findings allowed making the diagnosis of a Covid-19 infection with a bacterial superinfection complicated by a fulminant myocarditis. CASE 2: Presented to the emergency department with a chest pain, dyspnoea, paroxistic cough, myalgia and fever. A Covid-19 infection was confirmed. The electrocardiogram showed a diffuse ST elevation, echocardiography showed normal systolic function and the high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I level was high. Invasive coronary angiography was performed, revealing angiographically normal coronary arteries. CLINICAL DISCUSSION: Our 2 cases was treated differently, case 1 received antibiotherapy because of the bacterial superinfection and inotropic support for the septic and cardiogenic choc. Contrarily to case 2 who received inotropic support, immunoglobulin and corticosteroid. With a total recovery for both patients. CONCLUSION: This article can help in considering cardiac affection due to SARS-CoV2, even with poor respiratory symptomatology, and to insist on the importance of the cardiac evaluation for young patients with a sever Covid-19 infection.","Kallel, O.; Bourouis, I.; Bougrine, R.; Housni, B.; El Ouafi, N.; Ismaili, N.",Ann Med Surg (Lond),287,20

The key objective of the exercise was to foster sustainability awareness with regard to the effectiveness of tree-planting initiatives to offset carbon emissions. Collaborative learning is a process by which students work together in small groups to accomplish a common goal. As experiences are active, social and student-owned, the process leads to the development of a variety of cognitive and transferable skills that are beneficial in academia and the workplace. Through data collection/analysis, the carbon biomass exercise not only allowed students to assess critically the efficacy of a tree-planting initiative as a means to sequester carbon, but they became aware of the difficulties in performing research on complex environmental issues. The intention of the research was to give students an opportunity to practice data collection, data analysis, problem solving, teamwork, communication and scientific literacy skills, meanwhile utilizing the campus open green space to enhance the knowledge discovery process. Informal assessment and discussions with students demonstrated that the activity was successful in reaching a wide range of students with varying backgrounds and initial attitudes about climate change mitigating strategies, which was our objective. Our case study demonstrates how learning objectives can be integrated with university sustainability initiatives to improve learning and student engagement. Finally, we see green spaces as dynamic settings for learning about physical processes and issues related to environmental management and sustainability.","Ramchunder, Sorain J.; Ziegler, Alan D.",Sustain Sci,287,16

Saliva represents an interesting sampling method because it is less invasive and more convenient in patients with nasal or pharyngeal lesions. Objective: To compare the RT-qPCR test performances of saliva samples with nasal mid-turbinate swab (NMTS) and NPS samples in a cohort of ambulatory patients suspected of having COVID-19. Study Design: For each of the 112 enrolled patients, NPS, NMTS, and saliva samples were collected and tested for SARS-Cov-2 detection using three different target genes (RdRP, N and E genes) by RT-qPCR. Results: Among the positive samples (56/112), saliva samples showed a lower percentage of SARS-Cov-2 detection compared to NPS samples, (85.7 vs. 96.4%), while still a lower percentage was observed for NMTS samples (78.6%). In average, saliva samples showed higher Ct values for all tested target genes, compared to those from NPS and NMTS samples. Conclusions: By using the Allplex(TM) 2019-nCoV Assay Kit, saliva samples showed lower sensitivity for SARS CoV-2 compared to NPS samples; however, the not detected cases had lower viral burden in NPS samples (CT values >33) representing an interesting alternative sampling method in patients in which it is not possible to take a NPS sample.","Tapia, Cecilia V.; Marcia, Campos; Ivone, Mora; Nadia, Pozas; Lesly, Morales; Camila, Guzmán; Valentina, Aguilera; Paula, Ibarra; Fabien, Magne",Front Med (Lausanne),287,3

While single-nucleotide variations (SNVs) are commonly considered as driving virus adaption, RNA recombination events that delete or insert nucleic acid sequences are also critical. Whole genome targeting sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 is typically achieved using pairs of primers to generate cDNA amplicons suitable for Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS). However, paired-primer approaches impose constraints on where primers can be designed, how many amplicons are synthesized and requires multiple PCR reactions with non-overlapping primer pools. This imparts sensitivity to underlying SNVs and fails to resolve RNA recombination junctions that are not flanked by primer pairs. To address these limitations, we have designed an approach called ‘Tiled-ClickSeq’, which uses hundreds of tiled-primers spaced evenly along the virus genome in a single reverse-transcription reaction. The other end of the cDNA amplicon is generated by azido-nucleotides that stochastically terminate cDNA synthesis, removing the need for a paired-primer. A sequencing adaptor containing a Unique Molecular Identifier (UMI) is appended to the cDNA fragment using click-chemistry and a PCR reaction generates a final NGS library. Tiled-ClickSeq provides complete genome coverage, including the 5’UTR, at high depth and specificity to the virus on both Illumina and Nanopore NGS platforms. Here, we analyze multiple SARS-CoV-2 isolates and clinical samples to simultaneously characterize minority variants, sub-genomic mRNAs (sgmRNAs), structural variants (SVs) and D-RNAs. Tiled-ClickSeq therefore provides a convenient and robust platform for SARS-CoV-2 genomics that captures the full range of RNA species in a single, simple assay.","Jaworski, Elizabeth; Langsjoen, Rose M.; Mitchell, Brooke; Judy, Barbara; Newman, Patrick; Plante, Jessica A.; Plante, Kenneth S.; Miller, Aaron L.; Zhou, Yiyang; Swetnam, Daniele; Sotcheff, Stephanea; Morris, Victoria; Saada, Nehad; Machado, Rafael; McConnell, Allan; Widen, Steve; Thompson, Jill; Dong, Jianli; Ren, Ping; Pyles, Rick B.; Ksiazek, Thomas; Menachery, Vineet D.; Weaver, Scott C.; Routh, Andrew",bioRxiv,287,20

The SARS coronavirus epidemic, which began in the Fall of 2002, was related to the exotic food industry in southern China, initially involving disproportionate numbers of animal handlers, chefs, and caterers. Subsequently, person-to-person transmission spawned the outbreak. What distinguished this illness clinically was the fact that approximately half of the victims were health care workers (8), infected while caring for recognized or unrecognized patients with SARS.

It has the ability to convert high acid value feedstock into biodiesel using a single-pot reaction. However, the energy intensive process is the main disadvantage of supercritical biodiesel process. Herein, a conceptual design for the integration of supercritical biodiesel process with organic Rankine cycle (ORC) is presented to recover residual hot streams and to generate electric power. This article provides energy and techno-economic comparative study for three developed scenarios as follows: original process with no energy integration (Scenario 1), energy integrated process (Scenario 2) and advanced energy integrated process with ORC (Scenario 3). The developed integrated biodiesel process with ORC resulted in electric power generation that has not only satisfied the process electric requirement but also provided excess power of 257 kW for 8000 tonnes/annum biodiesel plant. The techno-economic comparative analysis resulted in favouring the third scenario with 36% increase in the process profitability than the second scenario. Sensitivity analysis has shown that biodiesel price variation has significant effect on the process profitability. In summary, integrating supercritical biodiesel production process with ORC appears to be a promising approach for enhancing the process techno-economic profitability and viability.","Aboelazayem, Omar; Gadalla, Mamdouh; Alhajri, Ibrahim; Saha, Basudeb",Renew Energy,287,24

Methods: This study has been done in two steps. First, the constructed implants have been used in 4 rabbits and the histopathologic response was evaluated. In the second step, the implants were used in the 6 eyes of 6 patients with end-stage glaucoma with uncontrolled IOP and poor visual acuity. The tube was made of two-layer of PTFE membrane measuring 8 * 6 mm with a thickness of 1.8 mm and a silicone tube. The rabbits and the human eyes underwent surgical implantation of the tube in the anterior chamber. The histopathologic evaluation was done using H&E staining. Visual acuity, intraocular pressure and the number of glaucoma medications were assessed before and after the surgery. Results: In the histopathologic evaluation, subconjunctival polarizing fibers of a synthetic mesh infiltrated by fibrovascular septa was seen. A granulomatous inflammatory reaction composed of histiocytes, lymphocytes, and multinucleated giant cells were seen around and between the synthetic bundles. The average age of patients was 63 ± 5.5 years. The mean IOP reached from 36.6 ± 5.7 mmHg at baseline to 16.2 ± 8.9 mmHg at the final follow-up. Patients were followed for an average of 6.6 ± 4.5 months. One patient found hypotony refractory to medical and surgical treatment, which led to implant removal. One patient had uncontrolled IOP and finally led to phthisis bulbi following slow CPC. The remaining four eyes did well during the follow-up.

There is little research on individuals' COVID-19 vaccination decision-making. Objective We aimed to determine individual preferences for COVID-19 vaccinations in China, and to assess the factors influencing vaccination decision-making to facilitate vaccination coverage. Methods A D-efficient discrete choice experiment was conducted across six Chinese provinces selected by the stratified random sampling method. Vaccine choice sets were constructed using seven attributes: vaccine effectiveness, side-effects, accessibility, number of doses, vaccination sites, duration of vaccine protection, and proportion of acquaintances vaccinated. Conditional logit and latent class models were used to identify preferences. Results Although all seven attributes were proved to significantly influence respondents’ vaccination decision, vaccine effectiveness, side-effects and proportion of acquaintances vaccinated were the most important. We also found a higher probability of vaccinating when the vaccine was more effective; risks of serious side effects were small; vaccinations were free and voluntary; the fewer the number of doses; the longer the protection duration; and the higher the proportion of acquaintances vaccinated. Higher local vaccine coverage created altruistic herd incentives to vaccinate rather than free-rider problems. The predicted vaccination uptake of the optimal vaccination scenario in our study was 84.77%. Preference heterogeneity was substantial. Individuals who were older, had a lower education level, lower income, higher trust in the vaccine and higher perceived risk of infection, displayed a higher probability to vaccinate. Conclusions Preference heterogeneity among individuals should lead health authorities to address the diversity of expectations about COVID-19 vaccinations. To maximize COVID-19 vaccine uptake, health authorities should promote vaccine effectiveness; pro-actively communicate the absence or presence of vaccine side effects; and ensure rapid and wide media communication about local vaccine coverage.","Leng, Anli; Maitland, Elizabeth; Wang, Siyuan; Nicholas, Stephen; Liu, Rugang; Wang, Jian",Vaccine,287,1

We aim to report the estimated prevalence of and risk factors for COVID-19 infection, hospitalization, and intensive care unit (ICU) admission across the three United States (US) waves in one of the largest pediatric healthcare systems in the nation. Methods: Retrospective electronic health record (EHR) review of all COVID-19 surveillance data among children aged 0–19 years seeking healthcare at one pediatric healthcare system that serves predominantly Medicaid-dependent families from 1 March 2020 to 31 March 2021. COVID-19 infection status (Y/N), hospital admission (Y/N), and ICU admission (Y/N) are the main outcomes. Results: Of 22,377 children aged ≤ 19 years tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection from March 2020–March 2021, 3126 were positive (14.0%), and out of those positive, 53.7% were hospitalized and 2.9% were admitted to the ICU. Compared to Wave 1 (1 March 2020–31 May 2020), the risk of a positive test increased from 16% (RR 1.16, 95% CI, 1.07–1.26) in Wave 2 (1 June 2020–31 October 2020) to 33% (RR 1.33, 95% CI, 1.23–1.44) in Wave 3 (1 November 2020–31 March 2021). Similarly, compared to Wave 1, the risk for hospitalization increased 86% (RR 1.86, 95% CI, 1.86–2.06) in Wave 2 and 89% in Wave 3 (RR 1.89, 95% CI, 1.70–2.08), and the risk for ICU admission increased from 10% in Wave 2 (RR 1.10, 95% CI, 0.39–3.01) to 310% in Wave 3 (RR 3.10, 95% CI, 1.21–7.80). Children with asthma, depressive disorders, type 1 or 2 diabetes, and anemia were more likely to be hospitalized while children with diabetes, obesity, cardiac malformations, and hypertension were more likely to be admitted to the ICU versus children without these conditions. Conclusions: Children were cumulatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic through the three US waves with more than a third hospitalized in Wave 3. Children with underlying health conditions were particularly at risk for severe illness and should be monitored for any long-term impacts.","Messiah, Sarah E.; Xie, Luyu; Mathew, Matthew S.; Delclos, George L.; Kohl, Harold W.; Kahn, Jeffrey S.",Children (Basel),287,28

OBJECTIVE: This study will implement an electronic health record–embedded individualized pain plan with provider and patient access in the emergency departments of 8 US academic centers to improve pain treatment for adult patients with sickle cell disease. This study will assess the overall effects of electronic health record–embedded individualized pain plans on improving patient and provider outcomes associated with pain treatment in the emergency department setting and explore barriers and facilitators to the implementation process. METHODS: A preimplementation and postimplementation study is being conducted by all 8 sites that are members of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute–funded Sickle Cell Disease Implementation Consortium. Adults with sickle cell disease aged 18 to 45 years who had a visit to a participating emergency department for vaso-occlusive episodes within 90 days prior to enrollment will be eligible for inclusion. Patients will be enrolled in the clinic or remotely. The target analytical sample size of this study is 160 patient participants (20 per site) who have had an emergency department visit for vaso-occlusive episode treatment at participating emergency departments during the study period. Each site is expected to enroll approximately 40 participants to reach the analytical sample size. The electronic health record–embedded individualized pain plans will be written by the patient’s sickle cell disease provider, and sites will work with the local informatics team to identify the best method to build the electronic health record–embedded individualized pain plan with patient and provider access. Each site will adopt required patient and provider implementation strategies and can choose to adopt optional strategies to improve the uptake and sustainability of the intervention. The study is informed by the Technology Acceptance Model 2 and the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance framework. Provider and patient baseline survey, follow-up survey within 96 hours of an emergency department vaso-occlusive episode visit, and selected qualitative interviews within 2 weeks of an emergency department visit will be performed to assess the primary outcome, patient-perceived quality of emergency department pain treatment, and additional implementation and intervention outcomes. Electronic health record data will be used to analyze individualized pain plan adherence and additional secondary outcomes, such as hospital admission and readmission rates. RESULTS: The study is currently enrolling study participants. The active implementation period is 18 months. CONCLUSIONS: This study proposes a structured, framework-informed approach to implement electronic health record–embedded individualized pain plans with both patient and provider access in routine emergency department practice. The results of the study will inform the implementation of electronic health record–embedded individualized pain plans at a larger scale outside of Sickle Cell Disease Implementation Consortium centers.

On one end of the spectrum, a patient suffering from COVID-19 may be asymptomatic or have mild symptoms, while on the other end of the spectrum, a patient may develop numerous life-threatening complications. The way a host responds to infection by SARS-CoV-2 depends on various host factors like hypertension, old age, etc., The MuLBSTA scoring system takes into account various clinical and laboratory parameters and tries to predict the mortality risk for a patient. Besides, the validation of MuLBSTA score for mortality because of COVID-19 has not been extensively studied in an Indian set-up. This study is aimed at finding the association between the MuLBSTA score and the 14-day mortality risk because of COVID-19 in Indian population. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study included 122 patients who were receiving treatment for SARS-CoV-2 infection at a tertiary hospital in Ranchi, Jharkhand. The disease severity (as per the ICMR guidelines), the MuLBSTA score, and the disease outcome of all patients were noted and analyzed in this study. RESULTS: A strong association was seen between a MuLBSTA score of ≥12 and the 14-day mortality risk in COVID-19 patients. CONCLUSION: The MuLBSTA scoring system is an easy to calculate model, which predicts the 14-day mortality risk because of SARS-CoV-2 infection. This may help the primary care physicians in stratifying and referring the patients who have a higher chance of developing severe complications.","Preetam, Mukul; Anurag, Aditya",J Family Med Prim Care,287,30

However, even tough hypovitaminosis D has been suggested to interfere with Hcy catabolism, no study has so far addressed the interaction of vitamin D and Hcy and their impact on CAD, that was the aim of present study. A cohort of consecutive patients undergoing coronary angiography in a single center were included and analyzed within the year 2019. Significant CAD was defined as at least 1 vessel stenosis > 50%, while severe CAD as left main and/or three-vessel disease. Hcy and vitamin D levels were assesssed at admission. We included 3150 patients undergoing coronary angiography at our centre, who were divided according to the quartiles values of vitamin D. Patients with lower levels of Vitamin D displayed a higher cardiovascular risk profile and a higher prevalence of CAD. We observed an inverse linear relationship between lower levels of vitamin D and higher Hcy (r = − 0.092, p < 0.001) and a higher prevalence of hyperhomocysteinemia in patients with lower quartiles values of vitamin D (p < 0.001). By forward conditional regression model, low vitamin D appeared as independent predictors of Homocysteine levels above the median (OR[95%CI] = 1.79[1.37–2.33], p < 0.001). In addition, patients with low vitamin D (below the median) and increased Hcy displayed a non-significantly higher rate of CAD (81% vs 77.7%, p = 0.13, adjusted OR[95%CI] = 1.16[0.88–1.54], p = 0.29) but a significant increase in the rate of severe left main/3-vessel CAD (37.4% vs 30.5%, p = 0.005, adjusted OR[95%CI] = 1.29[1.02–1.67], p = 0.04). Among patients with vitamin D levels above the median, Hcy levels did not impact on the prevalence and extent of CAD (77.7 vs 77.2%, p = 0.81, adjusted OR[95%CI] = 0.94[0.73–1.20], p = 0.60 for CAD and 31.8% vs 27.7%, p = 0.08, adjusted OR[95%CI] = 0.97[0.75–1.25], p = 0.81 for severe left main/3-vessel CAD). No significant interaction between Hcy and vitamin D with CAD or severe CAD was observed. The present study shows an independent inverse linear relationship between vitamin D and Hcy values. Moreover, the association of Hcy with the extent of CAD was significant only among patients with hypovitaminosis D, and not in the cohort of subjects with vitamin D levels above the median, suggesting that a normal vitamin D status can prevent the deleterious effects of hyperhomocysteinemia on coronary atherosclerosis, a hypothesis that certainly needs further confirmation in larger randomized trials.

Chronic pain, sleep problems, and depression interrelate, and have been shown to exacerbate one another, which negatively impacts quality of life. This study explored the relationships between pain severity, pain interference, sleep quality, and depression among individuals with chronic pain. Secondly, we tested whether sleep quality may moderate the relationship between pain and depression. A cross-sectional survey was completed by 1,059 adults with non-malignant chronic pain conditions (M(age) 43 years, 88% identified as women) and collected measures related to pain severity, pain interference, sleep quality, and depression. Multiple regression analyses found that pain severity, pain interference, and sleep quality are all significantly associated with depression. Secondly, moderated regression analyses revealed that sleep quality moderates the relationship between pain interference and depression among individuals with chronic pain such that good sleep quality attenuates the effect of pain interference on depression, and poor sleep quality amplifies the effect of pain interference on depression. These findings suggest that sleep quality may be a relevant therapeutic target for individuals with chronic pain and co-existing depression.","Zambelli, Zoe; Halstead, Elizabeth J.; Fidalgo, Antonio R.; Dimitriou, Dagmara",Front Psychol,287,20

The management of ITP is based on the utilization of steroids, intravenous immunoglobulins, rituximab, thrombopoietin receptor agonists (TPO-RAs), immunosuppressants and splenectomy. Recent advances in the understanding of its pathogenesis have opened new fields of therapeutic interventions. The phagocytosis of platelets by splenic macrophages could be inhibited by spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) or Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitors. The clearance of antiplatelet antibodies could be accelerated by blocking the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn), while new strategies targeting B cells and/or plasma cells could improve the reduction of pathogenic autoantibodies. The inhibition of the classical complement pathway that participates in platelet destruction also represents a new target. Platelet desialylation has emerged as a new mechanism of platelet destruction in ITP, and the inhibition of neuraminidase could dampen this phenomenon. T cells that support the autoimmune B cell response also represent an interesting target. Beyond the inhibition of the autoimmune response, new TPO-RAs that stimulate platelet production have been developed. The upcoming challenges will be the determination of predictive factors of response to treatments at a patient scale to optimize their management.","Audia, Sylvain; Bonnotte, Bernard",J Clin Med,287,6

Multiple types of data from different sources are often available for a given geographic area. Yet, most studies utilize a single type of input data when making measurements due to methodological difficulties in their joint use. We propose two deep learning-based methods for jointly utilizing satellite and street level imagery for measuring urban inequalities. We use London as a case study for three selected outputs, each measured in decile classes: income, overcrowding, and environmental deprivation. We compare the performances of our proposed multimodal models to corresponding unimodal ones using mean absolute error (MAE). First, satellite tiles are appended to street level imagery to enhance predictions at locations where street images are available leading to improvements in accuracy by 20, 10, and 9% in units of decile classes for income, overcrowding, and living environment. The second approach, novel to the best of our knowledge, uses a U-Net architecture to make predictions for all grid cells in a city at high spatial resolution (e.g. for 3 m × 3 m pixels in London in our experiments). It can utilize city wide availability of satellite images as well as more sparse information from street-level images where they are available leading to improvements in accuracy by 6, 10, and 11%.

In-hospital treatment addresses the multifaceted nature of the illness including viral replication, cytokine storm, and endothelial injury with thrombosis. We identified nine reports of early treatment outcomes in COVID-19 nursing home patients. Multi-drug therapy including hydroxychloroquine with one or more anti-infectives, corticosteroids, and antithrombotic agents can be extended to seniors in the nursing home setting without hospitalization. Data from nine studies found multidrug regimens relying on the use of hydroxychloroquine as well as other agents including doxycycline were associated with a statistically significant and >60% reductions in mortality. Going forward, we theorize and based on the evidence, that early empiric treatment for the elderly with COVID-19 in the nursing home setting (or similar congregated settings with elderly residents/patients) has a genuine probability of success and acceptable safety. This group remains our highest at-risk group and warrants acute treatment focus that will prevent the development and/or worsening of problems associated with COVID-19, most particularly isolation, hospitalization, and death. In fact, with the rapidity and severity of SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks in nursing homes, in-center treatment of patients with acute COVID-19 is possibly the most rational and importantly feasible strategy to reduce the risks of hospitalization and death. If the approach remains wait-and-see and elderly high-risk patients in such congregated nursing room type settings are allowed to worsen with no early treatment, they may be too sick and fragile to benefit from in-hospital therapeutics and are at risk for pulmonary failure, life-ending micro-thrombi of the lungs, kidneys etc. We put forth the notion that the most important factor in this regard, is making available early therapeutic intervention as described here. These drugs include and under supervision by skilled doctors, combination/sequenced ivermectin, hydroxychloroquine, colchicine, azithromycin, doxycycline, bromhexine hydrochloride, and favipiravir (outside the US), along with inhaled steroids such as budesonide and oral steroids including dexamethasone and prednisone, and anti-thrombotic anti-clotting drugs such as heparin). As the clinical trials data on treatments for COVID-19 mature, this early treatment therapeutic option deserves serious, urgent, and sober consideration by the medical establishment and respective decision-makers.","Alexander, P.

Regular temperature screening is nonetheless used in some settings, including university campuses, to reduce transmission potential. We evaluated the potential impact of this strategy using a prospective university-affiliated cohort. METHODS: Between June and August 2020, 2912 participants were enrolled and tested for SARS-CoV-2 by PCR at least once (median: 3, range: 1–9). Participants reported temperature and symptoms daily via electronic survey using a previously owned or study-provided thermometer. We assessed feasibility and acceptability of daily temperature monitoring, calculated sensitivity and specificity of various fever-based strategies for restricting campus access to reduce transmission, and estimated the association between measured temperature and SARS-CoV-2 test positivity using a longitudinal binomial mixed model. RESULTS: Most participants (70.2%) did not initially have a thermometer for taking their temperature daily. Across 5481 total person months, the average daily completion rate of temperature values was 61.6% (median: 67.6%, IQR: 41.8–86.2%). Sensitivity for SARS-CoV-2 ranged from 0% (95% CI 0–9.7%) to 40.5% (95% CI 25.6–56.7%) across all strategies for self-report of possible COVID-19 symptoms on day of specimen collection, with corresponding specificity of 99.9% (95% CI 99.8–100%) to 95.3% (95% CI 94.7–95.9%). An increase of 0.1 °F in individual mean body temperature on the same day as specimen collection was associated with 1.11 increased odds of SARS-CoV-2 positivity (95% CI 1.06–1.17). CONCLUSIONS: Our study is the first, to our knowledge, that examines the feasibility, acceptability, and effectiveness of daily temperature screening in a prospective cohort during an infectious disease outbreak, and the only study to assess these strategies in a university population. Daily temperature monitoring was feasible and acceptable; however, the majority of potentially infectious individuals were not detected by temperature monitoring, suggesting that temperature screening is insufficient as a primary means of detection to reduce transmission of SARS-CoV-2.

This review sought to summarize the key literature regarding transmission, case definitions, clinical management, and the burden of COVID-19. Our review of the literature showed that SARS-CoV-2 was mainly transmitted via inhalation of respiratory droplets containing the virus and had a mean incubation period of 4–6 days. The commonly reported symptoms were fever (75.3% ± 18.7%) and cough (62.6% ± 17.7%) across the spectrum of clinical disease—mild, moderate, severe, and critical, but with the disease phenotype varying with severity. Categorization of these cases for home care or hospital management needs to be defined, with risk stratification accounting for the age of the patient and the presence of underlying comorbidities. The case definitions varied among countries, which could have contributed to the differences in the case fatality rates among affected countries. The severity and risk of death due to COVID-19 was associated with age and underlying comorbidities. Asymptomatic cases, which constitute 40–80% of COVID-19 cases are a considerable threat to control efforts. The presence of fever and cough may be sufficient to warrant COVID-19 testing, but using these symptoms in isolation will miss a proportion of cases.

MÉTHODES: Nous avons utilisé des ensembles de données reliées pour comparer les caractéristiques de la maladie et la mortalité chez les patients sous dialyse à long terme en Ontario qui ont testé positif pour le SRAS-CoV-2 et ceux qui n’ont pas développé d’infection, entre le 12 mars et le 20 août 2020. Nous avons recueilli des données sur l’infection par le SRAS-CoV-2 de manière prospective. Nous avons évalué les facteurs de risque d’infection et de mortalité par des analyses de régression logistique multivariées. RÉSULTATS: Pendant la période à l’étude, 187 patients dialysés sur 12 501 (1,5 %) ont reçu un diagnostic d’infection par le SRAS-CoV-2. Parmi eux, 117 (62,6 %) ont été hospitalisés, et le taux de mortalité était de 28,3 %. Les facteurs prédictifs significatifs associés à l’infection incluaient l’hémodialyse dans un centre plutôt que la dialyse à domicile (rapport de cotes [RC] 2,54; intervalle de confiance [IC] à 95 % 1,59–4,05), le fait de vivre dans un établissement de soins de longue durée (RC 7,67; IC à 95 % 5,30–11,11), le fait d’habiter la région du Grand Toronto (RC 3,27; IC à 95 % 2,21–4,80), les ethnicités Noire (RC 3,05; IC à 95 % 1,95–4,77), du sous-continent indien (RC 1,70; IC à 95 % 1,02–2,81) et autres non blanches (RC 2,03; IC à 95 % 1,38–2,97) et les quintiles de revenu inférieurs (RC 1,82; IC à 95 % 1,15–2,89). INTERPRÉTATION: Les patients sous dialyse à long terme sont exposés à un risque accru d’infection par le SRAS-CoV-2 et de mortalité due à la maladie à coronavirus 2019. Il faudra travailler à éliminer les facteurs de risque d’infection et vacciner ces patients en priorité.","Taji, Leena; Thomas, Doneal; Oliver, Matthew J.; Ip, Jane; Tang, Yiwen; Yeung, Angie; Cooper, Rebecca; House, Andrew A.; McFarlane, Phil; Blake, Peter G.",CMAJ,287,29

An international group of experts in lung cancer radiotherapy established this practice recommendation pertaining to whether and how to adapt radiotherapy for lung cancer in the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: For this ESTRO & ASTRO endorsed project, 32 experts in lung cancer radiotherapy contributed to a modified Delphi consensus process. We assessed potential adaptations of radiotherapy in two pandemic scenarios. The first, an early pandemic scenario of risk mitigation, is characterized by an altered risk–benefit ratio of radiotherapy for lung cancer patients due to their increased susceptibility for severe COVID-19 infection, and minimization of patient travelling and exposure of radiotherapy staff. The second, a later pandemic scenario, is characterized by reduced radiotherapy resources requiring patient triage. Six common lung cancer cases were assessed for both scenarios: peripherally located stage I NSCLC, locally advanced NSCLC, postoperative radiotherapy after resection of pN2 NSCLC, thoracic radiotherapy and prophylactic cranial irradiation for limited stage SCLC and palliative thoracic radiotherapy for stage IV NSCLC. RESULTS: In a risk-mitigation pandemic scenario, efforts should be made not to compromise the prognosis of lung cancer patients by departing from guideline-recommended radiotherapy practice. In that same scenario, postponement or interruption of radiotherapy treatment of COVID-19 positive patients is generally recommended to avoid exposure of cancer patients and staff to an increased risk of COVID-19 infection. In a severe pandemic scenario characterized by reduced resources, if patients must be triaged, important factors for triage include potential for cure, relative benefit of radiation, life expectancy, and performance status. Case-specific consensus recommendations regarding multimodality treatment strategies and fractionation of radiotherapy are provided. CONCLUSION: This joint ESTRO-ASTRO practice recommendation established pragmatic and balanced consensus recommendations in common clinical scenarios of radiotherapy for lung cancer in order to address the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Guckenberger, Matthias; Belka, Claus; Bezjak, Andrea; Bradley, Jeffrey; Daly, Megan E.; DeRuysscher, Dirk; Dziadziuszko, Rafal; Faivre-Finn, Corinne; Flentje, Michael; Gore, Elizabeth; Higgins, Kristin A.; Iyengar, Puneeth; Kavanagh, Brian D.; Kumar, Sameera; Le Pechoux, Cecile; Lievens, Yolande; Lindberg, Karin; McDonald, Fiona; Ramella, Sara; Rengan, Ramesh; Ricardi, Umberto; Rimner, Andreas; Rodrigues, George B.; Schild, Steven E.; Senan, Suresh; Simone II, Charles B.; Slotman, Ben J.; Stuschke, Martin; Videtic, Greg; Widder, Joachim; Yom, Sue S.; Palma, David",Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys,287,2

Susceptibility to accumulation of multiple NCDs is rooted in social, economic and cultural contexts, with important differences in the burden, patterns, and determinants of multimorbidity across settings. Despite high prevalence of individual NCDs within the Caribbean region, exploration of the social epidemiology of multimorbidity remains sparse. This study aimed to examine the social determinants of NCD multimorbidity in Jamaica, to better inform prevention and intervention strategies. METHODS: Latent class analysis (LCA) was used to examine social determinants of identified multimorbidity patterns in a sample of 2551 respondents aged 15–74 years, from the nationally representative Jamaica Health and Lifestyle Survey 2007/2008. Multimorbidity measurement was based on self-reported presence/absence of 11 chronic conditions. Selection of social determinants of health (SDH) was informed by the World Health Organization’s Commission on SDH framework. Multinomial logistic regression models were used to estimate the association between individual-level SDH and class membership. RESULTS: Approximately one-quarter of the sample (24.05%) were multimorbid. LCA revealed four distinct profiles: a Relatively Healthy class (52.70%), with a single or no morbidity; and three additional classes, characterized by varying degrees and patterns of multimorbidity, labelled Metabolic (30.88%), Vascular-Inflammatory (12.21%), and Respiratory (4.20%). Upon controlling for all SDH (Model 3), advancing age and recent healthcare visits remained significant predictors of all three multimorbidity patterns (p < 0.001). Private insurance coverage (relative risk ratio, RRR = 0.63; p < 0.01) and higher educational attainment (RRR = 0.73; p < 0.05) were associated with lower relative risk of belonging to the Metabolic class while being female was a significant independent predictor of Vascular-Inflammatory class membership (RRR = 2.54; p < 0.001). Material circumstances, namely housing conditions and features of the physical and neighbourhood environment, were not significant predictors of any multimorbidity class. CONCLUSION: This study provides a nuanced understanding of the social patterning of multimorbidity in Jamaica, identifying biological, health system, and structural determinants as key factors associated with specific multimorbidity profiles. Future research using longitudinal designs would aid understanding of disease trajectories and clarify the role of SDH in mitigating risk of accumulation of diseases.","Craig, Leslie S.; Cunningham-Myrie, Colette A.; Hotchkiss, David R.; Hernandez, Julie H.; Gustat, Jeanette; Theall, Katherine P.",BMC Public Health,287,8

Considering the significance of reducing undernourishment, the current study focuses on exploring the macroeconomic determinants of undernourishment in the South Asian panel. The study employed econometric models that are more robust to underpin cross-sectional dependency and heterogeneity in a panel data set. The overall findings reveal that an increase in food production increases undernourishment and infer that food availability at the national level is insufficient to reduce undernourishment unless poor people also had economic and physical access to food. In the case of economic growth and governance, the results are negatively significant in some countries. The results infer that GDP and quality of governance are nuanced in declining the rate of undernourishment in some countries, while in other countries where the results are found insignificant, the government should seek other interventions to curtail the prevalence of undernourishment. Unexpectedly, an increase in food prices lessens the undernourishment in developing countries that reflect that food prices might transform the dietary patterns of poor people from nutrient-rich foods to nutrient-poor staples, thus lead to undernourishment reduction but trigger overweight and obesity alongside. In conclusion, the results depict that policymakers should devise strategies keeping in view fundamental aspects of the country to reduce undernourishment.","Aziz, Noshaba; He, Jun; Raza, Ali; Sui, Hongguang; Yue, Wang",Front Public Health,287,1
