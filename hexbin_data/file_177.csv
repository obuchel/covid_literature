412,"Virology Experts in the Boundary Zone Between Science, Policy and the Public: A Biographical Analysis",2010-05-28,"This article aims to open up the biographical black box of three experts working in the boundary zone between science, policy and public debate. A biographical-narrative approach is used to analyse the roles played by the virologists Albert Osterhaus, Roel Coutinho and Jaap Goudsmit in policy and public debate. These figures were among the few leading virologists visibly active in the Netherlands during the revival of infectious diseases in the 1980s. Osterhaus and Coutinho in particular are still the key figures today, as demonstrated during the outbreak of novel influenza A (H1N1). This article studies the various political and communicative challenges and dilemmas encountered by these three virologists, and discusses the way in which, strategically or not, they handled those challenges and dilemmas during the various stages of the field’s recent history. Important in this respect is their pursuit of a public role that is both effective and credible. We will conclude with a reflection on the H1N1 pandemic, and the historical and biographical ties between emerging governance arrangements and the experts involved in the development of such arrangements.","van Rijswoud, Erwin",Minerva,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2898100/,177
1026,Complement in Action: An Analysis of Patent Trends from 1976 Through 2011,2012-08-10,"Complement is an essential part of the innate immune response. It interacts with diverse endogenous pathways and contributes to the maintenance of homeostasis, the modulation of adaptive immune responses, and the development of various pathologies. The potential usefulness, in both research and clinical settings, of compounds that detect or modulate complement activity has resulted in thousands of publications on complement-related innovations in fields such as drug discovery, disease diagnosis and treatment, and immunoassays, among others. This study highlights the distribution and publication trends of patents related to the complement system that were granted by the United States Patent and Trademark Office from 1976 to the present day. A comparison to complement-related documents published by the World Intellectual Property Organization is also included. Statistical analyses revealed increasing diversity in complement-related research interests over time. More than half of the patents were found to focus on the discovery of inhibitors; interest in various inhibitor classes exhibited a remarkable transformation from chemical compounds early on to proteins and antibodies in more recent years. Among clinical applications, complement proteins and their modulators have been extensively patented for the diagnosis and treatment of eye diseases (especially age-related macular degeneration), graft rejection, cancer, sepsis, and a variety of other inflammatory and immune diseases. All of the patents discussed in this chapter, as well as those from other databases, are available from our newly constructed complement patent database: www.innateimmunity.us/patent.","Yang, Kun; DeAngelis, Robert A.; Reed, Janet E.; Ricklin, Daniel; Lambris, John D.",Complement Therapeutics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3535477/,177
5199,A CA-based epidemic model for HIV/AIDS transmission with heterogeneity,2008-06-07,Cell killing by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is thought to contribute to many of the defects of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Two types of cytopathology are observed in HIV-infected cultured cells: cell-cell fusion and killing of single cells. Both killing processes appear to involve cell surface effects of HIV. A model is proposed for the HIV-mediated cell surface processes which could result in cell-cell fusion and single cell killing. The purpose of this model is to define the potential roles of individual viral envelope and cell surface molecules in cell killing processes and to identify alternative routes to the establishment of persistently-infected cells. Elucidation of HIV-induced cell surface effects may provide the basis for a rational approach to the design of antiviral agents which are selective for HIV-infected cells.,"Garry, Robert F.; Gottlieb, A.

5508,"Risicoperceptie van infecties van mensen door het vogelgriepvirus in Nederland: Sterk gevoel van risico, maar beperkt vertrouwen in beschermingsmaatregelen",2007,"We previously reported the development of a neutralization assay system for evaluating Japanese Encephalitis Virus (JEV) neutralizing antibody (NAb) using pseudotyped-JEV (JEV-PV). JEV-PV-based neutralization assay offers several advantages compared with the current standard plaque-reduction neutralization test (PRNT), including simplicity, safety, and speed. To evaluate the suitability of the JEV-PV assay as new replacement neutralization assay, we compared its repeatability, reproducibility, specificity, and correlated its results with those obtained using the PRNT. These analyses showed a close correlation between the results obtained with the JEV-PV assay and the PRNT, using the 50% plaque reduction method as a standard for measuring NAb titers to JEV. The validation results met all analytical acceptance criteria. These results suggest that the JEV-PV assay could serve as a safe and simple method for measuring NAb titer against JEV and could be used as an alternative approach for assaying the potency of JEV neutralization.","Lee, Hee-Jung; Min, Kyung-Il; Park, Ki Hoon; Choi, Hyo Jung; Kim, Min-Kyoung; Ahn, Chi-Young; Hong, Young-Jin; Kim, Young Bong",J Microbiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7090846/,177

15119,The Special Issue in the Special Time,2020-12-09,"In recent years, in the context of China’s continuous medical and health reforms, the health status of Chinese women and children has been significantly improved through the continuous efforts of staff at all levels of maternal and child health care institutions. Many indicators in maternal health care have improved significantly, but the speed and magnitude of changes have varied. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the dynamic changes in China’s maternal health status from 2004 to 2018, in order to determine whether China’s medical and health reform measures in recent years have improved maternal health. A total of 6 evaluation indicators from the data of China Health Statistics Yearbook 2019 were selected. Then, based on the multi-criteria decision-making (MCDA) methodology, the entropy weighted technique for order preference by similarity to an ideal solution (TOPSIS), entropy weighted rank-sum ratio (RSR) method and the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation were employed in this study. In addition, sensitivity analysis was engaged to validate the stability and accuracy of the achieved results. The study results shows the ranking values of various methods were not exactly the same, but the overall trend was consistent. Overall, the maternal health care in China improved from 2004 to 2018 year by year, of which the top four were ranked from 2015 to 2018, and relatively poor from 2004 to 2006. This means that the policies and measures implemented in China’s medical and health reform in the past few decades have effectively promoted China’s maternal health care, and this will also provide a theoretical basis for future decisions to promote maternal health care.","Zhao, Qianlong; Chen, Junyi; Li, Fulun; Li, Aishu; Li, Qian",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7842919/,177
15796,Food Innovation Adoption and Organic Food Consumerism—A Cross National Study between Malaysia and Hungary,2021-02-07,"Background: Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a safe, tolerable, and acceptable technique in adults. However, there is limited evidence for its safety in youth. Although limited, there are a handful of important empirical articles that have evaluated safety and tolerability outcomes in youth. However, a synthesis of pediatric safety studies is not currently available. Objective: To synthesize objective evidence regarding the safety and tolerability of pediatric tDCS based on the current state of the literature. Methods: Our search and report used PRISMA guidelines. Our method systematically examined investigations purposefully designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and acceptability of tDCS in healthy and atypical youth that were submitted to three databases, from the beginning of the database to November 2019. Safety considerations were evaluated by studies utilizing neuroimaging, physiological changes, performance on tasks, and by analyzing reported and objective side effects; tolerability via rate of adverse events; and acceptability via rate of dropouts. Results: We report on 203 sham sessions, 864 active sessions up to 2 mA, and 303 active hours of stimulation in 156 children. A total of 4.4% of the active sessions were in neurotypical controls, with the other 95.6% in clinical subjects. Conclusion: In spite of the fact that the current evidence is sporadic and scarce, the presently reviewed literature provides support for the safety, tolerability, and acceptability, of tDCS in youth for 1–20 sessions of 20 min up to 2 mA. Future pediatric tDCS research is encouraged.","Buchanan, Derrick Matthew; Bogdanowicz, Thomas; Khanna, Neha; Lockman-Dufour, Guillaume; Robaey, Philippe; D’Angiulli, Amedeo",Brain Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7916366/,177

17311,The Predation Game: Does dividing attention affect patterns of human foraging?,2021-05-06,"BACKGROUND: Despite public perception, most of the nearly 20 million US veterans have health coverage outside the Veterans Health Administration (VHA), and VHA eligibility and utilization vary across veterans. Out-of-pocket healthcare spending thus remains a potential source of financial hardship for veterans. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) aimed to expand health insurance access, but its effect on veterans’ financial risk protection has not been explored. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether ACA implementation was associated with changes in veterans’ risk of catastrophic health expenditures, and to characterize drivers of catastrophic health spending among veterans post-ACA. DESIGN: Using multivariable linear probability regression, we examined changes in likelihood of catastrophic health spending after ACA implementation, stratifying by age (18–64 vs 65+), household income tercile, and payer (VHA vs non-VHA). Among veterans with catastrophic spending post-ACA, we evaluated sources of out-of-pocket spending. PARTICIPANTS: Nationally representative sample of 13,030 veterans aged 18+ from the 2010 to 2017 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey. INTERVENTION: ACA implementation, January 1, 2014. MAIN MEASURES: Likelihood of catastrophic health expenditures, defined as household out-of-pocket spending exceeding 10% of household income. KEY RESULTS: Among veterans aged 18–64, ACA implementation was associated with a 26% decrease in likelihood of catastrophic health expenditures (absolute change, −1.4 percentage points [pp]; 95% CI, −2.6 to −0.2; p=0.03), which fell from 5.4% pre-ACA to 3.9% post-ACA. This was driven by a 38% decrease in catastrophic spending among veterans with non-VHA coverage (absolute change, −1.8pp; 95% CI, −3.0 to −0.6; p=0.003). In contrast, catastrophic expenditure rates among veterans aged 65+ remained high, at 13.0% pre- and 12.5% post-ACA. Major drivers of veterans’ spending post-ACA include dental care, prescription drugs, and home care. CONCLUSIONS: ACA implementation was associated with reduced household catastrophic health expenditures for younger but not older veterans. These findings highlight gaps in veterans’ financial protection and areas amenable to policy intervention.

18807,Boosting Sustainability in Healthcare Sector through Fintech: Analyzing the Moderating Role of Financial and ICT Development,2021-06-24,"Bacillus anthracis is a gram positive, deadly spore forming bacteria causing anthrax and these bacteria having the complex mechanism in the cell wall envelope, which can adopt the changes in environmental conditions. In this, the membrane bound cell wall proteins are said to progressive drug target for the inhibition of Bacillus anthracis. Among the cell wall proteins, the SrtA is one of the important mechanistic protein, which mediate the ligation with LPXTG motif by forming the amide bonds. The SrtA plays the vital role in cell signalling, cell wall formation, and biofilm formations. Inhibition of SrtA leads to rupture of the cell wall and biofilm formation, and that leads to inhibition of Bacillus anthracis and thus, SrtA is core important enzyme to study the inhibition mechanism. In this study, we have examined 28 compounds, which have the inhibitory activity against the Bacillus anthracis SrtA for developing the 3D-QSAR and also, compounds binding selectivity with both open and closed SrtA conformations, obtained from 100 ns of MD simulations. The binding site loop deviate in forming the open and closed gate mechanism is investigated to understand the inhibitory profile of reported compounds, and results show the closed state active site conformations are required for ligand binding specificity. Overall, the present study may offer an opportunity for better understanding of the mechanism of action and can be aided to further designing of a novel and highly potent SrtA inhibitors.","Selvaraj, Chandrabose; Selvaraj, Gurudeeban; Mohamed Ismail, Randa; Vijayakumar, Rajendran; Baazeem, Alaa; Wei, Dong-Qing; Singh, Sanjeev Kumar",Saudi J Biol Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8241892/,177

19040,A New Paradigm in the Relationship between Melatonin and Breast Cancer: Gut Microbiota Identified as a Potential Regulatory Agent,2021-06-23,"Mast cells play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of type 1 allergic reactions by binding to IgE and allergen complexes and initiating the degranulation process, releasing pro-inflammatory mediators. Recently, research has focused on finding a stable and effective anti-allergy compound to prevent or treat anaphylaxis. Dihydromyricetin (DHM) is a flavonoid compound with several pharmacological properties, including free radical scavenging, antithrombotic, anticancer, and anti-inflammatory activities. In this study, we investigated the anti-allergic inflammatory effects and the underlying molecular mechanism of DHM in the DNP-IgE-sensitized human mast cell line, KU812. The cytokine levels and mast cell degranulation assays were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The possible mechanism of the DHM-mediated anti-allergic signaling pathway was analyzed by western blotting. It was found that treatment with DHM suppressed the levels of inflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IL-6 in DNP-IgE-sensitized KU812 cells. The anti-allergic inflammatory properties of DHM were mediated by inhibition of NF-κB activation. In addition, DHM suppressed the phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5) and mast cell-derived tryptase production. Our study shows that DHM could mitigate mast cell activation in allergic diseases.","Chang, Tsong-Min; Hsiao, Tzu-Chih; Yang, Ting-Ya; Huang, Huey-Chun",Molecules,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8270306/,177

Optimal self-perceived coping with death involves valuing these difficult situations as challenges and actively coping with work-related stress during the care of the dying patient. Thus, the aim of this study was to assess Spanish nurses’ self-perceived competence with patient death and investigate its relationship with their personality traits, anxiety and fear of death. A cross-sectional study based on a web-based survey was conducted. A sample of 534 Spanish nurses provided socio-demographic information and answered validated questionnaires. Most participants perceived their coping with death as optimal. Men and nurses older than 31 years coped better with death. Professionals with an optimal self-perception showed significantly lower scores on all personality dimensions evaluated, while a higher level of the anxiety trait predicted worse coping. Although with medium explanatory power, psychoticism, anxiety, and fear of death were the main predictors of the development of optimal coping with death among Spanish nurses. These characteristics together with information from the work environment and evidence-based practice could help to develop better routines and contexts of care for nurses working in end-of-life care.","Povedano-Jiménez, María; Ropero-Padilla, Carmen; Rodriguez-Arrastia, Miguel; García-Caro, María Paz",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8465186/,177

25441,The Age of Transformation,2011-09-30,"Lower respiratory tract infections, according to the World Health Organization, account for nearly one third of all deaths from infectious diseases. They account for approximately 4 million deaths annually including children and adults and provide a greater disease burden than HIV and malaria. Among the common respiratory diseases, tuberculosis, influenza, and pneumonia are very common and can be life threatening if not treated properly. The causative agent of tuberculosis is the slow-growing bacilli Mycobacterium tuberculosis, while the causative agent of influenza is a segmented genome RNA virus. Pneumonia can be caused by a number of different microorganisms like bacteria, virus, and mycoplasma. In case of the entry of a pathogen in our body, the immune system gets activated, and the phagocytic cells try to eliminate it by generating reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS and RNS) inside the phagosome. These reactive species or respiratory bursts are sufficient to eliminate most of the pathogens, except a few. M. tuberculosis is one such microorganism that has evolved mechanisms to escape this respiratory burst-mediated killing and thus survive and grow inside the macrophages. Infection with M. tuberculosis leads to the destruction of macrophages and release of cytokines, which lead to prolonged immune activation and oxidative stress. In some cases, the bacilli remain dormant inside macrophages for a long time. Flu viruses infect the epithelial cells present in respiratory tract, and the infection site is dependent on the hemagglutinin protein present on their capsid. Destruction of epithelial cells promotes secretion of mucus and activation of immune system leading to the oxidative damage. Community-acquired pneumonia is more serious and difficult to treat. In all these infections, ROS/RNS are developed as a defense mechanism against the pathogen. Persistence of the pathogen for a long time would lead to the uncontrolled production of ROS/RNS which will lead to oxidative stress and tissue damage to the host. Administration of antioxidants along with conventional treatments can be useful in the elimination of the reactive oxygen and nitrogen species.","Sarkar, Kasturi; Sil, Parames C.",Oxidative Stress in Lung Diseases,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7122037/,177

The relationship between respiratory tract infection, especially viral infection, and exacerbations of airway diseases is very well established. However, research is required to find new ways to distinguish between the colonization and infective exacerbations of COPD to gain a better understanding of the role of infection in the disease. With advances in molecular biology, the antigenic structures of bacteria and the evaluation of the antibody response to antigens can become the basis for identifying an acute exacerbation of COPD (AECB). Most clinical trials of antibiotics were performed for licensing, and patients with pathogens resistant to different antimicrobials were excluded. Future studies of new antimicrobials should examine clinical efficacy more stringently based on a classification system that would help select patients most likely to benefit from an antibiotic. These studies should also include well-defined prospective economic analyses and quality-of-life assessment to ascertain the cost utility of the antibiotic in question.","Sharma, Sat; Anthonisen, Nicholas",Asthma and COPD,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7155477/,177

Attaching importance to such similarity helps identify fake news stories that, for example, attempt to use irrelevant images to attract readers’ attention. In this work, we propose a [Formula: see text]imilarity-[Formula: see text]ware [Formula: see text]ak[Formula: see text] news detection method ([Formula: see text]) which investigates multi-modal (textual and visual) information of news articles. First, neural networks are adopted to separately extract textual and visual features for news representation. We further investigate the relationship between the extracted features across modalities. Such representations of news textual and visual information along with their relationship are jointly learned and used to predict fake news. The proposed method facilitates recognizing the falsity of news articles based on their text, images, or their “mismatches.” We conduct extensive experiments on large-scale real-world data, which demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.","Zhou, Xinyi; Wu, Jindi; Zafarani, Reza",Advances in Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7206257/,177
32418,Analysis of Disputed Territories in the Barents Sea,2020-04-25,"Subspace clustering has been gaining increasing attention in recent years due to its promising ability in dealing with high-dimensional data. However, most of the existing subspace clustering methods tend to only exploit the subspace information to construct a single affinity graph (typically for spectral clustering), which often lack the ability to go beyond a single graph to explore multiple graphs built in various subspaces in high-dimensional space. To address this, this paper presents a new spectral clustering approach based on subspace randomization and graph fusion (SC-SRGF) for high-dimensional data. In particular, a set of random subspaces are first generated by performing random sampling on the original feature space. Then, multiple K-nearest neighbor (K-NN) affinity graphs are constructed to capture the local structures in the generated subspaces. To fuse the multiple affinity graphs from multiple subspaces, an iterative similarity network fusion scheme is utilized to achieve a unified graph for the final spectral clustering. Experiments on twelve real-world high-dimensional datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach. The MATLAB source code is available at https://www.researchgate.net/publication/338864134.","Cai, Xiaosha; Huang, Dong; Wang, Chang-Dong; Kwoh, Chee-Keong",Advances in Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7206270/,177

32421,Influence Across Agents and Issues in Combinatorial and Collective Decision-Making,2020-04-25,"Graph embedding methods are useful for a wide range of graph analysis tasks including link prediction and node classification. Most graph embedding methods learn only the topological structure of graphs. Nevertheless, it has been shown that the incorporation of node attributes is beneficial in improving the expressive power of node embeddings. However, real-world graphs are often noisy in terms of structure and/or attributes (missing and/or erroneous edges/attributes). Most existing graph embedding methods are susceptible to this noise, as they do not consider uncertainty during the modelling process. In this paper, we introduce RASE, a Robust Attribute and Structure preserving graph Embedding model. RASE is a novel graph representation learning model which effectively preserves both graph structure and node attributes through a unified loss function. To be robust, RASE uses a denoising attribute auto-encoder to deal with node attribute noise, and models uncertainty in the embedding space as Gaussians to cope with graph structure noise. We evaluate the performance of RASE through an extensive experimental study on various real-world datasets. Results demonstrate that RASE outperforms state-of-the-art embedding methods on multiple graph analysis tasks and is robust to both structure and attribute noise.","Hettige, Bhagya; Wang, Weiqing; Li, Yuan-Fang; Buntine, Wray",Advances in Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7206273/,177
32423,Nash Stability in a Multi-objective Graph Model with Interval Preference Weights: Application to a US-China Trade Dispute,2020-04-25,"Deep neural network (DNN) models have shown great success in almost every artificial area. It is a non-trivial task to build a good DNN model. Nowadays, various MLaaS providers have launched their cloud services, which trains DNN models for users. Once they are released, driven by potential monetary profit, the models may be duplicated, resold, or redistributed by adversaries, including greedy service providers themselves. To mitigate this threat, in this paper, we propose an innovative framework to protect the intellectual property of deep learning models, that is, watermarking the model by adding a new label to crafted key samples during training. The intuition comes from the fact that, compared with existing DNN watermarking methods, adding a new label will not twist the original decision boundary but can help the model learn the features of key samples better. We implement a prototype of our framework and evaluate the performance under three different benchmark datasets, and investigate the relationship between model accuracy, perturbation strength, and key samples’ length. Extensive experimental results show that, compared with the existing schemes, the proposed method performs better under small perturbation strength or short key samples’ length in terms of classification accuracy and ownership verification efficiency.","Zhong, Qi; Zhang, Leo Yu; Zhang, Jun; Gao, Longxiang; Xiang, Yong",Advances in Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7206275/,177
32428,Medizinische Apps – Möglichkeiten bei Pruritus,2020-05-12,"While graphs capture pairwise relations between entities, hypergraphs deal with higher-order ones, thereby ensuring losslessness. However, in hyperlink (i.e., higher-order link) prediction, where hyperlinks and non-hyperlinks are treated as “positive” and “negative” classes respectively, hypergraphs suffer from the problem of extreme class imbalance. Given this context, “negative sampling”—under-sampling the negative class of non-hyperlinks—becomes mandatory for performing hyperlink prediction. No prior work on hyperlink prediction deals with this problem. In this work, which is the first of its kind, we deal with this problem in the context of hyperlink prediction. More specifically, we leverage graph sampling techniques for sampling non-hyperlinks in hyperlink prediction. Our analysis clearly establishes the effect of random sampling, which is the norm in both link- as well as hyperlink-prediction. Further, we formalize the notion of “hardness” of non-hyperlinks via a measure of density, and analyze its distribution over various negative sampling techniques. We experiment with some real-world hypergraph datasets and provide both qualitative and quantitative results on the effects of negative sampling. We also establish its importance in evaluating hyperlink prediction algorithms.","Patil, Prasanna; Sharma, Govind; Murty, M.

32450,Spectral properties and the accuracy of mean-field approaches for epidemics on correlated power-law networks,2019-10-15,"With the rise of Big Data, there has been a significant effort in increasing compute power through GPUs, TPUs, and heterogeneous architectures. As a result, many applications are memory bound, i.e., they are bottlenecked by the movement of data from main memory to compute units. One way to address this issue is through data prefetching, which relies on accurate prediction of memory accesses. While recent deep learning models have performed well on sequence prediction problems, they are far too heavy in terms of model size and inference latency to be practical for data prefetching. Here, we propose extremely compact LSTM models that can predict the next memory access with high accuracy. Prior LSTM based work on access prediction has used orders of magnitude more parameters and developed one model for each application (trace). While one (specialized) model per application can result in more accuracy, it is not a scalable approach. In contrast, our models can predict for a class of applications by trading off specialization at the cost of few retraining steps at runtime, for a more generalizable compact meta-model. Our experiments on 13 benchmark applications demonstrate that three compact meta-models can obtain accuracy close to specialized models using few batches of retraining for majority of the applications.","Srivastava, Ajitesh; Wang, Ta-Yang; Zhang, Pengmiao; De Rose, Cesar Augusto F.; Kannan, Rajgopal; Prasanna, Viktor K.",Advances in Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7206302/,177

The main objective of the present study was to develop a hybrid decision-making approach with geographic information systems to integrate spatial and non-spatial data to form a weighted result. This study involved three-tier analyses for assessing accessibility and selecting suitable sites for healthcare facilities, and analysing shortest-path network. The first tier of analysis stressed the spatial distance, density and proximity from existing healthcare to find more deprived and inaccessible areas in term of healthcare facilities. The result revealed that spatial discrepancy exists in the study area in term of access to healthcare facilities and for achieving equal healthcare access, it is essential to propose new plans. Thus, require finding suitable sites for put forward new healthcare service, which was highlighted in the second tier of analysis based on land use land cover, distancing to road and rail, proximity to residential areas, and weighted overlay of accessibility as decision factors. Finally, in the third tier of analysis, the most suitable site among the proposed healthcare was identified using the technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution. The road network analysis was also performed in this study to determine the shortest and fastest route from these healthcare facilities to connect with district medical hospital. The present study found some suitable sites throughout the district on inaccessible zones where people are deprived from better healthcare facilities.

However, the optimal duration of PP sessions remains unclear. We searched to evaluate the time required to obtain the maximum physiological effect, and to search for parameters related to patient survival in PP. METHODS AND RESULTS: It was a prospective, monocentric, physiological study. We included in the study all prone-positioned patients in our ICU between June 2016 and January 2018. Pulmonary mechanics, data from volumetric capnography and arterial blood gas were recorded before prone positioning, 2 h after proning, before return to a supine position (SP) and 2 h after return to SP. Dynamic parameters were recorded before proning and every 30 min during the session until 24 h. 103 patients (ARDS 95%) were included performing 231 PP sessions with a mean length of 21.5 ± 5 h per session. They presented a significant increase in pH, static compliance and P(a)O(2)/F(i)O(2) with a significant decrease in P(a)CO(2), P(plat), phase 3 slope of the volumetric capnography, P(et)CO(2), V(D)/V(T-phy) and ΔP. The beneficial physiological effects continued after 16 h of PP and at least up to 24 h in some patients. The evolution of the respiratory parameters during the first session and also during the pooled sessions did not find any predictor of response to PP, whether before, during or 2 h after the return in SP. CONCLUSIONS: PP sessions should be prolonged at least 24 h and be extended in the event that the P(a)O(2)/F(i)O(2) ratio at 24 h remains below 150, especially since no criteria can predict which patient will benefit or not from it.

In people living with HIV (PLWH), monitoring TCR repertoire is challenged by the inconsistency of complementarity determining region 3 (CDR3) and limited cell numbers in clinical samples. Thus, a quantitative method is necessary for monitoring the TCR repertoire in PLWH. We characterized the TCR V-J pairing profile of naïve and memory CD4(+) T cells in healthy donors, HIV-infected antiretroviral therapy (ART)-naïve patients and long-term (over 5 years) ART-experienced patients by performing TCR sequencing. We developed a V-J index with 18 parameters which were subdivided into five categories (expression coverage, cumulative percentage of the top tenth percentile, diversity, intra-individual similarity and inter-individual similarity). In ART-naïve patients, 14 of the 18 parameters were significantly altered. Long-term ART recovered ten parameters. The four unrecovered parameters were related to inter-individual similarity. Therefore, these findings indicate that long-term ART could only partially recover TCR V-J pairs and introduce newly impacted V-J pairs. Moreover, these results provide new insights into the V-J pairing of the TCR and into the disturbance of TCR repertoire in HIV infection.

The evidence for therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) in this setting is promising but inconclusive. Our study aims to evaluate the efficacy of adjunct TPE for septic shock with multiple organ failure compared to standard therapy alone. METHODS: A retrospective, observational chart review was performed, evaluating outcomes of patients with catecholamine-resistant septic shock and multiple organ failure in intensive care units at a tertiary care hospital in Winston-Salem, NC, from August 2015 to March 2019. Adult patients with catecholamine-resistant septic shock (≥ 2 vasopressors) and evidence of multiple organ failure were included. Patients who received adjunct TPE were identified and compared to patients who received standard care alone. A propensity score using age, gender, chronic co-morbidities (HTN, DM, CKD, COPD), APACHE II score, SOFA score, lactate level, and number of vasopressors was used to match patients, resulting in 40 patients in each arm. RESULTS: The mean baseline APACHE II and SOFA scores were 32.5 and 14.3 in TPE patients versus 32.7 and 13.8 in control patients, respectively. The 28-day mortality rate was 40% in the TPE group versus 65% in the standard care group (p = 0.043). Improvements in baseline SOFA scores at 48 h were greater in the TPE group compared to standard care alone (p = 0.001), and patients receiving adjunct TPE had a more favorable fluid balance at 48 h (p = 0.01). Patients receiving adjunct TPE had longer ICU and hospital lengths of stay (p = 0.003 and p = 0.006, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Our retrospective, observational study in adult patients with septic shock and multiple organ failure demonstrated improved 28-day survival with adjunct TPE compared to standard care alone. Hemodynamics, organ dysfunction, and fluid balance all improved with adjunct TPE, while lengths of stay were increased in survivors. The study design does not allow for a generalized statement of support for TPE in all cases of sepsis with multiple organ failure but offers valuable information for a prospective, randomized clinical trial.","Keith, Philip D.; Wells, Adam H.; Hodges, Jeremy; Fast, Stephen H.; Adams, Amber; Scott, L.

38417,Letter to the Journal To Fight a New Coronavirus: Crisis Management and International Cooperation from a Local Perspective in Germany,2020-07-26,"Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) is the main component of green tea, which has been proven to inhibit a variety of viruses, including influenza A virus. However, the mechanism of EGCG against influenza virus remains to be further explored. The mechanism of EGCG against influenza virus was studied. The results showed that EGCG significantly increased the levels of HBD3 mRNA and protein, while the levels of phosphorylation of (p)-p38 MAPK, ERK and JNK after EGCG treatment were significantly up-regulated. p38 MAPK, ERK and JNK inhibitors significantly inhibited the expression of HBD3 induced by EGCG. On the other hand, EGCG significantly inhibited the expression of HA and NP proteins in influenza A virus H1N1, but attenuated the anti-influenza A virus effect of EGCG after silencing HBD3. Thus, the anti-influenza virus effect of EGCG is related to the induction of HBD3 expression. In addition, the expression of EGCG-induced HBD3 is related to the p38 MAPK, ERK and JNK signaling pathways. The research data show that EGCG can induce HBD3 expression through p38 MAPK, ERK and JNK signaling pathway to inhibit the replication of influenza A virus H1N1, providing a new and effective candidate drug for influenza virus.","Mou, Qiuju; Jiang, Yan; Zhu, Lili; Zhu, Zixin; Ren, Tingting",Exp Ther Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7444400/,177

Unlike to asthma, the association between helminthes infection and allergic rhinitis (AR) has been poorly studied. Therefore, we sought to evaluate the association between exposure to Ascaris and Toxocara infections and AR. METHODS: We did an age- and gender-matched case–control study of 81 children with physician-confirmed AR and 101 control subjects in a referral hospital for pediatric diseases in northern Iran. Exposure to Ascaris and Toxocara infections was evaluated by anti-A. lumbricoides- and anti-Toxocara- IgG antibodies using a commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Associations were determined using multivariate logistic regression. RESULTS: Ascaris seropositivity was higher in children with rhinitis than in controls (12.34 vs. 3.96%). Ascaris seropositivity was positively associated with AR in univariate analysis (OR, 3.42; 95% CI 1.03–11.3; P value = 0.035), but this association was not significant after adjustment for potential confounders (OR, 1.85; 95% CI 0.42–8.18). Also Toxocara seropositivity was higher in children with AR than in healthy subjects (3.7% vs. 0.99), indicating non-significant association with AR in both univariate (OR, 3.84; 95% CI 0.39–37.7) and multivariate analyses (OR, 0.8; 95% CI 0.04–15.44). CONCLUSION: Our results revealed that AR is not associated with seropositivity to Ascaris and Toxocara infections in general; however, a higher seropositivity rate was found for both parasites in children with AR. More studies with longitudinal design and larger sample size are needed to elucidate this association.","Mohammadzadeh, Iraj; Darvish, Sorena; Riahi, Seyed Mohammad; Moghaddam, Solmaz Alizadeh; Pournasrollah, Mohammad; Mohammadnia-Afrozi, Mousa; Rostami, Ali",Allergy Asthma Clin Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7477835/,177

However, they can be used under a specific condition only. That is, only when the user knows where the object of interest is. In this paper, we first point out the fact mentioned above by categorizing the tasks that obtain visual information using computer vision techniques. Then, in looking for something as a representative task in a category, we argue suitable camera systems and rotation navigation methods. In the latter, we propose novel voice navigation methods. As a result of a user study comprised of seven people with visual impairment, we found that (1) a camera with a wide field of view such as an omnidirectional camera was preferred, and (2) users have different preferences in navigation methods.","Iwamura, Masakazu; Inoue, Yoshihiko; Minatani, Kazunori; Kise, Koichi",Computers Helping People with Special Needs,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7479805/,177

The integration of AI into various aspects of human life is underway, and the complex ethical concerns emerging from the design, deployment, and use of the technology serves as a reminder that it is time to revisit what future developers and designers, along with professionals, are learning when it comes to AI. It is of paramount importance to train future members of the AI community, and other stakeholders as well, to reflect on the ways in which AI might impact people’s lives and to embrace their responsibilities to enhance its benefits while mitigating its potential harms. This could occur in part through the fuller and more systematic inclusion of AI ethics into the curriculum.

The pandemic has shown subsidiary health effects like, chronic care, mental health, surgeries, and deadlock in the other diseases’ treatment. A digital health platform (PrimaryCare@COVID-19) was implemented to be used by primary care physicians, and nurses, to address both chronic care and COVID-19-related patients at home or traveling. It has been piloted in three Health centers at Lisbon Health Region and it could be scale-up to all primary care in Portugal in the near future. This project was funded by the National Science Foundation to address Primary Care consultations and chronic care services shortage. The clinical primary care processes were studied and a digital workflow was defined using Design Science Research Methods. This project‘s innovative digital platform is already covering several dozens of chronic patients while at home and addressing the communication with COVID-19-related patients. The health professionals (physicians and nurses) are able to safely and rigorously communicate with chronic patients and prescribe the required medicines, as well as inform them about the COVID-19 measures. In case of patients either on quarantine or in isolation this platform also allows for the monitoring and health evaluation. This eHealth Digital Platform is an opportunity to manage chronic care during epidemics, allowing to follow-up patients, preventing them from becoming uncontrolled and having to go to emergency. The digital platform uses smart algorithms to deal with both medication interactions and vital signs alerts while monitoring, chronic and COVID-19 infected, patients, allowing health professionals to remotely consult these patients at home/travelers (by default with phone, but also via digital videoconferencing) and manage all health information about patients in a secure way (and following GDPR rules). KEY MESSAGES: The digital platform uses smart algorithms to deal with both medication interactions and vital signs alerts while monitoring chronic and COVID-19 infected patients. Digital Platform is an opportunity to manage chronic care during epidemics, allowing to follow-up chronic patients, preventing them from becoming uncontrolled and having to go to emergency.","Lapao, L V; Santos, M; Maia, M; Pedrosa, V; Seixas, J; Mira da Silva, M; Correia, J; Heleno, B",Eur J Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7543413/,177
40804,Virtual reality research and development in NTU,2020-10-14,"Covid-19 is a rapidly spreading viral disease that infects not only humans, but animals are also infected because of this disease. The daily life of human beings, their health, and the economy of a country are affected due to this deadly viral disease. Covid-19 is a common spreading disease, and till now, not a single country can prepare a vaccine for COVID-19. A clinical study of COVID-19 infected patients has shown that these types of patients are mostly infected from a lung infection after coming in contact with this disease. Chest x-ray (i.e., radiography) and chest CT are a more effective imaging technique for diagnosing lunge related problems. Still, a substantial chest x-ray is a lower cost process in comparison to chest CT. Deep learning is the most successful technique of machine learning, which provides useful analysis to study a large amount of chest x-ray images that can critically impact on screening of Covid-19. In this work, we have taken the PA view of chest x-ray scans for covid-19 affected patients as well as healthy patients. After cleaning up the images and applying data augmentation, we have used deep learning-based CNN models and compared their performance. We have compared Inception V3, Xception, and ResNeXt models and examined their accuracy. To analyze the model performance, 6432 chest x-ray scans samples have been collected from the Kaggle repository, out of which 5467 were used for training and 965 for validation. In result analysis, the Xception model gives the highest accuracy (i.e., 97.97%) for detecting Chest X-rays images as compared to other models. This work only focuses on possible methods of classifying covid-19 infected patients and does not claim any medical accuracy.","Jain, Rachna; Gupta, Meenu; Taneja, Soham; Hemanth, D.

This review summarizes all the efforts undertaken to develop medical countermeasures in vitro, in vivo, and human clinical trials against Hantavirus infections. RECENT FINDINGS: Multiple antivirals are shown to be effective with limited evidence and recent studies on immunotherapy were not very conclusive. There are multiple vaccine candidates with evidence of conferring long protective immunity against Hantaviruses. Some of these had been already trialed on humans. SUMMARY: At present, severe HPS or HFRS case management is purely based on supportive treatments, often in an intensive care unit.

However, the emergence of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has posed a big challenge to its practice, especially regarding the level of contact with patients. There is a dire need for the exploration of rehabilitation options, other than in-person contacts, to limit the spread of the virus. This article explores telerehabilitation, its outcomes, and the challenges involved in the continuum of care of patients by physiotherapists in the face of the pandemic. BODY: Telerehabilitation is a vital tool which utilizes technology to link practitioners to patients. With its previous history of favorable outcomes for the rehabilitation of certain conditions, telerehabilitation has been widely recommended. However, issues exist on how well it can bridge the gap of physical touch in physiotherapy, its effectiveness in terms of outcomes and satisfaction across various conditions and large population sizes, and finally, its cost and effects, especially in developing countries. CONCLUSION: Telerehabilitation is a necessary adaptation to ensure continued physiotherapy service delivery during the pandemic. However, more quality studies are recommended to evaluate its effectiveness and outcomes. Also, measures to ensure that developing countries are catered for in meeting the rising demands for physiotherapy services using telerehabilitation should be carried out.","Aderonmu, Joseph Ayotunde",Bull Fac Phys Ther,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7725645/,177

Hence, we aimed to evaluate the anxiety, depression, sleep disturbance and fear of COVID-19 among frontline doctors of Bangladesh during the pandemic, and the associated factors for these psychological symptoms. Methods: In total, 370 frontline doctors who were involved in the treatment of suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients during the pandemic took part in an online cross-sectional study. Recruitment was completed using convenience sampling and the data were collected after the start of community transmission of COVID-19 in the country. Anxiety and depression, sleep disturbance, and fear of COVID-19 were assessed by the Patient Health Questionnaire-4, two-item version of the Sleep Condition Indicator, and the Fear of Coronavirus-19 scale, respectively. Socio-demographic information, health service-related information, co-morbidity, and smoking history were collected for evaluating risk factors. The proportion of psychological symptoms were presented using descriptive statistics and the associated factors were identified using multinomial logistic regression analysis. Results: Of the doctors, 36.5% had anxiety, 38.4% had depression, 18.6% had insomnia, and 31.9% had fear of COVID-19. In multinomial logistic regression, inadequate resources in the workplace were found as the single most significant predictor for all psychological outcomes: anxiety and/or depression (severe, OR 3.0, p=0.01; moderate, OR 5.3, p=0.000; mild, OR 2.3, p=0.003), sleep disturbance (moderate, OR 1.9, p=0.02), and fear of COVID-19 (severe, OR 1.9, p=0.03; moderate, OR 1.8, p=0.03). Conclusions: The study demonstrated a high burden of psychological symptoms among frontline doctors of Bangladesh during the COVID-19 pandemic situation. Inadequate resources are contributing to the poor mental health of Bangladeshi doctors. The supply of sufficient resources in workplaces and mental health counseling may help to mitigate the burden of the psychological symptoms identified among the respondents..","Barua, Lingkan; Zaman, Muhammed Shahriar; Omi, Fardina Rahman; Faruque, Mithila",F1000Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7783536/,177
44730,Gender and politics research in Europe: towards a consolidation of a flourishing political science subfield?,2021-01-21,"BACKGROUND: US and European guidelines diverge on whether to vaccinate adults who are not at high risk for cardiovascular events against influenza. Here, we investigated the associations between influenza vaccination and risk for acute myocardial infarction, stroke and pulmonary embolism during the 2009 pandemic in Norway, when vaccination was recommended to all adults. METHODS: Using national registers, we studied all vaccinated Norwegian individuals who suffered AMI, stroke, or pulmonary embolism from May 1, 2009 through September 30, 2010. We defined higher-risk individuals as those using anti-diabetic, anti-obesity, anti-thrombotic, pulmonary or cardiovascular medications (i.e. individuals to whom vaccination was routinely recommended); all other individuals were regarded as having lower-risk. We estimated incidence rate ratios with 95% CI using conditional Poisson regression in the pre-defined risk periods up to 180 days following vaccination compared to an unexposed time-period, with adjustment for season or daily temperature. RESULTS: Overall, we observed lower risk for cardiovascular events following influenza vaccination. When stratified by baseline risk, we observed lower risk across all three outcomes in association with vaccination among higher-risk individuals. In this subgroup, relative risks were 0.72 (0.59–0.88) for AMI, 0.77 (0.59–0.99) for stroke, and 0.73 (0.45–1.19) for pulmonary embolism in the period 1–14 days following vaccination when compared to the background period. These associations remained essentially the same up to 180 days after vaccination. In contrast, the corresponding relative risks among subjects not using medications were 4.19 (2.69–6.52), 1.73 (0.91–3.31) and 2.35 (0.78–7.06). CONCLUSION: In this nationwide study, influenza vaccination was associated with overall cardiovascular benefit. This benefit was concentrated among those at higher cardiovascular risk as defined by medication use. In contrast, our results demonstrate no comparable inverse association with thrombosis-related cardiovascular events following vaccination among those free of cardiovascular medications at baseline. These results may inform the risk–benefit balance for universal influenza vaccination.","Sen, Abhijit; Bakken, Inger Johanne; Govatsmark, Ragna Elise Støre; Varmdal, Torunn; Bønaa, Kaare Harald; Mukamal, Kenneth Jay; Håberg, Siri Eldevik; Janszky, Imre",BMC Cardiovasc Disord,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7803467/,177

Although the physical complaints in the time of COVID-19 are broadly-studied, a paucity of research targeted psychological ones on the precious youth population. This study aimed to describe the real-time state of Egyptian youth’s psychiatric morbidity, dietary changes, and coping methods during this pandemic and explore probable factors influencing them. A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted using an online survey among 447 Egyptian participants aged 14–24 years. Sociodemographic data, dietary habits, and coping methods during COVID-19 were collected. The Arabic versions of the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7), and the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) were used to assess depression, anxiety and insomnia, respectively. RESULTS: Overall, 80.5%, 74.0%, and 73.8% of the participants had different grades of depression, anxiety, and insomnia symptoms. 37.4% gained weight. Emotional and night eating emerged as new habits during the pandemic among 17.9% and 29.3% of the participants, respectively. Each of depression, anxiety, and insomnia was significantly associated with each other, female gender and having a COVID-19 infected relative. Adolescents had significantly higher scores of depression and anxiety. Those with a history of physical illness had significantly higher scores of anxiety and insomnia. Bodyweight and dietary changes were significantly associated with depression, anxiety, and insomnia. Participants reported various positive and negative coping methods. CONCLUSION: Psychiatric morbidity and dietary changes are evident in young people during COVID-19 pandemic. Psychological well-being and dietary habits are important but often overlooked components of youth well-being especially in challenging times. Depression, anxiety, and insomnia were almost always present and dietary changes were significantly associated with the presence of them.","Alamrawy, Roa Gamal; Fadl, Noha; Khaled, Asmaa",Middle East Curr Psychiatry,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7849214/,177
45464,Who are we? The diversity puzzle in European political science,2021-02-05,"In cats, mutations in myosin binding protein C (encoded by the MYBPC3 gene) have been associated with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). However, the molecular mechanisms linking these mutations to HCM remain unknown. Here, we establish Drosophila melanogaster as a model to understand this connection by generating flies harboring MYBPC3 missense mutations (A31P and R820W) associated with feline HCM. The A31P and R820W flies displayed cardiovascular defects in their heart rates and exercise endurance. We used RNA-seq to determine which processes are misregulated in the presence of mutant MYBPC3 alleles. Transcriptome analysis revealed significant downregulation of genes encoding small nucleolar RNA (snoRNAs) in exercised female flies harboring the mutant alleles compared to flies that harbor the wild-type allele. Other processes that were affected included the unfolded protein response and immune/defense responses. These data show that mutant MYBPC3 proteins have widespread effects on the transcriptome of co-regulated genes. Transcriptionally differentially expressed genes are also candidate genes for future evaluation as genetic modifiers of HCM as well as candidate genes for genotype by exercise environment interaction effects on the manifestation of HCM; in cats as well as humans.","Tallo, Christian A; Duncan, Laura H; Yamamoto, Akihiko H; Slaydon, Joshua D; Arya, Gunjan H; Turlapati, Lavanya; Mackay, Trudy F C; Carbone, Mary A",G3 (Bethesda),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7849908/,177

Prior literature shows that, at a European level, there are different ways for people with disabilities to find a job, such as a quota system, sheltered workshops, supported employment, etc. In Spain, sheltered employment centres are prototypes of sheltered workshops aimed at integrating more people with disabilities into the workplace. This research project aims to give visibility to these firms and to gain an understanding of their economic and financial situation. Using the whole sample of sheltered employment centres in Spain, and their financial data from 2004 to 2016, we show which variables explain their viability. Additionally, in light of the imminent worldwide crisis due to the COVID-19 pandemic situation, we want to test the impact of the last economic crisis on the profitability of sheltered employment centres. The main contribution of this study is that the size of these companies, age, financial risk and sales growth, are determining factors for their profitability.

47050,Local Content an Introduction,2020-11-03,"The pandemic novel Coronavirus disease and the resulting lockdowns have contributed to major economic disturbances around the world, forcing organisations to extend the work-from-home (WFH) option to their employees wherever feasible. The current major challenge of this option is maintaining the efficiency and productivity of the employees across the organisations. It is therefore important to understand the impact of this make-shift arrangement of WFH policy and their underlying effects that may affect the efficiency of employees and hence their output levels. This is a distinctive approach to develop a unique framework for efficiency index computation by evaluating the efficiency levels of WFH mode in software organisations using multi-grade fuzzy approach and importance–performance analysis. In turn, this would help to determine the crucial attributes that require improvement to increase the efficiency levels of employees concerned. In this study, a case project has been assessed and it was observed that the efficiency index of WFH accounts to 4.92, which is in between the range of (4.01–6) specified as ‘Efficient’. The framework can be used on a periodic basis to help software organisations to continuously improve their WFH efficiency level.","Suresh, M.; Gopakumar, Kavya",Futur Bus J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7956400/,177

Owing to the poor outcome and high contagiousness of COVID-19, cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) of COVID-19-positive patients is still questionable. MAIN BODY: It is imperative for the healthcare workers to follow the precautions during CPR of suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients. In the present article, we have compiled the resuscitation guidelines subjected to the availability of resources in India/developing nations. CONCLUSION: Compression-only CPR should be initiated whether cardiac arrest is of presumed hypoxic or cardiac etiology. If a patient with an unknown status/suspected/confirmed COVID-19 has out of the hospital cardiac arrest, hands-only CPR could be performed only after covering the mouth and nose of the patient and healthcare worker with the face mask or cloth. During in-hospital cardiac arrest, patients should be shifted to a negative pressure ventilation room, and healthcare worker should wear personal protective equipments.","Jain, Kompal; Chauhan, Rajeev; Bloria, Summit; Sarna, Rashi",Ain-Shams J Anesthesiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7968557/,177

Governments around the world control border product entry to reduce the number of foreign diseases affecting local producers. Evenmore, it is also important to reduce the spread of crop diseases as quickly as possible and in early stages of propagation, to enable farmers to attack them on time, or to remove the affected plants. In this research, we propose the use of convolutional neural networks to detect diseases in horticultural crops. We compare the results of disease classification in images of plant leaves, in terms of performance, time execution, and classifier size. In the analysis, we implement two distinct classifiers, a densenet-161 pre-trained model and a custom created model. We concluded that for disease detection in tomato crops, our custom model has better execution time and size, and the classification performance is acceptable. Therefore, the custom model could be useful to use to create a solution that helps small farmers in rural areas in resource-limited mobile devices.","Brenes, Jose A.; Eger, Markus; Marín-Raventós, Gabriela",Sustainable Intelligent Systems,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7971972/,177

In order to tackle this problem, recently the imaging-based methods have grabbed the attention of many researchers. These methods either extract the features (e.g. using SIFT, or SOSNet) and map the descriptive ones to the camera position and rotation information, or deploy an end-to-end system that directly estimates this information out of RGB images, similar to PoseNet. While the former methods suffer from heavy computational burden during the test process, the latter suffers from lack of accuracy and robustness against environmental changes and object movements. However, end-to-end systems are quite fast during the test and inference and are pretty qualified for real-world applications, even though their training phase could be longer than the former ones. In this paper, a novel multi-modal end-to-end system for large-scale indoor positioning has been proposed, namely APS (Alpha Positioning System), which integrates a Pix2Pix GAN network to reconstruct the point cloud pair of the input query image, with a deep CNN network in order to robustly estimate the position and rotation information of the camera. For this integration, the existing datasets have the shortcoming of paired RGB/point cloud images for indoor environments. Therefore, we created a new dataset to handle this situation. By implementing the proposed APS system, we could achieve a highly accurate camera positioning with a precision level of less than a centimeter.","Ghofrani, Ali; Toroghi, Rahil Mahdian; Tabatabaie, Seyed Mojtaba",Pattern Recognition and Artificial Intelligence,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7972030/,177

Such a model, which is sometimes called logistic growth model related to systems in which the rate of change depends on their previous memory. In the light of this, three advanced numerical and analytical algorithms are presented to obtain approximate solutions for different classes of logistical growth problems, including reproducing kernel algorithm, fractional residual series algorithm and successive substitutions algorithm. The first technique relies on the reproducing property that characterises a specific function of building a complete orthogonal system at desired Hilbert spaces. The RPS technique relies on residual error function and generalised Taylor series to reduce residual errors and generate a converging power series, while the last technique converts the fractional logistic model to Volterra integral equation based on Riemann-Liouville integral operator. To demonstrate consistency with the theoretical framework, some realistic applications are tested to show the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed schemes. Numerical results are displayed in tables and figures for different fractional orders to illustrate the effect of the fractional parameter on population growth behaviour. The results confirm that the proposed schemes are very convenient, effective and do not require long-term calculations.","Hasan, Shatha; Hadid, Samir; Al-Smadi, Mohammed; Abu Arqub, Omar; Momani, Shaher",Computational Mathematics and Applications,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7972124/,177

Design/Methodology/Approach: The work uses a set of general scientific methods within the framework of the system approach, including methods of induction, deduction, analysis and synthesis, modeling of socio-economic systems, as well as graphic representation of research materials. Findings: The change in the model of sustainable development under the influence of the crisis of 2020 is justified. A new - pyramidal model of sustainable development, emerging under the influence of the crisis of 2020, has been developed, in which the directions of sustainable development are more integrated. Originality/Value: It has been proved that the 2020 crisis is not necessarily led to the collapse of a social market economy - a fairly likely scenario is associated with setting humanity on the way to a new model of sustainable development. Its most important features will be, firstly, increasing the importance, prioritizing social and environmental goals and becoming their foundation for the realization of economic goals.

It contributes decisively to the development of local economies of Mediterranean countries and Northern Europe cities. Particularly, marinas (specially designed harbors with moorings for pleasure yachts and small boats) development takes place in coastal areas, which are generally fragile and threatened environments. On one hand marinas are highly desirable for development of recreation and tourism infrastructure, but from the other they are threatened by climate change impacts due to sea level rise. Moreover, marinas are the most complex and highest quality types of port for nautical tourism. They facilitate many nautical tourism activities by providing safe points to access to the water and providing secure locations to store boats. Many marinas also provide additional nautical and ancillary leisure activities and can be visitor attractions in their own right. They also create demand for boating and other tourism products and services and facilitate linkages between nautical and coastal tourism. They have the potential to act as economic hubs for regional development and can catalyze the development of coastal tourism in specific locations. In this perspective, the role of marinas could be reconsidered, transforming them in smart gateway able to push in sustainable way local and regional economy moving the touristic flows from the coastal to the internal areas.","Mundula, Luigi; Ladu, Mara; Balletto, Ginevra; Milesi, Alessandra",Computational Science and Its Applications - ICCSA 2020,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7974247/,177

This data comprises of medical records, genome-omics data, image scan or wearable medico device data that presents immense advantages and challenges at the same time. These ever growing challenges can be surpassed by applying effective artificial intelligence tools. Methods: This paper uses the large volume of multimodal patient data to perform correlations between Body Mass Index, Blood Pressure, Glucose levels, Diabetes Pedigree Function and Skin Thickness of people in different age groups with diabetes. Python and data analytic packages are used to predict diabetes among people. Results: The blood pressure count of diabetic people comes around 75–85 mmHg and sometimes even higher whereas it is in the range of 60–75 mmHg for non-diabetic people. The people with high body mass index and glucose levels of 120–200 mg/dl and more are found to be diabetic as against the lower body mass index with glucose levels of 85–105 mg/dl of normal people. The Diabetes Pedigree Function count of diabetic people has a peak at 0.25 whereas it is 0.125 in case of non-diabetic people. A similar slight difference in values of Age and Skin Thickness has been found for both diabetic and non-diabetic people. Conclusion: Above results indicate a strong relationship between Blood Pressure, BMI and Glucose levels of people with diabetes whereas a moderate correlation has been found between Age, Skin Thickness and Diabetes Pedigree Function count of people with diabetes. Although present analysis attested many of the previous research findings but getting these inferences matched through analytical tools is a sole purpose of this paper.","Wadhwa, Shruti; Babber, Karuna",Computational Science and Its Applications - ICCSA 2020,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7978557/,177

48730,The Road to 5050: Gender Equality and the Irish Film Industry,2020-04-22,"Recent advances in understanding of biological mechanisms and adverse outcome pathways for many exposure-related diseases show that certain common mechanisms involve thresholds and nonlinearities in biological exposure concentration-response (C-R) functions. These range from ultrasensitive molecular switches in signaling pathways, to assembly and activation of inflammasomes, to rupture of lysosomes and pyroptosis of cells. Realistic dose-response modeling and risk analysis must confront the reality of nonlinear C-R functions. This chapter reviews several challenges for traditional statistical regression modeling of C-R functions with thresholds and nonlinearities, together with methods for overcoming them. As mentioned in Chap. 10.1007/978-3-030-57358-4_1, statistically significantly positive exposure-response regression coefficients can arise from many non-causal sources such as model specification errors, incompletely controlled confounding, exposure estimation errors, attribution of interactions to factors, associations among explanatory variables, or coincident historical trends. This chapter discusses and illustrates these sources of positive C-R regression coefficients, explaining why the unadjusted regression coefficients do not necessarily predict how or whether reducing exposure would reduce risk. It discusses statistical options for controlling for such threats, and proposes that causal Bayesian networks and dynamic simulation models can be valuable complements to nonparametric regression modeling for assessing causally interpretable nonlinear C-R functions and understanding how time patterns of exposures affect risk. These approaches are promising for extending the great advances made in statistical C-R modeling methods in recent decades to clarify how to design regulations that are more causally effective in protecting human health.","Cox Jr., Louis Anthony",Quantitative Risk Analysis of Air Pollution Health Effects,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7978615/,177

Ecological studies broadly rely on this principle to explain the functioning of ecosystems. This chapter investigates the links between ecosystem services, human well-being, and migration patterns. Following these trends, it argues that social sciences and international law too should refer to interdependence as a key guiding principle, and that it is sound today to talk of “international interdependence law”.","Sciaccaluga, Giovanni",International Law and the Protection of &#x0201c;Climate Refugees&#x0201d;,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7978703/,177

In addition, we find evidence of negative correlation in the acceleration cycles between China and the US across time, which implies that when the rate of US economic growth begins to slow down, the Chinese economy will be resilient. So when the US sneezes, China will not catch a cold.","Jiang, Yanqing; Dai, Yuwen",Globalization and Sustainable Growth in China,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7979246/,177
49373,Concepts of Threshold Assessment for a First Course in Control Engineering,2020-09-09,"Additive manufacturing is a process of manufacturing that creates a three-dimensional object by progressively depositing thin layers of material guided by a digital drawing. The creation of metallic objects using this technology is one of the fastest growing implementations, although other materials such as concrete, ceramics and polymers are also amenable to this manufacturing process, enabling applications that might not otherwise have been possible. Stainless steels, aluminium, titanium and nickel alloys in the form of powders or wires are melted by heating with a high-energy source such as a laser beam, electron beam or an electric arc. Metal printing is now used in aerospace, consumer products, health care, energy, automotive, marine and other industries because in cases where it has advantages over conventional methods. Here we examine the key processes and principles for printing metallic parts, their unique features, and review how their microstructure and properties develop. There are major challenges that need to be addressed for its continued expansion, requiring imagination and ingenuity to drive the future of metal printing.","DebRoy, T.; Bhadeshia, H. K. D.

49401,"Local Accommodation in Portugal Past, Present and Future Trends",2020-11-20,"The nursing profession has a history of embracing novel technologies that support the delivery of compassionate, person-centred care. The emergence and rapid adoption of ‘intelligent’ technologies that have the ability to act autonomously, but that are often embedded and ‘invisible’ to users, is challenging the nursing profession to reconsider their role in the health system of the future. Using a socio-technical lens the authors examine artificial intelligence and process automation technologies because of their significant potential to become much further embedded into nursing work and disrupt the healthcare system as we know it. Opportunities for nurses to transform their role in the healthcare value chain, will arise from the profession’s proactive reconceptualization of the nursing role in an era where technology is moving from discrete transaction processing and monitoring applications to pervasive computing. But the nurse’s traditional patient and family advocacy role will remain important, as policy, regulatory and ethical challenges arise from the development and use of these emergent digital technologies. The rapidly changing healthcare ecosystem demands nursing involvement in the research, design, adoption and use of emergent digital technologies. The subtle normalization of these technologies into the nursing role will require new nursing knowledge and skills, and different relationships between nurses (i.e., practice, education, research, leadership) and other actors (i.e. patients, physicians, technologies) in the healthcare ecosystem of the future.","Booth, Richard; Strudwick, Gillian; McMurray, Josephine; Chan, Ryan; Cotton, Kendra; Cooke, Samantha",Introduction to Nursing Informatics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7979971/,177

In utero, the lung faces a change of the structure which is rarely seen in any other systems. The very myxoid tissue- and glycogen-rich pseudoglandular phase does not become mature that only in the late infancy and early childhood. Respiratory disease in the newborn is a well-known complication of prematurity, but in the last decade, a large number of entities have been added to the chILD or Children’s Interstitial Lung Disease adding complexity to the adult interstitial lung disease. In fact, youth may develop both pediatric and adult interstitial lung diseases, and pediatricians and pathologists should be aware of the pitfalls in not addressing an adult interstitial lung disease correctly in an adolescent. Some congenital anomalies of the abnormal driven foregut budding of the lung development may also be considered as an essential topic in studying pediatrics and adolescence. This chapter is completed with more than 400 photographs illustrating several lines of abnormal processes that may be present in a developing lung. Similar to non-neoplastic disease, both adult and specific pediatric neoplastic lung diseases need to get attention to avoid the possibility of pitfalls. In the last decade, some case reports of pulmonary carcinoma and malignant mesothelioma of the pleura have been reported in children adding complexity in carcinogenesis of this very complex organ. The molecular genetics has helped to clarify several carcinogenetic pathways not anymore limited to DICER1 gene mutations identified in pleuropulmonary blastoma.","Sergi, Consolato M.",Pathology of Childhood and Adolescence,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7980024/,177

The first action higher institutions made is closing universities, suspending face-to-face classes, and switching to distance education. ICT-based distance education for higher institutions seems suitable to alleviate the COVID-19 outbreak since it does not require face-to-face communication; however, it should be planned carefully to get benefit from its advantages. One of the most challenging issues of distance higher education is choosing the appropriate technology. In this scope, this chapter aims to evaluate ICT-based distance higher education technologies, grouped under five categories: learning management systems, massive open online course platforms, platforms for video conferencing, social media platforms, and digital learning content tools. The evaluation of these technologies showed that although different platforms are used for different purposes, there is a lack of an integrated platform that supports all functionalities from a holistic perspective for improving the efficiency of distance higher education offered and supporting shifting to student-centered distance education model. To this aim, the necessities for the future are also described in this study.","Çaldağ, Murat Tahir; Gökalp, Ebru; Alkış, Nurcan",Emerging Technologies During the Era of COVID-19 Pandemic,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7980150/,177

In this paper, we propose an intelligent Twitter data cleansing model that can solve data quality problems associated with twitter text. This model can correct a wide variety of anomalies from slangs, typos, Elongated (repeated Characters), transposition, Concatenated words, complex spelling mistakes as unorthodox use of acronyms, manifold forms of abbreviations of same words, and word boundary errors. The effects of whole range of tasks of Twitter Data Cleansing Model (TDCM) on the performance of sentiment classification utilizing feature models and three common classifiers have been investigated and evaluated. We conducted our experiments on two sets of pandemics twitter datasets: COVID-19 and Dengue datasets. The primary objective of this paper is to both increase the accuracy and the quality of twitter data and to purify and cleanse twitter data for further analysis. The experiment results seem to indicate that the accuracy of sentiment classification increases once the data quality problems associated with the Twitter text are solved. In COVID-19 twitter dataset, the best performance obtained using Random forest classifier after cleansing the data in terms of accuracy, recall, and f1-score are found to be at 84.7%, 88.5%, and 86.3% respectively. However, the best performance in terms of precision at 84.5% was observed using SVM classifier when compared to that obtained with other classifiers. Further, in the Dengue twitter dataset, the best performance for cleansing data in terms of accuracy, precision and f1-score are observed to be 81.7%, 83.7% and 88.6% respectively using Random forest classifier. The best performance in terms of recall, however, is 94.9% and was obtained using SVM classifier when compared with those obtained with other classifiers.","Murshed, Belal Abdullah Hezam; Mallappa, Suresha; Ghaleb, Osamah A.

Emerging infectious disease outbreak usually causes public health problem. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new emerging coronavirus infection that causes pandemic in 2020. The outbreak affects more than 200 countries around the world, causing illness in more than 11 million of world population. To understand the outbreak, in the depth epidemiological analysis is important. The use of novel information technology for assessment of the outbreak is interesting. The informatics technology is accepted for its advantage in public health. One of the important advantages is the clarification of the public health phenomenon. The IT tool and technique are applicable for study on outbreak of emerging infectious disease. The IT approach can help clarify the pattern of outbreak and can further give important data for disease containment. The IT tool can identify the descriptive details of the outbreak and it can also show the interrelationship between emerging infection to time and place. Additionally, the IT tool can also help further predict the trend or progression of the outbreak. This is a useful application for further public health policies planning for outbreak containment. In this chapter, the authors summarize and discuss on the usefulness and application of IT technology and tool for managing COVID-19. The examples are also given to help readers recognize the IT application for corresponding to COVID-19 outbreak. Using the standard tools, the clarification and prediction for the COVID-19 outbreak can be successfully done. The IT tools are helpful for clinical epidemiological manipulation in public health management against COVID-19. Nevertheless, the use of the IT tool requires good primary data and there might be a problem if the collection technique of primary data from field work is not good.","Wiwanittkit, Viroj; Wayalun, Suphatra",Emerging Technologies During the Era of COVID-19 Pandemic,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7980171/,177

(Of course, neither do many languages, dead or living: Old Norse acts as a case study here for a methodology that could be applied to multiple other instances.) One way, then, to approach a culture’s sense of what for Modern English speakers falls under ‘humour’, is to examine its own vocabulary of terms relating to phenomena like amusement, entertainment, jokes, and so on, and the contexts in which they appear. This allows for a culturally specific mapping of what forms of ‘humour’ were prevalent, appropriate, prized, or otherwise. The chapter offers contextual discussion of Old Norse terms like gaman (amusement), skemmtun (entertainment), leikr (game, play), hlægi (ridicule), glens (jesting), háð (mockery), and others. In doing so it aims to highlight the problems and complexities of translation and interpretation from a linguistic and cultural context in which there are often no easy one-on-one correspondences with Modern English vocabulary and terminology, as well as to show where continuities with Modern English can be found.","Burrows, Hannah","The Palgrave Handbook of Humour, History, and Methodology",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7981036/,177

This is not surprising, as support for the magic wand quickly leads to undecidability, especially when combined with inductive predicates for reasoning about data structures. To circumvent these undecidability results, we propose assigning a more restrictive semantics to the separating conjunction. We argue that the resulting logic, strong-separation logic, can be used for symbolic execution and abductive reasoning just like “standard” separation logic, while remaining decidable even in the presence of both the magic wand and the list-segment predicate—a combination of features that leads to undecidability for the standard semantics.","Pagel, Jens; Zuleger, Florian",Programming Languages and Systems,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7984543/,177

Its detection for further treatment poses a severe threat to researchers, scientists, health professionals, and administrators worldwide. One of the daunting tasks during the pandemic for doctors in radiology is the use of chest X-ray or CT images for COVID-19 diagnosis. Time is required to inspect each report manually. While a CT scan is the better standard, an X-ray is still useful because it is cheaper, faster, and more widely used. To diagnose COVID-19, this paper proposes to use a deep learning-based improved Snapshot Ensemble technique for efficient COVID-19 chest X-ray classification. In addition, the proposed method takes advantage of the transfer learning technique using the ResNet-50 model, which is a pre-trained model. The proposed model uses the publicly accessible COVID-19 chest X-ray dataset consisting of 2905 images, which include COVID-19, viral pneumonia, and normal chest X-ray images. For performance evaluation, the model applied the metrics such as AU-ROC, AU-PR, and Jaccard Index. Furthermore, it also obtained a multi-class micro-average of 97% specificity, 95% f(1)-score, and 95% classification accuracy. The obtained results demonstrate that the performance of the proposed method outperformed those of several existing methods.

Of course, the Greek economy, as a member of the Eurozone, does not have the ability to pursue an independent monetary policy, but an examination of this area helps to draw necessary conclusions. The exit from the fiscal adjustment programs and the long-term supervision of the Greek economy provide larger potential, but at the same time major restrictions on fiscal policy continue to exist. Adversely, the structural policy has a greater capability for implementation. Furthermore, the chapter examines economic policy in the Eurozone until the emergence of Covid-19, while for the post-Covid-19 era, the impact of the pandemic crisis on economic theory and politics is assessed.","Petrakis, Panagiotis E.",The New Political Economy of Greece up to 2030,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7991332/,177

Endoscopy can directly observe the location, size, scope, and color of lesions and obtain pathological results through biopsy, while ligation and other treatments can be performed on polyps and other lesions. Studies have shown that multilayer spiral computed tomography (CT) examination after standardized gastrointestinal preparation and full use of the advantages of various 3D postprocessing reconstruction techniques are of great clinical value in the detection of gastrointestinal diseases, determination of the nature of lesions, localization of lesions, and staging of gastrointestinal malignancies and can make up for the shortcomings of fiberoptic endoscopy, and various 3D postprocessing reconstruction modes have their own advantages and disadvantages. Among them, conventional CT cross-sectional images are the basic images for the diagnosis of various gastric testicular lesions. Axial images, especially thin-layer axial images, can detect the absolute majority of lesions, but there are limitations in observing the anatomical position of lesions, invasion of surrounding tissues, lymph node metastasis, vascularity, and determination of the stage of malignant tumors.","Wang, Huali; Cao, Feng; Yang, Jiaqi; Wu, Yongjuan; Wang, Lin",J Healthc Eng,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7990549/,177

With the help of the related concepts of ecosystem services, this paper establishes an evaluation framework system and adopts the widely used and comprehensive evaluation method of equivalent factors, which is a rapid accounting tool used for the evaluation of ecosystem services. The value of agricultural ecosystem services was estimated from 2008 to 2017 in a typical arid-semiarid region, and nine ecosystem service functions were analyzed. Our research showed that from 2008 to 2017 the value of agricultural ecological services in Gansu Province increased annually, and the annual growth rate in 2012 was the highest (15%). The results showed that the selection of appropriate methods could quickly and effectively evaluate the value of agricultural ecosystem services. In-depth research on the function and value of agroecological services could better promote the sustainable development of agroecosystems and maintain the balance and integrity of ecological service functions. Evaluation of the balance and integrity of agricultural ecosystem ecological service functions in arid semi-arid regions will provide recommendations for land use and sustainable development and ecological environment protection in these regions. HIGHLIGHTS: • Agricultural ecosystem services have changed in an arid and semiarid region of China in recent decades. • We reflect the results of China's ecological progress. • This study provides advice on agricultural development of other developing countries.","Jia, Yi; Liu, Yang; Zhang, Songlin",Environ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8024035/,177
51672,A bi-stage feature selection approach for COVID-19 prediction using chest CT images,2021-04-19,"Deep neural networks (DNNs) have been extensively studied in medical image segmentation. However, existing DNNs often need to train shape models for each object to be segmented, which may yield results that violate cardiac anatomical structure when segmenting cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In this paper, we propose a capsule-based neural network, named Seg-CapNet, to model multiple regions simultaneously within a single training process. The Seg-CapNet model consists of the encoder and the decoder. The encoder transforms the input image into feature vectors that represent objects to be segmented by convolutional layers, capsule layers, and fully-connected layers. And the decoder transforms the feature vectors into segmentation masks by up-sampling. Feature maps of each down-sampling layer in the encoder are connected to the corresponding up-sampling layers, which are conducive to the backpropagation of the model. The output vectors of Seg-CapNet contain low-level image features such as grayscale and texture, as well as semantic features including the position and size of the objects, which is beneficial for improving the segmentation accuracy. The proposed model is validated on the open dataset of the Automated Cardiac Diagnosis Challenge 2017 (ACDC 2017) and the Sunnybrook Cardiac Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) segmentation challenge. Experimental results show that the mean Dice coefficient of Seg-CapNet is increased by 4.7% and the average Hausdorff distance is reduced by 22%. The proposed model also reduces the model parameters and improves the training speed while obtaining the accurate segmentation of multiple regions.

52950,Challenges to competitive manufacturing in high-cost environments: checklist and insights from Swedish manufacturing firms,2021-05-17,"Neurobrucellosis is a chronic complication of human brucellosis that is caused by the presence of Brucella spp in the central nervous system (CNS) and the inflammation play a key role on the pathogenesis. Doxycycline (Dox) is a widely used antibiotic that induces apoptosis of bacteria-infected cells. However, the mechanisms of Brucella inhibition of microglial apoptosis and Dox induction of apoptosis are still poorly understood. In this study, we found that Brucella suis S2 strain (B. suis S2) increased calreticulin (CALR) protein levels and inhbited HMC3 cell apoptosis. Hence, we constructed two HMC3 cell line variants, one with stable overexpression (HMC3-CALR) and one with low expression of CALR (HMC3-sh-CALR). CALR was found to decrease levels of p-JNK and p-p53 proteins, as well as suppress apoptosis in HMC3 cells. These findings suggest that CALR suppresses apoptosis by inhibiting the JNK/p53 signaling pathway. Next, we treated HMC3, HMC3-CALR and HMC3-sh-CALR cell lines with B. suis S2 or Dox. Our results demonstrate that B. suis S2 restrains the JNK/p53 signaling pathway to inhibit HMC3 cell apoptosis via increasing CALR protein expression, while Dox plays the opposite role. Finally, we treated B. suis S2-infected HMC3 cells with Dox. Our results confirm that Dox induces JNK/p53-dependent apoptosis in B. suis S2-infected HMC3 cells through inhibition of CALR protein expression. Taken together, these results reveal that CALR and the JNK/p53 signaling pathway may serve as novel therapeutic targets for treatment of neurobrucellosis.","Wang, Zhao; Wang, Yanbai; Yang, Huan; Guo, Jiayu; Wang, Zhenhai",Front Cell Infect Microbiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8113685/,177
53032,"Environmental Justice and Circular Economy: Analyzing Justice for Waste Pickers in Upcoming Circular Economy in Fortaleza, Brazil",2021-05-19,"The novel coronavirus disease has ravaged many health systems around the world and has brought many economies to their knees. In the absence of an approved curing medicine or approved vaccine to date, the major control of the surge of infections is through use of Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions (NPIs) and imposing specific standard operating procedures (SOPs) in instances when the disease spread curbs are relaxed. It is thus essential to quantify the extent to which specific NPIs can be useful in containing the pandemic. To achieve this, we constructed a mathematical model that accounts for both person to person transmission as well as transmission through contact from pathogen-contaminated surfaces. The model assumes that there is change of behaviour resulting from the surge of the number of cases, hence a class of susceptible individuals who practise self-protection measures. Basic properties of the model including the conditions for existence and stability of steady states are explored. The model was fitted to new-cases data for South Africa and baseline parameter values were estimated. Sensitivity analysis of the model was performed to determine the most influential parameters on the disease threshold. Our results show that practising of self-protection measures is vital in slowing the spread of the infection. In addition, it is evident from the results that minimizing contact through “physical distancing” as well as with contaminated surfaces can significantly help in containing the infection. The model was extended to account for testing and quarantining of both symptomatic and asymptomatic infected individuals. In addition, migration and potential use of a vaccine were explored. In the case of migration, the scenarios considered included aspects when there are both border control and illegal crossings as well as the case where the government is in full control with proper SOPs. Our results show that, although testing and isolating/quarantining of infected individuals is essential in curbing new infections, it ought to be done in conjunction with implementation of other control measures if the disease is to be curtailed in a shorter period of time. More still, when an effective vaccine is available, even a [Formula: see text] coverage in one community may not be enough to completely stop new infections in the presence of migration. We therefore recommend that vaccination ought to be done universally if the daily number of new infections is to be reduced to zero.","Kassa, S. M.; Njagarah, J. B. H.; Terefe, Y.

Therefore, the authorities controlled personal movements and private and public non-essential activities were cancelled. It has probably had an important emotional impact on chronic patients and hence in those who are suffering from Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) due to their high risk of emotional disorders. The aim of this study is to know how COVID 19 influenced to the patients suffering from IBD during the quarantine period, focusing heavily on the psychological distress through the Perceived Stress Scale-10 (PSS-10), and also the impact of the pandemic on therapeutic adherence using Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). METHODS: This is an unicentric and analytical observational study carried out in IBD unit of a large public teaching Hospital (University Hospital “Lozano Blesa”) during August 2020. Patients were contacted and interviewed by phone by two trained researchers not involved in the patient′s medical care. Inclusion criteria were age ≥ 18 years old and confirmed diagnosis of Crohn′s Disease (CD), Ulcerative Colitis (UC) or Indeterminate Colitis. A descriptive analysis was carried out and, subsequently, the factors associated with the loss of therapeutic adherence and higher-moderate levels of stress were analyzed through Logistic regression multivariate analyses. RESULTS: Of the 426 patients included, 217 (50.9%) were women, 249 (58.4%) had UC and 177 (41.6%) had EC. During the Spanish lockdown period, most of patients did not have symptoms related to their IBD (302; 72.1%). Among those who had symptoms, the most frequent was diarrhea and abdominal pain (11.5%). Most of subjects were not diagnosed of SARS-CoV2 infection (93%), whereas 2.1% suffered confirmed infection and 4.9% had compatible symptoms without test confirmation. Regarding economic situation of patients, most of them did not have economic difficulties (87.6%). Moreover, 74.4% of participants referred a very good physician-patient relationship and 21.8% a good relationship. People who participated in the study had a median PSS-10 score of 12 (10–16). A higher level of stress was reported between those who were not married, women, and those who experimented an increase of IBD related symptoms. Adherence to treatment was not associated with stress level based on PSS-10 questionnaire. CONCLUSION: Although the lockdown period due to COVID-19 pandemic has probably had an important emotional impact on Spanish population, IBD patients had in general lower PSS-10 scores. It could be due to a good patient-physician relationship, which contributed to maintaining a good adherence to medications in those patients.","García Mateo, S; Refaie, E; Martínez-Domínguez, S J; Gargallo-Puyuelo, C J; Lario Quilez, L; Carrera-Lasfuentes, P; Arroyo Villarino, M T; Aso Gonzalvo, M C; Gomollón García, F",J Crohns Colitis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8194658/,177

In this study, we examine the public’s understanding of mathematical notions that are required for understanding the pandemic and predicting its spread. We also explore its correlations with several variables: age group and gender, educational attainment in mathematics, and mathematics identity. To do so, we conducted a cross-sectional survey focusing on mathematical knowledge relevant to the pandemic. The survey was distributed to a representative sample of the Jewish Israeli population (n = 439). Findings showed that participants’ educational attainment in mathematics was positively correlated with their success in the mathematical media literacy tasks. However, even those with high attainment levels did not always perform well. Moreover, the explanatory variable with the strongest relationship to mathematical media literacy was found to be participants’ mathematical identity. These results suggest that school mathematics, especially in its high levels, may prepare adults to understand critical information important for their well-being, such as at a time of global pandemic.

For this test, we firstly prepared different sizes (NS1–NS3) of WSe(2) nanosheets (NSs) through the ultrasonication method and characterized their structures using the field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM), Raman spectroscopy, and X-ray powder diffraction. Moreover, we investigated the photovoltaic performance of polymer solar cells based on 5,7-Bis(2-ethylhexyl)benzo[1,2-c:4,5-c′]dithiophene-4,8-dione(PBDB-T):(6,6)-phenyl-C71 butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) with different WSe(2) NSs as the active layer. The fabricated PBDB-T:PCBM active layer with the addition of NS2 WSe(2) NSs (1.5 wt%) exhibited an improved power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 9.2%, which is higher than the pure and NS1 and NS3 WSe(2) blended active layer-encompassing devices. The improved PCE is attributed to the synergic enhancement of exciton dissociation and an improvement in the charge mobility through the modified active layer for polymer solar cells. Furthermore, the highest sensitivity of 2.97 mA/Gy·cm(2) was achieved for the NS2 WSe(2) NSs blended active layer detected by X-ray exposure over the pure polymer, and with the NS1 and NS2 WSe(2) blended active layer.

Among the different SPR-based sensing applications, aptamer-based SPR biosensors have attracted significant attention because of their simplicity, feasibility, and low cost for target detection. Continuous developments in SPR aptasensing research have led to the emergence of abundant technical and design concepts. To understand the recent advances in SPR for biosensing, this paper reviews SPR-based research from the last seven years based on different sensing-type strategies and sub-directions. The characteristics of various SPR-based applications are introduced. We hope that this review will guide the development of SPR aptamer sensors for healthcare.","Chang, Chia-Chen",Biosensors (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8301862/,177

Design is based on and guided by cognitive support findings coming from a long-term collaboration of a team of engineers (University of Zaragoza) and special education teachers (Alborada Special Education School, Zaragoza). The description starts by providing a structure of such findings in five cognitive-social areas (interface usability, virtual representations understanding, time orientation, self-awareness, and social interaction). Design requirements are extracted by applying those findings to four support services (home control, time orientation, behavior contention, and context anticipation). Technological system description follows, together with the degree of implementation and testing for each service. A major result is the benefit of using a services interface with the same structure and appearance as the alternative and augmentative communication system that children are already acquainted with. Based on regulatory conditions, the needed flexibility, and reduced available budgets, this support platform is built on mainstream technology and low-cost single-board computers with standard databases and free software packages. Results show evidence of benefit in children’s cognitive and social performance, in addition to offering a technological tool for deeper educational research.","Guillomía, Miguel A.; Artigas, José Ignacio; Falcó, Jorge L.",Sensors (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8309809/,177

The objective of this study is to understand the role of these economies in international production linkages applying a value-added methodology. Therefore, the study discusses the role of CEE economies in global economy in terms of forms of participation of services, especially ICT services, in GVCs, including the process of “servicification” of manufacturing. This study led to the verification of two hypotheses: (1) the position of manufacturing in GVCs has been steadily weakening and (2) services, especially ICT services, can have a positive effect on participation of CEE economies in GVCs. The first hypothesis was confirmed by most of analysed countries. The other research question turned out not to be true for all CEE countries, but most of them proved this hypothesis.","Cieślik, Ewa",J Knowl Econ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8319713/,177

This paper investigates global poverty dynamics and finds a shift in the world’s poverty gravity center from South Asia to Africa in the period 1990–2015. Sub-Saharan Africa has become the main battlefield for poverty reduction in the world. Global poverty reduction has been accompanied by political instability and local conflicts, economic marginalization, rural decline, and natural hazards as well as climate change which are jointly impacting the least developed areas and making the world’s poverty reduction vulnerable to external shocks. The “STAR” scheme, including maintaining political stability, promoting targeted poverty alleviation, implementing regular assessments of poverty reduction initiatives, and revitalizing rural and poverty-stricken areas, is proposed with specific measures to enhance the resilience capacity of poverty alleviation in the world.","Li, Yuheng; Wu, Wenhao; Wang, Yongsheng",J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8346771/,177
56810,Integration of genetic algorithm with artificial neural network for stock market forecasting,2021-08-17,"BACKGROUND: Although many works have been conducted to explore the biomarkers for diagnosing major depressive disorder (MDD), the widely accepted biomarkers are still not identified. Thus, the combined application of serum metabolomics and fecal microbial communities was used to identify gut microbiota-derived inflammation-related serum metabolites as potential biomarkers for MDD. METHODS: MDD patients and healthy controls (HCs) were included in this study. Both serum samples and fecal samples were collected. The liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS) was used to detect the metabolites in serum samples, and the 16S rRNA gene sequencing was used to analyze the gut microbiota compositions in fecal samples. RESULTS: Totally, 60 MDD patients and 60 HCs were recruited. The 24 differential serum metabolites were identified, and 10 of these were inflammation-related metabolites. Three significantly affected inflammation-related pathways were identified using differential metabolites. The 17 differential genera were identified, and 14 of these genera belonged to phyla Firmicutes. Four significantly affected inflammation-related pathways were identified using differential genera. Five inflammation-related metabolites (LysoPC(16:0), deoxycholic acid, docosahexaenoic acid, taurocholic acid and LysoPC(20:0)) were identified as potential biomarkers. These potential biomarkers had significant correlations with genera belonged to phyla Firmicutes. The panel consisting of these biomarkers could effectively distinguish MDD patients from HCs with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.95 in training set and 0.92 in testing set. CONCLUSION: These findings suggested that the disturbance of phyla Firmicutes might be involved in the onset of depression by regulating host’s inflammatory response, and these potential biomarkers could be useful for future investigating the objective methods for diagnosing MDD.","Bai, Shunjie; Xie, Jing; Bai, Huili; Tian, Tian; Zou, Tao; Chen, Jian-Jun",J Inflamm Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8354734/,177

METHODS: From December 2019 to March 2021,122 GMS high-risk pregnant women who received routine antenatal clinic visits and planned to give birth in our hospital were selected as the research objects. Pregnant women were divided into the GMS group (n = 79) and the control group (n = 43) according to GMS diagnostic criteria during the gestation period of 32–36 weeks. The general information such as age and gestational week of pregnant women as well as HOMA-IR, VAI, and BMI before pregnancy were compared between the two groups. The glucose and lipid metabolism indexes of pregnant women in two groups were analyzed, the detection rates of HOMA-IR, VAI, and prepregnancy BMI in GMS between the two groups were compared. Logistic regression was used to analyze the risk factors for GMS in pregnant women, and receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) was used to analyze the diagnostic value of HOMA-IR, VAI, prepregnancy BMI, and the combination of the three for GMS. RESULTS: The body weight, systolic blood pressure, and diastolic blood pressure of the GMS group were higher than those of the control group, and the differences were statistically significant (P < 0.05). There was no significant difference in age, gestational week, and height between the two groups (P > 0.05). The levels of FPG, FINS, TC, TG, LDL-C, and FFA in the GMS group were higher than the control group, the level of HDL-C in the GMS group was lower than the control group, and the difference was statistically significant (P < 0.05). The levels of HOMA-IR, VAI, and prepregnancy BMI in the GMS group were higher than those in the control group, and the differences were statistically significant (P < 0.05). The positive detection rates of HOMA-IR, VAI, and prepregnancy BMI in the GMS group were 83.54%, 86.07%, and 81.01%, respectively. There was no significant difference in the positive detection rates of HOMA-IR, VAI, and prepregnancy BMI between the two groups (P > 0.05). High levels of HOMA-IR, VAI, and prepregnancy BMI were risk factors for GMS in pregnant women (P < 0.05). ROC curve showed area under the curve for HOMA-IR was 0.810, area under the curve for VAI was 0.771, and area under the curve for prepregnancy BMI was 0.749. The AUC for the combination of HOMA-IR, VAI, and prepregnancy BMI was 0.918. CONCLUSION: HOMA-IR, VAI, and prepregnancy BMI in GMS have a high detection rate and certain diagnostic value, and the combination of the three has higher clinical value.","Zhao, Laiping; Huang, Lichun",Evid Based Complement Alternat Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8486542/,177

61141,Provider-specific quality measurement for ERCP using natural language processing.,2018,"COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The viral genome is considered to be relatively stable and the mutations that have been observed and reported thus far are mainly focused on the coding region. This article provides evidence that macrolevel pandemic dynamics, such as social distancing, modulate the genomic evolution of SARS-CoV-2. This view complements the prevalent paradigm that microlevel observables control macrolevel parameters such as death rates and infection patterns. First, we observe differences in mutational signals for geospatially separated populations such as the prevalence of A23404G in CA versus NY and WA. We show that the feedback between macrolevel dynamics and the viral population can be captured employing a transfer entropy framework. Second, we observe complex interactions within mutational clades. Namely, when C14408T first appeared in the viral population, the frequency of A23404G spiked in the subsequent week. Third, we identify a noncoding mutation, G29540A, within the segment between the coding gene of the N protein and the ORF10 gene, which is largely confined to NY ([Formula: see text]95%). These observations indicate that macrolevel sociobehavioral measures have an impact on the viral genomics and may be useful for the dashboard-like tracking of its evolution. Finally, despite the fact that SARS-CoV-2 is a genetically robust organism, our findings suggest that we are dealing with a high degree of adaptability. Owing to its ample spread, mutations of unusual form are observed and a high complexity of mutational interaction is exhibited.","Barrett, Christopher; Bura, Andrei C; He, Qijun; Huang, Fenix W; Li, Thomas J X; Waterman, Michael S; Reidys, Christian M",Journal of computational biology : a journal of computational molecular cell biology,https://doi.org/10.1089/cmb.2020.0343; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33275493/,177

61586,In the March 2021 Issue of the Quarterly.,2021-03-01,"Tuberculosis causes >1.7 million deaths worldwide each year and is frequently transmitted in hospitals. Outbreaks of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis have led to illness and death among health care workers (HCWs) in many countries. Some countries, such as the United States, implemented occupational health policies that substantially reduced tuberculosis rates among HCWs. Inadequate tuberculosis infection control in China may contribute to its high burden of tuberculosis and multidrug-resistant tuberculosis, which are both the second highest worldwide. Occupational health policies in China for tuberculosis control can be strengthened. We reviewed the development and content of tuberculosis infection control policies in the United States and China. Sources included published academic literature, Chinese Ministry of Health policies, US government agency reports, legal databases, personal observations of hospitals, review of internet discussion sites, and discussions with HCWs and health care and law experts. In the United States, slow acceptance of the tuberculosis problem in HCWs resulted in decades of inaction. Tuberculosis infection control policies, based mostly on expert opinion, were implemented only after tuberculosis resurged in the 1980s. Effective evidence-based policies were developed only after multiple cycles of policy implementation, evaluation and revision. These policies have now substantially reduced occupational tuberculosis. In China, tuberculosis has not been formally recognized as an occupational disease, and data regarding the burden in HCWs are sparse. Vagueness of current labour laws and suboptimal alignment of infection control authority and expertise result in varied and sometimes absent protection of HCWs against tuberculosis. Formal evaluations of occupational tuberculosis policies have not been reported. By collecting data on its current HCW tuberculosis burden and infection control practices, refining policies, continually evaluating its policies based on accumulated evidence and rapidly identifying unsuspected tuberculosis cases, China can develop a more comprehensive strategy to ensure the health of HCWs and reduce transmission of tuberculosis and multidrug-resistant tuberculosis.","Chai, Shua J; Mattingly, Daniel C; Varma, Jay K",Health policy and planning,https://doi.org/10.1093/heapol/czs029; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22427258/,177

Especially radical perineal prostatectomy (RPP) includes some challenges like working in a deep and narrow space and challenging ergonomics for the surgeons. Because of these issues open RPP is still performed in experienced centers. In order to reduce these difficulties, robot- assisted radical perineal prostatectomy (r-RPP) is developed. In this study, we report our first clinical results for r-RPP. Material and methods Between November 2016 and February 2017, 15 patients underwent r-RPP in our center. Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging was performed for all patients to exclude locally advanced disease. The patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and locally advanced prostate cancer were not chosen for r-RPP method. The patient was positioned in the exaggerated lithotomy with 15 degrees of Trendelenburg position. After incision and dissection of subcutaneous tissue, dissection was advanced to the margin of posterior recto-urethral muscle fibers. Then a GelPOINT® device was placed and robotic system was docked. Results The mean age of the patients was 60.2±7.8 years. The mean body mass index of the patients was 28.8±1.9 kg/m2. Four patients had previous major abdominal surgeries. Preoperative mean prostate specific antigen value was 7.3±2.4 ng/mL. The mean prostate volume was 40.8±12.4 cc. Mean perineal dissection time was 60±10.1 minutes. Mean console time and total operation time was 95±11.3 and 167±37.4 minutes, respectively. The mean time of postoperative catheterization was 8.3±1.7 days. Early continence rate was 40% after urethral catheter removal and at 3rd month of the surgery mean continence rate was 94% for all patients. Conclusion We demonstrate that r-RPP is a feasible and efficient method. But still this method needs for further studies in this area.","Tuğcu, Volkan; Akça, Oktay; Şimşek, Abdulmuttalip; Yiğitbaşı, İsmail; Şahin, Selçuk; Taşçı, Ali İhsan",Turkish journal of urology,https://doi.org/10.5152/tud.2017.35488; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29201511/,177

However, in comparison to the host population, these populations are less likely to use mental health services. Digital mental health approaches have been shown to be effective in improving well-being for the general population. Thus, they may provide an effective and culturally appropriate strategy to bridge the treatment gap for these populations vulnerable to mental health risks. OBJECTIVE This paper aims to provide the background and rationale for conducting a scoping review on digital mental health resources for asylum seekers, refugees, and immigrants. It also provides an outline of the methods and analyses, which will be used to answer the following questions. What are the available digital mental health resources for asylum seekers, refugees, and immigrants? Are they effective, feasible, appropriate, and accepted by the population? What are the knowledge gaps in the field? METHODS The scoping review methodology will follow 5 phases: identifying the research question; identifying relevant studies; study selection; charting the data; and collating, summarizing, and reporting the results. Searches will be conducted in the following databases: EBSCOhost databases (CINAHL Plus with Full Text, MEDLINE with Full Text, APA PsycArticles, Psychology and Behavioral Sciences Collection, and APA PsycInfo), PubMed, and Scopus. Additionally, OpenGrey, Mednar, and Eldis will be searched for gray literature. All primary studies and gray literature in English concerning the use of information and communication technology to deliver services addressing mental health issues for asylum seekers, refugees, and immigrants will be included. RESULTS This scoping review will provide an overview of the available digital mental health resources for asylum seekers, refugees, and immigrants and describe the implementation outcomes of feasibility, acceptability, and appropriateness of such approaches for those populations. Potential gaps in the field will also be identified. CONCLUSIONS As of February 2020, there were no scoping reviews, which assessed the effectiveness, feasibility, acceptability, and appropriateness of the available digital mental health resources for asylum seekers, refugees, and immigrants. This review will provide an extensive coverage on a promising and innovative intervention for such populations.

Models reflecting the patient-specific structure were fabricated based on the CT images. Appropriate reusable design, realistic mechanical properties with various material types, and 3D printers (fused deposition modeling (FDM) and PolyJet printers) were used to represent the realistic anatomical structures. As a result, the phantom printed by PolyJet reflected closer mechanical properties than those of the FDM phantom. Accuracies (mean difference ± 95 confidence interval) of phantoms by FDM and PolyJet were 0.53 ± 0.46 and 0.98 ± 0.55 mm, respectively. Phantoms were used by surgeons for VATS training, which is considered more reflective of the clinical situation than the conventional simulation phantom. In conclusion, the patient-specific, realistic, and reusable VATS phantom provides a better understanding the complex anatomical structure of a patient and could be used as an educational phantom for esophageal structure replacement in VATS.","Hong, Dayeong; Kim, HaeKang; Kim, Taehun; Kim, Yong-Hee; Kim, Namkug",Scientific reports,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-85738-w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33737647/,177

Materials and Methods qRT-PCR was employed to determine miR-27a-3p expression in two breast cancer cell lines, MCF-7 and MCF-7/adriamycin-resistant cell line (MCF-7/ADR). The two cell lines were treated with miR-27a-3p mimics or inhibitors or corresponding negative control (NC), respectively. The changes were investigated by qRT-PCR, CCK-8 assay, Western blot (WB), colony formation assay, and flow cytometry assay. Moreover, luciferase reporter assay was analyzed to verify the downstream target gene of miR-27a-3p. Further investigation in the correlation between miR-27a-3p and BTG2 was launched by WB, flow cytometry assay, and CCK-8 assay. The expression of Akt and p-Akt was detected by WB. Key Findings Significantly higher miR-27a-3p expression was confirmed in MCF-7/ADR as compared with sensitive cell line MCF-7 (P<0.05). The down-regulation of miR-27a-3p in MCF-7/ADR enhanced the sensitivity of cancer cells to adriamycin treatment, decreased multidrug resistance gene 1/P-glycoprotein (MDR1/P-gp) expression, enhanced the apoptosis-related proteins expression, increased adriamycin-induced apoptosis, and inhibited cell proliferation as compared to NC groups (P<0.05). The up-regulation of miR-27a-3p in MCF-7 showed the opposite results. BTG2 is identified as a direct target of miR-27a-3p and its down-regulation reversed ADR-resistance. BTG2 treatment exhibited inhibitory effect on PI3K/Akt pathway in MCF-7/ADR cells. Significance miR-27a-3p might be associated with resistance of breast cancer cells to adriamycin treatments, modulating cell proliferation and apoptosis by targeting BTG2 and promoting the PI3K/Akt pathway in breast cancer cells. miR-27a-3p/BTG2 axis might be a potential therapeutic target for clinical BC resistance.","Zhu, Bei; Chen, Weixian; Fu, Yue; Cui, Xiaohan; Jin, Lei; Chao, Jiadeng; Yun, Xiao; Gao, Peng; Shan, Shiting; Li, Jun; Yin, Xu; Zhu, Chunfu; Qin, Xihu",OncoTargets and therapy,https://doi.org/10.2147/ott.s256153; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32764979/,177
64276,Corona virus-related Disease Pandemic: A Review on Machine Learning Approaches and Treatment Trials on Diagnosed Population for Future Clinical Decision Support.,2021-04-13,"BACKGROUND This three-armed randomized clinical trial, with blinding of patients and outcome assessors, tested the hypothesis that single-port (SP) and/or minilaparoscopic (ML) cholecystectomy are superior to conventional laparoscopic (CL) cholecystectomy. METHODS Patients eligible for elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy were randomized to SP, ML or CL procedures. The primary outcome was pain measured on a visual analogue scale twice daily during the blinded period. Secondary outcomes included duration of operation, technical performance score, complications, quality of life, cosmesis and patient satisfaction. Postoperative follow-up lasted 1 year. RESULTS A total of 105 patients were randomized, 35 in each group. One conversion from a SP to a CL technique was necessary in a patient with chronic cholecystitis. Pain intensity was similar in the three groups, both during the blinded period (day 0 to 3; P = 0·865) and over the whole 7-day evaluation period (P = 0·911). The presence of clinically relevant between-group differences was ruled out (95 per cent confidence interval + 1·0 to - 0·5 for difference in pain scores between SP and CL groups, and - 0·8 to + 0·6 between ML and CL groups). Operating time was significantly longer for SP and ML than for CL cholecystectomy (P = 0·001). Postoperative complications included injury to the diaphragm (1), choledocholithiasis (1), wound infection (5) and hernia (1), all after SP cholecystectomy (P = 0·001). Twelve-month follow-up was complete in 99 patients (94·3 per cent). Cosmesis as rated by patients was significantly better at 6 months after SP and ML procedures (P = 0·043), but no difference was observed at 12 months (P = 0·229). CONCLUSION SP and ML cholecystectomy had no advantage over the CL approach in terms of postoperative outcome.

66509,Why human factors science is demonstrably necessary: Historical and evolutionary foundations.,2021-03-29,"UHRF1 is an important epigenetic regulator associated with apoptosis and tumour development. It is a multidomain protein that integrates readout of different histone modification states and DNA methylation with enzymatic histone ubiquitylation activity. Emerging evidence indicates that the chromatin-binding and enzymatic modules of UHRF1 do not act in isolation but interplay in a coordinated and regulated manner. Here, we compared two splicing variants (V1, V2) of murine UHRF1 (mUHRF1) with human UHRF1 (hUHRF1). We show that insertion of nine amino acids in a linker region connecting the different TTD and PHD histone modification-binding domains causes distinct H3K9me3-binding behaviour of mUHRF1 V1. Structural analysis suggests that in mUHRF1 V1, in contrast to V2 and hUHRF1, the linker is anchored in a surface groove of the TTD domain, resulting in creation of a coupled TTD-PHD module. This establishes multivalent, synergistic H3-tail binding causing distinct cellular localization and enhanced H3K9me3-nucleosome ubiquitylation activity. In contrast to hUHRF1, H3K9me3-binding of the murine proteins is not allosterically regulated by phosphatidylinositol 5-phosphate that interacts with a separate less-conserved polybasic linker region of the protein. Our results highlight the importance of flexible linkers in regulating multidomain chromatin binding proteins and point to divergent evolution of their regulation.","Tauber, Maria; Kreuz, Sarah; Lemak, Alexander; Mandal, Papita; Yerkesh, Zhadyra; Veluchamy, Alaguraj; Al-Gashgari, Bothayna; Aljahani, Abrar; Cortés-Medina, Lorena V; Azhibek, Dulat; Fan, Lixin; Ong, Michelle S; Duan, Shili; Houliston, Scott; Arrowsmith, Cheryl H; Fischle, Wolfgang",Nucleic acids research,https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkaa520; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32609811/,177
67681,Evaluation of machine learning algorithms for health and wellness applications: A tutorial.,2021-03-13,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Stent-assisted coiling of intracranial aneurysms requires antiplatelet therapy, typically aspirin and clopidogrel to prevent thromboembolic complications. There is a substantial concern that tirofiban may increase the risk of hemorrhage when used as an antiplatelet premedication in ruptured intracranial aneurysms. Our aim was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of intravenous tirofiban administration, instead of oral dual antiplatelet agents, as an antiplatelet premedication for stent-assisted coiling in patients with acutely ruptured intracranial aneurysms. MATERIALS AND METHODS We conducted a retrospective review of a data base containing a consecutive series of patients who underwent stent-assisted coiling for acutely ruptured intracranial aneurysms between March 2010 and January 2015. Intravenous tirofiban was administered to all patients before stent-assisted coiling, instead of premedication with loading doses of aspirin or clopidogrel. RESULTS Forty patients with 41 aneurysms received intravenous tirofiban and underwent stent-assisted coiling. None of the patients had a newly developed intracerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, or intraventricular hemorrhage. Intraprocedural aneurysmal rupture occurred in 2 patients (5%). Cerebral infarction developed in 2 patients (5%). Ventriculostomy-related hemorrhage was seen in 2 of 10 patients in whom ventriculostomy was performed before or after coiling. Thirty-four (85%) patients had a good outcome (Glasgow Outcome Score of 4 or 5) at the time of discharge, but 1 patient died of cardiac arrest. None of the patients developed thrombocytopenia, retroperitoneal, gastrointestinal, or genitourinary bleeding related to tirofiban administration. CONCLUSIONS In our study, tirofiban showed a low risk of symptomatic hemorrhagic or thromboembolic complications. Tirofiban may offer a safe and effective alternative as an antiplatelet premedication during stent-assisted coiling of acutely ruptured intracranial aneurysms.","Kim, S; Choi, J-H; Kang, M; Cha, J-K; Huh, J-T",AJNR.

70440,Partha Kar: Delivering covid vaccine-a team effort.,2020-11-26,"BACKGROUND The rehabilitation of injured wildlife and their subsequent release into the wild is a humane act as well as important in wildlife conservation. However, little is known about the animals' fate after release. Therefore, to address these uncertainties, it is essential to adequately describe how the injured animals were treated and managed before releasing into the wild; moreover, post-release monitoring should also be performed. Herein, we document for the first time the process of rescue, surgery, and rehabilitation of severely injured Asiatic black bears (Ursus thibetanus; endangered species in South Korea) and their fate after returning to the wild. CASE PRESENTATION A six-year-old female (bear-01) and a three-year-old male (bear-02) bears were injured by an illegal snare and collision with a bus, respectively. Bear-01 had broad muscle necrosis and ruptures from the snared ankle on the right thoracic limb, with myiasis, and elbow disarticulation was performed. In bear-02, a non-reducible comminuted fracture of the left humerus was confirmed radiologically, and the operation was performed by using dual plate fixation with hydroxyapatite and recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein-2. The bear-01 and -02 were completely healed approximately 30 and 60 days after surgery, respectively. After that, they underwent rehabilitation for 8 and 25 days, respectively, in an outdoor enclosure similar to their natural habitat. Bear-01 and -02 were released into the wild after 45 and 99 days after surgery, respectively, and their mean daily movement distance during the first 30 days after releasing was 2.9 ± 2.1 and 1.3 ± 1.6 km, respectively. The annual mean 95% Kernel home-range size of bear-01 and bear-02 was 265.8 and 486.9 km2, respectively. They hibernated every winter, gained weight, gave birth to cubs (bear-01), were not found to have any abnormalities in the veterinary tests, and were not involved in any conflicts with humans after returning to the wild. CONCLUSIONS Bears without one leg or those with dual plates could adapt well in their natural habitat, which shows that our surgical and post-operative treatments were effective. Additionally, minimizing human contact and observing/evaluating behavior during the rehabilitation is essential in reducing human-bear conflicts after release.","Jeong, Dong-Hyuk; Jang, Kwangsik; Yang, Jeong-Jin; Choi, Joo-Yeul; Lim, Seung-Hyo; Yeon, Seong-Chan; Shim, Kyung Mi; Kim, Se Eun; Kang, Seong Soo",BMC veterinary research,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12917-021-02834-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33743672/,177

This lack of progress is remarkable given the critical role ART could play in conserving endangered canid species or eradicating heritable disease through gene-editing technologies-an approach that would also advance the dog as a biomedical model. Over 350 heritable disorders/traits in dogs are homologous with human conditions, almost twice the number of any other species. Here we report the first live births from in vitro fertilized embryos in the dog. Adding to the practical significance, these embryos had also been cryopreserved. Changes in handling of both gametes enabled this progress. The medium previously used to capacitate sperm excluded magnesium because it delayed spontaneous acrosome exocytosis. We found that magnesium significantly enhanced sperm hyperactivation and ability to undergo physiologically-induced acrosome exocytosis, two functions essential to fertilize an egg. Unlike other mammals, dogs ovulate a primary oocyte, which reaches metaphase II on Days 4-5 after the luteinizing hormone (LH) surge. We found that only on Day 6 are oocytes consistently able to be fertilized. In vitro fertilization of Day 6 oocytes with sperm capacitated in medium supplemented with magnesium resulted in high rates of embryo development (78.8%, n = 146). Intra-oviductal transfer of nineteen cryopreserved, in vitro fertilization (IVF)-derived embryos resulted in seven live, healthy puppies. Development of IVF enables modern genetic approaches to be applied more efficiently in dogs, and for gamete rescue to conserve endangered canid species.","Nagashima, Jennifer B; Sylvester, Skylar R; Nelson, Jacquelyn L; Cheong, Soon Hon; Mukai, Chinatsu; Lambo, Colleen; Flanders, James A; Meyers-Wallen, Vicki N; Songsasen, Nucharin; Travis, Alexander J",PloS one,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0143930; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26650234/,177

Shewanella putrefaciens and Shewanella algae are the two species with documented pathogenicity in human beings. Most documented cases of S. algae infection worldwide have been reported in the context of bacteremia, cellulitis, and acute exacerbations of chronic otitis media in predisposed individuals. We report a rare case of necrotizing soft tissue infection by S. algae in an immunocompetent individual. The infection followed exposure to S. algae in contaminated water in New York City, New York.

Case study evidence from Belgium.,2021-05-11,"OBJECTIVES This document presents the fundamentals of speech audiometry in noise, general requirements for implementation and criteria for choice among the tests available in French according to the health-professional's needs. MATERIAL AND METHODS The recommendations are based on a systematic analysis of the literature carried out by a multidisciplinary group of doctors, audiologists and audioprosthetists from all over France. They are graded A, B, C or expert opinion according to decreasing level of scientific evidence. RESULTS Eight tests of speech audiometry in noise can be used in France. CONCLUSION To be complete, evaluation of hearing status requires testing understanding of speech in noise. The examination must begin with a minimum of two measurements familiarizing the subject with the test procedure. For initial diagnosis, adaptive procedures establishing the 50% speech reception threshold (SRT50) in noise are to be preferred in order to obtain a rapid and standardized measurement of perception of speech in noise. When the aim is to measure real-life speech comprehension, tests based on sentences, cocktail-party noise and free-field stimulation are to be preferred. Prosthetic gain is evaluated exclusively in free field. This is the only way to evaluate the contribution of binaurality and to measure perception in noise in an environment as close as possible to real life. In order to avoid acoustic interference in free field, at least five loudspeakers should be used, in particular for evaluating the effectiveness of directional microphones, CROS devices enabling sounds picked up in the damaged ear to be rerouted to the functional ear, or bimodal fitting (i.e., when hearing is enabled by two modalities: for example, hearing aid for one ear, cochlear implant for the other).","Joly, C-A; Reynard, P; Mezzi, K; Bakhos, D; Bergeron, F; Bonnard, D; Borel, S; Bouccara, D; Coez, A; Dejean, F; Del Rio, M; Leclercq, F; Henrion, P; Marx, M; Mom, T; Mosnier, I; Potier, M; Renard, C; Roy, T; Sterkers-Artières, F; Venail, F; Verheyden, P; Veuillet, E; Vincent, C; Thai-Van, H","European annals of otorhinolaryngology, head and neck diseases",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.anorl.2021.05.005; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34140263/,177

Here we evaluated preclinically 4 novel (99m)Tc-labeled small-molecule inhibitors of PSMA with the potential for clinical translation for molecular imaging of prostate cancer in humans. METHODS Four PSMA inhibitors derived from the glutamate-urea-glutamate or glutamate-urea-lysine pharmacophores conjugated to CIM or TIM chelators were radiolabeled with (99m)Tc and evaluated in vitro and in vivo. RESULTS High-affinity, saturable binding to PSMA on LNCaP cells was observed with Kd values of 0.64 ± 0.46 nM for (99m)Tc-MIP-1427, 1.07 ± 0.89 nM for (99m)Tc-MIP-1404, 1.75 ± 0.32 nM for (99m)Tc-MIP-1428, and 4.35 ± 0.35 nM for (99m)Tc-MIP-1405. (99m)Tc-labeled PSMA inhibitors did not bind human prostate cancer PC3 cells, which lack PSMA, demonstrating specificity, and binding was abolished with 2-(phosphonomethyl)pentanedioic acid (PMPA), a structurally unrelated PSMA inhibitor. (99m)Tc-labeled PSMA inhibitors were shown to internalize at 37 °C. Uptake in LNCaP xenografts ranged from 9.3% to 12.4% injected dose per gram at 1 h after injection and from 7.2% to 11.0% at 4 h, with tumor-to-blood ratios ranging from 29:1 to 550:1 and tumor-to-skeletal muscle ratios ranging from 31:1 to 157:1 at 4 h. (99m)Tc-MIP-1404 exhibited the best combination of high tumor uptake and rapid clearance from kidney and nontarget tissues. (99m)Tc-MIP-1404 specifically bound to PSMA in vivo as demonstrated by the absence of uptake in PC3 xenografts and by competition with PMPA. SPECT/CT imaging corroborated the tissue distribution results, demonstrating uptake only in PSMA-expressing kidney and tumor tissue and clearance through the urinary bladder. CONCLUSION These (99m)Tc-labeled radiopharmaceuticals targeting PSMA may provide a SPECT molecular imaging option to assist in the initial diagnosis of prostate cancer and the management of patient care by monitoring disease progression.","Hillier, Shawn M; Maresca, Kevin P; Lu, Genliang; Merkin, Ross D; Marquis, John C; Zimmerman, Craig N; Eckelman, William C; Joyal, John L; Babich, John W","Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine",https://doi.org/10.2967/jnumed.112.116624; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23733925/,177

The primary outcome was measured using the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) at 3 months after AIS, and was based on the mean systolic BP at 24-72 h post-AIS. Favorable outcome was defined as mRS scores of 0-2. A total of 1,540 patients treated with reperfusion therapy were enrolled in the study. Favorable outcomes occurred more frequently in patients with BP ≤ 130/80 mmHg, and the risks of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage and early neurological deterioration were lower in this optimal BP group.

84798,"Challenging Europe: Technology, Environment, and the Quest for Resource Security.",2020,"Early diagnosis of serious bacterial infections (SBI) is important for improving outcome of morbidity and mortality in children. A systematic review was conducted to examine if shivering had any value in diagnosing serious bacterial infection. We split our population (0-18 years old) into two categories depending on the presence of a known malignancy. The databases of Medline, Embase, Cinahl, and Web of Science were searched from inception until July 2019. The quality was assessed with the QUADAS-2 tool. Two by two tables were created, extracting the number of true positive (TP), true negative (TN), false positive (FP), and false negative (FN) regarding shivering and SBI, by 2 authors independently. Sensitivity, specificity, likelihood ratios, and their 95% confidence intervals were calculated using the MetaDATA Shiny app. In a population with known malignancy, we found a +LR of 3.47 (95% CI 2.58-4.36) for a serious bacterial infection when shivering was present, implying an increase of 25-30% possibility for a serious bacterial infection. In children without malignancy, diagnostic accuracy of shivering was poor.Conclusion: Shivering is of limited use to diagnose serious bacterial infection in children without malignancy. Nevertheless, in children with known malignancy, it can be useful as an alarm signal. What is Known: • In the NICE guidelines for febrile illness in children, ""shivering"" is considered as an intermediate risk factor (""amber"" sign) for a serious illness. • A systematic literature search conducted in 2007 investigating the correlation between shivering in a febrile child and the presence of a serious bacterial infection could include only one study. What is New: • Based on the results of this systematic review, shivering has little diagnostic value in children without malignancy but can be useful as an alarm sign of serious bacterial infection in children with known malignancy. • In case of absence of shivering, serious bacterial infection cannot be ruled out.","Vandenberk, Maud; De Bondt, Kasper; Nuyts, Emma; Toelen, Jaan; Verbakel, Jan Y",European journal of pediatrics,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00431-020-03870-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33179117/,177

However, an important challenge for the accomplishment of those efforts is the re-infection of pig units due to the area spread of PRRSv. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of PRRS modified-live virus vaccine (MLV) on viral shedding and on dynamics of PRRSv infection in pig populations raised under commercial conditions. The study composed of two rooms of 1000 pigs each. Ten percent of pigs of each room were inoculated with a field isolate of PRRSv. Rooms had separate air spaces and strict scientifically validated biosecurity protocols were adopted to avoid movement of pathogens between rooms. At 8 and 36 dpi (days post inoculation), all pigs of the challenge-vaccine group were inoculated with a MLV vaccine. Pigs of the challenge-control group were placebo-inoculated. Blood and oral fluid samples were collected from each room at 0, 8, 36, 70, 96 and 118 dpi for PRRSv RNA detection using PCR. PRRSv-antibodies were also screened from blood serum samples with a commercially available ELISA test. Additionally, tonsil scraping samples were collected from both groups at 70, 96 and 118 dpi. Moreover, air samples were collected 6 times per week from 0 to 118 dpi and were tested for PRRSv RNA using qPCR assay. There was no difference in the PRRSv infection dynamics measured as duration and magnitude of viremia and seroconversion. Also, there was no difference in the frequency of tonsil scraping samples PRRSv-positive by PCR. However, the challenge-vaccine group had significantly less PRRSv shed compared to the challenge-control group. The challenge-vaccine group had significant less PRRSv-positive oral fluids at 36 dpi. Moreover, the challenge-vaccine group had significant reduction in the cumulative PRRSv shed in the air.","Linhares, Daniel C L; Cano, Jean Paul; Wetzell, Thomas; Nerem, Joel; Torremorell, Montserrat; Dee, Scott A",Vaccine,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2011.10.075; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22063389/,177

Pharyngeal and rectal swab samples were collected from 98 pilgrims before and after they traveled to the Hajj in 2014 to investigate the acquisition of MDR bacteria. The bacterial diversity in pharyngeal swab samples was assessed by culture with selective media. There was a significantly higher diversity of bacteria in samples collected after the return from the Hajj than in those collected before (P = 0.0008). Surprisingly, Acinetobacter baumannii strains were isolated from 16 pharyngeal swab samples (1 sample taken during the Hajj and 15 samples taken upon return) and 26 post-Hajj rectal swab samples, while none were isolated from samples taken before the Hajj. Testing of all samples by real-time PCR targeting blaOXA-51 gave positive results for only 1% of samples taken during the Hajj, 21/90 (23.3%) pharyngeal swab samples taken post-Hajj, and 35/90 (38.9%) rectal swab samples taken post-Hajj. One strain of A. baumannii isolated from the pharynx was resistant to imipenem and harbored a blaOXA-72 carbapenemase gene. Multilocus sequence typing analysis of 43 A. baumannii isolates revealed a huge diversity of 35 sequence types (STs), among which 18 were novel STs reported for the first time in this study. Moreover, we also found one Escherichia coli isolate, collected from a rectal swab sample from a pilgrim taken after the Hajj, which harbored blaNDM-5, blaCTX-M-15, blaTEM-1, and aadA2 (ST2659 and ST181). In conclusion, pilgrims are at a potential risk of acquiring and transmitting MDR Acinetobacter spp. and carbapenemase-producing Gram-negative bacteria during the Hajj season.","Leangapichart, Thongpan; Gautret, Philippe; Griffiths, Karolina; Belhouchat, Khadidja; Memish, Ziad; Raoult, Didier; Rolain, Jean-Marc",Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy,https://doi.org/10.1128/aac.00669-16; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27458222/,177
86690,Adaptive Feature Selection Guided Deep Forest for COVID-19 Classification with Chest CT.,2020-08-26,"Groundwater is an important resource for supporting domestic water use for people's livelihoods and for maintaining ecosystems. Borehole observations provide the first-hand data that characterise the fluctuation, depth, and aquifer conditions of the groundwater. Unfortunately, such observations are not available or are insufficient for scientific use in many regions. Taking the Lake Victoria Basin (LVB) as an example of data-deficient regions, this study proposes a simple knowledge-based approach that uses the Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) Catchment Land Surface Model (CLSM) for the main data, with rainfall, hydrological, topographical and geological datasets as supports, by which to infer the spatio-temporal variability and storage potential of groundwater. The method is based on analysis and inversion of impact factors on groundwater, and the feasibility of such a method is proven by showing that the groundwater results from GLDAS CLSM can correctly indicate the seasonality, as well as the link to topographical and geological features. For example, both results from the water balance equation (WBE) and GLDAS CLSM indicate that there are two groundwater recharge seasons in the basin, e.g., March to May and September to November. Compared to the eastern side of the LVB, the western side has mountains blocking surface runoff, and thus, reasonably, has larger storage potential estimates in GLDAS CLSM. Due to the low degree of weathering of the basement rocks, it is expected that there is only small storage potential and variation of groundwater in the southeastern parts of the LVB. GLDAS CLSM also correctly reflects this behaviour. Additionally, the largest groundwater storage potential over the LVB is found in regions near the Kagera River and the western shoreline, since it associates with unconsolidated rocks and behaviours of large groundwater recharge from GLDAS CSLM during the wet year of 2006. The major limitation of this knowledge-based method is that the uncertainty in terms of magnitude on GLDAS CLSM groundwater changes cannot be assessed, in addition to the fact that the reliability of the results cannot be quantified in terms of specific numbers. Therefore, the results and interpretation of groundwater behaviours using such methods can only be a guide for 'where' and 'when' to find groundwater.","Hu, K X; Awange, J L; Kuhn, M; Nanteza, J",The Science of the total environment,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.149355; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34399330/,177

88411,Summoning a New Artificial Intelligence Patent Model: In the Age of Pandemic.,2020-06-30,"BACKGROUND Varying definitions of procedural myocardial infarction (PMI) are in widespread use. OBJECTIVES This study sought to determine the rates and clinical relevance of PMI using different definitions in patients with left main coronary artery disease randomized to percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) versus coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery in the EXCEL (Evaluation of XIENCE versus Coronary Artery Bypass Surgery for Effectiveness of Left Main Revascularization) trial. METHODS The pre-specified protocol definition of PMI (PMIProt) required a large elevation of creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB), with identical threshold for both procedures. The Third Universal Definition of MI (types 4a and 5) (PMIUD) required lesser biomarker elevations but with supporting evidence of myocardial ischemia, different after PCI and CABG. For the PMIUD, troponins were used preferentially (available in 49.5% of patients), CK-MB otherwise. The multivariable relationship between each PMI type and 5-year mortality was determined. RESULTS PMIProt occurred in 34 of 935 (3.6%) patients after PCI and 56 of 923 (6.1%) patients after CABG (difference -2.4%; 95% confidence interval [CI]: -4.4% to -0.5%; p = 0.015). The corresponding rates of PMIUD were 37 (4.0%) and 20 (2.2%), respectively (difference 1.8%; 95% CI: 0.2% to 3.4%; p = 0.025). Both PMIProt and PMIUD were associated with 5-year cardiovascular mortality (adjusted hazard ratio [HR]: 2.18 [95% CI: 1.13 to 4.23] and 2.87 [95% CI: 1.44 to 5.73], respectively). PMIProt was associated with a consistent hazard of cardiovascular mortality after both PCI and CABG (pinteraction = 0.86). Conversely, PMIUD was strongly associated with cardiovascular mortality after CABG (adjusted HR: 11.94; 95% CI: 4.84 to 29.47) but not after PCI (adjusted HR: 1.14; 95% CI: 0.35 to 3.67) (pinteraction = 0.004). Results were similar for all-cause mortality and with varying PMIUD biomarker definitions. Only large biomarker elevations (CK-MB ≥10× upper reference limit and troponin ≥70× upper reference limit) were associated with mortality. CONCLUSIONS The rates of PMI after PCI and CABG vary greatly with different definitions. In the EXCEL trial, the pre-specified PMIProt was associated with similar hazard after PCI and CABG, whereas PMIUD was strongly associated with mortality after CABG but not after PCI.

90708,Two decades of pandemic war games failed to account for Donald Trump.,2020-08-01,"Previous studies suggested the suitability of the brackish-water serpulid (Ficopomatus enigmaticus) to be used as model organism for both marine and brackish waters monitoring, by the performance of sperm toxicity and larval development assays. The present study focused on larval development after the exposure of two F. enigmaticus populations (Mediterranean and Atlantic, collected in Italy and Portugal, respectively) to different trace elements (copper, mercury, arsenic, cadmium, and lead) at different concentrations. Results of larval development assays were presented as the percentage of abnormal developed larvae. The effect, measured in terms of EC50 for all toxicants tested, showed that mercury was the most toxic metal for larvae of both populations. Specifically, the tested trace elements may be racked in the following order from the highest to the lowest toxicity: Mediterranean: mercury > copper > lead > arsenic > cadmium; Atlantic: mercury > copper > cadmium > arsenic > lead. Responses of both populations were similar for arsenic. Lead was the least toxic element for the Atlantic population, while cadmium showed the least toxicity for the Mediterranean population. These preliminary results demonstrate the sensitivity and suitability of the organisms to be used in ecotoxicological bioassays and monitoring protocols. Moreover, chemical analyses on soft tissues and calcareous tubes of collected test organisms and their sampling site water were performed, to identify and quantify the concentration of the tested trace elements in these 3 matrices. Populations exhibited less sensitivity to a certain element together with a relevantly higher concentration of the same element in soft tissues. This may indicate a certain resistance to particular contaminant toxic effects by organisms that tend to accumulate the same toxicant. This highlights the potential correlation between wild-caught test organisms' responses and a deep characterization of the sampling site to identify putative abnormalities or differences in model organism response during bioassay execution.","Sanches, Matilde Vieira; Oliva, Matteo; Pires, Adília; De Marchi, Lucia; Cuccaro, Alessia; Freitas, Rosa; Baratti, Mariella; Pretti, Carlo",Ecotoxicology and environmental safety,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoenv.2020.111094; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32818876/,177

Aspirin use is relatively contraindicated during urologic surgery because of increased bleeding risk. We sought to review the outcomes of patients who continued aspirin during robot-assisted radical prostatectomy. PATIENTS AND METHODS Between October 2007 and February 2010, 249 patients underwent robot-assisted radical prostatectomy by a single surgeon. After consultation with the patients' cardiologists, 6 patients had coronary artery stents and continued aspirin perioperatively (Group 1), and 7 patients had coronary artery stents but did not continue aspirin perioperatively (Group 2). The remaining 236 patients had no coronary artery stents and did not require continued aspirin (Group 3). We analyzed our patients' preoperative characteristics, including age, prostate-specific antigen volume, and D'Amico risk, as well as operative time, blood loss, hematocrit changes, transfusion requirements, length of hospital stay, and complications. RESULTS We found no differences in operative time, estimated blood loss, changes in hematocrit, or length of hospital stay. No patients with any type of cardiac stent required a postoperative blood transfusion or had complications requiring more than simple anti-emetics, analgesics, or electrolyte correction. Nine patients in Group 3 required interventions for significant complications.

92317,How much of antibiotics can enter surface water with treated wastewater and how it affects the resistance of waterborne bacteria: a case study of the Białka river sewage treatment plant.,2020-08-15,"AIM We investigated if residual force depression (rFD) is present during voluntary fixed-end contractions of human tibialis anterior (TA) and whether reducing TA's activation level after active shortening could reduce rFD. METHODS Ten participants performed fixed-end dorsiflexion contractions to a low, moderate or high level while electromyography (EMG), dorsiflexion force and TA ultrasound images were recorded. Contractions were force- or EMG-matched and after the low or high contraction level was attained, participants respectively increased or decreased their force/EMG to a moderate level. Participants also performed moderate level contractions while the TA muscle-tendon unit (MTU) was lengthened during the force/EMG rise to the reference MTU length. RESULTS Equivalent fascicle shortening over moderate and low to moderate level contractions did not alter EMG (P = 0.45) or dorsiflexion force (P = 0.47) at the moderate level. Greater initial fascicle shortening magnitudes (1.7 mm; P ≤ 0.01) to the high contraction level did not alter EMG (P = 0.45) or dorsiflexion force (P = 0.30) at the subsequent moderate level compared with moderate level contractions. TA MTU lengthening during the initial force/EMG rise reduced TA fascicle shortening (-2.5 mm; P ≤ 0.01), which reduced EMG (-3.9% MVC; P < 0.01) and increased dorsiflexion force (3.7% MVC; P < 0.01) at the moderate level compared with fixed-end moderate level contractions. CONCLUSION rFD is present during fixed-end dorsiflexion contractions because fascicles actively shorten as force/EMG increases and rFD can be reduced by reducing the effective MTU compliance. A reduction in muscle activation level also reduces rFD by potentially triggering residual force enhancement-related mechanisms as force drops and some fascicles actively lengthen.","Raiteri, Brent J; Hahn, Daniel",Acta physiologica,https://doi.org/10.1111/apha.13198; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30300958/,177

Because effective methods to prevent or treat norovirus have not been discovered, it is important to rapidly recognize and report norovirus outbreaks in the early phase. Internet search has been a useful method for people to access information immediately. With the precise record of internet search trends, internet search has been a useful tool to manifest infectious disease outbreaks. OBJECTIVE In this study, we tried to discover the correlation between internet search terms and norovirus infection. METHODS The internet search trend data of norovirus were obtained from Google Trends. We used cross-correlation analysis to discover the temporal correlation between norovirus and other terms. We also used multiple linear regression with the stepwise method to recognize the most important predictors of internet search trends and norovirus. In addition, we evaluated the temporal correlation between actual norovirus cases and internet search terms in New York, California, and the United States as a whole. RESULTS Some Google search terms such as gastroenteritis, watery diarrhea, and stomach bug coincided with norovirus Google Trends. Some Google search terms such as contagious, travel, and party presented earlier than norovirus Google Trends. Some Google search terms such as dehydration, bar, and coronavirus presented several months later than norovirus Google Trends. We found that fever, gastroenteritis, poison, cruise, wedding, and watery diarrhea were important factors correlated with norovirus Google Trends.

The purpose of our investigation was to compare the effect of RYGB, vertical sleeve gastrectomy (VSG), and duodenal switch (DS) on insulin and glucose response to carbohydrate challenge. METHODS Patients meeting National Institutes of Health criteria for bariatric surgery selected their bariatric procedure after evaluation and education in this prospective nonrandomized study. Preoperatively and at 6, 9, and 12 months' follow-up, patients underwent blood draw to determine levels of fasting glucose, fasting insulin, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), C-peptide, and 2-h oral glucose challenge test. Homoeostatic Model Assessment (HOMA)-IR, fasting to 1-h and 1- to 2-h ratios of glucose and insulin, were calculated. Statistical analysis was performed using ANOVA and Student's paired t test. All procedures were performed via a laparoscopic technique at a single institution. RESULTS Data from a total of 38 patients (13 RYGB, 12 VSG, 13 DS) were available for analysis. At baseline, all groups were similar; the only statistically significant difference was that DS patients had a higher preoperative weight and body mass index (BMI). All operations caused weight loss (BMI 47.7 ± 10-30.7 ± 6.4 kg/m(2) in RYGB; 45.7 ± 8.5-31.1 ± 5.5 kg/m(2) in VSG; 55.9 ± 11.4-27.5 ± 5.6 kg/m(2) in DS), reduction of fasting glucose, and improved insulin sensitivity. RYGB patients had a rapid rise in glucose with an accompanying rise in 1-h insulin to a level that exceeded preoperative levels. This was followed by a rapid decrease in glucose level. In comparison, DS patients had a lower increase in glucose and 1-h insulin, and the lowest HbA1c. These differences were statistically significant at various data points. For VSG, the results were intermediary. CONCLUSIONS Compared to gastric bypass, DS results in greater weight loss and improves insulin sensitivity and glucose homeostasis without causing a hyperinsulinemic response. Because the response to challenge after VSG is intermediary, pyloric preservation alone cannot account for this difference.","Roslin, Mitchell S; Dudiy, Yuriy; Brownlee, Andrew; Weiskopf, Joanne; Shah, Paresh",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-013-3176-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24018763/,177

METHODS Consecutive patients admitted to Tübingen University Stroke Unit, Germany, with acute ischemic stroke (AIS), who underwent standard care (between August and December 2017) and patients who additionally received prophylactic melatonin (2 mg per day at night) within 24 hours of symptom onset (between August and December 2018) were included. Primary outcomes were: (i) PSD prevalence in AIS patients, (ii) PSD risk and PSD-free survival in patients with cerebral infarction who underwent melatonin supplementation compared to propensity-score-matched (PSM) controls. Secondary outcomes included time of PSD-onset and PSD-duration. RESULTS Out of 465 (81.2%) with cerebral infarction and 108 (18.8%) TIA patients, 152 (26.5%) developed PSD (median time-to-onset [IQR]: 16 [8,32] hours; duration 24 [8,40] hours). Higher age, cerebral infarction (rather than TIA), higher NIHSS and aphasia on admission were significant predictors of PSD. After PSM (164 melatonin-treated patients with cerebral infarction versus 164 matched-controls), 42 (25.6%) melatonin-treated patients developed PSD vs. 60 (36.6%) controls (OR [95% CI]: 0.597 [0.372-0.958], p=.032). PSD-free survival differed significantly between groups (p=.027), favoring melatonin-treated patients. In patients with PSD, no between-group differences in the time of PSD-onset and PSD-duration were noted. CONCLUSIONS Patients prophylactically treated with melatonin within 24 hours of AIS onset had lower risk for PSD than patients undergoing standard care. Prospective randomized trials are warranted to corroborate these findings.","Mengel, Annerose; Zurloh, Jan; Boßelmann, Christian; Brendel, Bettina; Stadler, Vera; Sartor-Pfeiffer, Jennifer; Meisel, Andreas; Fleischmann, Robert; Ziemann, Ulf; Poli, Sven; Stefanou, Maria-Ioanna",European journal of neurology,https://doi.org/10.1111/ene.14792; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33657679/,177

98287,Nanotechnology Responses to COVID-19.,2020-09-03,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a major cause of morbidity, mortality and expenditure of resources. When followed, guidelines for CAP management have been demonstrated to improve clinical outcomes; however, several issues are still open. This review summarizes the recent advances in this field and the priority needs for future research. RECENT FINDINGS Recently identified clinical and biochemical tools promise to improve the assessment of CAP severity; however, definition of the most accurate and feasible rule(s) for clinical practice is now necessary. Some empirical antimicrobial regimens are still being debated, such as the need for atypical pathogen coverage in home-treated and nonsevere hospitalized patients and the inclusion of respiratory fluoroquinolones among first-choice molecules. New drugs such as tigecycline and cethromycin appear promising. Pharmacokinetically enhanced amoxicillin/clavulanate is highly effective, even for treating CAP caused by multiple-drug-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae. Other aspects recently clarified include the inappropriateness of rigid time-to-first-antibiotic-dose rules, the advantages of shorter antibiotic treatments for nonsevere patients and the need of special clinical attention for acute myocardial infarction among patients with severe CAP or clinical failure. SUMMARY Recent developments have significantly contributed to refine the management of CAP patients. However, various hot topics remain undefined as yet and urgently require ad-hoc research in order to optimize the outcomes and the costs of this highly social-impacting disease.","Carbonara, Sergio; Monno, Laura; Longo, Benedetta; Angarano, Gioacchino",Current opinion in pulmonary medicine,https://doi.org/10.1097/mcp.0b013e3283287c3f; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19387263/,177

METHODS Two open-ended questions were posed to 1,174 MyVoice youth, aged 14-24 years, on March 20, 2020, regarding their needs and coping strategies during COVID-19. Qualitative responses were coded using thematic analysis and data were summarized with descriptive statistics. RESULTS The average age of the 950 respondents (RR = 80.9%) was 18.9 ± 2.8 years with 52.1% female and 63.8% white. While 32.6% of participants felt resources were readily available, 35.2% felt resources were difficult to access or unavailable. Participants also described both emotional responses (27.4%) and coping strategies (69.8%). Most emotional responses were negative, including symptoms of anxiety or depression. Commonly reported coping strategies included staying connected and maintaining positivity. CONCLUSIONS A significant portion of U.S. youth are experiencing unmet needs and negative emotions due to COVID-19 suggesting additional youth outreach is necessary to ensure basic needs, including socialization, are met.","Waselewski, Eric A; Waselewski, Marika E; Chang, Tammy",The Journal of adolescent health : official publication of the Society for Adolescent Medicine,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jadohealth.2020.07.043; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32933836/,177

In some cases, device scalability is crucial, as seen in fields like resistance metrology, where graphene devices are required to accommodate currents of the order 100 μA to be compatible with existing infrastructure. However, fabrication of these devices still poses many difficulties. In this work, unusual quantized resistances are observed in epitaxial graphene Corbino p-n junction devices held at the ν = 2 plateau (R H ≈ 12906 Ω) and agree with numerical simulations performed with the LTspice circuit simulator. The formulae describing experimental and simulated data are empirically derived for generalized placement of up to three current terminals and accurately reflects observed partial edge channel cancellation. These results support the use of ultraviolet lithography as a way to scale up graphene-based devices with suitably narrow junctions that could be applied in a variety of subfields.","Liu, Chieh-I; Scaletta, Dominick S; Patel, Dinesh K; Kruskopf, Mattias; Levy, Antonio; Hill, Heather M; Rigosi, Albert F",Journal of physics D: Applied physics,https://doi.org/10.1088/1361-6463/ab83bb; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32831402/,177

100948,"Weighing the Costs of Disaster: Consequences, Risks, and Resilience in Individuals, Families, and Communities.",2010,"AIM To review the clinical use and the effectiveness of tamoxifen in patients with advanced or recurrent ovarian cancer. METHODS A retrospective review of clinical records was conducted in patients who received tamoxifen for the treatment of ovarian cancer between 2002 and 2016. We reviewed the clinical setting that it was given, duration of use, patients' tolerability, clinical benefit and progression-free survival. We also attempted to identify predictive markers for response. RESULTS A total of 92 patients received tamoxifen during this 15-year period. The patients received a median of 2.5 lines of chemotherapy before switching to tamoxifen, and they remained on tamoxifen for a median of 5.6 months (range 0-85 months), with 24 patients receiving it for more than 12 months. Seventy-six patients continued on tamoxifen for more than 2 months. In this group, 75 patients had an evaluable response, either by CA 125 or clinically and clinical benefit rate (defined as complete, partial response and static disease) was seen in 42 patients (56%), with majority of patients having static disease. The median progression-free survival was 5.3 months (95% confidence interval, 2.6-8.1). Tamoxifen was well tolerated. Hormone receptor status was not demonstrated to predict response. CONCLUSION Patients with advanced ovarian cancer who have failed previous lines of chemotherapy may achieve static disease with tamoxifen with minimal side effects. Tamoxifen may still have a role in the era of molecular target therapy.","Chan, Karen Kar Loen; Ngu, Siew Fei; Chu, Mandy Man Yee; Tse, Ka Yu; Ngan, Hextan Yuen Sheung",Asia-Pacific journal of clinical oncology,https://doi.org/10.1111/ajco.13478; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33079469/,177
102999,The role of hydrogen in heavy transport to operate within planetary boundaries.,2021-09-14,"BACKGROUND Effective methods for postoperative pain relief are an important concern in outpatient surgery. For arthroscopies we combine a single-shot peripheral nerve block using low-volume, low-concentration ropivacaine with general anesthesia. We hypothesized that the patients would have less postoperative pain and be more rapidly home ready than after general anesthesia alone. METHODS Patients (American Society of Anesthesiologists I-III, 18-80 years old) scheduled for outpatient arthroscopy on the upper or lower extremity were randomized to have either a combination of peripheral nerve block and general anesthesia (NB + GA, study group) or general anesthesia alone (GA, control group). The relevant nerve was localized by ultrasound and 10 mL ropivacaine 0.2% was injected. General anesthesia was with propofol and remifentanil. Numeric rating scales were used to assess pain and patient satisfaction in the recovery room, on the evening of surgery, and on the following 2 days. RESULTS A total of 120 patients participated in the study (NB + GA: 61; GA: 59). The percentage of patients reporting relevant pain in the recovery room were 0% versus 44% (P < 0.001), on the evening after surgery 3% versus 80% (P < 0.001), and on days 1 and 2 postsurgery 12% versus 73% and 12% versus 64% (NB + GA vs GA, respectively). Median time to home discharge was NB + GA 34.5 min (range 15-90) versus GA 55 min (20-115) (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS The combination of a peripheral nerve block with low-dose ropivacaine and general anesthesia reduced postoperative pain compared with general anesthesia alone for several days after outpatient arthroscopy. It also shortened the time to home discharge.","Büttner, Benedikt; Mansur, Ashham; Hinz, José; Erlenwein, Joachim; Bauer, Martin; Bergmann, Ingo",Medicine,https://doi.org/10.1097/md.0000000000006046; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28178149/,177

In this sample (n = 95) of psychiatric trainees in the Baltic countries, the majority were female (79.1%), training in adult psychiatry (77.9%). A vast majority (87.0%) of psychiatric trainees in the Baltic countries have 'ever' considered leaving the country; almost half (in Estonia) or more than a half (in Lithuania and Latvia) were considering leaving 'now'; yet a minority took 'practical steps' towards migration. For all trainees in the Baltic states, personal reasons were the most important to stay in their country. Whilst regarding reasons to leave, financial was top in Lithuania, while trainees from Estonia and Latvia indicated personal reasons as key to emigrate. Several psychiatric trainees in the Baltic countries had considered migration, with many calling for improvements in their salaries.

METHODS After the defect in the abdominal wall, thirty Wistar rats were placed in three groups (ten animals each) for intraperitoneal mesh implant: polypropylene group, polypropylene/polyglecaprone group, and polyester/porcine collagen group. The macroscopic evaluation of the extent and intensity of adhesions was performed 21 days after the implant. RESULTS The polypropylene group had a higher statistically significant impairment due to visceral adhesions (p value = 0.002) and a higher degree of intense adherence in relation to polypropylene/polyglecaprone and polyester/porcine collagen groups (p value<0.001). The polyester/porcine collagen group showed more intense adhesions than the polypropylene/polyglecaprone group (p value=0.035). CONCLUSIONS The intraperitoneal implantation of polypropylene meshes to correct defects of the abdominal wall caused the appearance of extensive and firm adhesions to intra-abdominal structures. The use of polypropylene/polyglecaprone or polyester/porcine collagen tissue-separating meshes reduces the number and degree of adhesions formed.","Ribeiro, Waston Gonçalves; Rodrigues, Diego Vinnicyus Santos; Atta, Francisco Felipe Moreira; Ramos, Izabelle Smith Frazão; Frazão, Fabiola Nassar Sousa; Torres, Orlando Jorge Martins; Pitombo, Marcos Bettini",Acta cirurgica brasileira,https://doi.org/10.1590/s0102-865020190060000003; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31432994/,177

Meanwhile, we utilized an integrated Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatography-Electrospray Ionization-Tandem Mass Spectrometry (UPLC-ESI-MS/MS) to analysis of the response of the metabolome in goji fruit to phosphorus level. The results show that the yield of goji fruits had strongly negative correlation with phosphorus level, especially in the third harvest time. The amino acids, flavonoids, polysaccharides, and betaine contents of goji fruits in the first harvest time had obvious correlated with the level of phosphorus level.

114709,How the coronavirus pandemic is changing virtual science communication.,2020-07-09,"Paramyxovirus V proteins are known antagonists of the RIG-I-like receptor (RLR)-mediated interferon induction pathway, interacting with and inhibiting the RLR MDA5. We report interactions between the Nipah virus V protein and both RIG-I regulatory protein TRIM25 and RIG-I. We also observed interactions between these host proteins and the V proteins of measles virus, Sendai virus, and parainfluenza virus. These interactions are mediated by the conserved C-terminal domain of the V protein, which binds to the tandem caspase activation and recruitment domains (CARDs) of RIG-I (the region of TRIM25 ubiquitination) and to the SPRY domain of TRIM25, which mediates TRIM25 interaction with the RIG-I CARDs. Furthermore, we show that V interaction with TRIM25 and RIG-I prevents TRIM25-mediated ubiquitination of RIG-I and disrupts downstream RIG-I signaling to the mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein. This is a novel mechanism for innate immune inhibition by paramyxovirus V proteins, distinct from other known V protein functions such as MDA5 and STAT1 antagonism.IMPORTANCE The host RIG-I signaling pathway is a key early obstacle to paramyxovirus infection, as it results in rapid induction of an antiviral response. This study shows that paramyxovirus V proteins interact with and inhibit the activation of RIG-I, thereby interrupting the antiviral signaling pathway and facilitating virus replication.","Sánchez-Aparicio, Maria T; Feinman, Leighland J; García-Sastre, Adolfo; Shaw, Megan L",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.01960-17; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29321315/,177

Auditory electrophysiological assessments have gained interest as possible tools for early diagnosis of AD. This paper outlines the protocol that will be used to systematically review the published literature currently available on auditory electrophysiological assessments that have been used to assess the auditory functions of adults over the age of 60 years diagnosed with AD or its preclinical stages. METHODS AND ANALYSIS All full-length peer-reviewed publications of original data that use auditory electrophysiological assessments in AD and its preclinical stages (subjective cognitive decline (SCD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI)) will be considered in this review. The search will be performed on major electronic databases (Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, PsycINFO, PubMed, Scopus and CINAHL Plus) using keywords alone or in combination with Medical Subject Headings divided into two domains; (i) auditory tests and (ii) AD. The database search will be conducted on the 7th of May 2019. Data analysis will be completed and reported in the full review. A random effects meta-analysis will also be conducted using the Comprehensive Meta-Analysis software, V.3. This review will describe which auditory electrophysiological tests have been found to be useful in assessing the auditory function in cognitively impaired adults (MCI and AD) or adults with serious complaints about their cognition (SCD). This review will also identify and describe which auditory electrophysiological test demonstrates the most sensitivity in differentiating people at different stages of cognitive decline. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION This systematic review focusses on analysing already available literature. Therefore, there will be no requirement for ethical approval. The systematic review findings will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publication as well as relevant media platforms, for example, conferences.

METHODS The authors searched 10 databases (from the start of each through September 21, 2016) using keywords related to burnout, medical education, and prevention. Teams of two authors independently reviewed the search results to select peer-reviewed, English language articles describing educational interventions to prevent and/or reduce burnout among medical students and/or residents that were evaluated using validated burnout measures. They assessed study quality using the Medical Education Research Study Quality Instrument and the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool. RESULTS Fourteen studies met inclusion criteria and all used the Maslach Burnout Inventory as at least one measure of burnout. Four were single group pre-post studies, 6 non-randomized two-group studies, and 4 randomized controlled trials. None of the studies were designed specifically to target burnout prevention. In 12 studies, residents were the targeted learners. Six of the 14 studies reported statistically significant changes in burnout scores: 5 reported improvement and 1 reported worsening of burnout. Of the 5 studies that reported statistically significant benefit, 1 studied a complementary and alternative medicine elective, 1 studied the Respiratory One Meditation method, and 3 studied duty hour changes.

However, it remains unclear, how these results should be interpreted. We aimed to analyze whether on-treatment HCV RNA levels predict relapse comparing the CobasAmpliPrep/CobasTaqMan v2.0 (CAP/CTM) and Abbott RealTime HCV (ART) assays. METHODS Samples were collected from 298 patients (HCV genotypes; GT1-5) at weeks (w) 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20 and 24 during SOF-based therapy at two university clinics and tested for HCV RNA level by CAP/CTM and ART. Patients were treated with SOF/ribavirin (RBV) 12/24 w (n=99), pegylated-interferon-alfa (PegIFN)/SOF/RBV 12 w (n=51), SOF/simeprevir (SMV)±RBV 12 w (n=69) or SOF/daclatasvir±RBV 12/24 w (n=79). RESULTS HCV RNA levels during the first 4weeks of SOF/RBV therapy were significantly lower in GT3 patients who achieved SVR compared with those who relapsed. All GT3 patients with a week 2 result <45IU/ml by CAP/CTM achieved SVR but only 33% of those with ⩾45IU/ml (p=0.0003). Similar results were documented with ART and 60IU/ml as cut-off (SVR: 100% vs. 29%; p=0.0002). In contrast, HCV RNA levels during early treatment phases were not significantly related to relapse in patients treated with other SOF-based regimens. Residual HCV RNA was frequently detected by ART at later stages of therapy. However, SVR rates remained high in these patients. At the end of SOF/SMV±RBV therapy HCV RNA was detectable with ART in 20% of patients, of whom 92% achieved SVR. CONCLUSIONS HCV RNA levels assessed at week 2 of SOF/RBV therapy can predict relapse in GT3-patients. Detectable HCV RNA results at later stages during SOF-based therapy may occur frequently with the more sensitive ART. However, this should not lead to treatment extension. LAY SUMMARY We analyzed the predictive value of hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA levels measured at different time points for treatment efficacy. We found that the level of HCV RNA measured at week 2 of antiviral therapy can be used to predict treatment success in patients with HCV genotype 3 infection treated with sofosbuvir and ribavirin but not in patients treated with other sofosbuvir-based regimens. Low level HCV RNA is frequently detected by the RealTime HCV assay during later stages of antiviral therapy. However, this is not associated with reoccurrence of HCV RNA after the end of treatment.","Maasoumy, Benjamin; Vermehren, Johannes; Welker, Martin-Walter; Bremer, Birgit; Perner, Dany; Höner Zu Siederdissen, Christoph; Deterding, Katja; Lehmann, Patrick; Cloherty, Gavin; Reinhardt, Birgit; Pawlotsky, Jean-Michel; Manns, Michael P; Zeuzem, Stefan; Cornberg, Markus; Wedemeyer, Heiner; Sarrazin, Christoph",Journal of hepatology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhep.2016.04.006; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27085252/,177

Interventional procedures have evolved in number, type and setting and have arguably been optimized as a direct consequence of this pandemic; a result that will undoubtedly lead to radical change within the specialty. This paper explores the future of interventional radiology from various perspectives, and forecasts the new opportunities that will be presented, from the adaptation of the interventional radiology staff and angiography suite, to the immunological environment, and through to digital medical education.

124395,Fear of Ebola: The Influence of Collectivism on Xenophobic Threat Responses.,2016,"Introduction: When evaluating the public health value of adult pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) for pneumonia, regulatory agencies and vaccine technical committees (VTCs) emphasize vaccine serotype (VT), radiologically confirmed community acquired pneumonia (CAP) to the exclusion of clinically defined pneumonia and thus may underestimate PCV's public health value. Areas covered: We review the critiques that have been raised to using clinically defined pneumonia to complement VT-CAP in evaluating the public health value of adult PCVs. Expert opinion: PCV13 efficacies for preventing hospitalized CAP ranged from 6-11% and for a combination of primary and secondary care from 4-12%, with relatively high associated rate reductions. These efficacy values are larger than estimated from multiplying PCV13 efficacy against vaccine-type CAP by the proportion of CAP identified as vaccine-type through tests such as a serotype-specific urinary antigen detection assay. Current understanding of pneumococcal epidemiology and limitations of diagnostic tests suggest these values are plausible and potentially generalizable. Regulatory agencies and VTCs have accepted clinically defined outcomes for assessing pediatric vaccines and - while additional studies assessing adult clinical CAP VE are needed - they might consider existing data when evaluating adult PCV use.","Gessner, Bradford D; Isturiz, Raul; Snow, Vincenza; Grant, Lindsay R; Theilacker, Christian; Jodar, Luis",Expert review of vaccines,https://doi.org/10.1080/14760584.2021.1889376; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33602035/,177
124975,GTH 2021: simply online … worth experiencing.,2020-12-01,"Objectives Heart transplantation has become an established procedure in India with increasing numbers being done annually. The majority of these patients are very sick with a history of multiple hospital admissions. The economic burden of such therapy is substantial and the costs are borne by the patients with very little insurance coverage. The objective of this study was to estimate the following:The average cost of a heart transplant procedure in a ""real-world setting"" in a private healthcare facility in India, with varying patient risk profiles.Identify the factors contributing to the wide variations in cost seen in practice.Finally, based on data thus collected, can some kind of estimation be made about the expected cost in a given patient before the operation is done? Methods The cost incurred by the hospital in doing 168 heart transplants during a 3-year period was analyzed. Costs were divided into direct and indirect costs. The direct costs consisted of medical consumables, laboratory investigations, radiology, costs involved in organ harvest and transport, and diet. Direct cost was 40 % of the total cost of the procedure and was used as a surrogate for total costing estimates. Results There was a wide variation in direct costs almost tenfold, ranging from INR 240,882 to 2403193 with a mean of 603755.The cost was affected by length of stay in the hospital, whether a patient survived or died and whether the patient died within 7 days of surgery or later. It was also affected by patient-specific factors like the INTERMACS status and preoperative creatinine levels. The average cost of the entire transplant procedure was INR 1459000. Conclusion There is a wide variation in the cost incurred by the hospital in doing transplants dictated to a large extent by patient risk profiles. A ""One package fits all model"" is unrealistic. The data pertains to the cost to the hospital and not the hospital bill and is therefore relevant to any health care facility, public or private. This study provides a framework for Governmental and private insurance agencies to fix the reimbursement rates.","Balakrishnan, Komarakshi; Nageswaran, Coimbatore","Indian journal of thoracic and cardiovascular surgery : official organ, Association of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgeons of India",https://doi.org/10.1007/s12055-020-00996-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33061205/,177

However, no randomized data assessing the safety and efficacy of CS versus general anesthesia (GA) are available. Methods: SOLVE-TAVI is a multicenter, open-label, 2x2 factorial, randomized trial of 447 patients with aortic stenosis undergoing transfemoral TAVR comparing CS versus GA. The primary efficacy endpoint was powered for equivalence (equivalence margin 10% with significance level 0.05) and consisted of the composite of all-cause mortality, stroke, myocardial infarction, infection requiring antibiotic treatment, and acute kidney injury at 30 days. Results: The primary composite endpoint occurred in 27.2% of CS and 26.4% of GA patients (rate difference 0.8 [90%CI -6.2 to 7.8]; Pequivalence=0.015). Event rates for the individual components were as follows: all-cause mortality 3.2% versus 2.3% (rate difference 1.0 [90%CI - 2.9 to 4.8]; Pequivalence<0.001), stroke 2.4% versus 2.8% (rate difference -0.4 [90%CI -3.8 to 3.8]; Pequivalence<0.001), myocardial infarction 0.5% versus 0.0% (rate difference 0.5 [90%CI -3.0 to 3.9]; Pequivalence<0.001), infection requiring antibiotics 21.1% versus 22.0% (rate difference -0.9 [90%CI -7.5 to 5.7]; Pequivalence=0.011), acute kidney injury 9.0% versus 9.2% (rate difference - 0.2 [90%CI -5.2 to 4.8]; Pequivalence=0.0005). There was a lower need for inotropes or vasopressors with CS (62.8%) versus GA (97.3%) (rate difference -34.4 [90%CI -41.0 to -27.8]). Conclusions: Among patients with aortic stenosis undergoing transfemoral TAVR, use of CS compared with GA resulted in similar outcomes for the primary efficacy endpoint. These findings suggest that CS can be safely applied for TAVR.

We conducted a national study to estimate influenza vaccine coverage across 12 ethnic groups in Canada to assess the presence of ethnic disparities. METHODS We pooled responses to the Canadian Community Health Survey between 2003 and 2009 (n = 437 488). We estimated ethnicity-specific self-reported influenza vaccine coverage for the overall population, for people aged 65 years and older, and for people aged 12-64 years with and without chronic conditions. We used weighted logistic regression models to examine the association between ethnicity and influenza vaccination, adjusting for sociodemographic factors and health status. RESULTS Influenza vaccination coverage ranged from 25% to 41% across ethnic groups. After adjusting for sociodemographic factors and health status for people aged 12 years and older, all ethnic groups were more likely to have received a vaccination against influenza than people who self-identified as white, with the exception of those who self-identified as black (odds ratio [OR] 1.01, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.88-1.15). Compared with white Canadians, Canadians of Filipino (OR 2.00, 95% CI 1.67-2.40) and Southeast Asian (OR 1.66, 95% CI 1.36-2.03) descent had the greatest likelihood of having received vaccination against influenza. INTERPRETATION Influenza vaccine coverage in Canada varies by ethnicity. Black and white Canadians have the lowest uptake of influenza vaccine of the ethnic groups represented in our study. Further research is needed to understand the facilitators, barriers and misconceptions relating to vaccination that exist across ethnic groups, and to identify promotional strategies that may improve uptake among black and white Canadians.","Quach, Susan; Hamid, Jemila S; Pereira, Jennifer A; Heidebrecht, Christine L; Deeks, Shelley L; Crowcroft, Natasha S; Quan, Sherman D; Brien, Stephanie; Kwong, Jeffrey C",CMAJ : Canadian Medical Association journal = journal de l'Association medicale canadienne,https://doi.org/10.1503/cmaj.111628; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22966054/,177

METHOD An analysis was conducted to assess the US government's response to this growing threat. Human and animal health legislation from 2011-2019 was reviewed using the congressional legislative database where 28 pieces of antimicrobial distinct legislation was identified. RESULTS The majority of the bills identified were human health related and common themes found were incentivizing the development of new products, biodefense, expanded scope of use, and stewardship. Much fewer were identified pertaining to animal health; of those identified, common themes included stricter veterinary oversight, barriers to approval pathways for new products, and stewardship. CONCLUSION The public health impact of these legislative efforts is in part related to a broader political tension of the role of government versus local authorities in managing regulatory enforcement and guidelines.","McClelland, Sarah; Lamoureux, Bralen; Larson, Elaine",American journal of infection control,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajic.2020.12.019; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33417969/,177

In the present study, we first established that hypoxia increases the steady-state hyperaemic response at low workloads during calf exercise. To study dynamic aspects of this response, eight subjects performed eight exercise trials while breathing a normoxic (fractional inspired O(2) = 0.2094) or hypoxic gas mixture (fractional inspired O(2) = 0.105). Subjects performed intermittent contractions (1 s) of the calf muscle at 20% maximal voluntary contraction, and the leg blood flow (LBF), leg vascular conductance (LVC) and EMG activities of the triceps surae muscles were measured during each contraction-relaxation period (3 s). The LBF and LVC responses were averaged for each subject and fitted using a four-phase, exponential growth and decay function. Hypoxia evoked significant increases in the change in LBF (15%) and LVC (23%) from the start to the end of exercise, as well as the amplitude of the rapid growth phase of LBF and LVC (21%). Similar, but non-significant, effects on the amplitude of the slow growth phase of LBF (P = 0.08) and LVC (P = 0.10) were observed. By contrast, hypoxia had no effect on temporal parameters of these growth phases, parameters defining the decay phases or EMG activities. These results suggest that the effect of hypoxia on exercise hyperaemia is targeted at the rapid and perhaps the slow growth phase of the response, and is not mediated by a change in the level of muscle activation.","Donnelly, J; Green, S",Experimental physiology,https://doi.org/10.1113/expphysiol.2012.066258; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22689444/,177

Recently, some case series have also documented its success in the treatment of fecal incontinence. Nevertheless, the mechanism underlying this effect remains unknown but may be related to changes in rectal capacity. The aim of this study was to investigate the success of pTNS for the treatment of fecal urge incontinence and assess the influence of rectal capacity on treatment efficacy. METHODS All patients undergoing pTNS for fecal incontinence between July 2009 and March 2014 were enrolled in a prospective, observational study consisting of a therapeutic regimen that lasted 9 months. Therapy success was defined as a reduction in the CCI (Cleveland Clinic incontinence) score of ≥50% and patient-reported success. Furthermore, quality of life (Rockwood's scale) and changes in anorectal physiology were recorded. RESULTS Fifty-seven patients with fecal urge incontinence were eligible, nine of whom were excluded. The success rate was 72.5%. Incontinence events and urge symptoms were significantly reduced after 3 months and at the end of therapy. The median CCI score decreased from 12 to 4 (P < 0.0001), and the quality of life was significantly improved. However, rectal capacity was not significantly related to treatment success before or after therapy. No adverse events were observed. CONCLUSIONS These results demonstrate that pTNS can improve the symptoms and quality of life of patients with fecal urge incontinence. However, the study fails to demonstrate a correlation between treatment success and changes in rectal capacity.","Marti, Lukas; Galata, Christian; Beutner, Ulrich; Hetzer, Franc; Pipitone, Nicoletta; Wolff, Katja; Borovicka, Jan; Brunner, Walter; Sulz, Michael Christian; Maurus, Christine",International journal of colorectal disease,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00384-017-2804-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28391449/,177

The aim of this study was to predict the frequency of vaccine refusal against domestic and foreign COVID-19 vaccines and identify the factors underlying refusal. METHODS A survey consisting of 16 questions about COVID-19 vaccination was conducted either face-to-face or online with 428 parents who agreed to participate in the study. The parents had children who were inpatients or outpatients in the Children's Hospital of Ankara City Hospital. In the survey, parents were asked about family sociodemographic characteristics, opinions on domestic and foreign COVID-19 vaccines, and reasons for vaccine refusal. RESULTS While 66.1% of parents were reluctant to receive foreign COVID-19 vaccines, only 37.4% were reluctant to receive domestic COVID-19 vaccines. The participants' preference for the domestic vaccine was significantly higher for themselves and their children (P < 0.05). Women were less likely to be willing to receive foreign vaccines than men (P < 0.05). As the education level increased, fewer parents preferred the domestic vaccine for themselves (P = 0.046) and their children (P = 0.005). Both domestic and foreign vaccine acceptability for parents and their children was higher among parents with high anxiety levels regarding COVID-19 infection (P < 0.05). The most common reasons for refusal were anxiety about vaccine side effects, lack of knowledge about the effectiveness of vaccines, and distrust of vaccines originating from abroad. CONCLUSION Most of the participants were hesitant about COVID-19 vaccines. This study demonstrates that vaccine uptake can be increased by considering the higher preference for domestic vaccines.","Yigit, Metin; Ozkaya-Parlakay, Aslinur; Senel, Emrah",The Pediatric infectious disease journal,https://doi.org/10.1097/inf.0000000000003042; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33410650/,177

Angiotensin II (AT-II) reduces Qpv, but its effect on HABR is not known. We explored interactions of AT-II and enalapril with hepatic blood flow regulation. Twenty healthy anesthetized pigs were randomized to receive AT-II (n = 8) from 5 to 61 ng/kg per min, enalapril (n = 8) from 3 to 24 μg/kg per h, or saline (n = 4). HABR was assessed by occluding portal vein and expressed as 1) ratio between changes in Qha and Qpv, 2) hepatic arterial conductance (Cha). AT-II infusion increased mean arterial blood pressure from 74 (66-77) mmHg to 116 (109-130) mmHg (median, IQR; P < 0.0001) and decreased cardiac output, Qpv, and renal artery flow (-24%, -28% and -45%, respectively). The fraction of cardiac output of Qha, carotid, and femoral flows increased. With enalapril, blood pressure decreased, whereas cardiac output was maintained with flow redistribution favoring hepatic and renal arteries. In AT-II group, dQha/dQpv increased from 0.06 (0.03, 0.17) to 0.24 (0.13, 0.31) (P = 0.002), but Cha during acute portal vein occlusion decreased from 4.3 (1.6, 6.6) to 2.9 (1.2, 3.7) ml/mmHg (P = 0.003). Both variables remained unchanged in the enalapril group and in controls. AT-II infusion reduces portal flow in parallel with cardiac output and induces a dose-dependent redistribution of flow, favoring brain, hepatic artery, and peripheral tissues at the expense of renal perfusion. During HABR, AT-II decreases Cha but increases Qha compensation, likely as result of increased hepatic arterial perfusion pressure. Enalapril had no effect on HABR.","Pereira, Adriano J; Jeger, Victor; Fahrner, René; Djafarzadeh, Siamak; Lensch, Michael; Takala, Jukka; Jakob, Stephan M",American journal of physiology.

The immune mechanisms that potentially orchestrate the pathology in SARS-CoV-2 infection are complex and only partially understood. There is still paucity of data on the features of myeloid cells involved in this viral infection. For this reason, we investigated the different activation status profile and the subsets distribution of myeloid cells as well as their correlation with disease progression in 40 COVID-19 patients at different stages of disease. COVID-19 patients showed a decrease in the absolute number of plasmacytoid and myeloid dendritic cells, different subsets distribution of monocytes and different activation patterns of both monocytes and neutrophils, coupled to a significant reduction of HLA-DR monocyte levels. We found that some of these alterations are typical of all COVID-19 patients, while some others vary at different stages of the disease and correlate to biochemical parameters of inflammation.

Their common root in autoimmunity stimulates interest in the exploration of similarities and differences between the two diseases. Genetic susceptibility is relevant, creating a substrate, on which environmental factors act as a trigger of an aberrant immune response. Despite being both T-cell mediated disorders with a strong involvement of the humoral arm, immunomodulation is a mainstay of MS management, whereas hormone replacement therapy remains the principal approach for T1D.

136194,Genomics-Guided Contact Tracing: Tool for the Future or for Today?,2020-10-01,"Ischemia is one of the most common causes of acquired brain injury. Central to its noxious sequelae are spreading depolarizations (SDs), waves of persistent depolarizations which start at the location of the flow obstruction and expand outwards leading to excitotoxic damage. The majority of acute stage of stroke studies to date have focused on the phenomenology of SDs and their association with brain damage. In the current work, we investigated the role of peri-injection zone pyramidal neurons in triggering SDs by optogenetic stimulation in an endothelin-1 rat model of focal ischemia. Our concurrent two photon fluorescence microscopy data and local field potential recordings indicated that a ≥ 60% drop in cortical arteriolar red blood cell velocity was associated with SDs at the ET-1 injection site. SDs were also observed in the peri-injection zone, which subsequently exhibited elevated neuronal activity in the low-frequency bands. Critically, SDs were triggered by low- but not high-frequency optogenetic stimulation of peri-injection zone pyramidal neurons. Our findings depict a complex etiology of SDs post focal ischemia and reveal that effects of neuronal modulation exhibit spectral and spatial selectivity.","Bazzigaluppi, Paolo; Mester, James; Joo, Illsung L; Weisspapir, Iliya; Dorr, Adrienne; Koletar, Margaret M; Beckett, Tina L; Khosravani, Houman; Carlen, Peter; Stefanovic, Bojana",Journal of cerebral blood flow and metabolism : official journal of the International Society of Cerebral Blood Flow and Metabolism,https://doi.org/10.1177/0271678x211013656; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33969731/,177
139801,A prospective clinical trial evaluating changes in the wound microenvironment in patients with chronic venous leg ulcers treated with a hypothermically stored amniotic membrane.,2021-05-06,"INTRODUCTION Surveillance of recent HIV infections in national testing services has the potential to inform primary prevention programming activities. Focusing on procedures required to accurately determine recent infection, and the potential for recent infection surveillance to inform prevention efforts, we present the results of three independent but linked pilots of recency testing. METHODS To distinguish recently acquired HIV infection from long-standing infection, in 2018 we applied a Recent Infection Testing Algorithm that combined a laboratory-based Limiting Antigen Avidity Enzyme Immunoassay with clinical information (viral-load; history of prior HIV diagnosis; antiretroviral therapy-exposure). We explored potential misclassification of test results and analysed the characteristics of participants with recent infection. We applied the algorithm in antenatal clinics providing prevention of mother-to-child transmission services in Siaya County, Kenya, outreach sites serving female sex workers in Zimbabwe, and routine HIV testing and counselling facilities in Nairobi, Kenya. In Nairobi, we also conducted recency testing among partners of HIV-positive participants. RESULTS In Siaya County, 2.3% (10/426) of HIV-positive pregnant women were classified as recent. A risk factor analysis comparing women testing recent with those testing HIV-negative found women in their first trimester were significantly more likely to test recent than those in their second or third trimester. In Zimbabwe, 10.5% (33/313) of female sex workers testing HIV-positive through the outreach programme were classified recent. A risk factor analysis of women testing recent versus those testing HIV-negative, found no strong evidence of an association with recent infection. In Nairobi, among 532 HIV-positive women and men, 8.6% (46) were classified recent. Among partners of participants, almost a quarter of those who tested HIV-positive were classified as recent (23.8%; 5/21). In all three settings, the inclusion of clinical information helped improve the positive predictive value of recent infection testing by removing cases that were likely misclassified. CONCLUSIONS We successfully identified recently acquired infections among persons testing HIV-positive in routine testing settings and highlight the importance of incorporating additional information to accurately classify recent infection. We identified a number of groups with a significantly higher proportion of recent infection, suggesting recent infection surveillance, when rolled-out nationally, may help in further targeting primary prevention efforts.","Rice, Brian D; de Wit, Mariken; Welty, Susie; Risher, Kathryn; Cowan, Frances M; Murphy, Gary; Chabata, Sungai T; Waruiru, Wanjiru; Magutshwa, Sitholubuhle; Motoku, John; Kwaro, Daniel; Ochieng, Benard; Reniers, Georges; Rutherford, George",Journal of the International AIDS Society,https://doi.org/10.1002/jia2.25513; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32602625/,177

METHODS This two-year, prospective study included 34 patients who underwent major head and neck cancer surgery at a university hospital. The LigaSure Precise handpiece and LigaSure 8 vessel sealing system were utilised as the primary means of haemostasis, except when sealing vessels larger than 7 mm in diameter. Surgical outcomes were evaluated. In addition, in each patient the diameter of the largest vein and artery sealed (all were >2 mm) was measured before sealing. RESULTS In all cases except one (33/34 patients), a sutureless technique was performed. Post-operative bleeding was observed in two cases. Thirty veins and 22 arteries were measured. The mean diameter of the largest sealed vein was 3.8 mm, while that of the largest sealed artery was 2.7 mm. CONCLUSION Our experience indicates that the surgical technique described is safe and effective. The main advantages of the LigaSure system are that it simplifies the procedure and eliminates the need for clips and suture ligations.","Fakhry, N; Michel, J; Santini, L; Lagier, A; Turner, F; Dessi, P; Giovanni, A",The Journal of laryngology and otology,https://doi.org/10.1017/s0022215112001168; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22697050/,177

Prevalence and seasonal distribution of viral etiology of respiratory tract infections in inpatients and outpatients of the pediatric population: 10 year follow-up. Turk J Pediatr 2018; 60: 642-652. The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence and seasonal distribution of respiratory viruses in pediatric patients. Nasopharyngeal swab specimens, demographic and clinical information were collected from 1240 pediatric patients aged < 18 years between 2006 and 2015 in Hacettepe University Children`s Hospital. Multiplex RT-PCR (multiplex reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction) was performed to detect viral pathogens. A total of 1240 pediatric outpatients and inpatients who had been admitted to the hospital with symptoms of upper and lower respiratory tract infections (RTIs) were enrolled. Viruses were identified in 339 (27.3%) of cases, with the leading three viruses being respiratory syncytial virus (RSV, 74/339; 21.8%), human rhinovirus (62/339; 18.3%), and multiple viruses (56/339; 16.5%). Most of the patients were diagnosed with lower RTI (264/339; 77.8%) and antibiotics were administered to three quarters of positive patients (254/339; 74.9%). With an overall viral agent detection rate of 27.3%, the findings of the present study suggest that other respiratory pathogens, whether viral or bacterial, may also lead to hospital visits due to respiratory tract symptoms in children.","Aykaç, Kübra; Karadağ-Öncel, Eda; Bayhan, Cihangül; Tanır-Başaranoğlu, Sevgen; Akın, Mustafa Şenol; Özsürekci, Yasemin; Alp, Alpaslan; Cengiz, Ali Bülent; Kara, Ateş; Ceyhan, Mehmet",The Turkish journal of pediatrics,https://doi.org/10.24953/turkjped.2018.06.004; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31365200/,177

Using a difference-in-differences strategy, we compare pre-post FFCRA changes in newly reported COVID-19 cases in states where workers gained the right to take paid sick leave (treatment group) to states where workers already had access to paid sick leave (control group). We adjust for differences in testing, day-of-the-week reporting, structural state differences, general virus dynamics, and policies such as stay-at-home orders (SHO). Compared to the control group and relative to the pre-FFCRA period, states that gained access to paid sick leave through FFCRA saw a statistically significant 400 fewer confirmed cases per day. This estimate translates into roughly 1 prevented COVID-19 case per day, per 1300 workers who newly gained the option to take up to two weeks of paid sick leave.

Methods: The retrospective observational study method was used. From February 2016 to April 2019, a total of 21 patients (21 fingers) with fingertip and pulp wounds of the thumbs were admitted to the Second Hospital of Tangshan, including 13 males and 8 females, aged 21 to 65 years. There were 14 patients with soft tissue defects at fingertip and 7 patients at pulp, where the bone and (or) tendon were exposed. The wound sizes of patients in this group after debridement ranged from 2.0 cm×1.5 cm to 4.0 cm×2.7 cm. The wounds were all repaired with the neurocutaneous vascular flap innervated by terminal branch of lateral antebrachial cutaneous nerve, with the flap sizes ranged from 2.3 cm×1.8 cm to 4.3 cm×3.0 cm. At surgery, the terminal branch of lateral antebrachial cutaneous nerve carried by the flaps was anastomosed with the end of the proper digital nerve of the wound. The donor sites of flaps were sutured directly. The survival of flaps and healing of wounds in donor sites after operation were observed. The appearance of flaps and donor sites were observed during follow up. At the final follow-up, the static two-point discrimination distances of the flaps were measured, and the satisfaction degrees of patients for the appearances of injured hands were evaluated based on Michigan Hand Function Questionnaire. The total action motion (TAM) of the injured and contralateral thumbs and the angle of thumb web of the injured and contralateral hands were measured. Data were statistically analyzed with paired sample t test. Results: All the flaps of the 21 patients survived with good blood supply and no infection. The wounds at the donor sites were all healed. All the patients were followed up, with the time rangeing from 8 to 22 months. The appearances of flaps were good with their color and texture similar to the surrounding tissue. There was no pain in the fingertip and pulp, nor any double sensibility in flaps. There was only some linear scar left at the radial side of thumb. At the final follow-up, the static 2-point discrimination of the flaps of the patients was 6 to 11 mm; the appearance of the injured hand evaluation was strongly satisfied in 18 patients and satisfie in the 3 patients. The value of TAM in the injured thumbs and the value of the angle of thumb web of the injured hands of the patients were respectively (140±5)º and (94±9)°, which showed no statistically significant differences with the value of (141±5)º in the contralateral thumbs and (95±9)° in the contralateral hands, respectively (t=-2.024, -1.142, P>0.05). Conclusions: The neurocutaneous vascular flap innervated by terminal branch of lateral antebrachial cutaneous nerve, has constant anatomy, simple procedure, good appearance, and provides excellent thumb function. It is a good option for repairing fingertip and pulp wounds of the thumb and worthy of application and promotion.","Wang, H; Yang, X X; Huo, Y X; Hao, R Z; Chang, H; Liu, W; Wang, B",Zhonghua shao shang za zhi = Zhonghua shaoshang zazhi = Chinese journal of burns,https://doi.org/10.3760/cma.j.cn501120-20200607-00298; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34404163/,177

This study aimed to examine the effects of continuity of care on avoidable hospitalization and hospital admission for any condition in a health care system with a high level of access to care. METHODS We used a longitudinal design to examine claims data that captured health care utilization between January 1, 2000, and December 31, 2006, under a universal coverage health insurance program in Taiwan. In total, 30 830 randomly selected subjects with 3 or more physician visits per year between 2000 and 2006 were analyzed in 3 age groups. The main outcome was avoidable hospitalization and hospital admission for any condition. A random intercept logistic regression model was used to control for age, sex, low-income status, health status, time effect, and random subject effect. RESULTS Higher continuity of care was significantly associated with lower likelihood of avoidable hospitalization in all 3 age groups. Similar associations were found for hospital admission for any condition in the 3 age groups. CONCLUSIONS Better continuity of care is associated with fewer avoidable hospitalizations and fewer hospital admissions for any condition in a health care system with easy access to care. Therefore, improvement of continuity of care is an appropriate path to follow in a universal coverage health care system.","Cheng, Shou-Hsia; Chen, Chi-Chen; Hou, Yen-Fei",Archives of internal medicine,https://doi.org/10.1001/archinternmed.2010.340; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20937927/,177
145089,Matt Morgan: The hospital bed is broken.,2021-01-05,"Hot weather not only impacts upon human physical comfort and health, but also impacts the way that people access and experience active travel options such as walking and cycling. By evaluating the street thermal environment of a city alongside an assessment of those communities that are the most vulnerable to the effects of heat, we can prioritise areas in which heat mitigation interventions are most needed. In this paper, we propose a new approach for policy makers to determine where to delegate limited resources for heat mitigation with most effective outcomes for the communities. We use eye-level street panorama images and community profiles to provide a bottom-up, human-centred perspective of the city scale assessment, highlighting the situation of urban tree shade provision throughout the streets in comparison with environmental and social-economic status. The approach leverages multiple sources of spatial data including satellite thermal images, Google street view (GSV) images, land use and demographic census data. A deep learning model was developed to automate the classification of streetscape types and percentages at the street- and eye-view level. The methodology is metrics based and scalable which provides a data driven assessment of heat-related vulnerability. The findings of this study first contribute to sustainable development by developing a method to identify geographical areas or neighbourhoods that require heat mitigation; and enforce policies improving tree shade on routes, as a heat adaptation strategy, which will lead to increasing active travel and produce significant health benefits for residents. The approach can be also used to guide post COVID-19 city planning and design.","Sun, Qian Chayn; Macleod, Tania; Both, Alan; Hurley, Joe; Butt, Andrew; Amati, Marco",The Science of the total environment,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.143033; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33158537/,177

METHODS The preoperative data of patients undergoing PD were retrospectively reviewed. The objective variable was the percentage of blood loss during PD to the estimated circulating blood volume (proportional blood loss: PBL). The circulating blood volume was estimated using Nadler's formula. The total psoas area, average Hounsfield units of psoas area (psoas muscle density: PMD), and visceral to subcutaneous adipose tissue area ratio (VSR) were measured at the third vertebra using preoperative plain computed tomography images. A univariate analysis and multiple linear regression analysis for PBL were conducted using the preoperative variables. RESULTS A total of 415 patients were analyzed. The median PBL was 24.5%. The PMD (coefficient - 0.267; 95% CI - 0.518, - 0.015), VSR (coefficient 2.719; 95% CI 0.238, 5.201), serum albumin level (coefficient - 8.458; 95% CI - 13.02, - 3.898), neoadjuvant therapy (coefficient 9.605; 95% CI 1.722, 17.49), and prothrombin time-international normalized ratio (PT-INR, coefficient 38.63; 95% CI 10.94, 66.31) were independently associated with PBL. CONCLUSIONS The preoperative PMD, VSR, serum albumin level, neoadjuvant therapy, and PT-INR independently affected PBL.

146514,Finding community during a pandemic.,2020-04-10,"PURPOSE Whilst core curricula in neurology are nationally standardised, in real-world clinical practice, different approaches may be taken by individual consultants. The aims of this study were to investigate differences by assessing: (1) variance in diagnostic and investigative practice, using a case-based analysis of inter-rater agreement; (2) potential importance of any differences in terms of patient care; (3) relationships between clinical experience, diagnostic certainty, diagnostic peer-agreement and investigative approach. The objective was to develop novel individualised metrics to facilitate reflection and appraisal. METHODS Three neurologists with 6-23 years' experience at consultant level provided diagnosis, certainty (10-point Likert scale), and investigative approach for 200 consecutive general neurology outpatients seen by a newly qualified consultant in 2015. Diagnostic agreement was evaluated by percentage agreement. The potential importance of any diagnostic differences on patient outcome was assigned a score (6-point Likert scale) by the evaluating neurologist. Associations between diagnostic agreement, certainty and investigative approach were assessed using Spearman correlation, logistic and ordinal regression, and reported as individualised metrics for each rater. RESULTS Diagnostic peer-agreement was 3/3, 2/3, and 1/3 in 55.5%, 31.0%, 13.5% of cases, respectively. In 15.5%, differences in patient management were judged potentially important. Investigation rates were 42-73%. Mean diagnostic certainty ranged between 6.63/10 (SD 1.98) to 7.72/10 (SD 2.20) between least and most experienced consultants. Greater diagnostic certainty was associated with greater diagnostic peer-agreement (individual-rater regression coefficients 0.33-0.44, p<0.01) and lower odds of arranging investigations (individual-rater odds ratios 0.56-0.71, p<0.01). CONCLUSIONS It appears that variance in diagnostic and investigative practice between consultant neurologists exists and may result in differing management. Mean diagnostic certainty was associated with greater diagnostic peer-agreement and lower investigation rates. Metrics reflecting concordance with peers, and relationships to diagnostic confidence, could be developed in larger cohorts to inform reflective practice.","Aitchison, C; Blackburn, D J; Khan, A; Grünewald, R A; Jenkins, T M",International journal of clinical practice,https://doi.org/10.1111/ijcp.13830; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33184980/,177

Like any catastrophic event, the stress on hospitals to maintain a certain level of function is immense. Acute surgical pathologies cannot be prevented or curtailed; therefore, it is important to understand patterns and outcomes during catastrophes in order to optimize care and organize the health care system. METHODS In a single urban tertiary care center, a retrospective study examined the first complete lockdown period of Israel during the COVID-19 pandemic. This was compared to the same time period the previous year. RESULTS During the pandemic, time to hospitalization was significantly decreased. There was also an overall reduction in surgical admissions yet with a higher percentage being hospitalized for further treatment (69.2% vs 23.5%). The patients admitted during this time had a higher APACHE-II score and Charlson comorbidity index score. During the pandemic, time to surgery was decreased, there were less laparoscopic procedures, and more RBC units were used per patient. There were no differences in overall complications, except when sub-analyzed for major complications (9.7% vs 6.3%). There was no significant difference in overall in-house mortality or morbidity. Length of hospitalization was significantly decreased in the elderly population during the pandemic. CONCLUSION During the COVID-19 pandemic, despite a significantly less number of patients presenting to the hospital, there was a higher percentage of those admitted needing surgical intervention, and they were overall sicker than the previous year.","Maman, Yossi; Lee Goldstein, Adam; Neeman, Uri; Lessing, Yonatan; Orbach, Lior; Sirhan, Saad; Falk, Ela; Lahat, Guy",The American surgeon,https://doi.org/10.1177/00031348211011132; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33856956/,177

151085,New standards of monitoring guidelines: a reply.,2021-07-29,"UNLABELLED Because of their better penetration, smaller targeting proteins may be superior to antibodies for radioimmunotherapy of solid tumors. Therefore, Affibody molecules (6.5 kDa) have a potential for being suitable as targeted moiety for radiolabeled therapeutic proteins. Previous studies have demonstrated that a fusion of an Affibody molecule with an albumin-binding domain (ABD) provides a strong noncovalent binding to albumin in vivo. This strong noncovalent binding can be used for reduction of the renal uptake of the Affibody molecule while maintaining a size smaller than that of an antibody, which is important when using residualizing radionuclide labels conjugated to Affibody molecules. The goal of this study was to design and evaluate a new targeting Affibody-ABD fusion protein with improved biodistribution properties for radionuclide therapy. METHODS A novel Affibody-based construct, ZHER2:2891-ABD035-DOTA (ABY-027), was created by fusion of the reengineered HER2-binding Affibody molecule ZHER2:2891 to the N terminus of the high-affinity ABD035, and a maleimido-derivative of DOTA was conjugated at the C terminus of the construct. Binding and processing of (177)Lu-ABY-027 by HER2-expressing cells were evaluated in vitro. Targeting of HER2-expressing SKOV-3 xenografts was evaluated in BALB/C nu/nu mice and compared with targeting of previously reported ABD-(ZHER2:342)2. RESULTS The binding affinity (dissociation constant) of ABY-027 to HER2 (74 pM) was the same as for the parental ZHER2:2891 (76 pM). ABY-027 was stably labeled with (177)Lu and (111)In with preserved specific binding to HER2-expressing cells in vitro. In vivo receptor saturation experiments demonstrated that targeting of SKOV-3 xenografts in BALB/C nu/nu mice was HER2-specific. (177)Lu-ABY-027 demonstrated substantially (2- to 3-fold) lower renal and hepatic uptake than previously assessed HER2-specific Affibody-based albumin-binding agents. Tumor uptake of radiolabeled ABY-027 at 48 h after injection was 2-fold higher than that for previously reported ABD-(ZHER2:342)2. CONCLUSION An optimized molecular design of an ABD fusion protein resulted in an Affibody molecule construct with better properties for therapy. Fully preserved in vivo targeting of the fusion protein was shown in xenografted mice. Site-specific coupling of DOTA provides a uniform conjugate and creates the potential for labeling with a broad range of therapeutic radionuclides. The biodistribution of (177)Lu-ABY-027 in a murine model suggests it is more suitable for therapy than alternative approaches.","Orlova, Anna; Jonsson, Andreas; Rosik, Daniel; Lundqvist, Hans; Lindborg, Malin; Abrahmsen, Lars; Ekblad, Caroline; Frejd, Fredrik Y; Tolmachev, Vladimir","Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine",https://doi.org/10.2967/jnumed.112.110700; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23528382/,177

One such fusion inhibitor has been approved for treatment of human immunodeficiency virus-1 (T20, enfuvirtide). Resistance to T20 usually maps to the peptide binding site in HR1. To better understand fusion inhibitor potency and resistance, we combined virological, computational, and biophysical experiments with comprehensive mutational analyses and tested resistance to T20 and second and third generation inhibitors (T1249 and T2635). We found that most amino acid substitutions caused resistance to the first generation peptide T20. Only charged amino acids caused resistance to T1249, and none caused resistance to T2635. Depending on the drug, we can distinguish four mechanisms of drug resistance: reduced contact, steric obstruction, electrostatic repulsion, and electrostatic attraction. Implications for the design of novel antiviral peptide inhibitors are discussed.","Eggink, Dirk; Langedijk, Johannes P M; Bonvin, Alexandre M J J; Deng, Yiqun; Lu, Min; Berkhout, Ben; Sanders, Rogier W",The Journal of biological chemistry,https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.m109.004416; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19617355/,177

Over the past decade, synthetic biology has blossomed into a highly productive field, yielding advances in diverse areas such as neuroscience, cell-based therapies, and chemical manufacturing. Similarly, the field of gene therapy has made enormous strides both in proof-of-concept studies and in the clinical setting. One viral vector of increasing interest for gene therapy is the adenovirus (Ad). A major part of the Ad's increasing momentum comes from synthetic biology approaches to Ad engineering. Convergence of gene therapy and synthetic biology has enhanced Ad vectors by mitigating Ad toxicity in vivo, providing precise Ad tropisms, and incorporating genetic circuits to make smart therapies which adapt to environmental stimuli. Synthetic biology engineering of Ad vectors may lead to superior gene delivery and editing platforms which could find applications in a wide range of therapeutic contexts.","Collins, Logan Thrasher; Curiel, David T",ACS nano,https://doi.org/10.1021/acsnano.1c04556; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34415739/,177

METHODS Fifty-seven patients were admitted for elective craniotomy for surgical clipping of a cerebral aneurysm. They were randomly divided into three groups: Group S (SNB with 15 mL of 0.75% ropivacaine), group I (LA with 15 mL of 0.75% ropivacaine) and group C (that only received routine intravenous analgesia). Pro-inflammatory cytokine levels in plasma for 72 h postoperatively, hemodynamic response to skin incision, and postoperative pain intensity were measured. RESULTS The SNB with 0.75% ropivacaine not only decreased IL-6 levels in plasma 6 h after craniotomy but also decreased plasma CRP levels and increased plasma IL-10 levels 12 and 24 h after surgery compared to LA and routine analgesia. There were significant increases in mean arterial pressure 2 and 5 mins after the incision and during dura opening in Groups I and C compared with Group S. Group S had lower postoperative pain intensity, longer duration before the first dose of oxycodone, less consumption of oxycodone and lower incidence of PONV through 48 h postoperatively than Groups I and C. CONCLUSION Preoperative SNB attenuated inflammatory response to craniotomy for cerebral aneurysms, blunted the hemodynamic response to scalp incision, and controlled postoperative pain better than LA or routine analgesia.

Similar to previous studies, we show minimal effects of delayed processing on the numbers and general phenotype of PBMC up to 18 hours. In contrast, profound changes in the single-cell transcriptome and composition of the plasma proteome become evident as early as 6 hours after blood draw. These reflect patterns of cellular activation across diverse cell types that lead to progressive distancing of the gene expression state and plasma proteome from native in vivo biology.

OBJECTIVES To investigate the association between sOsmo and development of AKI and clinical outcomes in patients undergoing PCI. METHODS We investigated 1,927 consecutive patients undergoing PCI from the registry of a single center. Patients were divided into quartiles according to sOsmo at admission (Q1-Q4). sOsmo was calculated using the following equation: (1.86 × serum sodium [mmol/L]) + (glucose [mg/dL] / 18) + (blood urea nitrogen [mg/dL] / 2.8) + 9. The primary endpoint was AKI, per Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) definition. The secondary endpoints were 30-day and 1-year all-cause mortality. RESULTS Patients with the highest sOsmo (Q4) were older and more likely female, with significantly more cardiovascular risk factors and comorbidities compared to those with lower sOsmo (Q1-Q3). Incidence of AKI was highest in Q4 and lowest in Q2. In the multivariate logistic regression model, high sOsmo independently predicted the development of AKI (OR 2.00, 95% CI 1.26-3.19, p = 0.003). Patients with Q4 had a higher risk of 1-year mortality compared to patients with Q2 (HR 2.11, 95% CI 1.10-4.15; p = 0.031), but not after adding AKI to the multivariate model (HR 1.71, 95% CI 0.87-3.39; p = 0.12). CONCLUSION sOsmo is a valid and easily obtainable predictor of AKI after PCI. High sOsmo is associated with increased risk of AKI and 1-year mortality in patients undergoing PCI. Further research is warranted to clarify whether the use of an sOsmo-directed hydration protocol might reduce the incidence of AKI in patients undergoing PCI.","Farhan, Serdar; Vogel, Birgit; Baber, Usman; Sartori, Samantha; Aquino, Melissa; Chandrasekhar, Jaya; Sorrentino, Sabato; Giustino, Gennaro; Sharma, Madhav; Guedeney, Paul; Rohla, Miklos; Bhandari, Reyna; Barman, Nitin; Sweeny, Joseph; Dangas, George; Mehran, Roxana; Kini, Annapoorna; Sharma, Samin",Cardiorenal medicine,https://doi.org/10.1159/000494807; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30844810/,177

Adjustment to living with IBD can be negatively impacted by maladaptive cognitive and behavioural factors (e.g. negative illness representations and repressing emotions). Patient samples also report negative reactions from the general public and such perceptions can further negatively impact people living with IBD. Therefore, we aimed to systematically review literature investigating the illness perceptions, perceived stigmatisation, and negative emotional reactions toward IBD within patient and community samples. We also aimed to review how these factors impact those living with IBD (i.e. adjustment, psychological health). Design: A range of databases (e.g. Psych INFO, PubMed) were searched over two years. One reviewer individually screened titles and abstracts using the specified inclusion criteria, and this process was repeated by a second reviewer. Subsequently, the full text articles were screened and data were extracted for the 82 articles that satisfied the inclusion criteria. Following data extraction, a narrative synthesis was conducted. Results: The review of 82 studies suggested that negative illness perceptions are linked to poorer psychosocial outcomes, that patient samples frequently anticipate stigmatisation, fear relating to bowel accidents was the most common emotion reported, and that the general public direct little enacted stigma towards IBD. Conclusion: For people living with IBD: (i) poorer psychological adjustment was reported by those who held more negative perceptions and reactions toward their illness; and (ii) their concerns regarding public perceptions of IBD warrants further empirical attention. Results emphasise the importance of targeting perceptions, and facilitating education and adaptive responding during treatment.","Polak, Elia-Jade; O'Callaghan, Frances; Oaten, Megan",Psychology & health,https://doi.org/10.1080/08870446.2019.1662014; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31538517/,177

162492,Covidian education: An enquiry into Arab culture,2021,"BACKGROUND Cell-free mitochondrial DNA (cf-mtDNA) has recently been in the spotlight as an endogenously produced danger molecule that can potentially elicit inflammation. However, its clinical and prognostic implications are uncertain in patients undergoing hemodialysis. METHODS We examined the association of baseline cf-mtDNA categorized as tertiles with health-related quality of life (HRQOL), inflammatory cytokines, and mortality in a multicenter prospective cohort of 334 patients on hemodialysis. To better understand cf-mtDNA-mediated inflammation, we measured cytokine production after in vitro stimulation of bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) with mtDNA. RESULTS The higher cf-mtDNA tertile had a longer dialysis vintage, a greater comorbidity burden, and increased levels of inflammatory markers, including high-sensitivity-C-reactive protein, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, CXCL16, and osteoprotegerin. In particular, mtDNA augmented inflammatory cytokine release from BMDMs by lipopolysaccharide, the levels of which are reported to be increased in hemodialysis patients. Although the patients with higher levels of cf-mtDNA generally had lower (poorer) scores for HRQOL, cf-mtDNA was not associated with all-cause mortality in hemodialysis patients. CONCLUSION cf-mtDNA was correlated with poor clinical status and modestly associated with impaired quality of life in patients on hemodialysis. In proinflammatory milieu in end-stage renal disease, these associations may be attributed to the boosting effects of cf-mtDNA on inflammation.","Kim, Kipyo; Jung, Su Woong; Cho, Won-Hee; Moon, Haena; Jeong, Kyung Hwan; Kim, Jin Sug; Lee, Sang-Ho; Ahn, Shin Young; Yang, Dong Ho; Lee, Hong Joo; Lee, Dong-Young; Moon, Ju-Young; Kim, Yang Gyun",Blood purification,https://doi.org/10.1159/000510088; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32862176/,177

To explore strategies for increasing access to palliative care among individuals living in remote/rural communities, a rapid review was conducted on studies that explored the use of telehealth applications with this population. From December 2019 to February 2020, the PRISMA methodology was used to gather peer-reviewed studies published in the English language. MedLine, Google Scholar, and EBSCO were searched; no date limitations were set. Given the diversity of study methodologies and outcomes, the findings were synthesized narratively. The Cochrane Collaboration's tool for assessing the risk of bias was also employed. Lastly, the studies were mapped to clinical guidelines for the various aspects of quality palliative care. The 18 studies found, published between 2004 and 2019, were conducted in seven countries and on five continents. Aims included evaluating feasibility, efficacy, and user satisfaction. Insights draw from a combined pool of 3,313 patients and 250 providers. Most studies involved oncology patients and employed videoconferencing or a web platform/online software with videoconferencing. Three themes emerged: delivery of care, symptom management and quality of life, and patient/caregiver/provider satisfaction levels. Telehealth proved effective for patient and medication monitoring, provider and specialist appointments, and palliative care consultations. Operational benefits included clinician time saved, shorter appointment wait times, and reduced no show rates; implementation challenges also emerged. Statistical improvements in quality of life and symptom management were reported. Nearly two-thirds of the studies reported positive experiences among patients, caregivers, and providers; about half included an interprofessional team. The studies primarily focused on the structure/process and physical aspects of quality palliative care, there was a paucity of insights on the spiritual, cultural, end of life, and ethical/legal aspects of care. Two-thirds (12/18) of the studies employed a descriptive design. Risk for selection, performance, detection, and reporting biases emerged for all the studies; for example, only four of the studies included control groups and less than 20% (3/18) reported on attrition of study participants. Additional limitations include the rapid review methodology which relied heavily on the lead author's decisions and the restriction of studies published only in the English language. More rigorous research is required to confirm the viability of clinical care delivery and establish best practices for quality, virtual palliative care to remote/rural areas.","Gordon, Barbara; Mason, Barbara; Smith, Shauna L H",Journal of palliative care,https://doi.org/10.1177/08258597211001184; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33730904/,177
163298,A Highly Accreting Low-Mass Black Hole Hidden in the Dust: Suzaku and NuSTAR observations of the NLS1 Mrk 1239,2021-05-05,"This paper is based on the premise that the principal purpose of science and technological development should be the well-being of society in harmony with environmental sustainability. Vaclav Smil [1] argues 'commonly used measures of energy use - be it conversion efficiencies, energy costs, per capita utilization levels, growth rates, consumption elasticity, or output rations - are just helpful indicators of the performance and dynamics of processes whose aim should not be merely to secure basic existential needs or to satisfy assorted consumerist urges but also to enrich intellectual lives and to make us more successful as a social and caring species.' Energy and electricity access and use is valuable not in itself, but for what it enables women and men 'to do or achieve' [2]. Grubler studied the history of past energy transitions and identifies 'grand patterns', one of which being the critical importance of end-use - consumers and demand - 'with technology and the social settings co-evolving, depending on each other' [3]. Feminist studies in science and technology treat technology as a 'socio-technical' product and describe the relationship between gender and technology as one of mutual shaping [4]. Gender and development studies put forward the concept of 'gender mainstreaming' which has been applied to infrastructure programs, such as energy, transport and digital infrastructure, based on gender equality and social inclusion (GESI) approaches. The paper draws from these frameworks. Norbert Wiener considered the resilience of urban centres in preparation for a potential nuclear attack and outlined what he considered to be some key features of urban plans. In the first draft of his urban plan, titled 'Civilian Defense Plan', his central argument is that the atomic bomb has rendered our previous understanding of civil defense obsolete and that 'we need to reorganize our cities where they stand' - markets, points for medical supplies, hospitals, transportation, etc [5]. The Covid-19 pandemic highlighted the inter-relatedness and inter-connections between physical infrastructure, key utilities and services, and economic, health and social outcomes. There is an urgent need to rethink and transform cities to respond to the reality of Covid-19 and potential future pandemics, and to recover better, by building more resilient, inclusive and sustainable cities. International experiences show that cities with similar densities and levels of economic development have fared very differently in their ability to contain Covid-19. This indicates that the strength and duration of impacts of Covid-19 are not solely determined by a city's population density, but also by local capacity and preparedness to deal with such crises, infrastructure and service delivery systems, citizen's trust and confidence in society's institutions and the level of functional responsibilities and resources available to them through decentralized systems. Some of the key lessons for recovery and 'building back better' include the importance of an effective health system response, urban and regional planning, physical distancing, city-wide slum upgrading and housing programs, land-use and regulations to regulate hygiene conditions, significantly scaling up the low-carbon energy and infrastructure transition, access to key utilities and services for poor and vulnerable groups such as women, slum and transient populations, people with disabilities and the elderly, social protection, rethinking business supply chains, more resilient and inclusive ICT and digital connectivity and a pressing need to address gender inequality and social exclusion in relation to vulnerabilities. These new challenges require a new approach that integrates governance, physical environment and infrastructure, social environment, economic environment, planning and resourcing for resilience, and gender equality and social inclusion (GESI). The objective of the study was to develop an integrated approach to strengthening urban resilience based on infrastructure, energy and health li kages, with a focus on GESI impacts. Drawing from lessons learned from various connected fields: climate-related disaster programs to designing infrastructure;power and energy systems to incorporate resilience and reliability;universal health coverage and health system strengthening;and the preliminary lessons drawn from the activities undertaken to control the Covid-19 pandemic, a Resilience Assessment Framework has been proposed. The framework is intended to be used to assess the current resilience maturity level of a city. It can also be applied to measure progress, at different time intervals, towards a prospective target maturity level. © 2021 IEEE.","Mohideen, R.","3rd IEEE Conference on Norbert Wiener in the 21st Century: Being Human in a Global Village, 21CW 2021",https://doi.org/10.1109/21cw48944.2021.9532527,177

One hundred and fifty-one employees in two national five-star hotels in Turkey completed Web-based surveys. The previously mentioned linkages were gauged via structural equation modelling. Study results reveal that employees who are at risk of getting infected by COVID-19 are beset with MH problems at elevated levels. These employees in turn exhibit PLW and absences from work and display low levels of LS. The results further demonstrate that the threat of COVID-19 triggers employees' absenteeism.

163662,Stock Price Prediction Under Anomalous Circumstances,2021-09-14,"As vaccination against COVID-19 stalls in some countries, increased accessibility and more adaptive approaches may be useful to keep the epidemic under control. Here we study the impact of reactive vaccination targeting schools and workplaces where cases have been detected, with an agent-based model accounting for COVID-19 natural history, vaccine characteristics, individuals' demography and behaviour and social distancing. We study epidemic scenarios ranging from sustained spread to flare-up of cases, and we consider reactive vaccination alone and in combination with mass vaccination. With the same number of doses, reactive vaccination reduces cases more than non-reactive approaches, but may require concentrating a high number of doses over a short time in case of sustained spread. In case of flare-ups, quick implementation of reactive vaccination supported by enhanced test-trace-isolate practices would limit further spread. These results provide key information to promote an adaptive vaccination plan in the months to come.","Faucher, B.; Assab, R.; Roux, J.; Levy-Bruhl, D.; Tran Kiem, C.; Cauchemez, S.; Zanetti, L.; Colizza, V.; BoeÌlle, P.-Y.; Poletto, C.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.07.26.21261133v1?rss=1,177

The purpose of this study is to investigate the impact of the quarantine on the workplace. Design/methodology/approach: Structured interviews containing open-ended questions were conducted with fifty Australian public sector executive managers to gauge the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on their organizations. Findings: The study reveals the effects that the virus had on the organizations' teamwork as well as individuals' learning. It finds that organizations experienced both positive effects, such as increased creativity and initiative, and negative effects, such as reduced satisfaction with work teams, from the pandemic. Originality/value: This study also adds to the still-developing body of knowledge regarding the effects of the virus on individuals' levels of work team satisfaction as well as a variety of other factors specific to public sector organizations. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","AlMazrouei, H.",International Journal of Public Sector Management,https://doi.org/10.1108/ijpsm-08-2020-0199,177
163943,Filtration Efficiency of Air Conditioner Filters and Face Masks to Limit Exposure to Aerosolized Algal Toxins,2021,"The widespread transition to online teaching as a result of the global pandemic moved chemistry laboratory experiences online. At UBC's Okanagan campus, organic chemistry laboratory instruction was delivered synchronously to maximize student interactions with their teaching assistants. Two methods of online delivery were employed: (1) students gathered with a teaching assistant via Zoom to watch a prerecorded video of the laboratory procedure and (2) students gathered on Zoom to watch a livestream of the teaching assistant performing the experiment in the laboratory. A single TA implemented both methods, one in each of two laboratory sections. Student satisfaction with the two delivery methods was compared using a survey and semistructured interviews. Overall, the livestream section received significantly more positive feedback in all aspects, including student investment, perceived conceptual gains, understanding of glassware and techniques, ability to make proper experimental observations, engagement in critical thinking and problem-solving, and general satisfaction with their online lab experience. However, students expressed the belief that the primary role of a teaching laboratory is hands-on experience with chemistry equipment and techniques and that their experience was lacking in this aspect regardless of the lab delivery method. Students described two principal advantages of the livestream delivery. One was the inclusion of opportunities to witness mistakes or unexpected outcomes and then having to take part in the development of a resolution to address those errors;such opportunities were absent for students watching a prerecorded and edited video with a predetermined conclusion. A second aspect was that waiting periods inherent in the live performance of an experimental procedure allowed for unstructured interactions among students and the TA, both to discuss the experiment and to simply socialize. Overall, students believed that neither pedagogy compared favorably to a traditional in-person teaching laboratory experience, but the livestream method proved to be a highly superior approach for a synchronous online laboratory.","Petillion, RileyJ McNeil W.

Data independent acquisition (DIA) is an emerging technology with deep proteome coverage and accurate quantitative capability in proteomics studies, but is still in the early stage of development in the field of glycoproteomics. We propose GproDIA, a framework for the proteome-wide characterization of intact glycopeptides from DIA data with comprehensive statistical control by a 2-dimentional false discovery rate approach and a glycoform inference algorithm, enabling accurate identification of intact glycopeptides using wide isolation windows. We further adapt a semi-empirical spectrum prediction strategy to expand the coverage of spectral libraries of glycopeptides. We benchmark our method for N-glycopeptide profiling on DIA data of yeast and human serum samples, demonstrating that DIA with GproDIA outperforms the data dependent acquisition (DDA) based methods for glycoproteomics in terms of capacity and data completeness of identification, as well as accuracy and precision of quantification.

Such conditions increase the risk of coming into contact with the virus for incarcerated people, correctional staff, and their families and communities. Relative to the general public, moreover, incarcerated individuals have a higher prevalence of chronic health conditions such as asthma, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease, making them susceptible to complications should they become infected. Indeed, cumulative COVID-19 case rates among incarcerated people and correctional staff have grown steadily higher than case rates in the general population. Decarcerating Correctional Facilities during COVID-19 offers guidance on efforts to decarcerate, or reduce the incarcerated population, as a response to COIVD-19 pandemic.

However, such optical methods have until now focussed nearly exclusively on microtubule destabilisation. Here, we introduce “STEpos” as light-responsive epothilone reagents, designed to photoswitchably bind to tubulin and stabilise lateral contacts in the microtubule lattice. Using a novel styrylthiazole photoswitch, designed to allow the hydrogen-bonding that is key to epothilone potency, we have created the first set of GFP-orthogonal photoswitchable microtubule stabilisers. The STEpos can photocontrol microtubule polymerisation, cell division, and cellular microtubule dynamics with micron- and second-scale spatiotemporal precision. STEpos offer substantial improvements of potency, solubility, and ease-of-use compared to the only previous photopharmaceuticals for microtubule stabilisation. The intriguing structure-photoswitching-activity relationship insights from this work will also assist future developments of improved STEpo reagents, and we anticipate that these will contribute greatly to high-precision cytoskeleton research across the fields of biophysics, cargo transport, cell motility, cell division, development, and neuroscience.","Gao, Li; Meiring, Joyce C.

The authors’ goal is to present a set of actions in the area of public transport that are adjusted to different levels of epidemic development. The goal goes back to the following question: how can the highest possible level of passenger safety be ensured and the losses suffered by urban public transport companies kept as low as possible? The sets of pro-active measures for selected epidemic scenarios presented in the article may offer support to local authorities and public transport operators.

The current follow-up of the children, now aged 6 to 8 years, aims to strengthen our understanding of the relationship between these levels of prenatal alcohol exposure and neuropsychological functioning, facial dysmorphology, and brain structure & function. Findings to date Over half (59%) of mothers consumed some alcohol during pregnancy, with one in five reporting at least one binge drinking episode prior to pregnancy recognition. Children's craniofacial shape was examined at 12 months of age, and low to moderate prenatal alcohol exposure was associated with subtle midface changes. At two years of age, formal developmental assessments showed no evidence that cognitive, language or motor outcome was associated with any of the prenatal alcohol exposures investigated. Participants Between June 2018 and April 2021, 802 of the 1342 eligible AQUA study families completed a parent-report questionnaire (60%). Restrictions associated with COVID-19 pandemic disrupted recruitment, but early school-age neuropsychological assessments were undertaken with 696 children (52%), and 482 (36%) craniofacial images were collected. A pre-planned, exposure-representative subset of 146 random children completed a brain MRI. The existing AQUA study biobank was extended through collection of 427 (32%) child buccal swabs. Future plans We will investigate the relationship between prenatal alcohol exposure and specific aspects of neurodevelopment at 6-8 years, including brain structure & function. We will also determine whether craniofacial changes identified at 12 months of age are predictive of later developmental impairments. The contribution of genetics and epigenetics to individual variations in outcomes will be examined in conjunction with established and future national and international collaborations.","Muggli, E.; Halliday, J.; Elliott, E.; Penington, A.; Thompson, D.

A repeated-measures study design was used to examine the relationship between nursing students’ stress levels and coping strategies before and during the pandemic. Confirmatory factor analyses were conducted to validate the survey and a student T-test was used to compare the level of stress and coping strategies among 131 nursing students. The STROBE checklist was used. During COVID-19, there was a reliable and accurate relationship between stress and coping strategies. Furthermore, both stress and coping strategy scores were lower before COVID-19 and higher during COVID-19. Nursing students are struggling to achieve a healthy stress-coping strategy during the pandemic. There is a need for the introduction of stress management programs to help foster healthy coping skills.

In Sweden, MTI is offered to students whose parents/caregivers speak languages other than Swedish on a daily basis in the home. The focus is on how agentive space, as a body-space relationship, was created by students in a 9(th) grade class (ages 15-16 years) studying English MTI, in relation to both space and educational discourse. Despite the prescribed online distance teaching, many of the students collaboratively chose to assemble in a physical classroom without a supervisor on site. How the students created a new learning frame through their actions is discussed on the basis of video-recorded lessons, and two students' reflective follow-up talks. In this new - and in many respects difficult - learning space, educational discourse and educational ground rules were upheld through collaborative agency, which also facilitated expressions of identity and emotional space among the students. It is worth exploring further how schools can more efficiently draw on students' agency for language learning in similar and different contexts.","Hedman, C.; Mannish, S.",English in Education,https://doi.org/10.1080/04250494.2021.1955618,177

Despite contributing substantially to the economy and community, they are expected to make their own way in Australia’s expensive private rental market. Drawing on two surveys—one conducted prior to Covid-19 and one fielded during the pandemic—as well as forty semi-structured in-depth interviews, the article examines strategies adopted by students to cope with high rents in Sydney and Melbourne. Drawing on the concept of risk, we argue that international students studying in these two cities must constantly manage the pressures of expensive and unstable rental housing. Access to decent accommodation often depends on finding and maintaining paid employment. Second, students adopt risky strategies to meet housing costs such as sharing bedrooms. These strategies reduce rents but invoke further challenges. Third, we find that due to the loss of paid employment, the Covid-19 pandemic has substantially increased the risks for international students dependent on the private rental sector. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Morris, A.; Wilson, S.; Mitchell, E.; Ramia, G.; Hastings, C.",Housing Studies,https://doi.org/10.1080/02673037.2021.1961695,177

Understanding pathways of disinformation spread through APIs,2021-09-27,"Confirmed cases of the COVID-19 virus are still growing to date since the discovery of the first case in Wuhan, China at the end of 2019. Fast and accurate early identification of people infected with the COVID-19 virus can help control the rate of spread. One of the Deep Learning methods, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), is used to identify diseases in image data. The study proposes the CNN method using Chest X-ray images in the detection of COVID-19 cases with a transfer learning model that can improve higher accuracy. The Transfer Learning model used in this research is DenseNet121. In this study, the transfer learning model is used to see the accuracy obtained and compare it with the accuracy results of the traditional learning method. We used a larges open-source dataset of 1500 Chest X-ray images. System performance is measured from the level of accuracy by the use of transfer learning and the selection numbers of epoch and batch size parameters. That show that pairing parameters with epochs 100, batch size 64 produces a 98% accuracy rate which is the best pair parameter using transfer learning methods. Our transfer learning methods show better classification accuracy than traditional learning methods. © 2021 IEEE.","Hastuti, E.

However, there are few studies informing on the characteristics of cancer patients that have asymptomatic SARS-cov2 infection. The ACHOCC-19 study included asymptomatic patients. Methods: Analytical cohort study of patients with cancer and SARScov2 infection in Colombia. From April 1 to October 31, 2020, we collected data on demographic and clinical variables related to cancer and COVID-19 infection. We describe the characteristics and outcomes of patients who had no symptoms of COVID19. Association between outcomes and prognostic variables was analyzed using logistic regression models. Results: We included 742 patients, of which 205 (27.6%) were asymptomatic. Of these 62.2% were older than 61 years, 66% were women, 1.42% were smokers. The most frequent malignancy was breast cancer (25%), followed by colon-rectum (14.6%), sarcoma/soft tissues (5.66%) and lung cancer (5.19%). Patients were more likely to be asymptomatic if they had fewer comorbidities (0-1 comorbidities: 84% asymptomatic, 2 comorbidities: 10.85%, more than 2 comorbidities: 5.15%). 90.5% lived in urban areas and 53.37% had low income. 35.4% of patients had metastatic disease, 8.7% had progressive cancer, 40% had stable disease or partial response. No patient had an ECOG PS of 4 or more, and only 1.91% had ECOG 3. In logistic regression analysis statistically significant associations for having symptomatic disease included: man, presence of 1, 2 or &gt; 2 comorbidities, ECOG 1,2 or 3 and cancer in progression. On the other hand, the statistically significant ORs for having asymptomatic disease were age between 18 and 30 years old, cancer in remission and receiving non-cytotoxic treatment. Table sumarizes ORs and their respective 95% CIs of the variables adjusted in the logistic regression model. Conclusions: In our stumdy, cancer patients had a higher probability of asymptomatic COVID-19 infection if they were women, between the ages of 18 and 30 years, had cancer in remission , ECOG 0 and no comorbidities. This is the first cohort of patients with cancer and asymptomatic covid 19 with a significant sample size in Latin America.","Serrano, A. V. O.; Maya, R. E. B.; Mantilla, W. A.; Triana, I.

Approximately 92 percent of respondents reported implementing voluntary actions, with 35 percent reporting quarantine and 37 percent reporting isolation actions. Respondent attributes and the agencies and communities they work in are categorized in terms of personal, disciplinary, or professional backgrounds, including urban versus rural locations, coastal versus non-coastal communities, and other factors. Three different dependent variables are modeled, including: 1) risk tolerance, 2) level of preparedness (including support for training), and 3) implementation of protective measures for social distancing, quarantine, and isolation to ascertain the influences of personal, professional, and locational characteristics. A risk tolerance score is used by asking, “What percentage of the population would need to be sick to execute voluntary and non-voluntary actions?” Poisson regression and correspondence analysis are used to identify patterns, associations, and clustering of respondent characteristics to show the relationships between risk perceptions, preparedness, and professional backgrounds. In addition to determining which places and people are more inclined to support protective actions against the pandemic, this analysis also demonstrates the intersections and mutual interests across public health, transportation, and emergency management. Overall, a low level of preparedness for the pandemic was found, with 70 percent of the respondents supporting additional training. © 2021 The Author(s)","Kim, K.; Yamashita, E.; Ghimire, J.",Transportation Research Interdisciplinary Perspectives,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.trip.2021.100430,177
168881,A Study of Cloud Computing Adoption in Universities as a Guideline to Cloud Migration,2021,"Commuting behaviour has been intensively examined by geographers, urban planners, and transportation researchers, but little is known about how commuting behaviour is spatially linked with the job and housing markets in urban cities. New Zealand has been recognised as one of the countries having the most unaffordable housing over the past decade. A group of middle-class professionals called ‘key workers’, also known during the pandemic as ‘essential workers’, provide essential services for the community, but cannot afford to live near their workplaces due to a lack of affordable housing. As a result, these key workers incur significant sub-optimal commuting. Such job-housing imbalance has contributed to a so-called spatial mismatch problem. This study aims to visualise the excess commuting patterns of individual workers using the Integrated Data Infrastructure (IDI) from Statistics New Zealand. The visualisation suggests that over the last demi-decade, housing unaffordability has partially distorted the commuting patterns of key workers in Auckland. More of the working population, in particular those key workers, are displaced to the outer rings of the city. While there is an overall reduction in excess commuting across three groups of workers, key workers remain the working population with a disproportionate long excess commute.","Xiong, Chuyi Filippova Olga",ISPRS International Journal of Geo-Information,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijgi10070457,177

For the current Cycle (7), ALMA offers up to 4300 hours for the 12-m array, and 3000 hours on both the 7-m of the Atacama Compact Array (ACA) and TP Array plus 750 hours in a supplemental call. From the customer perspective (i.e., the astronomical community), ALMA is an integrated product service provider, i.e. it observes in service mode, processes and delivers the data obtained. The Data Management Group (DMG) is in charge of the processing, reviewing, and delivery of the ALMA data and consists of approximately 60 experts in data reduction, from the ALMA Regional Centers (ARCs) and the Joint ALMA Observatory (JAO), distributed in fourteen countries. Prior to their delivery, the ALMA data products go through a thorough quality assurance (QA) process, so that the astronomers can work on their science without the need of significant additional calibration re-processing. Currently, around 90% of the acquired data is processed with the ALMA pipeline (the so called pipeline-able data), while the remaining 10% is processed completely manually. The Level-1 Key Performance Indicator set by the Observatory to DMG is that 90% of the pipeline-able data sets (i.e. some 80% of the data sets observed during an observing cycle) must be processed, reviewed and delivered within 30 days of data acquisition. This paper describes the methodology followed by the JAO in order to process near 80% of the total data observed during Cycle 7, a giant leap with respect to approximately 30% in Cycle 4 (October 2016 - September 2017).","Yus, Jorge F.

Objective: To determine the primary medical students’ reactive anxiety level and the final scores of their educational progress in distance learning during the SARS-COV-2 pandemic. Materials and Methods: The study involved 824 students at medical universities in Saratov and Moscow. The assessment of the reactive anxiety level was carried out according to the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, STAI;the average score of students' academic performance was calculated according to the data of the technological platform ""1C: Enterprise"" version 8.4.1. The survey was completed during distance learning in May 2020. The quality of distance learning was compared to a similar score for 2019, when students were trained in a traditional way. Statistical analysis was conducted using Statistica 6.0. Results: It was shown the presence of moderately severe disorders among the primary medical students according to the average score of reactive anxiety (43.28 ± 12.85), that expressed more in females s (p&lt;0.05), After distance learning, lasting 25% of the whole course, the overall performance score in theoretical knowledge did not change significantly (p&gt;0.05) but the practical skills suffered much especially in time trend (p&lt;0.05). Novelty: It was found that a high level of the reactive anxiety negatively affects the students' adaptive capabilities and the education quality. The specificity of programs at different faculties can determine the state of the students' psychological status. Findings: Timely transition to online classes during pandemics helps to preserve the students' mental well-being and the quality of the educational process. The duration of distance learning for a practical course should not exceed 25% of the whole course. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee ESJ, Italy.

170428,"European Green Deal and Recovery Plan: Green Jobs, Skills and Wellbeing Economics in Spain",2021,"The world is nearing the 2030 target‐year by which sustainable development goals (SDGs) should be achieved. While other developing regions seem to be making progress toward achieving SDG6, sub‐Saharan Africa (SSA) is lagging behind significantly, particularly with regard to access to water supply and sanitation (WSS). As a result, most studies evaluating progress toward the achievement of water security SDGs in SSA have focused on WSS while the rest of the SDG6 targets have received scant attention, often using fragmented or incomplete evidence. Here, we fill this knowledge gap by conducting a comprehensive assessment of the status of SDG6 in all 48 countries in SSA. We provide a review of the progress made, the challenges affecting each SDG6 target and examine the different political, socioeconomic, and environmental factors with potential to undermine the achievement of SDG6 in the region. Our review clearly demonstrates that it is likely that most countries may not achieve water security by 2030. The complex nature of the challenges and factors impeding the achievement of water security in SSA outlined here suggests that a holistic intervention involving local, national, and international stakeholders and the research community is urgently needed to address SDG6 if the 2030 target date is to be met. Approaches to enhance water security may equally consider: (a) underpinning peace and security in SSA and (b) the commitment of more financial resources by donors particularly during this period of COVID‐19 pandemic.This article is categorized under: Human Water Human Water > Water Governance Engineering Water > Planning Water [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of WIRES Water is the property of Wiley-Blackwell and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission.

Methods: Using the payment data from all 79 pharmaceutical companies in Japan between 2017 and 2018 and direct research grants from the Japanese government between 2019 and 2020, we evaluated the extent of financial and non-financial COI among all 20 Japanese government COVID-19 advisory board members. Results: Japanese government COVID-19 advisory board members were predominantly male (75.0%) and physicians (50.0%). Between 2019 and 2020, two members (10.0%) received a total of $819,244 in government research funding. Another five members (25.0%) received $419,725 in payments, including $223,183 in personal fees, from 28 pharmaceutical companies between 2017 and 2018.

Further, neither the Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare nor the Japanese Cabinet Secretariat disclosed financial or non-financial COI with industry. Further, the government and had no policies for managing COI among advisory board members. Conclusions: This study found that the Japanese government COVID-19 advisory board had financial and non-financial COI with pharmaceutical companies and the government. Further, there were no rigorous COI management strategies for the COVID-19 advisory board members. Any government must ensure the independence of scientific advisory boards by implementing more rigorous and transparent management strategies that require the declaration and public disclosure of all COI.","Mamada, H.; Murayama, A.; Ozaki, A.; Hashimoto, T.; Saito, H.; Sawano, T.; Bhandari, D.; Shrestha, S.; Tanimoto, T.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.09.12.21263442v1?rss=1,177

The policies cover a wide range including on-campus testing, contact tracing, isolation and quarantine, encouraging mask use and social distancing, and redesigning class environments to provide enough space between individuals. The authors of this viewpoint have been involved in an intense 5-month modeling of the spread of COVID-19 in universities, applying various modeling techniques, including network analysis, system dynamics, differential-equation modeling, agent-based stochastic simulations, and statistical approaches. For several reasons, including the financial viability of academic institutions and the social and pedagogical benefits of having students on campus, many universities decided to follow the path of opening campuses and providing the option of in-person or hybrid classes. In preparation for reopening of in-person instruction, academic institutions across the country spent significant time and effort to keep their campus and classrooms safe. The simulation models show that tests are necessary, but in order to effectively contain the disease, several stringent criteria should be met about how testing is implemented;otherwise, testing and isolation are ineffective to contain sizeable outbreaks. First, testing of the majority of the university community on arrival to the community is crucial in order to minimize importation and, therefore, slow down the early spread of the disease. Second, comprehensive testing of everyone, including faculty and staff members, should continue for the duration of the academic term at a high frequency;otherwise, the initial missed cases are enough to cause a substantial outbreak. However, a significant portion of the overall university community faculty and staff members are much more likely to fall in high-risk populations. The spread of the disease among students and the broader community comes with high likelihood of fatalities among this population. Universities must accept that the implementation of policies sufficient to prevent or curtail an outbreak will be challenging, costly, and fraught with setbacks.","Ghaffarzadegan, N.; Childs, L.

The modeling by structural equations method has been used to determine the relationship between the priority of EV, the level of consistency of the system of EV, and labor productivity. The study has determined that a stimulating effect on labor productivity is provided by an increase in the priority and development of moral values, democratic values, values of self-development and self-realization, purposefulness, and tolerance among all categories of employees.

171391,An intelligent COVID-19 classification model using optimal grey-level co-occurrence matrix features with extreme learning machine,2021,"Efficient, targeted integration of large DNA constructs represent a significant hurdle in genetic engineering for the development of mouse models of human disease and synthetic biology research. To address this, we developed a system for efficient and precise, targeted single-copy integration of large transgenes directly into the zygote using multiple mouse genetic backgrounds. Conventional approaches, such as random transgenesis, CRISPR/Cas9-mediated homology-directed repair (HDR), lentivirus-based insertion, or DNA transposases all have significant limitations. Our strategy uses in vivo Bxb1 mediated recombinase-mediated cassette exchange (RMCE) to efficiently generate precise single-copy integrations of transgenes. This is achieved using a transgene “landing pad” composed of dual heterologous Bxb1 attachment (att) sites in cis, pre-positioned in the Gt(ROSA)26Sor safe harbor locus. Successful RMCE is achieved in att carrier zygotes using donor DNA carrying cognate attachment sites flanking the desired donor transgene microinjected along with Bxb1-integrase mRNA. This approach routinely achieves perfect vector-free integration of donor constructs at efficiencies as high as 43% and has generated transgenic animals containing inserts up to ∼43kb. Furthermore, when coupled with a nanopore-based Cas9-targeted sequencing (nCATS) approach, complete verification of the precise insertion sequence can be achieved. As a proof-of-concept we describe the creation and characterization of C57BL/6J and NSG Krt18-ACE2 transgenic mouse models for SARS-CoV2 research with verified heterozygous N1 animals available for experimental use in ∼4 months. In addition, we created a diverse series of mouse backgrounds carrying a single att site version of the landing pad allele in C57BL/6J, NSG, B6(Cg)-Tyrc-2J/J, FVB/NJ, PWK/PhJ, 129S1/SvImJ, A/J, NOD/ShiLtJ, NZO/HILtJ, CAST/EiJ, and DBA/2J for rapid transgene insertion. Combined, this system enables predictable, rapid creation of precisely targeted transgenic animals across multiple genetic backgrounds, simplifying characterization, speeding expansion and use.","Low, Benjamin E.; Hosur, Vishnu; Lesbirel, Simon; Wiles, Michael V.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.20.461117,177

Even though strict lockdown restrictions deteriorate economic prosperity, negative effects on firm values are only temporary in a maximum 20-trading-day window. Our results are also robust when subsamples of provinces and companies are considered.","Ren, Zhaomin Zhang Xuan Zhang Zhekai",Economic Analysis and Policy,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eap.2021.08.002,177

In the present work, a model is proposed that contains these growth models as extreme cases;this model is generalized by including the Caputo-type fractional derivative of order 0<β≤1, resulting in a Fractional Growth Model which could be classified as a growth model with non-fixed inflection point. Moreover, the proposed model is generalized to include multiple sigmoidal behaviors and thereby multiple inflection points. The models developed are applied to describe cumulative confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Mexico, US and Russia, obtaining an excellent adjustment corroborated by a coefficient of determination R2>0.999.","Alcántara-López, Fernando Fuentes Carlos Chávez Carlos Brambila-Paz Fernando Quevedo Antonio",Mathematics,https://doi.org/10.3390/math9161915,177
171872,Persian Language Model based on BiLSTM Model on COVID-19 Corpus,2021,"The way in which the emotion of fear affects the technology adoption of students and teachers amid the COVID-19 pandemic is examined in this study. Mobile Learning (ML) has been used in the study as an educational social platform at both public and private higher-education institutes. The key hypotheses of this study are based on how COVID-19 has influenced the incorporation of mobile learning (ML) as the pandemic brings about an increase in different kinds of fear. The major kinds of fear that students and teachers/instructors are facing at this time include: fear because of complete lockdown, fear of experiencing education collapse and fear of having to give up social relationships. The proposed model was evaluated by developing a questionnaire survey which was distributed among 280 students at Zayed University, on the Abu Dhabi Campus, in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) with the purpose of collecting data from them. This study uses a new hybrid analysis approach that combines SEM and deep learning-based artificial neural networks (ANN). The importance-performance map analysis is also used in this study to determine the significance and performance of every factor. Both ANN and IPMA research showed that Attitude (ATD) are the most important predictor of intention to use mobile learning. According to the empirical findings, perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, satisfaction, attitude, perceived behavioral control, and subjective norm played a strongly significant role justified the continuous Mobile Learning usage. It was found that perceived fear and expectation confirmation were significant factors in predicting intention to use mobile learning. Our study showed that the use of mobile learning (ML) in the field of education, amid the coronavirus pandemic, offered a potential outcome for teaching and learning;however, this impact may be reduced by the fear of losing friends, a stressful family environment and fear of future results in school. Therefore, during the pandemic, it is important to examine students appropriately so as to enable them to handle the situation emotionally. The proposed model has theoretically given enough details as to what influences the intention to use ML from the viewpoint of internet service variables on an individual basis. In practice, the findings would allow higher education decision formers and experts to decide which factors should be prioritized over others and plan their policies appropriately. This study examines the competence of the deep ANN model in deciding non-linear relationships among the variables in the theoretical model, methodologically.

Traditional CVs are inadequate to highlight these imbalances. CovidCV is a framework for academicians that allows them to document their life in a holistic way during the pandemic. It creates a color-coded CV from the user's data entries documenting the work and home life and categorizing corresponding events as good or bad. It, thus, provides a visual representation of an academician's life during the current pandemic. The user can mark any event as major or minor indicating the impact of the event on their life. The CovidCV prototypical system is developed using a three tier architecture. The first tier, the front-end, is a user interface layer that is a web application. This prototype has a back-end layer consisting of two tiers which are responsible for handling the business logic and the data management respectively. The CovidCV system design is described in this paper. A preliminary experimentation with the prototype highlights the usefulness of CovidCV. © 2021 IEEE.","Raja, U.; Chowdhury, N. S.; Raje, R.

Animal studies that are focused solely on translational potential, may not sufficiently document unexpected outcomes. Considerable amounts of data from such studies could be used to advance veterinary science. For example, sheep are increasingly being used as models of intensive care and therefore, data arising from such models must be published. In this study, the hypothesis is that there is little information describing cardiorespiratory physiological data from sheep models of intensive care and the author aimed to analyse such data to provide biological information that is currently not available for sheep that received extracorporeal life support (ECLS) following acute smoke-induced lung injury. Methods Nineteen mechanically ventilated adult ewes undergoing intensive care during evaluation of a form of ECLS (treatment) for acute lung injury were used to collate clinical observations. Eight sheep were injured by acute smoke inhalation prior to treatment (injured/treated), while another eight were not injured but treated (uninjured/treated). Two sheep were injured but not treated (injured/untreated), while one received room air instead of smoke as the injury and was not treated (placebo/untreated). The data were then analysed for 11 physiological categories and compared between the two treated groups. Results Compared with the baseline, treatment contributed to and exacerbated the deterioration of pulmonary pathology by reducing lung compliance and the arterial oxygen partial pressure to fractional inspired oxygen (PaO2/FiO2) ratio. The oxygen extraction index changes mirrored those of the PaO2/FiO2 ratio. Decreasing coronary perfusion pressure predicted the severity of cardiopulmonary injury. Conclusions These novel observations could help in understanding similar pathology such as that which occurs in animal victims of smoke inhalation from house or bush fires, aspiration pneumonia secondary to tick paralysis and in the management of the severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in humans.","Chemonges, Saul",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/058511,177

Evidence Acquisition: Bilateral lung involvement (70%), peripheral distribution (67.5%), multifocal involvement (67.3%) and ground glass opacity (66.1%) were observed in most infected patients Results: Evaluation of the number of lobes involved in infected patients showed no abnormalities in 7.2% (85/1177) of the patients. Regarding the performance of reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and chest CT scan, the sensitivity of RT-PCR and chest CT imaging was estimated at 70% (925/1311) and 89% (6605/7396) upon admission, respectively;nevertheless, the sensitivity of CT imaging increased as the time from the symptom onset increased. The CT image acquisition parameters affecting image quality and patient dose were also discussed. Studies suggested that these factors should be adjusted according to the disease stage. Based on our findings, sensitivity was adequately high eight days after the onset of symptoms. Conclusion: Therefore, there is no need for high-resolution chest CT scan after this interval.

In addition, employee responses to these changes are explored.Design/methodology/approachThe authors carried out a field study of MC changes in PSFs in Italy, the first country in Europe that was severely impacted by COVID-19. Interviews with PSF employees form the primary data source. Pattern matching was used to identify similarities and differences and investigate how employees respond to the MC changes.FindingsAs a response to the shift to remote working, managers at PSFs made various MC-related changes. For instance, they increased the number of online meetings and made use of technologies to monitor employees from a distance. Employees reacted to this by engaging in “voluntary visibilizing practices”, i.e. by trying to make sure they got noted by their superiors, for instance by doing overtime. In addition, collected evidence suggests increased stress levels among employees, changes to employee autonomy, changed perceptions of hierarchies and a weakened sense of relatedness with others in the organization.Originality/valueThis is one of the first studies to examine the impact of the sudden shift to remote working on MC. In addition, this paper contributes by exploring employee responses to the MC-related changes. The findings add to the growing literature on MC and motivation, and the notion of voluntary visibilizing practices is mobilized to warn against over-commitment and self-exploitation.","Delfino, Gianluca F.; Berend van der, Kolk","Accounting, Auditing &amp; Accountability Journal",https://doi.org/10.1108/aaaj-06-2020-4657,177

To address this therapeutic shortcoming, we applied a system biology approach to the study of patients hospitalized with severe COVID. We show that, at the time of hospital admission, patients who were equivalent on the clinical ordinal scale displayed significant differential monocyte epigenetic and transcriptomic attributes between those who would survive and those who would succumb to COVID-19. We identified mRNA metabolism, RNA splicing, and interferon signaling pathways as key host responses overactivated by patients who would not survive. Those pathways are prime drug targets to reduce mortality of critically ill COVID-19 patients leading us to identify Tacrolimus, Zotatifin, and Nintedanib as three strong candidates for treatment of severely ill patients at the time of hospital admission.","Fava, V.

Mathematical modelling and forecasting efforts have been widely used to inform policy-making and to create situational awareness. Methods and Findings: From 8th March to 29th November 2020, we produced weekly estimates of SARS-CoV-2 transmissibility and forecasts of deaths due to COVID-19 for countries with evidence of sustained transmission. The estimates and forecasts were based on an ensemble model comprising of three models that were calibrated using only the reported number of COVID-19 cases and deaths in each country. We also developed a novel heuristic to combine weekly estimates of transmissibility and potential changes in population immunity due to infection to produce forecasts over a 4-week horizon. We evaluated the robustness of the forecasts using relative error, coverage probability, and comparisons with null models. Conclusions: During the 39-week period covered by this study, we produced short- and medium-term forecasts for 81 countries. Both the short- and medium-term forecasts captured well the epidemic trajectory across different waves of COVID-19 infections with small relative errors over the forecast horizon. The model was well calibrated with 56.3% and 45.6% of the observations lying in the 50% Credible Interval in 1-week and 4-week ahead forecasts respectively. We could accurately characterise the overall phase of the epidemic up to 4-weeks ahead in 84.9% of country-days.

Engagement actions are well evaluated by digital monitoring or by logging iterations, and clinical outcomes by target range measurements. A new product modification in the Dario application included development of in-App educational interactions about healthy eating habits. In addition, user experience feature that help users understand the context of their blood glucose measurement was developed. This study evaluated the effect of the digital product modification. Method: A retrospective data evaluation study was performed on DarioTM members during the time before and after product modification. Digital engagement and clinical outcomes were measured on first to six months per each period to examine if habit formation was achieved. Results: A group of total 9794 users who had enrolled in a membership for 6 months or longer was evaluated. The ratio of measurements logged with context (fasting, pre-meal, post-meal, bedtime) was increased significantly by 56% in the first month following product modification on average (51.3%. vs. 32.8%) (P&lt;0.001). Differences in the level of digital engagement remained stable over a 6 months period. The average number of days between measurements, i.e., ""recency"" decreased by 21% on average (2.71 vs. 3.45). Average ratios of high readings (180-400 mg/dL) were reduced by 12% on average over six months.

175638,Development and assessment of the performance of a shared ventilatory system that uses clinically available components to individualize tidal volumes,2020-12-11,"Fungal infections remain a major global concern. Emerging fungal pathogens and increasing rates of resistance mean that additional research efforts and resources must be allocated to advancing our understanding of fungal pathogenesis and developing new therapeutic interventions. Neutrophilic granulocytes are a major cell type involved in protection against the important fungal pathogen Aspergillus fumigatus, where they employ numerous defense mechanisms, including production of antimicrobial extracellular vesicles. A major draw-back to work with neutrophils is the lack of a suitable cell line system for the study of fungal pathogenesis. To address this problem, we assessed the feasibility of using differentiated PLB-985 neutrophil-like cells as an in vitro model to study A. fumigatus infection. We find that dimethylformamide-differentiated PLB-985 cells provide a useful recapitulation of many aspects of A. fumigatus interactions with primary human polymorphonuclear leukocytes. We find that differentiated PLB-985 cells phagocytose fungal conidia and acidify conidia-containing phagolysosomes similar to primary neutrophils, release neutrophil extracellular traps, and also produce antifungal extracellular vesicles in response to infection. In addition, we provide an improved method for the isolation of extracellular vesicles produced during infection by employing a size-exclusion chromatography-based approach. Advanced LC-MS/MS proteomics revealed an enrichment of extracellular vesicle marker proteins and a decrease of cytoplasmic proteins in extracellular vesicles isolated using this improved method. Ultimately, we find that differentiated PLB-985 cells can serve as a genetically tractable model to study many aspects of A. fumigatus pathogenesis. IMPORTANCE Polymorphonuclear leukocytes are an important defense against human fungal pathogens, yet our model systems to study this group of cells remains very limited in scope. In this study, we established that differentiated PLB-985 cells can serve as a model to recapitulate several important aspects of human polymorphonuclear leukocyte interactions with the important human fungal pathogen Aspergillus fumigatus. The proposed addition of a cultured neutrophil-like cell line to the experimental toolbox to study fungal pathogenesis will allow for a more mechanistic description of neutrophil antifungal biology. In addition, the easier handling of the cell line compared to primary human neutrophils allowed us to use PLB-985 cells to provide an improved method for isolation of neutrophil-derived extracellular vesicles using size-exclusion chromatography. Together, these results provide significant tools and a baseline knowledge for the future study of neutrophil-derived extracellular vesicles in the laboratory.","Rafiq, Muhammad; Rivieccio, Flora; Zimmermann, Ann-Kathrin; Visser, Corissa; Bruch, Alexander; Krüger, Thomas; González, Katherine; Kniemeyer, Olaf; Blango, Matthew G.; Brakhage, Axel A.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.28.454178,177
175716,Stochastic vs. Deterministic Modeling for the Spread of COVID-19 in Small Networks,2021,"Abstract COVID-19 is a pandemic associated with systemic clinical manifestations. In this study, we aimed to present a narrative review on kidney involvement in COVID-19. Kidney involvement could be derived from direct cytopathic effects, immunological mechanisms, indirect effects on renal tissue through other mediators, and dysfunction or injury of other organs. The evolution of COVID-19 may be complicated with acute kidney injury (AKI) in a significant percentage of patients, and renal dysfunction seems to be associated with worse prognosis. Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) seem to be more susceptible to the severe forms of COVID-19. Patients with renal replacement therapy (RRT) are also a vulnerable population as consequence of their advanced age, underlying comorbidities, impaired immune response, and clustering in hemodialysis centers, with requirements for frequent contact with healthcare services. Kidney transplant patients may be at high-risk due to long-term immunosuppression and comorbidities, hence, managing immunosuppression is imperative. Lastly, renal replacement therapy may be required during COVID-19, and different modalities are discussed based on clinical findings and laboratorial aspects. Therefore, COVID-19 seems to affect kidney by different mechanisms, which contributes for AKI development and increases the severity of the disease. Also, patients with CKD and kidney transplant recipients are at higher risk for COVID-19 and mortality.","Chagas, Gabriel Cavalcante Lima; Rangel, Amanda Ribeiro; Noronha, Luisa Macambira; da Silva Jr., Geraldo Bezerra; Meneses, Gdayllon Cavalcante; Martins, Alice Maria Costa; Daher, Elizabeth De Francesco",Rev.

CD73 is present on subsets of human B and T cells where it plays a role in lymphocyte activation and migration. CD73 also functions as an ectoenzyme that converts AMP into immunosuppressive adenosine. We have developed a humanized anti-CD73 antibody, mupadolimab (CPI-006), that blocks CD73 enzymatic activity and activates CD73POS B cells, thereby inducing differentiation into plasmablasts, immunoglobulin class switching, and antibody secretion independent of the adenosine modulatory activity. These effects suggest mupadolimab may enhance the magnitude, diversity, and duration of anti-viral responses in patients with COVID-19. This hypothesis was tested in a dose escalation phase 1 trial in 29 hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Single doses of 0.3 mg/kg - 5 mg/kg mupadolimab were well tolerated with no drug related adverse events. Doses greater than 0.3 mg/kg resulted in rapid generation of IgG and IgM to SARS-CoV-2 significantly above titers measured in convalescent controls, with elevated IgG titers sustained for more than 6 months beyond presentation of symptoms. Based on these findings, a randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study in hospitalized patients was initiated. The primary endpoint was proportion of patients alive and free from respiratory failure within 28 days. This trial was discontinued early during the period of waning COVID-19 incidence after enrolling 40 patients. Although underpowered, results from this trial suggest improvement in the primary and key secondary endpoints in patients treated with single doses of 2 mg/kg and 1 mg/kg compared to placebo. The presumed mechanism of action, stimulation of B cells, may represent a novel approach to immunotherapy of COVID-19 and other viral infections.","Miller, R.

Many studies have been pursuing more effective techniques to forecast tourist arrivals after the worldwide COVID-19. A hybrid method based on singular spectrum analysis (SSA) and long short-term memory network (LSTM) that incorporates various varieties of time series, containing historical tourist arrivals and search intensity indices (SII), is proposed to make tourist arrivals predictions. The proposed method is applied to the empirical studies and its results outperform all baseline models which verifies the effectiveness of the denoised deep learning method for high-frequency predictions. In addition, experimental results on independent SII variables reveal that SII data is of great significance to tourist arrivals predictions and provides practitioners with deeper comprehension of potential tourism forecasting factors. © 2021 IEEE.","Wang, J.; Ge, P.; Liu, Z.","2nd IEEE International Conference on Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning, PRML 2021",https://doi.org/10.1109/prml52754.2021.9520695,177

Several studies have established that severe cases of COVID-19 infections tend to have a higher Neutrophil Lymphocyte Ratio (NLR) and is an independent predictor of mortality. Aim: This study aimed to determine whether NLR can serve as a predictor of the prognosis of COVID-19 infections in Indian patients. Materials and Methods: This study was an ambispective observational single centre study conducted in Tirunelveli Medical College from March 2020 to July 2020. Clinical and laboratory data of 1100 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infected patients were reviewed in this study. The patients were categorised as, asymptomatic, mild, moderate, and severe cases based on their clinical presentation. The demographic, clinical characteristics and laboratory data on the day of admission were analysed and compared by tertiles of the NLR. The receiver operating curve was applied to determine the threshold of NLR and the prognostic value was assessed via the Kaplan-Meier curve and regression models. Results: A total of 1100 cases were included in the study and were subdivided based on the clinical presentation into mild (n=226), moderate (n=27), severe (n=67), and asymptomatic (n=780) cases. The overall mortality rate was 4.9%. The ROC curve indicated that NLR is a better predictor of severe disease than other haematological parameters, with 89.3% Area Under the Curve (AUC) at the cut-off value of 2.81 with 80.6% sensitivity and 87.1% specificity. Multivariate analysis established that patients with NLR &gt;2.8 had higher odds (OR=19.809, 95% CI-10.159-38.622) of severe infection and mortality (HR=1.110, 95% CI-1.088-1.113). Kaplan-Meier curve showed a significant difference (p-value&lt;0.001) in the duration of hospital stay between patients with NLR &lt;2.8 (Mean=10.4 days) and NLR &gt;2.8 (13.1 days). Conclusion: Early identification of COVID-19 patients with severe disease is important to reduce mortality. Elevated NLR is associated with severe disease in Severe Acute Resiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. NLR &gt;2.8 in Indian population, may aid in identification of severe illness necessitating early access to intensive care unit and requirement of respiratory support.","Gurusamy, D.

Current diagnostic tests are based on the reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) method, the gold standard test that involves the amplification of viral RNA. However, the RT-qPCR assay has limitations in terms of sensitivity and quantification. In this study, we tested both qPCR and droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) to detect low amounts of viral RNA. The cycle threshold (CT) of viral RNA by RT-PCR significantly varied according to the sequence of primer and probe sets with in vitro transcript (IVT) RNA or viral RNA as templates, whereas the copy number of viral RNA by ddPCR was effectively quantified with IVT RNA, cultured viral RNA, and RNA from clinical samples. Furthermore, the clinical samples were assayed via both methods, and the sensitivity of the ddPCR was determined to be significantly higher than RT-qPCR. These findings suggest that ddPCR could be used as a highly sensitive and compatible diagnostic method for viral RNA detection.","Park, Changwoo; Lee, Jina; Hassan, Zohaib ul; Ku, Keun Bon; Kim, Seong Jun; Kim, Hong Gi; Park, Edmond Changkyun; Park, Gun-Soo; Park, Daeui; Baek, Seung-Hwa; Park, Dongju; Lee, Jihye; Jeon, Sangeun; Kim, Seungtaek; Lee, Chang-Seop; Yoo, Hee Min; Kim, Seil",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.03.186304,177

This paper aims to study a subset of these solutions for their utilization of design for AM (DfAM) techniques and investigate the effects of DfAM utilization on the creativity and manufacturing efficiency of these solutions.Design/methodology/approachThis study compiled 26 COVID-19-related solutions designed for AM spanning three categories: (1) face shields (N = 6), (2) face masks (N = 12) and (3) hands-free door openers (N = 8). These solutions were assessed for (1) DfAM utilization, (2) manufacturing efficiency and (3) creativity. The relationships between these assessments were then computed using generalized linear models to investigate the influence of DfAM utilization on manufacturing efficiency and creativity.FindingsIt is observed that (1) unique and original designs scored lower in their AM suitability, (2) solutions with higher complexity scored higher on usefulness and overall creativity and (3) solutions with higher complexity had higher build cost, build time and material usage. These findings highlight the need to account for both opportunistic and restrictive DfAM when evaluating solutions designed for AM. Balancing the two DfAM perspectives can support the development of solutions that are creative and consume fewer build resources.Originality/valueDfAM evaluation tools primarily focus on AM limitations to help designers avoid build failures. This paper proposes the need to assess designs for both, their opportunistic and restrictive DfAM utilization to appropriately assess the manufacturing efficiency of designs and to realize the creative potential of adopting AM.","Prabhu, Rohan Masia Jordan Scott Berthel Joseph T.; Meisel, Nicholas Alexander Simpson Timothy W.",Rapid Prototyping Journal,https://doi.org/10.1108/rpj-11-2020-0297,177

When the choices of vaccines are many, the decision-making becomes difficult. General public resorts to the media and news, which talks about efficacies of various vaccines as observed for COVID-19. In this paper, for the first time, a concise mathematical framework for analyzing the efficacy of vaccines is introduced based on the standard definition of vaccine efficacy. The framework is then generalized to incorporate multi-variants. Finally, we introduce the idea of combined efficacy to characterize a vaccine efficacy as obtained from various clinical trials carried out across the world for Covid-19. We show that the efficacy reported by vaccine manufacturers from clinical trial data need not always directly translate to percentage efficacy. The efficacy of a vaccine is inherently a spatio-temporal statistical measure that characterizes a vaccine, which depends on the geographical location, the sample size, and the time of the clinical trials. Here, the dependence of efficacy on spatio-temporal parameters is expounded in detail, using hypothetical clinical trials conducted for different regions at different time intervals using real-world data.","Roy, D.; Chakravortty, D.; Basu, S.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.07.19.21260758v1?rss=1,177

Both conditions occur in low-income countries, which primarily use viral vector or inactivated virus vaccine technologies. However, few VE analyses have been conducted in such countries, and most lack the power to evaluate effectiveness in subgroups, such as the elderly. Methods The present retrospective cohort study evaluated the effectiveness of Vaxzevria and CoronaVac vaccines for COVID-19-related infection in 60,577,870 Brazilian vaccinees from January 18 to June 30, 2021. Study outcomes included documented infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), Covid-19-related hospitalization, ICU admission and death. We estimated VE for each outcome as one minus the hazard ratio using Cox regression adjusted for age, sex, Brazilian deprivation index, and month/region of dose administration. Results Vaccination with Vaxzevria or CoronaVac was found to be effective against SARS-CoV-2 infection and highly effective against hospitalization, ICU admission and death in individuals up to 79 years. From 80-89 years of age, 91.2 (95CI: 89.1-92.9) VE against death was seen in Vaxzevria-vaccinated individuals versus 67.3 (95CI: 63.6-70.6) for Coronvac. Above 90 years, 70.5 (95CI: 51.4-82.1) protection was conferred to Vaxzevria-vaccinated individuals versus 35.4 (95CI: 23.8-45.1) in Coronavac-vaccinated individuals Conclusions Both vaccines demonstrated overall effectiveness against severe COVID-19 up to 80 years of age. Our results suggest that individuals aged 90 years or older may benefit from an expedited third booster dose. Ongoing evaluations, including any additional vaccines authorized, are crucial to monitoring long-term vaccine effectiveness.","Cerqueira-Silva, T.; Oliveira, V. d.

Conventional approaches to sequence analysis are based on sequence alignment, which is neither scalable to large-scale datasets due to computational inefficiency nor adaptive to next-generation sequencing (NGS) data. Alignment-free approaches are typically used as computationally effective alternatives yet still suffering the high demand of memory consumption. One desirable sequence comparison method at large-scale requires succinctly-organized sequence data management, as well as prompt sequence retrieval given a never-before-seen sequence as query. Results In this paper, we proposed a novel approach, referred to as SAINT, for efficient and accurate alignment-free sequence comparison. Compared to existing alignment-free sequence comparison methods, SAINT offers advantages in two aspects: (1) SAINT is a weakly-supervised learning method where the embedding function is learned automatically from the easily-acquired data; (2) SAINT utilizes the non-linear deep learning-based model which potentially better captures the complicated relationship among genome sequences. We have applied SAINT to real-world datasets to demonstrate its empirical utility, both qualitatively and quantitatively. Considering the extensive applicability of alignment-free sequence comparison methods, we expect SAINT to motivate a more extensive set of applications in sequence comparison at large scale.

Variations in the metabolic reaction to SARS-CoV-2 infection could explain the striking differences in the susceptibility to infection and the risk of severe disease. Here, we used untargeted metabolomics to examine novel metabolic pathways related to SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility and COVID-19 clinical severity using capillary electrophoresis coupled to a time-of-flight mass spectrometer (CE-TOF-MS) in plasma samples. We included 27 patients with confirmed COVID-19 early after symptom onset who were prospectively followed and 29 healthcare workers heavily exposed to SARS-CoV-2 but with low susceptibility to infection (‘nonsusceptible’). We found that the metabolite profile was predictive of the study group. We identified a total of 55 metabolites as biomarkers of SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility or COVID-19 clinical severity. We report the discovery of new plasma biomarkers for COVID-19 that provide mechanistic explanations for the clinical consequences of SARS-CoV-2, including mitochondrial and liver dysfunction as a consequence of hypoxemia (citrulline, citrate, and BAIBA), energy production and amino acid catabolism (L-glycine, L-alanine, L-serine, L-proline, L-aspartic acid and L-histidine), endothelial dysfunction and thrombosis (citrulline, L-ADMA, 2-AB, and Neu5Ac), and we found interconnections between these pathways.

179436,The Editor’s Note: A new day for young children?,2021,"Introduction There have been longstanding concerns regarding an increased risk of suicide amongst healthcare workers. The Covid-19 pandemic has placed an additional burden on staff, yet few studies have investigated the impact of the pandemic on their risk of suicide and self-harm. We aimed to investigate the cumulative incidence, prevalence and correlates of suicidal ideation, suicide attempts and non-suicidal self-injury amongst healthcare workers during the Covid-19 pandemic. Methods and Analysis NHS Check is an online survey that was distributed to all staff (clinical and non-clinical), students, and volunteers in 18 NHS Trusts across England during the Covid-19 pandemic. Data collected in wave 1 (collected between April 2020 and January 2021) and wave 2 (collected 6-month after wave 1) will be analysed. The full cohort of wave 1 participants will be weighted to represent the age, sex, ethnicity, and roles profile of the workforce at each Trust, and the weighted prevalence and cumulative incidence of suicidal ideation, suicide attempts and non-suicidal self-injury will be described. Two-level random effects logistic regression models will be used to investigate the relationship between suicidal behaviour and self-harm, and demographic characteristics (age, sex, ethnicity) and workplace factors (concerns regarding access to personal protective equipment, re-deployment status, moral injury, confidence around raising and the management of safety concerns, support by supervisors or managers, satisfaction with standard of care provided). Results will be stratified by role (clinical/non-clinical).","Padmanathan, P.; Lamb, D.; Scott, H.; Wessely, S.; Moran, P.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.09.16.21263255v1?rss=1,177

An extensive search of all materials related to the topic was carried out in the PubMed search engine and National Medical Council Website, and a total of 15 studies similar to the current study objectives were selected based on the suitability with the current review objectives. In order to ensure that students actively participate in their learning and eventually progress from one professional year to the next one, the regulatory body has formulated eligibility criteria for the students to appear in summative assessments. Although attendance policy tends to have a significant influence on reducing the unnecessary absenteeism in the class, it cannot be conclusively said that the best learning occurs while students are physically attending the class. A student can be asked to mandatory attend those sessions wherein the content cannot be perfected by reading material. To conclude, the clause of meeting attendance norms for being eligible for the summative assessment is a must in many ways to ensure that students remain involved in their learning process. However, there is a definite scope to modify the attendance norms depending on the type of sessions and whether the proposed knowledge or skills can be acquired within the four walls of a class or by the students on their own.","Shrivastava, S.

Design/methodology/approach A qualitative approach was adopted involving semi-structured interviews with 24 care leavers 18-25 years old from across the region. Interviews were conducted remotely online or by telephone and explored young people's lived experiences during the pandemic including their views on the formal support services and how best to provide ongoing for support care leavers during the pandemic. Findings Study findings highlight how known adversities for care leavers are exacerbated during the pandemic, having a detrimental impact, particularly on their emotional well-being. The response of the state as a corporate parent in mitigating the impact of the pandemic was found to be inadequate;with a need for much clearer communication, transparent and prompt decision-making and targeted specialist mental health services. The account given by the young people also highlighted the importance of participation and relationship-based practice to build on the young people's resilience in the context of high levels of social isolation and limited access to informal support systems. Originality/value This research, based on the views of care experienced young people themselves, is the first study in Northern Ireland to report on the impact of the Covid 19 pandemic on care leaving. As such it makes a contribution to this emerging international field of study and, given the persistence of the pandemic, provides empirical findings and a social justice perspective of ongoing relevance to policy and practice with young people leaving care.","Kelly, B.; Walsh, C.; Pinkerton, J.; Toal, A.",Journal of Childrens Services,https://doi.org/10.1108/jcs-05-2021-0022,177

Companies utilize consumers’ trust and loyalty toward bloggers to effectively contact them. Hence, bloggers play a crucial role in the hotel industry. No past study has researched blogger selection by hotel managers. In this study, an innovative mixed multiple-criteria decision-making (MCDM) model including importance-performance analysis (IPA), analytic hierarchy process (AHP), and technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) is established to assist hotel managers in selecting bloggers. We firstly collect the selection criteria via interviews with hotel managers and a review of literature on blogger selection. Messages with stick are understood, remembered, and have an enduring influence on opinions and behavior. Hence, we also introduce the concept of stick to the selection criteria. Based on IPA and the literature review, a hierarchical structure for blogger selection is constructed.

We used these telescopes to study the \uchiir G43.89--0.78. The morphological study at arcminute scales using NVSS and \textit{Spitzer} data shows that this region is similar to those observed in the \textit{ bubble--like} structures revealed by \textit{Spitzer} observations. With this result, and including a physical characterization based on 3.6 cm data, we suggest G43.89--0.78 be classified as an \uchiir with Extended Emission because it meets the operational definition given in this paper comparing radio continuum data at 3.6 and 20~cm. For the ultra-compact component, we use VLA data to obtain physical parameters at 3.6~cm confirming this region as an \uchii region.

181561,A Compass During the Storm: Offering Students Critical Rigor for Polarizing Times,2021,"Abstract Background: Bacterial co-infections are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality during viral infections including COVID-19. Systematic testing of COVID-19 patients having bacterial co-infections is essential to select the correct antibiotic for treatment in order to reduce mortality and also prevent spread of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). The present study aims to evaluate the prevalence, demographic parameters, antibiotic sensitivity patterns and outcomes in hospitalized COVID-19 patients with bacterial co-infections. Methods: A total of 1019 COVID-19 patients were selected for the study. We analyzed the prevalence, antibiotic sensitivity pattern and clinical outcomes in COVID-19 patients having bacterial co-infections. Results: Out of a total 1019 COVID-19 patients screened, 5.2% of patients demonstrated clinical signs of bacterial co-infection. Bacteremia was found in majority of the patients followed by respiratory and urinary infections. Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella spp. were most common isolates among the Gram-negative and Coagulase-negative Staphylococci (CONS) and Staphylococcus aureus among the Gram-positive bacterial infections. Antibiotic sensitivity profiling revealed that colistin, imipenem and fosfomycin were the most effective drugs against the Gram-negative isolates while vancomycin, teicoplanin and doxycycline against the Gram-positive isolates. Analysis of clinical outcomes revealed that the mortality rate was higher (39%) among the patients with bacterial co-infections as compared to the group without co-infection (17%). Conclusions: This study reveals that the rate of bacterial co-infections is significantly increasing among COVID-19 patients and leading to increase in mortality. Systematic testing of bacterial co-infections is therefore essential in COVID-19 patients for better clinical outcomes and to reduce AMR.","Pathak, A.; Singh, S.; Patel, S.

181841,Atrx deletion in neurons leads to sexually-dimorphic dysregulation of miR-137 and spatial learning and memory deficits,2019-04-13,"Timely and reliable information about crop management, production, and yield is considered of great utility by stakeholders (e.g., national and international authorities, farmers, commercial units, etc.) to ensure food safety and security. By 2050, according to Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) estimates, around 70% more production of agricultural products will be needed to fulfil the demands of the world population. Likewise, to meet the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), especially the second goal of “zero hunger”, potential technologies like remote sensing (RS) need to be efficiently integrated into agriculture. The application of RS is indispensable today for a highly productive and sustainable agriculture. Therefore, the present study draws a general overview of RS technology with a special focus on the principal platforms of this technology, i.e., satellites and remotely piloted aircrafts (RPAs), and the sensors used, in relation to the 5th industrial revolution. Nevertheless, since 1957, RS technology has found applications, through the use of satellite imagery, in agriculture, which was later enriched by the incorporation of remotely piloted aircrafts (RPAs), which is further pushing the boundaries of proficiency through the upgrading of sensors capable of higher spectral, spatial, and temporal resolutions. More prominently, wireless sensor technologies (WST) have streamlined real time information acquisition and programming for respective measures. Improved algorithms and sensors can, not only add significant value to crop data acquisition, but can also devise simulations on yield, harvesting and irrigation periods, metrological data, etc., by making use of cloud computing. The RS technology generates huge sets of data that necessitate the incorporation of artificial intelligence (AI) and big data to extract useful products, thereby augmenting the adeptness and efficiency of agriculture to ensure its sustainability. These technologies have made the orientation of current research towards the estimation of plant physiological traits rather than the structural parameters possible. Futuristic approaches for benefiting from these cutting-edge technologies are discussed in this study. This study can be helpful for researchers, academics, and young students aspiring to play a role in the achievement of sustainable agriculture.","Martos, Vanesa Ahmad Ali Cartujo Pedro Ordoñez Javier",Applied Sciences,https://doi.org/10.3390/app11135911,177

We examined: 1) the impact of COVID-19 on cancer-related health care, and 2) patients' most prominent COVIDrelated concerns. Methods: From Sept-Dec 2020, 502 cancer patients completed an online survey about disruptions in cancer-related health care (types and causes of disruptions and length of health care delays). COVID-related concerns (e.g., accessing basic and medical needs, financial concerns, psychosocial impact) were assessed via 25 items rated not at all to extremely concerning, or not applicable. Group differences were examined with Pearson ChiSquare. Sample: 75% women, 82% White, age range 20-88 years (M = 60, SD = 12.1);61% in remission, 16% experiencing cancer relapse, 13% experiencing cancer for the first time;current stage: 40% metastatic, 25% localized, 35% no stage/don't know;time since diagnosis range 0-36 years (M = 8.8, SD = 7.0);primary cancer diagnoses: 29% breast, 27% blood cancers, 6% prostate, 5% lung, 5% colorectal, and 28% other;47% currently in treatment. 49% were tested for COVID-19, 3% tested positive. Results: 40% (n = 200) reported a disruption in cancer-related health care: of these, 34% reported disruption in imaging services, 30% lab service, 26% routine screening, 25% supportive services, 12% treatment session (including 46% chemotherapy, 13% radiation, 13% hormone therapy, 4% surgery), and 14% other disruption, with 10% reporting delay in cancer diagnosis. Nearly half with care delays reported a delay of 2-3 months (18%) or 3+ months (30%), with 3+ months delays occurring most often for routine screenings (40%) and supportive services (37%). Primary causes for disruptions included clinicians recommending the delay (46%) and patient fear of contracting COVID-19 via in person care (31%). The top 3 areas of COVID-19- related concerns (somewhat to extremely concerned) were: 1) others not following safety recommendations e.g., wearing masks (85%), 2) getting COVID-19 due to a weakened immune system (76%), and 3) worrying about loved ones' health (73%). Those in remission less frequently experienced delay in care (35%) than those with first time cancer (50%) or relapse (51%, χ2 = 10.5, p &lt; .05), and those in current treatment more frequently experienced delay in care (44%) than those not in treatment (36%, χ2 = 3.5, p &lt; .10). Conclusions: Findings highlight the substantial impact of COVID-19 on cancer care, across various forms of care needs and health services. Patients experiencing cancer for the first time, a cancer relapse, or those undergoing treatment reported high levels of delays, with many delays in excess of 3 months. Given the unique impact of COVID-19 to cancer patients, these results highlight opportunities for care service delivery improvements as the health care community navigates competing priorities of patient safety and care quality.","Fortune, E.

187922,COVID TV-UNet: Segmenting COVID-19 Chest CT Images Using Connectivity Imposed U-Net.,2020-07-24,"INTRODUCTION The world-wide outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in the spring of 2003 highlighted the importance of reliable surveillance for infectious diseases. The aim of this investigation is to identify possibilities for the improvement of the German surveillance system based on the experiences made during the SARS epidemic 2003. METHODS The RKI has established two linked databases for the surveillance of SARS, to store case-based data on SARS and to keep a record of inquiries by the public health system. Based on these data we evaluated the information flow for the surveillance of SARS mainly qualitatively. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION With occurrence of the first SARS case in Germany a nationwide surveillance system for SARS was established. Since Germany was exclusively confronted with imported SARS cases, the surveillance system could fulfil the requirements. It is unclear, however, whether the current procedures are sufficient to manage larger epidemics of emerging diseases. For this task the public health system needs a uniform electronic information management system which allows rapid adaptation to the epidemic situation and is able to deal with a large amount of data.","Krause, G; Benzler, J; Porten, K; Buchholz, U; Claus, H; Ammon, A",Gesundheitswesen (Bundesverband der Arzte des Offentlichen Gesundheitsdienstes (Germany)),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14685924/,177

In 122 and 104 randomly collected health calves of 22 farms antibodies against BRSV and bovine adeno virus-types 5, 7 and 8 were determined. 50.1% of the necropsied calves were one and two weeks old. In this group in 40.2% rotavirus and in 19.0% coronavirus could be isolated. All over the calves the frequencies of isolated viruses were 13.3% for BVDV, 4.6% for BRSV, 3.2% for BHV-1, and 2.1% for PI-3. The percentages of positive findings for rota- and coronavirus increased up to 7 days after birth, and thereafter both decreased. The frequencies of BVDV and BRSV were higher in older groups. The frequency of PI-3 was low and remained constantly. Infections with rota-, corona- and with both viruses were accompanied by BVDV in 11.3, 5.3 and 14.3%, respectively. Against bovine adenoviruses and BRSV in the first 8 weeks and after 14 weeks of life in more than 70% of the calves antibodies were detected.","Lotthammer, K H; Ehlers, J",DTW.

192398,"Pneumonia: classification, diagnosis and nursing management.",2005,"T-cells expressing the RT6 surface alloantigen appear to perform important immunoregulatory functions in the rat. Diabetes-prone BB rats lack circulating RT6+ T-cells and spontaneously develop autoimmune diabetes mellitus and thyroiditis. The coisogenic diabetes-resistant BB rat does circulate RT6+ T-cells and is free of disease. Transfusions leading to engraftment of RT6+ T-cells prevent both diabetes and thyroiditis in the diabetes-prone rat. To investigate the absence of this subset in the lymphopenic BB rat, we used both molecular and biochemical procedures and made the following observations: 1) an mRNA encoding RT6 protein is present in diabetes-prone spleen cells; 2) nucleotide sequencing of this transcript reveals an intact coding sequence for the RT6.1 alloantigen; 3) sensitive chemiluminescent assay of diabetes-prone lymph node cell detergent extracts shows that diabetes-prone RT6 mRNA is translated in vivo; 4) quantitatively, diabetes-prone lymph node cells express < or = 10% of the RT6.1 protein found on similar numbers of diabetes-resistant BB cells; and 5) finally, we obtained evidence of an intact phosphatidylinositol linkage of the molecule to the cell surface and successfully immunoprecipitated the phosphatidylinositol-linked protein with DS4.23 monoclonal antibody, indicating that the RT6.1 antigen is correctly processed and folded in diabetes-prone lymph node cells. We conclude that the near total absence of RT6+ T-cells in the diabetes-prone BB rat is unlikely to be because of a defect in RT6 gene expression per se. Defects in RT6 gene regulation or other cellular defects leading to premature cell death in the T-cell lineage, alone or in combination, may instead be responsible.","Crisá, L; Sarkar, P; Waite, D J; Friedrich, F H; Koch-Nolte,; Rajan, T V; Mordes, J P; Handler, E S; Thiele, H G; Rossini, A A",Diabetes,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7683289/,177
195016,What Our Waiting Rooms Will Look Like: The New Normal.,2021-05-01,"The Paramyxoviridae family comprises of several genera that contain emerging or re-emerging threats for human and animal health with no real specific effective treatment available. Hendra and Nipah virus are members of a newly identified genus of emerging paramyxoviruses, Henipavirus. Since their discovery in the 1990s, henipaviruses outbreaks have been associated with high economic and public health threat potential. When compared to other paramyxoviruses, henipaviruses appear to have unique characteristics. Henipaviruses are zoonotic paramyxoviruses with a broader tropism than most other paramyxoviruses, and can cause severe acute encephalitis with unique features among viral encephalitides. There are currently no approved effective prophylactic or therapeutic treatments for henipavirus infections. Although ribavirin was empirically used and seemed beneficial during the biggest outbreak caused by one of these viruses, the Nipah virus, its efficacy is disputed in light of its lack of efficacy in several animal models of henipavirus infection. Nevertheless, because of its highly pathogenic nature, much effort has been spent in developing anti-henipavirus therapeutics. In this review we describe the unique features of henipavirus infections and the different strategies and animal models that have been developed so far in order to identify and test potential drugs to prevent or treat henipavirus infections. Some of these components have the potential to be broad-spectrum antivirals as they target effectors of viral pathogenecity common to other viruses. We will focus on small molecules or biologics, rather than vaccine strategies, that have been developed as anti-henipaviral therapeutics.","Vigant, Frederic; Lee, Benhur",Infectious disorders drug targets,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21488828/,177

198083,Outbreaks where food workers have been implicated in the spread of foodborne disease. Part 10. Alcohol-based antiseptics for hand disinfection and a comparison of their effectiveness with soaps.,2010,"A cellular protein, previously described as p55, binds specifically to the plus strand of the mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) leader RNA. We have purified this protein and determined by partial peptide sequencing that it is polypyrimidine tract-binding protein (PTB) (also known as heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein [hnRNP] I), a nuclear protein which shuttles between the nucleus and cytoplasm. PTB plays a role in the regulation of alternative splicing of pre-mRNAs in normal cells and translation of several viruses. By UV cross-linking and immunoprecipitation studies using cellular extracts and a recombinant PTB, we have established that PTB binds to the MHV plus-strand leader RNA specifically. Deletion analyses of the leader RNA mapped the PTB-binding site to the UCUAA pentanucleotide repeats. Using a defective-interfering RNA reporter system, we have further shown that the PTB-binding site in the leader RNA is critical for MHV RNA synthesis. This and our previous study (H.-P. Li, X. Zhang, R. Duncan, L. Comai, and M. M. C. Lai, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 94:9544-9549, 1997) combined thus show that two cellular hnRNPs, PTB and hnRNP A1, bind to the transcription-regulatory sequences of MHV RNA and may participate in its transcription.","Li, H P; Huang, P; Park, S; Lai, M M",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9847386/,177

In this retrospective observational study we describe the clinical features and the evolution of SARS CoV-2-related disease in 19 patients of our Pesaro and Fano facilities, where incidence and mortality of the epidemic were among the highest in Italy. A total of 176 patients were undergoing chronic treatment, 153 hemodialysis and 23 peritoneal dialysis. The incidence of infection was 10,8%, with 84% needing hospitalization and mortality amounting to 53%. The most frequent onset symptom was fever (84,2%) and the most used therapy was an association of low molecular weight heparin and hydroxychloroquine (57,9%). Comparing the deceased and survivor populations we noticed significant differences in age and presence of cardiopathy for what concerns anamnestic data and in fatigue and dyspnea in terms of clinical presentation. LDH and CPK resulted highest among deceased patients, while the use of enoxaparin was more frequent in survivors. By observing contagions over time, we also noticed that most of the cases, and the ones with worse clinical condition and outcome, all occurred in the early stage of the epidemic and in particular within the first 20 days from the implementation and codification of the measures to prevent its spread, the only modifiable factor that had an unmistakable effect on the evolution of events.","Silvestri, Cristina; Di Stante, Silvio; Bertuzzi, Veronica; Martello, Mauro; Palladino, Marco; Grabocka, Xhensila; Kulurianu, Hrissanthi; Manenti, Flavia; Pizzolante, Francesca; Cardillo, Assunta; Francioso, Angelo; Paci Della Costanza, Osmy; Valentini, Chiara; Di Luca, Marina",Giornale italiano di nefrologia : organo ufficiale della Societa italiana di nefrologia,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33295704/,177
200934,Research and development of medical/nursing care support system using Radar sensing technology and Hybrid WSN,2020,"Bromoethane is an alkylating agent used primarily as a chemical intermediate in various organic syntheses. In toxicology and carcinogenesis studies, groups of F344/N rats and B6C3F1 mice of each sex received whole-body exposure to bromoethane (greater than 98% pure) once for 4 hours or for 6 hours per day, 5 days per week, for 14 days, 14 weeks, or 2 years. Genetic toxicology studies were conducted in Salmonella typhimurium and Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. Single-Exposure, Fourteen-Day, and Fourteen-Week Studies: Single-exposure inhalation studies were conducted in rats and mice at target concentrations of 625, 1,250, 2,500, 5,000, or 10,000 ppm bromoethane. All rats exposed to 10,000 ppm bromoethane and 3/5 female rats exposed to 5,000 ppm died before the end of the single-exposure studies. All mice exposed to 5,000 or 10,000 ppm bromoethane and 2/5 female mice exposed to 1,250 ppm died before the end of the studies. Fourteen-day inhalation studies were conducted in rats and mice at target concentrations of 0, 250, 500, 1,000, 2,000, or 4,000 ppm bromoethane. All rats and mice exposed to 2,000 or 4,000 ppm died before the end of the 14-day studies. Final mean body weights of exposed and control rats were similar. Fourteen-week inhalation studies were conducted in rats and mice at target concentrations of 0, 100, 200, 400, 800, or 1,600 ppm bromoethane. Four of 10 male and 2/10 female rats exposed to 1,600 ppm died before the end of the 14-week studies. The final mean body weights of rats exposed to 1,600 ppm were lower than the initial mean body weights. Compound-related lesions observed in rats at 1,600 ppm, but not at lower concentrations, included minimal atrophy of the thigh muscle, minimal-to-moderate multifocal mineralization in the cerebellum of the brain, minimal-to-severe hemosiderosis of the spleen, marked atrophy of the testis, and minimal-to- mild atrophy of the uterus. The effects in the testis and uterus are probably due to chemical-related loss in body weight during the studies. In mice, compound-related deaths included 3/10 male and 1/10 female mice exposed to 1,600 ppm, 1/9 males exposed to 800 ppm, and 1/10 males exposed to 400 ppm. The final mean body weights of male and female mice exposed to 1,600 ppm were about 15% lower than those of controls. Compound-related effects included atrophy of the uterus and involution of the ovary in females exposed to 1,600 ppm bromoethane. Based on these results, 2-year studies were conducted by exposing groups of 49 or 50 rats or mice of each sex to bromoethane at 0, 100, 200, or 400 ppm, 6 hours per day, 5 days per week. Body Weight and Survival in the Two-Year Studies: Mean body weights of exposed and control rats were generally similar throughout the studies. No significant differences in survival were observed between any groups of male rats (control, 17/49; 100 ppm, 26/50; 200 ppm, 27/50; 400 ppm, 21/50); survival of the 100-ppm group of female rats was greater than that of controls (19/50; 29/50; 24/49; 23/50), and the number of control and 400-ppm male rats and control female rats surviving to the end of the studies was low. Mean body weights of the 400-ppm group of male mice were up to 9% lower than those of controls throughout the study. Mean body weights of the 400-ppm group of female mice were generally 6%-16% lower than those of controls after week 29. No differences in survival were observed between any group of male mice (35/50; 37/50; 30/50; 34/50). The survival of the 400-ppm group of female mice was lower than that of controls at the end of the study (36/50; 37/50; 37/49; 23/49). Nonneoplastic and Neoplastic Effects in the Two-Year Studies: The incidences of pheochromocytomas or malignant pheochromocytomas (combined) of the adrenal medulla were increased in exposed male rats (control, 8/40; 100 ppm, 23/45; 200 ppm, 18/46; 400 ppm, 21/46). Granular cell neoplasms of the brain were seen in exposed male rats but not in controls (0/49; 3/50; 1/50; 1/50). A glioma, an astrocytoma, or an oligodendroglioma was seen in 3/50 male rats exposed to 100 p in 3/50 male rats exposed to 100 ppm. Gliomas were not observed in control female rats, but they occurred in exposed female rats with a significant positive trend (0/50; 1/50; 1/48; 3/50). The historical incidence of granular cell tumors in male F344/N rat chamber controls at the study laboratory is 0/297. The incidences of gliomas in the exposed female groups were not significantly greater than that in the controls and were within the historical incidence range for glial cell neoplasms for untreated controls in NTP studies (mean: 23/1,969, 1%; range: 0/50-3/50), but they exceeded the historical incidence range for chamber controls at the study laboratory (mean: 1/297, 0.3%; range: 0/50-1/50). Alveolar epithelial hyperplasia was increased in rats exposed to 400 ppm bromoethane (male: 3/48; 7/49; 7/48; 18/48; female: 5/50; 4/48; 5/47; 10/49). Alveolar/bronchiolar adenomas or carcinomas (combined) were seen in four male rats exposed to 200 ppm and in one exposed to 400 ppm. Alveolar/bronchiolar adenomas were observed in 3/49 female rats at 400 ppm but not at lower concentrations or in controls. The incidences in exposed male and female rats were not significantly greater than those in controls; however, the historical incidence in rat chamber controls for alveolar/bronchiolar adenomas or carcinomas (combined) at the study laboratory is 6/299 (2%) for males and 4/297 (1.3%) for females. The incidences of epithelial hyperplasia and squamous metaplasia of the nasal cavity were increased in rats exposed to 400 ppm. The incidence of suppurative inflammation of the nasal cavity was increased in exposed male rats, and the incidences of suppurative inflammation of the larynx and metaplasia of the olfactory sensory epithelium were increased in exposed male and female rats. An adenoma of the nose was seen in one 400-ppm male rat and in one 400-ppm female mouse. Suppurative inflammation and dilatation of the salivary gland ducts were observed at increased incidences in the 200- and 400-ppm groups of female rats. Animals were found to be positive for rat coronavirus/sialodacryoadenitis virus antibodies. The incidence of mammary gland neoplasms was significantly lower in female rats at 400 ppm than in controls (18/50; 15/50; 10/48; 7/50). Adenomas (0/50; 1/50; 1/47; 6/48), adenocarcinomas (0/50; 2/50; 3/47; 19/48), and squamous cell carcinomas (0/50; 1/50; 1/47; 3/48) of the uterus occurred in exposed female mice and not in control mice. The incidence of alveolar/bronchiolar neoplasms was greater in male mice at 400 ppm than in controls (adenomas or carcinomas, combined: 7/50; 6/50; 12/50; 15/50). Acute/chronic inflammation of the lung was observed at increased incidences in female mice at 200 and 400 ppm. Genetic Toxicology: Bromoethane, tested in a closed environment of a desiccator, was mutagenic in S. typhimurium strain TA100 with and without exogenous metabolic activation; it was not mutagenic in strain TA98. In cultured CHO cells, bromoethane induced sister chromatid exchanges (SCEs) but not chromosomal aberrations in both the presence and absence of exogenous metabolic activation. Conclusions: Under the conditions of these 2-year inhalation studies, there was some evidence of carcinogenic activity of bromoethane for male F344/N rats, as indicated by increased incidences of pheochromocytomas of the adrenal gland; neoplasms of the brain and lung may also have been related to exposure to bromoethane. For female F344/N rats, there was equivocal evidence of carcinogenic activity, as indicated by marginally increased incidences of neoplasms of the brain and lung. For male B6C3F1 mice, there was equivocal evidence of carcinogenic activity, based on marginally increased incidences of neoplasms of the lung. There was clear evidence of carcinogenic activity for female B6C3F1 mice, as indicated by neoplasms of the uterus.

201263,Key factors of development of electromobility among microentrepreneurs: A case study from Poland,2021,"OBJECTIVE To evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of specific immunotherapy (SIT) with standardized house dust mite (HDM) vaccine on allergic asthmatic patients. METHODS The investigation was a multicentre, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical study. 132 patients with mild to moderate asthma who were allergic to HDM, recruited from three hospitals of China (The First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical College, Shenyang General Military Hospital, Suzhou Children's Hospital), were randomly allocated to the active group (n = 66) or the control group (n = 66) respectively. The active group received SIT with a standardized depot Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus (Der p) extract absorbed to aluminium hydroxide (Alutard SQ, ALK-Abelló, Denmark), while the control group received a placebo containing histamine dihydrochloride by subcutaneous injections for 1 year. Treatment of each group was started from the initial concentration. Updosing was performed with weekly injections from four 10-fold dose-increase vials (active group: 100, 1,000, 10,000, 100,000 SQ-U/ml, control group: 0.01, 0.1, 1.0, 10 microg/ml. 100,000 SQ-U/ml of Der p extract contains 9.8 microg/ml of the majoy allergen Der p1). The single-dose was injected weekly with 0.2, 0.4, 0.8 ml of each concentration in turn from the preceding 3 vials, totally for 9 weeks. Subsequently, the dose with 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8 ml of the highest concentration was injected weekly from the 10th-14th week and a maintenance dose with 1 ml was reached at the 15th week. The dosing interval was then gradually increased to 2, 4, 6 weeks until the end of the first 26-weeks updosing phase (phase I, H(1)). Thereafter, the dosing continued at 6-week intervals for maintenance phase (phase II, H(2)) till the end of the complete treatment. The patient was observed for at least 30 minutes in the clinic after each injection. RESULTS A total of 132 subjects were randomized and 129 subjects (64 in the active group, 65 in the control group) completed the whole study. Dropouts included three females because of poor compliance, being afraid of the epidemic of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and emigration respectively. Both groups were comparable at baseline in all clinical and laboratory parameters. The mean daily symptom scores in 4-weekly began to diverge at the 29th-32nd week with the active group showing a significant lower scores (0.17 +/- 0.33) than the control group (0.39 +/- 0.74, Z = 2.031, P < 0.05) till the end of the study. Significant difference was found in average daily symptom scores between H(1) (0.29 +/- 0.39) and H(2) (0.19 +/- 0.27) in the active group (Z = 2.923, P < 0.01), while no significant difference was found between H(1) (0.45 +/- 0.62) and H(2) (0.40 +/- 0.68) in the placebo group (Z = 1.885, P > 0.05). There were significant differences in subjective judgement of the improvement about overall asthmatic symptoms, exacerbation severity and exacerbation frequency between the active group (96.9%, 95.3%, 95.4%) and the control group (80.0%, 75.4%, 83.1%) with the self-evaluation questionnaire (chi(2) = 13.246, 11.576, 16.204, all P < 0.01). The trend line of daily medication scores in weekly intervals showed a significant decline. The mean daily medication score of phase II (0.20 +/- 0.36) was significant lower than that of phase I (0.33 +/- 0.67, Z = 3.344, P < 0.01), whereas the control group did not show a significant difference between phase II (0.35 +/- 0.96) and phase I (0.32 +/- 0.95, Z = 0.744, P > 0.05). After 1-year treatment, no significant differences were found in morning and evening peak expiratory flow of predicted value (PEF%), forced expiratory volume in one second of predicted value (FEV(1)/FVC), forced vital capacity of predicted value (FVC%), forced expiratory volume in one second to forced vital capacity ratio (FEV(1)/FVC), provoking dose decreasing FEV(1) by 20% (PD(20)-FEV(1)) between the active group [(97 +/- 17)%, (98 +/- 18)%, (91 +/- 11)%, (98 +/- 9)%, (82 +/- 10)%, 2.35 (7.9) micromol] and the control group [(99 +/- 19)%, (100 +/- 19)%, (90 +/- 14)%, (99 +/- 13)%, (82 +/- 9)%, 1.80 (7.8) micromol] (t = 0.170 - 0.630, Z = 0.264, all P > 0.05). Skin index (SI) to Der p in the active group (1.2 +/- 0.5) was significantly lower than that of the control group (1.5 +/- 0.6) after treatment (t = 2.395, P < 0.05). There was no significant difference in the level of serum sIgE against Der p between groups, which was 76.80 (97.0) kU/L in active group and 66.50 (99.3) kU/L in the control group (Z = 0.232, P > 0.05). The frequency of systemic adverse reactions graded by guidelines based on the position paper of European Academy of Allergology and Clinical Immunology (EAACI), was 5.7% and 1.8% of the total injections in the active group and the control group, respectively. Although significant difference was found in adverse reactions between groups (chi(2) = 4.705, P < 0.05), all were mild or moderate. The majority occurred within 30 minute after injection and were controlled well with symptomatic therapy. No any severe systemic adverse reaction was shown in the study. CONCLUSION One year specific immunotherapy with standardized house dust mite (HDM) vaccine significantly improved symptoms and reduced medication use in mild to moderate allergic asthmatic patients. SIT also reduced skin prick test reactivity to Der p. Complying with the EAACI immunotherapy guidelines, SIT with standardized HDM vaccine was a safe treatment.","Wang, Hong-yu; Lin, Xiao-ping; Hao, Chuang-li; Zhang, Chun-qing; Sun, Bao-qing; Zheng, Jin-ping; Chen, Ping; Sheng, Jin-yun; Wu, Adrian; Zhong, Nan-shan",Zhonghua jie he he hu xi za zhi = Zhonghua jiehe he huxi zazhi = Chinese journal of tuberculosis and respiratory diseases,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17129496/,177
201367,Long short-term memory approach for coronavirus disease prediction,2021,"OBJECTIVE 2 hypotheses were tested: calves with acute, mild diarrhea digest lactose less efficiently than healthy calves, and they are in a catabolic state, which influences plasma glucose concentration after glucose absorption. DESIGN Clinical study; 2 treatments with 10 repetitions/treatment. ANIMALS 20 preruminant Brown Swiss and Simmental Red Holstein calves; 10 calves with mild diarrhea, and 10 age-matched healthy calves. PROCEDURE Blood metabolite and hormone concentrations were determined before and after an oral lactose load. Plasma xylose concentration was determined after an oral xylose load. III calves were tested 1 day after the onset of diarrhea. RESULTS Calves with diarrhea (cryptosporidia, coronavirus) had lower preprandial concentrations of plasma glucose, insulin-like growth factor 1, and 3,5,3-triiodothyronine (P < 0.01) and a higher concentration of free fatty acids (P < 0.03) than did healthy calves. After the oral lactose and xylose loads, blood galactose and plasma xylose concentrations were lower in ill calves (P = 0.10 and P = 0.07, respectively). In calves with diarrhea, there was a larger increase of plasma glucose concentration (P = 0.12) and a smaller increase of plasma insulin concentration (P = 0.04) above baseline values after lactose ingestion. CONCLUSIONS Lactose digestion is slightly impaired in calves with mild diarrhea. Calves with acute diarrhea are in a catabolic state and, therefore, respond with a larger increase of plasma glucose concentration to a given amount of absorbed glucose than do healthy calves. CLINICAL-RELEVANCE: Plasma glucose concentration is not a reliable measure for glucose absorption in animals that are in a catabolic state.","Gutzwiller, A; Blum, J W",American journal of veterinary research,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8712525/,177
201660,COVID-ABS: An agent-based model of COVID-19 epidemic to simulate health and economic effects of social distancing interventions,2020,"One of the hallmark findings in patients suffering from SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) is lymphopenia, which is the result of massive lymphocyte death. SARS-CoV (SARS coronavirus), a novel coronavirus that has been etiologically associated with SARS cases, is homologous with MHV (murine hepatitis coronavirus), and MHV small envelope E protein is capable of inducing apoptosis. We hypothesized that SARS-CoV encodes a small envelope E protein that is homologous with MHV E protein, thus inducing T-cell apoptosis. To test this hypothesis, a cDNA encoding SARS-CoV E protein was created using whole gene synthesis. Our results showed that SARS-CoV E protein induced apoptosis in the transfected Jurkat T-cells, which was amplified to higher apoptosis rates in the absence of growth factors. However, apoptosis was inhibited by overexpressed antiapoptotic protein Bcl-xL. Moreover, we found that SARS-CoV E protein interacted with Bcl-xL in vitro and endogenous Bcl-xL in vivo and that Bcl-xL interaction with SARS-CoV E protein was mediated by BH3 (Bcl-2 homology domain 3) of Bcl-xL. Finally, we identified a novel BH3-like region located in the C-terminal cytosolic domain of SARS-CoV E protein, which mediates its binding to Bcl-xL. These results demonstrate, for the first time, a novel molecular mechanism of T-cell apoptosis that contributes to the SARS-CoV-induced lymphopenia observed in most SARS patients.","Yang, Yu; Xiong, Zeyu; Zhang, Sheng; Yan, Yan; Nguyen, Justin; Ng, Bernard; Lu, Huifang; Brendese, John; Yang, Fan; Wang, Hong; Yang, Xiao-Feng",The Biochemical journal,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16048439/,177
201889,Online Law Journals as Legal Scholarship: a Survey of Faculty Perceptions,2021,"OBJECTIVE To assess the effectiveness of the Australian border entry screening program to detect arriving travellers with symptoms of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). DESIGN AND SETTING Descriptive study of outcomes of screening at Australian airports and seaports between 5 April 2003 and 16 June 2003. To determine the number of international travellers who were symptomatic on arrival in Australia but missed by screening, data were obtained on the number of arrivals screened and the number with symptoms (from the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service [AQIS]), as well as the number of people investigated for SARS (from the Australian SARS Case Register). RESULTS There were 1.84 million arrivals into Australia during the study period, and 794 were referred for screening to AQIS staff. Of these, the findings in four travellers were consistent with the World Health Organization case definition for SARS, and they were referred by the Chief Quarantine Officers to designated hospitals for further investigation. None of these people was confirmed to have SARS. One person reported as a probable SARS case acknowledged being symptomatic on arrival, but had been missed by border screening. CONCLUSIONS The low identification rate was attributed to the low prevalence of SARS, the use of exit screening by affected countries, and the subjective measures used in the screening process. With current knowledge about SARS, border screening should focus on educating incoming travellers, especially groups at high risk of transmitting the disease (the elderly and those with underlying chronic illnesses). Objective screening measures should be used during SARS outbreaks to prevent importation of the disease.","Samaan, Gina; Patel, Mahomed; Spencer, Jenean; Roberts, Leslee",The Medical journal of Australia,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14984341/,177
202985,Engaging children and parents in physically active maths sessions,2020,"The COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated both the positive and negative use, usefulness, and impact of digital technologies in public health. Digitalization can help advance and sustain the core functions of public health, including health promotion and prevention, epidemiological surveillance, and response to emergent health issues. Digital technologies are thus-in some areas of public discourse-presented as being both necessary and inevitable requirements to address routine and emergency public health issues. However, the circumstances, ways, and extent to which they apply remain a subject of critical reflection and empirical investigation. In this commentary, we argue that we must think through the use of digital technologies in public health and that their usefulness must be assessed in relation to their short- and long-term ethical, health equity, and social justice implications. Neither a sense of digital technological optimism and determinism nor the demands of addressing pressing public health issues should override critical assessment before development and implementation. The urgency of addressing public health emergencies such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic requires prompt and effective action, including action facilitated by digital technologies. Nevertheless, a sense of urgency cannot be an excuse or a substitute for a critical assessment of the tools employed.","Gómez-Ramírez, Oralia; Iyamu, Ihoghosa; Ablona, Aidan; Watt, Sarah; Xu, Alice X T; Chang, Hsiu-Ju; Gilbert, Mark",Can J Public Health,,177
203225,Small Millets for Enduring Food Security Amidst Pandemics,2020,"Pandemic influenza is a regularly recurring form of infectious disease; this work analyses its economic effects. Like many other infectious diseases influenza pandemics are usually of short, sharp duration. Human coronavirus is a less regularly recurring infectious disease. The human coronavirus pandemic of 2019 (COVID-19) has presented with seemingly high transmissibility and led to extraordinary socioeconomic disruption due to severe preventative measures by governments. To understand and compare these events, epidemiological and economic models are linked to capture the transmission of a pandemic from regional populations to regional economies and then across regional economies. In contrast to past pandemics, COVID-19 is likely to be of longer duration and more severe in its economic effects given the greater uncertainty surrounding its nature. The analysis indicates how economies are likely to be affected due to the risk-modifying behaviour in the form of preventative measures taken in response to the latest novel pandemic virus.","Verikios, George",Socio-Econ.

203260,Data-Driven Modeling for Different Stages of Pandemic Response,2020,"AIM: Convalescent Plasma (CP) therapy is of interest as no vaccine or specific treatment is available for emerging viruses such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 causing Covid-19. It was aimed to report the results of our patients who underwent CP in the treatment of Covid-19. METHODS: CP treatment was applied to 26 Covid-19 patients in intensive care unit who had quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction positive Sars-Cov-2 infection. Plasma was collected at least 14 days after complete recovery from patients who had mild or moderate infection with Sars-Cov-2 infection. The collected CP (200cc) were applied to severe Covid-19 patients. Laboratory values of patients just before CP and after 7 days were compared. RESULTS: There were no statistically significant differences in leukocyte, neutrophil, lymphocyte, platelet, CRP, ferritin, LDH, ALT, AST, sO2 and total bilirubin values just before and after 1 week of CP. A statistically significant difference was found between age and lymphocyte values of living and dying patients. The patients who died were determined to have older age (74,6 vs 61,85, p = 0,018) and more severe lymphopenia (0,47 vs 1,18, p = 0,001). CONCLUSION: CP therapy has the potential to provide immediate and promising treatment options before specific vaccines and treatments are developed. In early stage Covid-19 patients who do not need mechanical ventilation, CP treatment may be a curative treatment option.","Erkurt, Mehmet Ali; Sarici, Ahmet; Berber, Ilhami; Kuku, Irfan; Kaya, Emin; Özgül, Mustafa",Transfus Apher Sci,,177
203261,Data-driven modeling for different stages of pandemic response,2020-09-21,"The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) is an emergent disease that initially had no historical data to guide scientists on predicting/ forecasting its global or national impact over time. The ability to predict the progress of this pandemic has been crucial for decision making aimed at fighting this pandemic and controlling its spread. In this work we considered four different statistical/time series models that are readily available from the 'forecast' package in R. We performed novel applications with these models, forecasting the number of infected cases (confirmed cases and similarly the number of deaths and recovery) along with the corresponding 90% prediction interval to estimate uncertainty around pointwise forecasts. Since the future may not repeat the past for this pandemic, no prediction model is certain. However, any prediction tool with acceptable prediction performance (or prediction error) could still be very useful for public-health planning to handle spread of the pandemic, and could policy decision-making and facilitate transition to normality. These four models were applied to publicly available data of the COVID-19 pandemic for both the USA and Italy. We observed that all models reasonably predicted the future numbers of confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries of COVID-19. However, for the majority of the analyses, the time series model with autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) and cubic smoothing spline models both had smaller prediction errors and narrower prediction intervals, compared to the Holt and Trigonometric Exponential smoothing state space model with Box-Cox transformation (TBATS) models. Therefore, the former two models were preferable to the latter models. Given similarities in performance of the models in the USA and Italy, the corresponding prediction tools can be applied to other countries grappling with the COVID-19 pandemic, and to any pandemics that can occur in future.","Gecili, Emrah; Ziady, Assem; Szczesniak, Rhonda D",PLoS One,,177

203463,Research on forecasting coal bed methane demand and resource allocation system based on time series,2020,"Magnetic skyrmions are prime candidates as information carriers for spintronic devices due to their topological nature and nanometric size. However, unavoidable inhomogeneities inherent to any material leads to pinning or repulsion of skyrmions that, in analogy to biology concepts, define the phenotype of the skyrmion-defect interaction, generating complexity in their motion and challenging their application as future bits of information. Here, we demonstrate that atom-by-atom manufacturing of multi-atomic defects, being antiferromagnetic or ferromagnetic, permits the breeding of their energy profiles, for which we build schematically a Punnet-square. As established from first-principles for skyrmions generated in PdFe bilayer on Ir(111) surface, the resulting interaction phenotype is rich. It can be opposite to the original one and eventually be of dual pinning-repulsive nature yielding energy landscapes hosting multi-domains. This is dictated by the stacking site, geometry, size and chemical nature of the adsorbed defects, which control the involved magnetic interactions. This work provides new insights towards the development of disruptive device architectures incorporating defects into their design aiming to control and guide skyrmions.","Arjana, I Gede; Fernandes, Imara Lima; Chico, Jonathan; Lounis, Samir",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.05518v1.pdf,177

The text is an attempt to summarize the challenges of crisis e-learning from the perspective of the challenges faced by teachers in Poland in the period of March-December 2020. The article reveals a number of new phenomena not present in the literature in the context of e-learning implemented in an intuitive, non-linear way, without methodological support, and thus referred to as crisis e-learning. The aim of the research was to explore the characteristics of crisis e-learning in Poland from the perspective of teachers' experiences. Due to epidemiological limitations, the research area was narrowed down to cyberspace. This text presents the results of research relating to statements made by teachers posting in the largest Polish discussion group on education. The group currently consists of over four thousand people. The study uses an analysis of several thousand posts and then identifies and categorizes statements related to crisis e-learning along with a phenomenological interpretation. The analyses made it possible to identify seven categories of challenges attributed to crisis e-learning, such as: technical problems, use of non-standard solutions, the search for solutions to increase the effectiveness of e-learning, the transfer of proven applications and programmes, problems with students, problems with parents, and the modernisation of workstations. The data presented show teacher micro-worlds in the time of the pandemic in Poland. The article is a response to the need to understand the processes occurring in the Polish educational system under the influence of crisis events related to the pandemic.

So WS containing xanthate groups (XWS) was obtained. The XWS was characterized using elemental analysis, X-ray diffraction, infrared spectroscopy and adsorption property of XWS toward copper ions. The results showed that S was introduced into the surface of WS. The solution pH was in favor of Cu2+ adsorption at pH 5, while NaCl existing in solution was slightly favorable for adsorption. The adsorption kinetic followed the pseudo-second-order kinetic model, while the adsorption isotherm curve was well fitted using the Langmuir model. The adsorption capacity was 57.5 mg·g-1 from experiment. The process was entropy-produced, endothermic and spontaneous in nature. The column adsorption was performed and Yan model was good to predict the breakthrough curve.

217393,You're Fired! Donald Trump and the 2020 Congressional Elections,2021,"BackgroundA two-dose regimen of ChAdOx1 coronavirus disease 19 (Covid-19) vaccine with an inter-dose interval of three months has been implemented in many countries with restricted vaccine supply. However, there is limited evidence for the effectiveness of ChAdOx1 by dose in elderly populations in countries with high prevalence of the Gamma variant of severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2). MethodsWe conducted a test-negative case-control study to estimate the effectiveness of ChAdOx1 vaccine in adults aged 60 years or older during a Gamma-variant-associated epidemic in Sao Paulo state, Brazil, between 17 January and 2 July 2021. Cases and matched test-negative controls were individuals, identified from surveillance databases, who experienced an acute respiratory illness and underwent SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR testing. We used conditional logistic regression to estimate the effectiveness by dose against RT-PCR-confirmed Covid-19, Covid-19 hospitalization, and Covid-19-related death. Results61,164 individuals were selected into matched case-control pairs. Starting [≥]28 days after the first dose, adjusted effectiveness of a single dose of ChAdOx1 was 33.4% (95% CI, 26.4 to 39.7) against Covid-19, 55.1% (95% CI, 46.6 to 62.2) against hospitalization, and 61.8% (95% CI, 48.9 to 71.4) against death. Starting [≥]14 days after the second dose, the adjusted effectiveness of the two-dose schedule was 77.9% (95% CI, 69.2 to 84.2) against Covid-19, 87.6% (95% CI, 78.2 to 92.9) against hospitalization, and 93.6% (95% CI, 81.9 to 97.7) against death. ConclusionsCompletion of the ChAdOx1 vaccine schedule afforded significantly increased protection over a single dose against mild and severe Covid-19 outcomes in elderly individuals during widespread Gamma variant transmission.","Hitchings, Matt; Ranzani, Otavio T; Dorion, Murilo; D039, Tatiana Lang; Agostini,; Paula, Regiane Cardoso de; Paula, Olivia Ferreira Pereira de; Villela, Edlaine Faria de Moura; Torres, Mario Sergio Scaramuzzini; Oliveira, Silvano Barbosa de; Schulz, Wade; Almiron, Maria; Said, Rodrigo; Oliveira, Roberto Dias de; Silva, Patricia Vieira da; Araújo, Wildo Navegantes de; Gorinchteyn, Jean Carlo; Andrews, Jason R; Cummings, Derek A.T.; Ko, Albert; Croda, Julio",,,177

Methods: We extracted data on population movements from an internet company data set and the numbers of confirmed cases of COVID-19 from government sources. On 23 January 2020 all travel in and out of the city of Wuhan was prohibited to control the spread of the disease. We modelled two key factors affecting the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases in regions outside Wuhan by 1 March 2020: (i) the total the number of people leaving Wuhan during 20-26 January 2020; and (ii) the number of seed cases from Wuhan before 19 January 2020, represented by the cumulative number of confirmed cases on 29 January 2020. We constructed a regression model to predict the cumulative number of cases in non-Wuhan regions in three assumed epidemic control scenarios. Findings: Delaying the start date of control measures by only 3 days would have increased the estimated 30 699 confirmed cases of COVID-19 by 1 March 2020 in regions outside Wuhan by 34.6% (to 41 330 people). Advancing controls by 3 days would reduce infections by 30.8% (to 21 235 people) with basic control measures or 48.6% (to 15 796 people) with strict control measures. Based on standard residual values from the model, we were able to rank regions which were most effective in controlling the epidemic. Conclusion: The control measures in Wuhan combined with nationwide traffic restrictions and self-isolation reduced the ongoing spread of COVID-19 across China.","Yuan, Zheming; Xiao, Yi; Dai, Zhijun; Huang, Jianjun; Zhang, Zhenhai; Chen, Yuan",Bull World Health Organ,,177

RECENT FINDINGS: Recent ACDS Allergens of the Year may be particularly relevant to healthcare workers, including isobornyl acrylate, which is present in glucose sensors and propylene glycol present in hand cleansers and disinfectants. Lavender, limonene, and linalool, all of which are new additions to the ACDS Core Allergen Series, have been reported as causes for occupational ACD in massage therapists and aromatherapists. Isothiazolinone allergy continues to rise in both consumer and occupational settings. Finally, the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a wave of occupational ACD in healthcare workers to personal protective equipment, and revealed new potential allergens for individuals working from home. Occupational allergic contact dermatitis continues to exert a significant occupational disease burden. Remaining aware of the current trends in allergens may allow for earlier recognition, diagnosis, and treatment, subsequently helping our patients to work in healthier and safer environments.","Lee, Erica B; Lobl, Marissa; Ford, Aubree; DeLeo, Vincent; Adler, Brandon L; Wysong, Ashley",Curr Allergy Asthma Rep,,177

222371,THE WORLD ECONOMY: Global outlook overview,2020,"Epidemiologists model the dynamics of epidemics in order to propose control strategies based on pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical interventions (contact limitation, lock down, vaccination, etc). Hand-designing such strategies is not trivial because of the number of possible interventions and the difficulty to predict long-term effects. This task can be cast as an optimization problem where state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms such as deep reinforcement learning, might bring significant value. However, the specificity of each domain -- epidemic modelling or solving optimization problem -- requires strong collaborations between researchers from different fields of expertise. This is why we introduce EpidemiOptim, a Python toolbox that facilitates collaborations between researchers in epidemiology and optimization. EpidemiOptim turns epidemiological models and cost functions into optimization problems via a standard interface commonly used by optimization practitioners (OpenAI Gym). Reinforcement learning algorithms based on Q-Learning with deep neural networks (DQN) and evolutionary algorithms (NSGA-II) are already implemented. We illustrate the use of EpidemiOptim to find optimal policies for dynamical on-off lock-down control under the optimization of death toll and economic recess using a Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Removed (SEIR) model for COVID-19. Using EpidemiOptim and its interactive visualization platform in Jupyter notebooks, epidemiologists, optimization practitioners and others (e.g. economists) can easily compare epidemiological models, costs functions and optimization algorithms to address important choices to be made by health decision-makers.","Colas, C'edric; Hejblum, Boris; Rouillon, S'ebastien; Thi'ebaut, Rodolphe; Oudeyer, Pierre-Yves; Moulin-Frier, Cl'ement; Prague, M'elanie",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.04452v1.pdf,177
222561,Facing up to security and privacy in online meetings,2021,"Extragalactic foregrounds in temperature maps of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) severely limit the ability of standard estimators to reconstruct the weak lensing potential. These foregrounds are not fully removable by multi-frequency cleaning or masking and can lead to large biases if not properly accounted for. For foregrounds made of a number of unclustered point sources, an estimator for the source amplitude can be derived and deprojected, removing any bias to the lensing reconstruction. We show with simulations that all of the extragalactic foregrounds in temperature can be approximated by a collection of sources with identical profiles, and that a simple bias hardening technique is effective at reducing any bias to lensing, at a minimal noise cost. We compare the performance and bias to other methods such as""shear-only""reconstruction, and discuss how to jointly deproject any arbitrary number of foregrounds, each with an arbitrary profile. In particular, for a Simons Observatory-like experiment foreground-hardened estimators allow us to extend the maximum multipole used in the reconstruction, increasing the overall statistical power by $\sim 50\%$ over the standard quadratic estimator, both in auto and cross-correlation. We conclude that source hardening outperforms the standard lensing quadratic estimator both in auto and cross-correlation, and in terms of lensing signal-to-noise and foreground bias.","Sailer, Noah; Schaan, Emmanuel; Ferraro, Simone",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.04325v1.pdf,177

We outline the conditions of communication about coronavirus that contribute toward deleterious outcomes, including partisan cueing, conflicting science, downplayed threats, emotional arousal, fragmented media, and Trump's messaging. We suggest these have contributed toward divergent responses by media sources, partisan leaders, and the public alike, leading to different attitudes and beliefs as well as varying protective actions taken by members of the public to reduce their risk. In turn, these divergent communication phenomena will likely amplify geographic variation in and inequities in COVID-19 disease outcomes.

Recent studies suggest that aquatic biofilms can physically act as sorptive sponges of DNA. We took the opportunity from already available samples of stone biofilms and macroinvertebrates specimens collected in parallel at the same sites to test the capacity of biofilms to act as DNA samplers of macroinvertebrate communities in streams. Macroinvertebrate communities are usually studied with metabarcoding using the DNA extracted from their bodies bulk samples, which remains a time-consuming approach and involves the destruction of all individual specimens from the samples. The ability of biofilms to capture DNA was explored on 19 rivers sites of a tropical island (Mayotte Island, France). First, macroinvertebrate specimens were identified based on their morphological characteristics. Second, DNA was extracted from biofilms, and macroinvertebrate communities were targeted using a standard COI barcode. The resulting morphological and molecular inventories were compared. They provided comparable structures and diversities for macroinvertebrate communities when one is working with the unassigned OTU data. After taxonomic assignment of the OTU data, diversity and richness were no longer correlated. The ecological assessment derived from morphological bulk samples was conserved by the biofilms samples. We also showed that the biofilm method allows to detect a higher diversity for some organisms (Cnidaria), that is hardly accessible with the morphological method. The results of this study exploring the DNA signal captured by natural biofilms are encouraging. However, a more detailed study integrating more replicates and comparing the biodiversity signal based on both morphological and molecular bulk macroinvertebrate samples to the one captured by biofilms will be necessary. Better understanding how the DNA signal captured by natural biofilms represents the biodiversity of a given sampling site is necessary before considering its use for bioassessment applications.","Rivera, Sinziana F; Vasselon, Valentin; Mary, Nathalie; Monnier, Olivier; Rimet, Fréderic; Bouchez, Agnès",Sci Total Environ,,177
223850,Selecting fermentation products for food waste valorisation with HRT and OLR as the key operational parameters,2021,"BACKGROUND: The prevalence of exercise as an adjunct therapy to cancer treatments including chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and surgery is growing rapidly and has been shown to improve health outcomes, treatment completion rates, and quality of life in people affected by cancer. Given the complexity of delivering cancer services during coronavirus disease (COVID-19), many people who are undergoing cancer treatment are unable to access exercise services. This review aims to investigate: (1) the feasibility of exercise telehealth interventions for individuals diagnosed with cancer; and (2) the impact of exercise telehealth interventions for people affected by cancer on physical and psychosocial outcomes. METHODS/DATA SOURCES: The literature search was conducted in four electronic databases (CINAHL, Cochrane, Medline, and Psych Info) from January 1, 2010 until May 1, 2020. All peer-reviewed qualitative and quantitative studies were included irrespective of study design. Studies that investigated adults (aged &#8805;18 years) with a diagnosis of any cancer, irrespective of treatment type, cancer stage or primary/secondary nature of disease were included. RESULTS: Twenty-nine studies (a total of 3698 participants across the included studies) were synthesized. Across the included studies the interventions were broadly classified into four main areas of telehealth: web-based, mobile applications, SMS messaging, and telephone interventions. CONCLUSION: Participants across the studies showed good compliance, symptom relief and reported an overall positive experience using telehealth for exercise. There were no adverse events reported in these studies. Given the current COVID-19 pandemic, more research is required to assess the feasibility of telehealth platforms such as Zoom, Skype, Microsoft Teams, or FaceTime, and to determine the overall participant and exercise professional telehealth exercise delivery experience. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING PRACTICE: Telehealth uses telecommunications technology as a tool to deliver health care to populations with limited access to cancer care. Quality care of a person living with cancer requires multidisciplinary team-based care and telecommunications technology can support interprofessional care. This review has underscored that telecommunications is a critical tool in the delivery of cancer care to enable timely ongoing support for exercise interventions for those affected by cancer. It remains important for people affected by cancer to continue to engage in and maintain regular exercise under the guidance of qualified health professionals in keeping with evidence-based clinical guidelines.","Morrison, Kittani S; Paterson, Catherine; Toohey, Kellie",Semin Oncol Nurs,,177

Despite their efficacy in clinical trials, data on mRNA vaccine-induced immune responses are mostly limited to serological analyses. Here, we interrogated antibody and antigen-specific memory B cells over time in 33 SARS-CoV-2 naïve and 11 SARS-CoV-2 recovered subjects. SARS-CoV-2 naïve individuals required both vaccine doses for optimal increases in antibodies, particularly for neutralizing titers against the B.1.351 variant. Memory B cells specific for full-length spike protein and the spike receptor binding domain (RBD) were also efficiently primed by mRNA vaccination and detectable in all SARS-CoV-2 naive subjects after the second vaccine dose, though the memory B cell response declined slightly with age. In SARS-CoV-2 recovered individuals, antibody and memory B cell responses were significantly boosted after the first vaccine dose; however, there was no increase in circulating antibodies, neutralizing titers, or antigen-specific memory B cells after the second dose. This robust boosting after the first vaccine dose strongly correlated with levels of pre-existing memory B cells in recovered individuals, identifying a key role for memory B cells in mounting recall responses to SARS-CoV-2 antigens. Together, our data demonstrated robust serological and cellular priming by mRNA vaccines and revealed distinct responses based on prior SARS-CoV-2 exposure, whereby COVID-19 recovered subjects may only require a single vaccine dose to achieve peak antibody and memory B cell responses. These findings also highlight the utility of defining cellular responses in addition to serologies and may inform SARS-CoV-2 vaccine distribution in a resource-limited setting.","Goel, Rishi R; Apostolidis, Sokratis A; Painter, Mark M; Mathew, Divij; Pattekar, Ajinkya; Kuthuru, Oliva; Gouma, Sigrid; Hicks, Philip; Meng, Wenzhao; Rosenfeld, Aaron M; Dysinger, Sarah; Lundgreen, Kendall A; Kuri-Cervantes, Leticia; Adamski, Sharon; Hicks, Amanda; Korte, Scott; Oldridge, Derek A; Baxter, Amy E; Giles, Josephine R; Weirick, Madison E; McAllister, Christopher M; Dougherty, Jeanette; Long, Sherea; D039,; Andrea, Kurt; Hamilton, Jacob T; Betts, Michael R; Luning Prak, Eline T; Bates, Paul; Hensley, Scott E; Greenplate, Allison R; Wherry, E John",Sci. immunol,,177
224796,Fostering Holistic Ambitions in the Face of Growing Difficulty,2021,"BACKGROUND: Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel virus responsible for causing the novel coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19). OBJECTIVE: This article discusses the clinical manifestations of COVID-19 in pregnant patients, the effects of pregnancy on the course of COVID-19 disease, and the impact of COVID-19 on pregnancy outcomes. DISCUSSION: The physiological and mechanical changes associated with pregnancy increase maternal susceptibility to infections and complicate intubation and mechanical ventilation. The most common symptoms of COVID-19 in pregnant patients are cough and fever, although many infected individuals are asymptomatic. The majority of pregnant women diagnosed with COVID-19 disease have a mild course of illness and will recover without needing to deliver, but the risks of critical illness and need for mechanical ventilation are increased compared to the general population. Risk factors for death and severe disease include obesity, diabetes, and maternal age > 40 years. Women in their third trimester have the highest risk for critical illness, intensive care unit admission, and need for mechanical ventilation. Adverse fetal outcomes of maternal COVID-19 infection include increased risk of miscarriage, prematurity, and fetal growth restriction. Vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is possible but has not been conclusively proven. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 is a potentially deadly infection, but data are limited concerning the pregnant population. Pregnant patients appear to present similarly to the general population, with fever and cough being the most reported symptoms in studies. Knowledge of these presentations and outcomes can assist clinicians caring for these patients.","Boushra, Marina N; Koyfman, Alex; Long, Brit",Am. j. emerg. med,,177
224833,Forecasting of COVID19 per regions using ARIMA models and polynomial functions,2020,"The new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has been wreaking havoc all over the planet. In a precautionary measure, populations have been forced and kept under quarantine to contain the outbreak of the COVID-19 disease. The quarantine primary goal is to avoid the overload to the hospitals, which should be available for the care of COVID-19 patients. However, the virus does not have a uniform spread throughout the planet, and Brazil is no different. Although all the world's attention is now on the COVID-19 pandemic, there is no similar pattern of spread, and other diseases are still a real problem. Given the risks of transmission between patients and healthcare providers, there is a great challenge for healthcare institutions who must balance resources to assure safe care to patients and professionals while they take care of other disease patients, and perform surgical procedures that need to be carried out. Under such circumstances, as COVID-19 can also present pre- or asymptomatic transmission, it can be challenging to identify patients who are carrying and spreading the virus. Studies and information on mandatory testing for who are candidates to undergo elective surgery are scarce. Thus, the authors have reviewed the literature, and discuss the need to test these patients under the current context.","Silva, Leonardo Emilio; Cohen, Ricardo Vitor; Rocha, Jaime Luis Lopes; Hassel, Viviane Maria Carvalho; VON-Bahten, Luiz Carlos",Rev Col Bras Cir,,177

Levels of physical activity were assessed using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire. Paired sample t-tests or Wilcoxon signed-rank test were performed for statistical analysis. Results: Data from 76 participants were analyzed. Fifty-four participants were female (71.1%). The mean age was 42.7 years (range from 21.8 to 62.7) at baseline. About 75% of the participants met the recommendations on minimal physical activity, both before the COVID-19 pandemic and during the lockdown. Weak statistical evidence for a decline in total physical activity in metabolic equivalent of task minutes per week (MET min/week) was found (estimate = -292, 95% CI from - &#8734; to 74, p-value = 0.09), with no evidence for a decrease in the three types of activity: walking (estimate = -189, 95% CI from - &#8734; to 100, p-value = 0.28), moderate-intensity activity (estimate = -200, 95% CI from - &#8734; to 30, p-value = 0.22) and vigorous-intensity activity (estimate = 80, 95% CI from - &#8734; to 460, p-value = 0.74). Across the three categories ""high,"" ""moderate,"" and ""low"" physical activity, 17% of the participants became less active during the lockdown while 29% became more active. Conclusion: The COVID-19 pandemic did not result in a reduction in total physical activity levels among a sample of Swiss office workers during the first weeks of lockdown. Improved work-life balance and working times may have contributed to this finding. Clinical Trial Registration: www.ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04169646.

226172,Barrow holographic dark energy,2020-05-08,"OBJECTIVE: Thalamic circuit imbalance characterized by increased sensorimotor-thalamic connectivity and decreased prefrontal-thalamic connectivity has been consistently observed in adult-onset schizophrenia (AOS), though it is unclear if this pattern is also a feature of early-onset schizophrenia (EOS). If this is the case, thalamic circuit imbalance can be considered as a core mechanistic defect in schizophrenia, unconfounded by the age of onset. METHOD: Totally 116 adolescents with EOS (63 drug-naive EOS) and 55 matched healthy controls (HC) were recruited and underwent resting-state fMRI scans. To define the specific location of the thalamic subregions in thalamocortical circuit, 16 atlas-based thalamic subdivisions were employed in functional connectivity analysis. RESULTS: The EOS group showed increased sensorimotor-thalamic connectivity and decreased prefrontal-/cerebello-thalamic connectivity, consistent with AOS. Sensorimotor-thalamic hyperconnectivity was more prominent than prefrontal-thalamic hypoconnectivity, which was circumscribed to the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), in EOS. Of note, the EOS group specifically exhibited strengthened thalamic connectivity with the Salience Network (SN). Additionally, the EOS showed a more prominent disruption of the lateral thalamic nuclear connectivity. CONCLUSION: Thalamic dysconnectivity observed in the EOS extends the observations from adult patients. Sensorimotor-thalamic hyperconnectivity is critical for the expression of schizophrenia phenotype irrespective of the onset age, raising the possibility of aberrant, but accelerated functional network maturation in EOS. The specific thalamocortical dysconnectivity involving the SN and mPFC may underlie the distinctive features of multi-modal hallucinations and heightened emotional valence of psychotic seen in the EOS.","Zhang, Manqi; Palaniyappan, Lena; Deng, Mengjie; Zhang, Wen; Pan, Yunzhi; Fan, Zebin; Tan, Wenjian; Wu, Guowei; Liu, Zhening; Pu, Weidan",J.

228188,Fast news or fake news?: The advantages and the pitfalls of rapid publication through pre-print servers during a pandemic,2020,"BACKGROUND: The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has resulted in fewer emergency presentations of many acute medical and surgical conditions. The purpose of this study was to assess the severity of disease at presentation and quantify the change in number of presentations during this period. METHODS: This retrospective study includes all patients diagnosed with acute diverticulitis on abdominopelvic computerised tomography (CT) between March 1, 2020 and June 30, 2020, compared to the same period in 2019. Follow up scans on the index admission were excluded. Hinchey grade was assessed for all CT scans. Inflammatory markers were analysed, along with outcome measures including length of stay and mortality. RESULTS: Acute diverticulitis was diagnosed in 52 CT scans in the acute pandemic period - a decrease of 51.4%. Average age at presentation was unchanged (63.3 ± 14.3 vs. 62.8 ± 13.8, P = .848). The number of Hinchey II, III and IV presentations were significantly higher in the acute pandemic period (28.8% vs. 11.2%, P = .005) and significantly more emergency operations were carried out (7.69% vs. .93%, P = .04). Mortality was not significantly increased, nor were serum levels of C-reactive protein, white cell count and lactate. DISCUSSION: During the COVID-19 pandemic, fewer patients presented and were diagnosed with acute diverticulitis. A significantly greater proportion presented at a more advanced stage and required emergency surgery, suggesting late presentation. Our findings support the need for maintaining acute surgical services and the provision of early radiological and surgical input in patients presenting with signs and symptoms of acute diverticulitis in future pandemics.","Hossain, Naveed; Naidu, Vishnu; Hosny, Shady; Khalifa, Mohamed; Mathur, Pawan; Al Whouhayb, Maitham",Am Surg,,177

The purpose of this study was therefore to investigate people's experiences of WFH during the pandemic and to identify the main factors of advantages and disadvantages of WFH. Data from 29 European countries on the experiences of knowledge workers (N = 5748) WFH during the early stages of lockdown (11 March to 8 May 2020) were collected. A factor analysis showed the overall distribution of people's experiences and how the advantages and disadvantages of WFH during the early weeks of the pandemic can be grouped into six key factors. The results indicated that most people had a more positive rather than negative experience of WFH during lockdown. Three factors represent the main advantages of WFH: (i) work-life balance, (ii) improved work efficiency and (iii) greater work control. The main disadvantages were (iv) home office constraints, (v) work uncertainties and (vi) inadequate tools. Comparing gender, number of children at home, age and managers versus employees in relation to these factors provided insights into the differential impact of WFH on people's lives. The factors help organisations understand where action is most needed to safeguard both performance and well-being. As the data were collected amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, we recommend further studies to validate the six factors and investigate their importance for well-being and performance in knowledge work.","Ipsen, Christine; van Veldhoven, Marc; Kirchner, Kathrin; Hansen, John Paulin",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,177

In the United States, allocation frameworks are determined by each of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's 64 jurisdictions (50 states, the District of Columbia, five cities and eight territories). In this study, we analyzed vaccine allocation plans published by 8 November 2020, tracking updates through to 30 March 2021. We evaluated whether jurisdictions adopted proposals to reduce inequity using disadvantage indices and related place-based measures. By 30 March 2021, 14 jurisdictions had prioritized specific zip codes in combination with metrics such as COVID-19 incidence, and 37 jurisdictions (including 34 states) had adopted disadvantage indices, compared to 19 jurisdictions in November 2020. Uptake of indices doubled from 7 to 14 among the jurisdictions with the largest shares of disadvantaged communities. Five applications were distinguished: (1) prioritizing disadvantaged groups through increased shares of vaccines or vaccination appointments; (2) defining priority groups or areas; (3) tailoring outreach and communication; (4) planning the location of dispensing sites; and (5) monitoring receipt. To ensure that equity features centrally in allocation plans, policymakers at the federal, state and local levels should universalize the uptake of disadvantage indices and related place-based measures.","Schmidt, Harald; Weintraub, Rebecca; Williams, Michelle A; Miller, Kate; Buttenheim, Alison; Sadecki, Emily; Wu, Helen; Doiphode, Aditi; Nagpal, Neha; Gostin, Lawrence O; Shen, Angela A",Nat. med,,177

229838,Deep Learning Models for Predicting Severe Progression in COVID-19-infected Patients,2021,"OBJECTIVE: Dominant loss-of-function mutations in the gene encoding the lysosomal protein, progranulin, cause 5-10% of frontotemporal dementia cases. As progranulin undergoes secretion and endocytosis, a small number of progranulin-expressing cells can potentially supply the protein to the entire central nervous system. Thus, gene therapy is a promising treatment approach. METHODS: We evaluated adeno-associated viral vector administration into the cerebrospinal fluid as a minimally invasive approach to deliver the granulin gene to the central nervous system in a murine disease model and nonhuman primates. RESULTS: In progranulin-deficient mice, vector delivery into the lateral cerebral ventricles increased progranulin levels in the cerebrospinal fluid and normalized histological and biochemical markers of progranulin deficiency. A single vector injection into the cisterna magna of nonhuman primates achieved CSF progranulin concentrations up to 40-fold higher than those of normal human subjects and exceeded CSF progranulin levels of successfully treated mice. Animals treated with an adeno-associated virus serotype 1 vector exhibited progranulin expression fivefold higher than those treated with an AAV5 vector or the AAV9 variant, AAVhu68, apparently due to remarkably efficient transduction of ependymal cells. Progranulin expression mediated by adeno-associated viral vectors was well tolerated in nonhuman primates with no evidence of dose-limiting toxicity, even at vector doses that induced supraphysiologic progranulin expression. INTERPRETATION: These findings support the development of AAV1-based gene therapy for frontotemporal dementia caused by progranulin deficiency.","Hinderer, Christian; Miller, Rod; Dyer, Cecilia; Johansson, Julia; Bell, Peter; Buza, Elizabeth; Wilson, James M",,,177
229886,Kamino: Constraint-Aware Differentially Private Data Synthesis,2020-12-31,"BACKGROUND: Dysphagia appears to be common in patients with severe COVID-19. Information about the characteristics of dysphagia and laryngeal findings in COVID-19 patients treated in the intensive care unit (ICU) is still limited. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to evaluate oropharyngeal swallowing function and laryngeal appearance and function in patients with severe COVID-19. METHOD: A series of 25 ICU patients with COVID-19 and signs of dysphagia were examined with fiberendoscopic evaluation of swallowing (FEES) during the latter stage of ICU care or after discharge from the ICU. Swallowing function and laryngeal findings were assessed with standard rating scales from video recordings. RESULTS: Pooling of secretions was found in 92% of patients. Eleven patients (44%) showed signs of silent aspiration to the trachea on at least one occasion. All patients showed residue after swallowing to some degree both in the vallecula and hypopharynx. Seventy-six percent of patients had impaired vocal cord movement. Erythema of the vocal folds was found in 60% of patients and edema in the arytenoid region in 60%. CONCLUSION: Impairment of oropharyngeal swallowing function and abnormal laryngeal findings were common in this series of patients with severe COVID-19 treated in the ICU. To avoid complications related to dysphagia in this patient group, it seems to be of great importance to evaluate the swallowing function as a standard procedure, preferably at an early stage, before initiation of oral intake. Fiberendoscopic evaluation of swallowing is preferred due to the high incidence of pooling of secretion in the hypopharynx, silent aspiration, and residuals. Further studies of the impact on swallowing function in short- and long-term in patients with COVID-19 are warranted.","Osbeck Sandblom, Hanna; Dotevall, Hans; Svennerholm, Kristina; Tuomi, Lisa; Finizia, Caterina",PLoS One,,177

It is unclear what motivates solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients to participate and whether the games serve as an incentive for SOT recipients to increase their physical activity (PA) levels. OBJECTIVES: 1. To describe the characteristics of participants from past games and their motivation for attending and 2. to determine whether there was an interest in participating in goal-based, pre-games exercise training programs. METHODS: A web-based questionnaire was sent to adult SOT recipients who were members of the Canadian Transplant Association. The survey included questions about why participants attended, their PA levels, and their interest in a pre-games training program. RESULTS: Of the 157 participants, more were male than female; the 35-54-year-old age group was the most common; and 62% of respondents received a liver or kidney transplant. The most common reasons for participating in the games were to showcase health post-transplant, promote awareness of organ donation, sports competition, and social reasons. Sixty-five percent of respondents reported that they would be interested in an exercise program to be more physically prepared for the competition. CONCLUSION: Pre-games training programs could be developed to motivate participation and help participants achieve higher training intensities and foster social interaction. Directing resources to individuals who do not attend the games and to those who are not physically active should be considered.","D039,; Ambrosio, Andrea; Toulouse, Caroline; Bélanger-Marceau, Samuel; Savary, Simone; Mathur, Sunita; Segatto, Bianca; Hartell, David; Janaudis-Ferreira, Tania",Transplant. proc,,177

Methods: In this study, bioinformatics analysis was used to screen for target miRNAs from the open-access TCGA database. Transwell assays, Western blotting, and qRT-PCR analyses were used to detect cellular functions and gene expression in HCC cells and samples. A nude mouse tumorigenesis model was established to facilitate the observation of HCC progression. Other assays included luciferase reporter assays, IHC, and survival analysis. Results: We found that the identified miR-876 from TCGA was expressed at low levels in HCC cell lines and that low miR-876 expression was corrected with liver cirrhosis, tumor thrombus, and TNM stage. Further research revealed that miR-876 regulated cell invasion, EMT, and collagen expression by targeting POSTN expression. miR-876 and POSTN were inversely correlated in HCC samples and associated with EMT status and liver fibrosis in clinical HCC tissues. miR-876 inhibited the liver cancer progression in in vivo animal assays. Finally, both miR-876 and POSTN were risk factors for HCC survival, and HCC patients with combined low miR-876 and high POSTN expression had worse prognosis.

During COVID-19 pandemic time, many such patients could not be operated at early time because of the limitation of the medical resources, the risk of infection and redirection of medical attention to a severe infective health problem. METHODS: A search of electronic databases (PubMed, Medline, CINAHL, EMBASE and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials) with the keywords ""COVID"", ""COVID-19â³, ""SARS-COV-2"", ""Corona"", ""pandemic"", ""hip fracture"", ""trochanteric fracture"" and ""neck femur fracture"" revealed 64 studies evaluating treatment of hip fracture in elderly patients during COVID-19 pandemic time. The 30-day mortality rate, inpatient mortality rate, critical care/special care need, readmission rate and complications rate in both groups were evaluated. Data were analyzed using Review Manager (RevMan) V.5.3. RESULTS: After screening, 7 studies were identified that described the mortality and morbidity in hip fractures in both COVID-19 infected (COVID-19 +) and non-infected (COVID-19 -) patients. There were significantly increased risks of 30-day mortality (32.23% COVID-19 + death vs. 8.85% COVID-19 - death) and inpatient mortality (29.33% vs. 2.62%) among COVID-19 + patients with odds ratio (OR) of 4.84 (95% CI: 3.13-7.47, p < 0.00001) and 15.12 (95% CI: 6.12-37.37, p < 0.00001), respectively. The COVID-19 + patients needed more critical care admission (OR = 5.08, 95% CI: 1.49-17.30, p < 0.009) and they remain admitted for a longer time in hospital (MD = 3.6, 95% CI: 1.74-5.45, p = 0.0001); but there was no difference in readmission rate between these 2 groups.

236792,"Pestilence and Other Calamities in Civilizational Theory: Sorokin, McNeill, Diamond, and Beyond",2020,"The life-saving benefits of organ transplantation can be thwarted by allograft dysfunction due to both infectious and sterile inflammation post-surgery. Sterile inflammation can occur after necrotic cell death due to the release of endogenous ligands [such as damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) and alarmins], which perpetuate inflammation and ongoing cellular injury via various signaling cascades. Ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) is a significant contributor to sterile inflammation after organ transplantation and is associated with detrimental short- and long-term outcomes. While the vicious cycle of sterile inflammation and cellular injury is remarkably consistent amongst different organs and even species, we have begun understanding its mechanistic basis only over the last few decades. This understanding has resulted in the developments of novel, yet non-specific therapies for mitigating IRI-induced graft damage, albeit with moderate results. Thus, further understanding of the mechanisms underlying sterile inflammation after transplantation is critical for identifying personalized therapies to prevent or interrupt this vicious cycle and mitigating allograft dysfunction. In this review, we identify common and distinct pathways of post-transplant sterile inflammation across both heart and lung transplantation that can potentially be targeted.","Frye, C Corbin; Bery, Amit I; Kreisel, Daniel; Kulkarni, Hrishikesh S",Cell. mol. life sci,,177

Famotidine is a histamine-2 (H2) receptor antagonist which blocks the H2 receptors in the parietal cells, decreasing gastric acid secretion. Our review aims to study all the available scientific evidence on famotidine research outcomes systematically to introspect its clinical efficacy and probable mechanisms and clinical efficacy against SARS-CoV-2. METHODOLOGY: An electronic search of PubMed, Scopus and Google Scholar was performed using MeSH terms ""SARS CoV-2"" OR ""COVID-19"" AND""FAMOTIDINE"". Relevant informationwas extracted from studies reporting the efficacy of famotidine in COVID-19. RESULTS: We found a total of 32 studies, out of which only 14 were relevant and were included in our review.Molecular computational studies showed that famotidine selectively acts on viral replication proteases papain-like protease (PLpro) and 3-chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro). Additionally, it acts via inverse-agonism on the H2 receptors present in neutrophils and eosinophils which leads to inhibition of cytokine release. Clinical study findings have pointed toward significant improvements in COVID-19 patient-reported symptoms in non-hospitalized patients and reduction in intubation or death in critically ill patients associated with the usage of famotidine. However,in one of the studies,famotidine has failed to show any significant benefit in reducing mortality due to COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Famotidine has the potential to answer the ongoing global challenge owing to its selective action on viral replication. Additionally, clinical findings in COVID-19 patients support its efficacy to reduce clinical symptoms of COVID-19.We suggest that further optimally powered randomized clinical trials should be carried out to come up with definitive conclusions.","Chenchula, Santenna; Ray, Avik; Sadasivam, Balakrishnan",Drug Res (Stuttg),,177

While conventional laboratory tests such as quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), serology tests, and chest computerized tomography (CT) scan allow diagnosis of COVID-19, these tests are time-consuming and laborious, and are limited in resource-limited settings or developing countries. Point-of-care (POC) biosensors such as chip-based and paper-based biosensors are typically rapid, portable, cost-effective, and user-friendly, which can be used for COVID-19 in remote settings. The escalating demand for rapid diagnosis of COVID-19 presents a strong need for a timely and comprehensive review on the POC biosensors for COVID-19 that meet ASSURED criteria: Affordable, Sensitive, Specific, User-friendly, Rapid and Robust, Equipment-free, and Deliverable to end users. In the present review, we discuss the importance of rapid and early diagnosis of COVID-19 and pathogenesis of COVID-19 along with the key diagnostic biomarkers. We critically review the most recent advances in POC biosensors which show great promise for the detection of COVID-19 based on three main categories: chip-based biosensors, paper-based biosensors, and other biosensors. We subsequently discuss the key benefits of these biosensors and their use for the detection of antigen, antibody, and viral nucleic acids. The commercial POC biosensors for COVID-19 are critically compared. Finally, we discuss the key challenges and future perspectives of developing emerging POC biosensors for COVID-19. This review would be very useful for guiding strategies for developing and commercializing rapid POC tests to manage the spread of infections.Graphical abstract.","Rasmi, Yousef; Li, Xiaokang; Khan, Johra; Ozer, Tugba; Choi, Jane Ru",Anal Bioanal Chem,,177

The study sites were the Sao Paulo Macro Metropolis (MMP) and the Metropolitan Region of Vale do Paraiba/Litoral Norte (RMVPLN). The results indicated the absence of ICU beds in more than 2/3 of the municipalities, in addition to the concentration in regional hubs, for which the migration of COVID-19 cases from neighboring municipalities should be considered. The analysis with the SEIR model, performed for scenarios with and without social isolation, showed that the isolation adopted in the regions was able to postpone the collapse of the health infrastructure, reducing the reproduction rate of the disease. The simulations indicated a reproduction rate of 0.95 in order to avoid collapse in the health infrastructure for RMVPLN in the analyzed period. In addition, for future resilience, it is essential to address inequalities in terms of health infrastructure available for public and private access.","de Sousa, Wilson Cabral; Gonçalves, Demerval Aparecido; Cruz, Dafne Brito",Ambient.

Methods: The Negative Pressure Face Shield (NPFS) was previously reported as well tolerated with initial use on 30 patients. Diagnostic transnasal laryngoscopy was performed on an additional 108 consecutive patients who were evaluated by questionnaires and sequential pulse oximetry. Further study addressed operative transnasal potassium-titanyl-phosphate (KTP) laser laryngoscopy with biopsy done on four patients employing the NPFS. Results: The previously described NPFS version 3 (v.3), a transparent acrylic barrier with two anterior instrumentation ports, was modified by repositioning the side suction port closer to the level of the nose and deepening the lateral sides, squaring off the lower projection. A post-procedure questionnaire employing a 5-point Likert scale ranging from no symptoms (rating of 1) to intolerable (rating of 5) identified excellent patient tolerance of the new design (v.4), among 22 patients evaluated and similar in the comparison to the 116 patients using version 3. Among the 138 patients analyzed, only one patient rated the experience as greater than ""mild claustrophobia."" 100% of patients answered either ""none"" or ""mild"" to the pain and shortness of breath questions. The NPFS (v.4) was then successfully used in four patients for laser laryngoscopy with biopsy of laryngeal papilloma (3/4) and hemorrhagic polyp (1/4). Post-procedure questionnaire identified no shortness of breath (4/4), no claustrophobia (4/4), no pain (4/4) and no significant changes in pulse oximetry during use. Conclusion: Extensive experience in performing diagnostic laryngoscopy with the NPFS directed design changes leading to successful use for transnasal flexible laser laryngoscopy with biopsy in a negative pressure microenvironment.

With already fragile healthcare systems it can have long lasting effects in developing countries. Outbreaks especially a pandemic situation evokes fear related behaviors among healthcare professionals and there is always an increased risk of mental health disorders. Therefore, this study aims to determine knowledge and perception about this pandemic, prevalence and factors associated with anxiety/depression among frontline physicians of Pakistan. METHODS: Data were collected through an online survey released in the last week of March-2020. 389 frontline physicians from all four provinces and 65 cities of Pakistan participated. Survey questionnaire consisted of 4 parts including informed consent section, demographic section, knowledge and perception about COVID-19 pandemic and assessment of depression through World Health Organization Self-reporting questionnaire (SRQ-20). A score of 8 or above on SRQ-20 was used as cut-off to label the participant as depressed. Data was analyzed using SPSS version22. RESULTS: A 43% prevalence of anxiety/depression among frontline physicians of Pakistan was reported. Almost all the doctors had moderate to high knowledge score. Majority of participants marked N-95 mask as ""essential"" during aerosol generating procedures, assessing patients with respiratory symptoms, in COVID patient-care area, ER triage and direct care of COVID-19 patient. Only 12% of the doctors were fully satisfied with the provision of PPEs and almost 94% felt unprotected. In multivariable model, assessing more than five COVID suspects/day (aOR = 2.73, 95% CI: 1.65-4.52), working 20 h/week or less (aOR = 2.11, 1.27-3.49), having children among household members (aOR = 1.58, 95% CI: 1.00-2.50) and moderate to low knowledge of the infection (aOR = 2.69, 95% CI: 1.68-4.31) were found to be independent predictors of anxiety/depression among physicians. CONCLUSION: Anxiety/depression among more than a third of frontline doctors of Pakistan warrants the need to address mental health of doctors caring for patients during this pandemic; control modifiable factors associated with it and explore the effectiveness of interventions to promote psychological well-being of physicians.","Amin, Faridah; Sharif, Salman; Saeed, Rabeeya; Durrani, Noureen; Jilani, Daniyal",BMC Psychiatry,,177

247479,The Concept of Multiple Impacts of Renewable Energy Sources: A Critical Review,2021,"The COVID-19 pandemic has prompted numerous academic debates about its impact on health and the economy and on possible post-pandemic scenarios across the globe. The discussion has been focused on whether the pandemic will mark a turning point and a unique opportunity to generate radical changes in the economic and productive system, or if the State assistance role will, once again, serve to rescue the capitalist system. There is a common link between these two opposing positions in that there will be a crossroads for the future of humanity, regarding the treatment that will be given to nature. However, some of the most optimistic visions seem to underestimate the different realities that the world presents. This paper proposes a combined analysis about the possible post-pandemic scenarios that are debated at a global level, and the impacts of the pandemic in the context of Latin America to fill an information gap and to aid understanding on what the possible post-pandemic scenarios for Latin America could be. The first findings show that the debates about the post-pandemic future at the global level could be grouped between: the return to “business as usual”;a managed transition;and a paradigm shift. For Latin America, the post-pandemic scenario will be highly conditioned on how the new world order is reconfigured, and moving on a path towards sustainability for the region in the post-pandemic scenario seems to be linked to two possibilities: a kind of revolt or revolution fostered by the social bases;or a solution of a global nature that favors making long-term decisions. If this does not occur, the most likely scenario seems to be a return to business as usual.","Juan Pablo, Morea",World,,177

However, they fail to mention that in some countries, with the rise in COVID-19-related hospital admissions, competition can occur between COVID-19 and trauma patients for scarce hospital resources. In South Africa, this has led to the temporary banning of alcohol sales at two periods during the lockdown. Stockwell et al. highlight the fact that alcohol is deemed an 'essential service' in many countries and point to the reasons why this might have occurred, and that industry appears to be taking advantage of lockdown conditions to expand their reach in ways that might continue after the lockdown. The alcohol industry in South Africa has also used the points given by Stockwell et al. as to why governments might be reluctant to restrict alcohol at this time in pushing back against imposition of alcohol control measures, and furthermore referred to the effect of the sales ban on jobs in the alcohol and related industries and policy inconsistencies in dealing with different industries. Finally, the commentary expands on the measures presented on how governments should use the opportunity provided by the COVID-19 crisis to push for further alcohol control measures to be implemented.","Parry, Charles D H",Drug alcohol rev,,177

We performed simultaneous measurement of both flow-mediated vasodilation for endothelial function of conduit arteries and reactive hyperemia-peripheral arterial tonometry for that of microvasculature in 88 consecutive patients with chronic heart failure. In 55 patients with ischemic heart disease as an underlying cause of heart failure, flow-mediated vasodilation value was comparable between the two groups of HFrEF (left ventricular ejection fraction < 50%, n = 31) and HFpEF (left ventricular ejection fraction &#8805; 50%, n = 24).

In contrast, among 33 patients with non-ischemic heart disease, the degree of flow-mediated vasodilation was lower in HFpEF patients (n = 18) compared with HFrEF patients (n = 15) (P = 0.009), while reactive hyperemia index was comparable between the two groups. The clinical and pathophysiological significance of endothelial function in heart failure differs between conduit artery and microvasculature, and these differences may contribute to the underlying pathophysiology of HFpEF and HFrEF, as well as in ischemic heart disease and non-ischemic heart disease.","Waku, Ryutaro; Tokoi, Seiko; Toyoda, Shigeru; Kitahara, Keijiro; Naganuma, Jin; Yazawa, Hiroko; Sakuma, Masashi; Abe, Shichiro; Nakajima, Toshiaki; Inoue, Teruo",Tohoku J Exp Med,,177

MATERIALS AND METHODS: In February 2020, six consecutive patients with COVID-19 pneumonia (median age, 69 years) underwent U-HR CT imaging. U-HR-CT has a larger matrix size of 1024 × 1024 thinner slice thickness of 0.25 mm and can demonstrate terminal bronchioles in the normal lungs; as a result, Reid's secondary lobules and their abnormalities can be identified. The distribution and hallmarks (ground-glass opacity, consolidation with or without architectural distortion, linear opacity, crazy paving) of the lung opacities on U-HRCT were visually evaluated on a 1 K monitor by two experienced reviewers. The CT lung volume was measured, and the ratio of the measured lung volume to the predicted total lung capacity (predTLC) based on sex, age and height was calculated. RESULTS: All cases showed crazy paving pattern in U-HRCT. In these lesions, the secondary lobules were smaller than those in the un-affected lungs. CT lung volume decreased in two cases comparing predTLC. CONCLUSION: U-HRCT can evaluate not only the distribution and hallmarks of COVID-19 pneumonia but also visualize local lung volume loss.","Iwasawa, Tae; Sato, Midori; Yamaya, Takafumi; Sato, Yozo; Uchida, Yoshinori; Kitamura, Hideya; Hagiwara, Eri; Komatsu, Shigeru; Utsunomiya, Daisuke; Ogura, Takashi",Jpn J Radiol,,177

Virus-specific antibodies can be detected in infected patients approximately two weeks after symptom onset. In this study, we set up ELISA technology coating with purified SARS-CoV-2 S and N proteins to study the antibody response of 484 serum samples. We established a surrogate viral inhibition assay using SARS-CoV-2 S protein pseudovirus system to determine the neutralization potency of collected serum samples. Here, we report robust antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 in 484 recovered patients varying from 154 to 193 days, with 92% of recovered patients displaying a positive virus-specific spike glycoprotein IgG (s-IgG) response, while the ratio of positive spike glycoprotein IgM (s-IgM) reached 63%. Furthermore, moderate to potent neutralization activities were also observed in 62% of patients, correlating significantly with s-IgG response. This study strongly supports the long-term presence of antibodies in recovered patients against SARS-CoV-2, although all serum samples were collected from individuals with mild or moderate symptoms.","Tian, Xiaodong; Liu, Ling; Jiang, Wenguo; Zhang, He; Liu, Wenjun; Li, Jing",Front Immunol,,177

This interface is structured by a complex H-bond network that is only stable at physiological pH. Structural correlations analysis between its residues and the catalytic site confirms the presence of a buried allosteric site. However, noticeable differences in allosteric connectivity are observed between PFFs and non-PFFs. Interfacial polarizable water molecules are shown to appear at the heart of this discrepancy, since they are connected to the global interface H-bond network and able to adapt their dipole moment (and dynamics) to their diverse local physico-chemical micro-environments. The water-interface many-body interactions appear to drive the interface volume fluctuations and to therefore mediate the allosteric interactions with the catalytic cavity.","Dina, El Ahdab Louis Lagardère Theo Jaffrelot Inizan Frédéric Célerse Chengwen Liu Olivier Adjoua Luc-Henri Jolly Nohad Gresh Zeina Hobaika Pengyu Ren Richard G.

260490,A Review of Climate-Smart Agriculture Applications in Cyprus,2020,"BACKGROUND: Data on postoperative outcomes of the COVID-19 patient population is limited. We described COVID-19 patients who underwent a surgery and the pandemic impact on surgical activities. METHODS: We conducted a multicenter cohort study between March 13 and June 192,020. We included all COVID-19 patients who underwent surgery in nine centres of the Province of Québec, the Canadian province most afflicted by the pandemic. We also included concomitant suspected COVID-19 (subsequently confirmed not to have COVID-19) patients and patients who had recovered from it. We collected data on baseline characteristics, postoperative complications and postoperative mortality. Our primary outcome was 30-day mortality. We also collected data on overall surgical activities during this first wave and during the same period in 2019. RESULTS: We included 44 COVID-19 patients, 18 suspected patients, and 18 patients who had recovered from COVID-19 at time of surgery. Among the 44 COVID-19 patients, 31 surgeries (71%) were urgent and 16 (36%) were major. In these patients, pulmonary complications were frequent (25%) and 30-day mortality was high (15.9%). This mortality was higher in patients with symptoms (23.1%) compared to those without symptoms (5.6%), although not statistically significant (p = 0.118). Of the total 22,616 cases performed among participating centres during the study period, only 0.19% had COVID-19 at the time of surgery. Fewer procedures were performed during the study period compared to the same period in 2019 (44,486 cases). CONCLUSION: In this Canadian cohort study, postoperative 30-day mortality in COVID-19 patients undergoing surgery was high (15.9%). Although few surgeries were performed on COVID-19 patients, the pandemic impact on surgical activity volume was important.

Investigating Transferability in COVID-19 CT Image Segmentation,2021,"OBJECTIVES: Universities are exploring strategies to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 prior to reopening their campuses. National guidelines do not currently recommend testing students prior to campus arrival. However, the impact of presemester testing has not been studied. DESIGN: Dynamic SARS-CoV-2 transmission models are used to explore the effects of three presemester testing interventions. INTERVENTIONS: Testing of students 0, 1 and 2 times prior to campus arrival. PRIMARY OUTCOMES: Number of active infections and time until isolation bed capacity is reached. SETTING: We set on-campus and off-campus populations to 7500 and 17 500 students, respectively. We assumed 2% prevalence of active cases at the semester start, and that one-third of infected students will be detected and isolated throughout the semester. Isolation bed capacity was set at 500. We varied disease transmission rates (R0=1.5, 2, 3, 4) to represent the effectiveness of mitigation strategies throughout the semester. RESULTS: Without presemester screening, peak number of active infections ranged from 4114 under effective mitigation strategies (R0=1.5) to 10 481 under ineffective mitigation strategies (R0=4), and exhausted isolation bed capacity within 10 (R 0 =4) to 25 days (R0=1.5). Mandating at least one test prior to campus arrival delayed the timing and reduced the size of the peak, while delaying the time until isolation bed capacity was reached. Testing twice in conjunction with effective mitigation strategies (R0=1.5) was the only scenario that did not exhaust isolation bed capacity during the semester. CONCLUSIONS: Presemester screening is necessary to avert early and large surges of active COVID-19 infections. Therefore, we recommend testing within 1 week prior to and on campus return. While this strategy is sufficient for delaying the timing of the peak outbreak, presemester testing would need to be implemented in conjunction with effective mitigation strategies to significantly reduce outbreak size and preserve isolation bed capacity.","Rennert, Lior; Kalbaugh, Corey Andrew; Shi, Lu; McMahan, Christopher",BMJ Open,,177

The dromedary camel is considered a possible host of the virus and also to act as a reservoir, transmitting the virus to humans. Here, we studied evolutionary relationships for 31 complete genomes of betacoronaviruses, including eight newly sequenced MERS-CoV genomes isolated from dromedary camels in Saudi Arabia. Through bioinformatics tools, we also used available sequences and 3D structure of MERS-CoV spike glycoprotein to predict MERS-CoV epitopes and assess antibody binding affinity. Phylogenetic analysis showed the eight new sequences have close relationships with existing strains detected in camels and humans in Arabian Gulf countries. The 2019-nCov strain appears to have higher homology to both bat coronavirus and SARS-CoV than to MERS-CoV strains. The spike protein tree exhibited clustering of MERS-CoV sequences similar to the complete genome tree, except for one sequence from Qatar (KF961222). B cell epitope analysis determined that the MERS-CoV spike protein has 24 total discontinuous regions from which just six epitopes were selected with score values of >80%. Our results suggest that the virus circulates by way of camels crossing the borders of Arabian Gulf countries. This study contributes to finding more effective vaccines in order to provide long-term protection against MERS-CoV and identifying neutralizing antibodies.","Al-Shomrani, Badr M; Manee, Manee M; Alharbi, Sultan N; Altammami, Mussad A; Alshehri, Manal A; Nassar, Majed S; Bakhrebah, Muhammed A; Al-Fageeh, Mohamed B",Viruses,,177

Human placenta tissue is rich in stem cells, which can be isolated, cultured and differentiated. The present study investigated the capability of human placenta-derived cells to differentiate into osteocytes and adipocytes in two subgroups of: Patients who have had positive COVID-19 PCR test result during their pregnancies versus the control group, the normal healthy pregnant women. Material & Methods: Firstly, placenta tissues were obtained from 30 positive COVID-19 women undergoing cesarean section as the experiment group and 30 normal healthy women as the control group, all with the age range from 20 to 40 years old. Isolation of placenta-derived cells was done by type IV collagenase digestion of 60 freshly obtained human placentas (30 placentas in each group) and then cultured. Flow cytometry was utilized for the analysis of cell surface markers of adherent cells. β-glycerol phosphate, vitamin C, and dexamethasone were used for the Osteocytic differentiation and the process has been confirmed by Alizarin red staining. Induction of differentiation in adipocytes was applied with the use of dexamethasone and insulin and the process has been confirmed by oil red O staining. Results: Placenta-derived adherent cells were positive for high levels of CD44, CD105, CD73, CD90 and CD29;in fact their expression level were &gt; 99percentage, while the expression level of CD34, CD45, CD19, and CD14 was &lt;7%, identical pattern to the human mesenchymal stem cells. The cells had the potential to differentiate into osteocytes and adipocytes. Conclusion: Human placenta tissue contains mesenchymal stem cells with the potential to differentiate into adipocytes and osteocytes, which, based on our study, have not been influenced by COVID-19 virus. Accordingly, the use of human placenta-derived mesenchymal cells may be of interest in basic research and clinical use due to providing an alternative source of mesenchymal stem cells. © 2021 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.","Maleki, N.; Karami, F.; Bagheri, R.

Current treatment of COVID-19 patients relies mainly on antiviral drugs lopinavir/ritonavir, arbidol, and remdesivir, the anti-malarial drugs hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine, and traditional Chinese medicine. There are over 2,118 on-going clinical trials underway, but to date none of these drugs have consistently proven effective. Cathepsin L (CatL) is an endosomal cysteine protease. It mediates the cleavage of the S1 subunit of the coronavirus surface spike glycoprotein. This cleavage is necessary for coronavirus entry into human host cells, virus and host cell endosome membrane fusion, and viral RNA release for next round of replication. Here we summarize data regarding seven CatL-selective inhibitors that block coronavirus entry into cultured host cells and provide a mechanism to block SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans. Given the rapid growth of the SARS-CoV-2-positive population worldwide, ready-to-use CatL inhibitors should be explored as a treatment option. We identify ten US FDA-approved drugs that have CatL inhibitory activity. We provide evidence that supports the combined use of serine protease and CatL inhibitors as a possibly safer and more effective therapy than other available therapeutics to block coronavirus host cell entry and intracellular replication, without compromising the immune system.","Liu, Tianxiao; Luo, Songyuan; Libby, Peter; Shi, Guo-Ping",Pharmacol Ther,,177

Additionally, recent simulations incadaveric models have demonstrated aerosol generation during power endonasal instrumentation. Endonasal proceduresare commonly performed in the outpatient clinic setting, and with a potential for aerosol generation, these procedures maypose a potential exposure risk to clinic staff. Objective: To provide a greater understanding of aerosol generation and exposure risk during endoscopic endonasalinstrumentation in the outpatient clinic setting. Methods: Using an optical particle sizer, airborne particles concentrations in particles per cubic foot (p/ft ) were measuredduring 30 nasal endoscopies in the outpatient clinic setting. Aerosol measurements were collected within an 18-inch radiusfrom the patient's head during 11 different diagnostic nasal endoscopies and 19 different nasal endoscopies with suctionand mechanical debridement. To identify any particle effect from endonasal instrumentation, airborne particles measuring0.3, 0.5, 1.0, 2.5, 5.0, and 10.0 microns (μm) in diameter were recorded at distinct time points throughout diagnostic anddebridement endoscopies. To account for the effects of native patient breathing on aerosol concentrations, all endoscopymeasurements were compared to aerosol concentrations measured prior to procedure initiation. Results: Compared to preprocedure aerosol levels, no significant increase in mean aerosol concentrations was measuredduring diagnostic nasal endoscopies. However, compared to preprocedure aerosol levels, a statistically significant increasein mean particle concentrations was measured during cold instrumentation at 2,462 p/ft (95% CI: 837-4,088;p = 0.005).The use of suction instrumentation was also associated with a statistically significant increase in mean particleconcentrations at 2,973 p/ft (95% CI: 1,419-4,529;p = 0.001). In total, greater than 99% of all measured particles wereless than 2.5 μm in diameter, with comparable particle size distributions observed during all forms of endonasalinstrumentation. Conclusion: When measured with an optical particle sizer, diagnostic nasal endoscopy with a rigid endoscope is notassociated with increased particle aerosolization in patients for which sinonasal debridement is not indicated. In patientsneeding sinonasal debridement, the use of cold and suction instrumentation was associated with increased particle aerosolization. The observed generation of airborne particles, especially sub-micrometer aerosols, during endonasaldebridement may increase exposure risk for clinic staff to SARS-CoV-2 compared to patient native breathing. Appropriatepersonal protective equipment use and patient screening should be utilized for all office-based endonasal procedures.","Murr, A.; Lenze, N.; Gelpi, M.; Brown, W.; Ebert, C.; Senior, B.; Thorp, B.; Kimple, A.; Zanation, A.",Journal of Neurological Surgery Part B: Skull Base,,177

We hypothesized that fewer patients administered this combination would require oxygen therapy, intensive care support, or a combination of both than those who did not. METHODS: This was a cohort observational study of all consecutive hospitalized patients &#8805;50 y of age with COVID-19 in a tertiary academic hospital. Before April 6, 2020, no patients received the (DMB) combination. After this date, patients were administered 1000 IU/d oral vitamin D3, 150 mg/d oral magnesium, and 500 mcg/d oral vitamin B12 upon admission if they did not require oxygen therapy. Primary outcome was deterioration leading to any form of oxygen therapy, intensive care support, or both. RESULTS: Between January 15 and April 15, 2020, we identified 43 consecutive patients &#8805;50 y of age with COVID-19. Seventeen patients received DMB before onset of primary outcome and 26 patients did not. Baseline demographic characteristics between the two groups were significantly different by age. In univariate analysis, age and hypertension had a significant influence on outcome. After adjusting for age or hypertension separately in a multivariate analysis, the intervention group retained protective significance. Fewer treated patients than controls required initiation of oxygen therapy during hospitalization (17.6 vs 61.5%, P = 0.006). DMB exposure was associated with odds ratios of 0.13 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.03-0.59) and 0.20 (95% CI, 0.04-0.93) for oxygen therapy, intensive care support, or both on univariate and multivariate analyses, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: A vitamin D / magnesium / vitamin B12 combination in older COVID-19 patients was associated with a significant reduction in the proportion of patients with clinical deterioration requiring oxygen support, intensive care support, or both. This study supports further larger randomized controlled trials to ascertain the full benefit of this combination in ameliorating the severity of COVID-19.","Tan, Chuen Wen; Ho, Liam Pock; Kalimuddin, Shirin; Cherng, Benjamin Pei Zhi; Teh, Yii Ean; Thien, Siew Yee; Wong, Hei Man; Tern, Paul Jie Wen; Chandran, Manju; Chay, Jason Wai Mun; Nagarajan, Chandramouli; Sultana, Rehena; Low, Jenny Guek Hong; Ng, Heng Joo",Nutrition,,177

METHODSO_ST_ABSDesignC_ST_ABSPopulation-based historical rate comparison study and self-controlled case series (SCCS) analysis. SettingPrimary care records from the United Kingdom. ParticipantsIndividuals who received the first dose of ChAdOx1 or BNT162b2 between 8 December 2020 and 6 March 2021. A cohort with a first positive RT-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 between 1 September 2020 and 28 February 2021 was used for comparison. Main outcome measuresOutcomes included Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS), Bells palsy, encephalomyelitis, and transverse myelitis. Incidence rates were estimated in the 28 days post first-dose vaccine, 90 days post-COVID-19, and between 2017 to 2019 for the general population cohort for background rates. Indirectly standardised incidence ratios (SIRs) were estimated. Adjusted incidence rate ratios (IRR) were estimated from the SCCS when sufficient statistical power was reached. ResultsWe included 1,868,767 ChAdOx1 and 1,661,139 BNT162b2 vaccinees; 299,311 people infected with COVID-19; and 2,290,537 from the general population. SIRs for GBS were 1.91 [95% CI: 0.86 to 4.26] after ChAdOx1, 1.29 [0.49 to 3.45] after BNT162b2, and 5.20 [1.95 to 13.85] after COVID-19. In the same cohorts, SIRs for Bells palsy were 1.34 [1.05 to 1.72], 1.15 [0.88 to 1.50], and 1.23 [0.80 to 1.89], and for encephalomyelitis 1.62 [0.61 to 4.31], 0.86 [0.22 to 3.46], and 11.05 [5.27 to 23.17], respectively. Transverse myelitis was too rare to analyse (n<5 in all cohorts). SCCS analysis was only conducted for Bells palsy due to limited statistical power. We found no association between either vaccine and Bells palsy, with an IRR of 1.10 [0.81 to 1.46] and 1.15 [0.87 to 1.49] for BNT162b2 and ChAdOx1, respectively. ConclusionsWe found no consistent association between either vaccine and any of the studied neuroimmune adverse events studied. Conversely, we found a 5-fold increase in risk of GBS and an 11-fold of encephalomyelitis following COVID-19.","Li, Xintong; Martinez-Hernandez, Eugenia; Herranz, Elena Roel; Delmestri, Antonella; Duarte-Salles, Talita; Strauss, Victoria; Burn, Edward; PRIETO-ALHAMBRA, DANIEL",,,177

This study aimed to track the effect of these peaks on various types of surgery representing differences in urgency, importance, and complexity. DesignDatabase study using the Hospital Episode Statistics database and surgical operations selected purposively, to represent different combinations of urgency, importance and complexity. SettingAll hospitals within England that carried out procedures funded by the National Health Service. Main Outcome MeasuresNumber of emergency routine surgeries; cancer-removal surgeries; transplant surgeries; renal transplants Deceased and living donors); and elective routine surgeries carried out prior to and during the COVID pandemic. ResultsWhile all surgeries declined, emergency or urgent operations held up better than elective cases. There was rapid rebound between peaks. Among emergency cases, coronary angioplasty for acute myocardial infarction held up well in contrast to appendectomy, where indications for surgery are more elastic. Among urgent cancer and transplant operations, those with the most complex pathways were the most severely affected. The pandemic affected socio-economic and ethnic groups similarly. Disruption during the second peak was slightly less than during the first peak despite even greater COVID admission rates. ConclusionThe NHS titrated its response appropriately to the pandemic by prioritising emergency and urgent cases over elective cases. However, complex time critical conditions like organ transplants and certain cancers are also disrupted with implications for third peaks in hospital admissions that many countries are experiencing.","Remsing, Sandra; Evison, Felicity; Vohra, Ravinder S; Morton, Dion; Chilton, Peter J; Khunti, Kamlesh; Lilford, Richard J",,,177

This study aims to fill this research gap for the Republic of Korea, which has over 10,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases. Patients and Methods: Using the nationwide health insurance claims data of 7590 confirmed COVID-19 patients, we estimated average medical expenses and inpatient days per patient, and performed multivariate negative binomial, and gamma regressions to determine influencing factors for higher outcomes. Results: According to the results, COVID-19 patients with history of ICU admission, chest CT imaging, lopinavir/ritonavir and hydroxychloroquine use stayed longer in the hospital and spent more on medical expenses, and anti-hypertensive drugs were insignificantly associated with the outcomes. Female patients stayed longer in the hospital in the over 65 age group but spent less in medical expenses that the 20-39 group. In the 40-69 age group, patients with health insurance stayed longer in the hospital and spent more on medical expenses than those aged over 65 years. Comorbidities did not affect outcomes in most age groups. Conclusion: In summary, contrary to popular beliefs, medical expenses and length of hospitalization were mostly influenced by age, and not by comorbidities, anti-viral, or anti-hypertensive drugs. Thus, responses should focus on infection prevention and control rather than clinical countermeasures.","Jang, S. Y.; Seon, J. Y.; Yoon, S. J.; Park, S. Y.; Lee, S. H.; Oh, I.

OBJECTIVE: Evaluation of the most common reasons for patient presentations in the VC, the proportion of re-presentations in the practice despite VC, practical challenges associated with the introduction of VC and patient satisfaction. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Patients with a recent acute visual deterioration and severe eye pain were excluded from the VC. The VC were carried out by a trained specialist in ophthalmology. A questionnaire with eight questions was completed after the VC appointment in order to evaluate the proportion of completed VC and patient satisfaction. RESULTS: We included 29 (13 male, Ø 52.6 years, 16 female, Ø 64.7 years) patients in this analysis. The VC could be performed with 68.97% of the participants who rated their overall experience with an average grade of 1.6 (1 very good to 6 insufficient) and all of them indicated that they would recommend the VC. Of presentations in VC 70% were related to the symptoms of the anterior eye segment. In 70% of the cases no re-presentations took place in the unit. CONCLUSION: Our study represents a significant practical application of VC for the management of non-urgent ocular conditions with maximum infection prophylaxis. The introduction of VC was severely limited by technological or user-related issues by the establishment of video connections. Patient satisfaction with VC was high to very high.","Gerbutavicius, R; Brandlhuber, U; Glück, S; Kortüm, G F; Kortüm, I; Navarrete Orozco, R; Rakitin, M; Strodtbeck, M; Wolf, A; Kortüm, K U",Ophthalmologe,,177

Data sources: We conducted searches in PubMed/Medline, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), grey literature and in a centralized repository in L·OVE (Living OVerview of Evidence), which retrieves articles from multiple sources such as PubMed/MEDLINE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Embase, among other pre-print and protocols repositories. In response to the COVID-19 emergency, L·OVE (Living OVerview of Evidence) was adapted to expand the range of evidence and customized to group all COVID-19 evidence in one place on a daily search basis. The search covered a period of time up to July 31, 2020. Eligibility criteria for selecting studies and methods: We adapted an already published standard protocol for multiple parallel living systematic reviews to this question's specificities. We included randomized trials evaluating the effect of either suspension or indication of angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers as monotherapy, or in combination versus placebo or no treatment in patients with COVID-19. We searched for randomized trials evaluating the effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers versus placebo or no treatment in patients with COVID-19. Two reviewers independently screened each study for eligibility, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias. We pooled the results using meta-analysis and applied the GRADE system to assess the certainty of the evidence for each outcome. We will resubmit results every time the conclusions change or whenever there are substantial updates. Results: We screened 772 records, but none was considered for eligibility. We identified 55 ongoing studies, including 41 randomized trials evaluating angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers for patients with COVID-19. Conclusions: We did not find a randomized clinical trial meeting our inclusion criteria, and hence there is no evidence for supporting the role of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers in the treatment of patients with COVID-19. A substantial number of ongoing studies would provide valuable evidence to inform researchers and decision-makers in the near future. PROSPERO registration number: CRD42020182495.

283558,"Complexity, transparency and time pressure: practical insights into science communication in times of crisis",2020,"OBJECTIVES: Residents in nursing homes represent a frail, elderly population, and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection can spread easily in this setting. Despite a frequent severe evolution of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), these patients often present an atypical course with mild initial symptoms. The aim of this study was to assess the occurrence of fever in elderly patients with COVID-19 residing in nursing homes. METHODS: Two hundred and thirty-one elderly patients from three nursing homes in Pavia and surrounding area were enrolled in April-May 2020. SARS-CoV-2 infection was diagnosed using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction with nasopharyngeal swab and/or serological assay (LIAISON® SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 IgG). Patients with a positive result on RT-PCR or serology were classed as positive. RESULTS: In total, 170 patients (74%) were SARS-CoV-2-positive on RT-PCR and/or serology, and 61 patients (26%) had negative results on both tests. Fever (body temperature >37.5 °C) was observed in four patients (1.7%): three in the SARS-CoV-2-positive group (1.8%) and one in the SARS-CoV-2-negative group (1.6%). CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of fever was extremely low in this population of nursing home residents with COVID-19. This finding must be taken into consideration when screening patients without fever in nursing homes.","Raimondi, Ambra; Poma, Gianluigi; Piralla, Antonio; Meroni, Valeria; Baldanti, Fausto; Filice, Carlo",Int J Infect Dis,,177

Pesaro-Urbino province was included for further investigation as it was comparably affected by the epidemic despite being the area far from the Po valley. Moving means of the variables were considered to take into account the variability of incubation periods and uncertainties in the epidemiological data. The same analyzes were performed normalizing the number of new daily cases based on the number of checks performed. For each province, the moving mean of adjusted and unadjusted new daily cases were independently plotted versus each meteorological parameter, and linear regressions were determined in the period from 29th of February 2020 to 29th of March 2020. Strong positive correlations were observed between new cases and temperatures within three provinces representing 86.5% of the contagions. Strong negative correlations were observed between the moving means of new cases and relative humidity values for four provinces and more than 90% of the contagions.","Passerini, Giorgio; Mancinelli, Enrico; Morichetti, Mauro; Virgili, Simone; Rizza, Umberto",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,177

Despite several documented similarities, the coronavirus pandemic is clearly distinct from the 1918 flu pandemic in terms of our exponentially increased, almost instantaneous ability to access/share information, offering an unprecedented opportunity to visualise rippling effects of global events across space and time. Personal devices provide “big data” on people’s movement, the environment and economic trends, while access to the unprecedented flurry in scientific publications and media posts provides a measure of the response of the educated world to the crisis. Most bibliometric (co-authorship, co-citation, or bibliographic coupling) analyses ignore the time dimension, but COVID-19 has made it possible to perform a detailed temporal investigation into the pandemic. Here, we report a comprehensive network analysis based on more than 20,000 published documents on viral epidemics, authored by over 75,000 individuals from 140 nations in the past one year of the crisis. Unlike the 1918 flu pandemic, access to published data over the past two decades enabled a comparison of publishing trends between the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and those of the 2003 SARS epidemic to study changes in thematic foci and societal pressures dictating research over the course of a crisis.","Gupta, Ramya Prasad Abhishek Babu Suresh Yadav Gitanjali",Entropy,,177

286987,Chief Year: Finding a new normal during uncertain times,2020,"With the far-reaching COVID-19 pandemic starting in December 2019, a surge of misinformation, now coined by the World Health Organization (WHO) as an 'infodemic', has also taken the world by storm. False information and variations in interpretations about the pandemic and mitigation interventions/strategies continue to spread at a faster pace than the relevant scientific evidence. The WHO has called for a fight against this infodemic, describing it as the most contagious aspect of the pandemic. In this era of rapid information exchange, public health measures, and state interventions to control the pandemic, a contextual understanding of how information is communicated and shared is important for uncovering possible reasons for action or inaction by the general public. With the Lebanese state scrambling to implement and enforce different measures to control and mitigate the spread of COVID-19, adherence by the general public is not uniform. In this paper, we refer to social science and risk communication theory to discuss how the political, economic and social contexts in the country, and not only the content of the messages that people receive from officials, affect how they interpret and act on information. We highlight how this has played out in Lebanon and identify societal aspects of importance in a low-middle income country fraught with social, economic and political inequalities which continue to undermine the efforts to contain the spread. Implications to inform state response in the context of low-middle income countries are also discussed.","Makhoul, Jihad; Kabakian-Khasholian, Tamar; Chaiban, Lea",Glob Health Promot,,177

This population is at risk of long term complications related to HIV infection, particularly chronic respiratory disease. Limited data on chest imaging findings in HIV-infected adolescents, suggest that the predominant disease is of small and large airways: predominantly bronchiolitis obliterans or bronchiectasis. Single cases of emphysema have been reported. Lung fibrosis, lymphocytic interstitial pneumonitis, post tuberculous apical fibrocystic changes and malignancies do not feature in this population. Chest radiograph (CXR) is easily accessible and widely used, especially in resource limited settings, such as sub Saharan Africa, where the greatest burden of HIV disease occurs. Lung ultrasound has been described for the diagnosis of pneumonia in children, pulmonary oedema and interstitial lung disease [1-3]. The use of this modality in chronic respiratory disease in adolescents where the predominant finding is small airway disease and bronchiectasis has however not been described. CXR is useful to evaluate structural/post infective changes, parenchymal opacification and nodules, hyperinflation or extensive bronchiectasis. CXR however, is inadequate for diagnosing small airway disease, for which high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) is the modality of choice. Where available, low dose HRCT should be used early in the course of symptomatic disease in adolescents and for follow up in children who are non responsive to treatment or clinically deteriorating. This article provides a pictorial review of the spectrum of CXR and HRCT imaging findings of chronic pulmonary disease in perinatally HIV-infected adolescents on cART and guidelines for imaging.","du Plessis, Anne-Marie; Andronikou, Savvas; Zar, Heather J",Paediatr. respir. rev,,177

The present commentary focuses on highlighting some of the lessons learnt, challenges and future needs of the health workforce in Europe in the context of COVID-19. During the pandemic innovative and flexible approaches were implemented to meet increasing demand for health workers and new skills and responsibilities were adopted over a short period of time. We have seen the rapid adaptation and use of new technologies to deliver care. The pandemic has underlined the importance of valuing, protecting and caring for our health workforce and the need to invest appropriately and adequately in the health workforce to have sufficient, capable and well-motivated health workers. Some of the main challenges that lie ahead of us include the imperative for better investment, to need to improve recruitment and retraining whilst better retaining health workers, a focus on domestic sustainability, redeploying and developing new skills and competences among health workers, enabling more effective multi-professional collaboration and team work, improving the quality of education and training, increasing the public health focus and promoting ethical and sustainable international recruitment of health workers.

METHODS: We included all COVID-19 positive adult patients (&#8805;18 years) hospitalized between March 1, 2020 to August 5th, 2020. We used CDC definitions of HAI in the acute care setting. Outcomes studied were rates and types of infections and in hospital mortality.. We constructed several multivariable logistic regression models to examine characteristics associated with development of HAI. RESULTS: Of 1565 patients, 140 separate HAIs from 73 different organisms developed in 59 (3.7%) patients. Of these, 23 were gram positive, 39 were gram negative and 11 were fungal. Patient developing HAI did not have higher odds of death (OR 0.85,95%CI 0.40-1.81, p = 0.69). HAIs were associated with use of tocilizumab (OR 5.04, 95%CI 2.4-10.6, p < 0.001), steroids (OR 3.8, 95%CI 1.4-10, p = 0.007), hydroxychloroquine(OR 3.0, 95%CI 1.0-8.8, p = 0.05) and acute kidney injury requiring hemodialysis (OR 3.7, 95%CI 1.1-12.8, p = 0.04).

Our method to estimate the reproduction number using Bayesian inference with time-dependent priors enhances previous approaches by considering a dynamic prior continuously updated as restrictive measures and comportments within the society evolve. In addition, to allow direct comparison between reproduction number and introduction of public health measures in a specific country, the infection dates are inferred from daily confirmed cases and confirmed death. The evolution of this reproduction number in combination with the stringency index is analyzed on 31 European countries. We show that most countries required tough state interventions with a stringency index equal to 79.6 out of 100 to reduce their reproduction number below one and control the progression of the pandemic. In addition, we show a direct correlation between the time taken to introduce restrictive measures and the time required to contain the spread of the pandemic with a median time of 8 days. This analysis is validated by comparing the excess deaths and the time taken to implement restrictive measures.

294577,Covid-19 Detection Using CT Scan based on Gray Level Co-Occurrence Matrix,2021,"OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effectiveness of a prevention strategy against the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection among dental hospital staff over a 3-month period. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The effectiveness of the prevention strategy, which adopted healthcare staff protective measures, including patient triage and correct usage of personal preventive equipment, was evaluated by SARS-CoV-2 detection and serological testing. Patients who visited the Affiliated Stomatology Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, China, between January 31 and March 1 (lockdown period) and March 2 and April 27 (reopening period) in 2020 and in the same period in 2019 were included in the study. Patients' diagnosis, age, gender, and several undergoing aerosol-generating procedures during the study period were collected from the hospital's database. Corresponding data were compared year-on-year (2020-on-2019). A total of 757 hospital staff underwent SARS-CoV-2 detection and serological testing on April 28-29, 2020. RESULTS: During the lockdown and reopening period in 2020, the number of hospital visits was dramatically decreased to about 6% and 58%, respectively, compared with the same period in 2019. However, emergency visits were increased 16- and 6.4-fold. A total of at least 6654 patients (13.58%) underwent aerosol-generating procedures during the study period in the year 2020. All hospital staff were negative according to SARS-CoV-2 detection and serological testing (IgG, IgM) data. CONCLUSION: During the study period in 2020, the total number of hospital visits dramatically reduced but emergency visits significantly increased. The prevention strategy implemented successfully prevented SARS-CoV-2 infection spread among healthcare workers in a dental hospital. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The prevention strategy indicated patient triage and how to adopt preventive measures for controlling SARS-CoV-2 spread among healthcare workers. These data can be used as a reference for other sectors suffering from the COVID-19 pandemic.","Zhang, Ling; Xu, Yuedan; Jin, Xinyang; Shi, Zhiwei; Wu, Mengting; Xu, Ning; Yu, Xuefen; Deng, Shuli; Zhang, Kai; Zhang, Liefen; Hannig, Matthias; Chen, Qianming; Fu, Baiping",Clin. oral investig,,177

295945,"Managing endpoints, the weakest link in the security chain",2020,"The COVID-19 pandemic has transformed every facet of society. In addition to directly affecting population health, the economic impact of this social shock has begun to be palpable at the individual level. Situated in this context, this research note draws on data collected from Mainland China in March–April, 2020 to examine the individual-level economic toll of the COVID-19 outbreak. We investigate how individuals’ income (when surveyed) has changed relative to before the outbreak, and pay particular attention to the potentially unequal distribution of economic vulnerability based on structural (dis)advantages and COVID-19 related conditions. We show that education, family economic status, Communist Party membership, state-sector employment, and urban hukou—all long-standing status markers in China—mitigate the adverse effects of the COVID-19 outbreak on individuals’ income losses. In addition, people who live in families or regions that were hit harder by COVID-19 are more likely to experience income losses. Taken together, this study shows that the COVID-19 pandemic not only exacerbates pre-existing social inequalities but also creates new forms of disparities. Therefore, instead of acting as a great equalizer, the pandemic may well magnify the social distribution of economic vulnerability. To alleviate inequality and aid post-pandemic recovery, public policies need to be oriented toward vulnerable and marginalized populations.","Qian, Yue; Fan, Wen",Res. Soc. Stratification Mobil.,,177

Considering the changing landscape of HCV treatment, prevention, and care, and in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, this analysis seeks to evaluate Sweden's progress toward the WHO elimination targets and identify remaining barriers. METHODS: The data used for modeling HCV transmission and disease burden in Sweden were obtained through literature review, unpublished sources, and expert input. A dynamic Markov model was employed to forecast population sizes and incidence of HCV through 2030. Two scenarios (""2019 Base"" and ""WHO Targets"") were developed to evaluate Sweden's progress toward HCV elimination. RESULTS: At the beginning of 2019, there were 29,700 (95% UI: 19,300 - 33,700) viremic infections in Sweden. Under the base scenario, Sweden would achieve and exceed the WHO targets for diagnosis, treatment, and liver-related death. However, new infections would decrease by less than 10%, relative to 2015. Achieving all WHO targets by 2030 would require 1) expanding harm reduction programs to reach more than 90% of PWID and 2) treating 90% of HCV+ PWID engaged in harm reduction programs and &#8805;7% of PWID not involved in harm reduction programs, annually by 2025. CONCLUSIONS: It is of utmost importance that Sweden, and all countries, find sustainability in HCV programs by broadening the setting and base of providers to provide stability and continuity of care during turbulent times.","Blach, S; Blomé, M; Duberg, A-S; Jerkeman, A; Kåberg, M; Klasa, P-E; Lagging, M; Razavi-Shearer, D; Razavi, H; Aleman, S",Liver int,,177

Single-use face masks are one of the most used PPE to prevent the transmission of the virus. However, mismanagement of such materials threatens the environment with a new form of plastic pollution. Researchers argue that it is necessary to develop and implement innovative ways to manage and recycle PPE in order to reduce their impacts on the environment. In the present work, we have reviewed and discussed the recent development of sustainable face mask alternatives and recycling and repurposing routes under the COVID-19 pandemic context. Moreover, we have conducted estimations of the daily face mask waste generation in Peru, a developing country struggling with a poor solid waste management framework and infrastructure. Unlike previous studies, our equation incorporates the “economically active population” variable in order to provide more precise estimations, while evaluating single-use and reusable scenarios. The scenarios of incorporating reusable face masks significantly reduced the amount of solid waste generated in Peru. In situ evidence shows that face masks are polluting the streets and beaches of Peru, probably driven by mismanagement and poor environmental awareness.","Torres, F. G.; De-la-Torre, G.

301758,A Meta-Analysis of Scholarly Research on Corona virus through Big Data Approach (preprint),2020,"BACKGROUND: Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria meningitidis, which are typically transmitted via respiratory droplets, are leading causes of invasive diseases, including bacteraemic pneumonia and meningitis, and of secondary infections subsequent to post-viral respiratory disease. The aim of this study was to investigate the incidence of invasive disease due to these pathogens during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: In this prospective analysis of surveillance data, laboratories in 26 countries and territories across six continents submitted data on cases of invasive disease due to S pneumoniae, H influenzae, and N meningitidis from Jan 1, 2018, to May, 31, 2020, as part of the Invasive Respiratory Infection Surveillance (IRIS) Initiative. Numbers of weekly cases in 2020 were compared with corresponding data for 2018 and 2019. Data for invasive disease due to Streptococcus agalactiae, a non-respiratory pathogen, were collected from nine laboratories for comparison. The stringency of COVID-19 containment measures was quantified using the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker. Changes in population movements were assessed using Google COVID-19 Community Mobility Reports. Interrupted time-series modelling quantified changes in the incidence of invasive disease due to S pneumoniae, H influenzae, and N meningitidis in 2020 relative to when containment measures were imposed. FINDINGS: 27 laboratories from 26 countries and territories submitted data to the IRIS Initiative for S pneumoniae (62â837 total cases), 24 laboratories from 24 countries submitted data for H influenzae (7796 total cases), and 21 laboratories from 21 countries submitted data for N meningitidis (5877 total cases). All countries and territories had experienced a significant and sustained reduction in invasive diseases due to S pneumoniae, H influenzae, and N meningitidis in early 2020 (Jan 1 to May 31, 2020), coinciding with the introduction of COVID-19 containment measures in each country. By contrast, no significant changes in the incidence of invasive S agalactiae infections were observed. Similar trends were observed across most countries and territories despite differing stringency in COVID-19 control policies. The incidence of reported S pneumoniae infections decreased by 68% at 4 weeks (incidence rate ratio 0·32 [95% CI 0·27-0·37]) and 82% at 8 weeks (0·18 [0·14-0·23]) following the week in which significant changes in population movements were recorded. INTERPRETATION: The introduction of COVID-19 containment policies and public information campaigns likely reduced transmission of S pneumoniae, H influenzae, and N meningitidis, leading to a significant reduction in life-threatening invasive diseases in many countries worldwide.

OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to compare the test characteristics of point-of-care lung ultrasound (LUS) with chest x-ray study (CXR) at radiographically detecting COVID-19 pneumonia. METHODS: This was a single-center, prospective, observational study at an urban university hospital with > 105,000 patient visits annually. Patients &#8805; 18 years old, who presented to the Emergency Department with predefined signs and symptoms of COVID-19, were eligible for enrollment. Each patient received an LUS using a portable, handheld ultrasound followed by a single-view, portable anteroposterior CXR. Patients with an abnormal LUS or CXR underwent a non-contrast-enhanced computed tomography scan (NCCT). The primary outcome was the radiographic diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia on NCCT. RESULTS: One hundred ten patients underwent LUS, CXR, and NCCT; 99 LUS and 73 CXRs were interpreted as positive; 81 NCCTs were interpreted as positive, providing a prevalence of COVID-19 pneumonia of 75% (95% confidence interval [CI] 66-83.2) in our study population. LUS sensitivity was 97.6% (95% CI 91.6-99.7) vs. 69.9% (95% CI 58.8-79.5) for CXR. LUS specificity was 33.3% (95% CI 16.5-54) vs. 44.4% (95% CI 25.5-64.7) for CXR.

In acute strokes, knowing the COVID-19 status may help to preserve personal protective equipment (PPE) in patients in whom a thrombectomy may be indicated and helps to decrease unnecessary exposure. This study aims to demonstrate that rapid evaluation of a patient's COVID-19 status is feasible without delaying treatment times. Methods: An intradisciplinary team was convened to create a workflow for rapid COVID-19 testing. The Abbott Rapid® COVID-19 swab kit and assay were stocked in the ED Pyxis, utilizing the narcotic count feature to ensure all swabs were accounted. Upon activation of Code Stroke, the ED RN donned PPE and swabbed the patient's naso-oral pharynx. The collected swab was labeled, placed in a bio-hazard bag, sanitized and handed to a second RN outside of the room. The specimen was taken to a pre-alerted lab technician who prepped the assay after hearing the code stroke. After specimen collection, the patient followed the normal code stroke pathway and was taken to the CT scanner. Metrics were analyzed for the pre COVID-19 (January through April) and during active COVID-19 (May through July) periods. Results: There were 136 code strokes from January thru July 2020. 81 were during pre-COVID vs. 55 during active-COVID. 47 of 55 (96%) were swabbed, 2 (4%) of whom were positive. There was no difference between pre-COVID and active-COVID door to CT initiated time (16 mins [IQR 13-24] vs. 22 mins [IQR 13-25] p=0.75), door to CT resulted time (21 mins [IQR 15-26]) vs. 23 mins [IQR 16-29] p=0.63). 18 patients received tPA pre-COVID and 5 during active-COVID with no difference in DTN (pre: 37.5 mins [IQR 30-43] vs. active: 28 mins {IQR 26-41] p=0.37). Door to CT initiated was faster for those who had their COVID swab performed pre-CT (14 mins [IQR 11.5-16.5] p=0.034) vs. post-CT (20 mins [IQR 17-28]). Likewise, door to CT resulted was also faster pre-CT: 24 mins [IQR 19-32] vs. post-CT: 17 mins [IQR 15-23] (p=0.04).

Recent data suggests a high concentration of SARS-Cov2 receptors, ACE2 or TMPRSS2, in nasal epithelium and cornea, which explains person-to-person transmission. We investigated the prevalence of SARS-CoV2 receptors among reproductive tissues by exploring the single-cell sequencing datasets from uterus, myometrium, ovary, fallopian tube, and breast epithelium. We did not detect significant expression of either ACE2 or TMPRSS2 in the normal human myometrium, uterus, ovaries, fallopian tube, or breast. Furthermore, none of the cell types in the female reproductive organs we investigated, showed the co-expression of ACE2 with proteases, TMPRSS2, Cathepsin B (CTSB), and Cathepsin L (CTSL) known to facilitate the entry of SARS2-CoV2 into the host cell.

We have previously shown altered metabolism of DA-target structures, the ventral and dorsal striatum, between early and late abstinence. However, specific changes within the midbrain DA system were not investigated. Here, we investigated potential time and region-specific changes of activity in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) in rats that had extended or limited access to cocaine and later underwent a period of abstinence. We found that DA activity is decreased only in the VTA in rats with extended access to cocaine, with no changes in SNc DA activity. These changes in VTA DA activity may participate in the negative emotional state and in the incubation of drug seeking that occur during abstinence from cocaine.","Salin, Adélie; Lardeux, Virginie; Solinas, Marcello; Belujon, Pauline",Int. j. neuropsychopharmacol,,177

312302,Getting to the Source of Infodemics: It's the Business Model: A Report from Ranking Digital Rights,2020,"The rapid spread of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has become a global threat affecting almost all countries in the world. As countries reach the infection peak, it is planned to return to a new normal under different coexistence conditions in order to reduce the economic effects produced by the total or partial closure of companies, universities, shops, etc. Under such circumstances, the use of mathematical models to evaluate the transmission risk of COVID-19 in various facilities represents an important tool in assisting authorities to make informed decisions. On the other hand, agent-based modeling is a relatively new approach to model complex systems composed of agents whose behavior is described using simple rules. Different from classical mathematical models (which consider a homogenous population), agent-based approaches model individuals with distinct characteristics and provide more realistic results. In this paper, an agent-based model to evaluate the COVID-19 transmission risks in facilities is presented. The proposed scheme has been designed to simulate the spatiotemporal transmission process. In the model, simulated agents make decisions depending on the programmed rules. Such rules correspond to spatial patterns and infection conditions under which agents interact to characterize the transmission process. The model also includes an individual profile for each agent, which defines its main social characteristics and health conditions used during its interactions. In general, this profile partially determines the behavior of the agent during its interactions with other individuals. Several hypothetical scenarios have been considered to show the performance of the proposed model. Experimental results have demonstrated that the simulations provide useful information to produce strategies for reducing the transmission risks of COVID-19 within the facilities.","Cuevas, Erik",Comput Biol Med,,177

MATERIALS AND METHODS: PubMed, EMBASE and Cochrane databases were searched up to April 2020. Clinical and radiographic studies reporting on BBT of maxillary anterior teeth, with at least 10 patients were included. A meta-analysis was performed using random effect models to report differences of BBT. RESULTS: 50 studies were included. Using bone crest (BC) as a reference point, no significant differences were found in BBT between different tooth types, except for 0.16 mm (95%-CI:0.02-0.30) increased mid-root thickness of premolars compared to canines. Using the CEJ as a reference point, canines presented with a significantly increased thickness of 0.32 mm (95%-CI:0.11-0.54) coronally compared to laterals. When BC was used as reference, males demonstrated a significantly increased thickness of 0.21 mm (95%-CI:0.15-0.27) apically, while middle-aged adults showed a 0.06 mm (95%-CI:-0.12,-0.01) statistically significant increase in the coronal level compared to older adults. CONCLUSIONS: Few maxillary anterior teeth have BBT greater than 1mm.

To date, it has spread to more than 200 countries and has been declared a global pandemic. For appropriate preparedness, containment, and mitigation response, the stakeholders and policymakers require prior guidance on the propagation of SARS-CoV2. METHODOLOGY: This study aims to provide such guidance by forecasting the cumulative COVID-19 cases up to 4 weeks ahead for 187 countries, using four data-driven methodologies; autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), exponential smoothing model (ETS), and random walk forecasts (RWF) with and without drift. For these forecasts, we evaluate the accuracy and systematic errors using the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE), respectively. FINDINGS: The results show that the ARIMA and ETS methods outperform the other two forecasting methods. Additionally, using these forecasts, we generate heat maps to provide a pictorial representation of the countries at risk of having an increase in the cases in the coming 4 weeks of February 2021. CONCLUSION: Due to limited data availability during the ongoing pandemic, less data-hungry short-term forecasting models, like ARIMA and ETS, can help in anticipating the future outbreaks of SARS-CoV2.","Ahmad, Ghufran; Ahmed, Furqan; Rizwan, Muhammad Suhail; Muhammad, Javed; Fatima, Syeda Hira; Ikram, Aamer; Zeeb, Hajo",PLoS One,,177

Furthermore, the differential diagnosis between COVID-19 pneumonia and radiation pneumonitis in cancer patients remains a challenge. This study determined their clinical presentations and radiological features in order to early diagnose and separate COVID-19 pneumonia from radiation pneumonitis patients promptly. Methods and Findings: From January 21, 2020 to February 18, 2020, 112 patients diagnosed with suspected COVID-19 were selected consecutively. A retrospective analysis including all patients' presenting was performed. Four patients from 112 suspected individals were selected, including 2 males and 2 females with a median age of 54 years (range 39-64 years). After repeated pharyngeal swab nucleic acid tests, 1 case was confirmed and 3 cases were excluded from COVID-19 pneumonia. Despite the comparable morphologic characteristics of lung CT imaging, the location, extent, and distribution of lung lesions between COVID-19 pneumonia and radiation pneumonitis differed significantly. Conclusions: Lung CT imaging combined with clinical and laboratory findings can facilitate early diagnosis and appropriate management of COVID-19 pneumonia with a history of malignancy and radiation therapy.","Zeng, Qi; Tang, Caihua; Deng, Lisi; Li, Sheng; Liu, Jiani; Wang, Siyang; Shan, Hong",Int J Med Sci,,177

To determine if administration of convalescent plasma to patients with coronavirus disease 2019 increases antibodies to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 and improves outcome. DESIGN: Double-blind randomized controlled trial. SETTING: Hospital in New York. PATIENTS: Patients with polymerase chain reaction documented coronavirus disease 2019 infection. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomized (4:1) to receive 2 U of convalescent plasma versus standard plasma. Antibodies to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 were measured in plasma units and in trial recipients. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Enrollment was terminated after emergency use authorization was granted for convalescent plasma. Seventy-four patients were randomized. At baseline, mean (sd) Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score (23.4 [5.6] and 22.5 [6.6]), percent of patients intubated (19% and 20%), and median (interquartile range) days from symptom onset to randomization of 9 (6-18) and 9 (6-15), were similar in the convalescent plasma versus standard plasma arms, respectively. Convalescent plasma had high neutralizing activity (median [interquartile range] titer 1:526 [1:359-1:786]) and its administration increased antibodies to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 by 14.4%, whereas standard plasma administration led to an 8.6% decrease (p = 0.005). No difference was observed for ventilator-free days through 28 days (primary study endpoint): median (interquartile range) of 28 (2-28) versus 28 (0-28; p = 0.86) for the convalescent plasma and standard plasma groups, respectively. A greater than or equal to 2 point improvement in the World Health Organization scale was achieved by 20% of subjects in both arms (p = 0.99). All-cause mortality through 90 days was numerically lower in the convalescent plasma versus standard plasma groups (27% vs 33%; p = 0.63) but did not achieve statistical significance. A key prespecified subgroup analysis of time to death in patients who were intubated at baseline was statistically significant; however, sample size numbers were small.

METHODS: Eight databases were searched until April 10, 2021, for studies on cardiac markers, including B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP)/N-terminal pro-BNP (NT-proBNP), troponin, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), in MIS-C patients. RESULTS: Of the 2583 participants enrolled in 24 studies, 1613 patients were diagnosed with MIS-C. MIS-C patients exhibited higher BNP levels than patients with non-severe COVID-19 [SMD (95% CI): 1.13 (0.48, 1.77), p < 0.05]. No significant differences in BNP levels were observed between patients with MIS-C and severe COVID-19 [SMD (95% CI): 0.29 (-0.07, 0.65), p = 0.117]. Comparisons of MIS-C patients to all COVID-19 patients revealed no significant differences in levels of troponin [SMD (95% CI): 0.13 (-0.07, 0.32), p = 0.212] or AST [SMD (95% CI): 0.10 (-0.11, 0.31), p = 0.336]. Compared to patients with non-severe MIS-C, those with severe MIS-C exhibited higher levels of BNP [SMD (95% CI): 0.26 (0.04, 0.48), p < 0.05], but no differences in troponin [SMD (95% CI): 0.05 (-0.06, 0.16) p = 0.387] or AST [SMD (95% CI): 0.19 (-0.34, 0.71), p = 0.483] were observed. Moreover, there was no significant difference in BNP [SMD (95% CI): -0.21 (-1.07, 0.64), p = 0.624] or troponin [SMD (95% CI): -0.07 (-0.45, 0.31), p = 0.710] between MIS-C with and without coronary artery abnormality. Sensitivity analyses were performed to assess stability. No publication bias was detected based on Begg's test. CONCLUSIONS: The key cardiac marker that showed differences between patients with MIS-C/non-severe COVID-19 and between patients with severe/non-severe MIS-C was BNP. Other markers, such as troponin and AST, did not exhibit notable differences in indicating cardiac injury between patients with MIS-C and COVID-19.","Zhao, Yan; Patel, Jenil; Huang, Ying; Yin, Lijuan; Tang, Lei",Am J Emerg Med,,177

Globalization is a controversial topic due to its main features and effects. Debates in this contex generally focuses on the ""advantages and disadvantages"" of globalization. On one side of these debates, some advocate that with globalization, people's lives have significantly improved and countries have started to develop rapidly, while, on the other side, some argue that nature, culture, and human life have faced grave threats and ""global risk society"" is being built. Debates on global risk society seem to have accelerated in recent years. With the COVID-19 outbreak, that emerged in China in December 2019 and went global, leading to a pandemic, it is seen that debates on ""global risk society"" started again in the media and among social scientists.

In earlier self-report studies, increased gambling has been reported by a limited proportion of respondents characterized with a high degree of problem gambling. The present study, carried out with the same methodology and in the same geographical setting, around seven months later in the pandemic, aimed to repeat and to extend the understanding of potential gambling changes in the population during COVID-19. An anonymous sample of web panel members was assessed, altogether 2029 individuals (52% women, 10% moderate-risk or problem gamblers). Results indicated that 6% reported increased gambling, and 4% reported decreased gambling during the pandemic. Having increased gambling was associated with more severe gambling problems (OR 2.78, 95% confidence interval 2.27-3.40), increased alcohol consumption (OR 2.92, 1.71-4.98), and psychological distress (OR 3.38, 1.83-6.23). In the group reporting increased gambling during COVID-19, moderate-risk/problem gambling was very common (62%). Recent governmental policy interventions in the area were known to a minority (30%) of respondents, but awareness of the regulations was markedly more common in individuals with at least moderate-risk gambling (56%) and in self-excluders (78%). Reporting of any perceived influence from policy changes was low (3%), and divided between those reporting an increasing and decreasing effect, respectively. Increased gambling may be a consequence of COVID-19-related changes in everyday lives of individuals with problematic gambling patterns.

The impact of the pandemic and knowledge of obesity as a risk factor on the lived experience of people with obesity is not fully understood. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on people living with severe obesity (BMI &#8805;35 kg/m2 ), currently engaged in multi-modal treatment. The primary objectives were to examine the impact of the pandemic on their lived experience from a treatment and psychosocial standpoint and additionally explore their awareness of obesity as a risk factor for COVID-19 disease severity. An in-depth qualitative study was adopted employing semi-structured interviews with open-ended questions. Interpretive thematic analysis was adopted to analyse the data and identify key themes taking a grounded approach. Themes that emerged from the perspective of impact on lived experience were (a) challenge sustaining treatment and (b) psychosocial impact. There was an even split regarding awareness and lack of awareness of obesity as risk factor which itself contributes towards a negative psychosocial impact in most patients. The COVID-19 pandemic is posing a diverse challenge to people with obesity. This has implications for their on-going treatment. From an ethical standpoint, there is a need to fully elucidate the link between obesity and COVID-19, disseminate this information using people friendly language and imagery in a manner that does not exacerbate a harmful psychosocial response or lead to stigmatization.","Grannell, Andrew; le Roux, Carel W; McGillicuddy, Deirdre",Clin Obes,,177

A total of 31 cases were reported by April 10, and it increased to 95 by May 15. Thereafter, with the rapid increase in the number of COVID-19 cases in the general population since late March, there was a not surprising increase in the number of COVID-19 cases in dialysis patients. The mortality rate is 16.2% (16/99 cases) in dialysis patients, which is higher than 5.3% (874/16532 cases) in the general population. This higher mortality rate in dialysis patients with COVID-19 might be related to their age; the majority of COVID-19 cases are aged between 70 and 90 years in dialysis patients, compared with between 20 and 60 years in the general population. As COVID-19 presents with severe symptoms and is associated with a high mortality rate in dialysis patients, dialysis patients who have contracted SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing are required to be hospitalized under Japanese government policy. In cases of COVID-19 hospitalizations, it is essential to prevent nosocomial infection. Therefore, patients must be sufficiently instructed in infection prevention and robust measures to prevent contraction and spread of the infection must be taken at dialysis facilities.

We outline some of the challenges of remote working and how we are seeking to mitigate them, informed by the over-riding principle that individual relationships and the experiences of the child, young person and family must remain the central concern. The importance of maintaining a mentalising stance in remote working is discussed. We argue that a mentalising relationship which generates epistemic trust is possible in remote working, but this will require particular thought and effort on the part of the therapist. In particular, it is suggested that mentalising processes can be supported in remote working through, in the absence of the more implicit communications that are possible in face-to-face work, more explicit communications about mental states.","Fonagy, Peter; Campbell, Chloe; Truscott, Alexandra; Fuggle, Peter",Child Adolesc Ment Health,,177

In China, primary care has played a vital role during the COVID-19 outbreak, and it is important to examine the challenges faced by general practitioners (GPs). This study investigated the roles, preparedness and training needs of GPs in China in managing the NCP outbreak. Based on the outcomes of the study, we hope to take lessons and identify how GPs could be supported in delivering their gatekeeping roles and clinical duties in times of infectious disease outbreak. METHODS: An online survey on the official website of Shenzhen Continuing Education Center. It included questions on GPs' demographics, their awareness of COVID-19 and their preparedness in managing suspected cases of NCP, as well as referrals and their training needs. Conditional multi-variate logistic models were used to investigate the relationships between GPs' preparedness, situational confidence and anxiety. RESULTS: GPs' clinical practice was significantly affected. GPs endeavoured to answer a flood of COVID-19-related enquiries, while undertaking community preventive tasks. In addition to in-person consultations, GP promoted COVID-19 awareness and education through telephone consultations, physical posters and social media. Overall GPs in Shenzhen felt well supported with adequate Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) and resources from secondary care services. Higher levels of self-perceived preparedness (OR = 2.19; 95%CI, 1.04-4.61), lower level of anxiety (OR = 0.56; 95%CI, 0.29-1.09) and fewer perceived family worries (OR = 0.37; 95%CI, 0.12-1.12) were associated with better confidence in coping at work. CONCLUSIONS: Training and supporting GPs while reducing their (and their families') anxiety increase their confidence in delivering the important roles of gatekeeping in face of major disease outbreaks.","Tse, Desiree Man-Sik; Li, Zhuo; Lu, Ye; Li, Yang; Liu, Ying; Wong, William Chi Wai",BMC Fam Pract,,177

326394,Preface to Special Issue on 5th UK Catalysis Conference (UKCC 2019),2020,"Survival regression is used to estimate the relation between time-to-event and feature variables, and is important in application domains such as medicine, marketing, risk management and sales management. Nonlinear tree based machine learning algorithms as implemented in libraries such as XGBoost, scikit-learn, LightGBM, and CatBoost are often more accurate in practice than linear models. However, existing state-of-the-art implementations of tree-based models have offered limited support for survival regression. In this work, we implement loss functions for learning accelerated failure time (AFT) models in XGBoost, to increase the support for survival modeling for different kinds of label censoring. We demonstrate with real and simulated experiments the effectiveness of AFT in XGBoost with respect to a number of baselines, in two respects: generalization performance and training speed. Furthermore, we take advantage of the support for NVIDIA GPUs in XGBoost to achieve substantial speedup over multi-core CPUs. To our knowledge, our work is the first implementation of AFT that utilizes the processing power of NVIDIA GPUs. Starting from the 1.2.0 release, the XGBoost package natively supports the AFT model. The addition of AFT in XGBoost has had significant impact in the open source community, and a few statistics packages now utilize the XGBoost AFT model.","Barnwal, Avinash; Cho, Hyunsu; Hocking, Toby Dylan",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.04920v3.pdf,177

Findings show that Dutch GPs are positive about the quality of GP care and that they are satisfied with their profession. However, findings also show that there is room for improvement. (i) Work pressure and work-related stress among GPs is high in the Netherlands, which may be due to moves to substitute primary care for some hospital care. (ii) Dutch GPs are behind other high-income countries in their uptake of some digital applications (e.g. video consultations). (iii) According to Dutch GPs, pressure from patients, lack of time, and fear of complaints contributes to provision of low-value care.

The patients were divided into four groups according to age and into three groups (moderate, severe, and critical) according to the fifth edition of the Guidelines on the Diagnosis and Treatment of COVID-19 issued by the National Health Commission of China.Measurements and Main Results: The incidence of comorbidities was higher in the severe (46.3%) and critical (67.1%) groups than in the moderate group (37.8%). More patients were taking angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin II receptor blockers in the moderate group than in the severe and critical groups. More patients had multiple lung lobe involvement and pleural effusion in the critical group than in the moderate group. More patients received antiviral agents within the first 4 days in the moderate group than in the severe group, and more patients received antibiotics and corticosteroids in the critical and severe groups. Patients >75 years old had a significantly lower survival rate than younger patients.Conclusions: Multiple organ dysfunction and impaired immune function were the typical characteristics of patients with severe or critical illness. There was a significant difference in the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin II receptor blockers among patients with different severities of disease. Involvement of multiple lung lobes and pleural effusion were associated with the severity of COVID-19.

330380,A Report on the Cost of Data Privacy,2021-04-25,"BACKGROUND: Urban greening may reduce loneliness by offering opportunities for solace, social reconnection and supporting processes such as stress relief. We (i) assessed associations between residential green space and cumulative incidence of, and relief from, loneliness over 4 years; and (ii) explored contingencies by age, sex, disability and cohabitation status. METHODS: Multilevel logistic regressions of change in loneliness status in 8049 city-dwellers between 2013 (baseline) and 2017 (follow-up) in the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia study. Associations with objectively measured discrete green-space buffers (e.g. parks) (<400, <800 and <1600 m) were adjusted for age, sex, disability, cohabitation status, children and socio-economic variables. Results were translated into absolute risk reductions in loneliness per 10% increase in urban greening. RESULTS: The absolute risk of loneliness rose from 15.9% to 16.9% over the 4 years; however, a 10% increase in urban greening within 1.6 km was associated with lower cumulative incident loneliness [odds ratio (OR) = 0.927, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.862 to 0.996; absolute risk reduction = 0.66%]. Stronger association was observed for people living alone (OR = 0.828, 95% CI = 0.725 to 0.944). In comparison to people with <10% green space, the ORs for cumulative incident loneliness were 0.833 (95% CI = 0.695 to 0.997), 0.790 (95% CI = 0.624 to 1.000) and 0.736 (95% CI = 0.549 to 0.986) for 10-20%, 20-30% and >30% green space, respectively. Compared with the <10% green-space reference group with 13.78% incident loneliness over 4 years and conservatively assuming no impact on incident loneliness, associations translated into absolute risk reductions of 1.70%, 2.26% and 2.72% within populations with 10-20%, 20-30% and >30% green space, respectively. These associations were stronger again for people living alone, with 10-20% (OR = 0.608, 95% CI = 0.448 to 0.826), 20-30% (OR = 0.649, 95% CI = 0.436 to 0.966) and >30% (OR = 0.480, 95% CI = 0.278 to 0.829) green space within 1600 m. No age, sex or disability-related contingencies, associations with green space within 400 or 800 m or relief from loneliness reported at baseline were observed. CONCLUSIONS: A lower cumulative incidence of loneliness was observed among people with more green space within 1600 m of home, especially for people living alone.

First, we stress that inference is error-prone due to the modifiable areal unit problem and the modifiable temporal unit problem. The possibility of confounding from using aggregated data is substantial due to the neglect of person-level factors. Second, studying the viral transmission of COVID-19 solely on people's residential neighborhoods is problematic because people are also exposed to nonhome locations and environments en-route along their daily mobility path. We caution against an uncritical application of aggregated data and reiterate the importance of stronger research designs (e.g., case-control studies) on an individual level. To address environmental contextual uncertainties due to people's day-to-day mobility, we call for people-centered studies with mobile phone data.","Helbich, Marco; Mute Browning, Matthew H E; Kwan, Mei-Po",Sci Total Environ,,177

The aim of this case report was to determine the value of staying physically active during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, using online resources to prevent the harmful effects of sedentary behaviour under confined living conditions. A repatriated South African citizen was placed into monitored 14-day quarantine confined to a room, self-monitoring dietary intake and physical and health measures, while engaged in online exercise videos and indoor walking. This study demonstrates that structured indoor activity improves physical and mental health outcomes, despite prolonged sitting time during the day. During the current pandemic and in the presence of limited freedom of movement, sustained physical activity is made feasible by accessing online tools and resources, essentially reducing vulnerability to existing cardiovascular health concerns. However, these findings are based on a single participant and therefore further study is required.","Gradidge, Philippe Jean-Luc; Kruger, Herculina Salome",SAGE Open Med Case Rep,,177

333157,A call for food system change,2020,"Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) originated in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 has been declared pandemic by World Health Organization due to an exponential rise in the number of infected and deceased persons across the globe. Emerging reports suggest that susceptibility and mortality rates are higher in patients with certain comorbidities when compared to the average population. Cardiovascular diseases and diabetes are important risk factors for a lethal outcome of COVID-19. Extensive research ensuing the outbreak of coronavirus-related severe acute respiratory syndrome in the year 2003, and COVID-19 recently revealed a role of renin-angiotensin system (RAS) components in the entry of coronavirus wherein angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) had garnered the significant attention. This raises the question whether the use of RAS inhibitors, the backbone of treatment of cardiovascular, neurovascular, and kidney diseases could increase the susceptibility for coronavirus infection or unfortunate outcomes of COVID-19. Thus, currently, there is a lack of consensus regarding the effects of RAS inhibitors in such patients. Moreover, expert bodies like American Heart Association, American College of Cardiology, and so on have now released official statements that RAS inhibitors must be continued, unless suggested otherwise by a physician. In this brief review, we will elaborate on the role of RAS and ACE2 in pathogenesis of COVID-19. Moreover, we will discuss the potential effect of the use and disuse of RAS inhibitors in patients having COVID-19 with cardiometabolic comorbidities.","Sankrityayan, Himanshu; Kale, Ajinath; Sharma, Nisha; Anders, Hans-Joachim; Gaikwad, Anil Bhanudas",J Cardiovasc Pharmacol Ther,,177
333292,Using Machine Learning Algorithms to Predict People's Intention to Use Mobile Learning Platforms During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Machine Learning Approach,2021,"The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed a paradox in historical models of medical education: organizations responsible for applying consistent standards for progression have needed to adapt to training environments marked by inconsistency and change. Although some institutions have maintained their traditional requirements, others have accelerated their programs to rush nearly graduated trainees to the front lines. One interpretation of the unplanned shortening of the duration of training programs during a crisis is that standards have been lowered. But it is also possible that these trainees were examined according to the same standards as usual and were judged to have already met them. This paper discusses the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the current workforce, provides an analysis of how competency-based medical education (CBME) in the context of the pandemic might have mitigated wide-scale disruption, and identifies structural barriers to achieving an ideal state. The paper further calls upon universities, health centres, governments, certifying bodies, regulatory authorities, and health care professionals to work collectively on a truly time-variable model of CBME. The pandemic has made clear that time variability in medical education already exists and should be adopted widely and formally. If our systems today had used a framework of outcome competencies, sequenced progression, tailored learning, focused instruction, and programmatic assessment, we may have been even more nimble in changing our systems to care for our patients with COVID-19.","Caretta-Weyer, Holly A; Chan, Teresa; Bigham, Blair L; Kinnear, Benjamin; Huwendiek, Sören; Schumacher, Daniel J",Med Teach,,177

The various mitigation strategies implemented to control the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic could have additional, unintended benefits for limiting the spread of other infectious diseases and their associated burden on the health care system. METHODS: We conducted an interrupted time-series analysis using population-wide hospitalization data for the state of Victoria, Australia. Infection-related hospitalizations for children and adolescents (aged <18 years, total source population â¼1.4 million) were extracted using pre-defined International Classification of Diseases 10th Revision Australian Modification (ICD-10-AM) codes. The change in weekly hospitalization rates (incidence rate ratio, IRR) for all infections following the introduction of pandemic-related restrictions from 15 March 2020 was estimated. RESULTS: Over 2015-19, the mean annual incidence of hospitalization with infection among children less than 18 years was 37 per 1000 population. There was an estimated 65% (95% CI 62-67%) reduction in the incidence of overall infection-related hospitalizations associated with the introduction of pandemic restrictions. The reduction was most marked in younger children (at least 66% in those less than 5 years of age) and for lower respiratory tract infections (relative reduction 85%, 95% CI 85-86%). CONCLUSIONS: The wider impacts of pandemic mitigation strategies on non-COVID-19 infection-related hospitalizations are poorly understood. We observed marked and rapid decreases in hospitalized childhood infection. In tandem with broader consequences, sustainable measures, such as improved hand hygiene, could reduce the burden of severe childhood infection post-pandemic and the social and economic costs of hospitalization.","Todd, Isobel M F; Miller, Jessica E; Rowe, Stacey L; Burgner, David P; Sullivan, Sheena G",Int. j. epidemiol,,177
334045,Analysis and Dynamics of Fractional Order Mathematical Model of COVID-19 in Nigeria Using Atangana-Baleanu Operator,2021,"Background: The threat of COVID-19 infection has had dramatic impacts on the delivery of care at the University of Colorado Health (UCH) Outpatient Palliative Care Clinic (OPCC) at the Anschutz Cancer Pavilion. In preparation for COVID-19, UCH has placed a heavy emphasis on the availability of inpatient palliative care consults, reducing the providers available to see patients in clinic. In addition, all scheduled patient appointments in the OPPC were canceled or converted to telehealth visits. The combination of a reduced number of providers and disruption of the clinic schedule lead to concerns of patients being temporarily lost to follow-up and running out of long-acting or high dose opioid medications. This situation is particularly troubling in the face of COVID-19 since hospital admission for pain management would carry additional exposure risk. Methods: The OPPC 0.3 FTE faculty clinical pharmacist created a process for identifying and monitoring patients on long-acting or high-dose opioids, who would be at risk for withdrawal or pain crisis with abrupt discontinuation. The pharmacist built a report in the electronic medical record (EMR) that identified patients seen by OPCC providers in the past three months who are also prescribed opioids. This list was manually assessed to create a list of patients receiving high-dose and/or long-acting opioid medications prescribed by OPCC providers. Chart review was conducted to identify the primary OPCC provider, last appointment date, future appointment date, and opioid medications with last fill date and due date. Patients without follow-up were identified and scheduled. Reminders were scheduled in the EMR to prompt pharmacist to pend prescriptions to available providers to prevent interruption in pain management medications. Results: New and follow-up appointments conducted via telehealth or telephone;all members of multidisciplinary team are working remotely. The anticipated reduced availability of OPCC providers has not yet occurred. However, changes in staffing structure have disrupted the typical patient-provider continuity. The EMR report identified 135 patients who had been seen by OPCC providers in the last 90 days and who were also prescribed opioids. Patients receiving only 'as needed' opioids and those being prescribed opioids by non-OPCC providers were excluded. 45 patients were actively receiving long-acting and/or high dose opioids prescribed by OPCC providers. 15 (33%) of these patients did not have a future followup appointment scheduled. Patients were added and removed to the monitoring list over the course of the 33 days with a final patient count of 48. Clinic visit volumes remained unchanged from baseline. 34 EMR staff messages were sent by pharmacist regarding individual patients to coordinate follow-up appointments with timing appropriate based on next opioid prescriptions. 10 'bridging' opioid prescriptions were pended to providers for patients who could not be scheduled for follow-up prior to next prescription being due. The RPh spent an additional 14 hours of time working on this project and other clinic responsibilities, (an increase of 30% over 1 month). However, most of this was during the first two weeks following transition to telehealth (an increase of 58% over these two weeks). Over 33 days of monitoring 7 patients were admitted to hospitals within the UCH system. Of these seven patients, three patients had.","Rhein, E.

The aim of the study was to assess the role of melatonin in chronic dyspepsia in this group of women, and examine the role of Helicobacter infection. METHODS: The study comprised 152 subjects including 30 healthy women (Group I), 60 women with asymptomatic H.pylori infection (Group II), and 64 women with H. pylori infection with chronic dyspepsia (Group III). Endoscopic examination was performed, as well as histological assessment of gastric end duodenal mucosa, urease breath test (UBT-13C), and immunoenzymatic assessment of serum 17-ß-estradiol, follicle stimulating hormone and melatonin, and urinary 6-sulfatoxymelatonin. In Group III, 14-day antibacterial treatment was introduced with pantoprazole, amoxicillin and levofloxacin followed a six-month treatment with placebo in 32 women (Group IIIa), and melatonin 1 mg/morning and 3 mg/at bedtime in the other 32 women (Group IIIb). RESULTS: No significant differences were found between serum level of female hormone. Serum melatonin levels were similar between Group I (12.5 ± 2.72 pg/ml) and Group II (10.5 ± 3.73 pg/ml; p > 0,05). The level was significantly lower in Group III (5.72 ± 1.42 pg/ml; p < 0.001). Eradication of H.pylori was obtained in 75.0% women in Group IIIa, and in 84.3% in Group IIIb (p > 0.05). After six months, dyspeptic symptoms resolved in 43.7% patients in Group IIIa and 84.3% in Group IIIb (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Melatonin supplementation is useful in treating H. pylori-associated dyspepsia, particularly in postmenopausal women with lower levels of this hormone.

337061,Patient participation groups could provide huge voluntary support to the NHS,2021,"Diabetes is a leading cause of chronic kidney disease, and the high prevalence of sympathetic nervous system (SNS) hyperactivity in diabetic patients makes them further susceptible to SNS-mediated oxidative stress and accelerated kidney damage. Here, we investigated if canagliflozin can reverse isoprenaline (ISO)-induced renal oxidative damage in rats, a model that mimics SNS overstimulation-induced organ injuries in humans. We found that ISO administration elevates renal oxidative stress markers including malondialdehyde (MDA), advanced protein oxidation product (APOP), myeloperoxidase (MPO) and nitric oxide (NO), while depleting levels of endogenous antioxidants such as catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione (GSH). Strikingly, canagliflozin treatment of ISO-treated rats not only prevents elevation of oxidative stress markers but also rescues levels of depleted antioxidants. Our results also show that canagliflozin stimulates antioxidant/anti-inflammatory signaling pathways involving AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), Akt and eNOS, and inhibits iNOS and NADPH oxidase isoform 4 (NOX4), all of which are associated with oxidative stress and inflammation. Further, canagliflozin prevents ISO-induced apoptosis of kidney cells by inhibiting Bax protein upregulation and caspase-3 activation. Histological examination of kidney sections reveal that canagliflozin attenuates ISO-mediated increases in inflammatory cell infiltration, collagen deposition and fibrosis. Finally, consistent with these findings, canagliflozin treatment improves kidney function in ISO-treated rats, suggesting that the antioxidant effects may be clinically translatable.","Hasan, Raquibul; Lasker, Shoumen; Hasan, Ahasanul; Zerin, Farzana; Zamila, Mushfera; Parvez, Faisal; Rahman, Md Mizanur; Khan, Ferdous; Subhan, Nusrat; Alam, Md Ashraful",Sci Rep,,177

The absence of specific therapeutic treatment or effective vaccine against COVID-19 call for other avenues of the prevention and control measures. Media reporting is thought to be effective to curb the spreading of an emergency disease in the early stage. Cross-correlation analysis based on our collected data demonstrated a strong correlation between media data and the infection case data. Thus we proposed a deterministic dynamical model to examine the interaction of the disease progression and the media reports and to investigate the effectiveness of media reporting on mitigating the spread of COVID-19. The basic reproduction number was estimated as 5.3167 through parameterization of the model with the number of cumulative confirmed cases, the number of cumulative deaths and the daily number of media items. Sensitivity analysis suggested that, during the early phase of the COVID-19 outbreak, enhancing the response rate of the media reporting to the severity of COVID-19, and enhancing the response rate of the public awareness to the media reports, both can bring forward the peak time and reduce the peak size of the infection significantly. These findings suggested that besides improving the medical levels, media coverage can be considered as an effective way to mitigate the disease spreading during the initial stage of an outbreak.","Zhou, Wei Ke; Wang, Ai Li; Xia, Fan; Xiao, Yan Ni; Tang, San Yi",Math Biosci Eng,,177
338902,"Artificial intelligence vs COVID-19: limitations, constraints and pitfalls",2020,"BACKGROUND: Hydroxyurea is one of the earliest drugs that showed promise in the management of haemoglobinopathies that include ß-thalassaemia and sickle cell disease. Despite this, many aspects of hydroxyurea are either unknown or understudied; specifically, its usefulness in ß-thalassaemia major and haemoglobin E ß-thalassaemia is unclear. However, during COVID-19 pandemic, it has become a valuable adjunct to transfusion therapy in patients with ß-haemoglobinopathies. In this review, we aim to explore the available in vitro and in vivo mechanistic data and the clinical utility of hydroxyurea in ß-haemoglobinopathies with a special emphasis on its usefulness during the COVID-19 pandemic. MAIN BODY: Hydroxyurea is an S-phase-specific drug that reversibly inhibits ribonucleoside diphosphate reductase enzyme which catalyses an essential step in the DNA biosynthesis. In human erythroid cells, it induces the expression of Î³-globin, a fetal globin gene that is suppressed after birth. Through several molecular pathways described in this review, hydroxyurea exerts many favourable effects on the haemoglobin content, red blood cell indices, ineffective erythropoiesis, and blood rheology in patients with ß-haemoglobinopathies. Currently, it is recommended for sickle cell disease and non-transfusion dependent ß-thalassaemia. A number of clinical trials are ongoing to evaluate its usefulness in transfusion dependent ß-thalassaemia. During the COVID-19 pandemic, it was widely used as an adjunct to transfusion therapy due to limitations in the availability of blood and logistical disturbances. Thus, it has become clear that hydroxyurea could play a remarkable role in reducing transfusion requirements of patients with haemoglobinopathies, especially when donor blood is a limited resource. CONCLUSION: Hydroxyurea is a well-tolerated oral drug which has been in use for many decades. Through its actions of reversible inhibition of ribonucleoside diphosphate reductase enzyme and fetal haemoglobin induction, it exerts many favourable effects on patients with ß-haemoglobinopathies. It is currently approved for the treatment of sickle cell disease and non-transfusion dependent ß-thalassaemia. Also, there are various observations to suggest that hydroxyurea is an important adjunct in the treatment of transfusion dependent ß-thalassaemia which should be confirmed by randomised clinical trials.","Yasara, Nirmani; Premawardhena, Anuja; Mettananda, Sachith",Orphanet J Rare Dis,,177

There are several reports of gender differences related to infection and death due to COVID-19. This raises important questions such as ""Whether there are differences based on gender in risk and severity of infection or mortality rate?"" and ""What are the biological explanation and mechanisms underlying these differences?"" Emerging evidences have proposed sex-based immunological, genetic, and hormonal differences to explain this ambiguity. Besides biological differences, women have also faced social inequities and economic hardships due to this pandemic. Several recent studies have shown that independent of age males are at higher risk for severity and mortality in COVID-19 patients. Although susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 was found to be similar across both genders in several disease cohorts, a disproportionate death ratio in men can be partly explained by the higher burden of pre-existing diseases and occupational exposures among men. At immunological point of view, females can engage a more active immune response, which may protect them and counter infectious diseases as compared to men. This attribute of better immune responses towards pathogens is thought to be due to high estrogen levels in females. Here we review the current knowledge about sex differences in susceptibility, the severity of infection and mortality, host immune responses, and the role of sex hormones in COVID-19 disease.","Patil, Ashlesh; Tripathy, Jaya Prasad; Deshmukh, Vishwajit; Sontakke, Bharat; Tripathi, Satyendra C",Monaldi arch. chest dis,,177

342050,A Knowledge Management Approach to Complex Crises,2020,"OBJECTIVES: Due to the significant mortality and morbidity consequences of the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic among older adults, these individuals were urged to avoid going out in public and socializing with others, among other major disruptions to daily life. While these significant and often unavoidable disruptions have been shown to bear consequences for mental health, less attention has been devoted to behavioral changes, such as changes to sleeping or eating due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and their implications for emotional well-being. METHODS: We utilized data from a nationally representative survey of Medicare beneficiaries (aged &#8805;65 years), which was administered between June and October 2020 (n=3,122). We examine the relationship between self-reported changes to daily behaviors (e.g., sleep, drinking alcohol, and exercise) and emotional impacts of COVID-19 (i.e., feelings of depression and anxiety about the COVID-19 pandemic) using stepwise hierarchical multivariable Poisson regression. RESULTS: We found that worse sleep quality, sleeping more or less, watching more television, and walking less, were associated with more feelings of depression and anxiety about COVID-19. DISCUSSION: Previous research has shown a connection between the significant and often unavoidable disruptions to daily life due to the COVID-19 pandemic (e.g., sheltering-in-place) and adverse mental health symptoms. Less attention has been paid to potentially modifiable behaviors, such as sleep and exercise. Our findings highlight the behavioral changes associated with adverse emotional impacts among older adults during the COVID-19 pandemic. Future research may evaluate whether behavioral interventions may aim to attenuate the impact of pandemics on daily, modifiable behaviors to buffer against adverse emotional impacts.","Robbins, Rebecca; Weaver, Matthew D; Czeisler, Mark É; Barger, Laura K; Quan, Stuart F; Czeisler, Charles A",,,177

In the 1980's and 1990's, one has witnessed a substantial shift of production activities. Increasing production activities led to increasing wage levels and land rents in developing countries since. COVID-19 may be a trigger that will re-inforce the nearshoring process. This paper develops and applies a framework with a quantitative and a qualitative part, so as to verify how a selected nearshoring candidate country performs. The quantitative part relies on a chain cost calculation model, while the qualitative part uses appreciations given by the decision maker to ‘time’, ‘value’ and ‘cost’. The framework is applied to a case with production located in China. In doing so, it is important to determine which sector one belongs to, since different characteristics will play a different role depending on the sector. Furthermore, transport costs typically do not have the biggest share in total supply costs, but may be decisive as they determine also the lead time and hence the costs related to stocks. Finally, it turns out that qualitative decision factors – rather linked to perception and personal preferences – do not always match economic outcomes.","van Hassel, Edwin Vanelslander Thierry Neyens Kris Vandeborre Hans Kindt Dominique Kellens Stefan",Research in Transportation Economics,,177

Advance care planning in its traditional manner may be difficult to achieve given the unpredictability of the disease trajectory. Despite this, it is crucial that patients' care wishes are explored as this will help prevent inappropriate admissions to hospital and to critical care, improve symptom control and advocate for patient choice. This article provides practical tips on how to translate decisions around treatment escalation plans into conversations, both face-to-face and over the phone, in a sensitive and compassionate manner. Care planning conversations for patients with COVID-19 should be individualised and actively involve the patient. Focusing on goals of care rather than ceilings of treatment can help to alleviate anxiety around these conversations and will remind patients that their care will never cease. Using a framework such as the 'SPIKES' mnemonic can help to structure this conversation. Verbally conveying empathy will be key, particularly when wearing personal protective equipment or speaking to relatives over the phone.

344118,Optimal pricing model of car-sharing: market pricing or platform pricing,2021,"Episodic memories formed during infancy are rapidly forgotten, a phenomenon associated with infantile amnesia, the inability of adults to recall early-life memories. In both rats and mice, infantile memories, although not expressed, are actually stored long term in a latent form. These latent memories can be reinstated later in life by certain behavioral reminders or by artificial reactivations of neuronal ensembles activated at training. Whether the recovery of infantile memories is limited by developmental age, maternal presence, or contingency of stimuli presentation remains to be determined. Here, we show that the return of inhibitory avoidance memory in rats following a behavioral reactivation consisting of an exposure to the context (conditioned stimuli [CS]) and footshock (unconditioned stimuli [US]) given in a temporally unpaired fashion, is evident immediately after US and is limited by the developmental age at which the reactivations are presented; however, it is not influenced by maternal presence or the time interval between training and reactivation. We conclude that one limiting factor for infantile memory reinstatement is developmental age, suggesting that a brain maturation process is necessary to allow the recovery of a ""lost"" infantile memory.","Bisaz, Reto; Bessières, Benjamin; Miranda, Janelle M; Travaglia, Alessio; Alberini, Cristina M",Learn Mem,,177

Physicochemical properties of the adjuvant-protein antigen complexes, such as size, morphology, protein structure and binding, influence the overall efficacy and safety of the vaccine. Here we show how to perform an accurate physicochemical characterization of the nanoaluminum–ovalbumin complex. Using a combination of existing techniques, we developed a multi-staged characterization strategy based on measurements of increased complexity. This characterization cascade has the advantage of being very flexible and easily adaptable to any adjuvant-protein antigen combinations. It will contribute to control the quality of antigen–adjuvant complexes and immunological outcomes, ultimately leading to improved vaccines.","Guerrini, Giuditta Vivi Antonio Gioria Sabrina Ponti Jessica Magrì Davide Hoeveler Arnd Medaglini Donata Calzolai Luigi",Vaccines,,177

METHODS: We systematically searched the PubMed database up till April 2, 2020 and retrieved all the articles published on SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV that dealt with viral dynamics. RESULTS: Ample data is available to suggest the differences in etiology, transmission cycle, diagnosis, genetics, hosts, reproductive rates, clinical features, laboratory diagnosis and radiological features between SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. CONCLUSION: Although SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) is more infectious than SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV, most infections are generally mild and self-limiting. However, case-fatality rates are very high in patients with COVID-19 with comorbidities, compared to SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV.","Singh, Akriti; Shaikh, Altamash; Singh, Ritu; Singh, Awadhesh Kumar",Diabetes Metab Syndr,,177

Medical expert systems, especially in diagnosis and monitoring stages, can give positive consequences in the struggle against Covid-19. In this study, a rule-based expert system is designed as a predictive tool in self-pre-diagnosis of Covid-19. The potential users are smartphone users, healthcare experts and government health authorities. The system does not only share the data gathered from the users with experts, but also analyzes the symptom data as a diagnostic assistant to predict possible Covid-19 risk. To do this, a user needs to fill out a patient examination card that conducts an online Covid-19 diagnostic test, to receive an unconfirmed online test prediction result and a set of precautionary and supportive action suggestions. The system was tested for 169 positive cases. The results produced by the system were compared with the real PCR test results for the same cases. For patients with certain symptomatic findings, there was no significant difference found between the results of the system and the confirmed test results with PCR test. Furthermore, a set of suitable suggestions produced by the system were compared with the written suggestions of a collaborated health expert. The suggestions deduced and the written suggestions of the health expert were similar and the system suggestions in line with suggestions of the expert. The system can be suitable for diagnosing and monitoring of positive cases in the areas other than clinics and hospitals during the Covid-19 pandemic.

350079,Coronavirus and Care: How the Coronavirus Crisis Affected Fathers’ Involvement in Germany,2021,"Some concerns about the prescription of drugs acting on the renin-angiotensin system (angiotensin-converting enzyme 1 (ACE1) inhibitors, ACEi; angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers, ARB) have emerged due to SARS COV2 and COVID-19 pandemic. These very legitimate questions are directly the consequence of the recent recognition of the fundamental role of ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2) in COVID-19 infection. Indeed, SARS COV2 utilizes ACE2 as a membrane receptor to enter target cells. Consequently, the putative impact of drugs modulating the renin-angiotensin system on the risk of developing severe or fatal severe acute respiratory syndrome in case of COVID-19 infection emerged. As a membrane-bound enzyme (carboxypeptidase), ACE2 inactivates angiotensin II and therefore physiologically counters its effects. Due to a different structure compared with ACE1, ACE2 is insensitive to ACEIs. In vitro, both ARBs and ACEi appear able to upregulate ACE2 tissue expression and activity but these results were not confirmed in Humans. The exact impact of both ARBs and ACEis on COVID-19 infection is definitively known and preliminary results are even in favor of a protective role confers by these drugs. Due to the crucial role of ACE2, some groups support the hypothesis that a modulation of ACE2 expression could represent a valuable therapeutic target could confer protective properties against inflammatory tissue damage in COVID-19 infection. So, studies are currently ongoing to test the impact of elevated ACE2 membrane expression, administration of ARB and infusion of soluble ACE2. In summary, based on the currently available evidences and as recommended by several medical societies, ACEi or ARB should not be systematically discontinued because to date no safety signal was raised with the use of these drugs.","Alexandre, Joachim; Cracowski, Jean-Luc; Richard, Vincent; Bouhanick, Béatrice",Therapie,,177

Our objective is to assess patients' self-reported impact of healthcare lockdown measures on their fears and anxieties during the crisis period of the COVID-19 pandemic in New York City. METHODS: We conducted a digital, self-reported, patient care survey distributed by electronic mail (e-mail) at Columbia University's department of ophthalmology outpatient faculty practice. Inclusion criteria were age greater than or equal to 18 years, a diagnosis of either retinal disease or glaucoma and a cancelled or rescheduled ophthalmology established patient appointment during the acute phase of the COVID-19 pandemic in New York City. Patients without an e-mail address listed in their electronic medical record were excluded. The survey occurred between March 2, 2020 to May 30, 2o2o. Primary measures were survey responses to assess key areas of patient anxiety or concern during the pandemic including safety of care delivery in a COVID pandemic, difficulties contacting or being seen by their ophthalmologist, concern of vision loss or disease progression, and concern over missed or access to treatments. Secondary measures were correlating survey response to factors such as: visual acuity, intraocular pressure (IOP), diagnosis, disease severity, follow up urgency, recent treatments and diagnostic testing data. RESULTS: Of the 2,594 surveys sent out, 510 (19.66%) were completed. Over 95% of patients were at least as concerned as in normal circumstances about their ocular health during the peak of the pandemic. 76% of respondents were more concerned than normal that they could not be seen by their ophthalmologist soon enough. Increased concern over ocular health, disease progression and access to care all showed positive correlations (P<0.05) with worse disease severity as measured with testing such as visual fields and optical coherence tomography. Additionally, 55% of patients were afraid of contracting COVID-19 during an office visit. CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: We found a majority of our patients were concerned about limitations in access to ophthalmic care and were fearful of disease progression. Additionally, we found a number of demographic and clinical factors that correlated with increased anxiety in our patients.","Dar, Salman; De Moraes, Carlos Gustavo; Karani, Rabia; Khan, Sabine; Chen, Royce; Blumberg, Dana; Harizman, Noga; Krawitz, Brian; Valenzuela, Ives A; Aliancy, Joah; Tezel, Tongalp; Horowitz, Jason; Bearelly, Srilaxmi; Coleman, D Jackson; Chang, Stanley; Cioffi, George A; Liebmann, Jeffrey M",J. glaucoma,,177

In recognition of the severity of the outbreak, and having the longest shared border with China, the Government of Mongolia activated the State Emergency Committee in January, 2020, on the basis of the 2017 Disaster Protection Law. As a result, various public health measures have been taken that led to delaying the first confirmed case of COVID-19 until March 10, 2020, and with no intensive care admissions or deaths until July 6, 2020. These measures included promoting universal personal protection and preventions, such as the use of face masks and handwashing, restricting international travel, suspending all training and educational activities from kindergartens to universities, and banning major public gatherings such as the celebration of the national New Year holiday. These measures have been accompanied by active infection surveillance and self-isolation recommendations.

With very few success stories, the therapeutic targeting of this epidemic has been mainly attributed to main protease (Mpro), whilst Papain-like proteases (PLpro) also plays a vital role in the processing of replicase polyprotein. Multifunctional roles of PLpro such as viral polypeptide cleavage, de-ISGlyation and immune suppression have made it a promising drug target for therapeutic interventions. Whilst there have been a number of studies and others are on-going on repurposing and new-small molecule screening, albeit previously FDA approved drugs viz. Chloroquine (CQ) and Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) have only been found effective against this pandemic. Inspired by this fact, we have carried out molecular docking and dynamics simulation studies of FDA approved CQ and HCQ against SARS-CoV-2 PLpro. The end aim is to characterise the binding mode of CQ and HCQ and identify the key amino acid residues involved in the mechanism of action. Further, molecular dynamics simulations (MDS) were carried out with the docked complex to search for the conformational space and for understanding the integrity of binding mode. We showed that the CQ and HCQ can bind with better binding affinity with PLpro as compared to reference known PLpro inhibitor. Based on the presented findings, it can be anticipated that the SARS-CoV-2 PLpro may act as molecular target of CQ and HCQ, and can be projected for further exploration to design potent inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 PLpro in the near future.","Patel, Dhaval; Athar, Mohd; Jha, P C",J Biomol Struct Dyn,,177

In this study, we measured the level of SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG antibodies of male professional football players and compared the results with the standard PCR test to investigate the association between the two tests. STUDY DESIGN: Participants were male professional football players and team officials. Nasopharyngeal swabs and peripheral blood samples were collected for the PCR and serological tests, respectively. Also, previous records of COVID-19 testing and symptoms were gathered. Those with previous positive PCR tests who tested negative for the second time were considered to be recovered patients. RESULTS: Of the 1243 subjects, 222 (17.9%) were seropositive, while 29 (2.3%) tested positive for the SARS-CoV-2 PCR test. Sixty percent of symptomatic cases with a negative PCR were found to be seropositive. The mean level of IgM was significantly higher in PCR-positive and symptomatic subjects, whereas the recovered cases showed significantly higher levels of IgG. CONCLUSION: Our study revealed an inconsistency of results between the two tests; therefore, although application of serological assays alone seems insufficient in diagnosing COVID-19 disease, the findings are beneficial in the comprehension and the management of the disease.","Hassanmirzaei, Bahar; Haratian, Zohreh; Ahmadzadeh Amiri, Ali; Ahmadzadeh Amiri, Amir; Moghadam, Navid",Postgrad. med. j,,177

363323,Editorial: Special issue-emerging technologies and operational analytics,2020,"Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) disrupted the food system motivating discussions about moving from a dependence on long food supply channels toward shorter local supply channels, including urban agriculture. This study examines two central questions regarding the adoption of urban agriculture practices at the household level during the COVID-19 pandemic: whether the outbreak of the novel coronavirus elicited participation in urban agriculture (e.g., community growing and home growing) and what are the characteristics of individuals who participate. To answer these questions, we conducted two online surveys in Phoenix, AZ, and Detroit, MI. The first round occurred during 2017 and the second during the lock-down in 2020. Using bivariate probit models, we find that (1) considerably fewer individuals participate in urban agriculture at community gardens compared to at-home gardening; (2) participation overall is lower in 2020 compared to 2017; and (3) respondents in Detroit practice urban agriculture more than respondents in Phoenix. Across both cities, our results suggest that the continuity of individuals' participation in growing food at community gardens and home is fragile. Not all characteristics that determined who participated in community gardens before COVID-19 are determining the likelihood to participate during the pandemic. In addition, growing food at home before COVID-19 was practiced by larger households and employed respondents, yet, during the pandemic, we find that home-growing was more likely when children were in the household and households were smaller and younger (Detroit), and younger and more educated (Phoenix). These findings suggest that many urban households' food-growing practices may not yet be mainstream and that other barriers may exist that inhibit households' participation.","Chenarides, Lauren; Grebitus, Carola; Lusk, Jayson L; Printezis, Iryna",,,177

DESIGN: Living rapid review of observational and experimental studies with random-effects hierarchical Bayesian meta-analyses. Published articles and pre-prints were identified via MEDLINE and medRxiv. SETTING: Community or hospital, no restrictions on location. PARTICIPANTS: Adults who received a SARS-CoV-2 test or a COVID-19 diagnosis. MEASUREMENTS: Outcomes were SARS-CoV-2 infection, hospitalization, disease severity and mortality stratified by smoking status. Study quality was assessed (i.e. 'good', 'fair' and 'poor'). FINDINGS: Version 7 (searches up to 25 August 2020) included 233 studies with 32 'good' and 'fair' quality studies included in meta-analyses. Fifty-seven studies (24.5%) reported current, former and never smoking status. Recorded smoking prevalence among people with COVID-19 was generally lower than national prevalence. Current compared with never smokers were at reduced risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection [relative risk (RR) = 0.74, 95% credible interval (CrI) = 0.58-0.93, &#964; = 0.41]. Data for former smokers were inconclusive (RR = 1.05, 95% CrI = 0.95-1.17, &#964; = 0.17), but favoured there being no important association (21% probability of RR &#8805; 1.1). Former compared with never smokers were at somewhat increased risk of hospitalization (RR = 1.20, CrI = 1.03-1.44, &#964; = 0.17), greater disease severity (RR = 1.52, CrI = 1.13-2.07, &#964; = 0.29) and mortality (RR = 1.39, 95% CrI = 1.09-1.87, &#964; = 0.27). Data for current smokers were inconclusive (RR = 1.06, CrI = 0.82-1.35, &#964; = 0.27; RR = 1.25, CrI = 0.85-1.93, &#964; = 0.34; RR = 1.22, 95% CrI = 0.78-1.94, &#964; = 0.49, respectively), but favoured there being no important associations with hospitalization and mortality (35% and 70% probability of RR &#8805; 1.1, respectively) and a small but important association with disease severity (79% probability of RR &#8805; 1.1). CONCLUSIONS: Compared with never smokers, current smokers appear to be at reduced risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, while former smokers appear to be at increased risk of hospitalization, increased disease severity and mortality from COVID-19. However, it is uncertain whether these associations are causal.","Simons, David; Shahab, Lion; Brown, Jamie; Perski, Olga",Addiction,,177

In this pandemic period, the chance of incidental pulmonary findings suggestive of COVID-19 at F-FDG PET/CT in asymptomatic oncological patients is not negligible. To suspect COVID-19 is more demanding whether its presentation is atypical. We describe the incidental PET/CT detection of an F-FDG-avid isolated centrilobular pulmonary consolidation in an asymptomatic lymphoma patient, which later resulted in an unexpected and atypical COVID-19 presentation. The nuclear medicine physicians should be prepared to suspect COVID-19 even in asymptomatic patients presenting with a ""far-from-COVID-19"" finding at PET/CT.","Mattoli, Maria Vittoria; Taralli, Silvia; Pennese, Elsa; D039,; Angelo, Carla; Angrilli, Francesco; Villano, Carlo",Clin Nucl Med,,177

This increases the risk of morbidity, mortality and economic loss among COVID-19 patients. Therefore, there was an urgent need to investigate the extent and risk factors of thromboembolism among COVID-19 patients. English-language based databases (PubMed, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, EMBASE, and Cochrane library) were exhaustively searched to identify studies related to prevalence of thromboembolism among hospitalized COVID-19 patients. A random-effects model was employed to estimate the pooled prevalence of thromboembolism. The pooled prevalence of thrombotic events was computed using STATA 16.0 software. Heterogeneity analysis was reported using I2. A total of 19 studies with 2,520 patients with COVID-19 were included. The pooled prevalence of thrombotic events of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 was 33% (95% CI: 25-41%, I2 = 97.30%, p < 0.001) with a high degree of heterogeneity across studies. Elevated D-dimer hospitalized in the intensive care unit and being under mechanical ventilation were the most frequently associated factors for the development of thrombotic events. The pooled prevalence of thrombotic events in COVID-19 patients was 33%. The prevalence of thrombotic event is variables on the basis of study design and study centers. Several risk factors such as, elevated D-dimer, hospitalized in the intensive care unit and being under mechanical ventilation, were the most frequently reported risk factors identified. Therefore, healthcare professionals should consider these risk factors to optimally manage thromboembolism in COVID-19 patients.","Kefale, Belayneh; Tegegne, Gobezie T; Degu, Amsalu; Tadege, Melaku; Tesfa, Desalegn",Clin Appl Thromb Hemost,,177

With the recent outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), many cases of ocular manifestation in association with this disease have been reported. However, as yet we have no complete understanding of this condition. We report here the first case of FBA in a human immunodeficiency virus-infected patient with coexisting cytomegalovirus (CMV) and COVID-19 infection. CASE PRESENTATION: A 33-year-old Malay man with underlying acquired immunodeficiency syndrome receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy was referred to the Opthalmology Department with complaints of blurry vision for the past 2 months. He had tested positive for and been diagnosed with COVID-19 1 month previously. Clinical examination of the fundus revealed extensive perivascular sheathing of both the artery and vein suggestive of FBA in the right eye. Laboratory testing of nasal swabs for COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and serum CMV antibody were positive. The patient was then admitted to the COVID-19 ward and treated with intravenous ganciclovir. CONCLUSION: Clinicians should be aware of and take the necessary standard precautions for possible coexistence of COVID-19 in an immunocompromised patient presenting with blurred vision, eye redness, dry eye and foreign body sensation despite the absence of clinical features suggestive of COVID-19. Whether FBA is one of the ocular signs of co-infection of COVID-19 and CMV remains unknown. Further studies are needed to provide more information on ocular signs presented in patients with concurrent COVID-19 and CMV infections.","Lim, Tsu Hong; Wai, Yong Zheng; Chong, Jia Cherng",J Med Case Rep,,177

Based on the results of the interview, it was found that the teachers at Nurul Fadhilah school did not yet have the readiness to manage online teaching and learning activities, especially in science subjects. The influencing factors are (1) understanding of basic science concepts (physics, chemistry, biology), (2) understanding of systematic online learning management and (3) mastery of Learning Management System (LMS) technology. Therefore, the aim of this activity is to implement LMS technology in the management of online science learning using a basic conceptual approach to chemistry education. LMS is a technology application developed specifically for managing classrooms, distributing learning materials and enabling collaboration between students and teachers online. The LMS used in this activity is Google Classroom. Based on the data, it is known that 65% of the teachers at Nurul Fadhilah School have not managed online science teaching and learning activities using LMS technology. The results of the systematic online science learning management workshop using the basic concepts of chemistry education and the implementation of LMS technology, especially Google Classroom, showed an increase, as many as 80% of teachers have created, designed and managed classes interactively using Google Classroom LMS technology and have integrated the concept of basic chemistry education in science learning.

OBJECTIVE: To carry out a systematic review of the use of telepractice during the COVID-19 pandemic for providing speech pathology interventions for Spanish-speaking children with cleft palate. METHODS: In July and August 2020, the authors searched the electronic databases Medline, LILACS, SciELO, and the Cochrane Library using the following keywords in English (MeSH): Cleft palate combined with Early intervention, Speech therapy, Rehabilitation of speech and language disorders, Speech production measurement, Speech articulation tests and Telemedicine. Original articles were selected and analyzed, complemented by an analysis of flowcharts and recommendations by the GES Clinical Guide of Cleft Lip and Palate of Chile's Government and the authors' expert opinions. RESULTS: A total of 2680 articles were retrieved, of which 23 were critically analyzed and used to adapt the early stimulation, evaluation, and treatment of children with CP to speech therapy telepractice at the Gantz Foundation, a Hospital in Santiago de Chile. LIMITATIONS: Only three researchers carried out a quick review, which limited the depth of individual analysis of the studies included. Also, the suggestions and material presented should be evaluated in future investigations. CONCLUSION: This systematic review provides useful guidelines for providing speech pathology interventions through telepractice for children with cleft palate. Audiovisual materials seem to be extremely useful for families receiving the interventions. The use of interactive videos for Spanish-speaking children and educational videos for parents is manifest.","Palomares-Aguilera, Mirta; Inostroza-Allende, Felipe; Solar, Loreley Riquelme",Int J Pediatr Otorhinolaryngol,,177

368344,Nanotechnology: A novel tool to enhance the bioavailability of micronutrients,2021,"BACKGROUND Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is a life-threatening disease characterized by an intense immunologic response that results in multiorgan dysfunction. It typically manifests as a result of a familial genetic immunodeficiency disorder or secondary to a trigger such as an infection, malignancy, or autoimmune disease. The major factors involved in the development of the disease are an individual's genetic propensity to develop HLH, such as rare associated mutations, or inflammatory processes that trigger the immune system to go haywire. CASE REPORT Before the COVID-19 pandemic, a 22-year-old woman with a history of congenital absence of the right kidney, right-sided hearing loss, and leukopenia presented with a 3-week history of generalized malaise, fever, chest pain, cough, and shortness of breath. She developed an acute systemic cytomegalovirus infection further complicated by HLH. Based on her history and clinical course, an underlying primary immunodeficiency was suspected. An immunodeficiency gene panel revealed a monoallelic mutation in GATA2, a gene that encodes zinc-transcription factors responsible for the regulation of hematopoiesis. CONCLUSIONS GATA2 deficiency encompasses a large variety of mutations in the GATA2 gene and leads to disorders associated with hematologic and immunologic manifestations of monocytopenia and B-, and natural killer-cell deficiency. Over time, affected individuals are at high risk of developing life-threatening infections and serious hematologic complications, such as myelodysplastic syndromes and/or leukemias. We aimed to illustrate the importance of identifying an underlying genetic disorder associated with secondary HLH to help guide acute and long-term management.","Burak, Nicole; Jan, Naveed; Kessler, Jason; Oei, Erwin; Patel, Priya; Feldman, Scott",Am J Case Rep,,177
368384,How Information Diffuse in a Nomination Network,2021-02-05,"Importance: Nasopharyngeal swab nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT) is the noninvasive criterion standard for diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, it requires trained personnel, limiting its availability. Saliva NAAT represents an attractive alternative, but its diagnostic performance is unclear. Objective: To assess the diagnostic accuracy of saliva NAAT for COVID-19. Data Sources: In this systematic review, a search of the MEDLINE and medRxiv databases was conducted on August 29, 2020, to find studies of diagnostic test accuracy. The final meta-analysis was performed on November 17, 2020. Study Selection: Studies needed to provide enough data to measure salivary NAAT sensitivity and specificity compared with imperfect nasopharyngeal swab NAAT as a reference test. An imperfect reference test does not perfectly reflect the truth (ie, it can give false results). Studies were excluded if the sample contained fewer than 20 participants or was neither random nor consecutive. The Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies 2 tool was used to assess the risk of bias. Data Extraction and Synthesis: Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses reporting guideline was followed for the systematic review, with multiple authors involved at each stage of the review. To account for the imperfect reference test sensitivity, we used a bayesian latent class bivariate model for the meta-analysis. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was pooled sensitivity and specificity. Two secondary analyses were performed: one restricted to peer-reviewed studies, and a post hoc analysis limited to ambulatory settings. Results: The search strategy yielded 385 references, and 16 unique studies were identified for quantitative synthesis. Eight peer-reviewed studies and 8 preprints were included in the meta-analyses (5922 unique patients). There was significant variability in patient selection, study design, and stage of illness at which patients were enrolled. Fifteen studies included ambulatory patients, and 9 exclusively enrolled from an outpatient population with mild or no symptoms. In the primary analysis, the saliva NAAT pooled sensitivity was 83.2% (95% credible interval [CrI], 74.7%-91.4%) and the pooled specificity was 99.2% (95% CrI, 98.2%-99.8%). The nasopharyngeal swab NAAT had a sensitivity of 84.8% (95% CrI, 76.8%-92.4%) and a specificity of 98.9% (95% CrI, 97.4%-99.8%). Results were similar in secondary analyses. Conclusions and Relevance: These results suggest that saliva NAAT diagnostic accuracy is similar to that of nasopharyngeal swab NAAT, especially in the ambulatory setting. These findings support larger-scale research on the use of saliva NAAT as an alternative to nasopharyngeal swabs.","Butler-Laporte, Guillaume; Lawandi, Alexander; Schiller, Ian; Yao, Mandy C; Dendukuri, Nandini; McDonald, Emily G; Lee, Todd C",JAMA intern. med.

This article aims to explore the discursive and linguistic means by which the COVID-19 pandemic, as a macro-event, has been translated into local micro-events. The analysis studies the global pandemic through the initial statements of 29 leading political actors across four continents. The aim is to examine discursive constructions of solidarity and nationalism through the social representation of inclusion/exclusion of in-, out-, and affiliated groups. The comparative analysis is based on the theoretical and methodological framework of the socio-cognitive approach to critical discourse analysis and is informed by argumentation theory and nationalism studies. The results of our analysis suggest that leaders have constructed the virus as the main outgroup through the metaphors of the pandemic-as-war and the pandemic-as-movement which have entered the national space. Faced with this threat, these speeches have discursively constructed the nation-as-a-team as the main in-group and prioritized (1) a vertical type of solidarity based on nationhood and according to governmental plans;(2) exclusionary solidarity against rule-breakers;(3) horizontal solidarity that is both intergenerational and among family members, and (4) transnational solidarity. It is not by chance that the world stands as a relevant affiliated group that needs to forcibly collaborate in order to face the main outgroup, the virus itself. A major consensus has been found in constructing the out-group. In contrast, the linguistic and discursive constructions of in-groups and their affiliates display a greater variation, depending upon the prevalent discursive practices and social context within different countries.","Berrocal, Martina Kranert Michael Attolino Paola Santos Júlio Antonio Bonatti Santamaria Sara Garcia Henaku Nancy Koffi Aimée Danielle Lezou Marziani Camilla Mažeikienė Viktorija Pérez Dasniel Olivera Kumaran Rajandran Salamurović Aleksandra",Humanities &amp; Social Sciences Communications,,177

The large, infrequently accessed input data is stored on tape storage. The smaller, frequently accessed derived data is stored on disk storage. In a best case scenario, the large input data is only accessed very infrequently and in a well planned pattern. However, practice shows that often the data has to be processed continuously and unpredictably. This can significantly reduce tape storage performance. A common approach to counter this is storing copies of the large input data on disk storage. This contribution evaluates an approach that uses cloud storage resources to serve as a flexible cache or buffer depending on the computational workflow. The proposed model is elaborated for the case of continuously processed data. For the evaluation, a simulation was developed, which can be used to evaluate models related to storage and network resources. We show that using commercial cloud storage can reduce the on-premises disk storage requirements, while maintaining an equal throughput of jobs. Moreover, the key metrics of the model are discussed and an approach is described that uses the simulation to assist with the decision process of using commercial cloud storage. The goal is to investigate approaches and propose new evaluation methods to overcome the future data challenges.","Wegner, Tobias; Lassnig, Mario; Ueberholz, Peer; Zeitnitz, Christian",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.03201v1.pdf,177
371359,The critical futurist: Richard Slaughter’s foresight practice,2021,"The COVID-19 pandemic forced dental professionals to cope with an unexpected challenge and caused an abrupt cessation of conventional care practices. The high degree of contagiousness as well as the diffusion of the virus through the air and droplets via respiratory transmission placed dental professionals at top-level risk of contracting and spreading the disease. General recommendations were announced in different countries, including patient distancing, air ventilation, surface and instrument sanitization, and the wearing of suitable masks and shields. However, many dental treatments are performed using lasers, and some specific precautions must be added to conventional procedures to ensure the advantages of this technology to patients because of the particular tissue­matter interaction effects of laser wavelengths. Based on the literature, the authors evaluated all of using laser wavelengths to analyze the risk and the benefits of using lasers in daily dental practice, and to provide safety recommendations during pandemic. An unrestricted search of indexed databases was performed. Laser use effects were categorized into: 1) explosive processes that produce tissue ablation and aerosol formation; 2) thermal actions that create vaporization and smoke plume; 3) photobiomodulation of the cells; and 4) enhanced chemical activity. Knowledge of the device functions and choice of adequate parameters will reduce aerosol and plume formation, and the application of suction systems with high flow volume and good filtration close to the surgical site will avoid virus dissemination during laser use. In the categories that involve low energy, the beneficial effects of lasers are available and sometimes preferable during this pandemic because only conventional precautions are required. Lasers maintain the potential to add benefits to dental practice even in the COVID-19 era, but it is necessary to know how lasers work to utilize these advantages. The great potential of laser light, with undiscovered limits, may provide a different path to face the severe health challenges of this pandemic.","Arnabat-Dominguez, Josep; Vecchio, Alessandro Del; Todea, Carmen; Grzech-Lesniak, Kinga; Vescovi, Paolo; Romeo, Umberto; Nammour, Samir",Adv Clin Exp Med,,177

Despite being clinically cured, some patients still find it difficult to return to their normal life and work due to the varying degree of dysfunctions that they have, as part of the disease's aftereffect. Through this study, we aim to learn more about the dysfunctions and rehabilitation needs of COVID-19 patients. METHODS: In this survey, the basic information, dysfunctions, and rehabilitation needs of the hospitalized COVID-19 patients, who were selected by convenience sampling in Hubei Provincial Hospital of Integrated Traditional Chinese and Western Medicine, were obtained using a self-designed questionnaire. The research was conducted from February 29, 2020 to March 2, 2020. RESULTS: A total of 280 patients were finally included, who were mainly over 51 years of age (64.2%). The main physical dysfunctions that the patients had were sleep disorders (63.6%), decreased activity endurance (61.4%), and respiratory dysfunction (57.9%), while the main psychological dysfunctions included anxiety (62.1%) and fear (50.0%). Rehabilitation that mainly requested by the patients included exercise guidance, dietary instruction, traditional Chinese medicine therapy, physical therapy, and Chinese traditional health exercises. CONCLUSIONS: The demand for rehabilitation is high among COVID-19 patients, which requires the quick establishment of a comprehensive and individualized rehabilitation program, to be fulfilled.","Li, Zhengliang; Zheng, Chanjuan; Duan, Can; Zhang, Yangpu; Li, Qinglin; Dou, Zulin; Li, Jianan; Xia, Wenguang",Eur J Phys Rehabil Med,,177

We aimed to assess health literacy, disease knowledge, treatment dissatisfaction and biologics attitudes toward COVID-19. We performed a cross-sectional, questionnaire-based survey on 98/105 consecutive dermatological patients treated with biologics-51 suffering from plaque psoriasis, 22 from atopic dermatitis, and 25 from hidradenitis suppurativa. An ad hoc, validated questionnaire has 44 items investigating the following domains: knowledge of COVID-19 related to (a) epidemiology, (b) pathogenesis, (c) clinical symptoms, (d) preventive measures, and (e) attitudes. Patients data and questionnaires were collected. Despite only 8.1% thought that biologics may increase the risk of COVID-19, 18.4% and 21.4% of the patients were evaluating the possibility to discontinue or modify the dosage of the current biologic therapy, respectively. Globally, male patients (P = .001) with higher scholarity level (P = .005) displayed higher knowledge of COVID-19. Patients with lower DLQI (P = .006), longer disease duration (P = .051) and lower scholarity (P = .007) have thought to discontinue/modify autonomously their biologic therapy. At the multivariate logistic regression, only the knowledge of epidemiology and preventive measures resulted independent predictors of continuation vs discontinuation and modification vs no modification, respectively.

In Ecuador, the first case of COVID-19 was recorded on 29 February 2020. Despite efforts to control its spread, SARS-CoV-2 overran the Ecuadorian public health system, which became one of the most affected in Latin America on 24 April 2020. The Hospital General del Sur de Quito (HGSQ) had to transition from a general to a specific COVID-19 health center in a short period of time to fulfill the health demand from patients with respiratory afflictions. Here, we summarized the implementations applied in the HGSQ to become a COVID-19 exclusive hospital, including the rearrangement of hospital rooms and a triage strategy based on a severity score calculated through an artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted chest computed tomography (CT). Moreover, we present clinical, epidemiological, and laboratory data from 75 laboratory tested COVID-19 patients, which represent the first outbreak of Quito city. The majority of patients were male with a median age of 50 years. We found differences in laboratory parameters between intensive care unit (ICU) and non-ICU cases considering C-reactive protein, lactate dehydrogenase, and lymphocytes. Sensitivity and specificity of the AI-assisted chest CT were 21.4% and 66.7%, respectively, when considering a score >70%; regardless, this system became a cornerstone of hospital triage due to the lack of RT-PCR testing and timely results. If health workers act as vectors of SARS-CoV-2 at their domiciles, they can seed outbreaks that might put 1,879,047 people at risk of infection within 15 km around the hospital.

377469,Using country-level variables to classify countries according to the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases: An unsupervised machine learning approach [version 1;peer review: awaiting peer review],2020,"BACKGROUND: Drug overdose is the leading cause of death after release from prison, and this risk is significantly higher among women compared to men. Within the first 2 weeks after release, the risk of death from drug overdose is 12.7 times higher than the general population, with risk of death further elevated among females. Although female inmates have higher rates of opioid use disorder and post-release overdose fatality, justice-involved women are under-represented in studies of medications for opioid use disorder. The Reducing Overdose After Release from Incarceration (ROAR) pilot intervention and evaluation (recruitment June 2019 through December 2020) aims to reduce opioid overdose among women released to the community following incarceration in state prison. The evaluation further assesses induction, acceptance and effectiveness of extended release naltrexone in a female post-prison population. METHODS/DESIGN: In the week prior to their release, female adults in custody with moderate to severe opioid use disorder start treatment with extended release naltrexone, an injectable opioid antagonist that blocks the effects of opioids for up to 1 month. All ROAR participants receive training to use naloxone rescue kits and are provided nasal naloxone at release. Ongoing support from a certified recovery mentor to facilitate sustained engagement with treatment for substance use disorders begins in the month prior to release from prison and continues for 6 months in community. We evaluate the association between ROAR participation and the primary outcome of opioid overdose. Using administrative data provided by the Oregon Department of Corrections and the Oregon Health Authority, we compare the odds of overdose among ROAR participants versus a comparison group of females released from prison during the study period. Evaluation activities in community includes survey and qualitative interviews for 6 months post release, as well as a review of clinic records to assess retention on medication among the pilot cohort (N = 100). DISCUSSION: ROAR is a collaboration between Oregon's public health, criminal justice, and medical communities. The ROAR intervention and evaluation provide critical information on improving interventions to prevent opioid overdose and improve retention on treatment in community in an overlooked, high-risk population: incarcerated women re-entering the community.

Due to its rapid transmission and high case-fatality rate, recognition of its risk and prognostic factor is important. Obesity has been associated with impaired immune system, increasing the susceptibility for 2019-nCoV infection. We aimed to study the impact of obesity to the prognosis and disease severity of COVID-19. METHODS: A systematic search and handsearching was conducted in four databases: Cochrane, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PubMed. The identified articles were screened using the chosen eligibility criteria. We obtained three retrospective cohort studies (Wu J et al., Lighter J et al., and Simonnet A et al.) to be critically appraised using Newcastle Ottawa Scale. RESULTS: The findings of all included studies were consistent in stating the contribution of obesity as a risk factor to increase the requirement for advanced medical care. Study with the highest quality, Simonnet A et al., reported an increase need of invasive mechanical ventilation in COVID-19 patients with body mass index higher than 35 kg/m2, OR: 7.36 (1.63-33.14; p = 0.021). This is associated with a higher mortality rate in obese population infected with COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Obesity is an independent risk and prognostic factor for the disease severity and the requirement of advanced medical care in COVID-19. This systematic review highlights a particularly vulnerable group - obese, and emphasises on the importance of treatment aggression and disease prevention in this population group.","Tamara, Alice; Tahapary, Dicky L",Diabetes Metab Syndr,,177
379466,COVID-19 Mortality Risk Prediction Using X-Ray Images,2021,"Societal responses to crises require coordination at multiple levels of organization. Exploring early efforts to contain COVID-19 in the U.S., we argue that local governments can act to ensure systemic resilience and recovery when higher-level governments fail to do so. Event history analyses show that large, more urban areas experience COVID-19 more intensely due to high population density and denser socioeconomic networks. But metropolitan counties were also among the first to adopt shelter-in-place orders. Analyzing the statistical predictors of when counties moved before their states, we find that the hierarchy of counties by size and economic integration matters for the timing of orders, where both factors predict earlier shelter-in-place orders. In line with sociological theories of urban governance, we also find evidence of an important governance dimension to the timing of orders. Liberal counties in conservative states were more than twice as likely to adopt a policy and implement one earlier in the pandemic, suggesting that tensions about how to resolve collective governance problems are important in the socio-temporal dynamic of responses to COVID-19. We explain this behavior as a substitution effect in which more urban local governments, driven by risk and necessity, step up into the action vacuum left by higher levels of government and become national policy leaders and innovators.","Brandtner, Christof; Bettencourt, Luís M A; Berman, Marc G; Stier, Andrew J",PLoS One,,177

The aim of the present study was to develop and evaluate the performance characteristics of a new Bioelectric Recognition Assay (BERA) regarding Sars-CoV-2 detection in clinical samples and its potential to be used as a point of care test. MATERIALS AND METHODS: All tests were performed using a custom portable hardware device developed by EMBIO DIAGNOSTICS (EMBIO DIAGNOSTICS Ltd, Cyprus). 110 positive and 136 negative samples tested by RT-PCR were used in order to define the lower limit of detection (L.O.D.) of the system, as well as the sensitivity and the specificity of the method. RESULTS: The system was able to detect a viral concentration of 4 genome copies/µL. The method displayed total sensitivity of 92.7 % (95 %CI: 86.2-96.8) and 97.8 % specificity (95 %CI: 93.7-99.5). When samples were grouped according to the recorded Ct values the BERA biosensor displayed 100.00 % sensitivity (95 %CI: 84.6-100.0) for Ct values <20-30. For the aforementioned Ct values the Positive Predictive Value (PPV) of the method was estimated at 31.4 % for COVID-19 prevalence of 1% and at 70.5 % for 5% prevalence. At the same time the Negative Predictive Value (NPV) of the BERA biosensor was at 100.0 % for both prevalence rates. CONCLUSIONS: EMBIO DIAGNOSTICS BERA for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection has the potential to allow rapid and cost-effective detection and subsequent isolation of confirmed cases, and therefore reduce household and community transmissions.","Apostolou, Theofylaktos; Kyritsi, Maria; Vontas, Alexandros; Loizou, Konstantinos; Hadjilouka, Agni; Speletas, Mathaios; Mouchtouri, Varvara; Hadjichristodoulou, Christos",J Virol Methods,,177

DATA SOURCES: Published literature obtained through PubMed database searches and reports from national and international public health agencies. STUDY SELECTIONS: Studies relevant to the basic science, epidemiology, clinical characteristics, and treatment of SARS, MERS, and COVID-19 with a focus on patients with asthma, allergy, and primary immunodeficiency. RESULTS: Whereas SARS and MERS each caused less than a thousand deaths, COVID-19 has caused a worldwide pandemic with nearly 1 million deaths. Diagnosing COVID-19 relies of nucleic acid amplification tests, and infection has broad clinical manifestations that can affect almost every organ system. Asthma and atopy do not appear to predispose patients to COVID-19 infection, but their effects on COVID-19 clinical outcomes remain mixed and inconclusive. It is recommended that effective therapies, including inhaled corticosteroids and biologic therapy, be continued to maintain disease control. There are no reports of COVID-19 among patients with primary innate and T-cell deficiencies. The presentation of COVID-19 among patients with primary antibody deficiencies is variable, with some experiencing mild clinical courses while others experiencing fatal.

387162,Multiobjective Route Selection Based on LASSO Regression: When Will the Suez Canal Lose Its Importance?,2021,"The global coronavirus pandemic overwhelmed many health care systems, enforcing lockdown and encouraged work from home to control the spread of the virus and prevent overrunning of hospitalized patients. This prompted a sharp widespread use of telehealth to provide low-risk care for patients. Nevertheless, a continuous mutation into new variants and widespread unavailability of test kits, especially in developing countries, possess the challenge to control future potential waves of infection. In this paper, we propose a novel Smartphone application-based platform for early diagnosis of possible Covid-19 infected patients. The application provides three modes of diagnosis from possible symptoms, cough sound, and specific blood biomarkers. When a user chooses a particular setting and provides the necessary information, it sends the data to a trained machine learning (ML) model deployed in a remote server using the internet. The ML algorithm then predicts the possibility of contracting Covid-19 and sends the feedback to the user. The entire procedure takes place in real-time. Our machine learning models can identify Covid-19 patients with an accuracy of 100%, 95.65%, and 77.59% from blood parameters, cough sound, and symptoms respectively. Moreover, the ML sensitivity for blood and sound is 100%, which indicates correct identification of Covid positive patients. This is significant in limiting the spread of the virus. The multimodality offers multiplex diagnostic methods to better classify possible infectees and together with the instantaneous nature of our technique, demonstrates the power of telehealthcare as an easy and widespread low-cost scalable diagnostic solution for future pandemics.","Shams, Abdullah Bin; Raihan, Md.

Many people have become physically inactive and developed irregular eating patterns, which leads to unhealthier lifestyles and aggravation of lifestyle-related diseases; these in turn increase the severity of COVID-19. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, we developed a smartphone application called ""Taberhythm"" to investigate eating patterns, physical activity, and subjective feelings of happiness. We aimed to compare lifestyle data before and during the first phase of the COVID-19 pandemic to objectively assess lifestyle changes during quarantine. A total of 464 smartphone users (346 women, 35 ± 12 years old, body mass index [BMI] 23.4 ± 4.5) participated in Period A (January 7 to April 28, 2019) and 622 smartphone users (533 women, 32 ± 11 years old, BMI 23.3 ± 4.0) participated in Period B (January 6 to April 26, 2020). Compared with Period A, there was a sharp decline in physical activity during Period B (4642 ± 3513 vs. 3814 ± 3529 steps/day, p<0.001), especially during the final 9 weeks in both periods (4907 ± 3908 vs. 3528 ± 3397 steps/day, p<0.001); however, there were large variations in physical activity among participants. We found a surprising trend during Period B toward increased happiness among women aged 30-50 years, the group most affected by stay-at-home policies that led to working from home and school closure. Moreover, daily eating duration declined in this population. Additionally, there was a positive association of happiness with steps per day in Period B (&#961; = 0.38, p = 0.02). Despite the many negative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, subjective feelings of happiness among middle-aged Japanese women tended to increase, which indicates that some favorable lifestyle changes that could be adopted during quarantine in the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.","Azuma, Koichiro; Nojiri, Tetsuya; Kawashima, Motoko; Hanai, Akiyoshi; Ayaki, Masahiko; Tsubota, Kazuo",PLoS One,,177

We examined the fungi inhabiting standing leaf litter of Schizachyrium scoparium and Schizachyrium tenerum in a Longleaf Pine savanna ecosystem and estimated their contribution to litter decomposition. We identified fungal phylotypes associated with leaf litter and quantified leaf C mass loss, fungal biomass production, and microbial respiration during decomposition. These data were used to construct budgets estimating C flow into and through fungi. Significant losses in S. scoparium (55%) and S. tenerum (67%) leaf C mass were observed during standing decomposition along with concomitant increases in fungal biomass, which reached a maximum of 36 and 33 mgC/g detrital C, respectively. Cumulative fungal production during decomposition totaled 99 ± 6 mgC/g initial detrital C in S. scoparium and 73 ± 5 mgC/g initial detrital C in S. tenerum, indicating that 18 and 11% of the litter C was converted into fungal biomass, respectively. Corresponding estimates of cumulative fungal respiration totaled 106 ± 7 and 174 ± 11 mgC/g initial detrital C in S. scoparium and S. tenerum, respectively. Next generation sequencing identified several fungal phylotypes, with the majority of sequences belonging to the Ascomycota (Dothideomycetes) and Basidiomycota (Agaricomycetes). Fungal phylotypes were similar between litter species and changed over time, showing a successional pattern. These findings extend our understanding of fungal processes to standing litter in terrestrial ecosystems, and highlight the quantitative importance of fungi in C cycling processes.","Lodato, Matthew B; Boyette, Jerrid S; Smilo, Rachel A; Jackson, Colin R; Halvorson, Halvor M; Kuehn, Kevin A",Oecologia,,177

High Alt Med Biol. 22: 119-127, 2021.-With the increasing availability of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines and the eventual decline in the burden of the disease, it is anticipated that all forms of tourism, including travel to high altitude, will rebound in the near future. Given the physiologic challenges posed by hypobaric hypoxia at high altitude, it is useful to consider whether high-altitude travel will pose risks to those previously infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, particularly those with persistent symptoms after resolution of their infection. Although no studies have specifically examined this question as of yet, available data on the cardiopulmonary sequelae of COVID-19 provide some sense of the problems people may face at high altitude and who warrants evaluation before such endeavors. On average, most individuals who have recovered from COVID-19 have normal or near normal gas exchange, pulmonary function testing, cardiovascular function, and exercise capacity, although a subset of individuals have persistent functional deficits in some or all of these domains when examined up to 5 months after infection. Evaluation is warranted before planned high-altitude travel in individuals with persistent symptoms at least 2 weeks after a positive test or hospital discharge as well as in those who required care in an intensive care unit or suffered from myocarditis or arterial or venous thromboembolism. Depending on the results of this testing, planned high-altitude travel may need to be modified or even deferred pending resolution of the identified abnormalities. As more people travel to high altitude after the pandemic and further studies are conducted, additional data should become available to provide further guidance on these issues.","Luks, Andrew M; Grissom, Colin K",High Alt Med Biol,,177
389854,A Note from the Editorial Team,2020,"A public health worry as is Tuberculosis (TB) has been making more than 10 million people globally suffer from its terror and causing more than 2 million people worldwide to lose their lives every year. Mankind is putting all its efforts, since the discovery of the causative bacilli, to come up with some dramatic improvements in providing high-quality TB diagnostic services. Nevertheless, it poses a challenge and many people with TB remain use only smear microscopy for diagnosis. In an environment where transmission is becoming easier by the day the challenge becomes burdensome once disease gets associated with drug resistance, HIV, other diseases, etc. It becomes of paramount importance to address this biggest public health challenge delivering timely diagnosis using advanced technologies. Initial microscopic examination forms the backbone of TB diagnosis since 100 years along with clinical confirmations. Newer advanced diagnostic tools coming into play are genotypic assays (LPA, CBNAAT, LAMP) that are rapid molecular tests, and culture methods (liquid culture media) with standard drug susceptibility testing assays. Program ideates to correlate these rapid molecular diagnostics with turn-around time (TAT) as low as around 2 hours, with conventional standard methods. These help in reinforcing the diagnostic capacities and also provide identification of drug resistance patterns for few most important first line and second line drugs. The present day developments have brought these tests to near-patient point of care. Culture tests (liquid culture media) are gold standard technique for the analysis of TB with its increased sensitivity and highest quality over all others. An on-going search under TB diagnostics is to find an efficient, reproducible, cost effective tool with minimal infrastructure requirements. This review conveys the advances made over the past decades in the diagnosis of the disease and drug resistance.","Chopra, K K; Singh, Shweta",Indian J Tuberc,,177
390289,Chapter 4 - Food defense—“Back to the basics”,2020,"OBJECTIVES: To study the implementation of a cluster randomised controlled effectiveness-implementation hybrid trial testing the effectiveness of a medication review at hospital discharge combined with a communication stimulus between hospital physicians (HPs) and general practitioners (GPs) on rehospitalisation of multimorbid older patients. DESIGN: Extension of Grant's mixed method process evaluation framework to trials with multilevel clustering. SETTING: General internal medicine wards in Swiss hospitals. PARTICIPANTS: Convenience samples of 15 chief physicians (of 21 hospitals participating in the effectiveness trial), 60 (74) senior HPs, 65 (164) junior HPs and 187 (411) GPs. IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY: Two-hour teaching sessions for senior HPs on a patient-centred, checklist-guided discharge routine. PROCESS EVALUATION COMPONENTS: Data collection on recruitment, delivery and response from chief physicians (semistructured interviews), senior HPs, junior HPs, GPs (surveys) and patients (via HPs). Quantitative data were summarised using descriptive statistics, and interviews analysed using thematic analysis. OUTCOME MEASURES: Intervention dose (quantitative), implementation fidelity (qualitative), feasibility and acceptability, facilitators and barriers, implementation support strategies. RESULTS: Recruitment of hospitals was laborious but successful, with 21 hospitals recruited. Minimal workload and a perceived benefit for the clinic were crucial factors for participation. Intervention dose was high (95% of checklist activities carried out), but intervention fidelity was limited (discharge letters) or unknown (medication review). Recruitment and retention of patients was challenging, partly due to patient characteristics (old, frail) and the COVID-19 pandemic: Only 612 of the anticipated 2100 patients were recruited, and 31% were lost to follow-up within the first month after discharge. The intervention was deemed feasible and helpful by HPs, and the relevance of the topic appreciated by both HPs and GPs. CONCLUSIONS: The results from this evaluation will support interpretation of the findings of the effectiveness study and may inform researchers and policy makers who aim at improving hospital discharge.

Questions exploring the “big five” personality traits, Social Dominance Orientation, Health Literacy, and attitudes to the governmental response to the crisis were included in the survey. The explorative analysis showed that stockpiling was associated with high scores on Extraversion and Neuroticism, and low scores on Conscientiousness and Openness to Experience. Stockpiling was also associated with the view that the government should be doing more to stop the Coronavirus epidemic. An explorative factor analysis of reasons for stockpiling identified the two factors “Panic” and “Action”.","Dammeyer, Jesper",Pers. Individ. Differ.,,177
390570,It will all be over by Christmas,2021,"The absolute positioning accuracy of a robot is an important specification that determines its performance, but it is affected by several error sources. Typical calibration methods only consider kinematic errors and neglect complex non-kinematic errors, thus limiting the absolute positioning accuracy. To further improve the absolute positioning accuracy, we propose an artificial neural network optimized by the differential evolution algorithm. Specifically, the structure and parameters of the network are iteratively updated by differential evolution to improve both accuracy and efficiency. Then, the absolute positioning deviation caused by kinematic and non-kinematic errors is compensated using the trained network. To verify the performance of the proposed network, the simulations and experiments are conducted using a six-degree-of-freedom robot and a laser tracker. The robot average positioning accuracy improved from 0.8497 mm before calibration to 0.0490 mm. The results demonstrate the substantial improvement in the absolute positioning accuracy achieved by the proposed network on an industrial robot.","Jiang, Yizhou; Yu, Liandong; Jia, Huakun; Zhao, Huining; Xia, Haojie",,,177

The availability of the complete gene sequences of the virus helps to know about the origin and molecular characteristics of this virus. In the present study, we performed bioinformatic analysis of the available gene sequence data of SARS-CoV-2 for the understanding of evolution and molecular characteristics and immunogenic resemblance of the circulating viruses. Phylogenetic analysis was performed for four types of representative viral proteins (spike, membrane, envelope and nucleoprotein) of SARS-CoV-2, HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, SARS-CoV, HCoV-NL63, HKU1, MERS-CoV, HKU4, HKU5 and BufCoV-HKU26. The findings demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 exhibited convergent evolutionary relation with previously reported SARS-CoV. It was also depicted that SARS-CoV-2 proteins were highly similar and identical to SARS-CoV proteins, though proteins from other coronaviruses showed a lower level of resemblance. The cross-checked conservancy analysis of SARS-CoV-2 antigenic epitopes showed significant conservancy with antigenic epitopes derived from SARS-CoV. Descriptive epidemiological analysis on several epidemiological indices was performed on available epidemiological outbreak information from several open databases on COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2). Satellite-derived imaging data have been employed to understand the role of temperature in the environmental persistence of the virus.

DATA SOURCES: An electronic search was performed on June 13, 2020 on the Embase, PubMed and Scopus databases using the following search terms: (Coronavirus OR COVID-19 OR COVID19 OR SARS-CoV-2 OR SARS-CoV2 OR SARSCoV2) AND (vertical OR pregnancy OR fetal). SELECTION OF STUDIES: The electronic search resulted in a total of 2,073 records. Titles and abstracts were reviewed by two authors (WPM, IDESB), who checked for duplicates using the pre-established criteria for screening (studies published in English without limitation regarding the date or the status of the publication). DATA COLLECTION: Data extraction was performed in a standardized way, and the final eligibility was assessed by reading the full text of the articles. We retrieved data regarding the delivery of the potential cases of vertical transmission, as well as the main findings and conclusions of systematic reviews. DATA SYNTHESIS: The 2,073 records were reviewed; 1,000 duplicates and 896 clearly not eligible records were excluded. We evaluated the full text of 177 records, and identified only 9 suspected cases of possible vertical transmission. The only case with sufficient evidence of vertical transmission was reported in France. CONCLUSION: The risk of vertical transmission by SARS-CoV-2 is probably very low. Despite several thousands of affected pregnant women, we have identified only one case that has fulfilled sufficient criteria to be confirmed as a case of vertical transmission. Well-designed observational studies evaluating large samples are still necessary to determine the risk of vertical transmission depending on the gestational age at infection.","Barcelos, Ionara Diniz Evangelista Santos; Penna, Ivan Andrade de Araújo; Soligo, Adriana de Góes; Costa, Zelma Bernardes; Martins, Wellington Paula",Rev Bras Ginecol Obstet,,177

We evaluated the role of a combined effort of early hospitalization in combination with early antiviral therapy with COVID-19 patients in a tertiary care university hospital. Materials and Methods This was a prospective, observational, single center study on probable/confirmed COVID-19 patients hospitalized in a tertiary care hospital COVID-19 wards between March 20- April 30, 2020. Critically-ill patients requiring intensive care unit (ICU) at the time of admission were excluded. The demographic, laboratory, and clinical data were collected. Results We included 174 consecutive probable/confirmed COVID-19 adult patients hospitalized in the Internal Medicine wards of the University Adult Hospital between March 20 and April 30, 2020. The median age was 45.5 (19-92) years and 91 patients (52.3% ) were male. 120 (69%) were confirmed microbiologically, 41 (23.5%) radiologically diagnosed and, 13 (7.5%) were clinically suspected (negative microbiological and radiological findings compatible with COVID-19). According to WHO definitions, 35 (20.1%) had mild, 107 (61.5%) moderate disease, and 32 (18.4%) had severe pneumonia. Of 130/171 ( 74.3%) showed pneumonia; 80 were typical, 50 indeterminate infiltration for COVID-19. Patients admitted within a median of 3 days (0-14 days) after symptoms appear. The median duration of hospitalization was 4 days (0 - 28 days). In this case series, 13.2% patients were treated with hydroxychloroquine alone, 64.9% with hydroxychloroquine plus azithromycin, and 18.4% with regimens including favipiravir. A total of 15 patients (8.5%) were transferred to the ICU. Four patients died (2.2%). Conclusion In our series, early of 174 patients admitted to the hospital wards for COVID-19, 69% confirmed with PCR and/or antibody test. On the admission nearly one fifth of the patients had severe diseases. 95.4% of the patients received HQ alone or in combination.

397812,Identification and prediction of time-varying parameters of COVID-19 model: a data-driven deep learning approach,2021,"A novel coronavirus (CoV), the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus - 2 (SARS-CoV-2), results in the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). As information concerning the COVID-19 disease continues to evolve, patients look to their eye care practitioners for accurate eye health guidance. There is currently no evidence to suggest an increased risk of contracting COVID-19 through contact lens (CL) wear compared to spectacle lens wear and no scientific evidence that wearing standard prescription spectacles provides protection against COVID-19 or other viral transmissions. During the pandemic there will potentially be significant changes in access to local eyecare. Thus, it is imperative CL wearers are reminded of the steps they should follow to minimise their risk of complications, to reduce their need to leave isolation and seek care. Management of adverse events should be retained within optometric systems if possible, to minimise the impact on the wider healthcare service, which will be stretched. Optimal CL care behaviours should be the same as those under normal circumstances, which include appropriate hand washing (thoroughly with soap and water) and drying (with paper towels) before both CL application and removal. Daily CL cleaning and correct case care for reusable CL should be followed according to appropriate guidelines, and CL exposure to water must be avoided. Where the availability of local clinical care is restricted, practitioners could consider advising patients to reduce or eliminate sleeping in their CL (where patients have the appropriate knowledge about correct daily care and access to suitable lens-care products) or consider the option of moving patients to daily disposable lenses (where patients have appropriate lens supplies available). Patients should also avoid touching their face, including their eyes, nose and mouth, with unwashed hands and avoid CL wear altogether if unwell (particularly with any cold or flu-like symptoms).","Jones, Lyndon; Walsh, Karen; Willcox, Mark; Morgan, Philip; Nichols, Jason",Cont Lens Anterior Eye,,177

397814,Identification and prediction of time-varying parameters of COVID-19 model: a data-driven deep learning approach,2021-03-17,"OBJECTIVETo assess the effectiveness of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in terms of prevention of disease and transmission. The evaluation was narrowed to two mRNA vaccines and two modified adenovirus vectored vaccines. METHODSA frequentist random effects meta-analysis was carried out after data extraction. Risk of bias of the included studies was assessed using New-Castle-Ottawa Scale. The overall risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by real time Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) was estimated in partially and fully vaccinated individuals. The effect size was expressed as Relative Risk (RR) and RRR (RR reduction) of SARS-CoV-2 infection after vaccination. Potential sources of heterogeneity were investigated through between-study heterogeneity analysis and subgroup meta-analysis. RESULTSThe systematic review identified 27 studies eligible for the quantitative synthesis. Partially vaccinated individuals presented a RRR=73% (95%CI=59%-83%) for any positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR (RR=0.27) and a RRR=79% (95%CI=30%-93%) for symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 PCR (RR=0.21). Fully vaccinated individuals showed a RRR=94% (95%CI=88%-98%) for any SARS-CoV-2 positive PCR (RR=0.06) compared to unvaccinated. According to the subgroup meta-analysis, full BNT162b2 vaccination protocol achieved a RRR=84%-94% against any SARS-CoV-2 positive PCR and a RRR=68%-84% against symptomatic positive PCR. The RR for any SARS-CoV-2 positive PCR remained higher within elderly groups aged [≥]69 years (RR=0.12-0.15) compared to younger individuals (RR=0.05-0.12). The RR against B.1.351 infection approached 0.40 for any positive PCR and 0.36 for symptomatic SARS-COV-2 while the RR of any B.1.1.7 infection was 0.14. CONCLUSIONThe current licensed vaccines may be transmission blocking, especially after full vaccination protocol. Given the substantial heterogeneity, results should be interpreted with caution. Subgroups meta-analyses suggested that the risk of any SARS-CoV-2 infection may be higher for non-B.1.1.7 variants and individuals aged [≥]69 years. Further data and longer follow-up are required to investigate additional sources of heterogeneity and the effectiveness of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination within population subgroups.

397906,Navigating the chaos of an unfolding global cycle,2020,"In the early days of the pandemic, clinical biomarkers for COVID -19 have been investigated to predict patient mortality. A decision tree has been proposed previously comprising three variables, i.e., lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (CRP), and lymphocyte percentage, with more than 90% accuracy in a public cohort. In this work, we highlighted the importance of the cohort made publicly available and complemented the findings by incorporating further evaluation. Results confirmed poor short-term prognosis to abnormal levels of some laboratorial indicators, such as LDH, CRP, lymphocytes, interleukin-6, and procalcitonin. In addition, our findings provide insights into COVID-19 research, such as key levels of fibrin degradation products, which are directly associated with the Dimerized plasmin fragment D and could indicate active coagulation and thrombosis. Still, we highlight here the prognostic value of interleukin-6, a cytokine that induces inflammatory response and may serve as a predictive biomarker.","Ferreira, Jose Raniery; Ribeiro, Victor Henrique Alves; Cossetin, Marcelo; Figueredo, Marcus Vinicius Mazega; Cardoso, Carolina Queiroz; Almeida, Bernardo Montesanti",,,177

This study investigated parents' intention to get vaccinated and to have one's child vaccinated against COVID-19. In May 2020, 612 parents participating with their child in the KUNO-Kids health study completed an online survey. Multivariable logistic regression models were calculated to analyze predictors of intention to vaccinate. Fifty-eight percent of parents intended to get vaccinated against COVID-19, and 51% intended to have their child vaccinated. Significant predictors for the intention to get vaccinated and for having the child vaccinated included stronger parental confidence in one's knowledge about prevention measures and lower beliefs that policy measures were exaggerated.Conclusion: COVID-19 vaccination hesitancy was considerable in our sample of parents in Germany. However, our study revealed some potentially modifiable factors which should be addressed by a comprehensive and tailored communication and education strategy. What is Known? â¢ A COVID-19 vaccine can mitigate the spread of the pandemic. â¢ Many parents are skeptical about vaccinations in general. What is New? â¢ COVID-19 vaccination hesitancy was considerable in our sample of parents from Germany, not only for getting vaccinated but also for having the child vaccinated. â¢ Negative parental attitudes regarding policy measures to contain the pandemic were associated with a lower intention to vaccinate.","Brandstetter, Susanne; Böhmer, Merle M; Pawellek, Maja; Seelbach-Göbel, Birgit; Melter, Michael; Kabesch, Michael; Apfelbacher, Christian",Eur. j. pediatr,,177

Here, an attempt has been made through in-silico high throughput screening to explore the antiviral compounds from traditionally used plants for antiviral treatments in India namely, Tea, Neem and Turmeric, as potential inhibitors of two widely studied viral proteases, main protease (Mpro) and papain-like protease (PLpro) of the SARS-CoV-2. Molecular docking study using BIOVIA Discovery Studio 2018 revealed, (-)-epicatechin-3-O-gallate (ECG), a tea polyphenol has a binding affinity toward both the selected receptors, with the lowest CDocker energy - 46.22 kcal mol-1 for SARS-CoV-2 Mpro and CDocker energy - 44.72 kcal mol-1 for SARS-CoV-2 PLpro, respectively. The SARS-CoV-2 Mpro complexed with (-)-epicatechin-3-O-gallate, which had shown the best binding affinity was subjected to molecular dynamics simulations to validate its binding affinity, during which, the root-mean-square-deviation values of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro-Co-crystal ligand (N3) and SARS-CoV-2 Mpro- (-)-epicatechin-3-O-gallate systems were found to be more stable than SARS-CoV-2 Mpro system. Further, (-)-epicatechin-3-O-gallate was subjected to QSAR analysis which predicted IC50 of 0.3281 nM against SARS-CoV-2 Mpro.

Academic medical centers and the major cardiology organizations responded to a global call to end racism with bold statements and initiatives. Interventional cardiologists utilize advanced equipment to mechanically treat a wide spectrum of heart problems, yet this technology has not been applied in an equitable manner. Interventional therapies are often underutilized in Blacks, exacerbating healthcare disparities and contributing to the excess cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in these communities. Racial bias, whether intentional, unconscious, systemic, or at the individual level, plays a role in these disparities.

399997,Ten work-life balance tips for researchers based at home during the pandemic,2020,"BACKGROUND: Waiters working in different food and drinking establishments have a higher risk of contracting COVID-19 and transmitting the infection to others because they interact with many people. Most COVID-19 related studies in Ethiopia mainly focused on the general population, whereas, this study aimed to assess the knowledge of COVID-19 and preventive behaviors among waiters in Southwest Ethiopia. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted from June 1 to June 15, 2020, among waiters working in food and drinking establishments found in Mizan-Aman, Jemu, and Masha towns in Southwest Ethiopia. A total of 422 waiters were selected using a simple random sampling technique, and the data were collected through face-to-face interviews using a structured questionnaire. The data were entered into Epi-data manager version 4.0.2 and analyzed using SPSS version 22. Multivariable binary logistic regression analysis was carried out to identify predictors of good preventive behaviors at a p-value of less than 0.05. RESULTS: Four hundred and sixteen respondents participated in this study, with a response rate of 98.6%. A significant proportion of participants know the cause, route of transmission, symptoms, and prevention methods of COVID-19 virus. However, very few (21.2%) had good preventive behaviors. The study showed that good preventive behavior was positively associated with female sex (AOR = 2.33, 95% CI: 1.38-3.94), higher schooling (AOR = 0.39, 95% CI: 0.17-0.88), high-risk perception (AOR = 2.26, 95% CI: 1.51-4.32), and high perceived self-efficacy (AOR = 1.1.75, 95% CI: 1.05-2.90). CONCLUSIONS: A significant proportion of waiters know common symptoms of COVID 19, route of transmission, and its prevention methods. However, the preventive behavior was very low. Thus, all concerned bodies working on the prevention and control of COVID-19 should give attention to this population group to enhance compliance with recommended preventive behaviors.","Qanche, Qaro; Asefa, Adane; Nigussie, Tadesse; Hailemariam, Shewangizaw; Duguma, Tadesse",PLoS One,,177

401415,COVID-19: Impacts on Freight Transportation,2020,"COVID-19 patients can present with pulmonary edema early in disease. We propose that this is due to a local vascular problem because of activation of bradykinin 1 receptor (B1R) and B2R on endothelial cells in the lungs. SARS-CoV-2 enters the cell via ACE2 that next to its role in RAAS is needed to inactivate des-Arg9 bradykinin, the potent ligand of the B1R. Without ACE2 acting as a guardian to inactivate the ligands of B1R, the lung environment is prone for local vascular leakage leading to angioedema. Here, we hypothesize that a kinin-dependent local lung angioedema via B1R and eventually B2R is an important feature of COVID-19. We propose that blocking the B2R and inhibiting plasma kallikrein activity might have an ameliorating effect on early disease caused by COVID-19 and might prevent acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). In addition, this pathway might indirectly be responsive to anti-inflammatory agents.","van de Veerdonk, Frank L; Netea, Mihai G; van Deuren, Marcel; van der Meer, Jos Wm; de Mast, Quirijn; Brüggemann, Roger J; van der Hoeven, Hans",eLife (Cambridge),,177

Queensland has only had 1,067 cases as of June 30, 2020, of which 78% have been overseas acquired. Australia and Queensland acted early to address COVID-19 by putting in place a range of strategies including travel bans (international and domestic), isolation measures, testing regimes, advice to business, economic support, and research funding. Agriculture was designated an essential business and as such has continued operating throughout the pandemic. They have however had to develop and implement COVID plans to keep workers safe. To help agricultural business establish plans information was developed by Safe Work Australia, National Farmers Federation and the Queensland Department of Workplace Health and Safety. Workforce issues were identified early, particularly seasonal workers (those who travel from their usual place of residence to another place to work). The Queensland Government enacted a directive about how seasonal workers were to be managed and also developed a guide specifically for horticulture to help manage their COVID-19 response. We provide two case studies demonstrating how agriculture has responded to COVID-19. Agriculture has successfully, in Queensland, adapted quickly to the changing work conditions due to COVID-19. This is due to all levels of government coming together with industry to find solutions.

The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared this outbreak a global health emergency and as on April 24, 2020, it has spread to 213 countries, with 25,91,015 confirmed cases and 742,855 cases have been recovered from COVID-19. In this dreadful situation our team has already published an article in the Science of the Total Environment, which elaborates the various aspects of the SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this situation, it is imperative to understand the possible outcome of COVID-19 recovered patients and determine if they have any other detrimental illnesses by longitudinal analysis to safeguard their life in future. It is necessary to follow-up these recovered patients and performs comprehensive assessments for detection and appropriate management towards their psychological, physical, and social realm. This urges us to suggest that it is highly important to provide counselling, moral support as well as a few recommended guidelines to the recovered patients and society to restore to normalcy. Epidemiological, clinical and immunological studies from COVID-19 recovered patients are particularly important to understand the disease and to prepare better for potential outbreaks in the future. Longitudinal studies on a larger cohort would help us to understand the in-depth prognosis as well as the pathogenesis of COVID-19. Also, follow-up studies will help us provide more information for the development of vaccines and drugs for these kinds of pandemics in the future. Hence, we recommend more studies are required to unravel the possible mechanism of COVID-19 infection and the after-effects of it to understand the characteristics of the virus and to develop the necessary precautionary measures to prevent it.","Balachandar, Vellingiri; Mahalaxmi, Iyer; Subramaniam, Mohandevi; Kaavya, Jayaramayya; Senthil Kumar, Nachimuthu; Laldinmawii, Gracy; Narayanasamy, Arul; Janardhana Kumar Reddy, Patur; Sivaprakash, Palanisamy; Kanchana, Sivaprakash; Vivekanandhan, Govindasamy; Cho, Ssang-Goo",Sci Total Environ,,177

In human cells cytoplasmic DNA is sensed by cyclic GMP-AMP Synthase (cGAS) and Absent In Melanoma 2 (AIM2). Here, we report the identification of a ""natural knockout"" model of cGAS. Comparative genomics of phylogenetically diverse mammalian species showed that cGAS and its interaction partner Stimulator of Interferon Genes (STING) have been inactivated by mutations in the Malayan pangolin whereas other mammals retained intact copies of these genes. The coding sequences of CGAS and STING1 are also disrupted by premature stop codons and frame-shift mutations in Chinese and tree pangolins, suggesting that expression of these genes was lost in a common ancestor of all pangolins that lived more than 20 million years ago. AIM2 is retained in a functional form in pangolins whereas it is inactivated by mutations in carnivorans, the phylogenetic sister group of pangolins. The deficiency of cGAS and STING points to the existence of alternative mechanisms of controlling cytoplasmic DNA-associated cell damage and viral infections in pangolins.","Fischer, Heinz; Tschachler, Erwin; Eckhart, Leopold",Apoptosis,,177

It is unclear whether previous treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) affects the prognosis of COVID-19 patients. The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical implications of previous treatment with ACEI/ARB on the prognosis of patients with COVID-19 infection. METHODS: Single-center, retrospective, observational cohort study based on all the inhabitants of our health area. Analyses of main outcomes (mortality, heart failure, hospitalization, intensive care unit [ICU] admission, and major acute cardiovascular events [a composite of mortality and heart failure]) were adjusted by multivariate logistic regression and propensity score matching models. RESULTS: Of the total population, 447 979 inhabitants, 965 patients (0.22%) were diagnosed with COVID-19 infection, and 210 (21.8%) were under ACEI or ARB treatment at the time of diagnosis. Treatment with ACEI/ARB (combined and individually) had no effect on mortality (OR, 0.62; 95%CI, 0.17-2.26; P=.486), heart failure (OR, 1.37; 95%CI, 0.39-4.77; P=.622), hospitalization rate (OR, 0.85; 95%CI, 0.45-1.64; P=.638), ICU admission (OR, 0.87; 95%CI, 0.30-2.50; P=.798), or major acute cardiovascular events (OR, 1.06; 95%CI, 0.39-2.83; P=.915). This neutral effect remained in a subgroup analysis of patients requiring hospitalization. CONCLUSIONS: Previous treatment with ACEI/ARB in patients with COVID-19 had no effect on mortality, heart failure, requirement for hospitalization, or ICU admission. Withdrawal of ACEI/ARB in patients testing positive for COVID-19 would not be justified, in line with current recommendations of scientific societies and government agencies.","López-Otero, Diego; López-Pais, Javier; Cacho-Antonio, Carla Eugenia; Antúnez-Muiños, Pablo José; González-Ferreiro, Teba; Pérez-Poza, Marta; Otero-García, Óscar; Díaz-Fernández, Brais; Bastos-Fernández, María; Bouzas-Cruz, Noelia; Sanmartín-Pena, Xoan Carlos; Varela-Román, Alfonso; Portela-Romero, Manuel; Valdés-Cuadrado, Luis; Pose-Reino, Antonio; González-Juanatey, José Ramón",Rev. esp. de cardiol.

This article describes the staff management experience of a third level referral hospital in the city of Madrid, Spain, one of the cities and hospitals with the largest number of COVID-19 cases.A newly created COVID-19-specific clinical management unit (CMU) coordinated all clinical departments and conducted real-time assessments of the availability and needs of medical staff, alongside the hospital's general management board. The CMU was able to (i) redeploy up to 285 physicians every week to bolster medical care in COVID-19 wards and forecast medical staff requirements for the upcoming week so all departments could organize their work while coping with COVID-19 needs, (ii) overview all clinical activities conducted in a medicalized hotel, and (iii) recruit a team of roughly 90 volunteer medical students to accelerate data collection and evidence generation.The main advantage of a CMU composed by a member of every job category-its ability to generate rapid, locally adapted responses to unexpected challenges-made it perfect for the unprecedented increase in health-care need generated by the COVID-19 pandemic.","Artiga-Sainz, Laura M; Sarria-Santamera, Antonio; Martínez-Alés, Gonzalo; Quintana-Díaz, Manuel",Disaster Med Public Health Prep,,177

The ongoing outbreak in Wuhan City spread rapidly throughout China, where the fatality rate ranged from 2.1 to 4.9%. Due to its high transmissibility, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a public health emergency of international concern on 30 January 2020. The current outbreak has the potential to become the first pandemic of the new millennium. Most patients who were first diagnosed with COVID-19 worked at or lived in the vicinity of the local Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, where live animals were also on sale. The concerted efforts of Chinese scientists led to the independent isolation from patients and identification of a novel coronavirus, SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), on 6 January 2020; this has been an important step in the development of treatment. The purpose of this article is to overview the history, epidemiology, clinical characteristics, diagnosis, and treatment of COVID 2019 reported in recently published studies.

METHODS: A group of hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia were randomized using 1:1 allocation to either standard treatment lopinavir/ritonavir and interferon beta-1a or bromhexine 8 mg four times a day in addition to standard therapy. The primary outcome was clinical improvement within 28 days, and the secondary outcome measures were time to hospital discharge, all-cause mortality, duration of mechanical ventilation, the temporal trend in 2019-nCoV reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction positivity and the frequency of adverse drug events within 28 days from the start of medication. RESULTS: A total of 111 patients were enrolled in this randomized clinical trial and data from 100 patients (48 patients in the treatment arm and 52 patients in the control arm) were analyzed. There was no significant difference in the primary outcome of this study, which was clinical improvement. There was no significant difference in the average time to hospital discharge between the two arms. There were also no differences observed in the mean intensive care unit stay, frequency of intermittent mandatory ventilation, duration of supplemental oxygenation or risk of death by day 28 noted between the two arms. CONCLUSION: Bromhexine is not an effective treatment for hospitalized patients with COVID-19. The potential prevention benefits of bromhexine in asymptomatic postexposure or with mild infection managed in the community remain to be determined.","Tolouian, Ramin; Mulla, Zuber D; Jamaati, Hamidreza; Babamahmoodi, Abdolreza; Marjani, Majid; Eskandari, Raha; Dastan, Farzaneh",J. invest. med,,177

The standard diagnostic approach that widely adopted in the clinic is nucleic acid detection by real-time RT-PCR. However, the false-negative rate of the technique is unneglectable and serological methods are urgently warranted. Here, we presented the colloidal gold-based immunochromatographic (ICG) strip targeting viral IgM or IgG antibody and compared it with real-time RT-PCR. The sensitivity of ICG assay with IgM and IgG combinatorial detection in nucleic acid confirmed cases were 11.1%, 92.9% and 96.8% at the early stage (1-7 days after onset), intermediate stage (8-14 days after onset), and late stage (more than 15 days), respectively. The ICG detection capacity in nucleic acid-negative suspected cases was 43.6%. In addition, the concordance of whole blood samples and plasma showed Cohen's kappa value of 0.93, which represented the almost perfect agreement between two types of samples. In conclusion, serological ICG strip assay in detecting SARS-CoV-2 infection is both sensitive and consistent, which is considered as an excellent supplementary approach in clinical application.","Pan, Yunbao; Li, Xinran; Yang, Gui; Fan, Junli; Tang, Yueting; Zhao, Jin; Long, Xinghua; Guo, Shuang; Zhao, Ziwu; Liu, Yinjuan; Hu, Hanning; Xue, Han; Li, Yirong",J Infect,,177

409712,CT-Based COVID-19 triage: Deep multitask learning improves joint identification and severity quantification,2021,"BACKGROUND: Abnormal laboratory findings are common in patients infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The aim of this systematic review was to investigate the effect of the level of some laboratory factors (C-reactive protein (CRP), creatinine, leukocyte count, hemoglobin, and platelet count) on the severity and outcome of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). METHODS: We searched PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and Google Scholar. We collected the articles published before May 26, 2020. We gathered the laboratory factors in groups of patients with COVID-19, and studied the relation between level of these factors with severity and outcome of the disease. RESULTS: Mean CRP level, creatinine, hemoglobin, and the leukocytes count in the critically ill patients were significantly higher than those of the other groups (non-critical patients); mean CRP = 54.81 mg/l, mean creatinine = 86.82 µmol/l, mean hemoglobin = 144.05 g/l, and mean leukocyte count = 7.41 × 109. The lymphocyte count was higher in patients with mild/moderate disease (mean: 1.32 × 109) and in the invasive ventilation group (mean value of 0.72 × 109), but it was considerably lower than those of the other two groups. The results showed that the platelet count was higher in critically ill patients (mean value of 205.96 × 109). However, the amount was lower in the invasive ventilation group compared with the other groups (mean level = 185.67 × 109). CONCLUSION: With increasing disease severity, the leukocyte count and the level of CRP increase significantly and the lymphocyte count decreases. There seems to be a significant relation between platelet level, hemoglobin, and creatinine level with severity of the disease. However, more studies are required to confirm this.","Kazemi, Erfan; Soldoozi Nejat, Reihane; Ashkan, Fatemeh; Sheibani, Hossein",Ann Clin Microbiol Antimicrob,,177

The scattering lengths for all six isotopologues are also in excellent agreement with experiment with a 0.2% adjustment within theoretical uncertainty of the leading dispersion coefficient C6. An analysis of the harmonic vibrational constant &#969;e and the constant &#969;exe of the potential of Pashov et al. reveals a significant difference to the present potential which turned out to be due to an oscillatory deviation in their potential in the vicinity of the potential minimum.

Predictors of Willingness for Smartphone Separation and Nomophobia,2020,"INTRODUCTION/AIMS: Cortical hyperexcitability is a feature of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and cortical excitability can be measured using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Resting motor threshold (MT) is a measure of cortical excitability, largely driven by glutamate. Perampanel, a glutamate &#945;-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptor blocker, is predicted to increase the cortical excitability threshold. This study aimed to evaluate TMS to functionally assess target engagement in a study of perampanel in ALS. METHOD: We studied the MT of ALS patients randomized to a single dose of perampanel or placebo 5:1 hourly for 4 h. Twelve patients participated at 4 mg and 7 returned for dosing and retesting at 8 mg. The study was terminated in April 2020 due to coronavirus disease 2019-related restrictions, after 7 out of 12 planned patients had received the 8 mg dose. Serum concentrations were also measured. RESULTS: Ten patients received the 4 mg dose (2 received placebo) and 5 received the 8 mg dose (2 received placebo). Motor Threshold increased at 2 h after dosing in the combined treatment group +7% of maximal stimulator output (P < .01). Change could be detected in the larger 4 mg group (P = .02), but not in the smaller 8 mg dose group (P = .1). No side effects were reported after single dose exposure. DISCUSSION: This study shows that perampanel effects the physiology of upper motor neurons. Studies aiming at gauging the effect of perampanel on ALS disease progression are already ongoing. Motor threshold may serve as a marker of biological target engagement.","Oskarsson, Björn; Mauricio, Elizabeth A; Shah, Jaimin S; Li, Zhuo; Rogawski, Michael A",Muscle nerve,,177

It also aims to investigate the mediating effect of the Omanis' attitudes and behaviors with underlying conditions of COVID-19. Design/methodology/approach - A cross-sectional study was conducted to collect data via an online survey of Omani citizens and residents from various geographic areas in Oman, 305 responses were received. SPSS and partial least square-structural equation modeling were used for data analysis. Findings - The study revealed that public awareness regarding the COVID-19 pandemic was significantly influenced by people's perceived risk, information source and health-related knowledge. Further, preventive behavior during the disease spread has a significant direct and indirect impact on their awareness. However, an insignificant mediation effect of public attitude was found between the source of information and public awareness. Research limitations/implications - This study is limited by the scarcity of related literature in the Omani context. It is recommended that future research complete an in-depth study of public awareness regarding COVID-19, using other constructs and/or other data collection techniques. Practical implications - This research will provide governmental health authorities and policymakers with a guideline to establish more efficient pandemic containment strategies to control public behavior toward the COVID-19 pandemic and curb viral prevalence.

411262,The Role of Green and Blue Hydrogen in the Energy Transition—A Technological and Geopolitical Perspective,2021,"Along with the control and prevention of coronavirus disease 2019 transmission, infected animals might have potential to carry the virus to spark new outbreaks. However, very few studies explore the susceptibility of animals to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Viral attachment as a crucial step for cross-species infection requires angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a receptor and depends on TMPRSS2 protease activity. Here, we searched the genomes of metazoans from different classes using an extensive BLASTP survey and found ACE2 and TMPRSS2 occur in vertebrates, but some vertebrates lack Tmprss2. We identified 6 amino acids among 25 known human ACE2 residues are highly associated with the binding of ACE2 to SARS-CoV-2 (p value < .01) by Fisher exact test, and following this, calculated the probability of viral attachment within each species by the randomForest function from R randomForest library. Furthermore, we observed that Ace2 selected from seven animals based on the above analysis lack the hydrophobic contacts identified on human ACE2, indicating less affinity of SARS-CoV-2 to Ace2 in animals than humans. Finally, the alignment of 3D structure between human ACE2 and other animals by I-TASSER and TM-align displayed a reasonable structure for viral attachment within these species. Taken together, our data may shed light on the human-to-animal transmission of SARS-CoV-2.","Huang, Chen; Jiang, Yu; Yan, Jie",J Med Virol,,177

In this dramatic scenario, all the resources are addressed to the intensive care units for the assessment of the emergency. However, more attention should be paid with respect to the risk of viral diffusion among asymptomatic people. Italy is the second most involved country in the world, and we needed to gain a lot of experience in a very limited time. At least 1 m of distance among people is recommended; however, some clinical practices cannot allow this distance. In this context, we believe that the careful safety assessment of clinical settings, like ophthalmologic ones, may have a remarkable impact on the fight against SARS-CoV-2 spread.","Arrigo, Alessandro; Aragona, Emanuela; Parodi, Maurizio Battaglia; Loperfido, Francesco; Bandello, Francesco",Eur J Ophthalmol,,177

While negative health, economic, and social consequences are being extensively studied, there has been less research on the resilience and post-traumatic growth that people show in the face of adversity. We investigated New Zealanders' experiences of benefit-finding during the COVID-19 pandemic and analysed qualitative responses to a survey examining mental well-being during the New Zealand lockdown. A total of 1175 of 2010 eligible participants responded to an open-ended question probing 'silver linings' (i.e., positive aspects) they may have experienced during this period. We analysed these qualitative responses using a thematic analysis approach. Two thirds of participants identified silver linings from the lockdown and we developed two overarching themes: Surviving (coping well, meeting basic needs, and maintaining health) and thriving (self-development, reflection, and growth). Assessing positive as well as negative consequences of the pandemic provides more nuanced insights into the impact that New Zealand's response had on mental well-being.","Jenkins, Matthew; Hoek, Janet; Jenkin, Gabrielle; Gendall, Philip; Stanley, James; Beaglehole, Ben; Bell, Caroline; Rapsey, Charlene; Every-Palmer, Susanna",PLoS One,,177

412175,"Information: to Harvest, to Have and to Hold",2020-09-07,"Samples of groundwater were collected during a post-monsoon period (January) and a pre-monsoon period (May) in 2020 from 30 locations in the rapidly developing industrial and residential area of the Coimbatore region in southern India. These sampling periods coincided with times before and during the lockdown in industrial activity and reduced agricultural activity that occurred in the region due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This provided a unique opportunity to evaluate the effects of reduced anthropogenic activity on groundwater quality. Approximately 17% of the wells affected by high fluoride concentrations in the post-monsoon period returned to levels suitable for human consumption in samples collected in the pre-monsoon period. This was probably due to ion exchange processes, infiltration of rainwater during the seasonal monsoon that diluted concentrations of ions including geogenic fluoride, as well as a reduction in anthropogenic inputs during the lockdown. The total hazard index for fluoride in the post-monsoon samples calculated for children, adult women, and adult men indicated that 73%, 60%, and 50% of the groundwater samples, respectively, had fluoride levels higher than the permissible limit. In this study, nitrate pollution declined by 33.4% by the pre-monsoon period relative to the post-monsoon period. The chemical facies of groundwater reverted from the Na-HCO3-Cl and Na-Cl to the Ca-HCO3 type in pre-monsoon samples. Various geogenic indicators like molar ratios, inter-ionic relations along with graphical tools demonstrated that plagioclase mineral weathering, carbonate dissolution, reverse ion exchange, and anthropogenic inputs are influencing the groundwater chemistry of this region. These findings were further supported by the saturation index assessed for the post- and pre-monsoon samples. COVID-19 lockdown considerably reduced groundwater pollution by Na+, K+, Cl-, NO3¯, and F- ions due to shutdown of industries and reduced agricultural activities. Further groundwater quality improvement during lockdown period there is evidence that the COVID-19 lockdown by increased HCO3¯ ion concentration. Overall results illustrate the positive benefits to groundwater quality that could occur as a result of measures to control anthropogenic inputs of pollutants.","Karunanidhi, D; Aravinthasamy, P; Deepali, M; Subramani, T; Shankar, K",Arch Environ Contam Toxicol,,177

We performed cell phenotypic, serum and RNA-seq gene expression analyses in severe hospitalized patients (n = 61). Relative to healthy donors, results showed abnormalities of 27 cell populations and an elevation of 42 cytokines, neutrophil chemo-attractants, and inflammatory components in patients. Supervised and unsupervised analyses revealed a high abundance of CD177, a specific neutrophil activation marker, contributing to the clustering of severe patients. Gene abundance correlated with high serum levels of CD177 in severe patients. Higher levels were confirmed in a second cohort and in ICU than non-ICU patients (P< 0.001). Longitudinal measurements discriminated between patients with the worst prognosis, leading to death, and those who recovered (P = 0.01). These results highlight neutrophil activation as a hallmark of severe disease and CD177 assessment as a reliable prognostic marker for routine care.","Lévy, Yves; Wiedemann, Aurélie; Hejblum, Boris P; Durand, Mélany; Lefebvre, Cécile; Surénaud, Mathieu; Lacabaratz, Christine; Perreau, Matthieu; Foucat, Emile; Déchenaud, Marie; Tisserand, Pascaline; Blengio, Fabiola; Hivert, Benjamin; Gauthier, Marine; Cervantes-Gonzalez, Minerva; Bachelet, Delphine; Laouénan, Cédric; Bouadma, Lila; Timsit, Jean-François; Yazdanpanah, Yazdan; Pantaleo, Giuseppe; Hocini, Hakim; Thiébaut, Rodolphe",iScience,,177

413159,Science communication for the Deaf in the pandemic period: absences and pursuit of information,2020,"This paper uses disputes over islands in the early twentieth-century Yalu River to examine how river environments critically shape border conflicts. Processes of riparian erosion and sedimentation along this historical border between China and Korea, accelerated by upstream deforestation, helped transform submerged sandbanks into islands known as Hwangch'op'yong. After Japan's occupation of Korea in 1905, these islands in the lower Yalu delta-and the valuable reeds that grew on their marshy surface-became an unlikely battleground between Chinese and Korean reed harvesters, Japanese ""continental adventurers,"" and competing Japanese and Chinese empires. With the contemporary Sino-North Korean border still a geopolitical hotspot, it is imperative to understand the historical as well as ecological forces that shaped the contested geography of the Yalu River boundary. Such an understanding, this article argues, shows how both Japanese imperial violence and riparian sedimentation contributed to Hwangch'op'yong's battleground status and its transformation, by the end of the twentieth century, into a Korean exclave on the Chinese bank of the Yalu River.","Seeley, J.

They are considered toxic to mammals, since they have carcinogenic, mutagenic, and genotoxic properties, among others. Although mycoremediation is an efficient, economical, and eco-friendly technique for degrading PAHs, the fungal degradation potential of the phylum Ascomycota has not been widely studied. In this work, we evaluated different fungal strains from the polluted soil of ""La Escondida"" lagoon in Reynosa, Mexico to know their potential to degrade phenanthrene (PHE). Forty-three soil isolates with the capacity to grow in the presence of PHE (0.1 % w/v) were obtained. The fungi Aspergillus oryzae MF13 and Aspergillus flavipes QCS12 had the best potential to degrade PHE. Both fungi germinated and grew at PHE concentrations of up to 5000 mg L-1 and degraded 235 mg L-1 of PHE in 28 d, with and without an additional carbon source. These characteristics indicate that A. oryzae MF13 and A. flavipes QCS12 could be promising organisms for the remediation of sites contaminated with PAHs and detoxification of recalcitrant xenobiotics.","de la Cruz-Izquierdo, Rosa I; Paz-González, Alma D; Reyes-Espinosa, Francisco; Vazquez-Jimenez, Lenci K; Salinas-Sandoval, Martha; González-Domínguez, Martha I; Rivera, Gildardo",Lett. appl. microbiol,,177

414218,Modelling carbon mitigation pathways by 2050: Insights from the Global Calculator,2020,"Background: Quantitative RT-PCR (RT-qPCR) of nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) samples for SARS-CoV-2 detection requires medical personnel and is time consuming, and thus is poorly suited to mass screening. In June, 2020, a chemiluminescent enzyme immunoassay (CLEIA; Lumipulse G SARS-CoV-2 Ag kit, Fujirebio, Tokyo, Japan) was developed that can detect SARS-CoV-2 nucleoproteins in NPS or saliva samples within 35 min. In this study, we assessed the utility of CLEIA in mass SARS-CoV-2 screening. Methods: We did a diagnostic accuracy study to develop a mass-screening strategy for salivary detection of SARS-CoV-2 by CLEIA, enrolling hospitalised patients with clinically confirmed COVID-19, close contacts identified at community health centres, and asymptomatic international arrivals at two airports, all based in Japan. All test participants were enrolled consecutively. We assessed the diagnostic accuracy of CLEIA compared with RT-qPCR, estimated according to concordance (Kendall's coefficient of concordance, W), and sensitivity (probability of CLEIA positivity given RT-qPCR positivity) and specificity (probability of CLEIA negativity given RT-qPCR negativity) for different antigen concentration cutoffs (0·19 pg/mL, 0·67 pg/mL, and 4·00 pg/mL; with samples considered positive if the antigen concentration was equal to or more than the cutoff and negative if it was less than the cutoff). We also assessed a two-step testing strategy post hoc with CLEIA as an initial test, using separate antigen cutoff values for test negativity and positivity from the predefined cutoff values. The proportion of intermediate results requiring secondary RT-qPCR was then quantified assuming prevalence values of RT-qPCR positivity in the overall tested population of 10%, 30%, and 50%. Findings: Self-collected saliva was obtained from 2056 participants between June 12 and Aug 6, 2020. Results of CLEIA and RT-qPCR were concordant in 2020 (98·2%) samples (Kendall's W=0·99). Test sensitivity was 85·4% (76 of 89 positive samples; 90% credible interval [CrI] 78·0-90·3) at the cutoff of 0·19 pg/mL; 76·4% (68 of 89; 68·2-82·8) at the cutoff of 0·67 pg/mL; and 52·8% (47 of 89; 44·1-61·3) at the cutoff of 4·0 pg/mL. Test specificity was 91·3% (1796 of 1967 negative samples; 90% CrI 90·2-92·3) at the cutoff of 0·19 pg/mL, 99·2% (1952 of 1967; 98·8-99·5) at the cutoff of 0·67 pg/mL, and 100·0% (1967 of 1967; 99·8-100·0) at the cutoff of 4·00 pg/mL. Using a two-step testing strategy with a CLEIA negativity cutoff of 0·19 pg/mL (to maximise sensitivity) and a CLEIA positivity cutoff of 4·00 pg/mL (to maximise specificity), the proportions of indeterminate results (ie, samples requiring secondary RT-qPCR) would be approximately 11% assuming a prevalence of RT-qPCR positivity of 10%, 16% assuming a prevalence of RT-qPCR positivity of 30%, and 21% assuming a prevalence of RT-qPCR positivity of 50%. Interpretation: CLEIA testing of self-collected saliva is simple and provides results quickly, and is thus suitable for mass testing. To improve accuracy, we propose a two-step screening strategy with an initial CLEIA test followed by confirmatory RT-qPCR for intermediate concentrations, varying positive and negative thresholds depending on local prevalence. Implementation of this strategy has expedited sample processing at Japanese airports since July, 2020, and might apply to other large-scale mass screening initiatives.

Scientific evaluations are necessary to ascertain the medicinal potential of ZA as a source of new drug molecules. This study investigated the possible therapeutic benefit of ZA leaf (ZAL) and root bark (ZARB) extracts in an experimental model of multi-organ injuries induced by phenylhydrazine (PHZ). Methods Hyperbilirubinaemia, hepatotoxicity, nephrotoxicity and splenic injuries were induced by pretreating albino rats with PHZ (40 mg/kg, p.o.) for two alternate days. Afterward, six out of the eight groups of rats (n = 5) used were treated with either ZAL or ZARB (30, 100 and 300 mg/kg/day, p.o.) for seven days. Naïve control rats received saline without PHZ whereas negative control group received saline after PHZ. After one week of treatment, rats were sacrificed and blood collected for assessment of haematological and biochemical parameters. Liver, kidney and spleen sections were processed for histology and examined under light microscope. Results Data indicate that PHZ significantly (p < 0.05) increased total bilirubin, serum alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine and BUN/creatinine ratio whereas red blood cell count was significantly reduced. These anomalies were significantly reversed in rats treated with ZAL or ZARB. The therapeutic effect of the extracts was supported by photomicrographs of the liver, kidney, and spleen of rats which revealed recovery from PHZ-mediated pyknosis, glomerular degeneration and multiple splenic necrosis respectively. Conclusions Overall, data from this study suggest that ZA may be useful in multiple organ injuries associated with PHZ-like xenobiotic toxicity.","Henneh, Isaac T; Owusu Agyei, Phyllis E; Obese, Ernest; Biney, Robert P; Antwi-Adjei, Meshack; Yahaya, Ewura S; Asiamah, Ernest; Acquah-Mills, Joseph; Boateng, Douglas O; Ekor, Martins",J. basic clin. physiol. pharmacol,,177

Here, we investigated the diagnostic performance of chest computed tomography (CT) as an alternative to RT-PCR in patients with clinical suspicion of COVID-19 infection. METHODS: In this descriptive cross-sectional study, 27,824 patients with clinical suspicion of COVID-19 infection who underwent unenhanced low-dose chest CT from 20 February, 2020 to 21 May, 2020 were evaluated. Patients were recruited from seven specifically designated hospitals for patients with COVID-19 infection affiliated to Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences. In each hospital, images were interpreted by two independent radiologists. CT findings were considered as positive/negative for COVID-19 infection based on RSNA diagnostic criteria. Then, the correlation between the number of daily positive chest CT scans and number of daily PCR-confirmed cases and COVID-19-related deaths in Tehran province during this three-month period was assessed. The trends of admission rate and patients with positive CT scans were also evaluated. RESULTS: A strong positive correlation between the numbers of daily positive CT scans and daily PCR-confirmed COVID-19 cases (râ¯=â¯0.913, p < 0.001) was observed. Furthermore, in hospitals located in regions with a lower socioeconomic status, the admission rate and number of positive cases within this three-month period was higher as compared to other hospitals. CONCLUSION: Low-dose chest CT is a safe, rapid and reliable alternative to RT-PCR for the diagnosis of COVID-19 in high-prevalence regions. In addition, our study provides further evidence for considering patients' socioeconomic status as an important risk factor for COVID-19.","Zali, Alireza; Sohrabi, Mohammad-Reza; Mahdavi, Ali; Khalili, Nastaran; Taheri, Morteza Sanei; Maher, Ali; Sadoughi, Mohammadmehdi; Zarghi, Afshin; Ziai, Seyed Ali; Shabestari, Abbas Arjmand; Bakhshayeshkaram, Mehrdad; Haghighatkhah, Hamidreza; Salevatipour, Babak; Abrishami, Alireza; Raoufi, Masoomeh; Dehghan, Pooneh; Bagheri, Arash Khameneh; Khoshnoud, Reza Jalili; Hanani, Khatereh",Acad. radiol,,177

418781,Introducing the Zoom interview: tips for job hunting during the coronavirus pandemic,2020,"Students with disabilities have been going through different forms of discrimination and exclusion. These include inaccessible learning materials and learning platforms, negative attitudes from lecturers, fellow students and more. This paper comes from a qualitative study that sought to explore how Covid-19 deepened these educational inequalities at an Open Distance Learning institution in South Africa. The results of the study reveal that institutions of higher learning had to quickly adjust their teaching and assessment to online mode. This led to heightened exclusion of students with disabilities as their examinations had to be postponed to second semester due to lack of preparations for special examinations. Students also reported experiencing extra pressure as they had to write double the examinations at the end of the year. Some students reported lack of access to assistive technologies which they normally borrow from the library, this was because the Post Office was not operating during the National Lockdown Level 5. The novel nature of Covid-19 is such that the real barriers it caused on people and students with disabilities in particular and it will keep revealing itself gradually. This paper ends by making recommendations on how an ODL institution could accommodate the needs of students with disabilities to enhance their learning experiences during pandemics or natural disasters. © 2021.

419805,Global trends in library web-archives,2021,"The chronic dysfunction of neuronal cells, both central and peripheral, a characteristic of neurological disorders, may be caused by irreversible damage and cell death. In 2016, more than 276 million cases of neurological disorders were reported worldwide. Moreover, neurological disorders are the second leading cause of death. Generally, the etiology of neurological diseases is not fully understood. Recent studies have related the onset of neurological disorders to viral infections, which may cause neurological symptoms or lead to immune responses that trigger these pathological signs. Currently, this relationship is mostly based on epidemiological data on infections and seroprevalence of patients who present with neurological disorders. The number of studies aiming to elucidate the mechanism of action by which viral infections may directly or indirectly contribute to the development of neurological disorders has been increasing over the years but these studies are still scarce. Comprehending the pathogenesis of these diseases and exploring novel theories may favor the development of new strategies for diagnosis and therapy in the future. Therefore, the objective of the present study was to review the main pieces of evidence for the relationship between viral infection and neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Guillain-Barré syndrome, multiple sclerosis, and epilepsy. Viruses belonging to the families Herpesviridae, Orthomyxoviridae, Flaviviridae, and Retroviridae have been reported to be involved in one or more of these conditions. Also, neurological symptoms and the future impact of infection with SARS-CoV-2, a member of the family Coronaviridae that is responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic that started in late 2019, are reported and discussed.","Wouk, Jéssica; Rechenchoski, Daniele Zendrini; Rodrigues, Bianca Cerqueira Dias; Ribelato, Elisa Vicente; Faccin-Galhardi, Ligia Carla",Arch Virol,,177
420215,A laboratory course on information display technologies for remote learning,2021,"While the role of children in the chain of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 remains to be fully defined, they likely play an important role based on our knowledge of other respiratory viruses. Children are more likely to be asymptomatic or have milder symptoms and less likely to present for healthcare and be tested for SARS-CoV-2; thus, our current estimates are likely under-representative of the true burden of SARS-CoV-2 in children. Given the potential direct benefit of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine in children and the substantial indirect benefit through community protection or 'herd immunity', we argue that planning and implementation of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines should include children. Furthermore, community protection occurred after widespread implementation of prior childhood vaccines against Streptococcus pneumoniae, rubella and rotavirus. We detail considerations for vaccine clinical trials, potential barriers to the implementation of widespread vaccination and argue why children would be an ideal target population for vaccination.","Kao, Carol M; Orenstein, Walter A; Anderson, Evan J",Clin. infect. dis,,177

These models remain challenging to optimize and often require a""human-in-the-loop""approach where domain experts use their knowledge to steer and adjust. However, the fragility, incompleteness, and opacity of these models means even minor changes could induce large and potentially undesirable changes in resulting model. In this paper we conduct a simulation-based analysis of human-centered interactions with topic models, with the objective of measuring the sensitivity of topic models to common classes of user actions. We find that user interactions have impacts that differ in magnitude but often negatively affect the quality of the resulting modelling in a way that can be difficult for the user to evaluate. We suggest the incorporation of sensitivity and""multiverse""analyses to topic model interfaces to surface and overcome these deficiencies.","Crisan, Anamaria; Correll, Michael",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.02244v1.pdf,177

421053,Meaningful Big Data Integration for a Global COVID-19 Strategy,2020,"BACKGROUND: There is a need for more observational studies across different clinical settings to better understand the epidemiology of the novel COVID-19 infection. Evidence on clinical characteristics of COVID-19 infection is scarce in secondary care settings in Western populations. METHODS: We describe the clinical characteristics of all consecutive COVID-19 positive patients (n = 215) admitted to the acute medical unit at Fairfield General Hospital (secondary care setting) between 23 March 2020 and 30 April 2020 based on the outcome at discharge (group 1: alive or group 2: deceased). We investigated the risk factors that were associated with mortality using binary logistic regression analysis. Kaplan-Meir (KM) curves were generated by following the outcome in all patients until 12 May 2020. RESULTS: The median age of our cohort was 74 years with a predominance of Caucasians (87.4%) and males (62%). Of the 215 patients, 86 (40%) died. A higher proportion of patients who died were frail (group 2: 63 vs group 1: 37%, p < 0.001), with a higher prevalence of cardiovascular disease (group 2: 58 vs group 1: 33%, p < 0.001) and respiratory diseases (group 2: 38 vs group 1: 25%, p = 0.03). In the multivariate logistic regression models, older age (odds ratio (OR) 1.03; p = 0.03), frailty (OR 5.1; p < 0.001) and lower estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) on admission (OR 0.98; p = 0.01) were significant predictors of inpatient mortality. KM curves showed a significantly shorter survival time in the frail older patients. CONCLUSION: Older age and frailty are chief risk factors associated with mortality in COVID-19 patients hospitalised to an acute medical unit at secondary care level. A holistic approach by incorporating these factors is warranted in the management of patients with COVID-19 infection.","Chinnadurai, Rajkumar; Ogedengbe, Onesi; Agarwal, Priya; Money-Coomes, Sally; Abdurrahman, Ahmad Z; Mohammed, Sajeel; Kalra, Philip A; Rothwell, Nicola; Pradhan, Sweta",BMC Geriatr,,177

421891,Fake news classification with BERT,2020,"Coronaviruses are adept at evading host antiviral pathways induced by viral double-stranded RNA, including interferon (IFN) signaling, oligoadenylate synthetase-ribonuclease L (OAS-RNase L), and protein kinase R (PKR). While dysregulated or inadequate IFN responses have been associated with severe coronavirus infection, the extent to which the recently emerged SARS-CoV-2 activates or antagonizes these pathways is relatively unknown. We found that SARS-CoV-2 infects patient-derived nasal epithelial cells, present at the initial site of infection; induced pluripotent stem cell-derived alveolar type 2 cells (iAT2), the major cell type infected in the lung; and cardiomyocytes (iCM), consistent with cardiovascular consequences of COVID-19 disease. Robust activation of IFN or OAS-RNase L is not observed in these cell types, whereas PKR activation is evident in iAT2 and iCM. In SARS-CoV-2-infected Calu-3 and A549ACE2 lung-derived cell lines, IFN induction remains relatively weak; however, activation of OAS-RNase L and PKR is observed. This is in contrast to Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV, which effectively inhibits IFN signaling and OAS-RNase L and PKR pathways, but is similar to mutant MERS-CoV lacking innate immune antagonists. Remarkably, OAS-RNase L and PKR are activated in MAVS knockout A549ACE2 cells, demonstrating that SARS-CoV-2 can induce these host antiviral pathways despite minimal IFN production. Moreover, increased replication and cytopathic effect in RNASEL knockout A549ACE2 cells implicates OAS-RNase L in restricting SARS-CoV-2. Finally, while SARS-CoV-2 fails to antagonize these host defense pathways, which contrasts with other coronaviruses, the IFN signaling response is generally weak. These host-virus interactions may contribute to the unique pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2.","Li, Yize; Renner, David M; Comar, Courtney E; Whelan, Jillian N; Reyes, Hanako M; Cardenas-Diaz, Fabian Leonardo; Truitt, Rachel; Tan, Li Hui; Dong, Beihua; Alysandratos, Konstantinos Dionysios; Huang, Jessie; Palmer, James N; Adappa, Nithin D; Kohanski, Michael A; Kotton, Darrell N; Silverman, Robert H; Yang, Wenli; Morrisey, Edward E; Cohen, Noam A; Weiss, Susan R",Proc.

422470,Company,2020,"OBJECTIVE: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a major challenge facing the world. Certain guidelines issued by National Health Commission of the People's Repubilic of China recommend intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) for adjuvant treatment of COVID-19. However, there is a lack of clinical evidence to support the use of IVIG. METHODS: This single-center retrospective cohort study included all adult patients with laboratory-confirmed severe COVID-19 in the Respiratory and Critical Care Unit of Dabie Mountain Regional Medical Center, China. Patient information, including demographic data, laboratory indicators, the use of glucocorticoids and IVIG, hospital mortality, the application of mechanical ventilation, and the length of hospital stay was collected. The primary outcome was the composite end point, including death and the use of mechanical ventilation. The secondary outcome was the length of hospital stay. RESULTS: Of the 285 patients with confirmed COVID-19, 113 severely ill patients were included in this study. Compared to the non-IVIG group, more patients in the IVIG group reached the composite end point [12 (25.5%) vs 5 (7.6%), P = 0.008] and had longer hospital stay periods [23.0 (19.0-31.0) vs 16.0 (13.8-22.0), P < 0.001]. After adjusting for confounding factors, differences in primary outcomes between the two groups were not statistically significant (P = 0.167), however, patients in the IVIG group had longer hospital stay periods (P = 0.041). CONCLUSION: Adjuvant therapy with IVIG did not improve in-hospital mortality rates or the need for mechanical ventilation in severe COVID-19 patients. Our study does not support the use of immunoglobulin in patients with severe COVID-19 patients.","Hou, Xiao; Tian, Li; Zhou, Lei; Jia, Xinhua; Kong, Li; Xue, Yitao; Hao, Hao; Meng, Xianqing; Zhang, Feihu; Dong, Xiaobin",Virol J,,177

The effectiveness of this protective measure depends on the specifics of individual use. The purpose of our study was to analyze the use of respiratory protective equipment (RPE) by medical students during the COVID-19 pandemic. The evaluation of face mask use was based on the results of a survey of medical students at Sechenov University. There were 988 participants in the study: 97.5% used RPE during the pandemic, 89.1% used disposable medical and hygienic face masks, 27.4% used reusable cloth face masks, and 13.2% used respirators. The majority of respondents (75.2%) were found to wear face masks correctly. However, 17.0% of the respondents were found to cover only their mouths with a face mask, while 7.8% reported often shifting their face mask under the chin due to perceived discomfort. Only 25.1% of respondents changed their disposable face mask after 2-3 h of wearing, while 13.0% decontaminated and used it several times. Most cloth face mask users (93.7%) decontaminated their marks, but only 55.7% of respondents did so daily. Face masks were most often worn in medical organizations (91.5%), and 1.4% of respondents did not use respiratory protection anywhere. In conclusion, we consider it necessary to introduce a special module on nonspecific prevention in the discipline of hygiene.","Shashina, Ekaterina A; Makarova, Valentina V; Shcherbakov, Denis V; Isiutina-Fedotkova, Tatiana S; Zabroda, Nadezhda N; Ermakova, Nina A; Skopin, Anton Y; Mitrokhin, Oleg V",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,177

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ultra-high-resolution (UHR) CT images of 87 patients (50 males, 37 females; median age, 63 years) with COVID-19 confirmed using real-time polymerase chain reaction were analyzed. The maximum subsegmental vascular diameter was measured on CT. Total CT lung volume (CTLV total) and lesion extent (ratio of lesion volume to CTLV total) of ground-glass opacities, reticulation, and consolidation were measured using software. Maximum pulmonary vascular diameter and lesion extent were analyzed using Spearman's correlation analysis. Logistic regression analysis was performed on CT results to predict disease severity. We also assessed changes in these measures on follow-up scans in 16 patients. RESULTS: All 23 patients with severe and critical illness had vascular enlargement (> 4 mm). Pulmonary vascular enlargement (odds ratio 3.05, p = 0.018) and CT lesion extent (odds ratio 1.07, p = 0.002) were independent predictors of disease severity after adjustment for age and comorbidities. On follow-up CT, vascular diameter and CT lesion volume decreased (p = 0.001, p = 0.002; respectively), but CTLV total did not change significantly. CONCLUSION: Subsegmental vascular enlargement is a notable finding to predict acute COVID-19 disease severity.","Aoki, Ryo; Iwasawa, Tae; Hagiwara, Eri; Komatsu, Shigeru; Utsunomiya, Daisuke; Ogura, Takashi",Jpn. j. radiol.

The World Health Organization recommends the Charité-Berlin protocol for COVID-19 diagnosis, which requires triple PCR, limiting the process capability of laboratories and delaying the results. In order to reduce these limitations, a duplex PCR is validated for the detection of the E and RNase P genes. METHODS: We compared the limit of detection, sensitivity and specificity of the duplex PCR technique (E gene and RNase P) against the monoplex standard (E gene) in RNA samples from a SARS-CoV-2 isolate and 88 clinical specimens with previously known results. The repeatability and reproducibility of the threshold cycle values (Ct) were determined in two independent laboratories of the Faculty of Medicine of the Universidad de Antioquia, using different reagents and real time instruments. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in the Ct results between both techniques (p = 0.84). Using the monoplex PCR of E gene as a reference, the interrater reliability analysis showed similarity between the two techniques, with a kappa coefficient of 0.89, the sensitivity and the specificity of duplex PCR were 90% and 87%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Duplex PCR does not affect the sensitivity and specificity reported by the Charité, Berlin protocol, being a useful tool for SARS-CoV-2 screening in clinical samples.","Palacio Rua, Katherine; García Correa, Juan Felipe; Aguilar-Jiménez, Wbeimar; Afanador Ayala, Carlos; Rugeles, María Teresa; Zuluaga, Andrés F",Enferm. infecc. microbiol. clin.

SARS-CoV-2 now adds to the list of coronavirus diseases that have threatened global health, along with the SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome) coronaviruses that emerged in 2002/2003 and 2012, respectively. As of April 2020, no vaccine is commercially available for these coronavirus strains. Nevertheless, the knowledge obtained from the vaccine development efforts for MERS and SARS can be of high value for COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019). Here, we review the past and ongoing vaccine development efforts for clinically relevant coronavirus strains with the intention that this information helps in the development of effective and safe vaccines for COVID-19. In addition, information from naturally exposed individuals and animal models to coronavirus strains is described for the same purpose of helping into the development of effective vaccines against COVID-19.","Padron-Regalado, Eriko",Infect Dis Ther,,177

The Role of the Urban Data Trust in Sidewalk Toronto,2020,"The COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 and variants has led to significant mortality. We recently reported that an RNA-targeting CRISPR-Cas13 system, termed prophylactic antiviral CRISPR in human (PAC-MAN), offered an antiviral strategy against SARS-CoV-2 and influenza A virus. Here, we expand in silico analysis to use PAC-MAN to target a broad spectrum of human- or livestock-infectious RNA viruses with high specificity, coverage, and predicted efficiency. Our analysis reveals that a minimal set of 14 crRNAs is able to target >90% of human-infectious viruses across 10 RNA virus families. We predict that a set of 5 experimentally validated crRNAs can target new SARS-CoV-2 variant sequences with zero mismatches. We also build an online resource (crispr-pacman.stanford.edu) to support community use of CRISPR-Cas13 for broad-spectrum RNA virus targeting. Our work provides a new bioinformatic resource for using CRISPR-Cas13 to target diverse RNA viruses in order to facilitate development of CRISPR-based antivirals.","Lin, Xueqiu; Liu, Yanxia; Chemparathy, Augustine; Pande, Tara; La Russa, Marie; Qi, Lei Stanley",Cell Rep Med,,177

Recently we could demonstrate that ion mobility spectrometry coupled with a multicapillary column (MCC-IMS) is able to identify Influenza-A infections in patients' breath. With decreasing Influenza epidemic and upcoming SARS-CoV-2 infections we proceeded further and analysed patients with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infections. In this study, nasal breath of 75 patients (34m, 41f, aged 64.4 ± 15.4 years) was investgated by MCC-IMS for viral infections. 14 were positively diagnosed for Influenza-A infection and 16 for SARS-CoV-2 by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of nasopharyngeal swabs. In one patient RT-PCR was highly suspicious of SARS-CoV-2 but initially inconclusive. The remaining 44 patients served as controls. Breath fingerprints for specific infections were assessed by a combination of cluster analysis and multivariate statistics. There was no significant difference in gender or age according to the groups. In the cross validation of the discriminant analysis 72 of the 74 patients could be correctly classified to the respective group. Even the inconclusive patient could be mapped to the SARS-CoV-2 group applying the discrimination functions. Conclusion: MCC-IMS is able to detect SARS-CoV-2 infection and Influenza-A infection in breath in this pilot study. As this method provides a fast non-invasive diagnosis it should be further developed in a larger cohort for screening of communicable viral diseases.","Steppert, Claus; Steppert, Isabel; Sterlacci, William; Bollinger, Thomas",Journal of breath research (Online),,177

OBJECTIVES: The purposes of this study were to assess hospital cancer registrars' perceptions of (1) the use of and quality of hospital cancer registry data for care coordination and other purposes;(2) the availability of all needed data for complete hospital cancer registry data collection;and (3) the data collection of COVID-19 effects on cancer patients. METHODS: A survey was sent to hospital-based members of Cancer Registrars of Illinois between April and June 2020. Survey questions focused on current use and quality of hospital cancer registry data for care coordination as well as items related to COVID-19's effect on cancer patients. The focus of this study was hospital-based registrars, as they are the individuals collecting data directly from primary patient records. RESULTS: While hospital cancer registry data are being used for many purposes including continuity of care, this study found that providers are not using hospital cancer registry data to its fullest extent. It was also found that hospital cancer registrars have collected valuable data on the impact that COVID-19 has had on cancer patients. CONCLUSION: Care coordination between providers is especially important for cancer patients who may see multiple providers and visit several facilities. This study found that the hospital cancer registry database contains extremely useful data for cancer patients and practitioners. Further, it was found that the hospital cancer registry is a source of valuable information regarding the impact that COVID-19 has had on cancer patients.","Peterson, J.; Houser, S. H.; Flite, C.

This effect is measured in the current study. METHODS: In a cross-sectional study in Iran, 320 randomly selected treated patients from COVID-19 were studied. To collect the required data, we applied a questionnaire that included socio-demographic factors, clinical characteristics, and questions on the patients' HRQoL. Time trade-off (TTO) approach was used to measure the lost HRQoL attributed to COVID-19. Besides, we applied a two-limit Tobit regression model to determine the effects of the socio-demographic factors on patients' health utility and the visual analogue scale approach was used to estimate the perceived total current health status. RESULTS: The overall mean (SE) and median (IQR) of the health utility values were 0.863 (0.01) and 0.909 (0.21) respectively. These values for the traders (those who were willing to lose a part of their remaining time of life to avoid the disease) were estimated at 0.793 (0.01) and 0.848 (0.17), respectively. The lowest amount of utility value belonged to the elderly (mean (SE) = 0.742 (0.04); median (IQR) = 0.765 (0.42)) and those living in rural areas (mean (SE)) = 0.804 (0.03); median (IQR) = 0.877 (0.30)). The univariate analysis showed that age, place of residence, and household size had a statistically significant effect on health utility. Moreover, findings of the regression analysis indicated that the participants' age and hospitalization status were the key determinants of COVID-19 health utility value. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 is associated with a substantial and measurable decrease in HRQoL. This decline in HRQoL can be directly compared with that induced by systemic health states.","Alinia, Cyrus; Yaghmaei, Safura; Abdullah, Farman Zahir; Ahmadi, Asad; Samadi, Nasrin; Pourteymour, Sima; Safari, Hossein; Mahmoudi, Hassan; Moradi, Ghobad; Piroozi, Bakhtiar",BMC Infect Dis,,177

This study describes the creation of a remote COVID-19 rehabilitation assessment tool to allow timely triage, assessment and management. It hypotheses those with post-COVID-19 syndrome, potentially without laboratory confirmation and irrespective of initial disease severity, will have significant rehabilitation needs. METHODS: Cross-sectional study of consecutive patients referred by general practitioners (April-November 2020). Primary outcomes were presence/absence of anticipated sequelae. Binary logistic regression was used to test association between acute presentation and post-COVID-19 symptomatology. RESULTS: 155 patients (n=127 men, n=28 women, median age 39 years, median 13 weeks post-illness) were assessed using the tool. Acute symptoms were most commonly shortness of breath (SOB) (74.2%), fever (73.5%), fatigue (70.3%) and cough (64.5%); and post-acutely, SOB (76.7%), fatigue (70.3%), cough (57.4%) and anxiety/mood disturbance (39.4%). Individuals with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 were 69% and 63% less likely to have anxiety/mood disturbance and pain, respectively, at 3 months. CONCLUSIONS: Rehabilitation assessment should be offered to all patients suffering post-COVID-19 symptoms, not only those with laboratory confirmation and considered independently from acute illness severity. This tool offers a structure for a remote assessment.

Efforts minimizing risk to improve quality of life and aging have proven moderately successful, but acute shocks and chronic stressors to an individual's systemic physical and cognitive functions may accelerate their inevitable degradations. A framework for resilience to the challenges associated with aging is required to complement on-going risk reduction policies, programs and interventions. Studies measuring resilience among the elderly at the individual level have not produced a standard methodology. Moreover, resilience measurements need to incorporate external structural and system-level factors that determine the resources that adults can access while recovering from aging-related adversities. We use the National Academies of Science conceptualization of resilience for natural disasters to frame resilience for aging adults. This enables development of a generalized theory of resilience for different individual and structural contexts and populations, including a specific application to the COVID-19 pandemic.","Klasa, Katarzyna; Galaitsi, Stephanie; Wister, Andrew; Linkov, Igor",BMC Geriatr,,177
442947,The Development and Realisation of a Multi-Faceted System for Green Building Planning: A Case in Ningbo Using the Fuzzy Analytical Hierarchy Process,2020,"BACKGROUND: Unlike other respiratory viruses, SARS-CoV-2 causes anosmia without sinonasal inflammation. Here we systematically review the effects of the 7 known human coronaviruses on olfaction to determine if SARS-CoV-2 distinctly affects the olfactory system. METHOD: PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, bioRxiv, medRxiv and DOAJ were searched for studies describing pathophysiological, immunohistochemical, cytological and clinical data. RESULTS: 49 studies were included. Common cold coronaviruses lead to sinonasal inflammation which can cause transient and chronic loss of smell. MERS-CoV entry receptors were not found in the nasal mucosa and it did not impair olfaction. SARS-CoV-1 had low affinity for its receptor ACE2, limiting olfactory effects. Anosmia is frequent in SARS-CoV-2 infections. SARS-CoV-2â&#8482;s entry factors ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are expressed in the nasal respiratory epithelium and olfactory supporting cells. SARS-CoV-2 appeared to target the olfactory cleft while diffuse nasal inflammation was not observed. Damage of the olfactory epithelium was observed in animal models. Alternative receptors such as furin and neuropilin-1 and the similarity of viral proteins to odourant receptors could amplify olfactory impairment in SARS-CoV-2 infection. CONCLUSIONS: The pathophysiology of anosmia in SARS-CoV-2 infection is distinct from other coronaviruses due to preferentially targeting olfactory supporting cells. However, SARS-CoV-2 does not cause sinonasal inflammation in spite of preferred entry factor expression in the nasal respiratory epithelium. This raises doubts about the attention given to ACE2. Alternative receptors, odourant receptor mimicry and other as yet unknown mechanisms may be crucial in the pathogenesis of anosmia in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Further studies are warranted to investigate infection mechanisms beyond ACE2.","Zugaj, M; van Ditzhuijzen, N S; Golebski, K; Fokkens, W J",Rhinology,,177
443821,Teaching data management and literacy to support course-embedded research projects,2021,"Governments around the world have increasingly relied on technology to promote public health, such as using electronic health records and portable fitness devices. During the COVID-19 pandemic, ""contact tracing apps"" for smartphones have also been promoted in many countries as a way to allow public officials to facilitate contact tracing. But uptake in virtually all countries where such apps have been promoted is slow, one reason being privacy concerns. Conducting three experiments across France (n = 471), Australia (n = 202), and the United States (n = 1,005), we explore if salient COVID-19 concerns, which intuitively should increase concerns about personal and public health, might in fact increase privacy concerns and thereby reduce uptake of contact tracing apps. Using an experimental design where we randomly assign participants to either a disease concerns or control condition, we find that salient COVID-19 concerns decrease intentions to download contact tracing apps. Mediation results reveal that greater valuations of privacy explain the lower willingness. We therefore explain why COVID-19 contact tracing apps that are promoted when the pandemic is at its peak see low levels of uptake. Our results provide policy makers with implications concerning how to promote uptake to help ""flatten the curve"" of not just the current pandemic but potentially also future ones.","Chan, Eugene Y; Saqib, Najam U",Comput Human Behav,,177

Very quickly, there was a drop in the rate of hospital attendance. The purpose of this study was to observe the variations in the uptake of pediatric consultations and vaccinations in a pediatric hospital. METHODS: A descriptive and retrospective cross-sectional study was carried out using consultation and vaccination statistics from a pediatric hospital in the city of Yaoundé, political capital of Cameroon, from January 2016 to May 2020. Data were entered in Microsoft Excel and exported to R software (Version 3.3.3) for statistical analysis. First, time series raw data (before and after COVID-19) were plotted and the trend estimated by locally weighted scatterplot smoothing (LOWESS) methods. Then a classic seasonal decomposition was performed to distinguish between seasonal trends and irregular components using moving averages. The Webel-Ollech overall seasonality test (WO test) was also run to formally check for seasonality. The results of the study are presented as narrative tables and graphs. RESULTS: Following the partial confinement recommended by the government of Cameroon, the number of pediatric consultations decreased by 52% in April and by 34% in May 2020 compared with rates during the same periods in 2019 (P=0.00001). For antenatal visits, the rates dropped by 45% and 34%, respectively, in April and May 2020 compared with 2019. The demand for immunization services also declined. As a result, the demand for BCG vaccines, third-dose tracer vaccines (diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis), polio, and MMR in children as well as tetanus vaccines in childbearing women dropped significantly. CONCLUSION: The start of the COVID-19 pandemic was accompanied by a significant drop in consultation and vaccination activities. If no action is taken to correct this phenomenon, the ensuing months could be marked by a considerable increase in patients, sometimes suffering from vaccine-preventable diseases. The death rate could increase considerably in the pediatric population.","Chelo, D; Nguefack, F; Enyama, D; Nansseu, R; Feudjo Tefoueyet, G; Mbassi Awa, H D; Mekone Nkwelle, I; Nguefack-Tsague, G; Ndenbe, P; Koki Ndombo, P O",Arch Pediatr,,177
445405,Urban Planning Regulations for Tourism in the Context of Overtourism. Applications in Historic Centres,2021,"Viscoelastic fluids are a common subclass of rheologically complex materials that are encountered in diverse fields from biology to polymer processing. Often the flows of viscoelastic fluids are unstable in situations where ordinary Newtonian fluids are stable, owing to the nonlinear coupling of the elastic and viscous stresses. Perhaps more surprisingly, the instabilities produce flows with the hallmarks of turbulence -- even though the effective Reynolds numbers may be $O(1)$ or smaller. We provide perspectives on viscoelastic flow instabilities by integrating the input from speakers at a recent international workshop: historical remarks, characterization of fluids and flows, discussion of experimental and simulation tools, and modern questions and puzzles that motivate further studies of this fascinating subject. The materials here will be useful for researchers and educators alike, especially as the subject continues to evolve in both fundamental understanding and applications in engineering and the sciences.","Datta, Sujit S.; Ardekani, Arezoo M.; Arratia, Paulo E.; Beris, Antony N.; Bischofberger, Irmgard; Eggers, Jens G.; L'opez-Aguilar, J.

445652,Count Data Time Series Modelling in Julia-The CountTimeSeries.jl Package and Applications,2021,"Since the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020, the strain on healthcare services affected patients suffering from various comorbidities and added to the psychological burden. The study aimed to assess the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and anxiety levels of pediatric Hematology/Oncology patients during the COVID19 pandemic and evaluate the association between anxiety levels and physical, emotional, and social aspects of HRQoL. A cross-sectional study was conducted on 292 children between 2.5 - 13 years with chronic hematological/oncological disorders. Pediatric Quality of Life Generic Core Scale and Spence Children's Anxiety Scale were used for assessment of HRQoL and anxiety, respectively. Linear regression was performed to assess the association between background and COVID-19 related factors with anxiety level. Multivariate Analysis of Variance (MANOVA) was performed to assess the association between the three HRQoL dimensions with child anxiety and different independent variables. Transfusion-dependent patients had lower anxiety levels than patients receiving chemotherapy (B=-14.45, 95% CI=-21.94,-6.95).Children who were aware of the pandemic had lower anxiety scores than those who were not, while those suffering from canceled clinic days had higher anxiety levels (B=-8.66,95% CI=-14.86,-2.45, and B = 7.33,95% CI =1.22,13.45, respectively). Anxiety significantly reduced the three HRQoL domains (B=-0.36, 95% CI=-0.47, -0.24 for physical functioning, B=-0.45, 95% CI =-0.56, -0.33 for social functioning and B=-0.50, 95% CI=-0.63,-0.38 for emotional functioning). This study highlights the effect of the pandemic on the anxiety level and hence the HRQoL of chronic hematological/oncological pediatric patients for guiding policies and interventions to maintain their psychological well-being.","Hassan, Eman; Nagui Rizk, Dalia; Aly, Nourhan M; El Chazli, Yasmine",Pediatr Hematol Oncol,,177
445751,China's Eight Arguments Against Western 'Hubris' and Why They Fail,2020,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has created a precipitous increase in the need for molecular diagnostics. Unfortunately, access to RNA extraction reagents can represent a bottleneck for quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR)-based methodologies, stemming from both extraordinary supply-chain stresses and the global reach of the virus into resource-limited settings. To provide flexible diagnostic options for such environments, we report here an ""unextracted modification"" for qRT-PCR using the Centers for Disease Control's (CDC's) widely utilized primers/probe sets for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (N1/N2/N3 targeting viral nucleocapsid and RP-control targeting human RNase P). This approach replaces RNA extraction/purification with a heat-inactivation step of viral transport media (VTM), followed by direct inoculation-with or without VTM spin concentration-into PCR master mixes. Using derivatives of care from our clinical workflow, we compared traditional and unextracted CDC methodologies. Although some decrease in analytic sensitivity was evident (by higher Ct values) without extraction, in particular for the N2 primer/probe-set, we observed high categorical positive agreement between extracted and unextracted results for N1 (unconcentrated VTM-38/40; concentrated VTM-39/41), N3 (unconcentrated VTM-38/40; concentrated VTM-41/41), and RP (unconcentrated and concentrated VTM-81/81). The negative categorical agreement for N1/N2/N3 was likewise high. Overall, these results suggest that laboratories could adapt and validate unextracted qRT-PCR protocols as a contingency to overcome supply limitations, with minimal impact on categorical results.","Adams, Nicholas M; Leelawong, Mindy; Benton, Alison; Quinn, Criziel; Haselton, Frederick R; Schmitz, Jonathan E",J. med. virol,,177

446078,A stochastic network design problem for hazardous waste management,2020,"Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is one of the earliest stages of breast cancer (BCa). The mechanisms by which DCIS lesions progress to an invasive state while others remain indolent are yet to be fully characterized and both diagnosis and treatment of this pre-invasive disease could benefit from better understanding the pathways involved. While a decreased expression of Caveolin-1 (Cav-1) in the tumor microenvironment of patients with DCIS breast cancer was linked to progression to invasive breast cancer (IBC), the downstream effector(s) contributing to this process remain elusive. The current report shows elevated expression of Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 5a (STAT5a) within the DCIS-like lesions in Cav-1 KO mice following estrogen treatment and inhibition of STAT5a expression prevented the formation of these mammary lesions. In addition, STAT5a overexpression in a human DCIS cell line (MCF10DCIS.com) promoted their invasion, a process accelerated by estrogen treatment and associated with increased levels of the matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) precursor. In sum, our results demonstrate a novel regulatory axis (Cav-1â¦STAT5aâ¦MMP-9) in DCIS that is fully activated by the presence of estrogen. Our studies suggest to further study phosphorylated STAT5a (Y694) as a potential biomarker to guide and predict outcome of DCIS patient population.","Dees, Sundee; Pontiggia, Laura; Jasmin, Jean-Francois; Sotgia, Federica; Lisanti, Michael P; Mercier, Isabelle","Aging (Albany, N.Y.

This study aims to evaluate the Nigerian situation with respect to surgical training, with a view to identifying gaps and proffering solutions. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey of surgical residents in Nigeria was conducted between 27 July 2020 and 14 August 2020. A structured questionnaire designed using the free software Google Forms® was utilised for the study. The questionnaire was electronically distributed randomly to 250 surgical residents via emails and social media platforms including WhatsApp and Telegram. The data obtained was analysed by Google Forms®. Ethical approval for the study was obtained from the ethics and research unit of the Obafemi Awolowo University Teaching Hospitals Complex (OAUTHC), Ile-Ife, Osun State, Nigeria. RESULTS: At the end of the study period, 207 surgical residents completed and submitted the questionnaire, giving a response rate of 82.8%. The majority of respondents reported a reduction (164, 79.2%) or cancellation (11, 5.3%) of postgraduate programmes in their institutions. Of those who had academic programmes, meetings were done using virtual technology in all instances. The majority of respondents reported seeing fewer patients in the outpatient clinics (173, 83.6%), as well as a reduction in the number of emergency and elective operations (58.5% and 90.8%, respectively). About a third of the respondents (70, 33.8%) were contemplating emigrating from the country. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly affected the clinical, research and teaching components of surgical training in Nigeria. It has, however, led to increased adoption of digital technology which should be further explored in the face of current realities.","Adesunkanmi, AbdulHafiz Oladapo; Ubom, Akaninyene Eseme; Olasehinde, Olalekan; Wuraola, Funmilola Olanike; Ijarotimi, Omotade Adebimpe; Okon, Nwedobong Ededem; Ikimalo, John Igemo; Fasubaa, Olusola Benjamin; Adesunkanmi, Abdul Rashid Kayode",World J Surg,,177

449920,Prediction of COVID-19 - Pneumonia based on Selected Deep Features and One Class Kernel Extreme Learning Machine,2021,"Background: Atypical presentations of COVID-19 pose difficulties for early isolation and treatment, particularly in institutional care settings. We aimed to characterize the presenting symptoms and associated mortality of COVID-19 in older adults, focusing on care home residents admitted to secondary care. Methods: A retrospective cohort study of 134 consecutive inpatients over 80 years old hospitalized with PCR confirmed COVID-19 in the United Kingdom. Symptoms at presentation and frailty were analysed. Differences between community dwelling and care home residents, and associations with mortality, were assessed using between-group comparisons and logistic regression. Results: Care home residents were less likely to experience cough (46.9% vs 72.9%, P =.002) but more likely to present with delirium (51.6% vs 31.4%, P =.018), particularly hypoactive delirium (40.6% vs 24.3%, P =.043). Mortality was more likely with increasing frailty (OR 1.25, 95% CI 1.00, 1.58, P =.049) and those presenting with anorexia (OR 3.20, 95% CI 1.21, 10.09, P =.028). There were no differences in mortality or length of stay based on residential status. Conclusion: COVID-19 in older adults often presents with atypical symptoms, particularly in those admitted from institutional care. These individuals have a reduced incidence of cough and increased hypoactive delirium. Individuals presenting atypically, especially with anorexia, have higher mortality.","Rawle, Mark James; Bertfield, Deborah Lee; Brill, Simon Edward",Aging Med.,,177
449999,Science knowledge and trust in medicine affect individuals’ behavior in pandemic crises,2021,"In contrast to the common assumption in epidemic models that the rate of infection between individuals is constant, in reality, an individual's viral load determines their infectiousness. We compare the average and individual reproductive numbers, epidemic dynamics, and intervention strategies for a model incorporating time-dependent infectiousness and a standard SIR model for both fully-mixed and category-mixed populations. We find that the reproductive number only depends on the total infectious exposure and the largest eigenvalue of the mixing matrix and that these two effects are independent of each other. When we compare our time-dependent mean-field model to the SIR model with equivalent rates, the epidemic peak is advanced and modifying the infection rate function has a strong effect on the time dynamics of the epidemic. We also observe behavior akin to a traveling wave as individuals transition through infectious states.","Landry, Nicholas",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.10384v2.pdf,177

451327,Comparing a deep learning model's diagnostic performance to that of radiologists to detect Covid -19 features on chest radiographs,2021,"Biological connective tissues, such as cartilage and corneal stroma, are essentially hydrogels consisting of fibrous collagen and proteoglycans. Little is known of the surface properties of the hydrogel, although we observe fascinating tribological behavior in biological soft tissues, such as extremely low friction between animal cartilages. We consider that the role of the solvated polymer network existing in the extracellular matrix as a gel state is critically important in the specific frictional behavior of cartilages. In order to elucidate the general tribological features of a solvated polymer matrix, the friction of various kinds of hydrogels has been investigated, and very rich and complex frictional behaviors are observed. The friction force and its dependence on the load differ with the chemical structure of the gels, surface properties of the opposing substrates, and the measurement conditions, which are totally different from those of solids. Most importantly, the coefficient of friction of gels, , varies over a wide range and exhibits very low values (&#8776; 10-10), which cannot be obtained from the friction between two solid materials. A repulsion-adsorption model has been proposed to explain the gel friction, which says that the friction is due to lubrication of a hydrated layer of polymer chains when the polymer chain of the gel is non-adhesive (repulsive) to the substrate, and the friction is due to elastic deformation of the adsorbed polymer chain when it is adhesive to the substrate.","Gong, Jian Ping",Soft Matter,,177

An answer from a legal system,2020,"BACKGROUND: Despite most cases not requiring hospital care, there are limited community-based clinical data on COVID-19. METHODS: The Corona São Caetano programme is a primary care initiative providing care to all residents with COVID-19 in São Caetano do Sul, Brazil. It was designed to capture standardised clinical data on community COVID-19 cases. After triage of potentially severe cases, consecutive patients presenting to a multimedia screening platform between 13 April and 13 May 2020 were tested at home with SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcriptase (RT) PCR; positive patients were followed up for 14 days with phone calls every 2 days. RT-PCR-negative patients were offered additional SARS-CoV-2 serology testing to establish their infection status. We describe the clinical, virological and natural history features of this prospective population-based cohort. FINDINGS: Of 2073 suspected COVID-19 cases, 1583 (76.4%) were tested by RT-PCR, of whom 444 (28.0%, 95% CI 25.9 to 30.3) were positive; 604/1136 (53%) RT-PCR-negative patients underwent serology, of whom 52 (8.6%) tested SARS-CoV-2 seropositive. The most common symptoms of confirmed COVID-19 were cough, fatigue, myalgia and headache; whereas self-reported fever (OR 3.0, 95% CI 2.4 to 3.9), anosmia (OR 3.3, 95% CI 2.6 to 4.4) and ageusia (OR 2.9, 95% CI 2.3 to 3.8) were most strongly associated with a positive COVID-19 diagnosis by RT-PCR or serology. RT-PCR cycle thresholds were lower in men, older patients, those with fever and arthralgia and closer to symptom onset. The rates of hospitalisation and death among 444 RT-PCR-positive cases were 6.7% and 0.7%, respectively, with older age and obesity more frequent in the hospitalised group. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 presents in a similar way to other mild community-acquired respiratory diseases, but the presence of fever, anosmia and ageusia can assist the specific diagnosis. Most patients recovered without requiring hospitalisation with a low fatality rate compared with other hospital-based studies.","Leal, Fabio E; Mendes-Correa, Maria C; Buss, Lewis Fletcher; Costa, Silvia F; Bizario, Joao C S; de Souza, Sonia R P; Thomaz, Osorio; Tozetto-Mendoza, Tania Regina; Villas-Boas, Lucy S; de Oliveira-da Silva, Léa Campos; Grespan, Regina M Z; Capuani, Ligia; Buccheri, Renata; Domingues, Helves; Alexander, Neal; Mayaud, Philippe; Sabino, Ester Cerdeira",BMJ Open,,177

Cognitive models can explain why scientists adopt hypotheses about the causes and treatments of disease based on explanatory coherence. Irrational deviations from good reasoning are explained by motivated inference in which conclusions are influenced by personal goals that contribute to emotional coherence. Decisions about COVID-19 can also be distorted by well-known psychological and neural mechanisms. Cognitive science provides advice about how to improve human behavior in pandemics by changing beliefs and by improving behaviors that result from intention-action gaps.","Thagard, Paul",Methods (S.

457720,Real-time neural network scheduling of emergency medical mask production during COVID-19,2020,"Background: The use of cytokine-blocking agents has been proposed to modulate the inflammatory response in patients with COVID-19. Tocilizumab and anakinra were included in the local protocol as an optional treatment in critically ill patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) by SARS-CoV-2 infection. This cohort study evaluated the effects of therapy with cytokine blocking agents on in-hospital mortality in COVID-19 patients requiring mechanical ventilation and admitted to intensive care unit. Methods: The association between therapy with tocilizumab or anakinra and in-hospital mortality was assessed in consecutive adult COVID-19 patients admitted to our ICU with moderate to severe ARDS. The association was evaluated by comparing patients who received to those who did not receive tocilizumab or anakinra and by using different multivariable Cox models adjusted for variables related to poor outcome, for the propensity to be treated with tocilizumab or anakinra and after patient matching. Results: Sixty-six patients who received immunotherapy (49 tocilizumab, 17 anakinra) and 28 patients who did not receive immunotherapy were included. The in-hospital crude mortality was 30,3% in treated patients and 50% in nontreated (OR 0.77, 95% CI 0.56-1.05, p=0.069). The adjusted Cox model showed an association between therapy with immunotherapy and in-hospital mortality (HR 0.40, 95% CI 0.19-0.83, p=0.015). This protective effect was further confirmed in the analysis adjusted for propensity score, in the propensity-matched cohort and in the cohort of patients with invasive mechanical ventilation within 2 hours after ICU admission. Conclusions: Although important limitations, our study showed that cytokine-blocking agents seem to be safe and to improve survival in COVID-19 patients admitted to ICU with ARDS and the need for mechanical ventilation.","Coloretti, I.; Busani, S.; Biagioni, E.; Venturelli, S.; Munari, E.; Sita, M.; DallAra, L.; Tosi, M.; Clini, E.; Tonelli, R.; Fantini, R.; Mussini, C.; Meschiari, M.; Guaraldi, G.; Cossarizza, A.; Alfano, G.; Girardis, M.",Multidisciplinary Respiratory Medicine,,177

The ability to predict which patients may require mechanical ventilation allows increased acuity of care and targeted interventions to potentially mitigate deterioration. METHODS: We included hospitalised patients with COVID-19 in this single-centre retrospective observational study. Our primary outcome was mechanical ventilation or death within 24 h. As clinical decompensation is more recognisable, but less modifiable, as the prediction window shrinks, we also assessed 4, 8, and 48 h prediction windows. Model features included demographic information, laboratory results, comorbidities, medication administration, and vital signs. We created a Random Forest model, and assessed performance using 10-fold cross-validation. The model was compared with models derived from generalised estimating equations using discrimination. RESULTS: Ninety-three (23%) of 398 patients required mechanical ventilation or died within 14 days of admission. The Random Forest model predicted pending mechanical ventilation with good discrimination (C-statistic=0.858; 95% confidence interval, 0.841-0.874), which is comparable with the discrimination of the generalised estimating equation regression. Vitals sign data including SpO2/FiO2 ratio (Random Forest Feature Importance Z-score=8.56), ventilatory frequency (5.97), and heart rate (5.87) had the highest predictive utility. In our highest-risk cohort, the number of patients needed to identify a single new case was 3.2, and for our second quintile it was 5.0. CONCLUSION: Machine learning techniques can be leveraged to improve the ability to predict which patients with COVID-19 are likely to require mechanical ventilation, identifying unrecognised bellwethers and providing insight into the constellation of accompanying signs of respiratory failure in COVID-19.","Douville, Nicholas J; Douville, Christopher B; Mentz, Graciela; Mathis, Michael R; Pancaro, Carlo; Tremper, Kevin K; Engoren, Milo",Br. j. anaesth,,177
459162,A commentary on the value of hospital data for covid-19 pandemic surveillance and planning,2021,"INTRODUCTION: Discoid lupus erythematosus (DLE) is a common manifestation of lupus erythematosus. Hydroxychloroquine is commonly used in the treatment of lupus erythematosus. The present study aims to report hallucinations induced by hydroxychloroquine. CASE PRESENTATION: A 37-year-old woman came to the dermatology clinic with a complaint of a red lesion on her left cheek. Physical examination revealed an ulcerative erythematous plaque with keratotic scales, an atrophic area of ~ 2 × 2.5 cm. Biopsy of the lesion was performed, and histopathology result was consistent with the diagnosis of DLE. Laboratory tests were all normal. Topical clobetasol and pimecrolimus were prescribed for the patient, who was recommended to use sunscreen as well. However, the treatment did not work, thus hydroxychloroquine 200 mg daily was added to the treatment. After a week, the patient came back to the clinic with her husband with the complaint of auditory and visual hallucinations, nightmares, and occasional decrease in consciousness level. After neurology and psychiatric consultation, hydroxychloroquine was discontinued and replaced with intralesional administration of triamcinolone. The lesion disappeared and did not recur. DISCUSSION: Previous studies and the lack of another explanation for the patient's hallucinations imply a strong correlation between hydroxychloroquine and hallucinations. The mechanism of these side effects has not been fully elucidated. However, this side effect has only been reported in cases of connective tissue diseases. As currently hydroxychloroquine is widely used in the treatment of COVID-19 and other diseases, its potential risk of psychiatric complications should be considered in clinical practice.","Ganjei, Zakiye; Bahmani, Kiumars",Int. j. clin. pharmacol. ther,,177

Technology, Blogging from a Pedagogical Consideration and Teaching International Economic Law: Taking Blogging Seriously from the Lens of AfronomicsLaw Blog (preprint)",2021,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has forced drastic changes to daily life, from the implementation of stay-at-home orders to mandating facial coverings and limiting in-person gatherings. While the relaxation of these control measures has varied geographically, it is widely agreed that contact tracing efforts will play a major role in the successful reopening of businesses and schools. As the volume of positive cases has increased in the United States, it has become clear that there is room for digital health interventions to assist in contact tracing. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to evaluate the use of a mobile-friendly app designed to supplement manual COVID-19 contact tracing efforts on a university campus. Here, we present the results of a development and validation study centered around the use of the MyCOVIDKey app on the Vanderbilt University campus during the summer of 2020. METHODS: We performed a 6-week pilot study in the Stevenson Center Science and Engineering Complex on Vanderbilt University's campus in Nashville, TN. Graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, faculty, and staff >18 years who worked in Stevenson Center and had access to a mobile phone were eligible to register for a MyCOVIDKey account. All users were encouraged to complete regular self-assessments of COVID-19 risk and to key in to sites by scanning a location-specific barcode. RESULTS: Between June 17, 2020, and July 29, 2020, 45 unique participants created MyCOVIDKey accounts. These users performed 227 self-assessments and 1410 key-ins. Self-assessments were performed by 89% (n=40) of users, 71% (n=32) of users keyed in, and 48 unique locations (of 71 possible locations) were visited. Overall, 89% (202/227) of assessments were determined to be low risk (ie, asymptomatic with no known exposures), and these assessments yielded a CLEAR status. The remaining self-assessments received a status of NOT CLEAR, indicating either risk of exposure or symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 (7.5% [n=17] and 3.5% [n=8] of self-assessments indicated moderate and high risk, respectively). These 25 instances came from 8 unique users, and in 19 of these instances, the at-risk user keyed in to a location on campus. CONCLUSIONS: Digital contact tracing tools may be useful in assisting organizations to identify persons at risk of COVID-19 through contact tracing, or in locating places that may need to be cleaned or disinfected after being visited by an index case. Incentives to continue the use of such tools can improve uptake, and their continued usage increases utility to both organizational and public health efforts. Parameters of digital tools, including MyCOVIDKey, should ideally be optimized to supplement existing contact tracing efforts. These tools represent a critical addition to manual contact tracing efforts during reopening and sustained regular activity.","Scherr, Thomas Foster; Hardcastle, Austin N; Moore, Carson Paige; DeSousa, Jenna Maria; Wright, David Wilson",JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,,177
460662,Technology Trends: Winning With ACES,2020,"School lockdowns in response to COVID-19 have forced teachers around the world to quickly and unexpectedly shift from face-to-face to distance teaching. The struggle with the forced transition has been even more severe in the lower levels of schooling than in higher education institutions, which had already established online course delivery before the crisis. The current paper investigates Finnish primary teachers’ principles for high-quality distance teaching. Twenty primary teachers were interviewed in April 2020 during the fourth week of the two-month distance teaching period. The findings from phenomenographic analysis revealed that high-quality distance teaching at the primary level requires (1) relatedness, (2) design, (3) routine, and (4) control. This study illustrates the understanding of teachers’ working in a basic education system ranked among the best in the world and thus provides valuable insights for developing instructional practices in distance education.

To profitably use this model, the most suitable values of its parameters must be found. The estimation of the SEIR--SD model parameters takes place here through the use of Differential Evolution, a heuristic optimization technique. In this way, we are able to evaluate for each of the three above-mentioned scenarios the daily number of infectious cases from today until the end of virus spreading, the day(s) in which this number will be at its highest peak, and the day in which the infected cases will become very close to zero.","Falco, I.

The surge of COVID-19 cases in India and across the globe necessitates a rapid and sensitive molecular assay. Rapid point-of-care (PoC) assays (Truenat Beta CoV and Truenat SARS-CoV-2 assays) for the diagnosis of COVID-19 have been developed which are expected to shorten the turnaround time of reporting of results and also can be used for field investigations of COVID-19. The objectives of the study were to validate the performance of Truenat Beta CoV and Truenat SARS-CoV-2 PoC assays for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 infected cases with reference to analytical sensitivity, precision/inter-machine variation, clinical sensitivity and clinical specificity. Methods: The rapid PoC screening and confirmatory assays were prospectively validated at the State Level Virus Research and Diagnostic Laboratory at Bangalore Medical College and Research Institute, Bengaluru, under technical supervision by the Indian Council of Medical Research-National Institute of Virology (ICMR-NIV), Pune. Real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR)was considered as the reference standard against which the rapid assays were validated for all samples tested based on analytical sensitivity, precision/inter-machine variation, clinical sensitivity and clinical specificity. Results: Truenat Beta CoV and Truenat SARS-CoV-2 assays showed concordant results when compared with the reference standard rRT-PCR. These PoC assays exhibited 100 per cent sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value. Interpretation & conclusions: Truenat Beta CoV and Truenat SARS-CoV-2 assays showed concordance with the reference standard assay and may be recommended for screening and confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 in the field settings.","Basawarajappa, Shantala Gowdara; Rangaiah, Ambica; Padukone, Shashiraja; Yadav, Pragya D; Gupta, Nivedita; Shankar, Sathyanarayan Muthur",Indian journal of medical research,,177

In this regard, it is expected that information level and sharing between equity, digital currency, and energy markets has been altered due to the pandemic outbreak. Specifically, the resulting twisted risk among markets is presumed to rise during the abnormal state of world economy. The purpose of the current study is twofold. First, by using Renyi entropy, we analyze the multiscale entropy function in the return time series of Bitcoin, S&P500, WTI, Brent, Gas, Gold, Silver, and investor fear index represented by VIX. Second, by estimating mutual information, we analyze the information sharing between these markets. The analyses are conducted before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. The empirical results from Renyi entropy indicate that for all market indices, randomness and disorder are more concentrated in less probable events. The empirical results from mutual information showed that the information sharing network between markets has changed during the COVID-19 pandemic. From a managerial perspective, we conclude that during the pandemic (i) portfolios composed of Bitcoin and Silver, Bitcoin and WTI, Bitcoin and Gold, Bitcoin and Brent, or Bitcoin and S&P500 could be risky, (ii) diversification opportunities exist by investing in portfolios composed of Gas and Silver, Gold and Silver, Gold and Gas, Brent and Silver, Brent and Gold, or Bitcoin and Gas, and that (iii) the VIX exhibited the lowest level of information disorder at all scales before and during the pandemic.

RESULTS: A total of 230 records were analyzed including demographic, encounter, medical, and functional variables. In a propensity-score matched cohort based on age and comorbidity, 88.2% had functional physical health deficits, 72.5% had functional mental health deficits, and 17.6% experienced sensory deficits. In the matched cohort, individuals discharged to an institution experienced greater physical (62.7% vs. 25.5%, p<.001) and mental health (49.0% vs. 23.5%, p=.006) deficits than patients discharged home. Marital status (OR 3.17, p=.011) and physical function deficits (OR 3.63, p=0.025) were associated with an increase odds ratio of discharge to an institution. CONCLUSIONS: This research highlights that functional status is a strong predictor for discharge destination to an institution for COVID-19 patients. Patients who were older, in the acute care hospital longer, and with comorbidities were more likely to be discharged to an institution. Rehabilitation is a significant aspect of the healthcare system for these vulnerable patients. The challenges of adjusting the role of rehabilitation providers and systems during the pandemic needs further exploration. Moreover, additional research is needed to look more closely at the many facets and timing of functional status needs, to shed light in utilization of interdisciplinary rehabilitation services, and to guide providers and healthcare systems in facilitating optimal recovery and patient outcomes.","Roberts, Pamela; Wertheimer, Jeffrey; Park, Eunice; Nuño, Miriam; Riggs, Richard",Arch. phys. med. rehabil,,177

472492,Feature Guided Search for Creative Problem Solving Through Tool Construction,2020-08-24,"The spike (S) protein of coronavirus, which binds to cellular receptors and mediates membrane fusion for cell entry, is a candidate vaccine target for blocking coronavirus infection. However, some animal studies have suggested that inadequate immunization against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) induces a lung eosinophilic immunopathology upon infection. The present study evaluated two kinds of vaccine adjuvants for use with recombinant S protein: gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), which are expected to function as both an antigen carrier and an adjuvant in immunization; and Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists, which have previously been shown to be an effective adjuvant in an ultraviolet-inactivated SARS-CoV vaccine. All the mice immunized with more than 0.5 µg S protein without adjuvant escaped from SARS after infection with mouse-adapted SARS-CoV; however, eosinophilic infiltrations were observed in the lungs of almost all the immunized mice. The AuNP-adjuvanted protein induced a strong IgG response but failed to improve vaccine efficacy or to reduce eosinophilic infiltration because of highly allergic inflammatory responses. Whereas similar virus titers were observed in the control animals and the animals immunized with S protein with or without AuNPs, Type 1 interferon and pro-inflammatory responses were moderate in the mice treated with S protein with and without AuNPs. On the other hand, the TLR agonist-adjuvanted vaccine induced highly protective antibodies without eosinophilic infiltrations, as well as Th1/17 cytokine responses. The findings of this study will support the development of vaccines against severe pneumonia-associated coronaviruses.","Sekimukai, Hanako; Iwata-Yoshikawa, Naoko; Fukushi, Shuetsu; Tani, Hideki; Kataoka, Michiyo; Suzuki, Tadaki; Hasegawa, Hideki; Niikura, Kenichi; Arai, Katsuhiko; Nagata, Noriyo",Microbiol Immunol,,177
473251,Retrospective and prospective application of robots and artificial intelligence in global pandemic and epidemic diseases,2021,"BACKGROUND: Serum neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) could be used as a predictive marker of acute kidney injury (AKI) in patients with return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) who are managed with targeted temperature management (TTM). However, the NGAL measurement timepoints vary from immediately after ROSC to several days later. The primary objective of this study was to determine an association between AKI and NGAL, both immediately (ROSC-NGAL) and 3 h after ROSC (3 h-NGAL), in OHCA patients with TTM. The secondary objective was to ascertain the association between NGAL levels in the early post-ROSC phase and the neurologic outcomes at discharge. METHODS: This prospective observational study was conducted between January 2016 and December 2018 and enrolled adult OHCA patients (&#8805;18 years) with TTM after ROSC. The serum NGAL level was measured both immediately and 3 h after ROSC. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify the associations between AKI, poor neurologic outcome, and NGAL. RESULTS: Among 861 OHCA patients, 89 patients were enrolled. AKI occurred in 48 (55.1%) patients. On multivariate logistic regression analysis, 3 h-NGAL was significantly associated with AKI (odds ratio [OR] 1.022; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.009-1.035; p = 0.001). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 3 h-NGAL for AKI was 0.910 (95% CI 0.830-0.960), and a cut-off value of 178 ng/mL was identified. Both ROSC-NGAL and 3 h-NGAL were not significantly associated with poor neurologic outcome on multivariate logistic regression analysis (ROSC-NGAL; OR 1.017; 95% CI 0.998-1.036; p = 0.084, 3 h-NGAL; OR 0.997; 95% CI 0.992-1.001; p = 0.113). CONCLUSIONS: The serum NGAL concentration measured 3 h after ROSC is an excellent early predictive marker for AKI in OHCA patients treated with TTM. Future research is needed to identify the optimal measurement timepoint to establish NGAL as a predictor of neurologic outcome and to validate the findings of this research.","Choi, Yoon Hee; Lee, Dong Hoon; Lee, Jae Hee",BMC Nephrol,,177

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A prospective analysis was undertaken of retrospective data from cirrhotic patients who underwent oesophago-gastro-duodenoscopy (OGD) and a triphasic abdominal CT from January to December 2019. Endoscopists and radiologists provided their respective independent assessment of OV grading after being blinded to the clinical details. Performance of CT grading of OVs was compared with the reference standard endoscopic grading using weighted kappa (k). Non-invasive scores such, as aspartate transaminase (AST)-to-platelet ratio index (APRI), Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) Index, platelet: spleen (PS) ratio were correlated between the two techniques. RESULTS: OV grading between endoscopists and radiologists showed 81.73% agreement (85 out of 104 patients) in the comparative analysis of 104 cirrhotic patients, of which no varices (57.1%, n=4), small (85.1%, n=23), medium (72.2%%, n=26), and large varices (94.1%, n=32) with a weighted k score of 0.88 (95% confidence interval 0.82-0.94). Overall, the sensitivity of CT in the diagnosis of no, small, medium, and large OVs was 66.6%, 79.3%, 89.6%, and 94.1%, respectively, with an area under the receiver operating curve (AUROC) score of 0.775, 0.887, 0.839, and 0.914. Performance of APRI, FIB-4, and PS ratio correlated well with the severity of OVs with no difference between OGD and CT grading. CONCLUSION: Triphasic abdominal CT can be an invaluable tool in the diagnosis and grading of OVs during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Jothimani, D; Danielraj, S; Nallathambi, B; Pandurangan, B; Kalyanasundaram, S; Subbiah, K; Ramachandran, H; Venugopal, R; Dhas, D; Rela, M",Clin Radiol,,177

In this commentary, we explore how digital health can support the diabetes community through the pandemic. For those living with diabetes, digital health presents the opportunity to access care with greater convenience while not having to expose themselves to infection in an in-person clinic. Digital diabetes apps can increase agency in self-care and produce clinically significant improvement in glycemic control through facilitating the capture of diabetes device data. However, the ability to share these data back to the clinic to inform virtual care and enhance diabetes coaching and guidance remains a challenge. In the end, it requires an unnecessarily high level of technical sophistication on the clinic's part and on those living with diabetes to routinely use their diabetes device data in clinic visits, virtual or otherwise.

482023,The Ultimate Safe Haven,2021,"OBJECTIVE: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has led to a global surge in critically ill patients requiring invasive mechanical ventilation, some of whom may benefit from tracheostomy. Decisions on if, when, and how to perform tracheostomy in patients with COVID-19 have major implications for patients, clinicians, and hospitals. We investigated the tracheostomy protocols and practices that institutions around the world have put into place in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. DATA SOURCES: Protocols for tracheostomy in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection from individual institutions (n = 59) were obtained from the United States and 25 other countries, including data from several low- and middle-income countries, 23 published or society-endorsed protocols, and 36 institutional protocols. REVIEW METHODS: The comparative document analysis involved cross-sectional review of institutional protocols and practices. Data sources were analyzed for timing of tracheostomy, contraindications, preoperative testing, personal protective equipment (PPE), surgical technique, and postoperative management. CONCLUSIONS: Timing of tracheostomy varied from 3 to >21 days, with over 90% of protocols recommending 14 days of intubation prior to tracheostomy. Most protocols advocate delaying tracheostomy until COVID-19 testing was negative. All protocols involved use of N95 or higher PPE. Both open and percutaneous techniques were reported. Timing of tracheostomy changes ranged from 5 to >30 days postoperatively, sometimes contingent on negative COVID-19 test results. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Wide variation exists in tracheostomy protocols, reflecting geographical variation, different resource constraints, and limited data to drive evidence-based care standards. Findings presented herein may provide reference points and a framework for evolving care standards.","Bier-Laning, Carol; Cramer, John D; Roy, Soham; Palmieri, Patrick A; Amin, Ayman; Añon, José Manuel; Bonilla-Asalde, Cesar A; Bradley, Patrick J; Chaturvedi, Pankaj; Cognetti, David M; Dias, Fernando; Di Stadio, Arianna; Fagan, Johannes J; Feller-Kopman, David J; Hao, Sheng-Po; Kim, Kwang Hyun; Koivunen, Petri; Loh, Woei Shyang; Mansour, Jobran; Naunheim, Matthew R; Schultz, Marcus J; Shang, You; Sirjani, Davud B; St John, Maie A; Tay, Joshua K; Vergez, Sébastien; Weinreich, Heather M; Wong, Eddy W Y; Zenk, Johannes; Rassekh, Christopher H; Brenner, Michael J",Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,,177

METHODS: This retrospective study mainly applied big data analytics and methodology, using the publicly accessible clinical report for patients (n = 543) confirmed as infected in Shenzhen and Hefei, China. Based on 217 patients on whom the incubation period could be identified by the epidemiological method. Statistical and econometric methods were employed to investigate how the incubation distributions varied between infected cases reported in Shenzhen and Hefei. RESULTS: The median incubation period of the COVID-19 for all the 217 infected patients was 8 days (95% CI 7 to 9), while median values were 9 days in Shenzhen and 4 days in Hefei. The incubation period probably has an inverse U-shaped association with the meteorological temperature. The warmer condition in the winter of Shenzhen, average environmental temperature between 10 °C to 15 °C, may decrease viral virulence and result in more extended incubation periods. CONCLUSION: Case studies of the COVID-19 outbreak in Shenzhen and Hefei indicated that the incubation period of COVID-19 had exhibited evident geographical disparities, although the pathological causality between meteorological conditions and incubation period deserves further investigation. Methodologies based on big data released by local public health authorities are applicable for identifying incubation period and relevant epidemiological research.","Xiao, Zuopeng; Guo, Wenbo; Luo, Zhiqiang; Liao, Jianxiang; Wen, Feiqiu; Lin, Yaoyu",Environ Health Prev Med,,177

To further reveal the pathologic associations between coronavirus and hypoxemia, we report the findings of 4 complete systematic autopsies of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2-positive individuals who died of multiple organ failure caused by severe hypoxemia. MATERIAL AND METHODS We examined the donated corpses of 4 deceased patients who had been diagnosed with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. A complete post-mortem examination was carried out on each corpse, and multiple organs were macroscopically examined. RESULTS The 4 corpses were 2 males and 2 females, with an average age of 69 years. Bilateral lungs showed various degrees of atrophy and consolidation, with diffusely tough and solid texture in the sections. A thromboembolism was found in the main pulmonary artery extending into the atrium in 1 corpse, and significant atherosclerotic plaques tagged in the inner wall of the aortic arch were found in 2 corpses. Two corpses were found to have slightly atrophied bilateral renal parenchyma. Atrophic changes in the spleen were found in 2 corpses. Notably, there were significantly expanded alveolar septa and prominent fibroblastic proliferation. CONCLUSIONS The laboratory data of these corpses showed a progressive decrease in blood oxygen saturation, followed by refractory and irreversible hypoxemia. Clinical and laboratory information and autopsy and histologic presentations of multiple organs showed insufficient air exchange due to abnormalities in the respiratory system, and reduced erythropoiesis in bone marrow may play a role.","Zhang, Heng; Zhou, Jun; Chen, Rong; Ren, Yong; Cai, Jun; Zhao, Lei; Fei, Xiaochun; Liu, Zhenhua; Zhang, Yu; Yuan, Ling; Wang, Chaofu",Med Sci Monit,,177

485414,Toward Reciprocity in Healing: Introduction to the Special Issue,2020,"Background Chest CT is used to assess the severity of lung involvement in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Purpose To determine the changes in chest CT findings associated with COVID-19 from initial diagnosis until patient recovery. Materials and Methods This retrospective review included patients with real-time polymerase chain reaction-confirmed COVID-19 who presented between January 12, 2020, and February 6, 2020. Patients with severe respiratory distress and/or oxygen requirement at any time during the disease course were excluded. Repeat chest CT was performed at approximately 4-day intervals. Each of the five lung lobes was visually scored on a scale of 0 to 5, with 0 indicating no involvement and 5 indicating more than 75% involvement. The total CT score was determined as the sum of lung involvement, ranging from 0 (no involvement) to 25 (maximum involvement). Results Twenty-one patients (six men and 15 women aged 25-63 years) with confirmed COVID-19 were evaluated. A total of 82 chest CT scans were obtained in these patients, with a mean interval (±standard deviation) of 4 days ± 1 (range, 1-8 days). All patients were discharged after a mean hospitalization period of 17 days ± 4 (range, 11-26 days). Maximum lung involved peaked at approximately 10 days (with a calculated total CT score of 6) from the onset of initial symptoms (R2 = 0.25, P < .001). Based on quartiles of chest CT scans from day 0 to day 26 involvement, four stages of lung CT findings were defined. CT scans obtained in stage 1 (0-4 days) showed ground-glass opacities (18 of 24 scans [75%]), with a mean total CT score of 2 ± 2; scans obtained in stage 2 (5-8 days) showed an increase in both the crazy-paving pattern (nine of 17 scans [53%]) and total CT score (mean, 6 ± 4; P = .002); scans obtained in stage 3 (9-13 days) showed consolidation (19 of 21 scans [91%]) and a peak in the total CT score (mean, 7 ± 4); and scans obtained in stage 4 (&#8805;14 days) showed gradual resolution of consolidation (15 of 20 scans [75%]) and a decrease in the total CT score (mean, 6 ± 4) without crazy-paving pattern. Conclusion In patients recovering from coronavirus disease 2019 (without severe respiratory distress during the disease course), lung abnormalities on chest CT scans showed greatest severity approximately 10 days after initial onset of symptoms. © RSNA, 2020.","Pan, Feng; Ye, Tianhe; Sun, Peng; Gui, Shan; Liang, Bo; Li, Lingli; Zheng, Dandan; Wang, Jiazheng; Hesketh, Richard L; Yang, Lian; Zheng, Chuansheng",Radiology,,177
486653,Application of semantic location awareness computing based on data mining in COVID-19 prevention and control system,2020,"PURPOSE: To evaluate the association between the percentages of older age groups among confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections and the country-specific case fatality rate (CFR). METHODS: This ecological study analyzed data from the 20 most severely affected European countries, USA and Canada, in which national health authorities provided data on age distribution and gender among confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases and deaths. RESULTS: The proportion of individuals older than 70 years among confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases differed markedly between the countries, ranging from 4.9 to 40.4%. There was a strong linear association between the proportion of individuals older than 75 years and the country-specific CFRs (R2 = 0.803 for all countries, R2 = 0.961 after exclusion of three countries with incongruent data). Each 5% point increase of this older age group among confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases was associated with an increase in CFR of 2.5% points (95% CI 1.9-3.1). CONCLUSION: Data from 20 European countries and the USA and Canada showed that the variance of crude CFR of COVID-19 is predominantly (80-96%) determined by the proportion of older individuals who are diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2. The age distribution of SARS-CoV-2 infections is still far from being homogeneous. Detailed demographic data have to be taken into account in all the analyses on COVID-19-associated mortality. We urgently call for standardized data collection by national health authorities.","Hoffmann, Christian; Wolf, Eva",Infection,,177
487196,The impact of network topology on air transportation robustness to pandemics,2021,"The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has clearly established how vital rapid, widely accessible diagnostic tests are in controlling infectious diseases and how difficult and slow it is to scale existing technologies. Here, we demonstrate the use of the rapid affinity pair identification via directed selection (RAPIDS) method to discover multiple affinity pairs for SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein (N-protein), a biomarker of COVID-19, from in vitro libraries in 10 weeks. The pair with the highest biomarker sensitivity was then integrated into a 10-minute, vertical-flow cellulose paper test. Notably, the as-identified affinity proteins were compatible with a roll-to-roll printing process for large-scale manufacturing of tests. The test achieved 40 pM and 80 pM limits of detection in 1xPBS (mock swab) and saliva matrices spiked with cell-culture generated SARS-CoV-2 viruses and is also capable of detection of N-protein from characterized clinical swab samples. Hence, this work paves the way towards the mass production of cellulose paper-based assays which can address the shortages faced due to dependence on nitrocellulose and current manufacturing techniques. Further, the results reported herein indicate the promise of RAPIDS and engineered binder proteins for the timely and flexible development of clinically relevant diagnostic tests in response to emerging infectious diseases.","Kim, S.; Yee, E.

We analysed a retrospective cohort of 717 patients admitted to a tertiary centre in Singapore for COVID-19 infection. Clinical outcomes of interest were oxygen saturation &#8804; 94% requiring supplemental oxygen, intensive-care unit (ICU) admission, invasive mechanical-ventilation and death. Patients on long term dyslipidaemia medications (statins, fibrates or ezetimibe) were considered to have dyslipidaemia. Logistic regression models were used to study the association between dyslipidaemia and clinical outcomes adjusted for age, gender and ethnicity. Statin treatment effect was determined, in a nested case-control design, through logistic treatment models with 1:3 propensity matching for age, gender and ethnicity. All statistical tests were two-sided, and statistical significance was taken as p < 0.05. One hundred fifty-six (21.8%) patients had dyslipidaemia and 97% of these were on statins. Logistic treatment models showed a lower chance of ICU admission for statin users when compared to non-statin users (ATET: Coeff (risk difference): - 0.12 (- 0.23, - 0.01); p = 0.028). There were no other significant differences in other outcomes. Statin use was independently associated with lower ICU admission. This supports current practice to continue prescription of statins in COVID-19 patients.","Tan, Wilnard Y T; Young, Barnaby E; Lye, David Chien; Chew, Daniel E K; Dalan, Rinkoo",Sci Rep,,177

490616,"A hybrid of artificial fneural network, exponential smoothing, and ARIMA models for COVID-19 time series forecasting",2021,"BACKGROUND: Behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) are associated with increased stress, burden, and depression among family caregivers of people with dementia. STAR-Caregivers Virtual Training and Follow-up (STAR-VTF) is adapted from an evidence-based, in-person program that trains family caregivers to manage BPSD. We used a human-centered design approach to obtain feedback from family caregivers about STAR-VTF. The program will be evaluated using a pragmatic randomized trial. OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to understand the needs of family caregivers for improving BPSD management and the extent to which caregivers perceived that STAR-VTF could address those needs. METHODS: Between July and September 2019, we conducted 15 semistructured interviews with family caregivers of people with dementia who receive care at Kaiser Permanente Washington in the Seattle metropolitan area. We identified participants from electronic health records, primarily based on a prescription for antipsychotic medication for the person with dementia (a proxy for caregivers dealing with BPSD). We showed caregivers low-fidelity prototypes of STAR-VTF online self-directed materials and verbally described potential design elements. We obtained caregiver feedback on these elements, focusing on their needs and preferences and perceived barriers to using STAR-VTF. We used a hybrid approach of inductive and deductive coding and aggregated codes to develop themes. RESULTS: The idea of a virtual training program for learning to manage BPSD appealed to caregivers. They said health care providers did not provide adequate education in the early disease stages about the personality and behavior symptoms that can affect people with dementia. Caregivers found it unexpected and frustrating when the person with dementia began experiencing BPSD, symptoms they felt unprepared to manage. Accordingly, caregivers expressed a strong desire for the health care organization to offer programs such as STAR-VTF much sooner. Caregivers had already put considerable effort into problem solving challenging behaviors. They anticipated deriving less value from STAR-VTF at that point. Nonetheless, many were interested in the virtual aspect of the training due to the convenience of receiving help from home and the perception that help from a virtual program would be timelier than traditional service modalities (eg, face to face). Given caregivers' limited time, they suggested dividing the STAR-VTF content into chunks to review as time permitted. Caregivers were interested in having a STAR-VTF provider for additional support in managing challenging behaviors. Caregivers reported a preference for having the same coach for the program duration. CONCLUSIONS: Caregivers we interviewed would likely accept a virtual training program such as STAR-VTF to obtain information about BPSD and receive help managing it. Family caregivers anticipated deriving more value if STAR-VTF was offered earlier in the disease course.","Ramirez, Magaly; Duran, Miriana C; Pabiniak, Chester J; Hansen, Kelly E; Kelley, Ann; Ralston, James D; McCurry, Susan M; Teri, Linda; Penfold, Robert B",JMIR Aging,,177

The spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 mediates entry into host cells, and thus is the target of neutralizing antibodies. Here, we show that adjuvanted protein immunization with soluble SARS-CoV-2 spike trimers, stabilized in prefusion conformation1, results in potent antibody responses in mice and rhesus macaques, with neutralizing antibody titers exceeding those typically measured in SARS-CoV-2 seropositive humans by more than one order of magnitude. Neutralizing antibody responses were observed after a single dose, with exceptionally high titers achieved after boosting. A follow-up to monitor waning of the neutralizing antibody responses in rhesus macaques demonstrated durable responses that were maintained at high and stable levels at least 4 months after boosting.

(2) Methods: Chi-square test and logistic regression analysis were used to explore the influence of different factors on people's behavior of mask-wearing in the present study. R3.6.2 was used for data cleaning, SPSS 26.0 was used to conduct corresponding statistical analysis, and a two-sided p-value less than 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. (3) Results: According to our study, the proportion of participants who wore face masks was higher than 90.0% in both surveys. Single factor analysis showed that the proportion of people wearing face masks raised with the increase of people's education, age, and monthly income (Yuan) in both surveys. People who lived in rural areas were less likely to wear masks. Mask-wearing rate was lower in the isolated individuals than in the non-isolated ones. (4) Conclusions: Masks-wearing is one of the effective measures for COVID-19 pandemic prevention and control. After the Chinese government made wearing face masks mandatory in public places, most residents in China had developed the habit of wearing masks, contributing to the high rate of masks-wearing in China. However, people in rural areas need to raise their awareness of wearing masks. Meanwhile, the mask-wearing of the isolated individuals needs to be enhanced.","Zhang, Ling; Zhu, Sirong; Yao, Hui; Li, Mengying; Si, Guanglin; Tan, Xiaodong",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,177

Surgical consensus guidelines are recommending caution in the use of laparoscopy for the theoretical possibility of viral transmission from aerosolization of tissue and peritoneal fluid during surgery. However, there has yet to be proof of COVID-19 being present in peritoneal fluid, justifying the consensus statements. We aim to assess the presence of COVID-19 in peritoneal fluid. METHODS: We performed a laparoscopic appendicectomy for a COVID-19-infected patient with acute appendicitis. Peritoneal fluid and peritoneal washings were collected and sent for COVID-19 PCR. RESULTS: The peritoneal fluid sample collected on entry and at the end of the operation was negative for COVID-19 on PCR. The patient had an uneventful recovery from surgery.

Most previous structural studies on S protein have been conducted at pH 8.0, but knowledge of the conformational propensities under both physiological and endosomal pH conditions is important to inform vaccine development. Our current study employed single-particle cryoelectron microscopy to visualize multiple states of open and closed conformations of S protein at physiological pH 7.4 and near-physiological pH 6.5 and pH 8.0. Propensities of open and closed conformations were found to differ with pH changes, whereby around 68% of S protein exists in open conformation at pH 7.4. Furthermore, we noticed a continuous movement in the N-terminal domain, receptor-binding domain (RBD), S2 domain, and stalk domain of S protein conformations at various pH values. Several key residues involving RBD-neutralizing epitopes are differentially exposed in each conformation. This study will assist in developing novel therapeutic measures against SARS-CoV2.","Pramanick, Ishika; Sengupta, Nayanika; Mishra, Suman; Pandey, Suman; Girish, Nidhi; Das, Alakta; Dutta, Somnath",,,177

Requirements for decreased person-to-person contacts during the COVID-19 pandemic accelerated adoption of tele-neuro-ophthalmology. This review highlights the challenges and opportunities with tele-neuro-ophthalmology. RECENT FINDINGS: Tele-neuro-ophthalmology programs can be used for triage, diagnostic consultation, and long-term treatment monitoring. Formats include telephone appointments, interprofessional collaborations, remote data interpretation, online asynchronous patient communication, and video visits. Barriers to long-term implementation of tele-neuro-ophthalmology arise from data quality, patient engagement, workflow integration, state and federal regulations, and reimbursement. General neurologists may collaborate with local eye care providers for ophthalmic examination, imaging, and testing to facilitate efficient and effective tele-neuro-ophthalmology consultation. SUMMARY: Tele-neuro-ophthalmology has tremendous potential to improve patient access to high-quality cost-effective neuro-ophthalmic care. However, many factors may impact its long-term sustainability.","Liu, Yin Allison; Ko, Melissa W; Moss, Heather E",Curr. opin. neurol,,177

We used point of care ultrasound to identify diaphragm dysfunction in a spontaneously breathing Covid-19 patient. Measurements of diaphragm thickness and thickening fraction indicated diaphragm dysfunction prior to intubation while respiratory failure was not yet evident from arterial blood gas analysis. Recovery of diaphragm contractility was demonstrated within two days of controlled mechanical ventilation when the patient was switched to a pressure support mode. With recovery of the diaphragm very large fractional shortening was seen after discontinuation of rocuronium, which was associated with a reduced dynamic compliance. In conclusion, this case report illustrates the need to be aware of potential diaphragm dysfunction in spontaneously breathing Covid-19 patients. With recovery, point of care ultrasound allows repeated evaluation of diaphragm function which appears to be responsive to changes in pumonary compliance.","van Steveninck, Alfred L; Imming, Leonie M",Respir Med Case Rep,,177

METHODS: PAP usage data in children with SDB aged 1 to 18 years old at The Hospital for Sick Children, Canada, were analyzed. The PAP usage data were recorded for 3 months prior to and 3 months following the COVID-19 lockdown in Ontario, Canada. The primary outcomes of interest were (i) percentage of days that PAP was used for &#8805; 4 h and (ii) average daily usage of PAP based on days when PAP was used. RESULTS: A total of 151 children were included. The mean (± SD) age and BMI were 12.6 ± 4.1 years and 28.7 ± 12.4 kg/m2, respectively. The median (IQR) percentage of days of PAP usage for &#8805; 4 h and average nightly PAP usage was significantly higher during compared with prior to the pandemic (76.7 [19.0-94.0] vs 62.0 [15.5-89.0]%, p = 0.02, and 406.0 [244.0-525.0] vs 367.0 [218.0-496.0] min, p = 0.006, respectively). Within this cohort, 95/151 (63%) children with SDB showed increased PAP usage and 56/151 (37%) either decreased the amount of time they used PAP or stopped PAP use altogether. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 pandemic has provided opportunities for increased PAP usage in a significant number of children with SDB. A subset of children with prior evidence for suboptimal PAP usage showed further decreases in PAP usage during the pandemic. This information is critical for clinicians to provide anticipatory guidance to encourage PAP usage both during the pandemic and beyond.","Sunkonkit, Kanokkarn; Selvadurai, Sarah; Voutsas, Giorge; Benzon, David; Baker, Adele; Trinh, Melissa; Narang, Indra",Sleep breath,,177

These variations in the virus and genetic variation in human populations can determine virus transmissibility and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) severity. Genetic variations and immune differences in human populations could be the driving forces in viral evolution. Recently emerged SARS-CoV-2 variants show several mutations at the receptor binding domain in the spike (S) glycoprotein and contribute to immune escape and enhanced binding with angiotensin 1-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Since ACE2 and transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) play important roles in SARS-CoV-2 entry into the cell, genetic variation in these host entry-related proteins may be a driving force for positive selection in the SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein. Dendritic or liver/lymph cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-3-grabbing non-integrin is also known to play vital roles in several pathogens. Genetic variations of these host proteins may affect the susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2. This review summarizes the latest research to describe the impacts of genetic variation in the viral S glycoprotein and critical host proteins and aims to provide better insights for understanding transmission and pathogenesis and more broadly for developing vaccine/antiviral drugs and precision medicine strategies, especially for high risk populations with genetic risk variants.","Huang, Szu-Wei; Wang, Sheng-Fan",Int. j. mol. sci.

METHODS: Patients with COVID-19 infection who were admitted to the hospital received CP, RDV, or combination of both. Mortality, discharge disposition, hospital length of stay (LOS), intensive care unit (ICU) LOS, and total ventilation days were compared between each treatment group and stratified by ABO blood group. An exploratory analysis identified risk factors for mortality. Adverse effects were also evaluated. RESULTS: RDV monotherapy showed an increased chance of survival compared to combination therapy or CP monotherapy (p = 0.052). There were 15, 3, and 6 deaths in the CP, RDV, and combination therapy groups, respectively. The combination therapy group had the longest median ICU LOS (8, IQR 4.5-15.5, p = 0.220) and hospital LOS (11, IQR 7-15.5, p = 0.175). Age (p = 0.036), initial SOFA score (p = 0.013), and intubation (p = 0.005) were statistically significant predictors of mortality. Patients with type O blood had decreased ventilation days, ICU LOS, and total LOS. Thirteen treatment-related adverse events occurred. CONCLUSION: No significant differences in clinical outcomes were observed between patients treated with RDV, CP, or combination therapy. Elderly patients, those with a high initial SOFA score, and those who require intubation are at increased risk of mortality associated with COVID-19. Blood type did not affect clinical outcomes.","Padilla, Regine; Arquiette, Jered; Mai, Yvonne; Singh, Gurinder; Galang, Kristine; Liang, Edward",J Pharm Pharm Sci,,177
511257,Exploring the use of Artificial Intelligence techniques to detect the presence of Coronavirus Covid-19 through speech and voice analysis,2021,"With the potentially fatal effect of COVID-19 and its devastating impact on economies worldwide, some environmental scientist has suggested the use of waste from household sewage to trace the movement of SARS-CoV-2, within a given country. However, this approach is not without challenges where developing countries lack proper and adequate hygiene and sanitation, resulting in widespread defecation. Limited scientific research has been done to determine how many times a recently infected person can defecate and the quantification of SARS-CoV-2 found in a single expel. On the other hand, there is no detailed research to specify where the heavy viral load of SARS-CoV-2 can be found in human excreta. In this paper, we present some obstacles that this approach could face in the absence of an intense lockdown in developing nations such as sub-Saharan countries. To achieve this, we identify some research needs that will strengthen our understanding of the transmission, occurrence, and persistence of SARS-CoV-2 in sewage and wastewater, including the life-span that depends on temperature. A methodology to follow in the process of identifying a hotspot on a small scale using some mathematical distributions, including the normal distribution, log-normal distribution, and the most complex one known as Blancmange function, was presented with some examples. Our investigation showed that this method might have some challenges, especially in developing countries (sub-Sahara countries) where open latrine usage is very high. Some recommendations we suggested to ensure the efficiency of such a method on a small scale. However, in general, it is essential to note the extraction/detection method will not help more than the testing method used all over the world to trace SARS-CoV-2 -19 in humans.","Atangana, Ernestine; Oberholster, Paul J; Turton, Anthony R",Chemosphere,,177

511875,Stakeholders’ Perceptions of the Possible Energy Sustainability Solutions in the Hotels of the Canary Islands,2021,"Voltage-gated potassium channels are integral membrane proteins selectively permeable for potassium ions and activated upon change of membrane potential. Voltage-gated potassium channels of the Kv1.3 type were discovered both in plasma membrane and in inner mitochondrial membrane (mito Kv1.3 channels). For some time Kv1.3 channels located both in plasma membrane and in mitochondria are considered as a potentially new molecular target in several pathologies including some cancer disorders. Lipophilic non-toxic organic inhibitors of Kv1.3 channels may potentially find a clinical application to support therapy of some cancer diseases such as breast, pancreas and lung cancer, melanoma or chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (B-CLL). Inhibition of T lymphocyte Kv1.3 channels may be also important in treatment of chronic and acute respiratory diseases including severe pulmonary complication in corona virus disease Covid 19, however further studies are needed to confirm this supposition. Statins are small-molecule organic compounds, which are lipophilic and are widely used in treatment of hypercholesterolemia and atherosclerosis. Electrophysiological studies performed in our laboratory showed that statins: pravastatin, mevastatin and simvastatin are effective inhibitors of Kv1.3 channels in cancer cells of human T cell line Jurkat. We showed that application of the statins in the concentration range from 1.5 µM to 50 µM inhibited the channels in a concentration-dependent manner. The inhibitory effect was the most potent in case of simvastatin and the least potent in case of pravastatin. The inhibition was partially irreversible in case of simvastatin and fully reversible in case of pravastatin and mevastatin. It was accompanied by a significant acceleration of the current inactivation rate without any significant change of the activation rate. Mechanism of the inhibition is probably complex, including a direct interaction with the channel protein and perturbation of lipid bilayer structure, leading to stabilisation of the inactivated state of the channels.","Teisseyre, Andrzej; Uryga, Anna; Michalak, Krystyna",J Mol Struct,,177

512599,Dynamic pricing with demand disaggregation for hotel revenue management,2021,"INTRODUCTION: Portable chest radiography through glass (TG-CXR) is a novel technique, particularly useful during the COVID-19 (Coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic. The purpose of this study was to understand the cost and benefit of adopting TG-CXR in quantifiable terms. METHODS: Portable or bedside radiographs are typically performed by a team of two technologists. The TG-CXR method has the benefit of allowing one technologist to stay outside of the patient room while operating the portable radiography machine, reducing PPE use, decreasing the frequency of radiography machine sanitization and decreasing technologists' exposures to potentially infectious patients. The cost of implementing this technique during the current COVID-19 pandemic was obtained from our department's operational database. The direct cost of routinely used PPE and sanitization materials and the cost of the time taken by the technologists to clean the machine was used to form a quantitative picture of the benefit associated with TG-CXR technique. RESULTS: Technologists were trained on the TG-CXR method during a 15 min shift change briefing. This translated to a one-time cost of $424.88 USD. There was an average reduction of portable radiography machine downtime of 4 min and 48 s per study. The benefit of adopting the TG-CXR technique was $9.87 USD per patient imaged. This will result in a projected net cost savings of $51,451.84 USD per annum. CONCLUSION: Adoption of the TG-CXR technique during the COVID-19 pandemic involved minimal one-time cost, but is projected to result in a net-benefit of over $51,000 USD per annum in our emergency department.","Liu, Tian Yang; Rai, Archana; Ditkofsky, Noah; Deva, Djeven P; Dowdell, Timothy R; Ackery, Alun Duncan; Mathur, Shobhit",J Med Imaging Radiat Sci,,177

521111,Service Work in the Pandemic Economy,2021,"The diagnosis of coronavirus 19 (COVID-19) relies mainly upon viral nucleic acid detection, but false negatives can lead to missed diagnosis and misdiagnosis; severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-specific antibody detection is convenient, safe and highly sensitive. Immunoglobulin (Ig)M and IgG are commonly used to serologically diagnose COVID-19; however, the role of IgA is not well known. We aimed to quantify the levels of SARS-CoV-2-specific IgM, IgA and IgG antibodies, identify changes in them based on COVID-19 severity, and establish the significance of combined antibody detection. COVID-19 patients, divided into a severe and critical group and a moderate group, and non-COVID-19 patients with respiratory disease were included in this study. A chemiluminescence method was used to detect the levels of SARS-CoV-2-specific IgM, IgA and IgG in the blood samples from the three groups. Epidemiological characteristics, symptoms, blood test results and other data were recorded for all patients. Compared to the traditional IgM-IgG combined antibodies, IgA-IgG combined antibodies are more effective for diagnosing COVID-19. During the disease process, IgA appeared first and disappeared last. All three antibodies had significantly higher levels in COVID-19 patients than in non-COVID-19 patients. IgA and IgG were also higher for severe and critical disease than for moderate disease. All antibodies were at or near low levels at the time of tracheal extubation in critical patients. Detection of SARS-CoV-2-specific combined IgA-IgG antibodies is advantageous in diagnosing COVID-19. IgA detection is suitable during early and late stages of the disease. IgA and IgG levels correspond to disease severity.","Huang, Z; Chen, H; Xue, M; Huang, H; Zheng, P; Luo, W; Liang, X; Sun, B; Zhong, N",Clin. exp. immunol,,177

The risk of getting an infection with COVID-19 might impact the emotional well-being in patients with cancer. The aim of this study was to investigate quality of life (QoL) for patients with cancer during the COVID-19 pandemic. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional survey, including questions about demographics, concerns of COVID-19 impact on cancer treatment and outpatient clinic visits, and the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) QLQ-C30 questionnaire was sent to patients with cancer at the Department of Oncology, Odense University Hospital, Denmark. The survey was open from 15th May to 29th May 2020, and 4.571 responded. Results were compared to the Danish 'Barometer Study' conducted by the Danish Cancer Society to elucidate experiences with the Danish healthcare system prior to COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: In total, 9% of patients with cancer had refrained from consulting a doctor or the hospital due to fear of COVID-19 infection, and 80% were concerned about contracting COVID-19 to some extent. Seventeen patients were tested positive for COVID-19. The mean global QoL and emotional functioning (EF) scores were 71.3 and 82.8, respectively. In comparison to the 'Barometer Study', no clinical significant differences in QoL and EF scores were observed. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that being 'Concerned about contracting corona-virus' was correlated with lower QoL and EF scores. Factors associated with being concerned of contracting COVID-19 were comorbid conditions, incurable cancer, receiving medical cancer treatment and female gender. CONCLUSION: Danish patients with cancer during the COVID-19 pandemic did not have lower scores of QoL and emotional functioning compared to the Danish 'Barometer Study'. However, the study suggests that concerns of contracting COVID-19 was correlated with lower scores of QoL.","Jeppesen, Stefan S; Bentsen, Kristian K; Jørgensen, Trine L; Holm, Hanne S; Holst-Christensen, Linda; Tarpgaard, Line S; Dahlrot, Rikke H; Eckhoff, Lise",Acta Oncol,,177
521288,Juxtaposing inference capabilities of deep neural models over posteroanterior chest radiographs facilitating COVID-19 detection,2021,"The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, has caused 60 millions of infections and 1.38 millions of fatalities. Genomic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 can provide insights on drug design and vaccine development for controlling the pandemic. Inverted repeats in a genome greatly impact the stability of the genome structure and regulate gene expression. Inverted repeats involve cellular evolution and genetic diversity, genome arrangements, and diseases. Here, we investigate the inverted repeats in the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 genome. We found that SARS-CoV-2 genome has an abundance of inverted repeats. The inverted repeats are mainly located in the gene of the Spike protein. This result suggests the Spike protein gene undergoes recombination events, therefore, is essential for fast evolution. Comparison of the inverted repeat signatures in human and bat coronaviruses suggest that SARS-CoV-2 is mostly related SARS-related coronavirus, SARSr-CoV/RaTG13. The study also reveals that the recent SARS-related coronavirus, SARSr-CoV/RmYN02, has a high amount of inverted repeats in the spike protein gene. Besides, this study demonstrates that the inverted repeat distribution in a genome can be considered as the genomic signature. This study highlights the significance of inverted repeats in the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 and presents the inverted repeats as the genomic signature in genome analysis.","Yin, Changchuan; Yau, Stephen S.-T.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.12350v1.pdf,177
521467,A new retrofitting strategy for the improvement of Indoor Environment Quality and Energy Efficiency in residential buildings in temperate climate using prefabricated elements,2021,"BACKGROUND: With the effective prevention and control of COVID-19 in China, the number of cured cases has increased significantly. Further monitoring of the disease prognosis and effective control of the ""relapse"" of the epidemic has become the next focus of work. This study analysed the clinical prognosis of discharged COVID-19 patients by monitoring their SAR-CoV-2 nucleic acid status, which provided a theoretical basis for medical institutions to formulate discharge standards and follow-up management for COVID-19 patients. METHODS: We included 13 discharged COVID-19 patients who were quarantined for 4 weeks at home. The patient's daily clinical signs were recorded and sputum and faecal specimens were regularly sent for detection of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid. RESULTS: The time between initial symptoms and meeting discharge criteria was 18 to 44 days with an average of 25 ± 6 days. The faecal samples of two patients still tested positive after meeting the discharge criteria and the sputum samples of four patients returned positive 5 to 14 days after discharge. The rate of the recurring positive test result in samples from the respiratory system was 31% (4/13). CONCLUSION: Under the present discharge criteria, the high presence of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid in faecal and respiratory samples of discharged COVID-19 patients indicates potential infectivity. Therefore, we suggest that faecal virus nucleic acid should be tested as a routine monitoring index for COVID-19 and a negative result be added to the criteria. Simultaneously, we should strengthen the regular follow-up of discharged patients with continuous monitoring of the recurrence of viral nucleic acid.","Li, Youjiang; Hu, Yingying; Yu, Yuanyuan; Zhang, Xiaodong; Li, Bin; Wu, Jianguo; Li, Junyu; Wu, Yingping; Xia, Xiaoping; Tang, Huina; Xu, Jian",J. med. virol,,177

METHODS: Gil Medical Center, a tertiary hospital in Incheon, has operated a special response team since January 21, 2020. All visitors were assessed for body temperature and respiratory symptoms, and screened for recent overseas travel. Suspected COVID-19 patients were taken to a screening clinic. All febrile patients with or without respiratory symptoms were taken to a respiratory safety clinic. An isolation ward, which consisted of 10 negative-pressure rooms, was used to treat confirmed cases. More than 120 beds were prepared for the outbreak, and patients with pneumonia were preemptively isolated. RESULTS: By May 5, 480 960 visitors were assessed at the control station, 3350 patients visited the triage center, and 1794 were treated in the respiratory safety clinic. Seventeen confirmed cases were admitted to the negative isolation ward, and 350 patients with pneumonia were preemptively isolated. A total of 2977 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) polymerase chain reaction tests were performed. CONCLUSIONS: While tertiary hospitals play an important role in treating both COVID-19 patients and non-COVID-19 patients, hospital staff have to protect themselves from unexpected in-hospital transmission. A multifaceted response must be undertaken to protect tertiary hospitals and their staff during the COVID-19 epidemic.","Shi, Hye Jin; Lee, Jae Back; Choi, Min Kyung; Jang, Young-Rock; Cho, Yong-Kyun; Eom, Joong Sik",Disaster Med Public Health Prep,,177

This concept has prevailed in clinical practice for more than a century. However, a new technologic era has brought forth more diagnostic possibilities, and it has been shown that thrombotic masses in the PA could, in many cases, be found without any obvious source of emboli. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, sickle cell anemia, emergency and elective surgery, viral pneumonia, and other conditions could be complicated by PA thrombosis development without concomitant deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Different pathologies have different causes for local PA thrombotic process. As evidenced by experimental results and clinical observations, endothelial and platelet activation are the crucial mechanisms of this process. Endothelial dysfunction can impair antithrombotic function of the arterial wall through downregulation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) or via stimulation of adhesion receptor expression. Hypoxia, proinflammatory cytokines, or genetic mutations may underlie the procoagulant phenotype of the PA endothelium. Both endotheliocytes and platelets could be activated by protease mediated receptor (PAR)- and receptors for advanced glycation end (RAGE)-dependent mechanisms. Hypoxia, in particular induced by high altitudes, could play a role in thrombotic complications as a trigger of platelet activity. In this review, we discuss potential mechanisms of PA thrombosis in situ.","Porembskaya, Olga; Toropova, Yana; Tomson, Vladimir; Lobastov, Kirill; Laberko, Leonid; Kravchuk, Viacheslav; Saiganov, Sergey; Brill, Alexander",Int J Mol Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32708482/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms21145086,177

Recent pandemics, such as coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19), include increasing demands for ubiquitous, preventive, and personalized health care to be provided to the public at reduced risks and costs with rapid care. Mobile crowdsourcing could potentially meet the future massive health care IoT (mH-IoT) demands by enabling anytime, anywhere sense and analyses of health-related data to tackle such a pandemic situation. However, data reliability and availability are among the many challenges for the realization of next-generation mH-IoT, especially in COVID-19 epidemics. Therefore, more intelligent and robust health care frameworks are required to tackle such pandemics. Recently, reinforcement learning (RL) has proven its strengths to provide intelligent data reliability and availability. The action-state learning procedure of RL-based frameworks enables the learning system to enhance the optimal use of the information as the time passes and data increases. In this article, we propose an RL-based crowd-to-machine (RLC2M) framework for mH-IoT, which leverages crowdsourcing and an RL model (Q-learning) to address the health care information processing challenges. The simulation results show that the proposed framework rapidly converges with accumulated rewards to reveal the sensing environment situation.","Almagrabi, Alaa Omran; Ali, Rashid; Alghazzawi, Daniyal; AlBarakati, Abdullah; Khurshaid, Tahir",Big data,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34319812/; https://doi.org/10.1089/big.2021.0058,177

This paper describes the rationale and methods of expanding the EBS strategy for Aedes aegypti control in Fortaleza, Northeast Brazil. A cluster, non-randomized controlled clinical trial was developed to analyze the strategy’s effectiveness in vulnerable territories (high incidence of dengue and violent deaths; low HDI; substandard urban infrastructure, high population density, and water scarcity). We selected two intervention and two control groups, resulting in a sample of approximately 16,000 properties. The intervention consisted of environmental management by sealing large elevated water tanks, introduction of beta fish in waterholes, elimination of potential breeding sites, and mobilization and training of schoolchildren, endemic disease workers, health workers, social mobilizers, and community leaders; community surveillance of arboviruses; construction and validation of a booklet for the prevention of arboviruses in pregnant women. We analyzed the costs of arboviruses to government and households, the intervention cost-effectiveness, chikungunya’s chronicity, and acceptance, sustainability, and governance of vector control actions. The primary outcome (infestation) was analyzed using the house, container, and Breteau indices.

599118,Viral Contamination of Food,2016-02-05,"SIMPLE SUMMARY: There is limited information on the safety and efficacy of approved SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in cancer patients, as they were excluded from registration vaccine trials. We investigated the humoral immunity post SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in cancer patients compared to healthy volunteers. In this prospective cohort study, the seropositivity rate after two doses of vaccine was high in cancer patients despite active antineoplastic treatment, but their antibody titers were significantly lower than in healthy control subjects. Factors affecting immunogenicity in cancer patients, included older age, poor PS, active treatment, certain cancer types, i.e., pancreatic cancer and SCLC, male gender, and, interestingly, smoking status. Our results suggest that, given the lower immunogenicity, adjustments in vaccination strategies for more vulnerable subgroups of cancer patients may be required. Monitoring of antibody responses and elucidation of the clinical factors that influence immunity could guide future vaccination policies. ABSTRACT: Data on the effectiveness and safety of approved SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in cancer patients are limited. This observational, prospective cohort study investigated the humoral immune response to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in 232 cancer patients from 12 HeCOG-affiliated oncology departments compared to 100 healthcare volunteers without known active cancer. The seropositivity rate was measured 2–4 weeks after two vaccine doses, by evaluating neutralising antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein using a commercially available immunoassay. Seropositivity was defined as ≥33.8 Binding-Antibody-Units (BAU)/mL. A total of 189 patients and 99 controls were eligible for this analysis. Among patients, 171 (90.5%) were seropositive after two vaccine doses, compared to 98% of controls (p = 0.015). Most seronegative patients were males (66.7%), >70-years-old (55.5%), with comorbidities (61.1%), and on active treatment (88.9%). The median antibody titers among patients were significantly lower than those of the controls (523 vs. 2050 BAU/mL; p < 0.001). The rate of protective titers was 54.5% in patients vs. 97% in controls (p < 0.001). Seropositivity rates and IgG titers in controls did not differ for any studied factor. In cancer patients, higher antibody titers were observed in never-smokers (p = 0.006), women (p = 0.022), <50-year-olds (p = 0.004), PS 0 (p = 0.029), and in breast or ovarian vs. other cancers. Adverse events were comparable to registration trials. In this cohort study, although the seropositivity rate after two vaccine doses in cancer patients seemed satisfactory, their antibody titers were significantly lower than in controls. Monitoring of responses and further elucidation of the clinical factors that affect immunity could guide adaptations of vaccine strategies for vulnerable subgroups.","Linardou, Helena; Spanakis, Nikolaos; Koliou, Georgia-Angeliki; Christopoulou, Athina; Karageorgopoulou, Sofia; Alevra, Nephely; Vagionas, Anastasios; Tsoukalas, Nikolaos; Sgourou, Stavroula; Fountzilas, Elena; Sgouros, Joseph; Razis, Evangelia; Chatzokou, Dimitra; Lampaki, Sofia; Res, Eleni; Saridaki, Zacharenia; Mountzios, Giannis; Saroglou, George; Fountzilas, George",Cancers (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34572848/; https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers13184621,177

DESIGN: Prospective outbreak investigation with active case finding and molecular typing. SETTING: A large academic geriatric hospital in Switzerland. PARTICIPANTS: Elderly hospitalized adults. MEASUREMENTS: Based on syndromic surveillance, a nosocomial influenza outbreak was suspected in February 2012. All suspected cases were screened for respiratory viruses using real‐time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction of nasopharyngeal swabs. Infection control procedures (droplet precautions with single room isolation whenever possible) were implemented for all suspected or confirmed cases. Specimens positive for influenza viruses were processed and sequenced whenever possible to track transmission dynamics. RESULTS: Respiratory samples from 155 suspected cases were analyzed during the outbreak period, of which 69 (44%) were positive for influenza virus, 26 (17%) were positive for other respiratory viruses, and 60 (39%) were negative. Three other cases fulfilled clinical criteria for influenza infection but were not sampled, and one individual was admitted with an already positive test, resulting in a total of 73 influenza cases, of which 62 (85%) were classified as nosocomial. Five distinct clusters of nosocomial transmission were identified using viral sequencing, with epidemiologically unexpected in‐hospital transmission dynamics. Seven of 23 patients who experienced influenza complications died. Sixteen healthcare workers experienced an influenza‐like illness (overall vaccination rate, 36%). CONCLUSION: Nosocomial influenza transmission caused more secondary cases than repeated community importation during this polyclonal outbreak. Molecular tools revealed complex transmission dynamics. Low healthcare worker vaccination rates and gaps in recommended infection control procedures are likely to have contributed to nosocomial spread of influenza, which remains a potentially life‐threatening disease in elderly adults.","Pagani, Leonardo; Thomas, Yves; Huttner, Benedikt; Sauvan, Valérie; Notaridis, Grigorios; Kaiser, Laurent; Iten, Anne; Pittet, Didier; Harbarth, Stephan",J Am Geriatr Soc,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25900487/; https://doi.org/10.1111/jgs.13339,177

Therefore, development of effective prophylactic vaccine needs to be urgently explored given that there are no approved prophylactics or therapeutics for humans or animals to date. Different vaccine candidates have been investigated but serious safety concerns remain over protein or full-length spike (S) protein-based vaccines. Here, we investigated the immunogenicity of naked DNA vaccines expressing different fragments of MERS-CoV S protein in mice. We found that plasmids expressing full-length (pS) or S1-subunit (pS1) could induce significant levels of S1-specific antibodies (Abs) but with distinct IgG isotype patterns. Specifically, pS1 immunization elicited a balanced Th1/Th2 response and generally higher levels of all IgG isotypes compared to pS vaccination. Interestingly, only mice immunized with pS1 demonstrated significant S1-specific cellular immune response. Importantly, both constructs induced cross-neutralizing Abs against multiple strains of human and camel origins. These results indicate that vaccines expressing S1-subunit of the MERS-CoV S protein could represent a potential vaccine candidate without the possible safety concerns associated with full-length protein-based vaccines.","Al-amri, Sawsan S.; Abbas, Ayman T.; Siddiq, Loai A.; Alghamdi, Abrar; Sanki, Mohammad A.; Al-Muhanna, Muhanna K.; Alhabbab, Rowa Y.; Azhar, Esam I.; Li, Xuguang; Hashem, Anwar M.",Sci Rep,https://doi.org/10.1038/srep44875; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28332568/,177

Due to the impact of this pandemic, the economy and healthcare have immensely suffered around the globe. Thus, an efficient vaccine design is the need of the hour. Moreover, to have a generalised vaccine for heterogeneous human population, the virus genomes from different countries should be considered. Thus, in this work, we have performed genome-wide analysis of 10,664 SARS-CoV-2 genomes of 73 countries around the globe in order to identify the potential conserved regions for the development of peptide based synthetic vaccine viz. epitopes with high immunogenic and antigenic scores. In this regard, multiple sequence alignment technique viz. Clustal Omega is used to align the 10,664 SARS-CoV-2 virus genomes. Thereafter, entropy is computed for each genomic coordinate of the aligned genomes. The entropy values are then used to find the conserved regions. These conserved regions are refined based on the criteria that their lengths should be greater than or equal to 60 nt and their corresponding protein sequences are without any stop codons. Furthermore, Nucleotide BLAST is used to verify the specificity of the conserved regions. As a result, we have obtained 17 conserved regions that belong to NSP3, NSP4, NSP6, NSP8, RdRp, Helicase, endoRNAse, 2’-O-RMT, Spike glycoprotein, ORF3a protein, Membrane glycoprotein and Nucleocapsid protein. Finally, these conserved regions are used to identify the T-cell and B-cell epitopes with their corresponding immunogenic and antigenic scores. Based on these scores, the most immunogenic and antigenic epitopes are then selected for each of these 17 conserved regions. Hence, we have obtained 30 MHC-I and 24 MHC-II restricted T-cell epitopes with 14 and 13 unique HLA alleles and 21 B-cell epitopes for the 17 conserved regions. Moreover, for validating the relevance of these epitopes, the binding conformation of the MHC-I and MHC-II restricted T-cell epitopes are shown with respect to HLA alleles. Also, the physico-chemical properties of the epitopes are reported along with Ramchandran plots and Z-Scores and the population coverage is shown as well. Overall, the analysis shows that the identified epitopes can be considered as potential candidates for vaccine design.","Ghosh, Nimisha; Sharma, Nikhil; Saha, Indrajit",Infect Genet Evol,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567134821001209?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33819681/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2021.104823; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1567134821001209,177
603115,Dependence and precarity in the platform economy,2020-08-07,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative agent of the COVID-19 pandemic. Computer simulations of complete viral particles can provide theoretical insights into large-scale viral processes including assembly, budding, egress, entry, and fusion. Detailed atomistic simulations, however, are constrained to shorter timescales and require billion-atom simulations for these processes. Here, we report the current status and on-going development of a largely “bottom-up” coarse-grained (CG) model of the SARS-CoV-2 virion. Structural data from a combination of cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), x-ray crystallography, and computational predictions were used to build molecular models of structural SARS-CoV-2 proteins, which were then assembled into a complete virion model. We describe how CG molecular interactions can be derived from all-atom simulations, how viral behavior difficult to capture in atomistic simulations can be incorporated into the CG models, and how the CG models can be iteratively improved as new data becomes publicly available. Our initial CG model and the detailed methods presented are intended to serve as a resource for researchers working on COVID-19 who are interested in performing multiscale simulations of the SARS-CoV-2 virion. Significance Statement This study reports the construction of a molecular model for the SARS-CoV-2 virion and details our multiscale approach towards model refinement. The resulting model and methods can be applied to and enable the simulation of SARS-CoV-2 virions.","Yu, Alvin; Pak, Alexander J.; He, Peng; Monje-Galvan, Viviana; Casalino, Lorenzo; Gaieb, Zied; Dommer, Abigail C.; Amaro, Rommie E.; Voth, Gregory A.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.10.02.323915; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33024966/,177

Small intestinal inflammation is considered a central event in the pathogenesis of TGEV infections, and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) is a key transcription factor in the inflammatory response. However, it is unclear whether NF-κB is crucial for inducing inflammation during a TGEV infection. Our results show that NF-κB was activated in swine testicular (ST) cells and intestinal epithelial cell lines J2 (IPEC-J2) cells infected with TGEV, which is consistent with the up-regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Treatment of TGEV-infected ST cells and IPEC-J2 cells with the NF-κB-specific inhibitor caused the down-regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokine expression, but did not significantly affect TGEV replication. Individual TGEV protein screening results demonstrated that Nsp2 exhibited a high potential for activating NF-κB and enhancing the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Functional domain analyzes indicated that the first 120 amino acid residues of Nsp2 were essential for NF-κB activation. Taken together, these data suggested that NF-κB activation was a major contributor to TGEV infection-induced inflammation, and that Nsp2 was the key viral protein involved in the regulation of inflammation, with amino acids 1–120 playing a critical role in activating NF-κB.

Since the present generation of students spends a lot of time on social media, especially WhatsApp, the utility of the same to discuss the various public health domains of COVID-19 through multiple-choice questions (MCQs) was explored. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This longitudinal study was conducted among 154 participants (undergraduates, interns, postgraduates, and teaching faculty) for 3 months. MCQs on COVID-19 were disseminated through WhatsApp status of the investigator, and feedback regarding the same was taken at the end of 3 months. The activity log was maintained, and the information was downloaded as a comma-separated value (CSV) file and exported to MS Excel. Descriptive statistics were applied. The location of the participants was entered into the Microsoft Excel sheet and converted into CSV file. The Geographical data were analyzed in the Quantum Geographical information System (QGIS). RESULTS: Among the 154 study participants, 48% were undergraduates, 10.4% were interns, 30.6% were postgraduates, and 11% were teaching faculty. Eighty-nine percent of the participants felt that WhatsApp can be used as a platform for discussing MCQs. 89%, 93%, and 89.6% of the participants felt that the exercise improved their analytical skills, helped in self-directed learning, and improved collaborative learning, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Majority of the participants responded that WhatsApp can be used as a platform to discuss MCQs and that the exercise helped in collaborative and self-directed learning.","Doddaiah, Sunil Kumar; Kulkarni, Praveen; Mohandas, Aparna; Murthy, M.

Deep learning-based methods have been demonstrated powerful on predicting RBP sites on RNAs. However, the training of deep learning models is very time-intensive and computationally intensive. RESULTS: Here we present a deep learning-based RBPsuite, an easy-to-use webserver for predicting RBP binding sites on linear and circular RNAs. For linear RNAs, RBPsuite predicts the RBP binding scores with them using our updated iDeepS. For circular RNAs (circRNAs), RBPsuite predicts the RBP binding scores with them using our developed CRIP. RBPsuite first breaks the input RNA sequence into segments of 101 nucleotides and scores the interaction between the segments and the RBPs. RBPsuite further detects the verified motifs on the binding segments gives the binding scores distribution along the full-length sequence.

We analysed sociodemographic factors associated with higher likelihood of SARS-CoV-2 infection and explore mediating pathways for race and ethnic disparities in the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. METHODS: This is a cross-sectional analysis of the COVID-19 Surveillance and Outcomes Registry, which captures data for a large healthcare system, comprising one central tertiary care hospital, seven large community hospitals and an expansive ambulatory/emergency care network in the Greater Houston area. Nasopharyngeal samples for individuals inclusive of all ages, races, ethnicities and sex were tested for SARS-CoV-2. We analysed sociodemographic (age, sex, race, ethnicity, household income, residence population density) and comorbidity (Charlson Comorbidity Index, hypertension, diabetes, obesity) factors. Multivariable logistic regression models were fitted to provide adjusted OR (aOR) and 95% CI for likelihood of a positive SARS-CoV-2 test. Structural equation modelling (SEM) framework was used to explore three mediation pathways (low income, high population density, high comorbidity burden) for the association between non-Hispanic black (NHB) race, Hispanic ethnicity and SARS-CoV-2 infection. RESULTS: Among 20 228 tested individuals, 1551 (7.7%) tested positive. The overall mean (SD) age was 51.1 (19.0) years, 62% were females, 22% were black and 18% were Hispanic. NHB and Hispanic ethnicity were associated with lower socioeconomic status and higher population density residence. In the fully adjusted model, NHB (vs non-Hispanic white; aOR, 2.23, CI 1.90 to 2.60) and Hispanic ethnicity (vs non-Hispanic; aOR, 1.95, CI 1.72 to 2.20) had a higher likelihood of infection. Older individuals and males were also at higher risk of infection. The SEM framework demonstrated a significant indirect effect of NHB and Hispanic ethnicity on SARS-CoV-2 infection mediated via a pathway including residence in densely populated zip code. CONCLUSIONS: There is strong evidence of race and ethnic disparities in the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic that are potentially mediated through unique social determinants of health.","Vahidy, Farhaan S; Nicolas, Juan Carlos; Meeks, Jennifer R; Khan, Osman; Pan, Alan; Jones, Stephen L; Masud, Faisal; Sostman, H Dirk; Phillips, Robert; Andrieni, Julia D; Kash, Bita A; Nasir, Khurram",BMJ Open,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32784264/; https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-039849,177

Infections are initiated by the transmembrane spike (S) glycoprotein, which binds to host receptors and fuses the viral and cellular membranes. To understand the molecular basis of coronavirus attachment to oligosaccharide receptors, we determined cryo-EM structures of coronavirus OC43 S glycoprotein trimer in isolation and in complex with a 9-O-acetylated sialic acid. We demonstrate that the ligand binds with fast kinetics to a surface-exposed groove and interactions at the identified site are essential for S-mediated viral entry into host cells, but free monosaccharide did not trigger fusogenic conformational changes. The receptor-interacting site is conserved in all coronavirus S glycoproteins that engage 9-O-acetyl-sialogycans, with an architecture similar to the ligand-binding pockets of coronavirus hemagglutinin esterases and influenza virus C/D hemagglutinin-esterase-fusion glycoproteins.

During the current COVID-19 pandemic, physicians in emergency rooms (ER) of many hospitals have a considerably higher patient load and need to decide within a short time frame whom to hospitalize. Based on our clinical experiences in dealing with COVID-19 patients at the University Hospital Zurich, we created a triage score with the acronym AIFELL consisting of clinical, radiological and laboratory findings. The score was then evaluated in a retrospective analysis of 122 consecutive patients with suspected COVID-19 from March until mid-April 2020. Descriptive statistics, Student's t-test, ANOVA and Scheffe's post hoc analysis confirmed the diagnostic power of the score.

COVID‐19 patients with myocardial injury might need special attention. However, an understanding on this aspect remains unclear. This study aimed to illustrate clinical characteristics and the prognostic value of myocardial injury to COVID‐19 patients. METHODS: This retrospective, single‐center study finally included 304 hospitalized COVID‐19 cases confirmed by real‐time reverse‐transcriptase polymerase chain reaction from January 11 to March 25, 2020. Myocardial injury was determined by serum high‐sensitivity troponin I (Hs‐TnI). The primary endpoint was COVID‐19‐associated mortality. RESULTS: Of 304 COVID‐19 patients (median age, 65 years; 52.6% males), 88 patients (27.3%) died (61 patients with myocardial injury, 27 patients without myocardial injury on admission). COVID‐19 patients with myocardial injury had more comorbidities (hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cardiovascular disease, and cerebrovascular disease); lower lymphocyte counts, higher C‐reactive protein (CRP; median, 84.9 vs. 28.5 mg/L; p < .001), procalcitonin levels (median, 0.29 vs. 0.06 ng/ml; p < .001), inflammatory and immune response markers; more frequent need for noninvasive ventilation, invasive mechanical ventilation; and was associated with higher mortality incidence (hazard ratio [HR] = 7.02; 95% confidence interval [CI], 4.45–11.08; p < .001) than those without myocardial injury. Myocardial injury (HR = 4.55; 95% CI, 2.49–8.31; p < .001), senior age, CRP levels, and novel coronavirus pneumonia types on admission were independent predictors to mortality in COVID‐19 patients. CONCLUSIONS: COVID‐19 patients with myocardial injury on admission is associated with more severe clinical presentation and biomarkers.

Crystal data reveals that Au (I), released from Au22Glutathione18 (GA), covalently binds thiolate of Cys145 of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. GA directly decreases SARS-CoV-2 viral replication (EC50: ~0.24 μM) and intrinsically down-regulates NFκB pathway therefore significantly inhibiting expression of inflammatory cytokines in cells. The lung viral load and inflammatory cytokines in GA-treated COVID-19 transgenic mice are found to be significantly lower than that of control mice. When COVID-19 golden hamsters are treated by GA, the lung inflammatory cytokines levels are significantly lower than that of Remdesivir while their lung viral load are decreased to same level. The pathological results show that GA treatment significantly reduce lung inflammatory injuries when compared to that of Remdesivir-treated COVID-19 golden hamsters.

609759,A Light CNN for detecting COVID-19 from CT scans of the chest,2020-10-03,"In this work, we present the design and synthesis of novel fully synthetic analogues of the bisbenzylisoquinoline tetrandrine, a molecule with numerous pharmacological properties and the potential to treat life-threatening diseases, such as viral infections and cancer. Its toxicity to liver and lungs and the underlying mechanisms, however, are controversially discussed. Along this line, novel tetrandrine analogues were synthesized and biologically evaluated for their hepatotoxicity, as well as their antiproliferative and chemoresistance reversing activity on cancer cells. Previous studies suggesting CYP-mediated toxification of tetrandrine prompted us to amend/replace the suspected metabolically instable 12-methoxy group. Of note, employing several in vitro models showed that the proposed CYP3A4-driven metabolism of tetrandrine and analogues is not the major cause of hepatotoxicity. Biological characterization revealed that some of the novel tetrandrine analogues sensitized drug-resistant leukemia cells by inhibition of the P-glycoprotein. Interestingly, direct anticancer effects improved in comparison to tetrandrine, as several compounds displayed a markedly enhanced ability to reduce proliferation of drug-resistant leukemia cells and to induce cell death of liver cancer cells. Those enhanced anticancer properties were linked to influences on activation of the kinase Akt and mitochondrial events. In sum, our study clarifies the role of CYP3A4-mediated toxicity of the bisbenzylisoquinoline alkaloid tetrandrine and provides the basis for the exploitation of novel synthetic analogues for their antitumoral potential.","Schütz, Ramona; Müller, Martin; Geisslinger, Franz; Vollmar, Angelika; Bartel, Karin; Bracher, Franz",Eur J Med Chem,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0223523420307820?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0223523420307820; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32942071/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejmech.2020.112810,177

Diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) is the histopathological pattern commonly described in all the postmortem series up to date. DAD is divided into two phases, and depending on the length of the disease, the morphological features seen in the specimens vary. There is an acute/exudative phase, which occurs during the first week after the pulmonary injury, following by the organizing/proliferative phase. Additional features detailed include vascular thrombosis, endothelialitis and angiogenesis.

In the core is the need to broaden the perspective on the determinants of a country’s ability to cope with the spread of the virus. This paper is about bringing together diverse aspects of readiness and initial reaction to a COVID-19 outbreak. We proposed an integrated evaluation framework which encapsulates six dimensions of readiness and initial reaction. Using a specific multi-level outranking method, we analysed how these dimensions affect the relative positioning of European countries in the early stages of the COVID-19 outbreak. The results revealed that the order of countries based on our six-dimensional assessment framework is significantly reminiscent of the actual positioning of countries in terms of COVID-19 morbidity and mortality in the initial phase of the pandemic. Our findings confirm that only when a country’s readiness is complemented by an appropriate societal reaction we can expect a less severe outcome.

However, increasing sectors of the population have expressed hesitancy about participating in such programs, leading to the re-emergence of vaccine preventable diseases. In this study we rely on a recreancy hypothesis to test the association between confidence in the government and local hospitals and the willingness to take the vaccine. METHODS: A secondary analysis of a survey that used a large sample of the U.S. population conducted in October 2009 was used (N = 968). RESULTS: The results indicate that 36.1% of the respondents expressed willingness to be vaccinated. Those with the greatest trust in the government were the most likely to be vaccinated (43.4%), and those least confident were the least willing (15.8%). From the ones reporting being confident in the local health system, 38.4% were willing to be vaccinated, and from those not confident, only 23.5% were willing to be vaccinated. CONCLUSION: The decision to get vaccinated in the midst of a contagious outbreak involves many considerations. Trust in the government's technical and organization skill to deal with the infectious outbreak along with trust in medical organizations predict the adoption of recommended protection measures. The results indicate that public compliance with vaccination plans in health crisis requires the development of social and institutional trust.","Mesch, Gustavo S.; Schwirian, Kent P.",Am J Infect Control,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26521933/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0196655315007506; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajic.2015.06.031; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0196655315007506,177

The lectins, concanavalin A (Con A), lens culinaris agglutinin (LCA) and peanut agglutinin (PNA), inhibited cell fusion and hemadsorption induced by hPIV-2. Virus nucleoprotein (NP) gene synthesis was largely inhibited, but fusion (F) and hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) gene syntheses were not. An indirect immunofluorescence study showed that Con A inhibited virus NP, F and HN protein syntheses, but LCA did not completely inhibit them, and that PNA inhibited only NP protein synthesis. Using a recombinant green fluorescence protein-expressing hPIV-2, without matrix protein (rghPIV-2ΔM), it was found that virus entry into the cells was not completely prevented. The lectins considerably reduced the number of viruses released compared with that of virus infected cells. The lectins bound to cell surface within 10 min, and many aggregates were observed at 30 min. Con A and LCA slightly disrupted actin microfilaments and microtubules, but PNA had almost no effect on them. These results indicated that the inhibitory effects of the lectins were caused mainly by the considerable prevention of virus adsorption to the cells by the lectin binding to their receptors.","Uematsu, Jun; Koyama, Aoi; Takano, Sayaka; Ura, Yukari; Tanemura, Miho; Kihira, Sahoko; Yamamoto, Hidetaka; Kawano, Mitsuo; Tsurudome, Masato; O’Brien, Myles; Komada, Hiroshi",Viruses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22852043/; https://doi.org/10.3390/v4071104,177
612260,The sustainability–peace nexus: why is it important?,2021-06-12,"Childfree individuals choose not to have children, which makes them a distinctive group from parents who have had children, not-yet-parents who plan to have children, and childless indivduals who would have liked to have children. Most research on parental status and psychosocial characteristics has not effectively distinguished childfree individuals from other non-parents or has relied on non-representative samples. In this study, we use a representative sample of 981 Michigan adults to estimate the prevalence of childfree individuals, to examine how childfree individuals differ from parents and other types of non-parents in life satisfaction, political ideology, and personality, and to examine whether childfree individuals are viewed as an outgroup. We find that over a quarter of Michigan adults identified as childfree. After controlling for demographic characteristics, we find no differences in life satisfaction and limited differences in personality traits between childfree individuals and parents, not-yet-parents, or childless individuals. However, childfree individuals were more liberal than parents, and those who have or want(ed) children felt substantially less warm toward childfree individuals than childfree individuals felt toward each other. Given the prevalence of childfree individuals, the risks of their outgroup status, and their potential role in politics as a uniquely liberal group, it is important for demographic research to distinguish the childfree from others and to better understand these individuals.","Watling Neal, Jennifer; Neal, Zachary P.",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34133450/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0252528,177

Despite the various legal and privacy issues involved in their use, the main reason for its poor acceptance is that users do not use such devices voluntarily and continuously. Digital healthcare devices generally do not provide valuable information to users except for tracking self-checked glucose or walking. To increase the use of these devices, users must first understand the health data produced in the context of their personal health, and the devices must be easy to use and integrated into everyday life. Thus, users need to know how to manage their own data. Medical staff must teach and encourage users to analyze and manage their patient-generated healthcare data, and users should be able to find medical values from these digital devices. Eventually, a single customized service that can comprehensively analyze various medical data to provide valuable customized services to users, and which can be linked to various heterogeneous digital healthcare devices based on the integration of various health data should be developed. Digital healthcare professionals should have detailed knowledge about a variety of digital healthcare devices and fully understand the advantages and disadvantages of digital healthcare to help patients understand and embrace the use of such devices.","Park, Jong Il; Lee, Hwa Young; Kim, Hyunah; Lee, Jisan; Shinn, Jiwon; Kim, Hun-Sung",J Korean Med Sci,https://doi.org/10.3346/jkms.2021.36.e253; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34581521/,177

Until now, the cytotoxic T cell response has not been very well characterized in COVID-19 patients. Here, we analyzed the differentiation and cytotoxic profile of T cells in 30 cases of mild COVID-19 during acute infection. SARS-CoV-2 infection induced a cytotoxic response of CD8+ T cells, but not CD4+ T cells, characterized by the simultaneous production of granzyme A and B, as well as perforin within different effector CD8+ T cell subsets. PD-1 expressing CD8+ T cells also produced cytotoxic molecules during acute infection indicating that they were not functionally exhausted. However, in COVID-19 patients over the age of 80 years the cytotoxic T cell potential was diminished, especially in effector memory and terminally differentiated effector CD8+ cells, showing that elderly patients have impaired cellular immunity against SARS-CoV-2. Our data provides valuable information about T cell responses in COVID-19 patients that may also have important implications for vaccine development. Importance Cytotoxic T cells are responsible for the elimination of infected cells and are key players for the control of viruses. CD8+ T cells with an effector phenotype express cytotoxic molecules and are able to perform target cell killing. COVID-19 patients with a mild disease course were analyzed for the differentiation status and cytotoxic profile of CD8+ T cells. SARS-CoV-2 infection induced a vigorous cytotoxic CD8+ T cell response. However, this cytotoxic profile of T cells was not detected in COVID-19 patients over the age of 80 years. Thus, the absence of a cytotoxic response in elderly patients might be a possible reason for the more frequent severity of COVID-19 in this age group in comparison to younger patients.","Westmeier, Jaana; Paniskaki, Krystallenia; Karaköse, Zehra; Werner, Tanja; Sutter, Kathrin; Dolff, Sebastian; Overbeck, Marvin; Limmer, Andreas; Liu, Jia; Zheng, Xin; Brenner, Thorsten; Berger, Marc M.; Witzke, Oliver; Trilling, Mirko; Lu, Mengji; Yang, Dongliang; Babel, Nina; Westhoff, Timm; Dittmer, Ulf; Zelinskyy, Gennadiy",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.21.262329,177

While Member States of the European Union have approached reopening without the use of antibody testing for COVID-19, such testing may be central to a long-term, sustainable strategy for international travel, employment, and the allocation and monitoring of vaccines. As the use of antibody testing to dictate the enjoyment of individual freedom remains highly controversial, we describe its use in the context of three case studies (return to the workplace, travel and vaccination), applying the substantive legal balancing entailed in the proportionality principle. Differential treatment of individuals based on COVID-19 antibody test results can be justified through the proportionality principle, which offers a sound dividing line between a reasonable and responsible response and an unjust and discriminatory response.","Gunnarsdóttir, H D; Sinha, M S; Gerke, S; Minssen, T",J Law Biosci,https://doi.org/10.1093/jlb/lsaa058; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32908675/,177

However, little is known about how a person’s neighborhood might affect their aging in place. The COVID-19 crisis unintendedly offered a good opportunity to observe the neighborhood’s role in the provision of care. Since formal care services were often limited during the lockdown, informal caregiving may have increased. However, intergenerational contacts in and outside of the household were strongly discouraged by governments worldwide, adding another layer of complexity to caregiving. The aim of this qualitative study was to assess how informal caregivers in Flanders managed to provide care to their care receivers, and what role the neighborhood played in this provision of care. Sixteen qualitative Skype and telephone interviews with informal caregivers were conducted between June and December 2020 to understand their experiences and coping strategies. Overall, most respondents increased their frequency of caregiving during the first lockdown. They took on the extra care needs during the lockdown themselves, and did not actively invoke any kind of neighborhood support. The significance of the neighborhood seemingly remained limited. This was often not because no help was offered, but rather due to a sense of pride or the fear of infection, and an increased effort by family caregivers.","D’herde, Jakob; Gruijthuijsen, Wesley; Vanneste, Dominique; Draulans, Veerle; Heynen, Hilde",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18126482; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34208493/,177

METHODS: The data are all from the epidemic information released by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China and the Health Commission of Hubei Province. We used the multivariable linear regression by the SPSS 19.0 software: the cumulative number of confirmed cases, the cumulative number of cured cases, and the number of daily severe cases were taken as dependent variables, and the six policies, including the Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism of the State Council, lockdown Wuhan city, the first-level response to public health emergencies, the expansion of medical insurance coverage to suspected patients, mobile cabin hospitals, and counterpart assistance in Hubei province, were gradually entered into multiple linear regression models as independent variables. RESULTS: The factors influencing the cumulative number of diagnosed cases ranged from large to small: mobile cabin hospitals and the expansion of medical insurance coverage to suspected patients. The factors influencing the cumulative number of cured cases ranged from large to small: counterpart support medical teams in Hubei province and mobile cabin hospitals. The factors influencing the number of daily severe cases ranged from large to small: mobile cabin hospitals and the expansion of medical insurance coverage to suspected patients. CONCLUSION: The mobile cabin hospital is a major reason for the successfully defeating COVID-19 in China.

To this end, an evaluation of the environmental performance over time between 2015 and 2040 of five different FLW management scenarios implemented in a framework of (i) compliance and (ii) non-compliance with the targets of the Paris Agreement was performed. Results revealed savings in the consumption of abiotic resources in those regions in which thermal treatment has a strong presence, although their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in a scenario of compliance with climate change targets are higher. In contrast, scenarios that include anaerobic digestion and, to a lesser extent those applying aerobic composting, present lower impacts, including climate change, suggesting improvements of 20–60% in non-compliance and 20–80% in compliance with Paris Agreement targets, compared to the current scenarios.","Hoehn, Daniel; Laso, Jara; Cristóbal, Jorge; Ruiz-Salmón, Israel; Butnar, Isabela; Borrion, Aiduan; Bala, Alba; Fullana-i-Palmer, Pere; Vázquez-Rowe, Ian; Aldaco, Rubén; Margallo, María",Foods,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33260541/; https://doi.org/10.3390/foods9121765,177

As quarantine and lockdown orders are prolonged, many people, as well as those physically active individuals, typically responded to this stressful condition by using social media platforms. Objective: This study aimed to examine the level of physical activity of physically active individuals and their attitudes toward social media use during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: A descriptive cross-sectional survey was conducted among physically active individuals in Saudi Arabia between June 2020 and July 2020. An online survey was employed among eligible participants who completed a self-administered questionnaire that covered reasons for physical activity and attitudes toward social media platforms during the COVID-19 pandemic. Results: Of these 323 participants, 29.1% were in the age group of 18–24 years, 66.6% were women, and 67.8% were single. The proportion of participants whose metabolic equivalent of tasks-min/week from vigorous activity <1,680 was 31.9%, and all of the participants follow people or pages in social media related to sports teams and fitness models. The average number of hours spent on social media per day was 2.95 ± 0.90 h. The majority of the participants showed positive attitudes toward social media used for exercise and physical activity. Of the eight variables, age, level of physical activity, and the average of hours spent on social media emerged as significant predictors of attitudes toward the use of social media (P < 0.05). Conclusions: The present survey results indicate adverse consequences of home quarantine as reflected by a small proportion of participants who had differences in levels of vigorous activities during the COVID-19 pandemic in Saudi Arabia.

Thus, there is an urgent need for the right therapeutic drug to curb the disease. However, there is time constraint in drug development, hence the need for drug repurposing approach, a relatively fast and less expensive alternative. In this study, 1,100 Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved drugs were obtained from DrugBank and trimmed to 791 ligands based on illicitness, withdrawal from the market, being chemical agents rather than drugs, being investigational drugs and having molecular weight greater than 500 (Kg/mol). The ligands were docked against six drug targets of the novel SARS CoV-2 - 3-chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro), Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE2), ADP ribose phosphatase of NSP3 (NSP3), NSP9 RNA binding protein (NSP9), RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and Replicase Polyprotein 1a (RP1a). UCSF Chimera, PyRx and Discovery Studio, were used to prepare the proteins, dock the ligands and visualize the complexes, respectively. Remdesivir, Lopinavir and Hydroxychloroquine were used as reference drugs. Pharmacokinetic properties of the ligands were obtained using AdmetSAR. The binding energies of the standard drugs ranged from -5.4 to -8.7 kcal/mol while over 400 of the ligands screened showed binding energy lower than -5.4 kcal/mol. Out of the 791 number of compounds docked, 10, 91, 132, 92, 54 and 96 compounds showed lower binding energies than all the controls against 3CLPro, ACE2, NSP3, NSP9, RP1a and RdRp, respectively. Ligands that bound all target proteins, and showed the lowest binding energies with good ADMET properties and particularly showed the lowest binding against ACE2 are ethynodiol diacetate (-15.6 kcal/mol), methylnaltrexone (-15.5 kcal/mol), ketazolam (-14.5 kcal/mol) and naloxone (-13.6 kcal/mol).

METHODS: This study evaluated the association of underlying CV conditions with disease progression in patients with mild COVID-19. The primary outcome was the need to be transferred to the designated hospital for intensive care due to COVID-19 disease progression. The patients were divided into with and without CV conditions as well as stable and intensive care groups. RESULTS: Of the 332 patients with mild COVID-19, the median age was 51 years (IQR, 40-59 years), and 200 (61.2%) were female. Of the 48 (14.5%) patients with CV conditions, 23 (47.9%) progressed to severe disease status and required intensive care. Compared with patients without CV conditions, patients with CV conditions were older and more likely to have fatigue, chest tightness, and myalgia. The rate of requiring intensive care was significantly higher among patients with CV conditions than in patients without CV conditions (47.92% vs. 12.4%; P < 0.001). In subgroup analysis, the rate of requiring intensive care was also higher among patients with either hypertension or coronary heart disease (CHD) than in patients without hypertension or CHD. The multivariable regression model showed that CV condition served as an independent risk factor for intensive care (odds ratio (OR), 2.652 (95% CI, 1.019-6.899)) after adjustment for various cofounders.

This field remains an emerging research area with some evidence of its effectiveness; however, there is a scarcity of literature describing economic evaluations of mHealth interventions. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to assess the economic viability of using an mHealth approach as an alternative to standard multidisciplinary care by evaluating the direct costs incurred within treatment arms during a noninferiority randomized controlled trial (RCT). METHODS: A digitally delivered (via a smartphone app) maintenance phase of a pediatric weight management program was developed iteratively with patients and families using evidence-based approaches. We undertook a microcosting exercise and budget impact analysis to assess the costs of delivery from the perspective of the publicly funded health care system. Resource use was analyzed alongside the RCT, and we estimated the costs associated with the staff time and resources for service delivery per participant. RESULTS: In total, 109 adolescents participated in the trial, and 84 participants completed the trial (25 withdrew from the trial). We estimated the mean direct cost per adolescent attending usual care at 142 (SD 23.7), whereas the cost per adolescent in the mHealth group was 722 (SD 221.1), with variations depending on the number of weeks of treatment completion. The conversion rate for the reference year 2013 was $1=0.7525. The costs incurred for those who withdrew from the study ranged from 35 to 681, depending on the point of dropout and study arm. The main driver of the costs in the mHealth arm was the need for health professional monitoring and support for patients on a weekly basis. The budget impact for offering the mHealth intervention to all newly referred patients in a 1-year period was estimated at 59,046 using the assessed approach. CONCLUSIONS: This mHealth approach was substantially more expensive than usual care, although modifications to the intervention may offer opportunities to reduce the mHealth costs. The need for monitoring and support from health care professionals (HCPs) was not eliminated using this delivery model.

Objectives: To determine whether the structural proteins M and N of SARS-CoV induce apoptosis. Study design: We investigated human pulmonary fibroblast (HPF) cells, were transfected with plasmids containing the M or N gene, by TdT-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL), Hoechst 33342 staining for nuclei, and observation of morphology. Results: We found that in the absence of serum about 16.34% of cells transfected by pcDNA3.1-M and 21.72% of N-transfected cells showed typical apoptotic characteristics, significantly different from mock-transfected cells (only 6.23%, p<0.01). Furthermore, the cells that were co-transfected with M and N proteins showed more obvious phenomena of cell death (about 36.03%). There was a statistical significance between M-transfected cells and co-transfected cells (p<0.01), and a remarkable difference between N-transfected cells and co-transfected cells (p<0.01). Conclusions: The results show that M and N proteins of SARS-CoV can induce apoptosis of HPF cells. Co-transfection of M and N enhances the induction of apoptosis by M or N alone, which also suggests that the structural proteins of SARS-CoV may play an important role not only in the process of invasion but also in the pathogenetic process in cells.","Zhao, Gang; Shi, Shu-Qun; Yang, Ying; Peng, Jing-Pian",Cell Biol Toxicol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16845612/,177

Patient data were extracted manually from the electronic health records with use of a standardized protocol. RESULTS: The age of the study population ranged between 20 and 103 years (mean age 66 years ± 17 years). Hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and obesity were the three most prevalent comorbidities. At the 60-day follow-up, 70 patients (27%) had died. In multivariate analyses, age, chronic kidney disease, and previous stroke were associated with death. Most fatal cases (90%) occurred in patients aged 65 years or older. Among such patients, CFS level was the only predictor of death in multivariate analyses. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that increasing age, chronic kidney disease, and previous stroke significantly contribute to a fatal outcome in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. In patients aged 65 years or older, CFS level was the strongest prognostic factor for death.","Tehrani, Sara; Killander, Anna; Åstrand, Per; Jakobsson, Jan; Gille-Johnson, Patrik",Int J Infect Dis,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971220322761; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1201971220322761; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33130213/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2020.10.071,177

We developed land use regression (LUR) models for two particulate matter size fractions, PM(2.5) and PM(10), and for δC, an index calculated from black carbon (BC)—a component of PM(2.5)—which indicates the portion of organic versus elemental BC. LUR models were estimated over Calgary (Canada) for summer 2015 and winter 2016. As all samples exhibited significant spatial autocorrelation, spatial autoregressive lag (SARlag) and error (SARerr) models were computed. SARlag models were preferred for all pollutants in both seasons, and yielded goodness of fit aligned with or higher than values reported in the literature. LUR models yielded consistent sets of predictors, representing industrial activities, traffic, and elevation. The obtained model coefficients were then combined with local land use variables to compute fine-scale concentration predictions over the entire city. The predicted concentrations were slightly lower and less dispersed than the observed ones. Consistent with observed pollution records, prediction maps exhibited higher concentration over the road network, industrial areas, and the eastern quadrants of the city. Lastly, results of a corresponding study of PM in summer 2010 and winter 2011 were considered. While the small size of the 2010–2011 sample hampered a multi-temporal analysis, we cautiously note comparable seasonal patterns and consistent association with land use variables for both PM fine fractions over the 5-year interval.","Bertazzon, Stefania; Couloigner, Isabelle; Mirzaei, Mojgan",GeoJournal,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33424083/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s10708-020-10345-7,177

We calculated age-standardized percentages of visits to a general doctor and an epilepsy specialist during the past 12 months, accounting for the complex survey design. Among US adults with active epilepsy in 2017, 27.1% saw a general doctor only, 9.0% saw a neurologist/epilepsy specialist only, 53.0% visited both a general doctor and a neurologist/epilepsy specialist, and 11.4% did not see either a general doctor or a neurologist/specialist. Overall, 62.0% [95% confidence interval (CI) = 55.2%–67.5%] of adults with active epilepsy visited a neurologist or epilepsy specialist in the past year. A visit in the past 12 months with both provider types was not significantly different in 2017 compared with 2010 (53.0% vs 46.2%) while seeing a general doctor only had declined (41.8% vs 27.1%, p < 0.05). Given that 79.8% of US adults with active epilepsy reported being seen by a general doctor within the past 12 months, epilepsy stakeholders have an opportunity to enhance epilepsy care by ensuring that general practitioners have access to the latest information about epilepsy diagnosis and new treatment options.

Evaluation of this situation requires an understanding of the common etiologies, which are associated with the demographics of travelers and the destinations. METHODS: We conducted a 5-year prospective observational study on the etiologies of fever in travelers returning from the tropics admitted to the infectious and tropical diseases unit of a university teaching hospital in Marseilles, France. RESULTS: A total of 613 patients were enrolled, including 364 migrants (59.4%), 126 travelers (20.6%), 37 visitors (6%), 24 expatriates (3.9%), and 62 patients (10.1%) who could not be classified. Malaria was the most common diagnosis (75.2%), with most cases (62%) acquired by migrants from the Comoros archipelago and who had traveled to these islands to visit friends and relatives. Agents of food-borne and water-borne infections (3.9%) and respiratory tract infections (3.4%) were also frequently identified as the cause of fever. Other infections included emerging diseases such as gnathostomiasis, hepatitis E infection and rickettsial diseases, as well as common infections or exotic diseases. CONCLUSIONS: Although we have identified here various causes of imported fever, 8.2% of the fevers remained unexplained. An improved approach to diagnosis may allow for the discovery of new diseases in travelers in the future.","Parola, Philippe; Soula, Georges; Gazin, Pierre; Foucault, Cedric; Delmont, Jean; Brouqui, Philippe",Travel Med Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16887726/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1477893905000086; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1477893905000086,177

P2 performs the dual tasks of replication and transcription de novo on single-stranded RNA templates, and plays a critical role in the viral life-cycle. Work over the last few decades has yielded a wealth of biochemical and structural information on the functional regulation of P2, on its role in the spatiotemporal regulation of RNA synthesis and its variability across the Cystoviridae family. These range from atomic resolution snapshots of P2 trapped in functionally significant states, in complex with catalytic/structural metal ions, polynucleotide templates and substrate nucleoside triphosphates, to P2 in the context of viral capsids providing structural insight into the assembly of supramolecular complexes and regulatory interactions therein. They include in vitro biochemical studies using P2 purified to homogeneity and in vivo studies utilizing infectious core particles. Recent advances in experimental techniques have also allowed access to the temporal dimension and enabled the characterization of dynamics of P2 on the sub-nanosecond to millisecond timescale through measurements of nuclear spin relaxation in solution and single molecule studies of transcription from seconds to minutes. Below we summarize the most significant results that provide critical insight into the role of P2 in regulating RNA synthesis in cystoviruses.","Alphonse, Sébastien; Ghose, Ranajeet",Virus Research,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2017.01.006; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28104452/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168170216307353; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168170216307353,177

638170,Original Article Highlights From This Issue,2021-05-31,"BACKGROUND During the COVID-19 pandemic, the disruption in care for sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and the social distancing measures have led to reductions in STI testing and sexual behavior. We assessed the impact of these COVID-19-related changes on transmission of C. trachomatis (CT) and N. gonorrhoeae (NG) among men who have sex with men (MSM) in the Netherlands. METHODS We developed a mathematical model for CT and NG transmission among MSM, accounting for COVID-19-related changes in sexual behavior and testing in 2020-2021. Changes in 2020 were estimated from data from the Dutch COVID-19, Sex, and Intimacy Survey among MSM and the National Database of STI Clinics. Due to lack of data for 2021, we examined several scenarios covering a range of changes. RESULTS A reduction of 10% and 40% in STI testing of symptomatic and asymptomatic (respectively) individuals with a 10-20% reduction in numbers of casual partners (according to partner status and activity level) during the second lockdown, resulted in a 2.4% increase in CT prevalence, but a 2.8% decline in NG prevalence in 2021. A 5% and 30% reduction in STI testing of symptomatic and asymptomatic (respectively) individuals with the same reduction in casual partners resulted in a 0.6% increase in CT prevalence and a 4.9% decrease in NG prevalence in 2021. CONCLUSIONS The disruption in STI care due to COVID-19 might have resulted in a small increase in CT prevalence, but a decrease in NG prevalence. Scaling up STI care is imperative to prevent increases in STI transmission.","Xiridou, Maria; Heijne, Janneke; Adam, Philippe; Op de Coul, Eline; Matser, Amy; de Wit, John; Wallinga, Jacco; van Benthem, Birgit",Sexually transmitted diseases,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34475357/; https://doi.org/10.1097/olq.0000000000001551,177

640264,Using Machine Learning of Clinical Data to Diagnose COVID-19,2020-06-24,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has brought to light the lacunae in the preparedness of healthcare systems across the globe. This preparedness also includes the safety of healthcare providers (HCPs) at various levels. Sudden spread of COVID-19 infection has created threatening and vulnerable conditions for the HCPs. The current pandemic situation has not only affected physical health of HCPs but also their mental health. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to understand the prevalence and severity of secondary traumatic stress, optimism parameters, along with states of mood experienced by the HCPs, viz., doctors, nurses and allied healthcare professionals (including Physiotherapist, Lab technicians, Phlebotomist, dieticians, administrative staff and clinical pharmacist), during the COVID-19 lockdown in India. METHODOLOGY: The assessment of level of secondary traumatic stress (STS), optimism/pessimism (via Life Orientation Test-Revised) and current mood states experienced by Indian HCPs in the present COVID-19 pandemic situation was done using a primary data of 2,008 HCPs from India during the first lockdown during April-May 2020. Data was collected through snow-ball sampling technique, reaching out to various medical health care professionals through social media platforms. RESULT: Amongst the study sample 88.2% of doctors, 79.2 of nurses and 58.6% of allied HCPs were found to have STS in varying severity. There was a female preponderance in the category of Severe STS. Higher optimism on the LOTR scale was observed among doctors at 39.3% followed by nurses at 26.7% and allied health care professionals 22.8%. The mood visual analogue scale which measures the “mood” during the survey indicated moderate mood states without any gender bias in the study sample. CONCLUSION: The current investigation sheds light on the magnitude of the STSS experienced by the HCPs in the Indian Subcontinent during the pandemic. This hitherto undiagnosed and unaddressed issue, calls for a dire need of creating better and accessible mental health programmes and facilities for the health care providers in India.","K.

We show how both areas have resulted in a large variety of methods that range from enhancement, detection, segmentation and characterizations of anatomical structures and lesions to complete systems that automatically identify and classify several diseases in order to aid clinical diagnosis and treatment. Different imaging modalities such as computer tomography, magnetic resonance, radiography, ultrasound, dermoscopy and microscopy offer multiple opportunities to build automatic systems that help medical diagnosis, taking advantage of their own physical nature. However, these imaging modalities also impose important limitations to the design of automatic image analysis systems for diagnosis aid due to their inherent characteristics such as signal to noise ratio, contrast and resolutions in time, space and wavelength.

642378,Complexity in Economic and Social Systems,2021-01-21,"Large differences exist in the provision of ICU beds worldwide, with a complicated mix of risks and benefits to the population of having either too few or too many beds. Having too few beds can result in delayed admission of patients to the ICU or no admission at all, with either scenario potentially increasing mortality. Potential societal benefits of having few beds include lower costs for health care and less futile intensive care at the end of life. With added ICU beds for a population, mortality benefit should accrue, but there is still the question of whether the addition of beds always means that more lives will be saved or whether there is a point at which no additional mortality benefit is gained. With an abundance of ICU beds may come the possibility of increasing harm in the forms of unnecessary costs, poor quality of deaths (ie, excessively intensive), and iatrogenic complications. The possibility of harm may be likened to the concept of falling off a Starling curve, which is traditionally used to describe worsening heart function when overfilling occurs. This commentary examines the possible implications of having too few or too many ICU beds and proposes the concept of a family of Starling curves as a way to conceptualize the balance of societal benefits and harms associated with different availability of ICU beds for a population.","Wunsch, Hannah",Chest,http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc3367487?pdf=render; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22670019/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012369212603262; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0012369212603262; https://doi.org/10.1378/chest.11-2819,177

644329,Data on the stability of darunavir/cobicistat suspension after tablet manipulation,2020-04-12,"Wildlife species constitute a vast and uncharted reservoir of zoonotic pathogens that can pose a severe threat to global human health. Zoonoses have become increasingly impactful over the past decades, and the expanding trade in wildlife is unarguably among the most significant risk factors for their emergence. Despite several warnings from the academic community about the spillover risks associated with wildlife trade, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic underlines that current policies on the wildlife industry are deficient. Conservation initiatives, rather than practices that attempt to eradicate zoonotic pathogens or the wild species that harbour them, could play a vital role in preventing the emergence of life-threatening zoonoses. This review explores how wildlife conservation initiatives could effectively reduce the risk of new zoonotic diseases emerging from the wildlife trade by integrating existing literature on zoonotic diseases and risk factors associated with wildlife trade. Conservation should mainly aim at reducing human-wildlife interactions in the wildlife trade by protecting wildlife habitats and providing local communities with alternative protein sources. In addition, conservation should focus on regulating the legal wildlife trade and education about disease transfer and safer hunting and butchering methods. By uniting efforts for wildlife protection and universal concern for preventing zoonotic epidemics, conservation initiatives have the potential to safeguard both biodiversity, animal welfare, and global human health security.","Hilderink, M.H.; de Winter, I.I.",Heliyon,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2021.e07692; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2405844021017953; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405844021017953; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34386637/,177
646615,Foreword to the Special Section on Shape Modeling International 2020,2020-07-18,"BACKGROUND: How cigarette smoke (CS) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) affect severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) infection and severity is controversial. We investigated the effects of COPD and CS on the expression of SARS-CoV-2 entry receptor ACE2 in vivo in COPD patients and controls and in CS-exposed mice, and the effects of CS on SARS-CoV-2 infection in human bronchial epithelial cells in vitro. METHODS: We quantified: (1) pulmonary ACE2 protein levels by immunostaining and ELISA, and both ACE2 and/or TMPRSS2 mRNA levels by RT-qPCR in two independent human cohorts; and (2) pulmonary ACE2 protein levels by immunostaining and ELISA in C57BL/6 WT mice exposed to air or CS for up to 6 months. The effects of CS exposure on SARS-CoV-2 infection were evaluated after in vitro infection of Calu-3 cells and differentiated human bronchial epithelial cells (HBECs), respectively. RESULTS: ACE2 protein and mRNA levels were decreased in peripheral airways from COPD patients versus controls but similar in central airways. Mice exposed to CS had decreased ACE2 protein levels in their bronchial and alveolar epithelia versus air-exposed mice. CS treatment decreased viral replication in Calu-3 cells, as determined by immunofluorescence staining for replicative double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) and western blot for viral N protein. Acute CS exposure decreased in vitro SARS-CoV-2 replication in HBECs, as determined by plaque assay and RT-qPCR. CONCLUSIONS: ACE2 levels were decreased in both bronchial and alveolar epithelial cells from COPD patients versus controls, and from CS-exposed versus air-exposed mice. CS-pre-exposure potently inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication in vitro. These findings urge to investigate further the controversial effects of CS and COPD on SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Amid the rapidly growing number of biological devices and the exponential accumulation of data in the mental health sector, the upcoming years are facing a need to homogenize research and development processes in academia as well as in the private sector and to centralize data into federalizing platforms. This has become even more important in light of the current global pandemic. Here, we propose an end-to-end methodology that optimizes and homogenizes digital research processes. Each step of the process is elaborated from project conception to knowledge extraction, with a focus on data analysis. The methodology is based on iterative processes, thus allowing an adaptation to the rate at which digital technologies evolve. The methodology also advocates for interdisciplinary (from mathematics to psychology) and intersectoral (from academia to the industry) collaborations to merge the gap between fundamental and applied research. We also pinpoint the ethical challenges and technical and human biases (from data recorded to the end user) associated with digital mental health. In conclusion, our work provides guidelines for upcoming digital mental health studies, which will accompany the translation of fundamental mental health research to digital technologies.","Boulos, Laura Joy; Mendes, Alexandre; Delmas, Alexandra; Chraibi Kaadoud, Ikram",Front Psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.574440; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34630171/,177

The prevalence of autosomal dominant PD varies around the world mainly depending on local founder effects. The highest prevalence of LRRK2 G2019S PD in Norway is located to the central part of the country and most families could be traced back to common ancestors. The typical Norwegian LRRK2 phenotype is not different from classical PD and similar to that seen in most other LRRK2 families. The discovery of LRRK2 PD has allowed us to follow-up multi-incident families and to study their phenotype longitudinally. In the Norwegian LRRK2 families there has been a significantly higher incidence of inflammatory diseases like multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis that seen in other PD populations. Recent studies in LRRK2 mechanisms have indicated that this protein may be crucial in initiating disease processes. In this short survey of 100 Norwegian mutation carriers followed through more than 15 years are presented. The prevalence of inflammatory diseases among these cases is highlighted. The role of LRRK2 in the conversion process from carrier status to PD phenotype is still unknown and disease generating mechanisms important for initiating LRRK2 PD are still to be identified.,"Aasly, Jan O.",Front Neurosci,https://doi.org/10.3389/fnins.2021.634666; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33584195/,177
649262,Chapter Thirteen Ten statements for simplifying your life with embodied choices,2021-12-31,"Since the outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), loss of smell has increasingly been reported as a frequent clinical sign. Understanding the underlying mechanism and the prognostic value of this symptom will help better manage patients. SARS-CoV-2, as SARS-CoV-1, can likely spread to the central nervous system (CNS) via the olfactory nerve, a known gateway for respiratory neurotropic viruses. We hypothesise that sudden loss of smell due to COVID-19 is the consequence of a protective host defence mechanism involving apoptosis of olfactory receptor neurons. Sacrificing smelling over neuroprotection is a logical strategy, even more so as olfaction is the only sense with the ability to regenerate in adults. Induced apoptosis of olfactory neurons has been shown in mice, successfully preventing neuroinvasion. On the other hand, adult olfactory neurogenesis has been shown to be regulated in part by the immune system, allowing to restore olfactory function. Understanding anosmia as part of a defence mechanism would support the concept of sudden anosmia as being a positive prognostic factor in the short term. Also, it may orient research to investigate the risk of future neurodegenerative disease linked to persisting coronavirus in neurons.","Le Bon, SD; Horoi, M",Med Hypotheses,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306987720311555?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0306987720311555; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mehy.2020.109881; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32474381/,177

In the concept of natural biofactory for bioactive compounds production, microalgae represent one of the most promising targets filling many biotechnological applications, and allowing the development of an eco-sustainable production of natural bioactive metabolites. Vitamins are probably one of the cutting edges of microalgal diversity compounds. MAIN TEXT: Microalgae can usefully provide many of the required vitamins in humans, more than terrestrial plants, for instance. Indeed, vitamins D and K, little present in many plants or fruits, are instead available from microalgae. The same occurs for some vitamins B (B(12), B(9), B(6)), while the other vitamins (A, C, D, E) are also provided by microalgae. This large panel of vitamins diversity in microalgal cells represents an exploitable platform in order to use them as natural vitamins’ producers for human consumption. This study aims to provide an integrative overview on vitamins content in the microalgal realm, and discuss on the great potential of microalgae as sources of different forms of vitamins to be included as functional ingredients in food or nutraceuticals for the human health. We report on the biological roles of vitamins in microalgae, the current knowledge on their modulation by environmental or biological forcing and on the biological activity of the different vitamins in human metabolism and health protection. CONCLUSION: Finally, we critically discuss the challenges for promoting microalgae as a relevant source of vitamins, further enhancing the interests of microalgal “biofactory” for biotechnological applications, such as in nutraceuticals or cosmeceuticals.","Del Mondo, Angelo; Smerilli, Arianna; Sané, Elisabet; Sansone, Clementina; Brunet, Christophe",Microb Cell Fact,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12934-020-01459-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33138823/,177

Solid‐organ transplantation (SOT) recipients are at higher risk due to their suppressed immune system. In this study, we aimed to conduct a systematic review on COVID‐19 clinical manifestations and treatment strategies in SOT recipients. METHODS: We searched three databases for relevant terms related to COVID‐19 and transplantation. 50 studies, including 337 patients, were reviewed. RESULTS: 236 patients were male, with a mean age of 49.9 years. The most prevalent group was the kidney 57.0%, followed by 17.2% heart, and 13.6% liver. Fever and Cough were the most reported clinical presentations. Infiltration (55.4%) in chest x‐ray and ground‐glass opacity (67.1%) in CT scans were the most radiological findings. It was found that 96.8% and 72.4% of patients present with CRP level and lymphocytopenia, respectively, and 70.6% of kidney recipients patients presented with high creatinine levels. The most common baseline immunosuppressants were Calcineurin inhibitors (88.9%), and antimetabolites (73.2%). Antimetabolites (84.3%) and Calcineurin inhibitors (54.3%) were discontinued/decreased 84.3% whereas glucocorticoids dosage almost have no change (77.9%) or even increased. 18.4% of cases had died, and 65.9% were discharged. CONCLUSIONS: Patients’ demographics, signs, symptoms, and radiographic findings in SOT recipients are almost similar to the general population. However, gastrointestinal symptoms appear to be more common. There are different treatment strategies, but in most of them, antimetabolite and Calcineurin inhibitors were decreased or discontinued, while corticosteroids were increased. Finally, Covid‐19 seems to be more severe and has higher mortality in SOT recipients compared to the general population.","Moosavi, Seyed Ali; Mashhadiagha, Amirali; Motazedian, Nasrin; Hashemazar, Alireza; Hoveidaei, Amir Human; Bolignano, Davide",Transpl Infect Dis,https://doi.org/10.1111/tid.13427; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32779820/,177

The objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to evaluate the correlation between COVID-19 disease and pleural effusion. A rigorous literature search was conducted using multiple databases. All eligible observational studies were included from around the globe. The pooled prevalence and associated 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated using the random effect model. Mantel-Haenszel odds ratios were produced to report overall effect size using random effect models for severity and mortality outcomes. Funnel plots, Egger regression tests, and Begg-Mazumdar's rank correlation test were used to appraise publication bias. Data from 23 studies including 6234 COVID-19 patients was obtained. The overall prevalence of pleural effusion in COVID-19 patients was 9.55% (95% CI, I2 = 92%). Our findings also indicated that the presence of pleural effusions associated with increased risk of severity of disease(OR = 5.08, 95% CI 3.14-8.22, I2 = 77.4%) and mortality due to illness(OR = 4.53, 95% CI 2.16-9.49, I2 = 66%) compared with patients without pleural effusion. Sensitivity analyses illustrated a similar effect size while decreasing the heterogeneity. No significant publication bias was evident in the meta-analysis.

OBJECTIVE: To determine patients’ perspective on adoption of telehealth as a response to the pandemic and its sustainability in the future. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Following a COVID-19 outbreak, 101 patients with advanced genitourinary cancers are currently managed “virtually” for therapy administration at our tertiary care unit. They were surveyed about the current situation, and current and long-term employment of telehealth. INTERVENTION: Rapid implementation of virtual patient management. OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Patients’ perception of anxiety of COVID-19 and cancer, perspective on telehealth measures as a reaction to the current COVID-19 pandemic, and long-term acceptance were used as outcomes. Wilcoxon matched-pair signed rank test, chi-square test, and Mann-Whitney U test were performed. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: Of 101 patients, 92 answered the questionnaire, with 71 (77.2%) responding virtually by e-mail or phone call. Anxiety of cancer (6/10, interquartile range [IQR] 3–8) superseded that of COVID-19 (four/10, IQR 2–5.25, p < 0.001), and patients oppose temporary treatment interruption. Of the patients, 66.0% perceive their susceptibility to COVID-19 as equal to or lower than the general population and 52.2% believe that COVID-19 will not affect their therapy. In future, patients (62.6%) prefer to maintain in-person appointments as opposed to complete remote care, but accept remote care during the pandemic (eight/10, IQR 5–9). Beyond the crisis, maintaining telehealth has low preference rates (four/10, IQR 2–7), with high acceptance for external laboratory controls (60.9%) and online visit management (48.9%), but lower acceptance for remote treatment planning including staging discussions (44.6%) and for referral to secondary care oncologists (17.4%). CONCLUSIONS: Despite the pandemic, cancer remains the key concern and patients are not willing to compromise on their treatment. Rapid implementation of telehealth is tolerated well during the need of social distancing, with a clear “red line” concerning changes in existing patient-physician relationships. Balancing future implementation of telehealth while considering patients’ demand for personal relationships will ensure human dignity in uro-oncology. PATIENT SUMMARY: We queried patients with genitourinary cancers treated in an almost virtual setting following a local coronavirus outbreak. Acceptance of telehealth during the current situation is high; however, long-term implementation of the adapted services is less favored. We deduce that patient-physician relationship is crucial for cancer patients and needs to be balanced against measures for social distancing to forge the future management.","Rodler, Severin; Apfelbeck, Maria; Schulz, Gerald Bastian; Ivanova, Troya; Buchner, Alexander; Staehler, Michael; Heinemann, Volker; Stief, Christian; Casuscelli, Jozefina",Eur Urol Focus,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405456920301450; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32534969/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2405456920301450; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.euf.2020.05.010,177

663167,Online-Only International Conferences: Strategies for Maintaining Community,2021-06-15,"Background: ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI) is associated with high mortality and morbidity. In order to minimize cardiac tissue injury, primary per-cutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI) as treatment of choice should be performed as soon as possible. Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) as an ongoing major global concern affects the other parts of health care system. Applying preventive strategies during this outbreak is necessary. However, critical times in STEMI management and outcomes may be influenced by infection control protocols implementation. The aim of this study is to investigate the differences in time intervals related to STEMI care and 15-day major adverse cardiac events (MACE) during this outbreak compared with the same period in last year and to determine whether the STEMI protocol should be changed to thrombolytic therapy during COVID-19 outbreak or not. Methods and results: The patients with STEMI who underwent PPCI in Tehran Heart Center were included. Chest Computed tomography (CT) imaging and real time Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (rRT-PCR) were only performed for COVID-19 suspected patients. Seventy-seven patients from 29th February to 29th March 2020 were compared with 62 patients from 1st to 30th March 2019. COVID-19 infection was confirmed by rRT-PCR in 5 cases. CT imaging in 4 out of 5 patients was in favor of COVID-19. The median of door-to-device time was reduced 13 minutes during this outbreak (p :0.007). In-hospital mortality before and during outbreak was 3.22% and 5.19%, respectively (p: 0.57). Confirmed infection with COVID-19 was only reported in one of expired cases. The difference in 15-day MACE between two time periods was not statistically significant. Conclusion: Given that 15-day outcome in acute STEMI patients is not affected by COVID-19 outbreak, we did not find it reasonable to change our protocol. However, further studies are needed to determine a standard protocol for emergency management","Salarifar, M.; Ghavami, M.; Poorhosseini, H.; Masoudkabir, F.; Jenab, Y.; Amirzadegan, A.; Alidoosti, M.; Aghajani, H.; Bozorgi, A.; Hosseini, K.; Lotfi-Tokaldany, M.; Mortazavi, S.

Prioritizing cleft/craniofacial surgery in the already overloaded medical system will then become an issue. The European Cleft Palate Craniofacial Association, together with the European Cleft and Craniofacial Initiative for Equality in Care, performed a brief survey to capture a current snapshot during a rapidly evolving pandemic. METHODS: A questionnaire was sent to the 2242 participants who attended 1 of 3 recent international cleft/craniofacial meetings. RESULTS: The respondents indicated that children with Robin sequence who were not responding to nonsurgical options should be treated as emergency cases. Over 70% of the respondents indicated that palate repair should be performed before the age of 15 months, an additional 22% stating the same be performed by 18 months. Placement of middle ear tubes, primary cleft lip surgery, alveolar bone grafting, and velopharyngeal insufficiency surgery also need prioritization. Children with craniofacial conditions such as craniosynostosis and increased intracranial pressure need immediate care, whilst children with craniosynostosis and associated obstructive sleep apnea syndrome or proptosis need surgical care within 3 months of the typical timing. Craniosynostosis without signs of increased intracranial pressure needs correction before the age of 18 months. CONCLUSIONS: This survey indicates several areas of cleft and craniofacial conditions that need prioritization, but also certain areas where intervention is less urgent. We acknowledge that there will be differences in the post COVID-19 response according to circumstances and policies in individual countries.","Breugem, Corstiaan; Smit, Hans; Mark, Hans; Davies, Gareth; Schachner, Peter; Collard, Mechelle; Sell, Debbie; Autelitano, Luca; Rezzonico, Angela; Mazzoleni, Fabio; Novelli, Giorgio; Mossey, Peter; Persson, Martin; Mehendale, Felicity; Gaggl, Alexander; van Gogh, Christine; Zuurbier, Petra; Reinart, Siegmar; de Graaff, Feike; Meazzini, Costanza",Plast Reconstr Surg Glob Open,https://doi.org/10.1097/gox.0000000000003080; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33133937/,177

Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess the health-care providers' information seeking behavior on COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A descriptive cross-sectional study had conducted among 291 respondents. The participant’s characteristics were presented using frequency and percentage. The association between the independent and dependent variables was explained using chi-squared test. RESULTS: Out of the 291 respondents, 207 (71.1%) of them had sought information on COVID-19 pandemic. The association between the gender and educational status with the outcome variable was found insignificant.

Incidence and characteristics of neurological complications are unclear. For this reason, the European Academy of Neurology (EAN) core COVID‐19 Task Force initiated a survey on neurological symptoms observed in patients with COVID‐19 infection. METHODS: A 17‐question on‐line survey was made available on the EAN website and distributed to EAN members and other worldwide physicians starting on April 9(th), 2020. RESULTS: By April 27(th,) 2020, proper data were collected from 2,343 responders (out of 4,199), of whom 82.0% were neurologists, mostly from Europe. Most responders (74.7%) consulted patients with COVID‐19 mainly in emergency rooms and in COVID‐19 units. The majority (67.0%) had evaluated fewer than 10 patients with neurological manifestations of COVID‐19 (neuro COVID‐19). The most frequently reported neurological findings were headache (61.9%), myalgia (50.4%), anosmia (49.2%), ageusia (39.8%), impaired consciousness (29.3%), and psychomotor agitation (26.7%). Encephalopathy and acute cerebrovascular disorders were reported at 21.0%. Neurological manifestations were generally interpreted as being possibly related to COVID‐19, they were most commonly recognized in patients with multiple general symptoms, and occurred at any time during infection. CONCLUSION: Neurologists are currently and actively involved in the management of neurological issues related to the COVID‐19 pandemic. This survey justifies setting up a prospective registry to better capture the prevalence of patients with neuro COVID‐19, neurological disease characteristics and the contribution of neurological manifestations to outcome.","Moro, E.; Priori, A.; Beghi, E.; Helbok, R.; Campiglio, L.; Bassetti, C.L.; Bianchi, E.; Maia, L.F.; Ozturk, S.; Cavallieri, F.; Zedde, M.; Sellner, J.; Bereczki, D.; Rakusa, M.; Di Liberto, G.; Sauerbier, A.; Pisani, A.; Macerollo, A.; Soffietti, R.; Taba, P.; Crean, M.; Twardzik, A.; Oreja‐Guevara, C.; Bodini, B.; Jenkins, T.J.; von Oertzen, T.J.",Eur J Neurol,https://doi.org/10.1111/ene.14407; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32558002/,177
665440,Leveraging Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality to Combat Chronic Pain in Youth: Position Paper From the Interdisciplinary Network on Virtual and Augmented Technologies for Pain Management,2021-04-26,"OBJECTIVES: Lung ultrasound (LUS) is a portable, low-cost respiratory imaging tool but is challenged by user dependence and lack of diagnostic specificity. It is unknown whether the advantages of LUS implementation could be paired with deep learning (DL) techniques to match or exceed human-level, diagnostic specificity among similar appearing, pathological LUS images. DESIGN: A convolutional neural network (CNN) was trained on LUS images with B lines of different aetiologies. CNN diagnostic performance, as validated using a 10% data holdback set, was compared with surveyed LUS-competent physicians. SETTING: Two tertiary Canadian hospitals. PARTICIPANTS: 612 LUS videos (121 381 frames) of B lines from 243 distinct patients with either (1) COVID-19 (COVID), non-COVID acute respiratory distress syndrome (NCOVID) or (3) hydrostatic pulmonary edema (HPE). RESULTS: The trained CNN performance on the independent dataset showed an ability to discriminate between COVID (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) 1.0), NCOVID (AUC 0.934) and HPE (AUC 1.0) pathologies. This was significantly better than physician ability (AUCs of 0.697, 0.704, 0.967 for the COVID, NCOVID and HPE classes, respectively), p<0.01. CONCLUSIONS: A DL model can distinguish similar appearing LUS pathology, including COVID-19, that cannot be distinguished by humans. The performance gap between humans and the model suggests that subvisible biomarkers within ultrasound images could exist and multicentre research is merited.","Arntfield, Robert; VanBerlo, Blake; Alaifan, Thamer; Phelps, Nathan; White, Matthew; Chaudhary, Rushil; Ho, Jordan; Wu, Derek",BMJ Open,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-045120; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33674378/,177
665743,Feminist Ethics and Women Leaders: From Difference to Intercorporeality,2020-05-12,"BACKGROUND: The wide availability of the Internet and the growth of digital communication technologies have become an important tool for epidemiological studies and health surveillance. Influenzanet is a participatory surveillance system monitoring the incidence of influenza-like illness (ILI) in Europe since 2003. It is based on data provided by volunteers who self-report their symptoms via the Internet throughout the influenza season and currently involves 10 countries. OBJECTIVE: In this paper, we describe the Influenzanet system and provide an overview of results from several analyses that have been performed with the collected data, which include participant representativeness analyses, data validation (comparing ILI incidence rates between Influenzanet and sentinel medical practice networks), identification of ILI risk factors, and influenza vaccine effectiveness (VE) studies previously published. Additionally, we present new VE analyses for the Netherlands, stratified by age and chronic illness and offer suggestions for further work and considerations on the continuity and sustainability of the participatory system. METHODS: Influenzanet comprises country-specific websites where residents can register to become volunteers to support influenza surveillance and have access to influenza-related information. Participants are recruited through different communication channels. Following registration, volunteers submit an intake questionnaire with their postal code and sociodemographic and medical characteristics, after which they are invited to report their symptoms via a weekly electronic newsletter reminder. Several thousands of participants have been engaged yearly in Influenzanet, with over 36,000 volunteers in the 2015-16 season alone. RESULTS: In summary, for some traits and in some countries (eg, influenza vaccination rates in the Netherlands), Influenzanet participants were representative of the general population. However, for other traits, they were not (eg, participants underrepresent the youngest and oldest age groups in 7 countries). The incidence of ILI in Influenzanet was found to be closely correlated although quantitatively higher than that obtained by the sentinel medical practice networks. Various risk factors for acquiring an ILI infection were identified. The VE studies performed with Influenzanet data suggest that this surveillance system could develop into a complementary tool to measure the effectiveness of the influenza vaccine, eventually in real time. CONCLUSIONS: Results from these analyses illustrate that Influenzanet has developed into a fast and flexible monitoring system that can complement the traditional influenza surveillance performed by sentinel medical practices. The uniformity of Influenzanet allows for direct comparison of ILI rates between countries. It also has the important advantage of yielding individual data, which can be used to identify risk factors. The way in which the Influenzanet system is constructed allows the collection of data that could be extended beyond those of ILI cases to monitor pandemic influenza and other common or emerging diseases.","Koppeschaar, Carl E; Colizza, Vittoria; Guerrisi, Caroline; Turbelin, Clément; Duggan, Jim; Edmunds, W John; Kjelsø, Charlotte; Mexia, Ricardo; Moreno, Yamir; Meloni, Sandro; Paolotti, Daniela; Perrotta, Daniela; van Straten, Edward; Franco, Ana O",JMIR Public Health Surveill,https://doi.org/10.2196/publichealth.7429; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28928112/,177

Nevertheless, there was a lack of evidence whether blood products and specifically bone marrow can cause transfusion-transmitted infection. Initially, there were many uncertainties and did not exist formal recommendations. Before official statements were available, we performed an allogeneic HCT in a 57-year-old male from a related matched donor in the incubation period of COVID-19 where the patient did not develop the disease. Actual epidemiology data suggest that transmission may occur early in the course of infection, even from asymptomatic patients in the incubation period. In our knowledge this is the first case report of an adult hematopoietic cell donor with COVID-19 in the incubation period where the transplant is successfully completed with no transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The low concentration of viral RNA in plasma of patients with COVID-19 could support the safety of blood products, including peripheral blood hematopoietic cells.

It is the first study to assess the utility of emergency teleophthalmology with a simple smartphone application or web browser and a webcam to manage emergency eye care in a population with sudden restricted access to ophthalmologists. In this study, every patient who asked for an ophthalmic emergency consultation in a single specialized center in Paris (‘SOS Œil’) first had to undergo a teleconsultation appointment to evaluate the indication for a physical consultation to preserve lockdown. Under medical advice only, a physical appointment was given within a day (if necessary). The aim of the study was to describe the population and diagnoses and evaluate the main judgment criteria, defined as the ‘ability of teleconsultation to properly indicate a physical consultation for fair diagnosis and treatment in eye emergencies’. This organization has permitted physicians and patients to preserve social distancing while avoiding 3 or 4 physical consultations per person. Notably, 27% of teleconsultations were followed by a physical appointment. There was a mean 4.12-day delay between symptom apparition and consultation, and less than 1 day for traumas, superficial corneal foreign body and neuro-ophthalmological emergencies. There was a 96% sensitivity and 95% specificity to properly evaluate the indication of a physical consultation and only 1.0% misdiagnoses that lead to delayed care. Hence, teleconsultation maintained satisfactory healthcare access to patients with severe ophthalmological disorders while preserving social distancing and sanitary precautions. Therefore, teleconsultation may be seriously considered as a way to efficiently regulate ophthalmic emergencies, especially for patients with limited access to a specialist.","Bourdon, Hugo; Jaillant, Romain; Ballino, Arnaud; Kaim, Pauline El; Debillon, Louis; Bodin, Slim; N’Kosi, Ludovic",J Fr Ophtalmol,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0181551220302497; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jfo.2020.05.005; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32564983/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0181551220302497?v=s5,177

The laboratory documentation of hypercoagulability and impaired fibrinolysis remains a challenge. Our aim was to assess the potential usefulness of viscoelastometric testing (VET) to predict thrombotic events in COVID-19 patients according to the literature. We also (i) analyzed the impact of anticoagulation and the methods used to neutralize heparin, (ii) analyzed whether maximal clot mechanical strength brings more information than Clauss fibrinogen, and (iii) critically scrutinized the diagnosis of hypofibrinolysis. We performed a systematic search in PubMed and Scopus databases until 31st December 2020. VET methods and parameters, and patients’ features and outcomes were extracted. VET was performed for 1063 patients (893 intensive care unit (ICU) and 170 non-ICU, 44 studies). There was extensive heterogeneity concerning study design, VET device used (ROTEM, TEG, Quantra and ClotPro) and reagents (with non-systematic use of heparin neutralization), timing of assay, and definition of hypercoagulable state. Notably, only 4 out of 25 studies using ROTEM reported data with heparinase (HEPTEM). The common findings were increased clot mechanical strength mainly due to excessive fibrinogen component and impaired to absent fibrinolysis, more conspicuous in the presence of an added plasminogen activator. Only 4 studies out of the 16 that addressed the point found an association of VETs with thrombotic events. So-called functional fibrinogen assessed by VETs showed a variable correlation with Clauss fibrinogen. Abnormal VET pattern, often evidenced despite standard prophylactic anticoagulation, tended to normalize after increased dosing. VET studies reported heterogeneity, and small sample sizes do not support an association between the poorly defined prothrombotic phenotype of COVID-19 and thrombotic events.","Bareille, Marion; Hardy, Michaël; Douxfils, Jonathan; Roullet, Stéphanie; Lasne, Dominique; Levy, Jerrold H.; Stépanian, Alain; Susen, Sophie; Frère, Corinne; Lecompte, Thomas; Mullier, François",J Clin Med,https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm10081740; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33923851/,177
671967,Integrating science to address food and health within Global Agenda 2030,2021-04-07,"SIMPLE SUMMARY: This retrospective study of records from a dairy farm explored the impact of receiving a second feeding of colostrum 5–6 h after an initial meal of 3 L of quality-tested colostrum on calf health and productivity until the first lactation. Calves that received a second feeding were less likely to develop failure of transfer of passive immunity or morbidity pre-weaning than calves only receiving one feeding. Similarly, calves receiving a second feeding showed a greater growth rate until weaning and tended to produce more milk in the first lactation. However, receiving a second feeding was not associated with differences in pre-weaning mortality or reproductive efficiency. Our results show that feeding calves a second meal of colostrum within the first few hours of life has a positive impact on calf health and might have positive effects into the first lactation. ABSTRACT: Failure of transfer of passive immunity (FTPI) due to inadequate ingestion of colostral immunoglobulins by calves is associated with increased mortality and morbidity risks. Feeding calves a sufficient amount of quality-tested colostrum within the first hours of life is essential for successfully transferring passive immunity. Many farms have implemented a second meal of colostrum to maximize the opportunities for passive immunity transfer. However, excellent passive immunity can be achieved with a single feeding of sufficient quality-tested colostrum. Moreover, there is currently no evidence demonstrating the impact of a second colostrum feeding within 24 h of life in calves receiving adequate volumes of quality-tested colostrum in an initial feeding. Hence, the objective of this retrospective cohort study was to compare the risks of FPTI, pre-weaning morbidity and mortality, and growth and performance between dairy calves that received one or two feedings of colostrum. For this, the health and production records of a large dairy herd were analyzed. At this farm, newborn calves receive 3 L of quality-tested colostrum soon after birth, followed by another 2 L 5–6 h later. However, at times of shortages of colostrum, calves only receive the initial 3 L meal. The records of 2064 male and 2272 female calves were analyzed, where 4156 and 180 calves received 2 and 1 colostrum meals, respectively. Data from both sexes were included in the analysis of the risks of FTPI, morbidity, and mortality; however, only data from heifer calves were utilized for growth and performance analysis. Survival analysis, and logistic and linear regression models were used to investigate the impact of receiving two feedings of colostrum on calf FTPI status, morbidity, mortality, reproductive indices, pre-weaning average daily gain (ADG), and first lactation 305-d Mature Equivalent milk production (305ME). Calves that received two feedings of colostrum had lower odds of FTPI, a lower probability of being treated for respiratory disease, diarrhea, or any disease, and a greater pre-weaning ADG. However, there was no association between the number of colostrum feedings and pre-weaning mortality, and the probabilities of first insemination and first calving, although heifers receiving two colostrum feedings tended to receive fewer inseminations and to have a greater first lactation 305ME. Collectively, our results suggest that feeding calves a second feeding of colostrum 5–6 h after the initial feeding soon after birth could be an effective strategy to decrease FTPI and morbidity and optimize ADG in dairy calves pre-weaning.","Abuelo, Angel; Cullens, Faith; Hanes, Amanda; Brester, Jill L.",Animals (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33799858/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ani11030782,177
672263,CovidGAN: Data Augmentation Using Auxiliary Classifier GAN for Improved Covid-19 Detection,2020-05-14,"BACKGROUND: The present study is aims to investigate the prevalence and determinants of depression and anxiety among the general population in the context of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak in China. METHODS: A cross-sectional self-report survey methodology was used to gather the following data from Chinese citizens: sociodemographic information, physical and mental health disorder history, daily online time, social media exposure, feeling toward social media exposure, perception of the disease, infection cases in the local area, and previous experiences with stressful life incidents. Levels of anxiety and depression were self-reported employing the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale and the Patient Health Questionnaire 9-item scale, respectively. RESULTS: Among the 6130 participants, the prevalence of anxiety and depression was 7.1 and 12%, respectively. Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that psychological disturbances were associated with gender, people with religious background, being a medical professional, having physical or mental health disease, difficulty accessing medical aids, experience with traumatic incidents, the perceived possibility of sequelae after being cured of COVID-19, daily online time, the source of the information relevant to COVID-19, frequency of receiving information regarding COVID-19, and negative feelings triggered by social media. CONCLUSIONS: There needs to be a consistent message from authorities to reduce the panic and confusion of the public, and to decrease public exposure to persistently negative information. It is necessary to help people transform their negative experiences into positive changes especially for individuals with physical illness, individuals with mental health disorders, and medical professionals.

672533,AURORA: A Unified fRamework fOR Anomaly detection on multivariate time series,2021-06-23,"Anticoagulant drugs have been used to prevent and treat thrombosis. However, they are associated with risk of hemorrhage. Therefore, prior to their clinical use, it is important to assess the risk of bleeding and thrombosis. In case of older anticoagulant drugs like heparin and warfarin, dose adjustment is required owing to narrow therapeutic ranges. The established monitoring methods for heparin and warfarin are activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT)/anti-Xa assay and prothrombin time – international normalized ratio (PT-INR), respectively. Since 2008, new generation anticoagulant drugs, called direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), have been widely prescribed to prevent and treat several thromboembolic diseases. Although the use of DOACs without routine monitoring and frequent dose adjustment has been shown to be safe and effective, there may be clinical circumstances in specific patients when measurement of the anticoagulant effects of DOACs is required. Recently, anticoagulation therapy has received attention when treating patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In this review, we discuss the mechanisms of anticoagulant drugs—heparin, warfarin, and DOACs and describe the methods used for the measurement of their effects. In addition, we discuss the latest findings on thrombosis mechanism in patients with COVID-19 with respect to biological chemistry.","Kumano, Osamu; Akatsuchi, Kohei; Amiral, Jean",Biomedicines,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33799956/; https://doi.org/10.3390/biomedicines9030264,177

From July–November 2020, an online survey was conducted to investigate the psychosocial well-being of PLWH and changes in HIV care during the second semester of the COVID-19 outbreak. Data were collected on the socio-demographic characteristics of PLWH, their psychosocial well-being, impact of COVID-19 preventive measures on their daily routines and HIV follow-up. Of the 247 responses analyzed (mean age: 44.5 ± 13.2 years; 73.7% male), 67 (27.1%) and 69 (27.9%) respondents screened positive for anxiety (GAD-2 score ≥ 3) and depression (PHQ-2 score ≥ 3), respectively. HIV care had returned to pre-COVID-19 state for 48.6% PLWH, and 108 (43.7%) had no HIV follow-up during the past month. Over three quarters (76.1%) of respondents expressed willingness to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. Compared to previous findings in April 2020, substance use increased from 58.6% to 67.2% (p < 0.001). Our findings suggest that the well-being and medical follow-up of PLWH are still affected after almost a year into the COVID-19 outbreak.

The aim of this study was to investigate the characteristics, outcomes, and risk factors for in-hospital death of critically ill patients with COVID-19 pneumonia admitted to the ICUs of a University Hospital in Egypt. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia admitted between April 28 and July 29, 2020 to two ICUs dedicated to the isolation and treatment of patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections in Cairo University Hospitals. Diagnosis was confirmed in all patients using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction on respiratory samples and radiologic evidence of pneumonia. RESULTS: Of the 177 patients admitted to the ICUs during the study period, 160 patients had COVID-19 pneumonia and were included in the analysis (mean age: 60 ± 14 years, 67.5% males); 23% of patients had no known comorbidities. The overall ICU and hospital mortality rates were both 24.4%. The ICU and hospital lengths of stay were 7 (25–75% interquartile range: 4–10) and 10 (25–75% interquartile range: 7–14) days, respectively. In a multivariable analysis with in-hospital death as the dependent variable, ischemic heart disease, history of smoking, and secondary bacterial pneumonia were independently associated with a higher risk of in-hospital death, whereas greater PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio on admission to the ICU was associated with a lower risk. CONCLUSION: In this cohort of critically ill patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, ischemic heart disease, history of smoking, and secondary bacterial pneumonia were independently associated with a higher risk of in-hospital death.","Nassar, Yasser; Mokhtar, Ahmed; Elhadidy, Amr; Elsayed, Marwa; Mostafa, Farouk; Rady, Ashraf; Eladawy, Akram; Elshazly, Mostafa; Saeed, Mohamed; Mokhtar, Sherif; Buschbeck, Samuel; Sakr, Yasser",J Infect Public Health,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1876034121001787; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jiph.2021.06.012; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34215561/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1876034121001787?v=s5,177

We compared the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2-positive patients to SARS-CoV-2-negative patients. SARS-CoV-2 infection was confirmed in 78 (18.4%). Fever (51.2%) and cough (43.5%) were the most commonly reported signs in the SARS-CoV-2-positive patients. Isolated rhinorrhea (7.2%) was reported only in the SARS-CoV-2-negative group (p = .0014). Patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection were classified according to severity, with the percentages of asymptomatic, mild, moderate, severe, and critical cases determined to be 29.5%, 56.4%, 12.9%, 1.2%, and 0%, respectively. Of the 422 children, 128 (30.3%) underwent nasopharyngeal polymerase chain reaction testing for other respiratory viral pathogens; 21 (16.4%) were infected with viral pathogens other than SARS-CoV-2. Only one patient (4.7%) with confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) disease was coinfected with respiratory syncytial virus and rhinovirus. The results indicate lower median white blood cell, neutrophil, and lymphocyte counts, lower lactate dehydrogenase, d-dimer, and procalcitonin levels in the SARS-CoV-2-positive group (p ≤ .001).

As with other herbal remedies, the use of GB might be associated with herb–drug interactions, increasing plasma levels of other drugs and causing adverse events. Here, we present the case of a patient that developed flecainide toxicity secondary to an herb–drug interaction, associated with the use of GB to prevent COVID-19. CASE SUMMARY: A 75-year-old female presented to the emergency department with fainting. She was taking flecainide for the treatment of atrial extrasystoles diagnosed 2 years previously, and she was using a tea of GB for the prevention of COVID-19. The admission electrocardiogram showed a wide complex polymorphic tachycardia that was considered and treated as flecainide toxicity. The patient had a favourable evolution and was discharged 48 h after admission. DISCUSSION: Flecainide toxicity is uncommon and needs timely recognition and treatment; it is usually secondary to overdose and renal or hepatic failure. In our case, toxicity was associated with GB use, probably by inhibition of CYP2D6 which is the main enzyme associated with the metabolism of flecainide. Clinicians need to be aware of the possible interactions between herbal remedies (in this case used for the prevention of COVID-19) and cardiovascular drugs that are used to treat chronic cardiovascular diseases.","Guzmán, Carlos E; Guzmán-Moreno, Carla Gabriela; Assad-Morell, José Luis; Carrizales-Sepúlveda, Edgar Francisco",Eur Heart J Case Rep,https://doi.org/10.1093/ehjcr/ytab204; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34084998/,177

Ocrelizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody that selectively targets CD20+ B-cells, profoundly suppresses acute inflammatory disease activity, representing a highly effective therapy for relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). It is also the first proven therapy able to slow disability progression in primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS), particularly in patients with signs of acute radiological activity before being enrolled.

We focus on issues related to the maintenance of immunocompetence, essential to ensure an immune response to either a primary infection or a vaccination. Lastly, we discuss about the possible role of ocrelizumab as an exit strategy from natalizumab-treated patients at risk of developing multifocal progressive leukoencephalopathy.

We examined whether the MxA polymorphisms were related to the risk and severity of enterovirus 71 (EV71) infection in Chinese populations. The MxA C-123A and G-88T polymorphisms were genotyped in two independent case–control populations in China by polymerase chain reaction-based restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) analysis. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to calculate adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95 % confidence intervals (95 % CIs). MxA messenger RNA was quantified by real-time quantitative PCR in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 45 healthy children and 19 patients with EV71 infection. Significantly decreased susceptibility to EV71 infection was observed for the -123A allele and -88T allele carriers, with ORs (95 % CIs) estimated as 0.56 (0.39–0.81) and 0.64 (0.47–0.88), respectively, in the northern population. This association was confirmed in the southern population, with ORs (95 % CIs) estimated as 0.58 (0.38–0.89) and 0.67(0.47–0.95), respectively. The A(-) (123)T(-) (88) haplotype was also significantly associated with lower risk of EV71 infection in both the northern (OR = 0.62; 95 % CI = 0.44–0.85) and the southern population (OR = 0.63; 95 % CI = 0.43–0.92). Furthermore, we observed higher MxA messenger RNA levels in IFNβ1a-stimulated PBMCs from the -123A or -88T allele carriers compared with that from nocarriers.

This study presents retrospective acceptability findings from a 12-week social-identity-informed peer support intervention to enhance perceived social support among clients of an English ERS. Five peer volunteers were recruited, trained, and deployed in supervised ERS sessions across two sites. Peers assisted exercise referral officers (EROs) by providing supplementary practical, informational, motivational, and emotional support to ERS clients. Individual semi-structured interviews were conducted with peers (n = 4), EROs (n = 2), and clients (n = 5) and analysed thematically. The analysis identified three primary themes. The first theme detailed how EROs utilised peer volunteers to supplement the ERS client experience. This theme delineated peer roles within the ERS context and identified salient individual peer characteristics that contributed to their success. The second theme described peer acceptability among the various stakeholders. Peers were valued for their ability to reduce burden on EROs and to enhance perceptions of comfort among ERS clients. The final theme presented participant feedback regarding how the intervention may be further refined and enhanced. Peers represented a cost-effective and acceptable means of providing auxiliary social support to ERS clients. Moving forward, the structured integration of peers can improve the accessibility of social support among ERS participants, thus facilitating better rates of ERS completion.","Portman, Robert M.; Levy, Andrew R.; Maher, Anthony J.; Fairclough, Stuart J.",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33578966/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18041720,177

Severe COVID-19 patients often display a severe pulmonary involvement and develop neutrophilia, lymphopenia, and strikingly elevated levels of IL-6. There is an over-exuberant cytokine release with hyperferritinemia leading to the idea that COVID-19 is part of the hyperferritinemic syndrome spectrum. Indeed, very high levels of ferritin can occur in other diseases including hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, macrophage activation syndrome, adult-onset Still’s disease, catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome and septic shock. Numerous studies have demonstrated the immunomodulatory effects of ferritin and its association with mortality and sustained inflammatory process. High levels of free iron are harmful in tissues, especially through the redox damage that can lead to fibrosis. Iron chelation represents a pillar in the treatment of iron overload. In addition, it was proven to have an anti-viral and anti-fibrotic activity. Herein, we analyse the pathogenic role of ferritin and iron during SARS-CoV-2 infection and propose iron depletion therapy as a novel therapeutic approach in the COVID-19 pandemic.","Perricone, Carlo; Bartoloni, Elena; Bursi, Roberto; Cafaro, Giacomo; Guidelli, Giacomo Maria; Shoenfeld, Yehuda; Gerli, Roberto",Immunol Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32681497/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s12026-020-09145-5,177

We assessed how the type and timing of public- health interventions impacted the course of the outbreak in Alberta and other Canadian provinces. Methods: We used publicly-available data to summarize rates of laboratory data and mortality in relation to measures implemented to contain the outbreak and testing strategy. We estimated the transmission potential of SARS-CoV-2 before the state of emergency declaration for each province (R0) and at the study end date (Rt). Results: The first cases were confirmed in Ontario (January 25) and British Columbia (January 28). All provinces implemented the same health-policy measures between March 12 and March 30. Alberta had a higher percentage of the population tested (3.8%) and a lower mortality rate (3/100,000) than Ontario (2.6%; 11/100,000) or Quebec (3.1%; 31/100,000). British Columbia tested fewer people (1.7%) and had similar mortality as Alberta. Data on provincial testing strategies were insufficient to inform further analyses. Mortality rates increased with increasing rates of lab- confirmed cases in Ontario and Quebec, but not in Alberta. R0 was similar across all provinces, but varied widely from 2.6 (95% confidence intervals 1.9-3.4) to 6.4 (4.3-8.5), depending on the assumed time interval between onset of symptoms in a primary and a secondary case (serial interval). The outbreak is currently under control in Alberta, British Columbia and Nova Scotia (Rt <1). Interpretation: COVID-19-related health outcomes varied by province despite rapid implementation of similar health-policy interventions across Canada. Insufficient information about provincial testing strategies and a lack of primary data on serial interval are major limitations of existing data on the Canadian COVID-19 outbreak.","Mahsin, M.; Lee, S.; Vickers, D.; Guigue, A.; Williamson, T.; Quan, H.; Quinn, R.

686517,Fighting the Host Reaction to SARS-COv-2 in Critically Ill Patients: The Possible Contribution of Off-Label Drugs,2020-05-27,"Laboratory mice often exhibit wide differences in susceptibility when infected experimentally with viruses. Based on such observations, experiments have been designed to investigate the determinism of these differences at the molecular level, and a few genes that play a major role in the innate mechanisms of defence of the species toward viral aggressions have been characterised. For example, the extraordinary resistance of SJL mice to experimental infections with hepatitis virus strain A59 is the consequence of a structural alteration of a cell adhesion molecule which normally binds to the spikes of the virus, allowing its entry into the cells. If the virus cannot bind to the molecule, or if the molecule is absent, epithelial cells of the intestine and liver are not infected and mice are resistant. In the same way, most — not to say all — laboratory strains of mice are susceptible to infections with orthomyxoviruses or flaviviruses because essential molecules, the synthesis of which is normally triggered by interferon, are defective in these mice. Wild mice, by contrast — probably because they are constantly exposed to natural infections — are resistant. Finally, some mouse strains resist experimental infections by the mouse cytomegalovirus 1 (MCMV-1) because, once infected, these mice synthesise a molecule at the surface of infected cells which allows immediate recognition and killing by natural killer (NK) cells. With the exuberant development of mouse genetics and the constant generation of new mutant alleles, it is likely that many more genes with an impact on the phenotype of resistance or susceptibility will be identified in the forthcoming years. These genes are probably numerous, however, and many of them presumably interact with each other and/or have additive effects. This might slow down progress in our understanding of the innate mechanism of defence.","Gueńet, Jean-Louis",Brief Funct Genomic Proteomic,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16420748/,177
686645,Future Forecasting of COVID-19: A Supervised Learning Approach,2021-05-11,"BACKGROUND: Health officials face particular challenges in communicating with the public about emerging infectious diseases of unknown severity such as the 2009 H1N1(swine 'flu) pandemic (pH1N1). Statements intended to create awareness and convey the seriousness of infectious disease threats can draw accusations of scare-mongering, while officials can be accused of complacency if such statements are not made. In these communication contexts, news journalists, often reliant on official sources to understand issues are pivotal in selecting and emphasising aspects of official discourse deemed sufficiently newsworthy to present to the public. This paper presents a case-study of news communication regarding the emergence of pH1N1. METHODS: We conducted a content analysis of all television news items about pH1N1. We examined news and current affairs items broadcast on 5 free-to-air Sydney television channels between April 25 2009 (the first report) and October 9 (prior to the vaccine release) for statements about [1] the seriousness of the disease [2] how the public could minimise contagion [3] government responses to emerging information. RESULTS: pH1N1 was the leading health story for eight of 24 weeks and was in the top 5 for 20 weeks. 353 news items were identified, yielding 3086 statements for analysis, with 63.4% related to the seriousness of the situation, 12.9% providing advice for viewers and 23.6% involving assurances from government. Coverage focused on infection/mortality rates, the spread of the virus, the need for public calm, the vulnerability of particular groups, direct and indirect advice for viewers, and government reassurances about effective management. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the reporting of 2009 pH1N1 in Sydney, Australia was generally non-alarmist, while conveying that pH1N1 was potentially serious. Daily infection rate tallies and commentary on changes in the pandemic alert level were seldom contextualised to assist viewers in understanding personal relevance. Suggestions are made about how future reporting of emerging infectious diseases could be enhanced.","Fogarty, Andrea S; Holland, Kate; Imison, Michelle; Blood, R Warwick; Chapman, Simon; Holding, Simon",BMC Public Health,https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2458-11-181; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21435263/,177
688646,Home is where the safer ground is: the need to promote affordable housing laws and policies in receiving communities,2021-06-16,"Many reports by physicians and patients during the 2019 to 2020 pandemic indicate that COVID-19 is associated with elevated levels of odor and taste perception disorders (anosmia, hyposmia, ageusia, and/or dysgeusia). Recent increase in olfactory dysfunction in patients referred to ear nose and throat clinics and COVID-19 infection at the same time encouraged us to examine anosmic/hyposmic patients to establish any association between these signs. It has been shown that the COVID-19 virus exploits the uses angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor to obtain cell entry. This result increases the interest to examine the expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 in neurological tissue, and to assess the possible contribution of damage. This mini review provides fundamental knowledge on coincidence of COVID-19 infection and smell—taste perception disorders from an objective perspective.","Cetinkaya, Erdem Atalay",J Craniofac Surg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32398625/; https://doi.org/10.1097/scs.0000000000006601,177
689535,A review of machine learning experiments in equity investment decision-making: why most published research findings do not live up to their promise in real life,2021-04-05,"Background: Mass spectrometry (MS) is a suitable technology for microorganism identification and characterization. Content: This review summarizes the MS-based methods currently used for the analyses of pathogens. Direct analysis of whole pathogenic microbial cells using MS without sample fractionation reveals specific biomarkers for taxonomy and provides rapid and high-throughput capabilities. MS coupled with various chromatography- and affinity-based techniques simplifies the complexity of the signals of the microbial biomarkers and provides more accurate results. Affinity-based methods, including those employing nanotechnology, can be used to concentrate traces of target microorganisms from sample solutions and, thereby, improve detection limits. Approaches combining amplification of nucleic acid targets from pathogens with MS-based detection are alternatives to biomarker analyses. Many data analysis methods, including multivariate analysis and bioinformatics approaches, have been developed for microbial identification. The review concludes with some current clinical applications of MS in the identification and typing of infectious microorganisms, as well as some perspectives. Summary: Advances in instrumentation (separation and mass analysis), ionization techniques, and biological methodologies will all enhance the capabilities of MS for the analysis of pathogens.","Ho, Yen-Peng; Reddy, P Muralidhar",Clin Chem,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20167691/; https://doi.org/10.1373/clinchem.2009.138867,177

This study aimed to examine the mediating effect of chronic illnesses in the relationship between psychological health and the acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccine, prior to the national vaccine rollout in Malaysia. An online cross-sectional study was conducted in Malaysia between December 10, 2020, and February 9, 2021. In addition to the descriptive analyses, a mediation analysis was performed to examine the mediating effect of chronic illnesses in the relationship between psychological distress and the willingness to accept the vaccine. A total of 1738 participants completed the survey. The psychological distress levels were found to be significantly different across demographic factors such as age, gender, and social economic status. This study demonstrated a partial mediating effect of chronic illnesses in the relationship between psychological distress and vaccine acceptance.","Chen, Won Sun; Siau, Ching Sin; Bono, Suzanna Awang; Low, Wah Yun",Asia Pac J Public Health,https://doi.org/10.1177/10105395211047868; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34550027/,177
