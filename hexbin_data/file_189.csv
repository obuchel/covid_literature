457,457,457,Network Analysis of Global Influenza Spread,11.454282,4.8478136,2010-11-18,"Although vaccines pose the best means of preventing influenza infection, strain selection and optimal implementation remain difficult due to antigenic drift and a lack of understanding global spread. Detecting viral movement by sequence analysis is complicated by skewed geographic and seasonal distributions in viral isolates. We propose a probabilistic method that accounts for sampling bias through spatiotemporal clustering and modeling regional and seasonal transmission as a binomial process. Analysis of H3N2 not only confirmed East-Southeast Asia as a source of new seasonal variants, but also increased the resolution of observed transmission to a country level. H1N1 data revealed similar viral spread from the tropics. Network analysis suggested China and Hong Kong as the origins of new seasonal H3N2 strains and the United States as a region where increased vaccination would maximally disrupt global spread of the virus. These techniques provide a promising methodology for the analysis of any seasonal virus, as well as for the continued surveillance of influenza.","Chan, Joseph; Holmes, Antony; Rabadan, Raul",PLoS Comput Biol,189,1
1184,1184,1184,Towards Systematic Discovery of Signaling Networks in Budding Yeast Filamentous Growth Stress Response Using Interventional Phosphorylation Data,11.253325,4.78131,2013-06-27,"Reversible phosphorylation is one of the major mechanisms of signal transduction, and signaling networks are critical regulators of cell growth and development. However, few of these networks have been delineated completely. Towards this end, quantitative phosphoproteomics is emerging as a useful tool enabling large-scale determination of relative phosphorylation levels. However, phosphoproteomics differs from classical proteomics by a more extensive sampling limitation due to the limited number of detectable sites per protein. Here, we propose a comprehensive quantitative analysis pipeline customized for phosphoproteome data from interventional experiments for identifying key proteins in specific pathways, discovering the protein-protein interactions and inferring the signaling network. We also made an effort to partially compensate for the missing value problem, a chronic issue for proteomics studies. The dataset used for this study was generated using SILAC (Stable Isotope Labeling with Amino acids in Cell culture) technique with interventional experiments (kinase-dead mutations). The major components of the pipeline include phosphopeptide meta-analysis, correlation network analysis and causal relationship discovery. We have successfully applied our pipeline to interventional experiments identifying phosphorylation events underlying the transition to a filamentous growth form in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We identified 5 high-confidence proteins from meta-analysis, and 19 hub proteins from correlation analysis (Pbi2p and Hsp42p were identified by both analyses). All these proteins are involved in stress responses. Nine of them have direct or indirect evidence of involvement in filamentous growth. In addition, we tested four of our predicted proteins, Nth1p, Pbi2p, Pdr12p and Rcn2p, by interventional phenotypic experiments and all of them present differential invasive growth, providing prospective validation of our approach. This comprehensive pipeline presents a systematic way for discovering signaling networks using interventional phosphoproteome data and can suggest candidate proteins for further investigation. We anticipate the methodology to be applicable as well to other interventional studies via different experimental platforms.","Zhang, Yan; Kweon, Hye Kyong; Shively, Christian; Kumar, Anuj; Andrews, Philip C.",PLoS Comput Biol,189,1

An important challenge in infectious disease research is to understand molecular similarities and differences in mammalian host response to diverse sets of pathogens. Recently, systems biology studies have produced rich collections of omic profiles measuring host response to infectious agents such as influenza viruses at multiple levels. To gain a comprehensive understanding of the regulatory network driving host response to multiple infectious agents, we integrated host transcriptomes and proteomes using a network-based approach. Our approach combines expression-based regulatory network inference, structured-sparsity based regression, and network information flow to infer putative physical regulatory programs for expression modules. We applied our approach to identify regulatory networks, modules and subnetworks that drive host response to multiple influenza infections. The inferred regulatory network and modules are significantly enriched for known pathways of immune response and implicate apoptosis, splicing, and interferon signaling processes in the differential response of viral infections of different pathogenicities. We used the learned network to prioritize regulators and study virus and time-point specific networks. RNAi-based knockdown of predicted regulators had significant impact on viral replication and include several previously unknown regulators. Taken together, our integrated analysis identified novel module level patterns that capture strain and pathogenicity-specific patterns of expression and helped identify important regulators of host response to influenza infection.","Chasman, Deborah; Walters, Kevin B.; Lopes, Tiago J.

2337,2337,2337,"The Role of Phlebovirus Glycoproteins in Viral Entry, Assembly and Release",11.447767,7.2168965,2016-07-21,"Bunyaviruses are enveloped viruses with a tripartite RNA genome that can pose a serious threat to animal and human health. Members of the Phlebovirus genus of the family Bunyaviridae are transmitted by mosquitos and ticks to humans and include highly pathogenic agents like Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) and severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus (SFTSV) as well as viruses that do not cause disease in humans, like Uukuniemi virus (UUKV). Phleboviruses and other bunyaviruses use their envelope proteins, Gn and Gc, for entry into target cells and for assembly of progeny particles in infected cells. Thus, binding of Gn and Gc to cell surface factors promotes viral attachment and uptake into cells and exposure to endosomal low pH induces Gc-driven fusion of the viral and the vesicle membranes. Moreover, Gn and Gc facilitate virion incorporation of the viral genome via their intracellular domains and Gn and Gc interactions allow the formation of a highly ordered glycoprotein lattice on the virion surface. Studies conducted in the last decade provided important insights into the configuration of phlebovirus Gn and Gc proteins in the viral membrane, the cellular factors used by phleboviruses for entry and the mechanisms employed by phlebovirus Gc proteins for membrane fusion. Here, we will review our knowledge on the glycoprotein biogenesis and the role of Gn and Gc proteins in the phlebovirus replication cycle.","Spiegel, Martin; Plegge, Teresa; Pöhlmann, Stefan",Viruses,189,1
3723,3723,3723,Endemicity and prevalence of multipartite viruses under heterogeneous between-host transmission,11.554189,4.691877,2019-03-18,"Multipartite viruses replicate through a puzzling evolutionary strategy. Their genome is segmented into two or more parts, and encapsidated in separate particles that appear to propagate independently. Completing the replication cycle, however, requires the full genome, so that a systemic infection of a host requires the concurrent presence of several particles. This represents an apparent evolutionary drawback of multipartitism, while its advantages remain unclear. A transition from monopartite to multipartite viral forms has been described in vitro under conditions of high multiplicity of infection, suggesting that cooperation between defective mutants is a plausible evolutionary pathway towards multipartitism. However, it is unknown how the putative advantages that multipartitism might enjoy at the microscopic level affect its epidemiology, or if an explicit advantange is needed to explain its ecological persistence. In order to disentangle which mechanisms might contribute to the rise and fixation of multipartitism, we here investigate the interaction between viral spreading dynamics and host population structure. We set up a compartmental model of the spread of a virus in its different forms and explore its epidemiology using both analytical and numerical techniques. We uncover that the impact of host contact structure on spreading dynamics entails a rich phenomenology of ecological relationships that includes cooperation, competition, and commensality. Furthermore, we find out that multipartitism might rise to fixation even in the absence of explicit microscopic advantages. Multipartitism allows the virus to colonize environments that could not be invaded by the monopartite form, while homogeneous contacts between hosts facilitate its spread. We conjecture that these features might have led to an increase in the diversity and prevalence of multipartite viral forms concomitantly with the expansion of agricultural practices.","Valdano, Eugenio; Manrubia, Susanna; Gómez, Sergio; Arenas, Alex",PLoS Comput Biol,189,1
3977,3977,3977,Recombinant vector vaccine evolution,11.375866,4.8663344,2019-07-19,"Replicating recombinant vector vaccines consist of a fully competent viral vector backbone engineered to express an antigen from a foreign transgene. From the perspective of viral replication, the transgene is not only dispensable but may even be detrimental. Thus vaccine revertants that delete or inactivate the transgene may evolve to dominate the vaccine virus population both during the process of manufacture of the vaccine as well as during the course of host infection. A particular concern is that this vaccine evolution could reduce its antigenicity—the immunity elicited to the transgene. We use mathematical and computational models to study vaccine evolution and immunity. These models include evolution arising during the process of manufacture, the dynamics of vaccine and revertant growth, plus innate and adaptive immunity elicited during the course of infection. Although the selective basis of vaccine evolution is easy to comprehend, the immunological consequences are not. One complication is that the opportunity for vaccine evolution is limited by the short period of within-host growth before the viral population is cleared. Even less obvious, revertant growth may only weakly interfere with vaccine growth in the host and thus have a limited effect on immunity to vaccine. Overall, we find that within-host vaccine evolution can sometimes compromise vaccine immunity, but only when the extent of evolution during vaccine manufacture is severe, and this evolution can be easily avoided or mitigated.","Bull, James J.; Nuismer, Scott L.; Antia, Rustom",PLoS Comput Biol,189,1
4006,4006,4006,Epitope-based vaccine as a universal vaccination strategy against Toxoplasma gondii infection: A mini-review,11.237718,6.552842,2019-03-24,"Despite the significant progress in the recent efforts toward developing an effective vaccine against toxoplasmosis, the search for new protective vaccination strategy still remains a challenge and elusive goal because it becomes the appropriate way to prevent the disease. Various experimental approaches in the past few years showed that developing a potential vaccine against the disease can be achievable. The combination of multi-epitopes expressing different stages of the parasite life cycle has become an optimal strategy for acquiring a potent, safe, and effective vaccine. Epitope-based vaccines have gained attention as alternative vaccine candidates due to their ability of inducing protective immune responses. This mini-review highlights the current status and the prospects of Toxoplasma gondii vaccine development along with the application of epitope-based vaccine in the future parasite immunization as a novel under development and evaluation strategy.","Hajissa, Khalid; Zakaria, Robaiza; Suppian, Rapeah; Mohamed, Zeehaida",J Adv Vet Anim Res,189,1
4058,4058,4058,Unified feature association networks through integration of transcriptomic and proteomic data,11.481587,4.9494286,2019-09-17,"High-throughput multi-omics studies and corresponding network analyses of multi-omic data have rapidly expanded their impact over the last 10 years. As biological features of different types (e.g. transcripts, proteins, metabolites) interact within cellular systems, the greatest amount of knowledge can be gained from networks that incorporate multiple types of -omic data. However, biological and technical sources of variation diminish the ability to detect cross-type associations, yielding networks dominated by communities comprised of nodes of the same type. We describe here network building methods that can maximize edges between nodes of different data types leading to integrated networks, networks that have a large number of edges that link nodes of different–omic types (transcripts, proteins, lipids etc). We systematically rank several network inference methods and demonstrate that, in many cases, using a random forest method, GENIE3, produces the most integrated networks. This increase in integration does not come at the cost of accuracy as GENIE3 produces networks of approximately the same quality as the other network inference methods tested here. Using GENIE3, we also infer networks representing antibody-mediated Dengue virus cell invasion and receptor-mediated Dengue virus invasion. A number of functional pathways showed centrality differences between the two networks including genes responding to both GM-CSF and IL-4, which had a higher centrality value in an antibody-mediated vs. receptor-mediated Dengue network. Because a biological system involves the interplay of many different types of molecules, incorporating multiple data types into networks will improve their use as models of biological systems. The methods explored here are some of the first to specifically highlight and address the challenges associated with how such multi-omic networks can be assembled and how the greatest number of interactions can be inferred from different data types. The resulting networks can lead to the discovery of new host response patterns and interactions during viral infection, generate new hypotheses of pathogenic mechanisms and confirm mechanisms of disease.","McClure, Ryan S.; Wendler, Jason P.; Adkins, Joshua N.; Swanstrom, Jesica; Baric, Ralph; Kaiser, Brooke L.

One of them is the architecture of their genomic folds, which must not only feature precise structural elements at specific positions, but also allow for overall spatial compactness. The latter was shown to be disrupted by random synonymous mutations, a disruption which can consequently negatively affect genome encapsidation. In this study, we use three mutation schemes with different degrees of locality to mutate the genomes of phage MS2 and Brome Mosaic virus in order to understand the observed sensitivity of the global compactness of their folds. We find that mutating local stretches of their genomes’ sequence or structure is less disruptive to their compactness compared to inducing randomly-distributed mutations. Our findings are indicative of a mechanism for the conservation of compactness acting on a global scale of the genomes, and have several implications for understanding the interplay between local and global architecture of viral RNA genomes.","Lošdorfer Božič, Anže; Micheletti, Cristian; Podgornik, Rudolf; Tubiana, Luca",J Phys Condens Matter,189,1

In this work we employ the self-consistent field theory (SCFT) to investigate the adsorption of RNA onto positively charged spherical viral shells and examine the conditions when GSDA does not apply and SCFT has to be used to obtain a reliable solution. We find that there are two regimes in which GSDA does work. First, when the genomic RNA length is long enough compared to the capsid radius, and second, when the interaction between the genome and capsid is so strong that the genome is basically localized next to the wall. We find that for the case in which RNA is more or less distributed uniformly in the shell, regardless of the length of RNA, GSDA is not a good approximation. We observe that as the polymer–shell interaction becomes stronger, the energy gap between the ground state and first excited state increases and thus GSDA becomes a better approximation. We also present our results corresponding to the genome persistence length obtained through the tangent–tangent correlation length and show that it is zero in case of GSDA but is equal to the inverse of the energy gap when using SCFT.","Li, Siyu; Orland, Henri; Zandi, Roya",J Phys Condens Matter,189,1

Systematic studies about cell behavior as a response to specific nanoparticle properties are scarce in the literature even when they are necessary for the rational design of medical nanodevices. Information in the literature shows that the physicochemical properties determine the bioactivity, biocompatibility, and safety of nanomaterials. The information available regarding the interaction and responses of cells to nanomaterials has not been analyzed and discussed in a single document. Hence, in this review, we present the latest advances about cellular responses to nanomaterials and integrate the available information into concrete considerations for the development of innovative, efficient, specific and, more importantly, safe biomedical nanodevices. We focus on how physicochemical nanoparticle properties (size, chemical surface, shape, charge, and topography) influence cell behavior in a first attempt to provide a practical guide for designing medical nanodevices, avoiding common experimental omissions that may lead to data misinterpretation. Finally, we emphasize the importance of the systematic study of nano–bio interactions to acquire sufficient reproducible information that allows accurate control of cell behavior based on tuning of nanomaterial properties. This information is useful to guide the design of specific nanodevices and nanomaterials to elicit desired cell responses, like targeting, drug delivery, cell attachment, differentiation, etc, or to avoid undesired side effects.","Villanueva-Flores, Francisca; Castro-Lugo, Andrés; Ramírez, Octavio T; Palomares, Laura A",Nanotechnology,189,1

The main cellular sources of lung NO production are the vascular endothelium and the airway epithelia (Bohle et al. 2000; German et al. 2000; Ide et al. 1999). Local NO production contributes to regulation of pulmonary perfusion depending on alveolar ventilation to assure optimized ventilation/perfusion distribution (Grimminger et al. 1995). NO-synthase activity is regulated on transcriptional and post-translational redox-based modulation level. The common signaling pathway of endogenous vasodilators, such as nitric oxide, prostaglandins, and natriuretic peptides, engage cyclic nucleotides (cAMP and cGMP). These second messengers are mainly produced by activation of adenylate- and guanylate-cyclases, both membrane-bound and soluble (Beavo 1995). Phosphodiesterases (PDEs) represent a superfamily of enzymes, with PDE1 through PDE11 being currently known, that inactivate cyclic AMP and cyclic GMP, with different tissue distribution and substrate specificities (Ahn et al. 1991; Von Euler and Liljestrand. 1946). Because of stabilization of these second messengers, PDE inhibitors differentially regulate levels of cAMP and/or cGMP, depending on their selectivity profile. Recently, direct activators and stimulators of the sGC have been suggested as new therapeutic tools for the treatment of lung vascular disorders that might have even higher potency than PDE inhibitors or exogenously applied NO.","Ghofrani, Hossein-Ardeschir; Grimminger, Friedrich","cGMP: Generators, Effectors and Therapeutic Implications",189,1

Knight reported in 1975 that it is impossible to discern with any degree of certainty the degree of force used to create a stab wound. Despite this, expert witnesses continue to approximate the degree of force used for their reports and evidence in court. It is usually subjectively categorized as mild, moderate or severe, based solely on the examination of the wound. We undertook a study considering forces generated in a range of blunt trauma actions, using a novel force plate dynamometer to measure the peak forces obtained by adult male and female volunteers. We then studied forces generated by stabbing skin simulants and porcine samples with knives and screwdrivers. Men generated more force than women during stabbings which was found to be equivalent to somewhere between the blunt trauma actions of pushing a button to a single-handed push. When asked to stab using what they thought was mild, moderate and severe force, although volunteers were able to actively decide the force used, the actual force was found to be influenced by the weapon, sex of the individual, hand used and biological/anatomical site penetrated. This study shows that the forces generated by volunteers in mild, moderate and severe stabbing tests in almost all cases were significantly greater than the forces required for skin penetration. We suggest that the use of subjective force scales is inappropriate. Rather than use of a subjective scale, we suggest that the force required in any stabbing requires investigation in four areas: the tip radius of the weapon, minimal force required for penetration, the sex of the assailant and whether the force required for penetration is greater than that that can be generated by a person stabbing. This allows for the use of an evidence-based two-tier scale to suggest the force required.

In addition to the assessment of various psychosocial outcomes, a comprehensive health-economic evaluation will be performed. DISCUSSION: This paper describes the implementation and evaluation of two family-based intervention programs for Children Affected by Rare Disease and their Family’s Network (CARE-FAM-NET) in German standard care. A methodologically challenging study design is used to reflect the complexity of the actual medical care situation. This trial could be an important contribution to the improvement of care for this highly burdened group.

In addition, there have been very few prediction studies on TB incidence here. We; therefore, considered it a high priority to do prediction analysis of TB incidence in Kashgar, and so provide a scientific reference for eventual prevention and control. DESIGN: Time series study. SETTING KASHGAR, CHINA: Kashgar, China. METHODS: We used a single Box-Jenkins method and a Box-Jenkins and Elman neural network (ElmanNN) hybrid method to do prediction analysis of TB incidence in Kashgar. Root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) were used to measure the prediction accuracy. RESULTS: After careful analysis, the single autoregression (AR) (1, 2, 8) model and the AR (1, 2, 8)-ElmanNN (AR-Elman) hybrid model were established, and the optimal neurons value of the AR-Elman hybrid model is 6. In the fitting dataset, the RMSE, MAE and MAPE were 6.15, 4.33 and 0.2858, respectively, for the AR (1, 2, 8) model, and 3.78, 3.38 and 0.1837, respectively, for the AR-Elman hybrid model. In the forecasting dataset, the RMSE, MAE and MAPE were 10.88, 8.75 and 0.2029, respectively, for the AR (1, 2, 8) model, and 8.86, 7.29 and 0.2006, respectively, for the AR-Elman hybrid model. CONCLUSIONS: Both the single AR (1, 2, 8) model and the AR-Elman model could be used to predict the TB incidence in Kashgar, but the modelling and validation scale-dependent measures (RMSE, MAE and MAPE) in the AR (1, 2, 8) model were inferior to those in the AR-Elman hybrid model, which indicated that the AR-Elman hybrid model was better than the AR (1, 2, 8) model. The Box-Jenkins and ElmanNN hybrid method therefore can be highlighted in predicting the temporal trends of TB incidence in Kashgar, which may act as the potential for far-reaching implications for prevention and control of TB.","Zheng, Yanling; Zhang, Xueliang; Wang, Xijiang; Wang, Kai; Cui, Yan",BMJ Open,189,13

Inflammasome activation has been reported to play a critical role in the initiation and progression of ALI. The molecular mechanisms involved in regulating the activation of inflammasome in ALI remains unresolved, although increases in mitochondrial derived reactive oxygen species (mito-ROS) are involved. Our previous work has shown that the mitochondrial redistribution of uncoupled eNOS impairs mitochondrial bioenergetics and increases mito-ROS generation. Thus, the focus of our study was to determine if lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-mediated inflammasome activation involves the mitochondrial redistribution of uncoupled eNOS. Our data show that the increase in mito-ROS involved in LPS-mediated inflammasome activation is associated with the disruption of mitochondrial bioenergetics in human lung microvascular endothelial cells (HLMVEC) and the mitochondrial redistribution of eNOS. These effects are dependent on RhoA-ROCK signaling and are mediated via increased phosphorylation of eNOS at Threonine (T)-495. A derivative of the mitochondrial targeted Szeto‐Schiller peptide (SSP) attached to the antioxidant Tiron (T-SSP), significantly attenuated LPS-mediated mito-ROS generation and inflammasome activation in HLMVEC. Further, T-SSP attenuated mitochondrial superoxide production in a mouse model of sepsis induced ALI. This in turn significantly reduced the inflammatory response and attenuated lung injury. Thus, our findings show that the mitochondrial redistribution of uncoupled eNOS is intimately involved in the activation of the inflammatory response in ALI and implicate attenuating mito-ROS as a therapeutic strategy in humans.","Wang, Hui; Sun, Xutong; Lu, Qing; Zemskov, Evgeny A.; Yegambaram, Manivannan; Wu, Xiaomin; Wang, Ting; Tang, Haiyang; Black, Stephen M.",Redox Biol,189,1

Extraction from a dietary supplement was performed to isolate the compounds by HPLC analysis. The structural characterization was confirmed using mass spectrometry (ESI-TOF/MS and LC-MS/MS), (1)H NMR, and (13)C NMR spectroscopy techniques. Results identified the thus-obtained compound to be sulfoaildenafil, a thioketone analogue of sildenafil. The biological activities of this active compound have been focused for the first time by the experimental point of view performance in vitro. The results revealed that sulfoaildenafil can affect the therapeutic level of nitric oxide through the upregulation of nitric oxide synthase and phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) gene expressions. This bulk material, which displays structural similarity to sildenafil, was analyzed for the presence of a PDE5 inhibitor using a theoretical calculation. These unique features of the potential activity of PDE5 protein and its inhibitors, sildenafil and sulfoaildenafil, may play a key consideration for understanding the mode of actions and predicting the biological activities of PDE5 inhibitors.","Kodchakorn, Kanchanok; Viriyakhasem, Nawarat; Wongwichai, Tunchanok; Kongtawelert, Prachya",Molecules,189,1

Two decades later, no gold standard T2DM prevention intervention has been established for this population. OBJECTIVE: This study tests the efficacy of a telehealth diabetes prevention intervention for African American (AA) families with children with risk for T2DM. Concurrently, investigators aim to evaluate an implementation strategy for the uptake of the intervention by the University of Mississippi Medical Center’s (UMMC) pediatric weight management clinic. METHODS: This single-arm trial will enroll 20 parents with overweight or obesity of children (8-11 years) with overweight or obesity, both of whom are at risk for T2DM. Parents will meet in small groups (5 parents per group) weekly for 11 weeks and then monthly for 4 monthly maintenance sessions via videoconference using Wi-Fi–enabled iPads with cellular connectivity. The intervention will be adapted from the National Diabetes Prevention Program and Power to Prevent, a diabetes prevention program tailored for AA families. The same lifestyle intervention facilitated by a racially concordant lifestyle coach trained in the Diabetes Prevention Program will be delivered to all groups (n=4). Participants will be recruited in-person during patient encounters at the UMMC’s pediatric weight management clinic. Sessions will consist of dietary and physical activity behavior change strategies facilitated using problem-solving and goal-setting skills. The implementation strategy has 2 targets: the pediatric weight management clinic site and clinical team and parents of children at risk for T2DM engaged in intensive obesity treatment to prevent T2DM. The multifaceted implementation protocol includes 4 discrete strategies: creating a new clinical team, changing the service site, intervening with families, and promoting organizational readiness for change. RESULTS: Recruitment and enrollment began in December 2020, and the intervention is scheduled to be delivered to the first cohort of parents in March 2021. The results are expected to be submitted for publication beginning in November 2021 through 2022. The primary outcome measure for the pilot trial will include changes from baseline to 12 and 30 weeks in the child BMI z score and parent BMI. The implementation evaluation will include multiple measures of feasibility, acceptability, appropriateness, fidelity, and efficacy. This protocol was approved by the UMMC’s Institutional Review Board (#2020V0249). CONCLUSIONS: The proposed intervention approach is supported by the scientific literature and is scalable given the current and future health care subsidies for telehealth. Findings from this pilot trial will begin to address critical barriers to defining a gold standard lifestyle intervention for AA families with children at risk for T2DM. If effective, the intervention could be feasibly disseminated to treat obesity and prevent T2DM in high-risk AA pediatric populations.

The temperature-dependent adsorption isotherms, obtained by SHG measurements, provide information on adsorbate concentration, free energy of adsorption, and associated changes in enthalpy and entropy, showing that the adsorption process is exothermic, resulting in increased overall entropy. Additionally, the molecular transport kinetics are found to be more rapid under higher temperatures. Corresponding MD simulations are used to calculate the free energy profiles of the adsorption and the molecular orientation distributions of MG at different temperatures, showing excellent agreement with the experimental results.","Hamal, Prakash; Subasinghege Don, Visal; Nguyenhuu, Huy; Ranasinghe, Jeewan C.; Nauman, Julia A.; McCarley, Robin L.; Kumar, Revati; Haber, Louis H.",J Phys Chem B,189,1

With the presently accepted masses of Triton and Pluto–Charon(2,3), however, the momentum and energy exchange that would be required to set Triton on a retrograde trajectory is impossible. The mass of Triton has probably been seriously overestimated(4,5), but not by enough to relax this restriction. It is implausible that the present angular momentum state of Pluto–Charon has been significantly influenced by Neptune(6). It could not acquire such angular momentum during an ejection event unless a physical collision was involved, which is quite unlikely. The simplest hypothesis is that Triton and Pluto are independent representatives of large outer Solar System planetesimals. Triton is simply captured, with potentially spectacular consequences that include runaway melting of interior ices and release to the surface of clathrated CH(4), CO and N(2) (ref. 7). Condensed remnants of this proto-atmosphere could account for features in Triton's unique spectrum(8–11).","McKinnon, William B.",Nature,189,1

RVIs often present with nonspecific symptoms and currently lack effective treatments (Baraldi et al., Ital J Pediatr. 40:65, 2014). Death due to viral bronchiolitis is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in developing nations and industrialized nations alike, and patients with bronchiolitis frequently require intensive care and use of mechanical ventilation (Thompson et al., JAMA 289:179–186, 2003). Infants who acquire RVI during their birth hospitalizations have significantly longer length of stay and are more likely to develop chronic respiratory disease, particularly bronchopulmonary dysplasia (Bennett et al., J Pediatr 161:814–818, 2012). Furthermore, infants with RVIs are often placed on empiric antibiotic therapy, which can frustrate antimicrobial stewardship efforts (Bennett et al., J Pediatr 161:814–818, 2012; Cantey et al., Lancet Infect Dis 2016;16:1178–1184). RVIs are also associated with increased costs to both health systems and families due to increased care and lost productivity. In 2016, Zinna et al. (Pediatrics 138:e20161675, 2016) showed that infants with hospital-acquired RVI in the United Kingdom had hospital charges more than double those of uninfected infants. Similarly, the Sentinel-1 Study (Anderson et al., Am J Perinatol 34:51–61, 2017) in the United States demonstrated that each hospitalization for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), the most common etiological agent of viral bronchiolitis in children age <1 year, costs more than $55,000, even excluding the additional outpatient visits before and after hospitalization.

This chapter aims to rectify the oversight in pandemic preparedness plans by presenting a compendium of guidelines and recommendations by international health organisations, pandemic fatality experts, and experienced mass death management professionals. Its objective is to have available a mass fatality framework to complement the WHO Pandemic Influenza Preparedness and Response (2009) guideline, from which individual national pandemic preparedness plans are based. It is written in a format that incorporates WHO’s emphasis on finding the ethical balance between human rights and successful plan implementation; the assimilation of national pandemic plans with existing national emergency measures; and the ‘whole group’ system of engaging individuals, families, localities, and business establishments in the process.

However, studies have shown that mobile learning (m-learning) can be used to mitigate the challenges of STEM education. Despite, the benefits of mobile learning to rural STEM learners, its full potential has not been realized because the adoption of m-learning depends on users’ acceptance. Prior studies focused on teachers’ and learners’ acceptance of mobile learning. However, little is known about parents’ acceptance of m-learning, especially in rural areas. This study explores the acceptance of m-learning by parents of rural high school STEM learners. The study proposes the parents’ acceptance of m-learning model, which extends the technology acceptance model by introducing perceived social influence and perceived resources. Stratified random sampling was used to select 200 parents in the survey. Partial least squares structural equation modeling (PSL-SEM) was used to analyze data from 129 valid questionnaires. The proposed model explained 41% of the variance in parents’ acceptance of mobile learning. Attitude towards the use was found to be the best predictor and the only factor that have a direct effect on behavioral intention to use mobile learning. However, all other factors have an indirect influence on behavioral intention. The findings revealed that for mobile learning to be successfully implemented in rural areas, resources need to be provided.","Mutambara, David; Bayaga, Anass","Responsible Design, Implementation and Use of Information and Communication Technology",189,33

About 80% of house dust mite (HDM) allergic individuals are reactive to this protease in standard assays for detection of IgE. A curative treatment for atopic allergy is immunotherapy (IT) with HDM extracts which are complex mixtures occasionally resulting in anaphylactic reactions. Novozymes focuses on developing a recombinant variant of Der p1 which exhibit lowered risk of IgE‐mediated allergic reactions, while maintaining its ability to trigger proper Th‐cell responses. This may provide a safer alternative for specific IT of HDM allergy. A secreted recombinant form of pro‐Der p 1 expressed by Saccharamyces cerevisiae was obtained by fusion of the pro‐enzyme to a fungal signal peptide. The N‐glycosylation site of Der p1 was mutated resulting in a deglycosylated pro‐enzyme with a molecular mass of 35 kDa. Protein purification procedure was developed to obtain nearly pure Der p1 protein followed by determination of concentration by active‐site‐titration with the cysteine protease inhibitor E64. The deglycosylated recombinant pro‐Der p 1 revealed immunologic similarity to the native Der p 1 molecule when compared in basophile histamine release, IgE‐binding assays and T‐cell proliferation assays. By in silico epitope mapping of a modelled 3‐dimensional structure of Der p1, five putative IgG and IgE epitopes were predicted. By protein engineering, the predicted epitopes were removed one by one in Der p1 and screening for hypoallergenic variants was performed.","Draborg, H.; Roggen, E. L.; Soni, N.

One potential mechanism by which these microorganisms may cause PPROM is by increasing the concentration of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) in the membranes and amniotic fluid. We tested this hypothesis in a well‐defined model system of genital infection with M. pulmonis, a natural reproductive pathogen of rats. METHOD OF STUDY: Timed‐pregnant, specific pathogen‐free, Sprague–Dawley rats were infected with 10(7) CFU M. pulmonis at gestation day (gd) 14. Controls received an equivalent volume (100 μL) of sterile medium. At gd 18, rats were euthanized, and membranes and amniotic fluids were harvested and stored at −70°C until analysis. Proteinase activity of amniotic fluid and membranes was resolved on discontinuous 7.5% sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gelatin zymography gels. Band intensity was determined using a digital gel documentation system and the manufacturer's software (Kodak). RESULTS: Gelatinolytic activity associated with a band similar in molecular weight to ProMMP‐9 (92 kDa, the inactive precursor of MMP‐9) was significantly increased in amniotic fluids and membranes harvested from M. pulmonis‐treated pups at gd 18 when compared with tissues harvested from control pups. Both ProMMP‐9 and ProMMP‐2 (72 kDa, the inactive precursor of MMP‐2) were increased in infected animals at gd 21. CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that the genital mycoplasmas can increase MMP‐9 production in vivo.","Peltier, Morgan R.; Barney, Brandon M.; Brown, Mary B.",Am J Reprod Immunol,189,8

The world requires a global system that can identify and contain public health emergencies rapidly and reduce panic and disruption of trade, travel, and society in general. Strengthening public health preparedness requires establishing an integrated global alert and response system for epidemics and other public health emergencies along the lines of the World Health Organization’s International Health Regulations. The revised International Health Regulations provide a global framework to address these needs through a collective approach to the prevention, detection, and timely response to any public health emergency of international concern. A standardized approach for readiness and response to major epidemic-prone diseases should be developed. An early-warning and rapid-alert system is one of the possibilities to improve readiness at the local, regional, national, and international level to limit the spread of disease and to reduce health, economic, and social damage. The Republic of Macedonia, with World Health Organization support, has implemented an earlywarning system (ALERT) for priority communicable diseases to complement the routine surveillance system that reports individual confirmed cases. ALERT relies on reporting of eight syndromes by primary care facilities. Data are analyzed weekly at the regional level and transmitted to national epidemiologists. It is perceived to be a simple and flexible tool for detecting and triggering timely investigation and control of outbreaks. ALERT was identified as a useful instrument for forecasting and detecting the start of the influenza season.","Stikova, Elisaveta; Gjorgjev, Dragan; Karadzovski, Zarko",Emerging and Endemic Pathogens,189,1

We present a general, systematic approach that combines new and existing data mining and instructional design methods to redesign intelligent tutors. Our approach is driven by the main goal of identifying knowledge components that are demonstrably difficult for students to learn and to optimize effective and efficient practice of them. We applied this approach to redesigning an algebraic symbolization tutor. Our classroom study with 76 high school freshmen shows that, compared to the original tutor, the redesigned tutor led to higher learning efficiency on more difficult skills, higher learning gain on unscaffolded whole tasks, and more robust transfer to less practiced tasks. Our work provides general guidance for performing design-loop adaptations for continuous improvement of intelligent tutors.","Huang, Yun; Aleven, Vincent; McLaughlin, Elizabeth; Koedinger, Kenneth",Artificial Intelligence in Education,189,1

However, despite the importance of the mosquito/microbiota interactions, little is known about the relative contribution of endogenous and exogenous factors in shaping the bacterial communities of mosquitoes. METHODS: We used a high-throughput sequencing-based assay to characterize the bacterial composition and diversity of 665 individual field-caught mosquitoes, as well as their species, genotype at an insecticide resistance locus, blood-meal composition, and the eukaryotic parasites and viruses they carry. We then used these data to rigorously estimate the individual effect of each parameter on the bacterial diversity as well as the relative contribution of each parameter to the microbial composition. RESULTS: Overall, multivariate analyses did not reveal any significant contribution of the mosquito species, insecticide resistance, or blood meal to the bacterial composition of the mosquitoes surveyed, and infection with parasites and viruses only contributed very marginally. The main driver of the bacterial diversity was the location at which each mosquito was collected, which explained roughly 20% of the variance observed. CONCLUSIONS: This analysis shows that when confounding factors are taken into account, the site at which the mosquitoes are collected is the main driver of the bacterial diversity of wild-caught mosquitoes, although further studies will be needed to determine which specific components of the local environment affect bacterial composition.

Widespread restrictions on community mobility have resulted in a projected decline of international tourism arrivals up to 30%. The rapid development of Virtual Reality (VR) and its effectiveness in the simulation of real-life experiences provides an opportunity for virtual holiday making especially when actual travel is not possible. Based on a quantitative study with 193 participants, the role of VR as a substitute for physical travel during the pandemic outbreak of COVID-19 was examined, more specifically by looking at the relationship between perceived risk to travel and technological acceptance of VR. The findings suggest that tourists use VR as a travel substitute during and even after a pandemic. However, perceived risk does not play a significant role when it comes to using VR.","Sarkady, Daniel; Neuburger, Larissa; Egger, Roman",Information and Communication Technologies in Tourism 2021,189,1

We recently exploited variational autoencoders to embed 6M molecules in a chemical space, such that their (Euclidean) distance within the latent space so formed could be assessed within the framework of the entire molecular set. However, the standard objective function used did not seek to manipulate the latent space so as to cluster the molecules based on any perceived similarity. Using a set of some 160,000 molecules of biological relevance, we here bring together three modern elements of deep learning to create a novel and disentangled latent space, viz transformers, contrastive learning, and an embedded autoencoder. The effective dimensionality of the latent space was varied such that clear separation of individual types of molecules could be observed within individual dimensions of the latent space. The capacity of the network was such that many dimensions were not populated at all. As before, we assessed the utility of the representation by comparing clozapine with its near neighbors, and we also did the same for various antibiotics related to flucloxacillin. Transformers, especially when as here coupled with contrastive learning, effectively provide one-shot learning and lead to a successful and disentangled representation of molecular latent spaces that at once uses the entire training set in their construction while allowing “similar” molecules to cluster together in an effective and interpretable way.","Shrivastava, Aditya Divyakant; Kell, Douglas B.",Molecules,189,1

Studies reporting thoracic DWI and lymph node evaluation were included. The pooled sensitivity, specificity, diagnostic odds ratio, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) were calculated. RESULTS: We evaluated six studies, involving a collective total of 356 mediastinal lymph nodes in 214 patients. Thoracic DWI had a pooled sensitivity and specificity of 92% (95% confidence interval [95% CI]: 71-98%) and 93% (95% CI: 79-98%), respectively. The positive and negative likelihood ratios were 13.2 (95% CI: 4.0-43.8) and 0.09 (95% CI: 0.02-0.36), respectively.

While novel methods for virtual resident training have been described, many of these demonstrate a substantial change from previous instructional methods and their efficacy cannot be directly compared to in-person teaching. We sought to determine if the conversion of our intern ""summer school"" from an in-person to online format (a) impacted the knowledge acquisition of interns, and (b) their preferences for senior resident-led didactics. DESIGN A senior-resident led intern summer curriculum was started in an in-person format with the 2019-2020 academic year. Interns underwent assessments of their knowledge and surveys of changes in subject confidence. After the COVID-19 pandemic, the curriculum was shifted to an online format for the academic year 2020-2021. SETTING Washington University in St. Louis, an academic medical center located in St. Louis, Missouri PARTICIPANTS: PGY1 general surgery residents during academic year 2019-2020 (n = 13) and 2020-2021 (n = 14). RESULTS In both years, interns demonstrated significant increases in confidence pre- and post-summer school in all domains (p <0.01). This was no different between the in-person and the virtual administration of the bootcamp (p 0.76). In both virtual and in-person curricula, interns demonstrated increased knowledge as measured by multiple choice, boards-style question quizzes. There were no significant differences between virtual and in-person formats. In both formats, interns reported a preference for senior residents as teachers (81% v. 77%) and increased comfort in asking questions in senior resident-led vs. attending-led didactics (91% v 100%). CONCLUSION Virtual senior-resident led intern educational sessions are equally as effective as in-person sessions for knowledge acquisition and improving confidence in intern-specific domains. In both virtual and in-person settings, interns prefer senior resident teachers to attendings. Virtual senior resident-led education is an effective and simple method for intern instruction, regardless of the format/approach.","Caldwell, Katharine E; Hess, Annie; Wise, Paul E; Awad, Michael M",Journal of surgical education,189,33

METHODS Participants included in this retrospective analysis consisted of adult New York City residents with opioid use disorder eligible for enrollment in the NYC Health+Hospitals Virtual Buprenorphine Clinic between March and May 2020 (n = 78). Follow-up data were comprised of rates of retention in treatment at 2 months, referrals to community treatment, and induction-related events. RESULTS During the initial 9 weeks of clinic operations, the clinic inducted 78 patients on to buprenorphine-naloxone and completed 252 visits. Patient referrals included non-NYC Health + Hospitals (n = 22, 28.2%) and NYC Health + Hospitals healthcare providers (n = 17, 21.8%), homeless shelter staff (n = 13, 16.7%), and the NYC Health + Hospitals jail reentry program in Rikers Island (n = 11, 14.1%). At 8 weeks, 42 patients remained in care (53.8%), 21 were referred to a community treatment program (26.9%), and 15 were lost to follow-up (19.2%). No patients were terminated from care due to disruptive behavior or suspicions of diversion or misuse of Buprenorphine. Adverse clinical outcomes were uncommon and included persistent withdrawal symptoms (n = 8, 4.3%) and one nonfatal opioid overdose (0.5%).

METHODS A total of 157 patients underwent emergency operations because of AAD (71% men, mean age 59.5 ± 13 years). Preoperative computed tomographic scans were screened for the presence of BAA. Patients were separated into 2 groups: presenting with BAA (BAA+, n = 22) or not (BAA-, n = 135). Location of the primary tear, surgical treatment, outcome, and risk factors for postoperative neurologic injury and in-hospital mortality were analyzed. RESULTS Fourteen percent (22 of 157) of all patients operated on for AAD had a concomitant BAA. Location of the primary entry tear was predominantly in the aortic arch in patients with BAA (BAA+, 59.1% versus BAA-, 13.3%; p < 0.001). Multivariate analysis revealed the presence of a BAA to be an independent risk factor for having the primary tear in the aortic arch (odds ratio [OR], 14.79; 95% confidence interval [CI] 4.54-48.13; p < 0.001) but not for in-hospital mortality. Patients with BAA had a higher rate of postoperative neurologic injury (BAA+, 35% versus BAA-, 7.9%; p = 0.004). Multivariate analysis identified the presence of BAA as an independent risk factor for postoperative neurologic injury (OR, 4.9; 95% CI, 1.635-14.734; p = 0.005). CONCLUSIONS In type A AAD, the presence of a BAA predicts the location of the primary entry site in the aortic arch and is an independent risk factor for a poor neurologic outcome.","Dumfarth, Julia; Plaikner, Michaela; Krapf, Christoph; Bonaros, Nikolaos; Semsroth, Severin; Rizzo, John A; Fang, Hai; Grimm, Michael; Elefteriades, John A; Schachner, Thomas",The Annals of thoracic surgery,189,1

METHODS A total of 72 women undergoing laparoscopic myomectomy were randomized into 2 treatment groups: 34 patients underwent in-bag manual morcellation (experimental group) and 38 were submitted to uncontained power morcellation (control group). The primary end point was the comparison of morcellation operative time (MOT). Total operative time (TOT), rate of intraoperative complication, and postoperative outcomes in the 2 groups were regarded as secondary outcomes. RESULTS Mean MOT and TOT were longer in the experimental group than in the control one (MOT: 9.47 ± 5.05 vs. 6.16 ± 7.73 min; p = 0.01; TOT: 113.24 ± 28.12 vs. 96.74 ± 33.51 min; p = 0.01). No intraoperative complications occurred in either group and no cases of bag disruption or laparotomic conversion were recorded. No significant difference in hemoglobin drop, hospital stay, and postoperative outcomes was reported between groups. CONCLUSION In-bag manual morcellation appears a safe and feasible procedure and, despite slightly longer operative time, could represent an alternative to uncontained power morcellation.","Frascà, Clarissa; Degli Esposti, Eugenia; Arena, Alessandro; Tuzzato, Gianmarco; Moro, Elisa; Martelli, Valentina; Seracchioli, Renato",Gynecologic and obstetric investigation,189,1

Several aspects of stem cell maintenance are dependent from the functionality and fine tuning of the Notch pathway. In cancer, Notch is specifically involved in preserving self-renewal and amplification of cancer stem cells, supporting the formation, spread and recurrence of the tumor. As the function of Notch signaling is context dependent, we here provide an overview of its activity in a variety of tumors, focusing mostly on its role in the maintenance of the undifferentiated subset of cancer cells. Finally, we analyze the potential of molecules of the Notch pathway as diagnostic and therapeutic tools against the various cancers.","Meisel, Christian T; Porcheri, Cristina; Mitsiadis, Thimios A",Cells,189,1

There is limited data on the use of CURB-65 among admitted CAP patients in Saudi Arabia. METHODOLOGY: The retrospective study included CAP patients, admitted to a general hospital in Eastern Saudi Arabia. The CURB-65 was extracted from the available medical records. RESULTS During the study period, from 2013 to 2016, a total of 1786 adults were admitted with a mean age of 63.9 ± 21.7 (range 14-108 years). The majority of the patients (51.7%) had CURB-65 score 0 or 1 followed by the score 2, 3 and 4/5 (29%, 15.2%, and 4.1%, respectively). The mean CURB-65 was 1.4 ± 1.12 for those who survived and 2.27 ± 1.03 for those who died (p < 0.001). The mean age was 63.01± 21.9 years for survived patients and 75.1 ± 15.58 years for fatal cases (p < 0.001). The overall 30-day crude mortality rate was 7.6%. The mortality rates for CURB-65 scores 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4/5 were 1.8%, 4.3%, 10.2%, 14%, and 21.9%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS The mortality rates of admitted patients with CAP did not differ from those reported in the literature. However, the utilization of CURB-65 score was low and there is a need for wider implementation of pneumonia severity index for patients presenting with CAP.","Al-Tawfiq, Jaffar A; Diamond, Michael; Joy, Diamond; Hinedi, Kareem",Journal of infection in developing countries,189,1

OBJECTIVES To report changes in pain and physical function in the first 3 years following bariatric surgery, and to identify factors associated with improvement. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS The Longitudinal Assessment of Bariatric Surgery-2 is an observational cohort study at 10 US hospitals. Adults with severe obesity undergoing bariatric surgery were recruited between February 2005 and February 2009. Research assessments were conducted prior to surgery and annually thereafter. Three-year follow-up through October 2012 is reported. EXPOSURES Bariatric surgery as clinical care. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Primary outcomes were clinically meaningful presurgery to postsurgery improvements in pain and function using scores from the Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36) (ie, improvement of ≥5 points on the norm-based score [range, 0-100]) and 400-meter walk time (ie, improvement of ≥24 seconds) using established thresholds. The secondary outcome was clinically meaningful improvement using the Western Ontario McMaster Osteoarthritis Index (ie, improvement of ≥9.7 pain points and ≥9.3 function points on the transformed score [range, 0-100]). RESULTS Of 2458 participants, 2221 completed baseline and follow-up assessments (1743 [78.5%] were women; median age was 47 years; median body mass index [BMI] was 45.9; 70.4% underwent RYGB; 25.0% underwent LAGB). At year 1, clinically meaningful improvements were shown in 57.6% (95% CI, 55.3%-59.9%) of participants for bodily pain, 76.5% (95% CI, 74.6%-78.5%) for physical function, and 59.5% (95% CI, 56.4%-62.7%) for walk time. Additionally, among participants with severe knee or disability (633), or hip pain or disability (500) at baseline, approximately three-fourths experienced joint-specific improvements in knee pain (77.1% [95% CI, 73.5%-80.7%]) and in hip function (79.2% [95% CI, 75.3%-83.1%]). Between year 1 and year 3, rates of improvement significantly decreased to 48.6% (95% CI, 46.0%-51.1%) for bodily pain and to 70.2% (95% CI, 67.8%-72.5%) for physical function, but improvement rates for walk time, knee and hip pain, and knee and hip function did not (P for all ≥.05). Younger age, male sex, higher income, lower BMI, and fewer depressive symptoms presurgery; no diabetes and no venous edema with ulcerations postsurgery (either no history or remission); and presurgery-to-postsurgery reductions in weight and depressive symptoms were associated with presurgery-to-postsurgery improvements in multiple outcomes at years 1, 2, and 3. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among a cohort of participants with severe obesity undergoing bariatric surgery, a large percentage experienced improvement, compared with baseline, in pain, physical function, and walk time over 3 years, but the percentage with improvement in pain and physical function decreased between year 1 and year 3.

Such evaluations have largely halted during the COVID-19 crisis, with questionable psychometrics of usable measures and clinicians largely unprepared to administer them. Remote, online psychoeducational evaluations have the potential to decrease this access problem by allowing for evaluations to continue during the crisis, as well as redistributing (geographically and potentially socioeconomically) evaluators to populations disproportionately without access. The present study evaluated the equivalence of a remote, online administration procedure for the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children, Fifth Edition (WISC-V) with traditional, in-person administration. Results revealed no significant differences-and, therefore, method effects-between the full-scale IQ and index scores between the administration procedures. One subtest did reveal a significant method effect, with children performing more poorly on the remote, online version of the test. Although imperfect, the remote, online procedure is a viable alternative for the traditional, in-person administration of the WISC-V, especially during this time of crisis.

INTRODUCTION Whether circumferential pulmonary vein ablation (CPVA) can alleviate anxiety and depression symptoms is unknown and the effect of anxiety and depression on the recurrence of atrial fibrillation (AF) after CPVA is not clear. METHODS Two hundred and ten patients with a diagnosis of paroxysmal AF were admitted in the study. Ninety-eight patients (CPVA group) and 102 patients (medicine group) were treated with CPVA and antiarrhythmic drugs, respectively. All patients were followed up for 1 year. Zung Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS), Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS), and Short-Form life survey-36 items (SF-36) were assessed before and after follow-up. RESULTS In CPVA group, the scores of SAS and SDS decreased (41.69 ± 8.32 vs 37.66 ± 4.82, P < 0.001 and 45.01 ± 9.71 vs 40.05 ± 8.56, P < 0.001, respectively) and SF-36 score improved (565.29 ± 143.37 vs 606.84 ± 102.84, P = 0.021) after follow-up. Compared with the data in recurrent patients, the SAS and SDS scores were significantly lower in nonrecurrent patients at baseline (44.68 ± 8.40 vs 38.10 ± 7.55, P < 0.001 and 51.75 ± 9.41 vs 43.96 ± 8.95, P < 0.001, respectively). The results of multivariate logistic regression analysis showed normalized scores of SAS (OR = 3.20, 95% CI [3.05, 3.48], P = 0.023) and SDS (OR = 3.26, 95% CI [3.12, 3.49], P = 0.023) were the independent risk factor of AF recurrence after CPVA. CONCLUSIONS CPVA can ameliorate anxiety and depression, which may contribute to improvement of quality of life in patients with paroxysmal AF. Anxiety and depression increase the recurrence risk of AF after CPVA.","Yu, Shengbo; Zhao, Qingyan; Wu, Pan; Qin, Mu; Huang, He; Cui, Hongying; Huang, Congxin",Journal of cardiovascular electrophysiology,189,16

However, the clinical relevance of MRVD in adult patients has rarely been evaluated. The clinical characteristics of hospitalized adult patients with ARI and MRVD by RVM-RT-PCR tests were compared to those of patients with single RV detection (SRVD) during a single year at a tertiary care center. MRVD was observed in 26 of the 190 adult patients (13.7%). The patients with MRVD had a higher incidence of chronic lung disease than the patients with SRVD (34.6% versus 15.9%, crude odds ratio [OR]=2.81, 95% confidence interval [CI]=1.13 to 6.98, P=0.03). Although the former were more likely than the latter to receive mechanical ventilation (19.2% versus 6.7%, crude OR=3.31, 95% CI=1.05 to 10.47, P=0.049), the length of hospital stay (median, 7 versus 6.5 days; P=0.66), and the in-hospital mortality rate (7.7% versus 4.3%, crude OR=1.87, 95% CI=0.37 to 9.53, P=0.35) were not different between the two groups. In multivariate analysis, chronic lung disease was associated with MRVD (adjusted OR=3.08, 95% CI=1.12 to 8.46, P=0.03). In summary, it was not uncommon to encounter adult patients with ARI and MRVD by RVM-RT-PCR tests of nasopharyngeal swab specimens. MRVD was associated with chronic lung disease rather than the severity of the ARI.","Choi, Seong-Ho; Chung, Jin-Won; Kim, Hye Ryoun",Journal of clinical microbiology,189,1

METHODS A novel method of mesh insertion by folding the mesh like the fabric of an umbrella and loading it into the 10-mm cannula for delivery into the peritoneal cavity is described. This method uses the inherent ability of meshes to spring back into shape. In this study on 30 patients who underwent transabdominal preperitoneal hernia repair, the umbrella method of mesh insertion was compared with the traditional roll up type of mesh insertion in terms of easiness mesh deployment and operating time. In bilateral procedures, each side was considered as a separate operation. RESULTS The operative time for the mesh insertion was reduced slightly (6 min), from 18 min for the roll-up technique to 12 min for the umbrella technique. CONCLUSION The umbrella method has a distinct advantage over the roll-up technique, in which unrolling of the mesh is done in a plane parallel to the mesh. This may explain the time saved, as demonstrated in this pilot study.","Durai, Rajaraman; Mownah, Abdoolla; Ng, Philip C H",Surgical endoscopy,189,29

MATERIAL AND METHODS This is a retrospective study involving all patients who presented with clinical features of SARI and who had undergone bedside chest X-ray (CXR), hemograms with TLC, NLR, and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) at our institute from May 1 to June 30, 2020. RESULTS Of 204 patients, 115 tested RT-PCR-positive and 89 tested negative. The patients who presented with SARI, using CXR-based score of 4 or more, TLC of less than 8,700 cells/μL, and NLR of <7 had a statistically significant area under the curve (p<0.001) for diagnosing COVID-19. The sensitivity and specificity of the CXR score was 80.8% and 73.0%, of TLC was 70.1% and 74.7%, and of NLR was 70.1% and 59.0%, respectively, in diagnosing COVID-19 alone. The specificity further increased to 90.4% when we used the CXR score with NLR and to 92.8% when we used the CXR score with TLC. The post-test odds (""rule in"" disease) of a positive test for having the disease were 3, 2.77, and 1.71 times with the use of either CXR score, TLC, or NLR criteria, respectively; whereas, combined use of CXR score and NLR increased the post-test odds by 5.53 times, and combination of CXR score with TLC increased the post-test odds by 7.5 times. CONCLUSION CXR score with TLC and NLR can predict COVID-19 infection among those who presented with features of SARI.

It is based on stent-induced modification of blood flow within and around an aneurysm inflow zone, leading to gradual intra-aneurysmal thrombosis and subsequent atrophy, while preserving flow into the parent vessel and perforating branches. Flow-diversion technique is well-suited for the treatment of large, giant, wide-necked, and fusiform intracranial aneurysms because it does not rely on endosaccular packing with coils but rather on the strategy of placing a stent across the aneurysm ""neck"" or across the diseased segment of a vessel in case of a fusiform aneurysm. Over time, neointimal endothelium covers the flow diverter such that it becomes incorporated into the parent vessel wall and occludes the aneurysm from the circulation, effectively repairing the diseased parent vessel segment.

Not all studies have observed such relationships, however. Differences in study outcomes may be due to methodological limitations and the presence of confounding factors within studies such as immigration status and level of education. We conducted the first systematic review with meta-analysis combining cross-sectional studies to explore if bilingualism might delay symptom onset and diagnosis of dementia, AD, and MCI. Primary outcomes included the age of symptom onset, the age at diagnosis of MCI or dementia, and the risk of developing MCI or dementia. A secondary outcome included the degree of disease severity at dementia diagnosis. There was no difference in the age of MCI diagnosis between monolinguals and bilinguals [mean difference: 3.2; 95% confidence intervals (CI): -3.4, 9.7]. Bilinguals vs. monolinguals reported experiencing AD symptoms 4.7 years (95% CI: 3.3, 6.1) later. Bilinguals vs. monolinguals were diagnosed with dementia 3.3 years (95% CI: 1.7, 4.9) later. Here, 95% prediction intervals showed a large dispersion of effect sizes (-1.9 to 8.5). We investigated this dispersion with a subgroup meta-analysis comparing studies that had recruited participants with dementia to studies that had recruited participants with AD on the age of dementia and AD diagnosis between mono- and bilinguals. Results showed that bilinguals vs. monolinguals were 1.9 years (95% CI: -0.9, 4.7) and 4.2 (95% CI: 2.0, 6.4) older than monolinguals at the time of dementia and AD diagnosis, respectively. The mean difference between the two subgroups was not significant. There was no significant risk reduction (odds ratio: 0.89; 95% CI: 0.68-1.16) in developing dementia among bilinguals vs. monolinguals. Also, there was no significant difference (Hedges' g = 0.05; 95% CI: -0.13, 0.24) in disease severity at dementia diagnosis between bilinguals and monolinguals, despite bilinguals being significantly older. The majority of studies had adjusted for level of education suggesting that education might not have played a role in the observed delay in dementia among bilinguals vs. monolinguals. Although findings indicated that bilingualism was on average related to a delayed onset of dementia, the magnitude of this relationship varied across different settings. This variation may be due to unexplained heterogeneity and different sources of bias in the included studies.

Myofibrils are the functional contractile units of force production within individual cardiac myocytes. At the molecular level, myosin motors form cross-bridges with actin filaments and use ATP to convert chemical energy into mechanical forces. The energetic efficiency of the cross-bridge cycle is influenced by the viscous damping of myofibril contraction. The viscoelastic response of myofibrils is an emergent property of their individual mechanical components. Previous studies have implicated titin-actin interactions, cell-ECM adhesion, and microtubules as regulators of the viscoelastic response of myofibrils. Here we probed the viscoelastic response of myofibrils using laser-assisted dissection. As a proof-of-concept, we found actomyosin contractility was required to endow myofibrils with their viscoelastic response, with blebbistatin treatment resulting in decreased myofibril tension and viscous damping. Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) is a key regulator of cell-ECM adhesion, microtubule stability and myofibril assembly. We found inhibition of FAK signaling altered the viscoelastic properties of myofibrils. Specifically, inhibition of FAK resulted in increased viscous damping of myofibril retraction following laser ablation. This damping was not associated with acute changes in the electrophysiological properties of cardiac myocytes. These results implicate FAK as a regulator of mechanical properties of myofibrils.

We aimed to determine whether epidemic growth is globally associated with climate or public health interventions intended to reduce transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). METHODS We performed a prospective cohort study of all 144 geopolitical areas worldwide (375 609 cases) with at least 10 COVID-19 cases and local transmission by Mar. 20, 2020, excluding China, South Korea, Iran and Italy. Using weighted random-effects regression, we determined the association between epidemic growth (expressed as ratios of rate ratios [RRR] comparing cumulative counts of COVID-19 cases on Mar. 27, 2020, with cumulative counts on Mar. 20, 2020) and latitude, temperature, humidity, school closures, restrictions of mass gatherings, and measures of social distancing during an exposure period 14 days previously (Mar. 7 to 13, 2020). RESULTS In univariate analyses, there were few or no associations of epidemic growth with latitude and temperature, but weak negative associations with relative humidity (RRR per 10% 0.91, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.85-0.96) and absolute humidity (RRR per 5 g/m3 0.92, 95% CI 0.85-0.99). Strong associations were found for restrictions of mass gatherings (RRR 0.65, 95% CI 0.53-0.79), school closures (RRR 0.63, 95% CI 0.52-0.78) and measures of social distancing (RRR 0.62, 95% CI 0.45-0.85). In a multivariable model, there was a strong association with the number of implemented public health interventions (p for trend = 0.001), whereas the association with absolute humidity was no longer significant. INTERPRETATION Epidemic growth of COVID-19 was not associated with latitude and temperature, but may be associated weakly with relative or absolute humidity. Conversely, public health interventions were strongly associated with reduced epidemic growth.","Jüni, Peter; Rothenbühler, Martina; Bobos, Pavlos; Thorpe, Kevin E; da Costa, Bruno R; Fisman, David N; Slutsky, Arthur S; Gesink, Dionne",CMAJ : Canadian Medical Association journal = journal de l'Association medicale canadienne,189,15

Fourteen construction workers volunteered to participate in the field study. Each participant took part in two trials, i.e., cooling and control. Construction work included morning and afternoon sessions. Cooling intervention was implemented for 15 and 30 min during the morning and afternoon rest periods, respectively, between repeated bouts of work. Micrometeorological (wet-bulb globe temperature [WBGT]), physiological (tympanic temperature and heart rate), and perceptual (ratings of perceived exertion [RPE] and thermal sensation) measurements were taken during the test. Heat strain indices, including physiological strain index (PSIHR) and perceptual strain index (PeSI), were estimated accordingly. During the study, construction workers were exposed to a hot environment with a mean WBGT of 31.56 ± 1.87 °C. Compared with the control, physiological and perceptual strain were significantly reduced in the cooling condition during rest and subsequent work periods (p < 0.05; d = 0.24-1.07, small to large cooling effect). Cooling intervention significantly alleviates heat strain in the construction industry. The effectiveness and practicality of a proposed cooling intervention were tested in a field study. Results provide a reference for setting guidelines and promoting application on a range of construction sites.","Zhao, Yijie; Yi, Wen; Chan, Albert P C; Wong, Del P",International journal of biometeorology,189,28

This study aimed to present our single-center clinical results and experience of endovascular repair of complex vascular diseases of the internal carotid artery using the WCS. Methods: Patients who presented with complex vascular diseases of the internal carotid artery and who were treated with the WCS from December 2013 to September 2018 were retrospectively reviewed. Procedural results, perioperative complications, incidence of endoleak, and follow-up outcomes were analyzed. Results: Sixty-five patients were enrolled. A total of 25 large aneurysms, 10 pseudoaneurysms, 14 blood blister-like aneurysms, 11 carotid-cavernous fistulas, and 5 surgical injuries were assessed. WCS placement was successful in all patients. Immediate angiography showed that complete repair of the target artery was achieved in 56 patients (86.2%). Endoleak was observed in nine patients, including seven type I endoleaks and two type II endoleaks. Occlusion of a side-branch vessel occurred in four patients. Acute in-stent thrombosis occurred in one patient. No ischemic or hemorrhagic events or other complications developed during the perioperative and follow-up periods. Angiographic follow-up (mean duration, 12 ± 3.29 months) was performed in 60 patients and showed complete target artery repair in 58 patients, and asymptomatic mild to moderate in-stent stenosis was observed in four patients. Slight endoleak persisted in two patients without enlargement or rupture of the residual lumen. Conclusion: WCS implantation is safe, feasible, and efficacious for endovascular repair in patients with complex vascular diseases of the internal carotid artery, showing excellent short-term target artery patency and clinical outcomes.","Ma, Lin; Feng, Hao; Yan, Shuo; Xu, Ji-Chong; Tan, Hua-Qiao; Fang, Chun",Frontiers in neurology,189,1

The aim of this review is to synthesise research to date that utilises upper limb motion tracking sensors, either individually or in combination with other technologies (e.g., cameras, microphones), to objectively assess eating behaviour. Eleven electronic databases were searched in January 2019, and 653 distinct records were obtained. Including 10 studies found in backward and forward searches, a total of 69 studies met the inclusion criteria, with 28 published since 2017. Fifty studies were conducted exclusively in laboratory settings, 13 exclusively in free-living settings, and three in both settings. The most commonly used motion sensor was an accelerometer (64) worn on the wrist (60) or lower arm (5), while in most studies (45), accelerometers were used in combination with gyroscopes. Twenty-six studies used commercial-grade smartwatches or fitness bands, 11 used professional grade devices, and 32 used standalone sensor chipsets. The most used machine learning approaches were Support Vector Machine (SVM, n = 21), Random Forest (n = 19), Decision Tree (n = 16), Hidden Markov Model (HMM, n = 10) algorithms, and from 2017 Deep Learning (n = 5). While comparisons of the detection models are not valid due to the use of different datasets, the models that consider the sequential context of data across time, such as HMM and Deep Learning, show promising results for eating activity detection. We discuss opportunities for future research and emerging applications in the context of dietary assessment and monitoring.","Heydarian, Hamid; Adam, Marc; Burrows, Tracy; Collins, Clare; Rollo, Megan E",Nutrients,189,2

There are isolated reports of pseudoaneurysm as the result of intracranial aneurysm surgery in both adults and children. Treatment of these lesions, both surgically and endovascularly, can be complicated due to the known variability of arterial wall thickness in traumatic pseudoaneurysms. CASE REPORT We describe a child who underwent successful craniopharyngioma resection following staged surgical procedures. Follow-up imaging 8 months after the operation demonstrated an enlarging pseudoaneurysm of the left supraclinoid carotid artery. The lesion was successfully treated with stenting of the vessel and coil placement between the stent and the aneurysmal segment of the artery. Follow-up angiographic imaging 6 months later revealed complete obliteration of the aneurysm and normalization of the carotid artery lumen. CONCLUSION To our knowledge, this is the first report of a pseudoaneurysm secondary to a surgical intervention in childhood that was treated with stent-assisted coiling. This strategy of vascular reconstruction is increasingly used in adults and appears safe to implement in the pediatric population. However, the long-term outcomes and the value of using an antiplatelet regimen in this young population are still to be determined.","Ogilvy, Christopher S; Tawk, Rabih G; Mokin, Maxim; Yang, Xinyu; Levy, Elad I; Hopkins, L Nelson; Siddiqui, Adnan H",Pediatric neurosurgery,189,1

Here, we have developed a green-emitting fluorogenic probe, which exhibits a large fluorescence response at 520 nm (> 560-fold) when treated with 100 µM H 2 S for 1 h. It is highly selective for H 2 S over biothiols (> 400-fold F / F 0 ) and has a detection limit of 12.9 nM. We demonstrate the application of the probe for endogenous H 2 S detection in vivo for the understanding of its roles in antiviral host defense. Such virus-induced H 2 S inhibits viral replication by reducing gene expression of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase ( RdRp) and coat protein (CP). Additionally, a H 2 S donor GYY4137 showed significantly antiviral activity as ribavirin, a broad-spectrum drug against RNA viruses. Furtherly, we propose a possible molecular mechanism for the TMV-induced H 2 S biogenesis. This work provides a proof-of-principle in support of further studies identifying endogenous H 2 S and its donors as potential antivirals toward RNA viruses.","Pang, Zhili; Ye, Haishun; Ma, Dejun; Tu, Xiaoqiang; Yi, Long; Xi, Zhen",Chembiochem : a European journal of chemical biology,189,1

Injection of complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) served as a model for inflammatory pain. The CFA injection decreased the thermal thresholds in both sexes but only the male mice showed increased anxiety-like behavior and diminished cognition, while the females were not affected. Increased calcium fluorescence, a marker for neuronal activity, was detected by photometry in the mPFC of males but not in females with CFA. Next, while chemogenetic inhibition of the projections from the mPFC to the LC improved the object recognition memory of males with pain, the inhibition of the mPFC to LC pathway in female mice produced anxiolysis and spatial memory deficits. The behavior results prompted us to compare the reciprocal innervation of mPFC and LC between the sexes. We used an anterograde transsynaptic tagging technique, which relies on postsynaptic cre transfer, to assess the innervation of LC by mPFC efferents. The males showed a higher rate of postsynaptic cre transfer into LC neurons from mPFC efferents than the females. And vice versa, a retrograde tracing experiment demonstrated that LC to mPFC projection neurons were more numerous in females when compared to males. In conclusion, we provide evidence that subtle differences in the reciprocal neuronal circuit between the LC and mPFC may contribute to sex differences associated with the adverse cognitive effects of inflammatory pain.","Cardenas, Andrea; Papadogiannis, Alexander; Dimitrov, Eugene",FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology,189,16

Over the years, this simple molecule appears to drive more and more scientific attention perhaps due to a dualism of H2 affirmative features demonstrated in numerous in vitro, animal and human studies on one side, and stillpuzzling mechanism(s) of its biological activity on the other. Up to this point, H2 was scrutinized for more than 170 different disease models and pathologies, and many research groups across the world have lately started to dynamically investigate its conceivable performance-enhancing potential. METHODS We outlined here the studies indexed in leading research databases (PubMed, Web of Science, SCOPUS, JSTORE) that explored the effects of hydrogen on exercise performance, and also addressed important restraints, open questions, and windows of opportunities for forthcoming research and possible H2 enactment in exercise physiology. About two dozen trials have been identified in this domain, with most published during the past 5 years, while drinking hydrogen-rich water recognized as the most convenient method to deliver H2 in both animal and human studies. RESULTS Either administered as an inhalational gas, enteral hydrogen-rich water, or intravenous hydrogen-rich saline, H2 seems to favorably affect various exercise performance outcomes and biomarkers of exercise-associated fatigue, inflammation, and oxidative stress. Not all studies have shown corroborative effects, and it appears that the gold-standard protocol for applying H2 in the field of exercise science does not exist at the moment, with studies markedly differ in the dose of H2 administered, the duration of a treatment, and the source of hydrogen. CONCLUSION H2 is a newfangled and rather effective performance-enhancing agent yet its promising ergogenic potency has to be further validated and characterized in more well-controlled, appropriately sampled and long-term mechanistic trials. Also, appropriate regulation of hydrogen utilization in sport as an exotic medical gas may require distinctive legislative actions of relevant regulatory agencies in the future.","Ostojic, Sergej M",Current pharmaceutical design,189,16

METHODS First, we analysed the different clinical, biological and SF variables associated with the diagnosis of SA (according to the Newman's criteria) in a monocentric cohort of acute arthritis (<30 days) (n = 233) (SYNOLACTATE cohort). A new score predictive of SA (RESAS) was created using the independent discriminant variables after multivariate analysis. A value was attributed to each variable of the score according to the weighting based on their likelihood ratio for the diagnosis of SA. RESAS performance was then tested on the first cohort (internal validation) and then checked on a second independent cohort (n = 70) (external validation). RESULTS After multivariate analysis, four independent variables of the SF were included for RESAS: (i) purulent SF or white blood cells count ≥70 000/mm3; (ii) absence/presence of crystals; (iii) lactate; and (iv) glucose synovial level. RESAS ranged between -4 and +13 points. The performance of RESAS to predicted SA was excellent with area under the curve (AUC)=0.928 (0.877-0.980) in internal validation and AUC=0.986 (0.962-1.00) in external validation. For a RESAS threshold ≥+4, SA was diagnosed with Se=56.0% (0.371-0.733), Sp=98.1% (0.952-0.993), LR+=29.1 (10.4-81.6) in the first cohort and with Se=91.7% (0.646-0.985), Sp=98.3% (0.909-0.997), LR+=53.2 (7.56-373) in the second cohort.

Identifying themes in policy responses provides a framework for subsequent evaluations of the relationship between state policies and health service utilization.Methods: Between May and June 2020, we searched all Single State Agencies for Substance Abuse Services (SSA) websites for statements of SUD treatment policy responses to the pandemic. We conducted Iterative Categorization of policies for outpatient programs, opioid treatment programs, and other treatment settings to identify themes in policy responses.Results: We collected 220 documents from SSA websites from 45 states and Washington D.C. Eight specific themes emerged from our content analysis: delivery of pharmacological and non-pharmacological services, obtaining informed consent and documentation for remote services, conducting health assessments, facility operating procedures and staffing requirements, and permissible telehealth technology and billing protocols. Policy changes often mirrored federal guidance, for instance, by expanding methadone take-home options for opioid treatment programs. The extent and nature of policy changes varied across jurisdictions, including telehealth technology requirements and staffing flexibility.Conclusion: States have made significant policy changes to SUD treatment policies during COVID-19, particularly regarding telehealth and facilitation of remote care. Understanding these changes could help policymakers prioritize guidance during the pandemic and for future health crises.

While overall population numbers and range have increased, there are regions in which expansion has occurred at a slower rate and/or animal numbers have decreased, which may be a result of chronic stress from a variety of sources. Some have employed glucocorticoid analysis in their attempts to validate these explanations. Our goal was to conduct a controlled study using sea otters managed under human care to validate the use of serum glucocorticoid analysis to monitor stress physiology in the sea otter. We used a standard ACTH challenge test to compare cortisol and corticosterone responses, thereby identifying the primary glucocorticoid in the sea otter. Fourteen sea otters of both sexes (five males, nine females), including juveniles, sub-adults and adults, participated in the study. The results of the testing supported cortisol as the primary glucocorticoid in the sea otter. Sex and age did not affect how the individual responded to the ACTH or saline injection. Interestingly, the saline injection not only confirmed the effects of the ACTH on glucocorticoid release from the adrenal glands but also provided information on how long it takes the sea otter's glucocorticoid levels to return to baseline after capture and sedation. The insight gained from this study will aid in future efforts to better understand the role of stress in free-ranging sea otter populations. Recognition of the primary glucocorticoid will facilitate evaluation of more stable biological material, such as fur or whiskers, which tend to be less affected by the diurnal cycling of glucocorticoids.","Murray, M J; Young, M A; Santymire, R M",Conservation physiology,189,19

RESULTS Patients who underwent LAVH or TLH had a lower average intraoperative blood loss, less intense postoperative pain, and shorter hospital stays than patients in the TAH group, although the length of the operations in the laparoscopic groups were significantly longer. To evaluate the selection criteria for the large sized myomas, we compared the LAVH and TLH groups for the myomas larger than 7 cm. The greatest uterine transverse diameters and the weight of the uteri were not significantly different between the LAVH and TLH groups (94.7 ± 20.8 and 83.1 ± 17.6 mm, 371.6 ± 160.3 and 286.7 ± 158.0 g, respectively). The average intraoperative blood loss in the TLH group was significantly lower than that in the LAVH (121.3 ± 111.2 vs 379.3 ± 222.4 g, P < 0.001). CONCLUSION Our data suggest that TLH is a better procedure for treating a large uterus no larger than 10 cm in its greatest transverse diameter. The preoperative total length of myoma nodules determined by MRI is a useful preoperative indicator of the uterine weight.","Hatta, Koji; Terai, Yoshito; Okuda, Kiyoji; Nakamura, Yoshihiro; Yoo, Saha; Tanaka, Yoshimichi; Tsunetoh, Satoshi; Hayashi, Atsushi; Yamashita, Yoshiki; Ohmichi, Masahide",The journal of obstetrics and gynaecology research,189,1

In the present study, we aim to present the effects of early LPV/r treatment on patients with severe COVID-19. METHODS The demographics, characteristics, treatments, SARS-CoV-2 test results and outcomes of 19 patients with severe COVID-19 treated with LPV/r within 12 days of onset of symptoms were retrospectively assessed. RESULTS Within 3 days of admission, three (15.79%) patients received noninvasive ventilation, and 16 (84.21%) patients received high-flow oxygen support. The median duration between the onset of symptoms and initiating LPV/r therapy was 9 (range 2-12) days. The median course of LPV/r treatment was 11 (range 7-17) days. One of the 19 patients (5.26%) died. Of the 18 patients discharged, the median hospital stay was 17 (range 11-45) days. At day 6 after LPV/r therapy was initiated, 68.42% of patients were virologically cured, increasing to 84.22% at day 12. CONCLUSION In this cohort of patients with severe COVID-19 who were treated with LPV/r within 12 days of the onset of symptoms, clinical improvement was observed in 18/19 patients (94.74%). Randomised controlled trials are urgently needed to further evaluate this strategy.","Luo, Pan; Zheng, Jian-Ling; Liu, Yi; Qiu, Lin; Liu, Xiu-Lan; Xue, Hui-Ying; Liu, Dong; Li, Juan",Clinical medicine,189,1

To solve these problems, it is important to focus on robust features in intra-class variation. Existing attention-based Re-ID methods focus only on common features without considering distinctive features. In this paper, we present a novel attentive learning-based Siamese network for person Re-ID. Unlike existing methods, we designed an attention module and attention loss using the properties of the Siamese network to concentrate attention on common and distinctive features. The attention module consists of channel attention to select important channels and encoder-decoder attention to observe the whole body shape. We modified the triplet loss into an attention loss, called uniformity loss. The uniformity loss generates a unique attention map, which focuses on both common and discriminative features. Extensive experiments show that the proposed network compares favorably to the state-of-the-art methods on three large-scale benchmarks including Market-1501, CUHK03 and DukeMTMC-ReID datasets.","Jeong, Dasol; Park, Hasil; Shin, Joongchol; Kang, Donggoo; Paik, Joonki",Sensors,189,1

PATIENTS AND METHODS This study included 282 patients who underwent RAPN between 2014 and 2016. SIB score was macroscopically evaluated immediately after the surgery. We divided the patients into the following two groups: enucleation (SIB score, 1-2) and resection (SIB score, 3-5). To minimize selection bias between the two surgical methods, patient variables were adjusted by 1:1 propensity score matching. RESULTS Of the 282 patients, 48 were assigned to the enucleation group and 234 to the resection group. After matching, 45 patients were included in each group. The mean preoperative estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was 70 mL/min/1.73 m2. The mean tumor size was 32-33 mm. The decrease in eGFR (5.6 vs 12%, p = 0.0365) and total perioperative complication (16% vs 38%, p = 0.0171) were significantly lower in the enucleation group than in the resection group. Estimated blood loss was higher in the enucleation group than in the resection group (129 cc vs 117 cc, p = 0.0088), despite a similar transfusion rate. The postoperative length of hospital stay was shorter in the enucleation group than in the resection group (4.1 vs 5.0 days, p = 0.0288). Operation time and surgical margin status were not significantly different between groups. CONCLUSIONS In carefully selected patients, enucleation was associated with more favorable surgical outcomes in the cohort than resection, including improved renal function and a lower complication rate.","Takagi, Toshio; Kondo, Tsunenori; Tachibana, Hidekazu; Iizuka, Junpei; Omae, Kenji; Yoshida, Kazuhiko; Kobayashi, Hirohito; Okumi, Masayoshi; Ishida, Hideki; Tanabe, Kazunari",Journal of endourology,189,12

DESIGN Narrated step-by-step explanation of the Bologna hysteropexy technique using descriptive text and an educational video. SETTING Tertiary referred center of minimally invasive gynecology, Sant'Orsola Hospital, Bologna University. INTERVENTIONS The Bologna hysteropexy is proposed as an additional procedure after surgical laparoscopic interventions for benign gynecologic disease. The technique consists of 2 semicontinuous absorbable sutures (Biosyn monofilament no. 1 [Covidien, Mansfield, MA] with 2/3 inch diameter needle, 36 mm) suspending the uterus to the anterior abdominal wall, through the plication and shortening of round ligaments. A knot is tied intracorporeally between the 2 free ends of the semicontinuous sutures, drawing a V shape figure and resulting in uterine ventrosuspension. CONCLUSION The Bologna technique hysteropexy is simple and quick to perform. It is effective in suspending the uterus in anteverted and anteflexed positions at 6-month ultrasound follow-up. No perioperative complications were recorded. It can be done with a standard surgical suture-passer and does not add additional cost to surgery. Furthermore, an absorbable suture is desirable for fertile women.","Seracchioli, Renato; Zanello, Margherita; Arena, Alessandro; Costantino, Claudia; Moro, Elisa; Zannoni, Letizia; Raimondo, Diego",Journal of minimally invasive gynecology,189,30

Natural outbreaks, of both emerging and re-emerging diseases, can have significant impacts on local, national and regional communities. An effective response to these outbreaks relies heavily on the coordination of both public health and Veterinary Services to identify the signs, symptoms and patterns of disease quickly and respond accordingly. The future global risks related to infectious disease are influenced by several factors, including human migration, urban development, agricultural development and climate change. As technology advances, we are more aware of the potential risks associated with dual-use equipment and research (defined as equipment or research that can be used for legitimate as well as nefarious purposes), synthetic biology, the engineering of biological systems, and the evolving modus operandi of criminals and terrorist groups. The ability to detect natural, accidental or deliberate outbreaks and incidents will rely heavily on cross-agency communication, establishment of informationsharing platforms, development of joint investigative strategies, and recognition that effective response requires a strong health and security agency interface. Therefore, the management of a suspicious biological incident requires intersectoral and interregional cooperation employing a comprehensive approach which considers prevention, preparedness, response and recovery and identifies and considers the unique characteristics and requirements of the incident.","Hoile, R",Revue scientifique et technique,189,15

The aim of this study was to apply a previous published methodology to design food exchange lists to the development of a sports food exchange list, with sport products available in Spain. A cross-sectional study of the nutritional composition of sports foods, regarding macronutrients and energy, was carried out. A total of 322 sports foods from 18 companies were selected, taking into account their interest in sports practice and with nutritional data provided by companies. Sports foods were divided into seven groups: sports drinks; sports gels; sports bars; sports confectionery; protein powders; protein bars; and liquid meals. A sports food composition database based on portion size usually consumed by athletes and/or recommended in commercial packaging was created. Within each sports foods group, different subgroups were defined due to differences in the main and/or secondary macronutrient. The definition of each exchange list with the amounts-in grams-of each sports food within each group and subgroup, was done using statistical criteria such as mean, standard deviation, coefficient of variation, and Z value. Final exchange values for energy and macronutrient have been established for each group and subgroup using a methodology to design food exchange lists previously published by the authors. In addition, those products with high Z values that can provide greater variability in dietary planning were included. The usefulness of sport foods lists as well as the use of an exchange system in the dietary practice of sports nutrition is discussed, and examples of how to use them with athletes are presented. This first sport foods exchange list showed in this study, with commercial sports products available in Spain, can be a novel tool for dietetic practice and also can allow sport nutrition professionals to develop another sport food list using the methodology described in this paper. Its management would allow dietitians to adapt dietary plans more precisely to the training and/or competition of the athlete.","Martínez-Sanz, José Miguel; Menal-Puey, Susana; Sospedra, Isabel; Russolillo, Giuseppe; Norte, Aurora; Marques-Lopes, Iva",Nutrients,189,5

STUDY DESIGN Descriptive study. PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY Shifa International Hospital (SIH), Islamabad from March to June 2020. METHODOLOGY After IRB approval, 112 patients were consecutively enrolled, having laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 and hospitalised in SIH. Patients' demographics and clinical data were retrieved from Radiology Information System (RIS). Chest radiographs (CXR) were retrieved from picture archive and communication system (PACS). CXR severity scoring was determined by three radiologists, and results were analysed. RESULTS Lung opacities (98.2%), involvement of both lungs (96.4%), both peripheral and central region involvement (62.5%) and upper/mid/lower zone distribution (61.6%) were the most frequent findings. Males affected more than females with a mean age of 58.9 ± 13.1 years. Zonal involvement, density and extent of opacities peaked on 10-13th day of illness. In the last CXR, opacities showed decrease in extent as well as density, reduction in zonal involvement, and few having mixed interstitial thickening/fibrosis. One hundred and five out of 112 (93.8%) patients had residual radiographic abnormalities on discharge. CONCLUSION Serial chest radiography can be used to monitor disease progression and temporal changes after initial HRCT. Patients who have CXR severity score of 4 or more at the time of admission, is a red flag for prolonged hospital stay and possible intubation. Severity of CXR findings peaked at 10-13 days. It is recommended to repeat CXRs every 3-4th day during hospital stay. Majority of the patients has residual radiographic abnormality on discharge.

How eligibility for Medicare affects racial and ethnic disparities in access to care and health is poorly understood. Objective To assess the association of Medicare with racial and ethnic disparities in access to care and health. Design, Setting, and Participants This cross-sectional study uses regression discontinuity to compare racial and ethnic disparities before and after age 65 years, the age at which US adults are eligible for Medicare. There are a total of 2 434 320 respondents in the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System and 44 587 state-age-year observations in the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Wide-Ranging Online Data for Epidemiologic Research Data (eg, the mortality rate for individuals age 63 years in New York in 2017) from January 2008 to December 2018. The data were analyzed between February and May 2021. Exposures Eligibility for Medicare at age 65 years. Main Outcomes and Measures Proportions of respondents with health insurance, as well as self-reported health and mortality. To examine access, whether respondents had a usual source of care, encountered cost-related barriers to care, or received influenza vaccines was assessed. Results Of 2 434 320 participants, 192 346 were Black individuals, 104 294 were Hispanic individuals, and 892 177 were men. Immediately after age 65 years, insurance coverage increased more for Black respondents (from 86.3% to 95.8% or 9.5 percentage points; 95% CI, 7.6-11.4) and Hispanic respondents (from 77.4% to 91.3% or 13.9 percentage points; 95% CI, 12.0-15.8) than White respondents (from 92.0% to 98.5% or 6.5 percentage points; 95% CI, 6.1-7.0). This was associated with a 53% reduction compared with the size of the disparity between White and Black individuals before age 65 years (5.7% to 2.7% or 3.0 percentage points; 95% CI, 0.9-5.1; P = .003) and a 51% reduction compared with the size of the disparity between White and Hispanic individuals before age 65 years (14.6% to 7.2% or 7.4 percentage points; 95% CI, 5.3-9.5; P < .001). Medicare eligibility was associated with narrowed disparities between White and Hispanic individuals in access to care, lowering disparities in access to a usual source of care from 10.5% to 7.5% (P = .05), cost-related barriers to care from 11.4% to 6.9% (P < .001), and influenza vaccination rates from 8.1% to 3.3% (P = .01). For disparities between White and Black individuals, access to a usual source of care before and after age 65 years was not significantly different: 1.2% to 0.0% (P = .24), cost-related barriers to care from 5.8% to 4.3% (P = .22), and influenza vaccinations from 11.0% to 10.3% (P = .60). The share of people in poor self-reported health decreased by 3.8 percentage points for Hispanic respondents, 2.6 percentage points for Black respondents, and 0.2 percentage points for White respondents. Mortality-related disparities at age 65 years were unchanged. Medicare's association with reduced disparities largely persisted after the US Affordable Care Act took effect in 2014. Conclusions and Relevance In this cross-sectional study that uses a regression discontinuity design, eligibility for Medicare at age 65 years was associated with marked reductions in racial and ethnic disparities in insurance coverage, access to care, and self-reported health.","Wallace, Jacob; Jiang, Karen; Goldsmith-Pinkham, Paul; Song, Zirui",JAMA internal medicine,189,1

However, uncertainty remains as to how they compare from a clinical, quality of life (QoL) and economic perspective. The study is therefore designed to determine whether SH is more effective and more cost-effective, compared with TH. METHODS/DESIGN eTHoS (either Traditional Haemorrhoidectomy or Stapled Haemorrhoidopexy for Haemorrhoidal Disease) is a pragmatic, multicentre, randomised controlled trial. Currently, 29 secondary care centres are open to recruitment. Patients, aged 18 year or older, with circumferential haemorrhoids grade II to IV, are eligible to take part. The primary clinical and economic outcomes are QoL profile (area under the curve derived from the EuroQol Group's 5 Dimension Health Status Questionnaire (EQ-5D) at all assessment points) and incremental cost per quality adjusted life year (QALY) based on the responses to the EQ-5D at 24 months. The secondary outcomes include a comparison of the SF-36 scores, pain and symptoms sub-domains, disease recurrence, complication rates and direct and indirect costs to the National Health Service (NHS). A sample size of n =338 per group has been calculated to provide 90% power to detect a difference in the mean area under the curve (AUC) of 0.25 standard deviations derived from EQ-5D score measurements, with a two-sided significance level of 5%. Allowing for non-response, 400 participants will be randomised per group. Randomisation will utilise a minimisation algorithm that incorporates centre, grade of haemorrhoidal disease, baseline EQ-5D score and gender. Blinding of participants and outcome assessors is not attempted. DISCUSSION This is one of the largest trials of its kind. In the United Kingdom alone, 29,000 operations for haemorrhoidal disease are done annually. The trial is therefore designed to give robust evidence on which clinicians and health service managers can base management decisions and, more importantly, patients can make informed choices.

METHODS To that end, a staggered irradiation cycle has been applied which included dose rate values from 0.81 to 4.87 cGy/s, achieving a total absorbed dose of 21.4 Gy. The samples have been irradiated with a linear accelerator and the relations between the induced photocurrent and the average and instantaneous dose rates, and between the accumulated charge and the absorbed dose, have been determined. The radiation-induced output currents were measured by means of an external interface of the devices to a previously designed readout unit. RESULTS Experimental results of Si PIN photodiode BPW34S have shown a sensitivity of (13.9 ± 0.5) nC/cGy, slight sensitivity dependence on dose rate, and a high linearity of the current with the average and instantaneous dose rate, requiring only 10 V of reverse bias voltage. This device thermal drift has characterized and modelled for temperature effect compensation. CONCLUSIONS Silicon PIN photodiode BPW34S, previously tested for X-rays and Co-60 gamma ray source, can also be a reliable candidate for dose rate and absorbed skin dose determination in typical radiotherapy treatments irradiations. A low sensitivity loss below 2% up to 21.4 Gy has been measured, allowing its use as an affordable reusable skin dosimeter. Moreover, no significant difference has been observed between its response to dose-per-pulse and changing pulse repetition frequency in terms of sensitivity and dependence with dose-rate value.","Ruiz-García, Isidoro; Román-Raya, Juan; Banqueri, Jesús; Palma, Alberto J; Guirado, Damián; Carvajal, Miguel A",Medical physics,189,1

In this article, we discuss current knowledge of immune responses that confer protection to more than 80% of the people who have been infected and possible mechanisms by which the virus escapes immune surveillance in people who develop severe disease and those who die from the disease. We also discuss the differences in the immune responses by which, in most children, the infection results in only mild disease, although causing severe disease in some adults. Understanding these differences in both the innate and adaptive immune responses among these people can lead to the development of biotherapeutic treatment modalities that could modulate immune responses to offer protection against SARS-CoV-2 and block the ability of the virus to cause severe disease or death in humans.

PATIENTS AND METHODS We prospectively evaluated the performance of a quantitative point-of-care test (POCT) for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. The patient group (PG) comprised of hospitalized confirmed COVID-19 cases. Asymptomatic healthcare volunteers with negative rRT-PCR were included in the control group (CG). Measurement of IgM and IgG was obtained by dry fluorescence immunoassay. RESULTS Twenty-six PG (65.9±15.4 years old, male 57.7%) and 18 CG (45.6±10.1 years old, male 33.3%) were included. By manufacturer's cut-off (≥0.04 mIU/ml), sensitivity and specificity were 73.08% and 88.89% for IgM and 88.46% and 33.33% for IgG, respectively. Estimated areas under the ROC curve were 0.907 and 0.848 for IgM and IgG, respectively. Results were improved using a cut-off of IgM ≥0.05 mIU/ml and IgG ≥0.10 mIU/ml. CONCLUSION Using stringent cut-off values, SARS-CoV-2 antibody POCT detects immune people and can be used during socioeconomic normalization of communities.","Fragkou, Paraskevi C; Papaevangelou, Vassiliki; Antoniadou, Anastasia; Kavvatha, Dimitra; Ploussi, Agapi; Pantazis, Nikos; Sirmpilantze, Tamta; Psarrakis, Christos; Pournaras, Spyridon A; Tsiodras, Sotirios; Kelekis, Alexis",In vivo,189,1

However, the risk factors for extrapulmonary organ injury are still unclear. We aim to explore the risk factors for extrapulmonary organ injury and the association between extrapulmonary organ injury and the prognosis in COVID-19 patients. Methods We implemented a single-center, retrospective, observational study, in which a total of 349 confirmed COVID-19 patients admitted to Tongji Hospital from January 25, 2020, to February 25, 2020, were enrolled. We collected demographic, clinical, laboratory, and treatment data from electronic medical records. Potential risk factors for extrapulmonary organ injury of COVID-19 patients were analyzed by a multivariable binary logistic model, and multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression model was used for survival analysis in the patients with extrapulmonary organ injury. Results The average age of the included patients was 61.73±14.64 years. In the final logistic model, variables including aged 60 or older [odds ratio (OR) 1.826, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.060-3.142], acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (OR 2.748, 95% CI: 1.051-7.185), lymphocytes count lower than 1.1×109/L (OR 0.478, 95% CI: 0.240-0.949), level of interleukin-6 (IL-6) greater than 7 pg/mL (OR 1.664, 95% CI: 1.005-2.751) and D-Dimer greater than 0.5 μg/mL (OR 2.190, 95% CI: 1.176-4.084) were significantly associated with the extrapulmonary organ injury. Kaplan-Meier curve and log-rank test showed that the probabilities of survival for patients with extrapulmonary organ injury were significantly lower than those without extrapulmonary organ injury. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards model showed that only myocardial injury (P=0.000, HR: 5.068, 95% CI: 2.728-9.417) and circulatory system injury (P=0.000, HR: 4.076, 95% CI: 2.216-7.498) were the independent factors associated with COVID-19 patients' poor prognosis. Conclusions Older age, lymphocytopenia, high level of D-Dimer and IL-6, and the severity of lung injury were the high-risk factors of extrapulmonary organ injury in COVID-19 patients. Myocardial and circulatory system injury were the most important risk factors related to poor outcomes of COVID-19 patients. It may help clinicians to identify extrapulmonary organ injury early and initiate appropriate treatment.","Huang, Fang; Ma, Wenxia; Zheng, Hui; Ye, Yan; Chen, Hui; Su, Nan; Li, Xiaoping; Li, Xinyue; Wang, Yuyu; Jin, Jun; Yu, Zhengyuan; Li, Yongsheng; Wang, Jun",Annals of translational medicine,189,20

Knowing how physician-educators find their way among different communities of practice (i.e., their landscape of practice) has implications for professional development but limited description in the literature. In this longitudinal qualitative research, we explored how physicians who pursue graduate degrees in medical education navigate their landscape of practice. METHODS 11/29 physicians in one cohort of a masters in medical education program were interviewed annually from 2016 (program start) to 2020 (2 years post-graduation). We iteratively collected and analyzed data, creating inductive codes and categorizing coded data by mode of identification (engagement, imagination, alignment) and time. We organized narratives into time-ordered data matrices so that final analysis wove together mode, time, and participant. RESULTS All participants consistently spoke of navigating their landscape of practice, which included the community created in the graduate program; but that single community ""doesn't define the journey itself."" They shifted engagement from teaching individual learners to translating what they learned in the graduate program to develop educational projects and produce scholarship. They shifted imagination from relying on internal and external assessments to experience-inspired versions of their future self. And they shifted alignment from belonging to the graduate program's community of practice, then belonging to different communities in their landscape of practice, and ultimately focusing on communities that mattered most to them. DISCUSSION Physicians in a graduate program in medical education navigated their dynamic landscape of practice by shifting how they engaged in medical education, as well as what they imagined and who they aligned with as physician-educators. Our work offers novel insights into how knowledgeability emerges through time as overlapping modes of identification.","Balmer, Dorene F; Rosenblatt, Samuel; Boyer, Donald",Medical education,189,1

We compared the technical, imaging, and clinical outcomes of MT performed with either TREVO or Capture LP devices. METHODS There were 42 and 43 patients in the TREVO and Capture LP groups, respectively. Baseline variables, technical outcome (Thrombolysis In Cerebral Infarction, TICI), 24 hours imaging outcome, and 3-month clinical outcome (modified Rankin Scale, mRS) were prospectively recorded. The patients were stratified according to clot location, groups compared, and logistic regression models devised to study the effect of device selection on the clinical outcome. RESULTS The technical success rates were equal in both proximal (internal carotid artery and proximal M1 segment) and distal occlusions (distal M1 and M2 segments). The proportion of TICI 2b or 3 was 96% and 87% with TREVO and 87% and 89% with Capture LP (p=0.25 and p=0.80, respectively). Device selection did not significantly predict good clinical outcome (mRS ≤2) in either proximal or distal occlusions. In multivariate analysis, selecting Capture LP borderline significantly increased the odds of an excellent outcome close to sixfold both in proximal and distal occlusions (OR 6.7, 95% CI 0.82 to 53.7, p=0.08 and OR 5.7, 95% CI 0.88 to 37.8, p=0.07, respectively). CONCLUSIONS TREVO and Capture LP perform equally well in proximal and distal occlusions in the anterior circulation when technical and good clinical outcome are considered. Capture LP may have a small advantage in reaching mRS ≤1 at 3 months. However, this needs to be confirmed in a randomized study.","Protto, Sara; Pienimäki, Juha-Pekka; Seppänen, Janne; Matkaselkä, Ira; Ollikainen, Jyrki; Numminen, Heikki; Sillanpää, Niko",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,189,1

The purpose of this study was to determine the relationship between adenovirus infection and KD using a cohort study in Taiwan. METHODS We used Taiwan National Health Insurance data (from 2000 to 2008) to conduct a population-based cohort study, analyzing children that was under 18 years of age. In total, 5,280 children had adenovirus infection, and 5,280 children without adenovirus infection were matched and followed up. Subsequent KD was the major outcome event. The Cox proportional hazards model was used to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) of developing KD associated with adenovirus infection. RESULTS There was a significantly higher cumulative incidence of KD in the adenovirus-infected cohort than that in the non-infected cohort (log-rank test, p < 0.001). In the adenovirus-infected cohort, overall incidence of KD was 5.29 times higher than that of the non-infected cohort (adjusted HR 5.29, 95% CI: 2.48-11.3). Increased KD risk was associated with previous adenovirus infection in children aged 3 to 5 years, in female patients, in those with a low urbanization level, and in those with allergies. CONCLUSION An association between previous adenovirus infection and KD was identified in Taiwanese children, but other potential risk factors were not fully analyzed. The relationship between infection and KD requires further study.","Huang, Shih-Hui; Chen, Chun-Yu; Weng, Ken-Pen; Chien, Kuang-Jen; Hung, Yao-Min; Hsieh, Kai-Sheng; Lin, Chu-Chuan; Cheng, Ming-Fang; Lin, Cheng-Li; Wei, James Cheng-Chung",Journal of the Chinese Medical Association : JCMA,189,1

Mangrove ecosystem services, such as erosion prevention, shoreline protection and mitigation of climate change (through carbon sequestration), depend on the size and arrangement of forest patches, but we know little about broad-scale patterns of mangrove forest fragmentation. Here we conduct a multi-scale analysis using global estimates of mangrove density and regional drivers of mangrove deforestation to map relationships between habitat loss and fragmentation. Mangrove fragmentation was ubiquitous; however, there are geographic disparities between mangrove loss and fragmentation; some regions, like Cambodia and the southern Caribbean, had relatively little loss, but their forests have been extensively fragmented. In Southeast Asia, a global hotspot of mangrove loss, the conversion of forests to aquaculture and rice plantations were the biggest drivers of loss (>50%) and fragmentation. Surprisingly, conversion of forests to oil palm plantations, responsible for >15% of all deforestation in Southeast Asia, was only weakly correlated with mangrove fragmentation. Thus, the management of different deforestation drivers may increase or decrease fragmentation. Our findings suggest that large scale monitoring of mangrove forests should also consider fragmentation. This work highlights that regional priorities for conservation based on forest loss rates can overlook fragmentation and associated loss of ecosystem functionality.","Bryan-Brown, Dale N; Connolly, Rod M; Richards, Daniel R; Adame, Fernanda; Friess, Daniel A; Brown, Christopher J",Scientific reports,189,1

In a fresh cadaver, 20 cc of hydrogel was injected transperineally into Denonvilliers' space under transrectal ultrasound guidance. Successful expansion of Denonvilliers' space was achieved with a range of 9-11 mm thickness covering the entire posterior prostate surface. Two freeze-thaw cycles were used to expand the iceball reaching the rectal wall as an end-point. Intraoperative transrectal ultrasound monitoring and temperature mapping in Denonvilliers' space by multiple thermocouples documented real-time iceball expansion up to 10 mm beyond the prostate, and safety in protecting the rectal wall from thermal injury. The lowest temperatures of the thermocouples with a distance of 0 mm, 5 mm and 10 mm from the prostate were: -35°C, -18°C and 0°C (P < 0.001), respectively. In gross and microscopic examination, the hydrogel mass measured 11 × 40 × 34 mm, which was identical to the intraoperative transrectal ultrasound measurements, there was no infiltration of the hydrogel into the rectal wall or prostate and no injury to the pelvic organs. In conclusion, the expansion of Denonvilliers' space by transperineal injection of hydrogel is feasible and a promising technique to facilitate energy-based focal therapy of prostate cancer.","de Castro Abreu, Andre Luis; Ma, Yanling; Shoji, Sunao; Marien, Arnaud; Leslie, Scott; Gill, Inderbir; Ukimura, Osamu",International journal of urology : official journal of the Japanese Urological Association,189,16

It is a safe therapy, with few potential risks even if administered at high concentration. Inhaled NO gas is routinely used to increase systemic oxygenation in different disease conditions. The administration of high concentrations of NO also exerts a virucidal effect in vitro. Owing to its favorable pharmacodynamic and safety profiles, the familiarity in its use by critical care providers, and the potential for a direct virucidal effect, NO is clinically used in patients with coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). Nevertheless, no device is currently available to easily administer inhaled NO at concentrations higher than 80 parts per million (ppm) at various inspired oxygen fractions, without the need for dedicated, heavy, and costly equipment. The development of a reliable, safe, inexpensive, lightweight, and ventilator-free solution is crucial, particularly for the early treatment of non-intubated patients outside of the intensive care unit (ICU) and in a limited-resource scenario. To overcome such a barrier, a simple system for the non-invasive NO gas administration up to 250 ppm was developed using standard consumables and a scavenging chamber. The method has been proven safe and reliable in delivering a specified NO concentration while limiting nitrogen dioxide levels. This paper aims to provide clinicians and researchers with the necessary information on how to assemble or adapt such a system for research purposes or clinical use in COVID-19 or other diseases in which NO administration might be beneficial.","Pinciroli, Riccardo; Traeger, Lisa; Fischbach, Anna; Gianni, Stefano; Morais, Caio Cesar Araujo; Fakhr, Bijan Safaee; Di Fenza, Raffaele; Robinson, Dianna; Carroll, Ryan; Zapol, Warren M; Berra, Lorenzo",Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,189,1

METHODS We performed a prospective analysis of patients with intracranial LVO who underwent successful MT and received a 1.5 T MRI including diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) in standard- and high-resolution as well as susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) on the day following the intervention. Reperfusion grade was assessed on post-thrombectomy digital subtraction angiography (DSA) using the expanded thrombolysis in cerebral infarction (eTICI) scale. Punctuate DWI lesions distal to the DWI core lesion were classified as peripheral emboli. DWI lesions outside the primary affected vascular territory were classified as emboli into new territories. Additionally, SWI and post-thrombectomy DSA were analyzed and correlated to findings on DWI. RESULTS Twenty-eight patients undergoing successful MT met the inclusion criteria. In 26/28 patients (93%), a total of 324 embolic lesions were detected in DWI representing 2.1% of the cumulated ischemic core volume. 151 peripheral emboli were detected in standard-resolution DWI, 173 additional emboli were uncovered in high-resolution DWI. Eight out of nine patients with an eTICI 3 reperfusion had embolic lesions (29 DWI lesions). 9.6% (31/324) of peripheral emboli were observed in vascular territories not affected by the LVO. SWI lesions were observed in close proximity to 10.2% (33/324) of DWI lesions. CONCLUSIONS Peripheral emboli are frequent after MT even after complete reperfusion. These emboli occur rather in the vascular territory of the occluded vessel than in other territories. A large proportion of peripheral emboli is only detected by high-resolution DWI.","Schönfeld, Michael H; Kabiri, Reza; Kniep, Helge C; Meyer, Lukas; Sedlacik, Jan; Ernst, Marielle; Broocks, Gabriel; Faizy, Tobias D; Cheng, Bastian; Thomalla, Götz; Fiehler, Jens; Hanning, Uta",Journal of neurology,189,1

METHODS Two patients with mild haemophilia A underwent surgery (laparoscopic appendectomy and inguinal hernia repair). In both patients, the replacement therapy, with factor VIII, started 30 min before surgery. We used the available surgical technologies and techniques with a proven value in the best clinical practice, to achieve proper and permanent hemostasis. Postoperatively, the replacement therapy and thromboembolic prophylaxis was continued according to the international guidelines for the management of haemophilia. RESULTS The operative and post-operative periods were uneventful. No significant differences were found in the operation time in our hemophilic patients versus non-hemophilic patients. Significant differences related to the hospital stay duration were found in both patients compared with controls, due to the necessary replacement therapy. CONCLUSION With new surgical technologies, proper and permanent hemostasis can be achieved, without prolonging the operation time.","Panovski, Milcho J; Fildishevski, Igor V; Ognjenovic, Ljubomir Lj; Dejanova-Ilijevska, Violeta I",Open access Macedonian journal of medical sciences,189,1

METHODS This was a retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data in two hospitals in the Netherlands. Consecutive patients undergoing MI-ILE were included. A Jackson-Pratt drain next to the dorsal side of the anastomosis and bilateral chest drains were placed at the end of the thoracoscopic procedure. Amylase levels in drain fluid were determined in all patients during at least the first four postoperative days. Contrast computed tomography scans and/or endoscopic imaging were performed in cases of a clinically suspected AL. Anastomotic leakage was defined as any sign of leakage of the esophago-gastric anastomosis on endoscopy, re-operation, radiographic investigations, post mortal examination or when gastro-intestinal contents were found in drain fluid. Receiver operator characteristic curves were used to determine the cut-off values. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, risk ratio and overall test accuracy were calculated for elevated drain amylase concentrations. RESULTS A total of 89 patients were included between March 2013 and August 2014. No differences in group characteristics were observed between patients with and without AL, except for age. Patients with AL were older than were patients without AL (P = 0.01). One patient (1.1%) without AL died within 30 d after surgery due to pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Anastomotic leakage that required any intervention occurred in 15 patients (16.9%). Patients with proven anastomotic leakage had higher drain amylase levels than patients without anastomotic leakage [median 384 IU/L (IQR 34-6263) vs median 37 IU/L (IQR 26-66), P = 0.003]. Optimal cut-off values on postoperative days 1, 2, and 3 were 350 IU/L, 200 IU/L and 160 IU/L, respectively. An elevated amylase level was found in 9 of the 15 patients with AL. Five of these 9 patients had early elevations of their amylase levels, with a median of 2 d (IQR 2-5) before signs and symptoms occurred. CONCLUSION Measurement of drain amylase levels is an inexpensive and easy tool that may be used to screen for anastomotic leakage soon after MI-ILE. However, clinical validation of this marker is necessary.","Berkelmans, Gijs H K; Kouwenhoven, Ewout A; Smeets, Boudewijn J J; Weijs, Teus J; Silva Corten, Luis C; van Det, Marc J; Nieuwenhuijzen, Grard A P; Luyer, Misha D P",World journal of gastroenterology,189,1

Pregnancy is considered as a critical period of exposure to BPA because of the foetal sensitivity to endocrine disruption. Because of its wide use in food packaging, BPA is found in common foods and in infant formulae. We used a lifetime approach to simulate dietary exposure trajectories of a French population and to assess the associated health risk. Moreover, a semi-physiological based toxicokinetic model was used to simulate the maternal-foetal exchanges of BPA during pregnancy. Metabolism was taken into account by considering the glucuronidation of BPA by the foetal-placental unit, as well as the reactivation of BPA-glucuronide into BPA in the foetal compartment. From maternal critical daily exposures defined by ANSES based on effects for different endpoints of BPA in the unborn child (i.e. 0.083, 0.17, 0.29 and 0.33 μg/kg bw/d, respectively based on effects on mammary gland, brain and behaviour, metabolism and obesity and female reproductive system), resulting concentrations of BPA in the foetal compartment were estimated and health risk was assessed for the sub-population of unborn children. This work leads to the conclusion that while a health risk due to dietary exposures of the general population can be excluded, this is not the case for the sub-population of pregnant women, in view of the levels of foetal exposure to BPA.","Pruvost-Couvreur, Manon; Picard-Hagen, Nicole; Le Bizec, Bruno; Rivière, Gilles",International journal of hygiene and environmental health,189,16

Understanding how somatic mutations accumulate in cancer genomes and the underlying factors that generate somatic mutations is therefore crucial for developing novel therapeutic strategies. To understand the interplay between spatial genome organization and specific mutational processes, we studied 3,000 tumor-normal-pair whole-genome datasets from 42 different human cancer types. Our analyses reveal that the change in somatic mutational load in cancer genomes is co-localized with topologically-associating-domain boundaries. Domain boundaries constitute a better proxy to track mutational load change than replication timing measurements. We show that different mutational processes lead to distinct somatic mutation distributions where certain processes generate mutations in active domains, and others generate mutations in inactive domains. Overall, the interplay between three-dimensional genome organization and active mutational processes has a substantial influence on the large-scale mutation-rate variations observed in human cancers.","Akdemir, Kadir C; Le, Victoria T; Kim, Justin M; Killcoyne, Sarah; King, Devin A; Lin, Ya-Ping; Tian, Yanyan; Inoue, Akira; Amin, Samirkumar B; Robinson, Frederick S; Nimmakayalu, Manjunath; Herrera, Rafael E; Lynn, Erica J; Chan, Kin; Seth, Sahil; Klimczak, Leszek J; Gerstung, Moritz; Gordenin, Dmitry A; O'Brien, John; Li, Lei; Deribe, Yonathan Lissanu; Verhaak, Roel G; Campbell, Peter J; Fitzgerald, Rebecca; Morrison, Ashby J; Dixon, Jesse R; Andrew Futreal, P",Nature genetics,189,31

Morbidity and mortality caused by this virus are alarming for the possible increased threat to human health. A Suitable diagnostic test is the prerequisite for designing and developing control measures. But, the tests being employed at present possess one or the other drawback for this disease diagnosis. During the dengue virus infections, NS2B is essential for the stability and catalytic activity of the NS3 protease. N-terminal 185 amino acids of NS3 protease domain along with hydrophilic portion of NS2B (NS2BNS3pro) is being used to screen dengue inhibitors but not for diagnosis until now. In the present study, we have used purified NS2BNS3pro as an antigen to trap anti-NS2BNS3pro antibodies of the clinical samples. Antibodies were detected successfully in both western blotting and ELISA tests. In ELISA, antibodies were detected in both primary and secondary infections of all serotypes. Interestingly, 17 samples declared as other febrile infections by NS1 and IgM/IgG tests were found to be positive in present test, which were further confirmed by RT-PCR. In silico studies suggested the absence of conserved epitopes between NS2BNS3pro and the counterpart in JEV, Zika, and CHIKV, indicating less possibility of crossreaction, which was in turn confirmed by using synthetic peptides representing the above epitopes. Statistical analysis with 76% specificity, 87% sensitivity, and 95% concordance also supported the present test as a suitable test for large scale diagnosis of dengue virus infections.

This requires a room with supervision and presence of technologists and trained sleep experts. Today, clinical guidelines in most countries recommend home sleep apnoea testing with simple systems using six signals only. If criteria for signal quality, recording conditions, and patient selection are considered, then this is a reliable test with high accuracy. RECENT FINDINGS Recently diagnostic tools for sleep apnoea diagnosis become even more simple: smartwatches and wearables with smart apps claim to diagnose sleep apnoea when these devices are tracking sleep and sleep quality as part of new consumer health checking. Alternative and new devices range from excellent diagnostic tools with high accuracy and full validation studies down to very low-quality tools which only result in random diagnostic reports. Due to the high prevalence of sleep apnoea, even a random diagnosis may match a real disorder sometimes. SUMMARY Until now, there are no metrics established how to evaluate these alternative algorithms and simple devices. Proposals for evaluating smartwatches, smartphones, single-use sensors, and new algorithms are presented. New assessments may help to overcome current limitations in sleep apnoea severity metrics.

OBJECTIVES We performed two-port MCAP (with an additional port using a multi-channel device through the umbilicus) without a suspension suture in a group of patients. We compared the results of this technique to the LC and SILC techniques. MATERIAL AND METHODS A total of 90 patients with gallbladder disease were included in the study. LC (n = 30) and SILC (n = 30) were performed in two groups. The other group underwent cholecystectomy (MCAP) by using an additional 5 mm port through the subxiphoid region with a multi-channel port through the transumblical. A transabdominal suspension suture was not used for the patients in this group. The surgery duration, estimated blood loss, length of hospitalization, visual analogue scale (VAS) score in the postoperative 1st and 7th day, need for analgesia in the postoperative period and complications, and the conversion rate were compared between the three methods. RESULTS A total of 62 females (68.9%) and 28 males (31.1%) participated in the study. MCAP duration was significantly shorter than LC and SILC (38.1 ± 16.6, 49.4 ± 15.8, 77.8 ± 26.7 min respectively) (p < 0.05). The conversion rate was similar in all three groups. Hernia developed in the port area in two patients after SILC (6.7%). No significant difference was found between the groups for the other data we compared. CONCLUSIONS MCAP seems to be an easier technique with a shorter operation time compared to the other two techniques. However, there is a need for other studies to evaluate the cosmetic results.","Sulu, Barlas; Allahverdi, Tulay D; Altun, Hasan; Koksal, Neset",Advances in clinical and experimental medicine : official organ Wroclaw Medical University,189,12

On March 19, 2020, the County of Los Angeles issued the Safer at Home order as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. This curtailed driving and decreased the number of breath alcohol tests that were conducted in Los Angeles County. The number of breath tests conducted in January-February of 2019 and 2020 and March-April of 2019 and 2020 were evaluated using Fisher's exact test and analysis of variance. There was a statistically significant decrease in the overall number of breath tests conducted in Los Angeles County in March-April of 2020. There was also a significant decrease in the number of collisions where DUI was a factor. Accounting for changes in traffic volumes, the number of breath tests per vehicle miles driven also decreased significantly. Since the Safer at Home order closed all non-essential services such as bars and restaurants, there is indirect data on the relative contribution of liquor-serving establishments, and to some extent large social gatherings, to the incidence of drunk driving. Taking into account traffic volume, it was determined that the odds of encountering an intoxicated driver decreased by approximately 23% during the Safer at Home period.

This can be achieved by conventional ligations or new instruments as harmonic scissors or bipolar devices. In the present study, we report our experience with a new bipolar thermofusion vessel sealing system (TVS) compared to conventional vessel ligation (CVL). METHODS This prospective non-randomized study included 186 patients operated on by two surgeons between April and November 2007. Age, gender, preoperative diagnosis, type of surgery, operative time, and complications were prospectively collected. TVS was used in 93 patients (29 M, 64 F; mean age 50+/-14 years, range 11-83) and CVL in 93 patients (27 M, 66 F; mean age 49+/-14 years, range 16-82). Results and postoperative complications were registered. RESULTS Postoperative complications included two cases of transient hypocalcaemia in both groups 1 (TVS group) and 2 (CVL group) hemorrhages requiring reoperation (p = ns). No recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy was observed in both groups. A drain was used in 25 cases in the TVS group and in 47 patients in the CVL group (p<0.008). Mean operative time for total thyroidectomy was significantly shorter in the TVS group (73+/-18 min, range=35-110) than in the CVL group (18+/-20 min, range = 40 -130; p<0.01). No differences were found for lobectomies or subtotal thyroidectomies. CONCLUSION TVS is safe with a similar complication rate as CVL.

Endogenous NO produced by nitric oxide synthases regulates multiple signaling cascades, including activation of soluble guanylate cyclase to generate cGMP, relaxing smooth muscle cells. Inhaled NO is an established therapy for pulmonary hypertension in neonates, and has been recently proposed for treatment of hypoxic respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome due to COVID-19. In this review, we summarize the effects of endogenous and exogenous NO on protein S-nitrosylation, which is the selective and reversible covalent attachment of a nitrogen monoxide group to the thiol side chain of cysteine. This post-translational modification targets specific cysteines based on the acid/base sequence of surrounding residues, with significant impacts on protein interactions and function. S-nitrosothiol (SNO) formation is tightly compartmentalized and enzymatically controlled, but also propagated by non-enzymatic transnitrosylation of downstream protein targets. Redox-based nitrosylation and denitrosylation pathways dynamically regulate the equilibrium of SNO-proteins. We review the physiological roles of SNO proteins, including nitrosohemoglobin and autoregulation of blood flow through hypoxic vasodilation, and pathological effects of nitrosylation including inhibition of critical vasodilator enzymes; and discuss the intersection of NO source and dose with redox environment, in determining the effects of protein nitrosylation.

Molecular mechanisms that direct the extent of the foreign body reaction to implanted materials are poorly understood. This study compares the influence of three macroporous meshes on the expression of genes critical for wound healing and extracellular matrix remodeling in a rat model. Full thickness abdominal wall defects were corrected with polypropylene, polyester, polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), or suture repair with no mesh. Explants were harvested 7 or 90 days after repair and were divided for histological, immunohistochemical, and mRNA analyses. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction arrays were used to profile the expression of 84 genes involved in angiogenesis at the tissue-mesh interface. Evaluation of gene expression profiles and histologic specimens revealed that polypropylene and polyester induced a greater and more persistent inflammatory response than PTFE, which elicited a response most similar to that induced by suture repair. Mesh implantation induced the differential expression (>3-fold change and p < .01) of genes encoding inflammatory cytokines, growth factors, and extracellular matrix proteins relative to suture repair without mesh. Genes most markedly upregulated included the neutrophil chemoattractant CXCL2 and matrix metalloproteinases 3 and 9. Polyester induced the greatest number of differentially expressed genes relative to suture repair both at 7 and 90 days after implantation. Results from this study suggest that the particular type of mesh used in a hernia repair may affect the patient's wound healing response and clinical outcome.","Asarias, Jennifer R; Nguyen, Phuoc T; Mings, Jamie R; Gehrich, Alan P; Pierce, Lisa M",Journal of investigative surgery : the official journal of the Academy of Surgical Research,189,1

In this paper, we investigated how exposure to media texts containing alarming and militaristic language affects peoples' notions regarding COVID-19 and the consequences of this effect on public health. Methods The participants filled a questionnaire in which they were asked to read a passage including either alarming and militaristic or neutral terminology on COVID-19, and then answer four questions on a Likert-point scale. The questions assessed the participants' notions on the end of the pandemic, the vaccine effectiveness, and the consequences on the economies and mental health. Ordinal regression models in R were used for the analysis. Results Individuals who were exposed to alarming and militaristic language developed more pessimistic notions regarding COVID-19 in comparison to those who were exposed to a more neutral language. However, both groups of individuals had similar notions regarding vaccine effectiveness. Conclusion The media should redefine the language they use for the description of the pandemic, considering that the extensive use of alarming and militaristic terminology may have a negative impact on public health.","Georgiou, Georgios P",Epidemiology and health,189,31

We developed and validated such a model to predict colorectal cancer death within 90, 180 and 365 days after diagnosis. METHODS Cohort study using linked national cancer and death records. The development population included 27,480 patients diagnosed in England in 2015. The test populations were diagnosed in England in 2016 (n = 26,411) and Wales in 2015-2016 (n = 3814). Predictors were age, gender, socioeconomic status, referral source, performance status, tumour site, TNM stage and treatment intent. Cox regression models were assessed using Brier scores, c-indices and calibration plots. RESULTS In the development population, 7.4, 11.7 and 17.9% of patients died from colorectal cancer within 90, 180 and 365 days after diagnosis. T4 versus T1 tumour stage had the largest adjusted association with the outcome (HR 4.67; 95% CI: 3.59-6.09). C-indices were 0.873-0.890 (England) and 0.856-0.873 (Wales) in the test populations, indicating excellent separation of predicted risks by outcome status. Models were generally well calibrated. CONCLUSIONS The model was valid for predicting short-term colorectal cancer mortality.

Therefore, new methods of treatment, as well as prevention, need to be investigated. A group of compounds that should be considered for use in respiratory diseases is cannabinoids. There are three groups of cannabinoids - plant-derived phytocannabinoids, synthetic cannabinoids, and endogenous endocannabinoids including the enzymes responsible for their synthesis and degradation. All cannabinoids exert their biological effects through either type 1 cannabinoid receptors (CB1) and/or type 2 cannabinoid receptors (CB2). In numerous studies (in vitro and in vivo), cannabinoids and inhibitors of endocannabinoid degradation have shown beneficial anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, anti-cancer, and anti-fibrotic properties. Although in the respiratory system, most of the studies have focused on the positive properties of cannabinoids and inhibitors of endocannabinoid degradation. There are few research reports discussing the negative impact of these compounds. This review summarizes the properties and mechanisms of action of cannabinoids and inhibitors of endocannabinoid degradation in various models of respiratory diseases. A short description of the effects selected cannabinoids have on the human respiratory system and their possible use in the fight against COVID-19 is also presented. Additionally, a brief summary is provided of cannabinoid receptors properties and their expression in the respiratory system and cells of the immune system.","Kicman, Aleksandra; Pędzińska-Betiuk, Anna; Kozłowska, Hanna",European journal of pharmacology,189,24

METHODS Two observers independently examined the CT images of COVID-19 patients, and the SCT severity score was calculated. The SCT score was calculated as the sum of values ranging from 0 to 4, according to the volumetric rate of involvement for each lung lobe. In quantitative assessment, total lung volume (TLV) was automatically calculated from CT density values between -200 and -950 HU. Besides, healthy lung volume (HLV) was calculated from voxels between -800 and -950 HU. The QCT score was calculated with the following formula: (TLV - HLV / TLV) ×100. All patients were clinically divided into four groups: mild, common, severe, and critical. Interobserver agreement for SCT assessment was investigated using the Cohen's Kappa statistics (κ). Pearson's correlation coefficient was used for the relationship between continuous data. The diagnostic accuracy of SCT and QCT in the differentiation of clinically limited (mild, common) and extensive (severe, critical) disease was investigated using ROC analysis. RESULTS Seventy-six patients with a diagnosis of COVID-19 were included. There was good agreement between the two observers in the SCT evaluation of pulmonary disease severity (κ = 0.796; 95% CI, 0.751-0.841). A significant correlation was found between QCT and SCT scores (P < 0.001, r = 0.661). Both QCT and SCT scores showed a significant correlation with clinical severity score (P < 0.001, r = 0.620 and P = 0.004, r = 0.529, respectively). The ROC analysis revealed the AUC of QCT and SCT for differentiation of limited and extensive disease as 0.873 (95% CI, 0.774-0.972) and 0.816 (95% CI, 0.673-0.959), respectively. CONCLUSION The QCT assessment is an objective method in the evaluation of COVID-19 severity and is more successful than semiquantitative CT assessment to discriminate extensive from limited disease.","Ufuk, Furkan; Demirci, Mahmut; Uğurlu, Erhan; Çetin, Nazlı; Yiğit, Nilüfer; Sarı, Tuğba",Diagnostic and interventional radiology,189,31

We aimed to evaluate the association between OLFM4 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and septic shock-related death in 175 patients who underwent major surgery, as well as its performance in predicting mortality. MATERIALS AND METHODS We carried out a retrospective study. A total of seven OLFM4 SNPs were genotyped by Agena Bioscience's MassARRAY platform. Statistical analysis was performed by Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression tests. The diagnostic performance for predicting septic shock-related death was evaluated by the area under the receiver-operating characteristic (AUROC) curve. RESULTS Patients with rs17552047 A allele and rs1891944 TT genotype had higher survival than patients with rs17552047 G allele (p-value=0.024) and patients with rs1891944 CC/CT genotype (p-value=0.038). However, only rs17552047 was associated with a lower risk of death under an additive inheritance model (adjusted hazard ratio (aHR)=0.44, 95%CI=0.27-0.71). The multivariate model with the most significant clinical variables (lactate, chronic kidney disease, peritonitis, heart disease, and elective surgery), showed an AUROC of 0.776 for predicting septic shock-related death. When we added the OLFM4 rs17552047 SNP to the previous model, the AUROC was 0.811 and was close to reaching significant differences with the previous model (p-value=0.065). CONCLUSION OLFM4 rs17552047 A allele predicts septic shock survival in patients who underwent major surgery. Furthermore, rs17552047, together with clinical variables, could be useful to predict the outcome of septic shock.","Pérez-García, Felipe; Resino, Salvador; Gómez-Sánchez, Esther; Gonzalo-Benito, Hugo; Fernández-Rodríguez, Amanda; Lorenzo-López, Mario; Heredia-Rodríguez, María; Gómez-Pesquera, Estefanía; Tamayo, Eduardo; Jiménez-Sousa, Maria Ángeles",European journal of clinical investigation,189,19

Results revealed that the intensity of response for most blood biochemical parameters increased significantly and were different from the baseline values taken while the animals were in Darwin Port, Australia. Haematological results obtained also revealed a significant increase and were different from the baseline values. Cortisol and APP (bovine alpha 1-acid glycoprotein and serum amyloid-A) values increased significantly and were different from the baseline values. Haematological parameters, APP, cortisol and EEG data (alpha, beta, delta and theta waves, total power and median frequency) decreased significantly following 4 and 7 days post-transport, suggesting a recovery of the animals from the stressfulness of transport.

A difficult airway was created with a cervical collar, limiting mouth opening and neck movement. Primary outcome was first-attempt orotracheal intubation success. Overall success, laryngeal view, intubation difficulty scale, handling, intubation times and side-effects were secondary outcomes. First-attempt success rates were: KingVision 90% (95% CI 83-94%), Airtraq 82% (74-88%), A.P. Advance MAC 49% (40-58%), Macintosh 44% (35-53%; p < 0.001).

Advance MAC and the Macintosh laryngoscope. Also, performance was better with the KingVision and the Airtraq in terms of overall success, laryngeal view, intubation difficulty scale and quality of view. Problems with tube advancement were a frequent cause of intubation failure. In summary, the KingVision and the Airtraq performed better than the A.P. Advance MAC and the Macintosh laryngoscope. Success rates of the unchannelled KingVision and Airtraq were similar to those of their channelled versions reported previously, indicating that performance largely depends on blade design rather than the presence of a channel for tube advancement.","Kleine-Brueggeney, M; Buttenberg, M; Greif, R; Nabecker, S; Theiler, L",Anaesthesia,189,1

There have been social historical inquiries investigating the organic relationship between medicine and society, and there has been a study overcoming the traditional nationalistic dichotomous approach. A social historical perspective has been used to analyze the issues of knowledge and politics; the time period of its application was clustered around the colonial period. The condition of colonialism is both important and convenient for analyzing how and to what extent medicine, which is usually deemed neutral, contains a will of authority. Building on existing research, an attempt to understand a subject based on a combination of various elements or from various angles is needed. Accumulating empirical data is important to further advance related research. It is necessary to verify the accuracy of basic facts and build up verified facts. Sometimes theories are applied to research on the history of medicine. However, they are merely a passive application of existing theories and fail to lead to modification and fortification of the theories based on the case of Korea, let alone the establishment of an independent theory. Accumulating empirical studies would help create a unique theory for the Korean case. To establish a new theory, characteristics of the Korean case need to be identified, which have been formed by the Korean tradition.

This cell subset is activated in a TCR-dependent and MHC-unrestricted fashion by so-called phosphoantigens (PAgs). PAgs can be microbial [(E)-4-hydroxy-3-methyl-but-2-enyl pyrophosphate, HMBPP] or endogenous (isopentenyl pyrophosphate, IPP) and PAg sensing depends on the expression of B7-like butyrophilin (BTN3A, CD277) molecules. IPP increases in some transformed or aminobisphosphonate-treated cells, rendering those cells a target for Vγ9Vδ2 T cells in immunotherapy. Yet, functional Vγ9Vδ2 T cells have only been described in humans and higher primates. Using a genome-based study, we showed in silico translatable genes encoding Vγ9, Vδ2, and BTN3 in a few nonprimate mammalian species. Here, with the help of new monoclonal antibodies, we directly identified a T cell population in the alpaca (Vicugna pacos), which responds to PAgs in a BTN3-dependent fashion and shows typical TRGV9- and TRDV2-like rearrangements. T cell receptor (TCR) transductants and BTN3-deficient human 293T cells reconstituted with alpaca or human BTN3 or alpaca/human BTN3 chimeras showed that alpaca Vγ9Vδ2 TCRs recognize PAg in the context of human and alpaca BTN3. Furthermore, alpaca BTN3 mediates PAg recognition much better than human BTN3A1 alone and this improved functionality mapped to the transmembrane/cytoplasmic part of alpaca BTN3. In summary, we found remarkable similarities but also instructive differences of PAg-recognition by human and alpaca, which help in better understanding the molecular mechanisms controlling the activation of this prominent population of γδ T cells.","Fichtner, Alina S; Karunakaran, Mohindar M; Gu, Siyi; Boughter, Christopher T; Borowska, Marta T; Starick, Lisa; Nöhren, Anna; Göbel, Thomas W; Adams, Erin J; Herrmann, Thomas",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,189,24

Different from the conventional trapping behavior in solution, the assembly grows from the focus to the outside along the surface and contains needle structures expanding radially in all directions. Upon switching off the trapping laser, the assembly disperses and needle structures disappear, while the highly concentrated domain of the NPs is left for a while. The single assembly is quickly restored by switching on the laser again, where the needle structures are also reproduced but in a different way. When a single 10 μm PS microparticle (MP) is trapped in the NP solution, a single disc-like assembly containing needle structures is similarly prepared outside the MP. Based on backscattering imaging and tracking analyses of the MP at the solution surface, it is proposed that scattering and propagation of the trapping laser from the central part of the NP assembly or the MP lead to this new phenomenon.","Wu, Chi-Lung; Wang, Shun-Fa; Kudo, Tetsuhiro; Yuyama, Ken-Ichi; Sugiyama, Teruki; Masuhara, Hiroshi",Langmuir : the ACS journal of surfaces and colloids,189,1

Till date, SARS-CoV-2 infection is still spreading, representing a major threat to public health, where several control measures are being practiced in order to culminate its spread. The research and development of new drugs require a lot of funding in addition to being a slow and costly process. As a result, new techniques have been proposed to streamline this process. The repositioning or repurposing of drugs represents an attractive strategy, presenting a promising way to introduce new drugs. Currently, numerous reused drugs are already available in the market and are in practice. In this review, it was observed that the antiviral drugs Entricitabine and Tenofovir display potential therapeutic efficacy in preclinical studies. Therefore, in silico analyses were considered a potential tool for predicting the effectiveness of drugs, mainly as an effective approach to encourage a complementary in vitro and in vivo antiviral evaluation.","Rocha, Yasmim Mendes; de Moura, Gabriel Acácio; de Oliveira, Juliana Ramos; de Figueiredo Nicolete, Larissa Deadame; Nicolete, Roberto",Current medicinal chemistry,189,14

Besides well-established imaging techniques such O-(2-[18F]fluoroethyl)-L-tyrosine (FET)-PET and dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC) perfusion imaging, amide proton transfer-weighted (APTw) imaging has emerged as a promising novel MR technique. In this study, we aimed to better understand the relation between these imaging biomarkers and how well they capture cellularity and vascularity in newly diagnosed gliomas. METHODS Preoperative MRI and FET-PET data of 46 patients (31 glioblastoma and 15 lower-grade glioma) were segmented into contrast-enhancing and FLAIR-hyperintense areas. Using established cutoffs, we calculated hot-spot volumes (HSV) and their spatial overlap. We further investigated APTw and CBV values in FET-HSV. In a subset of 10 glioblastoma patients, we compared cellularity and vascularization in 34 stereotactically targeted biopsies with imaging. RESULTS In glioblastomas, the largest HSV was found for APTw, followed by PET and CBV (p < 0.05). In lower-grade gliomas, APTw-HSV was clearly lower than in glioblastomas. The spatial overlap of HSV was highest between APTw and FET in both tumor entities and regions. APTw correlated significantly with cellularity, similar to FET, while the association with vascularity was more pronounced in CBV and FET. CONCLUSIONS We found a relevant spatial overlap in glioblastomas between hotspots of APTw and FET both in contrast-enhancing and FLAIR-hyperintense tumor. As suggested by earlier studies, APTw was lower in lower-grade gliomas compared with glioblastomas. APTw meaningfully contributes to biological imaging of gliomas.","Schön, S; Cabello, J; Liesche-Starnecker, F; Molina-Romero, M; Eichinger, P; Metz, M; Karimov, I; Preibisch, C; Keupp, J; Hock, A; Meyer, B; Weber, W; Zimmer, C; Pyka, T; Yakushev, I; Gempt, J; Wiestler, B",European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging,189,28

We aimed at exploring the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection in IBD patients during the two waves. PATIENTS AND METHODS All IBD patients with a confirmed diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection were enrolled. They were sorted into two groups (those infected before September 2020, and those from September 2020 to January 2021) and compared by demographic and clinical data. RESULTS Twenty-five patients (out of about 600 with a follow-up visit) were infected with SARS-CoV-2 (4.1%). Sixteen were male and the mean age was 46.5 ± 14.3 years (range 24-74). Six were smokers and 11 had comorbidities; 2 were on steroids and 17 on immunosuppressants or biologics. Three patients (12%) needed hospitalization and other three patients were treated with azithromycin, steroids and LMWH, all of them during the second wave. No patient died or developed any sequelae. Two subjects were infected during the first wave (0.3 vs. 3.83, p<0.0001). Non-significant differences were found between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS A higher number of IBD patients were infected during the second wave. No patient developed a severe form of pneumonia, even those treated with immunosuppressants or biologics. No risk factor for hospitalization was found.","Carparelli, S; Pastore, M R; Valvano, M R; Marseglia, A; Latiano, A; Palmieri, O; Guerra, M; Martino, G; Perri, F; Bossa, F",European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,189,31

So far, this growth scheme has achieved a great success in the growth of III-nitride LEDs on c-plane substrates, but has not yet been applied in the growth of any other orientated III-nitride LEDs. In this paper, we have applied this growth scheme in the growth of semi-polar (11-22) green LEDs, and have investigated the impact of the SLS pre-layer on the optical performance of semi-polar (11-22) green LEDs grown on patterned (113) silicon substrates. Our results demonstrate that the semi-polar LEDs with the SLS pre-layer exhibit an improvement in both internal quantum efficiency and light output, which is similar to their c-plane counterparts. However, the performance improvement is not so significant as in the c-plane case. This is because the SLS pre-layer also introduces extra misfit dislocations for the semi-polar, but not the c-plane case, which act as non-radiative recombination centres.","Zhao, X; Huang, K; Bruckbauer, J; Shen, S; Zhu, C; Fletcher, P; Feng, P; Cai, Y; Bai, J; Trager-Cowan, C; Martin, R W; Wang, T",Scientific reports,189,16

Although post-LSG gastric stenosis (GS) is less frequent, it has not been well defined and lacks standardized management procedures. The objective of the present study was to describe a series of patients with GS symptoms after LSG and to develop a standardized management procedure for this complication. METHODS We performed a retrospective analysis of a prospective database of patients presenting with GS after LSG procedures performed between January 2008 and March 2014. The primary efficacy criterion was the frequency of post-LSG GS. GS was classified as functional (i.e. a gastric twist) or organic. The secondary efficacy criteria included the time interval between LSG and diagnosis of GS, the type of stenosis, the type of management, and the follow-up data. RESULTS During the study period, 1210 patients underwent primary or secondary LSG. Seventeen patients had post-operative symptoms of GS (1.4%); one patient had achalasia that had not been diagnosed preoperatively and thus was excluded from our analysis. The median time interval between LSG and diagnosis of GS was 47.2 days (1-114). Eleven patients had organic GS and six had functional GS. Seven patients required nutritional support. Endoscopic treatment was successful in 15 patients (88.2%) after balloon dilatation (n = 13) or insertion of a covered stent (n = 2). Two of the 15 patients required conversion to Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (11.8%). CONCLUSION GS after LSG is a rare complication but requires standardized management. Most cases can be treated successfully with endoscopic balloon dilatation.","Rebibo, Lionel; Hakim, Sami; Dhahri, Abdennaceur; Yzet, Thierry; Delcenserie, Richard; Regimbeau, Jean-Marc",Obesity surgery,189,19

We identify LARC promotion discourse as constituting 'The Age of LARC': multifarious strategies for producing responsible sexual citizens whose health behaviours are empowered via a LARC-only approach to contraceptive use. We suggest that immediate postpartum LARC insertion policies, which have proliferated in the U.S. since 2012, exemplify the new era of LARC hegemony, in which urgency, efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and outcomes dominate both health policy and clinical practice around these contraceptive technologies. By following these efforts to facilitate access to and use of immediate postpartum LARC, we find a discourse on sexual citizenship that paradoxically constructs sexual health freedom through the use of a single class of contraceptive technologies.","Brian, Jenny Dyck; Grzanka, Patrick R; Mann, Emily S",Health sociology review : the journal of the Health Section of the Australian Sociological Association,189,1

Constitutive activation of the janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT) signaling pathway in MF leads to cell proliferation, inhibition of cell death, and clonal expansion of myeloproliferative malignant cells. Fedratinib is a selective oral JAK2 inhibitor recently approved in the United States for treatment of adult patients with intermediate-2 or high-risk MF. In mouse models of JAK2V617F-driven myeloproliferative disease, fedratinib blocked phosphorylation of STAT5, increased survival, and improved MF-associated disease features, including reduction of white blood cell counts, hematocrit, splenomegaly, and fibrosis. Fedratinib exerts off-target inhibitory activity against bromodomain-containing protein 4 (BRD4); combination JAK/STAT and BRD4 inhibition was shown to synergistically block NF-kB hyperactivation and inflammatory cytokine production, attenuating disease burden and reversing bone marrow fibrosis in animal models of MPNs. In patients, fedratinib is rapidly absorbed and dosed once daily (effective half-life 41 h). Fedratinib showed robust clinical activity in JAK-inhibitor-naïve patients and in patients with MF who were relapsed, refractory, or intolerant to prior ruxolitinib therapy. Fedratinib is effective regardless of JAK2 mutation status. Onset of spleen and symptom responses are typically seen within the first 1-2 months of treatment. The most common adverse events (AEs) with fedratinib are grades 1-2 gastrointestinal events, which are most frequent during early treatment and decrease over time. Treatment discontinuation due to hematologic AEs in clinical trials was uncommon (~3%). Suspected cases of Wernicke's encephalopathy were reported during fedratinib trials in ~1% of patients; thiamine levels should be monitored before and during fedratinib treatment as medically indicated. Phase III trials are ongoing to assess fedratinib effects on long-term safety, efficacy, and overall survival. The recent approval of fedratinib provides a much-needed addition to the limited therapeutic options available for patients with MF.","Talpaz, Moshe; Kiladjian, Jean-Jacques",Leukemia,189,28

In recent years, it has become clear that hospitalization and critical illness bestow an increased VTE risk in pediatrics and relate to mortality and life-limiting comorbidities. For critically ill children, reported rates of VTE vary by study sampling techniques, presence of inherited or acquired thrombophilia, acute and chronic immobility, underlying illness prompting hospitalization, and clinical factors related to illness severity such as central venous catheterization, length of stay, mechanical ventilation, and patient age. Accordingly, critically ill children with new signs of venous congestion, acute inflammation, or unexplained acute organ dysfunction should be routinely evaluated for VTE. This narrative review summarizes recent and historical literature regarding risk factors, prevention, presentation, treatment, and outcomes of VTE in critically ill children. In addition, we identify knowledge gaps and priorities for future collaborative research on this vital condition. Special attention is given to the clinical trial opportunities, challenges, and ongoing efforts in thromboprophylaxis in critically ill children, including those hospitalized for disease related to novel coronavirus (COVID-19) and multisystem inflammatory disease in children.","Sochet, Anthony A; Kiskaddon, Amy; Betensky, Marisol; Goldenberg, Neil",Seminars in thrombosis and hemostasis,189,27

SAUD is notably characterized by an overactivation of the reflexive/reward system when confronted with alcohol-related cues. Such overreactivity generates a preferential allocation of attentional resources toward these cues, labeled as attentional biases (AB). Theoretical assumptions have been made regarding the characteristics of AB and their underlying processes. While often considered as granted, these assumptions remain to be experimentally validated. AIMS We first identify the theoretical assumptions made by previous studies exploring the nature and role of AB. We then discuss the current evidence available to establish their validity. We finally propose research avenues to experimentally test them. METHODS Capitalizing on a narrative review of studies exploring AB in SAUD, the current limits of the behavioral measures used for their evaluation are highlighted as well as the benefits derived from the use of eye-tracking measures to obtain a deeper understanding of their underlying processes. We describe the issues related to the theoretical proposals on AB and propose research avenues to test them. Four experimental axes are proposed, respectively, related to the determination of (a) the genuine nature of the mechanisms underlying AB; (b) their stability over the disease course; (c) their specificity to alcohol-related stimuli and (d) their reflexive or controlled nature. CONCLUSIONS This in-depth exploration of the available knowledge related to AB in SAUD, and of its key limitations, highlights the theoretical and clinical interest of our innovative experimental perspectives capitalizing on eye-tracking measures.","Bollen, Zoé; D'Hondt, Fabien; Dormal, Valérie; Lannoy, Séverine; Masson, Nicolas; Maurage, Pierre",Alcohol and alcoholism,189,1

This study evaluated a novel patient-centered method for constructing a longitudinal ultrasound score in RA patients. METHODS Fifty-four RA patients starting intravenous tocilizumab were evaluated with power Doppler ultrasound (PDUS) of 34 joints and DAS28-ESR was assessed at baseline and weeks 4, 12, 16, and 24. The sentinel joint score (SJS) was derived from the reduced subset of joints with PDUS ≥ 1 at baseline. Total PDUS (tPDUS) score and US7 were also calculated. Changes in tPDUS and SJS were correlated. Effect sizes were calculated for tPDUS, SJS, and US7. The proportion of ""flipped"" joints without baseline PDUS signal that later developed PDUS signal was estimated. RESULTS At baseline, 1236/1829 joints scanned (67.5%) did not have PDUS signal. The proportion of ""flipped"" joints at 24 weeks was 5.6% for ≥ 1, 2.9% for ≥ 2, and 1.0% for = 3 PD. tPDUS and SJS scores were highly correlated (r = 0.91 to 0.97). Overall the effect sizes for tPDUS, SJS, and US7 increased over 24 weeks, where SJS was the highest (SJS 1.00 4-week, 1.07 12-week, 1.26 24-week) and tPDUS and US7 were comparable (tPDUS 0.32 4-week, 0.52 12-week, 0.84 24-week; US7 0.23 4-week, 0.52 12-week, 0.74 24-week). CONCLUSION In RA patients starting a biologic, scanning only joints with baseline PDUS signal can substantially reduce the number of joints requiring follow-up scanning by 67.5% and improves feasibility. ""Flipped"" joints are infrequently seen after starting therapy. TRIAL REGISTRATION ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01717859 Key messages • Only a small percent of joints develop power Doppler signal after baseline scanning. • Changes in the SJS correlate well with changes in clinical activity measured by DAS28-ESR over time. • The SJS effect size is higher than total PDUS and US7 scores, and may improve examination feasibility.","Kuo, Daniel; Morris, Nicolette T; Kaeley, Gurjit S; Ben-Artzi, Ami; Brook, Jenny; Elashoff, David A; Ranganath, Veena K",Clinical rheumatology,189,1

CASE REPORT We describe in depth the clinical, analytical, and radiological details of 9 hemodialysis patients from a single center in Madrid (Spain) diagnosed with COVID-19. Furthermore, we describe and discuss the therapeutic aspects and the patients' outcomes. DISCUSSION We present one of the first case series of chronic hemodialysis patients with COVID-19. Between March 14 and April 8, 2020, out of 76 prevalent patients in our hemodialysis unit, 9 (11.8%) patients were diagnosed with COVID-19. The most common symptoms were fever (77.8%), asthenia (77.8%), cough (55.6%), and dyspnea (33.3%). A total of 3 patients developed severe pneumonia, whereas 4 patients developed mild pneumonia. In 2 patients, no pathologic changes were found on chest radiography. All patients presented lymphopenia. While 6 (66.7%) patients required hospitalization, none of them was admitted to intensive care unit. The most common treatments used were azithromycin (100%), hydroxychloroquine (66.7%), lopinavir/ritonavir (55.6%) and β-interferon (22.2%). In general, we observed a mild to moderate severity of disease in our case series.

Objective To estimate the number of SARS-CoV-2 infections, symptomatic infections, hospitalizations, and deaths in the US as of November 15, 2020. Design, Setting, and Participants In this cross-sectional study of respondents of all ages, data from 4 regional and 1 nationwide Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) seroprevalence surveys (April [n = 16 596], May, June, and July [n = 40 817], and August [n = 38 355]) were used to estimate infection underreporting multipliers and symptomatic underreporting multipliers. Community serosurvey data from randomly selected members of the general population were also used to validate the underreporting multipliers. Main Outcomes and Measures SARS-CoV-2 infections, symptomatic infections, hospitalizations, and deaths. The median of underreporting multipliers derived from the 5 CDC seroprevalence surveys in the 10 states that participated in 2 or more surveys were applied to surveillance data of reported coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases for 5 respective time periods to derive estimates of SARS-CoV-2 infections and symptomatic infections, which were summed to estimate SARS-CoV-2 infections and symptomatic infections in the US. Estimates of infections and symptomatic infections were combined with estimates of the hospitalization ratio and fatality ratio to derive estimates of SARS-CoV-2 hospitalizations and deaths. External validity of the surveys was evaluated with the April CDC survey by comparing results to 5 serosurveys (n = 22 118) that used random sampling of the general population. Internal validity of the multipliers from the 10 specific states was assessed in the August CDC survey by comparing multipliers from the 10 states to all states. A sensitivity analysis was conducted using the interquartile range of the multipliers to derive a high and low estimate of SARS-CoV-2 infections and symptomatic infections. The underreporting multipliers were then used to adjust the reported COVID-19 infections to estimate the full SARS-COV-2 disease burden. Results Adjusting reported COVID-19 infections using underreporting multipliers derived from CDC seroprevalence studies in April (n = 16 596), May (n = 14 291), June (n = 14 159), July (n = 12 367), and August (n = 38 355), there were estimated medians of 46 910 006 (interquartile range [IQR], 38 192 705-60 814 748) SARS-CoV-2 infections, 28 122 752 (IQR, 23 014 957-36 438 592) symptomatic infections, 956 174 (IQR, 782 509-1 238 912) hospitalizations, and 304 915 (IQR, 248 253-395 296) deaths in the US through November 15, 2020. An estimated 14.3% (IQR, 11.6%-18.5%) of the US population were infected by SARS-CoV-2 as of mid-November 2020. Conclusions and Relevance The SARS-CoV-2 disease burden may be much larger than reported COVID-19 cases owing to underreporting. Even after adjusting for underreporting, a substantial gap remains between the estimated proportion of the population infected and the proportion infected required to reach herd immunity. Additional seroprevalence surveys are needed to monitor the pandemic, including after the introduction of safe and efficacious vaccines.","Angulo, Frederick J; Finelli, Lyn; Swerdlow, David L",JAMA network open,189,1

This report shows that thiol groups are essential to the infectivity of hantaviruses. Alkylation of the thiol functional groups using the membrane-permeable compound N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) and membrane-impermeable compound 5,5'-dithio-bis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB) showed NEM to be a highly effective inactivator of Puumala and Tula hantaviruses. The NEM-inactivated hantavirus maintained the buoyant density of the wild-type virus. Furthermore, the antigenicity of glycoproteins and the cell attachment capacity of virions were retained at NEM concentrations that totally abolished virus infectivity. These results signified preservation of virion integrity following inactivation with NEM, making chemically inactivated virions valuable research antigens. It was demonstrated with biotin-conjugated maleimide, a mechanistic analogue of NEM, that all the structural proteins of hantavirus were sensitive towards thiol alkylation. In contrast to hantaviruses, NEM did not abolish Uukuniemi phlebovirus infectivity to the same extent. This indicates differences in the use of free thiols in virus entry among members of the family Bunyaviridae.","Strandin, Tomas; Hepojoki, Jussi; Wang, Hao; Vaheri, Antti; Lankinen, Hilkka",The Journal of general virology,189,5

METHODS Patients underwent an endovenous thermal ablation procedure and were randomized into two groups: non-distraction (AVD-) and with distraction (AVD+). Visual analogue scale pain score and hospital anxiety depression scale scores were used to measure outcome. The recruited patients were asked to submit an anticipated visual analogue scale pain score prior to treatment as well as the actual experienced post-operative visual analogue scale pain score. RESULTS There was no significant difference between the AVD- and AVD+ groups post-operative pain score 2.85 (SD 1.7) versus 2.60 (SD 2.3), p = 0.68. Pain score in women with distraction (AVD+) decreased from 3.81 to 2.42. The pain score in men with distraction (AVD+) increases from 1.88 to 2.82. In the AVD- group, a significant difference was found between men and women (p = 0.014). Disregarding gender, a significant difference was found between the anticipated pain score and the actual pain score in both the AVD- group (p = 0.009) and AVD+ group (p = 0.021). There was a correlation between depression and the pain score, which was not seen between pain and anxiety score. CONCLUSION The results suggested that audiovisual distraction has no influence on the visual analogue scale pain score during endovenous thermal ablation under tumescent anesthesia. Despite this, patients appreciate and evaluate audio and visual distraction as pleasant to extremely pleasant when applied.","van Zandvoort, Carina Eg; Toonder, Irwin M; Stoopendaal, Irma Aj; Wittens, Cees Ha",Phlebology,189,6

DESIGN Observational study of UK honours system including comparative analysis of proportional representation of the UK medical workforce. PARTICIPANTS Recipients of NYHs from 2010 to 2019. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Absolute risk of receiving an NYH, related to medical specialty, gender and geographical region. Relative risk (RR) of receiving an NYH for services to healthcare related to specialty. RESULTS 11 207 NYHs were bestowed, with 368 (3.3%) awarded to healthcare professionals: 212 (57.6%) women, 156 (42.4%) men. The RR of a healthcare professional receiving an NYH was 0.76 (95% CI 0.68 to 0.84, p<0.001) when compared with the remaining UK workforce. Doctors received most NYHs (n=181), with public health, clinical oncology and general medicine specialties most likely to be rewarded (RR 20.35 (95% CI 9.61 to 43.08, p<0.001), 8.43 (95% CI 2.70 to 26.30, p<0.001) and 8.22 (95% CI 6.22 to 10.86, p<0.001)), respectively; anaesthetists received fewest NYHs (RR 0.52 (95% CI 0.13 to 2.10), p=0.305). Men were more likely to receive NYHs than women (OR 0.44, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.54; p<0.001). Two hundred and fifty-four NYHs (69.0%) were bestowed on residents of England (60, 16.3% London), 49 (13.3%) Scotland (p=0.003), 39 (10.6%) Wales (p<0.001) and 26 (7.1%) Northern-Ireland (p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS Relative risk of receiving an NYH varied over 150-fold by specialty, twofold by gender and threefold by geographical location.

95684,95684,95684,Stability of Weakly Acidic Hypochlorous Acid Solution with Microbicidal Activity.,11.429741,5.150802,2017,"BACKGROUND Median nerve cross-sectional area (CSA) is the primary sonographic parameter for assessing and diagnosing median nerve pathology, such as carpal tunnel syndrome. However, variability in the sensitivity of diagnostic thresholds exists, which may be due to a lack of standardized normative reference values. Current estimates of normal median nerve CSA stem largely from small studies using a local pool of healthy controls. A systematic review and meta-analysis will be conducted to identify all available data for median nerve CSA in healthy, asymptomatic individuals to create a comprehensive set of normative reference values. METHODS Articles that include sonographic measures of median nerve CSA will be identified through a rigorous search of published evidence, a hand search through tables of contents of key journals, and the gray literature, including ClinicalTrials.gov and conference abstracts. Each abstract and full text will be reviewed by multiple raters to identify studies from 2000 to present that include original data. Any study that provides median nerve CSA values from healthy individuals will be included (e.g., reference value study, control participants in a diagnostic study). Studies will be assessed for quality using a modified version of the National Institute of Health Study Quality Assessment Tool for Observational Cohort and Cross-Sectional Studies, with primary focus on the use of a detailed and acceptable image acquisition and analysis protocol. Using data from included studies, reference values will be calculated for median nerve CSA by anatomical regions, including the distal forearm, wrist, and carpal tunnel at the level of the pisiform. Reference values will be stratified by gender, ethnicity, and age based upon the specificity of the data provided by the included articles. DISCUSSION A comprehensive set of normative reference values of median nerve CSA will reduce variability across studies, allowing future research to more accurately evaluate and establish diagnostic thresholds. Additionally, normative values can serve as a reference for evaluating treatment outcomes and provide a means to investigate and understand minor nuances in CSA changes that may be indicative of preclinical stages of median nerve pathology.

Not all treatments are successful, often leading to hospital readmissions. AIMS We sought to develop predictive models for exacerbation treatment outcome in a cohort of exacerbating asthma and COPD patients presenting to the emergency department. METHODS Treatment failure was defined as the need for additional systemic corticosteroids (SCS) and/or antibiotics, hospital readmissison or death within 30 days of initial emergency department visit. We performed univariate analysis comparing characteristics of patients either given or not given SCS at exacerbation and of patients who succeeded versus failed treatment. Patient demographics, medications and exacerbation symptoms, physiology and biology were available. We developed multivariate random forest models to identify predictors of SCS prescription and for predicting treatment failure. RESULTS Data were available for 81 patients, 43 (53%) of whom failed treatment. 64 (79%) of patients were given SCS. A random forest model using presence of wheeze at exacerbation and blood eosinophil percentage predicted SCS prescription with area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) 0.69. An 11 variable random forest model (which included medication, previous exacerbations, symptoms and quality of life scores) could predict treatment failure with AUC 0.81. A random forest model using just the two best predictors of treatment failure, namely, visual analogue scale for breathlessness and sputum purulence, predicted treatment failure with AUC 0.68. CONCLUSION Prediction of exacerbation treatment outcome can be achieved via supervised machine learning combining different predictors at exacerbation. Validation of our predictive models in separate, larger patient cohorts is required.","Halner, Andreas; Beer, Sally; Pullinger, Richard; Bafadhel, Mona; Russell, Richard E K",PloS one,189,16

Since 2012, more than 70 patients have undergone this combined procedure in the Netherlands. Even though all patients who undergo euthanasia are suffering hopelessly and unbearably, some of these patients are nevertheless willing to help others in need of an organ. Organ donation after euthanasia is a so-called donation after circulatory death (DCD), Maastricht category III procedure, which takes place following cardiac arrest, comparable to donation after withdrawal of life sustaining therapy in critically ill patients. To minimize the period of organ ischemia, the patient is transported to the operating room immediately after the legally mandated no-touch period of 5 min following circulatory arrest. This means that the organ donation procedure following euthanasia must take place in the hospital, which appears to be insurmountable to many patients who are willing to donate, since they already spent a lot of time in the hospital. CASE PRESENTATION This article describes the procedure of organ donation after euthanasia starting at home (ODAEH) following anesthesia in a former health care professional suffering from multiple system atrophy. This case is unique for at least two reasons. He spent his last conscious hours surrounded by his family at home, after which he underwent general anaesthesia and was intubated, before being transported to the hospital for euthanasia and organ donation. In addition, the patient explicitly requested the euthanasia to be performed in the preparation room, next to the operating room, in order to limit the period of organ ischemia due to transport time from the intensive care unit to the operating room. The medical, legal and ethical considerations related to this illustrative case are subsequently discussed. CONCLUSIONS Organ donation after euthanasia is a pure act of altruism. This combined procedure can also be performed after the patient has been anesthetized at home and during transportation to the hospital.","Tajaâte, Najat; van Dijk, Nathalie; Pragt, Elien; Shaw, David; Kempener-Deguelle, A; de Jongh, Wim; Bollen, Jan; van Mook, Walther",BMC medical ethics,189,1

Studies to date are largely surveys and lack meaningful involvement from service users in their design, planning, and delivery. The study aimed to examine the mental health status and coping strategies of young people during the first UK COVID-19 lockdown using coproduction methodology. METHODS The mental health status of young people (aged 16-24) in April 2020 was established utilizing a sequential explanatory coproduced mixed methods design. Factors associated with poor mental health status, including coping strategies, were also examined using an online survey and semi-structured interviews. RESULTS Since the lockdown, 30.3% had poor mental health, and 10.8% had self-harmed. Young people identifying as Black/Black-British ethnicity had the highest increased odds of experiencing poor mental health (odds ratio [OR] 3.688, 95% CI .54-25.40). Behavioral disengagement (OR 1.462, 95% CI 1.22-1.76), self-blame (OR 1.307 95% CI 1.10-1.55), and substance use (OR 1.211 95% CI 1.02-1.44) coping strategies, negative affect (OR 1.109, 95% CI 1.07-1.15), sleep problems (OR .915 95% CI .88-.95) and conscientiousness personality trait (OR .819 95% CI .69-.98) were significantly associated with poor mental health. Three qualitative themes were identified: (1) pre-existing/developed helpful coping strategies employed, (2) mental health difficulties worsened, and (3) mental health and nonmental health support needed during and after lockdown. CONCLUSION Poor mental health is associated with dysfunctional coping strategies. Innovative coping strategies can help other young people cope during and after lockdowns, with digital and school promotion and application.","Dewa, Lindsay H; Crandell, Caroline; Choong, Elizabeth; Jaques, Jack; Bottle, Alex; Kilkenny, Catherine; Lawrence-Jones, Anna; Di Simplicio, Martina; Nicholls, Dasha; Aylin, Paul",The Journal of adolescent health : official publication of the Society for Adolescent Medicine,189,17

We evaluated the impact of providing brief tablet-based information about antibiotic treatment of URTIs on patients' expectations for antibiotics and on family practitioners' antibiotic-prescribing behavior. METHODS We performed a 3-arm randomized controlled trial among patients presenting with URTIs at 2 urban family practices in Auckland, New Zealand, during winter 2018. Participants were randomly allocated to view a presentation about the futility of antibiotic treatment of URTIs, the adverse effects associated with antibiotics, or the benefits of healthy diet and exercise (active control), immediately before their consultation. Before and after viewing the presentations, participants used a Likert scale to rate the strength of their belief that antibiotics are effective for treating URTIs and of their desire to be prescribed an antibiotic. Patients reported whether an antibiotic had been prescribed, and pharmacy dispensing records were reviewed to determine whether an antibiotic was dispensed. RESULTS Participants who viewed either the futility or the adverse effects presentation had greater reductions in their expectations to receive antibiotics than the control group. The mean reduction (95% CI) was 1.1 (0.8-1.3) for the futility group, 0.7 (0.4-0.9) for the adverse effects group, and 0.1 (0-0.3) for the control group (Cohen d = 0.7; P <.001). There was no significant difference among the 3 groups with regard to antibiotic prescribing (P = .84) or dispensing (P = .43). CONCLUSIONS A brief tablet-based waiting room intervention significantly reduced participants' expectations about receiving antibiotics for URTI immediately before their family practitioner consultation. The intervention did not influence family practitioner prescribing behavior, however.","Perera, Anna Ishani; Thomas, Mark Greenslade; Petrie, Keith James; Frater, Janet; Dang, Daniel; Schache, Kiralee Ruth; Akroyd, Amelia Frances; Ritchie, Stephen Robert",Annals of family medicine,189,1

Increasingly, reports have emerged highlighting the diagnostic and treatment challenges of these lesions and their associated high morbidity and rapid clinical deterioration when untreated. We describe here a case series of 4 patients with deep cerebral DAVF who presented with impaired arousal or memory and behavioral changes. In all patients, the initial differential diagnosis included metabolic, inflammatory, infectious, or neoplastic disease, with an eventual correct diagnosis obtained after catheter angiography had demonstrated arterialization of the deep venous structures, including the vein of Galen. All patients were successfully treated with endovascular embolization, with 1 patient requiring additional surgical treatment. We review the contemporary diagnostic evaluation and management of DAVF within the deep cerebral vasculature.

The reasons for, and consequences of, the growing F3 trend are largely unknown. This scoping review presents the current evidence and identifies future research in this field. METHODS Following Arksey and O'Malley's guidelines, 12 databases and three UK-based national post-graduate organisation websites were searched for articles published in English (final searches January 2020). Multiple search terms were used to capture articles relating to the 'F3' time-period, including 'post-foundation' or 'pre-specialty' training. Title, abstract and full-paper screening selected articles reporting any aspect of F3, including within a wider context (e.g., postgraduate training breaks), and then underwent mixed methods analysis . RESULTS Of 4766 articles identified, 45 were included. All articles were published after 2009; 14/45 (31.1%) were published in 2019. 27 articles reported research, the remainder were opinion/commentaries. Specific personal (including demographic), professional and organisational factors, particularly the UK post-graduate training structure, are associated with undertaking an F3. The majority of F3 training breaks last 1 year and involve working (clinically or non-clinically) and/or travel. The decision to undertake an F3 is made either prior to, or during, foundation training. Evidence regarding the impact of F3 on healthcare service provision was limited but evenly balanced. CONCLUSIONS In summarising the existing F3 evidence, this review has highlighted important issues including healthcare workforce equality and diversity, training pathway inflexibility and the effect of negative early-career experiences on subsequent career decisions. More research is needed to understand the financial impact of training-breaks on healthcare service provision, how training programmes must adapt to retain more trainees, and the long-term effects of training breaks, such as F3, on subsequent career progression.","Church, Helen R; Agius, Stevie",Medical education,189,1

Chinese herbs were used in its treatment. OBJECTIVES To evaluate the possible effectiveness and safety of Chinese herbs combined with Western medicines versus Western medicines alone for SARS patients. SEARCH METHODS We searched CENTRAL 2012, Issue 3, MEDLINE (1966 to February Week 4, 2012), EMBASE (1990 to March 2012) and the Chinese Biomedical Literature (Issue 3, 2012). SELECTION CRITERIA Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs of Chinese herbs combined with Western medicines versus Western medicines alone for patients diagnosed with SARS. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Two review authors (XL, MZ) independently extracted trial data. We extracted dichotomous and continuous data with 95% confidence intervals (CI). For dichotomous data, we used risk ratio (RR). For continuous data, we calculated mean differences (MD). We calculated overall results based on the random-effects model if heterogeneity existed between studies. If no heterogeneity was detected between the studies, we used the fixed-effect model. We used the Z score and the Chi(2) test with significance being set at P < 0.05 to test heterogeneity. No severe adverse events were reported. MAIN RESULTS We included 12 RCTs and one quasi-RCT. A total of 640 SARS patients and 12 Chinese herbs were identified. We did not find Chinese herbs combined with Western medicines decreased mortality versus Western medicines alone. Two herbs may improve symptoms. Five herbs may improve lung infiltrate absorption. Four herbs may decrease the dosage of corticosteroids. Three herbs may improve the quality of life of SARS patients. One herb may shorten the length of hospital stay. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS Chinese herbs combined with Western medicines made no difference in decreasing mortality versus Western medicines alone. It is possible that Chinese herbs combined with Western medicines may improve symptoms, quality of life and absorption of pulmonary infiltration, and decrease the corticosteroid dosage for SARS patients. The evidence is weak because of the poor quality of the included trials. Long-term follow-up of these included trials is needed.","Liu, Xuemei; Zhang, Mingming; He, Lin; Li, Youping",The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,189,8

Each experience included the collective review of a case study and student-developed care plans before viewing and debriefing a series of videos. Students summarized their experience in a weekly written reflection. RESULTS Student feedback was examined through their reflections and verbal responses. The videos served as catalysts for robust discussion. Feedback was overwhelmingly positive related to an interactive experience, a heightened sense of teamwork, and enhanced comprehension by sharing differing perspectives of common experiences.

However, the single protein vaccine rALT-2 induced Th2 (IgG1/IgG3) with a 70% protective response and rVAH induced Th1 (IgG2a) with a lower proliferative response with 60% protection following challenge with B. malayi infective larvae. These results suggest that filarial cocktail protein vaccines are able to elicit substantial immune and protective responses when compared with single antigen vaccination in suitably vaccinated jirds.","Anand, S B; Kodumudi, K N; Reddy, M V; Kaliraj, P",Journal of helminthology,189,31

This is human nature. This is true also for chemists in the synthesis of organic molecules. All chemists would like to make their target molecules as soon as possible, particularly when their interest is in the physical or biological properties of those molecules.As demonstrated by today's COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic, rapid synthesis is also crucial to enable chemists to deliver effective therapeutic agents to the community. Several concepts are currently well-accepted as important for achieving this: atom economy, step economy, and redox economy. Considering the importance of synthesizing organic molecules rapidly, I recently proposed adding the concept of time economy.In a multisep synthesis, each step has to be completed within a short period of time to make the desired molecule rapidly. The development of rapid reactions is important but also insufficient. After each step, frequent and repetitive workup operations such as quenching the reaction, extraction, separation of water and organic phases, drying the organic phase, filtration, evaporation, and purification may be required, and the time necessary for these processing operations must be taken into account. Indeed, some of the most time-consuming operations in most syntheses are the purification stages.On the other hand, one-pot reactions are processes in which several sequential reactions are conducted in a single reaction vessel, which avoids the need to purify intermediates. One-pot reactions are a useful way to shorten the total synthesis time, and the approach generally leads to an increase in the yield and a reduction in the amount of chemical waste formed. Thus, I also propose the importance of pot economy.On the basis of these concepts of time and pot economy, we have accomplished efficient syntheses of several natural products and medicines. The key to the success of these syntheses is the use of diphenylprolinol silyl ether as an effective catalyst in a one-pot reaction, in which it does not disturb the subsequent reactions. Our strategy is (1) to construct the chiral key skeletons and/or key components of natural products and medicines directly using organocatalyst-mediated one-pot reactions and (2) to conduct the subsequent transformations to the final molecules in a small number of pots utilizing the internal quench method. By means of this strategy, PGE1 methyl ester, estradiol methyl ether, and clinprost were synthesized in three, five, and seven pots, respectively. Furthermore, (-)-oseltamivir, ABT-341, baclofen, and Corey lactone were synthesized in a single reaction vessel. Further optimization of the reactions in terms of time economy allowed (-)-oseltamivir and Corey lactone to be synthesized within 60 and 152 min, respectively. These syntheses will be highlighted as case studies. Although the organocatalyst is a key compound in this Account, pot- and time-economical syntheses can be expanded to organometallic chemistry and, indeed, to organic chemistry in general.","Hayashi, Yujiro",Accounts of chemical research,189,16

METHODS In this context, a 25-item anonymized e-survey was posted on the Twitter and Facebook e-groups and pages of various scleroderma organizations and patient communities to assess the problems faced by patients with SSc during the pandemic, with a focus on effects on the disease, drug procurance, continuity of medical care, and prevalent fears among patients. RESULTS Of the 291 participants (median age of 55 [43.5-63] years, 93.8% females), limited systemic sclerosis was the most common diagnosis (42.3%). Many patients experienced problems attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic (119, 40.9%), of which 46 (38.7%) required an increase in medicines, and 12 (10.1%) of these needed hospitalizations for disease-related complications. More than one-third (36.4%) were on glucocorticoids or had underlying cardiovascular risks (39%) that would predispose them to severe COVID-19.A significant proportion (38.1%) faced hurdles in procuring medicines or experienced disruption in physiotherapy sessions (24.7%). One-quarter (24.1%) felt it was difficult to contact their specialist, whereas another 7.2% were unable to do so. Contracting COVID-19 was the most prevalent fear (71.5%), followed by infection in the family (61.9%), and a flare of the disease (45.4%). Most respondents preferred teleconsultations (55.7%) over hospital visits in the pandemic period. CONCLUSION The results of the patient survey suggest that the COVID-19 pandemic has affected many patients with SSc and may translate to poorer outcomes in this population in the postpandemic period.","Gupta, Latika; Kharbanda, Rajat; Agarwal, Vishwesh; Misra, Durga Prasanna; Agarwal, Vikas",Journal of clinical rheumatology : practical reports on rheumatic & musculoskeletal diseases,189,11

The two main manifestations of clonal evolution are strong linkage disequilibrium (LD) and widespread genetic clustering (""near-clading""). We hypothesize that this pattern is not mainly due to natural selection, but originates chiefly from in-built genetic properties of pathogens, which could be ancestral and could function as alternative allelic systems to recombination genes (""clonality/sexuality machinery"") to escape recombinational load. The clonal framework of species of pathogens should be ascertained before any analysis of biomedical phenotypes (phylogenetic character mapping).

METHODS A cross-sectional online survey was conducted among 51 midwifery/clinical medicine educators from 35 diploma training colleges from all eight regions of Kenya. Educators' concerns and satisfaction regarding the delivery of training during the early phases of the pandemic were expressed as proportions on a three-point Likert scale. RESULTS Of the educators, 76% were extremely concerned about face-to-face teaching during the pandemic; 96% of educators had started delivering virtual teaching (VT), with only 41% being extremely confident in facilitating VT; and 97% were unsatisfied with the measures in place in their institutions to continue face-to-face teaching. CONCLUSION To minimise the impact of COVID-19 on midwifery education in Kenya, capacity building for VT and mitigation measures for safe in-person training are urgently needed.","Shikuku, Duncan N; Tallam, Edna; Wako, Ibrahim; Mualuko, Agnes; Waweru, Lucy; Nyaga, Lucy; Bashir, Isaak; Ameh, Charles",International health,189,23

NRPSs are macromolecular machines, with modular assembly-line logic, a complex catalytic cycle, moving parts and many active sites. In addition to the core domains required to link the substrates, they often include specialized tailoring domains, which introduce chemical modifications and allow the product to access a large expanse of chemical space. It is still unknown how the NRPS tailoring domains are structurally accommodated into megaenzymes or how they have adapted to function in nonribosomal peptide synthesis. Here we present a series of crystal structures of the initiation module of an antibiotic-producing NRPS, linear gramicidin synthetase. This module includes the specialized tailoring formylation domain, and states are captured that represent every major step of the assembly-line synthesis in the initiation module. The transitions between conformations are large in scale, with both the peptidyl carrier protein domain and the adenylation subdomain undergoing huge movements to transport substrate between distal active sites. The structures highlight the great versatility of NRPSs, as small domains repurpose and recycle their limited interfaces to interact with their various binding partners. Understanding tailoring domains is important if NRPSs are to be utilized in the production of novel therapeutics.","Reimer, Janice M; Aloise, Martin N; Harrison, Paul M; Schmeing, T Martin",Nature,189,16

There are conflicting accounts of the response of human epithelial cells to respiratory syncytial virus and a lack of data on its effect on ciliary function. Our aim was to study the early stages of respiratory syncytial virus infection of primary human basal and ciliated cultures. Using high speed videomicroscopy, we found that ciliary beat frequency was unaffected by respiratory syncytial virus infection over 72 h; however, ciliary dyskinesia significantly increased within 24 h of infection (p<0.05). Transmission electron microscopy revealed that ultrastructural abnormalities were confined to ciliated cells, including increased cilia loss and mitochondrial damage. Confocal immunofluorescence microscopy showed that respiratory syncytial virus antigen gradually spread from the cell surface to the ciliary tip of infected cells over 3 days. Interestingly, ciliated cultures secreted fewer viruses than basal (progenitor) cell cultures and produced a chemokine response focused on recruitment of neutrophils. This study highlights differences in infection models and underscores the need to explore further the role of ciliated cells in the establishment of respiratory syncytial virus infection. Increased ciliary dyskinesia combined with ciliary loss and epithelial damage is likely to result in reduced mucociliary clearance early in the infective process.","Smith, Claire M; Kulkarni, Hemant; Radhakrishnan, Priya; Rutman, Andrew; Bankart, Michael J; Williams, Gwyneth; Hirst, Robert A; Easton, Andrew J; Andrew, Peter W; O'Callaghan, Chris",The European respiratory journal,189,1

As in other coronaviruses, the spike (S) glycoprotein of MERS-CoV mediates receptor recognition and membrane fusion and is the primary target of the humoral immune response during infection. Here we use structure-based design to develop a generalizable strategy for retaining coronavirus S proteins in the antigenically optimal prefusion conformation and demonstrate that our engineered immunogen is able to elicit high neutralizing antibody titers against MERS-CoV. We also determined high-resolution structures of the trimeric MERS-CoV S ectodomain in complex with G4, a stem-directed neutralizing antibody. The structures reveal that G4 recognizes a glycosylated loop that is variable among coronaviruses and they define four conformational states of the trimer wherein each receptor-binding domain is either tightly packed at the membrane-distal apex or rotated into a receptor-accessible conformation.

The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of HHV-7 in the lower respiratory tract of hospitalized adult patients. METHODS The prevalence of HHV-7 DNA was determined by quantitative real-time PCR in 212 bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples obtained from 153 patients. The molecular epidemiology and clinical role of HHV-7 were evaluated. RESULTS HHV-7 DNA was positive in 44 of 212 specimens (20.7%), obtained from 40 of 153 patients (26.1%), in particular 22/68 (32.35%) and 18/86 (20.9%) in transplant and non-transplant patients, respectively (1 patient evaluated both before and after transplantation).

A thorough understanding of the current evidence regarding the effectiveness and safety of vitamin D supplementation for COVID-19 based on randomised controlled trials is required. OBJECTIVES To assess whether vitamin D supplementation is effective and safe for the treatment of COVID-19 in comparison to an active comparator, placebo, or standard of care alone, and to maintain the currency of the evidence, using a living systematic review approach. SEARCH METHODS We searched the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register, Web of Science and the WHO COVID-19 Global literature on coronavirus disease to identify completed and ongoing studies without language restrictions to 11 March 2021. SELECTION CRITERIA We followed standard Cochrane methodology. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating vitamin D supplementation for people with COVID-19, irrespective of disease severity, age, gender or ethnicity. We excluded studies investigating preventive effects, or studies including populations with other coronavirus diseases (severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) or Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)). DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS We followed standard Cochrane methodology. To assess bias in included studies, we used the Cochrane risk of bias tool (ROB 2) for RCTs. We rated the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach for the following prioritised outcome categories: individuals with moderate or severe COVID-19: all-cause mortality, clinical status, quality of life, adverse events, serious adverse events, and for individuals with asymptomatic or mild disease: all-cause mortality, development of severe clinical COVID-19 symptoms, quality of life, adverse events, serious adverse events. MAIN RESULTS We identified three RCTs with 356 participants, of whom 183 received vitamin D. In accordance with the World Health Organization (WHO) clinical progression scale, two studies investigated participants with moderate or severe disease, and one study individuals with mild or asymptomatic disease. The control groups consisted of placebo treatment or standard of care alone. Effectiveness of vitamin D supplementation for people with COVID-19 and moderate to severe disease We included two studies with 313 participants. Due to substantial clinical and methodological diversity of both studies, we were not able to pool data. Vitamin D status was unknown in one study, whereas the other study reported data for vitamin D deficient participants. One study administered multiple doses of oral calcifediol at days 1, 3 and 7, whereas the other study gave a single high dose of oral cholecalciferol at baseline. We assessed one study with low risk of bias for effectiveness outcomes, and the other with some concerns about randomisation and selective reporting. All-cause mortality at hospital discharge (313 participants) We found two studies reporting data for this outcome. One study reported no deaths when treated with vitamin D out of 50 participants, compared to two deaths out of 26 participants in the control group (Risk ratio (RR) 0.11, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.01 to 2.13). The other study reported nine deaths out of 119 individuals in the vitamin D group, whereas six participants out of 118 died in the placebo group (RR 1.49, 95% CI 0.55 to 4.04]. We are very uncertain whether vitamin D has an effect on all-cause mortality at hospital discharge (very low-certainty evidence). Clinical status assessed by the need for invasive mechanical ventilation (237 participants) We found one study reporting data for this outcome. Nine out of 119 participants needed invasive mechanical ventilation when treated with vitamin D, compared to 17 out of 118 participants in the placebo group (RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.24 to 1.13). Vitamin D supplementation may decrease need for invasive mechanical ventilation, but the evidence is uncertain (low-certainty evidence). Quality of life We did not find data for quality of life. Safety of vitamin D supplementation for people with COVID-19 and moderate to severe disease We did not include data from one study, because assessment of serious adverse events was not described and we are concerned that data might have been inconsistently measured. This study reported vomiting in one out of 119 participants immediately after vitamin D intake (RR 2.98, 95% CI 0.12 to 72.30). We are very uncertain whether vitamin D supplementation is associated with higher risk for adverse events (very low-certainty). Effectiveness and safety of vitamin D supplementation for people with COVID-19 and asymptomatic or mild disease We found one study including 40 individuals, which did not report our prioritised outcomes, but instead data for viral clearance, inflammatory markers, and vitamin D serum levels. The authors reported no events of hypercalcaemia, but recording and assessment of further adverse events remains unclear. Authors administered oral cholecalciferol in daily doses for at least 14 days, and continued with weekly doses if vitamin D blood levels were > 50 ng/mL. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS There is currently insufficient evidence to determine the benefits and harms of vitamin D supplementation as a treatment of COVID-19. The evidence for the effectiveness of vitamin D supplementation for the treatment of COVID-19 is very uncertain. Moreover, we found only limited safety information, and were concerned about consistency in measurement and recording of these outcomes. There was substantial clinical and methodological heterogeneity of included studies, mainly because of different supplementation strategies, formulations, vitamin D status of participants, and reported outcomes. There is an urgent need for well-designed and adequately powered randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with an appropriate randomisation procedure, comparability of study arms and preferably double-blinding. We identified 21 ongoing and three completed studies without published results, which indicates that these needs will be addressed and that our findings are subject to change in the future.

Some studies have demonstrated a significant number of false-negative RT-PCR tests while displaying significant tomographic findings, in the early days of symptoms of COVID-19. OBJECTIVE To compare accuracy between RT-PCR and computed tomography (CT) for detecting COVID-19 in the first week of its symptoms during the pandemic. DESIGN AND SETTING Systematic review of comparative studies of diagnostic accuracy within the Evidence-based Health Program of a federal university in São Paulo (SP), Brazil. METHODS A systematic search of the relevant literature was conducted in the PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, CINAHL and LILACS databases, for articles published up to June 6, 2020, relating to studies evaluating the diagnostic accuracy of RT-PCR and chest CT for COVID-19 diagnoses. The QUADAS 2 tool was used for methodological quality evaluation. RESULTS In total, 1204 patients with COVID-19 were evaluated; 1045 had tomographic findings while 755 showed positive RT-PCR for COVID-19. RT-PCR demonstrated 81.4% sensitivity, 100% specificity and 92.3% accuracy. Chest CT demonstrated 95.3% sensitivity, 43.8% specificity and 63.3% accuracy. CONCLUSION The high sensitivity and detection rates shown by CT demonstrate that this technique has a high degree of importance in the early stages of the disease. During an outbreak, the higher prevalence of the condition increases the positive predictive value of CT.

Nurse-led interventions were conducted in diverse settings, were multifaceted, often involved parents and used education, counselling and motivational interviewing to target behaviour change in children and adolescents' diet and physical activity. Most studies did not determine that nurse-led interventions were more effective than their comparator(s) in preventing childhood and adolescent overweight and obesity. CONCLUSIONS Nurse-led interventions to prevent juvenile obesity are feasible but have not yet determined effectiveness. With adequate training, nurses could make better use of existing clinical and situational opportunities to assist in the effort to prevent childhood obesity.","Whitehead, Lisa; Kabdebo, Istvan; Dunham, Melissa; Quinn, Robyn; Hummelshoj, Jennifer; George, Cobie; Denney-Wilson, Elizabeth",Journal of advanced nursing,189,1

Here, we reported that expression level of mitochondrial ribosomal protein S35 (Mrps35) continued to decrease over infection time after Listeria infected macrophages. Our results indicated that knockdown Mrps35 increased the load of Listeria in macrophages. This result supported that Mrps35 played the crucial roles in Listeria infection. Moreover, we performed the comprehensive proteomics to analyze the differentially expressed protein of wild type and Mrps35 Knockdown Raw264.7 cells by Listeria infection over 6h. Based on the results of mass spectrometry, we presented a wide variety of hypotheses about the mechanism of Mrps35 controlling the Listeria intracellular proliferation. Among them, experiments confirmed that Mrps35 and 60S ribosomal protein L22-like 1 (Rpl22l1) were a functional correlation or potentially a compensatory mechanism during Listeria infection. This study provided new insights into understanding that Listeria infection changed the basic synthesis or metabolism-related proteins of host cells. This article is protected by copyright.

Midbrain dopamine neurons are known to reinforce economic choices through their signal evoked by outcomes after decisions are made. However, although critical internal processing is executed while decisions are being made, little is known about the role of dopamine neurons during this period. We found that dopamine neurons exhibited dynamically changing signals related to the internal processing while rhesus monkeys were making decisions. These neurons encoded the value of an option immediately after it was offered and then gradually changed their activity to represent the animal's upcoming choice. Similar dynamics were observed in the orbitofrontal cortex, a center for economic decision-making, but the value-to-choice signal transition was completed earlier in dopamine neurons. Our findings suggest that dopamine neurons are a key component of the neural network that makes choices from values during ongoing decision-making processes.","Yun, Mengxi; Kawai, Takashi; Nejime, Masafumi; Yamada, Hiroshi; Matsumoto, Masayuki",Science advances,189,17

We aimed to elucidate the mechanism by which -3 and/or -408 C/T SNPs had such profound effects. METHODS A functional SNP in IFNAR1 promoter was defined by reporter gene assay, mutational analysis, flow cytometry analysis and gel shift assay. The nuclear protein binding to the essential polymorphic site was identified and its effect on transcriptional regulation of IFNAR1 was further demonstrated in a series of ex vivo and in vivo experiments. RESULTS We found C>T change at the -3 locus reduced the transcriptional activity of IFNAR1 promoter. High mobility group B protein 1 (HMGB1) and PARP-1 were co-recruited to the IFNAR1 promoter to regulate its transcription. We demonstrated HMGB1-binding affinity to IFNAR1 promoter was reduced in the -3T variant. Additionally, PARP-1, a cofactor for IFNAR1 transcription activation, was significantly suppressed by HBV. CONCLUSION Upon HBV infection, decreased binding affinity of HMGB1 to the IFNAR1 promoter -3T variant is aggravated by the suppressed PARP-1 expression caused by HBV, resulting in a further attenuated IFNAR1 expression. This compromises the antiviral and immuno-regulatory effects of IFN-alpha/beta, which may in turn affect the clinical outcome of HBV infection.","Zhou, Jie; Huang, Jian-Dong; Poon, Vincent K M; Chen, Ding-Qiang; Chan, Chris C S; Ng, Fai; Guan, Xin-Yuan; Watt, Rory M; Lu, Liwei; Yuen, Kwok-Yung; Zheng, Bo-Jian",Journal of hepatology,189,1

Outcomes of TAVR plus LM PCI have not been previously reported. OBJECTIVES The primary objective of the TAVR-LM registry is to evaluate clinical outcomes in patients undergoing TAVR plus LM PCI. METHODS Clinical, echocardiographic, computed tomographic, and angiographic characteristics were retrospectively collected in 204 patients undergoing TAVR plus LM PCI. In total, 128 matched patient pairs were generated by performing 1:1 case-control matching between 167 patients with pre-existing LM stents undergoing TAVR and 1,188 control patients undergoing TAVR without LM revascularization. RESULTS One-year mortality (9.4% vs. 10.2%, p = 0.83) was similar between the TAVR plus LM PCI cohort and matched controls. One-year mortality after TAVR plus LM PCI was not different in patients with unprotected compared with protected LMs (7.8% vs. 8.1%, p = 0.88), those undergoing LM PCI within 3 months compared with those with LM PCI greater than 3 months before TAVR (7.4% vs. 8.6%, p = 0.61), and those with ostial versus nonostial LM stents (10.3% vs. 15.6%, p = 0.20). Unplanned LM PCI performed because of TAVR-related coronary complication, compared with planned LM PCI performed for pre-existing LM disease, resulted in increased 30-day (15.8% vs. 3.4%, p = 0.013) and 1-year (21.1% vs. 8.0%, p = 0.071) mortality. CONCLUSIONS Despite the anatomic proximity of the aortic annulus to the LM, TAVR plus LM PCI is safe and technically feasible, with short- and intermediate-term clinical outcomes comparable with those in patients undergoing TAVR alone. These results suggest that TAVR plus LM PCI is a reasonable option for patients who are at high risk for surgery.","Chakravarty, Tarun; Sharma, Rahul; Abramowitz, Yigal; Kapadia, Samir; Latib, Azeem; Jilaihawi, Hasan; Poddar, Kanhaiya Lal; Giustino, Gennaro; Ribeiro, Henrique B; Tchetche, Didier; Monteil, Benoit; Testa, Luca; Tarantini, Giuseppe; Facchin, Michela; Lefèvre, Thierry; Lindman, Brian R; Hariri, Babak; Patel, Jigar; Takahashi, Nobuyuki; Matar, George; Mirocha, James; Cheng, Wen; Tuzcu, Murat E; Sievert, Horst; Rodés-Cabau, Josep; Colombo, Antonio; Finkelstein, Ariel; Fajadet, Jean; Makkar, Raj R",Journal of the American College of Cardiology,189,16

In the long-term follow-up, weight loss failure and intractable severe reflux can necessitate further surgical intervention. METHODS A retrospective analysis of laparoscopic conversions from SG to Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) was performed to assess the efficacy for reflux relief and weight loss success. RESULTS A total of eight out of 73 patients (11%) underwent conversion to RYGB for severe reflux (n=3) or weight regain (n=5) after a median interval of 33 months following laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy. In one of the patients, a banded gastric bypass was performed. In both groups, conversion to RYGB was successful, as proton pump inhibitor medication could be discontinued in all patients presenting with severe reflux, and a significant weight loss could be achieved in the patients with weight regain within a median follow-up of 33 months. Postoperative complications were observed in only one patient as leakage at the gastrojejunostomy was successfully treated by temporary stent placement. CONCLUSION Conversion to RYGB is an effective treatment for weight regain or intractable reflux symptoms following SG. Thus, SG can be performed, intended as sole and definitive bariatric intervention, with conversion from SG to RYGB as an exit strategy for these complications.","Langer, Felix B; Bohdjalian, Arthur; Shakeri-Leidenmühler, Soheila; Schoppmann, Sebastian F; Zacherl, Johannes; Prager, Gerhard",Obesity surgery,189,16

Of these nucleotide substitutions 58, 94 and 37 were nonsynonymous types mostly present in the Nsp2, Nsp3, Spike and ORF9. A continent-specific phylogram analyses clustered the SARS-CoV-2 in the different group based on the frequency of nucleotide substitutions. Detailed analyses about the continent-specific amino acid changes and their effectiveness by SNAP2 software was investigated. We found 11 common nonsynonymous mutations, out of them two novel effective mutations were identified in ORF9 (S194L and S202N). Intriguingly, ORF9 encodes nucleocapsid phosphoprotein possessing many effective mutations across continents and could be a potential candidate after the spike protein for studying the role of mutation in viral assembly and pathogenesis. Among the two form of certain frequent mutation one form is more prevalent in Europe continents (Nsp12:L314, Nsp13:P504, Nsp13:Y541, Spike:G614 and ORF8:L84) while other forms is more prevalent in American (Nsp12:P314, Nsp13:L504, Nsp13:C541, Spike:D614 and ORF8:L84) and Asian continents (Spike:D614) indicating the spatial and temporal dynamics of SARS-CoV-2. We identified highly conserved 38 regions and among these regions, 11 siRNAs were predicted on stringent criteria that can be used to suppress expression of viral genes and corresponding reduction of human viral infections. Present investigation provides information of different mutations and will pave the way for differentiating strains based on virulence and their use in development of a better antiviral therapy.

Patient-reported outcome measures after EVT, such as health-related quality of life and specific functional domains, are less well described. METHODS We report outcomes on the EuroQol-5D (EQ-5D) from the ESCAPE (Endovascular Treatment for Small Core and Anterior Circulation Proximal Occlusion With Emphasis on Minimizing CT to Recanalization Times) randomized controlled trial at 90 days after stroke. Death was assigned an index value of 0 for EQ-5D. We used quantile regression to evaluate the association between EVT and EQ-5D index scores and logistic regression for the association between EVT and symptom-free status among 90-day survivors for each EQ-5D dimension (self-care, usual activities, mobility, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression), assessing for modification by age or sex and adjusting for baseline factors including stroke severity, affected hemisphere, and receipt of alteplase. Lastly, the association between severe disability at 90 days and EQ-5D was evaluated with assessment for modification by EVT, age, and sex. RESULTS There were 165 patients randomized to EVT and 150 patients randomized to control. Median EQ-5D was significantly higher for those who received EVT compared with best medical management (0.80 versus 0.60; P<0.001). After accounting for the greater number of deaths in the elderly, there was evidence of modification of treatment effect by age, with older age associated with a larger effect size difference in EQ-5D with EVT. Those receiving EVT had higher odds of symptom-free status in self-care, usual activities, mobility for those aged 60 to 79 years, and pain/discomfort for women, but there was no association with anxiety/depression. Severe disability at 90 days was associated with lower EQ-5D in older compared with younger individuals, and the association was not modified by EVT. CONCLUSIONS Patients treated with EVT report substantially improved health-related quality of life, with relatively greater impact in older individuals and observed benefit across multiple dimensions.","Joundi, Raed A; Rebchuk, Alexander D; Field, Thalia S; Smith, Eric E; Goyal, Mayank; Demchuk, Andrew M; Dowlatshahi, Dar; Poppe, Alexandre Y; Williams, David J; Mandzia, Jennifer L; Buck, Brian H; Jadhav, Ashutosh P; Pikula, Aleksandra; Menon, Bijoy K; Hill, Michael D",Stroke,189,1

AIM We evaluated the frequency and intensity of favipiravir-associated fluorescence. PATIENTS/METHODS The participants comprised patients who had taken at least a single dose of favipiravir and been examined no later than 30 days after the last dose. The gender, age, body mass index (BMI), Fitzpatrick's skin-type, hair color, N-acetylcysteine use, presence and the intensity of fluorescent reflection under Wood's light in the lunulae of the fingernails, hair and the face were recorded. RESULTS There were 275 patients, 144 (52.4%) of whom were women. 165 (57.9%) had used treatment for a maximum of 5 days, 99 (34.7%) for 6-10 days, and 21 (7.4%) for more than ten days. Using more than 22 tablets of favipiravir increased the probability of detecting fluorescence in the lunulae by 6.72 (2.61-17.23) times. Using more than 28 tablets increased the risk of fluorescence in hair and the T-zone by 5.92 (2.43-14.71) and 2.88 (1.11-7.47) times, respectively. No relationship was found between the fluorescence intensity in any localization and the total dose. However, we determined a negative correlation between the elapsed time after the last dose and the fluorescence intensity in the lunulae and the T-zone (p=0.036; p=0.031; respectively). It was noted that BMI negatively correlated with the fluorescence intensity in the lunulae (p=0.001). Skin type was related to intensity for all localizations (p<0.001). Fluorescence was found in the lunulae with significantly less frequency in patients using N-acetylcysteine (p=0.040).

STUDY DESIGN In vitro randomized, matched design. SAMPLE POPULATION Equine ventral median abdominal skin specimens (n = 24 horses). METHODS Subcuticular absorbable staples (SAS), metallic staples (MS), polyglyconate suture (PG), and nylon monofilament (NYL) were applied to longitudinally transected portions of equine ventral midline skin. Loads that resulted in an initial failure point and the ultimate failure load and mechanism were recorded. RESULTS Mean ± SD loads at initial failure for PG (86 N ± 64 N), NYL (81 N ± 142 N), and SAS (70 N ± 20 N) were not significantly different from each other. PG and SAS were significantly higher than MS (43 N ± 17 N; P < .05). Ultimate failure load for PG (563 N ± 157 N) and NYL (558 N ± 162 N) were significantly higher than either MS (175 N ± 44 N) or SAS (96 N ± 20N; P < .001). For the suture groups, nearly all failures occurred because of skin pull through whereas all SAS staples failed because of staple fracture. Failure patterns were mixed for MS.

The molecular mechanism leading to melanoma metastasis is currently unclear. METHODS With the goal of revealing the underlying mechanism, three data sets with accession numbers GSE8401, GSE46517 and GSE7956 were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. After identifying the differentially expressed gene (DEG) of primary melanoma and metastatic melanoma, three kinds of analyses were performed, namely functional annotation, protein-protein interaction (PPI) network and module construction, and co-expression and drug-gene interaction prediction analysis. RESULTS A total of 41 up-regulated genes and 79 down-regulated genes was selected for subsequent analyses. Results of pathway enrichment analysis showed that extracellular matrix organization and proteoglycans in cancer are closely related to melanoma metastasis. In addition, seven pivotal genes were identified from PPI network, including CXCL8, THBS1, COL3A1, TIMP3, KIT, DCN, and IGFBP5, which have all been verified in the TCGA database and clinical specimens, but only CXCL8, THBS1 and KIT had significant differences in expression.

Despite encouraging outcomes, some matters are yet to be addressed. In particular closed stent designs are influenced by the delivery technique and may suffer from under-expansion, with the typical effect of ""hugging"" the inner curvature of the vessel which seems related to adverse events. In this study we propose a novel finite element (FE) environment to study potential failure able to reproduce the microcatheter ""pull-back"" delivery technique. We first verified our procedure with published in vitro data and then replicated the intervention on one patient treated with a 4.5 × 22 mm Enterprise microstent (Codman Neurovascular; Raynham MA, USA). Results showed good agreement with the in vitro test, catching both size and location of the malapposed area. A simulation of a 28 mm stent in the same geometry highlighted the impact of the delivery technique, which leads to larger area of malapposition. The patient specific simulation matched the global stent configuration and zones prone to malapposition shown on the clinical images with difference in tortuosity between actual and virtual treatment around 2.3%. We conclude that the presented FE strategy provides an accurate description of the stent mechanics and, after further in vivo validation and optimization, will be a tool to aid clinicians to anticipate the acute procedural outcome avoiding poor initial results.","Iannaccone, Francesco; De Beule, Matthieu; De Bock, Sander; Van der Bom, Imramsjah M J; Gounis, Matthew J; Wakhloo, Ajay K; Boone, Matthieu; Verhegghe, Benedict; Segers, Patrick",Annals of biomedical engineering,189,12

Greek table olives, one of the most emblematic and valuable Greek national products, are often subjected to economically motivated fraud. In this work, a novel ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole time of flight tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-QTOF-MS) analytical method was developed to detect the mislabeling of Greek PDO Kalamata table olives, and thereby establish their authenticity. A non-targeted screening workflow was applied, coupled to advanced chemometric techniques such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Partial Least Square Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA) in order to fingerprint and accurately discriminate PDO Greek Kalamata olives from Kalamata (or Kalamon) type olives from Egypt and Chile. The method performance was evaluated using a target set of phenolic compounds and several validation parameters were calculated. Overall, 65 table olive samples from Greece, Egypt, and Chile were analyzed and processed for the model development and its accuracy was validated. The robustness of the chemometric model was tested using 11 Greek Kalamon olive samples that were produced during the following crop year, 2018, and they were successfully classified as Greek Kalamon olives from Kalamata. Twenty-six characteristic authenticity markers were indicated to be responsible for the discrimination of Kalamon olives of different geographical origins.","Kalogiouri, Natasa P; Aalizadeh, Reza; Dasenaki, Marilena E; Thomaidis, Nikolaos S",Molecules,189,7
109310,109310,109310,Biomarkers and prognostic factors for mesothelioma.,11.285596,4.83542,2012,"Importance Zika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-borne flavivirus recognized as teratogenic since the 2015 to 2016 epidemic. Antenatal ZIKV exposure causes brain anomalies, yet the full spectrum has not been delineated. Objective To characterize the clinical features of ZIKV infection at a pediatric referral center in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, among children with antenatal ZIKV exposure. Design, Setting, and Participants Retrospective cohort study conducted from May to July 2019 of a prospective cohort of 296 infants with antenatal ZIKV exposure followed up since December 2015 at a tertiary maternity-pediatric hospital. Exposures Zika virus infection during pregnancy. Main Outcomes and Measures Characterization of clinical features with anthropometric, neurologic, cardiologic, ophthalmologic, audiometric, and neuroimaging evaluations in infancy and neurodevelopmental assessments (Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development, Third Edition) from 6 to 42 months of age, stratified by head circumference at birth (head circumference within the reference range, or normocephaly [NC] vs microcephaly [MC]). Results Antenatal exposure to ZIKV was confirmed for 219 of 296 children (74.0%) referred to Instituto Fernandes Figueira with suspected ZIKV infection through positive maternal or neonatal polymerase chain reaction analysis or IgM serology results. Of these children, 110 (50.2%) were boys, ages ranged from 0 to 4 years, and 53 (24.2%) had congenital microcephaly. The anomalies observed in ZIKV-exposed children with MC or NC were failure to thrive (MC: 38 of 53 [71.7%]; NC: 73 of 143 [51.0%]), cardiac malformations (MC: 19 of 46 [41.3%]; NC: 20 of 100 [20.0%]), excess nuchal skin (MC: 16 of 22 [72.7%]; NC: 35 of 93 [37.6%]), auditory abnormalities (MC: 13 of 50 [26.0%]; NC: 14 of 141 [9.9%]), and eye abnormalities (MC: 42 of 53 [79.2%]; NC: 28 of 158 [17.7%]). Although they experienced fewer neurologic abnormalities than children born with MC, those with NC also had frequent neurologic abnormalities (109 of 160 [68.1%]), including hyperreflexia (36 of 136 [26.5%]), abnormal tone (53 of 137 [38.7%]), congenital neuromotor signs (39 of 93 [41.9%]), feeding difficulties (15 of 143 [10.5%]), and abnormal brain imaging results (44 of 150 [29.3%]). Among 112 children with NC with Bayley-III evaluations, 72 (64.3%) had average or above-average scores; 30 (26.8%) scored 1 SD below average in at least 1 domain; and 10 (8.9%) scored 2 SD below average in at least 1 domain. Among 112 children with NC, a smaller head circumference at birth was significantly associated with subsequent below-average cognitive scores (U = 499.5; z = -2.833; P = .004) and language scores (U = 235.5; z = -2.491; P = .01). Conclusions and Relevance Children without MC who were exposed to ZIKV in utero had a high frequency of anatomical and neurodevelopmental abnormalities. The head circumference at birth for children with NC was associated with neurocognitive development. Recognition of the wide spectrum of clinical phenotypes is critical to ensure early referral to rehabilitative interventions.","Cranston, Jessica S; Tiene, Sophia Finn; Nielsen-Saines, Karin; Vasconcelos, Zilton; Pone, Marcos V; Pone, Sheila; Zin, Andrea; Salles, Tania Saad; Pereira, Jose Paulo; Orofino, Dulce; Brasil, Patricia; Kerin, Tara; Adachi, Kristina; Soares, Fernanda Mendes; Dunshee de Abranches, Andrea; da Costa, Ana Carolina C; Lopes Moreira, Maria Elisabeth",JAMA network open,189,1

As graft availability may be restricted by disease or co-morbidities, tissue engineering approaches are actively sought. The pericranium could provide new bone graft material. During development and repair, bone transitions through a chondrogenic phase. However, with tissue engineering pluripotent cells can differentiation directly into bone cells. Does ability to recapitulate bone formation in vitro affect osteogenesis and vascularization of pericranium grafts? To answer this, we obtained tissue from nine patients with pre-planned craniotomy surgery and studied 3D osteogenesis and angiogenesis of pericranium-derived spheroids. First, we established growth and differentiation conditions on Matrigel. For each spheroid sample we investigated a) continuous osteogenic differentiation (COD), and b) osteogenic differentiation preceded by chondrogenesis (CDOD). The effect of VEGF was compared to VEGF supplemented with FGF, IL-1, IL-6, PDGF, and TNF-α, a growth factor mix (GFM) with possible synergistic effects. In this limited sample we observed no age or sex-related differences in cell expansion. Similarly, no statistically significant differences in osteogenic or angiogenic scores between COD or CDOD spheroids were noted with regular media. In COD however, VEGF statistically significantly increased angiogenesis compared to control media (p=0.007)). Also in COD, both VEGF and VEGF+GFM increased osteogenesis (p=0.047 and p=0.038, respectively). By contrast, in CDOD neither VEGF nor VEGF+GFM yielded statistically significant angiogenesis or osteogenesis scores compared to control media. To understand these results we characterized spheroid protein expression by nano-liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (nLC-MS/MS). Nine angiogenic proteins were either uniquely expressed or upregulated in COD compared to CDOD: a) endothelial markers JUP, PTGIS, PTGS2, and TYMP, b) tissue remodeling factors CHI3L1 and MMP14, and c) metabolic pathways modulators ANGPTL4, ITGA5, and WNT5A. ANGPTL4, ITGA5, PTGIS, PTGS2, WNT5A define a conserved angiogenic network and were >2 fold increased in VEGF compared to VEGF+GFM. Finally, we examined bone formation on printable poly-(propylene-fumarate) (PPF) scaffolds for individualized grafting. Under COD+VEGF conditions, PPF scaffolds loaded with PDCs displayed hallmarks of spongiform-like bone formation. Thus, the human pericranium may be a potential repository for bone-generating cells with applications in craniofacial bone repair using tissue printing.","San-Marina, Serban; Prummer, Christopher; Voss, Stephen; Hunter, Danielle; Madden, Benjamin; Charlesworth, Mary Cristine; Ekbom, Dale; Janus, Jeffrey R",Tissue engineering.

Electroencephalograms (EEGs) are one of the techniques which provides an electrical representation of biosignals that reflect changes in the activity of the human brain. Monitoring the levels of anesthesia is a very important subject, which has been proposed to avoid both patient awareness caused by inadequate dosage of anesthetic drugs and excessive use of anesthesia during surgery. This article reviews the bases of these techniques and their development within the last decades and provides a synopsis of the relevant methodologies and algorithms that are used to analyze EEG signals. In addition, it aims to present some of the physiological background of the EEG signal, developments in EEG signal processing, and the effective methods used to remove various types of noise. This review will hopefully increase efforts to develop methods that use EEG signals for determining and classifying the depth of anesthesia with a high data rate to produce a flexible and reliable detection device.","Al-Kadi, Mahmoud I; Reaz, Mamun Bin Ibne; Ali, Mohd Alauddin Mohd",Sensors,189,1

On the one hand, circumstances associated with armed conflicts may give rise to greater spread of the virus, while, on the other hand, the COVID-19 pandemic may create conditions for violence through heightened xenophobia and nationalism or may change the dynamics of existing conflicts. We illustrate this with the example of war in the South Caucasus, one of the hot spots of the pandemic. Elsewhere, COVID-19 may have reduced the intensity of conflicts in some places, but it also may have contributed to anti-government protests and communal violence.

Recalling the increased rates of major complications at the advent of laparoscopic cholecystectomy 20 years ago, however, it is clear that appropriate training is required before adopting a new technique. This study aims to review the current evidence for training and skills acquisition for SILS. METHODS A comprehensive database search of PubMED, MEDLINE, EMBASE and Google Scholar was carried out. Studies considered for inclusion were those addressing SILS learning curves, skills acquisition, or training. RESULTS 21 studies were included in the final analysis. Ten clinical case series with analysis of SILS learning curve demonstrated a significant learning curve for conventional multiport laparoscopic (LAP)-trained surgeons over the course of initial SILS cases, with several studies reporting increased risk of conversion and complication rates. Five laboratory-based studies demonstrated differences in SILS skills acquisition compared with LAP. Six studies describing SILS-specific training curricula were analysed, but none included a robust validation of the curriculum. CONCLUSIONS Clinical case series and laboratory-based skills acquisition studies demonstrate the unique requirements of SILS, with skill sets and ergonomic demands which cannot be directly adapted from existing LAP experience. Some studies have already reported higher complication rates in initial SILS cases. To avoid repeating the mistakes of the past, the implementation of an evidence- and competency-based SILS curriculum is necessary to ensure appropriate training of future SILS surgeons.","Pucher, Philip H; Sodergren, Mikael H; Singh, Pritam; Darzi, Ara; Parakseva, Paraskevas",Surgical endoscopy,189,30

The aim of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of treating OSAHS with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and the impact of CPAP compliance. METHODS This was a retrospective, case-crossover study of 373 patients with OSAHS receiving CPAP. We compared changes in costs, Epworth score and health-related quality of life (EQ-5D questionnaires) between the year before treatment and the year after treatment. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for the first year of treatment was estimated, and projections were made for the second year, using different effectiveness and cost scenarios. RESULTS The visual analog scale score for the EQ-5D questionnaire increased by 5 points and the Epworth score fell by 10 points during the year of CPAP treatment. Mean gain in quality-adjusted life years (QALY) was 0.05 per patient per year (P<.001): 0.07 among compliers and -0.04 among non-compliers. ICER was €51,147/QALY during the first year of CPAP treatment and €1,544/QALY during the second year. CONCLUSION CPAP treatment in patients with moderate-severe OSAHS improves the quality of life of compliant patients, and is cost-effective as of the second year.","Català, Raquel; Villoro, Renata; Merino, María; Sangenís, Sandra; Colomés, Lluís; Hernández Flix, Salvador; Pérez de Llano, Luis A",Archivos de bronconeumologia,189,1

Subarachnoid hemorrhage secondary to ruptured intracranial aneurysm results in devastating neurological outcomes, leaving the majority of victims dead or disabled. Surgical clipping of intracranial aneurysms remained the definitive mode of treatment until Guglielmi detachable coils were introduced in the 1990s. This revolutionary innovation led to the recognition of neurointervention/neuroendovascular surgery as a bona fide option for intracranial aneurysms. Constant evolution of endovascular devices and techniques supported by several prospective randomized trials has catapulted the endovascular treatment of intracranial aneurysms to its current status as the preferred treatment modality for most ruptured and unruptured intracranial aneurysms. We are slowly transitioning from the era of coils to the era of flow diverters. Flow-diversion technology and techniques have revolutionized the treatment of wide-necked, giant, and fusiform aneurysms, where the results of microsurgery or conventional neuroendovascular strategies have traditionally been dismal. Although the Pipeline Embolization Device (ev3-Covidien, Irvine, CA) is the only flow-diversion device approved by the Food and Drug Administration for use in the United States, others are commercially available in Europe and South America, including the Silk (Balt Extrusion, Montmorency, France), Flow-Redirection Endoluminal Device (FRED; MicroVention, Tustin, CA), Surpass (Stryker, Kalamazoo, MI), and p64 (Phenox, Bochum, Germany). Improvements in technology and operator experience and the encouraging results of clinical trials have led to broader acceptance for the use of these devices in cerebral aneurysm management. Continued innovation and refinement of endovascular devices and techniques will inevitably improve technical success rates, reduce procedure-related complications, and broaden the endovascular therapeutic spectrum for varied aneurysm morphology.","Krishna, Chandan; Sonig, Ashish; Natarajan, Sabareesh K; Siddiqui, Adnan H",Methodist DeBakey cardiovascular journal,189,1

Aims The study aimed to describe the COVID-19 pandemic in the Eastern Mediterranean Region, assessing the incidence, mortality-related and fatality rate in different countries, in comparison with the worldwide mean. Methods Data were sourced from the Worldometer surveillance page and from governmental reporting channels. Data were exported and analyzed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS, version 23.0). Results In the Eastern Mediterranean Region, the testing frequency is heterogeneous between countries, in addition to the reported cases and death. Very few data are available from countries with political instability and security problems (Yemen, Syrian Arab Republic and Sudan), particularly for the testing frequency. Overall, despite similar rates of testing, there was a significantly lower incidence in the Eastern Mediterranean Region versus the rest of the world, in addition to a lower mortality per million-population, particularly in countries with low to moderate testing rates. However, in countries with higher testing than the world average, there is a higher incidence, a lower mortality, but an unexpected higher fatality rate. Conclusion The overall testing frequency was similar in the Eastern Mediterranean Region compared to the rest of the world; this would be expected to lead to a similar cumulative incidence and case fatality rate. Nevertheless, the average incidence was 70% lower than the rest of the world, and mortality per million-population was lower (90%). Moreover, in Gulf Cooperation Council high-testing countries, a similar case-fatality rate to other countries in the Region was noted, but was higher than the world average, although expected to be lower. Further studies are necessary to explain discrepancies in incidence, mortality and fatality rates among countries; principally, environmental, genetic and managerial reasons should be investigated.","Salameh, Pascale",Eastern Mediterranean health journal = La revue de sante de la Mediterranee orientale = al-Majallah al-sihhiyah li-sharq al-mutawassit,189,8

The disease has imposed a huge burden on health resources. Evaluation of clinical and epidemiological profiles of such patients can help in understanding and managing the outbreak more efficiently. This study was a prospective observational analysis of 200 diagnosed COVID-19 patients admitted to a tertiary care center from 20th march to 8th May 2020. All these patients were positive for COVID-19 by an oro-nasopharyngeal swab-rtPCR based testing. Analyses of demographic factors, clinical characteristics, comorbidities, laboratory parameters, and the outcomes were performed. The mean age of the population was 40 years with a slight male predominance (116 patients out of 200, 58%). A majority of the patients (147, 73.5 %) were symptomatic, with fever being the most common symptom (109, 54.5%), followed by cough (91, 45.5%). An older age, presence of symptoms and their duration, leukocytosis, a high quick SOFA score, a high modified SOFA score, need for ventilator support, an AST level more than 3 times the upper limit of normal (ULN), and a serum creatinine level of 2 mg/dl or greater were at a significantly higher risk of ICU admission and mortality. Presence of diabetes mellitus, AST > three times ULN, serum creatinine 2 mg/dl or higher, and a qSOFA score of 1 or higher were all associated with significantly greater odds of critical care requirement. Triage and severity assessment helps in deciding the requirement for a hospital stay and ICU admission for COVID-19 which can easily be done using clinical and laboratory parameters. A mild, moderate and severe category approach with defined criteria and treatment guidelines will help in judicious utilization of health-care resources, especially for developing countries like India. *Other members of the Safdarjung Hospital COVID-19 working group: Balvinder Singh (Microbiology), MK Sen (Pulmonary Medicine), Shibdas Chakrabarti (Pulmonary Medicine), NK Gupta (Pulmonary medicine), AJ Mahendran (Pulmonary Medicine), Ramesh Meena (Medicine), G Usha (Anaesthesiology), Santvana Kohli (Anaesthesiology), Sahil Diwan (Anaesthesiology), Rushika Saksena (Microbiology), Vikramjeet Dutta (Microbiology), Anupam Kr Anveshi (Microbiology).","Gupta, Nitesh; Ish, Pranav; Kumar, Rohit; Dev, Nishanth; Yadav, Siddharth Raj; Malhotra, Nipun; Agrawal, Sumita; Gaind, Rajni; Sachdeva, Harish; Covid Working Group, Other Members Of The Safdarjung Hospital",Monaldi archives for chest disease = Archivio Monaldi per le malattie del torace,189,20

Western blot showed that both anti-CCoV mAbs only reacted with a protein of 50 kD, a weight consistent with the feline coronavirus (FCoV) viral nucleocapsid. A competitive inhibition enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay showed that the 2 recognized epitopes are distinct. Preincubation of CCV2-2 mAb with FCoV antigen suppressed the immunostaining. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections from brains of 15 cats with the dry form of feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) were examined by immunohistochemistry. Immunohistochemistry was performed with both anti-CCoV mAbs, either on consecutive or on the same sections. A myeloid-histiocytic marker, MAC 387, was also used to identify FIP virus-infected cells. In all regions where MAC 387-positive cells were present, positive staining with the CCV2-2 mAb was systematically detected, except at some levels in 1 cat. In contrast, none or only a few cells were positive for the FIPV3-70 mAb. Double immunostaining showed macrophages that were immunopositive for either CCV2-2 alone or alternatively for CCV2-2 and FIPV3-70 mAbs. This reveals the coexistence of 2 cohorts of phagocytes whose FIP viral contents differed by the presence or absence of the FIPV3-70-recognized epitope. These findings provide evidence for antigenic heterogeneity in coronavirus nucleocapsid protein in FIP lesions, a result that is in line with molecular observations. In addition, we provide for the first time morphologic depiction of viral variants distribution in these lesions.","Poncelet, L; Coppens, A; Peeters, D; Bianchi, E; Grant, C K; Kadhim, H",Veterinary pathology,189,9

BACKGROUND On several continents in 2002-2003, the highly infectious severe acute respiratory syndrome overwhelmed health care systems and health professionals who had to provide care in situations involving high personal risk and stress, some becoming infected and dying. Nurse leaders in Taiwan had to develop new strategies and support systems for nursing care. DESIGN A two-step within-method qualitative triangulation research design. METHODS Focus group in-depth interviews held with 70 nurse leaders from four Northern Taiwan hospitals involved in the severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic. Participants then completed an open ended questionnaire. Content analysis was undertaken with data and stages and themes generated. Data were then analysed using Hobfall's concepts of conservation of resources to further discuss participants' reactions and actions in the severe acute respiratory syndrome crisis. RESULTS Participants worked under incredible stress to lead the profession through a period of crisis. Five stages arose in the participants' involvement against severe acute respiratory syndrome over 12 weeks: facing shock and chaos; searching for reliable sources to clarify myths; developing and adjusting nursing care; supporting nurses and their clients; and rewarding nurses. CONCLUSION Nurse leaders become important executors of intervention in this health disaster, requiring emotional intelligence to manage their internal conflicts and interpersonal relationships effectively. They developed sociopolitical and analytical abilities and crucial requirements for planning and implementing strategies in areas where none previously existed. Building support systems was an important resource for managing conflicts between familial and professional roles. Relevance to clinical practice. Findings will assist nurse leaders to prepare themselves and the profession to better deal with disaster management in similar infectious outbreaks in the future.","Shih, Fu-Jin; Turale, Sue; Lin, Yaw-Sheng; Gau, Meei-Ling; Kao, Ching-Chiu; Yang, Chyn-Yng; Liao, Yen-Chi",Journal of clinical nursing,189,1

The impetus of this article is to show that immunosenescence is a risk factor to COVID-19 and not aging per se. Based on the idea that some older people are also healthier than younger ones, the emphasis of this article is on immunosenescence and not aging as a risk factor of COVID-19 complications. The paper utilizes a biopsychosocial approach to expound on the link between immunosenescence and COVID-19 risk factors. The article explores biological factors such as malnutrition, comorbidities, substance abuse, and sex. It also expands on psychosocial factors such as mental health disorders, homelessness, unemployment, lack of physical exercises, stigma, and discrimination. The article calls for gerontological social work to assume a developmental-clinical social work perspective to prevent the early onset and progression of immunosenescence. It calls for gerontological social work to prevent factors that promote unhealthy aging. The article promotes a preventative stance to practice and not just curative approaches. Treatment involves primary prevention which emphasizes on avoiding the onset of unhealthy aging. It is this approach that gerontological social work should aim also to address in building resilience in the face of pandemics.","Chigangaidze, Robert K; Chinyenze, Patience",Journal of gerontological social work,189,16

During such procedures, it is important to maintain an appropriate level of sedation to minimize the risk of respiratory depression if patients are over-sedated and added pain or anxiety if under-sedated. However, there is currently no objective way to measure the patient's evolving level of sedation during a procedure. We investigated the use of capnography-derived features as an objective measure of sedation level. Time-based capnograms were recorded from 30 patients during sedation for cardioversion. Through causal k-means clustering of selected features, we sequentially assigned each exhalation to one of three distinct clusters, or states. Transitions between these states correlated to events during sedation (drug administration, procedure start and end, and clinical interventions). Similar clustering of capnogram recordings from 26 healthy, non-sedated subjects did not reveal distinctly separated states.","Mieloszyk, Rebecca J; Guo, Margaret G; Verghese, George C; Andolfatto, Gary; Heldt, Thomas; Krauss, Baruch S",Conference proceedings : ...

Prior to the introduction of video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS), lung resection for cancer was undertaken through an open thoracotomy. To date, the evidence base supporting the different surgical approaches is based on non-randomised studies, small randomised trials and is focused mainly on short-term in-hospital outcomes. METHODS AND ANALYSIS The VIdeo assisted thoracoscopic lobectomy versus conventional Open LobEcTomy for lung cancer study is a UK multicentre parallel group randomised controlled trial (RCT) with blinding of outcome assessors and participants (to hospital discharge) comparing the effectiveness, cost-effectiveness and acceptability of VATS lobectomy versus open lobectomy for treatment of lung cancer. We will test the hypothesis that VATS lobectomy is superior to open lobectomy with respect to self-reported physical function 5 weeks after randomisation (approximately 1 month after surgery). Secondary outcomes include assessment of efficacy (hospital stay, pain, proportion and time to uptake of chemotherapy), measures of safety (adverse health events), oncological outcomes (proportion of patients upstaged to pathologic N2 (pN2) disease and disease-free survival), overall survival and health related quality of life to 1 year. The QuinteT Recruitment Intervention is integrated into the trial to optimise recruitment. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION This trial has been approved by the UK (Dulwich) National Research Ethics Service Committee London. Findings will be written-up as methodology papers for conference presentation, and publication in peer-reviewed journals. Many aspects of the feasibility work will inform surgical RCTs in general and these will be reported at methodology meetings. We will also link with lung cancer clinical studies groups. The patient and public involvement group that works with the Respiratory Biomedical Research Unit at the Brompton Hospital will help identify how we can best publicise the findings.

There is an incomplete understanding of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis and transmission potential at this time and the resultant anxiety has led to variable breastfeeding recommendations for suspected or confirmed mothers with novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Due to the potential concern for transmission of infection from maternal respiratory secretions to the newborn, temporary separation of the maternal-baby dyad, allowing for expressed breast milk to be fed to the infant, was initially recommended but later revised to include breastfeeding by the American Academy of Pediatrics in contrast to international societies, which recommend direct breastfeeding. This separation can have negative health and emotional implications for both mother and baby. Only two publications have reported SARS-CoV-2 in human breast milk but the role of breast milk as a vehicle of transmission of COVID-19 to the newborns still remains unclear and may indeed be providing protective antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 infection even in infected neonates. Other modes of transmission of infection to neonates from infected mothers or any care providers cannot be overemphasized. Symptomatic mothers on hydroxychloroquine can safely breastfeed and no adverse effects were reported in a baby treated with remdesivir in another drug trial. The excretion of sarilumab in human breast milk is unknown at this time. Hence, given the overall safety of breast milk and both short-term and long- term nutritional, immunological, and developmental advantages of breast milk to newborn, breast milk should not be withheld from baby. The setting of maternal care, severity of maternal infection and availability of resources can impact the decision of breastfeeding, the role of shared decision making on breastfeeding between mother and physician needs to be emphasized. We strongly recommend direct breastfeeding with appropriate hygiene precautions unless the maternal or neonatal health condition warrants separation of this dyad.

In this article, we review a number of recent studies that attempt to explicitly incorporate the dynamics of the immune system (instead of merely representing it by a single black box parameter) in models for the evolution of parasite virulence. A striking observation is that the type of infection (acute or chronic) is invariably considered to be a constraint that model assumptions have to satisfy rather than as a potential outcome of the interaction of the parasite with its host's immune system. We argue that avoiding making assumptions about the type of infection will lead to a better understanding of infectious diseases, even though a number of fundamental and technical problems remain. Dynamical modeling of the immune system opens a wide range of perspectives: for understanding how the immune system eradicates a parasite (which it does for most pathogens but not for all, HIV being a notorious example of a virus that is not completely eliminated), for studying multiple infections through concomitant immunity, for understanding the emergence and evolution of the immune system in animals, and for evolutionary epidemiology in general (e.g., predicting evolutionary consequences of new therapies and public health policies). We conclude by discussing new approaches based on embedded (or nested) models and identify future perspectives for the modeling of infectious diseases.","Alizon, Samuel; van Baalen, Minus",The American naturalist,189,16

During the labeling procedure, formation of (68)Ga-colloid may occur. Upon i.v. injection, (68)Ga-colloid will accumulate rapidly in the liver, spleen, and bone marrow, resulting in reduced target-to-background ratios. In this study, we applied a thin layer chromatography (TLC) method to measure colloid content and we studied the effect of the purification method on the in vivo characteristics of (68)Ga-labeled DOTA-exendin-3. DOTA-exendin-3 was labeled with (68)Ga, and the colloid content was measured by TLC on silica gel ITLC with two mobile phases. The labeling mixture was purified by gel filtration on a 5-ml G25M column, by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) using a C8 column or by solid phase extraction (SPE) on an HLB cartridge. The in vivo characteristics of the preparations were determined in BALB/c nude mice, and PET images were acquired 1 h p.i. using a microPET scanner. In these studies, unpurified (68)Ga-DOTA-exendin-3 and (111)In-DOTA-exendin-3 were used as a reference. RESULTS The colloid content of (111)In-DOTA-exendin-3 and unpurified, gel filtration, RP-HPLC- and SPE-purified (68)Ga-DOTA exendin-3 was <3, 7, 9, <3, and <3 %, respectively. Unpurified (68)Ga-DOTA exendin-3 showed high liver and spleen uptake. Gel filtration partly removed (68)Ga-colloid from the preparation, resulting in moderate liver and spleen SPE-purified (68)Ga-DOTA exendin-3 showed very low liver and spleen uptake, that was similar to that of RP-HPLC purified (68)Ga-DOTA exendin-3. CONCLUSIONS We showed that the colloid content can be measured by TLC and that solid phase extraction and HPLC completely remove (68)Ga-colloid from (68)Ga-labeled tracer preparations, resulting in very low liver and spleen uptake. This study clearly shows the importance of removal of (68)Ga-colloid from preparations.","Brom, Maarten; Franssen, Gerben M; Joosten, Lieke; Gotthardt, Martin; Boerman, Otto C",EJNMMI research,189,1

Particularly for such challenging situations the handling of an SAD requires sufficient training. We hypothesized that the feasibility of manikin-based airway management with second generation SADs depends on the type of manikin. Methods Two airway manikins (TruCorp AirSim® and Laerdal Resusci Anne® Airway Trainer™) were evaluated by 80 experienced anesthesia providers using 5 different second generation SADs (LMA® Supreme™ [LMA], Ambu® AuraGain™, i-gel®, KOO™-SGA and LTS-D™). The primary outcome of the study was feasibility of ventilation measured by assessment of the manikins' lung distention. As secondary outcome measures, oropharyngeal leakage pressure (OLP), ease of gastric tube insertion the insertion time, position and subjective assessments were evaluated. Results Ventilation was feasible with all combinations of SAD and manikin. By contrast, an OLP exceeding 10 cm H2O could be reached with most of the SADs in the TruCorp but with the LTS-D only in the Laerdal manikin. Gastric tube insertion was successful in above 90% in the Laerdal vs 87% in the TruCorp manikin (P<0.009). Insertion times differed significantly between manikins. The SAD positions were better in the Laerdal manikin for LMA, Ambu, i-gel and LTS-D. Participant's assessments were superior in the Laerdal manikin for LMA, Ambu, i-gel and KOO-SGA. Conclusions Ventilation is possible with all combinations. However, manikins are variable in their ability to adequately represent additional functions of second generation SADs. In order to achieve the best performance during training, the airway manikin should be chosen depending on the SAD in question.","Schmutz, Axel; Bohn, Erich; Spaeth, Johannes; Heinrich, Sebastian",Therapeutics and clinical risk management,189,12

We retrospectively analyzed the clinical course of all cases with assessable baseline TP53 status and/or ALK fusion variant treated at our institutions (n = 102). TP53 mutations were present in 17/87 (20%) and the echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4 (EML4)-ALK variant 3 (V3) in 41/92 (45%) patients. The number of metastatic sites at diagnosis was affected more by the presence of V3 than by TP53 mutations, and highest with both factors (mean 5.3, p < 0.001). Under treatment with ALK TKI, progression-free survival (PFS) was shorter with either TP53 mutations or V3, while double positive cases appeared to have an even higher risk (hazard ratio [HR] = 2.9, p = 0.015). The negative effect of V3 on PFS of TKI-treated patients was strong already in the first line (HR = 2.5, p = 0.037) and decreased subsequently, whereas a trend for PFS impairment under first-line TKI by TP53 mutations became stronger and statistically significant only when considering all treatment lines together. Overall survival was impaired more by TP53 mutations (HR = 4.9, p = 0.003) than by V3 (HR = 2.4, p = 0.018), while patients with TP53 mutated V3-driven tumors carried the highest risk of death (HR = 9.1, p = 0.02). Thus, TP53 mutations and V3 are independently associated with enhanced metastatic spread, shorter TKI responses and inferior overall survival in ALK+ lung adenocarcinoma. Both markers could assist selection of cases for more aggressive management and guide development of novel therapeutic strategies. In combination, they define a patient subset with very poor outcome.","Christopoulos, P; Kirchner, M; Bozorgmehr, F; Endris, V; Elsayed, M; Budczies, J; Ristau, J; Penzel, R; Herth, F J; Heussel, C P; Eichhorn, M; Muley, T; Meister, M; Fischer, J R; Rieken, S; Lasitschka, F; Bischoff, H; Sotillo, R; Schirmacher, P; Thomas, M; Stenzinger, A",International journal of cancer,189,1

One important abnormality present in tumors is vessel compression. Vessel decompression has been shown to increase survival rates in animal models via enhanced and more homogeneous oxygenation. However, our knowledge of the biophysical mechanisms linking tumor decompression to improved tumor oxygenation is limited. In this study, we propose a computational model to investigate the impact of vessel compression on red blood cell (RBC) dynamics in tumor vascular networks. Our results demonstrate that vessel compression can alter RBC partitioning at bifurcations in a hematocrit-dependent and flow rate-independent manner. We identify RBC focusing due to cross-streamline migration as the mechanism responsible and characterize the spatiotemporal recovery dynamics controlling downstream partitioning. Based on this knowledge, we formulate a reduced-order model that will help future research to elucidate how these effects propagate at a whole vascular network level. These findings contribute to the mechanistic understanding of hemodilution in tumor vascular networks and oxygen homogenization following pharmacological solid tumor decompression.","Enjalbert, Romain; Hardman, David; Krüger, Timm; Bernabeu, Miguel O",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,189,30

Therefore, this work aimed to determine the purity and to identify and quantify the main adulterants found in personal doses of cocaine (perico) and coca paste (bazuco) in Cartagena de Indias (Colombia). The data collected in this study describe a first attempt to introduce the qualitative and quantitative analyses of adulterants present in street drugs in Cartagena de Indias to improve surveillance. Through gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC-MS), the purity and adulterants were quantified in 45 personal doses of cocaine powder and coca paste. 100% of the personal doses in the city were adulterated; caffeine, phenacetin, and levamisole were the main adulterants identified in cocaine. Besides the above, lidocaine was also found in coca paste. The purity of cocaine varied from 8% to almost 70%, with caffeine ranging from 6% to 42%. In the case of coca paste, the maximum content of cocaine found was 60%, while some samples contained as little as 14%. The results are consistent with other research in terms of the widespread use of caffeine as an adulterant, but they also follow the growing trend of the use of levamisole and phenacetin. The wide range of cocaine content in samples sold in the illicit market could cause undesirable effects on cocaine users who do not know the exact intended dose for consumption; so, this study intends to make these results available not only to academic, public health, and national security agencies but also to tourists entering Cartagena de Indias, so that they are aware of what they are consuming and the risks to which they are exposed.","Urzola-Ortega, Jefferson; Mendoza-Goez, Luis; Acevedo, Diofanor",TheScientificWorldJournal,189,16

OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to determine the effect of foot reflexology applied before coronary angiography and percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty on the anxiety, stress, and cortisol levels of individuals. METHODS A simple randomized trial design was used. The patients who met the inclusion criteria were divided into 4 groups including experimental and control groups of coronary angiography patients (30 patients in each group) and percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (26 patients in each group) by randomization method. Data were collected with the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory and Distress Thermometer 90 minutes before coronary angiography and percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and the laboratory samples were taken. After these procedures, foot reflexology was applied to both feet of the patients in the experimental group for 30 minutes, and the control group received only standard care. The inventories were reapplied 30 minutes after the reflexology application and after coronary angiography and percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. RESULTS Whereas there was no statistically significant difference (P > .05) between the coronary angiography and percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty experimental and control groups in Anxiety Inventory and stress median scores before reflexology, a significant difference was found (P < .001) 30 minutes after reflexology application and after coronary angiography and percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. After the reflexology, anxiety and stress scores were significantly lower in the experimental group compared with the control group (P < .001). Whereas there was a significant difference (P < .001) in the within-group cortisol values of both reflexology groups, no significant difference was found in the control groups (P > .05). CONCLUSIONS The application of reflexology before coronary angiography and percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty reduces the levels of anxiety, stress, and cortisol without any side effects.","Vural Doğru, Birgül; ŞenuzunAykar, Fisun; Yıldırım, Yasemin; Yavuzgil, Oğuz; Sözmen, Eser; Memmedov, Hikmet",The Journal of cardiovascular nursing,189,19

Cardiopulmonary TRs are distressing, and collectively account for most transfusion fatalities, though the degree to which they alter survival more broadly is unclear. Deaths (and their timing) after TRs may provide further insights. MATERIALS/METHODS Adult (tri-hospital network) haemovigilance data (2013-2016) recorded referrals with conclusions ranging from unrelated to transfusion (UTR) to entities such as: septic TRs, serologic/haemolytic reactions, transfusion-associated circulatory overload (TACO), transfusion-associated dyspnoea (TAD), transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI), allergic transfusion reaction (ATR), and others. For (in- or out-patient) visits involving suspected TRs (VISTRs), all-cause mortalities (% [95% confidence interval]) and associated time-to-death (TTD) (median days, [interquartile range]) were compared. Diagnoses were defined inclusively (possible-to-definite) or strictly (probable-to-definite). RESULTS Of 1144 events, rank order VISTR mortality following (possible-to-definite) TRs, and associated TTDs, were led by: DHTR 33% [6-19], 1 death at 123d; TRALI 32% [15-54], 6 deaths: 3d [2-20]; BaCon 21% [14-31], 17 deaths: 10d [3-28]; TACO 18% [12-26], 23 deaths: 16d [6-28]; TAD 17% [11-26]: 18 deaths, 6d [3-12]. Higher-certainty TRs ranked similarly (DHTR 50% [9-91]; BaCon 29% [12-55], 4 deaths: 12d [3-22]; and TACO 25% [16-38], 15 deaths: 21d [6-28]). VISTR mortality after TACO or TRALI significantly exceeded ATR (3·3% [2·4-5·8], P < 0·00001) but was not different from UTR events (P = 0·3). CONCLUSIONS Only half of cardiopulmonary TRs constituted high certainty diagnoses. Nevertheless, cardiopulmonary TRs and suspected BaCon marked higher VISTR mortality with shorter TTDs. Short (<1 week) TTDs in TAD, BaCon or TRALI imply either contributing roles in death, treatment refractoriness and/or applicable TR susceptibilities in the dying.","McVey, Mark J; Cohen, Robert; Arsenault, Valerie; Escorcia, Alioska; Tasmin, Farzana; Pendergrast, Jacob; Lieberman, Lani; Lin, Yulia; Callum, Jeannie; Cserti-Gazdewich, Christine",Vox sanguinis,189,24

METHODS A retrospective cohort study of all women with a singleton pregnancy who gave birth > 24 week gestation in a single center (2000-2016). The exposure of interest was SGA, defined as birth weight < 10th or < 25th centile according to three fetal growth charts (Hadlock et al., Radiology 181:129-133, 1991; intergrowth-21st (IG21), WHO 2017, and a Canadian birthweight-based reference-Kramer et al., Pediatrics 108:E35, 2001). The outcome of interest was antepartum stillbirth due to placental dysfunction or unknown etiology. Cases of stillbirth attributed to other specific etiologies were excluded. RESULTS A total of 49,458 women were included in the cohort. There were 103 (0.21%) cases of stillbirth due to placental dysfunction or unknown etiology. For cases in the early stillbirth cluster (≤ 30 weeks), the detection rate was high and was similar for the three ultrasound-based fetal growth charts of Hadlock, IG21, and WHO (range 83.3-87.0%). In contrast, the detection rate of SGA for cases in the late stillbirth cluster (> 30 weeks) was low, being highest for WHO and Hadlock (36.7% and 34.7%, respectively), and lowest for IG21 (18.4%). Using a threshold of the 25th centile increased the detection rate for stillbirth by approximately 15-20% compared with that achieved by the 10th centile cutoff. CONCLUSION At > 30 week gestation, the Hadlock or WHO fetal growth charts provided the best balance between detection rate and false positive rate for stillbirth.","Hiersch, Liran; Lipworth, Hayley; Kingdom, John; Barrett, Jon; Melamed, Nir",Archives of gynecology and obstetrics,189,27

MATERIALS AND METHODS The CORAL roll-in database was used to describe the baseline characteristics of the patients in the roll-in cohort, all of whom underwent renal artery stent placement; to evaluate CORAL site performance; to compare estimates of lesion (stenosis) severity made by site interventionalists with the central CORAL angiographic core laboratory readings; and to report outcomes after renal artery stent placement. During the roll-in phase, 239 patients (mean age, 70.2 y ± 9.0; 49% male) underwent renal artery stent procedures. Angiographic core laboratory analysis of renal arteriograms was done, and participants were followed at 1 month and 9 months. RESULTS Major angiographic complications were identified in 28 (13%) subjects. Kidney function remained unchanged at the short (2-4 weeks) follow-up interval. Improvement in systolic blood pressure with use of distal embolic protection devices (n = 161) did not show any clinical benefit over nonuse of such devices (n = 78) in this small series. At 9 months, there were significantly more endpoints reported by site in subjects with bilateral renal artery stenosis (P = .01) and prior history of stroke (P = .03). CONCLUSIONS In the roll-in phase of the CORAL study, a significant number of angiographic complications were identified. No effect was seen on estimated glomerular filtration rate after renal artery stent placement, but systolic blood pressure decreased significantly.","Murphy, Timothy P; Cooper, Christopher J; Cutlip, Donald E; Matsumoto, Alan; Jamerson, Kenneth; Rundback, John; Rosenfield, Kenneth A; Henrich, William; Shapiro, Joseph; Massaro, Joseph; Yen, Chen-Hsing; Burtch, Holly; Thum, Claudia; Reid, Diane; Dworkin, Lance",Journal of vascular and interventional radiology : JVIR,189,20

AIM To perform a diagnostic accuracy study to confirm if a point of care (POC) analyser for FIT could be safely used as an adjunct in the triage and management of two-week wait (TWW) colorectal patients. DESIGN The ""POC FIT"" prospective observational cohort study was designed for TWW patients at a regional referral centre. Between July 2019 and March 2020, patients were invited to perform and bring a FIT sample to clinic. FIT was completed within the clinic appointment using a POC quantitative analyser that has a two-minute processing time (QuikRead go®). Patients and clinicians were blinded to results within the clinic appointment. The results were compared with subsequent diagnostic outcomes. Faecal haemoglobin <10 μg haemoglobin/g of faeces was considered a negative result. Sensitivities for colorectal cancer (CRC) and combined serious bowel disease (SBD) were calculated using this pre-determined cut-off. RESULTS 553 patients were included for analytical comparison with diagnostic outcomes. There were 14 (2.5%) patients with CRC and 52 (9.4%) with SBD. The sensitivities for CRC and SBD were 92.9% (95% Confidence Interval (CI): 68.5-98.7%) and 76.9% (CI:63.9-86.3%) respectively. 379 (68.5%) patients had a negative FIT result (negative predictive value for CRC was 99.7%) CONCLUSIONS: POC FIT is a useful adjunct to better manage TWW patients. The high observed sensitivity for CRC offers opportunities, within a single consultation, for improved triage and rationalisation of investigation for those with bowel symptoms.","Maclean, William; Mackenzie, Paul; Limb, Chris; Zahoor, Zahida; Whyte, Martin B; Rockall, Timothy; Benton, Sally C; Jourdan, Iain",Colorectal disease : the official journal of the Association of Coloproctology of Great Britain and Ireland,189,26

Extended-release opioid products are particularly prone to abuse due to the high amount of opioid present. By bypassing the controlled-release mechanisms and non-oral administration, individuals experience intense and dangerous ""highs."" Abuse-deterrent opioid formulations have been recommended as a potential solution to the crisis, but widespread utilization has been stunted and their role in therapy remains unclear owing to limited real-world efficacy data and affordability issues.This review discusses abuse-deterrent opioid formulations, the mechanisms and data underlying available products, and a pharmacist's perspective of their role in the opioid crisis. METHODS The authors reviewed PubMed, Medline, and Google Scholar electronic databases for pre- and post-marketing studies on OxyContin, Xtampza ER, and Hysingla ER. RESULTS Studies showed lower rates of abuse (19% reduction), opioid use disorder (27%), overdose (34%), and fatalities (85%) with the reformulated OxyContin when compared with the original product and comparator opioids. However, these studies revealed the potential for bypassing abuse-deterrent mechanisms and diverting abuse to other drugs.Post-marketing studies are unavailable for Xtampza ER or Hysingla ER, although pre-marketing studies suggested some controlled-release properties persist when the product is manipulated, indicating that abuse may be more difficult and less rewarding. CONCLUSIONS Abuse-deterrent opioid products may lead to reductions in abuse, overdose, and overdose fatalities. However, cost, loopholes in deterrence mechanism, and possible diversion to other substances hinder their role in the opioid crisis. Multiple approaches must be employed to improve opioid safety, and further post-marketing and real-world analyses should be performed on available opioid formulations to assess their impact on abuse-related adverse events.","Gadd, Shannon; Cox, Nicholas; Samuelson, James; Kenney, Amy; Turner, Kyle; Cochran, Gerald",Therapeutic drug monitoring,189,9

Oxygen isotope exchange experiments were conducted in the temperature range 573 ≤ T / K ≤ 673 at an oxygen activity of aO2 = 0.2. Subsequently, Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (SIMS) measurements were performed on the thin-film samples to obtain 18O isotope depth profiles. All 18O isotope profiles showed two features, suggesting spatially non-uniform oxygen tracer diffusion coefficients in the samples. A numerical solution to the diffusion equation was able to describe the experimental profiles and yielded oxygen tracer diffusion coefficients D∗, and oxygen surface exchange coefficients k∗. Values of D∗ obtained were found, surprisingly, to be different for the two orientations and also orders of magnitude lower than values for ceramic samples in this temperature range. As possible explanations, we examine quantitatively the effect of halide anion impurities and the effect of ultra-small columnar grains on oxygen tracer diffusion. Surface exchange coefficients for the (111) oriented surface were found to be roughly one order of magnitude higher than those for (110). We discuss two possible explanations for the observed behaviour: the enrichment of anion impurities at the surface and the interaction between the surface and vapour water in the gas phase.","Waldow, Stephan P; Statham, Benjamin James; Wardenga, Hans F; Weirich, Thomas E; Klein, Andreas; De Souza, Roger A",ACS applied materials & interfaces,189,1

On the left side the common carotid artery (CCA) arises directly from the aortic arc, whereas on the right side the CCA originate from the innominate artery. The aim of this study was to compare LMov of the left and right CCA of healthy subjects to investigate whether the difference in anatomy are of importance for LMov. The CCA's of 93 healthy subjects were investigated using in-house developed ultrasound methods. Although the basic pattern were the same in the majority of subjects, several phases of LMov were significantly larger on the left side (the first retrograde phase, p=00006; the second antegrade, ""returning"" phase, p<0.00001; and the rapid retrograde phase of movement at the end of the cardiac cycle, p<0.000001). In contrast, no significant side-difference in the amplitude of the first antegrade movement was seen. The maximal (peak-to-peak) LMov was significantly larger on the left side (p=0.002). The side differences found seem to increase with aging, and may be related to the difference in anatomy, including possible difference in distance to the heart and especially the presence of an extra bifurcation on the right side. Our data provide an important base for the further study of the relation between the longitudinal movement and atherosclerosis and atherosclerotic plaques.","Zhu, Yuxiang; Cinthio, Magnus; Erlöv, Tobias; Bjarnegård, Niclas; Ahlgren, Åsa Rydén",Clinical physiology and functional imaging,189,19

A circular stapler often is used for B-I gastroduodenostomy in open and laparoscopic-assisted distal gastrectomy. Recently, totally laparoscopic distal gastrectomy (TLDG) has been considered less invasive than laparoscopic-assisted gastrectomy, and many institutions performing laparoscopic-assisted distal gastrectomy are trying to progress to TLDG without markedly changing the anastomosis method. The purpose of this report is to introduce the technical details of new methods of intracorporeal gastroduodenostomy using either a circular or linear stapler and to evaluate their technical feasibility and safety. METHODS Seventeen patients who underwent TLDG with the intracorporeal double-stapling technique using a circular stapler (n = 7) or the book-binding technique (BBT) using a linear stapler (n = 10) between February 2010 and April 2011 were enrolled in the study. Clinicopathological data, surgical data, and postoperative outcomes were analyzed. RESULTS There were no intraoperative complications or conversions to open surgery in any of the 17 patients. The usual postoperative complications following gastroduodenostomy, such as anastomotic leakage and stenosis, were not observed. Anastomosis took significantly longer to complete with DST (64 ± 24 min) than with BBT (34 ± 7 min), but more stapler cartridges were needed with BBT than with DST. CONCLUSIONS TLDG using a circular or linear stapler is feasible and safe to perform. DST will enable institutions performing laparoscopic-assisted distal gastrectomy with circular staplers to progress to TLDG without problems, and this progression may be more economical because fewer stapler cartridges are used during surgery. However, if an institution has already been performing δ anastomosis in TLDG but has been experiencing certain issues with δ anastomosis, converting from δ anastomosis to BBT should be beneficial.","Ikeda, Tetsuo; Kawano, Hiroyuki; Hisamatsu, Yuichi; Ando, Koji; Saeki, Hiroshi; Oki, Eiji; Ohga, Takefumi; Kakeji, Yoshihiro; Tsujitani, Shunichi; Kohnoe, Shunji; Maehara, Yoshihiko",Surgical endoscopy,189,1

We evaluated whether these perfusion strategies influenced fluid extravasation rates and edema generation differently per-operatively. MATERIALS AND METHODS Twelve anesthetized pigs, randomly allocated to DHLF (n = 6) or DHCA (n = 6), underwent 2.5 hours CPB with cooling to 20°C for 30 minutes (min), followed by 30 min arrested circulation (DHCA) or 30 min low-flow circulation (DHLF) before 90 min rewarming to normothermia. Perfusion of tissues, fluid requirements, plasma volumes, colloid osmotic pressures and total tissue water contents were recorded and fluid extravasation rates calculated. During the experiments, cerebral microdialysis was performed in both groups. RESULTS Microvascular fluid homeostasis was similar in both groups, with no between-group differences, reflected by similar fluid extravasation rates, plasma colloid osmotic pressures and total tissue water contents. Although extravasation rates increased dramatically from 0.10 (0.11) ml/kg/min (mean with standard deviation in parentheses) and 0.16 (0.02) ml/kg/min to 1.28 (0.58) ml/kg/min and 1.06 (0.41) ml/kg/min (DHCA and DHLF, respectively) after the initiation of CPB, fluid filtrations during both cardiac arrest and low flow were modest and close to baseline values. Cerebral microdialysis indicated anaerobic metabolism and ischemic brain injury in the DHCA group. CONCLUSION No differences in microvascular fluid exchange could be demonstrated as a direct effect of DHCA compared with DHLF. Thirty minutes of DHCA was associated with anaerobic cerebral metabolism and possible brain injury.","Elvevoll, Bjørg; Husby, Paul; Kvalheim, Venny L; Stangeland, Lodve; Mongstad, Arve; Svendsen, Øyvind S",Perfusion,189,28

This study was designed to investigate UK smokers' accounts of impacts of COVID-19 on their smoking, to develop implications for supporting smoking cessation. Design. One hundred and thirty-two smokers aged 19-52 years (mean age 25 years), recruited through an advert distributed through social media and a dedicated Twitter page, completed an anonymous online questionnaire. Main Outcome Measures. Smokers produced written accounts of how COVID-19 had impacted their smoking. Responses were of unlimited length and completed online 22nd May-22nd June 2020 during UK COVID-19 lockdown. Results. Inductive thematic analysis generated three themes: i) increased smoking as a coping mechanism to deal with anxiety, boredom, stress, and anger in COVID-19 lockdown; ii) lockdown as enabling quitting through lifting social barriers and enabling a focus on health benefits; and iii) no change, avoiding Government/media COVID-19 information due to disbelief, lack of trust, and perceptions of bias. Conclusions. Results demonstrate a need for credible public health messaging on COVID-19 risk aimed at smokers. Implications for supporting smoking cessation are discussed, including maintaining quitting in those ""social smokers"" who quit during lockdown, and support on stress-management and emotion regulation in those who use smoking as a way to cope with stress, anger, and boredom.","Grogan, Sarah; Walker, Lucy; McChesney, Gillian; Gee, Ivan; Gough, Brendan; Cordero, Maria I",Psychology & health,189,8

Involvement of the pulmonary vasculature is considered a major driving force for morbidity and mortality. We set out to summarize current knowledge on the acute manifestations of pulmonary vascular disease (PVD) resulting from COVID-19 and prioritize long-term complications that may result in pulmonary hypertension (PH). RECENT FINDINGS Acute COVID-19 infection can result in widespread involvement of the pulmonary vasculature, myocardial injury, evidence of persistent lung disease, and venous thromboembolism. Post COVID-19 survivors frequently report ongoing symptoms and may be at risk for the spectrum of PH, including group 1 pulmonary arterial hypertension, group 2 PH due to left heart disease, group 3 PH due to lung disease and/or hypoxia, and group 4 chronic thromboembolic PH. SUMMARY The impact of COVID-19 on the pulmonary vasculature is central to determining disease severity. Although the long-term PVD manifestations of COVID-19 are currently uncertain, optimizing the care of risk factors for PH and monitoring for the development of PVD will be critical to reducing long-term morbidity and improving the health of survivors.","Cascino, Thomas M; Desai, Ankit A; Kanthi, Yogendra",Current opinion in pulmonary medicine,189,24

Beyond these features, PsA is associated with comorbidities that might increase the burden of the disease. AREAS COVERED In the last years a growing interest has come out for the concept of multimorbidity in rheumatology. Multimorbidity was defined as the ""co-existence of two or more chronic diseases in the same individual"". In the multimorbidity concept, the patient is of central concern and all coexisting diseases are of equal importance. Comorbidity was defined as the ""occurrence of any distinct additional entity during the clinical course of patient who has the index disease under study"". In PsA, comorbidity and multimorbidity have often been confusingly used interchangeably, showing that there is an unmet need on this topic. EXPERT OPINION This perspective article dealt with these different visions of the co-existence of other diseases in PsA, providing a distinction between them, not only for the impact on the treatment decision but also in how this concept might be incorporated into clinical trials design, choosing the right outcome measures for the patient-centric concept of multimorbidity. For this perspective, the authors searched PubMed and the Cochrane library for articles published.","Lubrano, Ennio; Scriffignano, Silvia; Perrotta, Fabio Massimo",Expert review of clinical immunology,189,29

Analyzing and learning from HIT events could reduce the risks and improve safety but are limited by accessible HIT event reports. In this study, we propose a hybrid deep learning model to identify HIT event reports from the FDA resource and thus establish the first publicly accessible database for HIT event reports. MATERIALS AND METHODS 6,994 samples (3,521 HIT and 3,473 non-HIT events) extracted from the FDA MAUDE database were employed to assess nine individual and 120 hybrid models on the task of HIT identification. The optimal model was evaluated on an independent dataset prior to its application for establishing the HIT event database. RESULTS The hybrid model consisting of logistic regression, CNN, and Hierarchical RNN (ACC=0.903, AUC=0.954, F1 score=0.876) is superior to all the other models. The causes of errors include lack of root cause (72.3%), short descriptions (19.7%), and model undertrained (8.0%). The accuracy of the hybrid model on an independent dataset is reported as 0.862. We applied the optimal model to the entire MAUDE database (1991-2018) and generated an HIT event database with 48,997 reports. CONCLUSION The first HIT event database contains 48,997 reports with an annual growth rate of 10% (∼5,000 reports). The strategy of HIT event identification and establishment of the database could help healthcare professionals describe, understand, integrate the events and propose solutions in the context of a fuller spectrum of HIT events.","Kang, Hong; Gong, Yang",Journal of biomedical informatics,189,17

Increased lesion size associated with this delay directly impacts visual acuity. Upon treatment initiation, patients are monitored largely with optical coherence tomography (OCT) technology to determine the need for treatment. Home-monitoring systems using preferential hyperacuity perimetry (PHP) and OCT may optimize management. RECENT FINDINGS Comparison of Age-related Macular Degeneration Treatment Trials study and American Academy of Ophthalmology's Intelligent Research in Sight registry data suggest smaller lesion size and better visual acuity upon choroidal neovascularization (CNV) capture are associated with better final visual acuity with therapy. The HOME study and recent PHP-based ForeseeHome data indicate that this modality leads to earlier detection of CNV. Results of a real-world data analysis demonstrate 82% retention of ≥20/40 vision with median visual acuity of 20/40 at time of CNV detection using PHP home-monitoring. Home OCT data suggests excellent patient useability, with >90% of patients obtaining analyzable images. The Notal OCT Analyzer demonstrates superiority over human interpreters regarding the ability to detect intraretinal and subretinal fluid (82% vs. 47% sensitivity). SUMMARY PHP may improve treatment outcomes for exudative AMD by allowing for earlier detection of lesions. Home OCT platforms could allow for more convenient monitoring of patients undergoing treatment for exudative AMD and better enable true PRN models.","Busquets, Miguel A; Sabbagh, Osama",Current opinion in ophthalmology,189,24

In this study, the authors report their experience with patients having had acute ischemic stroke due to cervical carotid occlusion, who underwent endovascular intervention. METHOD Sixteen acute cervical carotid occlusion patients (15 males and 1 female; mean age 67.7 years) were treated by endovascularly between January 2009 and November 2012. Clinical, procedural, and angiographic data were retrospectively evaluated. Successful intracranial recanalization was based on thrombolysis in cerebral infarction score of 2B-3. A favorable outcome was defined as a modified Rankin Scale score of 0-2 at 90 days. FINDINGS The average score of National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale before treatment was 15.9. Ten of 16 patients (63 %) were associated with intracranial tandem occlusion. Ten (63 %) cases were caused by atherosclerotic, 4 (25 %) by atrial fibrillation (AF), and 2 (13 %) by dissection. Thirteen of 16 (81 %) achieved successful cervical recanalization and 7 of 16 (44 %) patients obtained sufficient cervical and intracranial perfusion. As a result, 5 of 16 (31 %) patients demonstrated favorable outcomes. Five of seven patients (71 %) with successful cervical and intracranial recanalization presented favorable outcomes. In contrast, none of the patients without cervical or intracranial recanalization presented favorable outcomes. Three of 6 (50 %) patients initially without intracranial occlusion showed favorable outcomes, but only 2 of 10 (20 %) patients associated with intracranial occlusion had favorable outcomes. On the aspect of etiology, in atherosclerotic cases, 4 of 10 (40 %) showed favorable outcomes. However, all four AF cases deteriorated into poor outcomes. CONCLUSIONS This study demonstrated the feasibility of endovascular intervention for acute cervical carotid artery occlusion. Although treatment for tandem occlusion and AF cases is an issue that should be resolved, intervention must be encouraged. Successful cervical and intracranial revascularization will be essential for favorable outcomes.","Matsubara, Noriaki; Miyachi, Shigeru; Tsukamoto, Nobuhiro; Kojima, Takao; Izumi, Takashi; Haraguchi, Kenichi; Asai, Takumi; Yamanouchi, Takashi; Ota, Keisuke; Wakabayashi, Toshihiko",Acta neurochirurgica,189,1

No studies have evaluated single-incision splenectomy in unselected patients, and outcomes of the procedure have not previously been compared to standard laparoscopy. METHODS A retrospective review was conducted to evaluate all single-incision splenectomies performed by a single surgeon between June 2010 and June 2011. Additionally, patients who underwent standard laparoscopic splenectomy by surgeons in the same tertiary referral surgical oncology group were evaluated to serve as a control group. Demographic data, operative parameters, and postoperative outcomes were assessed. RESULTS Eight patients underwent successful single-incision splenectomy during the study period without conversion to an open procedure or requiring additional ports. The median operative time was 92.5 min. There was 25 % morbidity and no mortality in the study group. Median length of stay was 4 days. Additionally, 18 patients who underwent standard laparoscopic splenectomy were evaluated for comparison. No significant differences were identified in the preoperative patient characteristics between the two groups. Single-incision splenectomy was associated with a shorter operative time (92.5 vs. 172 min, p = 0.003), lower conversion rate, equivalent length of stay, reduced mortality, similar morbidity, and comparable postoperative narcotic requirements. CONCLUSIONS Single-incision splenectomy is feasible, safe, and efficient in an unselected patient population in the hands of an experienced laparoscopic surgeon. The single-incision technique is comparable to standard laparoscopic splenectomy in terms of operative time and perioperative outcomes.","Boone, Brian A; Wagner, Patrick; Ganchuk, Emily; Evans, Leonard; Evans, Steven; Zeh, Herb J; Bartlett, David L; Holtzman, Matthew P",Surgical endoscopy,189,16

METHODS A retrospective review of all patients (n = 165) undergoing colectomy for an adenoma unresectable at colonoscopy was performed on patients collected in a prospective database. One hundred four patients underwent laparoscopic colectomy and 61 underwent open colectomy between 1991 and 2003. Follow-up was 7 to 155 (median, 90) months. RESULTS In the laparoscopic group, 85% of the patients underwent a right colectomy and 15% underwent a left colectomy or a sigmoidectomy. Conversion to open colectomy occurred in 4.8% of the cases. Complications occurred in 14% of the patients, including 1 death. The median length of stay was 4 days. At final pathology, cancer was diagnosed in 15 patients: stage I in 8 patients, stage II in 5, and stage III in 2. In the open colectomy group, 69% of the patients underwent right colectomy. The complication rate reached 23% (P = .13), including death in 2 patients. The median length of stay was 6 days (P < .01). Cancer was diagnosed in 6 patients: stage I in 5 patients, and stage II in 1. Proximal (10 cm) and distal (13 cm) margins, lymph nodes harvest (9), incidence of cancer (13%), and high-grade dysplasia (22%) were similar between groups. There were no local recurrences, trocar site implants, or deaths due to cancer. CONCLUSION Laparoscopic colectomy for polyps unresectable at colonoscopy is safe. Oncologic resection of the colon should be performed for all colonoscopically unresectable polyps due to the risk of cancer.","Loungnarath, Rasmy; Mutch, Matthew G; Birnbaum, Elisa H; Read, Thomas E; Fleshman, James W",Diseases of the colon and rectum,189,16

METHODS All consecutive patients (January 2011 to December 2014; age 18-80 years), affected by prolapses with II-IV degrees hemorrhoids that underwent Longo procedure with EEA® Auto Suture stapler (Covidien) were included in the present study. RESULTS A total of 100 consecutive patients (38 females) were enrolled in the study. Preoperative Visual Analogue Scale pain assessment was 7.33±2.68. The mean duration of the procedure was 34.1±17.8 min, and the median hospital stay was 2 days (range 2-6). No major complication occurred, including relapses of mucosal prolapse. Preoperative prolapse measurement with EEA® EEA® Auto Suture stapler (2.3±0.5 cm) was well correlated direct assessment (2.4±0.6, p<0.001), but a proportional bias was identified, with significant preoperative underestimation of IMRP, particularly for lesions larger than 3 cm (around 10% of actual extent). CONCLUSIONS EEA® Auto Suture stapler seems to be safe and effective for a tailored approach to anorectal prolapse due to hemorrhoids. However, it reasonable that its actual impact may have been overestimated, beneficing of the repetitive, direct assessment of the operatory field guaranteed by preoperative IMRP measurement.","Percalli, Luigi; Passalia, Luigi; Pricolo, Renato; Riccò, Matteo",Acta bio-medica : Atenei Parmensis,189,27

Parents, teachers and healthcare providers are also increasingly using such interventions with children. This review examines the use of meditation-based interventions in the treatment of children with Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Electronic databases searched included PsycINFO, Medline, CINAHL, and AMED. Inclusion criteria involved children (aged to 18 years) diagnosed with ADHD, delivery of a meditation-based intervention to children and/or parents, and publication in a peer-reviewed journal. Studies were identified and coded using standard criteria, risk of bias was assessed using Risk of Bias in Non-randomised Studies- of interventions (ROBINS-I), and effect sizes were calculated. A total of 16 studies were identified (8 that included children in treatment, and 8 that included combined parent-child treatment). Results indicated that risk of bias was high across studies. At this stage, no definitive conclusions can be offered regarding the utility of meditation-based interventions for children with ADHD and/or their parents, since the methodological quality of the studies reviewed is low. Future well designed research is needed to establish the efficacy of meditation-based interventions, including commonly used practices such as mindfulness, before recommendations can be made for children with ADHD and their families.","Evans, Subhadra; Ling, Mathew; Hill, Briony; Rinehart, Nicole; Austin, David; Sciberras, Emma",European child & adolescent psychiatry,189,1

Study design 21 patients diagnosed as skeletal class III malocclusion underwent IVRO and were followed according to the authors' postoperative management regimen. The three-dimensional positions of the condyles were evaluated by cone-beam computerized tomography (CBCT) at pre-op, post-op, and at follow-up. CBCT images were referenced to assess the condylar axis change and the anteroposterior condylar position in the glenoid fossa. A repeated-measures analysis of variance (P<0.05) also was performed. RESULTS After surgery, both the axial condylar angles and the anteroposterior condylar position were significantly different (P<0.05). The coronal condylar axis rotated outwardly. The anteroposterior condylar position in the glenoid fossa had moved from the concentric to the anterior position. But the condyle changes between post-op and follow-up (P>0.05) were insignificant. CONCLUSIONS With postoperative intermaxillary elastic traction, the condyles changed their positions physiologically for newly established jaw movement after IVRO.","Huang, Luo; Tang, Shan; Zou, Rui; Ouyang, Kexiong; Piao, Zhengguo; Huang, Luo; Tang, Shan; Zou, Rui; Ouyang, Kexiong; Piao, Zhengguo","Journal of stomatology, oral and maxillofacial surgery",189,31

METHODS On May 28th, 2015, the first patient of imported MERS to China was admitted to Department of Critical Care Medicine of Huizhou Municipal Central Hospital. The clinical features and treatments of this patient were analyzed. RESULTS (1) A 43 years old male of South Korean nationality was admitted with the complaint of back ache for 7 days and fever 2 days with the following characteristics: back ache 7 days ago, without fever or cough or expectoration. He had been suspected to suffer from infection of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus ( MERS-CoV ) by the Disease Control Department of South Korea, but no specific treatment was given. He had fever for 2 days with maximum body temperature of 39.7 centigrade. He had no chills, cough, expectoration, short of breath, abdominal pain, diarrhea, frequent micturition, or urgency or pain of urination, and no sore throat. The patient had a history of exposure to MERS-CoV patient. He was considered to be a patient of the second batch of South Korean epidemic. (2) Auxiliary examination: 3 copies of throat swab specimens for virus nucleic acid detection were performed by the Disease Prevention Control Center of China ( China CDC ), and they were positive on May 29th, 2015, and also for serum, sputum and stool. Based on the results of whole genome sequence analysis, the virus strains were implicated to be derived from Riyahh and Jeddah regions of Saudi Arabia. On admission, the patient's blood test showed that the white blood cell count was low ( 3.22×10(9)/L ), the proportion of the neutrophils was high ( 0.73 ), and that of the platelet was low ( 81×10(9)/L ). On admission, the patient's chest X-ray showed that a small amount of infiltration in the lung. (3) TREATMENT: a high-flow nasal cannula ( HFNC ) with oxygen concentration of 0.50-0.80 was given, with a flow rate was set at 60 L/min if tolerated. It was changed to a low flow oxygen inhalation nasal cannula on the 20th day, and oxygen treatment was stopped on the 24th day. Ribavirin 2.0 g was given as the first dose, and was switched to 600 mg every 8 h ( q8h ), and it was reduced to 600 mg q12h after 10 days, and extenuated since the 13th day. Ceftriaxone was added on the 4th day with 2.0 g a day , and it was changed to meropenem 2.0 g, q8h on the 7th day for 2 weeks. Gamma globulin was given for 7 days ( 20 g, qd ). Thymosin-α1 was given on the 8th day for 2 weeks. Interferon was given once a week, but only one dose was used. At the same time symptomatic treatment such as methimazole and liver protection therapy were given. (4) Patient began to cough at admission, and it disappeared on the 18th day. There was no sputum at first, then a small amount of sputum with a little blood appeared after the admission. Then there was cough without sputum. Mild shortness of breath and diarrhea after exertion were noticed. He had no chest pain, difficulty in breathing or other symptoms. There was dullness on percussion in both sides of chest, and it disappeared gradually. Fine moist rales were detectable in scapular area and interscapular area on the 5th day, and they disappeared after 3 days. Breath sounds on both sides was weak, and it became more obvious in the right lung after 5 days, and returned to normal after 18 days. He had a sustaining fever for 1 week with the maximum temperature of 39.5 centigrade, then the body temperature returned to normal. The viral nucleic acid test as performed by the Center for Disease Control of Guangdong ( CDC, Guangdong ) showed that the pharyngeal swab cultured turned negative on the 3rd day, that of serum specimens turned negative on the 8th day, that of stool specimen after 2 weeks, and it was persistently positive for sputum culture until 5 days before discharge. The oxygenation index gradually increased, and it was over 300 mmHg ( 1 mmHg = 0.133 kPa ) after 15 days. Pleural effusion was rapidly increased during the first week as shown by chest X-ray films, and it began to be absorbed gradually in the second week, but it was not completely absorbed until discharge. CONCLUSIONS The disease course of the reported patient was short, with an acute onset, with fever as the chief complaint, but there were no respiratory symptoms, though there were high fever, cough, shortness of breath, diarrhea and other clinical symptoms after admission. Virus in sputum disappeared after treatment, but pleural effusion was not completely absorbed. Negative test for virus in sputum was late, indicating that clearance of virus was slow from the lungs. It is the first case of MERS in China, therefore, the clinical manifestations and the treatment strategy need to be further explored.","Ling, Yun; Qu, Rong; Luo, Yufeng",Zhonghua wei zhong bing ji jiu yi xue,189,16

We compared the clinical outcomes between antiplatelet responders and nonresponders based on the results of the VerifyNow (VN) testing method. METHODS This is a retrospective single-center analysis of all consecutive patients who underwent NI stenting procedures from January 2007 through July 2013 and had documented preprocedural aspirin (ASA) and clopidogrel VN assays. Patients were divided into two groups based on their responsiveness to antiplatelet. Baseline characteristics, good functional outcome measured by the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) at 90 days, combined procedural complication rate defined as postprocedural stroke, in-stent thrombosis, and intraoperative rupture were compared between the two groups. RESULTS Our cohort included 37 patients: 26 were in the responder group (RG) and 11 were in the nonresponder group (NRG). Baseline characteristics were similar between the two groups. Even though the combined complication rate was similar between the two groups [NRG: 2/11 (18%) vs. RG: 2/26 (7%); p = 0.33], there was a trend for a higher rate of good functional outcome (90-day mRS: 0-2) in the RG (22/22, 100%) as compared to the NRG (8/10, 80%) (p = 0.0907). CONCLUSION Overall, utilizing the VN antiplatelet function testing did not significantly change the clinical outcome after the NI procedures. Larger randomized trials are warranted to provide a better understanding of the utility of the antiplatelet testing in NI stenting procedures.","Kass-Hout, Tareq; Alderazi, Yazan J; Amuluru, Krishna; Jin, Peter; Ayala, Carlos; Prestigiacomo, Charles; Gandhi, Chirag D",Interventional neurology,189,26

Although current standards of care give mutation-positive (index) patients the responsibility of sharing genetic risk information with relatives, the communication is suboptimal, limited largely to close relatives. We developed FamilyCONNECT, a provider-mediated, patient-navigated online tool to facilitate family outreach, and assessed its feasibility, usability and acceptability. METHODS (1) Development of the FamilyCONNECT prototype; (2) testing using online surveys of: (a) members of Lynch Syndrome (LS) International (LSI); (b) genetics service providers; and (3) hands-on testing with patients with LS. RESULTS (1) FamilyCONNECT's features include introductory email to elicit participation, informational website/video, identity authentication/account creation, informed consent, sharing of genetic test results, pedigree expansion and process to invite at-risk relatives. (2a) 33% of the 170 LSI participants completed the survey. FamilyCONNECT's features received favourable responses from at least 79% of respondents. Unfavourable responses were for length of the consent document and mistrust of opening emailed links. (2b) Thirty-five genetics professionals responded to the providers' survey. Key perceived barriers to FamilyCONNECT's usage were privacy/confidentiality (83%), a lack of institutional resources (76%), a defined process (66%) and time (69%). (3) Ten patients navigated data collection fields and provided feedback for improvements. CONCLUSION FamilyCONNECT tool's content and features were well received among patients with LS as well as providers. The tool could be a viable alternative to increase family outreach among patients with LS. Future efforts will focus on refining FamilyCONNECT and assessing its uptake and utilisation by patients with LS.","Pande, Mala; Peterson, Susan; Lynch, Patrick M",Journal of medical genetics,189,1

Design, Setting, and Participants Retrospective cohort study of 201 patients with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia admitted to Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital in China between December 25, 2019, and January 26, 2020. The final date of follow-up was February 13, 2020. Exposures Confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia. Main Outcomes and Measures The development of ARDS and death. Epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory, management, treatment, and outcome data were also collected and analyzed. Results Of 201 patients, the median age was 51 years (interquartile range, 43-60 years), and 128 (63.7%) patients were men. Eighty-four patients (41.8%) developed ARDS, and of those 84 patients, 44 (52.4%) died. In those who developed ARDS, compared with those who did not, more patients presented with dyspnea (50 of 84 [59.5%] patients and 30 of 117 [25.6%] patients, respectively [difference, 33.9%; 95% CI, 19.7%-48.1%]) and had comorbidities such as hypertension (23 of 84 [27.4%] patients and 16 of 117 [13.7%] patients, respectively [difference, 13.7%; 95% CI, 1.3%-26.1%]) and diabetes (16 of 84 [19.0%] patients and 6 of 117 [5.1%] patients, respectively [difference, 13.9%; 95% CI, 3.6%-24.2%]). In bivariate Cox regression analysis, risk factors associated with the development of ARDS and progression from ARDS to death included older age (hazard ratio [HR], 3.26; 95% CI 2.08-5.11; and HR, 6.17; 95% CI, 3.26-11.67, respectively), neutrophilia (HR, 1.14; 95% CI, 1.09-1.19; and HR, 1.08; 95% CI, 1.01-1.17, respectively), and organ and coagulation dysfunction (eg, higher lactate dehydrogenase [HR, 1.61; 95% CI, 1.44-1.79; and HR, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.11-1.52, respectively] and D-dimer [HR, 1.03; 95% CI, 1.01-1.04; and HR, 1.02; 95% CI, 1.01-1.04, respectively]). High fever (≥39 °C) was associated with higher likelihood of ARDS development (HR, 1.77; 95% CI, 1.11-2.84) and lower likelihood of death (HR, 0.41; 95% CI, 0.21-0.82). Among patients with ARDS, treatment with methylprednisolone decreased the risk of death (HR, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.20-0.72). Conclusions and Relevance Older age was associated with greater risk of development of ARDS and death likely owing to less rigorous immune response. Although high fever was associated with the development of ARDS, it was also associated with better outcomes among patients with ARDS. Moreover, treatment with methylprednisolone may be beneficial for patients who develop ARDS.","Wu, Chaomin; Chen, Xiaoyan; Cai, Yanping; Xia, Jia'an; Zhou, Xing; Xu, Sha; Huang, Hanping; Zhang, Li; Zhou, Xia; Du, Chunling; Zhang, Yuye; Song, Juan; Wang, Sijiao; Chao, Yencheng; Yang, Zeyong; Xu, Jie; Zhou, Xin; Chen, Dechang; Xiong, Weining; Xu, Lei; Zhou, Feng; Jiang, Jinjun; Bai, Chunxue; Zheng, Junhua; Song, Yuanlin",JAMA internal medicine,189,5

A wide variety of lightweight mesh models are currently available on the market to overcome some of these problems showing good preliminary results, but no data representing the medium- or long-term results. The present study aims to report the clinical outcomes of two institutional series of patients who underwent hernia repair using a partially absorbable auto adherent mesh (Parietene™ Progrip™--PP). METHODS A prospective analysis was performed including unselected patients with primary groin hernia who underwent a standardized Lichtenstein procedure using the PP mesh at two tertiary institutions. RESULTS During the 2-year study period, 181 patients (167 males; 14 females) with a median age of 63 years (19-85 years) were operated on at both centers. Short-term complications occurred in 27 patients (15%), the most commonly seen being urinary retention (6%) followed by hematoma (5%) and acute orchitis (2%). With a median follow-up of 17 months (12-29 months), 4 patients (2%) had a feeling of a foreign body in the groin, and 7 (4%) developed chronic pain. A total of four patients (2%) developed recurrence. CONCLUSIONS In our experience, the use of the PP mesh for hernioplasties offers a potential benefit not only in the short-term period but also in a medium-term follow-up with low recurrence and late chronic pain rates. However, this particular mesh does not fully prevent all complications and chronic pain and recurrent hernias have been reported for the first time.","Pedano, Nicolás; Pastor, Carlos; Arredondo, Jorge; Poveda, Ignacio; Ruiz, Jaime; Montón, Soledad; Molina, María; Hernández-Lizoain, José Luis",Langenbeck's archives of surgery,189,17

Providing family interventions is hampered by patient resistance, social stigma, logistics and factors related to the capacity of the treatment programmes. AIMS The purpose of the study was to examine the association between family engagement in treatment, and opioid use defined by percentage negative opioid screen and rate retention in treatment defined by completion of study period. METHODS Data from a 16-week outpatient randomised controlled trial (RCT) of 141 adults with opioid use disorder (OUD) receiving Opioid Assisted Treatment (OAT) using buprenorphine/naloxone film (BUP/NX-F) was, used to examine the association between family engagement in and opioid use and rate of retention in treatment. Multiple logistic regression was, applied to examine the independent prediction of family engagement on opioid use and rate retention in treatment. RESULTS Family engagement was significantly associated with retention in treatment (Spearman's rho 0.25, p < 0.01) and was subsequently found to increase the likelihood of retention in treatment by approximately 3-fold (adjusted odds ratio (OR) 2.95, 95% CI 1.31-6.65). CONCLUSION Family engagement in treatment is an independent predictor of retention in treatment but not opioid use in adults receiving OAT. It is, recommended that SUD treatment programmes integrate family related interventions in mainstream treatment. Delivering a personalised multicomponent family programme using digitised virtual communications that has been increasingly utilised during the Covid-19 pandemic is highly suggested.","Al Ghafri, Hamad; Hasan, Nael; Elarabi, Hesham Farouk; Radwan, Doa; Shawky, Mansour; Al Mamari, Samya; Abdelgawad, Tarek; El Rashid, Abuelgasim; Kodera, Ayman; Al Kathiri, Helal; Lee, Amanda J; Wanigaratne, Shamil",The International journal of social psychiatry,189,1

Sulfur reduction can effectively reduce soluble selenite in large quantities to nontoxic solid elemental selenium, which plays a significant role in controlling the toxicity and cycle of selenium. In view of the bright prospects of the sulfur reduction reaction of selenite, this review comprehensively summarizes the continuous development in the sulfidation of selenite. First, the geochemical characteristics of aqueous selenium in different sulfur systems involving species distribution and various phase types at Eh-pH conditions were summarized. Second, sulfur reductions of selenite with chemical sulfide in natural water environments, sulfur reductase and extracellular polymer substances containing thiol groups in sulfate-reducing bacteria have been reviewed to further understand the corresponding mechanisms, rates and influencing factors. Furthermore, applications of sulfur reduction of selenium, including removal of selenium, enrichment of selenium, synthesis of selenoproteins and prevention of leakage of selenium, were also summarized. Finally, this review identified future research needs for the sulfidation of selenite for environmental applications.","Xiong, Jiaming; Wang, Hainan; Yao, Jinni; He, Qiang; Ma, Jun; Yang, Jingjing; Liu, Caihong; Chen, Yao; Huangfu, Xiaoliu; Liu, Hongxia",Journal of hazardous materials,189,0

This study was conducted to investigate the safety and feasibility of laparoscopic total pancreatectomy. PATIENTS AND METHODS Three patients underwent laparoscopic total pancreatectomy between May 2014 and August 2015. We reviewed their general demographic data, perioperative details, and short-term outcomes. General morbidity was assessed using Clavien-Dindo classification and delayed gastric emptying (DGE) was evaluated by International Study Group of Pancreatic Surgery (ISGPS) definition. DIAGNOSIS AND OUTCOMES The indications for laparoscopic total pancreatectomy were intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) (n = 2) and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor (PNET) (n = 1). All patients underwent laparoscopic pylorus and spleen-preserving total pancreatectomy, the mean operative time was 490 minutes (range 450-540 minutes), the mean estimated blood loss was 266 mL (range 100-400 minutes); 2 patients suffered from postoperative complication. All the patients recovered uneventfully with conservative treatment and discharged with a mean hospital stay 18 days (range 8-24 days). The short-term (from 108 to 600 days) follow up demonstrated 3 patients had normal and consistent glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) level with acceptable quality of life. LESSONS Laparoscopic total pancreatectomy is feasible and safe in selected patients and pylorus and spleen preserving technique should be considered. Further prospective randomized studies are needed to obtain a comprehensive understanding the role of laparoscopic technique in total pancreatectomy.","Wang, Xin; Li, Yongbin; Cai, Yunqiang; Liu, Xubao; Peng, Bing",Medicine,189,16

Production and productivity increased through the progress of agro-industrialization, but risks to the environment and health were not taken into account. Over time, several cases of environmental contamination and public health problems, poisoning of rural workers, and food residues were observed. These factors triggered the recognition of risks arising from pesticide abuse. This study aimed to characterize pesticide poisonings reported to a toxicological information center of the state of Goiás through a retrospective analysis from 2005 to 2015. Data were mapped and tabulated by the purpose of pesticides, the circumstance of poisoning, and case development. The poisoning profile pointed to a higher occurrence of work- and suicide-related poisonings, with a predominance of poisoned patients, although chronic effects were not recorded, suggesting a false diagnosis of cure.","Neves, Pedro Dias Mangolini; Mendonça, Marcelo Rodrigues; Bellini, Marcella; Pôssas, Isabela Braichi",Ciencia & saude coletiva,189,31

Prospective epidemiologic studies report that up to 80% of childhood exacerbations are associated with viral upper respiratory tract infections. MATERIALS AND METHODS The study group consisted of 104 children with asthma aged 3-17 years who received treatment for asthma exacerbations in our clinic between September 2009 and 2010. Nasopharyngeal and nasal swabs were obtained from all patients during an acute attack, and from the control group (31 subjects). These specimens were investigated for the presence of viral respiratory pathogens using a real-time multiplex PCR method. The patients were compared for the presence of respiratory pathogens and factors related to the severity of the asthma exacerbation. RESULTS A pathogenic respiratory virus was detected in 53.8% of patients in the acute exacerbation group. The most commonly encountered viral agent was Rhinovirus (35.6%). Patients who had an acute exacerbation with or without a detectable viral pathogen were compared according to the severity of the exacerbation, the need for systemic steroids, and hospitalization rates. No statistically significant difference was found. CONCLUSION Although viral upper respiratory tract infections are the most common cause of asthma exacerbations, the severity level of the exacerbation seems to be independent of whether a respiratory virus has been detected.","Ozcan, Celal; Toyran, Müge; Civelek, Ersoy; Erkoçoğlu, Mustafa; Altaş, Ayşe Başak; Albayrak, Nurhan; Korukluoğlu, Gülay; Kocabaş, Can Naci",The Journal of asthma : official journal of the Association for the Care of Asthma,189,31

A major pathological characteristic for DM is the apoptosis of endothelial cells (ECs) induced by high glucose (HG), however, the function of circRNA in the ECs' phenotypes is still elusive. Here, this study identified an up-regulated circRNA (circVEGFC) in the HG-induced human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Functionally, knockdown of circVEGFC alleviated the apoptosis and recovered the proliferation in HUVECs induced by HG administration. Mechanistically, circVEGFC functioned as the sponge of miR-338-3p, and miR-338-3p was found to target the 3'-Untranslated Regions (3'-UTR) of hypoxia inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF-1α). HIF-1α, a critical transcription factor in DM, could activate the transcription of vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) and promote its protein product. In conclusion, these findings reveal the promotion of circVEGFC/miR-338-3p/HIF-1α/VEGFA axis in the HG-induced ECs' apoptosis, providing a potential treatment strategy for ECs' damage in DM.","Wei, Hua; Cao, Cong; Wei, Xiaojuan; Meng, Minglv; Wu, Biaoliang; Meng, Lianxin; Wei, Xi; Gu, Shixing; Li, Hongmian",Aging,189,7

OBJECTIVE To investigate possible associations between aneurysm hemodynamic and geometric characteristics and the development of blebs in intracranial aneurysms. METHODS A total of 270 IAs in 199 patients selected for surgical clipping were studied. Blebs were visually identified and interactively marked on patient-specific vascular models constructed from presurgical images. Blebs were then deleted from the vascular reconstruction to approximate the aneurysm before bleb formation. Computational fluid dynamics studies were performed in these models and in cases without blebs. Hemodynamic and geometric characteristics of aneurysms with and without blebs were compared. RESULTS A total of 173 aneurysms had no blebs, while 97 aneurysms had a total of 122 blebs. Aneurysms favoring bleb formation had stronger (p<0.0001) and more concentrated inflow jets (p<0.0001), higher flow velocity (p=0.0061), more complex (p<0.0001) and unstable (p=0.0157) flow patterns, larger maximum wall shear stress (WSS; p<0.0001), more concentrated (p=0.0005) and oscillatory (p=0.0004) WSS distribution, and a more heterogeneous WSS field (p<0.0001), than aneurysms without blebs. They were also larger (p<0.0001), more elongated (p<0.0001), had wider necks (p=0.0002), and more distorted and irregular shapes (p<0.0001). CONCLUSIONS Strong and concentrated inflow jets, high-speed, complex, and unstable flow patterns, and concentrated, oscillatory, and heterogeneous WSS patterns favor the formation of blebs in IAs. Blebs are more likely to form in large, elongated, and irregularly shaped aneurysms. These adverse characteristics could be considered signs of aneurysm instability when evaluating aneurysms for conservative observation or treatment.","Salimi Ashkezari, Seyedeh Fatemeh; Mut, Fernando; Chung, Bong Jae; Robertson, Anne M; Cebral, Juan R",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,189,31

The aim of this study was to compare the effect of nonfixation of mesh with fixation in laparoscopic TEP inguinal hernia repair in a rural hospital in India. METHODS One hundred four patients were randomized to mesh nonfixation group or a fixation group during TEP. The postoperative pain scores on a visual analog scale (VAS) at 24 h, 1 week, 1 month, and 1 year, urinary retention, seroma formation, length of hospital stay, days taken to resume normal activities, and recurrence after 2 years were analyzed. The trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov (ID: NCT01117337). RESULTS One hundred four patients (194 hernias) were randomized to mesh nonfixation or fixation. The pain scores at 24 h were comparable (Fix, 1.31 ± 0.4; Nonfix, 1.42 ± 0.5, P = 0.23). The length of hospital stay (Fix, 1.12 ± 0.3 days; Nonfix, 1.15 ± 0.4 days, P = 0.7) and days taken to resume normal activities (Fix, 7.77 ± 1.3 days; Nonfix, 7.96 ± 1.15 days, P = 0.44) were also similar for both groups. The mean pain scores at 1 week (Fix, 1.25 ± 0.5; Nonfix, 1.34 ± 0.6, P = 0.42), 1 month (Fix, 1.06 ± 0.2; Nonfix, 1.17 ± 0.4, P = 0.12), 1 year (Fix, 1.04 ± 0.2; Nonfix, 1.13 ± 0.4, P = 0.11), and 2 years (Fix, 1.03 ± 0.2; Nonfix, 1.0, P = 0.17) were comparable for both groups. There was no recurrence in either group at a minimum follow-up of 2 years. CONCLUSIONS There was no significant difference between fixation and nonfixation of mesh in TEP inguinal hernia repair with respect to postoperative pain, length of hospital stay, resumption of normal activities, seroma formation, and recurrence rate. Nonfixation of mesh is safe and recommended in TEP inguinal hernia repair when done by an experienced surgeon, even in a rural setting.

Online databases including Medline, PubMed, CINAHL, Scopus, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched, and comparisons were grouped as follows: exclusive human milk (EHM) versus exclusive preterm formula (EPTF), any human milk (HM) versus EPTF, higher versus lower dose HM, and unpasteurised versus pasteurised HM. Experimental and observational studies were pooled separately in meta-analyses. Risk of bias was assessed for each individual study and the GRADE system used to judge the certainty of the findings. Forty-nine studies (with 56 reports) were included, of which 44 could be included in meta-analyses. HM provided a clear protective effect against NEC, with an approximate 4% reduction in incidence. HM also provided a possible reduction in LOS, severe ROP and severe NEC. Particularly for NEC, any volume of HM is better than EPTF, and the higher the dose the greater the protection. Evidence regarding pasteurisation is inconclusive, but it appears to have no effect on some outcomes.

Two specific objectives were to review what the delayed discharge initiatives entailed and identify gaps in the literature in order to inform future work. DESIGN Scoping review. METHODS Electronic databases and websites of government and healthcare organisations were searched for eligible articles. Articles were required to include an initiative that focused on delayed discharge, involve a hospital setting and be published between 1 January 2004 and 16 August 2019. Data were extracted using Microsoft Excel. Following extraction, a policy framework by Doern and Phidd was adapted to organise the included initiatives into categories: (1) information sharing; (2) tools and guidelines; (3) practice changes; (4) infrastructure and finance and (5) other. RESULTS Sixty-six articles were included in this review. The majority of initiatives were categorised as practice change (n=36), followed by information sharing (n=19) and tools and guidelines (n=19). Numerous initiatives incorporated multiple categories. The majority of initiatives were implemented by multidisciplinary teams and resulted in improved outcomes such as reduced length of stay and discharge delays. However, the experiences of patients and families were rarely reported. Included initiatives also lacked important contextual information, which is essential for replicating best practices and scaling up. CONCLUSIONS This scoping review identified a number of initiatives that have been implemented to target delayed discharges. While the majority of initiatives resulted in positive outcomes, delayed discharges remain an international problem. There are significant gaps and limitations in evidence and thus, future work is warranted to develop solutions that have a sustainable impact.","Cadel, Lauren; Guilcher, Sara J T; Kokorelias, Kristina Marie; Sutherland, Jason; Glasby, Jon; Kiran, Tara; Kuluski, Kerry",BMJ open,189,30

Through a synthesis of published and hitherto unpublished findings, gathered from a number of converging research designs and methods, this article provides a comprehensive review and reanalysis of the consequences of self-produced locomotor experience. Specifically, we focus on the role of locomotor experience in changes in social and emotional development, referential gestural communication, wariness of heights, the perception of self-motion, distance perception, spatial search, and spatial coding strategies. Our analysis reveals new insights into the specific processes by which locomotor experience brings about psychological changes. We elaborate these processes and provide new predictions about previously unsuspected links between locomotor experience and psychological function. The research we describe is relevant to our broad understanding of the developmental process, particularly as it pertains to developmental transitions. Although acknowledging the role of genetically mediated developmental changes, our viewpoint is a transactional one in which a single acquisition, in this case the onset of locomotion, sets in motion a family of experiences and processes that in turn mobilize both broad-based and context-specific psychological reorganizations. We conclude that, in infancy, the onset of locomotor experience brings about widespread consequences, and after infancy, can be responsible for an enduring role in development by maintaining and updating existing skills.","Campos, Joseph J; Anderson, David I; Barbu-Roth, Marianne A; Hubbard, Edward M; Hertenstein, Matthew J; Witherington, David",Infancy : the official journal of the International Society on Infant Studies,189,13

The aim of this study was to identify the prognostic lncRNAs and construct an lncRNA signature for PCa diagnosis by the interaction network between lncRNAs and protein-coding genes (PCGs). The differentially expressed lncRNAs (DElncRNAs) and PCGs (DEPCGs) between PCa and normal prostate tissues were screened from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. The DEPCGs were functionally annotated in terms of the enriched pathways. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) of 104 PCa samples identified 15 co-expression modules, of which the Turquoise module was negatively correlated with cancer and included 5 key lncRNAs and 47 PCGs. KEGG pathway analyses of the core 47 PCGs showed significant enrichment in classic PCa-related pathways, and overlapped with the enriched pathways of the DEPCGs. LINC00857, LINC00900, LINC00908, LINC00900, SNHG3 and FENDRR were significantly associated with the survival of PCa and have not been reported previously. Finally, Multivariable Cox regression analysis was used to establish a prognostic risk formula, and the patients were accordingly stratified into the low- and high-risk groups. The latter had significantly worse OS compared to the low-risk group (P < 0.01), and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) of 14-year OS was 0.829. The accuracy of our prediction model was determined by calculating the corresponding concordance index (C-index) and risk curves. In conclusion, we established a 5-lncRNA prognostic signature that provides insights into the biological and clinical relevance of lncRNAs in PCa.","Gong, Xiaoyong; Ning, Bobin",Technology in cancer research & treatment,189,16

Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a non-invasive brain stimulation technique that may be an effective, adjunctive treatment to non-opioid therapies. In this randomized control trial (RCT), we compare adjunctive active versus sham tDCS among patients in a multimodal inpatient pain management program. The primary objectives of the RCT are to improve pain tolerance and subjective pain experience. METHODS AND DESIGN Patients admitted to the Pain Management Program at The Menninger Clinic in Houston, Texas are eligible for this trial. Eighty-four participants will be randomized (1:1) into a single-blind, 2×12 (group×time) controlled trial. A battery-powered direct and constant current stimulator (Soterix Medical Inc. 2014) delivers anodal stimulation over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and cathodal stimulation over the right DLPFC. Active tDCS is applied by supplying a 2mA current for 20min/session over 10 sessions. Participants complete self-report and performance-based assessments on a weekly basis just prior to brain stimulation. Self-report assessments are collected via Chronic Pain Tracker version 3.6, an iPad interfaced application. The performance-based pain tolerance task is completed through the cold presser task. DISCUSSION Interventions with cross-symptomatic therapeutic potential are absolutely essential in the context of CP, in which psychiatric comorbidity is the norm. Modalities that can be used in tandem with evidence-based, non-opioid therapies have the potential to have a synergistic effect, resulting in increased effectiveness of what have been modestly effective treatments to date.","Janice Jimenez-Torres, G; Weinstein, Benjamin L; Walker, Cory R; Christopher Fowler, J; Ashford, Philippa; Borckardt, Jeffrey J; Madan, Alok",Contemporary clinical trials,189,1

Here, we report hematite, an earth-abundant material, to be highly effective and thermally stable to catalyze methane combustion at low temperatures (< 500°C) with a low light-off temperature of 230°C and 100% selectivity to CO2. The reported performance is impressive and comparable to those of precious-metal-based catalysts, with a low apparent activation energy of 17.60 kcal·mol-1. Our theoretical analysis shows that such superior activity stems from a tetra-iron center with an antiferromagnetically coupled iron dimer on the hematite (110) surface, analogous to that of the methanotroph enzyme methane monooxygenase that activates methane at ambient conditions in nature. Isotopic oxygen tracer experiments support a Mars van Krevelen redox mechanism where CH4 is activated by reaction with a hematite surface oxygen first, followed by a catalytic cycle through a molecular-dioxygen-assisted pathway. Surface studies with in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal the evolution of reaction intermediates from a methoxy CH3-O-Fe, to a bridging bidentate formate b-HCOO-Fe, to a monodentate formate m-HCOO-Fe, before CO2 is eventually formed via a combination of thermal hydrogen-atom transfer (HAT) and proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) processes. The elucidation of the reaction mechanism and the intermediate evolutionary profile may allow future development of catalytic syntheses of oxygenated products from CH4 in gas-phase heterogeneous catalysis.","He, Yulian; Guo, Facheng; Yang, Ke R; Heinlein, Jake A; Bamonte, Scott M; Fee, Jared J; Hu, Shu; Suib, Steven L; Haller, Gary L; Batista, Victor S; Pfefferle, Lisa D",Journal of the American Chemical Society,189,16

To characterize the pathogenesis and pathogenicity of BoCV isolates, we used 5 different BoCV strains to inoculate colostrum-deprived calves, ~ 2-5 wk of age. Later, to determine if dual viral infection would potentiate pathogenicity of BoCV, calves were inoculated with BoCV alone, bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) alone, or a series of dual-infection (BVDV-BoCV) schemes. A negative control group was included in all studies. Clinical signs and body temperature were monitored during the study and samples collected for lymphocyte counts, virus isolation, and serology. During autopsy, gross lesions were recorded and fixed tissues collected for histopathology and immunohistochemistry; fresh tissues were collected for virus isolation. Results suggest increased pathogenicity for isolate BoCV OK 1776. Increased body temperature was found in all virus-inoculated groups. Lung lesions were present in calves in all dual-infection groups; however, lesions were most pronounced in calves inoculated with BVDV followed by BoCV inoculation 6 d later. Lung lesions were consistent with mild-to-moderate interstitial pneumonia, and immunohistochemistry confirmed the presence of BoCV antigen. Our studies demonstrated that BVDV-BoCV dual infection may play an important role in BRD pathogenesis, and timing between infections seems critical to the severity of lesions.","Ridpath, Julia F; Fulton, Robert W; Bauermann, Fernando V; Falkenberg, Shollie M; Welch, Jenny; Confer, Anthony W","Journal of veterinary diagnostic investigation : official publication of the American Association of Veterinary Laboratory Diagnosticians, Inc",189,22

Reports from earlier in the pandemic suggested that patients hospitalized for COVID19 are at particularly high risk for pulmonary embolism (PE). To estimate the incidences of PE during hospitalization for COVID19, we performed a rigorous systematic review of published literature. METHODS We searched for case series, cohort studies and clinical trials from December 1, 2019 to July 13, 2020 that reported the incidence of PE among consecutive patients who were hospitalized for COVID19 in ICUs and in non-ICU hospital wards. To reflect the general population of hospitalized COVID19 patients, we excluded studies in which subject enrollment was linked to the clinical suspicion for venous thromboembolism (VTE). RESULTS Fifty-seven studies were included in the analysis. The combined random effects estimate of PE incidence among all hospitalized COVID19 patients was 7.1% (95% CI: 5.2%, 9.1%). Studies with larger sample sizes reported significantly lower PE incidences than smaller studies (r2 = 0.161, p = 0.036). The PE incidence among studies that included 400 or more patients was 3.0% (95% CI: 1.7%, 4.6%). Among COVID19 patients admitted to ICUs, the combined estimated PE incidence was 13.7% (95% CI: 8.0%, 20.6%). The incidence of ICU-related PE also decreased as the study sample sizes increased. The single largest COVID19 ICU study (n = 2215) disclosed a PE incidence of 2.3% (95% CI: 1.7%, 3.0%). CONCLUSION PE incidences among hospitalized COVID19 patients are much lower than has been previously postulated based on smaller, often biased study reports. The incidence of ""microthrombosis,"" leading to occlusion of microscopic blood vessels, remains unknown.","Gallastegui, Nicolas; Zhou, Jenny Y; Drygalski, Annette von; Barnes, Richard F W; Fernandes, Timothy M; Morris, Timothy A",Clinical and applied thrombosis/hemostasis : official journal of the International Academy of Clinical and Applied Thrombosis/Hemostasis,189,8

There have been limited numbers of cases about the adaptation of NOTES for ventral hernia repairs. Here, we aimed to present two more cases and highlight our technical differences compared with the previously reported instances. PATIENTS AND METHODS Two patients (43 and 46 years old; body mass index of 29 and 30 kg/m(2), respectively) were treated with hybrid transvaginal incisional hernia repairs. Two 5-mm abdominal trocars were used to monitor transvaginal access, adhesiolysis, dissection of the hernia, and tuckering of the mesh. A 15-mm transvaginal trocar was used for scope and mesh introduction into the abdomen. Defects were 3-5 cm in diameter. RESULTS A rigid 5-mm laparoscope was used. The composite synthetic meshes were, respectively, 11 and 13 cm in diameter. These were passed through the vagina without any protection such as a bag or sheath. No conversion or additional port was required. Respective operative times were 120 and 180 minutes, and the patients were discharged uneventfully on the second day. One patient had seroma, which was managed conservatively (aspiration of 20 mL on Day 7). There were no recurrences after 7 and 13 months, respectively. CONCLUSIONS Conventional laparoscopic equipment can be used for hybrid transvaginal incisional hernia repair. An anti-adhesive synthetic mesh can be inserted through the vaginal trocar without protective devices. The main advantage of this technique is to avoid 10-15-mm abdominal trocars, which increase the risk of trocar-site hernias themselves.","Kayaalp, Cuneyt; Yagci, Mehmet Ali; Soyer, Vural",Journal of laparoendoscopic & advanced surgical techniques.

We aimed to assess use of an antiseptic mouthwash as an antibiotic sparing approach to prevent STIs. METHODS We invited people using PrEP who had an STI in the past 24 months to participate in this single-centre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, AB/BA crossover superiority trial at the Institute of Tropical Medicine in Antwerp, Belgium. Using block randomisation (block size eight), participants were assigned (1:1) to first receive Listerine Cool Mint or a placebo mouthwash. They were required to use the study mouthwashes daily and before and after sex for 3 months each and to ask their sexual partners to use the mouthwash before and after sex. Participants were screened every 3 months for syphilis, chlamydia, and gonorrhoea at the oropharynx, anorectum, and urethra. The primary outcome was combined incidence of these STIs during each 3-month period, assessed in the intention-to-treat population, which included all participants who completed at least the first 3-month period. Safety was assessed as a secondary outcome. This trial is registered with Clinicaltrials.gov, NCT03881007. FINDINGS Between April 2, 2019, and March 13, 2020, 343 participants were enrolled: 172 in the Listerine followed by placebo (Listerine-placebo) group and 171 in the placebo followed by Listerine (placebo-Listerine) group. The trial was terminated prematurely because of the COVID-19 pandemic. 151 participants completed the entire study, and 89 completed only the first 3-month period. 31 participants withdrew consent, ten were lost to follow-up, and one acquired HIV. In the Listerine-placebo group, the STI incidence rate was 140·4 per 100 person-years during the Listerine period, and 102·6 per 100 person-years during the placebo period. In the placebo-Listerine arm, the STI incidence rate was 133·9 per 100 person-years during the placebo period, and 147·5 per 100 person-years during the Listerine period. We did not find that Listerine significantly reduced STI incidence (IRR 1·17, 95% CI 0·84-1·64). Numbers of adverse events were not significantly higher than at baseline and were similar while using Listerine and placebo.

In order to both maintain this important relationship to honor its responsibility to society for increasing transparency, SAGES established a Conflict of Interest Task Force (CITF) and charged it with identifying and managing potential conflicts of interest (COI) and limiting bias at the SAGES Annual Scientific Meetings. The CITF developed and implemented a comprehensive process for reporting, evaluating, and managing COI in accordance with (and exceeding) Accreditation Council for Continuing Medical Education guidelines. METHODS From 2011 to 2013, all presenters, moderators, and session chairs received proactive and progressively increasing levels of education regarding the CITF rationale and processes and were required to disclose all relationships with commercial interests. Disclosures were reviewed and discussed by multiple layers of reviewers, including moderators, chairs, and CITF committee members with tiered, prescribed actions in a standardized, uniform fashion. Meeting attendees were surveyed anonymously after the annual meeting regarding perceived bias. The CITF database was then analyzed and compared to the reports of perceived bias to determine whether the implementation of this comprehensive process had been effective. RESULTS In 2011, 68 of 484 presenters (14 %) disclosed relationships with commercial interests. In 2012, 173 of 523 presenters (33.5 %) disclosed relationships, with 49 having prior review (9.4 %), and eight required alteration. In 2013, 190 of 454 presenters disclosed relationships (41.9 %), with 93 presentations receiving prior review (20.4 %), and 20 presentations were altered. From 2008 to 2010, the perceived bias among attendees surveyed was 4.7, 6.2, and 4.4 %; and in 2011-2013, was 2.2, 1.2, and 1.5 %. CONCLUSION It is possible to have a surgical meeting that includes participation of speakers that have industry relationships, and minimize perceived bias.","Stain, Steven C; Schwarz, Erin; Shadduck, Phillip P; Shah, Paresh C; Ross, Sharona B; Hori, Yumi; Sylla, Patricia",Surgical endoscopy,189,31

COVID-19 pandemic affected the diagnosis and management of many diseases including melanoma. In this study, we aimed to provide a review focused on the diagnosis and management of melanoma in the era of COVID-19. A comprehensive search was conducted on PubMed, Web of Science, and Google Scholar databases using the keywords ""melanoma,"", ""coronavirus"", ""COVID 19"" and ""SARS-CoV-2"". The relevant guidelines published by the European Society for Medical Oncology and the National Comprehensive Cancer Network were also included. The current guidelines recommend that surgical interventions for new diagnosis of invasive primary melanoma, patients with postoperative complications, wide resection and sentinel lymph node biopsy for newly diagnosed T3-T4 melanoma, and planned surgical procedures for patients in neo-adjuvant trials should be prioritized. Surgical treatment of T3/T4 melanomas should be prioritized over T1/T2 melanomas except for any melanoma in which large clinical residual lesion is visible. Adjuvant therapies can be postponed for up to 12 weeks depending on the local center circumstances. PD-1 inhibitor monotherapy is recommended for patients starting immunologic therapy. Combination immunotherapy is still considered suitable for patients with higher-risk disease. Encorafenib and binimetinib should be prioritized for patients requiring BRAF targeted therapy due to the lower chance of symptoms mimicking COVID-19 infection.

A wide range of different interfaces is available, but concerns exist about rebreathing. This study evaluated a total face mask with a 2-limb ventilation circuit and separate access for inflow and outflow gas, which was developed to reduce rebreathing. METHODS In a bench test, a standard total face mask (with a single connector to the ventilation circuit) and the modified total face mask were applied to a mannequin connected to an active breathing simulator. A known CO2flow (V̇CO2 ) was delivered to the mannequin's trachea. We tested the following settings: CPAP with the mechanical PEEP valve set at 8 cm H2O (with 60 and 90 L/min continuous flow) and pressure support of 6 and 12 cm H2O (with 2 and 15 L/min flow-by). The settings were tested at simulated breathing frequencies of 15 and 30 breaths/min and with V̇CO2 of 200 and 300 mL/min. The active simulator generated a tidal volume of 500 mL. Airway pressure, air flow, CO2 concentration, and CO2 flow as the product of air flow and CO2 were recorded. RESULTS The mean volume of CO2 rebreathed and the minimum CO2 inspiratory concentration were significantly lower with the modified mask than with the standard mask. The 15 L/min flow-by significantly decreased rebreathing with the DiMax0 mask, whereas it had no effect with the traditional mask. CONCLUSIONS A face mask with a two-limb ventilation circuit and separate access for inflow and outflow gas reduces rebreathing during NIV. The addition of flow-by enhances this effect. Further studies are required to verify the clinical relevance.","Signori, Davide; Bellani, Giacomo; Calcinati, Serena; Grassi, Alice; Patroniti, Nicolò; Foti, Giuseppe",Respiratory care,189,1

Given the lack of mechanistic insights and specific treatment options in patients with acute fulminant hepatitis, we develop a mouse model reflecting a severe acute virus-induced CD8 T cell-mediated hepatitis. Here we show that antigen-specific CD8 T cells induce liver damage in a perforin-dependent manner, yet liver failure is not caused by effector responses targeting virus-infected hepatocytes alone. Additionally, CD8 T cell mediated elimination of cross-presenting liver sinusoidal endothelial cells causes endothelial damage that leads to a dramatically impaired sinusoidal perfusion and indirectly to hepatocyte death.

However, the smaller inner diameter of cuffed endotracheal tubes and, implicitly, the increased endotracheal tube resistance is still a matter of debate. AIMS This in vitro study investigated work of breathing and inspiratory airway pressures in cuffed and uncuffed endotracheal tubes and the impact of pressure support ventilation and automatic tube compensation. METHODS In 5 simulated neonatal and pediatric lung models, the Active Servo Lung 5000 and an intensive care ventilator were used to quantify the differences in work of breathing under spontaneous breathing (with and without pressure support ventilation and automatic tube compensation) between cuffed and uncuffed endotracheal tubes. Additionally, differences in inspiratory airway pressures, measured either proximal or distal of the endotracheal tube, between cuffed and uncuffed endotracheal tubes under mechanical ventilation were investigated. RESULTS Work of breathing was overall 10.27% [95% confidence interval 9.01-11.94] higher with cuffed than with uncuffed endotracheal tubes and was dramatically reduced by 34.19% [95% confidence interval 31.61-35.25] with the application of pressure support. Automatic tube compensation almost diminished work of breathing differences between the 2 endotracheal tube types in nearly all pediatric lung models. Peak inspiratory and mean airway pressures measured at the proximal endotracheal tube end revealed significantly higher values in cuffed than in uncuffed endotracheal tubes. However, these differences measured at the distal end of the endotracheal tube became minimal. CONCLUSION This in vitro study confirmed significant differences in work of breathing and inspiratory pressures between cuffed and uncuffed endotracheal tubes. Work of breathing, however, is almost neutralized by pressure support ventilation with automatic tube compensation and distal inspiratory airway pressures that, from a clinical perspective, are not significantly increased.","Thomas, Jörg; Weiss, Markus; Cannizzaro, Vincenzo; Both, Christian Peter; Schmidt, Alexander Robert",Paediatric anaesthesia,189,1

METHODS During cataract surgery on 114 eyes, one type of IOL was implanted, calculated with the Hill-RBF 2.0 method. The theoretical postoperative refractions were calculated using the Kane and the Pearl-DGS methods and a vergence based formula (Barrett Universal II, BUII). The differences between the manifest and objective postoperative refractions and the predicted refractions were calculated. The percentage of eyes within ±0.5 D and ±1.0 D prediction error (PE), the mean, and the median absolute errors (MAE and MedAE) were also determined. RESULTS The mean age of the patients was 69.48 years; the axial length was between 21.19 and 25.39 mm. The number of eyes within ±0.5/±1.0 D PE was 96/108 (84.21%/94.73%) using the Hill-RBF 2.0 method, 92/107 (80.70%/93.85%) with the Kane method, 91/107 (79.82%/93.85%) with the Pearl-DGS method, and 91/106 (79.82%/92.98%) with the BUII formula, using subjective refraction. With objective refractometric data, PEs were within ±0.5 D in 88 (77.19%), 83 (72.80%), 82 (71.92%), and 80 (70.17%) cases (Hill-RBF, Kane, Pearl-DGS, BUII, respectively). MAE and MedAE were also best with the Hill-RBF 2.0 method (0.3 D; 0.18 D). CONCLUSION Better accuracy of PE might be obtained by the Hill-RBF 2.0 method compared with BUII.

We show that the paranodal domains in MS NAWM are longer on average than control, with Kv1.2 channels dislocated into the paranode. These pathological features are reproduced in a model of chronic meningeal inflammation generated by the injection of lentiviral vectors for the lymphotoxin-α (LTα) and interferon-γ (IFNγ) genes. We show that tumour necrosis factor (TNF), IFNγ, and glutamate can provoke paranodal elongation in cerebellar slice cultures, which could be reversed by an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor blocker. When these changes were inserted into a computational model to simulate axonal conduction, a rapid decrease in velocity was observed, reaching conduction failure in small diameter axons. We suggest that glial cells activated by pro-inflammatory cytokines can produce high levels of glutamate, which triggers paranodal pathology, contributing to axonal damage and conduction deficits.","Gallego-Delgado, Patricia; James, Rachel; Browne, Eleanor; Meng, Joanna; Umashankar, Swetha; Tan, Li; Picon, Carmen; Mazarakis, Nicholas D; Faisal, A Aldo; Howell, Owain W; Reynolds, Richard",PLoS biology,189,24

In the presence of negative controls, 50/50 (100%) prospectively analysed newborn gastric juice specimens were PCR-positive for methanogens, all identified as M. smithii by sequencing. We succeeded in cultivating M. smithii in 35/50 (70%) newborn gastric juice specimens, while 15/50 specimens remained sterile. Further, M. smithii was observed by direct microscopic investigation using fluorescence in situ hybridisation. Multispacer sequence typing found one of seven different genotypes per specimen, these genotypes having all been previously described in adult human stools. Methanobrevibacter smithii is an early inhabitant of the human stomach, colonising the gastric mucosa just after birth, and the mother's gut microbiota is a probable source of colonisation.","Grine, G; Boualam, M A; Drancourt, M",European journal of clinical microbiology & infectious diseases : official publication of the European Society of Clinical Microbiology,189,1

New therapeutic targets are urgently needed to provide better control of NO level during septic shock. In the present study, we investigated the role of HDAC6 in the regulation of NO production and nitrative stress in a mouse model of endotoxin-induced septic shock. HDAC6 deficient mice and a specific HDAC6 inhibitor were utilized in our studies. Our data clearly indicate that HDAC6 is an important mediator of NO production in macrophages. HDAC6 mediates NO production through the regulation of iNOS expression in macrophages. HDAC6 up-regulates iNOS expression in macrophages by modulating STAT1 activation and IRF-1 expression. HDAC6 inhibition potently blocked endotoxin-induced STAT1 activation and iNOS expression in macrophages. Furthermore, HDAC6 contributes to excessive NO production and nitrotyrosine level in the blood and promotes iNOS expression in the lung tissues during septic shock. Our data reveal a novel HDAC6/STAT1/iNOS pathway that mediates excessive NO production and nitrative stress in septic shock.","Wang, Yan; Wang, Ke; Fu, Jian",Frontiers in immunology,189,8

The 1000 U/mL concentration is thus advocated as the optimal dose for preventing catheter bleeding and malfunction. The effect of lower heparin concentrations on further lowering these complications is not known. We compared early TDC outcomes between a non-standard ultra-low (500 U/mL) and standard initial heparin locks (1000 and 5000 U/mL). METHODS This was a retrospective study on prospectively collected data on 238 de novo internal jugular TDCs placed by nephrologists. Cases were categorized into groups 1, 2 and 3, according to initial heparin lock: 500 [n = 30], 1000 [n = 180] and 5000 U/mL [n = 28] respectively. Bleeding and malfunction within 24 h of TDC insertion, 30 days CRI-free catheter survival and the effects of clinical and laboratory factors on bleeding were evaluated. RESULTS Bleeding events were similar in groups 1, 2 and 3 (7 vs 14 vs 13%, respectively, P = 0.61). Malfunction was only seen in group 2 (3.3%). Thirty-day CRI-free catheter survival was comparable (96 vs 98 vs 97%, respectively, P = 0.22), giving a cumulative CRI rate of 0.76/1000 catheter days. All CRIs were staphylococcal. Univariate analysis did not reveal any significant predictors of catheter bleeding. CONCLUSION Immediate TDC bleeding, malfunction and CRI rate are not influenced by heparin lock concentrations ≤5000 U/mL in this low-risk cohort. However this needs to be corroborated in higher risk patients.","Renaud, Claude J; Lim, Eng Kuang; Tho, Samuel J; Yeoh, Lee Ying",Nephrology,189,1

OBJECTIVE To confirm these improved asthma outcomes during COVID -19 and examine potential contributing factors. METHODS In 18,912 pediatric asthma patients treated in the Children's Hospital of Orange County network from 2017-2020, monthly asthma-related encounters, and medication summaries were extracted from electronic health records, PM2.5 air pollution from California Air Resources Board, and influenza like illness from ILINet for the first six months of each year. Changes in outcomes from Jan-Mar to Apr-Jun (post COVID-19 shut-down in 2020) were compared to historical data using GEE analyses for patient outcomes and GLM for pollution exceedance, influenza positive, and telehealth visit rates. RESULTS During COVID-19 we found 78%, 90%, 68% reductions in hospitalization, ED visits, and exacerbations compared to pre COVID-19 2020, significantly greater changes than the same time period 2017 - 2019, and significant reductions in albuterol and ICS usage, p <.05. ED reduction was not seen for African Americans. PM2.5 and influenza rates were also significantly reduced during COVID-19 p<.05. Increased rates in telehealth visits were greater in the publicly insured group when compared to commercially insured. CONCLUSION Our data confirm reduced healthcare utilization and suggest better asthma control during COVID-19, except for African Americans.

We aimed to report our single surgeon experience of the ostioplasty in patients with left main coronary arterial atresia. METHODS From Jul 2018 to Dec 2019, pediatric patients who presented with left main coronary arterial atresia and subsequently underwent surgical coronary ostioplasty were recruited into this retrospective study. Concomitant mitral repair was applied when the regurgitation was moderate or more. RESULTS A total of 9 patients diagnosed as left coronary arterial atresia were included. Mitral regurgitation was found in all of them, including 6 (66.7%) severe and 1 (11.1%) moderate and 2 (22.2%) mild. In addition to ischemic lesions which was found in 7 (77.8%) patients, structural mitral problem was also common (presented in 7 (77.8%) patients). All the patients underwent coronary ostioplasty with autologous pulmonary arterial patch augmenting anterior wall of the neo-ostium. Mean Aortic cross clamp time and CPB time was 88.1 ± 18.9 and 124.6 ± 23.6 min, respectively.

CONCLUSIONS With favorable surgical outcomes, coronary ostioplasty for LMCA atresia may be an option of revascularization. Structural mitral problems presented in majority patients, resulting in the requirement of concomitant mitral repair. However, the optimal technique of mitral repair remains unclear.","Ma, Kai; Qi, Lei; Yuan, Jianhui; Zhang, Benqing; Yuan, Xingang; Fan, Taibing; Mao, Fengqun; Lin, Ye; Wang, Guanxi; Li, Shoujun; Zhang, Tingting; Meng, Hong; Pang, Kunjing",The Canadian journal of cardiology,189,1

We evaluated a variety of anaesthetic regimens in ferrets, namely, alfaxalone at 20, 10 and 5 mg/kg (n = 1, 10 and 9, respectively; intravenously); medetomidine at 20 µg/kg (n = 3; intramuscularly); medetomidine (20 µg/kg, intramuscularly) plus alfaxalone (2.5 mg/kg, intravenously; n = 7); and tramadol (5 mg/kg, intramuscularly) plus alfaxalone (5 mg/kg, intravenously; n = 2). Two animals treated with alfaxalone at 10 mg/kg and 20 mg/kg, respectively, died. At 5 mg/kg alfaxalone produced anaesthesia with a similar onset but a shorter duration of anaesthesia and analgesia than alfaxalone at 10 mg/kg. The medetomidine-alfaxalone combination produced anaesthesia and analgesia of a longer duration than alfaxalone administered alone at 5 mg/kg (P < 0.0001 and P < 0.001, respectively). Under this anaesthetic regimen, there was a progressive decrease in pulse rate during the first 30 min before the pulse rate stabilized. Respiratory parameters were maintained at acceptable levels. When tramadol was administered, all the animals exhibited a strong excitation reaction and in no case was the toe-pinch reflex clearly abolished. Thus, alfaxalone plus medetomidine provided safe and effective anaesthesia in ferrets. Alfaxalone, alone or in combination with tramadol, did not produce satisfactory results for use as an anaesthetic for this species.","Giral, M; García-Olmo, D C; Gómez-Juárez, M; Gómez de Segura, I A",Laboratory animals,189,1

The objective of this study was to highlight 25 cases of unusual frequent urination associated with abnormal sleep and their relation to staying at home for a prolonged period due to the COVID-19 crisis. Methods This retrospective cross-sectional study included 25 patients who complained of frequent urination (> 3 times/hour) and abnormal sleep during the last 4 months (January-April 2020). These patients were evaluated for all possible differential diagnoses. Results All of the patients had frequent urination > 10 times/day and abnormal sleep but had normal kidney function tests and other investigations. None of the patients had been doing any physical activity at home. All of the patients said that both sleep and urination frequency improved after leaving home for a while (eg, to visit friends, walk, or play sports). This improvement occurred within 2 nights of leaving the home; however, the majority of patients improved after the first night. Conclusions ""Home staying syndrome"" is an undefined syndrome of unusual symptoms of abnormal sleep (altering sleep time and duration) and frequent urination > 3 times/hour. This syndrome is associated with staying at home for a long period of time and is easily resolved by doing any activity such as sports or visiting friends. While this syndrome is rare, it may be more prevalent now due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which forces people to stay home for infection prevention.","Hashim, Hashim Talib",The primary care companion for CNS disorders,189,15

This paper describes the synthesis and characterization of mechanically tough zero- or negative-swelling mussel-inspired surgical adhesives based on catechol-modified amphiphilic poly(propylene oxide)-poly(ethylene oxide) block copolymers. The formation, swelling, bulk mechanical, and tissue adhesive properties of the resulting thermosensitive gels were characterized. Catechol oxidation at or below room temperature rapidly resulted in a chemically cross-linked network, with subsequent warming to physiological temperature inducing a thermal hydrophobic transition in the PPO domains and providing a mechanism for volumetric reduction and mechanical toughening. The described approach can be easily adapted for other thermally sensitive block copolymers and cross-linking strategies, representing a general approach that can be employed to control swelling and enhance mechanical properties of polymer hydrogels used in a medical context.","Barrett, Devin G; Bushnell, Grace G; Messersmith, Phillip B",Advanced healthcare materials,189,7

However, it is unknown whether the evolution of selfing commonly precedes the evolution of annuality, or vice versa. Using a 2-year common garden experiment, we asked if the evolution of selfing in the normally perennial Arabidopsis lyrata was accompanied by a shift towards the annual habit. Despite their very recent divergence from obligately outcrossing populations, selfing plants exhibited a 39% decrease in over-winter survival after the first year compared with outcrossing plants. Our data ruled out the most obvious underlying mechanism: differences in reproductive investment in the first year did not explain differences in survival. We conclude that transitions to selfing in perennial A. lyrata may be accompanied by a shift towards annuality, but drivers of the process require further investigation.","Gorman, Courtney E; Steinecke, Christina; van Kleunen, Mark; Dorken, Marcel E; Stift, Marc",Biology letters,189,31

This study aimed to determine the impact of the pandemic on the subjective health status and characteristics of community-dwelling frail older adults by assessing their knowledge of infection, behaviors and negative psychological response. METHODS During October 2019, 720 older adults participated in ""The Otassha Study."" A year after the COVID-19 outbreak, between June 29 and July 31, 2020, a health status questionnaire, comprising questions concerning knowledge about infection, behaviors and psychological responses during the pandemic, was sent to all participants of the health examination in 2019. Respondents were divided into the robust and frail groups, and their responses were compared. RESULTS Although the self-reported health status of the older adults in both groups was worse in 2020 than in 2019, differences were not observed in the degree of deterioration between the groups. Those in the frail group had fewer resources of information related to COVID-19 and had fewer coping behaviors for health maintenance compared with the robust group. CONCLUSION Information gathering and actions aimed at health maintenance tended to be weaker among older adults with frailty, although the influence of COVID-19 on subjective health status did not differ significantly between robust and frail adults. Therefore, robust and frail older adults may need to adopt different countermeasures to prevent worse health during this pandemic.

Understanding the interaction between GNs and cell membranes is vital for learning how to avoid adverse effects and nanomedical applications. To better understand the nature of such perturbations, we performed molecular dynamics simulations to provide molecular details about the molecular mechanism. In this study, we observed two typical interaction states of the GN-membrane systems. Both states have different effects on the cell membrane (lipid density, membrane thickness, and the mobility of phospholipids). Of great interest is that the insertion of GNs could generate a liquid-ordered domain and dramatically reduce the rate of lipid flip-flop. A similar phenomenon could be found in the GN adhesion states. Thus, these results could facilitate molecular-level understanding of the cytotoxicity of nanomaterials and help future studies on designing personalized drugs and therapeutics for diseases.","Zhu, Xiaohong; Li, Na; Huang, Changxiong; Li, Zhen; Fan, Jun",The journal of physical chemistry.

The radical changes are challenging and risk causing significant career disruption to athletes, with subsequent negative psychological effects. Thus, the ways athletes cope with such adversity is of critical importance. The present study aimed to identify athletes' coping profiles using a person-centred approach, based on their reported use of multiple coping strategies in response to the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak, and to compare levels of anxiety, stress appraisals, interpersonal coping strategies, and availability and appreciation of the major sources of support across profiles. A total of 526 French athletes competing at national to elite levels answered an online questionnaire during the lockdown. Latent profile analysis results yielded four distinct coping profiles (i.e., self-reliant, engaged, avoidant, active and social). The MANOVA showed that athletes belonging to the four profiles differed on anxiety, stress appraisals, social support, and interpersonal coping. In particular, avoidant copers reported high levels of anxiety, threat, and uncontrollability, and appeared less able to regulate responses to the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak. Using a person-centred approach, the findings could inform the development of more adequate care, support, and intervention for athletes, especially avoidant copers, who were characterized by the least effective coping skills and resources. Accordingly, stress reappraisal and stress mindset interventions could be promising approaches to effectively manage pandemic-related impact during and after the COVID-19 crisis.","Pété, Emilie; Leprince, Chloé; Lienhart, Noémie; Doron, Julie",European journal of sport science,189,1

METHODS A search was conducted on four databases looking for ongoing medicine randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and non-RCTs registered current through 25-April-2020. All trials assessing medicines on prophylaxis, special populations, assessing non-medicines and convalescent plasma, were excluded. Of each trial, medicines assessed, design, sample size, registration date, study start and study completion dates, and type of patients were registered. RESULTS 106 trials were identified, 62 in Europe and 46 in the USA ─with two conducted in both regions. In Europe 90% of trials were on hospitalized patients, and 70% in the USA (p<0.01). Mean of the estimated time to completion were 7.8 and 13,6 (p<0.001) months for European and USA trials, respectively. Multicenter trials were more frequent in Europe (63%) than in the USA (41%) (p=0.031). Masked RCTs were more frequently run in the USA than in Europe (p<0.001).

The present paper discusses about the quantitative performances of SFC-ELSD compared to HPLC-ELSD, for the determination of plasticizers (ATBC, DEHA, DEHT and TOTM) in PVC tubing used as medical devices. After the development of HPLC-ELSD, both methods were evaluated based on the total error approach using accuracy profile. The results show that HPLC-ELSD was more precise than SFC-ELSD but lower limits of quantitation were obtained by SFC. Hence, HPLC was validated in the ± 10% acceptance limits whereas SFC lacks of accuracy to quantify plasticizers. Finally, both methods were used to determine the composition of plasticized-PVC medical devices. Results demonstrated that SFC and HPLC both hyphenated with ELSD provided similar results.","Lecoeur, Marie; Decaudin, Bertrand; Guillotin, Yoann; Sautou, Valérie; Vaccher, Claude",Journal of chromatography.

METHODS One hundred and ten eyes from 89 patients who received PSTA for macular edema were prospectively enrolled. The extent of anterior migration of triamcinolone acetonide was recorded immediately after the injection. If TA particles were visible in the subtenon space (or subconjunctival space), it was recorded as ""anterior subtenon migration"" (or ""anterior subconjunctival migration""). The correlation between anterior migration of triamcinolone acetonide and severe IOP elevation, which was defined as an increase of 8 mm Hg or more in IOP, was evaluated. RESULTS A total of 159 PSTAs were given to 110 eyes. After PSTA, anterior subtenon migration occurred in 70.4% and anterior subconjunctival migration occurred in 12.0% of injection. Severe IOP elevation occurred in 7.1% of those without anterior migration, in 25.9% of those with anterior subtenon migration, and in 31.6% of those with anterior subconjunctival migration after PSTA (P = .052). Compared to those without anterior migration of triamcinolone acetonide, the hazard ratio for severe IOP elevation was 3.307 in those with anterior subtenon migration (P = .12) and 5.289 in those with anterior subconjunctival migration (P = .042). CONCLUSIONS Anterior migration of triamcinolone acetonide after PSTA predisposes eyes to severe IOP elevation. Careful injection to restrict the triamcinolone particle within the subtenon space and behind the equator may lower the rate of IOP elevation after PSTA.","Yang, Yun-Hsiang; Hsu, Wei-Cherng; Hsieh, Yi-Ting",Current eye research,189,30

In this study, paired DBS and venipuncture samples were tested using two serological assays to evaluate the usability of DBS for the detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Methods Paired samples of DBS and venous serum were collected from 389 volunteers, of whom 75 had a recent PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, and tested for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies against both viral S1 and nucleocapsid protein (NCP) antigens using two ELISAs. Degree of agreement and correlation coefficients between ELISA results based on the two sampling methods were calculated. Results Results of DBS showed almost perfect agreement and high correlations with results from corresponding serum samples in both the S1-based ELISA and the NCP-based ELISA. Conclusions ELISA results derived from DBS showed very high agreement to those obtained with serum, supposing adequate usability and robustness of DBS as sample material for detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. In the near future, large-scale epidemiological screening for antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 will be carried out.

The formation of TAWH is typically from a combination of local tangential shearing forces and a sudden rise in intraabdominal pressures damaging the muscle, fascia, and peritoneum while the skin remains intact. In patients without hollow viscous injuries and gross contamination, these hernias can be repaired safely with mesh in the acute setting simultaneously with pelvic reduction.","Chow, Kevin L; Smith-Singares, Eduardo; Doherty, James",Case reports in surgery,189,1

While EMR systems facilitate improved healthcare delivery, emerging reports suggest potential detrimental effects on clinician well-being. EMR system implementation influences on nurses' work motivation, engagement, satisfaction and well-being (including burnout) are not well understood, nor have they been examined in relation to contextual factors and mechanisms of action. This paper presents a realist review protocol to examine causal explanations to address the question: How, why and under what circumstances does the implementation of a new hospital EMR system or similar technology impact nurses' work motivation, engagement, satisfaction or well-being? METHODS AND ANALYSIS The five-step method for realist review will be used to identify causal relationships, how the relationships work, for whom and under what circumstances: (1) defining the review scope; (2) developing initial program theories; (3) searching the evidence; (4) selecting and appraising the evidence; (5) extracting and synthesising the data. Initial program theories were developed using scoping review findings and qualitative data collected from nurses pre-EMR and post-EMR. Five databases will be systematically searched from 1 January 2000 to 31 October 2021 (APA PsycInfo, CINAHL, Embase, IEEE Xplore and MEDLINE Complete), and forward and backward citation searching, grey literature searching and literature recommended by the research team. Search results will be screened by two research team members. Data extracted will assist in refining program theories to develop a conceptual model that synthesises how work motivation, engagement, satisfaction and well-being may influence, or be influenced by, an EMR implementation. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION The larger project has previously obtained low-risk ethics approval. The review will be published in a peer-reviewed journal and reported as per RAMESES guidelines.

It is conjectured that these obstructive lung diseases may have had more deleterious effects in developing nations during the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. We provide an evidence-based perspective on the relationship between asthma/COPD prevalence and COVID-19 burden, and the impact of comorbid asthma/COPD on selected COVID-19 outcomes and healthcare utilization, with special reference to developing countries. RECENT FINDINGS Developing countries with higher COPD (but not asthma) prevalence appear to have higher COVID-19 related mortality. Patients with asthma (but not COPD) in developing countries may be less likely to acquire COVID-19. Published literature suggests that the overall impact of comorbid asthma or COPD on adverse COVID-19 outcomes may be broadly similar between developed and developing nations. SUMMARY There is paucity of information on interaction between asthma/COPD and COVID-19 in developing countries. Limited data suggest minor differences between developed and developing nations. In view of inadequacies in healthcare preparedness and delivery in several developing countries, there is a need to generate quality evidence to assess impact of obstructive lung diseases and COVID-19 on each other.","Aggarwal, Ashutosh N; Prasad, Kuruswamy Thurai; Muthu, Valliappan",Current opinion in pulmonary medicine,189,12

Requirements for decreased person-to-person contacts during the COVID-19 pandemic accelerated adoption of tele-neuro-ophthalmology. This review highlights the challenges and opportunities with tele-neuro-ophthalmology. RECENT FINDINGS Tele-neuro-ophthalmology programs can be used for triage, diagnostic consultation, and long-term treatment monitoring. Formats include telephone appointments, interprofessional collaborations, remote data interpretation, online asynchronous patient communication, and video visits. Barriers to long-term implementation of tele-neuro-ophthalmology arise from data quality, patient engagement, workflow integration, state and federal regulations, and reimbursement. General neurologists may collaborate with local eye care providers for ophthalmic examination, imaging, and testing to facilitate efficient and effective tele-neuro-ophthalmology consultation.

To resolve this conflict in our hospital, we substituted 'traditional' grand rounds with 'virtual' grand rounds delivered over Zoom, consisting of a local situation report and operational update, followed by a specialty-specific clinical presentation on management of COVID-19. Attendance was greatly increased (mean 384 attendees) compared to traditional grand rounds (mean 44 attendees) and included a diverse audience of medical professionals. Feedback was overwhelmingly positive, with >80% of responders stating that the sessions would or might inform their clinical practice.

Cerebral oximetry is a non-invasive method to detect imbalances in the cerebral oxygen supply/demand-ratio. Low preoperative cerebral oxygen saturation (ScO₂) levels have been associated with postoperative delirium in non-cardiac surgery patients. The present prospective observational study determines the relationship between pre- and intra-operative ScO₂ levels and postoperative delirium in patients undergoing on-pump cardiac surgery. METHODS After approval of the local ethical committee and written informed consent, N = 231 patients scheduled for elective/urgent cardiac surgery were enrolled. Delirium was assessed by the confusion-assessment-method for the intensive care unit (CAM-ICU) on the first three days after surgery. ScO₂ was obtained on the day before surgery, immediately before surgery and throughout the surgical procedure. Preoperative cognitive function, demographic, surgery related, and intra- and post-operative physiological data were registered. RESULTS Patients with delirium had lower pre- and intra-operative ScO₂ readings, were older, had lower mini-mental-status-examination(MMSE) scores, higher additive EuroScore and lower preoperative haemoglobin-levels. The binary logistic regression identified older age, lower MMSE, neurological or psychiatric disease and lower preoperative ScO₂ as independent predictors of postoperative delirium. CONCLUSIONS The presented study shows that a low preoperative ScO₂ is associated with postoperative delirium after on-pump cardiac surgery.","Schoen, Julika; Meyerrose, Joscha; Paarmann, Hauke; Heringlake, Matthias; Hueppe, Michael; Berger, Klaus-Ulrich",Critical care,189,16

This project's goal was to provide essential cognitive and technical skills to healthcare professionals returning to the workforce or reassigned to critical care clinical duties during the COVID-19 pandemic. The plan included the implementation of 4 distance-based simulation training programs, with asynchronous personalized feedback. The courses allowed the acquisition of skills for the complete critical care patient management chain: use of personal protection equipment, use of a high-flow nasal cannula, endotracheal intubation, and prone positioning. Participants logged into the platform, reviewed material, practiced while recording the session, and uploaded the video through the training platform. The expert tutor remotely delivered asynchronous feedback. Participants trained remotely until achieving course approval.

In this study, we investigated the efficacy of an automated 222-nm ultraviolet C (UVC) disinfection device ""Care222™,"" with a motion sensor, for removing bacterial contamination in a shared bathroom. METHODS Two automated UVC devices, deactivated by motion sensors, were mounted on the ceiling of two bathrooms; the emission window of the UVC device was covered in the non-treated bathroom. After irradiation, samples were collected from five surfaces at four time points/day for 5 days, and colony-forming units (CFUs) of aerobic bacteria (AB) were determined. The irradiation time was also measured. RESULTS UVC source deactivation time did not significantly differ between the bathrooms. There was a significant difference in the total AB CFUs between the treated and non-treated bathrooms. In the treated bathroom, the CFUs of AB of the toilet seat, control panel of the electric toilet seat, and top of the toilet paper holder were significantly lower than those of the control. The CFUs of AB at 9:00, 15:00, and 18:00 h in the treated bathroom were significantly lower than those of the control.

Portability and real-time functionalities are major concerns, and, among others, two correlated challenges are the development of an embedded system and the implementation of lightweight signal processing approaches. In this respect, the event-driven nature of the Average Threshold Crossing (ATC) technique, considering its high correlation with the muscle force and the sparsity of its representation, could be an optimal solution.

In spite of clinical manifestations similar to the SARS-CoV epidemic in 2003, affected organs and severity are yet to be defined. Moreover, viral load alterations and viral shielding among different specimens remained scarce. Therefore, clarifying clinical presentations and correlations among viral loads, disease severity, and viral shielding of SARS-CoV-2 infection is crucial in the disease prevention. METHODS The clinical courses of SARS-CoV-2 cases were presented through Gantt charts. Laboratory examinations and reverse-transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reactions (RT-qPCR) among different specimens were tested periodically. Cycle thresholds (CT) were recorded and presented as viral loads. RESULTS From March 2020 to April 2020, four SARS-CoV-2 cases were presented, of which, cases 1 and 2 manifested the symptoms severer than cases 3 and 4, along with higher serum lactate dehydrogenase levels and graded for lymphocytopenia. Case 4 initially exhibited anosmia, but recovered within a short period. Curves of the CT of all the cases, except case 2, concaved upward after prescribing hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and azithromycin. Except for case 4, the CT in most stool specimens remained undetectable; however, none of the cases presented gastrointestinal symptoms. Surprisingly, the CT values of the saliva specimens were inconsistent with those of the nasopharyngeal swabs and sputum. CONCLUSION SARS-CoV-2 manifests various symptoms. Sudden onset of central nervous system symptoms should be considered. The timing of HCQ and azithromycin administration might be a key factor in the viral load reduction. Positive prediction values of RT-qPCR of different specimens should be tested carefully to prevent false-negative results.","Chen, Po-Liang; Hsiao, Yi-Han; Chuang, Chien; Feng, Jia-Yih; Ho, Hsiang-Ling; Lin, Yi-Tsung; Chen, Su-Jung; Huang, Shiang-Fen; Chen, Hsin-Pai; Chou, Teh-Ying; Chen, Yuh-Min; Wang, Fu-Der",Journal of the Chinese Medical Association : JCMA,189,1

METHODS We reviewed the cases of 956 patients who had undergone appendectomy between April 2012 and March 2018 at our facility. Of these patients, 49 had AAM, including 34 who underwent ILA. We examined the safety and effectiveness of ILA by comparing it with laparoscopic appendectomy (LA); specifically, the 34 cases treated with ILA were compared with 477 cases of adult uncomplicated appendicitis treated with LA from the same patient cohort. We then examined the factors associated with not successfully completing the planned nonsurgical treatment and interval before ILA. Patient demographics and clinical variables were reviewed. RESULTS Patients who had undergone ILA had longer operative times than those who had undergone LA (P = .0059), but they also had shorter postoperative hospital stays (P < .001). There were no significant differences in other perioperative variables. Multivariate analysis showed that a ratio of WBC count on day 3 and day 0 from the start of nonsurgical treatment (WBC day3/day0) of 0.906 or higher was significantly associated with not completing the nonsurgical treatment and interval before ILA (P = .045). CONCLUSION A comparison of the procedures found that ILA for AAM was almost as safe and effective as LA for adult uncomplicated appendicitis. The WBC day3/day0 ratio can be an objective parameter to assess the effectiveness of the nonsurgical treatment before ILA earlier in the course of treatment.","Fujihata, Shiro; Kitagami, Hidehiko; Kitayama, Yosuke; Suzuki, Ayumi; Tanaka, Moritsugu; Nakaya, Seiichi; Hayakawa, Shunsuke; Okubo, Tomotaka; Sagawa, Hiroyuki; Tanaka, Tatsuya; Takahashi, Hiroki; Matsuo, Yoichi; Ogawa, Ryo; Takiguchi, Shuji",Asian journal of endoscopic surgery,189,31

Most patients were of pathologic stage IA (76.3%) or IB (10.5%), 3 patients were of stage II, and 2 were of stage IIIA. The length of postoperative hospital stay was 8.3 ± 3.3 days (range, 5 to 20 d). Two cases required reoperation because of internal herniation. According to our endoscopic observation, bile reflux into the gastric remnant stump was not found.

The operating conditions comprised 340-500 °C, retention time of 24-453 s and a stoichiometric oxidant ratio (O.C.) between 4 and 64. The transformation of the various species was determined at the outlet and by modeling a segmented non-isothermal reaction system. Four empirical power law kinetic models were established to represent both the pollutants' degradation and TOC removal efficiencies, using nonlinear multiple regression coupled with bootstrapping and K-fold cross-validation. The mineralization and degradation models for both pollutants yielded a R2 of 67-80.5% vs. the experimental results. Discussion on the various model assumptions revealed that attributing full model deviations to the constant oxygen concentration or to the laminar reactor flow, yielded a deviation of 6% and 15% in the removal efficiencies, respectively. However, the expected deviation of the models was lower than 0.32% at conditions leading to (almost) full mineralization (45-60 s, 480-500 °C and O.C.s of 5-10).

EXPERT OPINION HCQ has been shown by numerous studies over the past 15 years to be efficacious in the treatment of autoimmune diseases, including systemic lupus erythematosus, discoid lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis. HCQ does not appear to be associated with any increased risk of congenital defects, spontaneous abortions, fetal death, prematurity or decreased numbers of live births in patients with autoimmune diseases. Therefore, in the author's opinion, HCQ is safe for the treatment of autoimmune diseases during pregnancy.","Abarientos, Crispin; Sperber, Kirk; Shapiro, Deborah L; Aronow, Wilbert S; Chao, Chun Peng; Ash, Julia Y",Expert opinion on drug safety,189,20

In parallel, there has been a growth in academic research in this area. However, this increase in focus at international level has not necessarily strengthened the capacity to drive evidence-informed national policy and action in many low- and middle-income countries. The Migration Health South Asia (MiHSA) network aims to challenge some of the barriers to progress in the region. Examples include the bias towards institutions in high-income countries for research funding and agenda-setting and the overall lack of policy-focused research in the region. MiHSA will engage researchers, funders and policy-makers in collectively identifying the most pressing, yet feasible, research questions that could help strengthen migrant and refugee health relevant to the region's national contexts. In addition, policies and provisions for different migrant populations in the region will be reviewed from the health and rights perspectives, to identify opportunities to strategically align research agendas with the questions being asked by policy-makers. The convergence of migration policy with other areas such as health and labour at global level has created a growing imperative for policy-makers in the region to engage in cross-sector dialogue to align priorities and coordinate responses. Such responses must go beyond narrow public health interventions and embrace rights-based approaches to address the complex patterns of migration in the region, as well as migrants' precarity, vulnerabilities and agency.","Kapilashrami, Anuj; Wickramage, Kolitha; Asgari-Jirhandeh, Nima; Issac, Anns; Borharde, Anjali; Gurung, Ganesh; Sharma, Jeevan R",WHO South-East Asia journal of public health,189,2

METHODS The likelihood of importation of MERS cases and the magnitude of the public health impact in Singapore were assessed to determine overall risk. Literature on the epidemiology and contextual factors associated with MERS coronavirus infection was collected and reviewed. Connectivity between the Republic of Korea and Singapore was analysed. Public health measures implemented by the two countries were reviewed. RESULTS The epidemiology of the 2015 MERS outbreak in the Republic of Korea remained similar to the MERS outbreaks in Saudi Arabia. In addition, strong infection control and response measures were effective in controlling the outbreak. In view of the air traffic between Singapore and MERS-affected areas, importation of MERS cases into Singapore is possible. Nonetheless, the risk of a serious public health impact to Singapore in the event of an imported case of MERS would be mitigated by its strong health-care system and established infection control practices. DISCUSSION The MERS outbreak was sparked by an exported case from the Middle East, which remains a concern as the reservoir of infection (thought to be camels) continues to exist in the Middle East, and sporadic cases in the community and outbreaks in health-care settings continue to occur there. This risk assessment highlights the need for Singapore to stay vigilant and to continue enhancing core public health capacities to detect and respond to MERS coronavirus.","Zhang, Emma Xuxiao; Oh, Olivia Seen Huey; See, Wanhan; Raj, Pream; James, Lyn; Khan, Kamran; Tey, Jeannie Su Hui",Western Pacific surveillance and response journal : WPSAR,189,1

Over the past decade, numerous prevention strategies have resulted in significant reductions in NI rates. In this review, we aim to provide an overview of current NI rates from large, geographically defined cohorts. METHODS PubMed, Web of Science, EMBASE and Cochrane Library were searched for evidence regarding epidemiology and prevention of NI in neonates. Extracted studies were synthesised in a narrative form with experiential reflection. RESULTS Despite the abundance of geographically defined incidence proportions, an epidemiological overview of NI is difficult to provide, given the lack of consensus definition for neonatal NI and different baseline populations being compared. Successful prevention efforts have focused on implementing evidence-based practices while eliminating outdated strategies. The most promising model for reduction in infection rates is based on quality improvement (QI) collaboratives and benchmarking, involving identification and implementation of best practices, selection of measurable outcomes and fostering a sense of community and transparency. CONCLUSION The preventative rather than curative approach forms the new paradigm for reducing the burden of neonatal infections. Despite progress achieved, continued work towards improved prevention practices is required in the strive towards zero NIs.","Jansen, Sophie J; Lopriore, Enrico; van der Beek, Martha T; Veldkamp, Karin Ellen; Steggerda, Sylke J; Bekker, Vincent",Acta paediatrica,189,24

Some reports proposed that patient selection criteria should be stringent, and pheochromocytoma (PHE) should be taken as an advanced indication. The aim of this study is to compare LESS adrenalectomy (ADX) with conventional adrenalectomy (CL-ADX) in patients with PHE, with attention paid not only to immediate postoperative outcomes but also to the intraoperative hemodynamic changes that occur with each technique. METHODS The records of 265 consecutive patients who underwent laparoscopic ADX at Keio University Hospital in Tokyo from January 2001 to June 2011 were entered into a database. Surgical procedures were performed or supervised by two experienced laparoscopic surgeons, who performed more than 100 cases of urologic laparoscopic surgery in 2011. Twenty consecutive patients who underwent LESS-ADX from December 2009 to October 2011 were compared with patients who underwent CL-ADX (controls, n = 30) to look at differences in hemodynamic parameters and surgical outcomes in a case-control analysis. RESULTS Each group was equivalent with respect to age, sex, and BMI. The mean size of 50 PHE was 45.1 ± 4.0 mm, the mean operative time was 151.8 ± 10.6 min, and there was no significant difference between the two groups. In one case of LESS-ADX, two additional ports were added. There was no significant difference between the CL-ADX and LESS-ADX groups in terms of operation time, total fluid during the operation, estimated blood loss, first oral feeding, postoperative stay in the intensive care unit, or postoperative hospital stay. CONCLUSIONS We consider the safety of LESS-ADX of PHE as similar to that of CL-ADX. With appropriate pre- and intraoperative hemodynamic control and experienced hands, LESS-ADX could become one of the treatments of choice for resection of PHE.","Hattori, Seiya; Miyajima, Akira; Maeda, Takahiro; Hasegawa, Masanori; Takeda, Toshikazu; Kosaka, Takeo; Kikuchi, Eiji; Nakagawa, Ken; Oya, Mototsugu",Surgical endoscopy,189,1

PURPOSE: To prospectively compare the anatomic and clinical outcomes between the vertical simple stitch and the modified Mason-Allen stitch with respect to the labral height, retear rate, redislocation/apprehension, and various functional outcome scores. STUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 2. METHODS: Patients who underwent arthroscopic Bankart repair with double-loaded suture anchors were randomly allocated to 1 of 2 groups: the vertical simple stitch method (SS; n = 45) or the Bankart repair using modified Mason-Allen technique (BRUMA; n = 41). All patients underwent computed tomography arthrography at 6 months postoperatively and various functional outcome measurements at least 2 years postoperatively. The labral height and width at the 3-, 4-, and 5-o'clock positions were measured preoperatively and at 6 months after surgery on axial computed tomography arthrography; the redislocation/apprehension rate, the retear rate, and various functional outcome scores were evaluated at each follow-up visit. RESULTS: Postoperative labral height and width were significantly increased at all locations (all P < .001) in both groups, but they were not statistically different between groups (all P > .05). Two patients in the SS group (4.4%) and 2 in the BRUMA group (4.9%) experienced redislocation after surgery, and 4 patients in the SS group (8.9%) and 2 in the BRUMA group (4.9%) group showed apprehension after surgery. Additionally, 5 patients in the SS group (11.1%) and 2 in the BRUMA group (4.9%) showed retear at 6 months ( P = .239). There were no differences in any functional outcome scores (all P > .05). CONCLUSION: There was no difference in the radiologic outcomes at 6 months and the clinical outcomes assessed at least 2 years after surgery between the groups.","Park, Jin-Young; Chung, Seok Won; Lee, Jong Soo; Oh, Kyung-Soo; Lee, Jae-Hyung",The American journal of sports medicine,189,24

Genetic instability, such as chromosomal instability, is associated with the tumorigenesis of LSCC. Copy number variations (CNVs) have been demonstrated to contribute to the genetic diversity of tumor pathogenesis. Comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) has emerged as a high-throughput genomic technology that facilitates the aggregation of high-resolution data of cancer-associated genomic imbalances. In the present study, a total of 38 primary supraglottic LSCC cases were analyzed by high-resolution array-based CGH (aCGH) to improve the understanding of the genetic alterations in LSCC. Additionally, integration with bioinformatic analysis of microarray expression profiling data from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database provided a fundamental method for the identification of putative target genes. Genomic CNVs were detected in all cases. The size of net genomic imbalances per case ranged between a loss of 682.3 Mb (~24% of the genome) and a gain of 1,958.6 Mb (~69% of the genome). Recurrent gains included 2pter-q22.1, 3q26.1-qter, 5pter-p12, 7p22.3p14.1, 8p12p11.22, 8q24.13q24.3, 11q13.2q13.4, 12pter-p12.2, 18pter-p11.31 and 20p13p12.1, whereas recurrent losses included 3pter-p21.32, 4q28.1-q35.2, 5q13.2-qter, 9pter-p21.3 and monosomy 13. Gains of 3q26.1-qter were associated with tumor stage, poor differentiation and smoking history. Additionally, through integration with bioinformatic analysis of data from the GEO database, putative target oncogenes, including sex-determining region Y-box 2, eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4 gamma 1, fragile X-related gene 1, disheveled segment polarity protein 3, defective n cullin neddylation 1 domain containing 1, insulin like growth factor 2 mRNA binding protein 2 and CCDC26 long non-coding RNA, and tumor suppressor genes, such as CUB and sushi multiple domains 1, cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor 2A, protocadherin 20, serine peptidase inhibitor Kazal type 5 and Nei like DNA glycosylase 3, were identified in supraglottic LSCC. Supraglottic LSCC is a genetically complex tumor type and aCGH was demonstrated to be effective in the determination of molecular profiles with higher resolution. The present results enable the identification of putative target oncogenes and tumor suppressor gene mapping in supraglottic LSCC.","Li, Dongjie; Wang, Xianfu; Lu, Shunfei; Wang, Ping; Wang, Xin; Yin, Wanzhong; Zhu, Wei; Li, Shibo",Oncology letters,189,1

Open or traditional ventral hernia repairs involve the significant morbidity and expense of a laparotomy and a significant risk of recurrent herniation. Laparoscopic ventral hernia repair (LVHR) may offer a less-invasive alternative with shorter length of hospital stay, fewer cardiopulmonary complications, and low recurrence rates. METHODS 225 patients underwent laparoscopic ventral hernia repairs in which carboxymethylcellulose-sodium hyaluronate coating (Sepramesh, Davol, Providence, RI) was used primarily. All cases were included prospectively from the study period of 2002 through 2009. Patient characteristics were recorded, and follow-up analysis was performed over a period of 42 mo following surgery. Recurrence, reoperations, and all complications were recorded. Mesh awareness and mesh-related pain were assessed using the hernia-specific Carolinas Comfort Scale (CCS) instrument, completed by 72 patients. RESULTS Over 42 mo of follow-up, 2 ventral hernias have recurred, and no long-term bowel erosion or fistulization has occurred. Little or no mesh-related symptoms were reported, and mean scores for mesh awareness and mesh pain were 3.6 and 3.2, respectively, on a scale from 0 - 40 (lower scores signify less pain or awareness). Two serious early complications occurred related to intestinal ileus and metal tacks producing intestinal perforation, and this led to a change in the tacking devices used. CONCLUSIONS LVHR with carboxymethylcellulose-sodium hyaluronate coating (Sepramesh) is safe and effective. Complications are rare, the repair is durable, and long-term results are good with rare recurrences, low awareness of mesh, and little pain. Technical lessons include use of at least one transfascial suture and the avoidance of metal tacks for fixation.","Sasse, Kent C; Lim, Dionne C L; Brandt, Jared",JSLS : Journal of the Society of Laparoendoscopic Surgeons,189,5

Serological diagnosis plays an important role in distinguishing pathogen species. Together with the spike (S) protein, the nucleocapsid (N) protein is one of the immunodominant regions among coronaviruses. In this study, two-way antigenic cross-reactivity between the N proteins of PEDV and TGEV was observed by indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) and Western blot analysis. Furthermore, the PEDV N protein harbouring truncations of amino acids (aa) 1 to 170 or aa 125 to 301 was demonstrated to cross-react with the anti-TGEV N polyclonal antibody (PAb), whereas the truncation-expressing aa 302 to 401 resulted in a specific reaction with the anti-PEDV N PAb but not with the anti-TGEV N PAb. Mutants of the PEDV N protein were generated based on sequence alignment and structural analysis; we then confirmed that the N-terminal residues 58-RWRMRRGERIE-68 and 78-LGTGPHAD-85 contributed to the cross-reactivity. All the results provide vital clues for the development of precise diagnostic assays for porcine coronaviruses.","Xie, Wenting; Ao, Chaojie; Yang, Yilin; Liu, Yinan; Liang, Rui; Zeng, Zhe; Ye, Gang; Xiao, Shaobo; Fu, Zhen F; Dong, Wanyu; Peng, Guiqing",The Journal of general virology,189,5

Monitoring of the status of such proteins will be important to track viral pathogenicity. In this study, molecular dynamics approaches were used to investigate MERS CoV Non-Structural Protein 3 (NSP3) specific proteins that resist host innate immunity. MERS CoV papain-like protease (Plpro) was more conformationally flexible than Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoV (SARS) CoV Plpro. This flexibility was evident in either the free form or when bound with ubiquitin. There were marked changes in the root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) in the ubiquitin like domain (Ubl) and the fingers subdomain of the catalytic domain of Plpro. An interesting feature is the dynamic change in Ubl, which shows a rigid conformation in the free form of Plpro but is fully flexible upon the binding of ubiquitin. This increased flexibility could be important for the downstream effects of the interaction with other proteins and the inhibition of the innate immunity. Four major residues involved in deubiquitination, L106, P163, R168 and F265, were conserved in all MERS CoVs and differed from other Beta CoVs. These conserved CoV residues were associated with lower deubiquitinating activity and render MERS CoV Plpro with less potent deubiquitinating potential. The number of residues and total interactions with ubiquitin were lower for the MERS CoV Plpro than for the SARS CoV. These factors contribute to the lower deubiquitinating actions of MERS CoV NSP3 and its subsequently lower interaction with the host immune system.","Alfuwaires, Manal; Altaher, Abdallah; Kandeel, Mahmoud",Biological & pharmaceutical bulletin,189,1

Serum and nasal swab samples were tested for MERS-CoV antibodies andribonucleic acid (RNA) using a recombinant enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (rELISA) and real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), respectively. The overall MERS-CoV antibody seroprevalence was 80.5%, whereas the overall viral RNA prevalence was 2.4%. The associations of risk factors with each prevalence were quantified using univariate and multivariate analyses. The multivariate models identified region, age, grazing system, exposure to wild animals and dung removal as factors significantly associated with seroprevalence (p ??0.05). A higher seroprevalence was more likely to occur in camels from the Riyadh, Eastern, Northern and Makkah regions than those from the Jazan region; camels ??4 and 1-3 years of age (marginally significant) than calves < 1 year; and camels raised in zero grazing and semi-open grazing systems than those raised in an open grazing system. However, the presence of wild animals and daily dung removal were negatively associated with seroprevalence. On the other hand, region and sex were significantly associated with MERS-CoV RNA prevalence(p ??0.05). A higher viral RNA prevalence was more likely to occur in camels from the Riyadh region and Eastern region (marginally significant) than in those from the Makkah region, and in male camels than female camels. In conclusion, the risk factors identified in this study can be considered to be predictors of MERS-CoV infection in camels and should be taken into account when developing an efficient and cost-effective control strategy.","Elfadil, A A; Ahmed, A G; Abdalla, M O; Gumaa, E; Osman, O H; Younis, A E; Al-Hafufi, A N; Saif, L J; Zaki, A; Al-Rumaihi, A; Al-Harbi, N; Kasem, S; Al-Brahim, R H; Al-Sahhaf, A; Bayoumi, F E; Qasim, I A; Abu-Obeida, A; Al-Dowairij, A",Revue scientifique et technique,189,27

The ability to model macroscopic tumor evolution with high fidelity may contribute to better predictive tools for designing tumor therapy in the clinic. However, attempts to model tumor growth have mainly been developed and validated using data from xenograft mouse models, which fail to capture important aspects of tumorigenesis including tumor-initiating events and interactions with the immune system. In the present study, we investigate tumor growth and therapy dynamics in a mouse model of de novo carcinogenesis that closely recapitulates tumor initiation, progression and maintenance in vivo. We show that the rate of tumor growth and the effects of therapy are highly variable and mouse specific using a Gompertz model to describe tumor growth and a two-compartment pharmacokinetic/ pharmacodynamic model to describe the effects of therapy in mice treated with 5-FU. We show that inter-mouse growth variability is considerably larger than intra-mouse variability and that there is a correlation between tumor growth and drug kill rates. Our results show that in vivo tumor growth and regression in a double transgenic mouse model are highly variable both within and between subjects and that mathematical models can be used to capture the overall characteristics of this variability. In order for these models to become useful tools in the design of optimal therapy strategies and ultimately in clinical practice, a subject-specific modelling strategy is necessary, rather than approaches that are based on the average behavior of a given subject population which could provide erroneous results.","Loizides, Charalambos; Iacovides, Demetris; Hadjiandreou, Marios M; Rizki, Gizem; Achilleos, Achilleas; Strati, Katerina; Mitsis, Georgios D",PloS one,189,1

The aims of this study were to develop clinical-grade radiolabeled trastuzumab for clinical HER2/neu immunoPET scintigraphy, to improve diagnostic imaging, to guide antibody-based therapy, and to support early antibody development. The PET radiopharmaceutical (89)Zr-trastuzumab was compared with the SPECT tracer (111)In-trastuzumab, which we have tested in the clinic already. METHODS Trastuzumab was labeled with (89)Zr and (for comparison) with (111)In. The minimal dose of trastuzumab required for optimal small-animal PET imaging and biodistribution was determined with human HER2/neu-positive or -negative tumor xenograft-bearing mice. RESULTS Trastuzumab was efficiently radiolabeled with (89)Zr at a high radiochemical purity and specific activity. The antigen-binding capacity was preserved, and the radiopharmaceutical proved to be stable for up to 7 d in solvent and human serum. Of the tested protein doses, the minimal dose of trastuzumab (100 microg) proved to be optimal for imaging. The comparative biodistribution study showed a higher level of (89)Zr-trastuzumab in HER2/neu-positive tumors than in HER2/neu-negative tumors, especially at day 6 (33.4 +/- 7.6 [mean +/- SEM] vs. 7.1 +/- 0.7 percentage injected dose per gram of tissue).

PATIENTS AND METHODS Patients with histologically confirmed stage III gastric cancer who underwent gastrectomy with D2 lymphadenectomy were randomly assigned to receive adjuvant chemotherapy with either S-1 plus docetaxel or S-1 alone. In the S-1 plus docetaxel group, S-1 was given orally for 2 weeks followed by 1 week of rest for seven courses, and docetaxel was given intravenously on day 1 of the second to seventh courses. The combination therapy was followed by S-1 monotherapy for up to 1 year. RESULTS The 3-year RFS rate of the S-1 plus docetaxel group was 67.7%. This was significantly superior to that of 57.4% in the S-1 group (hazard ratio [HR] 0.715, 95% CI 0.587-0.871, P = 0.0008).

MATERIALS AND METHODS Patients with an unresectable primary renal tumor, with or without distant metastases, received 50 mg sunitinib with continuous daily dosing in a phase II trial. Computerized tomography was performed every 12 weeks to determine surgical resectability. The primary end point of the trial was the percentage of patients with renal cell carcinoma and initially unresectable primary tumors who could undergo nephrectomy after sunitinib therapy. RESULTS Of 30 patients enrolled in the study (19 with distant metastases) 28 (35 total renal tumors) were evaluable for response. The median change in primary renal cell carcinoma tumors was a 22% decrease, corresponding to a median absolute reduction of 1.2 cm. The median reduction in primary renal cell carcinoma tumors of clear cell histology was -28% (absolute reduction 1.7 cm) compared to a 1.4% increase (0.1 cm absolute increase) in nonclear cell tumors. Of these patients 13 (45%) met the primary end point of being able to undergo nephrectomy after preoperative sunitinib. All patients had viable renal cell carcinoma in the surgical specimen and surgical morbidity was consistent with prior experience of nephrectomy in patients without preoperative therapy.

Unless adequate space is maintained below the vessels, there is a risk of causing damage to the back of vessels with the curved tip without optional introducers. The recommended method involves passing silk thread through the back of the pulmonary vessels and ligating the thread to the introducer. However, the long introducer often applies tension to pulmonary vessels and can be caught in the tissues surrounding vessels. Therefore, we devised a new method. First, the introducer is shortened to a length of approximately 3 cm and attached to a curved tip. Second, a Penrose drain is passed through the back of the vessels. Last, the introducer is inserted into the drain and the stapler is guided. The vessels can be cut without removing the introducers and Penrose drains from staplers.","Mizutani, Eiki; Nakahara, Kazuki; Miyanaga, Shigeki; Seike, Ayako",General thoracic and cardiovascular surgery,189,29

Access to medical consultation became a challenge; hospitals were flooded with cases beyond their capacity and transport was halted due to lockdown. Global Health Directorate of The Indus Health Network supported the provincial government by rolling out several walk-in community-based testing initiatives across Karachi. Results were conveyed to the patients through each district government. With a disproportionate rise in cases, an increasing delay in reporting results was observed. Methods: To help the district government bridge this gap, two physicians were engaged to convey timely results to patients who tested positive, through a helpline. Subsequently, proactive teleconsultation was initiated. We present a retrospective review of data collected during teleconsultation for COVID-19 cases identified through community-based testing between April 5 and June 10, 2020. Results: A total of 4,279 tests were conducted, revealing a 28% positivity rate (1,196 cases). Out of these, 752 (62.9%) baseline positive patients were contactable. Most patients identified either a close contact (46.8%) or a household contact (30.1%) as the source of infection. 41.8% patients were asymptomatic, 52.9% had mild to moderate illness, and 1.1% needed referral to the emergency department. 82.7% patients reported no comorbidities. Conclusion: The rapid surge of cases could not be handled by a small team and an institutional strategy of integration into an existing call center service was adopted. We share our insights to help develop evidence-based policies to effectively tackle current or future threats in similar settings.","Moosa, Shazia; Shah, Sabeen; Mohiuddin, Amal Fatima; Haider, Kaniz Farwa; Khowaja, Saira",Telemedicine journal and e-health : the official journal of the American Telemedicine Association,189,1

These opportunities create a ""double-edge sword"" as the ethical governance of such approaches often lag behind technological achievements. OBJECTIVE The aim was to investigate ethical issues identified from utilizing AI-augmented surveillance or early warning systems to monitor and detect common or novel ID outbreaks. METHODS We searched relevant articles in a number of databases that addressed ethical issues of using artificial intelligence, digital surveillance systems, early warning systems and/or big data analytics technology for detecting, monitoring, or tracing ID according to PRISMA guidelines, and further identified and analysed them with a theoretical framework. RESULTS This systematic review identified 29 articles presented in six major themes clustered under individual, organizational and societal levels, including: awareness of implementing digital surveillance, digital integrity, trust, privacy and confidentiality, civil rights, and governance. Whilst these measures were understandable during a pandemic, the public were concerned about receiving inadequate information, unclear governance frameworks, and lack of privacy protection, data integrity and autonomy when utilizing ID digital surveillance. The barriers to engagement could widen existing healthcare disparities or digital divides by underrepresenting vulnerable and at-risk populations, and expose patients' highly sensitive data such as their movements and contacts to outside sources, impinging significantly upon basic human and civil rights. CONCLUSIONS Our findings inform ethical considerations for service delivery models for medical practitioners and policymakers implicated in the use of digital surveillance for ID spread and a basis for the global governance structure.

METHODS We reviewed the medical charts of four cases of corneal endotheliitis that were CMV-positive. We have classified types of clinical phenomenon into four types: coin-shaped KPs, sectoral corneal edema with or without Khodadoust line-like KPs, mutton-fat KPs, and fine KPs and have graded their severity. We also determined the copy numbers of the DNA of CMV in the aqueous humor by real-time polymerase chain reaction before and during the treatment. We evaluated the correlation between the patterns of clinical characteristics and copy number of the DNA of CMV. RESULTS There were clinical improvements in all eyes following topical ganciclovir in conjunction with low dose of topical steroid treatment, with or without oral valganciclovir. The clinical characteristics and the copy numbers of the DNA of CMV varied during the treatment period. The presence of coin-shaped KPs was correlated with high copy numbers (105-103 copies/ml) of the DNA of CMV. The copy numbers of the DNA of CMV with sectoral corneal edema with or without Khodadoust line-like KPs ranged from 104 to 102 copies/ml, and it was occasionally accompanied by high intraocular pressure. Mutton-fat KPs were observed inferiorly, sometimes together with coin-shaped KPs and sectoral corneal edema, or solely. The copy numbers in eyes with mutton-fat KPs varied and occasionally less than the cutoff level. Fine-pigmented KPs were observed after the resolution of the endotheliitis, and no DNA of CMV was detected in the aqueous humor. CONCLUSIONS Careful observations of the clinical characteristics such as the KPs and corneal edema might be helpful in estimating the amount of the DNA of CMV in eyes with corneal endotheliitis.","Yoshimura, Ayano; Araki-Sasaki, Kaoru; Toyokawa, Noriko; Fujiwara, Rho; Jho, Nobuo; Gomi, Fumi",International ophthalmology,189,7

Inherent dysfunctions of the endogenous stem/progenitor cells in skeletal repair disorders are still poorly understood. Here, we report that Fgfr3Y637C/+ over-activating mutation in Prx1-derived skeletal stem/progenitor cells leads to failure of fracture consolidation. We show that periosteal cells (PCs) carrying the Fgfr3Y637C/+ mutation can engage in osteogenic and chondrogenic lineages, but following transplantation do not undergo terminal chondrocyte hypertrophy and transformation into bone causing pseudarthrosis. Instead, Prx1Cre;Fgfr3Y637C/+ PCs give rise to fibrocartilage and fibrosis. Conversely, wild-type PCs transplanted at the fracture site of Prx1Cre;Fgfr3Y637C/+ mice allow hypertrophic cartilage transition to bone and permit fracture consolidation. The results thus highlight cartilage-to-bone transformation as a necessary step for bone repair and FGFR3 signaling within PCs as a key regulator of this transformation.","Julien, Anais; Perrin, Simon; Duchamp de Lageneste, Oriane; Carvalho, Caroline; Bensidhoum, Morad; Legeai-Mallet, Laurence; Colnot, Céline",Stem cell reports,189,1

METHODS Both pulse oximetry (PO) and ECG were applied immediately after delivery to measure heart rate (HR). We reviewed video recordings of the respective monitors, and checked the time at which each monitor started to display reliable rate values. RESULTS In 20 deliveries, ECG showed HR much earlier than PO (median 38 s vs 122 s after delivery). ECG displayed reliable HR throughout resuscitation. We were able to confirm the effectiveness of the initial respiratory support from the elevation in HR. CONCLUSIONS ECG was a safe and reliable method for showing HR, and was used to determine the initiation and the effectiveness of resuscitation in the delivery room.","Mizumoto, Hiroshi; Tomotaki, Seiichi; Shibata, Hirofumi; Ueda, Kazutoshi; Akashi, Ryoko; Uchio, Hiroko; Hata, Daisuke",Pediatrics international : official journal of the Japan Pediatric Society,189,17

However, the way Meritocracy has been conceptualized and operationalized in experimental studies has advanced in significant ways. As a result, a variety of paradigms arose to understand the social consequences of Meritocracy for intergroup relations; in particular, to understand the adverse consequences of Meritocracy for disadvantaged group members. The present research seeks to understand whether there is strong support for the idea that (manipulated) Meritocracy disproportionally affects members of low status groups, and also to understand which specific components of this norm have been successfully manipulated and to what consequences. And this is particularly important given the recent call for greater transparency in how the success of experimental manipulations is reported. Thus, we carried out a systematic review examining the content of different prime tasks, summarizing prime manipulation checks' effectiveness, and analyzing whether priming Meritocracy leads to less favorable orientations toward low status groups. Results across 33 studies revealed that despite the existing differences in the components highlighted, the salience of any of the Meritocracy dimensions facilitates the use of internal causal attributions, negative evaluations and stereotyping toward low status groups, affecting negatively decisions involving low-status group members, particularly in specific domains, as organizational contexts. These results carry both practical and theoretical implications for future research on the role of Meritocracy in intergroup settings.","Madeira, Ana Filipa; Costa-Lopes, Rui; Dovidio, John F; Freitas, Gonçalo; Mascarenhas, Mafalda F",Frontiers in psychology,189,5

Herein we report the first tubular heart valve made from two decellularized, engineered tissue tubes attached with absorbable sutures, which can meet this need, in principle. Engineered tissue tubes were fabricated by allowing ovine dermal fibroblasts to replace a sacrificial fibrin gel with an aligned, cell-produced collagenous matrix, which was subsequently decellularized. Previously, these engineered tubes became extensively recellularized following implantation into the sheep femoral artery. Thus, a tubular valve made from these tubes may be amenable to recellularization and, ideally, somatic growth. The suture line pattern generated three equi-spaced leaflets in the inner tube, which collapsed inward when exposed to back pressure, per tubular valve design. Valve testing was performed in a pulse duplicator system equipped with a secondary flow loop to allow for root distention. All tissue-engineered valves exhibited full leaflet opening and closing, minimal regurgitation (<5%), and low systolic pressure gradients (<2.5 mmHg) under pulmonary conditions. Valve performance was maintained under various trans-root pressure gradients and no tissue damage was evident after 2 million cycles of fatigue testing.","Reimer, Jay M; Syedain, Zeeshan H; Haynie, Bee H T; Tranquillo, Robert T",Biomaterials,189,19

Under the assumption that the main route of transmission includes aerosols and respiratory droplets, efforts to detect SARS-CoV-2 in fomites have focused on locations suspected of high prevalence (e.g., hospital wards, cruise ships, and mass transportation systems). To investigate the presence of SARS-CoV-2 on surfaces in the urban environment that are rarely cleaned and seldomly disinfected, 350 citizens were enlisted from the greater San Diego County. In total, these citizen scientists collected 4,080 samples. An online platform was developed to monitor sampling kit delivery and pickup, as well as to collect sample data. The sampling kits were mostly built from supplies available in pandemic-stressed stores. Samples were processed using reagents that were easy to access despite the recurrent supply shortage. The methods used were highly sensitive and resistant to inhibitors that are commonly present in environmental samples. The proposed experimental design and processing methods were successful at engaging numerous citizen scientists who effectively gathered samples from diverse surface areas. The workflow and methods described here are relevant to survey the urban environment for other viruses, which are of public health concern and pose a threat for future pandemics.","Rojas, Maria I; Giles, Steven S; Little, Mark; Baron, Rafael; Livingston, Isabella; Dagenais, Taylor R T; Baer, Jason; Cobián-Güemes, Ana G; White, Brandie; Rohwer, Forest",Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,189,20

We studied the cardioprotective role of extracellular vesicles (EV)s released into the circulation after RIC and EV accumulation in injured myocardium. METHODS We used plasma from healthy human volunteers before and after RIC (pre-PLA and post-PLA) to evaluate the transferability of RIC. Pre- and post-RIC plasma samples were separated into an EV enriched fraction (pre-EV + and post-EV +) and an EV poor fraction (pre-EV- and post-EV-) by size exclusion chromatography. Small non-coding RNAs from pre-EV + and post-EV + were purified and profiled by NanoString Technology. Infarct size was compared in Sprague-Dawley rat hearts perfused with isolated plasma and fractions in a Langendorff model. In addition, fluorescently labeled EVs were used to assess homing in an in vivo rat model. (ClinicalTrials.gov, number: NCT03380663) RESULTS: Post-PLA reduced infarct size by 15% points compared with Pre-PLA (55 ± 4% (n = 7) vs 70 ± 6% (n = 8), p = 0.03). Post-EV + reduced infarct size by 16% points compared with pre-EV + (53 ± 15% (n = 13) vs 68 ± 12% (n = 14), p = 0.03). Post-EV- did not affect infarct size compared to pre-EV- (64 ± 3% (n = 15) and 68 ± 10% (n = 16), p > 0.99). Three miRNAs (miR-16-5p, miR-144-3p and miR-451a) that target the mTOR pathway were significantly up-regulated in the post-EV + group. Labelled EVs accumulated more intensely in the infarct area than in sham hearts. CONCLUSION Cardioprotection by RIC can be mediated by circulating EVs that accumulate in injured myocardium. The underlying mechanism involves modulation of EV miRNA that may promote cell survival during reperfusion.","Lassen, Thomas Ravn; Just, Jesper; Hjortbak, Marie Vognstoft; Jespersen, Nichlas Riise; Stenz, Katrine Tang; Gu, Tingting; Yan, Yan; Su, Junyi; Hansen, Jakob; Bæk, Rikke; Jørgensen, Malene Møller; Nyengaard, Jens Randel; Kristiansen, Steen Buus; Drasbek, Kim Ryun; Kjems, Jørgen; Bøtker, Hans Erik",Basic research in cardiology,189,1

METHODS We conducted a cross-sectional, observational, retrospective study across 6 continents, 70 countries, and 457 stroke centers. Diagnoses were identified by their ICD-10 codes and/or classifications in stroke databases. RESULTS There were 91,373 stroke admissions in the 4 months immediately before compared to 80,894 admissions during the pandemic months, representing an 11.5% (95%CI, -11.7 to - 11.3, p<0.0001) decline. There were 13,334 IVT therapies in the 4 months preceding compared to 11,570 procedures during the pandemic, representing a 13.2% (95%CI, -13.8 to -12.7, p<0.0001) drop. Interfacility IVT transfers decreased from 1,337 to 1,178, or an 11.9% decrease (95%CI, -13.7 to -10.3, p=0.001). Recovery of stroke hospitalization volume (9.5%, 95%CI 9.2-9.8, p<0.0001) was noted over the two later (May, June) versus the two earlier (March, April) pandemic months. There was a 1.48% stroke rate across 119,967 COVID-19 hospitalizations. SARS-CoV-2 infection was noted in 3.3% (1,722/52,026) of all stroke admissions.

The purpose of this study was to compare the results of the use of iliac crest autograft versus allograft from the same anatomic site in terms of union and recurrence. METHODS Forty-six patients with genovarum with or without medial compartment osteoarthritis were enrolled based on specific inclusion and exclusion criteria and were randomly assigned into two groups. MOW-HTO was done using iliac crest allograft (23 patients) or autograft (23 patients) as void filler. Follow-up visits were done monthly for the first 3 months and then every 3 months until 1 year and then at 5th and 8th postoperative year. The clinical assessment of union, anatomical indices of proximal tibia, complications and WOMAC score were assessed for both groups. RESULTS The amount of correction (degrees), recurrence, complication rates, time to get symptom-free, radiologic union and knee scores was similar in both groups. The symptom-free time was 6.1 (SD = 0.9) weeks in autograft group versus 6.2 (SD = 0.8) weeks in allograft group (p = 0.73, 95% CI - 0.4 to 0.6). The time to radiologic union had a between-group difference of 0.3 weeks (p = 0.58, 95% CI - 1.6 to 0.9). There was one case of surgical site infection in graft harvest site. No nonunion or delayed union was encountered in either group. Fifty-two percent of the autograft patients reported more intense postoperative pain in iliac graft harvest site than tibial osteotomy site. CONCLUSIONS According to our results, iliac crest allograft can be safely used in MOW-HTO with comparable efficacy and safety to iliac crest autograft.

This is an ambispective, population-based cohort study. Descriptive analysis and Poisson regression models were used and the results were reported as prevalence ratio and 95% confidence intervals. From a total of 1,288 participants, 43.1% needed medical care and 28.5% reported impaired management of NCDs during social distance. Female sex, age between 18 and 30 years old, living in the Serra region (central region of the state), people with depression and multimorbidity were more likely to have impaired management of NCDs. Being physically active reduced the probability of having impaired management of NCD by 15%. Reduced monthly income was associated with the difficulty in accessing prescription medicine and avoidance of seeking in-person medical assistance. Depression was associated with difficulties in accessing medications, while avoidance of seeking in-person medical assistance was more likely for people with multimorbidity, arthritis/arthrosis/fibromyalgia, heart disease, and high cholesterol.","Leite, Jayne Santos; Feter, Natan; Caputo, Eduardo Lucia; Doring, Igor Retzlaff; Cassuriaga, Júlia; Reichert, Felipe Fossati; Silva, Marcelo Cozzensa da; Rombaldi, Airton José",Ciencia & saude coletiva,189,1

Graduate students also benefit from serving as mentors, as they gain teaching and research management experience. In early 2020, the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic caused many institutions to shut down physical work spaces and move research and teaching online. In this study, we explore how graduate student mentors and undergraduate student mentees at Washington University in St. Louis adapted to virtual research mentoring during the COVID-19 pandemic. We examined changes in mentoring methods, research productivity, and the impact on the future plans of both mentors and mentees across six science/engineering departments. Survey responses from 79 mentees and 38 mentors indicated that a majority of mentees were able to have meaningful and productive virtual mentoring experiences, while other mentors failed to adequately involve their mentees in continued mentoring. Focusing virtual research experiences on activities such as literature review and data analysis and collaborating on goal setting can serve as a way for mentors to engage mentees even when they are unable to access lab equipment. Data from the present study reveal opportunities and challenges of virtual mentoring and can be used to inform effective research mentoring practices in the future.","Speer, Julie E; Lyon, Max; Johnson, Julia",CBE life sciences education,189,7

Psychophysiological tasks are a useful tool for studying human behavior driven by mental processes such as cognitive control, reward evaluation, and learning. Neural mechanisms during behavioral tasks are often studied via simultaneous electrophysiological recordings. Popular online platforms such as Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) and Prolific enable deployment of tasks to numerous participants simultaneously. However, there is currently no task-creation framework available for flexibly deploying tasks both online and during simultaneous electrophysiology. METHODS We developed a task creation template, termed Honeycomb, that standardizes best practices for building jsPsych-based tasks. Honeycomb offers continuous deployment configurations for seamless transition between use in research settings and at home. Further, we have curated a public library, termed BeeHive, of ready-to-use tasks. RESULTS We demonstrate the benefits of using Honeycomb tasks with a participant in an ongoing study of deep brain stimulation for obsessive compulsive disorder, who completed repeated tasks both in the clinic and at home. CONCLUSION Honeycomb enables researchers to deploy tasks online, in clinic, and at home in more ecologically valid environments and during concurrent electrophysiology.","Provenza, Nicole R; Gelin, Luiz Fernando Fracassi; Mahaphanit, Wasita; McGrath, Mary C; Dastin-van Rijn, Evan M; Fan, Yunshu; Dhar, Rashi; Frank, Michael J; Restrepo, Maria I; Goodman, Wayne K; Borton, David A",Revista brasileira de psiquiatria,189,16

It has several risk factors, including stress and pressure. Stock volatility can cause acute stress for stockholders so that it can cause CVD events. Recently, the spread of new coronaviruses worldwide has affected economic development greatly, leading to more severe stock market fluctuations, so we systematically quantify the short-term effect of stock volatility and CVD events. Methods Time-series analysis on the effect of stock volatility and cardiovascular events were concluded. We conducted a systematic literature search for studies published in PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Data up to the date February 9, 2020. We assessed publication bias using Egger's test. Overall analysis and sensitivity analysis were conducted separately. Results Four studies were finally included. Every 100-point increase in the stock market will bring about 1.01% increases in cardiovascular mortality [95% confidence intervals (CI), -0.18% to 2.21%]. The meta-analysis showed no statistical significance for cardiovascular mortality. Every 100-point increase in the stock market brought 1.01% increases in the cardiovascular mortality [95% CI, -0.18% to 2.21%]. In terms of stroke events, the estimated effect was 2.999% (95% CI, 0.325% to 5.673%). Different lag patterns also have effects on cardiovascular mortality. Every 100-point increase brought about 4.026% (95% CI, 1.516% to 6.536%) and 4.424% (95% CI, 1.145% to 7.703%) for lag 01 and 04 separately. Conclusions Though our study has a number of limitations due to the limited studies included, it suggested that stock volatility had a lagging effect on CVD mortality, which may last for several days. Also, it might increase the incidence of stroke.","Lian, Hui; Ding, Xin; Zhang, Hongmin; Wang, Xiaoting",Annals of translational medicine,189,16

In late December 2019, the pathogen was identified as a new strain of coronavirus, named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and its associated disease, named Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19). As of July 3, 2020, 10,906,822 cases have been confirmed worldwide, with 522,112 deaths, as reported by the World Health Organization. Given the developing situation with COVID-19, extensive studies are urgently needed that determine indicators of severity to provide evidence for health policymakers. This study aimed to review the currently available data on hematological parameters to predict disease severity in patients of COVID-19. METHODS We performed a review using three electronic databases. Fourteen papers are included. In this review, we summarized the latest research highlighting the clinical features, pathogenesis, and diagnosis, with a concentration on hematological parameters that predict severity to help identify patients with severe disease. These indicators will help doctors know earlier which patients may need intensive care unit (ICU) care to manage their patients with an evidence-based protocol. RESULTS Most reviewed studies report hematological parameters that predict disease severity, including lymphopenia and elevated fibrin fragment D. CONCLUSIONS We recommend using these indicators in addition to others, like respiratory failure, shock, or multiple organs dysfunction syndrome, for disease classification in situations where there are insufficient ventilators or ICU beds to prioritize advanced medical services accordingly and to ensure the maximum provision of sufficient medical care.","Alamin, Amin A; Yahia, Amar I O",Clinical laboratory,189,32

OBJECTIVE To evaluate the prevalence and epidemiological features of newer and traditional respiratory viruses in infants and young children with recurrent wheeze. MATERIAL AND METHODS Cross sectional, prospective and descriptive study. Patients with recurrent wheeze and risk factors for asthma, age 2 months to 3 years, hospitalized with bronchial obstruction were included. On admission a respiratory sample was obtained through a nasopharyngeal aspirate. Immunofluorescence was performed to detect Respiratory Syncytial Virus, Adenovirus, Parainfluenza 1, 2, 3 and Influenza A and B. Polymerase Chain Reaction was used to detect Rhinovirus, Enterovirus, Metapneumovirus, Bocavirus, Adenovirus and Coronavirus. RESULTS 119 patients (61 female), age (x E DS) 1.5 E 0.9 years were included. Days on admission and on oxygen requirement were, respectively (x E DS): 6.3 E 2.9 y 4.4 E 2.7. One hundred and two (86%) positive cases were diagnosed. Fifty five percent of the viruses were detected by Immunofluorescence and 45% by Polymerase Chain Reaction. A single virus was present in 75% of the samples, 22% had a double co-infection and 3% a triple virus co-infection. Overall, the prevalence of detected respiratory viruses was: Respiratory Syncytial Virus 55 (43%); Rhinovirus 30 (23%); Metapneumovirus 13 (10%); Influenza A 8 (6%); Enterovirus 6 (5%); Bocavirus 6 (5%); Adenovirus 4 (3%); Coronavirus 3 (2%); Parainfluenza 1: 2 (1%); Influenza B, 1 (1%) and Parainfluenza 3: 1 (1%).

But to date, no systematic analysis of the risk factors affecting its occurrence has been conducted in a large series of patients. Analysis of Recanalization after Endovascular Treatment of intracranial Aneurysm (ARETA) is a multicenter, prospective trial whose aim is to collect a large series of patients treated endovascularly to analyze factors affecting aneurysm recanalization. STUDY DESIGN Patients with ruptured or unruptured aneurysms treated endovascularly will be enrolled from December 2013 to December 2014 in 19 participating centers in France. Patient and aneurysm characteristics will be recorded as well as the type of endovascular treatment and the occurrence of procedural or post-procedural complications. Post-procedural and follow-up imaging after one year will be analyzed independently by two readers using a 3-grade scale (complete occlusion, neck remnant, or aneurysm remnant). The progression of aneurysm occlusion will also be evaluated (improved, stable, or worsened). Aneurysm occlusion at one year and progression of aneurysm occlusion will be analyzed in light of patient, aneurysm, and treatment factors.

However, semi-quantitative diagnostic tools which encode hemodynamic properties in DSAs, such as angiographic parametric imaging (API), exist and may be used for evaluation of reperfusion during MT. The objective of this study was to use data-driven approaches, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with API maps, to automatically assess reperfusion in the neuro-vasculature during MT procedures based on the modified thrombolysis in cerebral infarction (mTICI) scale. METHODS DSAs from patients undergoing MTs of anterior circulation LVOs were collected, temporally cropped to isolate late arterial and capillary phases, and quantified using API peak height (PH) maps. PH maps were normalized to reduce injection variability. A CNN was developed, trained, and tested to classify PH maps into 2 outcomes (mTICI 0,1,2a/mTICI 2b,2c,3) or 3 outcomes (mTICI 0,1,2a/mTICI 2b/mTICI 2c,3), respectively. Ensembled networks were used to combine information from multiple views (anteroposterior and lateral). RESULTS The study included 383 DSAs.

At the same time, with the recovery of social production activities, China has become the only country among the major economies that will achieve positive growth in 2020. It has entered the post epidemic period. These measures have improved the local environmental quality. However, whether this improvement can be sustained is also a problem that needs to be solved. So, this study investigated the changes and differences of five air pollutants (PM2.5, PM10, NO2, SO2, and CO) in the nine cities most severely affected by the pandemic in China during the lockdown period and post pandemic period. We emphasize that when analyzing the changes of environmental quality during the epidemic, we must consider not only the impact of the day and short-term changes, but also the cumulative lag effect and sustainable development. Through a combination of qualitative and quantitative methods, it is found that the concentration of pollutants decreased significantly during the lockdown compared to the situation before the epidemic. PM10 and NO2 are falling most, which downs 39% and 46% respectively. During the lockdown period, the pollutant concentration response to the pandemic has a lag of 3-7 days. More specifically, in the cities related to single pollutants, the impact on the pollutant shows a significant correlation when the measures are delayed for seven days. In the cities that are related to multiple pollutants, the correlation is usually highest in 3-5 days. This means that the impact of policy measures on the environment lasted for 3-5 days. In addition, Wuhan, Jingmen and Jingzhou have seen the most obvious improvement. However, this improvement did not last. In the post pandemic period, the pollutants rebounded, the growth rates of PM10 and NO2 reached 44% and 87% in September. When compared with the changes of pollutants concentration in the same time period from 2017 to 2019, the decline rate has also been significantly slower, even higher than the average concentration of previous years. The research not only contributes to China's economic ""green recovery"" plan during the post epidemic period, but also provides reference for environmental governance during economic recovery in other countries.","Wang, Qiang; Yang, Xuan",Environmental research,189,1

METHODS PubMed, ISI Web of Science, PsycInfo and the Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health were systematically searched to identify interventions targeting nutrition and/or physical activity behaviours of children enrolled in early care centres between 1994 and 2016. Content analysis methods were used to capture information reflecting eight social marketing benchmark criteria. RESULTS The review included 135 articles representing 77 interventions. Two interventions incorporated all eight benchmark criteria, but the majority included fewer than four. Each intervention included behaviour and methods mix criteria, and more than half identified audience segments. Only one-third of interventions incorporated customer orientation, theory, exchange and insight. Only six interventions addressed competing behaviours. We did not find statistical significance for the effectiveness of interventions on child-level diet, physical activity or anthropometric outcomes based on the number of benchmark criteria used. CONCLUSION This review highlights opportunities to apply social marketing to obesity prevention interventions in early care centres. Social marketing could be an important strategy for early childhood obesity prevention efforts, and future research investigations into its effects are warranted.","Luecking, C T; Hennink-Kaminski, H; Ihekweazu, C; Vaughn, A; Mazzucca, S; Ward, D S",Obesity reviews : an official journal of the International Association for the Study of Obesity,189,17

More recently, epidemiological models have also been fit to viral sequence data using phylodynamic inference approaches that generally rely on the reconstruction of viral phylogenies. However, especially early on in an expanding viral population, phylogenetic uncertainty can be substantial and methods that require integration over this uncertainty can be computationally intensive. Here, we present an alternative approach to phylodynamic inference that circumvents the need for phylogenetic tree reconstruction. Our “tree-free” approach instead relies on quantifying the number of segregating sites observed in sets of sequences over time and using this trajectory of segregating sites to infer epidemiological parameters within a Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) framework. Using forward simulations, we first show that epidemiological parameters and processes leave characteristic signatures in segregating site trajectories, demonstrating that these trajectories have the potential to be used for phylodynamic inference. We then show using mock data that our proposed approach accurately recovers key epidemiological quantities such as the basic reproduction number and the timing of the index case. Finally, we apply our approach to SARS-CoV-2 sequence data from France, estimating a reproductive number of approximately 2.2 and an introduction time of mid-January 2021, consistent with estimates from epidemiological surveillance data. Our findings indicate that “tree-free” phylodynamic inference approaches that rely on simple population genetic summary statistics can play an important role in estimating epidemiological parameters and reconstructing infectious disease dynamics, especially early on in an epidemic.","Park, Yeongseon; Martin, Michael; Koelle, Katia",bioRxiv,189,25

Observations show an approximately 3 month outburst from Swift J011511.0-725611, the first detected by S-CUBED since it began in 2016 June. Swift J011511.0-725611 shows super-soft X-ray emission, indicative of a White Dwarf compact object, which is further strengthened by the presence of an 0.871 keV edge, commonly attributed to O viii K-edge in the WD atmosphere.

We had previously postulated that paracetamol exposure early in life, if combined with antioxidants that prevent accumulation of NAPQI, the toxic metabolite of paracetamol, might be innocuous. In this study, we administered paracetamol at or below the currently recommended therapeutic dose to male laboratory rat pups aged 4-10 days. The antioxidants cysteine and mannitol were included to prevent accumulation of NAPQI. In addition, animals were exposed to a cassette of common stress factors: an inflammatory diet, psychological stress, antibiotics, and mock infections using killed bacteria. At age 37-49 days, observation during introduction to a novel conspecific revealed increased rearing behavior, an asocial behavior, in animals treated with paracetamol plus antioxidants, regardless of their exposure to oxidative stress factors (2-way ANOVA; P < 0.0001). This observation would suggest that the initial hypothesis is incorrect, and that oxidative stress mediators do not entirely eliminate the effects of paracetamol on neurodevelopment. This study provides additional cause for caution when considering the use of paracetamol in the pediatric population, and provides evidence that the effects of paracetamol on neurodevelopment need to be considered both in the presence and in the absence of oxidative stress.","Suda, Navneet; Hernandez, Jasmine Cendejas; Poulton, John; Jones, John P; Konsoula, Zacharoula; Smith, Caroline; Parker, William",bioRxiv,189,16

In this study, we estimate the prevalence and reasons for forgoing healthcare during the pandemic in Geneva, Switzerland; a country with a universal and mandatory private health insurance coverage. Methods Participants from a randomly selected population-based sample of the adult population living in the Canton of Geneva completed an online socio-demographic and lifestyle questionnaire between November 2020 and January 2021. The prevalence and reasons for forgoing healthcare since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic were examined descriptively, and logistic regression models were used to assess determinants for forgoing healthcare. Results The study included 5,397 participants, among which 8.0% reported having forgone healthcare since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic; participants with a disadvantaged financial situation (OR=2.04; 95% CI: 1.56-2.65), and those reporting an average (OR=2.55; 95% CI: 1.94-3.32) or poor health (OR=4.40; 95% CI: 2.40-7.68) were more likely to forgo healthcare. The most common reasons to forgo healthcare were appointment cancellations by healthcare providers (53.9%), fear of infection (35.3%), and personal organizational issues (11.1%). Conclusion Our paper highlights the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on access to healthcare and identifies population sub-groups at-risk for forgoing healthcare.

For this purpose, the Open Data Infrastructure for Social Science and Economic Innovations (ODISSEI) consortium has supported the development of the ODISSEI Secure Supercomputer (OSSC) platform that allows researchers to link cohort data to data from Statistics Netherlands and run analyses in a high performance computing (HPC) environment. Methods After successful record linkage genome-wide association (GWA) analyses were carried out on expenditure for total health, mental health, primary and hospital care and medication. Record linkage for genotype data from 16,726 participants from the Netherlands Twin Register (NTR) with data from Statistics Netherlands was accomplished in the secure OSSC platform, followed by gene-based tests and estimation of total and SNP-based heritability. Results The total heritability of expenditure ranged between 29.4 (SE 0.8) and 37.5 (SE 0.8) per cent, but GWA analyses did not identify single SNPs or genes that were genome-wide significantly associated with health care expenditure. SNP-based heritability was between 0.0 (SE 3.5) and 5.4 (SE 4.0) per cent and was different from zero for mental health care and primary care expenditure. Conclusions We successfully linked genotype data to administrative health care expenditure data from Statistics Netherlands and performed a series of analyses on health care expenditure. The OSSC platform offers secure possibilities for analysing linked data in large-scale and realizing sample sizes required for GWA studies, providing invaluable opportunities to answer many new research questions.

While MPI has long provided support for multi-threaded communication and non-blocking operations, it falls short of adequately supporting APMs as correctly and efficiently handling MPI communication in different models is still a challenge. Meanwhile, new low-level implementations of light-weight, cooperatively scheduled execution contexts (fibers, aka user-level threads (ULT)) are meant to serve as a basis for higher-level APMs and their integration in MPI implementations has been proposed as a replacement for traditional POSIX thread support to alleviate these challenges. In this paper, we first establish a taxonomy in an attempt to clearly distinguish different concepts in the parallel software stack. We argue that the proposed tight integration of fiber implementations with MPI is neither warranted nor beneficial and instead is detrimental to the goal of MPI being a portable communication abstraction. We propose MPI Continuations as an extension to the MPI standard to provide callback-based notifications on completed operations, leading to a clear separation of concerns by providing a loose coupling mechanism between MPI and APMs. We show that this interface is flexible and interacts well with different APMs, namely OpenMP detached tasks, OmpSs-2, and Argobots.","Schuchart, Joseph; Niethammer, Christoph; Gracia, Jos'e",,189,33

Although bilateral multiple ground glass opacities with some consolidation of reticular shadow located at peripheral of lung are reported characteristics of COVID-19 imaging findings, it is difficult to diagnose COVID-19 pneumonia just by CT findings. It is also difficult to distinguish it from drug-induced lung injury in patients receiving cancer treatment. In addition to the imaging findings, we need to comprehensively distinguish various differential diagnoses in cancer patients who develops pneumonia in the COVID-19 pandemic, considering clinical symptoms, behavioral history and other clinical tests. Here, we describe clinical features and imaging findings of COVID-19 pneumonia and the points to be noted in cancer treatment in the era of COVID-19.","Kudo, Kenichiro; Ichihara, Eiki",Gan to kagaku ryoho.

However, recent studies provided strong supports that RNAi also plays a role in antiviral mechanism in mammalian cells. To combat RNAi-mediated antiviral responses, many viruses encode viral suppressors of RNA silencing (VSR) to facilitate their replication. VSRs have been widely studied for plant and insect viruses, but only a few have been defined for mammalian viruses currently. We identified a novel VSR from coronaviruses, a group of medically important mammalian viruses including Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), and showed that the nucleocapsid protein (N protein) of coronaviruses suppresses RNAi triggered by either short hairpin RNAs or small interfering RNAs in mammalian cells. Mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) is closely related to SARS-CoV in the family Coronaviridae and was used as a coronavirus replication model. The replication of MHV increased when the N proteins were expressed in trans, while knockdown of Dicer1 or Ago2 transcripts facilitated the MHV replication in mammalian cells. These results support the hypothesis that RNAi is a part of the antiviral immunity responses in mammalian cells. IMPORTANCE RNAi has been well known to play important antiviral roles from plants to invertebrates. However, recent studies provided strong supports that RNAi is also involved in antiviral response in mammalian cells. An important indication for RNAi-mediated antiviral activity in mammals is the fact that a number of mammalian viruses encode potent suppressors of RNA silencing. Our results demonstrate that coronavirus N protein could function as a VSR through its double-stranded RNA binding activity. Mutational analysis of N protein allowed us to find out the critical residues for the VSR activity. Using the MHV-A59 as the coronavirus replication model, we showed that ectopic expression of SARS-CoV N protein could promote MHV replication in RNAi-active cells but not in RNAi-depleted cells. These results indicate that coronaviruses encode a VSR that functions in the replication cycle and provide further evidence to support that RNAi-mediated antiviral response exists in mammalian cells.","Cui, Lei; Wang, Haiying; Ji, Yanxi; Yang, Jie; Xu, Shan; Huang, Xingyu; Wang, Zidao; Qin, Lei; Tien, Po; Zhou, Xi; Guo, Deyin; Chen, Yu",Journal of virology,189,12

OBJECTIVE To describe the clinical spectrum and outcomes of ALI/ARDS in patients with SARS-related critical illness. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS Retrospective case series of adult patients with probable SARS admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of a hospital in Singapore between March 6 and June 6, 2003. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The primary outcome measure was 28-day mortality after symptom onset. RESULTS Of 199 patients hospitalized with SARS, 46 (23%) were admitted to the ICU, including 45 who fulfilled criteria for ALI/ARDS. Mortality at 28 days for the entire cohort was 20 (10.1%) of 199 and for ICU patients was 17 (37%) of 46. Intensive care unit mortality at 13 weeks was 24 (52.2%) of 46. Nineteen of 24 ICU deaths occurred late (> or =7 days after ICU admission) and were attributed to complications related to severe ARDS, multiorgan failure, thromboembolic complications, or septicemic shock. ARDS was characterized by ease of derecruitment of alveoli and paucity of airway secretion, bronchospasm, or dynamic hyperinflation. Lower Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II scores and higher baseline ratios of PaO2 to fraction of inspired oxygen were associated with earlier recovery. CONCLUSIONS Critically ill patients with SARS and ALI/ARDS had characteristic clinical findings, high rates of complications; and high mortality. These findings may provide useful information for optimizing supportive care for SARS-related critical illness.","Lew, Thomas W K; Kwek, Tong-Kiat; Tai, Dessmon; Earnest, Arul; Loo, Shi; Singh, Kulgit; Kwan, Kim Meng; Chan, Yeow; Yim, Chik Foo; Bek, Siam Lee; Kor, Ai Ching; Yap, Wee See; Chelliah, Y Rubuen; Lai, Yeow Choy; Goh, Soon-Keng",JAMA,189,22

Despite all the precautions taken, the pandemic attack continues and the rapid increase in the number of deaths suggest that this virus has entered the cell through different pathways and caused damage through different mechanisms. The main reason why the ACE2 pathway comes to the fore in all scientific studies is that this receptor is located at the entry point of basic mechanisms that provide alveolo-capillary homeostasis. SARS-CoV-2 has to use nuclear factor-κB (NF-kB), caveloae, clathrin, lipoxin, serine protease and proteasome pathways in addition to ACE2 to enter the target cell and initiate damage. For this reason, while new drug development studies are continuing, in order to be beneficial to patients in their acute period, it is imperative that we are able to come up with drugs that activate or inhibit these pathways and are currently in clinical use. It is also critical that we adopt these new pathways to the treatment of pregnant women affected by SARS-CoV-2, based on the scientific data we use to treat the general population.","Celik, Onder; Celik, Nilufer; Aydin, Suleyman; Baysal, Bora; Aydin, Suna; Saglam, Aylin; Gursu, Yagmur; Dalkilic, Semih; Ulas, Mustafa; Ozcil, Mustafa D; Tayyar, Ahter T; Cengiz, Ferhat; Ugur, Kader; Akkoc, Ramazan Fazil; Ersahin, Aynur A",Cellular and molecular biology,189,28

The major active component of Disifin is tosylchloramide sodium (chloramine T). However, the mechanism by which Disifin suppresses the activities of pathogenic microbial agents remains enigmatic. The molecular mechanisms, and the receptors and the signal transducing pathways responsible for the biological effects of Disifin are largely unknown. Despite considerable advances, enormous investigative efforts and large resources invested in the research on infectious diseases, microbial infection still remains a public health problem in many parts of the world. The exact nature of the pathogenic agents responsible for many infectious diseases, and the nature of the receptors mediating the associated inflammatory events are incompletely understood. Recent advances in understanding the molecular basis for mammalian host immune responses to microbial invasion suggest that the first line of defense against microbes is the recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) by a family of transmembrane pattern-recognizing and signal transducing receptor proteins called Toll-like receptors (TLRs). The TLR family plays an instructive role in innate immune responses against microbial pathogens, as well as the subsequent induction of adaptive immune responses. TLRs mediate recognition and inflammatory responses to a wide range of microbial products and are crucial for effective host defense by eradication of the invading pathogens. Now, recent updates demonstrated the ability of Disifin-derived products, Disifin-Animal and Disifin-Pressant to effectively suppress the progression and activities of Chikungunya fever and that of avian influenza A virus [A/cardialis/Germany/72, H7N1: the agent of a highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI)] infection, respectively. Overall, the above findings led me to suggest that Disifin and TLRs may mechanistically overlap in the processes of executing their functions against pathogenic microbial organisms. Thus, elucidating and better understanding of the molecular underpinnings responsible for the biochemical effects of Disifin-products, and the nature and mode of the interaction(s) of Disifin with TLRs in the process of exerting their biological effects may open a novel dimension in the research of infectious diseases, which may provide novel therapeutic targets for the prevention and treatment of a wide range of infectious diseases.","Ofodile, Okom Nkili F C",Journal of industrial microbiology & biotechnology,189,7

Difficulties with intubation commonly arise, and alternative laryngoscopes that use digital and/or fibreoptic technology have been designed to improve visibility when airway difficulty is predicted or encountered. Among these devices, a rigid videolaryngoscope (VLS) uses a blade to retract the soft tissues and transmits a lighted video image to a screen. OBJECTIVES Our primary objective was to assess whether use of videolaryngoscopy for tracheal intubation in adults requiring general anaesthesia reduces risks of complications and failure compared with direct laryngoscopy. Our secondary aim was to assess the benefits and risks of these devices in selected population groups, such as adults with obesity and those with a known or predicted difficult airway. SEARCH METHODS We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE and Embase on 10 February 2015. Our search terms were relevant to the review question and were not limited by outcomes. We carried out clinical trials register searches and forward and backward citation tracking. We reran the search on 12 January 2016; we added potential new studies of interest from the 2016 search to a list of 'Studies awaiting classification', and we will incorporate these studies into the formal review during the review update. SELECTION CRITERIA We considered all randomized controlled trials and quasi-randomized studies with adult patients undergoing laryngoscopy performed with a VLS or a Macintosh laryngoscope in a clinical, emergency or out-of-hospital setting. We included parallel and cross-over study designs. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data, consulting a third review author to resolve disagreements. We used standard Cochrane methodological procedures, including assessment of risk of bias. MAIN RESULTS We included 64 studies identified during the 2015 search that enrolled 7044 adult participants and compared a VLS of one or more designs with a Macintosh laryngoscope. We identified 38 studies awaiting classification and seven ongoing studies. Of the 64 included studies, 61 included elective surgical patients, and three were conducted in an emergency setting. Among 48 studies that included participants without a predicted difficult airway, 15 used techniques to simulate a difficult airway. Seven recruited participants with a known or predicted difficult airway, and the remaining studies did not specify or included both predicted and not predicted difficult airways. Only two studies specifically recruited obese participants. It was not possible to blind the intubator to the device, and we noted a high level of inevitable heterogeneity, given the large number of studies.Statistically significantly fewer failed intubations were reported when a VLS was used (Mantel-Haenszel (M-H) odds ratio (OR), random-effects 0.35, 95% confidence Interval (CI) 0.19 to 0.65; 38 studies; 4127 participants), and fewer failed intubations occurred when a VLS was used in participants with an anticipated difficult airway (M-H OR, random-effects 0.28, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.55; six studies; 830 participants). We graded the quality of this evidence as moderate on the basis of the GRADE system. Failed intubations were fewer when a VLS was used in participants with a simulated difficult airway (M-H OR, random-effects 0.18, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.77; nine studies; 810 participants), but groups with no predicted difficult airway provided no significant results (M-H OR, random-effects 0.61, 95% CI 0.22 to 1.67; 19 studies; 1743 participants).Eight studies reported on hypoxia, and only three of these described any events; results showed no differences between devices for this outcome (M-H OR, random-effects 0.39, 95% CI 0.10 to 1.44; 1319 participants). Similarly, few studies reported on mortality, noting no differences between devices (M-H OR, fixed-effect 1.09, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.82; two studies; 663 participants), and only one study reporting on the occurrence of respiratory complications (78 participants); we graded these three outcomes as very low quality owing to lack of data. We found no statistically significant differences between devices in the proportion of successful first attempts (M-H OR, random-effects 1.27, 95% CI 0.77 to 2.09; 36 studies; 4731 participants) nor in those needing more than one attempt. We graded the quality of this evidence as moderate. Studies reported no statistically significant differences in the incidence of sore throat in the postanaesthesia care unit (PACU) (M-H OR, random-effects 1.00 (95% CI 0.73 to 1.38); 10 studies; 1548 participants) nor at 24 hours postoperatively (M-H OR random-effects 0.54, 95% CI 0.27 to 1.07; eight studies; 844 participants); we graded the quality of this evidence as moderate. Data combined to include studies of cross-over design revealed statistically significantly fewer laryngeal or airway traumas (M-H OR, random-effects 0.68, 95% CI 0.48 to 0.96; 29 studies; 3110 participants) and fewer incidences of postoperative hoarseness (M-H OR, fixed-effect 0.57, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.88; six studies; 527 participants) when a VLS was used. A greater number of laryngoscopies performed with a VLS achieved a view of most of the glottis (M-H OR, random-effects 6.77, 95% CI 4.17 to 10.98; 22 studies; 2240 participants), fewer laryngoscopies performed with a VLS achieved no view of the glottis (M-H OR, random-effects 0.18, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.27; 22 studies; 2240 participants) and the VLS was easier to use (M-H OR, random-effects 7.13, 95% CI 3.12 to 16.31; seven studies; 568 participants).Although a large number of studies reported time required for tracheal intubation (55 studies; 6249 participants), we did not present an effects estimate for this outcome owing to the extremely high level of statistical heterogeneity (I2 = 96%). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS Videolaryngoscopes may reduce the number of failed intubations, particularly among patients presenting with a difficult airway. They improve the glottic view and may reduce laryngeal/airway trauma. Currently, no evidence indicates that use of a VLS reduces the number of intubation attempts or the incidence of hypoxia or respiratory complications, and no evidence indicates that use of a VLS affects time required for intubation.","Lewis, Sharon R; Butler, Andrew R; Parker, Joshua; Cook, Tim M; Smith, Andrew F",The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,189,1

PATIENTS AND METHODS Patients who tolerated an occluded cuffless tube were included. Ventilatory variables and esophageal pressure were recorded. The pressure-time product (PTP), PTP/min, and PTP/min/tidal volume (PTP/min/VT) were measured. Each condition was measured for 5 min with a 15 min time interval between evaluations. Quantitative data are expressed as mean ± standard deviation. Single-factor analysis of variance was used, and the Games-Howell test was used for post hoc analysis of comparisons between group means (P ≤ 0.05). RESULTS Eight patients were studied under each of the four conditions described above. Statistically significant differences were found for PTP, PTP/min, and PTP/min/VT. In the post hoc analysis for PTP, significant differences among all conditions were found. For PTP/min, there was no significant difference between Conditions 2 and 4 (P = 0.138), and for PTP/min/VT, there was no significant difference between Conditions 1 and 2 (P = 0.072) or between Conditions 2 and 3 (P = 0.106). A trend toward a higher PTP, PTP/min, and PTP/min/VT was observed when breathing through a cuffless tracheostomy tube. CONCLUSION The four conditions differed with respect to WOB. Cuff inflation could result in a reduced WOB because there is less dead space. Cuffless tracheostomy tubes generate increased WOB, perhaps due to the material deformity caused by body temperature.","Villalba, Darío; Feld, Viviana; Leiva, Valeria; Scrigna, Mariana; Distéfano, Eduardo; Pratto, Romina; Rodriguez, Matías; Collins, Jesica; Rocco, Ana; Matesa, Amelia; Rossi, Damián; Areas, Laura; Virgilio, Sacha; Golfarini, Nicolás; Gil-Rosetti, Gregorio; Diaz-Ballve, Pablo; Planells, Fernando",International journal of critical illness and injury science,189,11

Frameshifting is vital for viral reproduction. Using the information gained from the recent high-resolution crystal structure of the beet western yellow virus pseudoknot, a systematic mutational analysis has been carried out in vitro and in vivo. We find that specific nucleotide tertiary interactions at the junction between the two stems of the pseudoknot are crucial. A triplex is found between stem 1 and loop 2, and triplex interactions are required for frameshifting function. For some mutations, loss of one hydrogen bond is sufficient to abolish frameshifting. Furthermore, mutations near the 5' end of the pseudoknot can increase frameshifting by nearly 300%, possibly by modifying ribosomal contacts. It is likely that the selection of suitable mutations can thus allow viruses to adjust frameshifting efficiencies and thereby regulate protein synthesis in response to environmental change.","Kim, Y G; Su, L; Maas, S; O'Neill, A; Rich, A",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,189,1

The chemokine receptor CCR2 plays an important role in macrophage recruitment and in the development of T1 immunity. In the present study, we addressed the role of CCR2 in influenza A virus infection. CCR2 knockout (-/-) mice are protected against influenza A virus infection, despite delayed recruitment of macrophages. We show that low-dose influenza infection of CCR2-/- mice leads to increased neutrophilia between Days 5 and 10 after infection and decreased monocyte/macrophage and CD4(+) T cell recruitment to the lungs between Days 5 and 7 after infection. These changes in leukocyte recruitment did not result from or cause increased viral titers or delayed viral clearance. Neutrophilia in the lungs correlated with increased keratinocyte-derived chemokine (KC) and/or MIP-2 expression in CCR2-/- mice between Days 5 to 10 after infection, although the kinetics of neutrophil recruitment was not altered. MIP-2 mRNA and protein expression was increased three- to fivefold, and KC protein levels were increased two- to threefold in CCR2-/- compared with CCR2 wild-type mice at Day 5 after infection. This preceded the peak neutrophil influx, which occurred 7 days after infection. In vitro studies confirmed that MIP-2 and KC accounted for neutrophil chemotactic activity in the bronchoalveolar lavage. CCR2 deficiency also resulted in increased MIP-1alpha, MIP-1beta, MCP-1, and IFN-inducible protein 10 and decreased RANTES mRNA expression. Furthermore, IL-6 and TNF-alpha cytokine production were elevated after infection. These studies suggest that CCR2 plays a multifactorial role in the development of the immune response to influenza.","Wareing, Mark D; Lyon, Ashley; Inglis, Chandra; Giannoni, Francesca; Charo, Israel; Sarawar, Sally R",Journal of leukocyte biology,189,1

In this study, we discuss the application of Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) and data integrating technology with the medical service, and examine whether or not this technology can enhance medical safety. We also discuss the possible benefits following the application of the RFID system. The findings show that the application of RFID to hospitals can actually generate benefits, which can be further divided into operational structure benefits, users' structure benefits, and organisational and environmental benefits. However, not all these benefits can achieve medical safety. Among them, only the operator and environmental benefits can play such roles. Nevertheless, the application of RFID can bring hospitals towards the integration of technology benefits and improved medical safety.","Chang, She-I; Ou, Chin-Shyh; Ku, Cheng-Yuan; Yang, Morris",International journal of electronic healthcare,189,16

There are two commonly discussed mechanisms by which biodiversity loss could increase rates of infectious disease in a landscape. First, loss of competitors or predators could facilitate an increase in the abundance of competent reservoir hosts. Second, biodiversity loss could disproportionately affect non-competent, or less competent reservoir hosts, which would otherwise interfere with pathogen transmission to human populations by, for example, wasting the bites of infected vectors. A negative association between biodiversity and disease risk, sometimes called the ""dilution effect hypothesis,"" has been supported for a few disease agents, suggests an exciting win-win outcome for the environment and society, and has become a pervasive topic in the disease ecology literature. Case studies have been assembled to argue that the dilution effect is general across disease agents. Less touted are examples in which elevated biodiversity does not affect or increases infectious disease risk for pathogens of public health concern. In order to assess the likely generality of the dilution effect, we review the association between biodiversity and public health across a broad variety of human disease agents. Overall, we hypothesize that conditions for the dilution effect are unlikely to be met for most important diseases of humans. Biodiversity probably has little net effect on most human infectious diseases but, when it does have an effect, observation and basic logic suggest that biodiversity will be more likely to increase than to decrease infectious disease risk.","Wood, Chelsea L; Lafferty, Kevin D; DeLeo, Giulio; Young, Hillary S; Hudson, Peter J; Kuris, Armand M",Ecology,189,16

Much of the current literature on ICU design has focused on patient-centred outcomes, such as nosocomial infections, aspects of psychological and physiological wellbeing, and patient satisfaction, but the design of the ICU environment also affects health care workers. The literature seems to favour the use of single rooms rather than an open-plan ICU design, with the major benefits being to infection control, but this notion is controversial. For most aspects of ICU design, more research is required before definite conclusions can be drawn.

DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH The study primarily uses the define-measure-analyze-improve-control (DMAIC) approach, and draws on various analytical tools such as work flow diagrams, value stream mapping, and discrete event simulation to examine the effect of implementing RFID technology on improving effectiveness (quality and timeliness) and efficiency (cost reduction) of outpatient surgical processes. FINDINGS The analysis showed significant estimated annual cost and time savings in carrying out patients' surgical procedures with RFID technology implementation for the outpatient surgery processes in a hospital. This is largely due to the elimination of both non-value added activities of locating supplies and equipment and also the elimination of the ""return"" loop created by preventable post operative infections. Several poka-yokes developed using RFID technology were identified to eliminate those two issues. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS Several poka-yokes developed using RFID technology were identified for improving the safety of the patient and cost effectiveness of the operation to ensure the success of the outpatient surgical process. ORIGINALITY/VALUE Many stakeholders in the hospital environment will be impacted including patients, physicians, nurses, technicians, administrators and other hospital personnel. Different levels of training of hospital personnel will be required, based on the degree of interaction with the RFID system. Computations of costs and savings will help decision makers understand the benefits and implications of the technology in the hospital environment.","Southard, Peter B; Chandra, Charu; Kumar, Sameer",International journal of health care quality assurance,189,8

There is scarce data on rural populations' knowledge of MI, even though they are disadvantaged in access to medical emergency services. Objective: The aim of the study was to investigate the rural patients' awareness of MI risk factors, symptoms, necessity of calling an ambulance in response to MI symptoms, and its determinants. Materials and Methods: An anonymous and voluntary survey was conducted among 194 patients and their caregivers with median age 68 years at a rural non-public healthcare facility in Poland. R e s u l t s: 60.3% perceive their knowledge of MI as insufficient. Only 26.3% were able to recognise all suggested MI risk factors. 44.8% did not know whether they are at risk of MI. Furthermore, 78% of respondents who had at least three MI risk factors were unaware of being at risk. 45.4% recognised at least three out of four suggested MI symptoms. 76.2% would call an ambulance in response to chest pain suggesting they have MI. Merely 80% were able to provide the emergency phone number. Moreover, among respondents who declared they would not call an ambulance, 38.7% were afraid of in-hospital COVID-19 infection or healthcare system collapse.

Here we show that a significant proportion (20%) of the total RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) activity from cells infected with West Nile virus, Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), and dengue virus is resident within the nucleus. Consistent with this, the major replicase proteins NS3 and NS5 of JEV also localized within the nucleus. NS5 was found distributed throughout the nucleoplasm, but NS3 was present at sites of active flaviviral RNA synthesis, colocalizing with NS5, and visible as distinct foci along the inner periphery of the nucleus by confocal and immunoelectron microscopy. Both these viral replicase proteins were also present in the nuclear matrix, colocalizing with the peripheral lamina, and revealed a well-entrenched nuclear location for the viral replication complex. In keeping with this observation, antibodies to either NS3 or NS5 coimmunoprecipitated the other protein from isolated nuclei along with newly synthesized viral RNA. Taken together these data suggest an absolute requirement for both of the replicase proteins for nucleus-localized synthesis of flavivirus RNA. Thus, we conclusively demonstrate for the first time that the host cell nucleus functions as an additional site for the presence of functionally active flaviviral replicase complex.","Uchil, Pradeep Devappa; Kumar, Anil V A; Satchidanandam, Vijaya",Journal of virology,189,1

Neurons have been shown to act as a repository site at the early stages of the disease process (O. Sorensen and S. Dales, J. Virol. 56:434-438, 1985). JHM virus (JHMV) replication and trafficking of viral proteins and virions in cultured rat hippocampal neurons and a neuronal cell line, OBL-21, were examined, with an emphasis placed on the role of the microtubular network. We show here that JHMV spread within the central nervous system occurs transneuronally and that virus protein trafficking was dependent upon microtubules. Viral trafficking occurred asymmetrically, involving both the somatodendritic and the axonal domains. Thus coronavirus can be disseminated from neurons at either the basolateral or the apical domains. A specific interaction between antibodies derived against the microtubule-associated protein tau and JHMV nucleocapsid protein (N) was observed, which can presumably be explained by an overall amino acid similarity of 44% and an identity of 20% between proteins N and tau, with optimal alignment at the microtubule binding domain of tau. Collectively, our data suggest an important role of the microtubule network in viral protein trafficking and distribution. They also draw attention to protein sequence mimicry of a cell component by this coronavirus as one strategy for making use of the host's functions on behalf of the virus.","Pasick, J M; Kalicharran, K; Dales, S",Journal of virology,189,1

viral epidemics such as the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2002 to 2003, and H1N1 influenza in 2009, have been recorded Most recently, the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was first identified in Saudi Arabia in 2012 In a timeline that reaches the present day, an epidemic of cases with unexplained low respiratory infections detected in Wuhan, the largest metropolitan area in China's Hubei province, was first reported to the WHO Country Office in China, on December 31, 2019 Published literature can trace the beginning of symptomatic individuals back to the beginning of December 2019 As they were unable to identify the causative agent, these first cases were classified as ""pneumonia of unknown etiology "" The Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and local CDCs organized an intensive outbreak investigation program The etiology of this illness is now attributed to a novel virus belonging to the coronavirus (CoV) family, COVID-19 On February 11, 2020, the WHO Director-General, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, announced that the disease caused by this new CoV was a ""COVID-19,"" which is the acronym of ""coronavirus disease 2019"" In the past twenty years, two additional coronavirus epidemics have occurred SARS-CoV provoked a large-scale epidemic beginning in China and involving two dozen countries with approximately 8000 cases and 800 deaths, and the MERS-CoV that began in Saudi Arabia and has approximately 2,500 cases and 800 deaths and still causes as sporadic cases This new virus seems to be very contagious and has quickly spread globally In a meeting on January 30, 2020, per the International Health Regulations (IHR, 2005), the outbreak was declared by the WHO a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) as it had spread to 18 countries with four countries reporting human-to-human transmission An additional landmark occurred on February 26, 2020, as the first case of the disease, not imported from China, was recorded in the United States Initially, the new virus was called 2019-nCoV Subsequently, the task of experts of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) termed it the SARS-CoV-2 virus as it is very similar to the one that caused the SARS outbreak (SARS-CoVs) The CoVs have become the major pathogens of emerging respiratory disease outbreaks They are a large family of single-stranded RNA viruses (+ssRNA) that can be isolated in different animal species For reasons yet to be explained, these viruses can cross species barriers and can cause, in humans, illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as MERS and SARS Interestingly, these latter viruses have probably originated from bats and then moving into other mammalian hosts — the Himalayan palm civet for SARS-CoV, and the dromedary camel for MERS-CoV — before jumping to humans The dynamics of SARS-Cov-2 are currently unknown, but there is speculation that it also has an animal origin The potential for these viruses to grow to become a pandemic worldwide seems to be a serious public health risk Concerning COVID-19, the WHO raised the threat to the CoV epidemic to the ""very high"" level, on February 28, 2020 Probably, the effects of the epidemic caused by the new CoV has yet to emerge as the situation is quickly evolving World governments are at work to establish countermeasures to stem possible devastating effects Health organizations coordinate information flows and issues directives and guidelines to best mitigate the impact of the threat At the same time, scientists around the world work tirelessly, and information about the transmission mechanisms, the clinical spectrum of disease, new diagnostics, and prevention and therapeutic strategies are rapidly developing Many uncertainties remain with regard to both the virus-host interac ion and the evolution of the epidemic, with specific reference to the times when the epidemic will reach its peak At the moment, the therapeutic strategies to deal with the infection are only supportive, and prevention aimed at reducing transmission in the community is our best

An ubiquitous class of safety risks are learned shortcuts, i.e. spurious correlations a network exploits for its decisions that have no semantic connection to the actual task. Networks relying on such shortcuts bear the risk of not generalizing well to unseen inputs. Explainability methods help to uncover such network vulnerabilities. However, many of these techniques are not directly applicable if access to the network is constrained, in so-called black-box setups. These setups are prevalent when using third-party ML components. To address this constraint, we present an approach to detect learned shortcuts using an interpretable-by-design network as a proxy to the black-box model of interest. Leveraging the proxy's guarantees on introspection we automatically extract candidates for learned shortcuts. Their transferability to the black box is validated in a systematic fashion. Concretely, as proxy model we choose a BagNet, which bases its decisions purely on local image patches. We demonstrate on the autonomous driving dataset A2D2 that extracted patch shortcuts significantly influence the black box model. By efficiently identifying such patch-based vulnerabilities, we contribute to safer ML models.","Rosenzweig, Julia; Sicking, Joachim; Houben, Sebastian; Mock, Michael; Akila, Maram",,189,1

In this viewpoint, we present arguments suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 mutants responsible for the second wave have less virulence but much higher infectivity. This suggestion is based on the results of the forecasting and mechanistic models developed by our study group. In particular, in May 2020, the analysis of our mechanistic model predicted that the easing of lockdown measures will lead to a dramatic second wave of the COVID-19 outbreak. However, after the lockdown was lifted in many European countries, the resulting number of reported infected cases and especially the number of deaths remained low for approximately two months. This raised the false hope that a substantial second wave will be avoided and that the COVID-19 epidemic in these European countries was nearing an end. Unfortunately, since the first week of August 2020, the number of reported infected cases increased dramatically. Furthermore, this was accompanied by an increasingly large number of deaths. The rate of reported infected cases in the second wave was much higher than that in the first wave, whereas the rate of deaths was lower. This trend is consistent with higher infectivity and lower virulence. Even if the mutated form of SARS-CoV-2 is less virulent, the very high number of reported infected cases implies that a large number of people will perish.","Fokas, Athanassios S; Kastis, George A",J Med Internet Res,189,16

OBJECTIVE: To retrieve and investigate the prevention and control measures of clinical pharmacists during the outbreak of novel coronavirus, summarize the roles and responsibilities of clinical pharmacists, and to propose innovative strategies for developing pharmacy services under the epidemic. METHODS: The Chinese and English databases, self-media network, website of professional society or medical institution, and clinical trial center platforms were searched, and clinical pharmacists involved in the work against COVID-19 were surveyed and interviewed. Investigate the challenges and needs of frontline medical staffs for treating patients, and formulate strategies based on the actual medical environment. RESULTS: Clinical pharmacists play a vital role in leading the industry to formulate work instructions, provide frontline medical staff with drug information, and develop innovative pharmacy services to promote the rational use of medicines with collaborative teamwork and close communication according to the epidemic situation of COVID-19. Anti-epidemic work indeed has driven the development of remote pharmacy services. CONCLUSION: Facing public health emergencies, clinical pharmacists can give full play to their professional expertise, analyze the current situation rationally, formulate telehealth strategies swiftly, and work in a united and efficient manner to provide innovative pharmacy services to ensure medication safety and rational use of medicine.","Li, Huibo; Zheng, Siqian; Liu, Fang; Liu, Wei; Zhao, Rongsheng",Res. soc. adm. pharm,189,24

We conducted a scientific search in main databases with a combination of related MESH terms and keywords. The outcomes included common clinical symptoms at the time of onset of the disease, common laboratory and radiological findings, the rates of vaginal delivery and Cesarean section, Cesarean section indications, maternal complications, and vertical transmission rates. A total of 51 studies comprising 571 pregnant women with COVID-19 pneumonia were included in the study. The most common symptoms were fever, cough, and dyspnea, respectively. Elevated C-reactive protein and ground-glass opacities were the most common laboratory and radiological findings of COVID-19 pneumonia, respectively. A total of 114 Cesarean sections were performed due to COVID-19-related concerns. There were 55 cases of intubation (11.6%) and 13 maternal deaths (2.3%). The vertical transmission rate was 7.9%. We conclude that the characteristics of pneumonia caused by COVID-19 in pregnant women do not appear to be different from those in the general population with COVID-19 infections. However, pregnant women with underlying diseases were more likely to develop COVID-19 than others, and, in those infected with the virus, the rate of Cesarean delivery and preterm birth increased.","Karimi, Leila; Vahedian-Azimi, Amir; Makvandi, Somayeh; Sahebkar, Amirhossein",Adv Exp Med Biol,189,16

Currently, drugs screened are urgently aiming to block the infection of SARS-CoV-2. Here, we explored the interaction networks of kinase and COVID-19 crosstalk, and identified phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT pathway as the most important kinase signal pathway involving COVID-19. Further, we found a PI3K/AKT signal pathway inhibitor capivasertib restricted the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into cells under non-cytotoxic concentrations. Lastly, the signal axis PI3K/AKT/FYVE finger-containing phosphoinositide kinase (PIKfyve)/PtdIns(3,5)P2 was revealed to play a key role during the cellular entry of viruses including SARS-CoV-2, possibly providing potential antiviral targets. Altogether, our study suggests that the PI3K/AKT kinase inhibitor drugs may be a promising anti-SARS-CoV-2 strategy for clinical application, especially for managing cancer patients with COVID-19 in the pandemic era.","Sun, Fang; Mu, Chenglin; Kwok, Hang Fai; Xu, Jiyuan; Wu, Yingliang; Liu, Wanhong; Sabatier, Jean-Marc; Annweiler, Cédric; Li, Xugang; Cao, Zhijian; Xie, Yingqiu",Int J Biol Sci,189,16

The coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) has introduced many concerns surrounding access to opioid treatment. In March 2020, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) issued guidance allowing for the expansion of take-home methadone doses. We sought to describe changes to treatment experiences from the perspective of persons receiving methadone at outpatient treatment facilities for OUD. METHODS: We conducted an in-person survey among 104 persons receiving methadone from three clinics in central North Carolina in June and July 2020. Surveys collected information on demographic characteristics, methadone treatment history, and experiences with take-home methadone doses in the context of COVID-19 (i.e., before and since March 2020). RESULTS: Before COVID-19, the clinic-level percent of participants receiving any amount of days' supply of take-home doses at each clinic ranged from 56% to 82%, while it ranged from 78% to 100% since COVID-19. The clinic-level percent of participants receiving a take-homes days' supply of a week or longer (i.e., &#8805;6 days) since COVID-19 ranged from 11% to 56%. Among 87 participants who received take-homes since COVID-19, only four reported selling their take-home doses. CONCLUSIONS: Our study found variation in experiences of take-home dosing by clinic and little diversion of take-home doses. While SAMSHA guidance should allow expanded access to take-home doses, adoption of these guidelines may vary at the clinic level. The adoption of these policies should be explored further, particularly in the context of benefits to patients seeking OUD treatment.","Figgatt, Mary C; Salazar, Zach; Day, Elizabeth; Vincent, Louise; Dasgupta, Nabarun",J Subst Abuse Treat,189,20

As of January 2020, cases of 2019-nCoV are continuing to be reported in other Eastern Asian countries as well as in the United States, Europe, Australia, and numerous other countries. An unusually high volume of domestic and international travel corresponding to the beginning of the 2020 Chinese New Year complicated initial identification and containment of infected persons. Due to the rapidly rising number of cases and reported deaths, all countries should be considered at risk of imported 2019-nCoV. Therefore, it is essential for prehospital, clinic, and emergency department personnel to be able to rapidly assess 2019-nCoV risk and take immediate actions if indicated. The Identify-Isolate-Inform (3I) Tool, originally conceived for the initial detection and management of Ebola virus and later adjusted for other infectious agents, can be adapted for any emerging infectious disease. This paper reports a modification of the 3I Tool for use in the initial detection and management of patients under investigation for 2019-nCoV. After initial assessment for symptoms and epidemiological risk factors, including travel to affected areas and exposure to confirmed 2019-nCoV patients within 14 days, patients are classified in a risk-stratified system. Upon confirmation of a suspected 2019-nCoV case, affected persons must immediately be placed in airborne infection isolation and the appropriate public health agencies notified. This modified 3I Tool will assist emergency and primary care clinicians, as well as out-of-hospital providers, in effectively managing persons with suspected or confirmed 2019-nCoV.","Koenig, Kristi L; Beÿ, Christian K; McDonald, Eric C",West J Emerg Med,189,21

However, enterocytes at the villus tips revealed epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in the jejunum in which E-cadherin expression decreased while expression of N-cadherin, vimentin, and Snail increased. Additionally, there was reduced expression of actin in microvilli and Zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) in tight junctions. Moreover, the protein concentration of transforming growth factor ß1 (TGFß1), which mediates EMT and cytoskeleton alteration, was increased. We also found a decreased number of Peyer's patch M cells in the ileum.

However, intervention studies that verify whether recommended ventilation targets can be achieved in practice with reasonable ventilation regimes and that are also suitable for countries with cold winters are practically non-existent. To explore the initial situation in Switzerland we carried out carbon dioxide (CO2) measurements during the winter in 100 classrooms, most of which (94%) had natural window ventilation. In more than two thirds of those, the hygienic limit value of 2000 ppm specified for CO2 in the Swiss Standard SN 520180 (2014) was exceeded. To improve ventilation behavior, an intervention was implemented in 23 classrooms during the heating season. Ventilation was performed exclusively during breaks (to avoid discomfort from cold and drafts), efficiently, and only for as long as was necessary to achieve the ventilation objective of compliance with the hygienic limit value (strategic ventilation). The intervention included verbal and written instructions, awareness-raising via a school lesson and an interactive tool for students, which was also used to estimate the required duration of ventilation. CO2 exposure was significantly reduced in pilot classes (Wilcoxon signed-rank test, p = 3.815e-06). Median CO2 levels decreased from 1600 ppm (control group) to 1097 ppm (intervention group), and the average proportion of teaching time at 400-1400 ppm CO2 increased from 40% to 70%. The duration of ventilation was similar to spontaneous natural window ventilation (+5.8%). Stricter ventilation targets are possible. The concept of the intervention is suitable for immediate adoption in schools with natural window ventilation for a limited period, pending the installation of a mechanical ventilation system. The easy integration of this intervention into everyday school life promotes compliance, which is particularly important during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Vassella, Claudia C; Koch, Jeremy; Henzi, Alexander; Jordan, Alexander; Waeber, Roger; Iannaccone, Reto; Charrière, Roland",Int J Hyg Environ Health,189,23

Comprehensive palliative care should be an explicit part of both national and global COVID-19 response plans. Therefore, we aimed to identify, review, and compare national and international COVID-19 guidance for nursing homes concerning palliative care, issued by government bodies and professional associations. We performed a directed documentary and content analysis of newly developed or adapted COVID-19 guidance documents from across the world. Documents were collected via expert consultation and independently screened against prespecified eligibility criteria. We applied thematic analysis and narrative synthesis techniques. We identified 21 eligible documents covering both nursing homes and palliative care, from the World Health Organization (n = 3), and eight individual countries: U.S. (n = 7), The Netherlands (n = 2), Ireland (n = 1), U.K. (n = 3), Switzerland (n = 3), New Zealand (n = 1), and Belgium (n = 1). International documents focused primarily on infection prevention and control, including only a few sentences on palliative care-related topics. Palliative care themes most frequently mentioned across documents were end-of-life visits, advance care planning documentation, and clinical decision making toward the end of life (focusing on hospital transfers). There is a dearth of comprehensive international COVID-19 guidance on palliative care for nursing homes. Most have a limited focus both regarding breadth of topics and recommendations made. Key aspects of palliative care, that is, symptom management, staff education and support, referral to specialist services or hospice, and family support, need greater attention in future guidelines.","Gilissen, Joni; Pivodic, Lara; Unroe, Kathleen T; Block, Lieve Van den",J. pain symptom manage,189,30

The effect of these restrictions is unknown, given that beauty services are widely used for stress relief or to enhance confidence. The current study explored the relationship between engagement in appearance-focused behaviors and distress regarding beauty service closure. Participants with high and low levels of dysmorphic concern were compared to determine whether COVID-19 restrictions may affect these groups differently. METHOD: An online survey was completed by 216 participants living in Australia. Questions addressed engagement in appearance-focused behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic and attitudes toward beauty service closure. The Dysmorphic Concern Questionnaire (DCQ) was used to group participants by low and high dysmorphic concern. RESULTS: Appearance-focused behaviors decreased in the low DCQ group (n = 163) during the COVID-19 pandemic, while such behaviors in the high DCQ group (n = 53) remained unchanged. Individuals who were living alone, younger, reported higher dysmorphic concern and greater distress over beauty service closure engaged in more frequent appearance-focused behaviors (R2 = .57, p < .001). The high DCQ group reported greater distress over beauty service closure and increased desire to obtain future beauty treatments. DISCUSSION: While COVID-19 restrictions may have provided a break from societal appearance pressure for those with low dysmorphic concern, appearance-focused behaviors persisted in individuals with high dysmorphic concern. A greater understanding of the long-term impacts on appearance-related distress is needed to determine mental health priorities emerging from the COVID-19 pandemic.","Pikoos, Toni D; Buzwell, Simone; Sharp, Gemma; Rossell, Susan L",Int. j. eat. disord,189,1

The translation of these signals into tissue-specific responses is crucial for metamorphosis, but the mechanisms that confer specificity to systemic ecdysone pulses are far from understood. Here, we identify Bric-à-brac 2 (Bab2) as an ecdysone-responsive transcriptional repressor that controls temporal gene expression during larval to pupal transition. Bab2 is necessary to terminate Salivary gland secretion (Sgs) gene expression, while premature Bab2 expression blocks Sgs genes and causes precocious salivary gland histolysis. The timely expression of bab2 is controlled by the ecdysone-responsive transcription factor Broad, and manipulation of EcR/USP/Broad signaling induces inappropriate Bab2 expression and termination of Sgs gene expression.

C-reactive protein (CRP) is a sensitive marker for tissue damage and inflammation but Procalcitonin (PCT) has greater specificity for bacterial infection. Limited research exists regarding the use of CRP and PCT at term pregnancy and the immediate postpartum period. AIM: This study sought to define reference values for CRP and PCT at term and the early postnatal period. METHODS: A prospective cross-sectional study was performed in a university teaching hospital. Venous blood was collected from healthy women (n=196), aged between 19-45 years with an uncomplicated singleton pregnancy, at term (37-40 weeksâ gestation) and on day 1 and day 3 postpartum for the measurement of CRP and PCT. RESULTS: The reference population comprised of 189 participants: term pregnancy (n=51), postpartum day 1 vaginal delivery (VD, n=70) and caesarean section (CS, n=38) and day 3 (CS, n=30). The maximum PCT value at term pregnancy was 0.1Âµg/L. On day 1 postpartum, 90% and 86.8% of PCT results for VD and CS respectively were below the decision-threshold of 0.25 Âµg/L. The specificity of PCT to rule out infection in the reference population was 91.5%. CONCLUSIONS: Reference values for PCT were established in a well-characterised population of healthy pregnant women at term and immediately postpartum. The variability of CRP limits its clinical utility in the assessment of systemic sepsis. Application of the PCT cut-off of 0.25 Âµg/L in this population will be a valuable adjunct to clinicians ruling out infection in pregnancy and postpartum.","Joyce, Caroline; Deasy, Shane; Abu, Hala; Yin Lim, Yoke; O039,; Shea, Paula; Donoghue, Keelin",Ann Clin Biochem,189,2

Such coding is usually done manually in hospitals but could potentially be automated to improve the efficiency and accuracy of medical coding. Recent studies on deep learning for automated medical coding achieved promising performances. However, the explainability of these models is usually poor, preventing them to be used confidently in supporting clinical practice. Another limitation is that these models mostly assume independence among labels, ignoring the complex correlation among medical codes which can potentially be exploited to improve the performance. We propose a Hierarchical Label-wise Attention Network (HLAN), which aimed to interpret the model by quantifying importance (as attention weights) of words and sentences related to each of the labels. Secondly, we propose to enhance the major deep learning models with a label embedding (LE) initialisation approach, which learns a dense, continuous vector representation and then injects the representation into the final layers and the label-wise attention layers in the models. We evaluated the methods using three settings on the MIMIC-III discharge summaries: full codes, top-50 codes, and the UK NHS COVID-19 shielding codes. Experiments were conducted to compare HLAN and LE initialisation to the state-of-the-art neural network based methods. HLAN achieved the best Micro-level AUC and $F_1$ on the top-50 code prediction and comparable results on the NHS COVID-19 shielding code prediction to other models. By highlighting the most salient words and sentences for each label, HLAN showed more meaningful and comprehensive model interpretation compared to its downgraded baselines and the CNN-based models. LE initialisation consistently boosted most deep learning models for automated medical coding.","Dong, Hang; Su'arez-Paniagua, V'ictor; Whiteley, William; Wu, Honghan",,189,6

Remdesivir (RDV) has shown some promising results in coronavirus disease (COVID-19) albeit with low certainty. Data in kidney transplant recipients (KTR) are still lacking. METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort of 57 moderate to severe COVID-19 positive KTR in a single center who received RDV as a part of COVID-19 management. No dose adjustments were done. The outcomes were measured as acute kidney injury (AKI) recovery; liver function tests abnormalities; other side effects; graft loss and death. RESULTS: The median (inter-quartile range) age of presentation was 44 (31-51) years. The duration from onset of symptoms to RDV initiation was 6 (5-7) days. Thirty-two (56%) cases received RDV on the day of admission. Forty-six (81%) cases were on oxygen support upon initiation of RDV. Thirty-eight (66.6%) cases had acute kidney injury on admission. The median baseline, admission, and 28-day follow-up serum creatinine of the cohort were 1.59 (1.1-2.1), 2.13 (1.3-3.1), and 1.58 (1.05-2.1) mg/dl, respectively. A total of 8(14%) cases died in the study with 1 (1.7%) graft loss. All those cases that died were on oxygen therapy at the time of initiation of RDV. No liver function derangements or any other major adverse events with the drug were reported. CONCLUSION: RDV therapy is safe and clinically feasible in renal transplant recipients as seen in our cohort. Larger clinical registries and randomized clinical trials should be conducted to further explore the efficacy in transplant recipients.","Meshram, Hari S; Kute, Vivek B; Patel, Himanshu; Banerjee, Subho; Navadiya, Vijay; Desai, Sudeep; Rizvi, Syed J; Mishra, Vineet; Chauhan, Sanshriti",Transpl Infect Dis,189,15

By using several experimental approaches, we investigated the potential association between SARS-CoV-2 IgGs recognizing the spike (S) protein receptor-binding domain (RBD), neutralizing antibodies (NtAb) targeting S, and COVID-19 severity. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This unicenter, retrospective, observational study included 51 hospitalized patients (24 at the intensive care unit; ICU). A total of 93 sera from these patients collected at different time points from the onset of symptoms were analyzed. SARS-CoV-2 RBD IgGs were quantitated by ELISA and NtAb50 titers were measured in a GFP reporterbased pseudotyped virus platform. Demographic and clinical data, complete blood counts, as well as serum levels of ferritin, Dimer-D, C reactive protein (CRP), lactose dehydrogenase (LDH), and interleukin-6 (IL-6) were retrieved from clinical charts. RESULTS: The overall correlation between levels of both antibody measurements was good (Rhoâ¯=â¯0.82; Pâ¯=â¯0â¯<â¯0.001). SARS-CoV-2 RBD IgG and NtAb50 levels in sera collected up to day 30 after the onset of symptoms were comparable between ICU and non-ICU patients (P=>0.1). Four ICU patients died; two of these achieved NtAb50 titers &#8805;1/160 while the other two exhibited a 1/80 titer. Very weak (Rho=>0.0-<0.2) or weak (Rho=>0.2-<0.4) correlations were observed between anti-RBD IgGs, NtAb50, and serum levels pro-inflammatory biomarkers.

The comparative performance of psychotherapies for suicidality is unclear because few head-to-head clinical trials have been conducted. Objective: To compare the efficacy of psychotherapies for the treatment of self-harm and suicidality among children and adolescents. Data Sources: Four major bibliographic databases (PubMed, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and Embase) were searched for clinical trials comparing psychotherapy with control conditions from inception to September 2020. Study Selection: Randomized clinical trials comparing psychotherapies for suicidality and/or self-harm with control conditions among children and adolescents were included after a blinded review by 3 independent reviewers (A.B., M.P., and J.W.). Data Extraction and Synthesis: The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) reporting guideline was followed for data abstraction, and the Cochrane risk of bias tool was used to evaluate study-level risk of bias. Data abstraction was performed by 1 reviewer (A.B.) and confirmed by 2 independent blinded reviewers (J.W. and M.P.). Data were analyzed from October 15, 2020, to February 15, 2021. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcomes were dichotomized self-harm and retention in treatment. The secondary outcomes were dichotomized all-cause treatment discontinuation and scores on instruments measuring suicidal ideation and depressive symptoms. Effect sizes were pooled using frequentist random-effects network meta-analysis models to generate summary odds ratios (ORs) and Cohen d standardized mean differences (SMDs). Negative Cohen d SMDs or ORs less than 1 indicated that the treatment reduced the parameter of interest relative to the control condition (eg, signifying a beneficial association with suicidal ideation). Results: The systematic search generated 1272 unique records. Of those, 44 randomized clinical trials (5406 total participants; 4109 female participants [76.0%]) from 49 articles were selected (5 follow-up studies were merged with their primary clinical trials to avoid publication bias). The selected clinical trials spanned January 1, 1995, to December 31, 2020. The median duration of treatment was 3 months (range, 0.25-12.00 months), and the median follow-up period was 12 months (range, 1-36 months). None of the investigated psychotherapies were associated with increases in study withdrawals or improvements in retention in treatment compared with treatment as usual. Dialectical behavioral therapies were associated with reductions in self-harm (OR, 0.28; 95% CI, 0.12-0.64) and suicidal ideation (Cohen d SMD, -0.71; 95% CI, -1.19 to -0.23) at the end of treatment, while mentalization-based therapies were associated with decreases in self-harm (OR, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.15-0.97) and suicidal ideation (Cohen d SMD, -1.22; 95% CI, -2.18 to -0.26) at the end of follow-up. The quality of evidence was downgraded because of high risk of bias overall, heterogeneity, publication bias, inconsistency, and imprecision. Conclusions and Relevance: Although some psychotherapeutic modalities appear to be acceptable and efficacious for reducing self-harm and suicidality among children and adolescents, methodological issues and high risk of bias prevent a consistent estimate of their comparative performance.","Bahji, Anees; Pierce, Matthew; Wong, Jennifer; Roberge, Johanne N; Ortega, Iliana; Patten, Scott",JAMA Netw Open,189,26

However, the question is, how to operationalize the experience of hospitality? Existing literature shows limited concrete service characteristics that lead to a hospitable experience in service environments. This article presents user-centred research into human-related aspects that influence the hospitality experience of guests. Methods/methodology: Four case studies were performed in a public swimming pool and a catering setting. Due to COVID-19 restrictions, in three of the four cases, regular customers of the organizations were approached by email and asked to rate the importance of behaviours related to hospitable service. In the case of the public swimming pool, part of the data was collected prior to closing of the pool, allowing data collection via survey, on site or via email, depending on visitors’ preferences. Results: The results show which non-verbal employee characteristics contribute to the distinctive factors of hospitality, especially observable behaviour. The factors ‘modest appearance’ and ‘representative appearance’ seem to be of medium importance, and the factor ‘paralanguage’ seems to be the least important factor. Practical implications: This article shows that it is possible to identify concrete characteristics of employee behaviour that people associate with hospitality.","Pijls, R.; Groen, B.

Here, we conducted a virologic, molecular, and cellular study of the olfactory neuroepithelium of seven patients with COVID-19 presenting with acute loss of smell. We report evidence that the olfactory neuroepithelium is a major site of SARS-CoV2 infection with multiple cell types, including olfactory sensory neurons, support cells, and immune cells, becoming infected.

Furthermore, we showed that SARS-CoV-2 induced acute anosmia and ageusia in golden Syrian hamsters, lasting as long as the virus remained in the olfactory epithelium and the olfactory bulb. Last, olfactory mucosa sampling from patients showing long-term persistence of COVID-19-associated anosmia revealed the presence of virus transcripts and of SARS-CoV-2-infected cells, together with protracted inflammation.

This study compared the psychiatric status and sleep quality of FHWs during and after the COVID-19 outbreak in China. FHWs who volunteered to work in Hubei province (the COVID-19 epicenter) were assessed at baseline during the COVID-19 outbreak and re-assessed when they returned to their place of origin (Liaoning province) after the COVID-19 outbreak. Participants' psychiatric status and sleep quality were measured with the Symptom CheckList-90 (SCL-90) and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), respectively. A total of 494 FHWs was assessed at baseline and 462 at follow-up assessments. The prevalence of poor psychiatric status was 10.5% at baseline and increased to 14.9% at the follow-up assessment (P = 0.04). The corresponding figures of poor sleep quality at baseline and follow-up assessment were 16.4% and 27.9%, respectively (P < 0.001). Multiple logistic regression analysis found that severe fatigue (p = 0.003, OR = 1.266, 95% CI = 1.081-1.483), poor sleep quality (p < 0.001, OR = 1.283, 95% CI = 1.171-1.405), and history of pre-existing psychiatric disorders (p < 0.001, OR = 5.085, 95% CI = 2.144-12.06) were independently associated with higher odds of poor psychiatric status among the FHWs. Poor psychiatric status and sleep quality were common among FHWs during the COVID-19 outbreak, and the prevalence increased following their volunteer experiences. This suggests a critical need for longer-term psychological support for this subpopulation.","Zhou, Yifang; Ding, Hailong; Zhang, Yifan; Zhang, Baoyan; Guo, Yingrui; Cheung, Teris; Hall, Brian J; Shi, Tieying; Xiang, Yu-Tao; Tang, Yanqing",Transl Psychiatry,189,18

METHODS: This single-site study recruited 18 of 20 study referrals with aortic stenosis undergoing first lifetime SAVR. Subjects completed a home-based type II sleep study. Delirium was assessed postoperative days 1-5. Exact logistic regression was used to determine whether sleep efficiency or apnea/hypopnea index predicts delirium. RESULTS: Of 18 study participants, 15 successfully completed a home sleep study (mean age: 71.7 +/- 8.1 years old; 10 male subjects). Five subjects (33.3%) developed delirium. Preliminary analyses found that greater sleep efficiency was associated with a large reduction in delirium odds but was not statistically significant (OR = 0.31, 95% CI: 0.06, 1.03, p = 0.057). The point estimate of the relationship between apnea/hypopnea index and delirium was not similarly sizeable (OR 1.10, 95% CI: 0.35, 3.37, p = 0.85). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that home type II sleep studies before SAVR are feasible, and they support adequately powered studies investigating type II home sleep studies as a predictor of postoperative delirium and other important postsurgical outcomes.","Oldham, Mark A; Pigeon, Wilfred R; Chapman, Benjamin; Yurcheshen, Michael; Knight, Peter A; Lee, Hochang Benjamin",Gen Hosp Psychiatry,189,16

The aim of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic performance of circulating platelets (PLT)-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) as biomarkers for Sars-Cov-2 infection, by setting a rapid and reliable test on unmanipulated blood samples. PLT-EVs were quantified by flow cytometry on two independent cohorts of Sars-CoV-2+ (n = 69), Sars-Cov-2- (n = 62) hospitalized patients, and healthy controls. Diagnostic performance of PLT-EVs was evaluated by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. PLT-EVs count were higher in Sars-Cov-2+ compared to Sars-Cov-2- patients or HC. ROC analysis of the combined cohorts showed an AUC = 0.79 and an optimal cut-off value of 1472 EVs/µL, with 75% sensitivity and 74% specificity.

However, studies investigating the influence of the PP are currently lacking in these patients. This is the first study to investigate the influence of the PP on the oxygenation and decarboxylation in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: A prospective bicentric study design was used, and in mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients, PP was indicated from a partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood (PaO2)/fraction of inspired oxygen (FIO2) ratio of <200. Patients were left prone for 16 h each. Pressure levels, FIO2, were adjusted to ensure a PaO2 greater than 60 mmHg. Blood gas analyses were performed before (baseline 0.5 h), during (1/2/5.5/9.5/13 h), and after being in the PP (1 h), the circulatory/ventilation parameters were continuously monitored, and lung compliance (LC) was roughly calculated. Responders were defined compared to the baseline value (PaO2/FIO2 ratio increase of &#8805;15%; partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) decrease of &#8805;2%). RESULTS: 13 patients were included and 36 PP sessions were conducted. Overall, PaO2/FIO2 increased significantly in the PP (p < 0.001). Most PaO2/FIO2 responders (29/36 PP sessions, 77%) were identified 9.5 h after turning prone (14% slow responders), while most PaCO2 responders (15/36 PP sessions, 42%) were identified 13 h after turning prone. A subgroup of patients (interval intubation to PP &#8805;3 days) showed less PaO2/FIO2 responders (16% vs. 77%). An increase in PaCO2 and minute ventilation in the PP showed a significant negative correlation (p < 0.001). LC (median before the PP = 38 mL/cm H2O; two patients with LC >80 mL/cm H2O) showed a significant positive correlation with the 28 day survival of patients (p = 0.01). CONCLUSION: The PP significantly improves oxygenation in COVID-19 ARDS patients. The data suggest that they also benefit most from an early PP. A decrease in minute ventilation may result in fewer PaCO2 responders. LC may be a predictive outcome parameter in COVID-19 patients.

However, at present, it has limited treatments. OBJECTIVE: To overcome this issue, we developed an artificial intelligence (AI) model of COVID-19, named EDRnet, to predict in-hospital mortality using a routine blood sample at the time of hospital admission. METHODS: We selected 28 blood biomarkers and used the age and gender information of patients as model inputs. To improve the mortality prediction, we adopted an ensemble approach combining a deep neural network and random forest model. We trained our model with a database of blood samples from 361 COVID-19 patients in Wuhan, China, and applied it to 106 COVID-19 patients in three Korean medical institutions. RESULTS: In the testing datasets, EDRnet provided high sensitivity (100%), specificity (91.35%), and accuracy (91.51%). To extend the number of patient data, we developed a web application (http://beatcovid19.ml/), where anyone can access the model to predict the mortality and can register his or her own blood laboratory results. CONCLUSIONS: Our new AI model, EDRnet, accurately predicts the mortality rate for COVID-19.

How ACE2 binding activates proteolysis of S protein is unknown. Here, using amide hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry and molecular dynamics simulations, we have mapped the S:ACE2 interaction interface and uncovered long-range allosteric propagation of ACE2 binding to sites necessary for host-mediated proteolysis of S protein, critical for viral host entry. Unexpectedly, ACE2 binding enhances dynamics at a distal S1/S2 cleavage site and flanking protease docking site ~27 Å away while dampening dynamics of the stalk hinge (central helix and heptad repeat [HR]) regions ~130 Å away. This highlights that the stalk and proteolysis sites of the S protein are dynamic hotspots in the prefusion state. Our findings provide a dynamics map of the S:ACE2 interface in solution and also offer mechanistic insights into how ACE2 binding is allosterically coupled to distal proteolytic processing sites and viral-host membrane fusion.

To investigate whether differences in the upper airway immune response could contribute to this disparity, we compared nasopharyngeal gene expression in 83 children (<19-years-old; 38 with SARS-CoV-2, 11 with other respiratory viruses, 34 with no virus) and 154 adults (>40-years-old; 45 with SARS-CoV-2, 28 with other respiratory viruses, 81 with no virus). Expression of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) was robustly activated in both children and adults with SARS-CoV-2 compared to the respective non-viral groups, with only relatively subtle distinctions. Children, however, demonstrated markedly greater upregulation of pathways related to B cell and T cell activation and proinflammatory cytokine signaling, including TNF, IFN{gamma}, IL-2 and IL-4 production. Cell type deconvolution confirmed greater recruitment of B cells, and to a lesser degree macrophages, to the upper airway of children. Only children exhibited a decrease in proportions of ciliated cells, the primary target of SARS-CoV-2, upon infection with the virus. These findings demonstrate that children elicit a more robust innate and adaptive immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection in the upper airway that likely contributes to their protection from severe disease in the lower airway.","Mick, Eran; Tsitsiklis, Alexandra; Spottiswoode, Natasha; Caldera, Saharai; Serpa, Paula Hayakawa; Detweiler, Angela M; Neff, Norma; Pisco, Angela Oliveira; Li, Lucy M; Retallack, Hanna; Ratnasiri, Kalani; Williamson, Kayla M; Soesanto, Victoria; Simões, Eric AF; Kistler, Amy; Wagner, Brandie D; DeRisi, Joseph L; Ambroggio, Lilliam; Mourani, Peter M; Langelier, Charles",,189,20

Whether this decrease is associated with more severe MI, e.g. MI-CS, is unknown. We aimed to examine the association of Corona virus disease (COVID-19) pandemic and incidence of acute myocardial infarction with cardiogenic shock (MI-CS). Methods: On March 11, 2020, the Danish government announced national lock-down. Using Danish nationwide registries, we identified patients hospitalized with MI-CS. Incidence rates (IR) and incidence rate ratios (IRR) were used to compare MI-CS before and after March 11 in 2015-2019 and in 2020. Results: We identified 11,769 patients with MI of whom 696 (5.9%) had cardiogenic shock in 2015-2019. In 2020, 2,132 MI patients were identified of whom 119 had cardiogenic shock (5.6%). The IR per 100,000 person years before March 11 in 2015-2019 was 9.2 (95% CI: 8.3-10.2) and after 8.9 (95% CI: 8.0-9.9). In 2020, the IR was 7.5 (95% CI: 5.8-9.7) before March 11 and 7.7 (95% CI: 6.0-9.9) after. The IRRs comparing the 2020-period with the 2015-2019 period before and after March 11 (lockdown) were 0.81 (95% CI: 0.59-1.12) and 0.87 (95% CI: 0.57-1.32), respectively. The IRR comparing the 2020-period during and before lockdown was 1.02 (95% CI: 0.74-1.41). No difference in 7-day mortality or in-hospital management was observed between study periods. Conclusion: We could not identify a significant association of the national lockdown on the incidence of MI-CS, along with similar in-hospital management and mortality in patients with MI-CS.","Lauridsen, M D; Butt, J H; Østergaard, L; Møller, J E; Hassager, C; Gerds, T; Kragholm, K; Phelps, M; Schou, M; Torp-Pedersen, C; Gislason, G; Køber, L; Fosbøl, E L",Int J Cardiol Heart Vasc,189,20

AIM: To determine the real incidence of CMV hepatitis using more specific diagnostic tools as those currently used before. METHODS: Retrospective/prospective study conducted in a hepatic transplant unit from 2009 to 2019. LT recipients with CMV specific or suggestive elements in histopathology of hepatic biopsies were included. Immunohistochemistry (IHQ) was performed in tissue samples of the studied cohort as well as in a control one. RESULTS: 41 patients met the inclusion criteria. IHQ was diagnostic in 6 (14.6%), and was negative in 100% of the control population. The negative predictive value of the histopathology for CMV hepatitis diagnosis was 100% and the positive predictive value was 14.6%. 85% of patients in whom the IHQ was negative had alternative diagnosis Antiviral therapy in the retrospective analysis was indicated in 48% of patients and in 21% of the prospectively analyzed cohort. CONCLUSIONS: Histopathology and IHQ combination improves the diagnostic accuracy of CMV hepatitis which translates into a rational us of expensive antiviral therapy and to search for differential diagnosis.","Prieto, Jimena; Masllorens, Ana; Ardao, Gonzalo; Machado, Viviana; López, Martin; Gerona, Solange; Medina, Julio",Rev Chilena Infectol,189,16

High rate of infection due to the lethal virus has caused major sufferings and premature deaths to many budding possibilities. Nevertheless, quick identification of the disease can lead to faster recovery with medical help. Unfortunately, the ratio of COVID infection to methods of early medical identification of disease is quite feeble. This has motivated researchers in designing computer aided diagnosis (CAD) systems which can identify the disease from easily available chest X-Ray images of patients. However, the success rate of identification of COVID cases is not satisfactory since the proposed systems are emphasizing on identifying pneumonia rather than separating the cause of it as COVID or non COVID. In this paper, the authors have investigated the cause of such misclassification and have identified feature generalization as one of the reasons. A feature fusion based approach is proposed by the authors to encourage generalization of input features to CAD for better identification of COVID 19. The reason for proposing the fusion based feature formation is encompassing diverse X-Ray image information by extracting descriptors with assorted techniques and uniting them with fusion. The classification results with fusion based approach have reported substantial improvements compared to individual techniques. This in turn indicates better generalization of input features with feature fusion.","Das, R.; Arshad, M.; Manjhi, P. K.; Thepade, S.

Methods This single-center retrospective cohort study was part of a quality improvement program evaluating safety and efficacy of anticoagulation protocols at our large, metropolitan public hospital. We implemented a D-dimer-based guideline for dosing unfractionated heparin (UFH) or low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) in COVID-19 hospitalized patients that allowed for up-titration from standard prophylactic dosing to escalated prophylactic dosing or therapeutic dosing based on patient risk and presence of known or highly suspected VTE. Primary endpoints were International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH)-defined major and clinically relevant non-major bleeding (CRNMB) events and in-hospital survival. Findings Among 262 COVID-19-infected patients hospitalized between March 15th and June 15th, 2020, 125 (73.1%) were male. Highest anticoagulation dose was: 65.3% prophylactic, 13.4% escalated prophylactic, 21.4% therapeutic. The dose was uptitrated in 83 (31.6%) patients. Bleeding events were comparable between the therapeutic (12.5%) and escalated prophylactic groups (11.4%), but significantly higher than in the prophylactic group (1.2%). In-hospital survival at 28 days was superior among patients whose anticoagulation was uptitrated to either escalated prophylactic or therapeutic (77.6%), compared to those receiving fixed prophylactic (56.7%) or fixed therapeutic (26.7%) dosing (p = 0.001). Conclusion A dynamic, D-dimer based dose escalation of anticoagulation for hospitalized patients with COVID-19 may improve in-hospital mortality without increasing fatal bleeding.","Bhoopat, Lantarima; Martynova, Anastasia; Choi, April; Pattaranithima, Pattharawin; Han, Semi; Du, Senxi; Syed, Ibrahim; Chan, Catherine; Oh, Esther E.; Borok, Zea; Liebler, Janice; Lee Wilson, Melissa; Tantiyavarong, Pichaya; O'Connell, Casey",,189,21

In contrast, highly pathogenic hCoVs such as severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV) predominantly infect lower airways and cause fatal pneumonia. Severe pneumonia caused by pathogenic hCoVs is often associated with rapid virus replication, massive inflammatory cell infiltration and elevated pro-inflammatory cytokine/chemokine responses resulting in acute lung injury (ALI), and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Recent studies in experimentally infected animal strongly suggest a crucial role for virus-induced immunopathological events in causing fatal pneumonia after hCoV infections.

BACKGROUND: As frontline workers amidst the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) pandemic, nurses have been subject to stressors at home and at work. METHOD: This quantitative, cross‐sectional study included 896 nurses with at least one child below 18 years of age. Using purposive sampling, participants answered an online survey composed of demographic questions, perception of COVID‐19 health risks, measures of self‐efficacy, general stress and parenting stress. Bivariate correlation and multiple regression were conducted. Data were collected from July 13 to August 13, 2020. RESULTS: The four predictors, along with eight demographic covariates, accounted for 40% of the variance in general stress. Parenting stress and COVID‐19 health risks were positively related to general stress, while self‐efficacy was negatively associated with general stress. CONCLUSIONS: Results highlight the negative influence of parenting stress on nurses' general stress and the importance of self‐efficacy in reducing stress.

The current research identifies a novel coping strategy to strengthen individuals' psychological resilience against the pandemic. Study 1 (N = 210) and Study 2 (N = 93) showed significant beneficial effect of representing oneself via avatar in social virtual world (SVW) on the psychological resilience towards contracting COVID-19. Study 2 also showed that this effect is explained by the disembodied (i.e., out-of-body) experience one encounters in the SVW by digitally representing oneself via an avatar), which enables SVW users to project themselves onto a character in a parallel world that is immune to the COVID-19 virus, thus alleviating the anxiety of contracting the virus themselves in the real world. Additionally, it ruled out alternate explanations like escapism and enjoyment. The findings extend the Proteus effect (i.e., individuals behaviorally conform with their avatar's visual/physical appearance) to a more innate feature of the avatar–its imperviousness from the human body's limitations.

This finding reflects previous research that showed IBD patients using systemic medication were at an increased risk of serious infection. However, although at an increased risk of hospitalization, clinical course of severe COVID-19 was comparable to hospitalized patients without IBD.","Creemers, Rob H.; Rezazadeh Ardabili, Ashkan; Jonkers, Daisy M.; Leers, Mathie P.

Grandparent-headed kinship families receive financial assistance, which may mitigate material hardship and reduce child neglect risk. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to examine (1) the association between material hardship and child neglect risk; and (2) whether financial assistance moderates this association in a sample of kinship grandparent-headed families during COVID-19. PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: Cross-sectional survey data were collected from a convenience sample of grandparent-headed kinship families (not necessarily child welfare involved) (N = 362) in the United States via Qualtrics Panels online survey. METHODS: Descriptive, bivariate, and negative binomial regression were conducted using STATA 15.0. RESULTS: Experiencing material hardship was found to be associated with an increased risk of child neglect, and receiving financial assistance was associated with a decreased risk of child neglect in the full sample and a subsample with household income > $30,000. Receiving financial assistance buffered the negative effect of material hardship on child neglect risk across analytic samples, and receiving SNAP was a significant moderator in the full sample. Among families with a household income ≤ $30,000, receiving SNAP and foster care payments was associated with a decreased risk of child neglect, while receiving TANF and unemployment insurance was associated with an increased risk of child neglect. Among families with household income > $30,000, only receiving SNAP was associated with a decreased risk of child neglect. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests the potential importance of providing concrete financial assistance, particularly SNAP and foster care payments, to grandparent-headed kinship families in efforts to decrease child neglect risk during COVID-19.","Xu, Yanfeng; Jedwab, Merav; Soto-Ramírez, Nelís; Levkoff, Sue E.; Wu, Qi",Child Abuse Negl,189,1

However, vaccine responses are often suboptimal in this age group and few people over the age of 80 years were included in vaccine registration trials. We determined the serological and cellular response to spike protein in 100 people aged 80–96 years at 2 weeks after the second vaccination with the Pfizer BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine. Antibody responses were seen in every donor with high titers in 98%. Spike-specific cellular immune responses were detectable in only 63% and correlated with humoral response. Previous SARS-CoV-2 infection substantially increased antibody responses after one vaccine and antibody and cellular responses remained 28-fold and 3-fold higher, respectively, after dual vaccination. Post-vaccine sera mediated strong neutralization of live Victoria infection and although neutralization titers were reduced 14-fold against the P.1 variant first discovered in Brazil they remained largely effective. These data demonstrate that the mRNA vaccine platform delivers strong humoral immunity in people up to 96 years of age and retains broad efficacy against the P.1 variant of concern.","Parry, Helen; Tut, Gokhan; Bruton, Rachel; Faustini, Sian; Stephens, Christine; Saunders, Philip; Bentley, Christopher; Hilyard, Katherine; Brown, Kevin; Amirthalingam, Gayatri; Charlton, Sue; Leung, Stephanie; Chiplin, Emily; Coombes, Naomi S; Bewley, Kevin R; Penn, Elizabeth J; Rowe, Cathy; Otter, Ashley; Watts, Rosie; D'Arcangelo, Silvia; Hallis, Bassam; Makin, Andrew; Richter, Alex; Zuo, Jianmin; Moss, Paul",eLife,189,1

We examined the effect of 12 most commonly occurring mutations in the receptor binding domain on its expression, stability, activity, and antibody escape potential-some of the factors that may influence the natural selection of mutants. Recombinant proteins were expressed in human cells. Stability was measured using thermal denaturation melts. Activity and antibody escape potential were measured using isothermal titration calorimetry in terms of binding to ACE2 and to a neutralizing human antibody CC12.1, respectively. Our results show that variants differ in their expression levels with the two least stable variants showing lesser expression. Out of the 8 well-expressed mutants, only 2 (N501Y and K417T/E484K/N501Y) showed stronger affinity to ACE2, 4 (Y453F, S477N, T478I and S494P) have similar affinity, whereas the other 2 (K417N and E484K) have weaker affinity when compared to the wild-type. In terms of CC12.1 binding, when compared to the wild-type, 4 variants (K417N, Y453F, N501Y and K417T/E484K/N501Y) have weaker affinity, 2 (S477N and S494P) have similar affinity, and 2 (T478I and E484K) have stronger affinity. Taken together, these results indicate that multiple factors contribute towards the natural selection of variants, and all these factors need be considered to understand the evolution of the virus. In addition, since not all variants can escape a given neutralizing antibody, antibodies to treat new variants can be chosen based on the specific mutations in that variant.","Upadhyay, Vaibhav; Lucas, Alexandra; Panja, Sudipta; Miyauchi, Ryuki; Mallela, Krishna M.G.",bioRxiv,189,1

METHODS: Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched through April 23, 2020. The primary efficacy endpoints were the rate of complete response, in the acute (0–24 h post-chemotherapy), delayed (24–120 h post-chemotherapy), and overall (0–120 h post-chemotherapy) phases. The secondary efficacy endpoints were the rates of no nausea and no emesis, for each phase. Safety endpoints were the rate of no serious adverse events (i.e., no grade 3 or 4 toxicities), as assessed by Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) criteria. The Mantel-Haenszel, random-effects analysis model was used to compute risk ratios and accompanying 95% confidence intervals for each endpoint. For endpoints that statistically favored one arm, absolute risk differences were computed to assess whether there is a 10% or greater difference, used as the threshold for clinical significance by MASCC/ESMO. Fragility indices were also calculated for each statistically significant endpoint, to quantitatively assess the robustness of the summary estimate. A cumulative meta-analysis was conducted for each efficacy meta-analysis with more than 5 studies, also using the Mantel-Haenszel random-effects analysis model. RESULTS: Three studies reported on olanzapine for the rescue of breakthrough chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV); 22 studies reported on olanzapine in the prophylactic setting. For studies reporting on HEC patients, olanzapine-containing regimens were statistically and clinically superior in seven of nine efficacy endpoints in the prophylaxis setting. When olanzapine is administered at a 10-mg dose, it is statistically and clinically superior to control patients in eight of nine endpoints among adults. Olanzapine may be effective in the MEC setting and when administered at 5-mg doses, but the paucity of data leads to notable uncertainty. CONCLUSION: Further RCTs are needed in the setting of MEC patients and administration of olanzapine at a lower 5-mg dose, which may be given to reduce the sedative effect of olanzapine at 10 mg.

Herein, we investigated the antinociceptive effects of Spirulina in different rodent behavior models of inflammatory pain. Male Swiss mice were treated with Spirulina (3–300 mg/kg, p.o.), indomethacin (10 mg/kg, p.o.), or vehicle (0.9% NaCl 10 mL/kg). Behavioral tests were performed with administration of acetic acid (0.6%, i.p.), formalin 2.7% (formaldehyde 1%, i.pl.), menthol (1.2 µmol/paw, i.pl.), cinnamaldehyde (10 nmol/paw, i.pl.), capsaicin (1.6 µg/paw, i.pl.), glutamate (20 µmol/paw, i.pl.), or naloxone (1 mg/kg, i.p.). The animals were also exposed to the rotarod and open field test to determine possible effects of Spirulina on locomotion and motor coordination. The quantitative phytochemical assays exhibited that Spirulina contains significant concentrations of total phenols and flavonoid contents, as well as it showed a powerful antioxidant effect with the highest scavenging activity. Oral administration of Spirulina completely inhibited the abdominal contortions induced by acetic acid (ED(50) = 20.51 mg/kg). Spirulina treatment showed significant inhibition of formalin-induced nociceptive behavior during the inflammatory phase, and the opioid-selective antagonist markedly blocked this effect. Furthermore, our data indicate that the mechanisms underlying Spirulina analgesia appear to be related to its ability to modulate TRMP8 and TRPA1, but not by TRPV1 or glutamatergic system. Spirulina represents an orally active and safe natural analgesic that exhibits great therapeutic potential for managing inflammatory pain disorders.","Freitas, Mariana A.; Vasconcelos, Amanda; Gonçalves, Elaine C.

In order to obtain the maximum benefit from these efforts, approaches to wastewater monitoring need to be rapid, sensitive, and relatable to relevant epidemiological parameters. In this study, we present an ultracentrifugation-based method for the concentration of SARS-CoV-2 wastewater RNA and use crAssphage, a bacteriophage specific to the human gut, to help account for RNA loss during transit in the wastewater system and sample processing. With these methods, we were able to detect, and sometimes quantify, SARS-CoV-2 RNA from 20 mL wastewater samples within as little as 4.5 hours. Using known concentrations of bovine coronavirus RNA and deactivated SARS-CoV-2, we estimate recovery rates of approximately 7-12% of viral RNA using our method. Results from 24 sewersheds across Upstate New York during the spring and summer of 2020 suggested that stronger signals of SARS-CoV-2 RNA from wastewater may be indicative of greater COVID-19 incidence in the represented service area approximately one week in advance. SARS-CoV-2 wastewater RNA was quantifiable in some service areas with daily positives tests of less than 1 per 10,000 people or when weekly positive test rates within a sewershed were as low as 1.7%. crAssphage DNA concentrations were significantly lower during periods of high flow in almost all areas studied. After accounting for flow rate and population served, crAssphage levels per capita were estimated to be about 1.35 × 10(11) and 2.42 × 10(8) genome copies per day for DNA and RNA, respectively. A negative relationship between per capita crAssphage RNA and service area size was also observed likely reflecting degradation of RNA over long transit times. Our results reinforce the potential for wastewater surveillance to be used as a tool to supplement understanding of infectious disease transmission obtained by traditional testing and highlight the potential for crAssphage co-detection to improve interpretations of wastewater surveillance data.","Wilder, Maxwell L.; Middleton, Frank; Larsen, David A.; Du, Qian; Fenty, Ariana; Zeng, Teng; Insaf, Tabassum; Kilaru, Pruthvi; Collins, Mary; Kmush, Brittany; Green, Hyatt C.",Water Res X,189,1

However, the mechanism underlying the RES-mediated protection against myocardial infarction has not yet been revealed entirely. In this study, we investigated the protective effects of RES on cardiac function in a rat model of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and the related underlying mechanisms. METHODS: Male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into four groups: Sham (sham operation), Sham-RES, AMI (AMI induction), and AMI-RES. The rat AMI model was established by the permanent ligation of left anterior descending coronary artery method. The rats in the RES-treated groups were gavaged with RES (50 mg/kg/day) daily for 45 days after the Sham operation or AMI induction; rats in the Sham and AMI groups were gavaged with deionized water. Cardiac function was evaluated by echocardiography. Atrial interstitial fibrosis was assessed by hematoxylin-eosin or Masson’s trichrome staining. Real-time PCR and western blotting analyses were performed to examine the levels of signaling pathway components. RESULTS: RES supplementation decreased the inflammatory cytokine levels, improved the cardiac function, and ameliorated atrial interstitial fibrosis in the rats with AMI. Furthermore, RES supplementation inhibited NLRP3 inflammasome activity, decreased the TGF-β1 production, and downregulated the p-SMAD2/SMAD2 expression in the heart. CONCLUSION: RES shows notable cardioprotective effects in a rat model of AMI; the possible mechanisms underlying these effects may involve the improvement of cardiac function and atrial interstitial fibrosis via the RES-mediated suppression of NLRP3 inflammasome activity and inhibition of the TGF-β1/SMAD2 signaling pathway in the heart.","Jiang, Jinjin; Gu, Xiuping; Wang, Huifeng; Ding, Shibin",PeerJ,189,1

The spike (S) protein on the viral envelope mediates human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) binding and thus is the target of a variety of neutralizing antibodies. In this work, we built various S trimer-antibody complex structures on the basis of the fully glycosylated S protein models described in our previous work, and performed all-atom molecular dynamics simulations to get insight into the structural dynamics and interactions between S protein and antibodies. Investigation of the residues critical for S-antibody binding allows us to predict the potential influence of mutations in SARS-CoV-2 variants. Comparison of the glycan conformations between S-only and S-antibody systems reveals the roles of glycans in S-antibody binding. In addition, we explored the antibody binding modes, and the influences of antibody on the motion of S protein receptor binding domains. Overall, our analyses provide a better understanding of S-antibody interactions, and the simulation-based S-antibody interaction maps could be used to predict the influences of S mutation on S-antibody interactions, which will be useful for the development of vaccine and antibody-based therapy.","Cao, Yiwei; Choi, Yeol Kyo; Frank, Martin; Woo, Hyeonuk; Park, Sang-Jun; Yeom, Min Sun; Seok, Chaok; Im, Wonpil",bioRxiv,189,30

The present study further tests the relationship between hyperactivity symptoms and somatic complaints in Chinese male adolescents and explores the underlying moderating and mediating mechanisms. Methods: Our sample included 1,586 males (age = 12–16) recruited as part of an epidemiological study of child and adolescent mental disorders from April to July, 2014. Hyperactivity symptoms and somatic complaints were assessed with Achenbach's Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), and the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire Short Form (CTQ-SF) and Adolescent Life Events Scale (ASLEC) were used to assess exposure to childhood trauma and recent life events. Results: Adolescents with hyperactivity symptoms experienced more emotional abuse, physical abuse, life events, and reported more somatic complaints symptoms (p < 0.0083 or p < 0.05). Linear regression analysis showed that hyperactivity, total childhood trauma score/emotional abuse and sexual abuse and ASLEC score significantly predicted somatic complaints (all p < 0.05). Emotional abuse and life events mediated the relationship between hyperactivity symptoms and somatic complaints. Furthermore, childhood trauma moderated the path between hyperactivity symptoms and ASLEC in the moderation mediation model for predicting somatic complaints (p < 0.05). Conclusions: Hyperactivity symptoms had a significant impact on somatic complaints among Chinese male adolescents. Furthermore, childhood trauma and life events affected the relationship between hyperactivity symptoms and somatic complaints. Interventions for somatic complaints in male adolescents with hyperactivity symptoms should thus consider history of childhood trauma and life events.","Wu, Shuxian; Yang, Tingyu; He, Yuqiong; Cui, Xilong; Luo, Xuerong; Liu, Jianbo",Front Psychiatry,189,16

AVFluIgG01 is a potent and broad-reactive H5N1-neutralizing human monoclonal antibody (mAb) showing great potential for use either for therapeutic purposes or as a basis of vaccine development, but its antigenic epitope and neutralization mechanism have not been finely characterized. In this study, we first demonstrated that AVFluIgG01 targets a novel conformation-dependent epitope in the globular head region of H5N1 hemagglutinin (HA). By selecting mimotopes from a random peptide library in combination with computational algorithms and site-directed mutagenesis, the epitope was mapped to three conserved discontinuous sites (I-III) that are located closely at the three-dimensional structure of HA. Further, we found that this HA1-specific human mAb can efficiently block both virus-receptor binding and post-attachment steps, while its Fab fragment exerts the post-attachment inhibition only. Consistently, AVFluIgG01 could inhibit HA-mediated cell-cell membrane fusion at a dose-dependent manner and block the acquisition of pH-induced protease sensitivity. These results suggest a neutralization mechanism of AVFluIgG01 by simultaneously blocking viral attachment to the receptors on host cells and interfering with HA conformational rearrangements associated with membrane fusion. The presented data provide critical information for developing novel antiviral therapeutics and vaccines against HPAI H5N1 virus.","Cao, Zhiliang; Meng, Jiazi; Li, Xingxing; Wu, Ruiping; Huang, Yanxin; He, Yuxian",PLoS One,189,24

A multi-objective optimization algorithm for cloud computing virtual machine resource allocation method (CC-VMRA method) is proposed, and the application of the IoT and cloud computing technology in the smart city information system is further analysed and simulated for the performance verification. The results show that the multi-objective optimization algorithm in the CC-VMRA method can greatly reduce the number of physical servers in the SCI system (less than 20), and the variance is not higher than 0.0024, which can enable the server cluster to achieve better load balancing effects. In addition, the packet loss rate of the Zigbee protocol used by the IoT gateway in the SCI system is far below the 0.1% indicator, and the delay is less than 10 ms.

Little is known about the effects of a pandemic on the presentation and admission to an outpatient clinic. Our aim was to gain a better understanding of the effects of reduced neurosurgical care access from the patient perspective, especially in terms of anxiety and urgency of treatment, and to improve outpatient management in case of a potential second wave and potential restrictions on health care. Methods: A questionnaire study over a period of four weeks following the COVID-19 lock down at our academical neurosurgical department was performed. A 15-items questionnaire was distributed to the patients with 3 additional questions to be answered by the treating neurosurgeon. Results: A total of 437 questionnaires was analyzed. Overall anxiety to visit a general practitioner or the outpatient facility within the hospital was very low among patients. A quarter of all appointments had to be postponed due to COVID-19, in 0.6 % of which postponement was perceived as incorrect by the treating neurosurgeon. 43% did not get an appointment due to the restrictions, 20 % did not want to bother the medical system and only 4 % were afraid to get infected in the hospital. Conclusion: Despite COVID-19, patients in need of neurosurgical service were hardly afraid to visit doctors and/or hospitals. Nonetheless, due to legal requirements, access has been restricted causing potential collateral damages in a small subset of neurosurgical patients.","Daniel, Pinggera; Johannes, Kerschbaumer; Lukas, Grassner; Matthias, Demetz; Sebastian, Hartmann; Claudius, Thomé",World Neurosurg,189,1

OBJECTIVE: To examine children's obesogenic behaviours during spring and summer of the COVID‐19 pandemic compared to previous data collected from the same children during the same calendar period in the 2 years prior. METHODS: Physical activity and sleep data were collected via Fitbit Charge‐2 in 231 children (7–12 years) over 6 weeks during spring and summer over 3 years. Parents reported their child's screen time and dietary intake via a survey on 2–3 random days/week. RESULTS: Children's behaviours worsened at a greater rate following the pandemic onset compared to pre‐pandemic trends. During pandemic spring, sedentary behaviour increased (+79 min; 95% CI = 60.6, 97.1) and MVPA decreased (−10 min, 95% CI = −18.2, −1.1) compared to change in previous springs (2018–2019). Sleep timing shifted later (+124 min; 95% CI = 112.9, 135.5). Screen time (+97 min, 95% CI = 79.0, 115.4) and dietary intake increased (healthy: +0.3 foods, 95% CI = 0.2, 0.5; unhealthy: +1.2 foods, 95% CI = 1.0, 1.5). Similar patterns were observed during summer. CONCLUSIONS: Compared to pre‐pandemic measures, children's PA, sedentary behaviour, sleep, screen time, and diet were adversely altered during the COVID‐19 pandemic. This may ultimately exacerbate childhood obesity.","Burkart, Sarah; Parker, Hannah; Weaver, R.

To investigate this, we characterized the immunology of neonates born to mothers with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy. Here we show that maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection affects the neonatal immune system. Despite similar proportions of B cells, CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells, increased percentages of natural killer cells, Vδ2+ γδ T cells and regulatory T cells were detected in neonates born to mothers with recent or ongoing infection compared with those born to recovered or uninfected mothers. Increased plasma cytokine levels were also evident in neonates and mothers within the recent or ongoing infection group. Cytokine functionality was enhanced in neonates born to SARS-CoV-2-exposed mothers, compared to those born to uninfected mothers. In most neonates, this immune imprinting was nonspecific, suggesting vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is limited, a finding supported by a lack of SARS-CoV-2-specific IgM in neonates despite maternal IgG transfer.","Gee, Sarah; Chandiramani, Manju; Seow, Jeffrey; Pollock, Emily; Modestini, Carlotta; Das, Abhishek; Tree, Timothy; Doores, Katie J; Tribe, Rachel M; Gibbons, Deena L",Nature immunology,189,16

An adverse event following immunization (AEFI) is defined as any untoward occurrence following immunization, and the majority of AEFIs are caused by protective immune responses stimulated by vaccines. Most of the reported AEFIs are not serious, and many are not immunologically mediated or even reproducible on re-exposure. However, uncommon severe allergic adverse reactions, such as anaphylaxis or other allergic reactions, can occur after vaccinations. Confirmed allergic reactions to vaccines may be caused by residual non-human protein, preservatives, or stabilizers in the vaccine formulation (also known as excipients). There are 2 main potential allergenic/immunogenic excipients in COVID-19 vaccines, polyethylene glycol (PEG) and polysorbate 80. PEG, also known as macrogol, is an ingredient in various laxatives and injectable formulations, such as depot steroids. Polysorbate 80 is present in various medical products, creams, ointments, lotions, and medication tablets. Contraindications to the administration of COVID-19 vaccines include a previous history of severe allergic reactions to the first dose of COVID-19 vaccine or proven hypersensitivity to a vaccine component, such as PEG or polysorbate 80. Anaphylaxis or other allergic reactions following immunization can cause fear and loss of confidence in the safety of vaccines among the public. A better understanding of these events is thought to help alleviate concerns about the current COVID-19 vaccines and provide reassurance to the general population by analyzing the exact incidence of anaphylaxis and potential risk factors. COVID-19 vaccine-associated anaphylaxis could be prevented and managed by risk stratification based on our local and global experience.","Kim, Mi-Ae; Lee, Yong Won; Kim, So Ri; Kim, Joo-Hee; Min, Taek ki; Park, Hae-Sim; Shin, Meeyong; Ye, Young-Min; Lee, Sooyoung; Lee, Jeongmin; Choi, Jeong-Hee; Jang, Gwang Cheon; Chang, Yoon-Seok",Allergy Asthma Immunol Res,189,26

The objective of the study was to evaluate the impact of the application of a non-invasive respiratory support (NIRS) algorithm on clinical outcomes in COVID-19 subjects with acute respiratory failure (ARF).Methods: We performed a single center prospective observational study of subjects with respiratory failure from COVID-19 managed with high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) and CPAP+HFNC (combined therapy). The main outcome was the intubation rate, which defined failure of therapy. We also analyzed the role of the ROX index ([SpO2/FiO2]/respiratory rate) to predict the need for intubation.Results: From June to December 2020, 113 subjects with COVID-19 respiratory failure were admitted to our respiratory intermediate care unit (RICU). HFNC was applied in 65 subjects (57.52%) and combined therapy in 48 (42.47%). A total of 83 subjects (73.45%) were successfully treated with NIRS. The intubation rate was 26.54 %, and overall mortality was 14.15%. Mortality rate in intubated subjects was 55.2%. ROX index of 6.28 at 12 hours predicted NIRS failure, with 97.6% of sensitivity and 51.8% of specificity.Conclusions: Data from our cohort managed on RICU showed that combined NIRS are feasible with favorable outcomes. Further prospective studies are required.","Colaianni-Alfonso, Nicolas; Montiel, Guillermo; Castro-Sayat, Mauro; Siroti, Catalina; Vega, Maria Laura; Toledo, Ada; Haedo, Santiago; Previgliano, Ignacio; Mazzinari, Guido; Alonso-Íñigo, José Miguel",Respiratory care,189,16

RECENT FINDINGS: The paradigm for the optimal management of PAH has shifted in recent years. Upfront combination therapy with an endothelin receptor antagonist and a phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitor is now widely accepted as standard of care. In addition, there is increasing emphasis on starting prostanoids early in order to delay time to clinical worsening. However, less is known regarding which prostanoid agent to initiate and the optimum time to do so. In order to facilitate shared decision-making, there is an increasing need for decision tools based on guidelines and collective clinical experiences to navigate between pharmacologic and interventional treatments, as well as explore innovative, therapeutic pathways for PAH. SUMMARY: The management of PAH has become increasingly complex. With a growing number of PAH-specific therapies, intimate knowledge of the therapeutics and the potential barriers to adherence are integral to providing optimal care for this high-risk patient population. While current PAH-specific therapies largely mediate their effects through pulmonary vasodilation, ongoing research efforts are focused on ways to disrupt the mechanisms leading to pulmonary vascular remodeling. By targeting aberrations identified in the metabolism and proliferative state of pulmonary vascular cells, novel PAH treatment pathways may be just on the horizon.","Mayeux, Jennalyn D.; Pan, Irene Z.; Dechand, John; Jacobs, Joshua A.; Jones, Tara L.; McKellar, Stephen H.; Beck, Emily; Hatton, Nathan D.; Ryan, John J.",Curr Cardiovasc Risk Rep,189,16

Some of them were severe cases presenting with multi-system inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C) causing multiple organ dysfunction. CASE PRESENTATION: We report the case of a 12-year-old girl with recent COVID-19 infection who presented with persistent fever, abdominal pain and other symptoms that meet the definition of MIS-C. She had lymphopenia and a high level of inflammatory markers. She was admitted to pediatric intensive care unit since she rapidly developed refractory catecholamine-resistant shock with multiple organ failure. Echocardiography showed a small pericardial effusion with a normal ejection fraction (Ejection Fraction = 60%) and no valvular or coronary lesions. The child showed no signs of improvement even after receiving intravenous immunoglobulin, fresh frozen plasma, high doses of Vasopressors and corticosteroid. His outcome was fatal. CONCLUSION: Pediatric patients affected by the new COVID-19 related syndrome may show severe life-threatening conditions similar to Kawasaki disease shock syndrome. Hypotension in these patients results from heart failure and the decreased cardiac output. We report a new severe clinical feature of SARS-CoV-2 infection in children in whom hypotension was the result of refractory vasoplegia.","Ajmi, Houda; Besghaier, Wissem; Kallala, Wafa; Trabelsi, Abdelhalim; Abroug, Saoussan",Ital J Pediatr,189,29

Herein we describe the use of an adenovirus vectored mouse IFN alpha gene (mDEF201) as a prophylactic and treatment countermeasure in a SARS-CoV-infected BALB/c mouse model. Complete survival protection was observed in mice given a single dose of mDEF201 administered intranasally 1, 3, 5, 7, or 14 days prior to lethal SARS-CoV challenge (p<0.001), and body weights of these treated mice were unaffected by the challenge. In addition, low doses of mDEF201 protected lungs in a dose dependent manner as measured by a reduction in gross pathology. Intranasal treatment with mDEF201 ranging from 10(6) to 10(8) PFU significantly protected mice against a lethal SARS-CoV infection in a dose dependent manner up to 12 h post infection (P<0.001). The data suggest that mDEF201 is a new class of antiviral agent further development as treatment for SARS-CoV infections.","Kumaki, Yohichi; Ennis, Jane; Rahbar, Ramtin; Turner, Jeffrey D.; Wandersee, Miles K.; Smith, Aaron J.; Bailey, Kevin W.; Vest, Zachary G.; Madsen, Jason R.; Li, Joseph K.-K.; Barnard, Dale L.",Antiviral Research,189,3
