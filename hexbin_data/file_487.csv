5029,Lung ultrasound and B-lines quantification inaccuracy: B sure to have the right solution,2020-03-18,"The primary structure of a cytotoxin from Pseudomonas aeruginosa was determined by sequencing of the structural gene. The cytotoxin (31,700 Mr) lacks an N-terminal signal sequence for bacterial secretion but contains a pentapeptide consensus sequence commonly found in prokaryotic proteins which function in a TonB-dependent manner. The cytotoxin gene has a [G+C]-content of 53.8% which is considerably lower than generally observed for genes from Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The cytotoxin gene was exclusively detected in strain 158 but not in three other clinical isolates, as determined by Southern and Northern hybridization. The latter technique revealed that the toxin is translated from monocistronic mRNA. The promoter of the cytotoxin is inactive in Escherichia coli. Upon site-directed modification of the 5′-noncoding region by the polymerase chain reaction the gene was expressed under control of the trcpromoter. The gene product obtained in Escherichia coli was nontoxic. Toxicity was induced by subsequent treatment with trypsin. [(35)S]methionine-labeled cytotoxin with high specific radioactivity was obtained by in vitro transcription/translation. Like [(125)I] labeled material from Pseudomonas aeruginosa this polypeptide bound to membrane preparations from Ehrlich ascites cells, as evidenced by sedimentation through a sucrose gradient at neutral pH.","Orlik-Eisel, Gabriele; Lutz, Frieder; Henschen, Agnes; Eisel, Ulrich; Struckmeier, Martin; Kräuter, Josef; Niemann, Heiner",Arch Microbiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7087514/,487
5748,Surfactant adjunctive therapy forPneumocystis carinii pneumonitis in an infant with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia,1995,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the etiologies and outcome of acute respiratory failure (ARF) in HIV-infected patients over the first decade of combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) use. METHODS: Retrospective study of all HIV-infected patients (n = 147) admitted to a single intensive care unit (ICU) for ARF between 1996 and 2006. RESULTS: ARF revealed the diagnosis of HIV infection in 43 (29.2%) patients. Causes of ARF were bacterial pneumonia (n = 74), Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP, n = 52), other opportunistic infections (n = 19), and noninfectious pulmonary disease (n = 33); the distribution of causes did not change over the 10-year study period. Two or more causes were identified in 33 patients. The 43 patients on ART more frequently had bacterial pneumonia and less frequently had opportunistic infections (P = 0.02). Noninvasive ventilation was needed in 49 patients and endotracheal intubation in 42. Hospital mortality was 19.7%. Factors independently associated with mortality were mechanical ventilation [odds ratio (OR) = 8.48, P < 0.0001], vasopressor use (OR, 4.48; P = 0.03), time from hospital admission to ICU admission (OR, 1.05 per day; P = 0.01), and number of causes (OR, 3.19; P = 0.02). HIV-related variables (CD4 count, viral load, and ART) were not associated with mortality. CONCLUSION: Bacterial pneumonia and PCP remain the leading causes of ARF in HIV-infected patients in the ART era. Hospital survival has improved, and depends on the extent of organ dysfunction rather than on HIV-related characteristics.","Barbier, François; Coquet, Isaline; Legriel, Stéphane; Pavie, Juliette; Darmon, Michael; Mayaux, Julien; Molina, Jean-Michel; Schlemmer, Benoît; Azoulay, Élie",Intensive Care Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7094937/,487

Subsequently, there was a marked improvement in gas exchange. In order to assess the mechanism for improved oxygenation, computed tomography of the lungs was done. Quantitative analysis of the scans taken before and after surfactant administration indicates that improvement in gas exchange was largely due to the expansion of underinflated and collapsed lung areas. Although this is a single case report, it provides insight into the possible beneficial effect of instilled surfactant in severe respiratory distress from viral pneumonia.","Putz, G.; Hörmann, C.; Koller, W.; Schön, G.",Intensive Care Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7095348/,487
5943,PS 0420-0716,2007-08-25,"The development of the flexible, fiberoptic bronchoscope has made bronchoscopic examinations possible in ICU patients undergoing mechanical ventilation. Over the years, the number of such procedures has greatly increased, with both diagnostic and therapeutic objectives, such as performing difficult intubation, management of atelectasis and hemoptysis, diagnosis of nosocomial pneumonia in ventilated patients, and early detection of airway lesions in selected situations, such as high-frequency ventilation. The complication rate can be kept low if the endoscopist has a precise knowledge of the many pathophysiological and technical facets particular to bronchoscopy under these difficult conditions.

11500,Understanding resistance in Pseudomonas,2020-01-20,"Hypercapnia in combination with hypoxemia is usually present in severe respiratory disease in the intensive care unit (ICU) and can lead to more severe cognitive dysfunction. Increasing evidence has indicated that the compromised blood–brain barrier (BBB) in the hippocampus in hypoxemia conditions can result in cognitive dysfunction. However, the role and underlying mechanism of hypercapnia in the BBB disruption remains poorly known. A rat model of hypercapnia was first established in this study by intubation and mechanical ventilation with a small-animal ventilator. After this, the cognitive function of the experimental rats was assessed by the Morris water maze test. The BBB permeability was evaluated by the Evans Blue (EB) test and brain water content (BWC). Western blot analysis was carried out to detect the protein expressions of total and nuclear hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α), matrixmetalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) and Aquaporins-4 (AQP-4) in the hippocampus tissue. Double immunofluorescence further verified the protein expression of different biomarkers was localized in the astrocytes of the hippocampus. Hypercapnia alone did not disrupt the BBB, but it could further enhance the BBB permeability in hypoxemia. Concomitantly, up-regulation of nuclear HIF-1α, AQP-4, MMP-9 protein expression along with increased degradation of the occludin and claudin-5 proteins was found in the hypercapnia rat model, while the total HIF-1α remained unchanged. Interestingly, these changes were independent of the acidosis induced by hypercapnia. Of note, after premedication of 2-Methoxyestradiol (2ME2, an inhibitor of HIF-1α nuclear translocation), the disrupted BBB could be restored resulting in improvement of the cognitive impairment. Meanwhile, accumulation of nuclear HIF-1α, protein expression of AQP-4 and MMP-9 and protein degradation of the occludin and claudin-5 were decreased. Thus, our study demonstrated that hypercapnia can further disrupt the BBB through promoting HIF-1α nuclear translocation and up-regulation of AQP-4 and MMP-9 in hypoxemia. It is therefore suggested that the cascade of hypercapnia-induced nuclear HIF-1α protein translocation in hypoxia-activated astrocytes may be a potential target for ameliorating cognitive impairment.

12965,Intravenous calcium as a pressor in a swine model of hypoxic pseudo-pulseless electrical mechanical activity—a preliminary report,2020-09-04,"Although mechanical ventilation is a lifesaving treatment, abundant evidence indicates that its prolonged use (1 week or more) promotes respiratory muscle weakness due to both contractile dysfunction and atrophy. Along with the diaphragm, the intercostal muscles are one of the most important groups of respiratory muscles. In recent years, muscular ultrasound has become a useful bedside tool for the clinician to identify patients with respiratory muscle dysfunction related to critical illness and/or invasive mechanical ventilation. Images obtained over the course of illness can document changes in muscle dimension and can be used to estimate changes in function. Recent evidence suggests the clinical usefulness of ultrasound imaging in the assessment of intercostal muscle function. In this narrative review, we summarize the current literature on ultrasound imaging of the parasternal intercostal muscles as used to assess the extent of muscle activation and muscle weakness and its potential impact during discontinuation of mechanical ventilation. In addition, we proposed a practical flowchart based on recent evidence and experience of our group that can be applied during the weaning phase. This approach integrates multiple predictive parameters of weaning success with respiratory muscle ultrasound.","Formenti, Paolo; Umbrello, Michele; Dres, Martin; Chiumello, Davide",Ann Intensive Care,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7475948/,487
14297,Reproducible Single-Cell Genomic Research in Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine,2020-12-01,"OBJECTIVE: Frequent travel between the Southern border states in the USA, Mexico, and Latin American countries increases the risk of the Zika virus (ZIKV) spread. Patient education on virus transmission is fundamental in decreasing the number of imported cases, particularly among pregnant women. METHODS: The study used cross-sectional methodology to investigate information sources and knowledge concerning the ZIKV virus among 300 under-served pregnant Latinas recruited from prenatal care clinics in the North Texas region. Bivariate and multiple logistic regression models were used to investigate associations between the primary outcomes and patient characteristics. RESULTS: Physicians, nurses, and families are the major sources for pregnancy information, while media/internet (65%) and physician/nurse (33%) are the main sources for ZIKV information. Less than one-half of the mothers reported that their physician/nurse did not discuss safe sexual practices or inquired about their sexual practices. A considerable proportion of women from the community clinic were neither warned nor queried about travel to ZIKV risk countries. There is an overall understanding of Zika virus transmission, symptoms, complications, and recommended guidelines. Younger age and single mother status are risk factors for lack of ZIKV knowledge. Foreign-born mothers are 2.5–3.0 times more likely to have knowledge on disease transmission, symptoms, and microcephaly condition. While, younger mothers (18–24) are less likely to have knowledge of ZIKV infection symptoms (fever, rash and pink eye) and transmission of infection via unprotected sexual (vaginal, anal, or oral) behavior, compared to older mothers. CONCLUSIONS: Interventions are needed to heighten the knowledge of ZIKV, particularly among women of reproductive age and their male partners in the community health care setting. Our study underscores the need for health care providers to be trained in delivering messages to enhance risk perception during health emergencies to vulnerable and underserved families (lower economic background, language ability, and culture). During health emergencies, clinics must disseminate crucial information via multi modalities to ensure messages reach the targeted patients.","Ramisetty-Mikler, Suhasini; Boyce, LeAnn",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7679023/,487
14454,Ischaemic stroke-induced distal organ damage: pathophysiology and new therapeutic strategies,2020-12-18,"BACKGROUND: Mechanical ventilation can induce or even worsen lung injury, at least in part via overdistension caused by too large volumes or too high pressures. The complement system has been suggested to play a causative role in ventilator-induced lung injury. AIMS AND METHODS: This was a single-center prospective study investigating associations between pulmonary levels of complement activation products and two ventilator settings, tidal volume (V(T)) and driving pressure (ΔP), in critically ill patients under invasive ventilation. A miniature bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was performed for determination of pulmonary levels of C5a, C3b/c, and C4b/c. The primary endpoint was the correlation between BAL fluid (BALF) levels of C5a and V(T) and ΔP. Levels of complement activation products were also compared between patients with and without ARDS or with and without pneumonia. RESULTS: Seventy-two patients were included. Median time from start of invasive ventilation till BAL was 27 [19 to 34] hours. Median V(T) and ΔP before BAL were 6.7 [IQR 6.1 to 7.6] ml/kg predicted bodyweight (PBW) and 15 [IQR 11 to 18] cm H(2)O, respectively. BALF levels of C5a, C3b/c and C4b/c were neither different between patients with or without ARDS, nor between patients with or without pneumonia. BALF levels of C5a, and also C3b/c and C4b/c, did not correlate with V(T) and ΔP. Median BALF levels of C5a, C3b/c, and C4b/c, and the effects of V(T) and ΔP on those levels, were not different between patients with or without ARDS, and in patients with or without pneumonia. CONCLUSION: In this cohort of critically ill patients under invasive ventilation, pulmonary levels of complement activation products were independent of the size of V(T) and the level of ΔP. The associations were not different for patients with ARDS or with pneumonia. Pulmonary complement activation does not seem to play a major role in VILI, and not even in lung injury per se, in critically ill patients under invasive ventilation.","de Beer, Friso M.; Wieske, Luuk; van Mierlo, Gerard; Wouters, Diana; Zeerleder, Sacha; Bos, Lieuwe D.; Juffermans, Nicole P.; Schultz, Marcus J.; van der Poll, Tom; Lagrand, Wim K.; Horn, Janneke",Intensive Care Med Exp,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7746430/,487
19733,An Introduction to Statistics: Choosing the Correct Statistical Test,2021-05-11,"Few studies have investigated psychosocial characteristics and lifestyle behaviors of participants at programs for secondary prevention of colorectal cancer (CRC). This study aimed, through a comprehensive psychosomatic assessment based on clinimetric principles, to evaluate psychosocial characteristics and lifestyle behaviors in participants at CRC secondary prevention program, and to investigate the associations between these variables and endoscopic outcomes. In this cross-sectional study, the first 150 consecutive asymptomatic participants at the CRC prevention program who resulted positive to fecal occult blood test (FOBT) and were thus referred to colonoscopy, underwent a psychosomatic assessment including psychiatric diagnoses (DSM-5), psychosomatic syndromes (DCPR-R), psychological distress, psychological well-being and lifestyle behaviors. Whereas only 5.3% of the sample showed at least one DSM-5 diagnosis, 51.3% showed at least one DCPR syndrome, such as allostatic overload, alexithymia, Type A behavior, and demoralization. Patients affected by psychosomatic syndromes presented with significantly higher psychological distress, lower psychological well-being and unhealthy lifestyle behaviors, such as tobacco smoking and unhealthy diet, in comparison with patients without DCPR syndromes. Among endoscopic outcomes, the presence of adenomas was significantly associated with DCPR irritable mood. In a clinical context of secondary prevention addressing asymptomatic patients with positive FOBT, a comprehensive psychosomatic assessment may provide relevant clinical information for those patients who present certain psychosomatic syndromes associated with high psychological distress, impaired psychological well-being, unhealthy lifestyle behaviors and colorectal precancerous lesions. The results of the present study indicate a road to the practice of “preventive” medicine at CRC screening program.","Gostoli, Sara; Montecchiarini, Maria; Urgese, Alessia; Ferrara, Francesco; Polifemo, Anna Maria; Ceroni, Liza; Gasparri, Asia; Rafanelli, Chiara; Cennamo, Vincenzo",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8329196/,487

Receptor proteins of the karyopherin family interact with NPC components and transfer their cargos between the nucleus and cytoplasm. Nucleocytoplasmic transport pathways are regulated at multiple levels by modulating the expression or function of individual cargoes, transport receptors, or the transport channel. The regulatory levels have increasingly broad effects on the transport pathways and affect a wide range of processes from gene expression to development and differentiation.","Chumakov, S.

22875,PS 0446-0765,2006-08-24,"Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules play an important role in the immune response of vertebrates. In this paper, full-length MHC IIA cDNA was isolated from swamp eel (Monopterus albus) by rapid amplification of cDNA ends PCR. The genomic structure, molecular polymorphism, tissue distribution, and immune response of the MHC IIA gene to bacterial challenge were investigated. The full-length cDNA (GenBank accession No.: KC616308) is 1,509 bp in length including an 83 bp-long 5′ untranslated region (UTR) and a 709 bp-long 3′ UTR, which encoded a 238 amino acids protein. In the 2,339 bp-long MHC IIA genomic DNA, four exons and three introns were identified. Sequence comparison exhibited that the deduced amino acid sequence shared 27.1–66.3% identity with those of other species. Seven alleles were identified from five healthy individuals. Number of alleles per individual diversified from two to five. Five different 5′ UTR sequences and two different 3′ UTR sequences from one individual may infer the existence of five loci at least. Real-time quantitative PCR demonstrated that swamp eel MHC IIA transcripts were ubiquitously expressed in ten tissues, but the expression level was distinctly different. Significant changes were observed in liver, spleen, kidney and intestine after challenged with pathogenic bacteria Aeromonas hydrophilia.","Li, Wei; Sun, Wen-xiu; Meng, Liang; Hong, Deng-wei",Biologia (Bratisl),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7089440/,487

38378,Effect of withholding early parenteral nutrition in PICU on ketogenesis as potential mediator of its outcome benefit,2020-08-31,"BACKGROUND: There is evidence that males have higher incidence rates (IR) of campylobacteriois than females. The objectives of this study were to determine whether these observations differ between age groups and are consistent over different countries and during different time periods. METHODS: We obtained data on IRs of campylobacteriosis by sex and age group over a period of 11–26 years from seven countries. Male to female incidence rate ratios (IRR) were computed by age group, country and time period. For each age group, we used meta-analytic methods to combine the IRRs. Sensitivity analysis was used to test whether the results are robust to differences between countries and time periods. Meta-regression was conducted to estimate the different effects of age, country, and time period on the IRR. RESULTS: In the age groups < 1, 1–4, 5–9, 10–14, 15–44, 45–64 and 65+ years old, the pooled IRRs (with 95% CI) were 1.31 (1.26–1.37), 1.34 (1.31–1.37), 1.35 (1.32–1.38), 1.73 (1.68–1.79), 1.10 (1.08–1.12), 1.19(1.17–1.21) and 1.27 (1.24–1.30), respectively. For each age group, the excess campylobacteriosis IRs in males differed at different age groups. However, despite some quantitative differences between countries, the excess was consistently present over long time-periods. In meta-regression analysis, age group was responsible for almost all the variation in the IRRs. CONCLUSIONS: The male predominance in campylobacteriosis IRs starts in infancy. This suggests that this is due, at least in part, to physiological or genetic differences and not just behavioural factors. These findings can provide clues to the mechanisms of the infection and could lead to more targeted treatments and vaccine development.","Green, Manfred S.; Schwartz, Naama; Peer, Victoria",BMC Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7445732/,487

OBJECTIVE To evaluate the feasibility, safety, and 6- to 9-mo effectiveness of this new device for the treatment of intracranial wide-necked aneurysms. METHODS Twelve patients (10 females, mean age = 56 yr) with 13 wide-necked intracranial aneurysms (3 ruptured; 10 unruptured) were treated by means of the MED from January 2015 to October 2015. In 15% of the cases, MEDs were used in a standalone fashion; in 85% of the cases, additional regular coils were used. Adjunctive compliant balloon was used in 4 of 13 cases (31%). Procedure-related complications were systematically recorded; discharge and 6- to 9-mo follow-up modified Rankin Scale was assessed. Angiographic follow-up was performed with a mean delay of 5.5 ± 1.7 mo. Occlusion rate was evaluated in postprocedure and at midterm follow-up using the Roy-Raymond scale. RESULTS The deployment of the MED was feasible in all cases. No perforation was recorded. One case of thromboembolic complication was observed in a ruptured anterior communicating artery aneurysm, without any clinical consequence at follow-up. Grade A occlusion rate was 61.5% in postprocedure and 83% at 6-mo follow-up. Two cases (17%) of recanalization were documented angiographically. CONCLUSION The MED is a new generation device combining the design of a detachable coil and an intrasaccular flow disruption device.

62629,Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest-Is International Agreement on Guidelines for Limits of Treatment Possible?,2021-01-01,"BACKGROUND It is unclear which individuals with incomplete spinal cord injury best respond to body-weight-supported treadmill training. OBJECTIVE The purpose of this study was to determine the factors that predict whether a person with motor incomplete spinal cord injury will respond to body-weight-supported treadmill training. DESIGN This was a prognostic study with a one-group pretest-posttest design. METHODS Demographic, clinical, and electrophysiological measurements taken prior to training were examined to determine which measures best predicted improvements in walking speed in 19 individuals with chronic (>7 months postinjury), motor-incomplete spinal cord injuries (ASIA Impairment Scale categories C and D, levels C1-L1). RESULTS Two initial measures correlated significantly with improvements in walking speed: (1) the ability to volitionally contract a muscle, as measured by the lower-extremity manual muscle test (LE MMT) (r=.72), and (2) the peak locomotor electromyographic (EMG) amplitude in the legs (r=.56). None of the demographics (time since injury, age, body mass index) were significantly related to improvements in walking speed, nor was the clinical measure of balance (Berg Balance Scale). Further analysis of LE MMT scores showed 4 key muscle groups were significantly related to improvements in walking speed: knee extensors, knee flexors, ankle plantar flexors, and hip abductors (r=.82). Prediction using the summed MMT scores from those muscles and peak EMG amplitude in a multivariable regression indicated that peak locomotor EMG amplitude did not add significantly to the prediction provided by the LE MMT alone. Change in total LE MMT scores from the beginning to the end of training was not correlated with a change in walking speed over the same period. LIMITATIONS The sample size was limited, so the results should be considered exploratory. CONCLUSIONS The results suggest that preserved muscle strength in the legs after incomplete spinal cord injury, as measured by MMT, allows for improvements in walking speed induced by locomotor training.","Yang, Jaynie F; Norton, Jonathan; Nevett-Duchcherer, Jennifer; Roy, Francois D; Gross, Douglas P; Gorassini, Monica A",Physical therapy,https://doi.org/10.2522/ptj.20100163; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21511993/,487

Here, we demonstrate the remarkable diversity of SLCoVs in R. sinicus and identify a strain with the same pattern of phylogenetic incongruence (i.e. an indication of recombination) as reported previously in another SLCoV strain. Moreover, this strain possesses a distinctive 579 nt deletion in the nsp3 region that was also found in a human SCoV from the late-phase epidemic. Phylogenetic analysis of the Orf1 region suggested that the human SCoVs are phylogenetically closer to SLCoVs in R. sinicus than to SLCoVs in other Rhinolophus species. These findings reveal a closer evolutionary linkage between SCoV in humans and SLCoVs in R. sinicus, defining the scope of surveillance to search for the direct ancestor of human SCoVs.","Yuan, Junfa; Hon, Chung-Chau; Li, Yan; Wang, Dingming; Xu, Gelin; Zhang, Huajun; Zhou, Peng; Poon, Leo L M; Lam, Tommy Tsan-Yuk; Leung, Frederick Chi-Ching; Shi, Zhengli",The Journal of general virology,https://doi.org/10.1099/vir.0.016378-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20016037/,487

DESIGN Eligible cohort or case-control studies were identified systematically using comprehensive search terms and a validated search filter for prognostic studies. Medline (OVID), EMBASE (OVID), CINAHL (EMBSCO), and PsycINFO (OVID) databases were searched. Risk of bias, using Quality in Prognosis Studies tool, and quality of evidence, using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation, were assessed. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS People aged 65 years and older from any clinical setting. MEASURES Any ACB measures were accepted (including the anticholinergic domain of the Drug Burden Index). Any global/multidimensional measure for physical function and/or quality of life was accepted for outcome. RESULTS Thirteen studies reporting associations between ACB and physical function (n = 10) or quality of life (n = 4) were included. Exposure measures included Anticholinergic Cognitive Burden Scale, Anticholinergic Drug Scale, Anticholinergic Risk Scale, Clinician Rated Anticholinergic Score, and the anticholinergic domain of the Drug Burden Index. All studies were rated moderate risk of bias in ≥2 Quality in Prognosis Studies categories with 5 rated high risk in ≥1 categories. Seven of 10 studies (5251 of 7569 participants) reported significant decline in physical function with increased burden. All 4 studies (2635 participants) reporting quality of life demonstrated similar association with increased burden. High risk of biases and inadequate data reporting restricted analysis. There was no evidence to support one measure being superior to another. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS The evidence supports association between increased ACB and future impairments in physical function and quality of life. No conclusion can be made regarding which ACB measure has the best prognostic value. Well-designed longitudinal studies are required to address this. Clinicians should be aware of patient's anticholinergic burden and consider alternative medications where appropriate.","Stewart, Carrie; Yrjana, Kaisa; Kishor, Mitrysha; Soiza, Roy L; Taylor-Rowan, Martin; Quinn, Terence J; Loke, Yoon K; Myint, Phyo Kyaw",Journal of the American Medical Directors Association,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jamda.2020.05.065; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32709405/,487
65254,[Important and Unresolved Aspects of Neuropathologic Analyses of COVID-19 Individuals].,2020-10-01,"PURPOSE To systematically examine the dynamic changes and time sequence in corneal epithelial cell apoptosis after excessive ultraviolet B irradiation. METHODS Ultraviolet B (144 mJ/cm2) was used to irradiate rat corneal epithelial cells for 2 h. Cell morphology was observed on differential interference contrast microscopy, and the numbers of the different kinds of apoptotic cells were counted using the ImageJ software. Cell viability was measured with the 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5- diphenyl-2-H-tetrazolium bromide method. Cell apoptotic rate and loss of mitochondrial membrane potential were detected using flow cytometric analyses. The expression levels of 3 apoptotic genes were measured with real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction at different time points within 0-24 h after irradiation. RESULTS After 144-mJ/cm2 ultraviolet B irradiation for 2 h, the expression levels of caspase-8 and Bax were highest at 0 h; furthermore, the mitochondrial membrane potential decreased at 0 h and remained constant for 6 h in a subsequent culture. At 6 h, caspase-3 was activated. The decrease in cell viability and increase in apoptotic rate peaked at 6 h. The caspase-3 expression level decreased within 12-24 h, which led to a decline in apoptotic rate and change in apoptotic stage. CONCLUSIONS The corneal epithelial cells exhibited rapid apoptosis after ultraviolet B irradiation, which was associated with both extrinsic and intrinsic pathways.","Du, Shaobo; Li, Jiande; Chen, Linchi; Niu, Zhanyu; Gao, Lan",Arquivos brasileiros de oftalmologia,https://doi.org/10.5935/0004-2749.20220042; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34586243/,487

NK-92 is a well-characterized human NK cell line that has demonstrated promising anti-cancer activities in clinical trials. Unlimited proliferation of NK-92 cells provides a consistent supply of cells for the administration and development of NK cell immunotherapy. However, the clinical efficacy of NK-92 cells has not reached its full potential due to reduced immune functions as compared to primary NK cells. Improvements of NK-92 functions currently rely on conventional transgene delivery by mRNA, plasmid and viral vector with limited efficiencies. To enable precise genetic modifications, we have established a robust CRISPR genome engineering platform for NK-92 based on the nucleofection of Cas9 ribonucleoprotein. To demonstrate the versatility of the platform, we have performed cell-based screening of Cas9 guide RNA, multiplex gene knockout of activating and inhibitory receptors, knock-in of a fluorescent gene, and promoter insertion to reactivate endogenous CD16 and DNAM-1. The CRISPR-engineered NK-92 demonstrated markedly enhanced cytotoxicity and could mediate antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity against hard to kill cancer cell lines. Our genome editing platform is straightforward and robust for both functional studies and therapeutic engineering of NK-92 cells.","Huang, Rih-Sheng; Shih, Hsin-An; Lai, Min-Chi; Chang, Yao-Jen; Lin, Steven",Frontiers in immunology,https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2020.01008; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32528479/,487
65919,Better Management of Delirium by Family Members.,2020-11-01,"BACKGROUND So far, the accuracy of tidal volume (VT) and leak measures provided by the built-in software of commercial home ventilators has only been tested using bench linear models with fixed calibrated and continuous leaks. The objective was to assess the reliability of the estimation of tidal volume (VT) and unintentional leaks in a single tubing bench model which introduces random dynamic leaks during inspiratory or expiratory phases. METHODS The built-in software of four commercial home ventilators and a fifth ventilator-independent ad hoc designed external software tool were tested with two levels of leaks and two different models with excess leaks (inspiration or expiration). The external software analyzed separately the inspiratory and expiratory unintentional leaks. RESULTS In basal condition, all ventilators but one underestimated tidal volume with values ranging between -1.5 ± 3.3% to -8.7% ± 3.27%. In the model with excess of inspiratory leaks, VT was overestimated by all four commercial software tools, with values ranging from 18.27 ± 7.05% to 35.92 ± 17.7%, whereas the ventilator independent-software gave a smaller difference (3.03 ± 2.6%). Leaks were underestimated by two applications with values of -11.47 ± 6.32 and -5.9 ± 0.52 L/min. With expiratory leaks, VT was overestimated by the software of one ventilator and the ventilator-independent software and significantly underestimated by the other three, with deviations ranging from +10.94 ± 7.1 to -48 ± 23.08%. The four commercial tools tested overestimated unintentional leaks, with values between 2.19 ± 0.85 to 3.08 ± 0.43 L/min. CONCLUSIONS In a bench model, the presence of unintentional random leaks may be a source of error in the measurement of VT and leaks provided by the software of home ventilators. Analyzing leaks during inspiration and expiration separately may reduce this source of error.","Sogo, Ana; Montanyà, Jaume; Monsó, Eduard; Blanch, Lluís; Pomares, Xavier; Lujàn, Manel",BMC pulmonary medicine,https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2466-13-75; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24325396/,487
70081,Airway fungal colonization compromises the immune system allowing bacterial pneumonia to prevail.,2013,"Viruses are known to develop the ability to manipulate a variety of host cell signal transduction pathways in order to facilitate successful virus survival. However, to date, little is known about the intracellular signaling mechanisms involved in porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) replication. The extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway that transduces signals to modulate a wide range of cellular functions has been shown to regulate a number of viral infections. The present study therefore aimed to determine the role of this pathway during PRRSV infection in porcine alveolar macrophages. We found that the PRRSV infection induces early robust but transient activation of ERK1/2 by 6h postinfection and thereafter the progressive decrease of its phosphorylation. However, the maximal induction of phosphorylated ERK1/2 seen at 6h postinfection was inconsistent with synthesis of a viral nucleocapsid protein that was first evident by 12h postinfection. These results indicate that ERK1/2 activation is mediated independently of viral gene expression during PRRSV replication. Notably, infection with UV-irradiated, inactivated virus, which is capable of receptor binding and internalization but prevents viral gene synthesis, was sufficient to trigger ERK1/2 phosphorylation, suggesting that the viral entry process may be responsible for early ERK activation. Treatment of cells with U0126, a selective ERK1/2 inhibitor, markedly diminished PRRSV infection and its inhibitory effect on PRRSV replication was exerted at the early stage in virus infection. Furthermore, inhibition of ERK activation resulted in significant suppression of subgenomic RNA transcription, viral protein translation, and progeny virus production. Taken together, the findings in this study suggest that the ERK signaling pathway plays an important role in postentry steps of the PRRSV replication cycle and beneficially contributes to viral infection.","Lee, Yoo Jin; Lee, Changhee",Virus research,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2010.06.002; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20540975/,487

Initially, SARS-CoV-2 was considered a respiratory virus generally causing a mild disease, only severe and fatal in the elderly and individuals with underlying conditions. Severe illnesses and fatalities were attributed to a cytokine storm, an excessive response from the host immune system. However, with the number of infections over 10 millions and still soaring, the insidious and stealthy nature of the virus has emerged, as it causes a vast array of diverse unexpected symptoms among infected individuals, including the young and healthy. It has become evident that besides infecting the respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 can affect many organs, possibly through the infection of the endothelium. This review presents an overview of our learning curve with the novel virus emergence, transmission, pathology, biological properties and host-interactions. It also briefly describes remedial measures taken until an effective vaccine is available, that is non-pharmaceutical interventions to reduce the viral spread and the repurposing of existing drugs, approved or in development for other conditions to eliminate the virus or mitigate the cytokine storm.","Delcuve, Geneviève P; Lakowski, Ted M; Su, Ruey-Chyi; Beacon, Tasnim H; Davie, James R",IUBMB life,https://doi.org/10.1002/iub.2380; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32918855/,487

These procedures also dramatically improve other metabolic conditions, including hyperlipidemia and hypertension, in both obese and nonobese patients. Several studies have provided evidence that these metabolic effects are not simply the results of drastic weight loss and decreased caloric intake but might be attributable, in part, to endocrine changes resulting from surgical manipulation of the gastrointestinal tract. In this Review, we provide an overview of the clinical evidence that demonstrates the effects of such interventions-termed metabolic surgery-on T2DM and discuss the implications for future research. In light of the evidence presented here, we speculate that the gastrointestinal tract might have a role in the pathophysiology of T2DM and obesity.","Rubino, Francesco; R'bibo, Sarah L; del Genio, Federica; Mazumdar, Madhu; McGraw, Timothy E",Nature reviews.

This study aimed to explore family members' concerns for their relatives during the lockdown period, assess their level of acceptance of the visiting restriction policy and determine the associated factors. METHODS From the 156 family members interviewed, demographic data, satisfaction with overall care quality, worry and concerns for their relatives, acceptance of the visiting restriction and arrangement for the residents if cluster infections occur in the facility were recorded. RESULTS Among the members interviewed, 83 (53.2%) were men; mean age of members was 56.3 ± 9.8; most were offspring of residents in the facility (n = 121, 77.6%), most visited the residents at least once a week (n = 113, 72.4%) before the lockdown. The most common concerns of the family members for their relatives were psychological stress (38.5%), followed by nursing care (26.9%) and daily activity (21.1%). Nearly 84.6% of those interviewed accepted the visiting restriction policy, and a higher satisfaction rating independently associated with acceptance of the visiting restriction policy (odds ratio 2.15). CONCLUSIONS During the lockdown period, staff members should provide more psychological information about residents to their family members. Higher satisfaction rating was found to be independent of the acceptance of the visiting restriction policy. Therefore, good quality of care of the facility wins the trust of family members, and this might mitigate the tension between the family members and staff during a major crisis.

74882,Understanding racial disparities in the care of patients with irritable bowel syndrome: The need for a unified approach.,2021-04-09,"In the last decades propofol became established as an intravenous agent for the induction and maintenance of both sedation and general anesthesia procedures. In order to achieve the desired clinical effects appropriate infusion rate strategies must be designed. Moreover, it is important to avoid or minimize associated side effects namely adverse cardiorespiratory effects and delayed recovery. Nowadays, to attain these purposes the continuous propofol delivery is usually performed through target-controlled infusion (TCI) systems whose algorithms rely on pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic models. This work presents statistical models to estimate both the infusion rate and the bolus administration. The modeling strategy relies on multivariate linear models, based on patient characteristics such as age, height, weight and gender along with the desired target concentration. A clinical database collected with a RugLoopII device on 84 patients undergoing ultrasonographic endoscopy under sedation-analgesia with propofol and remifentanil is used to estimate the models (training set with 74 cases) and assess their performance (test set with 10 cases). The results obtained in the test set comprising a broad range of characteristics are satisfactory since the models are able to predict bolus, infusion rates and the effect-site concentrations comparable to those of TCI. Furthermore, comparisons of the effect-site concentrations for dosages predicted by the proposed Linear model and the Marsh model for the same target concentration is achieved using Schnider model and a factorial design on the factors (patients characteristics). The results indicate that the Linear model predicts a dosage profile that is faster in leading to an effect-site concentration closer to the desired target concentration.","Rocha, Conceição; Mendonça, Teresa; Silva, Maria Eduarda; Gambús, Pedro",Journal of clinical monitoring and computing,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10877-013-9510-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24072471/,487

MATERIALS AND METHODS An intensive research effort was carried out on prosthetics that are commercially available worldwide. We conducted a search of the medical literature and companies' websites to find the weights and thicknesses of commercially available prosthetics. Where these data were lacking, we contacted manufacturers directly in order to render the research more complete. A total of 166 products were considered for classification based on biomaterial properties. Among these, a homogeneous group of 80 polypropylene monofilament knitted or woven prosthetics was selected for classification based on weight. Weights were provided for 70 prosthetics (87%), and both the weight and thickness was provided for 40 prosthetics (50%). RESULTS Classification based on weight: Ultra-light <35 g/m(2), Light ≥35 < 70 g/m(2), Standard ≥70 < 140 g/m(2), Heavy ≥140 g/m(2). Classification based on biomaterial composition: simple (prosthetics made of one pure biomaterial); composite (prosthetics made of two or more different layers); combined (prosthetics made of two materials knitted or woven together); and biologic. CONCLUSION Weight and biomaterial classifications were proposed after an extensive analysis of commercially available prosthetics.

We sought to estimate the size of the nonemergent surgical backlog during COVID-19 in Ontario, Canada, and the time and resources required to clear the backlog. METHODS We used 6 Ontario or Canadian population administrative sources to obtain data covering part or all of the period between Jan. 1, 2017, and June 13, 2020, on historical volumes and operating room throughput distributions by surgery type and region, and lengths of stay in ward and intensive care unit (ICU) beds. We used time series forecasting, queuing models and probabilistic sensitivity analysis to estimate the size of the backlog and clearance time for a +10% (+1 day per week at 50% capacity) surge scenario. RESULTS Between Mar. 15 and June 13, 2020, the estimated backlog in Ontario was 148 364 surgeries (95% prediction interval 124 508-174 589), an average weekly increase of 11 413 surgeries. Estimated backlog clearance time is 84 weeks (95% confidence interval [CI] 46-145), with an estimated weekly throughput of 717 patients (95% CI 326-1367) requiring 719 operating room hours (95% CI 431-1038), 265 ward beds (95% CI 87-678) and 9 ICU beds (95% CI 4-20) per week.

For surgical team mentoring in the form of field visits to be undertaken as a routine activity, it needs to be embedded in the local context. This paper explores the complex dimensions of implementing surgical team mentoring in Malawi by identifying stakeholder-sourced scenarios that fit with, among others, national policy and regulations, incentives to perform surgery, career opportunities, competing priorities, alternatives for performing surgery locally and the proximity and role of referral hospitals. METHODS A mixed methods approach was used which combined stakeholder input - obtained through two group model building (GMB) workshops and further consultations with local stakeholders and SURG-Africa project staff - and dynamic modeling to explore policy options for sustaining and rolling out surgical team mentoring. Sensitivity analyses were also performed. RESULTS Each of the two GMB workshops resulted in a causal loop diagram (CLD) with an array of factors and feedback loops describing the complexity of surgical team mentoring. Six implementation scenarios were defined to perform such mentoring. For each the resource requirements were identified for the institutions involved - notably DHs, CHs and the party that would finance the required mentoring trips - along with the potential for scaling up surgery at DHs under severe financial constraints. CONCLUSION To sustain surgical mentoring, it is important that an approach of continued communication, monitoring, and (re-)evaluation is taken. In addition, an output- or performance-based financing scheme for DHs is required to incentivize them to scale up surgery.","Broekhuizen, Henk; Ifeanyichi, Martilord; Mwapasa, Gerald; Pittalis, Chiara; Noah, Patrick; Mkandawire, Nyengo; Borgstein, Eric; Brugha, Ruairí; Gajewski, Jakub; Bijlmakers, Leon",International journal of health policy and management,https://doi.org/10.34172/ijhpm.2021.78; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34380202/,487

Several management strategies have been used with no clear consensus recommendations. We examined subjects with tandem occlusions enrolled in the ESCAPE trial and their outcomes. METHODS Data are from the ESCAPE trial. Additional data were sought on interventions for each subject. RESULTS There were 54 (17%) subjects with tandem extracranial and intracranial occlusions. Patients in the endovascular treatment arm (n=30) were more likely to be younger (median age 66 years, p<0.01), male (66.7%, p=0.03), diabetic, and without atrial fibrillation. Subjects with tandem occlusions were more likely to have intracranial internal carotid artery occlusions than M1 occlusions (p<0.01). Of the 30 intervention-arm subjects, 17 (57%) underwent emergency endovascular treatment of the extracranial disease, 10 subjects before and seven subjects after intracranial thrombectomy. Of the remaining 13 subjects, only four required staged carotid revascularization due to persistent severe carotid stenosis; four had cervical pseudo-occlusions with no residual stenosis after large distal carotid thrombus burden aspiration/retrieval. Outcomes were similar between subjects with and without tandem lesions. The use of antithrombotic agents after acute carotid artery stenting was variable but no symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage was seen in subjects who underwent emergency endovascular treatment of extracranial carotid artery.

Recently, studies revealed that self-DNA from by-products of chromosome instability and tumors could activate the cGAS-STING pathway, and subsequently promote or inhibit tumor development. However, the prognostic value and correlations with immune infiltrates of the cGAS-STING pathway in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) have not been clarified. In this study, we used the Molecular Signatures Database, Oncomine, UALCAN, Human Protein Atlas, Kaplan-Meier plotter, LinkedOmics, and Tumor Immune Estimation Resource databases. Overexpression of XRCC5, IRF3, TRIM21, STAT6, DDX41, TBK1, XRCC6, TREX1, PRKDC, and TMEM173 was markedly correlated with clinical stages and pathological grades in HCC. Moreover, higher mRNA expression of XRCC5, XRCC6, and PRKDC was significantly related with shorter overall survival. However, higher mRNA expression of IFI16, STAT6, NLRC3, and TMEM173 was associated with favorable overall survival. Our results suggested that the kinase targets of the cGAS-STING pathway included the SRC family of tyrosine kinases (LCK and LYN), phosphoinositide 3-kinase-related protein kinase (PIKK) family kinases (ATM and ATR), and mitogen-activated protein kinase 1 (MAPK1). Furthermore, we identified significant correlations among the expression of cGAS-STING pathway and infiltration of B cells, CD4+T cells, CD8+ T cells, macrophages, neutrophils, and dendritic cells in HCC. The expression of the cGAS-STING pathway also exhibited strong relationships with diverse immune marker sets in HCC. These findings suggest that cGAS-STING pathway members may be used as prognostic biomarkers and immunotherapeutic targets HCC patients.","Qi, Zhenhua; Yan, Fang; Chen, Dongtai; Xing, Wei; Li, Qiang; Zeng, Weian; Bi, Bingtian; Xie, Jingdun",Bioscience reports,https://doi.org/10.1042/bsr20202603; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33006365/,487

89557,Goal-Directed Resuscitative Interventions During Pediatric Interfacility Transport.,2015,"BACKGROUND Revisional surgery after failed laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) is growing and laparoscopic one anastomosis gastric bypass (LOAGB) has been proposed as a revisional procedure due to its combined restrictive and malabsorptive effects. The aim is to study short-term complications and weight loss (WL) results of the revisional LOAGB after LSG for the two-weight loss failure (WLF) types [insufficient weight loss (IWL) and weight regain (WR)] and to assess the possible effects of these two types of failure and gastric tube anatomy on the final outcome. METHODS The data of 28 patients who completed 1-year follow-up for their revisional LOAGB after their failed LSG were assessed and statistically correlated to leakage and one year WL results. RESULTS Operative time was 96 ± 17.4 min. Leakage occurred in 2 patients (7.1%); the small number of leak patients does not allow statistical analysis for leakage. Percentage of excess weight loss (%EWL) at one year was 79.0 ± 14.4%; percentage of total weight loss (%TWL) was 31.7 ± 6.4%. %EWL was 84.2 ± 13.1 with IWL and 73.0 ± 13.9 with WR (P = 0.036). %TWL was 35.0 ± 5.2 with IWL and 27.8 ± 5.5 with WR (P = 0.001). %TWL at persistent fundus, diffusely dilated, and nondilated stomach were 38.98 ± 4.57, 31.3 ± 5.33, and 28.54 ± 5.91, respectively (P = 0.006). CONCLUSION LOAGB is a highly effective and safe procedure as a revision after LSG with WLF. Patients with IWL and patients with persistent fundus lost more weight than those with WR and those with diffuse stomach dilation or nondilation, respectively.","Gerges, Wadie Boshra; Omran, Hisham; Makram, Fady",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-021-08374-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33625589/,487

93127,Editor's Choice Articles for January.,2021-01-01,"BACKGROUND The diagnosis of periprosthetic joint infection remains a challenge. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the combined measurement of the levels of two synovial fluid biomarkers, α-defensin and C-reactive protein (CRP), for the diagnosis of periprosthetic joint infection. METHODS One hundred and forty-nine synovial fluid aspirates, including 112 from patients with an aseptic diagnosis and thirty-seven from patients with periprosthetic joint infection, met the inclusion criteria for this prospective study. Synovial fluid aspirates were tested for α-defensin and CRP levels with use of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The Musculoskeletal Infection Society (MSIS) definition of periprosthetic joint infection was utilized for the classification of cases as aseptic or infected. Comorbidities, such as inflammatory conditions, that could confound a test for periprosthetic joint infection were documented, but the patients with such comorbidities were included in the study. RESULTS The combination of synovial fluid α-defensin and CRP tests demonstrated a sensitivity of 97% and a specificity of 100% for the diagnosis of periprosthetic joint infection. Synovial fluid α-defensin tests alone demonstrated a sensitivity of 97% and a specificity of 96% for the diagnosis of periprosthetic joint infection. Synovial fluid CRP tests, with a low threshold of 3 mg/L, reversed all-false positive α-defensin results without affecting the sensitivity of the test. The diagnostic characteristics of these assays were achieved in a population of patients demonstrating a 23% rate of systemic inflammatory diseases (in the series as a whole) and a 27% rate of concurrent antibiotic treatment (in the infection group). The synovial fluid levels of α-defensin in the setting of periprosthetic joint infection were unchanged during concurrent antibiotic treatment. CONCLUSIONS The combined measurement of synovial fluid α-defensin and CRP levels correctly diagnosed 99% of the cases in this study as aseptic or infected. This was achieved despite the inclusion of patients with systemic inflammatory disease and those receiving treatment with antibiotics. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE Diagnostic Level II.

94411,Another Stepping Stone Toward Personalized Glycemic Control.,2020-12-01,"AIM To evaluate the safety and efficacy of the administration of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) in the short term to the same patients in Barcelona Clinical Liver Cancer (BCLC) stages 0-B1. METHODS From April 2014 to June 2019, we retrospectively reviewed BCLC stage 0-B1 patients with fresh hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) lesions that were repeatedly treated by RFA (control group, n = 72), and by RFA and subsequent SBRT (case group, n = 26). Propensity score matching (PSM) was performed to reduce the selection bias between two groups. Recurrence, survival, Child-Pugh scores and short-term side effects (fever, bleeding, skin change, abdominal pain and fatigue) were recorded and analyzed. RESULTS After PSM, 21 patients remained in each group. Seventeen and 20 patients in the case and control groups experienced recurrence. For these patients, the median times to progression and follow-up were 10.7 and 35.8 months, respectively. After PSM, the 1-year progression-free survival rate in case and control groups were 66.7% and 52.4%, respectively (P = 0.313). The inter-group overall survival (OS) was comparable (3 and 5-year OS rates in case groups were 87.3% and 74.8%, while rates in control groups were 73.7% and 46.3%, respectively; P = 0.090). The short-term side effects were mild, and the incidence showed no inter-group difference. The 1-year rates of the Child-Pugh score deterioration of ≥2 in case and control groups were 23.8% and 33.3% (P > 0.05), respectively. CONCLUSION The short-term administration of RFA and SBRT to the same BCLC stage 0-B1 patients may be feasible and effective because of their good prognosis and safety.","Wang, Feiqian; Numata, Kazushi; Takeda, Atsuya; Ogushi, Katsuaki; Fukuda, Hiroyuki; Hara, Koji; Chuma, Makoto; Eriguchi, Takahisa; Tsurugai, Yuichirou; Maeda, Shin",PloS one,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0245076; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33400718/,487

95934,Determining Prognosis After a Cardiac Arrest: Role of Somatosensory Evoked Potentials.,2020-09-01,"BACKGROUND As health systems across the world respond to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), there is rising concern that patients without COVID-19 are not receiving timely emergency care, resulting in avoidable deaths. This study examined patterns of self-reported health service utilization, their socio-demographic determinants and association with avoidable deaths during the COVID-19 outbreak. METHODS A cross-sectional telephone survey was conducted between March 22 and April 1, 2020, during the peak rise in confirmed COVID-19 cases in Hong Kong. Cantonese-speaking Hong Kong residents over 18-years-old were recruited using a computerised random digital dialling (RDD) system. The RDD method used stratified random sampling to ensure a representative sample of the target population by age, gender, and residential district. A structured self-reported questionnaire was used. RESULTS Out of 1738 placed calls, 765 subjects responded to the questionnaire (44.0% response rate). The factors associated with avoiding medical consultation included being female (37.2% vs. 22.5%, P<.001), married (32.8% vs. 27%, P=.044), completing tertiary education (35.3% vs. 27.7% (secondary) vs. 14.8% (primary), P=.005), and those who reported a ""large/very large"" impact of COVID-19 on their mental health (36.1% vs 30.5% (neutral) vs. 19.7% (very small/small), P=.047) using logistic regression analysis. CONCLUSION Married females with both higher educational attainment and concern about COVID-19 were associated with avoiding healthcare services. Timely public communication to encourage and promote early health seeking treatment even during extreme events such as pandemics are needed.","Hung, Kevin Kc; Walline, Joseph H; Chan, Emily Ying Yang; Huang, Zhe; Lo, Eugene Siu Kai; Yeoh, Eng Kiong; Graham, Colin A",International journal of health policy and management,https://doi.org/10.34172/ijhpm.2020.183; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33105965/,487
97512,Normative values in esophageal high-resolution manometry.,2015,"BACKGROUND Thymectomy is recognized as a significant component in the treatment of myasthenia gravis. However, controversy exists as to the optimal surgical approach. This investigation summarizes our experience performing extended thymectomy using a robotic technique in a large group of patients with significant follow-up. METHODS Data collection for patients undergoing robotic thymectomy for nonthymomatous myasthenia gravis over a 6-year period was prospectively performed. Patients were assessed using the Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America's quantitative disease severity score and the post intervention status classification. RESULTS During the study period, 75 patients underwent thymectomy by this method. Mean preoperative myasthenia gravis severity score was 2.7. Mean operative time was 113±46 minutes. Extubation in the operating room occurred in 73 (98%) patients. Mean intensive care stay and total hospital length of stay were 0.9 and 2.2 days respectively. Mean interval between surgery and return to work (or prethymectomy activities of daily living) was 15±6 days. Significant improvement of myasthenia gravis symptoms occurred in 65 (87%) patients with a mean follow-up of 45±14 months. CONCLUSIONS Robotic-assisted thymectomy is a safe and effective technique for patients with symptomatic myasthenia gravis. It allowed an extended thymectomy to be performed without the associated length of stay or recovery period of a transsternal approach while producing comparable rates of symptom improvement.","Freeman, Richard K; Ascioti, Anthony J; Van Woerkom, Jaclyn M; Vyverberg, Amy; Robison, Robert J",The Annals of thoracic surgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.athoracsur.2011.04.054; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21871293/,487

Time to close each enterotomy, bursting pressure, luminal reduction, and cost were calculated and compared. RESULTS HS2 was significantly more time consuming to perform in the 5 cm group whereas in the 10 cm group, only the HS1 and SKS were faster than the other techniques. Luminal reduction was not different between techniques in either group. HS2 resulted in consistently higher bursting pressure compared with SKS and TA90 in the 5 cm group and compared to all other techniques in the 10 cm group. CONCLUSION The TA90 technique had the lowest bursting pressure and highest cost. The HS2 technique was strongest.","Gandini, Marco; Iotti, Bryan N; Giusto, Gessica",Veterinary surgery : VS,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1532-950x.2013.12065.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24033378/,487

121773,The Juice Versus the Squeeze.,2021-04-01,"BACKGROUND The epidermis is the outermost layer of skin and is composed of cells primarily containing keratin. It consists of about ten layers of living cells (keratinocytes) and ten layers of dead cells (corneocytes). Thinning of the epidermis and decreased proliferation of its cells are associated with aging related changes in skin, including wrinkling and laxity. Fluorescence excitation spectroscopy is a noninvasive method of monitoring characteristic excitation-emission peaks in skin that have been related to the epidermal and dermal composition. The magnitude of the peak that occurs at 295nm excitation (F295) has been linked to changes in epidermal thickness, proliferation, and skin aging. AIM The goal of this study is to correlate changes in the F295 signal with proliferation of cells and thickening of the epidermis induced by cosmetic formulations. We hypothesize that two commonly used cosmetic ingredients, retinol and glycolic acid, will increase these markers that have been implicated in skin anti-aging. METHODS In a placebo-controlled study subjects' forearms were treated with formulations containing retinol or glycolic acid under occlusive patch for a period of 21 days. Skin fluorescence was measured at baseline and after treatment, and biopsies were taken following treatment for histological analysis of epidermal thickness and cell proliferation. RESULTS After 21 days of treatment retinol and glycolic acid formulas significantly increased F295 (by 265.1±33.5% and 162.2±18.7% respectively), whereas the placebo control formula did not induce a change from baseline. Furthermore, retinol and glycolic acid treatments significantly increased epidermal thickness (by 63.1% and 7.8% respectively) and keratinocyte proliferation (by 236.9% and 62.8% respectively) versus placebo control. CONCLUSION Increases in F295 were found to correlate with epidermal renewal, but more so with increased cell proliferation than epidermal thickness. We conclude that the F295 signal is a fast and reliable early indicator of epidermal remodeling in skin that can be used to distinguish between formulations with different cosmetic ingredients.","Maidhof, Robert; Liebel, Frank; Hwang, Cheng; Ruvolo, Eduardo; Lyga, John","Photodermatology, photoimmunology & photomedicine",https://doi.org/10.1111/phpp.12470; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30951225/,487

We investigated the incidence and effect of single and multiple infections with respiratory viruses on the risk of LRTIs in Vietnam. Population-based prospective surveillance and a case-control study of hospitalised paediatric patients with acute respiratory infection (ARI) were conducted from April 2007 through to March 2010. Healthy controls were randomly recruited from the same community. Nasopharyngeal samples were collected and tested for 13 respiratory viruses using multiplex PCRs. 1992 hospitalised ARI episodes, including 397 (19.9%) with LRTIs, were enrolled. Incidence of hospitalised LRTIs among children aged <24 months was 2171.9 per 100 000 (95% CI 1947.9-2419.7). The majority of ARI cases (60.9%) were positive for at least one virus. Human rhinovirus (24.2%), respiratory syncytial virus (20.1%) and influenza A virus (12.0%) were the most common and 9.5% had multiple-viral infections. Respiratory syncytial virus and human metapneumovirus infections independently increased the risk of LRTIs. Respiratory syncytial virus further increased the risk, when co-infected with human rhinovirus, human metapneumovirus and parainfluenza virus-3 but not with influenza A virus. The case-control analysis revealed that respiratory syncytial virus and influenza A virus increased the risk of ARI hospitalisation but not human rhinovirus. Respiratory syncytial virus is the leading pathogen associated with risk of ARI hospitalisation and LRTIs in Vietnam.","Yoshida, Lay-Myint; Suzuki, Motoi; Nguyen, Hien Anh; Le, Minh Nhat; Dinh Vu, Thiem; Yoshino, Hiroshi; Schmidt, Wolf-Peter; Nguyen, Thi Thuy Ai; Le, Huu Tho; Morimoto, Konosuke; Moriuchi, Hiroyuki; Dang, Duc Anh; Ariyoshi, Koya",The European respiratory journal,https://doi.org/10.1183/09031936.00101812; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23645407/,487

Bacteriological examination of samples from the brain, lung, liver, spleen, and bone marrow tested positive for Pasteurella pneumotropica. Histopathology demonstrated inflammatory and vascular lesions in the central nervous system and internal organs. Canine adenovirus type 1 nucleic acid was detected by polymerase chain reaction in the frozen brain but not in the formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded liver and lung samples. The positive PCR was subsequently confirmed by indirect fluorescent antibody testing of the paraffin-embedded brain and liver sections. Although the liver is the primary site of viral damage, these laboratory findings suggest that Canine adenovirus type 1 infection should be included in the differential diagnosis of neuropathological diseases in dogs and that adenoviral infections could promote septicaemia caused by opportunistic pathogens.","Pintore, Maria Domenica; Corbellini, Debora; Chieppa, Maria Novella; Vallino Costassa, Elena; Florio, Caterina Lucia; Varello, Katia; Bozzetta, Elena; Adriano, Daniela; Decaro, Nicola; Casalone, Cristina; Iulini, Barbara",Veterinaria italiana,https://doi.org/10.12834/vetit.270.934.1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27033531/,487

These children could benefit from more efficient intervention responses, providing a better understanding of their cognitive weaknesses/deficits. Our aim was to explore the cognitive heterogeneity of a population of poor readers identified from a large sample of 948 sixth-grade children. We first assessed the contribution of phoneme awareness (PA), rapid automatized naming (RAN), and visual attention span (VAS) to reading performance in a subset of 281 children including poor and average readers/spellers. We show that all three skills are unique and significant predictors of reading fluency. We then restricted the analysis to participants with normal Raven's score (IQ) and oral language skills to focus on 110 children with more specific reading difficulties. A unique VAS deficit was found in 18% of these poor readers while 20% and 15.5% showed a unique PA or RAN deficit. Children with multiple or no deficit were further identified. The overall findings provide evidence for a variety of cognitive profiles in poor readers. They suggest that, in addition to PA interventions, training programs targeting VAS might be useful for the nontrivial share of poor readers who exhibit a VAS deficit.","Valdois, Sylviane; Reilhac, Caroline; Ginestet, Emilie; Line Bosse, Marie",Journal of learning disabilities,https://doi.org/10.1177/0022219420961332; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32985335/,487
125781,The chest wall: the all too commonly forgotten cause of pulmonary dysfunction*.,2012,"Substantia nigra (SNc) dopaminergic neurons respond to aversive stimuli with inhibitory pauses in firing followed by transient rebound activation. We tested integration of inhibitory synaptic inputs onto SNc neurons from genetically defined populations in dorsal striatum (striosome and matrix) and external globus pallidus (GPe; parvalbumin- and Lhx6-positive), and examined their contribution to pause-rebound firing. Activation of striosome projections, which target ""dendron bouquets"" in the pars reticulata (SNr), consistently quiets firing and relief from striosome inhibition triggers rebound activity. Striosomal inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) display a prominent GABA-B receptor-mediated component that strengthens the impact of SNr dendrite synapses on somatic excitability and enables rebounding. By contrast, GPe projections activate GABA-A receptors on the soma and proximal dendrites but do not result in rebounding. Lastly, optical mapping shows that dorsal striatum selectively inhibits the ventral population of SNc neurons, which are intrinsically capable of rebounding. Therefore, we define a distinct striatonigral circuit for generating dopamine rebound.","Evans, Rebekah C; Twedell, Emily L; Zhu, Manhua; Ascencio, Jefferson; Zhang, Renshu; Khaliq, Zayd M",Cell reports,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2020.108156; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32937133/,487

The primary treatment method is complete removal of the tumor because of the high recurrence rate; however, the problem for the surgeon is the reconstruction of the abdominal wall after resection of the abdominal desmoid tumor. Case Presentation A 63-year-old man underwent open drainage and ileostomy for the perforation of ileocecal tumor. After 3 months, he underwent right hemicolectomy and ileostomy closure. Pathological examination revealed no malignancy, and the ileocecal tumor showed the presence of abscess. He noticed a palpable mass in the left abdomen. Enhanced abdominal computed tomography (CT) revealed a large abdominal incisional hernia and an enhanced mass of 40 mm in the left rectus muscle. Needle biopsy was performed and the diagnosis was desmoid tumor. He underwent resection of the desmoid tumor and repair of hernia. We performed wide local resection, with a 2-cm surgical margin. The hernia was repaired by simple closure, and the defect in the left abdomen was repaired with reconstruction using the fascia lata patch through plastic surgery. Conclusion We encountered a case of abdominal wall desmoid tumor combined with a large abdominal incisional hernia. We selected the use of autologous fascia based on the risk of recurrence. The patient has not shown recurrence of incisional hernia or desmoid tumor 22 months after surgery.

METHODS We searched PubMed, MEDLINE and CNKI databases, preprint servers, clinical trial registries and supplementary sources for Chinese- or English-language randomized trials or non-randomized studies with comparator groups, which tested the constituents of 3M3F in the treatment of COVID-19 up to September 2020. Primary outcome was change in disease severity. Secondary outcomes included various symptoms. Meta-analysis (using generic inverse variance random effects model) was performed when there were two or more studies reporting on the same symptom. RESULTS Of 607 articles identified, 13 primary studies (6 RCTs and 7 retrospective non-randomized comparative studies) with 1467 participants met our final inclusion criteria. Studies were small and had significant methodological limitations, most notably potential bias in assessment of outcomes. No study convincingly demonstrated a statistically significant impact on change in disease severity. Eight studies reported sufficiently similar secondary outcomes to be included in a meta-analysis. Some statistically significant impacts on symptoms, chest CT manifestations, laboratory variables and length of stay were demonstrated, but such findings were sparse and many remain unreplicated. CONCLUSIONS These findings neither support nor refute the claim that 3M3F alters the severity of COVID-19 or alleviates symptoms. More rigorous studies are required to properly ascertain the potential role of Chinese Herbal Medicine in COVID-19.","Wang, Yangzihan; Greenhalgh, Trisha; Wardle, Jon",Journal of evaluation in clinical practice,https://doi.org/10.1111/jep.13614; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34528735/,487

136111,Early Tracheostomy in Brain Injury: More Details Are Needed for Seeking Best Practice.,2020-10-01,"BACKGROUND Motor competence is an important predictor of health behaviours. However, levels of motor competence are low in children and adolescents. Many interventions have improved motor competence, yet intervention effects were highly variable. Potential causes of such variations are not fully understood. Process evaluation can assist with the understanding of why an intervention worked or not, but its application and reporting in motor competence interventions has received little attention. OBJECTIVES The primary aim of this review was to investigate whether process evaluations have been reported in interventions to improve motor competence and, if reported, which process evaluation measures have been used. A secondary aim was to explore the association of intervention characteristics and process evaluation findings (outcomes of process evaluation measures) with intervention outcomes, in a search for what process evaluation measures may impact on intervention functioning and outcomes. METHODS The process of conducting and reporting this review adhered to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. The review protocol was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42019124412). A systematic search of seven electronic databases (i.e. MEDLINE [via EBSCOhost], Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials [CENTRAL], CINAHL, Academic Search Complete, Education Database, SPORTDiscus and Scopus) was conducted with no date restrictions. Eligibility criteria included the following: (1) a study sample of typically developing children and adolescents aged 5-18 years, (2) an intervention aimed to improve motor competence, (3) an intervention included a control group, (4) a report of motor competence outcome at both pre- and post-intervention. Only original articles published in English in peer-reviewed journals were considered. Process evaluation measures and findings were extracted using the UK Medical Research Council's process evaluation framework in order to provide overarching descriptions on the implementation, mechanism of change and context of interventions. Univariable meta-regressions were performed to ascertain whether selected study-level covariates moderated the improvement in motor competence outcomes in interventions. RESULTS The search identified 60 intervention studies. Only 30 studies (50%) reported process evaluation measures. No studies reported (or employed) theoretical frameworks to guide process evaluation. Process evaluation measures relating to implementation were most commonly reported, with the most prevalent aspect being fidelity. This was followed by reporting on measures relating to mechanism of change and context of the intervention. Meta-analysis results suggested intervention duration, dose, inclusion of process evaluation aim, provision of lesson plans, sample size and sex as potential moderators. CONCLUSIONS Reporting of process evaluation measures may help build our understanding of the optimal characteristics of motor competence interventions. However, process evaluation is under-used and/or under-reported. This review serves as a call for more process evaluations and better reporting in motor competence interventions.","Ma, Jiani; Lander, Natalie; Eyre, Emma L J; Barnett, Lisa M; Essiet, Inimfon A; Duncan, Michael J",Sports medicine,https://doi.org/10.1007/s40279-021-01519-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34339044/,487
136504,Socializing During the COVID-19 Pandemic.,2020-11-18,"A novel electrochemical magnetoimmunosensor for fast and ultrasensitive detection of H9N2 avian influenza virus particles (H9N2 AIV) was designed based on the combination of high-efficiency immunomagnetic separation, enzyme catalytic amplification, and the biotin-streptavidin system. The reusable, homemade magneto Au electrode (M-AuE) was designed and used for the direct sensing. Immunocomplex-coated magnetic beads (IMBs) were easily accumulated on the surface of the M-AuE to obtain the catalytically reduced electrochemical signal of H2 O2 after the immunoreaction. The transducer was regenerated through a simple washing procedure, which made it possible to detect all the samples on a single electrode with higher reproducibility. The magnetic-bead-based electrochemical immunosensor showed better analytical performance than the planar-electrode-based immunosensor with the same sandwich construction. Amounts as low as 10 pg mL(-1) H9N2 AIV could be detected even in samples of chicken dung. This electrochemical magnetoimmunosensor not only provides a simple platform for the detection of the virus with high sensitivity, selectivity, and reproducibility but also shows great potential in the early diagnosis of diseases.","Zhou, Chuan-Hua; Shu, Yun; Hong, Zheng-Yuan; Pang, Dai-Wen; Zhang, Zhi-Ling","Chemistry, an Asian journal",https://doi.org/10.1002/asia.201300521; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23794357/,487
138595,Late Mortality From Sepsis: What We Know and What It Means.,2021-02-01,"OBJECTIVE To assess whether there is an association between 48-hour postextubation fluid balance and extubation failure. METHODS This was a prospective cohort study that included patients admitted to the intensive care unit of a tertiary hospital in southern Brazil from March 2019 to December 2019. Patients who required mechanical ventilation for at least 24 hours and who were extubated during the study period were included. The primary outcome was extubation failure, considered as the need for reintubation in the first 72 hours after extubation. The secondary outcome was a combined outcome with extubation failure or the need for therapeutic noninvasive ventilation. RESULTS A total of 101 patients were included. Extubation failure was observed in 29 (28.7%) patients. In univariate analysis, patients with a negative 48-hour postextubation fluid balance higher than one liter had a lower rate of extubation failure (12.0%) than patients with a negative 48-hour postextubation fluid balance lower than 1L (34.2%; p = 0.033). Mechanical ventilation duration and negative 48-hour postextubation fluid balance lower than one liter were associated with extubation failure when corrected for Simplified Acute Physiology Score 3 in multivariate analysis. When we evaluated the combined outcome, only negative 48-hour postextubation lower than 1L maintained an association when corrected for for Simplified Acute Physiology Score 3 and mechanical ventilation duration. CONCLUSION The 48-hour postextubation fluid balance is associated with extubation failure. Further studies are necessary to assess whether avoiding positive fluid balance in this period might improve weaning outcomes.","Santos, Priscila Albrecht Dos; Ribas, Alexandre; Quadros, Thiele Cabral Coelho; Blattner, Clarissa Netto; Boniatti, Márcio Manozzo",Revista Brasileira de terapia intensiva,https://doi.org/10.5935/0103-507x.20210057; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34586300/,487

OBJECTIVE To determine whether genetic alterations in the Barrett's mucosa can predict response to endoscopic therapy. DESIGN Retrospective cohort study. SETTING Tertiary-care institution. PATIENTS Selected patients who underwent endoscopic therapy for BE containing HGD/IMC between 2003 and 2010. INTERVENTIONS Endoscopic therapy combining mucosal resection and different ablation modalities was performed based on patient characteristics, endoscopic findings, and technique evolution. Fluorescence in situ hybridization was used to evaluate genetic alterations on baseline endoscopic cytology brushings by using probes directed to loci 8q24 (MYC), 9p21 (CDKN2A; alias P16), 17q12 (ERBB2; alias Her-2/neu), and 20q13.2 (ZNF217). MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS Genetic biomarkers predicting achievement of CRD after endoscopic therapy. RESULTS A total of 181 patients were included (145 men; 66 ± 10 years of age). There were 130 patients (72%) who responded to endoscopic therapy with CRD. Multiple gains detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization was found to be a negative predictor (hazard ratio 0.57; 95% confidence interval, 0.40-0.82) after adjusting for potential clinical confounders. Similar results were found when analyses were restricted to patients (n = 66) undergoing radiofrequency ablation (hazard ratio 0.58; 95% confidence interval, 0.31-1.09). LIMITATIONS Retrospective study, heterogeneity of treatment modalities. CONCLUSION Patients with multiple gains detected by brush cytology specimens may have a lower response rate to endoscopic therapy. The presence of multiple gains can be an adjunct to standard histology in prognosticating BE patients with HGD/IMC undergoing endoscopic therapy.","Timmer, Margriet R; Brankley, Shannon M; Gorospe, Emmanuel C; Sun, Gang; Lutzke, Lori S; Iyer, Prasad G; Halling, Kevin C; Krishnadath, Kausilia K; Wang, Kenneth K",Gastrointestinal endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gie.2014.06.023; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25085335/,487
149964,Prevention of hemolysis-induced organ damage by nutritional activation of the vagal anti-inflammatory reflex*.,2013,"PURPOSE We aimed to define the feasibility of the omission of routine insertion of a drain after pure laparoscopic donor nephrectomy (PLDN). We compared the outcomes between those with and without routine drain insertion. MATERIALS AND METHODS From July 2014 to October 2018, 178 PLDN were consecutively performed by a single surgeon. Since October 2016, we stopped routine insertion of a drain after PLDN. Thus, the former 80 drained routinely were defined as the Drainage group and the latter 98 were defined as the Non-drainage group. One patient drained non-routinely in the Non-drainage group was excluded from the final analysis. Operative and convalescence parameters and intra- and postoperative complications were compared between the groups. Intra- and postoperative complications within 90 days of surgery were graded using the Satava and Clavien-Dindo classifications, respectively. RESULTS Baseline characteristics were similar between the groups, except for concomitant surgery, American Society of Anesthesiologists score, and preoperative glomerular filtration rate. All operative and convalescence parameters were similar between the groups, except for postoperative glomerular filtration rate. The rates of overall intra- (22.5% versus 28.9%, p=0.337) and postoperative (62.5% versus 59.8%, p=0.713) complications were similar between the groups. The rates of potentially drain-related postoperative complications were also similar between the groups (36.3% versus 33.0%, p=0.650). Two patients per group suffered from major drain-related complications (2.5% versus 2.1%). CONCLUSIONS PLDN without routine drainage can be performed safely without an increase in postoperative morbidity.","An, Dong Hyeon; Han, Jae Hyeon; Jang, Myoung Jin; Aum, Joomin; Kim, Yu Seon; You, Dalsan",Investigative and clinical urology,https://doi.org/10.4111/icu.20200424; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33660444/,487

Apalutamide, enzalutamide, and most recently, darolutamide (novel androgen receptor antagonists) have been approved for nonmetastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (nmCRPC). Areas covered: The authors have evaluated darolutamide, covering all aspects of the clinical development, competence, and safety profile of the drug. Expert opinion: The unique structure of darolutamide is characterized by a high affinity for androgen receptors and detainment of antagonist activity in mutant isoforms of androgen receptors. In clinical practice, this is the main reason that makes darolutamide exceptional in terms of safety and efficacy compared to other drugs in this category. Darolutamide is considered to have the lowest probability for adverse events (AEs) compared to apalutamide and enzalutamide. Future studies, along with real-world clinical data are warranted to improve personalized treatment strategies as well as sequencing treatment between approved novel drugs.","Moussa, Mohamad; Lazarou, Lazaros; Dellis, Athanasios; Abou Chakra, Mohamed; Papatsoris, Athanasios",Expert opinion on pharmacotherapy,https://doi.org/10.1080/14656566.2020.1845650; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33135506/,487

Translational research suggests that regeneration upon hepatectomy may also alleviate metastatic recurrence; however, the significance in patients is unclear. We therefore sought to study the effect of liver regeneration on tumor recurrence in patients. METHODS In this retrospective cohort study, we included 58 out of 186 potentially eligible patients from our prospectively maintained database of CRC liver metastasis patients between 2001 and 2012 with a median follow-up of 42 months who underwent a formal right or left hemihepatectomy. Liver regeneration in CT volumetry was correlated with recurrence of CRC liver metastases and overall survival. RESULTS Liver regeneration increased up to 14 months to 21.0% for left and 122.6% for right hemihepatectomy, respectively, with comparable final volumes. Regeneration was independent of initial tumor stage, number of metastases, and preoperative chemotherapy. Patients with lower liver regeneration showed earlier recurrence of CRC liver metastases (p = 0.006). Overall survival did not differ in patients with weak versus strong liver regeneration. CONCLUSIONS The extent of liver regeneration after major hepatectomy does not impede overall survival. Therefore, our data encourage aggressive therapeutical regimes for CRC liver metastases involving major hepatectomies as part of a curative approach.","Hamm, Alexander; Hidding, Sarah; Mokry, Theresa; Radeleff, Boris; Mehrabi, Arianeb; Büchler, Markus W; Schneider, Martin; Schmidt, Thomas",Surgical oncology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.suronc.2020.07.001; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32818879/,487

The prevalence of smartphone usage amongst populations has assisted the provision of mobile applications that citizens can use to manage their health. Covid-19 symptom checker smartphone apps enable users to enter their health characteristics and receive validated advice related to self-isolation, testing and whether to seek clinical care. Moreover, the collection of symptom data can assist healthcare providers with disease surveillance and resource allocation. However, the adoption of symptom checker apps can be influenced by several factors including the functionality of the app, and data privacy and protection policies. In this study, we reviewed nine symptom checker apps that were available on the Android and iOS platforms. We analyzed characteristics related to the functionality and accessibility of the apps, and factors that related to privacy, transparency and trust. We found that most of the apps were multifunctional and several (n = 4) combined contact tracing and symptom checking functionalities. Moreover, there was variation in the quantity of personal data collected and symptom checking questions. For all the apps reviewed information related to privacy and data protection was available, however, there was variability in the content and readability of this material. Information regarding the technical profile of the apps was also inconsistent. For several of the apps, access to the symptom checking functionality was restricted by location.

The objective was to determine whether a filamentous phage peptide library could be employed to allow the oligoclonal bands to select their own target epitopes. METHODS CSF IgG antibody from 14 patients with multiple sclerosis and 14 controls was used to select individual phage clones from a bacteriophage library containing approximately 4 x 10(7) different hexamers expressed on its surface pIII protein. The amino acid sequence selected was deduced by sequencing the DNA of the genetically engineered insert. RESULTS In general, after three rounds of selection, CSF from both patients with multiple sclerosis and controls selected one to two consistent peptide motifs. Five out of 14 patients with multiple sclerosis, and one control, selected the amino acid sequence motif, RRPFF. Given 20 possible amino acids per position, the likelihood of five patients selecting the same linear five amino acid sequence is at most 1.6 x 10(-3), corrected for the number of clones sequenced. A GenBank computer search showed that this sequence is found in the Epstein-Barr Virus nuclear antigen (EBNA-1), and a heat shock protein alphaB crystallin. Human serum antibodies to a synthetic peptide containing RRPFF were virtually exclusively found in patients with prior infection by Epstein-Barr virus. Other studies have suggested a relation between Epstein-Barr virus infection and multiple sclerosis, including nearly 100% Epstein-Barr virus seropositivity among patients with multiple sclerosis and increased concentrations of antibody to EBNA in CSF of patients with multiple sclerosis. By antigen specific immunoblotting, antibodies to the RRPFF motif in the CSF were shown to correspond to a subset of oligoclonal bands in the CSF from the same patient. CONCLUSION This study shows that phage epitope display libraries may be used to select amino acid motifs which are potentially relevant to the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis.","Rand, K H; Houck, H; Denslow, N D; Heilman, K M","Journal of neurology, neurosurgery, and psychiatry",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9667560/,487

Protein sequences from a particular microorganism are compared to known autoimmune immunogens. For diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS), where the infectious agent is unknown, guesses to its identity are made. Mimics are assumed to be rare. This study takes a radically different approach. Reported sequences from all known human bacterial and viral agents were searched for autoimmune immunogen mimics. Three encephalitogenic peptides, whose autoimmune requirements have been studied extensively, were selected for comparison. Mimics were seen in a wide variety of organisms. For each immunogen, the mimics were found predominantly in nonpathogenic gut bacteria. Since the three immunogens used in this study are related to MS, it is suggested that a microorganism responsible for autoimmune activity in MS could be a normally occurring gut bacterium. This would explain many of the peculiar MS epidemiological data and why no infective agent has been identified for MS and supports recently found MS gut metabolism abnormalities.","Westall, Fred C",Journal of clinical microbiology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16757604/,487

RESULTS Mean age (TVC: 33.5 ± 3.0 year; SILC: 38.4 ± 3.3 year; 4PLC: 35.5 ± 4.1 year; p = 0.58) and mean BMI (TVC: 28.8 ± 1.5 kg/m(2); SILC: 31.8 ± 1 kg/m(2); 4PLC: 31.4 ± 2.2 kg/m(2); p = 0.35) were not statistically significant. However, mean operative time (TVC: 67 ± 3.9 min; SILC: 48.9 ± 2.6 min; 4PLC: 42.3 ± 3.9 min; p < 0.001) was significantly longer for TVC. Numerical pain scales showed significantly lower pain scores on POD 1 and 3 for TVC compared with SILC and 4PLC (TVC: 4.1 ± 0.5 and 2.9 ± 0.7; SILC: 6.1 ± 0.5 and 5.3 ± 0.5; 4PLC: 5.7 ± 0.4 and 4.7 ± 0.3; p = 0.02) with equilibration of pain scores by days 14 and 30. Return to work (TVC: 6.4 ± 1.5 days; SILC: 13.1 ± 1.3 days; 4PLC: 14.1 ± 1.4 days; p < 0.001) also was significantly faster for patients in the TVC group. One conversion in the TVC group to a 4PLC was necessary due to adhesions within the pelvis. One dislodged IUD was seen and immediately replaced in the TVC group. One hernia was observed in the SILC group. CONCLUSIONS Transvaginal cholecystectomy is a safe and well-tolerated procedure with statistically significantly less pain at 1 and 3 days after surgery, with a faster return to work but longer operative times compared with single incision and four-port laparoscopic cholecystectomy.","Solomon, Daniel; Shariff, Amir H; Silasi, Dan-Arin; Duffy, Andrew J; Bell, Robert L; Roberts, Kurt E",Surgical endoscopy,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22549370/,487

NDHHS initiated an outbreak investigation to identify additional cases and the cause of the illness. This report describes the results of that investigation, which indicated that 24 persons became ill, and the outbreak likely was the result of exposure to toxic levels of chloramines that had accumulated in the air in the enclosed space above the swimming pool.

RFA has been shown to be effective and safe. Circumferential RFA is delivered using the HALO(360+) Ablation System (Covidien, Inc., Mansfield, MA), which consists ofa high-power energy generator, a sizing balloon catheter, and a number of balloon-based ablation catheters with varying outer diameters. Focal RF energy is delivered using the HALO(90) or HALO(60) Ablation Systems (Covidien, Inc., Mansfield, MA), consisting of a radiofrequency energy generator and an endoscope-mounted electrode. Both RFA systems have official approval to be used in the United States, Europe, and other countries for the treatment of BE as well as in patients with gastric antral vascular ectasia and radiation proctopathy. With increasing widespread use of these systems, a full mastery of the equipment and therapeutic technique is essential to maximize eradication rates of BE while maintaining patient safety. A cost-effective patient selection and eradication protocol for RFA is essential to success with this technique in patients with BE. This article will discuss our experience with RFA treatment of BE using the HALO system for effective eradication of Barrett's dysplasia and early Barrett's cancer and review available data especially from the U.S. National Registry.","Wolf, David S; Dunkin, Brian J; Ertan, Atilla",Surgical technology international,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23292670/,487
201824,Severe asthma patients experience and satisfaction with virtual clinics in a large tertiary care hospital during covid-19 period,2021,"Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) continues to circulate worldwide, with a significant impact on the poultry industry and affecting both vaccinated and unvaccinated flocks. Several studies have focused on the hypervariable regions (HVRs) of the spike gene (S1); however, genetic and bioinformatics studies of the whole S1 gene are limited. In this study, the whole S1 gene of five Egyptian IBVs was genetically analyzed. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the Egyptian IBVs are clustered within two distinct groups: the classic group resembling the GI-1 genotype (vaccine strains) and the variant group (field strains) of the GI-23 genotype. The variant genotype was divided into two distinct subgroups (Egy/var I and Egy/var II) resembling the Israeli variants IS/1494 and IS885 strain, respectively. Significant amino acid sequence differences between the two subgroups, especially in the epitope sites, were identified. A deletion at position 63 and an I69A/S substitution mutation associated with virus tropism were detected in the receptor-binding sites. The deduced amino acid sequence of HVRs of the variant subgroups indicated different genetic features in comparison to the classic vaccine group (H120 lineage). The Egyptian variant IBVs also contained additional N-glycosylation sites compared to the classical viruses. Recombination analysis gave evidence for distinct patterns of origin by recombination throughout the S1 gene, suggesting that the recent virus IBV-EG/1586CV-2015 emerged as a recombinant of two viruses from the variant groups Egy/var I and Egy/var II, providing another example of intra-genotypic recombination among IBVs and the first example of recombination within the GI-23 genotype. Our data suggest that both mutation and recombination may be contributing to the emergence of IBV variants. Moreover, we found that the commercially used vaccines are genotypically distant from the circulating field strains. Hence, continuous follow-up of the current vaccine strategy is highly recommended for better control and prevention of infectious bronchitis virus in the poultry sector in Egypt.","Zanaty, Ali; Naguib, Mahmoud M; El-Husseiny, Mohamed H; Mady, Wesam; Hagag, Naglaa; Arafa, Abdel-Satar",Archives of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27604121/,487

It is not known for certain if there is an association between any pharmacological agent used for rheumatologic treatment, including biological and non-biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), and an increased risk of COVID-19 acquisition or adverse outcomes from COVID-19, although these agents have been associated with an overall higher risk of infections. The pharmacological management of patients with a rheumatic disease without COVID-19 should currently follow usual treatment approaches. Individualized approaches to adjusting DMARD regimens in patients with documented COVID-19 seems prudent, with specific attention paid to the severity of the infection. Patients receiving antimalarials (hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine) may continue treatment with these agents. Treatment with sulfasalazine, methotrexate, leflunomide, immunosuppressants and biological agents other than interluekin-6 receptor inhibitors and JAK inhibitors should be stopped or withheld. It should be reasonable to resume DMARD treatment when patients are no longer symptomatic and at least 2 weeks after documentation of COVID-19, although the decision should be individualized, preferably based on infection severity.","Kow, Chia Siang; Hasan, Syed Shahzad",Drugs Ther Perspect,,487

217996,Investigating the relationship between COVID-19-related and distress and ICD-11 adjustment disorder: Two cross-sectional studies,2020,"Total mortality and ""burden of disease"" in Germany and Italy and their states and regions were explored during the first COVID-19 wave by using publicly available data for 16 German states and 20 Italian regions from January 2016 to June 2020. Based on expectations from 2016 to 2019, simplified Standardized Mortality Ratios (SMRs) for deaths occurring in the first half of 2020 and the effect of changed excess mortality in terms of ""burden of disease"" were assessed. Moreover, whether two German states and 19 Italian cities appropriately represent the countries within the European monitoring of excess mortality for public health action (EuroMOMO) network was explored. Significantly elevated SMRs were observed (Germany: week 14-18, Italy: week 11-18) with SMR peaks in week 15 in Germany (1.15, 95%-CI: 1.09-1.21) and in week 13 in Italy (1.79, 95%-CI: 1.75-1.83). Overall, SMRs were 1.00 (95%-CI: 0.97-1.04) in Germany and 1.06 (95%-CI: 1.03-1.10) in Italy. Significant SMR heterogeneity was found within both countries. Age and sex were strong modifiers. Loss of life expectancy was 0.34 days (1.66 days in men) for Germany and 5.3 days (6.3 days in men) for Italy [with upper limits of 3 and 6 weeks among elderly populations (&#8805;65 years) after maximum potential bias adjustments]. Restricted data used within EuroMOMO neither represents mortality in the countries as a whole nor in their states and regions adequately.

239521,COVID 19 Testing Cannot Replace Clinical Judgement,2021,"MAIN CONCLUSION: Responses of plant biomass and yield components to warming are species-specific and are shifted as increased warming magnitude rises; this finding improves the results of IPCC AR5. The responses of crop yields to climatic warming have been extensively reported from experimental results, historical yield collections, and modeling research. However, an integrative report on the responses of plant biomass and yield components of three major crops to experimental warming is lacking. Here, a meta-analysis based on the most recent warming experiments was conducted to quantify the climatic warming responses of the biomass, grain yield (GY), and yield components of three staple crops. The results showed that the wheat total aboveground biomass (TAGB) increased by 6.0% with general warming, while the wheat GY did not significantly respond to warming; however, the responses shifted with increases in the mean growing season temperature (MGST). Negative effects on wheat TAGB and GY appeared when the MGSTs were above 15 °C and 13 °C, respectively. The wheat GY and the number of grains per panicle decreased by 8.4% and 7.5%, respectively, per degree Celsius increase. Increases in temperature significantly reduced the rice TAGB and GY by 4.3% and 16.6%, respectively, but rice straw biomass increased with increasing temperature. However, the rice grain weight and the number of panicles decreased with continuous increasing temperature (&#916;Ta). The maize biomass, GY, and yield components all generally decreased with climatic warming. Finally, the crop responses to climatic warming were significantly influenced by warming time, warming treatment facility, and methods. Our findings can improve the assessment of crop responses to climatic warming and are useful for ensuring food security while combating future global climate change.","Liu, Xiaodi; Ma, Quanhui; Yu, Hongying; Li, Yibo; Zhou, Li; He, Qijin; Xu, Zhenzhu; Zhou, Guangsheng",Planta,,487

Whereas Carsonella_DC is a typical nutritional symbiont, Profftella_DC is a unique defensive symbiont with organelle-like features including intracellular localization within the host, perfect infection in host populations, vertical transmission over evolutionary time, and drastic genome reduction down to much less than 1 Mb. Large parts of the 460 kb genome of Profftella_DC are devoted to genes for synthesizing a polyketide toxin; diaphorin. To better understand the evolution of this unusual symbiont, the present study analyzed the genome of Profftella_Dco, a sister lineage to Profftella_DC, using Diaphorina cf. continua, a host psyllid congeneric with D. citri. The genome of co-residing Carsonella (Carsonella_Dco) was also analyzed. The analysis revealed nearly perfect synteny conservation in these genomes with their counterparts from D. citri. The substitution rate analysis further demonstrated genomic stability of Profftella which is comparable to that of Carsonella. Profftella_Dco and Profftella_DC shared all genes for the biosynthesis of diaphorin, hemolysin, riboflavin, biotin, and carotenoids, underlining multiple roles of Profftella, which may contribute to stabilizing symbiotic relationships with the host. However, acyl carrier proteins (ACPs) were extensively amplified in polyketide synthases DipP and DipT for diaphorin synthesis in Profftella_Dco. This level of ACP augmentation, unprecedented in modular polyketide synthases of any known organism, is not thought to influence the polyketide structure but may improve the synthesis efficiency.","Nakabachi, Atsushi; Piel, Jörn; Malenovský, Igor; Hirose, Yuu",Genome biol. evol,,487

The use of sample pools was also investigated. METHODS: A total of 2107 paired samples were collected from asymptomatic healthcare and office workers in Mexico City. Sixty of these samples were also analyzed in two other independent laboratories for concordance analysis. Sample processing and analysis of virus genetic material were performed according to standard protocols described elsewhere. A pooling analysis was performed by analyzing the saliva pool and the individual pool components. RESULTS: The concordance between NPS and saliva results was 95.2% (kappa 0.727, p = 0.0001) and 97.9% without considering inconclusive results (kappa 0.852, p = 0.0001). Saliva had a lower number of inconclusive results than NPS (0.9% vs 1.9%). Furthermore, saliva showed a significantly higher concentration of both total RNA and viral copies than NPS. Comparison of our results with those of the other two laboratories showed 100% and 97% concordance. Saliva samples are stable without the use of any preservative, and a positive SARS-CoV-2 sample can be detected 5, 10, and 15 days after collection when the sample is stored at 4 °C. CONCLUSIONS: The study results indicate that saliva is as effective as NPS for the identification of SARS-CoV-2-infected asymptomatic patients. Sample pooling facilitates the analysis of a larger number of samples, with the benefit of cost reduction.","Herrera, Luis A; Hidalgo-Miranda, Alfredo; Reynoso-Noverón, Nancy; Meneses-García, Abelardo A; Mendoza-Vargas, Alfredo; Reyes-Grajeda, Juan P; Vadillo-Ortega, Felipe; Cedro-Tanda, Alberto; Peñaloza, Fernando; Frías-Jimenez, Emmanuel; Arriaga-Canon, Cristian; Ruiz, Rosaura; Angulo, Ofelia; López-Villaseñor, Imelda; Amador-Bedolla, Carlos; Vilar-Compte, Diana; Cornejo, Patricia; Cisneros-Villanueva, Mireya; Hurtado-Cordova, Eduardo; Cendejas-Orozco, Mariana; Hernández-Morales, José S; Moreno, Bernardo; Hernández-Cruz, Irwin A; Herrera, César A; García, Francisco; González-Woge, Miguel A; Munguía-Garza, Paulina; Luna-Maldonado, Fernando; Sánchez-Vizcarra, Antonia; Osnaya, Vincent G; Medina-Molotla, Nelly; Alfaro-Mora, Yair; Cáceres-Gutiérrez, Rodrigo E; Tolentino-García, Laura; Rosas-Escobar, Patricia; Román-González, Sergio A; Escobar-Arrazola, Marco A; Canseco-Méndez, Julio C; Ortiz-Soriano, Diana R; Domínguez-Ortiz, Julieta; González-Barrera, Ana D; Aparicio-Bautista, Diana I; Cruz-Rangel, Armando; Alarcón-Zendejas, Ana Paula; Contreras-Espinosa, Laura; González, Rodrigo; Guerra-Calderas, Lissania; Meraz-Rodríguez, Marco A; Montalvo-Casimiro, Michel; Montiel-Manríquez, Rogelio",Int J Infect Dis,,487

METHODS: We conducted a quality-improvement initiative from May 28-June 25, 2020, during the first 4 weeks of universal SARS-CoV-2 testing in the Barnes-Jewish Hospital labor and delivery unit. All consecutive patients presenting for delivery without coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) symptoms were offered testing over four 1-week phases. Phase I documented the rate of testing uptake. Phase II recorded patients' reasons for declining testing. Phase III used phase II findings to create and implement shared decision-making tools. Phase IV offered each patient who declined nasopharyngeal testing an oropharyngeal alternative. The primary outcome was rate of SARS-CoV-2 testing uptake by phase. RESULTS: Of 270 patients, 223 (83%) accepted testing and 47 (17%) declined. Maternal age and mode of delivery were similar between groups, whereas testing uptake was higher among nulliparous, White, Hispanic, or privately insured patients. There was a significant increase in the primary outcome of SARS-CoV-2 testing across phases I-IV, from 68% to 76% to 94% to 95%, respectively (Somers' D 0.45; 95% CI of association 0.30-0.59). The most commonly cited reason for declining testing was concern regarding testing discomfort. In subgroup analyses by race and insurance type, there was a significant increase in testing uptake across phases I-IV for Black patients (56%, 54%, 91%, 92%; Somers' D 0.36; 95% CI of association 0.28-0.64), White patients (76%, 93%, 96%, 100%; Somers' D 0.59; 95% CI of association 0.38-0.8), those with Medicaid insurance (60%, 64%, 88%, 92%; 95%; Somers' D 0.39; CI of association 0.22 to 0.56), and those with private insurance (77%, 96%, 97%, 100%; Somers' D 0.63; 95% CI of association 0.40-0.86). CONCLUSION: Universal SARS-CoV-2 testing uptake significantly increased through a rapid-cycle improvement initiative.

252556,The Effect of COVID-19 on Diabetic Ketoacidosis Management and Outcomes: The Experience of Two NYC Hospitals,2021,"This paper reports the results of a Bayesian analysis on large-scale empirical data to assess the effectiveness of eleven types of COVID-control policies that have been implemented at various levels of intensity in 40 countries and U.S. states since the onset of the pandemic. The analysis estimates the marginal impact of each type and level of policy as implemented in concert with other policies. The purpose is to provide policymakers and the general public with an estimate of the relative effectiveness of various COVID-control strategies. We find that a set of widely implemented core policies reduces the spread of virus but not by enough to contain the pandemic except in a few highly compliant jurisdictions. The core policies include the cancellation of public events, restriction of gatherings to fewer than 100 people, recommendation to stay at home, recommended restrictions on internal movement, implementation of a partial international travel ban, and coordination of information campaigns. For the median jurisdiction, these policies reduce growth rate in new infections from an estimated 270% per week to approximately 49% per week, but this impact is insufficient to prevent eventual transmission throughout the population because containment occurs only when a jurisdiction reduces growth in COVID infection to below zero. Most jurisdictions must also implement additional policies, each of which has the potential to reduce weekly COVID growth rate by 10 percentage points or more. The slate of these additional high-impact policies includes targeted or full workplace closings for all but essential workers, stay-at-home requirements, and targeted school closures.","Wibbens, Phebo D; Koo, Wesley Wu-Yi; McGahan, Anita M",PLoS One,,487

COVID-19 spread rapidly affecting over 30 million worldwide. To manage trauma presentations the Department of Trauma & Orthopaedic Surgery reorganised service delivery. AIM: To assess the impact of service reorganisation and Virtual Clinics on patients in a Regional Unit in Ireland. METHODS: A retrospective review of trauma activity following introduction of Virtual Fracture Clinics and Theatre COVID Pathways for a 10 week period in comparison with the same 2019 period. All patients underwent both nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs PCR testing prior to operations. Theatre and outpatient activity were evaluated. Clinic data were accumulated using the Integrated Patient Management System. RESULTS: Theatre Activity: 242 patients underwent surgery in our trauma unit (mean 2.98 per list) during the COVID- 19 period. 29 cases were performed in repurposed elective hospital giving a total of 271 during the 2020 study period. 371 cases were performed in the same 2019 period (mean 4.58 per list). Outpatient Activity: We noted a 25.86% fracture clinic referral reduction during the COVID 19 period compared to 2019. There was a 150.77% increase in patients managed through Trauma Assessment Clinic. 639 patients were managed through the Virtual Fracture Clinic Pathway during COVID 19 period. CONCLUSIONS: Over one in four fracture clinic patients can be managed virtually. A new dedicated Acute Fracture Unit within our institution permitted streamlining of care and social distancing. The ""Non-COVID"" pathway for ambulatory trauma was essential in managing the growing presentations of these injuries.","Stanley, Ciaran; Kelly, Martin; Elzaki, Mohamed; Butler, Audrey; Condon, Finbarr; Lenehan, Brian",Surg.

Attaching filters that remove viral particles in air from the expiratory limb of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) devices should theoretically decrease the risk. However, adding filters to the expiratory limb could add to expiratory resistance and thereby increase the imposed work of breathing (WOB). OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effects on imposed WOB when attaching filters to the expiratory limb of CPAP devices. METHODS: Two filters were tested on three CPAP systems at two levels of CPAP in a mechanical lung model. Main outcome was imposed WOB. RESULTS: There was a minor increase in imposed WOB when attaching the filters. The differences between the two filters were small. CONCLUSION: To minimise contaminated aerosol generation during CPAP treatment, filters can be attached to expiratory tubing with only a minimal increase in imposed WOB in a non-humidified environment. Care has to be taken to avoid filter obstruction and replace filters as recommended.","Donaldsson, Snorri; Naver, Lars; Jonsson, Baldvin; Drevhammar, Thomas",Arch Dis Child Fetal Neonatal Ed,,487

METHODS: 255 CT-guided lung biopsies performed for 249 lesions in 249 patients from August 2014 to August 2019 were retrospectively analysed using multivariate logistic regression analysis. Risk prediction models were established using backward stepwise variable selection and likelihood ratio tests and were internally validated using split-sample methods. RESULTS: The overall incidence of pneumothorax was 30.2% (77/255). ICC insertion was required for 8.32% (21/255) of all procedures. The significant independent risk factors for pneumothorax were lesions not in contact with pleura (P < 0.001), a shorter skin-to-pleura distance (P = 0.01), the needle crossing a fissure (P = 0.004) and emphysema (P = 0.01); those for ICC insertion for pneumothorax were a needle through emphysema (P < 0.001) and lesions in the upper lobe (P = 0.017). AUC of the predictive models for pneumothorax and ICC insertion were 0.800 (95% CI: 0.745-0.856) and 0.859 (95% CI: 0.779-0.939) respectively. Upon internal validation, AUC of the testing sets of pneumothorax and ICC insertion were 0.769 and 0.822 on average respectively. CONCLUSION: The complication rates of pneumothorax and ICC insertion after CT-guided lung biopsy at our institution are comparable to results from previously reported studies. This study provides highly accurate risk prediction models of pneumothorax and ICC insertion for patients undergoing CT-guided lung biopsies.","Weon, JangHo; Robson, Scott; Chan, Ronald; Ussher, Simon",J. med. imaging radiat. oncol.

303909,"Procalcitonin levels in COVID-19 patients are strongly associated with mortality and ICU acceptance in an underserved, inner city population",2021,"How can political elites learn from the past to enhance sustainability of their leadership in a pandemic situation? In this article, we develop a theoretical framework of policy implementation that combines collaboration from public and private sectors (""Public-Private Partnership,"" or PPP) to efficiently deal with urgent crises such as COVID-19. We explain the role of new institutions prompted by policy failure precedence (Time 1) that at a later time period (Time 2) allow for the activation of PPPs with the aim to extend the political life of incumbent leaderships. Specifically, we examine the case of South Korea, a country in which a prior case of MERS in 2015 (Time 1) had established new policies for pandemic governance. In 2020, such policies were activated by the incumbent leadership in order to contain COVID-19 (Time 2). In particular, for swift and effective management of the pandemic, the South Korean government utilized partnerships with the private sector to exponentially increase the amount of Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) testing. We apply Policy Feedback Theory to demonstrate the political effects of failed policy precedents and how the political outcomes again shape new policies in a dynamic and cyclical manner. Empirically, we conduct a content analysis of South Korea's pharmaceutical sector in government procurement and exports of test-kits during the COVID-19 pandemic. We show that as the pandemic situation progressed, South Korea's leader, who had been in danger of plummeting support to the extent that impeachment was discussed as a viable option, drastically shifted public opinion to achieve a landslide victory in general elections in April 2020. Our findings suggest that democratic governments, aware of precedents and wary of their fate in elections, are pressured to perform well in crisis management, and thus turn to rapidly mobilizing public and private means for survival. Such means are evidenced by the case of emergency use authorization (EUA) process for test-kits, in which ""leapfrogging players"" - up-and-coming innovators - that contribute to turning a pandemic crisis into an opportunity for sustainable leadership and for themselves.","Park, June; Chung, Eunbin",World Dev,,487

The American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) recommended endoscopy management as soon as possible and not more than 12 hours after presentation. The United King guidelines recommended endoscopy for unstable patients with severe acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding immediately after resuscitation and within 24 hours of admission. The aim of the study is to evaluate the outcome of endoscopic management of AOVH in less than 12 hours compared to 12-24 hours post admission. METHODS: We recruited 297 patients with AOVH. The patients were divided into groups depending on the timing of the endoscopic management: 180 within 12 h of admission and 117 patients at 12-24 hours of admission. Routine clinical and laboratory data were collected. RESULTS: Compared to patients with endoscopic management at 12-24 hours (mean 16 hours), patients with endoscopic management within 12 hours (mean 8.3 hours) of admission had fewer hospital stay days (P= 0.001), significant reduction of ammonia levels (P< 0.0001) and significant improvement in associated hepatic encephalopathy grade (p=0.048). There were no major clinical vents in the <12 hour group, but 8 events in the 12-24 hour group (p<0.01). CONCLUSION: Endoscopic management of acute esophageal variceal bleeding within 12 hours of admission is superior to endoscopic management at 12-24 hours of admission regarding, reduction of hospital stay, ammonia levels, correction of hepatic encephalopathy, re-bleeding and mortality rate, hence, reduce the cost of treatment, benefiting patient satisfaction and hospital bed availability.","Mousa, N; Abdel-Razik, A; Sheta, T; G Deiab, A; Habib, A; El-Diasty, M; Eldesoky, A; Taha, A; Mousa, E; Yassen, A; Fathy, A; Elgamal, A",Br. j. biomed. sci,,487

En este artículo sostendré que ese pegamento es el contrato social Cuando ese pegamento existe, progreso económico, social y político avanzan de la mano Sucedió así en los llamados ""Treinta Gloriosos"", las tres décadas que siguieron a la Gran Depresión de los Treinta y la Segunda Guerra mundial Sin embargo, a partir de los años ochenta del siglo pasado ese pegamento se fue disolviendo y, en paralelo, el crecimiento económico dejó de ser sinónimo de progreso social y la democracia entró en barrena El reto ahora es reconstruir ese pegamento, al modo como se logró tras las grandes guerras En mi opinión, ese pegamento, en primer lugar, ha de venir de un nuevo contrato social postpandémico En segundo lugar, el núcleo de ese nuevo contrato social está en la reforma de la empresa para corregir la mala distribución del excedente (valor añadido) entre salarios, sueldos de altos directivos y dividendos Un nuevo contrato social progresista tiene que apoyarse en la recuperación del papel fundamental del tercer pilar de la prosperidad: la Economía social Alternate abstract:Beyond the insidious and morally contemptible personality of the authoritarian political leaders that have emerged in the last decade, the political ""supply"" of populism responds to a real ""demand"" for popular policies that exists in advanced societies This demands a rebalancing of economic policies in favour of the working classes, the middle classes and the social groups that have not benefited from the economic growth of the last decades This social demand responds to an objective cause: the increase in inequalities and economic insecurity Coinciding with the neoliberal shift in social and economic policies that accompanied the shift to conservatism in the late 1970s and with the hyper-globalization and the change of skin that global corporate capitalism experienced from the 1990s onward, large groups of middle classes in developed countries saw their jobs, their welfare, their opportunities, and the lifestyles of the communities in which they lived disappear or deteriorate The Covid-19 pandemic has only accentuated these inequalities This malaise with inequality and economic insecurity is fertile ground for political polarization and authoritarian political populism In this sense, inequality and economic insecurity have acted as a powerful solvent of the glue that every liberal society needs to function harmoniously, to make the market economy inclusive, and to prevent democracy from falling into the chaos of authoritarian populism The challenge now is to rebuild that glue, as it was done after the Great Depression of the 1930s and World War II This essay argues, first, that this glue must come from a new post-pandemic social contract Secondly, that the core of that new social contract is in the reform of the enterprise to correct the misallocation of surplus (value added) between wages, top management salaries and dividends The correction of this malfunctioning distribution requires investigating its causes Here it is argued that there are two On the one hand, the bias that capitalism acquired from the eighties in benefit of shareholders and to the detriment of workers, suppliers, customers and communities On the other hand, that corporate concentration and the market power acquired by large corporations has led to stagnation of real wages and the precarization of employment The malfunctioning of distribution is not, however, the only source of inequality and economic insecurity They also come from the malfunctioning of pre-distribution To the extent that technological change has opened a gap between the capabilities and skills of the population and the professional profiles needed by companies, this gap brings about inequality of income and employment opportunities On the other hand, the redistributive mechanisms of the Welfare State, both taxes and social programs, have seen their capacity to correct the inequality produced by the economy reduced To respond to this inequality and economic insecurity, the political offer of new social contracts is wide and varied: the neoliberal, the extreme right, the extreme left and the radical progressive All try to respond to the problem of distribution, but they do so through different paths, depending on whether they emphasize pre-distribution, redistribution, or distribution The historical experience of the 1930s teaches us that not everyone is well reconciled with the future A new progressive social contract must be based on the recovery of the fundamental role of the third pillar of prosperity: the Social Economy Its abandonment in recent decades in favour of the market and the State is one of the causes of the inability of market economies to generate good jobs now","Costas, Antón",CIRIEC - Espana,,487

334806,"Learning from the First Wave of the Pandemic in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland",2021,"Introduction: The unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic unveiled a strong need for advanced and informative surveillance tools. The Centre for Health Informatics (CHI) at the University of Calgary took action to develop a surveillance dashboard, which would facilitate the education of the public, and answer critical questions posed by local and national government. Objectives: The objective of this study was to create an interactive method of surveillance, or a ""COVID-19 Tracker"" for Canadian use. The Tracker offers user-friendly graphics characterizing various aspects of the current pandemic (e.g. case count, testing, hospitalizations, and policy interventions). Methods: Six publicly available data sources were used, and were selected based on the frequency of updates, accuracy and types of data, and data presentation. The datasets have different levels of granularity for different provinces, which limits the information that we are able to show. Additionally, some datasets have missing entries, for which the ""last observation carried forward"" method was used. The website was created and hosted online, with a backend server, which is updated on a daily basis. The Tracker development followed an iterative process, as new figures were added to meet the changing needs of policy-makers. Results: The resulting Tracker is a dashboard that visualizes real-time data, along with policy interventions from various countries, via user-friendly graphs with a hover option that reveals detailed information. The interactive features allow the user to customize the figures by jurisdiction, country/region, and the type of data shown. Data is displayed at the national and provincial level, as well as by health regions. Conclusion: The COVID-19 Tracker offers real-time, detailed, and interactive visualizations that have the potential to shape crucial decision-making and inform Albertans and Canadians of the current pandemic.","Krusina, A.; Chen, O.; Varela, L.

339264,Circulating micrornas as biomarkers of COVID-19 severity,2021,"INTRODUCTION AND AIMS: The Australian Treatment Outcomes Profile (ATOP) is a brief clinical tool measuring recent substance use, health and wellbeing among clients attending alcohol and other drug (AOD) treatment services. It has previously been assessed for concurrent validity and inter-rater reliability. In this study we examine whether it is suitable for administration over the telephone. DESIGN AND METHODS: We recruited a sample of 107 AOD clients across public sector specialist AOD treatment services in New South Wales, Australia between 2016 and 2018. Participants had a mean age of 47 years and 46% were female. Participants completed a face-to-face ATOP and a phone ATOP with a researcher within 5 days. Comparisons between the two administration modes were undertaken using Spearman's rank correlation coefficient for continuous or ordinal variables, and Cohen's Kappa for nominal variables. RESULTS: Among 107 participants, 59% were attending for alcohol treatment and 41% for opioid treatment. Most ATOP items (76%) reached above 0.7 (good) or 0.9 (excellent) agreement between face-to-face and telephone use. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that the ATOP is a suitable instrument for telephone monitoring of recent substance use, health and social functioning among AOD clients. Its validation for remote use over the telephone will support staff to monitor clients' risks and outcomes-of particular relevance in response to the COVID-19 pandemic in which services are increasingly relying on telework approaches to client monitoring.","Deacon, Rachel M; Mammen, Kristie; Holmes, Jennifer; Dunlop, Adrian; Bruno, Raimondo; Mills, Llewellyn; Graham, Robert; Lintzeris, Nicholas",Drug Alcohol Rev,,487
344950,Prone Position in Covid-19: Can We Tackle the Rising Dead Space?,2021,"BACKGROUND: Vaccines are one of the most important achievements of modern medicine. However, their acceptance is only partial, with vaccine hesitancy and refusal representing a major health threat. Influenza vaccines have low compliance since repeated, annual vaccination is required. Influenza vaccines stimulate discussions both in the real world and online. Social media is currently a significant source of health and medical information. Elucidating the association between social media engagement and influenza vaccination is important and may be applicable to other vaccines, including ones against COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study is to characterize profiles of social media engagement regarding the influenza vaccine and their association with knowledge and compliance in order to support improvement of future web-associated vaccination campaigns. METHODS: A weblink to an online survey in Hebrew was disseminated over social media and messaging platforms. The survey answers were collected during April 2020. Anonymous and volunteer participants aged 21 years and over answered 30 questions related to sociodemographics; social media usage; influenza- and vaccine-related knowledge and behavior; health-related information searching, its reliability, and its influence; and COVID-19-related information searching. A univariate descriptive data analysis was performed, followed by multivariate analysis via building a decision tree to define the most important attributes associated with vaccination compliance. RESULTS: A total of 213 subjects responded to the survey, of whom 207 were included in the analysis; the majority of the respondents were female, were aged 21 to 40 years, had 1 to 2 children, lived in central Israel, were secular Israeli natives, had higher education, and had a salary close to the national average. Most respondents (128/207, 61.8%) were not vaccinated against influenza in 2019 and used social media. Participants that used social media were younger, secular, and living in high-density agglomerations and had lower influenza vaccination rates. The perceived influence and reliability of the information on social media about COVID-19 were generally similar to those perceptions about influenza. CONCLUSIONS: Using social media is negatively linked to compliance with seasonal influenza vaccination in this study. A high proportion of noncompliant individuals can lead to increased consumption of health care services and can, therefore, overload these health services. This is particularly crucial with a concomitant outbreak, such as COVID-19. Health care professionals should use improved and targeted health communication campaigns with the aid of experts in social media. Targeted communication, based on sociodemographic factors and personalized social media usage, might increase influenza vaccination rates and compliance with other vaccines as well.","Benis, Arriel; Khodos, Anna; Ran, Sivan; Levner, Eugene; Ashkenazi, Shai",J Med Internet Res,,487

355093,The authors reply,2021,"The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant influence on the lives of people around the world and could be a risk factor for mental health diseases. This study aimed to explore the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic by identifying patterns related to post-traumatic symptoms by considering personality and defensive styles. Specifically, it was hypothesized that neuroticism was negatively associated with impact of event, as opposed to extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, and openness traits. The mediation role of mature, neurotic, and immature defenses in these relationships was also investigated. This study involved 557 Italian individuals (71.3% women, 28.7% men; Mage = 34.65, SD = 12.05), who completed an online survey including the Impact of Event Scale-Revised, Forty Item Defense Style Questionnaire (DSQ-40) and Ten Item Personality Inventory. Results showed a nonsignificant effect for extraversion and openness on impact of event. The negative influence of neuroticism was instead confirmed in a partial parallel mediation involving significant effects from immature and neurotic defenses in the indirect path. Finally, agreeableness and conscientiousness delineated two protective pathways regarding impact of event, determining two total parallel mediation models in which both these personality traits were negatively associated with immature defensive styles, and conscientiousness was also positively related to mature defenses. These findings provide an exploration post-traumatic symptom patterns during the COVID-19 pandemic, involving the big five personality traits and defense mechanisms. These results may be useful for developing interventions, treatments, and prevention activities.","Gori, Alessio; Topino, Eleonora; Palazzeschi, Letizia; Di Fabio, Annamaria",PLoS One,,487

Expression and self-assembly of the viral structural proteins can take place in various living or cell-free expression systems after which the viral structures can be assembled and reconstructed. VLPs are gaining in popularity in the field of preventive medicine and to date, a wide range of VLP-based candidate vaccines have been developed for immunization against various infectious agents, the latest of which is the vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, the efficacy of which is being evaluated. VLPs are highly immunogenic and are able to elicit both the antibody- and cell-mediated immune responses by pathways different from those elicited by conventional inactivated viral vaccines. However, there are still many challenges to this surface display system that need to be addressed in the future. VLPs that are classified as subunit vaccines are subdivided into enveloped and non- enveloped subtypes both of which are discussed in this review article. VLPs have also recently received attention for their successful applications in targeted drug delivery and for use in gene therapy. The development of more effective and targeted forms of VLP by modification of the surface of the particles in such a way that they can be introduced into specific cells or tissues or increase their half-life in the host is likely to expand their use in the future. Recent advances in the production and fabrication of VLPs including the exploration of different types of expression systems for their development, as well as their applications as vaccines in the prevention of infectious diseases and cancers resulting from their interaction with, and mechanism of activation of, the humoral and cellular immune systems are discussed in this review.","Nooraei, Saghi; Bahrulolum, Howra; Hoseini, Zakieh Sadat; Katalani, Camellia; Hajizade, Abbas; Easton, Andrew J; Ahmadian, Gholamreza",J Nanobiotechnology,,487

A Case of New-Onset Diabetes Mellitus with Severe Diabetic Ketoacidosis Precipitated by Mild COVID-19 Pneumonia,2021,"The positive effects of breastfeeding on the health of infants and mothers are largely established. It is generally recommended that a mother should breastfeed exclusively for at least 6 months. Sometimes, however, this is not possible owing to a maternal disease. The purpose of this review was to understand the possibility and the mechanisms of transmission of viral agents to breastfed infants when the mother is infected and to evaluate whether and when breastfeeding can be harmful and, therefore, a real contraindication exists. In order to produce this narrative review, an extensive literature search was conducted on PubMed. The query included ""breastfeeding"", ""mother to child"" and ""transmission"" as keywords and a filter for publication date - from 2014 to 2019. Additionally, the bibliography of the selected articles was reviewed to identify further pertinent studies, which were then included. Only the following maternal infections were found to represent an absolute contraindication to breastfeeding: Human Immunodeficiency Virus and Human T-Lymphotropic Virus, because of their possible transmission via milk, and Ebola Virus, in which transmission to the child seems to be linked more to the close proximity relationship itself than the presence of the virus in human milk. Other viruses - Herpes Simplex Virus, Varicella Zoster Virus and Hepatitis C Virus - constituted a source of contraindication only in specific high-risk circumstances. To date, for the remaining viruses reviewed in this paper - including Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2, no evidence exists that warrants contraindication of breastfeeding. Health professionals who deal with pregnant and puerperal women, such as obstetricians, pediatricians or family medicine doctors, must be aware of these particularities in the management of breastfeeding women in order to provide correct information and better take care of their patients and their respective infants.","Pimentel, A.; Pissarra, S.; Rocha, G.; Guimaraes, H.",Journal of Pediatric and Neonatal Individualized Medicine,,487

389804,Do-Not-Resuscitate Reversals: Big Data and the Hospital Effect,2021,"The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak requires rapid reshaping of rehabilitation services to include patients recovering from severe COVID-19 with post-intensive care syndromes, which results in physical deconditioning and cognitive impairments, patients with comorbid conditions, and other patients requiring physical therapy during the outbreak with no or limited access to hospital and rehabilitation centers. Considering the access barriers to quality rehabilitation settings and services imposed by social distancing and stay-at-home orders, these patients can be benefited from providing access to affordable and good quality care through home-based rehabilitation. The success of such treatment will depend highly on the intensity of the therapy and effort invested by the patient. Monitoring patients' compliance and designing a home-based rehabilitation that can mentally engage them are the critical elements in home-based therapy's success. Hence, we study the state-of-the-art telerehabilitation frameworks and robotic devices, and comment about a hybrid model that can use existing telerehabilitation framework and home-based robotic devices for treatment and simultaneously assess patient's progress remotely. Second, we comment on the patients' social support and engagement, which is critical for the success of telerehabilitation service. As the therapists are not physically present to guide the patients, we also discuss the adaptability requirement of home-based telerehabilitation. Finally, we suggest that the reformed rehabilitation services should consider both home-based solutions for enhancing the activities of daily living and an on-demand ambulatory rehabilitation unit for extensive training where we can monitor both cognitive and motor performance of the patients remotely.","Manjunatha, H.; Pareek, S.; Jujjavarapu, S.

397619,Neurological Sequalae in Severe COVID-19 Infection,2021,"BACKGROUND: Nursing home residents are generally old and frail, and at high risk that COVID-19 will take a serious course. Outbreaks of COVID-19 have not previously been described in Norway, and it is important to identify mechanisms for spread of the infection and course of disease for nursing home residents with this pandemic disease. MATERIAL AND METHOD: We included residents from three nursing homes with outbreaks of COVID-19 in a retrospective observational study, and we retrieved information on the number of staff for whom SARS-CoV-2 was confirmed or who were placed in quarantine. We present resident characteristics, course of disease and mortality associated with COVID-19 in the nursing homes, as well as providing a brief description of the outbreaks. RESULTS: Forty residents were included, 26 of whom were women. The average age was 86.2 years. Thirty-seven of the residents had atypical symptoms, nine of them were asymptomatic at the time of diagnosis, and 21 died during the coronavirus infection. Contact tracing indicated that the outbreaks may have originated from staff in the pre-symptomatic or early and mild phase of the disease. SARS-CoV-2 was detected in forty-two staff members, and a further 115 were placed in quarantine. INTERPRETATION: Many residents had atypical disease presentation, and the mortality from COVID-19 was high. Spread of infection may have originated from staff, also before they displayed obvious symptoms, and contributed to extensive spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the three nursing homes.","Kittang, Bård Reiakvam; Hofacker, Sebastian von; Solheim, Sabine Piepenstock; Krüger, Kjell; Løland, Karina Koller; Jansen, Kristian",Tidsskr. nor. laegeforen.,,487

397709,Fatty acyl lipidomic changes converge towards increased inflammation with severity of covid-19,2021,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative agent for the COVID-19 pandemic, which generated more than 1.82 million deaths in 2020 alone, in addition to 83.8 million infections. Currently, there is no antiviral medication to treat COVID-19. In the search for drug leads, marine-derived metabolites are reported here as prospective SARS-CoV-2 inhibitors. Two hundred and twenty-seven terpene natural products isolated from the biodiverse Red-Sea ecosystem were screened for inhibitor activity against the SARS-CoV-2 main protease (M&lt;sup&gt;pro&lt;/sup&gt;) using molecular docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations combined with molecular mechanics/generalized Born surface area binding energy calculations. On the basis of in silico analyses, six terpenes demonstrated high potency as M&lt;sup&gt;pro&lt;/sup&gt; inhibitors with DELTAG&lt;sub&gt;binding&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;= -40.0 kcal/mol. The stability and binding affinity of the most potent metabolite, erylosides B, were compared to the human immunodeficiency virus protease inhibitor, lopinavir. Erylosides B showed greater binding affinity towards SARS-CoV-2 M&lt;sup&gt;pro&lt;/sup&gt; than lopinavir over 100 ns with DELTAG&lt;sub&gt;binding&lt;/sub&gt; values of -51.9 vs. -33.6 kcal/mol, respectively. Protein-protein interactions indicate that erylosides B biochemical signaling shares gene components that mediate severe acute respiratory syndrome diseases, including the cytokine- and immune-signaling components BCL2L1, IL2, and PRKC. Pathway enrichment analysis and Boolean network modeling were performed towards a deep dissection and mining of the erylosides B target-function interactions. The current study identifies erylosides B as a promising anti-COVID-19 drug lead that warrants further in vitro and in vivo testing.","Ibrahim, M. A. A.; Abdelrahman, A. H. M.; Mohamed, T.

399603,Methanol toxicity: An unintended consequence of the covid-19 pandemic,2021,"BACKGROUND: During the initial phases of the COVID-19 pandemic, there was an unfounded fervor surrounding the use of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and tocilizumab (TCZ); however, evidence on their efficacy and safety have been controversial. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to evaluate the overall clinical effectiveness of HCQ and TCZ in patients with COVID-19. We hypothesize that HCQ and TCZ use in these patients will be associated with a reduction in in-hospital mortality, upgrade to intensive medical care, invasive mechanical ventilation, or acute renal failure needing dialysis. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was performed to determine the impact of HCQ and TCZ use on hard clinical outcomes during hospitalization. A total of 176 hospitalized patients with a confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis was included. Patients were divided into two comparison groups: (1) HCQ (n=144) vs no-HCQ (n=32) and (2) TCZ (n=32) vs no-TCZ (n=144). The mean age, baseline comorbidities, and other medications used during hospitalization were uniformly distributed among all the groups. Independent t tests and multivariate logistic regression analysis were performed to calculate mean differences and adjusted odds ratios with 95% CIs, respectively. RESULTS: The unadjusted odds ratio for patients upgraded to a higher level of care (ie, intensive care unit) (OR 2.6, 95% CI 1.19-5.69; P=.003) and reductions in C-reactive protein (CRP) level on day 7 of hospitalization (21% vs 56%, OR 0.21, 95% CI 0.08-0.55; P=.002) were significantly higher in the TCZ group compared to the control group. There was no significant difference in the odds of in-hospital mortality, upgrade to intensive medical care, need for invasive mechanical ventilation, acute kidney failure necessitating dialysis, or discharge from the hospital after recovery in both the HCQ and TCZ groups compared to their respective control groups. Adjusted odds ratios controlled for baseline comorbidities and medications closely followed the unadjusted estimates. CONCLUSIONS: In this cohort of patients with COVID-19, neither HCQ nor TCZ offered a significant reduction in in-hospital mortality, upgrade to intensive medical care, invasive mechanical ventilation, or acute renal failure needing dialysis. These results are similar to the recently published preliminary results of the HCQ arm of the Recovery trial, which showed no clinical benefit from the use of HCQ in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 (the TCZ arm is ongoing). Double-blinded randomized controlled trials are needed to further evaluate the impact of these drugs in larger patient samples so that data-driven guidelines can be deduced to combat this global pandemic.","Roomi, Sohaib; Ullah, Waqas; Ahmed, Faizan; Farooq, Soban; Sadiq, Usama; Chohan, Asad; Jafar, Munnam; Saddique, Maryum; Khanal, Shristi; Watson, Robert; Boigon, Margot",J Med Internet Res,,487

It takes into account two processes, namely, infection and recovery/decease characterised by two parameters in total: contact rate and recovery/decease rate. Its solution has a form of a quasi-logistic function for which we have introduced an infection index that, should it become negative, can also be considered as a recovery/decease index with decrease of infected down to zero. Based on the data from open sources for the SARS-Cov-2 pandemic, seasonal influenza epidemics and a pandemic in the fauna world, a threshold value of the infection index has been shown to exist above which an infection expansion pretends to be considered as pandemic. Lean (two-parameter) SIR models affined with the warning SIS model have been built.

406199,Covid-19 related stress and uncontrolled asthma among adults,2021,"Essential hypertension is the most common cardiovascular (CV) risk factor, being primarily involved in the pathogenesis of CV disease and mortality worldwide. Given the high prevalence and growing incidence of this clinical condition in the general population in both high and low-income countries, antihypertensive drug therapies are frequently prescribed in different hypertension-related CV diseases and comorbidities. Among these conditions, evidence are available demonstrating the clinical benefits of lowering blood pressure (BP) levels, particularly in those hypertensive patients at high or very high CV risk profile. Preliminary studies, performed during the Sars-COVID-19 epidemic, raised some concerns on the potential implication of hypertension and antihypertensive medications in the susceptibility of having severe pneumonia, particularly with regard to the use of drugs inhibiting the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), including angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs). These hypotheses were not confirmed by subsequent studies, which independently and systematically demonstrated no clinical harm of these drugs also in patients with Sars-COVID-19 infection. The aim of this narrative review is to critically discuss the available evidence supporting the use of antihypertensive therapies based RAS blocking agents in hypertensive patients with different CV risk profile and with additional clinical conditions or comorbidities, including Sars-COVID-19 infection, with a particular focus on single-pill combination therapies based on olmesartan medoxomil.","Presta, Vivianne; Figliuzzi, Ilaria; Citoni, Barbara; Gallo, Giovanna; Battistoni, Allegra; Tocci, Giuliano; Volpe, Massimo",High Blood Press Cardiovasc Prev,,487

416064,The tick and the ticker: A rare case of lyme perimyocarditis,2021,"Water scarcity, together with the projected impacts of water stress worldwide, has led to a rapid increase in research on measuring water security. However, water security has been conceptualized under different perspectives, including various aspects and dimensions. Since public health is also an integral part of water security, it is necessary to understand how health has been incorporated as a dimension in the existing water security frameworks. While supply-demand and governance narratives dominated several popular water security frameworks, studies that are specifically designed for public health purposes are generally lacking. This research aims to address this gap, firstly by assessing the multiple thematic dimensions of water security frameworks in scientific disclosure;and secondly by looking into the public health dimensions and evaluating their importance and integration in the existing water security frameworks. For this, a systematic review of the Scopus database was undertaken using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. A detailed review analysis of 77 relevant papers was performed. The result shows that 11 distinct dimensions have been used to design the existing water security framework. Although public health aspects were mentioned in 51% of the papers, direct health impacts were considered only by 18%, and indirect health impacts or mediators were considered by 33% of the papers. Among direct health impacts, diarrhea is the most prevalent one considered for developing a water security framework. Among different indirect or mediating factors, poor accessibility and availability of water resources in terms of time and distance is a big determinant for causing mental illnesses, such as stress or anxiety, which are being considered when framing water security framework, particularly in developing nations. Water quantity is more of a common issue for both developed and developing countries, water quality and mismanagement of water supply-related infrastructure is the main concern for developing nations, which proved to be the biggest hurdle for achieving water security. It is also necessary to consider how people treat and consume the water available to them. The result of this study sheds light on existing gaps for different water security frameworks and provides policy-relevant guidelines for its betterment. Also, it stressed that a more wide and holistic approach must be considered when framing a water security framework to result in sustainable water management and human well-being.","Paudel, S.; Kumar, P.; Dasgupta, R.; Johnson, B.

The aim of this study was to screen appropriate cutoffs for size of solitary hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related HCC. METHODS: A cohort of 1760 patients with solitary HBV-related HCC undergoing curative liver resection was divided into 11 groups based on tumor size in 1-cm interval. The minimum p value method was used to screen the appropriate size cutoff according to overall survival (OS). If multiple cutoffs meet the above standard, a univariate analysis will be performed by using the Cox proportional hazards regression model, and hazard ratio (HR) will be considered as a criterion to assess the difference in survival. RESULTS: There are 8 dichotomy, 8 trichotomy, and no inquartation cutoffs that were screened when classifying tumor sizes in accordance with OS. The HR values of tumor size at these trichotomy cutoffs for OS were compared, and the highest HR value is 2.79 when size cutoff is 3/9 cm. Then, we reclassified patients into three new classifications: &#8804; 3 cm (n = 422), > 3 and &#8804; 9 cm (n = 1072), and > 9 cm (n = 266). The comparison of clinicopathologic characteristics among these three classifications showed that the increase of tumor size was associated with the increase of &#945;-fetoprotein (AFP), microvascular invasion (MVI), tumor differentiation, and liver cirrhosis. And the comparison of the OS among three classifications showed statistical differences. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggested that size criteria of 3 cm and 9 cm in solitary HBV-related HCC patients were appropriate based on biological characteristics and prognostic significance.","Liu, Hongzhi; Yang, Yuan; Chen, Chuanchun; Wang, Lei; Huang, Qizhen; Zeng, Jianxing; Lin, Kongying; Zeng, Yongyi; Guo, Pengfei; Zhou, Weiping; Liu, Jingfeng",World J Surg Oncol,,487

So far, no vaccine candidate under development has reached the market and the only licensed product to prevent RSV infection in at-risk infants and young children is a monoclonal antibody (Synagis®). Polyclonal human anti-RSV hyper-immune immunoglobulins (Igs) have also been used but were superseded by Synagis® owing to their low titer and large infused volume. Here we report a new drug class of immunoglobulins, derived from human non hyper-immune plasma that was generated by an innovative bioprocess, called Ig cracking, combining expertises in plasma-derived products and affinity chromatography. By using the RSV fusion protein (F protein) as ligand, the Ig cracking process provided a purified and concentrated product, designated hyper-enriched anti-RSV IgG, composed of at least 15-20% target-specific-antibodies from normal plasma. These anti-RSV Ig displayed a strong in vitro neutralization effect on RSV replication. Moreover, we described a novel prophylactic strategy based on local nasal administration of this unique hyper-enriched anti-RSV IgG solution using a mouse model of infection with bioluminescent RSV. Our results demonstrated that very low doses of hyper-enriched anti-RSV IgG can be administered locally to ensure rapid and efficient inhibition of virus infection. Thus, the general hyper-enriched Ig concept appeared a promising approach and might provide solutions to prevent and treat other infectious diseases. Importance: Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) is the major cause of acute lower respiratory infections in children, and is also recognized as a cause of morbidity in the elderly. There are still no vaccines and no efficient antiviral therapy against this virus. Here, we described an approach of passive immunization with a new class of hyper-enriched anti-RSV immunoglobulins (Ig) manufactured from human normal plasma. This new class of immunoglobulin plasma derived product is generated by an innovative bioprocess, called Ig cracking, which requires a combination of expertise in both plasma derived products and affinity chromatography. The strong efficacy in a small volume of these hyper-enriched anti-RSV IgG to inhibit the viral infection was demonstrated using a mouse model. This new class of immunoglobulin plasma-derived products could be applied to other pathogens to address specific therapeutic needs in the field of infectious diseases or even pandemics, such as COVID-19.","Jacque, Emilie; Chottin, Claire; Laubreton, Daphné; Nogre, Michel; Ferret, Cécile; de Marcos, Sandrine; Baptista, Linda; Drajac, Carole; Mondon, Philippe; De Romeuf, Christophe; Rameix-Welti, Marie-Anne; Eléouët, Jean-François; Chtourou, Sami; Riffault, Sabine; Perret, Gérald; Descamps, Delphyne",Front Immunol,,487

456151,Critical care medicine in the French Territories in the Americas: Current situation and prospects,2021,"PURPOSE: Due to relevant repercussions on reproductive medicine, we aimed to evaluate feasibility of RT-PCR as a detection method of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in seminal fluid. METHODS: A qualitative determination of the RT-PCR assays in semen was performed through different approaches: (1) efficiency of RNA extraction from sperm and seminal plasma was determined using PRM1 and PRM2 mRNA and a heterologous system as control;(2) samples obtained by diluting viral preparation from a SARS-CoV-2 panel (virus cultured in Vero E6 cell lines) were tested;(3) viral presence in different fractions of seminal fluid (whole sample, seminal plasma and post-centrifugation pellet) was evaluated. Semen samples from mild and recovered COVID-19 subjects were collected by patients referring to the Infectious Disease Department of the Policlinico Umberto I Hospital - ""Sapienza"" University of Rome. Control subjects were recruited at the Laboratory of Seminology-Sperm Bank ""Loredana Gandini'' of the same hospital. RESULTS: The control panel using viral preparations diluted in saline and seminal fluid showed the capability to detect viral RNA presence with C&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; values depending on the initial viral concentration. All tested semen samples were negative for SARS-CoV-2, regardless of the nasopharyngeal swab result or seminal fluid fraction. CONCLUSION: These preliminary data show that RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 RNA testing appears to be a feasible method for the molecular diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 in seminal fluid, supported by results of the control panel.

458401,Determinants of ards resolution and duration in patients supported with extracorporeal support,2021,"BACKGROUND/AIMS: Maintaining emergency eye services is crucial during the COVID-19 pandemic. This article describes the introduction of a new restructured referral pathway to reduce the burden on healthcare providers and create a safe environment. METHODS: During January and February 2020 (group 1), all appointments were face-to-face with a walk-in eye casualty. The first audit cycle comprised all patients in group 1. The primary audit criteria were discharge rates, referral to subspeciality and reattendance. In April 2020, a remodelled system was implemented in which walk-in attendance ceased and was replaced with telephone triage coupled with digital imaging via NHS email for remote clinical review. Patients requiring further assessment following this triage were invited in for face-to-face appointments. A reaudit was conducted during April-July 2020 (group 2) following implementation of these COVID-19 protocol changes. RESULTS: In group 1, 2868 appointments (100.0%) were face-to-face and in group 2 4870 (100.0%) appointments were telephone consults that resulted in 2639 (54.2%) face-to-face appointments. The rate of discharge in the first cycle and second cycle were 55.3% and 76.9% respectively (P<0.0001). Furthermore 2298 (47.2%) patients were able to be discharged following telephone consultation in group 2. CONCLUSIONS: Using this telephone and digital imaging review triage system, the authors have demonstrated a significant reduction in the need for face-to-face reviews. The reduction in avoidable patient face-to-face reviews allows the system to move from saturated to sustainable while increasing accessibility to services for patients who may not be able to present for face-to-face review. This complete audit cycle successfully charts interventions that maximise accessibility, reduce unnecessary hospital visits and deliver safe and prompt management during the pandemic.","Moussa, George; Mushtaq, Fizza; Mandal, Priyanka; Mathews, Namita; Royal, Ben; Manjunatha, Nonavinakere; Lee, Rynn",Br J Hosp Med (Lond),,487
465639,Decreased Mortality Over Time During the First Wave in Patients With COVID-19 in Geriatric Care: Data From the Stockholm GeroCovid Study,2021,"Currently, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) represents the fourth cause of death worldwide with significant economic burden. Comorbidities increase in number and severity with age and are identified as important determinants that influence the prognosis. In this observational study, we retrospectively analyzed data collected from the RePoSI register. We aimed to investigate comorbidities and outcomes in a cohort of hospitalized elderly patients with the clinical diagnosis of COPD. Socio-demographic, clinical characteristics and laboratory findings were considered. The association between variables and in-hospital, 3-month and 1-year follow-up were analyzed. Among 4696 in-patients, 932 (19.8%) had a diagnosis of COPD. Patients with COPD had more hospitalization, a significant overt cognitive impairment, a clinically significant disability and more depression in comparison with non-COPD subjects. COPD patients took more drugs, both at admission, in-hospital stay, discharge and 3-month and 1-year follow-up. 14 comorbidities were more frequent in COPD patients. Cerebrovascular disease was an independent predictor of in-hospital mortality. At 3-month follow-up, male sex and hepatic cirrhosis were independently associated with mortality. ICS-LABA therapy was predictor of mortality at in-hospital, 3-month and 1-year follow-up. This analysis showed the severity of impact of COPD and its comorbidities in the real life of internal medicine and geriatric wards.","Argano, Christiano; Scichilone, Nicola; Natoli, Giuseppe; Nobili, Alessandro; Corazza, Gino Roberto; Mannucci, Pier Mannuccio; Perticone, Francesco; Corrao, Salvatore",Intern. emerg. med,,487

469479,COVID-19: The Great Masquerader,2021,"Steady hematopoiesis is essential for lifelong production of all mature blood cells. Hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) found in the bone marrow ensure hematopoietic homeostasis in an organism. Failure of this complex process, which involves a fine balance of self-renewal and differentiation fates, often result in severe hematological conditions such as leukemia and lymphoma. Several molecular and metabolic programs, internal or in close interaction with the bone marrow niche, have been identified as important regulators of HSPC function. More recently, nutrient sensing pathways have emerged as important modulators of HSC homing, dormancy, and function in the bone marrow. Here we describe a method for reliable measurement of various amino acids and minerals in different rare bone marrow (BM) populations, namely HSPCs. We found that the amino acid profile of the most primitive hematopoietic compartments (KLS) did not differ significantly from the one of their direct progenies (common myeloid progenitor CMP), while granulocyte-monocyte progenitors (GMPs), on the opposite of megakaryocyte-erythroid progenitors (MEPs), have higher content of the majority of amino acids analyzed. Additionally, we identified intermediates of the urea cycle to be differentially expressed in the KLS population and were found to lower mitochondrial membrane potential, an established readout on self-renewal capability. Moreover, we were able to profile for the first time 12 different minerals and detect differences in elemental contents between different HSPC compartments. Importantly, essential dietary trace elements, such as iron and molybdenum, were found to be enriched in granulocyte-monocyte progenitors (GMPs). We envision this amino acid and mineral profiling will allow identification of novel metabolic and nutrient sensing pathways important in HSPC fate regulation.","Girotra, Mukul; Monnard, Caroline; Konz, Tobias; Sizzano, Federico; Goulet, Laurence; Godin, Jean-Philippe; Coukos, George; Rezzi, Serge; Vannini, Nicola",,,487

470112,The impact of the colorado state-wide lockdown on non-COVID-19 related ICU admissions and mortality,2021,"Acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has spread rapidly in numerous countries and caused a massive number of deaths. Interferon-&#945; (IFN-&#945;), lopinavir/ritonavir, chloroquine phosphate, arbidol, ribavirin, remdesivir, and dexamethasone are the therapeutic drugs recommended for treating 2019-nCoV disease (COVID-19 disease). Due to the particularity of immune function, pregnant women seem to be more susceptible to the virus. We searched the literature to find effective and safe drugs for patients with COVID-19 during pregnancy and to provide drug therapy strategies for medical staff. According to the current literature we reviewed, we suggest that IFN-&#945; and arbidol can be retained in the treatment regimen for pregnant women and that to reduce maternal mortality, appropriate doses of dexamethasone can be given to those who are predicted to have low premature survival and to receive mechanical ventilation or oxygen. However, the use of dexamethasone in the 1st trimester and after 37 weeks of gestation should be avoided.","Wang, Han; Gao, Yu; Wu, Bo",Int. j. clin. pharmacol. ther,,487

METHODS: Publicly available data of PM2.5 concentrations from reference monitoring systems at sites across Scotland were extracted for the 31-day period immediately following the imposition of lockdown rules on 23 March 2020. Similar data for 2017, 2018 and 2019 were gathered for comparison. Mean period values were calculated from the hourly data and logged values compared using pairwise t-tests. Weather effects were corrected using meteorological normalisation. RESULTS: NO2 concentrations were significantly lower in the 2020 lockdown period than in the previous 3 years (p<0.001). Mean outdoor PM2.5 concentrations in 2020 were much lower than during the same period in 2019 (p<0.001). However, despite UK motor vehicle journeys reducing by 65%, concentrations in 2020 were within 1 µg/m3 of those measured in 2017 (p=0.66) and 2018 (p<0.001), suggesting that traffic-related emissions may not explain variability of PM2.5 in outdoor air in Scotland. CONCLUSIONS: The impact of reductions in motor vehicle journeys during COVID-19 lockdown restrictions may not have reduced ambient PM2.5 concentrations in some countries. There is also a need for work to better understand how movement restrictions may have impacted personal exposure to air pollutants generated within indoor environments.","Dobson, Ruaraidh; Semple, Sean",Occup Environ Med,,487
471018,Lung Lesions in 4 Pregnant Women with Severe COVID-19-Autopsy Case,2021,"A pneumonia outbreak caused by a novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has spread around the world. A total of 2,314,621 laboratory-confirmed cases, including 157,847 deaths (6.8%) were reported globally by 20 April 2020. Common symptoms of COVID-19 pneumonia include fever, fatigue, and dry cough. Faced with such a sudden outbreak of emerging infectious disease, traditional models for predicting the peak of the epidemic often show inconsistent results. With the aim to timely judge the epidemic peak and provide support for decisions for resuming production and returning to normal life based on publicly reported data, we used a seven-day moving average of log-transformed daily new cases (LMA) to establish a new index named the ""epidemic evaluation index"" (EEI). We used SARS epidemic data from Hong Kong to verify the practicability of the new index, and then applied it to the COVID-19 epidemic analysis. The results showed that the epidemic peaked, respectively, on 9 February and 5 February 2020, in Hubei Province and other provinces in China. The proposed index can be applied for judging the epidemic peak. While the global COVID-19 epidemic reached its peak in the middle of April, the epidemic peaks in some countries have not yet appeared.

In the context that ""a crisis is a terrible thing to waste,"" as disruptive as the pandemic has been to traditional practices-both clinically and educationally-opportunities have also presented. Clinical benefits have included the propulsion of clinical innovation, including such items as the development of novel vaccines and accelerated understanding of multiplex ventilation. Approaches to educating students and other learners have also changed radically, with the suspension of live teaching in most instances and a precipitous transition to virtual instruction. This perspective considers a SWOT analysis (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats) associated with the coronavirus pandemic in health care that focuses on the implications for education. Although the obvious disadvantages (weaknesses) regard the loss of face-to-face interaction with all of its consequences (eg, isolation, risks to camaraderie, loss of hands-on training opportunities, and loss of in-person celebratory events like graduations and end-of-training celebrations), there are clearly offsetting strengths. These include growing experience with virtual teaching and virtual learning strategies, the invitation to codify best virtual teaching practices, a tightening of alignment between undergraduate and graduate medical education (eg, around virtual interview strategies), and opportunities for both self-reflection and a commitment to act virtuously. On balance, the pandemic has created the opportunity, indeed the necessity, to innovate in practice and in education, making the landscape ripe for creative practice, new mastery, and the concomitant benefits to learners and to educators.","Stoller, James K",Chest,,487

A threshold of 80% agreement was used to establish consensus for each statement. 27 of 30 statements achieved consensus after two rounds of voting by 34 experts. The statements were categorised as pre-endoscopy, during endoscopy and postendoscopy addressing relevant areas of practice, such as screening, personal protective equipment, appropriate environments for endoscopy and infection control precautions, particularly in areas of high disease prevalence. Recommendations for testing of patients and for healthcare workers, appropriate locations of donning and doffing areas and social distancing measures before endoscopy are unique and not dealt with by any other guidelines. This international consensus using a modified Delphi method to produce a series of best practice recommendations to aid the safe resumption of endoscopy services globally in the era of COVID-19.","Bhandari, Pradeep; Subramaniam, Sharmila; Bourke, Michael J; Alkandari, Asma; Chiu, Philip Wai Yan; Brown, James F; Keswani, Rajesh N; Bisschops, Raf; Hassan, Cesare; Raju, Gottumukkala S; Muthusamy, V Raman; Sethi, Amrita; May, Gary R; Albéniz, Eduardo; Bruno, Marco; Kaminski, Michal Filip; Alkhatry, Maryam; Almadi, Majid; Ibrahim, Mostafa; Emura, Fabian; Moura, Eduardo; Navarrete, Claudio; Wulfson, Adolfo; Khor, Christopher; Ponnudurai, Ryan; Inoue, Haruhiro; Saito, Yutaka; Yahagi, Naohisa; Kashin, Sergey; Nikonov, Evgeniy; Yu, Honggang; Maydeo, Amit P; Reddy, D Nageshwar; Wallace, Michael B; Pochapin, Mark Bennett; Rösch, Thomas; Sharma, Prateek; Repici, Alessandro",Gut,,487

However, according to recently published studies, COVID-19 has a very high death rate among patients receiving ALV. In case of early (pre-life support) start of oxygen therapy and respiratory support in patients with COVID-19 the need for transfer to the intensive care unit, tracheal intubation and ALV decreases, and therefore the prognosis improves.

METHODS: This was a single-center, cross-sectional study. We evaluated the feasibility of a strategy based on the conversion of face-to-face visits to telephone consultations to manage IBD outpatients during the COVID-19 pandemic. A 4-item telephone survey (3 closed questions and a 100-point numeric description scale) was conducted to evaluate satisfaction of patients with telephone consultations. RESULTS: Between March 11 and April 8, 2020, 98% of the 216 scheduled face-to-face visits could be converted to telephone consultations, and we resolved an additional 162 urgent consultations by telephone. The rate of IBD-related hospitalization and visits to the emergency department decreased by 50% and 58%, respectively, compared with rates in the same period the previous year. The 4-item survey was conducted in 171 outpatients. In closed questions, patients reported a very high degree of satisfaction with telephone consultations, with no differences between scheduled (n = 123) and urgent consultations (n = 48; P = NS). The overall satisfaction rating with the telephone consultation evaluated with the numerical description scale was 94% and 93% for scheduled and urgent consultations, respectively (P < 0.82). Less than 20% of patients would have preferred a face-to-face visit to the telephone consultation at the time. CONCLUSIONS: A strategy based on the conversion of face-to-face visits to telephone consultations was able to guarantee a minimum standard quality of care during the COVID-19 pandemic. Patients reported a very high degree of satisfaction with telephone consultations.","Taxonera, Carlos; Alba, Cristina; Olivares, David; Martin, María; Ventero, Alejandro; Cañas, Mercedes",Inflamm. bowel dis,,487

Droplet-array sandwiching technology involves upper and lower substrates with a droplet-array designed for a one-step process. This technology is, however, limited to batch manipulation of the droplet-array. Here, we propose a method for selective control of individual droplets, which allows different conditions for individual droplet pairs. Electrowetting-on-dielectric (EWOD) technology is introduced to control the height of the droplets so that the contact between droplet-pairs can be individually controlled. Circular patterns 4 mm in diameter composed of electrodes for EWOD and hydrophilic-hydrophobic patterns for droplet formation 4 µl in volume were developed. We demonstrate the selective control of the droplet height by EWOD for an applied voltage up to 160 V and selective control of the contact and transport of substances. Presented results will provide useful method for advanced drug screening, including cell-based screening.","Konishi, Satoshi; Ohya, Chikara; Yamada, Tatsuhiro",Sci Rep,,487

Herein, we reveal that the Ig-like fold ectodomain of the viral protein SARS-CoV-2 ORF7a interacts with high efficiency to CD14+ monocytes in human peripheral blood, compared to pathogenic protein SARS-CoV ORF7a. The crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 ORF7a at 2.2 Å resolution reveals three remarkable changes on the amphipathic side of the four-stranded β-sheet, implying a potential functional interface of the viral protein. Importantly, SARS-CoV-2 ORF7a coincubation with CD14+ monocytes ex vivo triggered a decrease in HLA-DR/DP/DQ expression levels and upregulated significant production of proinflammatory cytokines, including IL-6, IL-1β, IL-8, and TNF-α. Our work demonstrates that SARS-CoV-2 ORF7a is an immunomodulating factor for immune cell binding and triggers dramatic inflammatory responses, providing promising therapeutic drug targets for pandemic COVID-19.","Zhou, Ziliang; Huang, Chunliu; Zhou, Zhechong; Huang, Zhaoxia; Su, Lili; Kang, Sisi; Chen, Xiaoxue; Chen, Qiuyue; He, Suhua; Rong, Xia; Xiao, Fei; Chen, Jun; Chen, Shoudeng",iScience,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2589004221001553?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2589004221001553; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33615195/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.isci.2021.102187,487

We first fit the constant transmission rate parameter to the epidemic data in Mayotte during an early exponential growth phase using an algorithm with a package of software R and based on a Likewook Maximum estimator. Thus, after the intervention and control measures imposed by the gouvernement, we introduce a simple temporally varying and exponentially decreasing transmission rate with a control parameter. This allows us to understand wheter these interventions are having the desired impact of controlling the epidemic by pointing out some percentages to maintain control which is critical in Mayotte given the fragility of its health infrastructure and the significant fraction of the population without access to water.","MANOU-ABI, Solym; BALICCHI, Julien",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.15.20062752,487

Effective public policy is data-informed policy. This requires a liaison between public health scientists and public officials. OBJECTIVE: This article details the experience, challenges, and lessons learned advising public officials in a large metropolitan area from March to October 2020. METHODS: To effectively do this, an R Markdown report was created to iteratively monitor the number of COVID-19 tests performed, positive tests obtained, COVID-19 hospitalization census, intensive care unit census, the number of patients with COVID-19 on ventilators, and the number of deaths due to COVID-19. RESULTS: These reports were presented and discussed at meetings with policy makers to further comprehension. DISCUSSION: To facilitate the fullest understanding by both the general public and policy makers alike, we advocate for greater centralization of public health surveillance data, objective operational definitions of metrics, and greater interagency communication to best guide and inform policy makers. Through consistent data reporting methods, parsimonious and consistent analytic methods, a clear line of communication with policy makers, transparency, and the ability to navigate unforeseen externalities such as “data dumps” and reporting delays, scientists can use information to best support policy makers in times of crises.","Williams, Roy; Bursac, Zoran; Trepka, Mary Jo; Odom, Gabriel J.",J Public Health Manag Pract,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33729189/; https://doi.org/10.1097/phh.0000000000001364,487

Research in other countries has shown that people with migrant origin are disproportionally affected. Belgium has an ethnically diverse and increasingly ageing population and is therefore particularly apt to study differential mortality by migrant group during this first wave of COVID-19. DATA AND METHODS: We used nationwide individually-linked data from the Belgian National Register providing sociodemographic indicators and mortality; and the administrative census of 2011 providing indicators of socioeconomic position. Age-standardized all-cause mortality rates (ASMRs) were calculated during the first COVID-19 wave (weeks 11–20 in 2020) and compared with ASMRs during weeks 11–20 in 2019 to calculate excess mortality by migrant origin, age and gender. For both years, relative inequalities were calculated by migrant group using Poisson regression, with and without adjustment for sociodemographic and socioeconomic indicators. RESULTS: Among the middle-aged, ASMRs revealed increased mortality in all origin groups, with significant excess mortality for Belgians and Sub-Saharan African men. At old age, excess mortality up to 60% was observed for all groups. In relative terms, most male elderly migrant groups showed higher mortality than natives, as opposed to 2019 and to women. Adding the control variables decreased this excess mortality. DISCUSSION: This study underlined important inequalities in overall and excess mortality in specific migrant communities, especially in men. Tailor-made policy measures and communication strategies should be set-up taking into account the particular risks to which groups are exposed.","Vanthomme, Katrien; Gadeyne, Sylvie; Lusyne, Patrick; Vandenheede, Hadewijch",SSM Popul Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33997246/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ssmph.2021.100797,487

In this study, 10 severe patients confirmed by real-time viral RNA test were enrolled prospectively. One dose of 200 mL of convalescent plasma (CP) derived from recently recovered donors with the neutralizing antibody titers above 1:640 was transfused to the patients as an addition to maximal supportive care and antiviral agents. The primary endpoint was the safety of CP transfusion. The second endpoints were the improvement of clinical symptoms and laboratory parameters within 3 d after CP transfusion. The median time from onset of illness to CP transfusion was 16.5 d. After CP transfusion, the level of neutralizing antibody increased rapidly up to 1:640 in five cases, while that of the other four cases maintained at a high level (1:640). The clinical symptoms were significantly improved along with increase of oxyhemoglobin saturation within 3 d. Several parameters tended to improve as compared to pretransfusion, including increased lymphocyte counts (0.65 × 10(9)/L vs. 0.76 × 10(9)/L) and decreased C-reactive protein (55.98 mg/L vs. 18.13 mg/L). Radiological examinations showed varying degrees of absorption of lung lesions within 7 d. The viral load was undetectable after transfusion in seven patients who had previous viremia. No severe adverse effects were observed. This study showed CP therapy was well tolerated and could potentially improve the clinical outcomes through neutralizing viremia in severe COVID-19 cases. The optimal dose and time point, as well as the clinical benefit of CP therapy, needs further investigation in larger well-controlled trials.","Duan, Kai; Liu, Bende; Li, Cesheng; Zhang, Huajun; Yu, Ting; Qu, Jieming; Zhou, Min; Chen, Li; Meng, Shengli; Hu, Yong; Peng, Cheng; Yuan, Mingchao; Huang, Jinyan; Wang, Zejun; Yu, Jianhong; Gao, Xiaoxiao; Wang, Dan; Yu, Xiaoqi; Li, Li; Zhang, Jiayou; Wu, Xiao; Li, Bei; Xu, Yanping; Chen, Wei; Peng, Yan; Hu, Yeqin; Lin, Lianzhen; Liu, Xuefei; Huang, Shihe; Zhou, Zhijun; Zhang, Lianghao; Wang, Yue; Zhang, Zhi; Deng, Kun; Xia, Zhiwu; Gong, Qin; Zhang, Wei; Zheng, Xiaobei; Liu, Ying; Yang, Huichuan; Zhou, Dongbo; Yu, Ding; Hou, Jifeng; Shi, Zhengli; Chen, Saijuan; Chen, Zhu; Zhang, Xinxin; Yang, Xiaoming",Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32253318/; https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2004168117,487

Indeed, many studies have quantified the epidemic growth rate using time-series of reported cases during the early phase of the outbreak to estimate the basic reproduction number, R(0). Using daily time series of COVID-19 incidence, we illustrate how epidemic curves of reported cases may not always reflect the true epidemic growth rate due to changes in testing rates, which could be influenced by limited diagnostic testing capacity during the early epidemic phase.","Omori, Ryosuke; Mizumoto, Kenji; Chowell, Gerardo",Int J Infect Dis,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2020.04.021; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971220302368?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1201971220302368; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32320809/,487

In some cases, intravenous (IV) insulin infusions are the optimal intervention and, to date, these have been compounded in hospital pharmacy departments or, alternatively, at the point of care, when timeliness is a concern or the pharmacy is closed. However, in-house compounding of high-risk medications such as IV insulin poses risks both for patients and institutions. The critical nature of certain high-risk therapies has led to the development of ready-to-administer products to improve the safety, timeliness, efficacy and efficiency of critical infusions.
