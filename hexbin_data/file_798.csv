37473,"Insolvenzrelevante Fußball-Verbandsregularien in Deutschland: Ökonomische Besonderheiten, Fehlanreize und Reformansätze",2020-08-04,"Background: The Makerere University/Uganda Virus Research Institute (UVRI) Centre of Excellence for Infection & Immunity Research and Training (MUII) is a collaborative programme supporting excellence in Infection and Immunity (I&I) research in Uganda. Set up in 2008, MUII aims to produce internationally competitive Ugandan and East African I&I research leaders, and develop human and infrastructural resources to support research and training excellence. We undertook an internal evaluation of MUII’s achievements, challenges and lessons learned between August 2008 and December 2019, to inform programmes seeking to build Africa’s health research expertise. Methods: Quantitative data were abstracted from programme annual reports. Qualitative data were obtained in March and April 2019: a cross-sectional evaluation was undertaken among a purposefully selected representative sample of 27 trainees and two programme staff. Qualitative data was analysed according to pre-determined themes of achievements, challenges, lessons learned and recommendations for improvement. Results: By December 2019, MUII had supported 68 fellowships at master’s-level and above (50% female: 23 Masters, 27 PhD, 15 post-doctoral, three group-leader fellows) and over 1,000 internships. Fellows reported career advancement, mentorship by experts, and improved research skills and outputs. Fellows have published over 300 papers, secured grants worth over £20m, established over 40 international collaborations, and taken on research and academic leadership positions in the country. Key lessons for success include the following: efficient administration provides an enabling environment; institutions need supportive policies for procurement, including provisions for purchases of specific biological research reagents from international manufacturers; strong international, multi-disciplinary collaboration provides a critical mass of expertise to mentor researchers in development; and mentorship catalyses young scientists to progress from graduate trainees to productive academic researchers, relevant to society’s most pressing health challenges. Conclusions: Sustainable academic productivity can be achieved through efficient operational support, global collaboration and mentorship to provide solutions to Africa’s health challenges.","Nakanjako, Damalie; Zalwango, Flavia; Wairagala, Pamela; Luboga, Fiona; Andia Biraro, Irene; Bukirwa, Victoria Diana; Mboowa, Mary Gorrethy; Cose, Steve; Seeley, Janet; Elliott, Alison",AAS Open Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7372530/,798

56773,BISp Informationen,2021-08-13,"Venomous snakebite is a neglected tropical disease that annually leads to hundreds of thousands of deaths or long-term physical and mental ailments across the developing world. Insufficient data on spatial variation in snakebite risk, incidence, human vulnerability, and accessibility of medical treatment contribute substantially to ineffective on-ground management. There is an urgent need to collect data, fill knowledge gaps and address on-ground management problems. The use of novel, and transdisciplinary approaches that take advantage of recent advances in spatio-temporal models, ‘big data’, high performance computing, and fine-scale spatial information can add value to snakebite management by strategically improving our understanding and mitigation capacity of snakebite. We review the background and recent advances on the topic of snakebite related geospatial analyses and suggest avenues for priority research that will have practical on-ground applications for snakebite management and mitigation. These include streamlined, targeted data collection on snake distributions, snakebites, envenomings, venom composition, health infrastructure, and antivenom accessibility along with fine-scale models of spatio-temporal variation in snakebite risk and incidence, intraspecific venom variation, and environmental change modifying human exposure. These measures could improve and ‘future-proof’ antivenom production methods, antivenom distribution and stockpiling systems, and human-wildlife conflict management practices, while simultaneously feeding into research on venom evolution, snake taxonomy, ecology, biogeography, and conservation.","Pintor, Anna F.V.; Ray, Nicolas; Longbottom, Joshua; Bravo-Vega, Carlos A.; Yousefi, Masoud; Murray, Kris A.; Ediriweera, Dileepa S.; Diggle, Peter J.",Toxicon X,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8350508/,798
66250,A monthly roundup of key articles in other journals.,2019,"BACKGROUND First year medical students value doctor and patient contact. However, it can be challenging to achieve positive exposure to primary care on a large scale. The COVID-19 pandemic has placed even greater pressure on placing students in General Practice (GP). AIM To assess the feasibility and acceptability of showing Year 1 medical students authentic recorded consultations between GPs and patients, and then explore what they gained from this. METHOD Using Panopto® Video Platform, we pre-recorded real Primary Care consultations, with patient and GP consent, which were then processed securely using the University of Aberdeen server. These were shown to all Year 1 medical students who immediately debriefed these consultations in small groups with a GP tutor. Subsequently two focus groups were held with 11 students to evaluate what they had learnt. LEARNING OUTCOMES The consultations were easy to record and play during the teaching session, although there were some issues with sound quality. All students in the focus groups enjoyed the experience. They gained new knowledge about the skills of GPs, and recognised GPs as positive role models. Students were able to identify a variety of communication and consultation skills used by the GP, which reinforced their teaching on these delivered elsewhere in the course. CONCLUSION Using pre-recorded consultations as a teaching tool is reproducible, time-efficient and beneficial to students. We propose that this model of using authentic 'live' interactions between GPs and patients represents a valuable undergraduate educational opportunity and could be utilised by medical schools internationally.","Dow, Naomi; Wass, Val; Macleod, David; Muirhead, Laura; McKeown, John","Education for primary care : an official publication of the Association of Course Organisers, National Association of GP Tutors, World Organisation of Family Doctors",https://doi.org/10.1080/14739879.2020.1812440; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32842902/,798

83849,A monthly roundup of key articles in other journals.,2020-09-18,"BACKGROUND Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) occurs at a higher frequency among military personnel than among civilians. A common symptom of mTBIs is cognitive dysfunction. Health care professionals use neuropsychological assessments as part of a multidisciplinary and best practice approach for mTBI management. Such assessments support clinical diagnosis, symptom management, rehabilitation, and return-to-duty planning. Military health care organizations currently use computerized neurocognitive assessment tools (NCATs). NCATs and more traditional neuropsychological assessments present unique challenges in both clinical and military settings. Many research gaps remain regarding psychometric properties, usability, acceptance, feasibility, effectiveness, sensitivity, and utility of both types of assessments in military environments. OBJECTIVE The aims of this study were to explore evidence regarding the use of NCATs among military personnel who have sustained mTBIs; evaluate the psychometric properties of the most commonly tested NCATs for this population; and synthesize the data to explore the range and extent of NCATs among this population, clinical recommendations for use, and knowledge gaps requiring future research. METHODS Studies were identified using MEDLINE, Embase, American Psychological Association PsycINFO, CINAHL Plus with Full Text, Psych Article, Scopus, and Military & Government Collection. Data were analyzed using descriptive analysis, thematic analysis, and the Randolph Criteria. Narrative synthesis and the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses extension for Scoping Reviews) guided the reporting of findings. The psychometric properties of NCATs were evaluated with specific criteria and summarized. RESULTS Of the 104 papers, 33 met the inclusion criteria for this scoping review. Thematic analysis and NCAT psychometrics were reported and summarized. CONCLUSIONS When considering the psychometric properties of the most commonly used NCATs in military populations, these assessments have yet to demonstrate adequate validity, reliability, sensitivity, and clinical utility among military personnel with mTBIs. Additional research is needed to further validate NCATs within military populations, especially for those living outside of the United States and individuals experiencing other conditions known to adversely affect cognitive processing. Knowledge gaps remain, warranting further study of psychometric properties and the utility of baseline and normative testing for NCATs.","Jones, Chelsea; Harasym, Jessica; Miguel-Cruz, Antonio; Chisholm, Shannon; Smith-MacDonald, Lorraine; Brémault-Phillips, Suzette",JMIR mental health,https://doi.org/10.2196/26360; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33616538/,798

658188,Digital Biosurveillance for Zoonotic Disease Detection in Kenya,2021-06-22,"OBJECTIVE To identify risk factors associated with an inaccurate diagnosis, delayed referral, and/or inappropriate ultrasound in consecutive referrals for an undescended testicle. METHODS This study was approved by the institutional IRB. Data was prospectively collected for all children referred to University of Oklahoma's pediatric urology service from August 2019 to February 2020. The data was imported into SAS vs 9.4 for analysis. We categorized the ""quality"" of referral by a point system using 3 factors (no previous ultrasound, ≤ 18 months, correct location). An optimal referral had an accurate testicular exam, was referred by 18 months of age, and no diagnostic ultrasound. RESULTS We collected 75 referrals. 39 (52.0 %) had confirmed UDT, requiring surgery. 27 (69.2 %) had an accurate initial exam. 41 (54.7 %) were outside the optimal age. 34 were considered low quality (0-1 qualities,) and 41 were high quality (2-3 qualities). Seven (9.3 %) were optimal (3/3 qualities). Referrals that needed intervention were statistically more likely to be higher quality. CONCLUSION Increased quality of UDT referrals directly correlated with the likelihood for treatment. This study reveals a need for more education on UDT referral in the community. By improving referring provider knowledge and skills, we can minimize unnecessary referrals.","Moran, Robert; Meenakshi-Sundaram, Bhalaajee; Frimberger, Dominic; Anderson, Michael; Rensing, Adam",Urology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34418407/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.urology.2021.08.003,798
