The potential inverse relation of HDL to coronary artery disease (CAD) and the effects of HDL on myriad other inflammatory conditions warrant a better understanding of the genetic basis of the HDL proteome. We conducted a comprehensive genetic analysis of the regulation of the proteome of HDL isolated from a panel of 100 diverse inbred strains of mice (the hybrid mouse diversity panel) and examined protein composition and efflux capacity to identify novel factors that affect the HDL proteome. Genetic analysis revealed widely varied HDL protein levels across the strains. Some of this variation was explained by local cis-acting regulation, termed cis-protein quantitative trait loci (QTLs). Variations in apoA-II and apoC-3 affected the abundance of multiple HDL proteins, indicating a coordinated regulation. We identified modules of covarying proteins and defined a protein-protein interaction network that describes the protein composition of the naturally occurring subspecies of HDL in mice. Sterol efflux capacity varied up to 3-fold across the strains, and HDL proteins displayed distinct correlation patterns with macrophage and ABCA1-specific cholesterol efflux capacity and cholesterol exchange, suggesting that subspecies of HDL participate in discrete functions. The baseline and stimulated sterol efflux capacity phenotypes were associated with distinct QTLs with smaller effect size, suggesting a multigenetic regulation. Our results highlight the complexity of HDL particles by revealing the high degree of heterogeneity and intercorrelation, some of which is associated with functional variation, and support the concept that HDL-cholesterol alone is not an accurate measure of HDL’s properties, such as protection against CAD.","Pamir, Nathalie; Pan, Calvin; Plubell, Deanna L.; Hutchins, Patrick M.; Tang, Chongren; Wimberger, Jake; Irwin, Angela; Vallim, Thomas Q. de Aguiar; Heinecke, Jay W.; Lusis, Aldons J.",J Lipid Res,420,12

Here, we investigated the effects of arctigenin on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced acute lung injury. Mice were divided into four groups: control, LPS, LPS + DMSO, and LPS + Arctigenin. Mice in the LPS + Arctigenin group were injected intraperitoneally with 50 mg/kg of arctigenin 1 h before an intratracheal administration of LPS (5 mg/kg). Lung tissues and bronchoalveolar lavage fluids (BALFs) were collected. Histological changes of the lung were analyzed by hematoxylin and eosin staining. Arctigenin decreased LPS-induced acute lung inflammation, infiltration of inflammatory cells into BALF, and production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Moreover, arctigenin pretreatment reduced the malondialdehyde level and increased superoxide dismutase and catalase activities and glutathione peroxidase/glutathione disulfide ratio in the lung. Mechanically, arctigenin significantly reduced the production of nitric oxygen and inducible nitric oxygen synthase (iNOS) expression, enhanced the expression of heme oxygenase-1, and decreased the phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs). Arctigenin has anti-inflammatory and antioxidative effects on LPS-induced acute lung injury, which are associated with modulation of MAPK, HO-1, and iNOS signaling.","Zhang, Wen-zhou; Jiang, Zheng-kui; He, Bao-xia; Liu, Xian-ben",Inflammation,420,31

We focus on two web sites: http://www.barficulture.com and http://www.britishbornchinese.org.uk, drawing on interviews with site editors, content analysis of the discussion forums, and E‐mail exchanges with site users. Our analysis of these two web sites shows how collective identities still matter, being redefined rather than erased by online interaction. We understand the site content through the notion of reflexive racialisation. We use this term to modify the stress given to individualisation in accounts of reflexive modernisation. In addition we question the allocation of racialised meaning from above implied by the concept of racialisation. Internet discussion forums can act as witnesses to social inequalities and through sharing experiences of racism and marginalisation, an oppositional social perspective may develop. The online exchanges have had offline consequences: social gatherings, charitable donations and campaigns against adverse media representations. These web sites have begun to change the terms of engagement between these ethnic groups and the wider society, and they have considerable potential to develop new forms of social action.","Parker, David; Song, Miri",Sociol Rev,420,16

We conducted a retrospective observational study in three ICUs in Bretagne, France. All patients admitted from January 2016 to September 2017 with a length of stay of 2 days or more were included. Universal screening for ESBL-GNB colonization was performed in all participating ICUs. Of the 3250 included patients, 131 (4.0%) were colonized at admission, 59 acquired colonization while hospitalized (1.9%; 95% CI [1.5–2.5%]), and 15 (0.5%; 95% CI [0.3–0.8%]) acquired ESBL-GNB infections. In the case of infection, the specificity and the negative predictive values of preexistent colonization for the ESBL-GNB etiology were 93.2% [91.5–95.1%] and 95.2% [93.5–97.1%], respectively. Colonization was the main risk factor for ESBL-GNB AI (OR = 9.61; 95% CI [2.86–32.29]; p < 0.001). Antimicrobial susceptibility of non-ESBL-GNB isolates responsible for AI was similar for any non-carbapenem β-lactam (95%) and imipenem (94%). ESBL-GNB AIs were rare in ICUs with low ESBL-GNB prevalence rate. Prior colonization was the main risk factor for subsequent infection. Empirical carbapenem therapy could be avoided in non ESBL-GNB colonized patients with suspected AI.

Considerable research has suggested that the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) plays a key role in nicotine dependence, with its functional connections between other brain regions altered as a function of trait addiction and state withdrawal. The flow of information between dACC and fronto-striatal regions is secured through different pathways, the vast majority of which are glutamatergic. As such, we investigated dACC activity using resting state functional connectivity (rsFC) with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and glutamate (Glu) concentration with magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). We also investigated the changes in adenosine levels in plasma during withdrawal as a surrogate for brain adenosine, which plays a role in fine-tuning synaptic glutamate transmission. Using a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized crossover design, nontreatment seeking smoking participants (N = 30) completed two imaging sessions, one while nicotine sated and another after 36 h nicotine abstinence. We observed reduced dACC Glu (P = 0.029) along with a significant reduction in plasma adenosine (P = 0.03) and adenosine monophosphate (AMP; P < 0.0001) concentrations during nicotine withdrawal in comparison with nicotine sated state. This withdrawal state manipulation also led to an increase in rsFC strength (P < 0.05) between dACC and several frontal cortical regions, including left superior frontal gyrus (LSFG), and right middle frontal gyrus (RMFG). Moreover, the state-trait changes in dACC Glu and rsFC strength between the dACC and both SFG and MFG were positively correlated (P = 0.012, and P = 0.007, respectively). Finally, the change in circuit strength between dACC and LSFG was negatively correlated with the change in withdrawal symptom manifestations as measured by the Wisconsin Smoking Withdrawal Scale (P = 0.04) and Tobacco Craving Questionnaire (P = 0.014). These multimodal imaging-behavioral findings reveal the complex cascade of changes induced by acute nicotine deprivation and call for further investigation into the potential utility of adenosine- and glutamate-signaling as novel therapeutic targets to treat the NWS.","Abulseoud, Osama A.; Ross, Thomas J.; Nam, Hyung Wook; Caparelli, Elisabeth C.; Tennekoon, Michael; Schleyer, Brooke; Castillo, Juan; Fedota, John; Gu, Hong; Yang, Yihong; Stein, Elliot",Neuropsychopharmacology,420,1

The respiratory muscles undertake the work of breathing and consist mainly of the diaphragm, which in the newborn is prone to dysfunction due to lower muscle mass, flattened shape and decreased content of fatigue-resistant muscle fibres. Premature infants are prone to diaphragmatic dysfunction due to limited reserves and limited capacity to generate force and avoid fatigue. Methods to assess the respiratory muscles in the newborn include electromyography, maximal respiratory pressures, assessment for thoraco-abdominal asynchrony and composite indices, such as the pressure–time product and the tension time index. Recently, there has been significant interest and a growing body of research in assessing respiratory muscle function using bedside ultrasonography. Neurally adjusted ventilator assist is a novel ventilation mode, where the level of the respiratory support is determined by the diaphragmatic electrical activity. Prolonged mechanical ventilation, hypercapnia and hypoxia, congenital anomalies and systemic or respiratory infection can negatively impact respiratory muscle function in the newborn, while caffeine and synchronised or volume-targeted ventilation have a positive effect on respiratory muscle function compared to conventional, non-triggered or pressure-limited ventilation, respectively. IMPACT: Respiratory muscle function is impaired in prematurely born neonates and infants with congenital anomalies, such as congenital diaphragmatic hernia. Respiratory muscle function is negatively affected by prolonged ventilation and infection and positively affected by caffeine and synchronised compared to non-synchronised ventilation modes. Point-of-care diaphragmatic ultrasound and neurally adjusted ventilator assist are recent diagnostic and therapeutic technological developments with significant clinical applicability.","Dassios, Theodore; Vervenioti, Aggeliki; Dimitriou, Gabriel",Pediatr Res,420,31

OBJECTIVES: This study examined the relationship between social support and quality of life by the level of PTG in colorectal cancer patients with ostomies. METHODS: Using a cross-sectional design, colorectal cancer patients with ostomies (n = 140) were recruited using convenience sampling. The City of Hope Quality of Life–Ostomy, the Multidimensional Scale of Social Support, and the Posttraumatic Growth Inventory measured quality of life, social support, and PTG, respectively. RESULTS: Social support and PTG were positively related to psychological and social well-being. Higher social support was associated with better psychological and social well-being. Posttraumatic growth moderated the relationship between psychological and social well-being. At a low and moderate level of PTG, social support was more strongly associated with psychological and social well-being, whereas at high levels, this association was not significant. CONCLUSIONS: Findings highlight the significance of social support to improve the quality of life for colorectal cancer patients with an ostomy, particularly those with low levels of PTG. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Screening for patients’ positive cognitive adaptations while living with an ostomy could identify those who might need further social support to improve their quality of life. Further, intensive social support programs might promote the quality of life for colorectal patients with an ostomy, which was found to be effective for those with low levels of PTG.","Kim, Hyerang; Son, Heesook",Cancer Nurs,420,16

Here we report a multi-generational family with seven members manifesting varying features of LADD syndrome, with one individual dying in early infancy of PAH. Whole genome sequencing in one family member identified a 12,158 bp deletion on chromosome 5p12 that removes two of the three exons of FGF10. Allele-specific PCR demonstrated that all affected family members, including the individual with PAH, carried the 12 kb deletion. We conclude the deletion is pathogenic and expands the mutational spectrum of FGF10 variants in LADD syndrome. The common mechanism underlying the variable clinical features of LADD syndrome is defective terminal branching of salivary and lacrimal glands and pulmonary acini, regulated by the TBX4-FGF10-FGFR2 pathway. The variable phenotypic expressivity of FGF10 haploinsufficiency from relatively benign to lethal is likely due to variation at other genetic loci.","Wade, Emma M.; Parthasarathy, Padmini; Mi, Jingyi; Morgan, Tim; Wollnik, Bernd; Robertson, Stephen P.; Cundy, Tim",Eur J Hum Genet,420,1

The goal of protein structure prediction approaches is to utilize computational modeling to determine the spatial location of every atom in a protein molecule starting from only its amino acid sequence. Depending on whether homologous structures can be found in the Protein Data Bank (PDB), structure prediction methods have been historically categorized as template-based modeling (TBM) or template-free modeling (FM) approaches. Until recently, TBM has been the most reliable approach to predicting protein structures, and in the absence of reliable templates, the modeling accuracy sharply declines. Nevertheless, the results of the most recent community-wide assessment of protein structure prediction experiment (CASP14) have demonstrated that the protein structure prediction problem can be largely solved through the use of end-to-end deep machine learning techniques, where correct folds could be built for nearly all single-domain proteins without using the PDB templates. Critically, the model quality exhibited little correlation with the quality of available template structures, as well as the number of sequence homologs detected for a given target protein. Thus, the implementation of deep-learning techniques has essentially broken through the 50-year-old modeling border between TBM and FM approaches and has made the success of high-resolution structure prediction significantly less dependent on template availability in the PDB library.","Pearce, Robin; Zhang, Yang",J Biol Chem,420,1

The aim of this review is to update the recent developments in the field of HSP in chronic kidney disease (CKD), in regard to three different aspects. The first is the assessment of the role of HSP, either positive or deleterious, in the pathogenesis of CKD and the possibilities to influence its progression. The second is the impact of dialysis, being a potentially modifiable stressor, on HSP and the attempt to assess the value of these proteins as the biocompatibility markers.

The incidence ranges from 3.5 to 5.6 depending on body area. Burns that cover a larger percentage of the total body surface area (TBSA), require skin graft surgeries, or necessitate pulmonary intensive care are well-researched risk factors for HO. Since burns initiate such complex pathophysiological processes with a variety of molecular signal changes, it is essential to focus on HO in the specific context of burn injury to define best practices for its treatment. There are numerous key players in the pathways of burn-induced HO, including neutrophils, monocytes, transforming growth factor-β1-expressing macrophages and the adaptive immune system. The increased inflammation associated with burn injuries is also associated with pathway activation. Neurological and calcium-related contributions are also known. Endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and vascularization are known to play key roles in burn-induced HO, with hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) as potential initiators. Currently, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and radiotherapy are effective prophylaxes for HO. Limited joint motion, ankylosis and intolerable pain caused by burn-induced HO can be effectively tackled via surgery. Effective biomarkers for monitoring burn-induced HO occurrence and bio-prophylactic and bio-therapeutic strategies should be actively developed in the future.","Hu, Xianglin; Sun, Zhengwang; Li, Fengfeng; Jiang, Chaoyin; Yan, Wangjun; Sun, Yangbai",Cell Mol Biol Lett,420,1

Outcome is bookended by restored functionality or permanent cognitively and physically debilitated states. Given the stakes, prognostication cannot be easily questioned as a judgment call, and a scientific underpinning is elemental. Conventional wisdom in determining coma-outcome trajectories posits that (1) predictive models are better than personal experiences, (2) self-fulfilling prophesy is unchecked and driven by nihilism, with little regard for prior probability outcomes, and (3) recovery is impacted by patients’ prior wishes and preexisting medical conditions—but also by what families are told about the patient’s state and anticipated clinical course. Moreover, a predicted good outcome can be offset by a major subsequent complication, or a predicted poor outcome can be offset by aggressive care. This article examines some of these concepts, including how we decide on aggressiveness of care, how we judge quality of life, and the impact on outcome. Most patients who awaken quickly do well and can resume their pretrauma injury lives. In worse off, slow-to-awaken patients, outcomes are a mixed bag of limited innate resilience, depleted cognitive and physical reserves, and adjusted quality of life. Bias and noise are factors not easily measured in outcome prediction, but their influence on recovery trajectories raises some troubling issues.","Wijdicks, Eelco F.

This study aimed to study the metabolic risk factors and the association with blood pressure alteration. Materials and Methods: This was a cross-sectional study conducted between 2017 and 2018 among 284 male university students in Eastern province, Saudi Arabia. The obesity and cardiovascular measurements were taken using standardized instruments, including blood pressure (BP), mean arterial pressure, body mass index (BMI), body adiposity index (BAI), waist circumference (WC), waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), waist-to-height ratio (WHtR), body fat percentage (BFP), and basal metabolic rate (BMR). Statistical Analysis: Blood pressure was classified according to the United States of America, Sixth Joint National committee (JNC-VI) guidelines. The mean and standard error were calculated for each hypertension group variable. Logistic regression was applied to predict associations. Results: The prevalence of hypertension in the present study was 61.6%., and that of overweight and obesity was 16.5% and 34.9%, respectively. The cut-off values of BMI and WC were 22.23 and 75.24, respectively. Conclusions: The results demonstrated that BMI, WC, WHR, and WHtR significantly predict hypertension and that WC has a greater discrimination capacity than other measures. The findings also emphasize the importance of cardiovascular risk screening for young adults to detect any alterations in blood pressure and thus identify the population that is vulnerable to CVDs at an early stage. The findings highlight the need for health and university policymakers to adopt measures to monitor and control hypertension and obesity at the university level.","EL-Ashker, Said; Pednekar, Mangesh S.; Narake, Sameer S.; Albaker, Waleed; Al-Hariri, Mohammed",Medicina (Kaunas),420,5

Its core idea is to model the compatibility among fashion items by jointly projecting embedding into a unified space. However, modeling the item compatibility in such a category-agnostic manner could barely preserve intra-class variance, thus resulting in sub-optimal performance. In this paper, we propose a novel category-aware metric learning framework, which not only learns the cross-category compatibility notions but also preserves the intra-category diversity among items. Specifically, we define a category complementary relation representing a pair of category labels, e.g., tops-bottoms. Given a pair of item embeddings, we first project them to their corresponding relation space, then model the mutual relation of a pair of categories as a relation transition vector to capture compatibility amongst fashion items. We further derive a negative sampling strategy with non-trivial instances to enable the generation of expressive and discriminative item representations. Comprehensive experimental results conducted on two public datasets demonstrate the superiority and feasibility of our proposed approach.","Li, Yang; Luo, Yadan; Huang, Zi",Advances in Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,420,24

While popular, existing methods using Graph Neural Networks (GNN) for semi-supervised relational learning have mainly focused on learning node representations by aggregating nearby attributes, and it is still challenging to leverage inferences about unlabeled nodes with few attributes—particularly when trying to exploit higher-order relationships in the network efficiently. To address this, we propose a Graph Neural Network architecture that incorporates patterns among the available class labels and uses (1) a Role Equivalence attention mechanism and (2) a mini-batch importance sampling method to improve efficiency when learning over high-order paths. In particular, our Role Equivalence attention mechanism is able to use nodes’ roles to learn how to focus on relevant distant neighbors, in order to adaptively reduce the increased noise that occurs when higher-order structures are considered. In experiments on six different real-world datasets, we show that our model (REGNN) achieves significant performance gains compared to other recent state-of-the-art baselines, particularly when higher-order paths are considered in the models.","Park, Hogun; Neville, Jennifer",Advances in Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,420,21

We design a survey in which participants (n = 897) choose whether to take a costless COVID-19 test. We find that 70% would take a test. Surprisingly, the people most likely to widely spread COVID-19 – the extraverts, others who meet more people in their daily lives and younger people – are the most willing to take a test. People's ability to financially or emotionally sustain self-isolation does not matter to their decision. We conclude that people are selfless in their decision to test for COVID-19. Our results are encouraging – they imply that COVOD-19 testing may succeed in targeting those who generate the largest social benefits from self-isolation if infected, which strengthens the case for widespread testing.","THUNSTRÖM, LINDA; ASHWORTH, MADISON; SHOGREN, JASON F.; NEWBOLD, STEPHEN; FINNOFF, DAVID",,420,16

First, a brief background to Dolly Parton’s life is presented, and the overlap between her career-life story and the theory of career construction counseling is outlined. A truncated biography of Dolly Parton follows, after which the focus shifts to an elaboration of how she developed herself as a career project ( Cochran, 1992). The outcomes of a “virtual” self- and career construction counseling-based interview conducted with her (based on information gathered from numerous publications and interviews) are used to uncover her key life themes. This interview is subsequently analyzed, and mission and vision statements are proposed for her. Next, the chapter discusses how Dolly Parton enacted her mission and vision and influenced the lives of countless other people positively (and continues to do so). More particularly, she provided and continues to provide a holding environment for millions of people. I explain how self- and career construction principles are realized in Dolly Parton’s career-life story before the chapter is concluded.","Maree, Jacobus Gideon (Kobus)",Innovating Counseling for Self- and Career Construction,420,1

However, like their real-numbered counterpart, quantized networks are not immune to malicious misclassification caused by adversarial attacks. We investigate how quantization affects a network’s robustness to adversarial attacks, which is a formal verification question. We show that neither robustness nor non-robustness are monotonic with changing the number of bits for the representation and, also, neither are preserved by quantization from a real-numbered network. For this reason, we introduce a verification method for quantized neural networks which, using SMT solving over bit-vectors, accounts for their exact, bit-precise semantics. We built a tool and analyzed the effect of quantization on a classifier for the MNIST dataset. We demonstrate that, compared to our method, existing methods for the analysis of real-numbered networks often derive false conclusions about their quantizations, both when determining robustness and when detecting attacks, and that existing methods for quantized networks often miss attacks. Furthermore, we applied our method beyond robustness, showing how the number of bits in quantization enlarges the gender bias of a predictor for students’ grades.","Giacobbe, Mirco; Henzinger, Thomas A.; Lechner, Mathias",Tools and Algorithms for the Construction and Analysis of Systems,420,16

In this work, we presented our experience in incidental detection of COVID-19-associated pneumonia in asymptomatic patients coming for routine oncologic (18)F-FDG PET/CT examinations during the COVID-19 pandemic, which contribute in the detection of the affected patients early to be isolated and properly managed. We reported the cases with incidental finding of COVID-19 pneumonia among 764 asymptomatic patients who were referred for whole-body (18)F-FDG PET/CT examinations for routine oncologic indications in the period between 15 March and 15 June 2020, and RT-PCR testing for them was requested for confirmation. RESULTS: Among the 764 scanned patients, we had recognized 87 patients (11.3%) having features of COVID-19 pneumonia. RT-PCR testing of them confirmed COVID-19 infection in 78 cases, yet 3 were negative and no RT-PCR testing was performed in 6 cases (only isolated and carefully monitored). CONCLUSION: (18)F-FDG PET/CT is sensitive for early COVID-19 detection, even in asymptomatic patients that guide proper management and also highlight the key role of a radiologist and the importance of applying safety measures in clinical services during the pandemic to minimize the spread of infection.","Ali, Susan Adil; Abdelkawi, Moustafa Mahmoud",Egypt J Radiol Nucl Med,420,16

Higher NH(3) concentrations and lower δ(15)N-NH(3(measured)) were observed at most sites in 2020 compared to 2017. Except for a site inside a tunnel, NH(3) concentrations did not increase significantly after the lockdown had ended compared to those during the lockdown, while δ(15)N-NH(3(measured)) increased by 2.1–9.9‰. Nonagricultural sources (fossil fuel and urban waste) overall contributed 81% and 62% of NH(3) at on-road (tunnel interior) and nonroad (CAU) sites in 2020, respectively, comparable to those in 2017 (without significant difference). The contribution of nonagricultural sources slightly increased after the lockdown compared to the contribution during the lockdown at the nonroad site and hardly changed at the tunnel interior site. Our results suggest that (1) unfavorable meteorological conditions, especially lower boundary layer heights and changes in regional transport patterns, might play a more important role than reduced anthropogenic emissions in the temporal variations of Beijing NH(3) and (2) the effect of reduced anthropogenic emissions, during the COVID-19 outbreak or with the future implementation of emission control strategies, on atmospheric NH(3) can be better demonstrated by isotope-based source apportionment of NH(3), rather than only by changes in NH(3) concentrations.","Zhang, Yangyang; Liu, Xuejun; Fang, Yunting; Liu, Duanyang; Tang, Aohan; Collett, Jeffrey L.",Environ Sci Technol Lett,420,24

They provide education, stimulate discussion, and build faculty reputation. The COVID-19 pandemic led to cancellations in teaching conferences and lost opportunities for all of the above starting in March 2020. The social medial hashtag #VirtualPathGR and @VirtualPathGR Twitter (San Francisco, CA) accounts (VPGR) were created to address a need for continued engagement in academic pathology, during and after periods of physical distancing. METHODS: #VirtualPathGR was first used on March 21, 2020 to assess interest in a VPGR format. Six pathologists organized a social-media based platform, utilizing video conferencing. Zoom (San Jose, CA) was selected because it is free and easy to use. A committee developed criteria for inviting hosts and speakers, developed a logo and template for announcements and promoted VPGR. Potential speakers were selected initially via self-nomination and subsequently by selections from the VPGR board. Free pre-registration was required to minimize risk of disruption by malicious actors. Academic institutions served as “hosts” similar to traditional GR, and the speaker was introduced by one of the VPGR board members. Evaluations were sent to participants via the chat function in Zoom. Lectures were recorded and archived via YouTube (San Bruno, CA). RESULTS: As of May 1, #VirtualPathGR has 2.6 million impressions and the Twitter account has 808 followers. From April 2 to May 1, five VPGR were held with 1,720 registrations (average 344 per event) and 829 Zoom attendees overall (average 165 per event). 4 separate academic host institutions were involved and speakers included Assistant to Full Professors. Participants from 16 different countries attended the live sessions. The archived talks have been viewed 954 times via YouTube. VPGR received support from the American Society for Clinical Pathology (Chicago, IL), leading to a partnership to provide CME credit. CONCLUSION: VPGR serves as strong proof of concept of the ability and demand for high quality academic pathology talks to be given remotely. VPGR promotes academic engagement and provides career-building opportunities by partnering with host universities. While remote learning comes with challenges, VPGR shows that the pathology community can harness the power of remote technologies to enhance learning across the world, now and in the future.","Wobker, S E; Mirza, K M; Jiang, X; Gonzalez, R",Am J Clin Pathol,420,16

NB features changes in the normal voiding pattern at the bladder filling and emptying phases. Overactive NB is characterized by urgency symptoms, with or without urinary incontinence, caused by NB. This disorder affects many domains of life (physical, social, psychological, domestic, sexual) that limit personal autonomy and degrade the quality of life. Among the several treatments available, the conservative physical therapy intervention through tibial nerve electrostimulation (TNES) and parasacral electrostimulation (PSES) can help improve patient conditions with a smaller number of collateral effects than those of interventions based on medication. The aim of the present study is to compare the effects of TNES and PSES techniques in women with overactive NB after stroke episodes to assess the impact of urinary incontinence in these women, on their number of incontinence episodes, daytime and nocturnal urinary frequency, and quality of life. METHODS: This is a prospective clinical study to compare two randomized groups based on parallel and blind conditions. Forty-four women who have had a stroke episode at least 30 days before the trial and who have developed overactive NB will be recruited for the trial. All patients will be subjected to initial evaluation and randomly divided into two groups, TNES and PSES. Subsequently, the two groups will be subjected to a 12-session intervention protocol, twice a week. A new evaluation will be performed after the intervention. DISCUSSION: The results of this study will contribute to the physiotherapeutic treatment of women with NB after a stroke episode since such results will add information about the benefits of this treatment, urinary control, and the improvements in the quality of life of these women.

Approaches to constructing scenarios for developing this zone in the unity of socioeconomic, scientific, technological, infrastructural, and urban planning solutions are considered. The layouts of the future Akademgorodok 2.0 for the three considered scenarios are presented. The approaches to establishing the management system in the science polis zone are analyzed (including the one focusing on the Federal Law On innovative scientific and technological centers and on amendments to certain legislative acts of the Russian Federation). As an alternative management model, a proposal is formulated to organize the National Science and Technology Corporation for the Development of Siberia as a joint-stock company. It is not only to ensure the effective use of funds allocated for Akademgorodok 2.0 projects but also to address the issues of earning and reproducing the financial resources for these purposes. It is concluded that Akademgorodok 2.0 is among the successful experiences of setting up a regional scientific and innovation ecosystem in Russia.

After illustrating the specificities of these areas in terms of transport accessibility, orography, and the relationship between populations, a new territorial organization is proposed, integrating the new tendencies in mobility. The development of the transport system of these marginal areas plays a key role in future scenarios. In the paper, some analysis highlights the infrastructural weaknesses and the limited accessibility of the inner areas and its negative effects on the local economy. These can be overcome fixing reference hubs, with the function of supplying services and connecting most developed and rich territories located in the coastal areas. On a regional basis, the reference hubs would accomplish the task of a firm, efficient link with the mainland, while the minor hubs would have the function of spreading the urban impact throughout the territory. The strategy matches with the improvement in land accessibility, with vast intervention on the inner road system, and with the creation of a system of strong links with the main urban settlements of the island and with the regional and national transport network. A further strategy is maximizing the integration among infrastructural systems, productive structures, agricultural areas, services, and residential centers, with the perspective of promoting the tourist and environmental vocation of Sardinia. Finally, a new criteria for the infrastructures, integration of the different transport modes with the main transport terminals, is proposed.","Coni, Mauro; Garau, Chiara; Maltinti, Francesca; Pinna, Francesco",Computational Science and Its Applications - ICCSA 2020,420,7

There is a persistent history of disparities linked to socioeconomic and social status, family cohesion and interactions, sexual orientation, gender identity, and gender expression, race, ethnicity, immigration, and religion, and disabilities and special health needs in the U.S. school system. The social problem of bullying within U.S. schools is both complex and diverse. It is clear that the sources and factors associated with the vulnerability and marginalization of youth to being victimized at school presented in this book also intersect. Although homes, schools, and neighborhoods may never be completely bully-free environments, there are several ways to assist students in breaking the bullying and peer victimization cycles. The information presented in this book is also one calling for advocacy, which will suggest that if policymakers, school administrators, and community stakeholders are seeking to address and ameliorate bullying within schools, it is vital to consider the significance of various forms of social inequality.","Peguero, Anthony A.; Hong, Jun Sung",School Bullying,420,1

The Institutional Matrix and Community of states that make up the Union seemingly cannot catch a break as they meander through a succession of crises and challenges. These are taking their toll on the EU, its unity in decision making, and countries’ commitment to ever closer Union. The sovereign debt crisis and so-called Greek Euro Crisis shook the tacit belief in the current economic architecture of the bloc and questioned the belief in intra-European solidarity. Shortly thereafter, the refugee crisis saw European States adopt ad hoc and sometimes contradictory measures for border control which peaked with the bringing into question of the current Schengen architecture and the long-held commitment to open borders on the continent. Then came the long and convoluted saga of Brexit. With its continuous series of negotiations, exit treaties, and successions of Governments, it reached its conclusion with the exit of UK from the bloc—the first secession in the history of the EU. With the decade coming to a close, European society assumed and hoped that that would constitute the final stress test of 2010s, only for the global pandemic to wreak havoc to the economy that was recovering from the financial crisis’ fallout.

To answer this question, this paper presents an empirical analysis connecting citizen trust in the European Union with a variable intended to be a measure of the monetary policy strategy of the European Central Bank, namely, the interest rate on government bonds extracted from the 1-year maturity yield curve. The dynamic panel technique, applied to nineteen Eurozone countries for the time span of 2004–2018, estimates the presence of a long-run common relationship between the variables despite allowing different short-run adjustment mechanisms. Results are revealed to be not univocal: the easy monetary policy strategy is associated for the whole period with a decline of trust, and therefore, despite its impressiveness, it was not sufficient to relaunch the European Union project. However, when considering the change in strategy of the post-2013 period, it seemed to have contributed to a slight inversion of the decline of trust. These results highlight the importance of non-conventional measures and call for further support from coordinated policy action as a response to the negative shock deriving from the COVID-19 pandemic.","Liotti, Giorgio; Canale, Rosaria Rita",Econ Polit,420,17

Various experimental models involving cell cultures exposed to lipid overload and rodents on high fat diet have been used to investigate the ameliorative effects of various polyphenols against metabolic anomalies. Here, we systematically searched and included literature reporting on the impact of polyphenols against metabolic function, particularly through the modulation of mitochondrial bioenergetics within the skeletal muscle. This is of interest since the skeletal muscle is rich in mitochondria and remains one of the main sites of energy homeostasis. Notably, increased substrate availability is consistent with impaired mitochondrial function and enhanced oxidative stress in preclinical models of metabolic disease.

The peaceful sit-in, which survived repeated vilification, attacks, and even a communal riot, created for the first time a significant challenge to the Hindu majoritarian philosophy of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and its parent organisation, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS). In March 2020, as the country went into a lockdown, the government finally managed to evacuate the protestors, but as several commentators have argued, Shaheen Bagh had ceased to be a geographical site and had become a reimagination of the nation itself. Mirch Masala, set in a village in western India in the 1940s, is considered to be one of the first feminist Hindi films. The narrative of the film revolves around a resistance set up by some of the village women against the local colonial official’s lecherous desires for one of them. While there are obviously significant differences between the narrative of the film and the real-life protest, both allow us to study gendered spaces and reimaginations of citizenships.","Das Gupta, Uttaran",Jindal Global Law Review,420,12

AIMS: To compare health care use, physiological variables, and HF decompensations during one month before and during the first month of the first French national lockdown for COVID-19 among patients undergoing remote monitoring. METHODS: Transmitted vital parameters and data from cardiac implantable electronic devices were analyzed in 51 patients. Medical contact was defined as the sum of visits and days of hospitalization. RESULTS: The lockdown was associated with a marked decrease in cardiology medical contact (118 days before vs 26 days during, -77%, p = 0.003) and overall medical contact (180 days before vs 79 days during, -58%, p = 0.005). Patient adherence with remote monitoring was 84±21% before and 87±19% during lockdown. The lockdown was not associated with significant changes in various parameters, including physical activity (2±1 to 2±1 h/day), weight (83±16 to 83±16 kg), systolic blood pressure (121±19 to 121±18 mmHg), heart rate (68±10 to 67±10 bpm), heart rate variability (89±44 to 78±46 ms, p = 0.05), atrial fibrillation burden (84±146 vs 86±146 h/month), or thoracic impedance (66±8 to 66±9 Ω). Seven cases of HF decompensations were observed before lockdown, all but one of which required hospitalization, versus six during lockdown, all but one of which were managed remotely. CONCLUSIONS: The lockdown restrictions caused a marked decrease in health care use but no significant change in the clinical status of HF patients under multiparametric remote monitoring. LAY SUMMARY: The first French COVID-19 lockdown had a huge detrimental impact on conventional health care use (-78% in cardiology medical contact). However the lockdown had little impact over the short-term, if any, on vital parameters and the clinical status of patients with heart failure who were adherent to multiparametric remote monitoring. This remote monitoring strategy allowed early identification and home management of most of the heart failure decompensations during the lockdown.","Ploux, Sylvain; Strik, Marc; Abu-Alrub, Saer; Ramirez, F Daniel; Buliard, Samuel; Marchand, Hugo; Picard, François; Eschalier, Romain; Haïssaguerre, Michel; Bordachar, Pierre",Eur Heart J Digit Health,420,16

Using Microsoft Teams software, Brighton and Sussex Medical School transitioned to remote surgical teaching. We discuss the early feedback from students and tutors. METHOD: All students (N = 40) and tutors (N = 7) were invited to complete an online feedback survey. RESULTS: Twenty students responded. Nine preferred remote teaching. The teaching was described as either good (10/20) or excellent (10/20). Small group teaching, lectures and student lead seminar sessions all received positive feedback. Students preferred sessions that were interactive. One hour was optimal (17/20). There was no consensus over class size. 15/20 (75%) would like remote teaching to continue after the pandemic. All tutors responded. There was a preference towards shorter sessions: 45 minutes (2/7) one hour (5/7). Tutors found virtual sessions less interactive (6/7). All tutors would like remote teaching to continue after the pandemic. Three suggested extending teaching to remote surgical ward rounds. Concern was raised by both students and tutors regarding the absence of practical skills. CONCLUSIONS: The value of remote teaching has been highlighted by COVID-19. Our feedback recommends a transition towards blended learning; using the convenience of remote teaching to help augment traditional medical school teaching.","Harris, H; Khera, G; Alanbuki, A r; Ray, K; Yusuf, W; Harvey, R",Br J Surg,420,24

In this paper, we provide ways of developing a holistic research strategy using bibliometric-data driven approaches that integrate network analysis and information management, without the need for full paper access. This protocol is a comprehensive multi-modular pathway for analysis of metadata obtained from major scientific publishing houses by the use of a Decision Support System (DSS). A simple case study on the invasive species Lantana camara has been presented as a proof-of-concept to show how one can implement this DSS based protocol. Some perspectives are also provided on how the outcomes can be used directly or scaled up for long term research interventions. We hope that this work will simplify exploratory literature review, and enable rational design of research objectives for scholars, as well as the development of comprehensive grant proposals that address gaps in research.","Mishra, Preet; Prasad, Abhishek; Babu, Suresh; Yadav, Gitanjali",Proc.Indian Natl,420,1

This study aimed to assess the changes in HFI during the pandemic and examine the interlinkages between HFI with child feeding practices and coping strategies in Uttar Pradesh, India. METHODS: We conducted a longitudinal quantitative survey with 569 mothers with children <2y in December 2019 (in-person) and August 2020 (by phone). We measured HFI by using the Household Food Insecurity Access Scale and examined the changes in HFI during the pandemic using the Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-rank tests. We then assessed child feeding practices and coping strategies by HFI status using multivariable regression models. RESULTS: HFI increased sharply from 21% to 80% before and during COVID-19, with 62% households changing the status from food security to insecurity and 17% remaining food insecure. Children belonging to newly and consistently food-insecure households were less likely to consume a diversified diet (adjusted odds ratio, AOR: 0.56, P = 0.03 and AOR: 0.45, P = 0.04, respectively) compared to those in food-secure households. Households with food insecurity were more likely to engage in coping strategies for obtaining foods including reducing other essential non-food expenditures (AOR: 1.7–2.2), borrowing money to buy food (AOR: 3.6–4.3), selling jewelry (AOR: 3.0–5.0), and spending savings or selling other assets (AOR∼2.0), all P < 0.05. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 had a significant negative impact on HFI, which in turn had implications for child feeding practices and coping strategies. Our findings highlighted the need for further investment in targeted social protection strategies and safety nets as part of multisectoral solutions to improve HFI during and post-COVID-19.

After analyzing these three moral systems, I find that beneficence lies within the very essence of humanity. Human beings are superior to other creatures in the world due to rationality and humanity. From the humanitarian ground, a common goodness lies within every human. Beneficence, as a moral principle, is derived from this inner humanity of every individual. Despite their initial differences, utilitarianism, deontology and virtue ethics recognize this fundamental humanitarian disposition of doing good for all as a part of being a morally better person. The principle of beneficence as I suggest, is different from its consequential utilitarian notion suggested by Mill. This version of beneficence is more credible as it does not impose excessive demands upon an individual to develop any maximum beneficial outcome following utilitarian calculation of beneficence over cost, and it also strives to overcome the rigorous duty-based theory of Kantian deontology by appealing to the fundamental virtue of humanity. Finally, the credibility of this form of beneficence comes from the underlying transcendental humanism which is the chief feature of Indian tradition.","Pandit, Prasasti",J,420,1

Kounis syndrome is mediated by mast cells that interact with macrophages and T-lymphocytes, causing degranulation and inflammation with cytokine release. It is a life-threatening condition that has many trigger factors and is most commonly caused by medicines. Case Presentation. A 71-year-old male was admitted with a fever of five days' duration associated with cellulitis, for which he had been treated with clindamycin and flucloxacillin before admission. He was a diagnosed patient with hypertension and dyslipidemia five years ago. After taking the antibiotics, he had developed generalized itching followed by urticaria suggesting an allergic reaction. Therefore, he was admitted to the hospital. After admission, he developed an ischaemic-type chest pain associated with autonomic symptoms and shortness of breath. An immediate ECG was taken that showed ST-segment depressions in the chest leads V4–V6, confirmed by a repeat ECG. Troponin I was 8 ng/mL. Acute management of ACS was started, and prednisolone 10 mg daily dose was given. After complete recovery, the patient was discharged with aspirin, clopidogrel, atorvastatin, metoprolol, losartan, isosorbide mononitrate, and nicorandil. Prednisolone 10 mg daily dose was given for five days after discharge. CONCLUSION: In immediate hypersensitivity, with persistent cardiovascular instability, Kounis syndrome should be considered, and an electrocardiogram and other appropriate assessments and treatments should be initiated. Prompt management of the allergic reaction and the ACS is vital for a better outcome of Kounis syndrome.","Karunathilake, Parackrama; Ralapanawa, Udaya; Jayalath, Thilak; Abeyagunawardena, Shamali",Case Rep Med,420,1

Direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) therapy for venous thromboembolism (VTE) is now as common as vitamin K antagonist (VKA) treatment, but data are sparse regarding outcomes for patients with low-risk PE treated with DOACs as outpatients. We conducted a systematic review of literature on outcomes of outpatient management for PE, including comparisons to inpatient treatment and differences by anticoagulant class. METHODS We searched Medline, Embase, PubMed, CENTRAL, clinicaltrials.gov, and ICTRN for studies published from January 1980 through February 2019 using a predefined strategy developed with a medical librarian. We included English-language randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and prospective nonrandomized trials (NRTs) of adult patients diagnosed with acute, symptomatic pulmonary embolism and discharged from the emergency department (ED) or within 48 hours. Our primary outcome included four major adverse outcomes (all-cause mortality, PE-related mortality, recurrent VTE, and major bleeding) within 30 and 90 days. A preplanned subanalysis of high-quality studies assessed outcomes associated with different anticoagulation treatment classes. RESULTS Our initial search identified 6,818 records, of which 12 studies (4 RCT, 8 NRT) with a total of 3191 patients were included in the review. All RCTs and six NRTs were determined to have low-moderate risk of bias and were classified as high quality. Outpatients in these studies (n=1814) had rates of 90-day major adverse outcomes below 1%, including all-cause mortality (0.7% [95% CI 0.4-1.2%]), PE-related mortality (0.06% [0.01-0.3%]), recurrent VTE (0.8% [0.5-1.4%]) and major bleeding (0.8% [0.5-1.4%]). Exploratory analysis revealed no association between anticoagulant treatment class and rates of major adverse outcomes. CONCLUSIONS Among patients with low-risk PE treated as outpatients, few patients experienced major adverse outcomes such as mortality, recurrent VTE, or major bleeding within 90 days.","Maughan, Brandon C; Frueh, Lisa; McDonagh, Marian S; Casciere, Bryan; Kline, Jeffrey A",Academic emergency medicine : official journal of the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine,420,1

The pigment Y exhibited a significant level of antibacterial activity against the tested pathogens Salmonella typhi (MTCC 733), Staphylococcus aureus (MTCC 1430), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MTCC 2453), Klebsiella pneumoniae (MTCC 432), Escherichia coli (MTCC 1610), Salmonella paratyphi (3220), Bacillus subtilis (441) and Acinetobacter baumannii (12,889). The minimum inhibitory concentration of crude pigment extract Y for most of the bacterial pathogens tested was below or equal to 0.25 µg/mL and the minimum bactericidal concentration was below or equal to 0.5 µg/mL. In the cytotoxicity evaluation, crude pigment Y exhibited less toxicity toward normal cells lines (L929). Crude pigment extract Y also showed powerful anticancer activity toward melanoma cancer cells (A375). The IC50 value obtained was 68.08 µg/mL. Acridine orange (AO) and ethidium bromide (EB) double staining of cells treated with the pigment helped in the morphological assessment of nuclear condensation, apoptotic bodies and live cells. The DNA fragmentation analysis and caspase-9 quantification in the pigment-treated A375 cells determined the apoptosis activity mediated by the crude pigment extract Y. The compounds in the crude pigment extract Y was identified by HR-LCMS analysis. Further studies on the active compounds can lead to a rise in new drugs for cancer treatment and also against rising antibacterial resistant pathogens.","Ashitha, A; Radhakrishnan, E K; Mathew, Jyothis",Current microbiology,420,25

We aimed to study the role of inflammatory markers, serum C-reactive protein (CRP) and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), in predicting infection, blood culture positivity, and short-term (1 month) mortality in hospitalized cirrhotic patients. METHODS This prospective study was done over a period of 14 months (October 2017 to November 2018). Patient data included age, gender, etiology of cirrhosis, reason for admission, and comorbidity. Laboratory tests included blood chemistry and blood cell counts, and blood and urine culture. The specific tests included were CRP and NLR. Survival of patients in the following 1 month was noted. Area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), sensitivity, specificity, predictive values, diagnostic accuracy were calculated and logistic regression analysis performed. A p-value < 0.05 was considered significant. RESULTS Two hundred and eight patients formed the study cohort. The median age was 51.5 years and male predominance was noted. Alcohol-related liver disease (49%) was the commonest etiology. The infection rate was 62%, culture positivity was 58.5%, and mortality was 30.8%. NLR and CRP were significantly higher in those with documented infection (culture positive or negative) and among nonsurvivors. Optimal cutoffs for NLR and CRP to predict infection were 5.86 and 33.7, respectively. The risk of having an infection was 7.5 times and about 15 times if NLR and CRP were above the cutoffs. The risk of 1-month mortality was 2-3 times higher if patients had NLR and CRP above the cutoffs. The combination of NLR and CRP (≥ 5.86 and ≥ 33.7, respectively) increased specificity and diagnostic accuracy for infection. CONCLUSION NLR and CRP were independently good predictors of infection and 1-month survival among the patients with cirrhosis of liver included in this study.","Tapadia, Ashishkumar; Jain, Mayank; Reddy, Mettu Srinivas; Mahadevan, B; Varghese, Joy; Venkataraman, Jayanthi",Indian journal of gastroenterology : official journal of the Indian Society of Gastroenterology,420,19

METHODS We retrospectively enrolled 133 adult patients who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with the nasal RAE tube after head and neck surgery. Postoperative chest radiography was performed to confirm nasal RAE tube depth immediately after the patient was admitted to the ICU. Proper tube depth was defined as the tube tip between 2 and 7 cm above the carina. The patients were divided into the proper-depth group (78 patients) and the improper-depth group (55 patients). Patients' characteristics were collected. The risk factors for improper postoperative tube depth were assessed using logistic regression analysis. MAIN RESULTS All patients who showed improper tube depth had a shallow tube depth (the tube tip > 7 cm above the carina). Multivariable analysis revealed that tall stature [odds ratio (OR) 1.16; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.08-1.25; P < 0.001], prolonged anesthesia duration (OR 1.16; 95% CI 1.02-1.32; P = 0.026), and right-sided surgical field as compared to the left (OR 0.36; 95% CI 0.14-0.93; P = 0.034) or median field (OR 0.25; 95% CI 0.07-0.85; P = 0.027) were risk factors associated with postoperative shallow tube depth.

METHODS We carried out a study to investigate the antimicrobial effects of each of the 5 substances comprising virus block (VB): 3 PMs that have antibacterial and antiviral activity, an antibiotic agent, and an antibacterial agent. We also investigated the effectiveness of the addition of VB to moist hand towels in a study involving 120 volunteers. The time-dependent changes in metal ion concentrations in aqueous VB solution were analyzed using inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy. RESULTS The metal elements in the aqueous VB solution remained stable for 12 weeks without undergoing time-dependent changes. DISCUSSION Further investigations were performed to study hand hygiene using moist hand towels in daily life settings. To this end, 120 volunteers provided 240 specimens that were used to investigate the presence of antibacterial compounds on the volunteers' hands before and after hand towel use. An aliquot of each specimen was suspended in phosphate-buffered saline and plated on agar media, and the number of colonies formed was counted. Normal bacterial flora found on the hands of the volunteers was investigated before and after the use of 4 different moist hand towels. CONCLUSIONS The effects of VB and PMs were superior to those of commercial moist hand towels, indicating that effective data were obtained that may be useful for the practical application of the tested items.","Dan, Katsuaki; Katoh, Naohiro; Matsuoka, Takaaki; Fujinami, Katsuyuki",Pharmacology,420,16

This paper describes the development of the ACE HSS and showcases its application with cell and gene therapy products as the first example. METHODS A literature review of existing HSS methods, including the processes of the EuroScan International Network and other overseas horizon scanning agencies, was done to inform the development of our horizon scanning framework. The framework was first applied to the new and emerging cell and gene therapies. RESULTS Identification sources, filtration and prioritization criteria, and horizon scanning outputs for the HSS were developed in alignment to international best practices, with recommendations for technology uptake represented by a traffic light system. For the first horizon scanning exercise on cell and gene therapies, forty therapies passed the filtration step, of which eight were prioritized for further assessment. The few early reports developed were used to inform and prepare the healthcare system for their potential introduction, particularly in terms of the need to develop health and funding policies. CONCLUSIONS Early assessment of prioritized topics has provided support for strategic efforts within the Ministry of Health. Given that ACE's horizon scanning program is still in its infancy, the framework will continue to evolve to ensure relevance to our stakeholders so that it remains fit for purpose for our healthcare system.","Wong, Wan Qing; Lin, Liang; Ju, Hong; Ng, Kwong",International journal of technology assessment in health care,420,10

The aim of this study is to assess the results of MTA in a large series of patients. METHODS This was a prospective study assessing the use of MTA in patients with malignant liver tumors. The procedures were done mostly laparoscopically and ablation zones created were assessed for completeness of tumor response, spherical geometry and recurrence on tri-phasic CT scans done on follow-up. RESULTS There were a total of 53 patients with an average of 3 tumors measuring 1.5 cm. Ablations were performed laparoscopically in all but eight patients. Morbidity was 11.3% (n = 6), and mortality zero. On postoperative scans, there was 99.3% tumor destruction. Roundness indices A, B, and transverse were 1.1, 1.0, and 0.9, respectively. At a median follow-up of 4.5 months, incomplete ablation was seen in 1 of 149 lesions treated (0.7%) and local tumor recurrence in 1 lesion (0.7%). CONCLUSIONS The results of this series confirm the safety and feasibility of MTA technology. The 99.3% rate of complete tumor ablation and low rate of local recurrence at short-term follow up are promising.","Zaidi, Nisar; Okoh, Alexis; Yigitbas, Hakan; Yazici, Pinar; Ali, Noaman; Berber, Eren",Journal of surgical oncology,420,23

DISCUSSION A thorough understanding of the tenets of the operation and advanced skills in minimally invasive laparoscopy are needed for long-term freedom from symptomatic and anatomic recurrence. These include complete reduction of the hernia sac from the mediastinum back into the abdomen with careful preservation of the integrity of muscle and peritoneal lining of the crura, aggressive and complete mobilization of the esophagus to the level of the inferior pulmonary vein, vagal preservation, clear identification of the gastroesophageal junction to allow accurate assessment of the intraabdominal esophageal length, and use of Collis gastroplasty when esophageal lengthening is required for a tension-free intraabdominal repair. Liberal mobilization of the phrenosplenic and phrenogastric attachments substantially increases the mobility of the left limb of the crura, allowing for a tension-free primary closure in a large percentage of patients.

DI reproduces the space flight factors such as lack of support, mechanical and axial unloading, physical inactivity, elimination of vertical vascular gradient. Long-term bed rest is also associated with similar factors, so the results of the study may be useful for clinical medicine. Computer plantography and measuring the stiffness of the soft tissues of the foot and superficial muscles of the shin (mm. tibialis anterior and peroneus longus) were performed twice before DI exposure, on the 2nd and 4th days of DI exposure, as well as on the 2nd day of the recovery period. DI exposure effects the parameters under study in two ways: by raising the longitudinal arch and by flattening the transverse arch, which is accompanied by a decrease in the soft tissues stiffness of the foot and superficial muscles of the shin. The work reveals the phenomenon of compensating the longitudinal arch state by changing the characteristics that reflect the transverse arch state. The results of the study for the first time demonstrate the correlation of the foot morphological characteristics with a decrease in stiffness of mm. peroneus longus and tibialis anterior.","Saveko, Alina; Amirova, Liubov; Ermakov, Ivan; Smirnov, Yuri; Tomilovskaya, Elena; Kozlovskaya, Inesa",Scientific reports,420,1

This carries cost and capacity implications for hospitals with additional strain on endoscopy units during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. The Kangaroo Feeding Tube with IRIS Technology (IRIS) uses optical visualization to guide bedside placement, obviating the need for endoscopy. We describe a case series of bedside postpyloric enteral feeding tube placement using the IRIS tube. METHODS This was a prospective, single-center case series over 12 mo. Conscious and sedated adult participants were included. Exclusion criteria were altered anatomy and need for endoscopy for other indications. IRIS placement was confirmed by contrast radiograph. RESULTS Twenty attempts were made in 19 participants (13 women). The primary indication was intolerance of gastric feeding. The overall success rate was 75%. In sedated participants, 5 (83%) of 6 tubes were successful in 5 participants. In conscious participants, 10 (71%) of 14 tubes were successful in 14 participants. Placement failure in conscious participants was due to intolerance of the camera tip during nasal passage. The median procedure time was 13.5 min. In all cases, correct position as deemed by the operator was confirmed with contrast radiograph. No complications were observed. CONCLUSIONS To our knowledge, this is the largest single series of bedside postpyloric enteral feeding tube placement using the IRIS tube to date. The success rate and safety profile reported here, together with the potential benefits (reduced feeding delays, costs, and need for endoscopy) suggest that further, large-scale studies are warranted.","Cardona, Eva; Mehta, Shameer",Nutrition,420,1

The causative role of anaesthetic toxicity remains unclear. Using clinical tests, no clear-cut differences have been observed between anaesthetics so far. The aim of this trial was to compare the incidence of POCD diagnosed by a battery of neuropsychologic tests after propofol and sevoflurane anaesthesia. Secondary goal was to examine possible relationship between POCD positivity and changes in auditory event-related potentials (ERPs). Sixty patients undergoing lumbar discectomy were prospectively randomized to receive depth-controlled sevoflurane (SEVO) or propofol (PROP) based anaesthesia. The neuropsychological examination and auditory event-related potentials (N1, P3a and P3b components) recording was performed preoperatively and on days 1, 6 and 42 after surgery. POCD was defined as a decline of more than one standard deviation in three or more tests. In 43 patients (20 in PROP and 23 in SEVO group) all selected tests were performed and used for the evaluation. POCD was present in 48%/60%, 18%/20% and 17%/11% (SEVO/PROP) of patients on days 1, 6 and 42 after surgery, with no significant intergroup difference. Among neuropsychologic tests, the most significant decline was observed in Semantic Verbal Fluency and Letter-Number Sequencing Test scores, congruently in both groups on days 1 and 6, with full recovery on the last control. Transient deteriorations in other tests were observed as well. No association of POCD positivity and ERPs changes was found, although long-term modifications of P3a and P3b components were observed, mainly in SEVO group. In our study, sevoflurane and propofol anaesthesia was associated with the similar incidence of POCD. Cognitive decline, mainly affecting executive functions, was temporary in most of the patients. Prolonged ERPs alterations after the anaesthesia seem not to have any relationship with the impairment registered by the neuropsychological examination and may represent subclinical changes.","Kletecka, Jakub; Holeckova, Irena; Brenkus, Pavel; Pouska, Jiri; Benes, Jan; Chytra, Ivan",Journal of clinical monitoring and computing,420,1

We analysed household purchase data based on bar codes to assess the impact of these policy options in the medium term for Scotland and in the immediate term for Wales. METHODS For these location-controlled, interrupted time series regression analyses, the data source was Kantar WorldPanel's household shopping panel, which, at the time of our analysis, included 35 242 British households providing detailed information on 1·24 million separate alcohol purchases in 2015-18 and the first half of 2020. With no data exclusions, we analysed the impact of introducing MUP in Scotland, using purchases in northern England as control, and in Wales, using western England as control. The studied changes associated with MUP were price paid per gram of alcohol purchased, grams of alcohol purchased, and amount of money spent on alcohol. FINDINGS In Scotland, price increases and purchase decreases following the introduction of MUP in 2018 were maintained during the first half of 2020. The difference between Scotland and northern England in 2020 was a price increase of 0·741 p per gram (95% CI 0·724-0·759), a 7·6% increase, and a purchase decrease of 7·063 g per adult per household per day that an alcohol purchase was made (6·656-7·470), a 7·7% decrease. In Wales, the introduction of MUP led to similar results. The difference between Wales and western England was a price increase 0·841 of 0·841 p per gram (0·732-0·951), an 8·2% increase, and a purchase decrease of 7·052 g per adult per household per day that an alcohol purchase was made (6·463-7·640), an 8·6% decrease. For both Scotland and Wales, reductions in overall purchases of alcohol were largely restricted to households that bought the most alcohol. The introduction of MUP was not associated with an increased expenditure on alcohol by households that generally bought small amounts of alcohol and, in particular, those with low incomes. The changes were not affected by the introduction of COVID-19 confinement in the UK on March 26, 2020. INTERPRETATION The evidence base supporting the positive, targeted impact of MUP is strengthened by the comparable results for Scotland and Wales. The short-term impact of MUP in Scotland during 2018 is maintained during the first half of 2020. MUP is an effective alcohol policy option to reduce off-trade purchases of alcohol and should be widely considered.

It provides guidance for the development of safe and effective MERS-CoV vaccines. EXPERT OPINION Although many MERS-CoV vaccines have been developed, most remain at the preclinical stage. Some vaccines demonstrate immunogenicity and efficacy in animal models, while others have potential adverse effects or low efficacy against high-dose or divergent virus strains.

Since the British Thoracic Society encourages ACP in chronic respiratory disease, the objective was to systematically review ACP practice in chronic respiratory disease, attitudes of patients and HCPs and barriers and facilitators related to engagement in ACP. METHODS We systematically searched 12 electronic databases for empirical studies on ACP in adults with chronic respiratory diseases. Identified studies underwent full review and data extraction. RESULTS Of 2509 studies, 21 were eligible: 10 were quantitative studies. Although a majority of patients was interested in engaging in ACP, ACP was rarely carried out. Many HCPs acknowledged the importance of ACP but were hesitant to initiate it. Barriers to engagement in ACP were the complex disease course of patients with chronic respiratory diseases, HCPs' concern of taking away patients' hopes and lack of continuity of care. The identification of trigger points and training of HCPs on how to communicate sensitive topics were identified as facilitators to engagement in ACP. CONCLUSIONS In conclusion, ACP is surprisingly uncommon in chronic respiratory disease, possibly due to the complex disease course of chronic respiratory diseases and ambivalence of both patients and HCPs to engage in ACP. Providing patients with information about their disease can help meeting their needs. Additionally, support of HCPs through identification of trigger points, training and system-related changes can facilitate engagement in ACP.

The objective of this study was to compare recurrence rate and quality of life between foam sclerotherapy and RFA in patients with incompetent GSV varicose veins. METHODS In this parallel single-blinded randomized clinical trial, 60 adult patients with primary varicose veins due to incompetent GSV (CEAP classes C2-4EPAsPr) were included and randomly divided to receive RFA or foam sclerotherapy. Health-related quality of life (HRQOL) was assessed by the Short Form 36, and the Aberdeen Varicose Vein Questionnaire (AVVQ) was applied to assess the impact of varicose veins on quality of life of the patients. In addition, pain severity after the procedures was investigated by a visual analog scale (VAS) (range, 0 to 10). The patients were followed at 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months postoperation. GSV reflux and recurrence was assessed by color Doppler ultrasound examination after 6 months. RESULTS Twenty-eight patients in RFA and 27 patients in foam sclerotherapy remained for the final analyses. The time interval from the procedure and recovery to daily normal activities was 1 day in both groups. Mean (±SD) pain VAS score in RFA group decreased from preintervention score of 7.35 (±3.28) to 1.21 (±0.68); P < .0001. Likewise, this score decreased from 6.64 (±2.04) to 1.29 (±0.91) in foam sclerotherapy group. HRQOL scores increased gradually at 1, 3, and 6 months after the intervention. AVVQ scores decreased significantly 1 week postintervention in both groups. After 6 months, 17.9% (5 patients) in RFA group and 14.8% (4 patients) in foam sclerotherapy group had recurrence of GSV reflux (P = .52). CONCLUSION Both foam sclerotherapy and RFA were effective in treatment of GSV reflux. Comparable findings were observed between the 2 groups regarding postoperative pain, recovery time, HRQOL, and AVVQ scores.","Rai, Alireza; Porsalman, Mahtab; Khatony, Alireza; Sobhiyeh, Mohammadreza",Journal of vascular nursing : official publication of the Society for Peripheral Vascular Nursing,420,1

However, this approach is technically demanding. Although robotic technology may overcome the limitations of this approach, the system can be difficult to dock, especially in the lithotomy position. OBJECTIVE The study aim is thus to report the technical details of robotic transanal endoscopic microsurgery with the use of a lateral approach. DESIGN AND SETTINGS This study is a prospective evaluation of robotic transanal endoscopic microsurgery in a single tertiary institution, under a protocol approved by our local ethics committee. INTERVENTION Patients underwent a routine mechanical bowel preparation and were placed in the left or right lateral position according to the tumor location. A circular anal dilatator was used together with the glove port technique. The robotic system was then docked over the hip. A 30° optic and 2 articulated instruments were used with an additional assistant trocar. The tumor excision was realized with an atraumatic grasper and an articulated cautery hook, and the defect was closed with barbed continuous stiches in each case. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE The primary outcome was the safety and feasibility of the procedure. RESULTS Three patients underwent a robotic transanal endoscopic microsurgery with the use of the lateral approach. Mean operative time was 110 minutes, including 20 minutes for the docking of the robot. There was 1 intraoperative complication (a pneumoperitoneum without intraabdominal lesion) and no postoperative complications. Mean hospital stay was 3 days. Margins were negative in all the cases. LIMITATIONS The study was limited by the small number of patients. CONCLUSION Robotic transanal endoscopic microsurgery with use of the lateral approach is feasible and may facilitate the local resection of small lesions of the mid and lower rectum. It might assume an important place in sphincter-preserving surgery, especially for selected and early rectal cancer (see Video, Supplemental Digital Content 1, http://links.lww.com/DCR/A114).","Buchs, Nicolas C; Pugin, François; Volonte, Francesco; Hagen, Monika E; Morel, Philippe; Ris, Frederic",Diseases of the colon and rectum,420,20

METHODS Using prospective method, the 43 cases of confirmed COVID-19 patients in Nanning Fourth People's Hospital from January 22nd to February 15th in 2020 were enrolled and divided into routine treatment group (n = 25) and artesunate treatment group (n = 18) by odd-even rule after admission. According to the guidelines, the routine treatment group was recommended to receive lopinavir/ritonavir 500 mg + α-aerosolized interferon 500×104 U, twice daily; the artesunate treatment group was given artesunate 60 mg, twice daily besides the routine treatment, for 10 days in both groups. During the treatment period, the pharynx swab test of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) nucleic acid was carried out every 2 days, and the routine blood test, liver and kidney functions, blood coagulation function and myocardial enzymes were re-examined. Chest CT was checked every 3 days after the treatment, and re-examined every 5 days after the condition was improved. The routine blood test and biochemical results of two groups were observed, and the efficacy evaluation was performed by monitoring the time for significant improvement of symptoms, negative conversion time of throat swab virus nucleic acid, lung lesion absorption time, adverse drug reactions and the length of hospital stay of the two groups. RESULTS There were no significant differences between the two groups in terms of gender, age, body weight, routine blood test and biochemical results before treatment. In artesunate treatment group, the time for significant improvement of symptoms (days: 3.33±1.91 vs. 4.84±2.19), negative conversion time of 2019-nCoV nucleic acid (days: 4.72±2.16 vs. 6.68±3.76), lung lesion absorption starting time (days: 5.39±2.36 vs. 7.48±3.78), lung lesion absorption greater than 70% time (days: 14.11±4.16 vs. 17.04±4.42) and the length of hospital stay (days: 16.56±3.71 vs. 18.04±3.97) were significantly shorter than those in routine treatment group, with significant differences (all P < 0.05). The incidence of adverse drug reactions in two groups had no significant difference (72.2% vs. 80.0%, P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS Artesunate can shorten the treatment time of COVID-19, improve prognosis and eliminate pathogens, with fewer adverse reactions and a good application prospect.","Lin, Yanrong; Wu, Fengyao; Xie, Zhouhua; Song, Xiaoling; Zhu, Qingdong; Wei, Jing; Tan, Shiji; Liang, Lianshao; Gong, Beibei",Zhonghua wei zhong bing ji jiu yi xue,420,1

AIM To evaluate if a previously described method using dilute sodium bicarbonate injection and the resultant rise in measured end-tidal carbon dioxide tracing can confirm correct intravascular placement of a dysfunctional CVC in children at the bedside. PATIENTS Cohort group of 22 children scheduled for chemotherapy with partial dysfunction of a CVC in a tertiary hematology-oncology care facility. RESULTS All children with a partial dysfunctional CVC that was proven to be intravascular after venogram or thrombolytic therapy had a distinct and predictable increase in end-tidal carbon dioxide response to injected bicarbonate.

We report our 2-year experience with LSG and specifically evaluate the importance of staple-line protection to prevent leakage after the laparoscopic procedure. METHODS One hundred eighteen consecutive patients with BMI > 30 who underwent LSG from January 2006 to February 2009 were included in our study. There were 88 women and 30 men with a mean age of 33.2 ± 9.6 years and a mean BMI of 38.0 ± 6.4 kg/m(2). The first 40 patients (group 1) underwent the operation without any reinforcement procedure and the other 78 patients received reinforcement of the staple-line (group 2). Data including demographics, hospital stay, blood loss, operative time, complications, excess weight loss percentage (EWL%), and gastrointestinal quality of life index (GIQLI) were collected prospectively for evaluation. RESULTS The overall mean operative time was 118.5 ± 37.0 min, mean blood loss was 56.8 ± 56.7 ml, mean hospital stay was 5 ± 3 days. The mean EWL% at 12 and 24 months was 81.5 and 76.0%, respectively. The overall leakage rate was 3.39% (4/118). All leakage occurred in group 1 patients, with a leakage rate of 10% (4/40). Mean preoperative GIQLI was 98.7, and the postoperative GIQLI were 116.4, 115, 112.4, and 97.6 at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months, respectively. CONCLUSIONS LSG is an effective obesity treatment to achieve significant weight loss after 24 months. Staple-line reinforcement is strongly recommended for laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy to decrease complications.","Ser, Kong-Han; Lee, Wei-Jei; Lee, Yi-Chih; Chen, Jung-Chien; Su, Yen-Hao; Chen, Shu-Chun",Surgical endoscopy,420,1

METHODS Study included cases of extreme obese patients with early-stage endometrial cancer who underwent v-NOTES between January 2019 and June 2019 at a tertiary referral medical center. The following parameters were noted: patient age, body mass index (BMI), operating time, conversion to conventional laparoscopy or laparotomy, any intraoperative or postoperative complications, estimated blood loss, pre- and postoperative hemoglobin levels, postoperative pain scores of the patients using visual analogue scale (VAS) at 6th, 12th and 24th h, length of hospital stay and final pathology report. RESULTS Six cases of extreme obese patients with early-stage endometrial cancer underwent hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy via the transvaginal NOTES. These six patients had a mean body mass index of 51.4 kg/m2 (SD = 6,13). No conversion to conventional laparoscopy or even laparotomy was needed in any of these patients. No adjuvant therapy was needed since all of the patients had early-stage endometrial carcinoma. CONCLUSION Given the increased risk of surgical morbidity and mortality associated with increasing BMI, it is paramount importance to establish safe surgical approaches to gynecological pathologies. We think that v-NOTES offers greater benefit to obese patients when performed by an experienced surgeon and v-NOTES is a safe, effective and feasible minimally invasive surgery in extreme obese patients with early endometrial cancer.","Mat, Emre; Kale, Ahmet; Gundogdu, Elif Cansu; Basol, Gulfem; Yildiz, Gazi; Usta, Taner",The journal of obstetrics and gynaecology research,420,31

This study aims to assess the surgeon's surgical performance and ergonomics during the use of a handheld, robotic-driven, articulating laparoscopic instrument during LESS surgery. METHODS Seven right-handed experienced surgeons took part in this study. A set of basic suturing tasks and digestive and urological procedures in a porcine model were performed. Surgeons used both a conventional laparoscopic needle holder and a robotic device. The learning curve, execution time, and precision using the surgical needle were assessed. The surgeon's posture was analyzed using a motion tracking system and a data glove. RESULTS After the training period, execution time on the intracorporeal suturing was significantly shorter using the conventional needle holder. The precision was higher using the conventional instrument in the horizontal plane, but the number of attempts to position the needle was lower using the robotic device (1.625 ± 0.250 vs 1.188 ± 0.375 attempts). The extension of the elbow (134.681 ± 14.35° vs 120.631 ± 13.134°) and the flexion of the shoulder (26.122 ± 7.411° vs 18.475 ± 14.166°) were significantly lower using the robotic instrument. The wrist posture using the robotic device was ergonomically acceptable during both surgical procedures. CONCLUSIONS Results show a positive learning curve in ergonomics and surgical performance using the robotic instrument during LESS surgery. This instrument improves the surgeon's body posture and the needle positioning errors. The use of the robotic instrument is feasible and safe during LESS partial nephrectomy and sigmoidectomy procedures.","Sánchez-Margallo, Francisco Miguel; Sánchez-Margallo, Juan A",Surgical innovation,420,26

Recommendations on the management of acute appendicitis have been based on expert opinion, but very little evidence is available. This study addressed that dearth with a snapshot of worldwide approaches to appendicitis. METHODS The Association of Italian Surgeons in Europe designed an online survey to assess the current attitude of surgeons globally regarding the management of patients with acute appendicitis during the pandemic. Questions were divided into baseline information, hospital organization and screening, personal protective equipment, management and surgical approach, and patient presentation before versus during the pandemic. RESULTS Of 744 answers, 709 (from 66 countries) were complete and were included in the analysis. Most hospitals were treating both patients with and those without COVID. There was variation in screening indications and modality used, with chest X-ray plus molecular testing (PCR) being the commonest (19·8 per cent). Conservative management of complicated and uncomplicated appendicitis was used by 6·6 and 2·4 per cent respectively before, but 23·7 and 5·3 per cent, during the pandemic (both P < 0·001). One-third changed their approach from laparoscopic to open surgery owing to the popular (but evidence-lacking) advice from expert groups during the initial phase of the pandemic. No agreement on how to filter surgical smoke plume during laparoscopy was identified. There was an overall reduction in the number of patients admitted with appendicitis and one-third felt that patients who did present had more severe appendicitis than they usually observe. CONCLUSION Conservative management of mild appendicitis has been possible during the pandemic. The fact that some surgeons switched to open appendicectomy may reflect the poor guidelines that emanated in the early phase of SARS-CoV-2.","Ielpo, B; Podda, M; Pellino, G; Pata, F; Caruso, R; Gravante, G; Di Saverio, S",The British journal of surgery,420,5

Methods: Thirty patients who were diagnosed as Angle class Ⅱ malocclusion, treated by using labial fixed orthodontic appliances and also diagnosed as periodontitis (orthodontic group) were recuited from January 2009 to June 2019 at the School and Hospital of Stomatology, China Medical University in the present study. They were aged (27.0±5.4) years old (ranged 18-41 years old). Another 60 periodontitis patients without a history of orthodontic treatment matched according to age, gender and severity of periodontitis were selected as control group (non-orthodontic group). They were aged (26.7±5.2) years old (ranged 18-41 years old). Cone-beam CT images were used to measure the heights of the alveolar bone defects at each tooth position of the patients. The difference in the heights of the alveolar bone defects between the orthodontic group and the non-orthodontic group at the same position of the maxillary and mandibular alveolar bones were compared. The specificities of the defect heights in different positions of the maxillary and mandibular alveolar bones and different sites of the same tooth position were analyzed among orthodontic group. The specificities of the different tooth positions of the maxillary and mandibular alveolar bones of the different periodontitis stages among orthodontic group were compared. Results: The heights of the alveolar bone defects in the maxillary canine area and molar area, the mandibular incisor area, the canine area and the premolar area in the orthodontic group were higher than that in the non-orthodontic group, and the differences were statistically significant (P<0.05). In orthodontic group, the most severe teeth in the maxillary and mandibular alveolar bone defects were the canine areas [(3.75±1.00), (3.83±1.10) mm]. Secondly, the more severe tooth positions of the maxillary alveolar bone height defects were the molar area [(3.67±0.84) mm] and the incisor area [(3.39±0.83) mm] and the more severe tooth positions of the mandibular alveolar bone defects were the incisor area [(3.73±1.42) mm] and the molar area [(3.54±0.81) mm]. The height of the alveolar bone defect in the mandibular incisor area was greater than that in the maxillary (P<0.05). The bone defect in the maxillary molar area was severer than that of the mandibular area (P<0.05). The alveolar bone defects in the buccal and lingual sides were mostly larger than that of the mesial and distal sides both in maxillary and mandibular positions except for the maxillary incisor area(P<0.05). The most severe alveolar bone defect position changed with the periodontitis stage. The most severe tooth position of the maxillary in stage Ⅰ periodontitis was in the molar area [(3.26±0.63) mm], whereas the incisor area was the most severe tooth of the mandible [(3.14±1.04) mm]. In addition, among maxillary incisor area, canine area, premolar area, molar area, the most severe alveolar bone defect height was the canine area in stage Ⅱ, Ⅲ, Ⅳ mandibular (P<0.05). Conclusions: In periodontitis patients with a history of orthodontic treatment, the height of the alveolar bone defect was specific to the tooth positions and sites. With the periodontitis stage changing, the most severe defect position changed in both maxillary and mandibular alveolar bones. It is recommended to pay more attention to the alteration of alveolar bone in periodontitis patients with a history of orthodontic treatment and give timely targeted treatment plans.","Yin, R; Zhao, H J; Li, Y C; Pan, Y P",Zhonghua kou qiang yi xue za zhi = Zhonghua kouqiang yixue zazhi = Chinese journal of stomatology,420,31

METHODS In this research, we simulated three aneurysms constructed from 3D digital subtraction angiography (DSA). The Enterprise, LVIS and the Pipeline device were virtually conformed to fit into the vessel lumen and placed across the aneurysm orifice. Computational fluid dynamics analysis was performed to compare the hemodynamic differences such as WSS, Velocity and Pressure among these stents. RESULTS Control referred to the unstented model, the percentage of hemodynamic changes were all compared to Control. A single LVIS stent caused more wall shear stress reduction than double Enterprise stents (39.96 vs. 30.51 %) and velocity (23.13 vs. 18.64 %). Significant reduction in wall shear stress (63.88 %) and velocity (46.05 %) was observed in the double-LVIS stents. A single Pipeline showed less reduction in WSS (51.08 %) and velocity (37.87 %) compared with double-LVIS stent. The double-Pipeline stents resulted in the most reduction in WSS (72.37 %) and velocity (54.26 %). Moreover, the pressure increased with minuscule extent after stenting, compared with the unstented model. CONCLUSIONS This is the first study analyzing flow modifications associated with LVIS stents. We found that the LVIS stent has certain hemodynamic effects on cerebral aneurysms: a single LVIS stent caused more flow reductions than the double-Enterprise stent but less than a Pipeline device. Nevertheless, the double-LVIS stent resulted in a better flow diverting effect than a Pipeline device.","Wang, Chao; Tian, Zhongbin; Liu, Jian; Jing, Linkai; Paliwal, Nikhil; Wang, Shengzhang; Zhang, Ying; Xiang, Jianping; Siddiqui, Adnan H; Meng, Hui; Yang, Xinjian",Journal of translational medicine,420,17

With disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) commonly used for RRMS accepted to be less efficacious once progression has occurred, treatment options for progressive forms of MS have been limited. Emergence of new DMTs in SPMS are changing the treatment landscape. There is a need to better understand current practice and the factors underlying it, to facilitate consensus on the overall management of SPMS and optimise diagnostic and management decisions. This survey project aimed to assess current practices for the diagnosis and management of patients with SPMS in the UK. METHODS Healthcare professionals (HCPs) involved in the management of patients with SPMS from geographically distributed MS neurology centres in the UK participated in face-to-face or telephone interviews, facilitated by a semi-structured questionnaire. The survey data were descriptively analysed using quantitative and qualitative methods. RESULTS Fifty-nine HCPs (41 neurologists, 15 specialist nurses and 3 'other'), from 59 UK centres took part. Sixty-one percent (n = 36/59) of respondents applied a specific definition for SPMS, although only 6% of these (2/36) used the Lublin 2014 phenotype criteria. Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score increase with an absence of relapses was an important consideration for SPMS diagnosis for 83% (n = 49/59) of respondents, and 36% (n = 21/59) considered this to be the most important piece of evidence that they look for when they suspect a patient is transitioning from RRMS to SPMS. The median (interquartile range [IQR]) estimated time between first suspicion and diagnosis of SPMS was 12 months (12-24 [n = 45/59]), with concerns over withdrawing DMTs and the psychological impact of a diagnosis on patients the most commonly reported reasons for reluctance to diagnose. Seventy-three percent (n = 43/59) of respondents followed specific guidelines for DMT management of patients transitioning from RRMS to SPMS, with most (86%, n = 37/43) using the NHS England algorithm. Ninety-eight percent (n = 58/59) use DMTs to treat patients they suspect may be transitioning to SPMS, and 51% (n = 30/59) reported using DMTs for newly diagnosed SPMS patients. Approximately 1 in 5 HCPs may consider continuing DMTs beyond EDSS 7.0 in certain circumstances. CONCLUSION The survey highlighted variation across the UK in SPMS definition, diagnosis and reported real-world management. Disparity in practice may result in unnecessary variations in treatment patterns and consequently outcomes. HCPs should be equipped to make timely and accurate decisions, which will be important in improving access to appropriate therapies for patients with SPMS.","Duddy, Martin; Wilkinson, Carmel; Medhurst, Steve; Rhys, Katherine",Multiple sclerosis and related disorders,420,5

The spike protein of virus SARS-CoV-2 is significant because of two reasons. Firstly, the spike protein of this virus binds with the human ACE2 (hACE2) receptor. Secondly, it has several antigenic regions that might be targeted for vaccine development. However, the structural analytical data for the spike protein of this virus is not available. MATERIALS AND METHODS Here, we performed an analysis to understand the structural two subunits of S glycoprotein (S gp) of SARS-CoV-2. Further, an analysis of secondary structure components and the tertiary structure analysis of RBD was carried out. We also performed molecular interaction analysis between S gp of this virus and hACE2 as well as between SARS-CoV S gp and hACE2 to compare the binding properties of these two viruses. RESULTS We noted that the molecular interaction of SARS-CoV-2 S gp and hACE2 form eleven hydrogen bonds, while the molecular interaction of SARS-CoV S gp and hACE2 receptor form seven hydrogen bonds, indicating that the molecular interaction of SARS-CoV-2 S gp and hACE2 receptor is more stable than SARS-CoV S gp and hACE2 receptor. The pairwise sequence alignment of S gp SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 shows several conserved residues of these two proteins. Besides, conserved pattern analysis of SARS-CoV-2 S gp and hACE2 revealed the presence of several highly conserved regions for these two proteins. The molecular dynamics simulation shows a stable interplay between SARS-CoV-2 S gp with the hACE2 receptor. CONCLUSIONS The present study might help determine the SARS-CoV-2 virus entrance mechanism into the human cell. Moreover, the understanding of the conserved regions may help in the process of therapeutic development from the infection of the deadly virus.","Chakraborty, C; Sharma, A R; Mallick, B; Bhattacharya, M; Sharma, G; Lee, S-S",European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,420,17

This loss of air-conditioning can be partially compensated for with the application of a heat and moisture exchanger (HME) over the tracheostomy. In vitro (International Organization for Standardization [ISO] standard 9360-2:2001) and in vivo measurements of the effects of an HME are complex and technically challenging. The aim of this study was to develop a simple method to measure the ex vivo HME performance comparable with previous in vitro and in vivo results. METHODS HMEs were weighed at the end of inspiration and at the end of expiration at different breathing volumes. Four HMEs (Atos Medical, Hörby, Sweden) with known in vivo humidity and in vitro water loss values were tested. The associations between weight change, volume, and absolute humidity were determined using both linear and non-linear mixed effects models. RESULTS The rating between the 4 HMEs by weighing correlated with previous intra-tracheal measurements (R(2) = 0.98), and the ISO standard (R(2) = 0.77). CONCLUSIONS Assessment of the weight change between end of inhalation and end of exhalation is a valid and simple method of measuring the water exchange performance of an HME.","van den Boer, Cindy; Muller, Sara H; Vincent, Andrew D; Züchner, Klaus; van den Brekel, Michiel W M; Hilgers, Frans J M",Respiratory care,420,1

METHODS Using Get With The Guidelines-Stroke, we identified 41 971 patients (AIS/COVID-19: 1143; AIS/no COVID-19: 40 828) with AIS hospitalized between February 4, 2020 and June 29, 2020, from 458 Get With The Guidelines-Stroke hospitals with at least one COVID-19 case and evaluated clinical characteristics, treatment patterns, and outcomes. RESULTS Compared with patients with AIS/no COVID-19, those with AIS/COVID-19 were younger, more likely to be non-Hispanic Black, Hispanic, or Asian, more likely to present with higher National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale scores, and had greater proportions of large vessel occlusions. Rates of thrombolysis and thrombectomy were similar between the groups. Door to computed tomography (median 55 [18-207] versus 35 [14-99] minutes, P<0.001), door to needle (59 [40-82] versus 46 [33-64] minutes, P<0.001), and door to endovascular therapy (114 [74-169] versus 90 [54-133] minutes, P=0.002) times were longer in the AIS/COVID-19 cohort. In adjusted models, patients with AIS/COVID-19 had decreased odds of discharge with modified Rankin Scale score of ≤2 (odds ratio, 0.65 [95% CI, 0.52-0.81], P<0.001) and increased odds of in-hospital mortality (odds ratio, 4.34 [95% CI, 3.48-5.40], P<0.001).

The aim is to evaluate the path model invariance across three generational cohorts, that is, generation X, generation Y, and generation Z. A sample of employees in service companies based in Canada was surveyed. We utilized a partial least square structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) approach, which included path analysis and multi-group analysis (MGA) to test proposed hypotheses. We found that job insecurity negatively predicted intrinsic motivation which positively related to job satisfaction. Job satisfaction influenced OCBs positively. Both intrinsic motivation and job satisfaction mediated the indirect effects of job insecurity onto OCBs. Generation X was more pronounced in their reaction to job insecurity than later generations given the strong negative effects on intrinsic motivation and hence on their job. However, generation Z employees followed their parents from generation X regarding engaging more in OCBs when they are satisfied with their job than generation Y. In general, therefore, it should come as no surprise that generation X employees' OCBs can be expected to plummet due to the elevated levels of job insecurity during pandemic times (e.g., COVID-19) more intensely than Generation Y. Clearly, with COVID-19 having led many organizations around the world to adopt virtual workplace environments, generational differences amongst employees have to be considered as a matter of crucial concern for these organizations.","Mahmoud, Ali B; Reisel, William D; Fuxman, Leonora; Mohr, Iris",Scandinavian journal of psychology,420,1

This capacity is mediated primarily through the production of IL-10. Here we demonstrate that the induction of a regulatory program in human B cells is dependent on a metabolic priming event driven by cholesterol metabolism. Synthesis of the metabolic intermediate geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP) is required to specifically drive IL-10 production, and to attenuate Th1 responses. Furthermore, GGPP-dependent protein modifications control signaling through PI3Kδ-AKT-GSK3, which in turn promote BLIMP1-dependent IL-10 production. Inherited gene mutations in cholesterol metabolism result in a severe autoinflammatory syndrome termed mevalonate kinase deficiency (MKD). Consistent with our findings, B cells from MKD patients induce poor IL-10 responses and are functionally impaired. Moreover, metabolic supplementation with GGPP is able to reverse this defect. Collectively, our data define cholesterol metabolism as an integral metabolic pathway for the optimal functioning of human IL-10 producing regulatory B cells.","Bibby, Jack A; Purvis, Harriet A; Hayday, Thomas; Chandra, Anita; Okkenhaug, Klaus; Rosenzweig, Sofia; Aksentijevich, Ivona; Wood, Michael; Lachmann, Helen J; Kemper, Claudia; Cope, Andrew P; Perucha, Esperanza",Nature communications,420,1

These viruses possess 3C or 3C-like proteases (3Cpro or 3CLpro, respectively), which contain a typical chymotrypsin-like fold and a catalytic triad (or dyad) with a Cys residue as a nucleophile. The conserved key sites of 3Cpro or 3CLpro may serve as attractive targets for the design of broad-spectrum antivirals for multiple viruses in the supercluster. We previously reported the structure-based design and synthesis of potent protease inhibitors of Norwalk virus (NV), a member of the Caliciviridae family. We report herein the broad-spectrum antiviral activities of three compounds possessing a common dipeptidyl residue with different warheads, i.e., an aldehyde (GC373), a bisulfite adduct (GC376), and an α-ketoamide (GC375), against viruses that belong to the supercluster. All compounds were highly effective against the majority of tested viruses, with half-maximal inhibitory concentrations in the high nanomolar or low micromolar range in enzyme- and/or cell-based assays and with high therapeutic indices. We also report the high-resolution X-ray cocrystal structures of NV 3CLpro-, poliovirus 3Cpro-, and transmissible gastroenteritis virus 3CLpro- GC376 inhibitor complexes, which show the compound covalently bound to a nucleophilic Cys residue in the catalytic site of the corresponding protease. We conclude that these compounds have the potential to be developed as antiviral therapeutics aimed at a single virus or multiple viruses in the picornavirus-like supercluster by targeting 3Cpro or 3CLpro.","Kim, Yunjeong; Lovell, Scott; Tiew, Kok-Chuan; Mandadapu, Sivakoteswara Rao; Alliston, Kevin R; Battaile, Kevin P; Groutas, William C; Chang, Kyeong-Ok",Journal of virology,420,19

Besides primary insomnia, comorbid sleep disorders are also common, accompanying different conditions. Considering the possible adverse effects of commonly used drugs to promote sleep, a nonpharmacologic approach should be preferred in most cases. Although generally considered first-line treatment, the nonpharmacologic approach is often underestimated by both patients and physicians. OBJECTIVE To provide primary care physicians an up-to-date approach to the nonpharmacologic treatment of insomnia. METHODS PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus databases were searched for relevant articles about the nonpharmacologic treatment of insomnia up to December 2020. We restricted our search only to articles written in English. MAIN MESSAGE Most patients presenting with sleep disorder symptoms can be effectively managed in the primary care setting. Primary care physicians may use pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic approaches, while the latter should be generally considered first-line treatment. A primary care physician may opt to refer the patient to a subspecialist for refractory cases. CONCLUSIONS This paper provides an overview of current recommendations and up-to-date evidence for the nonpharmacologic treatment of insomnia. This article emphasizes the importance of cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia, likewise, exercise and relaxation techniques. Complementary and alternative approaches are also covered, e.g., light therapy, aromatherapy, music therapy, and herbal medicine.","Hrehová, Laura; Mezian, Kamal",International journal of clinical practice,420,24

METHODS The data in this analysis were derived from a study of patients meeting DSM-IV-TR criteria for unipolar MDD, with a Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total score ≥26, presenting with two or three protocol-defined manic symptoms, and who were randomized to 6 weeks of double-blind treatment with either lurasidone 20-60 mg/d (n=109) or placebo (n=100). We defined ""irritability"" as a score ≥2 on both the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) irritability item (#5) and the disruptive-aggressive item (#9). Endpoint change in the MADRS and YMRS items 5 and 9 were analyzed using a mixed model for repeated measures for patients with and without irritability. RESULTS Some 20.7% of patients met the criteria for irritability.

The hallmark of pathophysiology in acute respiratory distress syndrome is the loss of the alveolar capillary permeability barrier and the presence of protein-rich edema fluid in the alveoli. This alteration in permeability and accumulation of fluid in the alveoli accompanies damage to the lung epithelium and vascular endothelium along with dysregulated inflammation and inappropriate activity of leukocytes and platelets. In addition, there is uncontrolled activation of coagulation along with suppression of fibrinolysis and loss of surfactant. These pathophysiological changes result in the clinical manifestations of acute respiratory distress syndrome, which include hypoxemia, radiographic opacities, decreased functional residual capacity, increased physiologic deadspace, and decreased lung compliance. Resolution of acute respiratory distress syndrome involves the migration of cells to the site of injury and re-establishment of the epithelium and endothelium with or without the development of fibrosis. Most of the data related to acute respiratory distress syndrome, however, originate from studies in adults or in mature animals with very few studies performed in children or juvenile animals. The lack of studies in children is particularly problematic because the lungs and immune system are still developing during childhood and consequently the pathophysiology of pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome may differ in significant ways from that seen in acute respiratory distress syndrome in adults. This article describes what is known of the pathophysiologic processes of pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome as we know it today while also presenting the much greater body of evidence on these processes as elucidated by adult and animal studies. It is also our expressed intent to generate enthusiasm for larger and more in-depth investigations of the mechanisms of disease and repair specific to children in the years to come.","Sapru, Anil; Flori, Heidi; Quasney, Michael W; Dahmer, Mary K",Pediatric critical care medicine : a journal of the Society of Critical Care Medicine and the World Federation of Pediatric Intensive and Critical Care Societies,420,31

METHODS A conditional probability model that predicts the probability of good outcome for patients with suspected large vessel occlusion was used to analyze the prehospital stroke triage in northwest Germany and produce catchment area maps. Transportation times were calculated during each hour of a weekday and a Sunday using Google Maps. For comparison, real DD transportation times from our CSC in Hamburg-Eppendorf (blinded for review) to a PSC in Lüneburg were prospectively recorded. RESULT On weekdays, the mothership catchment area was the largest (≥40,000 km2, 63%) except for a decrease during morning rush hours, when the DD catchment area was highest (30,879 km2, 48%). The DS catchment area was higher than the DD catchment area during the afternoon rush hours both during the week as well as on Sundays. CONCLUSION Our study showed a considerable impact of the diurnal variations in traffic rate and direction of travel on optimal stroke transportation.

Here, we identify a novel lncRNA from the X chromosome that we named lncRHOXF1 and which is abundantly expressed in trophectoderm and primitive endoderm cells of human blastocyst-stage embryos. lncRHOXF1 is a spliced and polyadenylated lncRNA about 1 kb in length that is found in both the nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments of in vitro differentiated human trophectoderm progenitor cells. Gain-of-function experiments in human embryonic stem cells, which normally lack lncRHOXF1 RNA, revealed that lncRHOXF1 reduced proliferation and favored cellular differentiation. lncRHOXF1 knockdown using small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) in human trophectoderm progenitors increased expression of viral response genes, including type I interferon. Sendai virus infection of human trophectoderm progenitor cells increased lncRHOXF1 RNA levels, and siRNA-mediated disruption of lncRHOXF1 during infection reduced the expression of viral response genes leading to higher virus replication. Thus, lncRHOXF1 RNA is the first example of a lncRNA that regulates the host response to viral infections in human placental progenitor cells, and we propose that it functions as a repressor of the viral response during early human development.","Penkala, Ian; Wang, Jianle; Syrett, Camille M; Goetzl, Laura; López, Carolina B; Anguera, Montserrat C",Molecular and cellular biology,420,9

Our main aim was to establish the expected duration of convalescence using preoperative recommendations to the patient and to identify the limiting factors for early (postoperative) resumption of normal activities after laparoscopic transabdominal preperitoneal inguinal herniorraphy (TAPP). METHODS This was a single-center prospective study. The intervention (the recommendation to the patient) was 1 day for convalescence. Several predefined factors were investigated for their influence on the duration of convalescence and the risk of early postoperative pain. Predefined, clinically justified reasons for not resuming normal activities within the first 3 postoperative days were also registered. RESULTS Between August 2009 and August 2010, 185 consecutive male patients with groin hernia were enrolled prospectively, and 162 patients were available for analysis. Convalescences from work and leisure activities were a median of 5 days (range, 1-40) and 3 days (range, 1-49), respectively (P = .34). Preoperative expectations of convalescence from work (the number of days) was the only factor to explain prolonged convalescence from work (P < .001). Postoperative, self-registered planned sick leave, and complaints of pain and fatigue were the dominant reasons for not resuming normal activities within the first 3 days after operation. Younger age was the only factor found to explain the intensity of postoperative pain (P < .001). CONCLUSION Postoperative convalescence (return to work or normal activities) was between 3 and 5 days after TAPP in patients who were counseled about a 1-day expected convalescence. The expectation of convalescence from work was an important reason for delayed convalescence beyond 1 day.","Tolver, Mette Astrup; Strandfelt, Pernille; Forsberg, Gert; Hjørne, Flemming Piil; Rosenberg, Jacob; Bisgaard, Thue",Surgery,420,16

A comprehensive database search was performed up to March 2021 for eligible studies comparing outcomes between EP-RARP versus TP-RARP. This study was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines and was registered with PROSPERO. A leave-one-out sensitivity analysis was performed to control for heterogeneity and risk of bias. A total of 16 studies were included with 3897 patients, including 2201 (56.5%) EP-RARPs and 1696 (43.5%) TP-RARPs. When compared to TP-RARP, EP-RARP offers faster operative time (MD - 14.4 min; 95% CI - 26.3, - 2.3), decreased length of post-operative stay (MD - 0.9 days, 95% CI - 1.3, - 0.4), and decreased rates of post-operative ileus (RR 0.2, 95% CI 0.1, 0.7) and inguinal hernia formation (RR 0.2, 95% CI 0.1, 0.5). There were no significant differences in total complications, estimated blood loss, positive surgical margins, or continence at 6 months. In this review, EP-RARP delivered similar oncological and functional outcomes, while also offering faster operative time, decreased length of post-operative stay, and decreased rates of post-operative ileus and inguinal hernia formation when compared to TP-RARP. These findings provide evidence-based data for surgical approach optimization and prompts future research to examine whether these findings hold true with recent advances in single-port RARP and outpatient RARP.","Uy, Michael; Cassim, Raees; Kim, Jaehoon; Hoogenes, Jen; Shayegan, Bobby; Matsumoto, Edward D",Journal of robotic surgery,420,1

Results show that internet and mobile upsurge the energy efficiency in the long run. However, internet and mobile have a reducing impact on carbon emissions in the long run. While FDI enhances energy efficiency and reduces carbon emissions inferring that environmental efficiency improves in the long run. The study suggests that policymakers must be aware of the impact of ICT on energy efficiency and environmental quality and regulate their manufacturers to enable the amalgamation of ICT into users' routines.","Zhao, Shufang; Hafeez, Muhammad; Faisal, Chaudhry Muhammad Nadeem",Environmental science and pollution research international,420,12

Upside-down stomach is prone to severe complications and therefore surgery is recommended even in asymptomatic patients. A 62-year-old male presented with frequent abdominal pain with nausea and vomiting that persisted for one year. The patient was obese with fatty liver and was treated medically for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) for 4 years. On upper gastrointestinal CT study a level-IV paraesophageal hernia was detected with upside-down stomach, and he was referred for elective surgery. Laparoscopic surgery included reduction of the stomach into the abdominal cavity followed by dissection of the paraesophageal membrane and hernia sac. The hiatal defect was closed using a wound closure device and nonabsorbable sutures. The defect closure was reinforced using Physiomesh tucked anteriorly and sutured posteriorly to the diaphragm. Follow-up was uneventful and the patient is free of complaints. The results of this surgical intervention support previous reports that laparoscopic repair with the use of biological mesh in the setting of large paraesophageal hernia should be favorably considered.","Sakran, Nasser; Nevo, Hadar; Dar, Ron; Raziel, Asnat; Hershko, Dan",Case reports in surgery,420,31

SARS-CoV infection causes robust downregulation of cellular ACE2 expression levels and it has been suggested that the SARS-CoV effect on ACE2 is involved in the severity of disease. We investigated whether cellular ACE2 downregulation occurs at optimal replication conditions of HCoV-NL63 infection. The expression of the homologue of ACE2, the ACE protein not used as a receptor by HCoV-NL63, was measured as a control. A specific decrease for ACE2 protein level was observed when HCoV-NL63 was cultured at 34 °C. Culturing the virus at the suboptimal temperature of 37 °C resulted in low replication of the virus and the effect on ACE2 expression was lost. We conclude that the decline of ACE2 expression is dependent on the efficiency of HCoV-NL63 replication, and that HCoV-NL63 and SARS-CoV both affect cellular ACE2 expression during infection.","Dijkman, Ronald; Jebbink, Maarten F; Deijs, Martin; Milewska, Aleksandra; Pyrc, Krzysztof; Buelow, Elena; van der Bijl, Anna; van der Hoek, Lia",The Journal of general virology,420,9

Inadequate weight loss, weight regain, and complications such as dumping syndrome are common reasons for revision. We report the 1-year outcomes of five patients who underwent laparoscopic conversion of RYGB to sleeve gastrectomy during surgical revision. METHODS Mean age was 38.8 ± 9.1 years. Mean BMI at primary surgery was 57.9 ± 8.1 kg/m(2) . Two patients were diabetic and sleep apneic. One was hypertensive. All patients underwent a RYGB as the primary weight loss procedure. Mean weight loss was 36.8 ± 8.6 kg (excess weight loss = 39.8 ± 14.9%) at 2 years. At the end of 5 years, these patients regained 10.9 ± 4.1 kg (31.5 ± 13.6% of excess weight loss). Primary indications for revision surgery were failure to lose weight, weight regain, and intractable dumping syndrome. Mean duration between primary and revision surgery was 6.2 ± 1.1 years. RYGB was converted to sleeve gastrectomy as a first stage in all cases. RESULTS Mean duration of revision surgery was 120.0 ± 15.5 min. Mean blood loss was 70 ± 50 mL. One year after revision surgery, a mean weight loss of 21.5 ± 10.5 kg was achieved (mean excess weight loss = 35.8 ± 8.8%). Two patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and the one with hypertension achieved remission. Dumping was resolved. There were no complications. CONCLUSION Laparoscopic conversion of RYGB to sleeve gastrectomy as a first stage may be considered as an additional option in the armamentarium of revision procedures after RYGB.","Lakdawala, Muffazal; Limas, Peter; Dhar, Shilpa; Remedios, Carlyne; Dhulla, Neha; Sood, Amit; Bhasker, Aparna Govil",Asian journal of endoscopic surgery,420,27

STUDY DESIGN Cross-sectional study. SETTING The study was conducted online by reviewing all accredited otolaryngology residency programs in the United States participating in the Electronic Residency Application Service. METHODS Otolaryngology residency programs were reviewed for social media presence on Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook. Social media posts were evaluated for virtual open houses and virtual subinternships. Residency websites and the Visiting Student Application Service were evaluated for the presence of virtual subinternships. All data were collected between September 5, 2020, and September 9, 2020. This study did not require approval from the University of Alabama at Birmingham Institutional Review Board for Human Use. RESULTS Among 118 otolaryngology residency programs, 74 (62.7%) participate on Instagram, 52 (44.1%) participate on Twitter, and 44 (37.3%) participate on Facebook. Fifty-one Instagram accounts, 20 Twitter accounts, and 4 Facebook accounts have been created during 2020. Forty-two (36%), 30 (25.4%), and 15 (13%) programs are promoting virtual open houses on Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook, respectively. Two programs on the Visiting Student Application Service offered virtual subinternships. Seven residency program websites offered virtual subinternships. Nine, 6, and 1 program offered virtual subinternships on Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook, respectively. CONCLUSION This study demonstrates that social media presence on Instagram and Twitter among otolaryngology residency programs has substantially grown in 2020 at a higher rate compared to previous years. These data suggest that otolaryngology residency programs are finding new ways to reach out to applicants amid an unprecedented type of application cycle due to the challenges presented by COVID-19. Many programs are advertising virtual open houses via social media platforms to connect with applicants, and a few programs are offering virtual subinternships to replace traditional subinternships.","DeAtkine, Andrew B; Grayson, Jessica W; Singh, Nikhi P; Nocera, Alexander P; Rais-Bahrami, Soroush; Greene, Benjamin J","Ear, nose, & throat journal",420,1

The aim of this study was to determine the concordance between 2 laboratories testing cobalt and chromium ion levels in patients with metal-on-metal bearings. METHODS Serum and whole blood samples from patients who had undergone metal-on-metal resurfacing or large-diameter total hip arthroplasty were tested for cobalt and chromium ions in laboratory A (a recognized laboratory) and laboratory B (tasked with testing clinical specimens). Laboratory A performed cobalt and chromium testing on whole blood, and laboratory B performed cobalt testing on whole blood and chromium testing on serum. RESULTS Samples from 104 patients were tested. Laboratory B reported lower whole blood cobalt levels than laboratory A. Furthermore, laboratory A reported that all patients had elevated whole blood cobalt ion levels compared to the normal reference values for the laboratory, whereas laboratory B reported that 46 patients (44.2%) had whole blood cobalt ion levels within the normal reference range for the laboratory. CONCLUSION This comparative study highlights the importance of using a single laboratory for metal ion testing, as values generated from different laboratories may not be directly comparable. With recent literature suggesting that whole blood cobalt levels as low as 1 ppb may be a predictor of adverse reactions to metal debris, accurate clinical measurement needs to be increasingly exact.","Saini, Raghav; Railton, Pam; Boyd, Jessica; Sadrzadeh, Hossein; Powell, James N",Canadian journal of surgery.

We reviewed our experience with three GJA techniques (hand-sewn (HSA), linear-stapled (LSA), and 25-mm circular-stapled (CSA)) to determine which anastomosis technique is associated with the lowest early (60-day) anastomotic complication rates. METHODS From November 2004 through December 2009, 882 consecutive patients underwent LRYGB using three GJA techniques: HSA, LSA, and CSA. All patients had a minimum of 2 months follow-up. Records were reviewed for postoperative gastrojejunostomy leak, stricture, and marginal ulcer, and these early complications were classified according to anastomosis technique. Multivariate analysis was performed to determine associations between complications and anastomosis technique. RESULTS Preoperative demographics, length of hospital stay, and postoperative follow-up did not differ between the three groups. The majority of patients underwent LSA (n = 514, 61.6%) followed by HSA (n = 180, 21.6%) and CSA (n = 140, 16.8%). Using multivariate analysis, there were no statistically significant differences in the rates of leak (LSA 1.0%, HSA 1.1%, CSA 0.0%, p = 0.480), stricture (LSA 6.0%, HSA 6.1%, CSA 4.3%, p = 0.657), or marginal ulcer (LSA 8.0%, HSA 7.7%, CSA 3.6%, p = 0.180). CONCLUSIONS The three techniques can be used safely with a low complication rate.

BACKGROUND Healthcare systems worldwide experienced an influx of COVID-19 patients, especially in critical care. COVID-19 patients are at risk of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Prone position ventilation is the standard of care for mechanically ventilated patients with moderate to severe ARDS. Prone maneuvers in and of itself are time-consuming and labor-intensive, posing additional risks to patients. APPROACH Our academic medical center developed a travel proning team to address the rapid increase in COVID-19 patients with ARDS necessitating prone positioning. EVALUATION Over a period of 30 days, 420 ICU patients were intubated, 131 had moderate to severe ARDS and underwent prone positioning. Patients were placed in prone position or returned to supine position more than 834 times over 38 days. At the highest point, 37 procedures were done in 24 hours.

Treatment indications have been expanding to include benign tumors as well. Specifically, the most prevalent indications to date have been in the liver (primary and metastatic disease, as well as benign tumors such as hemangiomas and adenomas), kidney (primarily renal cell carcinoma, but also benign tumors such as angiomyolipomas and oncocytomas), lung (primary and metastatic disease), and soft tissue and/or bone (primarily metastatic disease and osteoid osteomas). Each organ system has different underlying tissue characteristics, which can have profound effects on the resulting thermal changes and ablation zone. Understanding these issues is important for optimizing clinical results. In addition, thermal ablation technology has evolved rapidly during the past several decades, with substantial technical and procedural improvements that can help improve clinical outcomes and safety profiles. Staying up to date on these developments is challenging but critical because the physical properties underlying the different ablation modalities and the appropriate use of adjuncts will have a tremendous effect on treatment results. Ultimately, combining an understanding of the physical properties of the ablation modalities with an understanding of the thermal kinetics in tissue and using the most appropriate ablation modality for each patient are key to optimizing clinical outcomes.

Design, Setting, and Participants A matched case-control study of patients with proximal occlusion after stroke (intracranial internal carotid artery and/or middle cerebral artery M1 and/or M2) on computed tomographic angiography and baseline ischemic core greater than 50 mL on CTP at a tertiary care center from May 1, 2011, through October 31, 2015. Patients receiving ET and controls receiving medical treatment alone were matched for age, baseline ischemic core volume on CTP, and glucose levels. Baseline characteristics and outcomes were compared. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcome measure was the shift in the degree of disability among the treatment and control groups as measured by the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) (with scores ranging from 0 [fully independent] to 6 [dead]) at 90 days. Results Fifty-six patients were matched across 2 equally distributed groups (mean [SD] age, 62.25 [13.92] years for cases and 58.32 [14.79] years for controls; male, 13 cases [46%] and 14 controls [50%]). Endovascular therapy was significantly associated with a favorable shift in the overall distribution of 90-day mRS scores (odds ratio, 2.56; 95% CI, 2.50-8.47; P = .04), higher rates of independent outcomes (90-day mRS scores of 0-2, 25% vs 0%; P = .04), and smaller final infarct volumes (mean [SD], 87 [77] vs 242 [120] mL; P < .001). One control (4%) and 2 treatment patients (7%) developed a parenchymal hematoma type 2 (P > .99). The rates of hemicraniectomy (2 [7%] vs 6 [21%]; P = .10) and 90-day mortality (7 [29%] vs 11 [48%]; P = .75) were numerically lower in the intervention arm. Sensitivity analysis for patients with a baseline ischemic core greater than 70 mL (12 pairs) revealed a significant reduction in final infarct volumes (mean [SD], 110 [65] vs 319 [147] mL; P < .001) but only a nonsignificant improvement in the overall distribution of mRS scores favoring the treatment group (P = .18). All 11 patients older than 75 years had poor outcomes (mRS score >3) at 90 days. Conclusions and Relevance In properly selected patients, ET appears to benefit patients with large core and large mismatch profiles. Future prospective studies are warranted.","Rebello, Leticia C; Bouslama, Mehdi; Haussen, Diogo C; Dehkharghani, Seena; Grossberg, Jonathan A; Belagaje, Samir; Frankel, Michael R; Nogueira, Raul G",JAMA neurology,420,19

The purpose of the present article is to review several issues of viral infection in CAP in light of recent studies that included exhaustive evaluation of viruses. RECENT FINDINGS The introduction of better quality diagnostic tests, such as nucleic acid amplification techniques, have markedly improved our ability to detect multiple viral pathogens. With these diagnostic tools, a viral cause can be established in more than half of patients with CAP. Influenza A and respiratory syncytial virus are the most frequent causes of viral pneumonia followed by adenovirus, parainfluenza virus types 1, 2, and 3, and influenza. Although some clinical findings have been more frequent with viral infection, no clear-cut clinical signs have been shown to be predictive of specific cause. Of more interest is the association of mixed virus-bacteria infection with poorer severity scores found in some studies. The diagnostic approach with new techniques should be taken for a true estimation of viral infection in epidemiologic studies.Unfortunately, there are no other licensed antivirals or vaccines against the large variety of clinically important respiratory viruses with the notable exception of influenza. SUMMARY Given the high rate of viral infection in CAP and its probable association with poorer prognosis in mixed virus-bacteria infection, an extensive evaluation for virus in some populations seems appropriate. These findings can be useful for a more appropriate management of these patients.","Marcos, Maria Angeles; Esperatti, Mariano; Torres, Antoni",Current opinion in infectious diseases,420,31

METHODS A survey was conducted among 549 randomly selected hospital employees in Beijing, China, concerning the psychological impact of the 2003 SARS outbreak. Subjects were assessed on sociodemographic factors and types of exposure to the outbreak, and on symptoms of post-traumatic stress (PTS), alcohol abuse/dependence and depression. RESULTS Current alcohol abuse/dependence symptom counts 3 years after the outbreak were positively associated with having been quarantined, or worked in high-risk locations such as SARS wards, during the outbreak. However, having had family members or friends contract, SARS was not related to alcohol abuse/dependence symptom count. Symptoms of PTS and of depression, and having used drinking as a coping method, were also significantly associated with increased alcohol abuse/dependence symptoms. The relationship between outbreak exposure and alcohol abuse/dependence symptom count remained significant even when sociodemographic and other factors were controlled for. When the intrusion, avoidance and hyperarousal PTS symptom clusters were entered into the model, hyperarousal was found to be significantly associated with alcohol abuse/dependence symptoms. CONCLUSIONS Exposure to an outbreak of a severe infectious disease can, like other disaster exposures, lead not only to PTSD but also to other psychiatric conditions, such as alcohol abuse/dependence. The findings will help policy makers and health professionals to better prepare for potential outbreaks of diseases such as SARS or avian flu.","Wu, Ping; Liu, Xinhua; Fang, Yunyun; Fan, Bin; Fuller, Cordelia J; Guan, Zhiqiang; Yao, Zhongling; Kong, Junhui; Lu, Jin; Litvak, Iva J",Alcohol and alcoholism,420,26

Coupled with this procedure, we performed single-incision laparoscopic surgery for left colon mobilization. This is a description of our initial experience with the combined approach. METHODS Patients with distal or mid rectal cancer were included. The operation was performed by 2 teams: one team performed the single-incision mobilization of the left colon via the right lower quadrant ileostomy site, and the other team performed the total mesorectal excision with a transanal platform. RESULTS During the study period, 10 patients (5 men) with cancer of the rectum underwent the surgery. The mean age was 62.2 ± 11.1 years, and the mean body mass index was 23.4 ± 3.2 kg/m(2). The tumor's mean distance from the anal verge was 5.1 ± 2.5 cm. The median operating time was 247.5 minutes (range, 188-462 minutes). The mean estimated blood loss was 124 ± 126 mL (range, 10-188 mL). Conversion to multiport laparoscopy was needed in one case (10%). Postoperative pain, as reflected by the pain score, was minimal. The mean number of lymph nodes harvested was 15.6 ± 3.8. All specimens had clear distal and circumferential radial margins. The overall complication rate was 10%. CONCLUSION Our experience showed transanal total mesorectal excision with single-incision laparoscopy to be a feasible option for rectal cancer. Patients reported minimal postoperative pain. Further studies on the long-term outcome are warranted.","Foo, Dominic Chi-Chung; Choi, Hok Kwok; Wei, Rockson; Yip, Jeremy; Law, Wai Lun",JSLS : Journal of the Society of Laparoendoscopic Surgeons,420,1

However, viruses clearly differ in relative burden, both in terms of morbidity and mortality (virulence) incurred and the capacity for sustained human-to-human transmission. Extending previously published databases, we delineated host and viral traits predictive of human mortality associated with viral spillover, viral capacity to transmit between humans following spillover and the probability of a given virus being zoonotic. We demonstrate that increasing host phylogenetic distance from humans positively correlates with human mortality but negatively correlates with human transmissibility, suggesting that the virulence induced by viruses emerging from hosts at high phylogenetic distance may limit capacity for human transmission. Our key result is that hosts most closely related to humans harbour zoonoses of lower impact in terms of morbidity and mortality, while the most distantly related hosts-in particular, order Chiroptera (bats)-harbour highly virulent zoonoses with a lower capacity for endemic establishment in human hosts. As a whole, our results emphasize the importance of understanding how zoonoses manifest in the human population and also highlight potential risks associated with multi-host transmission chains in spillover.

These strictures almost exclusively occur in the cervical esophagus within the field of radiation. For some patients, identification of the esophageal lumen for antegrade dilation of these strictures can be a challenge, and creation of a false lumen can occur during attempts at dilation. METHODS We report a method of identifying the esophageal lumen using retrograde esophagoscopy through an existing gastrostomy, thereby allowing confident dilation of an esophageal stricture. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION The esophagoscope is used to pass a guide wire from below the stricture, and this guide wire is used for bougie dilation of the stricture. Following retrograde dilation, we often place a modified feeding tube to preserve the lumen for future dilation attempts. CONCLUSION This method can be used to safely place a guide wire for dilation in patients who have a difficult cervical esophageal stricture and an established gastrostomy.","Langerman, Alexander; Stenson, Kerstin M; Ferguson, Mark K",Journal of gastrointestinal surgery : official journal of the Society for Surgery of the Alimentary Tract,420,1

Authors of studies have linked physical activity and fitness with brain regions and networks integral to cognitive function and scholastic performance in children and adolescents but findings have not been synthesized. OBJECTIVE To conduct a systematic review of studies in which the impact of physical activity on brain structure and function in children and adolescents is examined. DATA SOURCES Six electronic databases (PubMed, PsychINFO, Scopus, Ovid Medline, SportDiscus, and Embase) were systematically searched for experimental studies published between 2002 and March 1, 2019. STUDY SELECTION Two reviewers independently screened studies for inclusion according to predetermined criteria. DATA EXTRACTION Two reviewers independently extracted data for key variables and synthesized findings qualitatively. RESULTS Nine studies were included (task-based functional MRI [n = 4], diffusion tensor imaging [n = 3], arterial spin labeling [n = 1], and resting-state functional MRI [n = 1]) in which results for 5 distinct and 4 similar study samples aged 8.7 ± 0.6 to 10.2 ± 1.0 years and typically of relatively low socioeconomic status were reported. Effects were reported for 12 regions, including frontal lobe (n = 3), parietal lobe (n = 3), anterior cingulate cortex (n = 2), hippocampus (n = 1), and several white matter tracts and functional networks. LIMITATIONS Findings need to be interpreted with caution as quantitative syntheses were not possible because of study heterogeneity. CONCLUSIONS There is evidence from randomized controlled trials that participation in physical activity may modify white matter integrity and activation of regions key to cognitive processes.

The overall genomic organization of the camel MHC region follows a general pattern observed in other mammalian species and individual MHC loci appear to be well conserved. Selected MHC class I genes B-67 and BL3-7 exhibited unexpectedly low variability, even when compared to other camel MHC class I related genes MR1 and MICA. Interspecific SNP and allele sharing are relatively common, and frequencies of heterozygotes are usually low. Such a low variation in a genomic region generally considered as one of the most polymorphic in vertebrate genomes is unusual. Evolutionary relationships between MHC class I related genes and their counterparts from other species seem to be rather complex. Often, they do not follow the general evolutionary history of the species concerned. Close evolutionary relationships of individual MHC class I loci between camels, humans and dogs were observed. Based on the results of this study and on our data on MHC class II genes, the extent and the pattern of polymorphism of the MHC region of Old World camelids differed from most mammalian groups studied so far. Camels thus seem to be an important model for our understanding of the role of genetic diversity in immune functions, especially in the context of unique features of their immunoglobulin and T-cell receptor genes.","Plasil, Martin; Wijkmark, Sofia; Elbers, Jean P; Oppelt, Jan; Burger, Pamela A; Horin, Petr",HLA,420,31

With the increased availability of secondary structures in recent years, we update the RAG resource and provide various improvements for analyzing RNA structures. DESCRIPTION Our RAG update includes a new supervised clustering algorithm that can suggest RNA motifs that may be ""RNA-like"". We use this utility to describe RNA motifs as three classes: existing, RNA-like, and non-RNA-like. This produces 126 tree and 16,658 dual graphs as candidate RNA-like topologies using the supervised clustering algorithm with existing RNAs serving as the training data. A comparison of this clustering approach to an earlier method shows considerable improvements. Additional RAG features include greatly expanded search capabilities, an interface to better utilize the benefits of relational database, and improvements to several of the utilities such as directed/labeled graphs and a subgraph search program. CONCLUSIONS The RAG updates presented here augment the database's intended function - stimulating the search for novel RNA functionality - by classifying available motifs, suggesting new motifs for design, and allowing for more specific searches for specific topologies. The updated RAG web resource offers users a graph-based tool for exploring available RNA motifs and suggesting new RNAs for design.","Izzo, Joseph A; Kim, Namhee; Elmetwaly, Shereef; Schlick, Tamar",BMC bioinformatics,420,1

Thus, the electron-phonon coupling in the deformable SBUs affords intrinsic white-light emission and moderately high external photoluminescence quantum efficiencies of 12-15%, superior to our previously reported MOFs.

If immunity wanes quickly, millions of people may be at risk for reinfection after recovery from COVID-19. However, memory B cells (MBC) could provide durable humoral immunity even if serum neutralizing antibody titers decline. We performed multi-dimensional flow cytometric analysis of S protein receptor binding domain (S-RBD)-specific MBC in cohorts of ambulatory COVID-19 patients with mild disease (n = 7), and hospitalized patients with moderate to severe disease (n = 7), at a median of 54 (39-104) days after symptom onset. We detected S-RBD-specific class-switched MBC in 13 of 14 participants, failing only in the individual with lowest plasma levels of anti-S-RBD IgG and neutralizing antibodies. Resting MBC (rMBC) made up the largest proportion of S-RBD-specific MBC in both cohorts. FCRL5, a marker of functional memory on rMBC, was more dramatically upregulated on S-RBD-specific rMBC after mild infection than after severe infection. These data indicate that most SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals develop S-RBD-specific, class-switched rMBC that resemble germinal center-derived B cells induced by effective vaccination against other pathogens, providing evidence for durable B cell-mediated immunity against SARS-CoV-2 after mild or severe disease.","Ogega, Clinton O; Skinner, Nicole E; Blair, Paul W; Park, Han-Sol; Littlefield, Kirsten; Ganesan, Abhinaya; Dhakal, Santosh; Ladiwala, Pranay; Antar, Annukka Ar; Ray, Stuart C; Betenbaugh, Michael J; Pekosz, Andrew; Klein, Sabra L; Manabe, Yukari C; Cox, Andrea L; Bailey, Justin R",The Journal of clinical investigation,420,16

Up to our knowledge this is the first study assessing the safety of SIPES cholecystectomy in children with sickle cell disease (SCD) done by surgical residents. Aims: To determine the feasibility, safety, and expediency of SIPES cholecystectomy in children with SCD performed by surgical residents. Materials and Methods: Retrospective study of all SIPES cholecystectomies performed in our unit from April 1, 2011 to March 31, 2018. We compared the outcome of SIPES cholecystectomy done by fellows and residents. SIPES Covidien 5-12 mm port was inserted through umbilicus. Long 50 cm laparoscope, straight regular instruments, and transabdominal gallbladder traction suture were used in all patients. The cystic duct and artery were identified and divided. The gallbladder is then dissected off the liver and extracted from the abdomen through the port. Results: Forty-three SCD patients underwent SIPES cholecystectomy for 7 years. Mean HbS was 37.56%. Mean age was 10 years. Twenty-four cases (56%) and 19 (44%) were performed by 8 fellows and 10 residents, respectively. Nine other procedures were done simultaneously with cholecystectomy and were excluded from the mean operative time (MOT). The MOT for all cases was 85 minutes, 78 minutes for fellows and 94 minutes for residents (P value is <.001). One extra port was inserted in 2 patients at the beginning of the series. Conclusion: SIPES cholecystectomy in children with SCD is safe and feasible if done by residents under supervision. Stepwise training is essential in this challenging surgery.

Urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) has been related to stroke and other atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases. However, there is limited information about the association of ACR and early impairment of cerebral vessels. Hereby we assessed the association of ICAS with ACR, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), and dipstick proteinuria in a stroke-free hypertensive population. We included 889 hypertension patients aged ≥60 years without prior stroke. Computed tomography angiography was performed to detect ICAS. ACR and dipstick proteinuria were tested from a random spot urine. eGFR was calculated using the CKD-EPI equation. Logistic regression was carried out to analyze the association of renal function with the presence, extent, and lesion number of ICAS. Elevated ACR (≥30 mg/g) was associated with ICAS after adjustment of confounding factors (odds ratio (OR) = 1.66, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.21-2.29). Patients with elevated ACR were more prone to develop moderate-to-severe stenosis (OR = 1.57, 95% CI: 1.16-2.14) and more lesions (OR = 1.58, 95% CI: 1.16-2.15). Such association was independent of previously identified cardiovascular risk factors. No significant association was detected between ICAS and dipstick proteinuria or eGFR after adjustment.

Primate lentiviruses (HIV/SIV) require the T cell receptor CD4 to enter into target cells. By surveying the sequence and function of CD4 in 50 chimpanzee individuals, we find that all chimpanzee CD4 alleles encode a fixed, chimpanzee-specific substitution (34T) that creates a glycosylation site on the virus binding surface of the CD4 receptor. Additionally, a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) has arisen in chimpanzee CD4 (68T) that creates a second glycosylation site on the same virus-binding interface. This substitution is not yet fixed, but instead alleles containing this SNP are still circulating within chimpanzee populations. Thus, all allelic versions of chimpanzee CD4 are singly glycosylated at the virus binding surface, and some allelic versions are doubly glycosylated. Doubly glycosylated forms of chimpanzee CD4 reduce HIV-1 and SIVcpz infection by as much as two orders of magnitude. Full restoration of virus infection in cells bearing chimpanzee CD4 requires reversion of both threonines at sites 34 and 68, destroying both of the glycosylation sites, suggesting that the effects of the glycans are additive. Differentially glycosylated CD4 receptors were biochemically purified and used in neutralization assays and microscale thermophoresis to show that the glycans on chimpanzee CD4 reduce binding affinity with the lentiviral surface glycoprotein, Env. These glycans create a shield that protects CD4 from being engaged by viruses, demonstrating a powerful form of host resistance against deadly primate lentiviruses.","Warren, Cody J; Meyerson, Nicholas R; Stabell, Alex C; Fattor, Will T; Wilkerson, Gregory K; Sawyer, Sara L",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,420,33

In this narrative review, we develop an analytical framework to examine mask usage, synthesizing the relevant literature to inform multiple areas: population impact, transmission characteristics, source control, wearer protection, sociological considerations, and implementation considerations. A primary route of transmission of COVID-19 is via respiratory particles, and it is known to be transmissible from presymptomatic, paucisymptomatic, and asymptomatic individuals. Reducing disease spread requires two things: limiting contacts of infected individuals via physical distancing and other measures and reducing the transmission probability per contact. The preponderance of evidence indicates that mask wearing reduces transmissibility per contact by reducing transmission of infected respiratory particles in both laboratory and clinical contexts. Public mask wearing is most effective at reducing spread of the virus when compliance is high. Given the current shortages of medical masks, we recommend the adoption of public cloth mask wearing, as an effective form of source control, in conjunction with existing hygiene, distancing, and contact tracing strategies. Because many respiratory particles become smaller due to evaporation, we recommend increasing focus on a previously overlooked aspect of mask usage: mask wearing by infectious people (""source control"") with benefits at the population level, rather than only mask wearing by susceptible people, such as health care workers, with focus on individual outcomes. We recommend that public officials and governments strongly encourage the use of widespread face masks in public, including the use of appropriate regulation.","Howard, Jeremy; Huang, Austin; Li, Zhiyuan; Tufekci, Zeynep; Zdimal, Vladimir; van der Westhuizen, Helene-Mari; von Delft, Arne; Price, Amy; Fridman, Lex; Tang, Lei-Han; Tang, Viola; Watson, Gregory L; Bax, Christina E; Shaikh, Reshama; Questier, Frederik; Hernandez, Danny; Chu, Larry F; Ramirez, Christina M; Rimoin, Anne W",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,420,27

METHODS Infection control guidelines and recommendations from international ophthalmological bodies are reviewed and discussed. The measures at our hospital were drawn up as per international and local health authorities' guidelines and implemented with the collaboration of doctors, nurses and administrative staff. RESULTS The aims of our infection control measures are to 1) minimize cross-infection within the hospital; 2) protect and support hospital staff; 3) ensure environmental control. To minimize the risk of cross-infection, outpatient attendance and elective surgery have been reduced by 40%, and general anesthesia procedures were reduced by 90%. Patients entering the hospital are screened for fever, travel history, contact and cluster history, and COVID-19 related symptoms. To protect and support hospital staff, we ensure provision of adequate personal protective equipment (PPE) and provide clear guidelines on the level of PPE needed, depending on the clinical situation. Other protective measures include provision of work uniforms, easy access to alcohol-based hand rub, opening new lunch areas, implementation of self-monitoring and self-reporting systems, and communication via online education and updates. Finally, environmental control is achieved by ensuring regular disinfection of the hospital premise, enhancing ventilation, and usage of disposable ophthalmic instruments. CONCLUSION Our multi-pronged approach to infection control is, so far, successful in minimizing infection risks, while allowing the maintenance of essential ophthalmic services.","Cheung, Stephanie S L; Wong, Cherie Y K; Chan, Jason C K; Chan, Carmen K M; Lam, N M; Yuen, Hunter K L; Wong, Victoria W Y; Tsang, Chi Wai; Tham, Clement C Y",International journal of ophthalmology,420,5

The cross-sectional study aimed to investigate the status of dental caries and associated factors in Tibetan adults. METHODS Participants aged 35-44, 55-64 and 65-74 years were selected. Decayed, missing, and filled tooth (DMFT), decayed and filled root (DF-Root) and root canal index (RCI) were used to evaluate dental caries. Questionnaire survey on demographic information, socioeconomic status, dietary habits, and oral health knowledge and behavior was conducted. Mann-Whitney U test, logistic regression were used for the statistical analyses. RESULTS A total of 446 participants were enrolled in the survey. Of these: 222 (49.8%) were females, 224 (50.2%) were males; 149 (33.4%), 151 (33.9%), 146 (32.7%) were aged 35-44, 55-64 and 65-74 years respectively. The mean DMFT (SD) was 7.62 (4.84), 12.46 (8.16), and 21.38 (8.93). The filling rate was very low in all age groups (1.77%, 0.98%, 0.45%). The mean DF-Root (SD) was 0.50 (1.04), 1.04 (2.02), 1.32 (2.14), respectively. Root caries index was 42.27, 44.78 and 57.60%. Older age (65-74 age group) was positively associated with crown caries (odds ratio = 31.20, 95% confidence interval: 10.70-90.96). College degree and above and brushing teeth at least once a day were negatively associated with crown caries (odds ratio = 0.28, 95% confidence interval: 0.09-0.89; odds ratio = 0.39, 95% confidence interval: 0.21-0.72, respectively). Rural area, high income level and brushing teeth at least once a day were negatively and tooth with attachment loss was positively associated with root caries. CONCLUSIONS The status of dental caries in the adults in Tibet is severe and the treatment rate is very low. The study suggests a correlation between crown caries and the variables age, level of education and frequency of tooth brushing; correlation between root caries and residence, income level, frequency of tooth brushing and exposed root surfaces. These findings could be as reference to develop community based interventions to reduce the prevalence of caries in Tibet.","Guan, Lingxia; Guo, Jing; Ban, Jinghao; Li, Gang; Tong, Juan; Chuan, Aiyun; Tian, Tian; Han, Bing; Xuan, Kun; Wang, Shengchao",BMC oral health,420,1

The objective of this study was to assess the effectiveness of an alternate intervention, LSVT-BIG (signifying big movements), to improve functional mobility. DESIGN Systematic review with meta-analysis of randomized trials. DATA SOURCES Medline, Embase, CINAHL, AgeLine, Scopus and Cochrane Library were searched from inception to September 2017 using multiple search terms related to Parkinson's disease and LSVT-BIG. REVIEW METHOD Two researchers searched the literature for studies of the LSVT-BIG intervention of 16 sessions, delivered by a certified instructor over four weeks, to any other intervention. Outcomes related to functional ability were included. Study quality was appraised using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. RESULTS Four studies were included, reporting on three randomized trials of 84 participants with mild Parkinson's disease. Compared to physiotherapy exercises, or a shorter training protocol, there was a significant improvement in motor function assessed with the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale part III (mean difference = -3.20, 95% confidence interval = -5.18 to -1.23) and a trend towards faster Timed Up and Go performance (mean difference = -0.47, 95% confidence interval = -0.99 to 0.06) and 10-metre walk test (mean difference = -0.53, 95% confidence interval = -1.07 to 0.01). CONCLUSION Compared to shorter format LSVT-BIG or general exercise, LSVT-BIG was more effective at improving motor function. This provides preliminary, moderate quality evidence that amplitude-oriented training is effective in reducing motor impairments for people with mild Parkinson's disease.","McDonnell, Michelle N; Rischbieth, Briony; Schammer, Tenille T; Seaforth, Chantel; Shaw, Alex J; Phillips, Anna C",Clinical rehabilitation,420,1

This process is often hijacked by tumors and pathogens for immune evasion. Because options for restoring HLA-I antigen presentation are limited, we aimed to identify druggable HLA-I pathway targets. Using iterative genome-wide screens, we uncovered that the cell surface glycosphingolipid (GSL) repertoire determines effective HLA-I antigen presentation. We show that absence of the protease SPPL3 augmented B3GNT5 enzyme activity, resulting in upregulation of surface neolacto-series GSLs. These GSLs sterically impeded antibody and receptor interactions with HLA-I and diminished CD8+ T cell activation. Furthermore, a disturbed SPPL3-B3GNT5 pathway in glioma correlated with decreased patient survival. We show that the immunomodulatory effect could be reversed through GSL synthesis inhibition using clinically approved drugs. Overall, our study identifies a GSL signature that inhibits immune recognition and represents a potential therapeutic target in cancer, infection, and autoimmunity.","Jongsma, Marlieke L M; de Waard, Antonius A; Raaben, Matthijs; Zhang, Tao; Cabukusta, Birol; Platzer, René; Blomen, Vincent A; Xagara, Anastasia; Verkerk, Tamara; Bliss, Sophie; Kong, Xiangrui; Gerke, Carolin; Janssen, Lennert; Stickel, Elmer; Holst, Stephanie; Plomp, Rosina; Mulder, Arend; Ferrone, Soldano; Claas, Frans H J; Heemskerk, Mirjam H M; Griffioen, Marieke; Halenius, Anne; Overkleeft, Hermen; Huppa, Johannes B; Wuhrer, Manfred; Brummelkamp, Thijn R; Neefjes, Jacques; Spaapen, Robbert M",Immunity,420,1

However, exactly how flexible is our sense of body ownership? In this study, we address this issue by investigating the following question: is it possible that one may have the illusory experience of owning four hands? Under visual manipulation, the participant adopted the experimenter's first-person perspective (1PP) as if it was his/her own. Sitting face to face, the participant saw four hands-the experimenter's two hands from the adopted 1PP together with the subject's own two hands from the adopted third-person perspective (3PP). We found that: (1) the four-hand illusion did not occur in the passive four-hand condition. (2) In the active four-hand condition, the participants tapped their index fingers, imitated by the experimenter. When tactile stimulations were not provided, the key illusion was not induced, either. (3) Strikingly, once all four hands began to act with the same pattern and received synchronous tactile stimulations at the same time, many participants felt as if they had two more hands. These results show that the sense of body ownership is much more flexible than most researchers have suggested.","Chen, Wen-Yeo; Huang, Hsu-Chia; Lee, Yen-Tung; Liang, Caleb",Scientific reports,420,16

We identified an IFN-γ-inducible EV-A71 cellular entry factor, human tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase (hWARS), using genome-wide RNAi library screening. The importance of hWARS in mediating virus entry and infectivity was confirmed by virus attachment, in vitro pulldown, antibody/antigen blocking, and CRISPR/Cas9-mediated deletion. Hyperexpression and plasma membrane translocation of hWARS were observed in IFN-γ-treated semipermissive (human neuronal NT2) and cDNA-transfected nonpermissive (mouse fibroblast L929) cells, resulting in their sensitization to EV-A71 infection. Our hWARS-transduced mouse infection model showed pathological changes similar to those seen in patients with severe EV-A71 infection. Expression of hWARS is also required for productive infection by other human enteroviruses, including the clinically important coxsackievirus A16 (CV-A16) and EV-D68. This is the first report to our knowledge on the discovery of an entry factor, hWARS, that can be induced by IFN-γ for EV-A71 infection. Given that we detected high levels of IFN-γ in patients with severe EV-A71 infection, our findings extend the knowledge of the pathogenicity of EV-A71 in relation to entry factor expression upon IFN-γ stimulation and the therapeutic options for treating severe EV-A71-associated complications.","Yeung, Man Lung; Jia, Lilong; Yip, Cyril C Y; Chan, Jasper F W; Teng, Jade L L; Chan, Kwok-Hung; Cai, Jian-Piao; Zhang, Chaoyu; Zhang, Anna J; Wong, Wan-Man; Kok, Kin-Hang; Lau, Susanna K P; Woo, Patrick C Y; Lo, Janice Y C; Jin, Dong-Yan; Shih, Shin-Ru; Yuen, Kwok-Yung",The Journal of clinical investigation,420,31

This secondary nucleation process can be many orders of magnitude faster than primary nucleation. In the case of amyloid fibrils associated with Alzheimer's disease, this process leads to the multiplication and propagation of aggregates, whereby short-lived oligomeric intermediates cause neurotoxicity. Understanding the catalytic activity is a fundamental goal in elucidating the molecular mechanisms of Alzheimer's and associated diseases. Here we explore the role of fibril structure and hydrophobicity by asking whether the V18, A21, V40, and A42 side chains which are exposed on the Aβ42 fibril surface as continuous hydrophobic patches play a role in secondary nucleation. Single, double, and quadruple serine substitutions were made. Kinetic analyses of aggregation data at multiple monomer concentrations reveal that all seven mutants retain the dominance of secondary nucleation as the main mechanism of fibril proliferation. This finding highlights the generality of secondary nucleation and its independence of the detailed molecular structure. Cryo-electron micrographs reveal that the V18S substitution causes fibrils to adopt a distinct morphology with longer twist distance than variants lacking this substitution. Self- and cross-seeding data show that surface catalysis is only efficient between peptides of identical morphology, indicating a templating role of secondary nucleation with structural conversion at the fibril surface. Our findings thus provide clear evidence that the propagation of amyloid fibril strains is possible even in systems dominated by secondary nucleation rather than fragmentation.","Thacker, Dev; Sanagavarapu, Kalyani; Frohm, Birgitta; Meisl, Georg; Knowles, Tuomas P J; Linse, Sara",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,420,1

The palliative care consult service at Bellevue Hospital, therefore, adjusted rapidly to meet the increased needs of our patients and colleagues. Objectives: To describe the dynamic palliative care needs during a public hospital's COVID-19 surge, including a process to utilize nonpalliative care trained volunteers to meet the increased demand for inpatient palliative care consults. Confronting the Challenge: Given the flexibility needed during the surge response, the consult team focused on three key elements to meet the system's needs: surge staffing, support, and scale. The consult service expanded into three individual teams to accommodate daily rounds with the medical intensive care and general medicine teams. Nonpalliative care trained community volunteers and internally redeployed providers received targeted training in advanced care planning and were subsequently embedded within the three teams, each led by a palliative care provider. A total of 12 volunteers joined the palliative care team. During eight weeks of the surge, the service cared for a total of 276 patients, 111 of whom were seen by volunteers. Over 50% of the palliative care patients had limited English proficiency. Conclusion: The inpatient palliative care consult service structure adapted rapidly in response to the increased need for advanced care planning and support throughout the hospital during the COVID-19 surge. Focusing on three key areas of surge staffing, support, and scale resulted in expert coordination with the hospital and system level leadership, efficient training of volunteer providers, and frequent re-evaluation of response strategies. These elements were vital in allowing the palliative care team to harness the expertise of various volunteer providers to meet the increased demands of a safety net hospital during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Xu, Yijie; Zhang, Luyi K; Smeltz, Robert L; Cohen, Susan E",Journal of palliative medicine,420,31

The ability of a cast to maintain a desired shape is termed moldability. Clinicians use plaster, fiberglass, and soft casts. To our knowledge the biomechanical molding characteristics of these 3 materials have never been reported. We hypothesized that moldability of plaster would be better than fiberglass and fiberglass would be better than soft cast. METHODS We compared 12.7 cm wide casts of plaster, fiberglass, and soft cast. Casts were 5 layers thick, prepared in 40°C water, and placed over 2 layers of cotton padding on 5.1 cm and 15.2 cm diameter foam cylinders. A loading device simulated loads applied by clinicians when molding casts for 4 conditions: clubfoot (thumb-shaped 50 N load on 5.1 cm model), DDH (thumb-shaped 100 N load on 15.2 cm model), forearm fracture (palm-shaped 50 N load on 5.1 cm model), and femur fracture (palm-shaped 100 N load on 15.2 cm model). The loading device applied molding for 7 minutes. Five casts of each material were made for each model. Casts were removed, photographed, and the area of maximal deformation was compared with an unmolded cast. A large area of maximal deformation meant that the deformation was spread out over a large area, less precise molding. RESULTS In the clubfoot model, plaster was more precise than fiberglass (P=0.002) and soft cast (P<0.0001). In the DDH model, plaster was more precise than fiberglass (P<0.0001) and soft cast (P<0.0001) and fiberglass was more precise than soft cast (P<0.0001).In the femur fracture model, plaster was more precise than fiberglass (P=0.001) and soft cast (P=0.001). CONCLUSIONS The moldability of plaster is better than fiberglass and soft cast and fiberglass is better than soft cast. CLINICAL RELEVANCE If precise molding is required, plaster has the best moldability. In cases not requiring precise molding, fiberglass and soft cast are lightweight, waterproof, and available in child-friendly colors.","Daines, Steven B; Aronsson, David D; Beynnon, Bruce D; Sturnick, Daniel R; Lisle, Jennifer W; Naud, Shelly",Journal of pediatric orthopedics,420,24

To what extent are general vaccine hesitancy and key demographics associated with acceptability of vaccines in development? DESIGN Cross-sectional online survey administered through GfK's KnowledgePanel in 2015. Analysis completed in 2020. SUBJECTS Nationally representative sample of Black and White American adults (n = 1,643). MEASURES Willingness to accept a novel vaccine was measured on a 4-point Likert scale.

Using this approach, we elaborate on the factors that promote clustering of harms from tobacco with harms from COVID-19. These include the worsening of psychological distress, a potential increase in smoking behaviour, greater exposure to second-hand smoke and less access to smoking cessation services. Then, we offer mitigation strategies to protect disadvantaged groups from tobacco-related harm during and following the COVID-19 pandemic. These strategies include affordable smoking cessation services, a proactive approach for smoking treatment using information technology, opportunistic screening and treatment of tobacco dependence among individuals presenting for COVID-19 vaccination, policy interventions for universal coverage of cessation pharmacotherapy, comprehensive smoke-free policies and regulation of tobacco retail density.

We proceeded to a salvage strategy with rituximab and caplacizumab that was rapidly effective to resolve symptoms and hemolysis. It has been already reported a case in which a patient developed severe reactions to fresh-frozen plasma that required discontinuation of PEX. Differently from this case, our patient was already using the less immunogenic pooled plasma units Octaplas, therefore a strategy with caplacizumab was the only available option. Moreover, rituximab is associated with a shorter time to obtain a durable remission in aTTP and a faster time (15 days) to final ADAMTS13 activity recovery >10%. To our knowledge, this is the first case of early discontinuation of caplacizumab in a patient allergic to PEX by actively monitoring ADAMTS13 activity, allowing optimization of healthcare resources during COVID-19 pandemic.","Perrone, Salvatore; Passucci, Mauro; Ortu La Barbera, Elettra; Capriata, Marcello; Ferretti, Antonietta; Mecozzi, Alessandra; Giovangrossi, Piera; Equitani, Francesco; Cimino, Giuseppe",Journal of clinical apheresis,420,1

The functional plasticity of Tregs is a key feature of this lineage, as it allows them to adapt to different microenvironments, adopt transcriptional programs reflective of their environments and tailor their suppressive capacity in a context-dependent fashion. Tregs, particularly effector Tregs (eTregs), are abundant in many types of tumors. However, the functional and transcriptional plasticity of eTregs in tumors remain largely to be explored. Although depletion or inhibition of systemic Tregs can enhance anti-tumor responses, autoimmune sequelae have diminished the enthusiasm for such approaches. A more effective approach should specifically target intratumoral Tregs or subvert local Treg-mediated suppression. This mini-review will discuss the reported mechanisms by which the stability and suppressive function of tumoral Tregs are modulated, with the focus on eTregs and a subset of eTregs, follicular regulatory T (TFR) cells, and how to harness this knowledge for the future development of new effective cancer immunotherapies that selectively target the tumor local response while sparing the systemic side effects.","Dixon, Michael L; Leavenworth, Jonathan D; Leavenworth, Jianmei W",Frontiers in immunology,420,23

Recent analyses (i.e., data from 2017-2019) show that only 11 countries are on track for meeting WHO's elimination targets. For a country to be truly on track, it is important that the majority of infected individuals be identified and treated. There is still a need for country and population-specific evaluations within the different HCV screening and treatment strategies available, in order to assess their cost-effectiveness and sustainability and support an evidence-based policy for HCV elimination. Any health policy model is affected by the diversity and quality of the available data and by gaps in data. Given the differences among countries, comparing progress based on fixed global targets will not necessarily be suitable in the same measure for each country. In a recent document, the European Collaborators of Polaris Observatory provide insight into the limitations of the current WHO targets. The absolute targets identified by each country in accordance with the measures set by WHO would be essential in reaching the HCV elimination. All analytic models to assess the progress toward HCV elimination are based on projections to 2030 not including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on hepatitis-related services. With specific regard to the achievement of WHO hepatitis elimination goals, all measures that will be put in place during and after COVID-19 pandemic could be transferred in increasing diagnosis and linkage to care of people with hepatitis.","Kondili, Loreta A; Craxì, Antonio",Liver international : official journal of the International Association for the Study of the Liver,420,9

Up until now only a small amount of data have been published, most often as an overview of the problem. The current study was designed to investigate the co-occurrence of microsomic/macrosomic body structure (micro/macro-SBS) and congenital nervous system disorders or neurological syndromes with symptoms visible from infancy, based on essential data acquired during admission procedures at a neurological rehabilitation ward for children and adolescents. The study applied a retrospective analysis of data collected during hospitalization of 327 children and adolescents, aged 4-18 years who had been affected since infancy by congenital disorders of the nervous system and/or neurological syndromes associated with a minimum of one neurodysfunction. To identify subjects with microsomic or macrosomic body structure in the group of children and adolescents, the adopted criteria took into account z-score values for body height (z-score Ht), body weight (z-score Wt), head circumference (z-score HC), BMI (z-score BMI) and head circumference index (z-score HCI). The rates of micro/macro-SBS in the study group amounted to 7.3% and 0.6%, respectively. The findings show a more frequent co-occurrence of, as well as statistically significant correlations between, micro/macro-SBS and type of spasticity (cerebral palsy) (p = 0.024) as well as hydrocephalus not treated surgically (p < 0.001).

On January 23, China raised its national public health response to the highest level. As part of the emergency response, a series of public social distancing interventions were implemented to reduce the transmission rate of COVID-19. In this article, we explored the feasibility of using mobile terminal positioning data to study the impact of some nonpharmaceutical public health interventions implemented by China. First, this article introduced a hybrid method for measuring the number of people in public places based on anonymized mobile terminal positioning data. Additionally, the difference-in-difference (DID) model was used to estimate the effect of the interventions on reducing public gatherings in different provinces and during different stages. The data-driven experimental results showed that the interventions that China implemented reduced the number of people in public places by approximately 60% between January 24 and February 28. Among the 31 provinces in the Chinese mainland, some provinces, such as Tianjin and Chongqing, were more affected by the interventions, while other provinces, such as Gansu, were less affected. In terms of the stages, the phase with the greatest intervention effect was from February 3 to 14, during which the number of daily confirmed cases in China showed a turning point. In conclusion, the interventions significantly reduced public gatherings, and the effects of interventions varied with provinces and time.","Nie, Lei; Guo, Xin; Yi, Cheng Qi; Wang, Ruo Jia",Mathematical biosciences and engineering : MBE,420,17

The review indicates that (a) tested interactive IN-OT effects were highly heterogeneous; (b) for most published interactions, no replication was attempted; (c) when attempted, replications were largely unsuccessful; (d) significance was unrelated to sample size; (e) statistical power was critically low and unrelated to the rate of significant results; and (f) research practices were characteristic of an exploratory approach.

Comprehensive reports from other countries are needed. We dissect the pattern, evolution and predictive value of such abnormalities in a cohort from Madrid, Spain. METHODS Retrospective study with prospective 14-day follow-up of 373 patients with confirmed COVID-19 in five Madrid hospitals, including 50 outpatients. COVID-19 severe course was defined as need of mechanical ventilation. RESULTS A total of 33.1% hospitalised patients showed baseline AST elevation and 28.5% showed ALT elevation, contrasting with 12% and 8% of outpatients (P≤0.001). Baseline AST, ALT and GGT levels correlated with LDH and C-reactive protein levels (CRP) (r≤0.598, P<0.005). AST elevation was associated with other severity markers such as male sex, lymphopenia and pneumonia on X-ray (P<0.05 all). ALP and Bilirubin levels were rarely increased. Patients with elevated baseline AST displayed progressive normalization of this enzyme and increase in ALT and GGT levels. Patients with normal baseline AST showed a flattened evolution pattern with levels in range. Patients with a severe course of COVID-19 showed more frequently elevated baseline AST than those with a milder evolution (54.2% vs. 25.4%, P<0.001). Age, AST and CRP were independent risk factors for a severe course of COVID-19. CONCLUSION Mild liver enzyme elevation is associated with COVID-19 severity. Baseline AST is an independent predictor of severe COVID-19 course, while it tends to normalize over time. ALT and GGT show late elevation.","Fernández Carrillo, Carlos; Perelló, Christie; Llop Herrera, Elba; García-Samaniego, Javier; Romero, Miriam; Mostaza, José María; Ibáñez, Luis; Bañares Cañizares, Rafael; Bighelli, Federico; Usón Perón, Clara; Fernández Vázquez, Inmaculada; Hernández Castro, Olga; Albillos, Agustín; Lalueza, Antonio; Malo de Molina, Rosa; Muñez, Elena; Jiménez Tejero, Elena; Calleja Panero, José Luis",Revista espanola de enfermedades digestivas : organo oficial de la Sociedad Espanola de Patologia Digestiva,420,20

Acknowledging the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to mutate into distinct strains as an RNA virus and investigating its potential to cause reinfection is important for future health policy guidelines. It was thought that individuals who recovered from COVID-19 generate a robust immune response and develop protective immunity; however, since the first case of documented reinfection of COVID-19 in August 2020, there have been a number of cases with reinfection. Many cases are lacking genomic data of the two infections, and it remains unclear whether they were caused by different strains. In the present study, we undertook a rapid systematic review to identify cases infected with different genetic strains of SARS-CoV-2 confirmed by PCR and viral genome sequencing. A total of 17 cases of genetically confirmed COVID-19 reinfection were found. One immunocompromised patient had mild symptoms with the first infection but developed severe symptoms resulting in death with the second infection. Overall, 68.8% (11/16) had similar severity; 18.8% (3/16) had worse symptoms; and 12.5% (2/16) had milder symptoms with the second episode. Our case series shows that reinfection with different strains is possible, and some cases may experience more severe infections with the second episode. The findings also suggest that COVID-19 may continue to circulate even after achieving herd immunity through natural infection or vaccination, suggesting the need for longer-term transmission mitigation efforts.","Wang, Jingzhou; Kaperak, Christopher; Sato, Toshiro; Sakuraba, Atsushi",Journal of investigative medicine : the official publication of the American Federation for Clinical Research,420,17

Because of the high frequency of naturally occurring mutations, the emergence of H5N1 variants with high virulence has raised great concerns about the potential transmissibility of the virus in humans. Recent studies have shown that laboratory-mutated or reassortant H5N1 viruses could be efficiently transmitted among mammals, particularly ferrets, the best animal model for humans. Thus, it is critical to establish effective strategies to combat future H5N1 pandemics. In this study, we identified a broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibody (MAb), HA-7, that potently neutralized all tested strains of H5N1 covering clades 0, 1, 2.2, 2.3.4, and 2.3.2.1 and completely protected mice against lethal challenges of H5N1 viruses from clades 1 and 2.3.4. HA-7 specifically targeted the globular head of the H5N1 virus hemagglutinin (HA). Using electron microscopy technology with three-dimensional reconstruction (3D-EM), we discovered that HA-7 bound to a novel and highly conserved conformational epitope that was centered on residues 81 to 83 and 117 to 122 of HA1 (H5 numbering). We further demonstrated that HA-7 inhibited viral entry during postattachment events but not at the receptor-binding step, which is fully consistent with the 3D-EM result. Taken together, we propose that HA-7 could be humanized as an effective passive immunotherapeutic agent for antiviral stockpiling for future influenza pandemics caused by emerging unpredictable H5N1 strains. Our study also provides a sound foundation for the rational design of vaccines capable of inducing broad-spectrum immunity against H5N1.","Du, Lanying; Jin, Lei; Zhao, Guangyu; Sun, Shihui; Li, Junfeng; Yu, Hong; Li, Ye; Zheng, Bo-Jian; Liddington, Robert C; Zhou, Yusen; Jiang, Shibo",Journal of virology,420,4

Additionally, PbtO2 signals have been used to derive indices thought to be associated with cerebrovascular reactivity in TBI. However, their true relationship to slow-wave vasogenic fluctuations associated with cerebral autoregulation remains unclear. The goal of this study was to investigate the relationship between slow-wave fluctuations of intracranial pressure (ICP), mean arterial pressure (MAP) and PbtO2 over time. Using the Collaborative European NeuroTrauma Effectiveness Research in Traumatic Brain Injury (CENTER-TBI) high resolution ICU sub-study cohort, we evaluated those patients with recorded high-frequency digital intra-parenchymal ICP and PbtO2 monitoring data of a minimum of 6 h in duration. Digital physiologic signals were processed for ICP, MAP, and PbtO2 slow-waves using a moving average filter to decimate the high-frequency signal. The first 5 days of recording were analyzed. The relationship between ICP, MAP and PbtO2 slow-waves over time were assessed using autoregressive integrative moving average (ARIMA) and vector autoregressive integrative moving average (VARIMA) modelling, as well as Granger causality testing. A total of 47 patients were included. The ARIMA structure of ICP and MAP were similar in time, where PbtO2 displayed different optimal structure. VARIMA modelling and IRF plots confirmed the strong directional relationship between MAP and ICP, demonstrating an ICP response to MAP impulse. PbtO2 slow-waves, however, failed to demonstrate a definite response to ICP and MAP slow-wave impulses. These results raise questions as to the utility of PbtO2 in the derivation of cerebrovascular reactivity measures in TBI. There is a reproducible relationship between slow-wave fluctuations of ICP and MAP, as demonstrated across various time-series analytic techniques. PbtO2 does not appear to reliably respond in time to slow-wave fluctuations in MAP, as demonstrated on various VARIMA models across all patients. These findings suggest that PbtO2 should not be utilized in the derivation of cerebrovascular reactivity metrics in TBI, as it does not appear to be responsive to changes in MAP in the slow-waves. These findings corroborate previous results regarding PbtO2 based cerebrovascular reactivity indices.","Zeiler, Frederick A; Cabeleira, Manuel; Hutchinson, Peter J; Stocchetti, Nino; Czosnyka, Marek; Smielewski, Peter; Ercole, Ari",Journal of clinical monitoring and computing,420,1

METHODS The authors conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled, 1:1 allocation, two-arm parallel group, superiority design, randomized controlled trial in patients undergoing microsurgical abdominally based breast reconstruction. Intraoperatively, epidural catheters were inserted under direct vision through the triangle of Petit on both sides of the abdomen into the transversus abdominis plane just before rectus fascial closure. Patients received either bupivacaine (study group) or saline (placebo group) through the catheters for 2 postoperative days. All patients received hydromorphone by means of a patient-controlled analgesic pump. The primary outcome was the difference in the parenteral opioid consumption on each postoperative day between the groups. The secondary outcome measures included the following: total in-hospital opioid; antinausea medication; pain, nausea, and sedation scores; Quality of Recovery Score; time to ambulation; and hospital stay duration. RESULTS Between September of 2011 and June of 2013, 93 patients were enrolled: 49 received bupivacaine and 44 received saline. There were 11 postoperative complications (13 percent); none were related to the catheter. Primary outcomes were completed by 85 of 93 patients (91.3 percent); the mean parenteral morphine consumption was significantly reduced on postoperative day 1 in the bupivacaine group (20.7±20.1 mg) compared with 30.0±19.1 mg in the control group (p=0.02). There were no significant differences in secondary outcomes. CONCLUSION Following abdominally based breast reconstruction, transversus abdominis plane peripheral nerve block is safe and significantly reduces morphine consumption in the early postoperative period.

Among other disciplines, also cytopathology is key in diagnosis and treatment management of these patients. Indeed, cytopathology specimens are often the only source of available tissue material for morphological diagnosis and molecular purposes in order to guarantee an adequate treatment decision making, since surgical resection specimens are not available when lung cancer is diagnosed at advanced disease stages. Today, as an effect of the current severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic, cytopathology is reorganizing and reshaping many of its procedures and workflows, in order to ensure the safety of cytopathologists and laboratory personnel. In particular, careful attention should be paid on biosafety procedures when pulmonary cytological specimens are handled.

It is an independent factor for postoperative complications and longer length of stay (LOS). The aim of this study was to evaluate the extent to which preoperative anemia impacts on enhanced recovery programs (ERP) outcomes. MATERIALS AND METHODS The data for patients scheduled for colorectal surgery between 2015 and 2019, were analyzed (n = 494). All patients were managed with the same ERP. Demographic data, preoperative risk factors, postoperative complications, LOS and adherence to ERP were compared between anemic and non-anemic patients. Anemia was defined by a hemoglobin concentration < 13 g dL-1 in men and < 12 g dL-1 in women. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION In total, 173 patients had preoperative anemia. They were older (p < 0.001) and more often male (p = 0.02). The following risk factors were significantly more frequent in the anemic group: renal failure (p = 0.04), malnutrition (p < 0.001), cardiac arrhythmia (p < 0.001), coronaropathy (p = 0.02) and anticoagulant treatment (p < 0.001). Despite more risk factors, anemic patients did not experience more postoperative complications (38.2% vs. 31.2%, p = 0.12). Overall adherence to ERP was similar (18 [16-19] vs. 18 [17-19], p = 0.06). LOS was 4 [3-7] and 3 [2-6.25] days in the anemic and the non-anemic groups, respectively (p < 0.002). Multivariate analysis showed that anemia did not affect LOS (p = 0.27). CONCLUSION Our study suggests that preoperative anemia does not detract from the benefits of ERP after elective colorectal surgery.","Hardy, Pierre-Yves; Degesve, Maxime; Joris, Jean; Coimbra, Carla; Decker, Emmanuel; Hans, Gregory",World journal of surgery,420,31

Capsule Scoring of Ulcerative Colitis (CSUC) was developed as a severity index for UC. We aimed to determine whether CSUC is useful for predicting relapse during clinical remission. METHODS Forty-one UC patients in clinical remission were prospectively registered from April 2016 to August 2019. Patients' CSUC score was obtained; those with subsequent relapse were followed up retrospectively. The correlation of CSUC with white blood cell (WBC) count, Platelet count, albumin (Alb), C-reactive protein (CRP), fecal calprotectin (FC) and fecal lactoferrin (FL) levels, and fecal immunochemical test (FIT) results was evaluated; their predictive values for future relapse were compared. RESULTS The correlations of CSUC with WBC, Platelet, Alb, CRP, FC, FIT, and FL values were rs =0.13, 0.27, -0.25, 0.15, 0.50, 0.43 and 0.50 respectively. CSUC was higher in 12 patients who relapsed within 1 year than in 29 patients who remained in clinical remission (2.83±1.95 vs. 0.72±1.00, p<0.01). Receiver operator characteristic curve analysis showed that CSUC >1 was a predictor of relapse (area under the curve 0.82, sensitivity 83.3%, specificity 58.6%) and maybe superior to fecal biomarkers. In the univariate analysis, patients with CSUC of 0 had a lower relapse rate than those with CSUC of ≧1 (p=0.03, logrank test). After analyzing patients who underwent CCE2 6 within 6 months after the successful induction treatment, results showed that those with CSUC of ≤1 remained in clinical remission for a year. CONCLUSION CSUC predicts relapse within 1 year in UC patients in clinical remission, especially when used 6 months after induction treatment.","Matsubayashi, Mao; Kobayashi, Taku; Okabayashi, Shinji; Nakano, Masaru; Sagami, Shintaro; Ozaki, Ryo; Kiyohara, Hiroki; Morikubo, Hiromu; Asonuma, Kunio; Miyatani, Yusuke; Maeda, Shin; Hibi, Toshifumi",Journal of gastroenterology and hepatology,420,16

This study evaluated the feasibility and safety of administering surfactant into the pharynx of infants born at <25 weeks immediately after birth. METHODS This study of 19 infants was conducted from January 2013 to June 2014 in a tertiary perinatal centre in Prague. We administered 1.5 mL of Curosurf as a bolus into the pharynx and simultaneously performed a sustained inflation manoeuvre (SIM). The extent of the interventions, death and severe neonatal morbidity in the study group were compared with 20 controls born before the study period and 20 born after it. RESULTS All infants received oropharyngeal surfactant within the median (interquartile range) time of 40 seconds (25-75) after cord camping. The surfactant had to be suctioned in one infant because of upper airway obstruction. Although more subsequent surfactant was administered in the study group, significantly fewer study period infants required intubation than the before and after controls (16% versus 75% and 58%, respectively, p < 0.01). CONCLUSION Oropharyngeal surfactant with simultaneous SIM was feasible and safe and reduced the need for delivery room intubation in these fragile infants.","Lamberska, Tereza; Settelmayerova, Eva; Smisek, Jan; Luksova, Marketa; Maloskova, Gabriela; Plavka, Richard",Acta paediatrica,420,16

This manuscript summarizes the current knowledge on direct viral infection of kidney tissue, proteinuria and acute kidney injury in COVID-19, and management of patients on chronic dialysis as well as after kidney transplantation. Direct infection of podocytes and proximal tubular cells by SARS-CoV-2 has been confirmed and results in proteinuria and hematuria at an early stage of COVID-19. In this context, any kidney affection is a predictor of worse outcomes among COVID-19 patients irrespective of the initial presentation and increases the risk of acute kidney injury. Specific therapies for kidney damage and acute kidney injury within COVID-19 that could be generally recommended are currently lacking. Patients on chronic hemodialysis in particular are at risk for contracting SARS-CoV-2 infections as indicated by outbreaks and super-spreading events in hemodialysis facilities. Immunosuppressive therapy after kidney transplantation needs to be adapted upon diagnosis of COVID-19 depending on the severity of the initial presentation.","Kann, Martin; Benzing, Thomas",Deutsche medizinische Wochenschrift,420,24

MOUD treatment rates continue to be low across the US, and currently, some evidence suggests access to evidence-based treatment is becoming increasingly difficult for those with OUD as a result of the 2019 novel corona virus (COVID-19). A major underutilized source to address these serious challenges in the US is community pharmacy given the specialized training of pharmacists, high levels of consumer trust, and general availability for accessing these service settings. Canadian, Australian, and European pharmacists have made important contributions to the treatment and care of those with OUD over the past decades. Unfortunately, US pharmacists are not permitted to prescribe MOUD and are only currently allowed to dispense methadone for the treatment of pain, not OUD. US policymakers, regulators, and practitioners must work to facilitate this advancement of community pharmacy-based through research, education, practice, and industry. Advancing community pharmacy-based MOUD for leading clinical management of OUD and dispensation of treatment medications will afford the US a critical innovation for addressing the opioid epidemic, fallout from COVID-19, and getting individuals the care they need.","Cochran, Gerald; Bruneau, Julie; Cox, Nicholas; Gordon, Adam J",Substance abuse,420,1

This exploratory study aims to analyze older adult perspectives of how smart technology influenced their meaning in life during the Covid-19 Public Health Emergency period, using qualitative research at a cross-national level. Three hundred and fifty-one community-dwelling older participants aged 65-87 years were included in the study. Participants were Italian, Mexican, Portuguese and Spanish. All the narratives went through a process of content analysis. Findings of content analysis produced six themes: Meaningful relations, rewarding activities, spirituality, health and safety-related support, self-growth, and physical activity. Smart technology was important in promoting significant relations for Mexican older adults (71.3%), rewarding activities for Portuguese older adults (57.1%), spirituality for Spanish older participants (71.6%), and physical activity for Italian older adults (29.5%). This study indicated that smart technology during the Health Emergency period was important for the meaning in life of older populations, mostly by facilitating meaningful relations, rewarding activities and spirituality. Future interventions with older adults during pandemic periods should consider the diversity of themes associated with increasing older adult well-being, from a cross-cultural perspective.","von Humboldt, Sofia; Mendoza-Ruvalcaba, Neyda Ma; Arias-Merino, Elva Dolores; Costa, Andrea; Cabras, Emilia; Low, Gail; Leal, Isabel",International review of psychiatry,420,25

There is however a need for greater coordination, with limited resources and the shifting global nature of the pandemic resulting in a proliferation of research projects underpowered and unable to achieve their aims. METHODS The UK Collaborative on Development Research (UKCDR) and Global Research Collaboration for Infectious Disease Preparedness (GloPID-R), two funder coordination groups have collaborated to develop a live database of funded research projects across the world relating to COVID-19. Drawing data continually from their members and further global funding bodies, as of 15th April 2021 the database contains 10,608 projects, funded by 201 funders, taking place across 142 countries representing an investment of at least $4.7 billion. To our knowledge it is one of the most comprehensive databases. The database is aligned to the World Health Organisation and GloPID-R Global Research Roadmap: 2019 Novel Coronavirus. It is being used by the WHO, governments and multi-lateral policy makers, research funders and researchers. This living mapping review aims to supplement the database by providing an open accessible and frequently updated resource summarising the characteristics of the COVID-19 funded research portfolio. Both descriptive and thematic analysis will be presented and updated frequently to aid interpretation of the global COVID-19 funded research portfolio. RESULTS In this version four analysis we provide an updated detailed descriptive analysis of the database (three months after version three) and focus our thematic analysis on research gaps, research areas in need of coordination, study populations and research locations (with a focus on resource-limited countries).

Acute care providers are the first to respond to mass emergencies from the healthcare sector. The preparedness of acute care providers in New Zealand to respond to mass emergencies has not been previously studied. OBJECTIVE To assess the self-reported training and experience of New Zealand acute care providers to respond to mass emergencies and the factors associated with strong preparedness. METHODS A cross-sectional national survey of 1500 acute care providers in New Zealand carried out between 2009 and 2010. The survey assessed experience, training and self-reported preparedness. It also determined the factors associated with strong perceived preparedness. RESULTS The response rate to this survey was 60.7%. Nurses had a higher response rate than doctors or paramedics. Only 29.2% of acute care providers reported responding to a previous mass emergency event. There were 53.5% of acute care providers who reported having formal training in how to deal with mass emergencies, whereas 58.1% of participants reported that they were aware of their role during a healthcare mass emergency response. The factors associated with self-reported strong preparedness to deal with mass emergencies included: being a paramedic, previous training, participation in a drill, willingness to report to work during an infection or man-made emergency, ability to triage and general awareness of the role during a mass emergency. CONCLUSION Almost half of New Zealand acute healthcare providers have no training in dealing with mass emergency events. Training and general awareness of the role during a mass emergency response were the main factors associated with strong self-reported preparedness of acute care providers. The apparent efficacy of training allied to lack of availability means that it should be a national priority.","Al-Shaqsi, Sultan; Gauld, Robin; McBride, David; Al-Kashmiri, Ammar; Al-Harthy, Abdullah",Emergency medicine Australasia : EMA,420,27

DESIGN cross-sectional study based on the record linkage of the COVID-19 notification system, the regional population health register and the 2011 census data. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS residents in Emilia-Romagna who were grouped according to three ESEMs calculated at census block level: the index of deprivation, the household crowding, and the percentage of the foreign resident population. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES counts of all deaths and those directly attributable to COVID-19. The association between mortality and ESEMs was assessed through rate differences and mortality rate ratios, estimated through Poisson models. RESULTS during the outbreak peak, the nine provinces of the Emilia-Romagna Region were unequally hit by the COVID-19 outbreak, with Piacenza recording the highest COVID-19 absolute death toll and Ferrara the lowest. The overall and COVID-19 mortality burden was unequal also in terms of ecological socioeconomic measures. Percentage differences in the age-standardised mortality rates between the least and the most disadvantaged census blocks were greater for COVID-19 mortality than for overall mortality, suggesting that the Coronavirus outbreak has had a stronger impact on the most socioeconomically deprived areas. Although clear gradients were not always present, people living in the most disadvantaged census blocks experienced the highest absolute and relative risk of dying. Rate differences were larger among men, but mortality rate ratios were not always greater among men than women, especially for the COVID-19 mortality.

A small proportion of patients infected with COVID-19 go on to develop pneumonia. We speculated that COVID-19 may be likely to result in psychological disorders such as anxiety and depression. In this study, we conducted an investigation of anxiety and depression in patients with COVID-19. METHODS Sixty-five COVID-19 patients were randomly enrolled into this study. Anxiety and depression among participants were measured through the completion of anonymous Chinese-language Zung self-rating anxiety scale and self-rating depression scale questionnaires. Data were analyzed using independent samples t-tests, Mann-Whitney U-tests, and χ2 tests. RESULTS The questionnaire results showed that 26.15% and 41.54% of participants suffered from anxiety and depression, respectively, although there was no significantly statistical difference between the proportions of COVID-19 patients with anxiety and depression. Statistically significant differences in employment status, partial pressure of oxygen, and corticosteroid application existed between moderate- and severe COVID-19 patients (P<0.05). In particular, the partial pressure of oxygen was significantly lower in severe COVID-19 patients than in their moderate counter parts (71.31±23.54 vs. 101.06±34.43, U=156, P=0.006). Total lymphocytes was lower in severe group than in moderate group [1.659±0.643 vs. 0.745 (0.645, 0.928), U=109, P=0.000]. Also, a higher proportion of female than male patients had anxiety (χ2=5.388, P=0.02). COVID-19 patients who received antiviral medications also displayed a higher rate of anxiety (χ2=4.481, P=0.034). Total lymphocytes between the non-anxiety and anxiety had statistical difference (U=321, P=0.019). Meanwhile, total lymphocytes between the non-depression and depression also had statistical difference (U=389.5, P=0.01).

An arachnoid cyst (AC) is a sac filled with cerebrospinal fluid located between the brain or spinal cord and the arachnoid membrane, which is one of the three meninges covering the brain or spinal cord. Although it is rare, the cyst is associated with CSDH in juveniles, and the recurrence rate of CSDH increases in such cases. Much of the literature has supported the preventive role of middle meningeal artery (MMA) embolization in recurrent CSDH.

METHODS We conducted this trial of two targeted temperature interventions at 38 children's hospitals involving children who remained unconscious after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. Within 6 hours after the return of circulation, comatose patients who were older than 2 days and younger than 18 years of age were randomly assigned to therapeutic hypothermia (target temperature, 33.0°C) or therapeutic normothermia (target temperature, 36.8°C). The primary efficacy outcome, survival at 12 months after cardiac arrest with a Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales, second edition (VABS-II), score of 70 or higher (on a scale from 20 to 160, with higher scores indicating better function), was evaluated among patients with a VABS-II score of at least 70 before cardiac arrest. RESULTS A total of 295 patients underwent randomization. Among the 260 patients with data that could be evaluated and who had a VABS-II score of at least 70 before cardiac arrest, there was no significant difference in the primary outcome between the hypothermia group and the normothermia group (20% vs. 12%; relative likelihood, 1.54; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.86 to 2.76; P=0.14). Among all the patients with data that could be evaluated, the change in the VABS-II score from baseline to 12 months was not significantly different (P=0.13) and 1-year survival was similar (38% in the hypothermia group vs. 29% in the normothermia group; relative likelihood, 1.29; 95% CI, 0.93 to 1.79; P=0.13). The groups had similar incidences of infection and serious arrhythmias, as well as similar use of blood products and 28-day mortality. CONCLUSIONS In comatose children who survived out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, therapeutic hypothermia, as compared with therapeutic normothermia, did not confer a significant benefit in survival with a good functional outcome at 1 year.

Few data are available on the post-lockdown phase in terms of health-care procedures in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) care, and no data are available specifically from IBD units. We aimed to investigate how IBD management was restructured during the lockdown phase, the impact of the restructuring on standards of care and how Italian IBD units have managed post-lockdown activities. METHODS A web-based online survey was conducted in two phases (April and June 2020) among the Italian Group for IBD affiliated units within the entire country. We investigated preventive measures, the possibility of continuing scheduled visits/procedures/therapies because of COVID-19 and how units resumed activities in the post-lockdown phase. RESULTS Forty-two referral centres participated from all over Italy. During the COVID-19 lockdown, 36% of first visits and 7% of follow-up visits were regularly done, while >70% of follow-up scheduled visits and 5% of first visits were done virtually. About 25% of scheduled endoscopies and bowel ultrasound scans were done. More than 80% of biological therapies were done as scheduled. Compared to the pre-lockdown situation, 95% of centres modified management of outpatient activity, 93% of endoscopies, 59% of gastrointestinal ultrasounds and 33% of biological therapies. Resumption of activities after the lockdown phase may take three to six months to normalize. Virtual clinics, implementation of IBD pathways and facilities seem to be the main factors to improve care in the future. CONCLUSION Italian IBD unit restructuring allowed quality standards of care during the COVID-19 pandemic to be maintained. A return to normal appears to be feasible and achievable relatively quickly. Some approaches, such as virtual clinics and identified IBD pathways, represent a valid starting point to improve IBD care in the post-COVID-19 era.","Saibeni, Simone; Scucchi, Ludovica; Dragoni, Gabriele; Bezzio, Cristina; Miranda, Agnese; Ribaldone, Davide Giuseppe; Bertani, Angela; Bossa, Fabrizio; Allocca, Mariangela; Buda, Andrea; Mocci, Gianmarco; Soriano, Alessandra; Mazzuoli, Silvia; Bertani, Lorenzo; Baccini, Flavia; Loddo, Erika; Privitera, Antonino Carlo; Sartini, Alessandro; Viscido, Angelo; Grossi, Laurino; Casini, Valentina; Gerardi, Viviana; Ascolani, Marta; Ruscio, Mirko Di; Casella, Giovanni; Savarino, Edoardo; Stradella, Davide; Pumpo, Rossella; Cortelezzi, Claudio Camillo; Daperno, Marco; Ciardo, Valeria; Nardone, Olga Maria; Caprioli, Flavio; Vitale, Giovanna; Cappello, Maria; Comberlato, Michele; Alvisi, Patrizia; Festa, Stefano; Campigotto, Michele; Bodini, Giorgia; Balestrieri, Paola; Viola, Anna; Pugliese, Daniela; Armuzzi, Alessandro; Fantini, Massimo C; Fiorino, Gionata",United European gastroenterology journal,420,16

The expanding evidence base suggests that sedentary behaviour may have a detrimental effect on health, well-being and is associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality. We aim to review process evaluations of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) which included a measure of sedentary behaviour in adults in order to develop an understanding of intervention content, mechanisms of impact, implementation and delivery approaches and contexts, in which interventions were reported to be effective or effective. A secondary aim is to summarise participants, family and staff experiences of such interventions. METHODS AND ANALYSIS Ten electronic databases and reference lists from previous similar reviews will be searched. Eligible studies will be process evaluations of RCTs that measure sedentary behaviour as a primary or secondary outcome in adults. As this review will contribute to a programme to develop a community-based intervention to reduce sedentary behaviour in stroke survivors, interventions delivered in schools, colleges, universities or workplaces will be excluded. Two reviewers will perform study selection, data extraction and quality assessment. Disagreements between reviewers will be resolved by a third reviewer. Process evaluation data to be extracted include the aims and methods used in the process evaluation; implementation data; mechanisms of impact; contextual factors; participant, family and staff experiences of the interventions. A narrative approach will be used to synthesise and report qualitative and quantitative data. Reporting of the review will be informed by Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis guidance.

This scoping review aims to summarise the available evidence on the topic and identify gaps in the literature. The scoping review framework as described by Arskey and O'Malley (Soc Res Methodol 8(1):19-32, 2005) was used. Searches were undertaken in six databases. Inclusion criteria included that participants were adults (18+ years), with a primary diagnosis of non-traumatic SAH, and dysphagia occurred as a result of non-traumatic SAH. Data was extracted by the primary author independently and cross-checked by the second author. Data extracted included year of publication, study location, population, aims of the study, study design, method used to identify dysphagia, who completed the assessment, dysphagia incidence, dysphagia type and severity, risk factors, characteristics, and intervention details. Ten studies were included. Dysphagia was diagnosed based on staff reports, screening, clinical swallowing examination, and/or instrumental swallowing assessment with considerable variability identified across studies with regard to incidence (range 0.9-100%). Studies were highly heterogeneous with regard to dysphagia assessment practice, risk factors, characteristics, provision of intervention, and outcomes. The current evidence regarding dysphagia following non-traumatic SAH is insufficient to provide best practice guidelines for assessment and management recommendations. Emerging evidence will inform healthcare professionals managing dysphagia in individuals following non-traumatic SAH. Future research with more rigorous study designs will promote evidence-based clinical care standards for this population.","Dunn, Katrina; Rumbach, Anna; Finch, Emma",Neurosurgical review,420,31

STUDY SELECTION The review focused primarily on pediatric literature relevant to the topic of interest. CONCLUSIONS Neonatal sepsis is variably defined based on a number of clinical and laboratory criteria that make the study of this common and devastating condition very difficult. Diagnostic challenges and uncertain disease epidemiology necessarily result from a variable definition of disease. In 2005, intensivists caring for children recognized that as new drugs became available, children would be increasingly studied and thus, pediatric-specific consensus definitions were needed. Pediatric sepsis criteria are not accurate for term neonates and have not been examined in preterm neonates for whom the developmental stage influences aberrations associated with host immune response. Thus, specific consensus definitions for both term and preterm neonates are needed. Such definitions are critical for the interpretation of observational studies, future training of scientists and practitioners, and implementation of clinical trials in neonates.","Wynn, James L; Wong, Hector R; Shanley, Thomas P; Bizzarro, Matthew J; Saiman, Lisa; Polin, Richard A",Pediatric critical care medicine : a journal of the Society of Critical Care Medicine and the World Federation of Pediatric Intensive and Critical Care Societies,420,31

MATERIALS AND METHODS Seventy-six patients who had an indication for hysterectomy for benign uterine disease were randomized to LESS-TLH or LESS-LAVH. Surgical outcomes were assessed and compared between the two groups. RESULTS There were no differences in baseline demographics between the two groups. Surgical outcomes such as operative time, estimated blood loss, length of hospital stay, and complication rate were similar between the two groups. The failure rate in the LESS-TLH group was higher than that in the LESS-LAVH group (5/38 [11%] versus 0/38 [0%]), although this difference did not reach statistical significance (P=.054). Among the 5 cases that failed in the LESS-TLH group, 4 were related to a large lower uterine segment prohibiting visualization during colpotomy. The postoperative pain scores at 18 and 36 hours after surgery were significantly lower in the LESS-TLH group than in the LESS-LAVH group (all P<.001). Vaginal discharge at 1 and 4 weeks after surgery was significantly lower in the LESS-TLH group than in the LESS-LAVH group (all P<.001). CONCLUSIONS LESS-TLH and LESS-LAVH are both safe, feasible procedures with similar surgical outcomes. LESS-TLH was associated with less postoperative pain and less postoperative vaginal discharge, whereas LESS-LAVH may be preferred in patients with a uterus with a large lower uterine segment.","Song, Taejong; Kim, Mi Kyoung; Kim, Mi-La; Jung, Yong Wook; Yun, Bo Seung; Seong, Seok Ju",Journal of laparoendoscopic & advanced surgical techniques.

Although the mechanism of this phenomenon is not understood, one proposed explanation (the windkessel hypothesis) is that removal of aneurysmal compliance increases distal pulse pressure. METHODS We present a case of delayed haemorrhage after placement of a Pipeline stent, discuss the proposed mechanisms, and describe a novel electrical analogue model that was used to evaluate the likely haemodynamic effect of stent placement. RESULTS Model-based analysis suggests that stenting is not likely to produce a significant change in distal pulse pressure. Moreover, basic fluid dynamics principles suggest that a local reduction in disturbed flow in the region of the aneurysm could produce only a minor increase in distal pressure (a few mmHg), which is unlikely to be the main cause of the observed haemorrhage. CONCLUSION The windkessel hypothesis is unlikely to explain the occurrence of delayed ipsilateral intraparenchymal haemorrhage after flow diversion; however, other mechanisms involving altered haemodynamics distal to the treated aneurysm may play a role. Further studies involving the assessment of haemodynamic changes after flow diversion would be useful to understand, and eventually mitigate, this currently unpredictable risk.","Mitha, Alim P; Mynard, Jonathan P; Storwick, John A; Shivji, Zaher I; Wong, John H; Morrish, William","Heart, lung & circulation",420,19

Insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1) exerts a variety of biological effects. However, the role of IGF-1 in myocarditis remains unclear. PATIENTS AND METHODS LDL-R knockout mice were randomly divided into the control group, myocarditis group, and IGF-1 siRNA group. Real Time-Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) and Western blot were used to measure IGF-1 expression in myocardial tissue. The myocardial tissue changes were analyzed by HE staining. The total cholesterol (TC) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL) in each group were detected. Flow cytometry was used to analyze the number of macrophages. The secretion of TNF-α and INF-γ and macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). RESULTS Compared with the control group, IGF-1 expression, TC, and LDL in myocarditis group was significantly increased, along with decreased heart rate (HR), left ventricular end-systolic diameter (LVEDs), left ventricular end-diastolic diameter (LVEDd), and left ventricular mass index (LVMI). In addition, inflammatory cell infiltration, fibrosis, and macrophages number in the peritoneum were increased. Moreover, the secretion of TNF-α, INF-γ, and MIF was also significantly increased (p<0.05). However, IGF-1 siRNA treatment inhibited IGF-1 expression and reversed the changes in the myocarditis group with statistically significant differences compared with the myocarditis group (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS IGF-1 expression is increased in myocarditis. The downregulation of IGF-1 expression inhibits macrophages infiltration, reduces the expression of MIF and inflammatory factors, and improves myocarditis injury.","Li, H-D; Chen, B; Yang, F",European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,420,1

BRCA1/BARD1 are the best-known tumor suppressors that promote homology recombination (HR) and arrest cell cycle. However, it remains ambiguous whether and how their E3 ligase activity regulates HR. Here, we demonstrate that upon genotoxic stress, BRCA1 together with BARD1 catalyzes the K48 polyubiquitination on LARP7, a 7SK RNA binding protein known to control RNAPII pausing, and thereby degrades it through the 26S ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Depleting LARP7 suppresses the expression of CDK1 complex, arrests the cell at the G2/M DNA damage checkpoint, and reduces BRCA2 phosphorylation, which thereby facilitates RAD51 recruitment to damaged DNA to enhance HR. Importantly, LARP7 depletion observed in breast cancer patients leads to chemoradiotherapy resistance both in vitro and in vivo. Altogether, this study unveils a mechanism by which BRCA1/BARD1 control HR and cell cycle, and highlights LARP7 as a potential target for cancer prevention and therapy.","Zhang, Fang; Yan, Pengyi; Yu, Huijing; Le, Huangying; Li, Zixuan; Chen, Jiahuan; Liang, Xiaodong; Wang, Shiyan; Wei, Weiting; Liu, Li; Zhang, Yan; Ji, Xing; Xie, Anyong; Chen, Wantao; Han, Zeguang; Pu, William T; Chen, Sun; Chen, Yingwei; Sun, Kun; Ge, Baoxie; Zhang, Bing",Cell reports,420,31

Late-onset Alzheimer disease (LOAD) is the most common neurodegenerative disorder worldwide. Differences at the expression level of certain genes, resulting from either genetic variations or environmental interactions, might be one of the mechanisms underlying differential risks for developing AD. Peripheral blood genome transcriptional profiling may provide a powerful and minimally invasive tool for the identification of novel targets beyond Aβ and tau for AD research. Methods This preliminary study explores molecular pathogenesis of LOAD-related inflammation through next generation sequencing, to assess RNA expression profiles in peripheral blood from five patients with LOAD and 10 healthy controls. Results The analysis of RNA expression profiles revealed 94 genes up-regulated and 147 down-regulated. Gene function analysis, including Gene Ontology (GO) and KOBAS-Kyoto Encyclopedia of DEGs and Genomes (KEGG) pathways indicated upregulation of interferon family (INF) signaling, while the down-regulated genes were mainly associated with the cell cycle process. KEGG metabolic pathways mapping showed gene expression alterations in the signaling pathways of JAK/STAT, chemokines, MAP kinases and Alzheimer disease. The results of this preliminary study provided not only a comprehensive picture of gene expression, but also the key processes associated with pathology for the regulation of neuroinflammation, to improve the current mechanisms to treat LOAD.","Cardona, Kelly; Medina, Javier; Orrego-Cardozo, Mary; Restrepo de Mejía, Francia; Elcoroaristizabal, Xabier; Naranjo Galvis, Carlos Andrés",PeerJ,420,16

OBJECTIVE AND RATIONALE Is PCOS a risk factor for cardiometabolic disease? SEARCH METHODS We searched from inception to September 2019 in MEDLINE and EMBASE using controlled terms (e.g. MESH) and text words for PCOS and cardiometabolic outcomes, including cardiovascular disease (CVD), stroke, myocardial infarction, hypertension (HT), type 2 diabetes (T2D), metabolic syndrome and dyslipidaemia. Cohort studies and case-control studies comparing the prevalence of T2D, HT, fatal or non-fatal CVD and/or lipid concentrations of total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and triglycerides (TGs) between women with and without PCOS of ≥18 years of age were eligible for this systematic review and meta-analysis. Studies were eligible regardless of the degree to which they adjusted for confounders including obesity. Articles had to be written in English, German or Dutch. Intervention studies, animal studies, conference abstracts, studies with a follow-up duration less than 3 years and studies with less than 10 PCOS cases were excluded. Study selection, quality assessment (Newcastle-Ottawa Scale) and data extraction were performed by two independent researchers. OUTCOMES Of the 5971 identified records, 23 cohort studies were included in the current systematic review. Women with PCOS had increased risks of HT (risk ratio (RR): 1.75, 95% CI 1.42 to 2.15), T2D (RR: 3.00, 95% CI 2.56 to 3.51), a higher serum concentration of TC (mean difference (MD): 7.14 95% CI 1.58 to 12.70 mg/dl), a lower serum concentration of HDL-C (MD: -2.45 95% CI -4.51 to -0.38 mg/dl) and increased risks of non-fatal cerebrovascular disease events (RR: 1.41, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.94) compared to women without PCOS. No differences were found for LDL-C (MD: 3.32 95% CI -4.11 to 10.75 mg/dl), TG (MD 18.53 95% CI -0.58 to 37.64 mg/dl) or coronary disease events (RR: 1.78, 95% CI 0.99 to 3.23). No meta-analyses could be performed for fatal CVD events due to the paucity of mortality data. WIDER IMPLICATIONS Women with PCOS are at increased risk of cardiometabolic disease. This review quantifies this risk, which is important for clinicians to inform patients and to take into account in the cardiovascular risk assessment of women with PCOS. Future clinical trials are needed to assess the ability of cardiometabolic screening and management in women with PCOS to reduce future CVD morbidity.","Wekker, V; van Dammen, L; Koning, A; Heida, K Y; Painter, R C; Limpens, J; Laven, J S E; Roeters van Lennep, J E; Roseboom, T J; Hoek, A",Human reproduction update,420,17

Endoscopic mucosal biopsy results are often negative, making diagnosis difficult. In these cases, endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) biopsy is a useful diagnostic method. PATIENT CONCERNS A 78-year-old female was admitted to hospital due to dysphagia, and gastroscopy showed a concentric narrowing of the esophageal lumen with a smooth and undamaged esophageal mucosa. DIAGNOSES Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) revealed that the esophageal mucosa was thickened with a low echo, and the layers of the esophageal wall could not be clearly distinguished. Cytologic and pathologic diagnoses were obtained through EUS-FNA, which suggested ESCC. INTERVENTIONS According to the pathologic diagnosis obtained by EUS-FNA, surgery or radiotherapy were recommended for this patient. Eventually, this patient elected to seek treatment at another medical institution. OUTCOMES This type of disease cannot be diagnosed according to gastroscopic biopsy alone, and the diagnosis was eventually confirmed through EUS-FNA. LESSONS When an imaging examination suggests a possible malignant lesion of the oesophagus, EUS-FNA may be considered if the surface mucosa contains no endoscopic damage. EUS-FNA has high diagnostic value with high sensitivity, minimal invasiveness, and high safety.","Pan, Hanghai; Zhou, XinXin; Zhao, Fei; Lou, Guochun",Medicine,420,16

METHODS Two hundred twenty infants (440 ears) were examined through AEP test once, and 47 (94 ears) of them went back for a second examination and were diagnosed with viral meningitis. The first AEP tests were compared with the second results in 47 infants. I latency, V latency, I-III interpeak latency (IPL), and III-V IPL were checked. RESULTS In the first AEP test conducted on 440 ears, the average values of I and V latency and I-III IPL were delayed as compared with normal values. The second AEP results were conducted on 47 infants 92.36 days after the first exam. I latency and V latency of second exam were improved significantly (p < 0.05), but I-III and III-V IPL showed no significant changes. Two hearing impaired patients (4 ears) were confirmed through chart reviews. CONCLUSION The AEP test is a helpful study for early detection of hearing problem. However, in this study, AEP test was too sensitive in acute period, and later, the incidence rate of hearing impairment was relatively low. Therefore, age of onset, severity of neurologic symptom, and clinical examination must be considered before the AEP test.","Kim, Howard; Kim, Mi Woon; Nam, Du Hyeon; Kang, Eun Young; Yang, Hoe Saeng",Child's nervous system : ChNS : official journal of the International Society for Pediatric Neurosurgery,420,17

Patients with cancer are at significantly increased risk compared with the general population. Telemedicine represents a common strategy to prevent viral spread. We sought to evaluate patient with cancer and physician perceptions of telemedicine during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS A 16-question survey was e-mailed to 1,843 active e-mails of patients presenting to one of the six cancer clinics at a comprehensive cancer care center from January 1, 2020, to June 1, 2020. A six-question survey was e-mailed to attending physicians of those clinics. Specialties included Medical Oncology, Hematology-Oncology, Surgical Oncology, Urological Oncology, and Gynecologic Oncology. RESULTS Three hundred seventy-four patients (20.3%) and 14 physicians (66.7%) responded. Most (68.2%) currently prefer in-person visits, and 80.4% prefer in-person visits following pandemic resolution. More than half (52.2%) of patients preferring virtual visits do so because of convenience. Most (63.1%) patients with cancer are comfortable with a complete physical examination. Surgical patients are more likely to prefer a complete examination (P = .0476). Physicians prefer in-person visits (64.2%) and believe that virtual visits maybe or probably do not provide comparable care (64.2%). 71.4% believe that virtual visits help prevent the spread of infectious disease. CONCLUSION Given preferences for in-person visits, cancer care teams should be prepared to continue providing in-person visits for many of their patients. The discrepancy between patient and provider concern for spread of infectious disease represents an area where patients may benefit from increased education. Providers should feel comfortable performing physical examinations at their own discretion.","Wehrle, Chase J; Lee, Sang W; Devarakonda, Aditya K; Arora, Tania K",JCO clinical cancer informatics,420,1

The data show that the pandemic in Brazil has grown rapidly since February 25th (date of the first reported case). Furthermore, the lethality rate of COVID-19 in Brazil is greater than in many other Latin American countries (Chile, Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay). However, the number of new confirmed cases in Brazil has little statistical relevance because only a small part of the population has been tested. In relation to Brazilian municipalities, we highlight the 10 states with the highest lethality rates, ranked from highest to lowest. Also, predictions about the increaseor decrease innew cases and deaths for states and capital cities are presented. These results can help managers and researchers to better guide their decisions regarding COVID-19.","Marinho, Pedro Rafael D; Cordeiro, Gauss M; Coelho, Hemílio F C; Brandão, Simone Cristina S",Cytokine & growth factor reviews,420,16

Several NDV vaccine vectors have been generated, and their immunogenicities have been investigated with different animal models. However, a systematic study to evaluate the optimal insertion site of the foreign antigens into NDV that results in enhanced immune responses specific to the antigen has not yet been conducted. In this article, we describe the ability of NDV expressing HIV Gag to generate a Gag-specific immune response in mice. We also have determined the optimal insertion site into the NDV genome by generating recombinant NDV-HIVGag viruses in which HIV gag was located at different transcriptional positions throughout the NDV viral genome. All recombinant viruses were viable, grew to similar titers in embryonated chicken eggs, and expressed Gag in a stable manner. Our in vivo experiments revealed that higher HIV Gag protein expression positively correlates with an enhanced CD8(+) T-cell-mediated immune response and protective immunity against challenge with vaccinia virus expressing HIV Gag. We also inserted a codon-optimized version of HIV gag in the described best location, between the P and M genes. Virus expressing the codon-optimized version of HIV gag induced a higher expression of the protein and an enhanced immune response against HIV Gag in mice. These results indicate that strategies directed toward increasing antigen expression by NDV result in enhanced immunogenicity and vaccine efficacy.","Carnero, Elena; Li, Wenjing; Borderia, Antonio V; Moltedo, Bruno; Moran, Thomas; García-Sastre, Adolfo",Journal of virology,420,2

The first case was a woman with a large cystic papillary lesion of the distal pancreas. The other patient was a woman with a pancreatic mass on the tail of the pancreas. Both patients were operated on using SPLDP. Five trocars were used in the first case and four trocars were used in the second case. Thirty degree telescope visualization and LigaSure dissection were used during the operation. The splenic vessels were dissected, but the short gastric vessels were preserved. The pancreas was transected by one Endo GIA stapler and the cut edge of the pancreas was reinforced with sutures to prevent a pancreatic fistula. We performed the same technique in both cases. However, in the first case, we aspirated the content of the cystic mass of the pancreas before removing it to avoid making a large incision. The duration of the operation was 190 and 135 minutes, respectively. There were no postoperative complications. SPLDP is a safe, effective modality for managing lesions of the distal pancreas. If the splenic vessels are transected, the short gastric vessels must be protected to ensure the viability of the spleen.","Topgül, Koray; Yürüker, S Savaş; Koca, Bülent; Kesicioğlu, Tuğrul",Ulusal cerrahi dergisi,420,1

Our aim was to evaluate the results of embolization only in a cohort of patients who were enrolled in the A Randomized Trial of Unruptured Brain Arteriovenous Malformations (ARUBA) study at 39 clinical sites in 9 countries. MATERIALS AND METHODS We analyzed the rates and severity of stroke and death in patients who underwent embolization only. Events were identified through in-person neurologic follow-up visits performed at 6-month intervals during the first 2 years and annually, with telephone contact every 6 months thereafter. All event-related data were reviewed by independent adjudicators. RESULTS Among 30 patients who had embolization planned, 26 underwent embolization only. A total of 13 stroke events were reported in the follow-up period among 26 subjects (ischemic, hemorrhagic, or both in 4, 7, and 2 subjects, respectively). The adverse event occurred after the first embolization in 11 of 13 patients. One patient had a major motor deficit, and 2 patients developed major visual field deficits. One event was fatal. The modified Rankin Scale score was 0-2 at last follow-up in 11 of the 12 stroke survivors. Estimated stroke-free survival was 46% at 12 months. CONCLUSIONS Although the rates of stroke and/or death were high in patients treated with embolization only in ARUBA, the rates of favorable outcomes following stroke were high during follow-up.","Qureshi, A I; Saeed, O; Sahito, S; Lobanova, I; Liaqat, J; Siddiq, F; Gomez, C R",AJNR.

Artificial intelligence has been tried to help clinicians in improving the diagnostic accuracy and working efficiency of CT. Whereas, existing supervised approaches on CT image of COVID-19 pneumonia require voxel-based annotations for training, which take a lot of time and effort. This paper proposed a weakly-supervised method for COVID-19 lesion localization based on generative adversarial network (GAN) with image-level labels only. We first introduced a GAN-based framework to generate normal-looking CT slices from CT slices with COVID-19 lesions. We then developed a novel feature match strategy to improve the reality of generated images by guiding the generator to capture the complex texture of chest CT images. Finally, the localization map of lesions can be easily obtained by subtracting the output image from its corresponding input image. By adding a classifier branch to the GAN-based framework to classify localization maps, we can further develop a diagnosis system with improved classification accuracy. Three CT datasets from hospitals of Sao Paulo, Italian Society of Medical and Interventional Radiology, and China Medical University about COVID-19 were collected in this article for evaluation. Our weakly supervised learning method obtained AUC of 0.883, dice coefficient of 0.575, accuracy of 0.884, sensitivity of 0.647, specificity of 0.929, and F1-score of 0.640, which exceeded other widely used weakly supervised object localization methods by a significant margin. We also compared the proposed method with fully supervised learning methods in COVID-19 lesion segmentation task, the proposed weakly supervised method still leads to a competitive result with dice coefficient of 0.575. Furthermore, we also analyzed the association between illness severity and visual score, we found that the common severity cohort had the largest sample size as well as the highest visual score which suggests our method can help rapid diagnosis of COVID-19 patients, especially in massive common severity cohort. In conclusion, we proposed this novel method can serve as an accurate and efficient tool to alleviate the bottleneck of expert annotation cost and advance the progress of computer-aided COVID-19 diagnosis.","Yang, Ziduo; Zhao, Lu; Wu, Shuyu; Chen, Yu-Chian",IEEE journal of biomedical and health informatics,420,1

Image noise and contrast to noise (CNR) at peak enhancement were also assessed for quality. RESULTS Forty two consecutive examinations were included: thorax (16), abdomen (10), pelvis (16). Z-axis coverage ranged from 11.4 to 15.7 cm. Mean DLP was 1288.8 mGy.cm (range: 648 to 2456 mGy.cm). Mean CTDIvol was 96.2 mGy (range: 32.3 to 169.4 mGy). Mean effective dose was 19.6 mSv (range: 12.3 mSv to 36.7 mSv). In comparison mean DLP and effective dose was 885.2 mGy.cm (range: 504 to 1633 mGy.cm) and 13.3 mSV (range: 7.8 to 24.5 mSv) respectively for the standard staging CT thorax, abdomen and pelvis. Mean tumour CNR at peak enhancement was 1.87. CONCLUSION The radiation dose imposed by perfusion CT was on average 1.5 times that of a CT thorax, abdomen and pelvis. The dose is not insubstantial, and must be balanced by the potential clinical utility of additional physiologic data. Further efforts towards dose reduction should be encouraged.","Goh, Vicky; Dattani, Minaxi; Farwell, Joseph; Shekhdar, Jane; Tam, Emily; Patel, Shilpan; Juttla, Jaspal; Simcock, Ian; Stirling, James; Mandeville, Henry; Aird, Edwin; Hoskin, P",European radiology,420,1

Postmortem lungs were sampled and studied from these autopsies, with a special focus on several corresponding sites based on imaging features.The predominant pattern of pulmonary injury in these 9 cases was diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) and interstitial inflammation. Moreover, acute fibrinous exudates, organization, inflammatory cell infiltration, hyaline membranes, pulmonary edema, pneumocyte hyperplasia, and fibrosis were all observed. The histopathology features varied according to the site and severity of each lesion. In most of the 9 cases, opacities started from a subpleural area and peripheral structures were more severely damaged based on gross views and pathological examinations. Fibrosis could occur in early stages of infection and this was supported by radiological and pathological findings. The radiological features of COVID-19 pneumonia, at the critically ill stage, were diffuse ground-glass opacities with consolidation, interstitial thickening, and fibrous stripes, which was based in the fibrous tissue proliferation in the alveolar and interlobular septa, and filled alveoli with organizing exudation. Fungal and bacterial co-infections were also observed in 6 cases.Typical imaging features can be correlated with underlying pathological findings. Combining assessments of imaging features with pathological findings therefore can enhance our understanding of the histopathological mechanism of COVID-19 pneumonia, and facilitate early radiological diagnosis and prognosis estimation of COVID-19 pneumonia, which has important implications for the development of clinical targeted treatments and research related to COVID-19 pneumonia.","Zhao, Lingyun; Wang, Xi; Xiong, Ying; Fan, Yanqing; Zhou, Yiwu; Zhu, Wenzhen",Medicine,420,31

In this study, a layered double hydroxide (LDH) composed of Ga and Sr ions on Ti substrates by a hydrothermal method, then calcined in 250°C and denoted as LDH250. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were confirmed that the LDH films were successfully formed on the Ti substrates. Importantly, the obtained LDH films can induce an alkaline microenvironment around the Ti surface and regulate the behaviors of osteogenic cells and bacteria. In vitro cellular experiments, the LDH250 can enhance the differentiation of both MC3T3-E1 cells and osteoblasts, stimulate alkaline phosphatase activity (ALP), collagen secretion, and mineralization levels. Meanwhile, antimicrobial assay against Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) demonstrated that the LDH250 samples had strong antibacterial abilities, which attributed to the release profile of Ga3+ could act as a ""Trojan horse"" to destroy the bacterial iron metabolism, inducing of local alkaline environment, and producing reactive oxygen species.

The virus requires its proteins to replicate and reproduce in the host cell. The NS3 protease converts the polyprotein to functional proteins with the help of the NS2B cofactor. Thus, NS3 protease is a promising target to develop antiviral inhibitors against the dengue virus. A systematic screening including ADMET properties, molecular docking, molecular dynamics (MD) simulation, binding free energy calculation, and QSAR studies is carried out to predict potent inhibitors against the NS3 protease. From the screening of 40 antiviral phytochemicals, ADMET properties analysis was used to screen out ligands that violate ADME rules and have probable toxicity. Cyanidin 3-Glucoside, Dithymoquinone, and Glabridin were predicted to be potent inhibitors against the NS3 protease according to their binding affinity. These ligands showed several noncovalent interactions, including hydrogen bond, hydrophobic interaction, electrostatic interaction, pi-sulfur interactions. The ligand-protein complexes were further scrutinized using 250 ns molecular dynamics simulation. The MM-PBSA binding free energy calculation was conducted to investigate their binding stability in dynamic conditions.

The identification of allergic individuals using minimally invasive, non-anaphylaxis-threatening methods is therefore of increasing importance. In this experiment, correlates were sought of an allergic immune response (IR) phenotype in pigs. Using pigs pre-treated with heat-killed bacteria or bacterial components before allergic sensitization with the egg white protein ovomucoid (Ovm), differences were determined in IR phenotype of pigs in the categories treated-allergic, treated-tolerant, control-allergic (CA) and control-tolerant. Phenotype was established by measuring immunoglobulin (Ig)-associated antibody activity (AbA), cytokine profiles and the proportion of blood T-regulatory cells (T-regs) and observing late-phase allergen-specific skin tests (ST). Although 100% of pigs became sensitized to Ovm, only 33% of pigs had clinical signs of allergy after oral challenge with egg white. Pigs without clinical signs were classified as clinically tolerant. Sixty-seven percent of allergic pigs had a positive, late-phase ST classified as very strong or strong, while 84% of clinically tolerant pigs did not have late-phase ST. Treated-allergic pigs and CA pigs had greater total antibody IgG (H+L), IgE and IgG1 AbA than clinically tolerant pigs. Cytokine profiles of allergic pigs and the proportion of circulating T-regs, did not differ significantly between allergic and clinically tolerant pigs. Therefore, measurement of allergen-specific IgG, IgG1 and/or IgE activity and evaluation of late-phase ID ST may be useful in identifying allergic IR phenotypes in swine models of food allergy, which may be extended toward human use.","Schmied, Julie; Rupa, Prithy; Garvie, Sarah; Wilkie, Bruce",Veterinary immunology and immunopathology,420,16

However, few reports of single-incision laparoscopic surgery have been described in the field of gynecology. We used single-incision laparoscopic surgery to laparoscopically assisted vaginal hysterectomy (LAVH). We performed single-incision LAVH in ten patients and compared the operative results with the conventional multiport, multi-incision LAVH. METHODS We began applying single-incision LAVH in July 2009 and completed this method for uterine myoma in ten cases. Operative time, weight of resected uterus, and body mass index (BMI) were recorded and compared to those of conventional multiport LAVH. RESULTS Comparative outcomes of single-incision LAVH versus conventional multiport LAVH were as follows. The mean operative time was 76 ± 15.5 versus 71.4 ± 21.7 min (P = 0.57). The mean weight of resected uterus was 366.3 ± 144 versus 354 ± 95.5 g (P = 0.85). BMI was 23.3 ± 2.75 versus 22.2 ± 3.76 kg/m(2) (P = 0.52).

CONCLUSIONS Single-incision LAVH can be undertaken safely and with similar operative results to conventional multiport LAVH. We consider that it is a promising alternative method for the treatment of some patients with uterine myomas as incision-free gynecological operation.","Koyanagi, Takahiro; Motomura, Satoru",Archives of gynecology and obstetrics,420,16

METHODS This is a cluster-randomized trial (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02631161). 88 patients (50-70 years) with 175 sNCCLs were randomized to receive GH or RC. Restorations were placed without mechanical cavity preparation and followed for a mean 36 (min/max: 31/55) months (variable follow-up due to COVID-19 lockdown). Restoration quality was re-evaluated at 1-, 18- and 36-months using FDI-criteria. Survival was assessed using multi-level Cox-regression analysis. Costs were estimated from a payer's perspective in Germany. Initial costs were determined based on micro-costing using time recordings and hourly costs, and follow-up costs based on statutory insurance fee-item-catalogues. RESULTS 88 patients (175 restorations) were treated; 43 received GH (83 restorations), 45 RC (92 restorations). 17 GH and 19 RC showed total retention loss, 5 GH were partially lost (p = 0.396/Cox). FDI ratings were not sufficiently different for any domain except surface luster, where RC showed higher score (p < 0.001). Costs were initially lower for GH (32.57; SD 16.36 €) than RC (44.25; SD 21.40), while re-treatment costs were similar (GH: 9.15; SD 15.70 €; RC: 7.35; SD 14.51 €), resulting in significantly lower costs for GH (GH: 41.72; SD 25.08 €) than RC (51.6; 26.17 €) (p < 0.001/GLM). CONCLUSIONS While survival was not significantly different, GH was significantly less costly both initially and long-term than RC for restoring non-carious cervical lesions. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE Within this trial, survival was not significantly different between GH and RC to restore sclerotic NCCLs. As GH was significantly less costly both initially and long-term than RC, using RC was only cost-effective for payers willing to invest high additional expenses per minimal survival gains.","Schwendicke, Falk; Müller, Anne; Seifert, Tilmann; Jeggle-Engbert, Linda-Maria; Paris, Sebastian; Göstemeyer, Gerd",Journal of dentistry,420,16

This study tested whether the 46G > A (G16R) single nucleotide polymorphism of the β2-adrenergic receptor gene (ADRB2) influences the metabolic and cerebrovascular responses to administration of adrenaline. Forty healthy Caucasian men were included from a group of genotyped individuals. Cardio- and cerebrovascular variables at baseline and during a 60-min adrenaline infusion (0.06 μg kg-1 min-1) were measured by Model flow, near-infrared spectroscopy and transcranial Doppler sonography. Blood samples were obtained from an artery and a retrograde catheter in the right internal jugular vein. The ADRB2 G16R variation had no effect on baseline arterial glucose, but during adrenaline infusion plasma glucose was up to 1.2 mM (CI95: 0.36-2.1, P < 0.026) higher in the Gly16 homozygotes compared with Arg16 homozygotes. The extrapolated steady-state levels of plasma glucose was 1.9 mM (CI95: 1.0 -2.9, PNLME < 0.0026) higher in the Gly16 homozygotes compared with Arg16 homozygotes. There was no change in the cerebral oxygen glucose index and the oxygen carbohydrate index during adrenaline infusion and the two indexes were not affected by G16R polymorphism. No difference between genotype groups was found in cardiac output at baseline or during adrenaline infusion. The metabolic response of glucose during adrenergic stimulation with adrenaline is associated to the G16R polymorphism of ADRB2, although without effect on cerebral metabolism. The differences in adrenaline-induced blood glucose increase between genotypes suggest an elevated β2-adrenergic response in the Gly16 homozygotes with increased adrenaline-induced glycolysis compared to Arg16 homozygotes.","Rokamp, Kim Z; Staalsø, Jonatan M; Zaar, Morten; Rasmussen, Peter; Petersen, Lonnie G; Nielsen, Rikke V; Secher, Niels H; Olsen, Niels V; Nielsen, Henning B",Frontiers in physiology,420,1

Laparoendoscopic single-site adrenalectomy (LESS-A) has been developed as an extension of standard laparoscopic minimally invasive procedures. METHODS This retrospective study compared the first experience of one surgeon with 70 LESS-A to 140 LA cases with respect to evaluating the influence of the inexperience on surgical outcomes and to assess this surgeon's learning curve for LESS-A. RESULTS Age, gender, BMI, percentage of patients with prior abdominal surgery, tumor laterality, and tumor size were all comparable between the two groups. There were no statistically significant differences in any surgical outcomes, including mean operative time, pneumoperitoneum time, estimated blood loss, transfusion requirements, hemoglobin decrease at postoperative day 1, analgesic requirements, postoperative day of oral intake, conversion rate, or morbidity between the two groups. The one exception was hospital stay. There were no mortalities or reoperations in either group. The morbidity rates in the LESS-A group and LA group were 4.2 and 6.4%, respectively (p = 0.528). LESS-A appears to have a steep learning curve and the operative time of the initial 70 cases decreased markedly and remained stable when the experience level exceeded 12 cases. There was no morbidity or conversion in these first 12 LESS-A cases. Multiple regression analysis revealed that surgeon experience (p = 0.008) and tumor size (p = 0.001) were independent predictors of prolonged operative time. CONCLUSIONS Surgical outcomes of LESS-A were equivalent to those of LA without compromising safety. The introduction of LESS-A at our hospital was smooth and safe. While the indication for LESS-A has been controversial, LESS-A was a useful procedure, especially for cases in which cosmesis is of paramount importance.","Hirasawa, Yosuke; Miyajima, Akira; Hattori, Seiya; Miyashita, Kazutoshi; Kurihara, Isao; Shibata, Hirotaka; Kikuchi, Eiji; Nakagawa, Ken; Oya, Mototsugu",Surgical endoscopy,420,16

The role of nutrition in the respiratory and immune systems has been studied in some studies, and its importance is undeniable. In addition, one of the key findings in this disease is high inflammation that affects almost all patients. This systematic narrative review aims to answer the question, ""Can an anti-inflammatory diet be effective in preventing or treating viral respiratory diseases?"" A systematic review search was used for the articles extraction. All studies published in English from 1999 to 2020 investigating dietary inflammatory conditions and RVI were included. Food items with anti-inflammatory properties were selected based on the definition of the dietary inflammatory index (DII). We used Google Scholar, Pub Med, Scopus, Web of Science, Springer, Science Direct, Directory of Open Access Journals, Elsevier, Taylor and Francis, ProQuest, EBSCO, MEDLINE, and SciELO databases for extracting articles. Keywords were restricted by DII. Based on DII, food items/nutrients are involved in inflammation, some of which have anti-inflammatory and some inflammatory properties. Some foods/nutrients, in addition to their anti-inflammatory properties, have antioxidant, antiviral, and immune-enhancing properties. Considering the immune system's involvement, increased inflammation, and involvement of the pulmonary system in RVI and the remarkable role of the anti-inflammatory foods for counteracting them, it is recommended to use a predominantly anti-inflammatory diet along with prevention/control and treatment protocols. An anti-inflammatory diet (based on DII) includes turmeric, ginger, garlic, onions, saffron, dietary vitamin C, vitamin D, zinc, and omega-3 are recommended to reduce infection symptoms and duration.","Vahid, Farhad; Rahmani, Diana",Clinical nutrition ESPEN,420,24

In this study, we evaluate pediatric faculty and trainee attitudes and perspectives related to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and their roles in the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS We surveyed a pediatric hospital's faculty and trainees (n = 701) in April 2020 about their concerns related to SARS-CoV-2, trust in current recommendations, and attitudes toward trainee roles. We used descriptive statistics to analyze results and compared across sex and roles using logistic regression. RESULTS Among 320 respondents (46% response rate), 73% were concerned with personal risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and 88% were concerned with loved ones' risk. Twenty-four percent were concerned because of personal risk factors. Nearly half expressed concerns as their family's major provider and about salary changes (48% and 46%). Seventy-nine percent were concerned about lack of personal protective equipment and 43% about redeployment. Respondents endorsed varying levels of trust in recommendations related to COVID-19. Nearly three-fourths (72%) felt trainees are essential personnel. The majority were receptive to returning to usual patient care and training as the pandemic progresses. Significant differences exist across sex and roles related to levels of concern, trust, and trainee roles. CONCLUSIONS In this study, we assess the concerns and perspectives of pediatric faculty and trainees related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Most view trainees as essential personnel and recognize the importance of direct patient care in their training. These results can be used to inform policy changes and trainee roles as the COVID-19 pandemic progresses.","Kazmerski, Traci M; Friehling, Erika; Sharp, Eleanor A; Muzumdar, Ishan; Corbera-Hincapie, Montserrat; Dewar, Stephanie; Nowalk, Andrew; Srinath, Arvind; Muzumdar, Hiren",Hospital pediatrics,420,7

Our purpose was to evaluate surgical triple-bundle technique in selected patients with full subcutaneous rupture of Achilles tendon. METHODS Sixty-six consecutive patients (56 men, 10 women; age range 20-61 years) with full unilateral rupture of the Achilles tendon were surgically treated by the triple-bundle technique. Seventy-four percent of the lesions occurred during sport activity. Each patient was assessed by: (1) The American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) score; (2) the Leppilahti score; (3) the range of movement measurement of ankle joint; (4) ipsilateral thigh, calf, and ankle circumferences compared to the contralateral limb; (5) functional evaluation with isokinetic dynamometry of both limbs. RESULTS 80.3% of the patients were fully satisfied (AOFAS ≥90) with treatment and resumed their previous level of sport. Concerning the outcomes, (1) the mean AOFAS score at 36 months was 93.9; (2) the mean Leppilahti score at 36 months was 91.8; (3) the mean difference in dorsiflexion and plantarflexion between the healthy side and the operated side was 4.3° and 6.9°, respectively. We observed calf muscle hypotrophy in two cases and scar complication in one. No re-ruptures occurred. Isokinetic tests performed 36 months after surgery showed a good restoration of plantarflexion. At univariate analysis AOFAS was influenced by age and difference between the healthy side and the operated side in dorsiflexion, plantarflexion, and circumference at all three levels and strenght at 60°/s. At univariate analysis, Leppilahti score confirmed the significant parameters of the AOFAS with the exception of age and difference of thigh circumference. The only predictive parameters in multivariate analysis were dorsiflexion difference (O.R. = 0.831; 95% C.I. 0.694-0.995; p = 0.044) and plantarflexion difference (O.R. = 0.777; 95% C.I. 0.631-0.958; p = 0.018). CONCLUSION In this case series the triple-bundle technique showed a low rate of complications and good functional restore tested with isokinetic tests. For these reasons afforded by biomechanical strength test reported in literature, this technique has to be considered a valid choice for the treatment of Achilles tendon rupture in young patients with a high level of sport activity.","Bevoni, R; Angelini, A; D'Apote, G; Berti, L; Fusaro, I; Ellis, S; Schuh, R; Girolami, M",Injury,420,5

The molecular interactions between the Chl-PEO-Trp and PC were characterized by HATR-FTIR, DSC, NMR, DLS and zeta (ζ) potential techniques. The Chl-PEO-Trp polymer yield was 75%. FTIR and DSC data showed that the motion of almost all PC groups was restricted by the polymer, and it promoted a decrease of the trans-gauche isomerization of the PC methylene, restricting the mobility of the hydrophobic region of the liposomes. NMR analyses indicated a Chl-PEO-Trp-induced restriction in the rotation of the PC phosphorus and a discreet increase of the hydrogen mobility of the choline. Despite this increase in the rotation of the choline, DLS and ζ-potential analyses suggested a reorientation of the choline group toward the system surface, which contributed, along with the other physico-chemical effects, to a globally packed membrane arrangement and reduced liposome size. Data described in this work were correlated to possible applications of the Chl-PEO-Trp in its free or PC liposome-loaded forms in the diagnosis and therapy of cancer, SARS caused by coronaviruses, and central nervous system-related diseases.","Cardoso Dos Santos, Marinalva; Silva de Farias, Bruna; da Costa Cabrera, Diego; Roberto Sant'Anna Cadaval Junior, Tito; Antonio de Almeida Pinto, Luiz; Gonçalves Dal-Bó, Alexandre; de Lima, Vânia Rodrigues",Chemistry and physics of lipids,420,1

METHODS Patients with large unresectable solitary HCCs primarily treated by RFA or TACE were reviewed. The primary endpoint was overall survival. Secondary endpoints were tumour response, time to disease progression, and treatment-related morbidity and mortality. RESULTS There were 15 patients in the RFA group. Of these, 12 achieved complete ablation, one had ablation site recurrence, and five developed complications. Median disease-free survival in this group was 13.0 months (range: 2.8-38.0 months). The TACE group included 26 patients, of whom four obtained a partial response, none achieved a complete response, and five developed complications. The median time to disease progression in this group was 8.0 months (range: 1.0-68.0 months). There were no hospital deaths in this series. Median survival was 39.8 months in the RFA group and 19.8 months in the TACE group (P = 0.257). Rates of 1-, 2- and 5-year survival were 93.3%, 86.2% and 20.9%, respectively, in the RFA group and 73.1%, 40.6% and 18.3%, respectively, in the TACE group. CONCLUSIONS Both RFA and TACE are feasible treatments for large unresectable solitary HCCs. Both modes show comparable rates of complications and longterm survival, but RFA achieves better initial tumour control and results in better short-term survival.","Dai, Wing Chiu; Cheung, Tan To; Chok, Kenneth S H; Chan, Albert C Y; Sharr, William W; Tsang, Simon H Y; Yuen, Wai Key; Chan, See Ching; Fan, Sheung Tat; Lo, Chung Mau; Poon, Ronnie T P",HPB : the official journal of the International Hepato Pancreato Biliary Association,420,31

RECENT FINDINGS New autoantibody specificities have been reported including a MSA directed against eukaryotic initiation factor 3 and a myositis-associated autoantibody directed against heat shock factor 1. The association of anti-TIF1γ with cancer-associated dermatomyositis dependent on age has been confirmed in several large cohorts. Despite MSAs being almost entirely mutually exclusive, several myositis autoantigens are overexpressed in regenerating muscle and do not correlate with the corresponding MSA in any one patient. Further mechanisms may determine the final MSA specificity and are likely to include the need for autoantigen processing and presentation with adaptive T-cell help. The presence of CD4-positive T cells specific for histidyl tRNA synthetase protein in bronchial lavage fluid from antisynthetase patients lends support to this view. Finally, it is widely held that MSA do play an important role in clinical practice among some evidence and concern about commercial assay reliability.

We report the safety and effectiveness of transvenous lead extraction in Chinese octogenarian patients. HYPOTHESIS Transvenous lead extraction can be performed safely and successfully in the Chinese octogenarians. METHODS We retrospectively identified all patients who underwent TLE at our institution between March 2013 and January 2021. This population was divided into the following two groups based solely on age: octogenarians and non-octogenarians. These two groups were compared on the basis of several characteristics and clinical outcomes. RESULTS Consecutive 1106 patients were analyzed, including 184 (16.6%) octogenarians and 922(83.4%) non-octogenarians. The octogenarians presented more comorbidities. A total of 378 leads and 2004 leads were removed from the patients in the octogenarian group and non-octogenarian group, respectively. The mean lead implant duration was 6.1 ± 5.1 and 5.8 ± 4.6 years for octogenarians and non-octogenarians (p = 0.296). The majority of the patients in both groups underwent TLE through the femoral approach (67.5% vs 61.6%, p = 0.14). The complete procedure success rate was similar between the octogenarian and non-octogenarian group (96.7% vs.95.3%, p = 0.39). There were no differences with respect to the proportion of minor, major complications and deaths. Long-term mortality (median time 3.3 years) after TLE in octogenarians was significantly higher compared with younger individuals. CONCLUSIONS At experienced centers, transvenous lead extraction can be performed safely in Chinese octogenarians with procedural success rate and complication rate comparable to younger individuals.","Zhou, Xu; Ze, Feng; Li, Xuebin; Wang, Bin",Clinical cardiology,420,1

This phenomenon was observed in animal trials of experimental vaccines against SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV that were developed based on inactivated coronavirus or vector constructs expressing the spike protein (S) of the virion. The substitution and glycosylation of certain amino acids in the antigenic determinants of the S-protein, as well as its conformational changes, can lead to the same effect in a new experimental vaccine against SARS-CoV-2. This review outlines approaches for developing vaccines against the new SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus that are based on non-pathogenic viral vectors. For efficient prevention of infections caused by respiratory pathogens the ability of the vaccine to stimulate mucosal immunity in the respiratory tract is important. Such a vaccine can be developed using non-pathogenic Sendai virus vector, since it can be administered intranasally and induce a mucosal immune response that strengthens the antiviral barrier in the respiratory tract and provides reliable protection against infection. The mucosal immunity and the production of IgA antibodies accompanying its development reduces the likelihood of developing an antibody-dependent infection enhancement, which is usually associated only with immunopathological IgG antibodies.","Zaichuk, T A; Nechipurenko, Y D; Adzhubey, A A; Onikienko, S B; Chereshnev, V A; Zainutdinov, S S; Kochneva, G V; Netesov, S V; Matveeva, O V",Molekuliarnaia biologiia,420,19

The controversy derives, in part, from women's relatively poorer performance in aptitude tests, many of which require skills of spatial reasoning. We used functional magnetic imaging to examine the neural structure underlying shifts in women's performance of a spatial reasoning task induced by positive and negative stereotypes. Three groups of participants performed a task involving imagined rotations of the self. Prior to scanning, the positive stereotype group was exposed to a false but plausible stereotype of women's superior perspective-taking abilities; the negative stereotype group was exposed to the pervasive stereotype that men outperform women on spatial tasks; and the control group received neutral information. The significantly poorer performance we found in the negative stereotype group corresponded to increased activation in brain regions associated with increased emotional load. In contrast, the significantly improved performance we found in the positive stereotype group was associated with increased activation in visual processing areas and, to a lesser degree, complex working memory processes. These findings suggest that stereotype messages affect the brain selectively, with positive messages producing relatively more efficient neural strategies than negative messages.","Wraga, Maryjane; Helt, Molly; Jacobs, Emily; Sullivan, Kerry",Social cognitive and affective neuroscience,420,12

The main alternative is to conduct virtual academic detailing delivered through web-based technology, but this approach is fraught with many challenges. This study aimed to examine the feasibility and acceptability of a virtual academic detailing program implemented among health care providers. METHODS The academic detailing program focused on appropriate opioid prescribing and chronic non-cancer pain management among a sample of providers. An initial in-person visit was followed by a virtual visit up to 8 weeks later. Videoconferencing was used to conduct the virtual visit with telephone as a backup. Feasibility was assessed whether the virtual visits could happen, and acceptability was assessed by provider satisfaction. Validated measures of Provider Satisfaction with Academic Detailing (PSAD) and Detailer Assessment of Visit Effectiveness (DAVE) with a 5-point Likert-type scale were used. Higher scores corresponded to higher satisfaction and greater perceived effectiveness. Non-parametric and parametric statistical tests were used to compare instrument summary scores across visits and between groups. Pairwise analyses across visits only included instrument responses for providers who participated in both visits and completed both surveys in their entirety. RESULTS There were 127 (90 %) initial in-person visits completed out of 141 visits scheduled, with a survey response rate of 96 %. Out of 120 virtual follow-up visits scheduled, 92 (77 %) were conducted, and 56 surveys (61 %) were collected. There was a high level of satisfaction with the initial and follow up virtual academic detailing visits, though, among providers who participated in both visits and had completed surveys (n = 50), initial visits had slightly higher scores (mean difference = -2.94 [95 % Confidence intervals: -4.38, -1.50], p < 0.001). There was no significant difference in detailer perception across the two visits as seen in the scale summary score (0.05 [-0.56, 0.66], p = 0.86) and two individually reported items related to feasibility (0.07 [-0.29, 0.42], p = 0.72) and conversation (-0.05 [-0.28, 0.17], p = 0.63). Forty-one (44.6 %) virtual visits were conducted using WebEx, where video and screen sharing of visit content was possible, while the remaining 51 (55.4 %) were conducted using a telephone. There was no significant difference in provider satisfaction between WebEx vs. telephone visits (-1.47 [-4.99, 2.05], p = 0.82). Provider satisfaction was also not impacted by any technical difficulties as reported by the detailer (-0.04 [-3.30, 3.38], p = 0.98). CONCLUSION The results slightly favor in-person visits and suggest that virtual detailing visits need to incorporate strategies that minimize technical difficulties and prevent participants from defaulting to less favorable technology. Future research opportunities include evaluating the effectiveness of a virtual versus in-person delivery of AD program on outcomes such as providers' opioid prescribing behavior.","Smart, Mary H; Mandava, Monika Rao; Lee, Todd A; Pickard, A Simon",International journal of medical informatics,420,1

However, only 50 treated patients (44%) had laboratory confirmed 2009 H1N1. Factors associated with oseltamivir use included a younger median age (including age < 5 y), subjective fever, cough, rhinorrhea, myalgias, higher median temperature, and fulfilment of the US Centers For Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) influenza-like illness (ILI) criteria. However, on multivariate analysis, only subjective fever (p = 0.006, odds ratio (OR) 3.1, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.4-6.7) and fulfilment of CDC ILI criteria (p = 0.001, OR 3.6, 95% CI 1.7-7.5) were significantly associated with the receipt of oseltamivir. The CDC ILI criteria had a poor positive predictive value of 43% (95% CI 33.3-53.3) for 2009 H1N1.

Previously, the characterization of ice adhesion of icephobic materials by shear force is usually performed without direction discrimination along the surface whatever the surface is anisotropic or not. In this work, we studied the direction-dependent ice adhesion strength on groove-shaped micro-nano-structured aluminum alloy surfaces formed using a femtosecond laser. It is found that the ice adhesion strength on the surfaces exhibits anisotropy, which corresponds to a smaller ice adhesion strength in the direction parallel to the groove than that orthogonal to the groove. Furthermore, it is found that the ice adhesion strength decreases with the increase in groove width in the orthogonal direction, while it does not change much in the parallel direction. The anisotropic ice adhesion strength is attributed to the change of wettability and morphology in the two directions. The findings in this work suggest that anisotropic ice adhesion should be fully considered when designing an icephobic micro-nano-structured metal structure, which is of great significance to the characterization and application of icephobic materials.","Liu, Ziyuan; Tao, Haiyan; Lin, Jingquan",Langmuir : the ACS journal of surfaces and colloids,420,16

We examined changes in patterns of cancer diagnosis and surgical treatment in 2020 using real-time electronic pathology report data from population-based SEER cancer registries in Georgia and Louisiana. Methods: Bi-weekly numbers, distributions, and patterns of pathology reports were compared between January 1 and December 31 in 2020 and the same period in 2019 by age group and cancer site. Results: During 2020, there were 29,905 fewer pathology reports than in 2019, representing a 10.2% decline. Absolute declines were greatest among adults aged ≥50 years (N=23,065);percentage declines were greatest among children and young adults ≤18 years (38.3%). By cancer site, percentage declines were greatest for lung cancer (17.4%), followed by colorectal (12.0%), breast (9.0%) and prostate (5.8%) cancers. Biweekly reports were statistically significantly lower in 2020 than in 2019 from late March through the end of December in most biweekly periods. The nadir was the month of April 2020 - the number of reports was at least 40% lower than in April 2019. The number of reports in 2020 compared with 2019 also declined sharply in early November (26.8%) and late December (32.0%). Numbers of reports in 2020 never consistently exceeded those in 2019 after the first decline. Patterns were similar by cancer site, with variation in magnitude and duration of declines. Conclusions: Significant declines in cancer pathology reports from population-based registries during 2020 suggest substantial delays in screening, evaluation of signs and symptoms, diagnosis, and treatment services for cancers with effective screening tests as well as in cancer sites and age groups without effective screening tests as an indirect result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Ongoing evaluation will be critical for informing public health efforts to minimize any lasting adverse effects of the pandemic on cancer screening, diagnosis, treatment, and survival.","Yabroff, R.

The first, nationwide, subdivided into the discourse by the Presidency of the Republic of Brazil and by the Ministry of Health. The second, of the states, represented by their normative actions related to the fight against the pandemic. Some recommendations in the management of the disease have unanimous understanding. Other actions, however, do not find the same support in the national and subnational discourse, reason why the following is adopted for a more detailed analysis in this article: the organization of risk communication and community engagement; the practice of social distancing; and the use of medications to treat the disease. Risk communication is based on the premise that every public health emergency faces communication challenges and may benefit from the lessons already learned. The fact that there are different discourses among the entities of the Federation implies disorganization of information, disagreements, and a greater degree of uncertainty in the population about the disease and how to prevent it.","Silva, Cícera Renata Diniz Vieira; Bay Júnior, Osvaldo Goes; Martiniano, Claudia Santos; Uchoa, Severina Alice da Costa",Physis (Rio J.),420,24

We sought to analyze the behavior of cancer treatments and procedures in breast cancer in Brazil after the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic through an artificial intelligence platform with real life data. Methods:Data evaluation was performed using the TechTrials platform. This platform created a unique healthcare data warehouse containing hundreds of different publicly available data sources about Brazilian Public Health System and with proprietary technology, developed several analytics products that explore and release real-world data (RWD) insights. For this analysis data were extracted from DATASUS - SIA (outpatients information system). For each outcome, data from January 2011 to February 2020 were used to adjust a time series to predict values for March to November 2020. Those values were compared with the observed ones. Results: Biopsies, mammograms and procedures showed a sharp decrease (41.9%, 73.7% and 31.1%, respectively), in April 2020 (following month of the first COVID-19 case in Brazil) with some recovering in the following months. All observed values of biopsies, the number of mammograms from March to October and the number of procedures in April and May were significantly smaller than the predicted ones. Number of women undergoing chemotherapy began to decline in August and remained falling until the last month of available data.(Table). Conclusions: This study is the first one that analyzes RWD of breast cancer screening, diagnosis and treatment in Brazil as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.

We derive estimators for the infection sources and their infection regions based on approximations of the infection sequences count. We prove that if there are at most two infection sources in a geometric tree, our estimator identifies the true source or sources with probability going to one as the number of infected nodes increases. When there are more than two infection sources, and when the maximum possible number of infection sources is known, we propose an algorithm with quadratic complexity to estimate the actual number and identities of the infection sources. Simulations on various kinds of networks, including tree networks, small-world networks and real world power grid networks, and tests on two real data sets are provided to verify the performance of our estimators.","Luo, Wuqiong; Tay, Wee Peng; Leng, Mei",,420,20

Our findings indicate that stock returns of banks with higher capitalization and deposits, more diversification, lower non-performing loans, and larger size are more resilient to the pandemic. While banks’ environment and governance scores do not have a significant impact, higher social and corporate social responsibility strategy scores intensify the negative stock price reaction to COVID-19. We further observe that the pandemic-induced reduction in bank stock prices is mitigated as the strictness of government policy responses increases, mainly through economic responses such as income support, debt and contract relief, and fiscal measures from governments.","Demir, Ender Danisman Gamze Ozturk",Research in International Business and Finance,420,1

Economic inequality between and within nations significantly contributes to the chances of contracting and dying from the coronavirus. Developing nations with weak healthcare systems, workers whose jobs cannot be performed remotely, the differences between those with and without access to soap and water to wash their hands, and the ability to practice social distancing also account for the unequal impact of the coronavirus. Racial and ethnic minorities experience higher death rates from COVID-19, which has also unequally affected Indigenous peoples and urban and foreign migrants around the world. Inequality is also embedded in international responses to COVID-19, as giving and receiving aid is often impacted by inequalities of national power and influence, resulting in global competition rather than the collaboration needed to end the pandemic. © 2021 selection and editorial matter, J.

We report for the first time on the natural history of COVID-19 disease from first diagnosis, including both outpatient and hospital care. Methods: Data was obtained from SIDIAP, a primary care records database covering >6 million people (>80% of the population of Catalonia), linked to COVID-19 RT-PCR tests, hospital emergency and inpatient, and mortality registers. All participants >=15 years, diagnosed with COVID-19 in outpatient between 15th March and 24th April 2020 (10th April for outcome studies) were included. Baseline characteristics, testing, and 30-day outcomes (hospitalisation for COVID-19 and all-cause fatality) were analysed. Results: A total of 121,263 and 95,467 COVID-19 patients were identified for characterisation and outcome studies, respectively. Women (57.8%) and age 45-54 (20.2%) were predominant. 44,709 were tested, with 32,976 (73.8%) PCR+. From 95,467 cases, a 14.6% [14.4-14.9] were hospitalised in the month after diagnosis, with male predominance (19.2% vs 11.3%), peaking at age 75-84.

The literature search was carried out using Pubmed and ELIBRARY.ru databases. Results. As the analysis of the literature has shown, tissue hypoxia is the basis of COVID-19 pathogenesis, triggering the entire cascade of pathomorphological events leading to the development of multiple organ failure. A number of experimental and clinical studies (on a fairly large number of patients) reflect the positive effect of tissue hypoxia correction using succinates, both in adult patients and in children with a different spectrum of pathology associated with acute respiratory failure syndrome.

The research question is whether inbound or outbound tourism prevailed and how visa-free travel to the Schengen Area affected the number of Ukrainians travelling to the Baltic Sea Region. Two data sources were used in the study. These are the Travel and Tourism Competitiveness Index of the World Economic Forum and data from the State Border Guard Service of Ukraine on the number of foreign citizens visiting Ukraine and the number of Ukrainians travelling abroad. The study employs the statistical methods of structural shifts analysis, time series analysis, and graphical visualization. The findings indicate that Ukrainian outbound tourism was growing steadily over the study period, whilst visa-free travel to the Schengen Area had no statistically significant impact on the number of outbound tourists from Ukraine to the BSR. Outbound tourism flow prevailed over inbound. The number of inbound tourists to Ukraine sharply declined after 2013 because of the socio-political situation in the country. The analysis reveals significant changes in inbound and outbound tourism flow structures. The COVID-19 pandemic is shown to be a critical factor influencing the current state and prospects of the tourism industry. © Satyr, L. M., Zadorozhna, R. P.,Stadnik, L. I. 2021.","Satyr, L.

The COVID-19 pandemic affected healthcare systems globally, including ways OA patients were treated. Objectives: This study is to understand how treatment management of knee OA patients and prescribing behavior across US healthcare professionals (HCPs) was affected when COVID-19 impacted healthcare systems and regimes globally Methods: A multi-center online medical chart review study of patients with OA was conducted between May -July 2019 & 2020 among US rheumatologists (rheums), orthopedic surgeons (orthos), primary care physicians with a focus in sports medicine (SM PCPs), and pain specialists, practicing across hospital and private practices. Recruited from a large access panel, physicians were screened for duration of practice in their specialty (3-50 years) and caseload (35 or more knee OA patients personally managed, at least 10 of which must be classified as moderate-severe). Patient charts were recorded for the next 5 eligible patients seen during the screening period. Respondents abstracted patient demographics and treatment regimes used. Descriptive statistics were used to analyse the data Results: 275 physicians were recruited and collectively reported 1375 patients between May-Jul 2019;260 physicians were recruited and collectively reported 1300 patients between May-Jul 2020. Looking at treatments patients were receiving at time of reporting, oral medications, particularly NSAIDs, were widely used, regardless of the physician specialty. A directional increase of 6% in the proportion of reported patients deriving from sampled primary care SM PCPs from pre-COVID (Q219) to during COVID (Q220), whilst the same is not true for rheums, orthos, and pain specialists. Figure 1. Medication usage in reported knee OA patients across all sampled specialties -Q2 2019 vs Q2 2020 With regards to the usage of injectable therapy, the opposite pattern is seen -higher proportions of reported patients deriving from sampled rheums, orthos & pain specialists receiving injectables vs those deriving from sampled SM PCPs. While focusing on orthos, the proportion of reported patients deriving from them who receive injectables grew by 5% in Q220 (during COVID) vs Q219 (pre-COVID) -directionally more so than other specialties. This is possibly due to limited elective surgeries during the pandemic. Looking deeper into injectable usage amongst reported patients deriving from sampled rheums and orthos, the proportion of the total reported patient set receiving this treatment type is relatively similar across both specialties, prior to, and during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, among reported patients who received surgery, a directionally higher proportion of this reported patient cohort deriving from orthos are noted to receive injectables vs those from rheums -this is true both pre-and during the pandemic. Conclusion: From the sample surveyed, it appears that primary care SM PCPs adopted their treatment adjustment during COVID-19 pandemic differently, by prescribing more orals, while other secondary care physicians (rheums, orthos, pain specialists) focused on injection treatment for longer pain relief. Considering movement restrictions and limited elective surgeries during the pandemic, the lack of targeted treatment options for knee OA has been made more apparent. With a burgeoning pipeline, many of which are targeted therapies, it is hopeful that knee OA treaters will be less reliant on symptom remedies and can readily offer patients' longer-acting pain relief or disease modifying options to combat joint deterioration.","Baldock, D.; Baynton, E.; Hamdan, H.",Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases,420,16

The literature regarding the confluence of these global plagues expands at pace. A systematic search of the literature considering COVID-19 and HIV co-infection was performed. After five months, from the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, there were at least thirty-five studies reported from thirteen countries. These ranged from individual case reports and series to cohort studies. Based on studies that could be extrapolated to the general population, co-infected individuals with suppressed HIV viral loads did not have disproportionate COVID-19 sickness and death. At least four patients, newly diagnosed with HIV recovered from COVID-19. Current evidence suggests that co-infected patients should be treated like the general population. This ongoing living systematic evidence map of contemporary primary SARS-CoV-2 and HIV co-infection research provides a platform for researchers, policy makers, clinicians and others to more quickly discover and build relevant insights.","Masukume, Gwinyai; Mapanga, Witness; Zyl, Doreen Sindisiwe van",,420,24

Face masks can reduce the virus spread and bacterial infections as well as prevent the inhalation of industrial waste gases. Individuals who wear a facial mask over a prolonged time often reported uncomfortable feelings due to breathing resistance, heat, tightness, and overall discomfort. One of the main indicators used to quantify the level of discomfort induced by RPE is the respiratory rate (RR). In fact, RR can be directly associated with RPE-related unease since the presence of facial masks might intuitively modify the breathing pattern of the users. Unfortunately, still little is known about RR and its variability in response to wearing RPE. In the last year, the massive use of face masks due to COVID-19 pandemic fosters the development of sensors to measure RR once mounted into the medical mask. Among other, fiber Bragg grating sensors (FBGs) have gained growing attention since the intrinsic advantages of small size, lightweight, high metrological properties, and safety. In the present study, a single-use FFP2 surgical mask was instrumented by a soft sensor based on FBG to perform a longterm acquisition (i.e., 20 min) of the respiratory signal during ordinary work activities at the video terminal. The promising results confirmed the high accuracy of the proposed system in the estimation of RR with a maximum discrepancy of -0.69 breaths per minute and mean absolute percentage error of 2.88% when compared to a reference instrument.

Thrombosis is a severe complication of COVID-19 that leads to a worse clinical course with higher rates of mortality. Multiple lines of evidence suggest that hyperinflammation plays a crucial role in disease progression. This review compiles clinical data of COVID-19 patients who developed thrombotic complications to investigate the possible role of hyperinflammation in inducing hyper-coagulation. A systematic literature search was performed using PubMed, Embase, Medline and Scopus to identify relevant clinical studies that investigated thrombotic manifestations and reported inflammatory and coagulation biomarkers in COVID-19 patients. Only 54 studies met our inclusion criteria, the majority of which demonstrated significantly elevated inflammatory markers. In the cohort studies with control, D-dimer was significantly higher in COVID-19 patients with thrombosis as compared to the control. Pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis and strokes were frequently reported which could be attributed to the hyperinflammatory response associated with COVID-19 and/or to the direct viral activation of platelets and endothelial cells, two mechanisms that are discussed in this review.

This model is based on a system of ordinary differential equations in which appropriate conditions and starting parameter values such as transmission rates and recovery rates are considered known. These parameters are utilized to obtain a simulation of COVID-19 behavior, in order to establish a possible solution to avoid a greater chance of disease transmission. On the proposed scheme, we use a neural impulsive inverse optimal control for a complex network in which the dynamic of each node is a discrete version of SIR model that describe the dynamics of COVID-19. The neural network is trained with an extended Kalmans filter and is used as a neural identifier for the selected nodes of the system. The control law used represents a hypothetical treatment for COVID-19.

The U.S. was the case study for this research (Latitude: 37.0902 {degrees} N and Longitude: 95.7129 {degrees} W). The principle employed in the design of the influenza forecast model was the Integrated Independent System of Disease Prediction (IISDP), where the functionality of one forecast model depends on the predictive capacity of one or more forecast models. It was predicted that 49,734,427 individuals will be infected in 2021 out of the current estimation of 322,900.000 U.S. citizens (only about 1.5 percent of the total population).

The outbreak of coronavirus in 2019 occurred close to the Spring Festival in China, when many rural-to-urban workers moved to their hometowns, resulting in increased household (HH) consumption of solid fuels for space heating in the rural north. In this study, field measurements of HH PM2.5 (particulate matter with an aerodynamic size ⩽2.5 μm) from a rural village were performed to evaluate changes in indoor, outdoor, and total exposure during the quarantine. Both indoor and outdoor PM2.5 were, as expected, higher during the heating period than during the non-heating period, resulting in much more exposure during the heating season. Indoor exposure accounted for up to 87% and 95% of the total PM2.5 exposure during the non-heating and heating periods, respectively. The contributions of indoor exposure associated with internal sources were 46% and 66%, respectively. Indoor coal combustion resulted in an increment of about 62 ± 12 μg m−3 in indoor PM2.5 exposure. Due to the quarantine, the indoor-originated PM2.5 exposure increased by 4 μg m−3 compared to that during the heating period before the lockdown. In comparison with the exposure before the quarantine during the heating period, the outdoor exposure decreased by 5 μg m−3 during the quarantine, which was mainly attributable to much less time spent outdoors, although the outdoor PM2.5 levels increased from 86 ± 49 μg m−3 to 104 ± 85 μg m−3. However, the overall exposure increased by 13 μg m−3 during the quarantine, resulting from the changes in outdoor exposure (−5 μg m−3), outdoor-originated indoor PM2.5 exposure (+9 μg m−3), PM2.5 from indoor sources before the quarantine (+5 μg m−3), and quarantine-induced indoor PM2.5 increments (+4 μg m−3). The increase in air pollution exposure during quarantine deepened concerns about the issue of HH air pollution and the clean HH energy transition actions required to eliminate traditional solid fuels.","Li, Jianpeng Men Yatai Liu Xinlei Luo Zhihan Li Yaojie Shen Huizhong Chen Yilin Cheng Hefa Shen Guofeng Shu Tao",Environmental Research Letters,420,10

This increase was triggered by the implementation of the new normal, long holidays and uncontrolled crowds. And none of this is accompanied by enforcement of health protocol laws (wearing masks, washing hands, maintaining distance and not crowding). This paper examines the legal constraints of enforcing health protocols with normative legal method through library research. The results of his research show firstly, the absence of positive laws that can be used as the basis for law enforcement of health protocols, causing bias in its implementation and health protocols regulated by the Minister of Health Regulation which is not part of the source of positive Indonesian law. Second, the recently issued legal regulations to regulate the enforcement of health protocols are not in accordance with the legal hierarchy prevailing in the Indonesian legal system. Third, specifically for crowd management, the police did not use their authority in accordance with the Criminal Code because it was not prepared to control the Covid-19 crowd, causing multiple interpretations and becoming polemic in the political realm. This study suggests that the Government of Indonesia enact a Government Regulation in Lieu of a Law on Health Protocol Enforcement and provide additional authority to regional heads (governors and regents/mayors) in determining disaster emergencies to also issue regional head regulations in lieu of regional regulations and so that district governments/city and province to propose regent/mayor and governor regulations to become regional regulations that get parliamentary approval.","Husni, Syahbandir M.; Kadir, M.

Current studies have primarily focused on detecting hate speech in one language due to the complexity of the task;however, hate speech has no boundaries across the languages and geographies in the real world nowadays. This demands further investigation on multilingual hate speech detection methods, with strong requirements for model interpretability to effectively understand the context of the model errors. In this paper, we propose a Multilingual Interactive Attention Network (MLIAN) model for hate speech detection on multilingual social media text corpora, by building upon the attention networks for interpretability and human-in-the-loop paradigm for model adaptability. This model interactively learns to give attention to the relevant contextual words and leverage the labels for the hate target mentions from the simulated human feedback. We evaluated the proposed model on SemEval-2019 Task 5 datasets in English and Spanish. Extensive experimentation of model training in both settings of single and multiple language data demonstrates the superior performance of our model (with AUC more than 84%) compared to the strong baselines. Our results show that human feedback not only improves the model performance but also helps to improve the interpretability of the model by establishing a strong connection between the learned attention weights and semantic frames for the text across languages. Further, an analysis of the amount of human feedback required to achieve reliable and increased model performance shows that less than 4% of training data is sufficient. The application of the MLIAN method can inform future studies on multilingual hate speech. © 2021 ACM.","Vitiugin, F.; Senarath, Y.; Purohit, H.","13th ACM Web Science Conference, WebSci 2021",420,27

Here, we revealed the high programmability of crRNA-tracrRNA hybridization for Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9. By reprogramming the crRNA-tracrRNA hybridized sequence, reprogrammed tracrRNAs can repurpose various RNAs as crRNAs to trigger CRISPR function. We showed that the engineered crRNA-tracrRNA pairs enable design of orthogonal cellular computing devices and hijacking of endogenous RNAs as crRNAs. We next designed novel RNA sensors that can monitor the transcriptional activity of specific genes on the host genome and detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA in vitro.

Based on the panel data of 70 countries from 1995–2018, this paper empirically analyzes the relationship between internet usage, human capital, and CO2 emissions under different levels of economic development by using system GMM and a threshold regression model. The results show that internet usage and human capital are essential drivers of low-carbon economy development, and human capital can inversely regulate the impact of internet usage on CO2 emissions. Internet usage can increase CO2 emissions when human capital is below the threshold value, and it can significantly inhibit CO2 emissions when human capital exceeds the threshold value. In other words, with the accumulation of human capital, the effect of internet usage on CO2 emissions has an inverted U-shaped nonlinear relationship. Furthermore, the empirical analysis of high-income and middle- and low-income countries indicates the hindrance effect of internet usage on CO2 emissions is more evident in high-income countries. For both the high-income and middle- and low-income countries, the relationship between internet usage and CO2 emissions generally shows an inverted “U-shaped” relationship, first rising and then falling as human capital accumulates.","Xu, Yubing",Sustainability,420,1

Here, the decontamination and reuse of respirators are considered. Among decontamination methods, microwave irradiation has great potential because of easy access of microwave ovens. However, can a respirator be heated in a microwave oven for a certain time and then be reused? Herein, we demonstrate that dry microwave irradiation cannot heat infectious aerosols or droplets up to their deactivation temperature. The microwave absorption performance of a single aerosol or droplet was analyzed theoretically. The multiphysics simulation results indicate that a single aerosol or droplet can be barely heated under dry microwave irradiation. Experiments were carried out using a traveling wave system to verify the simulation. Following this, we simulated multiple aerosols and droplets on a respirator material, with the results indicating that the aerosols and droplets were at the same temperature as that of the respirator. Experimental measurements using a microwave oven demonstrated that the temperature increase of an N95 respirator under dry heating is less than 10 °C, which is far less than the temperature required to deactivate the COVID-19 virus. Although dry microwave heating cannot be used to heat the aerosols or droplets, microwave-generated steam has proved effective in deactivating infectious biological organisms. Therefore, to successfully decontaminate a used respirator in a microwave oven, a reservoir with a small amount of water beneath the respirator (or a steam bag to accommodate it) is essential to the decontamination process.

A 56-year-old female patient with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) with tracheoesophageal fistula is reported. She was intubated for ventilatory support 3 days after admission because of progressive respiratory distress. Methylprednisolone pulse therapy followed by a maintenance dosage was given due to persistence of bilateral pulmonary fibrosis. Thirty three days after admission, she underwent tracheostomy because of difficulty in weaning from the ventilator. Ten days after tracheostomy, she developed tracheoesophageal fistula, which was confirmed by bronchoscopy and panendoscopy. Tracheal resection and primary repair for the esophageal defect was performed via a cervical incision combined with partial sternotomy. She was weaned from the ventilator soon after the surgery and discharged 34 days after the operation. In SARS patients with persistent pulmonary fibrosis and under prolonged corticosteroid treatment, special care should be given to avoid intubation-related tracheal injury during the period of ventilatory support. The tracheoesophageal fistula, once developed, can be repaired in a single stage after improvement of the nutritional status.","Lee, Jang-Ming; Lee, Pei-Lin; Kuo, Shuenn-Wen; Hwang, Juey-Jen; Lee, Yung-Chie",Journal of the Formosan Medical Association = Taiwan yi zhi,420,19

The challenge is how to take this academic virology knowledge into a drug discovery and development domain. One approach is the use of consortia and public-private partnerships - this article highlights ongoing efforts in the USA.

To date there have been over 750 related deaths and there is clearly an urgent need to develop specific antiviral drugs to combat this disease. In this review, the authors shall focus on the molecular biology of the coronavirus and suggest how this information can be used to identify possible targets for antiviral drugs. RECENT FINDINGS Within a remarkably short period of time, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus has been isolated, its genome has been sequenced and the structure of at least one key viral enzyme has been deduced. In addition, bioinformatic analysis has predicted a number of enzymatic activities associated with proteins of the viral replicase-transcriptase complex. In some cases, these functions have been confirmed by biochemical analysis. Thus, there has been significant progress in the rational approach to anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus drug design. This approach, combined with the random screening of licensed compounds or existing compound libraries, should result in the identification of novel lead compounds and the expeditious development of antiviral drugs. SUMMARY Although the initial severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic has been controlled by conventional measures, the animal reservoir for the coronavirus progenitor has not been identified. It is therefore likely that the virus will be reintroduced into the human population in the future. When this happens, the most economical and effective way to contain the virus will be the therapeutic use of antiviral drugs.","Davidson, Andrew; Siddell, Stuart",Current opinion in infectious diseases,420,1

Laboratory-reared flies were allowed to feed on evaporated milk containing ENDV at a virus concentration of 10(8.3) egg infectious dose (EID)50/0.1 ml or on poultry feces containing an ENDV titer of 10(5.8) EID50/0.1 g. Flies exposed to either infectious food source for 24 hr became transiently infected with virus. Virus persisted predominantly in the mid- and hindgut, with relatively little virus isolated from the remainder of the fly body. Virus persisted similarly in both fly species that were fed evaporated milk containing ENDV, with a maximum ENDV titer of 10(5.98) EID50/fly for the house fly and 10(4.78) EID50/fly for the little house fly at 1 day postexposure; titers decreased on subsequent days to 10(2.38) EID50/fly for house fly and > or = 1 EID50/fly for little house fly at 5 days postexposure. Both fly species acquired viral titers greater than the infective dose for a susceptible chicken (10(3.0) EID50-10(4.0) EID50). In addition, flies fed evaporated milk containing a high titer of ENDV maintained viral titers above the infective dose for up to 4 days postexposure to the infectious food source. Flies fed on infective feces retained a chicken infective dose for only one day. The decrease in viral titer over time was significantly explained by logistic regression for both fly species (P < 0.05). The slope of the regression line was not different for the two fly species (P < 0.05), indicating a similar rate of virus loss.","Chakrabarti, Seemanti; King, Daniel J; Cardona, Carol J; Gerry, Alec C",Avian diseases,420,0

CHARACTERISTICS AND ETIOLOGY: Patients with chronic bronchitis have an irreversible reduction in maximal airflow velocity and a productive cough on most days of the month for 3 months over 2 consecutive years. An AECB is characterized by a period of unstable lung function with worsening airflow and other symptoms. Most (80%) cases of AECB are due to infection, with half due to aerobic bacteria. The remaining 20% are due to noninfectious causes such as environmental factors or medication nonadherence. MANAGEMENT Supportive care should be provided to all patients, which might include removal of irritants, use of a bronchodilator, oxygen, hydration, use of a systemic corticosteroid, and chest physical therapy. Antibacterial treatment should be reserved for patients with at least 1 key symptom (ie, increased dyspnea, sputum production, sputum purulence) and 1 risk factor (ie, age > or = 65 years, forced expiratory volume in 1 second < 50% of the predicted value, > or = 4 AECBs in 12 months, 1 or more comorbidities). A newer macrolide, extended-spectrum cephalosporin, or doxycycline is appropriate for an exacerbation of moderate severity, and high-dose amoxicillin/clavulanate or a respiratory fluoroquinolone should be used for a severe exacerbation. There has been increasing antibacterial resistance by the 3 most prevalent pathogens (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis). CONCLUSION Although all AECB patients should receive supportive care, only patients with at least 1 key symptom and 1 risk factor should receive antibiotic therapy.","Brunton, Stephen; Carmichael, Blaine P; Colgan, Richard; Feeney, A Susan; Fendrick, A Mark; Quintiliani, Richard; Scott, Gregory",The American journal of managed care,420,33

Surgical repair of the tracheal injury was impossible due to its location. The patient was managed with intubation, mechanical ventilator care, and antibiotics. She made a full and uncomplicated recovery and was discharged 18 days after the original injury. When suspicious symptoms appear in patients receiving mechanical ventilation support, an immediate and accurate diagnostic process should be undertaken to rule out endotracheal tube-related tracheal injuries and to avoid potentially lethal complications.","Hyeon Oh, Joo; Jun Hong, Sung; Soo Kang, Sang; Mi Hwang, Sung",Anesthesiology and pain medicine,420,16

Hemocytes, lymphoid organs (LO) and gills were the main focus of the study. After injection with YHV, onset of mortality varied from 36 h onward. By normal hematoxylin and eosin staining, the 3 tissues showed clear and increasing prevalence of nuclear condensation, pyknosis and karyorrhexis from approximately 36 h post-injection (p.i.) until death, although pathology was evident in the LO as early as 12 h p.i. in some shrimp. By nuclear DNA staining with 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) and by specific labeling of 3'-OH ends of nuclear DNA using a technique called terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxy-UTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL), cells of the 3 tissues showed evidence of chromatin condensation and DNA fragmentation, respectively. Both are generally considered to be characteristic of apoptosis. In addition to TUNEL labeling, evidence for DNA fragmentation was supported by the appearance of approximately 200 base pair DNA ladders at approximately 48 h p.i. in hemocytes of YHV-infected but not uninfected shrimp. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) of LO tissue revealed features of apoptosis in tissues of YHV-infected shrimp only. These included marginated, condensed and fragmented chromatin without concurrent cytoplasmic damage. Histological, cytochemical, ultrastructural and biochemical data were consistent with the hypothesis that widespread and progressive apoptosis occurred in susceptible shrimp infected with YHV. Although no specific tests were carried out to determine whether this purported apoptosis was the cause of mortality, moribund shrimp had extensive deterioration of vital tissues such as the hemolymph, gills, heart and LO, suggesting that many essential bodily functions had been severely compromised. This probably resulted in the gross signs of lethargy and weakness seen, and it is reasonable to suggest that further, progressive deterioration could have led to the collapse of vital functions followed by death.","Khanobdee, Kornnika; Soowannayan, Chumporn; Flegel, T W; Ubol, Sukathida; Withyachumnarnkul, Boonsirm",Diseases of aquatic organisms,420,10

Recently, we have elucidated the amino acid sequence of an S determinant common in murine coronaviruses (W. Luytjes, D. Geerts, W. Posthumus, R. Meloen, and W. Spaan, J. Virol. 63:1408-1412, 1989). A monoclonal antibody directed to this determinant (MAb 5B19.2) protected mice against acute fatal infection. In this study, BALB/c mice were immunized with a synthetic peptide of 13 amino acids corresponding to the binding site of MAb 5B19.2, which was either extended with an amino acid sequence of influenza virus hemagglutinin or conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin. Both immunogens induced S-specific antibodies in mice, but only the hemagglutinin-peptide construct protected them against lethal challenge. In contrast to mouse hepatitis virus type 4 (MHV-4), MHV-A59 was not neutralized in vitro by MAb 5B19.2. Neither MHV-A59 nor MHV-4 was neutralized in vitro by antibodies comprising by the synthetic peptides. Our results demonstrated that antibodies elicited with a synthetic peptide comprising a B-cell epitope and a T-helper cell determinant can protect mice against an acute fetal mouse hepatitis virus infection.","Koolen, M J; Borst, M A; Horzinek, M C; Spaan, W J",Journal of virology,420,1

METHODS 103 asthmatics and 30 control subjects were enrolled in the study. Sputum was induced by inhalation of 3% NaCl solution. Oropharyngeal swab specimens were obtained from the posterior wall of the oropharynx. Respiratory specimens were analysed by RT-PCR for rhinovirus, enterovirus and respiratory syncytial virus and by PCR for adenovirus, Chlamydia pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Bordetella pertussis. RESULTS Sputum samples from two of the 30 healthy controls (6.7%), five of 53 patients with mild asthma (9.4%), and eight of 50 with moderate asthma (16.0%) were positive for rhinovirus. Rhinovirus positive asthmatic subjects had more asthma symptoms and lower forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV(1)) (79% predicted) than rhinovirus negative cases (93.5% predicted; p = 0.020). Chlamydia pneumoniae PCR was positive in 11 healthy controls (36.6%), 11 mild asthmatics (20.8%), and 11 moderate asthmatics (22%), and PCR positive asthmatics had lower FEV(1)/FVC than negative cases (78.2% v 80.8%, p = 0.023). Bordetella pertussis PCR was positive in 30 cases: five healthy controls (16.7%), 15 mild asthmatics (28.3%), and 10 moderate asthmatics (20%). Bordetella pertussis positive individuals had lower FEV(1)/FVC (77.1% v 80.7%, p = 0.012) and more asthma symptoms than B pertussis negative cases. CONCLUSIONS Rhinovirus, C pneumoniae, and B pertussis are found in the sputum or pharyngeal swab specimens of asthmatic subjects without concurrent symptoms of infection or asthma exacerbation, as well as in some healthy controls. Positivity is associated with lower lung function and more frequent asthma symptoms.","Harju, T H; Leinonen, M; Nokso-Koivisto, J; Korhonen, T; Räty, R; He, Q; Hovi, T; Mertsola, J; Bloigu, A; Rytilä, P; Saikku, P",Thorax,420,16

Similarly, existing viruses, from Ebola virus to chikungunya virus, are reemerging and spreading to new geographical regions. These viruses often pose a challenge for researchers to study due to their highly pathogenic nature. Lentiviral and rhabdoviral pseudotypes are excellent tools for studying enveloped viruses and have contributed to many recent advances in areas such as receptor usage, viral entry and serology. In particular, pseudotypes allow the safe study of unknown or highly pathogenic viruses. They also allow the initial characterization of aspects of infection such as cellular tropism for difficult to culture viruses. In this review we will introduce various pseudotyping systems for emerging viruses, including chikungunya virus, Ebola virus, SARS and MERS coronaviruses and Nipah virus, as well as their use in diverse studies including drug screening and antibody neutralization. We will also discuss the limitations and potential caveats using pseudotypes.","Steffen, Imke; Simmons, Graham",Current gene therapy,420,19

This has led some to insist that control measures are now urgently needed, but several recent articles have suggested that isolation of patients does not work, is not needed, or is unsafe, or that a single cluster-randomized trial could be used to decide such matters. At least 101 studies have reported controlling MRSA infection and 38 have reported controlling VRE infection by means of active detection by surveillance culture and use of isolation for all colonized patients in healthcare settings where the pathogens are epidemic or endemic, in academic and nonacademic hospitals, and in acute care, intensive care, and long-term care settings. MRSA colonization and infection have been controlled to exceedingly low levels in multiple nations and in the state of Western Australia for decades by use of active detection and isolation. Studies suggesting problems with using such data to control MRSA colonization and infection have their own problems, which are discussed. Randomized trials are epidemiologic tools that can sometimes provide erroneous results, and they have not been considered necessary for studying isolation before it is used to control other important infections, such as tuberculosis, smallpox, and severe acute respiratory syndrome. No single epidemiologic study should be considered definitive. One should always weigh all available evidence. Infection with antibiotic-resistant pathogens such as MRSA and VRE is controllable to a low level by active detection and isolation of colonized and infected patients. Effective measures should be used to minimize the morbidity and mortality attributable to these largely preventable infections.","Farr, Barry M",Infection control and hospital epidemiology,420,8

The added benefit of intra-arterial treatment might be less in these patients. The aim of this exploratory post hoc analysis was to assess the relation of CBS with neurological improvement and endovascular treatment effect. METHODS For 499 of 500 patients in the MR CLEAN study (Multicenter Randomized Clinical Trial of Endovascular Treatment for Acute Ischemic Stroke in the Netherlands), the CBS was determined. Ordinal logistic regression models with and without main baseline prognostic variables were used to assess the association between CBS (continuous or dichotomized at CBS of 6) and a shift toward better outcome on the modified Rankin Scale. The model without main baseline prognostic variables only included treatment allocation and CBS. Models with and without a multiplicative interaction term of CBS and treatment were compared using the χ2 test to assess treatment effect modification by CBS. RESULTS Higher CBS was associated with a shift toward better outcome on the modified Rankin Scale; adjusted common odds ratio per point CBS was 1.12 (95% confidence interval, 1.04-1.20]. Dichotomized CBS had an adjusted common odds ratio of 1.67 (95% confidence interval, 1.12-2.51). Both effect estimates were slightly attenuated by adding baseline prognostic variables. The addition of the interaction terms did not significantly improve the fit of the models. There was a small and insignificant increase of intra-arterial treatment efficacy in the high CBS group. CONCLUSIONS A higher CBS is associated with improved outcome and may be used as a prognostic marker. We found no evidence that CBS modifies the effect of intra-arterial treatment.

METHODS From July 2005 to December 2008, 227 patients underwent colorectal resection for cancer at S. Martino Hospital in Genoa. Sixty-one patients underwent curative rectal resection for mid or low rectal cancer using Ligasure™ device applied on smaller vessels and for the execution of total mesorectal excision. Forty-six patients underwent open laparotomy (OL), 15 laparoscopic surgery. There were no differences concerning demographics data and diagnosis, but only regarding staging (P=0.009). Primary goal was to evaluate major complications, operating time, hospital stay, distal margin of the tumor and number of nodes harvested in specimen. Secondary goal was to assess the average time of survival in the short period. RESULTS The mean operative times were shorter in the OL group (188 vs. 246 min) overall. This difference was significant (P=0.004). In particular two parameters of specimens were analyzed: the total number of nodes and distal clearing from cancer, excluding abdominoperineal resection. An average number of 16.6 nodes in the OL group and 13.9 in the VL group (P=ns) were detected; mean distal clearing in the OL group was 30.7 mm and 48.1 mm in the VL group (P=ns). There were no differences concerning major complications in either group. The hospital stay in the VL group was shorter than in the OL group, but the differences were not significant. CONCLUSION The Ligasure™ device does not reduce operating time in laparoscopy rectal cancer resection but it allows to get correct oncologic results in patients submitted to total mesorectal excision.","Scabini, S; Rimini, E; Romairone, E; Scordamaglia, R; Pertile, D; Damiani, G; Ferrando, V",Minerva chirurgica,420,16

During infection, ACE2-expressing tissues become direct targets, resulting in serious pathological changes and progressive multiple organ failure or even death in severe cases. However, as an essential component of renin-angiotensin system (RAS), ACE2 confers protective effects in physiological circumstance, including maintaining cardiovascular homeostasis, fluid, and electrolyte balance. The absence of protective role of ACE2 leads to dysregulated RAS and thus acute changes under multiple pathological scenarios including SARS. This potentially shared mechanism may also be the molecular explanation for pathogenesis driven by SARS-CoV-2. We reasonably speculate several potential directions of clinical management including host-directed therapies aiming to restore dysregulated RAS caused by ACE2 deficiency.

METHODS: The activity of a vascular surgery unit was analysed from 8 March to 8 April 2020. Surgical activity was maintained only for acute or elective procedures obeying priority criteria. The preventive screening protocol consisted of nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) for all patients and physicians with symptoms and for unprotected contact infected cases, and serological physician evaluations every 15 days. Patients treated in the acute setting were considered theoretically infected and the necessary protective devices were used. The number of patients and the possible infection of physicians were evaluated. The number and type of interventions and the need for post-operative IC during this period were compared with those in the same periods in 2018 and 2019. RESULTS: One hundred and fifty-one interventions were performed, of which 34 (23%) were acute/emergency. The total number of interventions was similar to those performed in the same periods in 2019 and 2018: 150 (33, of which 22% acute/emergency) and 117 (29, 25% acute/emergency), respectively. IC was necessary after 6% (17% in 2019 and 20% in 2018) of elective operations and 33% (11) of acute/emergency interventions. None of the patients treated electively were diagnosed with COVID-19 infection during hospitalisation. Of the 34 patients treated in acute/emergency interventions, five (15%) were diagnosed with COVID-19 infection. It was necessary to screen 14 (47%) vascular surgeons with NPS after contact with infected colleagues, but none for unprotected contact with patients; all were found to be negative on NPS and serological evaluation. CONCLUSION: A dedicated protocol allowed maintenance of regular elective vascular surgery activity during the emergency phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, with no contamination of patients or physicians and minimal need for IC resources.","Pini, Rodolfo; Faggioli, Gianluca; Vacirca, Andrea; Gallitto, Enrico; Mascoli, Chiara; Attard, Luciano; Viale, Pierluigi; Gargiulo, Mauro",Eur J Vasc Endovasc Surg,420,24

Oman has implemented non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) to mitigate the impact of COVID-19. However, responses to NPIs may be different across different populations within a country with a large number of migrants, such as Oman. This study investigated the different responses to NPIs, and assessed the use of the time-varying reproduction number (Rt) to monitor them. METHODS: Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 data for Oman, from February 24 to June 3, 2020, were used alongside demographic and epidemiological information. Data were arranged into pairs of infector-infectee, and two main libraries of R software were used to estimate reproductive number (Rt). Rt was calculated for both Omanis and non-Omanis. FINDINGS: A total of 13,538 cases were included, 44.9% of which were Omanis. Among all these cases we identified 2769 infector-infectee pairs for calculating Rt. There was a sharp drop in Rt from 3.7 (95% confidence interval [CI] 2.8-4.6) in mid-March to 1.4 (95% CI 1.2-1.7) in late March in response to NPIs. Rt then decreased further to 1.2 (95% CI 1.1-1.3) in late April after which it rose, corresponding to the easing of NPIs. Comparing the two groups, the response to major public health controls was more evident in Omanis in reducing Rt to 1.09 (95% CI 0.84-1.3) by the end of March. INTERPRETATION: Use of real-time estimation of Rt allowed us to follow the effects of NPIs. The migrant population responded differently than the Omani population.","Al Wahaibi, Adil; Al Manji, Abdullah; Al Maani, Amal; Al Rawahi, Bader; Al Harthy, Khalid; Alyaquobi, Fatma; Al-Jardani, Amina; Petersen, Eskild; Al Abri, Seif",Int J Infect Dis,420,24

The rapid antigen test showed a sensitivity and specificity of 75.9% and 100%, respectively, with a positive predictive and negative values of 100% and 91%. Symptoms as anosmia presented a high OR for the positive diagnosis for both test, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and the rapid antigen test of 8.86 (CI = 4.91-16) and 6.09 (CI = 3.42-10.85), respectively. CONCLUSION: SD BIOSENSOR is a useful assay, but some caveats must be considered before the general implementation.","Peña-Rodrígez, Marcela; Viera-Segura, Oliver; García-Chagollán, Mariel; Zepeda-Nuño, José Sergio; Muñoz-Valle, José Francisco; Mora-Mora, Jesús; Espinoza-De León, Gabriela; Bustillo-Armendaríz, Gustavo; García-Cedillo, Fernanda; Vega-Magaña, Natali",J Clin Lab Anal,420,16

An enhanced removal for sulfamethoxazole (SMX) was achieved in consortium (59%) compared to individual sets of I. pseudacorus (50%) and periphytic biofilm (7%) at concentration of 5 mg L-1. Conversely, individual sets of periphytic biofilm (77%) outperformed removal of doxylamine succinate (DOX) compared to individual sets of I. pseudacorus (59%) and consortium (67%) at concentration of 1 mg L-1. Enhanced relative abundance of microflora containing microalgae (Sellaphora, Achnanthidium), rhizobacteria (Acidibacter, Azoarcus, Thioalkalivibrio), and fungi (Serendipita) in periphytic biofilm was observed after treatment. SMX treatment for five days elevated cytochrome P450 enzymes' expressions, including aniline hydroxylase (48%) and aminopyrine N-demethylase (54%) in the periphytic biofilm. Nevertheless, I. pseudacorus showed 175% elevation of aniline hydroxylase along with other biotransformation enzymes, such as peroxidase (629%), glutathione S-transferase (514%), and dichloroindophenol reductase (840%). A floating bed phytoreactor planted with I. pseudacorus and the periphytic biofilm consortium removed 67% SMX and 72% DOX in secondary wastewater effluent. Thus, the implementation of this strategy in constructed wetland-based treatment could be beneficial for managing effluents containing PCs.","Yadav, Nikita; Govindwar, Sanjay P; Rane, Niraj; Ahn, Hyun-Jo; Xiong, Jiu-Qiang; Jang, Min; Kim, Sang Hyoun; Jeon, Byong-Hun",J Hazard Mater,420,1

STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. METHODS: A total of 2579 patients with a positive diagnosis of COVID-19 were identified between March 22 and June 3, 2020 from 18 European hospitals. Epidemiological and clinical data were extracted. Otolaryngological symptoms, including OD and GD, were collected through patient-reported outcome questionnaire and Sniffin'Sticks tests were carried out in a subset of patients. RESULTS: A total of 2579 patients were included, including 2166 mild (84.0%), 144 moderate (5.6%) and 269 severe-to-critical (10.4%) patients. Mild patients presented an otolaryngological picture of the disease with OD, GD, nasal obstruction, rhinorrhea and sore throat as the most prevalent symptoms. The prevalence of subjective OD and GD was 73.7 and 46.8%, and decreases with the severity of the disease. Females had higher prevalence of subjective OD and GD compared with males. Diabetes was associated with a higher risk to develop GD. Among the subset of patients who benefited from psychophysical olfactory evaluations, there were 75 anosmic, 43 hyposmic and 113 normosmic patients. The prevalence of anosmia significantly decreased with the severity of the disease. Anosmia or hyposmia were not associated with any nasal disorder, according to SNOT-22. CONCLUSION: OD and GD are more prevalent in patients with mild COVID-19 compared with individuals with moderate, severe or critical diseases. Females might have a higher risk of developing OD and GD compared with males.","Lechien, Jerome R; Chiesa-Estomba, Carlos M; Vaira, Luigi A; De Riu, Giacomo; Cammaroto, Giovanni; Chekkoury-Idrissi, Younes; Circiu, Marta; Distinguin, Lea; Journe, Fabrice; de Terwangne, Christophe; Machayekhi, Shahram; Barillari, Maria R; Calvo-Henriquez, Christian; Hans, Stéphane; Saussez, Sven",Eur. arch. oto-rhino-laryngol,420,16

These were coupled with shocks to the supply chain resulting from the disease. Many typically well-resourced health systems faced subsequent shortages of equipment and had to implement new strategies to manage their stocks. Stockpiles of protective equipment were held in both the United States and United Kingdom intended to prevent shortages. Method: Cross-comparative case study approach by applying Pettigrew and Whipp's framework for change management. Setting: The health systems of England and New York state from January 2020 to the end of April 2020. Results: Both cases reacted slowly to their outbreaks and faced problems with supplying enough PPE to their health systems. Their stockpiles were not enough to prevent shortages, with many distribution problems resulting from inadequate governance mechanisms. No sustainable responses to supply disruptions were implemented during the study period in either case. Health systems planned interventions along each part of the supply chain from production and importing, to usage guidelines. Conclusion: Global supply chains are vulnerable to disruptions caused by international crises, and existing mitigation strategies have not been wholly successful. The existence of stockpiles is insufficient to preventing shortages of necessary equipment in clinical settings. Both the governance and quality of stockpiles, as well as distribution channels are important for preventing shortages. At the time of writing, it is not possible to judge the strength of strategies adopted in these cases. © 2020 Weston Medical Publishing.

In this context we report on a study involving the collection of 99 samples taken from inside Barcelona buses and subway trains in May to July 2020. From this sample group 82 (58 surface swabs, 9 air conditioning (a/c) filters, 3 a/c dust, 12 ambient air) were selected to be analysed by RT-PCR for traces of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Thirty of these selected samples showed evidence for one or more of 3 target RNA gene regions specific for this virus (IP2, IP4, E). Most (24) of these 30 samples showed positivity for only 1 of the 3 RNA targets, 4 samples yielded 2 targets, and 2 samples provided evidence for all 3 targets. RNA remnants were more common in surface swabs from support bars (23 out of 58) than in ambient air inside the vehicles (3 out of 12), with relatively higher concentrations of viral RNA fragments in buses rather than in trains. Whereas subway train a/c filters examined were all virus-free, 4 of the 9 bus a/c filter/dust samples yielded evidence for viral RNA. After nocturnal maintenance and cleaning most buses initially yielding positive results subsequently showed elimination of the RT-PCR signal, although signs of viral RNA remained in 4 of 13 initially positive samples. The presence of such remnant viral traces however does not demonstrate infectivity, which in the present study is considered unlikely given the fragmentary nature of the gene targets detected. Nevertheless, best practice demands that close attention to ventilation systems and regular vehicle disinfection in public transport worldwide need to be rigorously applied to be effective at eliminating traces of the virus throughout the vehicle, especially at times when COVID-19 cases are peaking. Additionally, infectivity tests should be implemented to evaluate the efficiency of disinfection procedures to complement the information resulting from RT-PCR analysis. Modelling the probability of infection whilst travelling in buses under different scenarios indicates that forced ventilation greatly reduces the risk.","Moreno, Teresa; Pintó, Rosa María; Bosch, Albert; Moreno, Natalia; Alastuey, Andrés; Minguillón, María Cruz; Anfruns-Estrada, Eduard; Guix, Susana; Fuentes, Cristina; Buonanno, Giorgio; Stabile, Luca; Morawska, Lidia; Querol, Xavier",Environ Int,420,1

Generally, a high Treg infiltration has been correlated to a worse patient outcome, but it is still unclear how the composition of different Treg subsets affects patient relapse and survival. In this study, we used mass and flow cytometry to characterize Treg in colon tumors and corresponding unaffected tissue, followed by a correlation to clinical parameters and patient outcome. RESULTS: Using mass cytometry, we defined 13 clusters of intestinal Treg, three of which were enriched in the tumors. The two most enriched clusters were defined by their expression of the proliferation marker Ki67 and CD56, respectively. The Treg accumulating in the tumors expressed inducible T-cell co-stimulator (ICOS), OX-40, and CD39, indicating that they were effector Treg (eTreg). Intratumoral CD39+ Treg also had a higher expression of Foxp3, suggesting a higher suppressive activity, and we subsequently used CD39 as a marker for eTreg. Our further studies showed that colon tumors can be divided into two tumor groups, based on the proportion of CD39+ putative eTreg in the tumors. This property was independent of both tumor microsatellite status and tumor stage, which are important factors in predicting cancer disease progression. In a prospective study of forty-four colon cancer patients, we also showed that patients with a high CD39 expression on tumor-infiltrating Treg have a tendency towards a less favorable patient outcome in terms of cumulative cancer-specific survival. CONCLUSIONS: This study uncovers novel subsets of tumor-infiltrating Treg in colon cancer, and suggests that CD39 may be a potential therapeutic target in patients with microsatellite stable colon tumors, which are usually refractory to checkpoint blockade therapy.","Szeponik, Louis; Ahlmanner, Filip; Sundström, Patrik; Rodin, William; Gustavsson, Bengt; Bexe Lindskog, Elinor; Wettergren, Yvonne; Quiding-Järbrink, Marianne",BMC Immunol,420,16

COVID-19-related ARDS is subject to a mortality rate of 50% and prolonged period of mechanical ventilation, with no specific pharmacological treatment currently available (Infection au nouveau Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), COVID-19, France et Monde. https://www.santepubliquefrance.fr/dossiers/coronavirus-covid-19 ). Because of its immunomodulatory action, we propose to evaluate the efficacy and safety of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) administration in patients developing COVID-19-related ARDS. METHODS: The trial is a phase III double-blind, randomized, multicenter, parallel group, concurrent, controlled study in hospitalized participants with COVID-19 requiring mechanical ventilation using a sequential design. Participants in the treatment group will receive infusions of polyvalent immunoglobulin for 4 consecutive days, and the placebo group will receive an equivalent volume of sodium chloride 0.9% for the same duration. The primary outcome is the number of ventilator-free days up to the 28th day. Secondary objectives are to evaluate the effect of IVIG on (1) organ failure according to the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score at 14 and 28 days, (2) lung injury score at 14 and 28 days, (3) the occurrence of grade 3 or 4 adverse events of IVIG, (4) length of intensive care unit (ICU) stay, (5) length of hospital stay, (6) functional outcomes at day 90 defined by the activities of daily living and instrumental activities of the daily living scales, and (7) 90-day survival. One hundred thirty-eight subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to IVIG or placebo groups (69 in each group), considering 90% power, alpha level 0.05 (two sides), and 0.67 effect size level. DISCUSSION: The ICAR trial investigates the effect of IVIG in COVID-19-related ARDS. We expect an increase in the survival rate and a reduction in the duration of mechanical ventilation, which is associated with significant morbidity. TRIAL REGISTRATION: EudraCT 2020-001570-30.

The aim of this study was to analyze COVID-19-associated liver dysfunction (LD), its association with the risk of death and prognosis after discharge. Methods: Three-hundred and fifty-five COVID-19 patients were recruited. Clinical data were collected from electronic medical records. LD was evaluated and its prognosis was tracked. The association between LD and the risk of death was analyzed. Results: Of the 355 COVID-19 patients, 211 had mild disease, 88 had severe disease, and 51 had critically ill disease. On admission, 223 (62.8%) patients presented with hypoproteinemia, 151(42.5%) with cholestasis, and 101 (28.5%) with hepatocellular injury. As expected, LD was more common in critically ill patients. By multivariate logistic regression, male sex, older age and lymphopenia were three important independent risk factors predicting LD among COVID-19 patients. Risk of death analysis showed that the fatality rate was higher in patients with hypoproteinemia than in those without hypoproteinemia (relative risk=9.471, p<0.01). Moreover, the fatality rate was higher in patients with cholestasis than those without cholestasis (relative risk=2.182, p<0.05). Follow-up observation found that more than one hepatic functional index of two-third patients remained abnormal at 14 days after discharge. Conclusions: LD at early disease stage elevates the risk of death of COVID-19 patients. COVID-19-associated LD does not recover completely by 14 days after discharge.","Fu, Lin; Fei, Jun; Xu, Shen; Xiang, Hui-Xian; Xiang, Ying; Hu, Biao; Li, Meng-Die; Liu, Fang-Fang; Li, Ying; Li, Xiu-Yong; Zhao, Hui; Xu, De-Xiang",J Clin Transl Hepatol,420,16

Based on detailed patient and contact tracing data in Hunan, China we find 80% of secondary infections traced back to 15% of SARS-CoV-2 primary infections, indicating substantial transmission heterogeneities. Transmission risk scales positively with the duration of exposure and the closeness of social interactions and is modulated by demographic and clinical factors. The lockdown period increases transmission risk in the family and households, while isolation and quarantine reduce risks across all types of contacts. The reconstructed infectiousness profile of a typical SARS-CoV-2 patient peaks just before symptom presentation.

Recent research has argued that the lockdown measures generated political support. In contrast, I argue that the intensity of the pandemic rallied people around political institutions. Collective angst in the face of exponentially rising Covid-19 cases depresses the usual cognitive evaluations of institutions and leads citizens to rally around existing intuitions as a lifebuoy. Using a representative Dutch household survey conducted over March 2020, I compare the lockdown effect to the dynamic of the pandemic. I find that the lockdown effect is driven by pre-existing time trends. Accounting for non-linearities in time makes the lockdown effect disappear. In contrast, more flexible modelling techniques reveal a robust effect of Covid-19 infections on political trust. In line with an anxiety effect, I find that standard determinants of political trust - such as economic evaluations and social trust - lose explanatory power as the pandemic spreads. This speaks to an emotionally driven rally effect that pushes cognitive evaluations to the background.","Schraff, Dominik",,420,26

Unfortunately, treatment options are currently limited or even unavailable. Thus, the aim of our study was to explore the underlying mechanisms and identify potential therapeutic targets for co-infection. Methods: To further understand the mechanisms underlying co-infection, we used a series of bioinformatics analyses to build host factor interaction networks and elucidate biological process and molecular function categories, pathway activity, tissue-specific enrichment, and potential therapeutic agents. Results: We explored the pathologic mechanisms of COVID-19 and dengue co-infection, including predisposing genes, significant pathways, biological functions, and possible drugs for intervention. In total, 460 shared host factors were collected; among them, CCL4 and AhR targets were important. To further analyze biological functions, we created a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network and performed Molecular Complex Detection (MCODE) analysis. In addition, common signaling pathways were acquired, and the toll-like receptor and NOD-like receptor signaling pathways exerted a significant effect on the interaction. Upregulated genes were identified based on the activity score of dysregulated genes, such as IL-1, Hippo, and TNF-&#945;. We also conducted tissue-specific enrichment analysis and found ICAM-1 and CCL2 to be highly expressed in the lung. Finally, candidate drugs were screened, including resveratrol, genistein, and dexamethasone. Conclusions: This study probes host factor interaction networks for COVID-19 and dengue and provides potential drugs for clinical practice.

BACKGROUND: Based on the World Health Organization's direction for containment of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19), countries implemented varying levels of restrictions including closure of university campuses and providing on line undergraduate education. METHODS: Students in NSW, Australia and Kerala, India completed an online survey assessing their (a) knowledge and source of information about COVID-19; (b) anxiety; and coping strategies; (c) academic concerns; and (d) preventative behaviours. Descriptive and inferential statistics were used to summarise the data. RESULTS: Data from 99 Australian and 113 Indian undergraduate nurses were analysed. Greater number of Indian students indicated having sufficient knowledge of COVID-19 (OR 0.22; 95% CI 0.08, 0.63), getting information about COVID-19 from social media (OR 0.03; 95% CI 0.01, 0.07) and being concerned about 'attending clinical placement' (MD-1.08; 95% CI -1.94, -0.23).

Thus, the accurate assessment of antibodies during a pandemic can provide important evidence for monitoring pathogen exposure, understanding the role of antibodies in protective immunity, and helping vaccine development. METHODS: In this study, 96 west Iranian recovered COVID-19 subjects were recruited and, based on clinical symptoms and disease severity, categorized into three different groups: mild, moderate, and severe. In addition, the presence and dynamic change of SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG antibody three, four-, and six months post symptom onset (PSO) were measured. Also, the association between IgG antibody titer with clinical symptoms and disease severity was examined. RESULTS: Although in real-time RT-PCR-positive samples negative IgG antibody results were found, most subjects mount humoral immune responses that could raise a robust SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG antibody. Furthermore, this antibody persisted in the serum of most recovered COVID-19 subjects at least six months PSO and demonstrated little to no decrease. Also, specific IgG antibody titer was strongly correlated with clinical symptoms and disease severity. CONCLUSIONS: These results provide an insight into the presence and persistence of the SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG antibody. Although serological tests could not be used as the primary diagnostic test, they may support real-time RT-PCR results. Also, they could be used for diagnosing COVID-19 subjects tested later outside of the optimal period. Thus, the SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG antibody is an excellent marker of COVID-19 infection or vaccination and provides an additional diagnostic tool for verifying results and helps monitor and control COVID-19 spread.","Moradi, Ghobad; Mohamadi Bolbanabad, Amjad; Ahmadi, Sanaz; Aghaei, Abbas; Bahrami, Fares; Veysi, Arshad; Nasiri Kalmarzi, Rasool; Shokri, Azad; Ghaderi, Ebrahim; Mohsenpour, Behzad; Mohammadi, Asadollah",Int Immunopharmacol,420,1

Although this may have the beneficial effect of preventing infection, psychological distress may also increase with prolongation of the pandemic. METHODS: Geriatric patients were interviewed by telephone due to the ongoing curfew. Demographical characteristics, comorbidities, personal risk perception of COVID-19, common concerns related to COVID-19, and experiences of delayed hospital admission due to the pandemic were recorded. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) was used to assess psychological distress, anxiety, and depression. RESULTS: Participants (n = 136; 82 females, 60.3%) had a mean age of 73.4 ± 5.9 years. The most common comorbidity was hypertension (75%). Approximately 80% of the participants reported a decrease in physical activity during the curfew period. The HADS scores indicated rates of anxiety as 25.7% and depression as 16.9%. Anxiety was significantly more common in females than males (P = 0.002). Sleep problems (P = 0.000), fatigue (P = 0.000), and hopelessness (P = 0.000) were more common in participants with depression and anxiety. Logistic regression analyses showed an association between a delay in hospital admission and the presence of depression (P = 0.0029, R2 = 0.146). Personal risk perception of COVID-19 was statistically significantly higher among patients with anxiety (P = 0.0027, R2 = 0.157). CONCLUSION: Decreased adaptation to external and internal factors among older individuals may facilitate unfavourable outcomes of the pandemic.

The extremely low incidence of pituitary germinoma has resulted in a significant gap in knowledge regarding its demographics, management, and treatment outcomes. We present the largest multicenter analysis of pituitary germinomas to date, focused on analyzing demographic and management patterns. METHODS: This study utilizes the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program (2004-2016) to study patients with a primary intracranial germinoma of the pituitary gland. We analyzed demographic information and management strategies among adult and pediatric populations and conducted a 20-year overall survival analysis using Kaplan-Meier curve for a descriptive evaluation of survival outcomes between age groups and treatment groups. RESULTS: 92 patients were included in the study, consisting of 58% pediatric patients and 42% adults, with overall 60% males. 82% patients received radiation as part of the treatment, with no significant difference between pediatric and adult groups. Chemotherapy was used significantly more in pediatrics (p = 0.0002) while surgery was significantly more common in adults (p = 0.0117). The most common treatment in pediatrics was radiation + chemotherapy (47%), while the most common treatment in adults was radiation + gross total resection + chemotherapy (23%) followed by radiation + gross total resection (19%). Younger age, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy were associated with increased 20-year survival on Kaplan-Meier curves. CONCLUSIONS: There exist significant differences in the management of pediatric and adult populations with pituitary germinomas. The low incidence of these tumors makes them challenging to study, but also highlights the importance of national cancer registries in amassing sufficient patient data from which to draw evidence-based conclusions.","Bhimani, Abhiraj D; Barrington, Nikki M; Aguilar, Tania M; Arnone, Gregory D; Mehta, Ankit I",Pituitary,420,16

The new data often differs from the previously seen data due to a domain shift, that is, a change of the input-target distribution. While several methods perform well on small domain shifts like new target classes with similar inputs, larger domain shifts are still challenging. Large domain shifts may result in high-level concepts that are not shared between the original and the new domain. However, low-level concepts like edges in images might still be shared and useful. For cross-domain few-shot learning, we suggest representation fusion to unify different abstraction levels of a deep neural network into one representation. We propose Cross-domain Hebbian Ensemble Few-shot learning (CHEF), which achieves representation fusion by an ensemble of Hebbian learners acting on different layers of a deep neural network that was trained on the original domain. On the few-shot datasets miniImagenet and tieredImagenet, where the domain shift is small, CHEF is competitive with state-of-the-art methods. On cross-domain few-shot benchmark challenges with larger domain shifts, CHEF establishes novel state-of-the-art results in all categories. We further apply CHEF on a real-world cross-domain application in drug discovery. We consider a domain shift from bioactive molecules to environmental chemicals and drugs with twelve associated toxicity prediction tasks. On these tasks, that are highly relevant for computational drug discovery, CHEF significantly outperforms all its competitors.

ACORN is a cross-sectional community-based observational study of adult residents presenting asymptomatic for COVID-like illness, defined as the self-reported absence of the following three symptoms in the last 7 days: fever (&#8805;100°F), new-onset or worsening cough, and new-onset or worsening shortness of breath. SARS-CoV-2 infection was determined by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction in nasopharyngeal swab samples. SARS-CoV-2 infection prevalence was expressed as a point estimate with 95% confidence interval (CI). Test results are reported for 2953 participants who enrolled and underwent nasopharyngeal swab testing between 7 April 2020 and 16 May 2020. Among tested participants, 91 (3.1%; 95% CI: 2.5%-3.7%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2. Overall, baseline characteristics, medical history, and infection risk factors were comparable between SARS-CoV-2 positive and negative participants. Within the ongoing 14-day follow-up period for positive participants, 58 (71.6%) of 81 assessed participants remained asymptomatic while others (n = 23, 28.4%) reported one or more symptoms. Indiana had ""Stay-at-Home"" orders in place during nearly the entire test period reported here, yet 3.1% of asymptomatic participants tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. These results indicate screening questions had limited predictive utility for testing in an asymptomatic population and suggest broader testing strategies are needed. Importantly, these findings underscore that more research is needed to understand the viral transmission and the role asymptomatic and presymptomatic individuals play in this global pandemic.","Meyers, Kristin J; Jones, Meghan E; Goetz, Iris A; Botros, Fady T; Knorr, Jack; Manner, David H; Woodward, Brad",J. med. virol,420,16

Despite tremendous efforts and resources spent worldwide trying to explore antiviral drugs, there is still no effective clinical treatment for COVID-19 to date. Approximately 15% of COVID-19 cases progress to pneumonia, and patients with severe pneumonia may die from acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). It is believed that pulmonary fibrosis from SARS-CoV-2 infection further leads to ARDS, often resulting in irreversible impairment of lung function. If the mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 infection primarily causes an immune response or immune cell infiltration can be identified, it may be possible to mitigate excessive immune responses by modulating the infiltration and activation of specific targets, thereby reducing or preventing severe lung damage. However, the extent to which immune cell subsets are significantly altered in the lung tissues of COVID-19 patients remains to be elucidated. This study applied the CIBERSORT-X method to comprehensively evaluate the transcriptional estimated immune infiltration landscape in the lung tissues of COVID-19 patients and further compare it with the lung tissues of patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). We found a variety of immune cell subtypes in the COVID-19 group, especially naïve B cells were highly infiltrated. Comparison of functional transcriptomic analyses revealed that non-differentiated naïve B cells may be the main cause of the over-active humoral immune response. Using several publicly available single-cell RNA sequencing data to validate the genetic differences in B-cell populations, it was found that the B-cells collected from COVID-19 patients were inclined towards naïve B-cells, whereas those collected from IPF patients were inclined towards memory B-cells. Further differentiation of B cells between COVID-19 mild and severe patients showed that B cells from severe patients tended to be antibody-secreting cells, and gene expression showed that B cells from severe patients were similar to DN2 B cells that trigger extrafollicular response. Moreover, a higher percentage of B-cell infiltration seems associated with poorer clinical outcome. Finally, a comparison of several specific COVID-19 cases treated with targeted B-cell therapy suggests that appropriate suppression of naïve B cells might potentially be a novel strategy to alleviate the severe symptoms of COVID-19.","Wu, Yi-Ying; Wang, Sheng-Huei; Wu, Chih-Hsien; Yen, Li-Chen; Lai, Hsing-Fan; Ho, Ching-Liang; Chiu, Yi-Lin",PLoS One,420,16

High rates of implementation of most recommended measures were noted with the exception of requiring 2 m distance for students, fitting hand sanitizers in classrooms and introducing one-way systems in school corridors. Measures such as regular handwashing and stopping assemblies were considered easy to implement. Majorly challenging measures included distancing between individuals (for students: 51%, N = 99; for staff: 34%; N = 98; for parents: 26%, N = 100), spacing out desks (34%, N = 99), keeping same staff assigned to each student group (33%, N = 97) and staggering break times (25%, N = 99). Rapid implementation was facilitated by staff commitment and communication among stakeholders, but hampered by limitations with guidance received, physical environments, resources, parental adherence and balancing preventive measures with learning. Difficulties with distancing for younger children suggest that smaller bubbles with fewer distancing requirements within these may be a policy option. Schools require further financial, human resource and other support for effective implementation of preventive measures.","Sundaram, Neisha; Bonell, Chris; Ladhani, Shamez; Langan, Sinéad M; Baawuah, Frances; Okike, Ifeanychukwu; Ahmad, Shazaad; Beckmann, Joanne; Garstang, Joanna; Brent, Bernadette E; Brent, Andrew J; Amin-Chowdhury, Zahin; Aiano, Felicity; Hargreaves, James",Health educ. res,420,16

Coagulopathy has been associated with the inflammatory phase of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and might be involved in this concurrency. CASES REPORT: We describe 2 patients with previous mild or no symptoms of COVID-19, admitted for acute stroke with recent/simultaneous myocardial infarction in whom admission polymerase chain reaction was negative but serologic testing diagnosed COVID-19. In these patients, concurrent stroke and myocardial infarction could have been promoted by COVID-19 infection. Management and evolution are detailed, and their contacts to confirm the COVID-19 infection. Pathogenic analysis of possible hypercoagulation state is described suggesting the hypothesis of endothelial dysfunction as the strongest mechanism involved in thrombus formation after the acute phase of COVID-19 infection. CONCLUSIONS: Our experience with these cases suggests that patients with mild symptoms can also present thromboembolic complications once the acute phase of COVID-19 infection has passed.","Ruiz-Ares, Gerardo; Jimenez-Valero, Santiago; Fernández-Prieto, Andrés; Arbas-Redondo, Emilio; Díaz-Pollán, Beatriz; Navia, Pedro; Meras, Pablo; Alonso de Leciñana, Maria; de Donebún, Jorge R P; Rigual, Ricardo; Fuentes, Blanca; Díez-Tejedor, Exuperio",Neurologist,420,16

The rapid spreading of the virus effected, among other things, restriction on the freedom of movement. The EU member states introduced national response measures to contain the pandemic and protect public health. While broadly similar, the measures differ with regard to strictness and the manner of introduction, reflecting the political legitimacy of the respective country. With the 'Guidelines concerning the exercise of the free movement of workers during COVID-19 outbreak' - its first COVID-19-related Communication - the European Commission (EC) attempted to curb differing practices of the EU member states and ensure a coordinated approach. Ultimately, this action was aimed at upholding of fundamental rights as guaranteed to EU citizens, one such being the freedom of movement. Thus, from the very start of the pandemic, the coordinated actions of EU institutions sought to contain the spread of COVID-19 infections with the support and cooperation of EU member states. This is confirmed by the most recent Council of the EU (Council) recommendation on a coordinated approach to restrictions to freedom of movement within the EU of October 2020. While they did prevent the spread of infection and save countless lives, the movement restriction measures and the resulting uncertainty have greatly affected the people, the society, and the economy, thereby demonstrating that they cannot remain in force for an extended period. This paper examines the measures introduced by EU member states and analyses the legal basis for introducing therewith limitations on human rights and market freedoms. To what extent are the EU and member states authorized to introduce restrictions on the freedom of movement in the interest of public health? Have the EU and member states breached their obligations regarding market freedoms and fundamental rights under the Treaty? And most importantly: have they endangered the fundamental rights of the citizens of the EU?","Duić, Dunja PhD L. L. M.

While we find some limited support for lower reported fatality rates in countries led by women, they are not statistically significant. Country cultural values offer more substantive explanation for COVID-19 outcomes.

Objective: We analyse COVID-19 epidemiology and control strategies in China and in Germany, two countries which have chosen profoundly different approaches to deal with the epidemic. Methods: In this narrative review, we searched the literature from 1 December 2019, to 4 December 2020. Results: China and several neighbours (e.g. Australia, Japan, South Korea, New Zealand, Thailand) have achieved COVID-19 elimination or sustained low case numbers. This can be attributed to: (1) experience with previous coronavirus outbreaks; (2) classification of SARS-CoV-2 in the highest risk category and consequent early employment of aggressive control measures; (3) mandatory isolation of cases and contacts in institutions; (4) broad employment of modern contact tracking technology; (5) travel restrictions to prevent SARS-CoV-2 re-importation; (6) cohesive communities with varying levels of social control. Conclusions: Early implementation of intense and sustained control measures is key to achieving a near normal social and economic life.","Lu, Guangyu; Razum, Oliver; Jahn, Albrecht; Zhang, Yuying; Sutton, Brett; Sridhar, Devi; Ariyoshi, Koya; von Seidlein, Lorenz; Müller, Olaf",Glob Health Action,420,16

In humans, nine catalytically active and two inactive sPLA2 proteins have been identified. These enzymes play diverse biological roles, including host defence against bacteria, parasites and viruses. Several of these endogenous sPLA2s may play a defensive role in viral infections, as they display in vitro antiviral activity by both direct and indirect mechanisms. However, endogenous sPLA2s may also exert an offensive and negative role, dampening the antiviral response or promoting inflammation in animal models of viral infection. Similarly, several exogenous sPLA2s, most of them from snake venoms and other animal venoms, possess in vitro antiviral activities. Thus, both endogenous and exogenous sPLA2s may be exploited for the development of new antiviral substances or as therapeutic targets for antagonistic drugs that may promote a more robust antiviral response. In this review, the antiviral versus proviral role of both endogenous and exogenous sPLA2s against various viruses including coronaviruses is presented. Based on the highlighted developments in this area of research, possible directions of future investigation are envisaged. One of them is also a possibility of exploiting sPLA2s as biological markers of the severity of the Covid-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Pungercar, Joze; Bihl, Franck; Lambeau, Gérard; Krizaj, Igor",Biochimie,420,16

This enables applications of machine learning in settings of inherently distributed, undisclosable data such as in the medical domain. In practice, joint training is usually achieved by aggregating local models, for which local training objectives have to be in expectation similar to the joint (global) objective. Often, however, local datasets are so small that local objectives differ greatly from the global objective, resulting in federated learning to fail. We propose a novel approach that intertwines model aggregations with permutations of local models. The permutations expose each local model to a daisy chain of local datasets resulting in more efficient training in data-sparse domains. This enables training on extremely small local datasets, such as patient data across hospitals, while retaining the training efficiency and privacy benefits of federated learning.","Kamp, Michael; Fischer, Jonas; Security, Jilles Vreeken CISPA Helmholtz Center for Information; Informatics, Max Planck Institute for",,420,22

RESULTS: In unadjusted models, the risk of COVID-19 infection was positively associated with urinary levels of perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) (Odds ratio: 2.29 [95% CI: 1.52-3.22]), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) (2.91, [1.95-4.83], and total PFASs (&#8721; (12) PFASs) (3.31, [2.05-4.65]). After controlling for age, sex, body mass index (BMI), comorbidities, and urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR), the associations remained statistically significant (Adjusted odds ratio of 1.94 [95% CI: 1.39-2.96] for PFOS, 2.73 [1.71-4.55] for PFOA, and 2.82 [1.97-3.51] for &#8721; (12) PFASs). Urine metabolome-PFASs association analysis revealed that 59% of PFASs-associated urinary endogenous metabolites in COVID-19 patients were identified to be produced or largely regulated by mitochondrial function. In addition, the increase of PFASs exposure was associated with the accumulation of key metabolites in kynurenine metabolism, which are involved in immune responses (Combined ß coefficient of 0.60 [95% CI: 0.25-0.95, P = 0.001]). Moreover, alternations in PFASs-associated metabolites in mitochondrial and kynurenine metabolism were also correlated with clinical lab biomarkers for mitochondrial function (serum growth/differentiation factor-15) and immune activity (lymphocyte percentage), respectively. CONCLUSION: Elevated exposure to PFASs was independently associated with an increased risk of COVID-19 infection. PFASs-associated metabolites were implicated in mitochondrial function and immune activity. Larger studies are needed to confirm our findings and further understand the underlying mechanisms of PFASs exposure in the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV2 infection.","Ji, Junjun; Song, Lingyan; Wang, Jing; Yang, Zhiyun; Yan, Haotian; Li, Ting; Yu, Li; Jian, Lingyu; Jiang, Feixiang; Li, Junfeng; Zheng, Jinping; Li, Kefeng",Environ Int,420,6
225767,225767,225767,Cancer Surgery During COVID-19: How We Move Forward,17.103706,6.6292076,2020,"A few months ago a new coronavirus was identified in Cina officially named by the WHO as COVID-19. The thousands of patients who died showed pneumonia and alveolar damage, but actually, according to several authors in addition to the acute respiratory distress syndrome the virus can give rise to multiorgan failure. In fact, many people died equally despite being intubated and treated for respiratory failure. In this review, we especially wanted to describe the virus effects on the cardiovascular system, probably the leading cause of death of thousands of deceased patients. Therefore, mortality is indirectly induced by the virus through vascular inflammation and cardiovascular damage and patients with severe COVID-19 infection showed significantly increased levels of cardiac troponin I and inflammatory cytokines. The main activation of the signal pathways for the production of inflammatory cytokines are the toll-like receptors that recognize the presence of viral nucleic acids and the ACE-2 receptors, that the virus uses to infect the cells. The binding to ACE-2 also allows to promote high levels of angiotensin II by promoting high levels of blood pressure. High levels of IL-6, IL-1B and IL-8 have been associated with plaque instability and increased thrombotic risk. Furthermore IL-6 is involved in the stimulation of matrix-degrading enzymes such as matrix metalloproteinases, and may contribute to the development of acute coronary syndrome. In addition, TNF-&#945;, IL-1 and IL-6 present in patients with severe COVID-19 are associated with coagulation activation and thrombin generation resulting in disseminated intravascular coagulation or thrombotic microangiopathy. Considering these pathological effects of the virus, anti-inflammatory and anticoagulant treatments are to be considered to avoid cardiovascular events. In this regard, heparin, in addition to its anticoagulant characteristics, has been shown to have good control over inflammation and to be a good anti-viral drug.","Lubrano, Valter; Balzan, Silvana",Am J Cardiovasc Dis,420,16

However, the impact of mRNA COVID-19 vaccine on triggering de novo/relapsing glomerulonephritis (GN) is limited. We report a case series of patients who developed new or relapsing GN post vaccination. Method We evaluated baseline characteristics, vaccine type and clinical outcomes of 13 patients from our institution who had a new diagnosis or relapse of their GN post mRNA COVID-19 vaccination. Results Of 13 patients, 8 patients were newly diagnosed GNs and 5 patients had relapse. Median age was 62 years (range 19-83 years). Autoimmune disease (38%) was the most prevalent underlying disease followed by cancer (23%). Majority of patients were white male. IgA nephropathy (IgAN) was the most common GN in our series (5 patients, 38%) followed by membranous nephropathy (MN) (3 patients, 23%). One patient with IgAN had evidence of IgA deposits prior to vaccination suggesting that the immune activation following vaccination triggered a flare of the disease. Our case series also included the first case report of tip-variant focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, NELL-1 associated MN, and atypical anti-GBM nephritis. Seventy seven percent developed acute kidney injury with the majority being KDIGO stage 1 (67%). Outcome are favorable with 80% responding to therapy. Conclusions New cases and relapse of GN can present shortly after mRNA COVID-19 vaccination. New cases of IgAN may result from unmasking of undiagnosed IgAN due to robust immune activation rather than development of new deposits.","Klomjit, Nattawat Alexander Mariam Priya Fervenza Fernando C.; Zoghby, Ziad Garg Arvind Hogan Marie C.; Nasr, Samih H.; Minshar, Marwan Abu Zand Ladan",Kidney international reports,420,16

The purpose of this study was to examine the link between fast food, sugars, or soft drinks and the ongoing domestic lockdown of the COVID-19 pandemic. This phenomenon was studied in three different cities from three different countries (Saudi Arabia, Britain, and Turkey) from the perspective of children's parents. The study sought to address three research questions regarding children's well-being during the COVID-19 lockdown period. First, was children's nutrition affected during this period? Second, did children's weight increase? Third, were there any statistically significant differences in children's dietary patterns based on their gender and nationality? A questionnaire was administered to 330 parents of children aged four to seven years in the three targeted countries. The study found that most parents cared about their children's nutrition and prepared food at home (96.1%) during the lockdown. Sixty-three percent of parents indicated that children did not gain weight.

The weekly sessions were organised and led by trainees. Each week a trainee either presented a journal article or a particular psychiatric topic, with a group discussion afterwards.An online survey was sent to psychiatry trainees that had participated in the programme to determine their views. Close-ended questions were asked as well as open-ended questions for more qualitative responses.ResultThere were 9 peer-led sessions in total, with 11 trainees (out of 18 invited) attending at least one session, and an average of 5 trainees at each session.Five core trainee psychiatrists responded to the survey following the sessions. All of the respondents found the sessions either “very” or “fairly” useful. 80% stated that there should be more peer teaching opportunities as part of normal psychiatry training. All respondents found engaging with online teaching either “easy” or “OK”.Open-ended questions showed that respondents found the sessions were useful for: 1) connecting with peers during a difficult time 2) free discussion due to being around peers 3) wide interest and variety of topics.

METHODS: This study consisted of a retrospective chart review of consecutive patients hospitalized for COVID-19 and admitted to a regional inpatient rehabilitation hospital from April 29th to May 22nd, 2020. Patient demographics, clinical characteristics and complications from acute hospitalization were examined. Measures of fall risk (Berg Balance Scale), endurance (6 Minute Walk Test), gait speed (10 Meter Walk Test), mobility (transfer and ambulation independence), cognition, speech and swallowing (American Speech and Hearing Association National Outcomes Measurement System Functional Communication Measures) were assessed at rehabilitation admission and discharge. RESULTS: The study population included 29 patients and was 70% male, 58.6% white and with a mean age of 59.5. The mean length of acute hospitalization was 32.2 days with a mean of 18.7 days intubated. Patients spent a mean of 16.7 days in inpatient rehabilitation and 90% were discharged home. Patients demonstrated significant improvement from admission to discharge in measures of fall risk, endurance, gait speed, mobility, cognition, speech and swallowing, (p< 0.05).

We used dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) as a model membrane material and did simulations on both gel and liquid crystalline phases of membrane surrounded by aqueous solutions of varying alcohol concentrations (up to 17.5 mol %). While a moderate effect of alcohol on the gel phase of membrane is observed, its liquid crystalline phase is shown to be influenced dramatically by either alcohol. Our results show that aqueous solutions of only 5 and 10 mol % alcohol already have significant weakening effects on the membrane. The effects of n-propanol are always stronger than those of ethanol. The membrane changes its structure, when exposed to disinfectant solutions; uptake of alcohol causes it to swell laterally but to shrink vertically. At the same time, the orientational order of lipid tails decreases significantly. Metadynamics and grand-canonical ensemble simulations were done to calculate the free-energy profiles for permeation of alcohol and alcohol/water solubility in the DPPC. We found that the free-energy barrier to permeation of the DPPC liquid crystalline phase by all permeants is significantly lowered by alcohol uptake. At a disinfectant concentration of 10 mol %, it becomes insignificant enough to allow almost free passage of the disinfectant to the inside of the virus to cause damage there. It should be noted that the disinfectant also causes the barrier for water permeation to drop. Furthermore, the shrinking of the membrane thickness shortens the gap needed to be crossed by penetrants from outside the virus into its core. The lateral swelling also increases the average distance between head groups, which is a secondary barrier to membrane penetration, and hence further increases the penetration by disinfectants. At alcohol concentrations in the disinfectant solution above 15 mol %, we reliably observe disintegration of the DPPC membrane in its liquid crystalline phase.","Eslami, Hossein; Das, Shubhadip; Zhou, Tianhang; Müller-Plathe, Florian",J Phys Chem B,420,10

The state of the population is described as a vector in the tensor product space of $N$ individual probability vector spaces, whose dimension equals the number of compartments of the epidemiological model $n_c$. The transition rate matrix for the $n_c^N$-dimensional Markov chain is obtained by taking suitable linear combinations of tensor products of $n_c$-dimensional matrices. The resulting transition rate matrix is a sum over bilocal linear operators, which gives insight in the microscopic dynamics of the system. The more familiar and non-linear node-based mean-field approximations are recovered by restricting the exact models to uncorrelated (separable) states. We show how the exact transition rate matrix for the susceptible-infected (SI) model can be used to find analytic solutions for SI outbreaks on trees and the cycle graph for finite $N$.","Merbis, Wout",,420,16

In parts of Southeast Asia, the rise of authoritarian regimes has created conditions of impunity in which state and non-state actors have exploited restrictions during the COVID-19 pandemic to restrain activism, contain indigenous livelihoods, and intensify resource exploitation. This article explores how political control and violence against activists (defenders') under authoritarian Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte have intersected with and been reinforced through COVID-19 health measures to curtail grass-roots efforts to protect social and environmental safeguards. Since March 2020, violence against defenders has gone viral as activism in the country has been quarantined. Under Duterte's authoritarian populist rhetoric, state actors, parastatal and shadowy assassins have allegedly used public health measures to suppress activism further, enabling the harassment, arrests, and deaths of defenders and the intensification of resource extraction. Based on a critical review of news media and conservation policy, I describe the history and current context of defenders being 'quarantined' by authorities using lockdown measures to coercively suppress social and environmental activism across the country. I examine cases from Palawan Island to show how political authorities and elites have used COVID-19 to suppress defender mobility and enforcement practices and how lulls in defending and discourses of 'pandemic recovery' have facilitated mining and deforestation. The conclusion asserts that paying attention to how political conjunctures produce violent governance and local resistance reveals civil society's crucial role and vulnerabilities in protecting human rights and the environment in the Philippines and Southeast Asia.","Dressler, W.",Journal of Political Ecology,420,16

Examples include partially observed diffusion processes or inverse problems, where one may have to discretize time and/or space, in order to practically work with the probability of interest. Given access only to these discretizations, we consider the construction of unbiased Monte Carlo estimators of expectations w.r.t. such target probability distributions. It is shown how to obtain such estimators using a novel adaptation of randomization schemes and Markov simulation methods. Under appropriate assumptions, these estimators possess finite variance and finite expected cost. There are two important consequences of this approach: (i) unbiased inference is achieved at the canonical complexity rate, and (ii) the resulting estimators can be generated independently, thereby allowing strong scaling to arbitrarily many parallel processors. Several algorithms are presented, and applied to some examples of Bayesian inference problems, with both simulated and real observed data.","Heng, Jeremy; Jasra, Ajay; Law, Kody J.

Alignments of nucleotide sequences of the VP7 and VP4 markers showed a high frequency of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), with up to 294 SNPs found in 869bp of sequence at the G6 genotype (0.338 SNPs/nt), which reveals the extensive genetic diversity of RVA strains. Phylogenetic analysis of the VP7 gene of the G6 strains revealed four distinct lineages, with most strains clustering in the G6-IV lineage. The discrepancies between the RVA genotypes circulating in the sampled cattle farms and the genotypes contained in commercial vaccines currently available in Spain are discussed.

Military involvement differs in terms of missions given and of the amount of troops mobilised. It first questions the use of the military in the name of national resilience in the political discourse and the way it displays a symbolic message to the population, before analysing the role of armies in the crisis through the spatiality of their interventions.","Opillard, Florian; Palle, Angélique; Michelis, Léa",Tijdschr.

However, since mid-April 2020, clusters of pediatric cases of severe systemic hyperinflammation and shock epidemiologically linked with COVID-19 have been reported. This condition was named as SARS-Cov-2-associated multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children and showed similarities to Kawasaki disease. Here, we present a narrative review of cases reported in literature and we discuss the clinical acute and follow-up management of these patients. Patients with SARS-Cov-2-associated multisystem inflammatory syndrome frequently presented with persistent fever, gastrointestinal symptoms, polymorphic rash, conjunctivitis, and mucosal changes. Elevated inflammatory markers and evidence of cytokine storm were frequently observed. A subset of these patients also presented with hypotension and shock (20-100%) from either acute myocardial dysfunction or systemic hyperinflammation/vasodilation. Coronary artery dilation or aneurysms have been described in 6-24%, and arrhythmias in 7-60%. Cardiac support, immunomodulation, and anticoagulation are the key aspects for the management of the acute phase. Long-term structured follow-up of these patients is required due to the unclear prognosis and risk of progression of cardiac manifestations.Conclusion: Multisystem inflammatory syndrome is a novel syndrome related to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Evidence is still scarce but rapidly emerging in the literature. Cardiac manifestations are frequent, including myocardial and coronary involvement, and need to be carefully identified and monitored over time. What is Known: â¢ Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) has been described associated with SARS-CoV-2. What is New: â¢ Patients with MIS-C often present with fever, gastrointestinal symptoms, and shock. â¢ Cardiac involvement is found in a high proportion of these patients, including ventricular dysfunction, coronary artery dilation or aneurysm, and arrhythmias. â¢ Management is based on expert consensus and includes cardiac support, immunomodulatory agents, and anticoagulation. â¢ Long-term follow-up is required due to the unclear prognosis and risk of progression of cardiac manifestation.","Sperotto, Francesca; Friedman, Kevin G; Son, Mary Beth F; VanderPluym, Christina J; Newburger, Jane W; Dionne, Audrey",Eur. j. pediatr,420,21

Understanding the volume and nature of such presentations is key to future resource allocation and guideline creation. Methods Surgical handovers from a 9-week period from the commencement of the first government restriction of non-essential travel (March 8th-May 10th 2020) were studied. A corresponding time period of usual surgical activity (March 10th-12th May 2019) was studied for comparison. Results During the pandemic period, 447 referrals (mean age 54, 4.9% COVID-19 positive) were received representing a 16.5% decrease compared to 2019 (n=521). The most common referral in each period was abdominal pain (n=255 vs 259). The duration of symptoms prior to admission and overall number of traumas did not differ between the periods. Fewer referrals for traumatic brain injuries and polytraumas and more symptomatic hernias, cellulitis and blocked/dislodged lines/tubes were seen during the pandemic. Conclusion The volume of surgical referrals and admissions was significantly decreased during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Traumas and abdominal pain were unaffected. An increase in several referrals for which patients would typically visit their general practitioner or have an expedited hospital appointment was seen.","Connelly, T. M.; Bass, G.

A sample of 523 Dutch employees working in different companies and sectors completed the online survey in March 2020. RESULTS: Results showed that women, older individuals and workers with lower educational level ruminated considerably more about COVID-19.

Whilst the significant release of metal-enriched drainage has been documented during this event, the fate of these elements in receiving systems is still largely unknown. Here we investigate the spatial distribution, chemical partitioning, and potential bioavailability of S, Fe, Mn, Al, trace metals (V, Cr, Co, Ni, Cu, Pb) and rare earth elements in the surficial sediments of Lake Albert, South Australia; a system that received prolonged (2007-2011) acidic drainage during the Millennium Drought. The highest concentrations of all metals (Enrichment Factors ranging from 1.06-1.97) were observed in the sediments closest to shorelines where sulfidic material were oxidised, generating metal-enriched acidic drainage. Localised enrichment indicates metals have not been completely redistributed across the system following their initial deposition by physical (wind-driven resuspension) or chemical (diagenetic and redox changes) processes. Based on selective extraction data, these metals are likely partitioned as discrete sulfides (Pb) or are with organic material (V, Cr, Cu, Pb, REEs), Fe monosulfides (V, Co, Ni), or pyrite (Co, Ni, Pb). Lake-wide enrichment of trace metals Cr (mean concentration 57 ppm), Ni (39 ppm), Cu (36 ppm), and Pb (24 ppm) relative to other Lower Murray River sites is also evident, suggesting that metal contamination associated with acidic drainage is not restricted to near-source sites. Importantly, the mobilisation, transport, and accumulation of metals is controlled by sediment transport pathways and system hydrology and will thus function differently under varying states of geomorphology, climate, and anthropogenic modification. Our study shows that extreme drought is recorded as a lasting geochemical signature in estuarine sediments, demonstrating that metal and rare earth element geochemistry provides insights into the distribution and behaviour of contaminants mobilised into dynamic, anthropogenically altered estuaries.","Job, Thomas; Penny, Dan; Morgan, Bree",Sci Total Environ,420,29

Main methods: In the present study, 23 new annomontine analogues were designed representing ß-Carboline based scaffolds. A hypothesis on its role as an effective ligand was laid for target-specific binding in SARS-CoV-2. These molecules were used for molecular docking analysis against the multiple possible drug targets using the Maestro Interface. To ensure the drug safety of these molecules ADME/Tox analysis was also performed. Key findings: The molecular docking analysis of the 23 novel molecules indicated the efficiency of these derivates against COVID-19. The efficiency of molecules was computed by the summation of the docking score against each target defined as LigE Score and compared against Hydroxycholoquine as a standard. Based on the docking score, the majority of the annomontine derivatives were found to have increased binding affinity with targets as compared to hydroxycholoquine. Significance: Due to the lack of efficiency, effectiveness, and failure of already repurposed drugs against the COVID-19, the exploration of the novel scaffold that can act as effective treatment is much needed. The current study hence emphasizes the potential of Annomontine based - ß- Carboline derivatives as a potential drug candidate against COVID-19.","Waidha, Kamran; Saxena, Anjali; Kumar, Prashant; Sharma, Sunil; Ray, Devalina; Saha, Biswajit",Heliyon,420,16

We examined the impact of lockdown on glycemic control in individuals with type 1 diabetes (T1D) using continuous glucose monitoring (CGM); and assessed whether changes in glycemic control differ between those who attended a telemedicine visit during lockdown versus those who did not. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Flash CGM data from 101 individuals with T1D were retrospectively evaluated. Participants were categorized into two groups: Attended a telemedicine visit during lockdown (n = 61) or did not attend (n = 40). Changes in CGM metrics from the last 2 weeks pre-lockdown period (Feb 25 - March 9, 2020) to the last 2 weeks of complete lockdown period (April 7-20, 2020) were examined in the two groups. RESULTS: Those who attended a telemedicine visit during the lockdown period had a significant improvement in the following CGM metrics by the end of lockdown: Average glucose (from 180 to 159 mg/dl, p < 0.01), glycemic management indicator (from 7.7 to 7.2%, p = 0.03), time in range (from 46 to 55%, p < 0.01), and time above range (from 48 to 35%, p < 0.01) without significant changes in time below range, number of daily scans or hypoglycemic events, and other indices. In contrast, there were no significant changes in any of the CGM metrics during lockdown in those who did not attend telemedicine. CONCLUSIONS: A six-week lockdown did not worsen, nor improve, glycemic control in individuals with T1D who did not attend a telemedicine visit.

Because SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted via aerosols and surface contaminations of the environment, appropriate use of anesthesia machines and appropriate behavior in the operation room (OR) are required specifically in relation to this disease. The use of high-performance hydrophobic filters with a high rate of virus rejection is recommended as the type of viral filter, and surgical team behaviors that result in aerosol splashes should be avoided. Appropriate hand hygiene by the anesthesiologist is crucial to prevent unexpected environmental contamination. When the anesthesia machine is used instead of an intensive care unit ventilator, it is important to keep the fresh gas flow at least equal to the minute ventilation to prevent excessive humidity in the circuit and to monitor condensation in the circuit and inspiratory carbon dioxide pressure. In addition, both the surgical smoke inherent in thermal tissue destruction and the surgical team's shoe soles may be factors for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the operating room. Ensuring social distancing-even with a mask in the OR-may be beneficial because healthcare providers may be asymptomatic carriers. After the acute crisis period of COVID-19, the number of cases of essential but nonurgent surgeries for waiting patients is likely to increase; therefore, optimization of OR scheduling will be an important topic. Anesthesiologists will benefit from new standard practices focusing on the prevention of COVID-19 infection.","Obara, Shinju",J. anesth,420,1

The general applicability of the process was further confirmed by studying the optimal gradient current density output parameters, the dye concentration, electrolyte concentration and other dye compounds with different molecular structures. The corresponding results show that the chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal (78%) and the color removal (100%) under the GOP are similar to those in the COP, and the overall energy consumption is reduced by about 50% compared with that in the traditional constant current mode. Moreover, the current efficiency in the middle and late stages of EO process has increased by 8.6 times compared with COP.","Liu, Ting; Miao, Dongtian; Liu, Guoshuai; Wei, Qiuping; Zhou, Kechao; Yu, Zhiming; Ma, Li",Water Sci Technol,420,1

In this study, nitrogen-doped sludge-derived biochar (NSDB) was prepared and applied to activate peroxymonosulfate (PMS) for sulfamethoxazole (SMX) degradation, focusing on the effect of calcination temperature on the degradation mechanism. The results showed that the contribution of free radicals to SMX degradation decreased gradually when calcination temperature increased from 300 to 800 °C. In contrast, the contribution of surface-bound reactive species increased gradually. However, the contribution of surface-bound reactive species to SMX degradation decreased for NSDB prepared at 900 °C. The change of physiochemical properties such as contact angle caused by calcination temperature was responsible for the shift of SMX degradation mechanism. NSDB prepared at 800 °C showed higher catalytic activity to PMS compared to NSDB prepared at other temperatures. Compared to sludge-derived biochar (SDB), NSDB had much higher catalytic activity, indicating that nitrogen doping could improve the catalytic activity of SDB.

On the potential energy surface constructed at the M06-2X/aug-cc-pVTZ level, the temperature- and pressure-dependent behaviors of the title reaction were characterized using the stochastic Rice-Ramsperger-Kassel-Marcus based Master Equation (RRKM-ME) rate model. The corrections of the hindered internal rotation and quantum tunneling treatments were included. The calculated results reveal the competition between the two distinct pathways: OH-addition and direct H-abstraction. The former channels are found favorable at low-temperature and high-pressure range (e.g., T < 900 K and P = 760 Torr) where non-Arrhenius and positive pressure-dependent behaviors of the rate constants are noticeably observed, while the latter predominate at temperatures higher than 900 K at atmospheric pressure and no pressure dependence on the rate constant is found. The predicted global rate constants are in excellent agreement with laboratory values; thus, the derived kinetic parameters are recommended for modeling/simulation of N-heterocycle-related applications in atmospheric and even in combustion conditions. Besides, pyrrole should not be considered as a persistent organic pollutant owing to its short atmospheric lifetime (â¼1 h) towards OH radicals. The secondary mechanisms of the subsequent reactions of two OH-pyrrole adducts (namely, I1 and I2) with two abundant species, O2/NO, which are relevant to the atmospheric degradation process, were also investigated. It is also revealed by TD-DFT calculations that two OH-pyrrole adducts (I1 &I2), nine intermediates, Ii (i = 3-11) and four products (P1, P2, P3 and P6) can undergo photodissociation under the sunlight.","Mai, Tam V-T; Nguyen, Hieu T; Huynh, Lam K",Chemosphere,420,6

At the onset, coronavirus disease 2019 can present as any other acute febrile undifferentiated illness. In tropical regions, clinicians are increasingly challenged to differentiate these febrile illnesses without the use of diagnostics. With this pandemic, many of these tropical diseases are neglected and go underreported. Dengue is holoendemic in the Maldives, and dengue viruses circulate throughout the year. Reports about coinfections with dengue virus and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 are scarce, and the outcome and the dynamics of the disease may be altered in the presence of coinfection. We have described the clinical manifestation and serial laboratory profile, and highlighted the atypical findings uncommon in dengue infection. CASE PRESENTATION: Case 1 was a 39-year old Asian male, presented on day 6 of dengue infection with warning signs. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 that was done as per hospital protocol was found to be positive. Case 2 was a 38-year old Asian male, was admitted on day 5 of illness with symptoms of acute respiratory infection with positive reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Evaluation of progressive leukopenia and thrombocytopenia showed positive dengue serology. CONCLUSION: Clinicians must be conscientious when working on the differential diagnosis of possible tropical diseases in cases of coronavirus disease 2019, specifically, when patients develop hemoconcentration, thrombocytopenia, and transaminitis with elevated expression of aspartate higher than alanine transaminase, which is frequently observed in dengue infection. Caution must be taken during the administration of intravenous fluids when treating patients with coronavirus disease 2019 and dengue coinfection, as coronavirus disease 2019 patients are more prone to develop pulmonary edema. Timely diagnosis and appropriate management are essential to avoid the devastating complications of severe forms of dengue infection. It is important to repeat and reconfirm the dengue serology in coronavirus disease 2019 patients to avoid false positivity. Diligence and care must be taken not to neglect other endemic tropical diseases in the region during the present pandemic.","Hilmy, Abdullah Isneen; Dey, Rajib Kumar; Imad, Hisham Ahmed; Yoosuf, Abdul Azeez; Nazeem, Ali; Latheef, Ali Abdulla",J Med Case Rep,420,16

It is important to know how these lockdowns affected businesses, such as restaurants, in regions that vary in terms of poverty status and geography. In this paper, we analyze the differential changes in rural and urban restaurant visits by the restaurants' NAICS codes following the COVID-19 lockdowns. Our analysis contributes to the public policy literature and helps operational planning for food distribution during a pandemic. Methods: Since urban and rural consumer behavior and food resources are significantly different, it is crucial to conduct a comparative analysis. Our study applies a difference-in-differences model to capture the differential effects lockdowns have on urban and rural restaurants. Results: We find that restaurant visits declined significantly in both rural and urban counties after shelter-at-home orders. The decrease in total restaurant visits was almost twice as high in urban counties as in rural counties. We also find that visits to fast-food restaurants increased in rural counties during shelter-at-home orders.

Moving forward, randomized controlled clinical trials are necessary to ensure that clinicians can treat patients effectively during this outbreak and the next. To do so, academic medical centers must address 2 key research issues: (1) how to effectively and efficiently determine which trials have the best chance of benefiting current and future patients and (2) how to establish a transparent and ethical process for subject recruitment while maintaining research integrity and without overburdening patients or staff. We share here the current methods used by Michigan Medicine to address these issues.","Spector-Bagdady, Kayte; Higgins, Peter D R; Aaronson, Keith D; Birk, Judy; Flaherty, Kevin R; Gregg, Kevin S; Hyzy, Robert C; Kaul, Daniel R; Lauring, Adam S; Magee, John C; Meurer, William J; Park, Pauline K; Scott, Phillip; Lok, Anna S",Clin Infect Dis,420,17

Low-dose upper-room germicidal ultraviolet-C (GUV 254 nm) is well suited for this because of the SARS-CoV-2 virus' sensitivity to GUV inactivation and GUV's relatively easy adaptability to many types of indoor spaces without respect to outside weather conditions. However, most existing upper-room GUV fixtures are relatively expensive and inefficient at creating an upper-room disinfection zone due to loss of disinfecting UV-C photons caused by the casing and louvers designed to protect persons in the occupied space. Presented herein are two moderate-size restaurant spaces, 900 ft2 (83.6 m2 ) and 630 ft2 (58.5 m2 ), respectively, in which low-cost bare-bulb GUV fixtures, without exterior casing, were installed with upward-pulling ceiling fans to provide upper-room disinfection and lower-room safety. Proper safety-tested installations like these are adaptable to hospital emergency department waiting rooms, clinics, nursing home and prison common areas, public libraries, schools and restaurants.","Davidson, Bruce L",Photochem. photobiol,420,16

Unfortunately, the inherent instability of RNA and translational efficiency are major limitations of RNA vaccine. Here, we report an injectable hydrogel formed with graphene oxide (GO) and polyethylenimine (PEI), which can generate mRNA (ovalbumin, a model antigen) and adjuvants (R848)-laden nanovaccines for at least 30 days after subcutaneous injection. The released nanovaccines can protect the mRNA from degradation and confer targeted delivering capacity to lymph nodes. The data show that this transformable hydrogel can significantly increase the number of antigen-specific CD8+ T cells and subsequently inhibit the tumor growth with only one treatment. Meanwhile, this hydrogel can generate an antigen specific antibody in the serum which in turn prevents the occurrence of metastasis. Collectively, these results demonstrate the potential of the PEI-functionalized GO transformable hydrogel for effective cancer immunotherapy.","Yin, Yue; Li, Xiaoyang; Ma, Haixia; Zhang, Jie; Yu, Di; Zhao, Ruifang; Yu, Shengji; Nie, Guangjun; Wang, Hai",Nano lett,420,5

According to the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the virus has spread to almost all 54 recognized African countries. Figures from the CDC indicate that the highly affected countries include South Africa, Egypt, Nigeria, Algeria, Morocco, and Ghana (with more than 55 000 cases and 400 deaths as of the time of writing). The WHO and the United Nations have projected the ongoing pandemic could push medical practitioners toward high rates of clinical misdiagnosis. So far, the coronavirus pandemic has been more devastating and life-threatening than the usual seasonal flu. As of the time of writing, here is presently no proven vaccine or treatment for the disease, with the vaccines still under development;hence, a timely and accurate diagnosis could prove critical. Patients can also receive supportive care earlier if they are diagnosed early. Considering the fact that the coronavirus infection mimics the signs and symptoms of normal flu and other respiratory infections, a problem now emerges, where these symptoms are treated as manifestations of the deadly virus. This has caused a diagnostic dilemma in the absence of laboratory tests with new cases adding to the pool daily. In Ghana, many patients on suspicion of flu-like symptoms are sometimes denied the care so deserved due to the stigma associated with the disease, often in cases where laboratory tests are absent. This study is a postmortem report of a client who died while on admission at a private medical facility. It was an unconfirmed case of COVID-19, and the client was left unattended to and died, having spent 8 days on the ward. His test report was not done initially, but the diagnosis was purely based on suspicion. Nasopharyngeal swabs conducted on the fifth day of admission proved negative. Results became available on the day of the client's demise. Postmortem findings established the actual cause of death, and it was not COVID-19 related.","Ossei, Paul Poku Sampene Ayibor William Gilbert Taylor John Agyemang Lawrence Aninkora Kwabena Owusu Asante Bright Opoku",Clinical Pathology,420,23

Remdesivir has been authorized for the treatment of COVID-19. We conducted a systematic review to evaluate the incidence of AKI in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. The incidence of AKI in different subgroups was also investigated. METHODS: A thorough search was performed to find relevant studies in PubMed, Web of Science, medRxiv and EMBASE from 1 Jan 2020 until 1 June 2020. The systematic review was performed using the meta package in R (4.0.1). RESULTS: A total of 16,199 COVID-19 patients were included in our systematic review. The pooled estimated incidence of AKI in all hospitalized COVID-19 patients was 10.0% (95% CI: 7.0-12.0%). The pooled estimated proportion of COVID-19 patients who needed continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) was 4% (95% CI: 3-6%). According to our subgroup analysis, the incidence of AKI could be associated with age, disease severity and ethnicity. The incidence of AKI in hospitalized COVID-19 patients being treated with remdesivir was 7% (95% CI: 3-13%) in a total of 5 studies. CONCLUSION: We found that AKI was not rare in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. The incidence of AKI could be associated with age, disease severity and ethnicity. Remdesivir probably did not induce AKI in COVID-19 patients. Our systematic review provides evidence that AKI might be closely associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, which should be investigated in future studies.","Xu, Zhenjian; Tang, Ying; Huang, Qiuyan; Fu, Sha; Li, Xiaomei; Lin, Baojuan; Xu, Anping; Chen, Junzhe",BMC Nephrol,420,24

METHODS: A matched case-control study was conducted in 366 Thai participants, including 122 who were confirmed SARS-CoV-2-positive by RT-PCR (case group) and 244 who were SARS-CoV-2-negative (control group). Taste, smell, and appetite changes were assessed by self-reported visual analog scale. Preference for sweet, salty, umami, sour, bitter, and spicy were judged using the validated TASTE-26 questionnaire. RESULTS: Partial taste and smell losses were observed in both groups, while complete losses (ageusia and anosmia) were detected only in the case group. Moreover, only ageusia and anosmia were associated with SARS-CoV-2 positivity (P < 0.001, odds ratio of 14.5 and 27.5, respectively). Taste, smell, and appetite scores were more severely reduced in the case group (P < 0.0001). Multivariate analysis showed that anosmia and ageusia were the best predictors of SARS-CoV-2 positivity, followed by appetite loss and fever. Simultaneous losses of taste and smell but not taste preferences were associated with SARS-CoV-2 positivity (P < 0.01, odds ratio 2.28). CONCLUSIONS: Complete, but not partial, losses of taste and smell were the best predictors of SARS-CoV-2 infection. During the current COVID-19 pandemic, healthy persons with sudden simultaneous complete loss of taste and smell should be screened for COVID-19.","Trachootham, Dunyaporn; Thongyen, Supeda; Lam-Ubol, Aroonwan; Chotechuang, Nattida; Pongpirul, Wannarat; Prasithsirikul, Wisit",Int J Infect Dis,420,16

The objective of this report is to share the themes of this wellness check-ins with those engaged in pediatric emergency medicine education and mentorship. Additionally, we share our curricular approach as we plan to continue PEM Pals after the pandemic restrictions are lifted. METHODS: ""PEM Pals"" is a twice-weekly video conference meeting made up of pediatric residents with an expressed interest in PEM and those residents currently on rotation in the pediatric emergency department. Following a flipped classroom model, participants complete a presession learning activity and then core PEM topics are covered through literature review, case discussions, and telesimulations. Each meeting begins with a wellness ""check-in."" Themes generated from these check-ins were member checked by our core learning contingent. RESULTS: Nine residents make up our core learning contingent and we have had 11 ""PEM Pals"" sessions since March 2020. Three themes emerged from the wellness check-ins. The first was each postgraduate year's unique concern over professional transitions. The second was a pervasive sense of guilt. And the third was a grave concern about their ability to support and be supported from their personal communities.

The aim of this study was to systematically review the literature on the efficacy and safety of parathyroid allotransplantation to treat post-operative hypoparathyroidism. METHODS: MEDLINE, Embase, BIOSIS and the Cochrane Library were searched for published articles (from inception of each database to September 30, 2018). A total of 9 studies comprising 146 patients (177 allotransplantations) with post thyroidectomy hypoparathyroidism were identified. RESULTS: Parathyroid tissues used for allotransplant were cultured parathyroid cells, cryopreserved parathyroid cells and encapsulated microspheres. Post-transplant immunosuppression was only reported in three studies, mainly with oral prednisolone for 2 weeks to 6 months. Mean graft survival following allotransplantation was 47% (95% CI 24%-71%) when patients were followed-up to 6 months and 41% (95% CI 2.3%-80%) at 12 months. There was significant unexplained heterogeneity observed between studies in both these groups (I2 > 50%). Parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels, and serum calcium levels post intervention was not reported in all studies, but available evidence suggests the levels remains higher (PTH level around 12 pg/ml; Ca level around 8 mg/dl) post-allotransplantation for up to 24 months. CONCLUSIONS: Long-term benefit and harms of allotransplantation is still unclear due to the clinical and statistical heterogeneity observed among the studies. Therefore, conduct of a well-designed controlled clinical trial in the immediate future on allotransplantation is of paramount importance.","Parameswaran, R; Samuel, M; Satish, R L; Kripesh, A; Moorthy, V; Vajjhala, R; Ng, X L; Yip, G W; Voon, F C T; Chandran, Manju",Surg.

Objective: To estimate the potential years of life lost (YLL) associated with the COVID-19 pandemic conditioned on primary schools being closed or remaining open. Design, Setting, and Participants: This decision analytical model estimated the association between school closures and reduced educational attainment and the association between reduced educational attainment and life expectancy using publicly available data sources, including data for 2020 from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the US Social Security Administration, and the US Census Bureau. Direct COVID-19 mortality and potential increases in mortality that might have resulted if school opening led to increased transmission of COVID-19 were also estimated. Main Outcomes and Measures: Years of life lost. Results: A total of 24.2 million children aged 5 to 11 years attended public schools that were closed during the 2020 pandemic, losing a median of 54 (interquartile range, 48-62.5) days of instruction. Missed instruction was associated with a mean loss of 0.31 (95% credible interval [CI], 0.10-0.65) years of final educational attainment for boys and 0.21 (95% CI, 0.06-0.46) years for girls. Summed across the population, an estimated 5.53 million (95% CI, 1.88-10.80) YLL may be associated with school closures. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported a total of 88â¯241 US deaths from COVID-19 through the end of May 2020, with an estimated 1.50 million (95% CI, 1.23-1.85 million) YLL as a result. Had schools remained open, 1.47 million (95% credible interval, 0.45-2.59) additional YLL could have been expected as a result, based on results of studies associating school closure with decreased pandemic spread. Comparing the full distributions of estimated YLL under both ""schools open"" and ""schools closed"" conditions, the analysis observed a 98.1% probability that school opening would have been associated with a lower total YLL than school closure. Conclusions and Relevance: In this decision analytical model of years of life potentially lost under differing conditions of school closure, the analysis favored schools remaining open. Future decisions regarding school closures during the pandemic should consider the association between educational disruption and decreased expected lifespan and give greater weight to the potential outcomes of school closure on children's health.","Christakis, Dimitri A; Van Cleve, Wil; Zimmerman, Frederick J",JAMA Netw Open,420,29

However, very few groups have taken a holistic approach and presented a combined solution. None has presented their CTA in such a way as to ensure that even the most suggestible member of our community does not become complacent and assume that CTA operates as an invisible shield, making us and our families impenetrable or immune to the disease. We propose to build on some of the digital solutions already under development that, with addition of a Bayesian model that predicts likelihood for infection supplemented by traditional symptom and contact tracing, that can enable us to reach 90% of a population. When combined with an effective communication strategy and social distancing, we believe solutions like the one proposed here can have a very beneficial effect on containing the spread of this pandemic.","McLachlan, Scott; Lucas, Peter; Dube, Kudakwashe; Hitman, Graham A; Osman, Magda; Kyrimi, Evangelia; Neil, Martin; Fenton, Norman E",,420,22

Modeled contrail cover declined similarly, and computed mean instantaneous radiative contrail forcing dropped regionally by up to 0.7 W m−2. Here, model predictions of cirrus optical thickness and the top‐of‐atmosphere outgoing longwave and reflected shortwave irradiances are tested by comparison to Meteosat‐SEVIRI‐derived data. The agreement between observations and modeled data is slightly better when modeled contrail cirrus contributions are included. The spatial distributions and diurnal cycles of the differences in these data between 2019 and 2020 are partially caused by differences in atmospheric and surface conditions, particularly for solar radiation in the spring of 2020. Aviation signals become discernible in the observed differences of these data between 2019 and 2020 when subtracting numerical weather prediction model results that approximate the atmosphere and surface conditions without contrails. Plain Language Summary: Aircraft flying in cold and humid air masses induce contrails which warm the Earth‐atmosphere system by reducing the terrestrial radiation out into space and cool by increasing the Earth's albedo. Previous studies found that the warming effects dominate and that contrails may contribute most of the present radiative forcing of climate change induced by aviation. The COVID‐19 pandemic led to a worldwide and long‐duration reduction of air traffic. This paper compares model predictions and satellite‐observed cirrus properties and irradiances over Europe for 6 months in 2019 and 2020. The models account for changes in the atmosphere and at the Earth's surface in the two half‐years. Model and observation results show about 90% correlation and 20% mean normalized deviations. The agreement between observed and modeled optical cirrus thickness and terrestrial irradiances improves slightly when the modeled contrail cirrus contributions are included. Solar radiation changes show a larger variability because of large changes in the lower atmosphere and at the Earth surface. Since worldwide traffic activity has stayed at low levels after August 2020, the comparisons may be extended. Further model studies, including the effects of other emissions, are needed for a more comprehensive understanding of the observed changes. Key Points: Air traffic reduction during the COVID‐19 pandemic is used for testing aviation contrail cirrus and related radiative forcing modelingCirrus optical depth and top‐of‐atmosphere irradiances from satellite observations and model results show reasonable correlationsAviation contrail signatures are identifiable in spite of strongly different atmosphere and surface conditions in 2019 and 2020 [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of Geophysical Research Letters is the property of John Wiley & Sons, Inc. and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission.

We conducted a retrospective cohort study to estimate risk of acquiring symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 on aircraft, to inform contact tracing and infection control efforts. METHODS: We identified co-passengers of infectious passengers on 18 England-bound flights from European cities up to 12/03/2020, using manifests received for contact tracing. Infectious passengers were laboratory-confirmed cases with symptom onset from 7 days before to 2 days after the flight. Possible aircraft-acquired cases were laboratory-confirmed with onset 3-14 days post-flight with no known non-flight exposure. Manifests was merged with the national case management dataset (identifying cases, onset dates, contact tracing status) and the national COVID-19 linelist. Contact tracing notes were reviewed to identify non-flight exposures. We calculated attack rates (ARs) among all co-passengers and within subgroups, including by distance from infectious cases and number of infectious cases on-board. RESULTS: There were 55 infectious passengers and 2313 co-passengers, including 2221 flight-only contacts. Five possible aircraft-acquired cases were identified; ARs of 0.2% (95%CI 0.1-0.5) among all flight-only contacts and 3.8% (95%CI 1.3-10.6) among contact-traced flight-only contacts sat within a two-seat radius. The AR among 92 co-travellers with known non-flight exposure to infectious cases was 13.0% (95%CI 7.6%-21.4%). There were insufficient numbers to assess differences between subgroups. CONCLUSION: We conclude that risk of symptomatic COVID-19 due to transmission on short to medium-haul flights is low, and recommend prioritising contact-tracing of close contacts and co-travellers where resources are limited. Further research on risk on aircraft is encouraged.","Blomquist, Paula Bianca; Bolt, Hikaru; Packer, Simon; Schaefer, Ulf; Platt, Steven; Dabrera, Gavin; Gobin, Maya; Oliver, Isabel",Influenza Other Respir Viruses,420,3

The impact on resident physicians, including minority providers, had not yet been reported. We aimed to assess how primary care residents perceived increased TM in clinics during the pandemic, and assess resident burnout. Materials and Methods: An online survey was sent to 60 internal medicine (IM) and 18 family medicine (FM) residents who used TM to treat underserved patients, from March to May 2020, at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. The questionnaire included questions on resident demographics, satisfaction with TM, screening capability for COVID-19, effectiveness for patient education on COVID-19, impact on patient interactions and time management. Burnout was assessed with the Abbreviated Maslach Burnout Inventory. Results: A majority (62 of 78) eligible residents (79.5%) responded to the survey. Ninety-one percent of residents agreed that TM was a secure alternative to face-to-face encounters. Seventy-nine percent used it to screen for signs/symptoms of COVID-19 and 93% provided patient education on COVID-19. Average visit length decreased by 10-20 min with TM.

The fast speed of publication has challenged researchers and other stakeholders to keep up with the volume of published articles. To search for the literature effectively, researchers use databases such as PubMed. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the performance of different searches for COVID-19 records in PubMed and to assess the complexity of searches that was required. METHODS: We tested PubMed searches for COVID-19 to identify which search string performed best according to standard metrics (sensitivity, precision and F-score). We evaluated the performance of eight different searches in PubMed during the first ten weeks of the COVID-19 pandemic to investigate how complex a search string is needed. We also tested omitting hyphens and space characters as well as applying quotation marks. RESULTS: The two most comprehensive search strings performed best, but the single-term search, COVID-19, performed well in terms of sensitivity (98.4/98.7 vs 94.4), precision (94.6/92.7 vs 95.3), and F-score (96.5/95.7 vs 94.8). We found that deleting a hyphen or space character could omit a substantial number of records. If entered correctly, a single-term search performed well although the number of relevant records would be increased by using a comprehensive search. CONCLUSIONS: Comprehensive search strings performed better than single term searches in PubMed, but not by a large margin for some single terms. For everyday searches, certain single term searches are probably sufficient whereas more comprehensive searches should be used for systematic reviews. Still, we suggest additional measures that the U.S. National Library of Medicine could take to support all PubMed users in searching the COVID-19 literature.","Lazarus, Jeffrey V; Palayew, Adam; Rasmussen, Lauge Neimann; Andersen, Tue Helms; Nicholson, Joseph; Norgaard, Ole",J. med. internet res,420,6

Uno de los antisépticos usados en Oftalmología, formulado a base de ácido hipocloroso 0,01%, consideramos que podría tener acción virucida frente al virus SARS-CoV-2. El objetivo del estudio fue revisar la evidencia científica sobre la actividad virucida del ácido hipocloroso frente al SARS- CoV- 2 Métodos: se realizó una búsqueda exhaustiva en las bases de datos de Pubmed y Web of Sciencie para identificar artículos relevantes sobre la actividad virucida del ácido hipocloroso en diferentes concentraciones, publicados hasta el 4 de Octubre de 2020. Resultados: La búsqueda arrojó un total de 20 artículos. Los estudios analizados mostraron pruebas de la eficacia virucida del ácido hipocloroso, a una concentración del 0,01%, frente a SARS-CoV-2, así como frente a otros virus. Conclusiones: el ácido hipocloroso 0,01% podría actuar como antiséptico eficaz frente a SARS-CoV-2, creando una barrera protectora sobre las mucosas para evitar la entrada del virus y el desarrollo de la infección COVID-19. El producto puede ser aplicado en ojos, nariz y boca sin efectos nocivos. Por ello, consideramos necesario valorar su uso en el protocolo de atención sanitaria al paciente en consultas de Oftalmología, así como recomendar su uso a la población general para disminuir la carga viral y/o evitar transmisión de la infección.

It is unknown how severe visual losses need to be before changes in auditory abilities occur, or whether the relationship between severity of visual loss and changes in auditory abilities is proportional and systematic. Here we show that greater severity of visual loss is associated with increased auditory judgments of distance and room size. On average participants with severe visual losses perceived sounds to be twice as far away, and rooms to be three times larger, than sighted controls. Distance estimates for sighted controls were most accurate for closer sounds and least accurate for farther sounds. As the severity of visual impairment increased, accuracy decreased for closer sounds and increased for farther sounds. However, it is for closer sounds that accurate judgments are needed to guide rapid motor responses to auditory events, e.g. planning a safe path through a busy street to avoid collisions with other people, and falls. Interestingly, greater visual impairment severity was associated with more accurate room size estimates. The results support a new hypothesis that crossmodal calibration of audition by vision depends on the severity of visual loss.","Kolarik, Andrew J; Raman, Rajiv; Moore, Brian C J; Cirstea, Silvia; Gopalakrishnan, Sarika; Pardhan, Shahina",Sci Rep,420,13

We aimed to use an individual-based model to predict the impact of two possible strategies for reopening schools to all students in the UK from September, 2020, in combination with different assumptions about relaxation of physical distancing measures and the scale-up of testing. METHODS: In this modelling study, we used Covasim, a stochastic individual-based model for transmission of SARS-CoV-2, calibrated to the UK epidemic. The model describes individuals' contact networks stratified into household, school, workplace, and community layers, and uses demographic and epidemiological data from the UK. We simulated six different scenarios, representing the combination of two school reopening strategies (full time and a part-time rota system with 50% of students attending school on alternate weeks) and three testing scenarios (68% contact tracing with no scale-up in testing, 68% contact tracing with sufficient testing to avoid a second COVID-19 wave, and 40% contact tracing with sufficient testing to avoid a second COVID-19 wave). We estimated the number of new infections, cases, and deaths, as well as the effective reproduction number (R) under different strategies. In a sensitivity analysis to account for uncertainties within the stochastic simulation, we also simulated infectiousness of children and young adults aged younger than 20 years at 50% relative to older ages (20 years and older). FINDINGS: With increased levels of testing (between 59% and 87% of symptomatic people tested at some point during an active SARS-CoV-2 infection, depending on the scenario), and effective contact tracing and isolation, an epidemic rebound might be prevented. Assuming 68% of contacts could be traced, we estimate that 75% of individuals with symptomatic infection would need to be tested and positive cases isolated if schools return full-time in September, or 65% if a part-time rota system were used. If only 40% of contacts could be traced, these figures would increase to 87% and 75%, respectively. However, without these levels of testing and contact tracing, reopening of schools together with gradual relaxing of the lockdown measures are likely to induce a second wave that would peak in December, 2020, if schools open full-time in September, and in February, 2021, if a part-time rota system were adopted. In either case, the second wave would result in R rising above 1 and a resulting second wave of infections 2·0-2·3 times the size of the original COVID-19 wave. When infectiousness of children and young adults was varied from 100% to 50% of that of older ages, we still found that a comprehensive and effective test-trace-isolate strategy would be required to avoid a second COVID-19 wave. INTERPRETATION: To prevent a second COVID-19 wave, relaxation of physical distancing, including reopening of schools, in the UK must be accompanied by large-scale, population-wide testing of symptomatic individuals and effective tracing of their contacts, followed by isolation of diagnosed individuals.

Few data are available about the risk of COVID-19 infection in persons with hematological cancer, but controversy whether these persons have the same clinical signs and outcomes. We describe a case of life-threatening COVID-19 infection complicated by severe anemia in patients affected also by chronic myelogenous leukemia. The screening for RBC antibodies and the direct antiglobulin test (DAT) turned positive. The identification of the antibodies, showed the presence of an alloantibody with anti-Lewis b specificity, which was reactive at room temperature, in the anti-human globulin phase (AGH) and with papain-treated red blood cells.

In August 2020 more than eight hundred thousand patients lost their lives due to acute respiratory syndrome. In the limited list of therapeutic approaches, the effectiveness of low-dose radiation therapy (LD-RT) for curing inflammatory-related diseases have sparkled a light that probably this approach would bring promising advantages for COVID-19 patients. LD-RT owns its reputation from its ability to modulate the host inflammatory responses by blocking the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and hampering the activity of leukocytes. Moreover, the cost-effective and availability of this method allow it to be applied to a large number of patients, especially those who could not receive anti-IL-6 treatments in low-income countries. But enthusiasm for applying LD-RT for the treatment of COVID-19 patients has been muted yet. CONCLUSION: In this review, we take a look at LD-RT mechanisms of action in the treatment of nonmalignant diseases, and then through studying both the dark and bright sides of this approach, we provide a thorough discussion if LD-RT might be a promising therapeutic approach in COVID-19 patients.","Koosha, Fereshteh; Pourbagheri-Sigaroodi, Atieh; Bakhshandeh, Mohsen; Bashash, Davood",Int J Radiat Biol,420,12

The data was collected from three countries, China, Pakistan and the UK, through eighteen semi-structured interviews. Three sub-themes emerged under the core theme of ""psychological challenges "": ""cognitive challenges "", ""physical challenges"", and ""behavioral challenges"". Similarly, ""individual resilience"" and ""group resilience"" emerged under the core theme of ""psychological resilience"". The results showed that the mental health of old age employees without having any medical complications was also affected during the pandemic thus resulting in low work engagement. The data was collected from three countries namely China, Pakistan and the UK. Furthermore, data were collected through telephonic interviews so some aspects of the study might be left unexplored which can only be possible through face to face interaction. This study, in line with the previous literature, indicate that challenges explored related to COVID-19 can significantly influence the mental wellbeing of aging employees. The study also encourages employers to understand the limitations of aging employees and develop flexible policies that can have a positive impact on work engagement.

However, GBSs in the setting of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) remains poorly characterized, whilst GBSs prevalence amongst COVID-19 patients has not been previously systematically evaluated using a meta-analytical approach. METHODS: A systematic review and meta-analysis of observational cohort and case series studies reporting on the occurrence, clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients with COVID-19-associated GBSs was performed. A random-effects model was used to calculate pooled estimates and odds ratios (ORs) with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs), compared to non-COVID-19, contemporary or historical GBSs patients. RESULTS: Eighteen eligible studies (11 cohorts, seven case series) were identified including a total of 136,746 COVID-19 patients. Amongst COVID-19 patients, including hospitalized and non-hospitalized cases, the pooled GBSs prevalence was 0.15 (95% CI 0%-0.49; I2 = 96%). Compared with non-infected contemporary or historical controls, patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection had increased odds for demyelinating GBSs subtypes (OR 3.27, 95% CI 1.32%-8.09%; I2 = 0%). In SARS-CoV-2-infected patients, olfactory or concomitant cranial nerve involvement was noted in 41.4% (95% CI 3.5%-60.4%; I2 = 46%) and 42.8% (95% CI 32.8%-53%; I2 = 0%) of the patients, respectively. Clinical outcomes including in-hospital mortality were comparable between COVID-19 GBSs patients and non-infected contemporary or historical GBSs controls. CONCLUSION: GBSs prevalence was estimated at 15 cases per 100,000 SARS-CoV-2 infections. COVID-19 appears to be associated with an increased likelihood of GBSs and with demyelinating GBSs variants in particular.","Palaiodimou, Lina; Stefanou, Maria-Ioanna; Katsanos, Aristeidis H; Fragkou, Paraskevi C; Papadopoulou, Marianna; Moschovos, Christos; Michopoulos, Ioannis; Kokotis, Panagiotis; Bakirtzis, Christos; Naska, Androniki; Vassilakopoulos, Theodoros I; Chroni, Elisabeth; Tsiodras, Sotirios; Tsivgoulis, Georgios",Eur. j. neurol,420,16

The virus (SARS-CoV-2) causes a severe acute respiratory syndrome and had been responsible for &gt;14 000 deaths in South Africa (SA) at the time of writing, 30 August 2020. Autopsies in our setting have not been prioritised owing to the infective risks for staff, resulting in a lack of information on the histopathology of the disease in the SA setting. Postmortem biopsies are relatively quick and easy to perform and reduce the infective risk posed by full autopsies. OBJECTIVES: To determine whether postmortem biopsies of lung tissue could be used to determine cause of death in lieu of full autopsies in patients dying from COVID-19. METHODS: We performed postmortem biopsies of lung tissue on 4 patients with SARS-CoV-2 confirmed by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction who died in the Tygerberg Hospital (Cape Town, SA) intensive care unit (ICU) in June - July 2020, in order to determine their cause of death. The biopsies were performed in the ICU with the necessary personal protective equipment within 2 hours after death. Clinical information was obtained from the hospital records and the histopathology was reviewed by two consultant histopathologists. Microbiology and electron microscopy were also performed on this tissue. RESULTS: All 4 patients were aged &gt;50 years and had multiple comorbidities. Pulmonary pathology was present in only 3 cases, and the findings were surprisingly heterogeneous. One case demonstrated several findings including diffuse alveolar damage, extensive fibrin thrombi in pulmonary arteries with pulmonary infarction, organising pneumonia and bronchopneumonia. Other findings included type 2 pneumocyte hyperplasia, intra-alveolar macrophages and squamous metaplasia. An organising pneumonia was present in 2 other cases, although these findings were not deemed to be severe enough to be the cause of death. Fibrin thrombi were present in pulmonary arteries of 3 cases. One case showed no significant acute pulmonary pathology. The cause of death could only be determined in 1 case. CONCLUSIONS: The pulmonary findings we observed are in keeping with those described in the international literature. However, the pathology was surprisingly heterogeneous between cases, and was only deemed severe enough to be the cause of death in 1 of 4 cases. While lung-targeted, standardised postmortem biopsies may be safe, easy to perform and provide useful insights into the disease, they are not suitable to replace full autopsies in determining cause of death.","Bruce-Brand, C; Allwood, B W; Koegelenberg, C F N; Lalla, U; Louw, E; Diacon, A H; Schubert, P T",S Afr Med J,420,24

It was based on the online COVID-19 Impact on Lifestyle Change Survey (COINLICS) conducted among 10 540 youths at three educational levels, including high/vocational school, undergraduate, and graduate, before and during COVID-19 lockdown. Measures of perceptions of social capital were adapted from a validated Chinese version of Health-related Social Capital Measurement based on youths' characteristics of living and studying environment. Social capital was measured at four dimensions, including individual social capital (ISC), family social capital (FSC), community social capital (CSC), and society social capital (SSC). Overall, compared to before lockdown, ISC and CSC scores decreased, while FSC and SSC scores increased during lockdown. When stratified by educational levels, the trends for each dimension of social capital were consistent with the overall population.

Agents that inhibit components of the pro-inflammatory cascade have garnered interest as potential treatment options with hopes that dampening the proinflammatory process may improve clinical outcomes. Baricitinib is a reversible Janus-associated kinase (JAK)-inhibitor that interrupts the signaling of multiple cytokines implicated in COVID-19 immunopathology. It may also have antiviral effects by targeting host factors that viruses rely for cell entry and by suppressing type I interferon driven angiotensin-converting-enzyme-2 upregulation. However, baricitinib's immunosuppressive effects may be detrimental during acute viral infections by delaying viral clearance and increasing vulnerability to secondary opportunistic infections. The lack of reliable biomarkers to monitor patients' immune status as illness evolves complicates deployment of immunosuppressive drugs like baricitinib. Furthermore, baricitinib carries the risk of increased thromboembolic events, which is concerning given the proclivity towards a hypercoagulable state in patients with COVID-19. In this article, we review available data on baricitinib with an emphasis on immunosuppressive and antiviral pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, safety, and current progress in COVID-19 clinical trials.","Jorgensen, Sarah C J; Tse, Christopher L Y; Burry, Lisa; Dresser, Linda D",Pharmacotherapy,420,9

How animals use their environment can be mediated by their personality (e.g. risk-taking), but does personality mediate how overwintering species select refugia? Snow cover is a dynamic winter characteristic that can influence crypsis or provide below-the-snow refugia. We explored how wintering ruffed grouse (Bonasa umbellus) selected snow roosting sites, a behaviour that reduces stress and cold exposure. We linked selection for approximately 700 roosts with survival of 42 grouse, and showed that grouse generally selected deeper snow and warmer areas. Grouse found in shallow snow were less likely to survive winter. However, individuals that selected deep snow improved their survival, suggesting that demographic consequences of selecting winter refugia are mediated by differences in personality. Our study provides a crucial, and seldom addressed, link between personality in resource selection and resulting demographic consequences.","Shipley, Amy A; Cruz, Jennyffer; Zuckerberg, Benjamin",Proc Biol Sci,420,12

However, COVID-19 has created many challenges, including the inability to meet in-person, travel restrictions to conferences, overwhelming clinical demands on already overextended faculty members and the increased need to focus on personal health and safety. Although current challenges were immediately met with solutions borne out of an emergency, questions remain on how to identify and sustain best practices and further evolve staff development beyond the immediate crisis. Reviewing the Medical Adaptations series revealed several lessons. Several authors used cognitive apprenticeship to provide scaffolding upon which learners can build skills, knowledge and attitudes. Additionally, moderators were recommended during live educational sessions in order to manage the chat box and engage the audience. Comprehensive IT support was key. A post-session debrief helped deepen understanding and provided a space for peer support and community building. Building a repository for educational materials was recommended. Although we made significant gains in the ability to offer staff development, we must consider potential and unintended consequences and explore how we can use transformative learning theory to capitalize on what we have gained. Utilizing technology can potentially increase access to online learning; however, when not implemented carefully, it can magnify inequities. While providing IT support can serve to mitigate some inequities borne by socioeconomic and generational differences, additional strategies should be implemented to account for English as a second-language learners; those with disabilities who do not have access to adaptive technology; and other marginalized groups who may already feel vulnerable to presenting arguments in oppositions of authority or the majority. Crafting online education experiences to allow for small group, peer-to-peer and social interactions is vital to continued professional and identity development. Now that the urgency has lessened, taking time to ensure what is being offered follows best practices in developing and disseminating quality online education is paramount for broad acceptance.","Zuo, Leila; Miller Juvé, Amy",Med Educ,420,26

The referrals were audited to measure the average waiting time from referral to first offered outpatient appointment and to assess the proportion of patients waiting longer than 12 weeks.MethodThe audit included routine referrals to the CMHT Inverness Sector A, NHS Highland from GP practices: Kingsmills, Burnfield, Riverside, Fairfield, Foyers and Drumnadrochit Medical Practices. The number of referrals and the number and proportion of clients given appointments for assessments were calculated. Referrals were received directly from primary care and the Mental Health Liaison Team or following Out of Hours contacts at the Mental Health Assessment Team.Data were collected retrospectively: referrals from 1 Jan 2020–31 Aug 2020. Sample size came to 160 patients aged 16–65 years. Data were collected via review of recorded documentation on the NHSH electronic patient record systems (SCIstore), from 5th–25th January 2021.Result160 patients (male 82, female 78) were referred from 1 Jan to 1 Sept 2020. Of these, 140 (87.5%) were given an appointment for an assessment. The mean waiting time was 12 weeks for 103 patients (64%), with 57 patients (36%) waiting longer than 13 weeks. The bimodal distribution of waiting times prompted an analysis of those with longer waiting times. In some instances, appointments were delayed because patients either did not attend (DNA) or cancelled their appointments. Reasons for delays included: postponement until further information was available;cancellation of meetings or patients DNA. In 20 cases (12.5%), the referrals deemed inadequate, prompting further liaison with the referrer for clarification about the nature of the problem and previous psychological interventions.ConclusionThe number of transactions (any amendment to a patient record) was higher than the number of patients affected, as several transactions can relate to one patients’ record.Most referrals are vetted in advance via the daily Inverness triage huddle. Ways of improving the quality of information provided by referrers would be explored.On receipt of each referral, the date of the 12 week deadline would be calculated and highlighted in a database.The cross-sector (Highland wide) standardisation will add clarity about medical capacity, that does not involve use of excessive clinician time.","Zinchenko, Oksana Hyland Jennifer",BJPsych Open,420,1

Here we extend a previous phase-I/II trial report2 by presenting data on the immune response induced by BNT162b2 prime-boost vaccination from an additional phase-I/II trial in healthy adults (18-55 years old). BNT162b2 elicited strong antibody responses: at one week after the boost, SARS-CoV-2 serum geometric mean 50% neutralizing titres were up to 3.3-fold above those observed in samples from individuals who had recovered from COVID-19. Sera elicited by BNT162b2 neutralized 22 pseudoviruses bearing the S of different SARS-CoV-2 variants. Most participants had a strong response of IFNÎ³+ or IL-2+ CD8+ and CD4+ T helper type 1 cells, which was detectable throughout the full observation period of nine weeks following the boost. Using peptide-MHC multimer technology, we identified several BNT162b2-induced epitopes that were presented by frequent MHC alleles and conserved in mutant strains. One week after the boost, epitope-specific CD8+ T cells of the early-differentiated effector-memory phenotype comprised 0.02-2.92% of total circulating CD8+ T cells and were detectable (0.01-0.28%) eight weeks later. In summary, BNT162b2 elicits an adaptive humoral and poly-specific cellular immune response against epitopes that are conserved in a broad range of variants, at well-tolerated doses.","Sahin, Ugur; Muik, Alexander; Vogler, Isabel; Derhovanessian, Evelyna; Kranz, Lena M; Vormehr, Mathias; Quandt, Jasmin; Bidmon, Nicole; Ulges, Alexander; Baum, Alina; Pascal, Kristen E; Maurus, Daniel; Brachtendorf, Sebastian; Lörks, Verena; Sikorski, Julian; Koch, Peter; Hilker, Rolf; Becker, Dirk; Eller, Ann-Kathrin; Grützner, Jan; Tonigold, Manuel; Boesler, Carsten; Rosenbaum, Corinna; Heesen, Ludwig; Kühnle, Marie-Cristine; Poran, Asaf; Dong, Jesse Z; Luxemburger, Ulrich; Kemmer-Brück, Alexandra; Langer, David; Bexon, Martin; Bolte, Stefanie; Palanche, Tania; Schultz, Armin; Baumann, Sybille; Mahiny, Azita J; Boros, Gábor; Reinholz, Jonas; Szabó, Gábor T; Karikó, Katalin; Shi, Pei-Yong; Fontes-Garfias, Camila; Perez, John L; Cutler, Mark; Cooper, David; Kyratsous, Christos A; Dormitzer, Philip R; Jansen, Kathrin U; Türeci, Özlem",Nature,420,0

The burden of sepsis in Hong Kong is unknown. We developed a sepsis surveillance method to estimate sepsis incidence from a population electronic health record (EHR) in Hong Kong using objective clinical data. The study objective was to assess our method's performance in identifying sepsis using a retrospective cohort. We compared its accuracy to administrative sepsis surveillance methods such as Angus' and Martin's methods. METHOD: In this single centre retrospective study we applied our sepsis surveillance method on adult patients admitted to a tertiary hospital in Hong Kong. Two clinicians independently reviewed the clinical notes to determine which patients had sepsis. Performance was assessed by sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value and area under the curve (AUC) of Angus', Martin's and our surveillance methods using clinical review as ""gold standard."" RESULTS: Between January 1 and February 28, 2018, our sepsis surveillance method identified 1352 adult patients hospitalised with suspected infection. We found that 38.9% (95%CI 36.3-41.5) of these patients had sepsis. Using a 490 patient validation cohort, two clinicians had good agreement with weighted kappa of 0.75 (95% CI 0.69-0.81) before coming to consensus on diagnosis of uncomplicated infection or sepsis for all patients. Our method had sensitivity 0.93 (95%CI 0.89-0.96), specificity 0.86 (95%CI 0.82-0.90) and an AUC 0.90 (95%CI 0.87-0.92) when validated against clinician review. In contrast, Angus' and Martin's methods had AUCs 0.56 (95%CI 0.53-0.58) and 0.56 (95%CI 0.52-0.59), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: A sepsis surveillance method based on objective data from a population EHR in Hong Kong was more accurate than administrative methods. It may be used to estimate sepsis population incidence and outcomes in Hong Kong.

Many people migrated in the state from different countries as well as states during this SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. The aim of this study was to analyze the RNA binding domain (RBD) sequence of spike protein from the isolates collected from the throat swab samples of COVID-19 positive cases and further to assess the RBD affinity with ACE2 of different species including human. METHODS: Whole genome sequencing for 35 clinical SARS-CoV-2 isolates from COVID-19 positive patients was performed using ARTIC amplicon based sequencing. Sequence analysis and phylogenetic analysis was carried out for the Spike and RBD region of all isolates. The interaction between the RBD and ACE2 receptor of five different species was also analysed. RESULTS: Spike region of 32 isolates showed one/multiple alterations in nucleotide bases in comparison to the Wuhan reference strain. One of the identified mutation at 1204 (Ref A, RMRC 22 C) in the RBD of spike protein showed a stronger binding affinity with human ACE2 receptor. Furthermore, RBDs of all the Indian isolates showed binding affinity for ACE2 of different species. CONCLUSION: As mutated RBD showed stronger interaction with human ACE2, it could potentially result in higher infectivity. Binding affinity of RBDs for ACE2 of all the five species studied, suggests that the virus can infect a wide variety of animals which could also act as natural reservoir for SARS-CoV-2.","Dash, Pujarini; Turuk, Jyotirmayee; Behera, Santosh Ku; Palo, Subrata Kumar; Raghav, Sunil K; Ghosh, Arup; Sabat, Jyotsnamayee; Rath, Sonalika; Subhadra, Subhra; Rana, Khokan; Bhattacharya, Debdutta; Kanungo, Srikanta; Kshatri, Jaya Singh; Mishra, Bijaya Kumar; Dash, Saroj; Parida, Ajay; Pati, Sanghamitra",Int. j. infect. dis,420,20

It subsequently spread throughout China and elsewhere, becoming a global health emergency. In February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) designated the disease coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The objective of this study was to investigate the degree of knowledge of young Italians about COVID-19 and their current attitudes toward the SARS-CoV-2 and to determine if there were prejudices emerging toward Chinese. METHODS: An online survey was conducted on February 3, 4, 5, 2020, with the collaboration of Italian website ""Skuola.net"". Young people had the opportunity to participate by answering an ad hoc questionnaire created to investigate knowledge and attitudes about the new coronavirus, using a link published on the homepage. RESULTS: A total of 5234 responses were received, of which 3262 were females and 1972 were males. Most of the participants showed generally moderate knowledge about COVID-19. Male students, middle school students, and those who do not attend school, should increase awareness of the disease; less than half of responders say that their attitudes toward the Chinese population has worsened in the last period. CONCLUSIONS: Global awareness of this emerging infection should be increased, due to its virulence, the significant risk of mortality, and the ability of the virus to spread very quickly within the community.","La Torre, Giuseppe; Lia, Lorenza; Dorelli, Barbara; Marte, Mattia; Chiappetta, Marta; Faticoni, Augusto; Lucaccini Paoli, Lorenzo; Grassucci, Daniele; Gelardini, Marcello; Ardizzone, Carla",Disaster Med Public Health Prep,420,13

Against such a backdrop, it is relevant to analyze the perception of students and the challenges of onlineclasses during this ongoing COVID-19 outbreak. The present study is based on a quantitative and sample survey approach. The respondent sample of 385 secondary school students from grades 8 to 12 in Delhi have been collected through a Google Form Questionnaire. The study was conducted in the months of January and February 2021. Statistical techniques, such as Descriptive Statistics, Chi-Square Test, Factor Analysis, Reliability Test and Logistic Regression, were used for analyzing the data. The Logistic Regression result shows that the quality of Internet, prior knowledge of ICT, family income, mother’s education and the number of rooms are positively impacting online classes. The findings of the study revealed that, on average, students have positive perceptions towards online classes during the pandemic to maintain their academic growth. Nonetheless, they experienced several challenges in online classes. Thus, the outcome of this research study will encourage policy makers and educational institutes to handle online classes in a better way, by adopting the latest techniques of online classes and by training teachers and students continuously so that the teaching–learning process becomes more enjoyable and effective during this ongoing pandemic.

We tested the hypothesis that FDA-approved antiretrovirals, antibiotics, and antimalarials will effectively inhibit COVID-19 two major drug targets, coronavirus nucleocapsid protein (NP) and hemagglutinin-esterase (HE). To test this hypothesis, we carried out a phylogenic analysis of coronavirus genome to understand the origins of NP and HE, and also modeled the proteins before molecular docking, druglikeness, toxicity assessment, molecular dynamics simulation (MDS) and ligand-based pharmacophore modeling of the selected FDA-approved drugs. Our models for NP and HE had over 95% identity with templates 5EPW and 3CL5 respectively in the PDB database, with majority of the amino acids occupying acceptable regions. The active sites of the proteins contained conserved residues that were involved in ligand binding. Lopinavir and ritonavir possessed greater binding affinities for NP and HE relative to remdesivir, while levofloxacin and hydroxychloroquine were the most notable among the other classes of drugs. The Root Mean Square Deviation (RMSD), Root Mean Square Fluctuation (RMSF), Radius of gyration (Rg), and binding energy values obtained after 100 ns of MDS revealed good stability of these compounds in the binding sites of the proteins while important pharmacophore features were also identified. The study showed that COVID-19 likely originated from bat, owing to the over 90% genomic similarity observed, and that lopinavir, levofloxacin, and hydroxychloroquine might serve as potential anti-COVID-19 lead molecules for additional optimization and drug development for the treatment of COVID-19.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

METHODS: The patients who required a primary RCT were selected. Demographic, preoperative, and postoperative variables were registered, including perceived dental anxiety, fear, HR, and SpO2. Spearman correlation, chi-square, Mann-Whitney, and Kruskal-Wallis tests were used for frequency distribution and variable interaction, and Wilcoxon and Mann-Whitney tests were used to compare HR and SpO2 between groups and different treatment points. RESULTS: Ninety-six patients were included. The median Modified Dental Anxiety Scale scores were 8 (interquartile range [IQR], 6-9.25) and 6 (IQR, 5.5-8) in patients treated during the strict and partial confinement periods. The median fear scores were 2 (IQR, 0-5) and 3 (IQR, 1-5), respectively. Having a previous dental bad experience resulted in higher dental anxiety and fear (P < .05). HR was increased in patients with higher MDAS and fear scores and in those treated during the strict confinement (P < .05). In treatment time points T6 (x-ray taking), and T7 (post-treatment), HR decreased compared with the other evaluated treatment time points (P < .05). No clinical differences were found regarding SpO2. CONCLUSIONS: Self-perception on dental anxiety and fear was similar to other studies in a nonpandemic context. Patients with higher levels of dental anxiety and those treated in the strict confinement period presented an elevated HR. However, it can be stated that RCT performed by endodontists does not result in a significant alteration in patients.","Olivieri, Juan Gonzalo; de España, Carlota; Encinas, Marc; Ruiz, Xavier-Fructuós; Miró, Queralt; Ortega-Martinez, Jordi; Durán-Sindreu, Fernando",J. endod,420,24

Much to our surprise these homoleptic cuprates, argentates, and aurates are stable enough to be isolated even in the absence of any strongly binding phosphines or N-heterocyclic carbenes as coligands. Their metal atoms are coordinated by two silylchalcogenido ligands in a linear fashion. The silyl moieties of all anions show an unexpected gauche conformation of the silyl substituents with respect to the central axis Si-[E-M-E]-Si in the solid state. The energetic preference for the gauche conformation is confirmed by quantum chemical calculations and amounts to about 2-6 kJ/mol, thus revealing a rather shallow potential mainly depending on electronic effects of the metal. Furthermore, 2D HMQC methods were applied to detect the otherwise nonobservable NMR shifts of the 29Si and 77Se nuclei of the silylselenido compounds. Preliminary investigations reveal that these thermally and protolytically labile chalcogenido metalates are valuable precursors for the precipitation of binary coinage metal chalcogenide nanoparticles from organic solution and for coinage metal cluster syntheses.","Guschlbauer, Jannick; Vollgraff, Tobias; Xie, Xiulan; Weigend, Florian; Sundermeyer, Jörg",Inorg. chem,420,28

Du fait de sa proximité avec le géant brésilien, une reprise épidémique avec le variant 20J/501Y.V3 est à craindre. L’effort majeur accordé à l’obtention d’une couverture vaccinale suffisante, qui permettrait de réduire l’impact d’une 3e vague est contraint par des freins culturels et ethniques importants et très différents d’une commune à l’autre vis-à-vis de la vaccination. Matériels et méthodes La mise en place de la vaccination a nécessité l’élaboration de procédures spécifiques à chaque commune en fonction notamment des groupes culturels. Une description des constats et modalités d’intervention originales dans les communes isolées de ce territoire est réalisée. Résultats À Saint-Georges de l’Oyapock, ville frontalière avec le Brésil, la population est composée principalement de Créoles, d’Amérindiens Palikur et de Brésiliens vivant de part et d’autres du fleuve Oyapock. La localisation stratégique de cette commune a nécessité de mettre en place une action initiale de sensibilisation puis une stratégie de vaccination massive ponctuelle suivie de la mise en place d’un vaccinodrome. À Camopi et Trois Sauts, sur le Haut Oyapock, la population amérindienne Wayãpi et Teko a une adhésion lente et progressive à la vaccination, et quelques doses sont injectées de façon hebdomadaire. À Cacao, situé à 1h30 de route de Cayenne, la population Hmong originaires du Laos, présente une acceptabilité élevée du vaccin qui a été renforcée après une réunion avec les chefs des familles du village. Sur le Haut Maroni, en pays Amérindien Wayana, une rencontre avec les chefs coutumiers, plutôt réticents, a eu lieu. La vague épidémique de juillet 2020 aurait touché une part importante de la population avec une morbimortalité ressentie très modérée incitant les chefs à temporiser la décision d’encourager leurs populations à se faire vacciner. Enfin, chez les bushinenges du Maroni, descendants des esclaves africains du Suriname, les opinions anti-vaccin sont majoritaires. Les fausses rumeurs et théories complotistes circulent largement au sein de cette population transfrontalière limitant le lancement de la vaccination. Conclusion La progression de la couverture vaccinale est freinée par le vaccinosepticisme d’une partie importante de la population de Guyane ayant entraîné fin mars un élargissement des indications a tous les personnes de plus de 30 ans vivant sur le territoire guyanais avec uniquement le vaccin Pfizer, l’AztraZeneca ayant été récusé du fait du risque d’échec face au variant V3. Ce scepticisme contraste avec l’avidité à se faire vacciner de la population brésilienne vivant en Guyane et de l’autre côté des frontières, lié à la situation sanitaire préoccupante et les difficultés d’accès au vaccin dans leur pays. Le travail de sensibilisation se poursuit adapté à chaque communauté. La course contre la montre est engagée, face à l’arrivée imminente d’une 3e vague en lien avec le variant amazonien mais également avec ceux importés de métropole.","Epelboin, L.; Michaud, C.; Bidaud, B.; Dudognon, L.; Cochet, C.; Caspar, C.; Jacoud, E.; Servas, V.; Vignier, N.; Gaillet, M.",Infectious Diseases Now,420,1

Information about the prognostic significance of functional status in older patients with COVID-19 is scarce. METHODS: Demographic, clinical, laboratory and short-term mortality data were collected of 186 consecutive patients aged &#8805; 65 years hospitalized with COVID-19. The data were compared between 4 study groups: (1) age 65-79 years without severe functional dependency; (2) age &#8805; 80 years without severe functional dependency; (3) age 65-79 years with severe functional dependency; and (4) age &#8805; 80 years with severe functional dependency. Multivariate logistic regressions were performed to evaluate the variables that were most significantly associated with mortality in the entire sample. RESULTS: Statistically significant differences were observed between the groups in the proportions of males (p = 0.007); of patients with diabetes mellitus (p = 0.025), cerebrovascular disease (p < 0.001), renal failure (p = 0.003), dementia (p < 0.001), heart failure (p = 0.005), pressure sores (p < 0.001) and malignant disorders (p = 0.007); and of patients residing in nursing homes (p < 0.001). Compared to groups 1 (n = 69) and 2 (n = 28), patients in groups 3 (n = 32) and 4 (n = 57) presented with lower mean serum albumin levels on admission (p < 0.001), and were less often treated with convalescent plasma (p < 0.001), tocilizumab (p < 0.001) and remdesivir (p < 0.001). The overall mortality rate was 23.1 %. The mortality rate was higher in group 4 than in groups 1 - 3: 45.6 % vs. 8.7 %, 17.9% and 18.3 %, respectively (p < 0.001). On multivariate analysis, both age &#8805; 80 years and severe functional dependency were among the variables most significantly associated with mortality in the entire cohort (odds ratio [OR] 4.83, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 1.88 - 12.40, p < 0.001 and OR 2.51, 95 % CI 1.02 - 6.15, p = 0.044, respectively). Age &#8805; 80 years with severe functional dependency (group 4) remained one of the variables most significantly associated with mortality (OR 10.42, 95 % CI 3.27-33.24 and p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with COVID-19, the association of severe functional dependency with mortality is stronger among those aged &#8805; 80 years than aged 65-79 years. Assessment of functional status may contribute to decision making for care of older inpatients with COVID-19.","Plotnikov, Galina; Waizman, Efraim; Tzur, Irma; Yusupov, Alexander; Shapira, Yonatan; Gorelik, Oleg",BMC Geriatr,420,30

The goal of this study is to offer an agile typology of communication between migrant children in Poland and their grandparents in other countries. It points to two types of family communication practices, namely direct (face-to-face) and technology-mediated communication (TMC). Drawing on data from a qualitative study of immigrant children (n = 19) and parents (n = 18) conducted during the lockdown and associated travel restrictions caused by the pandemic, the study offers a typology of emotional, symbolic, mediated, and discontinuous modes of intergenerational family communications. It also indicates that cessation of direct contact during an “immobility regime” reduces the scope of intergenerational communication in transnational families.

Isso se torna ainda mais importante no contexto da pandemia da Covid-19, já que se vivencia uma nova prioridade de saúde. Entretanto, o que se tem observado ao longo da pandemia da Covid-19 é um despreparo profissional para um cuidado integral em saúde que considere as pessoas e comunidades historicamente invisibilizadas. Objetivo: Analisar criticamente as questões das diversidades em relação às Diretrizes Curriculares Nacionais para os Cursos de Graduação em Medicina (DCN).

Objective: Our aim is to scope the evidence base on apps that were developed in response to COVID-19. Methods: Following the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines for scoping reviews, literature searches were conducted on Google Search, Google Scholar, and PubMed using the country's name as keywords and ""coronavirus,"" ""COVID-19,"" ""nCOV19,"" ""contact tracing,"" ""information providing apps,"" ""symptom tracking,"" ""mobile apps,"" ""mobile applications,"" ""smartphone,"" ""mobile phone,"" and ""mHealth."" Countries most affected by COVID-19 and those that first rolled out COVID-19-related apps were included. Results: A total of 46 articles were reviewed from 19 countries, resulting in a total of 29 apps. Among them, 15 (52%) apps were on contact tracing, 7 (24%) apps on quarantine, 7 (24%) on symptom monitoring, and 1 (3%) on information provision. More than half (n=20, 69%) were from governmental sources, only 3 (10%) were from private organizations, and 3 (10%) from universities. There were 6 (21%) apps available on either Android or iOS, and 10 (34%) were available on both platforms. Bluetooth was used in 10 (34%) apps for collecting data, 12 (41%) apps used GPS, and 12 (41%) used other forms of data collection. Conclusions: This review identifies that the majority of COVID-19 apps were for contact tracing and symptom monitoring. However, these apps are effective only if taken up by the community. The sharing of good practices across different countries can enable governments to learn from each other and develop effective strategies to combat and manage this pandemic.","John Leon Singh, Hanson; Couch, Danielle; Yap, Kevin",JMIR Nurs,420,21

Air quality index and average humidity are selected from the family of climate variables, to determine its impact on the daily new cases of COVID-19-related deaths in Wuhan, China. We have used wavelet analysis (wavelet transform coherence (WTC), partial (PWC), and multiple wavelet coherence (MWC), due to its advantages over traditional time series methods, to study the co-movement nexus between our selected data series. Findings suggest a notable coherence between air quality index, humidity, and mortality in Wuhan during a recent outbreak. Humidity is negatively related to the COVID-19-related deaths, and bad air quality leads to an increase in this mortality. These findings are important for policymakers to save precious human lives by better understanding the interaction of the environment with the COVID-19 disease.","Fareed, Zeeshan; Iqbal, Najaf; Shahzad, Farrukh; Shah, Syed Ghulam Meran; Zulfiqar, Bushra; Shahzad, Khurram; Hashmi, Shujahat Haider; Shahzad, Umar",Air Qual Atmos Health,420,9

METHODS AND RESULTS: We evaluated the clinical course of eight COVID-19 patients, including their duration of viral shedding, by PCR testing of nasopharyngeal swabs. The average time from the onset of symptoms until the virus was no longer detectable was 31.6 ± 11.8 days (mean ± SD; range 17-53). Thus, it took 15.1 ± 14.7 (1-40) days from the time of clinical recovery for the virus to become undetectable. In two patients who had mental retardation and psychiatric disorders, the viral shedding period continued for 44 days or 53 days. These two patients did not voluntarily brush their teeth. When they were instructed on the importance of oral care, including tooth brushing and gargling, their tests for the coronavirus became negative. CONCLUSION: Most of the patients with COVID-19 had a viral shedding period of 30 days or less. In cases of prolonged viral shedding (&#8805;44 days), noninfectious viral nucleic acid may have accumulated in uncleaned oral cavities and continued to be detected. We propose that tooth brushing and gargling remove such viral nucleic acid and improve the accuracy of PCR testing.","Warabi, Yoko; Tobisawa, Shinsuke; Kawazoe, Tomoya; Murayama, Aki; Norioka, Ryohei; Morishima, Ryo; Inoue, Tomoyuki; Shimizu, Toshio; Takahashi, Kazushi",Spec. care dentist,420,6

Due to global travel, the new coronavirus has rapidly spread worldwide. This article aims to provide an overview of the challenges in implementing measures in the air and maritime transport sector from the perspective of the German Public Health Service (Öffentlicher Gesundheitsdienst, ÖGD). Significant events and measures for air and maritime transport between January and August 2020 were selected. Lessons learned are discussed.During the COVID-19 pandemic, the ÖGD has been operating in a field of tension between the dynamics of scientific knowledge, political decision-making, social acceptance and consent.There are specific challenges at points of entry such as airports and seaports. These include staff shortages and the need to implement measures with a high organisational effort at very short notice such as health authority passenger checks carried out on aircraft, the establishment of test centres at points of entry and control of compliance with quarantine measures. Aggravating the situation, passenger lists, which are necessary for effective contact tracing, are often not available or incomplete. There is also a lack of digital tools for contact tracing but also, for example, the exchange of personal data within the ÖGD. Further difficulties in outbreak management arise from the cramped conditions on board ships and from the potential psychological stress on crew members and passengers, which have not yet been sufficiently considered.In view of all these challenges, it is paramount to strengthen the German Public Health Service in general and at points of entry and to intensify the exchange between the national, federal state and local levels.","Kleine-Kampmann, Scarlett; Schöll, Meike; Ehlers, Lena; Hewelt, Elisabeth; Götsch, Udo; Göbels, Klaus; Ippisch, Siegfried; Seidel, Juliane; Thanheiser, Marc; Schindler, Bert; Kalkowski, Mathias; Boldt, Matthias; Dirksen-Fischer, Martin; von Münster, Thomas; Jeglitza, Matthias; Chmielewska, Justyna; Sangs, André; Mouchtouri, Barbara; Rexroth, Ute; An der Heiden, Maria",Bundesgesundheitsblatt Gesundheitsforschung Gesundheitsschutz,420,12

A novel coronavirus was identified in December 2019 in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China. This virus represents a new strain that has not been previously identified in humans. The virus is now known as the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the resulting disease is called coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the novel coronavirus outbreak a global pandemic in March 2020. Despite rigorous global containment and quarantine efforts, the incidence of COVID-19 continues to rise, with more than 1,948,617 laboratory-confirmed cases and over 121,846 deaths worldwide. Currently, no specific medication is recommended to treat COVID-19 patients. However, governments and pharmaceutical companies are struggling to quickly find an effective drug to defeat the coronavirus. In the current review, we summarize the existing state of knowledge about COVID-19, available medications, and treatment options. Favilavir is an antiviral drug that is approved in Japan for common influenza treatment and is now approved to treat symptoms of COVID-19 in China. Moreover, Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, drugs used to treat malaria and arthritis, respectively, were recommended by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China for treatment of COVID-19.

This patient exhibited a rapid evolution towards multiorgan failure. SARS-CoV-2 was detected in multiple nasopharyngeal, blood, and pleural samples, despite antiviral and immunomodulator treatment. Clinical evolution in the blood was marked by an increase (2-3-fold) in differentiated effector T cells expressing exhaustion (PD-1) and senescence (CD57) markers, an expansion of antibody-secreting cells, a 15-fold increase in Î³Î´ T cell and proliferating NK-cell populations, and the total disappearance of monocytes, suggesting lung trafficking. In the serum, waves of a pro-inflammatory cytokine storm, Th1 and Th2 activation, and markers of T cell exhaustion, apoptosis, cell cytotoxicity, and endothelial activation were observed until the fatal outcome. This case underscores the need for well-designed studies to investigate complementary approaches to control viral replication, the source of the hyperinflammatory status, and immunomodulation to target the pathophysiological response.

METHODS: Report a multisystem syndrome COVID-19 associated case, in a terciary public hospital in São Paulo, Brazil, during the pandemic (may, 2020). The follow-up was based on papers published by the Brazilian Pediatric Society in May 2020, about to the diagnosis and treatment in question, as well British Pediatric society Guidelines (April, 2020), and WHO reports (May, 2020) RESULTS: As the mentioned studies, in the begining patient had persistent fever, abdominal pain and rash mimetizing Kawasaki's Disease. He went through apendicectomy due to suspected appendicitis and lymph nodes with inflammatory signs were removed. On the second postoperative day, he presented respiratory distress, cardiogenic shock, kidney injury, coagulation disorder, miocardiac disfunction, hypersignal in coronary artery. As the most cases reported, PCR for SARS-COV-2 was negative, however serology for COVID-19 positive. This patient received mechanical ventilation, vasoactive drugs, high spectre antibiotic therapy and as suggested on the new guidelines: two days of immunoglobulin and iniciatede long therapy with Acetyl Salicylic Acid.

METHODS: Analytic performance of RT-PCR, HDPCR, and extraction-free HDPCR was established through replicate testing of a serially diluted clinical specimen containing SARS-CoV-2. A clinical comparison of all 3 assays was conducted using 351 prospectively collected upper respiratory swab specimens obtained from symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals collected in various transport media. RESULTS: RT-PCR and HDPCR assays using extracted nucleic acid demonstrated similar analytic limits of detection (LoD) and clinical performance, with 100% positive and negative agreement. Extraction-free HDPCR demonstrated a 1.5 to 2.0 log10 increase in LoD based on cycle threshold values. However, clinical performance of extraction-free HDPCR remained high, demonstrating 97.8% positive and 99.6% negative agreement with RT-PCR. An overall increase in ""invalid"" and ""presumptive"" results was observed when using the extraction-free method, but this was highly variable based on transport medium used. CONCLUSIONS: HDPCR performs similar to RT-PCR for the detection of SARS-CoV-2. The use of an extraction-free HDPCR protocol maintained high clinical performance despite reduced analytic LoD, with the benefit of reduced hands-on time and cost of reagents associated with nucleic acid extraction.","Buchan, Blake W; Gerstbrein, Derek; Cruz, Amorina; Hoff, Jess; Sievert, Emily; Ledeboer, Nathan A; Faron, Matthew L",Am. j. clin. pathol,420,4

Aims of our study are to describe prevalence and clinical features of neurological manifestations, mortality and hospital discharge in subjects hospitalized with COVID-19. All individuals admitted for to our hospital COVID-19 were retrospectively included. Patients were classified according to the symptoms at hospital entry in (1) isolated respiratory, (2) combined respiratory and neurologic, (3) isolated neurologic and (4) stroke manifestations. Descriptive statistics and nonparametric tests to compare the groups were calculated. Kaplan Meier probability curves and multivariable Cox regression models for survival and hospital discharge were applied. The analysis included 901 patients: 42.6% showed a severe or critical disease with an overall mortality of 21.2%. At least one neurological symptom or disease was observed in 30.2% of subjects ranging from dysgeusia/anosmia (9.1%) to postinfective diseases (0.8%). Patients with respiratory symptoms experienced a more severe disease and a higher in-hospital mortality compared to those who showed only neurologic symptoms. Kaplan Meier estimates displayed a statistically significant different survival among groups (p = 0.003): subjects with stroke had the worst. After adjusting for risk factors such as age, sex and comorbidity, individuals with isolated neurologic manifestations exhibited a better survival (aHR 0.398, 95% CI [0.206, 0.769], p = 0.006). Neurologic manifestations in COVID-19 are common but heterogeneous and mortality in subjects with isolated neurologic manifestations seems lower than in those with respiratory symptoms.","Travi, Giovanna; Rossotti, Roberto; Merli, Marco; D039,; Amico, Federico; Chiappetta, Stefania; Giussani, Giuditta; Panariello, Adelaide; Corradin, Matteo; Vecchi, Marta; Raimondi, Alessandro; Baiguera, Chiara; Nocita, Benedetta; Epis, Oscar Massimiliano; Tarsia, Paolo; Galbiati, Filippo; Colombo, Fabrizio; Fumagalli, Roberto; Scaglione, Francesco; Moreno, Mauro; Percudani, Mauro Emilio; Agostoni, Elio Clemente; Puoti, Massimo",Eur. j. neurosci,420,1

This study examined CSF for biomarkers of CNS injury and other pathology in relation to neurological symptoms and disease severity in patients with neurological manifestations of COVID-19. METHODS: Nineteen patients with neurological symptoms and mild to critical COVID-19 were prospectively included. Extensive analysis of CSF, including measurement of biomarkers of CNS injury (neurofilament light chain [NfL] protein, glial fibrillary acidic protein [GFAp], and total tau), was performed and compared to neurological features and disease severity. RESULTS: Neurological symptoms included altered mental status (42%), headache (42%), and central (21%) and peripheral weakness (32%). Two patients demonstrated minor pleocytosis, and four patients had increased immunoglobulin G levels in CSF. Neuronal autoantibody testing using commercial tests was negative in all patients. Increased CSF levels of NfL protein, total tau, and GFAp were seen in 63%, 37%, and 16% of patients, respectively. Increased NfL protein correlated with disease severity, time in intensive care, and level of consciousness. NfL protein in CSF was higher in patients with central neurological symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Although limited by the small sample size, our data suggest that levels of NfL protein, GFAp, and total tau in CSF are commonly elevated in patients with COVID-19 with neurological symptoms. This is in contrast to the standard CSF workup where pathological findings are scarce. NfL protein, in particular, is associated with central neurological symptoms and disease severity.","Virhammar, Johan; Nääs, Anja; Fällmar, David; Cunningham, Janet L; Klang, Andrea; Ashton, Nicholas J; Jackmann, Sven; Westman, Gabriel; Frithiof, Robert; Blennow, Kaj; Zetterberg, Henrik; Kumlien, Eva; Rostami, Elham",Eur. j. neurol,420,29

Although a laboratory test is the current routine diagnostic tool, it is time-consuming, imposing a high cost and requiring a well-equipped laboratory for analysis. Computed tomography (CT) has thus far become a fast method to diagnose patients with COVID-19. However, the performance of radiologists in diagnosis of COVID-19 was moderate. Accordingly, additional investigations are needed to improve the performance in diagnosing COVID-19. In this study is suggested a rapid and valid method for COVID-19 diagnosis using an artificial intelligence technique based. 1020 CT slices from 108 patients with laboratory proven COVID-19 (the COVID-19 group) and 86 patients with other atypical and viral pneumonia diseases (the non-COVID-19 group) were included. Ten well-known convolutional neural networks were used to distinguish infection of COVID-19 from non-COVID-19 groups: AlexNet, VGG-16, VGG-19, SqueezeNet, GoogleNet, MobileNet-V2, ResNet-18, ResNet-50, ResNet-101, and Xception. Among all networks, the best performance was achieved by ResNet-101 and Xception. ResNet-101 could distinguish COVID-19 from non-COVID-19 cases with an AUC of 0.994 (sensitivity, 100%; specificity, 99.02%; accuracy, 99.51%). Xception achieved an AUC of 0.994 (sensitivity, 98.04%; specificity, 100%; accuracy, 99.02%). However, the performance of the radiologist was moderate with an AUC of 0.873 (sensitivity, 89.21%; specificity, 83.33%; accuracy, 86.27%).

Although not powered to detect a change in mortality, marked improvements were seen in survival (adjusted HR, 0.39; 95% CI, 0.26 to 0.59; p<0.001). Beta blockers are one of the most studied groups of drugs but their effect in septic shock is poorly understood; proposed mechanisms include not only the modulation of cardiac function but also immunomodulation. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: STRESS-L is a randomised, open-label, non-blinded clinical trial which is enrolling a total of 340 patients with septic shock as defined by Sepsis-3 consensus definition and a tachycardia (heart rate &#8805;95 beats per minute (bpm)) after vasopressor treatment of at least 24 hours. Standard randomisation (1:1 ratio) allocates patients to receive usual care (according to international standards) versus usual care and a continuous landiolol infusion to reduce the heart rate between 80 and 94 bpm. The primary endpoint is the mean Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score over 14 days from entry into the trial and while in intensive care unit.

We evaluated the impact of interleukin (IL)-6 blockade with tocilizumab on SARS-CoV-2 viral kinetics and the antibody response in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: Prospective cohort study in patients admitted with COVID-19. Serial nasopharyngeal and plasma samples were measured for SARS-CoV-2 RNA and S-IgG/N-IgG titers, respectively. FINDINGS: 138 patients with confirmed infection were included; 76 (55%) underwent IL-6 blockade. Median initial SOFA (p = 0â¢016) and SARS-CoV-2 viral load (p<0â¢001, Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon test) were significantly higher among anti-IL-6 users. Patients under IL-6 blockade showed delayed viral clearance in the Kaplan-Meier curves (HR 0â¢35 [95%CI] [0â¢15-0â¢81], log-rank p = 0â¢014), but an adjusted propensity score matching model did not demonstrate a significant relationship of IL-6 blockade with viral clearance (HR 1â¢63 [0â¢35-7â¢7]). Cox regression showed an inverse association between SARS-CoV-2 RNA clearance and the initial viral load (HR 0â¢35 [0â¢11-0â¢89]). Patients under the IL-6 blocker showed shorter median time to seropositivity, higher peak antibody titers, and higher cumulative proportion of seropositivity in the Kaplan Meier curves (HR 3â¢1 [1â¢9-5] for S-IgG; and HR 3â¢0 [1â¢9-4â¢9] for N-IgG; log-rank p<0â¢001 for both). However, no significant differences between groups were found in either S-IgG (HR 1â¢56 [0â¢41-6â¢0]) nor N-IgG (HR 0â¢96 [0â¢26-3â¢5]) responses in an adjusted propensity score analysis. INTERPRETATION: Our results suggest that in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, IL-6 blockade does not impair the viral specific antibody responses.

Although the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has not yet provided any recommendations for the use of portable air purifiers, air purifiers with high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters have been discussed as an adjunctive means for decontamination of SARS-CoV-2 aerosols in health care settings. This commentary discusses HEPA filter mechanisms of action, decontamination time based on efficiency and flow rate, theoretical application to SARS-CoV-2, and limitations. HEPA filter functionality and prior guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for SARS-CoV-1 suggest theoretical efficacy for HEPA filters to decontaminate airborne SARS-CoV-2, although direct studies for SARS-CoV-2 have not been performed. Any portable HEPA purifier utilization for SARS-CoV-2 should be considered an adjunctive infection control measure and undertaken with knowledge of HEPA filter functionality and limitations in mind.","Christopherson, David A; Yao, William C; Lu, Mingming; Vijayakumar, R; Sedaghat, Ahmad R",Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,420,0

Disparities in the consultation burden of sub-specialities and socio-demographic differences in teleconsultation utilization were also assessed. METHODS: Al-Shifa Trust Eye Hospital Rawalpindi began audio and video teleconsultation using broadband telecommunication services during the lockdown. Patients' and consultations' data gathered during the first three weeks after the commencement of this programme were compared with data from the four weeks prior to lockdown. The weekly consultation ratio and overall consultation burden of sub-specialities were measured. Chi-Square tests of association determined the relationship between different variables (socioeconomic status and consultation characteristics) and consultation modality (on-site vs online). RESULTS: In total, 17507 on-site consultations (4377/week) were conducted compared to 1431 teleconsultations (477/week), which maintained 10.89% of the weekly pre-lockdown eye care services. The post-lockdown teleconsultation programme saw a relatively higher percentage of service utility among female (47.09% vs 44.71%), younger-age (31.33±19.45 vs 41.25±23.32 years) and higher-socioeconomic-status (32.21% vs 0.30%) patients compared to pre-lockdown on-site consultations. The most common indication for teleconsultation was red-eye (16.70%). While cornea and glaucoma clinics maintained most of the pre-lockdown services (30.42% and 29% respectively), the highest dropout was seen in optometric and vitreoretinal services supporting only 5.54% and 8.28% of pre-lockdown services, respectively. CONCLUSION: Digital initiatives could partially maintain eye care services during the lockdown. Focused strategies to improve teleconsultation utilization are required during the pandemic and beyond.","Mansoor, Hassan; Khan, Saad Alam; Afghani, Tayyab; Assir, Muhammad Zaman; Ali, Mahmood; Khan, Wajid Ali",PLoS One,420,24

Respiratory diseases, neoplasms, cardiopathies and hypertension, and diabetes are associated with higher COVID-19 case-fatality. The study aimed to identify the regions of Brazil with higher specific mortality rates from these comorbidities and the regions with the greatest shortage of ICU beds and mechanical ventilators. A cross-sectional ecological study was performed in which the units of analysis were the country's Health Regions. Data were obtained from Brazilian Health Informatics Department - DATASUS (National Registry of Healthcare Establishments - 2019, Mortality Information Systems - 2017, and Population Projections - 2017). We calculated the disease group-specific mortality rates for hypertension, neoplasms, diabetes, cardiac diseases, respiratory diseases and the rates of total ICU beds, private ICU beds, ICU beds in the Brazilian Unified National Health System (SUS), and ventilators in the SUS, per 100,000 inhabitants. The mortality profile was determined by latent profiles analysis, and the cluster analysis of ICU beds and ventilators used the spatial scan method. Kernel maps were constructed for the data's visualization. Level of significance was set at 5%. Four latent mortality profiles were observed. The Health Regions with the highest mean mortality rates were located in regions with shortages of ICU beds and ventilators, especially in parts of the Northeast, Southeast, and South of Brazil. The spatial localization of regions with both the highest mortality and shortages of ICU beds/ventilators requires attention by policymakers and public planners to deal efficiently and fairly with the COVID-19 epidemic in Brazil.","Moreira, Rafael da Silveira",Cad Saude Publica,420,1

Nurses meet patients with coronavirus disease and offer care for newly communicable diseases. Despite global and national efforts to prevent the spread, the outbreak is still on a rise, and studies on the health care behaviors of nurses were scarce in the study setting. Therefore, this study was intended in addressing nurses’ intention to care for coronavirus disease 19 patients and its determinants among nurses working at Debre Tabor town Health Care Institutions, 2020. Methodology: An institutional-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 163 nurses working at health care institutions of Debre Tabor Town, from June 01 to 15/2020. The data were collected using tools with a self-administration questionnaire adapted from the theory of planned behavior and different kinds of literatures. All nurses working at Debre Tabor health care institutions were included. Data were entered using Epi-data 4.2.0.0 statistical software, and analysis was done by Stata version 14 statistical software. Binary logistic regression model was used for analysis. Strength of association was measured using the odds ratio with 95% CI, and the level of significance was estimated at P-value ≤ 0.05. Results: Nurses’ intention to care for COVID-19 patient was 59.5% (95% CI;58.7:60.3). Having better working experience (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) =2.3:95% CI;1.120, 4.910), caring experience for infectious disease (AOR=2.5;95% CI: 1.10, 5.50), good perceived behavioral control (AOR=2.33;95% CI: 1.13, 4.8), and subjective norms (AOR= 2.14;95% CI: 1.05, 4.36) were significantly associated with intention of caring behavior. Conclusion: Nurses’ intention to care for COVID-19 patients was low. Working experience, the experience of caring for infectious disease, self-efficacy, and subjective norm were independently related with nurses’ caring intention. The government should work on improving nurse’s confidence in disaster management, design disaster management nursing education, and frequent support of nurses.","Minuye, Binyam Wubet Alebachew Kebede Melese Asnakew Sintayehu Demeke Mesfin Belay",Risk Management and Healthcare Policy,420,16

This proposed technique provides high gain beams towards the gateway node which may be located indoor or outdoor based on the medical quarantine or isolation topology and help medical staff monitor patients with less contact and infection probability. Also, a semi-blind switched-beam algorithm is developed to both reduce the processing time required for beam selection and reduce the power loss due to the off-mainlobe orientation of the selected beam with the signal direction. The proposed technique is analyzed at different wearing scenarios and simulation results show that the received power levels are improved with as less as 0.3 dBm standard deviation which helps in extending the communication range between the WBAN aggregator and gateway nodes in the health monitoring system and also extend the battery lifetime at the patient WBAN.","Albagory, Yasser",AEU Int.

The impact of CBT depends on the reversal of an exhausted T-cell immune phenotype and a consequential increase in the immunological, anti-tumor effect derived from a patient's adaptive immunity. As most patients with classical Hodgkin lymphoma will relapse during or after this treatment, clinicians often provide consolidation with allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (alloHCT) is fit patients. However, the mechanisms responsible for CBT efficacy can also be those that increase the risk of immunological complications after alloHCT. AREAS COVERED: We carried out in-depth research on current medical literature to report and discuss the mechanism of action of CBT within a cHL setting; clinical results of CBT in cHL setting pre-alloHCT and post-alloHCT; interactions between CBT and alloHCT; and further clinical considerations. EXPERT OPINION: Checkpoint blockade therapy is an effective strategy for relapsed/refractory cHL. Its use is associated with higher immunological toxicities when administered before or after alloHCT. Whenever alloHCT is planned, clinicians should follow international recommendations such as using post-transplant cyclophosphamide GVHD prophylaxis.","Mussetti, Alberto; Bosch Vilaseca, Anna; Parody, Rocío; Paviglianiti, Annalisa; Domingo-Domenech, Eva; Sureda, Ana Maria",Expert rev. hematol,420,1

The authors describe three patients who had confirmed COVID-19 and met the criteria for hospital admission but could not be assigned a hospital bed in a resource-limited country. The patients included a 72-year-old male, an 82-year-old female, and a 56-year-old male. They typically presented with fever, dyspnea, loss of taste and smell, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. Oxygen saturation during the initial evaluation ranged from 80-89%. Laboratory results reported lymphopenia and neutrophilia, with leukocytosis in two patients. Inflammatory markers were also elevated for all three patients. CT scan findings showed bilateral ground-glass pulmonary opacities. SARS-CoV-2 was confirmed in all three patients by real time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing. Home-based treatment was established. At the time of writing this report, all patients remain asymptomatic and with negative COVID-19 testing. Telemedicine and home-based treatment were essential assets in the care of these severely ill patients living in a low-resource setting where not all patients who have criteria to be admitted into the hospital are able to find a place in a collapsed health care system.

This insight highlights that these disorders are not just localized to dysfunction within the brain, but also have a systemic aspect, which accounts for the frequent comorbid presentation of chronic inflammatory conditions and metabolic syndromes. It is possible that a treatment resistant subgroup of neuropsychiatric patients may benefit from treatment regimens that target their associated proinflammatory state. Lifestyle factors such as physical activity (PA) and exercise (i.e. structured PA) are known to influence mental health. In turn, mental disorders may limit health-seeking behaviors - a proposed ""bidirectional relationship"" that perpetuates psychopathology. PA is renowned for its positive physical, physiological and mental health benefits. Evidence now points to inflammatory pathways as a potential mechanism for PA in improving mental illness. Relevant pathways include modulation of immune-neuroendocrine and neurotransmitter systems, the production of tissue-derived immunological factors that alter the inflammatory milieu and neurotrophins that are critical mediators of neuroplasticity. In this paper, we will focus on the role of PA in positively improving mental health through potential modulation of chronic inflammation, which is often found in individuals with mental disorders. In a related paper by Edirappuli and colleagues (2020), we will focus on the role of nutrition (another significant lifestyle factor) on mental health. Thus, inflammation appears to be a central process underlying mental illness, which may be mitigated by lifestyle modifications. Lifestyle factors are advantageous as first-line interventions due to their cost efficacy, low side-effect profile, and both preventative and therapeutic attributes. By promoting these lifestyle modifications and addressing their limitations and barriers to their adoption, it is hoped that their preventative and remedial benefits may galvanize therapeutic progress for neuropsychiatric disorders.","Venkatesh, Ashwin; Edirappuli, Shantal D; Zaman, Haris Pedersen; Zaman, Rashid",Psychiatr Danub,420,16

Tinto's (2017) model of student motivation and persistence is reconceptualised to apply to the academic staff by considering their self-efficacy beliefs, sense of belonging and perceptions of career relevance on their motivation levels and adaption to a new environment. Design/methodology/approach Utilising Tinto's (2017) reconceptualised model for academics, this study provides insights into motivation and capacity to adapt during the COVID-19 pandemic. This paper presents observations and reflections from five academics from three universities across two countries in relation to self-efficacy, sense of belonging and perception of career relevance. Findings The findings of this study state that self-efficacy beliefs, a sense of belonging and perceptions of career relevance combine to drive both academics' motivation levels and their ability to adapt to the changing landscape. Self-efficacy was influenced by factors such as struggles with adaptation to new online technologies and researching and teaching in a virtual environment. Academics' sense of belonging was found to be challenged in unprecedented ways because of physical isolation and sometimes unfavourable home working environments. Perceptions of career relevance were found to be challenged by adverse developments such as reduced promotional opportunities, cuts in resourcing and job insecurity. Originality/value This paper makes three important contributions. First, Tinto's (2017) model of student motivation and persistence is extended to examine academic motivation, adaption and persistence. Second, the model is applied to a crisis where staff face greater strain in maintaining connection to their colleagues and their university. Third, the influence of the COVID-19 crisis is examined by using the reconceptualised Tinto (2017) model in the context of accounting, as accounting international student enrolments and associated revenue streams have been impacted significantly more than those of many other disciplines.","Beatson, N.; de Lange, P.; O039,; Connell, B.; Tharapos, M.; Smith, J.

The fight against this fatal virus demands the united force of healthcare workers, including nurse interns. Therefore, being unprepared for a crisis of this magnitude which never happened in a century, how do nurse interns perceive their quality of life being caught amidst the pandemic. Objectives: This study aimed to provide answers to the following 1) What is the demographic profile of the participants; 2) what are the responses of the participants in the Quality of Life for Nursing Internship Students Scale?; 3) What is the difference in the responses of the participants to the domains of the scale; 4) what is the relationship between each demographic profile of the participants to their responses to the domains of the scale? Methods: This study used a quantitative cross-sectional design through an electronic survey form in the collection of data. A total of 152 nurse interns in Saudi Arabia completed the survey. Results: Across the 22-item questionnaire, the nurse interns still feel safe being in the hospital, clinic, or other healthcare facilities with a mean of 3.32 while item 8, which is having abundant energy, had the lowest mean of 1.91. The overall mean is 2.61, interpreted as 'important.' Conclusion: This study found out despite being amid a pandemic, the quality of life of nurse interns is within fair and manageable boundaries. Further, it showed that their social and psychological preparedness are intact and resilient.","Rizal Angelo Grande, Rizal; Edward R Butcon, Vincent; Charito Laarni Indonto, Maria; Mendizabal Villacorte, Liza; Joseph E Berdida, Daniel",Int J Afr Nurs Sci,420,16

For this, the study was conducted in Bhadaure-Tamagi village of the Panchase Protected Forest Area of Gandaki Province, which was planned to be developed as an important tourist destination for tourists visiting Pokhara because of its cultural and natural importance. Mixed-method research approach was implemented in this research for data collection and analysis. One hundred and twenty-two tourism stakeholders (30 hoteliers, 40 homestay owners, and 52 tourists) were surveyed for quantitative data collection and analysis along with seven key informant interviews (KII) for qualitative data collection and analysis. It was observed that the current demand for accommodation facilities in the Bhadaure-Tamagi village was 23,390 bed nights per annum. The tourism demand in terms of tourism revenues estimated through this study amounted to a total of US$10,763.67 per year. The occupancy rate of accommodation facilities at Bhadaure-Tamagi village was a mere 20%, which is well below the national and international average. Despite outstanding ecotourism opportunities and a necessary regulatory framework in place, the SWOT analysis revealed that the tourism sector development is not satisfactory.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients undergoing PD who were followed up during the NCP epidemic by our hospital were enrolled in this study. Because of the need to control the epidemic, a follow-up system was established during the epidemic period, with WeChat, QQ, and the telephone as the main methods of communication. Outpatient and emergency follow-ups were carried out to ensure the safety of dialysis and the prevention and control of the epidemic. The follow-up strategy included response measures related to the epidemic situation, prevention of peritonitis related to PD, water and salt control, exercise guidance, and psychological care. According to the patient's condition, the appointment system was implemented, with one consulting room and one process for each patient. The emergency patients were isolated in accordance with the epidemic situation. RESULTS: Since January 2020, among the 580 patients undergoing PD who were followed up in our department and their families, none had NCP infection. During the epidemic period, the standard hemoglobin level and the inpatient rate decreased. Complications related to PD, such as peritonitis, cardiovascular complications caused by volume overload, and pulmonary infection, did not significantly increase, and the withdrawal rate and mortality rate decreased compared with those in the same period last year. CONCLUSIONS: The patient follow-up strategy during the epidemic period had a significant positive effect on preventing and controlling the epidemic. Furthermore, during the epidemic period, encouraging patients and caregivers to pay attention to protection at home, avoid going out, strengthen self-management, and other measures were beneficial to the control of kidney disease itself, which is worth promoting.

Health care providers are at the front line of fighting, as well as, at the risk of getting infected. Many attempts have been made to combat the disease are mostly focused on hospital settings rather than outpatient settings so far. Therefore, addressing the clinics and medical offices with numerous health care workers seems necessary. Methods: Using keywords COVID-19 OR SARS-COV-2 OR Corona virus, AND Infection control OR Prevention AND (Outpatient settings) OR clinics OR (medical offices) AND (health care workers) OR (health care personnel) in databases and pertinent sites: PubMed, Cochrane Library, Scopus, Up - to-date, Clinical Key, Google Scholar, guidelines, and health organization like CDC, W.H.O., high impact journals, and publications of Iran ministry of health related to outpatient settings, the medical literature for all published full text articles pertinent to medical practice in clinics and medical offices and COVID-19 disease were searched. All pertinent data were collected and then organized them in a step by step guide for health care workers. Results: Based on findings, the majority of patients (80%) with COVID-19 have mild disease and no need to primarily be admitted to hospitals. Since these patients are the source of infection, referrals to all clinics and hospitals have the risk of transmission of the infection to medical staff as well as, other non-COVID patients. They could be quarantined at home, evaluated by physicians via telemedicine, receive appropriate medical advice, and followed up regularly. Tele visit: Tele visit via telephone or video call eliminates unnecessary public or private transportation and the risk of transmission, as well as, face to face visits and exposing health care workers and other patients to the virus. Regarding limited health care resources, face to face unnecessary visits impose dual pressure upon an already overloaded health care system. Emergency departments and hospitals should be dedicated to the remaining 20% of COVID patients with moderate to severe disease Signs and Symptoms: Signs and symptoms of myriads of COVID-19 patients have been assessed. 27 signs and symptoms have been found common to patients. 4 out of 27 signs and symptoms most consistent with the disease are: fever, headache, fatigue, and myalgia/arthralgia. Moreover, one of the relatively characteristic symptoms of COVID-19 disease is, sudden and recently- onset loss of smell and taste in the context of other signs and symptoms. It should be differentiated from chronic and already present loss of smell, associated with chronic diseases like nasal polyposis, chronic sinusitis and neurologic problems. Signs and symptoms of hemodynamic instability, like hypotension and reduced urine output, as well as, decreased level of consciousness, and chest pain are alarming and should be sought. Patients with these conditions need to be admitted to hospitals. Approaching patients with dyspnea remotely, Physicians should consider differential diagnoses like exacerbation of asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), severe pneumonia, heart failure, pulmonary embolism, pericarditis, and anxiety. Oxygen saturation evaluation: Patients could be instructed to monitor their oxygen saturation by home pulse oximeters twice a day and report it to physicians. If oxygen saturation is 95% or more with room air, and not having other risk factors, they could remain quarantined at home. Patients with oxygen saturation of 94% or less should be visited face to face in medical centers. Elevator etiquette: If you have flu-like symptoms, do not use the elevator. Keep a distance of 1.5 meter from other riders. If the space is not enough, wait for the next turn ride or use the stairs. Don't touch the buttons with naked hands;Touch them with tissue paper or your elbow instead. Have disinfectant available and disinfect your hands before and after touching the buttons. Do not touch your eyes, mouth and nose after touching the buttons. Stay facing the walls of the elevator. Wash or disinfect your hands immediately after getting off the elevator in case of touching buttons. At the entrance of the clinic: Place posters, and stands with alarming and educational matters about COVID- 19 disease. Screen all patients, as well as, companions for the signs and symptoms of COVID-19. Limit the entrance of companions to the clinic and not allow those who were exposed to COVID patients in recent two weeks. Get all patients to wear masks and disinfect their hands with alcohol based disinfectant solutions before entering the clinic. Waiting room: Limit the number of patients at the waiting room. The distance between patients should be at least two meters. Put partition between them if it is feasible. Open the windows and doors 6-12 times per hour. Have disinfectant solutions in the waiting room and soap in the washing closet available to all patients. Cough etiquette: Cover your mouth and nose with tissue paper or your internal surface of your elbow in case of coughing or sneezing. Discard the tissues in dustbin after coughing or sneezing and wash your hands. Physician's room: Use a paperless system for transmitting medical records between physicians and secretory or para clinics. The distance between physician and patient should be at least 2 meters. Physicians should change the gloves after each visit. The disposable table cloth should be changed and the table and all the surfaces touched by the patient should be disinfected after each visit. Follow up of patients at home: Patients at home should be followed up regularly at daily basis and then setting up the frequency and duration of follow ups based on patient health condition. Personal protective equipment: Medical staff should wear full personal protective equipment including N-95 Masks, goggles, face shields, gowns and gloves. Monitoring medical and allied health care staff: Signs and symptoms of COVID-19 should be monitored regularly and the test RT-PCR should be performed every 3 days for health care workers in close contact with suspected COVID patients. Return to work: Health care personnel could return to work from 10 to 20 days after onset of the disease, provided that symptoms have resolved and had been afebrile without the use of antipyretics for at least 24 hours. Donning and Doffing: Errors in donning and doffing have been observed even among experienced personnel. Therefore, the order of donning and doffing of personal protective equipment should be followed for prevention of infection. Nebulizers and aerosol producing procedures: Given dispersing the virus particles by nebulizers around 10 meters, nebulizers and aerosol producing procedures, should not be used routinely in clinics unless the patient is isolated, the doors closed, and the personnel out of the room. Conclusion: COVID-19 is a newly emerged and highly contagious disease. Its diagnosis is based on multiple signs and symptoms, as well as, laboratory and imaging findings. This disease has no approved treatment and all medications are used based on clinical trials so far. Therefore, the best practice policy is prevention. One of the available facilities that could help in prevention of the disease is telemedicine. Around 80% of patients, who have mild disease, could be followed up, quarantined at home and managed by telemedicine. Those at home should be monitored daily and if their condition worsened need to be admitted to special centers dedicated to COVID-19 patients. They should not be referred to all clinics or admitted to all hospital wards. Unnecessary referrals lead to spread of the infection. Hospitals and clinics are already overloaded and medical personnel exhausted. Medical personnel, as national resources should be preserved for the remaining 20% of patients with moderate to severe disease. Since health care workers are exposed to the high load of the virus and they may receive the viral load from multiple sources, their disease is often more severe, the risk of mortal ty and the risk of transmitting the infection to others is higher than the general population. Therefore, providing them with full personal protective equipment and monitoring their health condition is essential. © 2020 Iran University of Medical Sciences.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 30 randomly selected clinical prostate VMAT plans were included. The used treatment planning system (TPS) was Monaco (Elekta, Crawley), and the secondary dose calculation software was SciMoCa (Scientific-RT, Munich). Monaco and SciMoCa work with a Monte Carlo algorithm. A plausibility check of Monaco and SciMoCa was performed using an ionization chamber in the BodyPhantom (BP). First, the original Monaco RT plans were verified with SciMoCa (pretreatment QA). Second, the corresponding 4-Hz log files were converted into RT log file plans and sent to SciMoCa as on-treatment QA. MLC shift errors were introduced for one prostate plan to determine the sensitivity of on-treatment QA. For pretreatment and on-treatment QA, a gamma analysis (2%/1mm/20%) was performed and dosimetric values of PTV and OARs were ascertained in SciMoCa. RESULTS: Plausibility check of TPS Monaco vs. BP measurement and SciMoCa vs. BP measurement showed valid accuracy for clinical VMAT QA. Using SciMoCa, there was no significant difference in PTV Dmean between RT plan and RT log file plan. Between pretreatment and on-treatment QA, PTV metrics, femur right and left showed no significant dosimetric differences as opposed to OARs rectum and bladder. The overall gamma passing rate (GPR) ranged from 96.10% to 100% in pretreatment QA and from 93.50% to 99.80% in on-treatment QA. MLC shift errors were identified for deviations larger than -0.50 mm and +0.75 mm using overall gamma criterion and PTV Dmean. CONCLUSION: SciMoCa calculations of Monaco RT plans and RT log file plans are in excellent agreement to each other. Therefore, 4-Hz log files and SciMoCa can replace labor-intensive phantom-based measurements as patient-specific QA.","Szeverinski, Philipp; Kowatsch, Matthias; Künzler, Thomas; Meinschad, Marco; Clemens, Patrick; DeVries, Alexander F",J. appl. clin. med. phys,420,24

Traditional surveys in the area of public health can be expensive and time-consuming, and they can rapidly become outdated. The analysis of big data sets (such as electronic patient records and surveillance systems) is very complex. Google Trends is an alternative approach that has been used in the past to analyze health behaviors; however, most existing studies on COVID-19 using these data examine a single issue or a limited geographic area. This paper explores Google Trends as a proxy for what people are thinking, needing, and planning in real time across the United States. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to use Google Trends to provide both insights into and potential indicators of important changes in information-seeking patterns during pandemics such as COVID-19. We asked four questions: (1) How has information seeking changed over time? (2) How does information seeking vary between regions and states? (3) Do states have particular and distinct patterns in information seeking? (4) Do search data correlate with-or precede-real-life events? METHODS: We analyzed searches on 38 terms related to COVID-19, falling into six themes: social and travel; care seeking; government programs; health programs; news and influence; and outlook and concerns. We generated data sets at the national level (covering January 1, 2016, to April 15, 2020) and state level (covering January 1 to April 15, 2020). Methods used include trend analysis of US search data; geographic analyses of the differences in search popularity across US states from March 1 to April 15, 2020; and principal component analysis to extract search patterns across states. RESULTS: The data showed high demand for information, corresponding with increasing searches for coronavirus linked to news sources regardless of the ideological leaning of the news source. Changes in information seeking often occurred well in advance of action by the federal government. The popularity of searches for unemployment claims predicted the actual spike in weekly claims. The increase in searches for information on COVID-19 care was paralleled by a decrease in searches related to other health behaviors, such as urgent care, doctor's appointments, health insurance, Medicare, and Medicaid. Finally, concerns varied across the country; some search terms were more popular in some regions than in others. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 is unlikely to be the last pandemic faced by the United States. Our research holds important lessons for both state and federal governments in a fast-evolving situation that requires a finger on the pulse of public sentiment. We suggest strategic shifts for policy makers to improve the precision and effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical interventions and recommend the development of a real-time dashboard as a decision-making tool.","Mangono, Tichakunda; Smittenaar, Peter; Caplan, Yael; Huang, Vincent S; Sutermaster, Staci; Kemp, Hannah; Sgaier, Sema K",J Med Internet Res,420,21

A major virulence factor of SARS-CoVs is the nonstructural protein 1 (Nsp1) which suppresses host gene expression by ribosome association. Here, we show that Nsp1 from SARS-CoV-2 binds to the 40S ribosomal subunit, resulting in shutdown of mRNA translation both in vitro and in cells. Structural analysis by cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) of in vitro reconstituted Nsp1-40S and various native Nsp1-40S and -80S complexes revealed that the Nsp1 C terminus binds to and obstructs the mRNA entry tunnel. Thereby, Nsp1 effectively blocks RIG-I-dependent innate immune responses that would otherwise facilitate clearance of the infection. Thus, the structural characterization of the inhibitory mechanism of Nsp1 may aid structure-based drug design against SARS-CoV-2.","Thoms, Matthias; Buschauer, Robert; Ameismeier, Michael; Koepke, Lennart; Denk, Timo; Hirschenberger, Maximilian; Kratzat, Hanna; Hayn, Manuel; Mackens-Kiani, Timur; Cheng, Jingdong; Straub, Jan H; Stürzel, Christina M; Fröhlich, Thomas; Berninghausen, Otto; Becker, Thomas; Kirchhoff, Frank; Sparrer, Konstantin M J; Beckmann, Roland",Science (Wash.),420,1

We rely on a comprehensive panel dataset of 1,824 small agricultural households collected over two survey rounds, on November-December 2019 and May-June 2020. We place special emphasis on changes in agricultural and nonagricultural income sources, including remittances, and changes in dietary diversity, including consumption of animal source foods (ASF) and fruits and vegetables (F&V). We find that COVID-19 affected the incomes, food security, and dietary patterns of households, with a decrease in ASF diversity and an increase in F&V diversity, and an overall net decrease in dietary diversity across all food groups. Dietary diversity among women in reproductive age, however, remained unchanged, and increased among children under 2 years old. Interestingly, households with relatively higher incomes appear to have reduced their dietary diversity to a larger extent than lower income ones, as well as households located in communities with more severe access restrictions. The focus of the study in a region with a high prevalence of poverty and chronic malnutrition provides an important perspective into the consequences of the lockdown in complex rural contexts with vulnerable populations and contributes to inform eventual recovery measures.","Ceballos, F.; Hernandez, M.

This study analyzes mobility pattern changes in Seoul, South Korea that adopted adaptive approach toward mobility. Intervention analyses reveal that major mobility reduction did occur two weeks before the city's case peak. Such voluntary adjustments exhibit strong preference shift toward private mode from public transit. Large reductions occurred in non-essential and high-contact activities of shopping and dining, while work and Starbucks trips were less affected. The collective evaluation reveal that major changes in epidemiology, mobility and policy occurred simultaneously, with no lagging nor leading contributors. Our study demonstrates that collective understanding the mutual aspects among mobility, epidemiology and policy is essential. Incremental and flexible mobility restriction is not only possible but necessary, especially for a pandemic of extensive spatial and temporal scales.","Yoon, Yoonjin; Oh, Soohwan; Cho, Jungwoo; Shin, Yuyol; Kim, Seyun; Kim, Namwoo; Cho, Haechan",,420,2

There is therefore a tremendous need to address and better understand COVID-19's informational crisis and gauge public sentiment, so that appropriate messaging and policy decisions can be implemented. In this research article, we identify public sentiment associated with the pandemic using Coronavirus specific Tweets and R statistical software, along with its sentiment analysis packages. We demonstrate insights into the progress of fear-sentiment over time as COVID-19 approached peak levels in the United States, using descriptive textual analytics supported by necessary textual data visualizations. Furthermore, we provide a methodological overview of two essential machine learning (ML) classification methods, in the context of textual analytics, and compare their effectiveness in classifying Coronavirus Tweets of varying lengths. We observe a strong classification accuracy of 91% for short Tweets, with the Naive Bayes method. We also observe that the logistic regression classification method provides a reasonable accuracy of 74% with shorter Tweets, and both methods showed relatively weaker performance for longer Tweets. This research provides insights into Coronavirus fear sentiment progression, and outlines associated methods, implications, limitations and opportunities.","Samuel, Jim; Ali, G. G. Md.

Good hygiene practices were considered an effective prevention method, but there were only minimal data on the effectiveness of hygiene practices against the pandemic at the community level. Thus, this study aims to assess hygiene practices in society by using a community-based survey. A cross-sectional study using survey monkey was conducted from December 2019 to February 2020. The Snowball sampling technique was used to recruit participants and exploratory factor analysis was applied to scrutinize the construct validity of the measurement. We used the Tobit regression model to assess the association. Hygiene in a high-risk environment and hygiene in the social and educational environment were two main factors after applying the EFA method. Participants grade community sanitation quite low (around 6 out of 10). Furthermore, the mean score of hygiene practice at a local level in a high-risk environment was slightly low at 6.0. The score of sanitation in the Central region (5.3) was quite low compared to the North (5.8) and the South (6.2). The most high-risk environment was construction, industrial zone and food safety. Moreover, younger respondents were more likely to report poorer hygiene practices in high-risk environments (Coefficient = -1.67; 95% CI = -3.03; -0.32) and social and educational environment (Coefficient = -1.29; 95% CI = -2.54; -0.04).

SARS-CoV-2 infection causes infection and interstitial pneumonia of varying severity in humans and COVID-19 models. Pulmonary as well as peripheral vascular lesions represent a severe, sometimes fatal, disease complication of unknown pathogenesis in COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), which are known to contribute to vessel inflammation or endothelial damage, have also been shown as potential driver of COVID-19 in humans. Though most studies in animal models describe the pulmonary lesions characterized by interstitial inflammation, type II pneumocyte hyperplasia, edema, fibrin formation and infiltration of macrophages and neutrophils, detailed pathological description of vascular lesions or NETs in COVID-19 animal models are lacking so far. Here we report different types of pulmonary vascular lesions in the golden Syrian hamster model of COVID-19. Vascular lesions included endothelialitis and vasculitis at 3 and 6 days post infection (dpi), and were almost nearly resolved at 14 dpi. Importantly, virus antigen was present in pulmonary lesions, but lacking in vascular alterations. In good correlation to these data, NETs were detected in the lungs of infected animals at 3 and 6 dpi. Hence, the Syrian hamster seems to represent a useful model to further investigate the role of vascular lesions and NETs in COVID-19 pathogenesis.","Becker, Kathrin; Beythien, Georg; de Buhr, Nicole; Stanelle-Bertram, Stephanie; Tuku, Berfin; Kouassi, Nancy Mounogou; Beck, Sebastian; Zickler, Martin; Allnoch, Lisa; Gabriel, Gülsah; von Köckritz-Blickwede, Maren; Baumgärtner, Wolfgang",Front Immunol,420,29

We aimed to clarify how soon SARS-CoV-2 transmission can occur after infection by asymptomatically infected individuals. METHODS: We analyzed the publicly available epidemiological information for a cluster of 108 cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases in Osaka, Japan. RESULTS: Among cases, 51 cases attended a live music club only once and were considered to have a single visit. Ten remained asymptomatic at the time of COVID-19 diagnosis by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction, which was on average 20 days after exposure. Three routes of secondary transmission were identified, with 2-4 days from infection to transmission. All index cases for secondary transmission were asymptomatic at the time of contact with other people. Based on the date of symptom onset in the remaining 41 cases, the period from exposure to illness ranged from 2 to 17 days. CONCLUSIONS: Seemingly healthy people could spread SARS-CoV-2 during intense activities in enclosed environments without sufficient ventilation. Asymptomatically infected persons can transmit the virus as soon as 2 days after infection.

For this reason, during the lockdown the health systems reduced all non-urgent endoscopic activities.On this second wave of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID 19) pandemic we cannot afford to suspend activities, as thehealth system is already overloaded. Our centre has continued regular endoscopic activity following a strict protocol toensure maximum safety for patients and for endoscopy staff. Methods Since October 2020 all patients requiring endoscopy examinations undergo a telephone triage two days before, which includes questions regarding body temperature, travel history, symptoms. In asymptomatic patients throat swabs forCOVID 19 nucleic acid polymerase chain reaction testing are collected the day before;for those with symptoms, endoscopyis postponed and they follow the protocols provided by our government as well as those who tested positive for the swab.During the endoscopy examination, endoscopy staff wear all personal protective equipment: surgical masks, face shields, disposable hats, shoe covers, gowns and gloves. Results In these two months, despite the exponential increase in infections, we ensured 20 endoscopies a day for 6 days aweek. 1040 patients have been subjected to our protocol: 12 were symptomatic, 5 were already aware of being Covid-19positive and they were in quarantine, 148 refused procedure for several reasons and 3 tested positive for the swab. To datewe have secured 83,8 % of our unit's full capacity and no endoscopy-related COVID-19 nosocomial infections have beenreported because of the strict execution of screening protocols. Conclusions Our experience shows that normal endoscopic activity can continue thanks to a strict screening procedures, ensuring the safety of patients and healthcare workers. It is also a way to screen all the population preventing the spread ofCOVID-19.","Panarese, A.; Licinio, R.; Palermo, S.; Marucci, C.; Lovero, R.; Abbruzzi, F.; Labarile, N.",Endoscopy,420,2

CPS are the backbone of enterprise, industrial, and critical infrastructure. Thus, their vital importance makes them prominent targets for malicious attacks aiming to disrupt their operations. Attacks targeting cyber-physical energy systems (CPES), given their mission-critical nature, can have disastrous consequences. The security of CPES can be enhanced leveraging testbed capabilities to replicate power system operations, discover vulnerabilities, develop security countermeasures, and evaluate grid operation under fault-induced or maliciously constructed scenarios. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive overview of the CPS security landscape with emphasis on CPES. Specifically, we demonstrate a threat modeling methodology to accurately represent the CPS elements, their interdependencies, as well as the possible attack entry points and system vulnerabilities. Leveraging the threat model formulation, we present a CPS framework designed to delineate the hardware, software, and modeling resources required to simulate the CPS and construct high-fidelity models which can be used to evaluate the system's performance under adverse scenarios. The system performance is assessed using scenario-specific metrics, while risk assessment enables system vulnerability prioritization factoring the impact on the system operation. The overarching framework for modeling, simulating, assessing, and mitigating attacks in a CPS is illustrated using four representative attack scenarios targeting CPES. The key objective of this paper is to demonstrate a step-by-step process that can be used to enact in-depth cybersecurity analyses, thus leading to more resilient and secure CPS.","Zografopoulos, Ioannis; Ospina, Juan; Liu, XiaoRui; Konstantinou, Charalambos",,420,16

But, what if it is an AI doctor and not human? Since AI systems are driven by personalization algorithms, it is possible to design AI doctors that can individuate patients with great precision. Is this appreciated or perceived as eerie and intrusive, thereby negatively affecting doctor-patient interaction? We decided to find out by designing a healthcare chatbot that identified itself as AI, Human, or Human assisted by AI. In a user study assessing Covid-19 risk, participants interacted twice, 10 days apart, with a bot that either individuated them or not. Data show that individuation by an AI doctor lowers patient compliance. Surprisingly, a majority of participants in the human doctor condition thought that they chatted with an AI doctor.

Factors associated with AKI in COVID-19 intensive care unit (ICU) patients and their outcomes have not been previously explored. METHODS: Prospective observational study of COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICUs of the Hospital Clínic of Barcelona (Spain), from March 25th to April 21st, 2020, who developed AKI stage 2 or higher (AKIN classification). The primary goal was to describe the characteristics of moderate-severe AKI of COVID-19 patients in an ICU context. As a secondary goal, we aimed to find independent predictors of AKI progression, Renal Replacement Therapy (RRT) requirement and mortality among these patients. RESULTS: During the study period, 52 out of 237 ICU patients, developed AKIN stage 2 or higher and were included in the study. A Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score at AKI diagnosis of 8 or higher was associated with RRT, OR 5.2, p 0.032. At the time of AKI diagnosis, patients had a worse liver profile and higher inflammation markers than at admission. Fifty per cent of the patients presented AKI progression from AKIN 2 to 3 and 28.85% required RRT. The use of corticosteroids in 69.2% of patients was associated with a reduced requirement of RRT, OR 0.13 (CI 95% 0.02-0.89), p 0.037. AKI was associated with high mortality (50%) and a longer hospital stay, median 35 vs 18 days (p 0.024).

The main aim of this review is to highlight findings of cortical spreading depolarization (CSD)-induced neuroinflammatory signaling in brain parenchyma from the inflammasome perspective. In addition, we discuss the limited data of the contribution of inflammasomes to other aspects of migraine pathophysiology, foremost the activation of the trigeminovascular system and thereby the generation of migraine pain. MAIN BODY: Inflammasomes are signaling multiprotein complexes and key components of the innate immune system. Their activation causes the production of inflammatory cytokines that can stimulate trigeminal neurons and are thus relevant to the generation of migraine pain. The contribution of inflammasome activation to pain signaling has attracted considerable attention in recent years. Nucleotide-binding domain (NOD)-like receptor family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) is the best characterized inflammasome and there is emerging evidence of its role in a variety of inflammatory pain conditions, including migraine. In this review, we discuss, from an inflammasome point of view, cortical spreading depolarization (CSD)-induced neuroinflammatory signaling in brain parenchyma, the connection with genetic factors that make the brain vulnerable to CSD, and the relation of the inflammasome with diseases that are co-morbid with migraine, including stroke, epilepsy, and the possible links with COVID-19 infection. CONCLUSION: Neuroinflammatory pathways, specifically those involving inflammasome proteins, seem promising candidates as treatment targets, and perhaps even biomarkers, in migraine.","Kursun, Oguzhan; Yemisci, Muge; van den Maagdenberg, Arn M J M; Karatas, Hulya",J Headache Pain,420,20

The aim of the study is to assess the arterial blood gas and acid-base patterns, blood pressure findings and their association with the outcomes of COVID-19 patients admitted to an intensive care unit. METHODS: A single-centre retrospective, observational study in a dedicated COVID-19 intensive care unit in Cape Town, South Africa. Admission arterial blood gas, serum electrolytes, renal function and blood pressure readings performed on COVID-19 patients admitted between 26 March and 2 June 2020 were analysed and compared between survivors and non-survivors. RESULTS: A total of 56 intensive care unit patients had admission arterial blood gas performed at the time of intensive care unit admission.

METHODS: We conducted a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, controlled trial to assess the safety and efficacy of the ChAdOxl nCoV-19 vaccine (AZD1222) in people not infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in South Africa. Participants 18 to less than 65 years of age were assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive two doses of vaccine containing 5x1O10 viral particles or placebo (0.9% sodium chloride solution) 21 to 35 days apart. Serum samples obtained from 25 participants after the second dose were tested by pseudovirus and live-virus neutralization assays against the original D6146 virus and the B.1.351 variant. The primary end points were safety and efficacy of the vaccine against laboratory-confirmed symptomatic coronavirus 2019 illness (Covid-19) more than 14 days after the second dose. RESULTS: Between June 24 and November 9,2020, we enrolled 2026 HIV-negative adults (median age, 30 years);1010 and 1011 participants received at least one dose of placebo or vaccine, respectively. Both the pseudovirus and the live-virus neutralization assays showed greater resistance to the B.1.351 variant in serum samples obtained from vaccine recipients than in samples from placebo recipients. In the primary end-point analysis, mild-to-moderate Covid49 developed in 23 of 717 placebo recipients (3.296) and in 19 of750 vaccine recipients (2.596), for an efficacy of 21.9% (95% confidence interval ICI], -49.9 to 59.8). Among the 42 participants with Covid49, 39 cases (95.1% of 41 with sequencing data) were caused by the B.1.351 variant;vaccine efficacy against this variant, analyzed as a secondary end point, was 10.4% (95% CI, 76.8 to 54.8).

Michigan Medicine, a primary regional center, provided an ideal setting for studying testing patterns during the first wave of the pandemic. OBJECTIVES: To identify the characteristics of patients who underwent repeated testing for COVID-19 and determine if repeated testing was associated with downstream outcomes among positive cases. METHODS: Characteristics, test results, and health outcomes for patients presenting for a COVID-19 diagnostic test were collected. We examined whether patient characteristics differed with repeated testing and estimated a false negative rate for the test. We then studied repeated testing patterns in patients with severe COVID-19 related outcomes. RESULTS: Patient age, sex, body mass index, neighborhood poverty levels, pre-existing Type 2 diabetes, circulatory, kidney, and liver diseases, and cough, fever/chills, and pain symptoms 14 days prior to a first test were associated with repeated testing. Among patients with a positive result, age (OR: 1.17; 95% CI: (1.05, 1.34)) and pre-existing kidney diseases (OR: 2.26; 95% CI: (1.41, 3.68)) remained significant. Hospitalization (OR: 7.88; 95% CI: (5.15, 12.26)) and ICU-level care (OR: 6.93; 95% CI: (4.44, 10.92)) were associated with repeated testing. The estimated false negative rate was 23.8% (95% CI: (19.5%, 28.5%)). CONCLUSIONS: While most patients were tested once and received a negative result, a meaningful subset underwent multiple rounds of testing. These results shed light on testing patterns and have important implications for understanding the variation of repeated testing results within and between patients.","Salerno, Stephen; Zhao, Zhangchen; Prabhu Sankar, Swaraaj; Salvatore, Maxwell; Gu, Tian; Fritsche, Lars G; Lee, Seunggeun; Lisabeth, Lynda D; Valley, Thomas S; Mukherjee, Bhramar",J. intern. med,420,1

It is therefore important to have a convenient way to quantify this impact, as such a measure of prior impact will help us to choose between two or more priors in a given situation. A recently proposed approach consists in determining the Wasserstein distance between posteriors resulting from two distinct priors, revealing how close or distant they are. In particular, if one prior is the uniform/flat prior, this distance leads to a genuine measure of prior impact for the other prior. While highly appealing and successful from a theoretical viewpoint, this proposal suffers from practical limitations: it requires prior distributions to be nested, posterior distributions should not be of a too complex form, in most considered settings the exact distance was not computed but sharp upper and lower bounds were proposed, and the proposal so far is restricted to scalar parameter settings. In this paper, we overcome all these limitations by introducing a practical version of this theoretical approach, namely the Wasserstein Impact Measure (WIM). In three simulated scenarios, we will compare the WIM to the theoretical Wasserstein approach, as well as to two competitor prior impact measures from the literature. We finally illustrate the versatility of the WIM by applying it on two datasets.","Ghaderinezhad, Fatemeh; Ley, Christophe; Serrien, Ben",,420,23

This study explored the dynamic CT manifestations of COVID-19 at different times and the value of some laboratory indicators for clinical guidance. MATERIAL AND METHODS This retrospective review included 44 patients who were infected with COVID-19. The dynamic chest CT and laboratory findings were obtained from electronic medical records. The intervals between onset and CT scans and the dynamic changes of the lesions were recorded. The above data were reviewed, sorted, and analyzed by using SPSS 21.0 software. RESULTS From the time of onset, the dynamic image of the lungs became more complete. Fibrous cord shadow absorption in the lungs were observed. Experimental indicators, biochemical indicators of lymphocytes, and protein series were decreased to varying degrees, while erythrocyte sedimentation, fibrinogen, and D-dimer were increased to varying degrees.

There are 3185 hand-washing episodes in total, each of which is annotated by up to seven different persons. The annotations classify the washing movements according to the WHO guidelines by marking each frame in each video with a certain movement code. The intention of this “in-the-wild” dataset is two-fold: to serve as a basis for training machine-learning classifiers for automated hand-washing movement recognition and quality control, and to allow to investigation of the real-world quality of washing performed by working medical staff.

However, there have been instances when the infected person forgets his/her contact-persons and does not have their contact details. Therefore, this study aimed at analyzing possible opportunities and challenges of integrating emerging technologies into COVID-19 contact tracing. METHODS: The study applied literature search from Google Scholar, Science Direct, PubMed, Web of Science, IEEE and WHO COVID-19 reports and guidelines analyzed. RESULTS: While the integration of technology-based contact tracing applications to combat COVID-19 and break transmission chains promise to yield better results, these technologies face challenges such as technical limitations, dealing with asymptomatic individuals, lack of supporting ICT infrastructure and electronic health policy, socio-economic inequalities, deactivation of mobile devices' WIFI, GPS services, interoperability and standardization issues, security risks, privacy issues, political and structural responses, ethical and legal risks, consent and voluntariness, abuse of contact tracing apps, and discrimination. CONCLUSION: Integrating emerging technologies into COVID-19 contact tracing is seen as a viable option that policymakers, health practitioners and IT technocrats need to seriously consider in mitigating the spread of coronavirus. Further research is also required on how best to improve efficiency and effectiveness in the utilisation of emerging technologies in contact tracing while observing the security and privacy of people in fighting the COVID-19 pandemic.","Mbunge, Elliot",Diabetes Metab Syndr,420,20

Methods: Prevalence of COVID/flu was determined from a nationally representative e-survey of a random adult sample. Additionally, demography, comorbidity, concomitant medications, and health-resource utilization (HRU) were evaluated. Undiagnosed (i.e., symptomatic/no diagnostic testing) or misdiagnosed (i.e., symptomatic/testing negative) COVID/flu was identified from responses to COVID-specific 8-symptom checklist (CSC) derived from a 25-symptom questionnaire. Based on testing or CSC status, respondents were grouped into “neither”, “dual diagnosis”, “COVID-only” and “flu-only” cohorts. Diagnosed COVID or flu was estimated from the positive tests. Overall COVID or flu rates were estimated as a sum of diagnosed, undiagnosed, or misdiagnosed for each. Results: Of the 1,123 respondents (mean age=39.1 years), 21.5% (242/1123) reported COVID/flu symptoms. Amongst respondents who underwent testing (143/1123), 22.4% (32/143) tested positive for COVID and flu (dual-diagnosis) concurrently, 7.0% (10/143) for COVID-only and 30.8% (44/143) for flu-only. Overall, 40.9% respondents had undiagnosed COVID/flu (99/242);8.7% (21/242) and 32.2% (78/242) had undiagnosed COVID-only and flu-only, respectively. Of 39.8% misdiagnosed respondents (57/143), 23.0% (33/143) and 16.8% (24/143) had misdiagnosed COVID-only and flu-only, respectively. Overall, COVID and flu rates were 8.5% (96/1123) and 15.9% (178/1123), respectively. Seventy-five percent diagnosed with COVID (32/42) were also flu-positive (dual-diagnosis). Sensitivity of CSC was 97.6% (41/42 that tested COVID-positive would identify as COVID with only CSC). Compared to neither cohort (n=881), the dual-diagnosis cohort (n=32) had significantly higher comorbidities and concomitant medications followed by COVID-only (n=64) and flu-only (n=146) cohorts. Dual-diagnosis cohort had higher HRU;with greater hospital-stays, ICU-stays, and ventilator-use, as well as longer hospital and ICU length-of-stays. Conclusions: These study findings demonstrate that the prevalence of COVID was half the rates of flu and 75% COVID-positive respondents were also flu-positive (dual-diagnosis). Dual-diagnosis cohort had highest HRU and comorbidity rates.","Rajagopalan, K.; Mahadik, B.",Value in Health,420,1

Data suggests a high incidence of pulmonary embolism (PE) in ventilated patients with COVID-19. OBJECTIVES: To determine the incidence of PE in hospitalised patients with COVID-19 and the diagnostic yield of Computer Tomography Pulmonary Angiography (CTPA) for PE. We also examined the utility of D-dimer and conventional pre-test probability for diagnosis of PE in COVID-19. PATIENTS/METHODS: Retrospective review of single-centre data of all CTPA studies in patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 identified from Electronic Patient Records (EPR). RESULTS: There were 1477 patients admitted with COVID-19 and 214 CTPA scans performed, of which n = 180 (84%) were requested outside of critical care. The diagnostic yield for PE was 37%. The overall proportion of PE in patients with COVID-19 was 5.4%. The proportions with Wells score of &#8805;4 ('PE likely') was 33/134 (25%) without PE vs 20/80 (25%) with PE (P = 0.951). The median National Early Warning-2 (NEWS2) score (illness severity) was 5 (interquartile range [IQR] 3-9) in PE group vs 4 (IQR 2-7) in those without PE (P = 0.133). D-dimer was higher in PE (median 8000 ng/mL; IQR 4665-8000 ng/mL) than non-PE (2060 ng/mL, IQR 1210-4410 ng/mL, P < 0.001). In the 'low probability' group, D-dimer was higher (P < 0.001) in those with PE but had a limited role in excluding PE. CONCLUSIONS: Even outside of the critical care environment, PE in hospitalised patients with COVID-19 is common. Of note, approaching half of PE events were diagnosed on hospital admission. More data are needed to identify an optimal diagnostic pathway in patients with COVID-19. Randomised controlled trials of intensified thromboprophylaxis are urgently needed.","Whyte, Martin B; Kelly, Philip A; Gonzalez, Elisa; Arya, Roopen; Roberts, Lara N",Thromb Res,420,30

As with other RNA viruses, mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 gene have been continuously evolving. Recently, four variants have been identified, B.1.1.7, B.1.351, P.1 and CAL.20C. These variants appear to be more infectious and transmissible than the original Wuhan-Hu-1 virus. Using a combination of bioinformatics and structural analyses, we show that the new SARS-CoV-2 variants emerged in the background of an already known Spike protein mutation D614G together with another mutation P323L in the RNA polymerase of SARS-CoV-2. The phylogenetic analysis showed that the CAL.20C and B.1.351 shared one common ancestor, whereas the B.1.1.7 and P.1 shared a different ancestor. Structural comparisons did not show any significant difference between the wild-type and mutant ACE2/Spike complexes. Structural analysis indicated that the N501Y mutation may increase hydrophobic interactions at the ACE2/Spike interface. However, reported greater binding affinity of N501Y Spike with ACE2 does not seem to be entirely due to increased hydrophobic interactions, given that Spike mutation R417T in P.1 or K417N in B.1.351 results in the loss of a salt-bridge interaction between ACE2 and S-RBD. The calculated change in free energy did not provide a clear trend of S protein stability of mutations in the variants. As expected, we show that the CAL.20C generally migrated from the west coast to the east coast of the USA. Taken together, the analyses suggest that the evolution of variants and their infectivity is complex and may depend upon many factors.","Spratt, Austin N; Kannan, Saathvik R; Woods, Lucas T; Weisman, Gary A; Quinn, Thomas P; Lorson, Christian L; Sönnerborg, Anders; Byrareddy, Siddappa N; Singh, Kamal",,420,29

The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has been causing disorders, dysfunction and morphophysiological alterations in multiple organs as the disease evolves. There is a great scientific community effort to obtain a therapy capable of reaching the multiple affected organs in order to contribute for tissue repair and regeneration. In this regard, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have emerged as potential candidates concerning the promotion of beneficial actions at different stages of COVID-19. MSCs are promising due to the observed therapeutic effects in respiratory preclinical models, as well as in cardiac, vascular, renal and nervous system models. Their immunomodulatory properties and secretion of paracrine mediators, such as cytokines, chemokines, growth factors and extracellular vesicles allow for long range tissue modulation and, particularly, blood-brain barrier crossing. This review focuses on SARS-CoV-2 impact to lungs, kidneys, heart, vasculature and central nervous system while discussing promising MSC's therapeutic mechanisms in each tissue. In addition, MSC's therapeutic effects in high-risk groups for COVID-19, such as obese, diabetic and hypertensive patients are also explored.","Paris, Gustavo C; Azevedo, Aline A; Ferreira, Adriana L; Azevedo, Yanca M A; Rainho, Mateus A; Oliveira, Genilza P; Silva, Karina R; Cortez, Erika A C; Stumbo, Ana C; Carvalho, Simone N; de Carvalho, Lais; Thole, Alessandra A",Life Sci,420,33

Little is known about lung cancer online support communities. This research was guided by two primary questions: (1) How do these lung cancer survivors engage in online support communities? and (2) What are the psychological, social, and physical impacts of such engagement? METHODS: Qualitative in-depth interviews were conducted with patients with advanced lung cancer (N = 40) to learn about their experiences with the illness. We used qualitative thematic analysis, inductive and deductive, as outlined by Carspecken. We adapted the framework for studying online communities developed by Zhang and colleagues to examine engagement with and impacts of involvement in online lung cancer support communities. RESULTS: Participants described engaging in the online community through (1) initializing communication through asking questions or sharing resources, (2) responding to others comments or inquiries, or (3) simply observing/reading others posts. Participation had physical, psychological, or social impacts, with benefits (e.g., empowerment) and risks (e.g., feelings of jealousy or misinformation) in each domain. Participants used various strategies to mitigate negative impacts, such as distancing oneself as needed. CONCLUSIONS: Online lung cancer support communities provide support, camaraderie, and specialized health information. However, there are also risks of online engagement, such as social comparison or accessing misinformation. Understanding the utility of online support communities for lung cancer survivors on targeted therapies and further addressing their risks are urgent tasks, especially in the post-COVID era.","Walsh, Casey A; Al Achkar, Morhaf",Support. care cancer,420,26

Our previous work with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like viruses argued that bats already harbor CoVs with the ability to infect humans without adaptation. These results suggested that additional barriers limit the emergence of zoonotic CoV. In this work, we describe overcoming host restriction of two Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-like bat CoVs using exogenous protease treatment. We found that the spike protein of PDF2180-CoV, a MERS-like virus found in a Ugandan bat, could mediate infection of Vero and human cells in the presence of exogenous trypsin. We subsequently show that the bat virus spike can mediate the infection of human gut cells but is unable to infect human lung cells. Using receptor-blocking antibodies, we show that infection with the PDF2180 spike does not require MERS-CoV receptor DPP4 and antibodies developed against the MERS spike receptor-binding domain and S2 portion are ineffective in neutralizing the PDF2180 chimera. Finally, we found that the addition of exogenous trypsin also rescues HKU5-CoV, a second bat group 2c CoV. Together, these results indicate that proteolytic cleavage of the spike, not receptor binding, is the primary infection barrier for these two group 2c CoVs. Coupled with receptor binding, proteolytic activation offers a new parameter to evaluate the emergence potential of bat CoVs and offers a means to recover previously unrecoverable zoonotic CoV strains. IMPORTANCE Overall, our studies demonstrate that proteolytic cleavage is the primary barrier to infection for a subset of zoonotic coronaviruses. Moving forward, the results argue that both receptor binding and proteolytic cleavage of the spike are critical factors that must be considered for evaluating the emergence potential and risk posed by zoonotic coronaviruses. In addition, the findings also offer a novel means to recover previously uncultivable zoonotic coronavirus strains and argue that other tissues, including the digestive tract, could be a site for future coronavirus emergence events in humans.","Menachery, Vineet D.; Dinnon, Kenneth H.; Yount, Boyd L.; McAnarney, Eileen T.; Gralinski, Lisa E.; Hale, Andrew; Graham, Rachel L.; Scobey, Trevor; Anthony, Simon J.; Wang, Lingshu; Graham, Barney; Randell, Scott H.; Lipkin, W.

This study evaluated mental health during COVID-19 lockdown in Austria and the effect of age, gender, income, work, and physical activity. METHODS: An online survey was performed through Qualtrics® after four weeks of lockdown in Austria to recruit a representative sample regarding gender, age, education, and region. Indicators of mental health were quality of life (WHO-QOL BREF), well-being (WHO-5), depression (PHQ-9), anxiety (GAD-7), stress (PSS-10), and sleep quality (ISI). RESULTS: In total, N = 1005 individuals were included (53% women). 21% scored above the cut off &#8805;10 points (PHQ-9) for moderate depressive symptoms, 119% scored above the cut-off &#8805;10 points (GAD-7) for moderate anxiety symptoms, and 16% above the cut-off &#8805;15 points (ISI) for clinical insomnia.

METHODS: Using de-identified claims data for children <18 years old from OptumLabs® Data Warehouse, a large commercial claims database, we compared monthly primary care visit and vaccination rates from January-October 2020 to January-October 2018 and 2019. Visit rates were analyzed by visit reason and by the month after (e.g., month +1) the COVID-19 public health emergency declaration using a series of child-level Poisson regression models. RESULTS: There were 3.4, 3.4, and 3.1 million children in 2018, 2019, and 2020 cohorts, respectively. Compared to the same months in prior years, primary care visits in 2020 were 60% lower in month +1 (IRR 0.40, 99% CI 0.40-0.40) and 17% lower in month +7 (IRR 0.83, 99% CI 0.83-0.83). Preventive visit rates were 53% lower in month +1 (IRR 0.47, 99% CI 0.47-0.47), but 8% higher than prior years in month +7 (IRR 1.08, 99% CI 1.08-1.08). Monthly rates of vaccine administration followed a similar pattern.

METHODS: A multicenter, retrospective quasi-experimental study was conducted to evaluate provider response to CDS alerts triggered during ordering of QT-prolonging medications for adult patients. The primary outcome was the proportion of orders triggering QTc alerts that were continued without intervention during a specified preimplementation phase (n = 49) and during a postimplementation phase (n = 100). Patient risk factors for QTc prolongation, provider alert response, and interventions to reduce the risk of QTc-associated adverse events were evaluated. RESULTS: The rate of order continuation without intervention was 82% in the preimplementation phase and 37% in the postimplementation phase, representing an 55% reduction in continued verified orders following implementation of the QT-focused CDS tool. Most alerts were initially responded to by the prescriber, with pharmacist intervention needed in only 33% of cases. There were no significant differences in patient QTc-related risk factors between the 2 study groups (P = 0.11); the postimplementation group had a higher proportion of patients using at least 2 QTc-prolonging medications (48%, compared to 26% in the preimplementation group; P = 0.02). CONCLUSION: Implementation of the CDS tool was associated with a reduction in the proportion of orders continued without intervention in patients at high risk for QTc-related adverse events.","Chernoby, Katie; Lucey, Michael F; Hartner, Carrie L; Dehoorne, Michelle; Edwin, Stephanie B",Am. j. health system pharm,420,16

SARS-CoV2 infection depends on the host cell Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme-2 (ACE2) and Transmembrane Serine Protease-2 (TMPRSS2), where the virus uses ACE2 for entry and TMPRSS2 for S protein priming. The TMPRSS2 gene encodes a Transmembrane Protease Serine-2 protein (TMPS2) that belongs to the serine protease family. There is no crystal structure available for TMPS2, therefore, a homology model was required to establish a putative 3D structure for the enzyme. A homology model was constructed using SWISS-MODEL and evaluations were performed through Ramachandran plots, Verify 3D and Protein Statistical Analysis (ProSA). Molecular dynamics simulations were employed to investigate the stability of the constructed model. Docking of TMPS2 inhibitors, camostat, nafamostat, gabexate, and sivelestat, using Molecular Operating Environment (MOE) software, into the constructed model was performed and the protein-ligand complexes were subjected to MD simulations and computational binding affinity calculations. These in silico studies determined the tertiary structure of TMPS2 amino acid sequence and predicted how ligands bind to the model, which is important for drug development for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19.","Kishk, Safaa M; Kishk, Rania M; Yassen, Asmaa S A; Nafie, Mohamed S; Nemr, Nader A; ElMasry, Gamal; Al-Rejaie, Salim; Simons, Claire",Molecules (Basel),420,1

Prior works have been proposed to enable practical privacy-preserving applications with architectural-aware optimizations on CPUs, GPUs and FPGAs. However, there is no systematic optimization for the whole HE pipeline on Intel GPUs. In this paper, we present the first-ever SYCL-based GPU backend for Microsoft SEAL APIs. We perform optimizations from instruction level, algorithmic level and application level to accelerate our HE library based on the Cheon, Kim, Kimand Song (CKKS) scheme on Intel GPUs. The performance is validated on two latest Intel GPUs. Experimental results show that our staged optimizations together with optimizations including low-level optimizations and kernel fusion accelerate the Number Theoretic Transform (NTT), a key algorithm for HE, by up to 9.93X compared with the na\""ive GPU baseline. The roofline analysis confirms that our optimized NTT reaches 79.8% and85.7% of the peak performance on two GPU devices. Through the highly optimized NTT and the assembly-level optimization, we obtain 2.32X - 3.05X acceleration for HE evaluation routines. In addition, our all-together systematic optimizations improve the performance of encrypted element-wise polynomial matrix multiplication application by up to 3.10X.","Zhai, Yujia; Ibrahim, Mohannad; Qiu, Yiqin; Boemer, Fabian; Chen, Zizhong; Titov, Alexey; Lyashevsky, Alexander",,420,1

In this work, we estimated the current SARS-CoV-2 infection rate in blood donors from Belo Horizonte, Brazil. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Saliva and blood samples were collected from 4103 blood donors from June 15 to September 30, 2020. Saliva samples were tested by real-time RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 in mini-pools of four samples. Individual samples were tested for positive or inconclusive pools, and positive donors had their plasma tested. RESULTS: Twenty-seven (0.66%) blood donors were positive for SARS-CoV-2 in their saliva, but their plasma was negative, except for one, who presented a high viral load in saliva and nasopharyngeal samples and RNAemia in the plasma close to the limit of detection. Fourteen (56%) positive blood donors reported mild symptoms related to COVID-19 after donation, but the viral load levels were not statistically different between symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals. DISCUSSION: Despite the measures taken by Blood Centers to avoid blood donors with SARS-CoV-2 infection, asymptomatic or presymptomatic carriers are able to donate. The risk of the virus transmission by transfusion seems to be negligible since plasma RNAemia was seen at a very low level in only one (3.7%) of the positive donors, but other studies must be performed to confirm this finding.","Chaves, Daniel Gonçalves; da Silva Malta, Maria Clara Fernandes; de Souza Madeira Ferreira Boy, Luciana; Miranda Barbosa, Aretuza; Fonseca, Cinthia Neves; Ellen de Lima Torres, Dayanne; Patterson Nogueira, Janaína; Medeiros Moreira, Hélinse; Cristine Martineli Loureiro, Flávia; Vargas de Freitas Silva, Jaciane; Aparecida Ribeiro, Maísa; Guimarães Mourão Cioffi, Júnia; Lobato Martins, Marina",Transfusion,420,13

We show how the perfluorinated chains grafting of PDMS provides a reliable approach to increase the hydrophobicity and surface charges at the same time that keeping the PDMS mechanical properties. In this way, we produce efficient Ag/ZnO convoluted piezoelectric nanogenerators supported on flexible substrates and embedded in PDMS compatible with a contact separation triboelectric architecture. Factors like crystal-line texture, ZnO thickness, nanowires aspect ratio, and surface chemical modification of the PDMS are explored to optimize the power output of the nanogenerators aimed for harvesting from low-frequency vibrations. Just by manual trigger-ing, the hybrid device can charge a microcapacitor to switch on an array of color LEDs. Outstandingly, this simple three-layer architecture allows for harvesting vibration energy in a wide bandwidth, thus, we show the performance characteristics for frequencies between 1 Hz to 50 Hz and demonstrate the successful activation of the system up to ca. 800 Hz","Garc'ia-Casas, Xabier; Ghaffarinehad, Ali; Aparicio, Francisco J.; Castillo-Seoane, Javier; L'opez-Santos, Carmen; Espin'os, Juan P.; Cotrino, Jos'e; S'anchez-Valencia, Juan Ram'on; Barranco, 'Angel; Borr'as, Ana",,420,29

The detection and diagnosis have been improved, as well. However, the daily reported cases remaining at a high level make the epidemic trend prediction difficult. METHODS: Since the traditional SEIR model does not evaluate the effectiveness of control strategies, a novel model in line with the current epidemic's process and control measures was proposed, utilizing multisource datasets including the cumulative number of reported, deceased, quarantined and suspected cases. RESULTS: Results show that the trend of the epidemic mainly depends on quarantined and suspected cases. The predicted cumulative numbers of quarantined and suspected cases nearly reached static states, and their inflection points have already been achieved, with the epidemic's peak coming soon. The estimated effective reproduction numbers using model-free and model-based methods are decreasing, as well as new infections, while newly reported cases are increasing. Most infected cases have been quarantined or put in the suspected class, which has been ignored in existing models. CONCLUSIONS: The uncertainty analyses reveal that the epidemic is still uncertain, and it is important to continue enhancing the quarantine and isolation strategy and improving the detection rate in mainland China.","Tang, Biao; Xia, Fan; Tang, Sanyi; Bragazzi, Nicola Luigi; Li, Qian; Sun, Xiaodan; Liang, Juhua; Xiao, Yanni; Wu, Jianhong",Int J Infect Dis,420,16

We describe the epidemiological and laboratory data from one of the first such outbreaks in Ontario to assess factors associated with its severity, and the impact of progressive interventions for infection control over the course of the outbreak. METHODS: We obtained line list and outbreak data from the public health unit to describe resident and staff cases, severity and distribution of cases over time and within the outbreak facility. Where available, we obtained data on laboratory specimens from the Public Health Ontario Laboratory and performed whole genome sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of viral specimens from the outbreak. RESULTS: Among 65 residents of the long-term care home, 61 (94%) contracted SARS-CoV-2, with a case fatality rate of 45% (28/61). Among 67 initial staff, 34 (51%) contracted the virus and none died. When the outbreak was declared, 12 staff, 2 visitors and 9 residents had symptoms. Resident cases were located in 3 of 4 areas of the home. Phylogenetic analysis showed tight clustering of cases, with only 1 additional strain of genetically distinct SARS-CoV-2 identified from a staff case in the third week of the outbreak. No cases were identified among 26 new staff brought into the home after full outbreak measures were implemented. INTERPRETATION: Rapid and undetected viral spread in a long-term care home led to high rates of infection among residents and staff.

The CNHN was prepared via a convenient calcining routine using the bimetallic CuNi-MOFs as a coprecursor. The unique chemical structure of hollow CNHN with high specific surface area and abundant terminal amino groups effectively avoid the aggregation of AuNPs and facilitate the subsequent adsorption of nitrite. The Au/CNHN exhibited high electrocatalytic activity towards nitrite oxidation due to the synergetic catalytic effect of AuNPs and CNHN. Chronoamperometric detection of nitrite at the Au/CNHN/GCE achieved a lower linear calibration range of 0.05 to 1.15 mM, with an LOD of 0.017 µM compared with previous reports. The proposed method obtained satisfactory recoveries for nitrite determination in practical applications, which was verified by UV-Vis spectrophotometry. The prepared sensor based on Au/CNHN featured favorable selectivity and stability, which provides a promising approach for real sample analysis.

A test-and-isolate strategy, using PCR diagnostic tests, could help to minimise the impact of this second wave. Meanwhile, population-level serological surveillance can provide valuable insights into the level of immunity in the population. Using a mathematical model, consistent with an Indian megacity, we examined how seroprevalence data could guide a test-and-isolate strategy, for fully lifting restrictions. For example, if seroprevalence is 20% of the population, we show that a testing strategy needs to identify symptomatic cases within 5-8 days of symptom onset, in order to prevent a resurgent wave from overwhelming hospital capacity in the city. This estimate is robust to uncertainty in the effectiveness of the lockdown, as well as in immune protection against reinfection. To set these results in their economic context, we estimate that the weekly cost of such a PCR-based testing programme would be less than 2.1% of the weekly economic loss due to the lockdown. Our results illustrate how PCR-based testing and serological surveillance can be combined to design evidence-based policies, for lifting lockdowns in Indian cities and elsewhere.","Mandal, Sandip; Das, Hemanshu; Deo, Sarang; Arinaminpathy, Nimalan",Sci Rep,420,1

Hispanics/Latinos and African-Americans share a higher prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors and experience higher rates of poverty and social stressors than non-Hispanic Whites. We propose that the use of social and behavioral data beyond basic and sometimes loose identifiers of race/ethnicity, educational attainment, and occupation would inform clinical practice and greatly facilitate the provision of adequate guidance and support to patients regarding continuity of care, adherence to medications and treatment plans, and engagement of participants in future research.

As the British public was ordered to stay at home, non-essential businesses shut their doors, resulting in an abrupt shift in working practices towards home working. In higher education, university campuses closed to students and staff. In this article, two disabled lecturers working in higher education in the UK reflect on their experiences during this rapid shift in working practices. With a particular focus on how their different impairments intersected with the changes occurring during this time, they employ autoethnography as an emancipatory method to consider the ways in which their working lives were impacted by the decisions made during this period. As well as illuminating their own individual experiences, they use these accounts to consider the wider implications for disabled students and academics. They conclude that, whilst this has been a period of challenge, uncertainty and rapid change, there are also lessons to be learnt regarding accessibility and the possibility for adaptation going forward, for staff and students alike. They suggest that as we emerge from this period of crisis, we need to use these experiences as leverage for positive change; for designing ways of teaching and learning that accommodate everyone, rather than getting swept up in an unthinking pursuit of returning to 'business as usual'.","Hannam-Swain, Stephanie; Bailey, Chris",Soc Sci Humanit Open,420,16

Even in high income countries, health systems have been found wanting in dealing with the new infectious agent. However, the even greater long-term danger of antimicrobial resistance in pathogenic bacteria and fungi is still under-appreciated, especially among the general public. Although antimicrobial drug development faces significant scientific challenges, the gravest challenge at the moment appears to be economic, where the lack of a viable market has led to a collapse in drug development pipelines. There is therefore a critical need for governments across the world to further incentivize the development of antimicrobials. Most incentive strategies over the past decade have focused on so-called ""push"" incentives that bridge the costs of antimicrobial research and development, but these have been insufficient for reviving the pipeline. In this Perspective, we analyze the current incentive strategies in place for antimicrobial drug development, and focus on ""pull"" incentives, which instead aim to improve revenue generation and thereby resolve the antimicrobial market failure challenge. We further analyze these incentives in a broader ""One Health"" context and stress the importance of developing and enforcing strict protocols to ensure appropriate manufacturing practices and responsible use. Our analysis reiterates the importance of international cooperation, coordination across antimicrobial research, and sustained funding in tackling this significant global challenge. A failure to invest wisely and continuously to incentivize antimicrobial pipelines will have catastrophic consequences for global health and wellbeing in the years to come.","Cama, J; Leszczynski, R; Tang, P K; Khalid, A; Lok, V; Dowson, C G; Ebata, A",ACS infect. dis,420,16

OBJECTIVES: (1) Construct individual communication profiles in educational and developmental aspects. (2) Examine for associations between variables. (3) Demonstrate the clinical and educational utility of including cognitive-linguistic integrative variables. (4) Showcase how the profiles guide interventions tailored to students' individual needs. METHODS: Functional communication profiles (FCPs) of 21 students, aged 5.0-16.8 years, mostly from bilingual middle-high socioeconomic status families, were constructed with input from their educational and therapeutic staff. Students' performance was examined with an array of instruments and tasks, including person and clock drawings, false belief, and bouba-kiki metaphor screens. Qualitative and quantitative analyses were performed to uncover associations, weaknesses, and strengths. RESULTS: The profiles revealed associations between cognitive, linguistic, social, and educational abilities, indicating that some abilities from different domains tend to co-occur.

STUDY DESIGN: This is a nationwide retrospective cohort study that was conducted in Mexico. METHODS: Data from 258 reinfection cases (at least 28 days between both episodes onset) were analyzed. We used risk ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to evaluate predictors of severe (dyspnea requiring hospital admission) secondary SARS-CoV-2 infection. RESULTS: The risk of severe disease was 14.7%, and the observed overall fatality rate was 4.3%. Patients with more serious primary disease were more likely to develop severe symptoms (39.5% vs. 5.5%, P < 0.001) during reinfection. In multiple analysis, factors associated with an increased risk of severe symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 reinfection were increasing age (RRper year = 1.007, 95% CI = 1.003-1.010), comorbidities (namely, obesity [RR = 1.12, 95% CI = 1.01-1.24], asthma [RR = 1.26, 95% CI = 1.06-1.50], type 2 diabetes mellitus [RR = 1.22, 95% CI = 1.07-1.38]), and previous severe laboratory-confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 (RR = 1.20, 95% CI = 1.03-1.39).

Unfortunately, currently, there is no specific and effective treatment for COVID-19. As SARS-CoV-2 relies on its spike proteins (S) to bind to a host cell-surface receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme-2(ACE2), and this interaction is proved to be responsible for entering a virus into host cells, it makes an ideal target for antiviral drug development. In this work, we design three very short peptides based on the ACE2 sequence/structure fragments, which may effectively bind to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of S protein and may, in turn, disrupt the important virus-host protein-protein interactions, blocking early steps of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Two of our peptides bind to virus protein with affinity in nanomolar range, and as very short peptides have great potential for drug development.","Odolczyk, N.; Marzec, E.; Winiewska-Szajewska, M.; Poznanski, J.; Zielenkiewicz, P.",Molecules,420,16

Ideal forecasts of a future event behave as martingales, sequen- tially updating the forecast to leverage the available information as the future event approaches. The threshold martingale introduced here measures the proportion of the forecast distribution lying below a threshold. In addition to being calibrated, a threshold martingale has quadratic variation that accumulates to a total determined by a quantile of the initial forecast distribution. Deviations from calibration or to- tal volatility signal problems in the underlying model. Calibration adjustments are well-known, and we augment these by introducing a martingale filter that improves volatility while guaranteeing smaller mean squared error. Thus, post-processing can rectify problems with calibration and volatility without revisiting the original forecast- ing model. We apply threshold martingales first to forecasts from simulated models and then to models that predict the winner in professional basketball games.","Foster, Dean P.; Stine, Robert A.",,420,1

It starts with the premise that the precursors of catastrophes of this magnitude provide a valid basis for planning corrective measures, improved preparedness, and ultimately serious health reform. Such reform should include standardized protocols for proper deployment of telemedicine to triage patients to the appropriate level and source of care at the point of need, proper use of relevant technological innovations to deliver precision medicine, and the development of regional networks to coordinate and improve access to care while streamlining the care process. The other essential element is a universal payment system that puts the United States at par with the rest of the industrialized countries, regardless of variation among them. The ultimate goal is creating an efficient, effective, accessible, and equitable system of care. Although timing is uncertain, the pandemic will be brought under control.

Lateral flow device (LFD) immunoassays were introduced in late 2020 to detect SARS-CoV-2 infection in asymptomatic or presymptomatic individuals rapidly. While LFD technologies have been used for over 60 years, their widespread use as a public health tool during a pandemic is unprecedented. By the end of 2020, data from studies into the efficacy of the LFDs emerged and showed these point-of-care devices to have very high specificity (ability to identify true negatives) but inadequate sensitivity with high false-negative rates. The low sensitivity (<50%) shown in several studies is a critical public health concern, as asymptomatic or presymptomatic carriers may wrongly be assumed to be noninfectious, posing a significant risk of further spread in the community. Here, we show that the direct visual readout of SARS-CoV-2 LFDs is an inadequate approach to discriminate a potentially infective viral concentration in a biosample. We quantified significant immobilized antigen-antibody-labeled conjugate complexes within the LFDs visually scored as negative using high-sensitivity synchrotron X-ray fluorescence imaging. Correlating quantitative X-ray fluorescence measurements and quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) determined numbers of viral copies, we identified that negatively scored samples could contain up to 100 PFU (equivalent here to â¼10â¯000 RNA copies/test). The study demonstrates where the shortcomings arise in many of the current direct-readout SARS-CoV-2 LFDs, namely, being a deficiency in the readout as opposed to the potential level of detection of the test, which is orders of magnitude higher. The present findings are of importance both to public health monitoring during the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and to the rapid refinement of these tools for immediate and future applications.","Koller, Garrit; Morrell, Alexander P; Galão, Rui Pedro; Pickering, Suzanne; MacMahon, Eithne; Johnson, Joanna; Ignatyev, Konstantin; Neil, Stuart J D; Elsharkawy, Sherif; Fleck, Roland; Machado, Pedro Miguel Pereira; Addison, Owen",ACS Appl Mater Interfaces,420,1

Every state in the United States enacted policies to encourage distancing and some mandated staying home. Understanding how these policies interact with individuals' voluntary responses to the COVID-19 epidemic is a critical initial step in understanding the role of these nonpharmaceutical interventions in transmission dynamics and assessing policy impacts. We use variation in policy responses along with smart device data that measures the amount of time Americans stayed home to disentangle the extent that observed shifts in staying home behavior are induced by policy. We find evidence that stay-at-home orders and voluntary response to locally reported COVID-19 cases and deaths led to behavioral change. For the median county, which implemented a stay-at-home order with about two cases, we find that the response to stay-at-home orders increased time at home as if the county had experienced 29 additional local cases. However, the relative effect of stay-at-home orders was much greater in select counties. On the one hand, the mandate can be viewed as displacing a voluntary response to this rise in cases. On the other hand, policy accelerated the response, which likely helped reduce spread in the early phase of the pandemic. It is important to be able to attribute the relative role of self-interested behavior or policy mandates to understand the limits and opportunities for relying on voluntary behavior as opposed to imposing stay-at-home orders.","Yan, Youpei; Malik, Amyn A; Bayham, Jude; Fenichel, Eli P; Couzens, Chandra; Omer, Saad B",Proc.

These viruses can infect humans repeatedly and cause acute respiratory disease with potential of spread in the form of epidemics. In addition, avian influenza viruses that overcome the interspecies barrier and adapt to humans can cause a world-wide pandemic with severe consequences to human health. Therefore, scientists are focused on the development of a ""universal"" vaccine with a broad protective efficacy, i.e. against different subtypes of influenza A viruses and not only against the currently co-circulating human epidemic strains. Nowadays, several new vaccine design strategies have been described. Most of them utilize the conserved stem part of influenza surface glycoprotein hemagglutinin (HA) or the ectodomain of M2 (M2e) protein with proton-channel activity. A comparison of the efficacy of novel vaccines and their protective mechanisms against influenza infection is discussed in this review and should be considered for the construction of the most effective broadly protective vaccine with minimal side effects.

In this context, an environmentally friendly and cost-effective method has been developed for the biomimetic synthesis of Ag nanospheres (Ag NSs) using aqueous extract of Piper nigrum for the detection of chlorite (ClO2-) and mercury (Hg2+) ions. The strong antioxidant properties of the biomolecules present in the Piper nigrum extract reduce silver ions (Ag+) to Ag0. After optimization of the formulation parameters, it was observed that 1 mL of piper nigrum extract was sufficient to reduce and stabilize 100 mL of 1.5 mM of Ag+ in 2.5 h at 30 °C. X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of Ag NSs revealed their crystalline nature and the characteristic Bragg's diffraction peaks confirmed their face cubic crystal (FCC) lattice. The characteristic reddish-brown color and absorption surface plasmon resonance (SPR) band at 435 nm confirmed the successful fabrication of Ag NSs. Kinetic analysis revealed a three-phase growth pattern involving nucleation, growth and stabilization. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) micrograms, showed spherical NSs with narrow polydispersity with particle size ranging from 10 to 30 nm. The synthesized NSs were exposed to various metal ions and anions. The absorption intensity of Ag NSs quenched in the presence of mercury ions (Hg2+) among the cations and Chlorite ions (ClO2-) among the anions. The limit of detection (LOD) of 7.47 µM and 1.11 µM was evaluated from the calibration curve for Hg2+ and ClO2-, respectively. Based on these promising results, it is suggested that the method reported is a low-cost and one step biogenic protocol for the synthesis of Ag NSs and their employment for the detection of Hg2+ and ClO2-ions.","Vashisht, Devika; Sangar, Sugandha; Kaur, Manpreet; Sharma, Ekta; Vashisht, Aseem; Ibhadon, A O; Sharma, Shweta; Mehta, S K; Singh, Kulvinder",Environ Res,420,30

We aim to describe the characteristics of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in this population and also its impact on pediatric cancer care in the New York region during the peak of the pandemic. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This multicenter, retrospective study included 13 institutions. Clinical and laboratory information on 98 patients &#8804;21 years of age receiving active anticancer therapy, who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by nasopharyngeal swab polymerase chain reaction (PCR), was collected. RESULTS: Of the 578 pediatric oncology patients tested for COVID-19, 98 were positive, of whom 73 were symptomatic. Most experienced mild disease, 28 required inpatient management, 25 needed oxygen support, and seven required mechanical ventilation. There is a slightly higher risk of severe disease in males and obese patients, though not statistically significant. Persistent lymphopenia was noted in severe cases. Delays in cancer therapy occurred in 67% of SARS-CoV-2-positive patients. Of four deaths, none were solely attributable to COVID-19. The impact of the pandemic on pediatric oncology care was significant, with 54% of institutions reporting delays in chemotherapy, 46% delays in surgery, and 30% delays in transplant.

The medical community is still getting to know behavior of this virus and the consequences from a population point of view. All this knowledge is extremely dynamic, so some behaviors are still not well established. Otorhinolaryngologists have a central role in the management of this situation, in which they must assess the patient, avoid contamination to and by health professionals and other patients. Thus, the recommendations of the Brazilian Association of Otorhinolaryngology and Cervical-Facial Surgery (ABORL-CCF) have the main objective of reducing the spread of the new coronavirus during otorhinolaryngological care and assisting in the management of these patients.

METHODS: A qualitative exploratory study was conducted using semi-structured dyadic interviews with 13 couples (N = 26) carrying a structural chromosomal abnormality. All couples had an informative consultation in our PGT centre in the Netherlands. RESULTS: Almost all couples considered PGT or natural conception combined with prenatal diagnosis (PND) as the only two reproductive options. Among several considerations mentioned, the majority indicated that the wish to increase the chance of a successful pregnancy was the most important motive to opt for PGT. All couples who opted for PGT had first tried to conceive spontaneously and entered the PGT programme because of their adverse experiences during these attempts (infertility, recurrent miscarriage, termination of pregnancy, birth of an affected child). Couples that refrained from PGT were of advanced maternal age and expressed the long trajectory of PGT as the main reason to refrain. If conceiving spontaneously would not lead to an ongoing pregnancy, these couples also indicated that they would use PGT. CONCLUSION: This study shows that couples carrying a structural chromosomal abnormality consider PGT and spontaneous conception with PND as relevant reproductive options. They are looking for the option that is in their opinion the fastest way to establish a successful pregnancy. Information on the perceived pros and cons of PGT or spontaneous conception in these couples can help to optimize counselling and psychological support during the decision-making process.","De Krom, G; Severijns, Y; Vlieg, W L; Arens, Y H J M; Van Golde, R J T; De Die-Smulders, C E M; Van Osch, L A D M",J. assist. reprod. genet,420,26

Exercise is pivotal to OA management, yet uptake by people with knee OA is inadequate. Limited access to appropriately skilled health professionals, such as physiotherapists, for prescription of an exercise program and support with exercise is a major barrier to optimal care. Internet-enabled video consultations permit widespread reach. However, services offering video consultations with physiotherapists for musculoskeletal conditions are scant in Australia where there is typically no Government or private health insurer funding for such services. The paucity of robust evidence demonstrating video consultations with physiotherapists are clinically effective, safe and cost-effective for knee OA is hampering implementation of, and willingness of healthcare policymakers to pay for, these services. METHODS: This is an assessor- and participant-blinded, two-arm, pragmatic, comparative effectiveness non-inferiority randomised controlled trial (RCT) conducted in Australia. We are recruiting 394 people from the community with chronic knee pain consistent with a clinical diagnosis of knee OA. Participants are randomly allocated to receive physiotherapy care via i) video-conferencing or; ii) face-to-face consultations. Participants are provided five consultations (30-45 min each) with a physiotherapist over 3 months for prescription of a home-based strengthening exercise program (to be conducted independently at home) and physical activity plan, as well as OA education. Participants in both groups are provided with educational booklets and simple exercise equipment via post. The co-primary outcomes are change in self-reported i) knee pain on walking; and ii) physical function, with a primary end-point of 3 months and a secondary end-point of 9 months. Secondary outcomes include changes in other clinical outcomes (health-related quality of life; therapeutic relationship; global ratings of change; satisfaction with care; self-efficacy; physical activity levels), time and financial costs of attending consultations, healthcare usage and convenience. Non-inferiority will be assessed using the per-protocol dataset. DISCUSSION: Findings will determine if video consultations with physiotherapists are non-inferior to traditional face-to-face consultations for management of people with knee OA.

METHODS: In this observational, longitudinal cohort study, all neurosurgical admissions that presented to our department between February 1 and April 15 during the COVID-19 pandemic and during the same time period in 2019 were identified and categorized according to the presence of a neuro-emergency, the route of admission, management, and the category of disease. Further, the clinical course of patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) and chronic subdural hematoma (cSDH) was investigated representatively for severe vascular and semi-urgent traumatic conditions that present with a wide variety of symptoms. RESULTS: During the pandemic, the percentage of neuro-emergencies among all neurosurgical admissions remained similar but a larger proportion presented through the emergency department than through the outpatient clinic or by referral (*p = 0.009). The total number of neuro-emergencies was significantly reduced (*p = 0.0007) across all types of disease, particularly in vascular (*p = 0.036) but also in spinal (*p = 0.007) and hydrocephalus (*p = 0.048) emergencies. Patients with spinal emergencies presented 48 h later (*p = 0.001) despite comparable symptom severity. For aSAH, the number of cases, aSAH grade, aneurysm localization, and treatment modality did not change but strikingly, elderly patients with cSDH presented less frequently, with more severe symptoms (*p = 0.046), and were less likely to reach favorable outcome (*p = 0.003) at discharge compared with previous years. CONCLUSIONS: Despite pandemic-related restrictive measures and reallocation of resources, patients with neuro-emergencies should be encouraged to present regardless of the severity of symptoms because deferred presentation may result in adverse outcome. Thus, conservation of critical healthcare resources remains essential in spite of fighting COVID-19.","Hecht, Nils; Wessels, Lars; Werft, Finn-Ove; Schneider, Ulf C; Czabanka, Marcus; Vajkoczy, Peter",Acta Neurochir (Wien),420,21

We hypothesize a new mechanism supporting the synergistic interaction between these drugs. Azithromycin is a substrate of ABCB1 (P-glycoprotein) which is localized in endosomes and lysosomes with a polarized substrate transport from the cell cytosol into the vesicle interior. SARS-CoV-2 and drugs meet in these acidic organelles and both basic drugs, which are potent lysosomotropic compounds, will become protonated and trapped within these vesicles. Consequently, their intra-vesicular concentrations can attain low micromolar effective cytotoxic concentrations on SARS-CoV-2 while concomitantly increase the intra-vesicular pH up to around neutrality. This last effect inhibits lysosomal enzyme activities responsible in virus entry and replication cycle. Based on these considerations, we hypothesize that ABCB1 could be a possible enhancer by confining azithromycin more extensively than expected when the trapping is solely dependent on the passive diffusion. This additional mechanism may therefore explain the synergistic effect when azithromycin is added to hydroxychloroquine, leading to apparently more rapid virus clearance and better clinical benefit, when compared to monotherapy with hydroxychloroquine alone.","Scherrmann, J M",AAPS J,420,2

Herein, we present a fit-for-purpose (FFP) validation of a dendritic cell (DC) activation assay designed to assess the immunogenicity liability of protein biotherapeutics. Characterization of key assay parameters was achieved using monocyte-derived DCs (MoDCs) treated with cell culture medium only (i.e., background control (BC)), keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) as system positive control (SPC), and 2 therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) with known clinical immunogenicity profiles (bococizumab and TAM163) as therapeutic controls (TCs). In the absence of established validation guidelines for primary cell-based assays, the present DC activation assay was validated using a novel FFP approach which allows more flexibility in selection of validation parameters and designing of experiments based on the intended use of the assay. The present FFP validation allowed us to understand the impact of experimental variables on assay precision, develop a clear concise readout for DC activation results, establish a reliable response threshold to define a result as a positive DC activation response, and define in-study donor acceptance criteria and cohort size. FFP validation of this DC activation assay indicated that the assay is sufficient to support its context of use, a preclinical immunogenicity risk management tool.","Wickramarachchi, Dilki; Steeno, Gregory; You, Zhiping; Shaik, Saleem; Lepsy, Christopher; Xue, Li",AAPS J,420,0

Limited data are available for asymptomatic infections. This study aims to present the clinical characteristics of 24 cases with asymptomatic infection screened from close contacts and to show the transmission potential of asymptomatic COVID-19 virus carriers. Epidemiological investigations were conducted among all close contacts of COVID-19 patients (or suspected patients) in Nanjing, Jiangsu Province, China, from Jan 28 to Feb 9, 2020, both in clinic and in community. Asymptomatic carriers were laboratory-confirmed positive for the COVID-19 virus by testing the nucleic acid of the pharyngeal swab samples. Their clinical records, laboratory assessments, and chest CT scans were reviewed. As a result, none of the 24 asymptomatic cases presented any obvious symptoms while nucleic acid screening. Five cases (20.8%) developed symptoms (fever, cough, fatigue, etc.) during hospitalization. Twelve (50.0%) cases showed typical CT images of ground-glass chest and 5 (20.8%) presented stripe shadowing in the lungs. The remaining 7 (29.2%) cases showed normal CT image and had no symptoms during hospitalization. These 7 cases were younger (median age: 14.0 years; P=0.012) than the rest. None of the 24 cases developed severe COVID-19 pneumonia or died. The median communicable period, defined as the interval from the first day of positive nucleic acid tests to the first day of continuous negative tests, was 9.5 days (up to 21 days among the 24 asymptomatic cases). Through epidemiological investigation, we observed a typical asymptomatic transmission to the cohabiting family members, which even caused severe COVID-19 pneumonia. Overall, the asymptomatic carriers identified from close contacts were prone to be mildly ill during hospitalization. However, the communicable period could be up to three weeks and the communicated patients could develop severe illness. These results highlighted the importance of close contact tracing and longitudinally surveillance via virus nucleic acid tests. Further isolation recommendation and continuous nucleic acid tests may also be recommended to the patients discharged.","Hu, Zhiliang; Song, Ci; Xu, Chuanjun; Jin, Guangfu; Chen, Yaling; Xu, Xin; Ma, Hongxia; Chen, Wei; Lin, Yuan; Zheng, Yishan; Wang, Jianming; Hu, Zhibin; Yi, Yongxiang; Shen, Hongbing",Sci China Life Sci,420,10

During vaccination, naked or vehicle loaded mRNA vaccines efficiently express tumor antigens in antigen-presenting cells (APCs), facilitate APC activation and innate/adaptive immune stimulation. mRNA cancer vaccine precedes other conventional vaccine platforms due to high potency, safe administration, rapid development potentials, and cost-effective manufacturing. However, mRNA vaccine applications have been limited by instability, innate immunogenicity, and inefficient in vivo delivery. Appropriate mRNA structure modifications (i.e., codon optimizations, nucleotide modifications, self-amplifying mRNAs, etc.) and formulation methods (i.e., lipid nanoparticles (LNPs), polymers, peptides, etc.) have been investigated to overcome these issues. Tuning the administration routes and co-delivery of multiple mRNA vaccines with other immunotherapeutic agents (e.g., checkpoint inhibitors) have further boosted the host anti-tumor immunity and increased the likelihood of tumor cell eradication. With the recent U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approvals of LNP-loaded mRNA vaccines for the prevention of COVID-19 and the promising therapeutic outcomes of mRNA cancer vaccines achieved in several clinical trials against multiple aggressive solid tumors, we envision the rapid advancing of mRNA vaccines for cancer immunotherapy in the near future.

This study documents the experiences of an international group of 10 physiology educators surrounding this transition. They wrote reflective narratives, framed by guiding questions, to answer the research question: ""What were the changes to physiology laboratories in response to the COVID-19 pandemic?"" These narratives probed educators' attitudes toward virtual laboratories before, during, and after the transition to remote delivery. Thematic analysis of the reflections found that before COVID-19 only a few respondents had utilized virtual laboratories and most felt that virtual laboratories could not replace the in-person laboratory experience. In response to university lockdowns, most respondents transitioned from traditional labs to remote formats within a week or less. The most common remote delivery formats were commercially available online physiology laboratories, homemade videos, and sample experimental data. The main challenges associated with the rapid remote transition included workload and expertise constraints, disparities in online access and workspaces, issues with academic integrity, educator and student stress, changes in learning outcomes, and reduced engagement. However, the experience generated opportunities including exploration of unfamiliar technologies, new collaborations, and revisiting the physiology laboratory curriculum and structure. Most of the respondents reported planning on retaining some aspects of the remote laboratories postpandemic, particularly with a blended model of remote and on-campus laboratories. This study concludes with recommendations for physiology educators as to how they can successfully develop and deliver remote laboratories.","Choate, Julia; Aguilar-Roca, Nancy; Beckett, Elizabeth; Etherington, Sarah; French, Michelle; Gaganis, Voula; Haigh, Charlotte; Scott, Derek; Sweeney, Terrence; Zubek, John",Adv Physiol Educ,420,18

In the Amazon region of Loreto, where malaria cases are concentrated, COVID-19 has led to near-complete closure of the primary healthcare system, and diagnosis and treatment of acute febrile illnesses, including malaria, has plummeted. Here, we describe the potential association of COVID-19 with a markedly reduced number of reported malaria cases due to the reduced control activities carried out by the Peruvian Malaria Zero Program, which could lead to malaria resurgence and an excess of morbidity and mortality.","Torres, Katherine; Alava, Freddy; Soto-Calle, Verónica; Llanos-Cuentas, Alejandro; Rodriguez, Hugo; Llacsahuanga, Lidia; Gamboa, Dionicia; Vinetz, Joseph",Am J Trop Med Hyg,420,16

Patients with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) are at higher risk of developing psychiatric disorders, which result in worsening of their disability. There are concerns about the mental health of MS patients during this pandemic. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to evaluate the prevalence of anxiety, depression, and levels of fear about Corona in MS patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study on MS patients who were admitted to the MS clinics affiliated with Isfahan University of medical sciences from May to June 2020. Anxiety and depression were evaluated according to the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). The Corona Fear Questionnaire developed by Ahorsu et al. was applied to evaluate the state of fear about COVID-19. Chi-square tests were used to compare depression and anxiety between different groups, Kruskal-Wallis was used for fear scores, Spearman correlation coefficient was also reported for correlations. RESULTS: 410 MS patients with a mean age of 38.6 years (±10.35) were enrolled in the study. Among those patients who answered the HADS questionnaire completely (n=399, n=388, for anxiety and depression subscales respectively) the prevalence of anxiety and depression were 31.2% (n=128) and 39.3% (n=161), respectively. There was no significant relationship between anxiety and depression with any of the following variables: sex, marital status, history of drug abuse, smoking, duration of taking psychiatric medication, being tested for COVID-19, being quarantined. Regarding fear about COVID-19, patients with depression or anxiety showed higher scores on the fear questionnaire (p-value=0.03, p-value=0.008 respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of anxiety and depression in MS patients was higher than previously reported. Fear about COVID-19 was correlated with anxiety and depression. Multicenter studies are required to develop specific recommendations for screening mental health problems in MS patients during COVID pandemic.","Ramezani, Neda; Ashtari, Fereshteh; Bastami, Elahe Abdi; Ghaderi, Kimia; Hosseini, Sayed Mohsen; Naeini, Maryam Kazemi; Rajabi, Fatemeh; Adibi, Iman",Mult Scler Relat Disord,420,1

LC-MS/MS is the official control method of veterinary drugs residues in food of animal origin. An experimental study was developed to evaluate the feasibility of proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) as a potential alternative approach to detect the presence of betamethasone residues. Eight rat liver samples were collected 24 h post-betamethasone-treatment from experimental and control animals and were analysed by 1H-MRS using a 7-Tesla MRI scanner. 1H-MR reference spectra both of the Bentelan formulation used for treatment, and of three solutions of betamethasone in dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO) at 5, 10 and 100 mM, respectively, were acquired to fit analyte-peaks in the liver samples spectra. Betamethasone-peaks were found only in the 100 mM betamethasone in DMSO solution spectrum. Betamethasone residues were not detected in any of the tissue samples analysed, probably related to the low concentration of injected drug. These findings allow us to establish, for the first time in the literature, the detection limit (in the range 10-100 mM) of betamethasone for the 7-Tesla MRI scanner used here. Given this very-low sensitivity, we conclude that the evaluated 1H-MR spectroscopy approach is not suitable for the detection of betamethasone residues in edible tissues, since the maximum residue limit imposed by Commission Regulation (EC) 37/2010 for betamethasone in the liver, and metabolic concentrations required to be detected in animal samples from livestock, are far below the detection limit we found.","Cicero, Luca; Cirincione, Roberta; Comelli, Albert; Coronnello, Claudia; Cassata, Giovanni",Food Addit Contam Part A Chem Anal Control Expo Risk Assess,420,22

We examined the magnitude and consistency of the sex differences in age-specific case-fatality rates (CFRs) in seven countries. METHODS: Data on the cases and deaths from COVID-19, by sex and age group, were extracted from the national official agencies from Denmark, England, Israel, Italy, Spain, Canada and Mexico. Age-specific CFRs were computed for males and females separately. The ratio of the male to female CFRs were computed and meta-analytic methods were used to obtained pooled estimates of the male to female ratio of the CFRs over the seven countries, for all age-groups. Meta-regression and sensitivity analysis were conducted to evaluate the age and country contribution to differences. RESULTS: The CFRs were consistently higher in males at all ages. The pooled M:F CFR ratios were 1.71, 1.88, 2.11, 2.11, 1.84, 1.78 and 1.49, for ages 20-29, 30-39, 40-49, 50-59, 60-69, 70-79, 80+ respectively. In meta-regression, age group and country were associated with the heterogeneity in the CFR ratios. CONCLUSIONS: The sex differences in the age-specific CFRs are intriguing. Sex differences in the incidence and mortality have been found in many infectious diseases. For COVID-19, factors such as sex differences in the prevalence of underlying diseases may play a part in the CFR differences. However, the consistently greater case-fatality rates in males at all ages suggests that sex-related factors impact on the natural history of the disease. This could provide important clues as to the mechanisms underlying the severity of COVID-19 in some patients.","Green, Manfred S; Nitzan, Dorit; Schwartz, Naama; Niv, Yaron; Peer, Victoria",PLoS One,420,20

In the case of COVID-19 pandemic in a developing country such as Bangladesh, however, the fact is that some physicians decline either to report for duty or to treat patients presenting with COVID-19 symptoms. At issue ethically is whether such medical practitioners are to be automatically disciplined for dereliction of duty and gross negligence; or, on the contrary, such physicians may legitimately claim a professional right of autonomous judgment, on the basis of which professional right they may justifiably decline to treat patients. METHODS: This ethical issue is examined with a view to providing some guidance and recommendations, insofar as the conditions of medical practice in an under-resourced country such as Bangladesh are vastly different from medical practice in an industrialized nation such as the USA. The concept of moral dilemma as discussed by philosopher Michael Shaw Perry and philosopher Immanuel Kant's views on moral appeal to ""emergency"" are considered pertinent to sorting through the moral conundrum of medical care during pandemic. RESULTS: Our analysis allows for conditional physician discretion in the decision to treat COVID-19 patients, i.e., in the absence of personal protective equipment (PPE) combined with claim of duty to family. Physicians are nonetheless expected to provide a minimum of initial clinical assessment and stabilization of a patient before initiating transfer of a patient to a ""designated"" COVID-19 hospital. The latter is to be done in coordination with the national center control room that can assure admission of a patient to a referral hospital prior to ambulance transport. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of a moral dilemma (i.e., conflict of obligations) in the pandemic situation of clinical care requires institutional authorities to exercise tolerance of individual physician moral decision about the duty to care. Hospital or government authority should respond to such decisions without introducing immediate sanction, such as suspension from all clinical duties or termination of licensure, and instead arrange for alternative clinical duties consistent with routine medical care.","Swazo, Norman K; Talukder, Md Munir Hossain; Ahsan, Mohammad Kamrul",Philos Ethics Humanit Med,420,29

Apparently, the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is armed by special abilities to spread and dysregulate the immune mechanisms. The likelihood of oropharyngeal candidiasis (OPC) development in COVID-19 patients with a list of attributable risk factors for oral infections has not yet been investigated. OBJECTIVES: We here aim to investigate the prevalence, causative agents and antifungal susceptibility pattern of OPC in Iranian COVID-19 patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 53 hospitalised COVID-19 patients with OPC were studied. Relevant clinical data were mined. Strain identification was performed by 21-plex PCR and sequencing of the internal transcribed spacer region (ITS1-5.8S-ITS2). Antifungal susceptibility testing to fluconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, amphotericin B, caspofungin, micafungin and anidulafungin was performed according to the CLSI broth dilution method. RESULTS: In 53 COVID-19 patients with OPC, cardiovascular diseases (52.83%) and diabetes (37.7%) were the principal underlying conditions. The most common risk factor was lymphopaenia (71%). In total, 65 Candida isolates causing OPC were recovered. C albicans (70.7%) was the most common, followed by C glabrata (10.7%), C dubliniensis (9.2%), C parapsilosis sensu stricto (4.6%), C tropicalis (3%) and Pichia kudriavzevii (=C krusei, 1.5%). Majority of the Candida isolates were susceptible to all three classes of antifungal drugs. CONCLUSION: Our data clarified some concerns regarding the occurrence of OPC in Iranian COVID-19 patients.

In order to target control measures and plan for future waves of the epidemic, public health agencies need to understand how these vulnerabilities are distributed across and clustered within communities. METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional ecological analysis across 6789 small areas in England. We assessed the association between COVID-19 mortality in each area and five vulnerability measures relating to ethnicity, poverty, prevalence of long-term health conditions, living in care homes and living in overcrowded housing. Estimates from multivariable Poisson regression models were used to derive a Small Area Vulnerability Index. RESULTS: Four vulnerability measures were independently associated with age-adjusted COVID-19 mortality. Each SD increase in the proportion of the population (1) living in care homes, (2) admitted to hospital in the past 5 years for a long-term health condition, (3) from an ethnic minority background and (4) living in overcrowded housing was associated with a 28%, 19% 8% and 11% increase in age-adjusted COVID-19 mortality rate, respectively. CONCLUSION: Vulnerability to COVID-19 was noticeably higher in the North West, West Midlands and North East regions, with high levels of vulnerability clustered in some communities.

As the early-stage and entry-level product of the voice-enabled smart home industry, the smart speakers have been going through rapid development and rising fierce market competition globally in recent years. China, one of the most populous and largest markets in the world, has tremendous business potential in the smart home industry. The market sales of smart speakers in China have gone through rapid growth in the past three years. However, the market penetration rate of related smart home devices and equipment still stays extremely low and far from mass adoption. Moreover, the market sales of smart speakers have also entered a significant slowdown and adjustment period since 2020. Chinese consumers have moved from early impulsive consumption to a rational consumption phase about this early-stage smart home product. Trust in the marketing field is considered an indispensable component of all business transactions, which plays a crucial role in adopting new technologies. This study explores the influencing factors of Chinese users' perceived trust in the voice-enabled smart home systems, uses structural equation modeling (SEM) to analyze the interaction mechanism between different variables, and establishes a perceived trust model through 475 valid samples. The model includes six variables: system quality, familiarity, subjective norm, technology optimism, perceived enjoyment, and perceived trust. The result shows that system quality is the essential influence factor that impacts all other variables and could significantly affect the perceived trust. Perceived enjoyment is the most direct influence variable affected by system quality, subjective norm, and technology optimism, and it positively affects the perceived trust in the end. The subjective norm is one of the most distinguishing variables for Chinese users, since China has a collectivist consumption culture. People always expect their behavior to meet social expectations and standards to avoid criticism and acquire social integration. Therefore, policy guidance, authoritative opinions, and people with important reference roles will significantly affect consumers' perceived trust and purchase intention. Familiarity and technology optimism are important influential factors that will have an indirect impact on the perceived trust. The related results of this study can help designers, practitioners, and researchers of the smart home industry produce products and services with higher perceived trust to improve consumers' adoption and acceptance so that the market penetration rate of related products and enterprises could be increased, and the maturity and development of the voice-enabled smart home industry could be promoted.","Liu, Yuqi; Gan, Yan; Song, Yao; Liu, Jing",Sensors (Basel),420,1

However, the effect of renin-angiotensin system (RAS)-inhibition on ACE2 expression in human tissues of key relevance to blood pressure regulation and COVID-19 infection has not previously been reported. METHODS AND RESULTS: We examined how hypertension, its major metabolic co-phenotypes, and antihypertensive medications relate to ACE2 renal expression using information from up to 436 patients whose kidney transcriptomes were characterized by RNA-sequencing. We further validated some of the key observations in other human tissues and/or a controlled experimental model. Our data reveal increasing expression of ACE2 with age in both human lungs and the kidney. We show no association between renal expression of ACE2 and either hypertension or common types of RAS inhibiting drugs. We demonstrate that renal abundance of ACE2 is positively associated with a biochemical index of kidney function and show a strong enrichment for genes responsible for kidney health and disease in ACE2 co-expression analysis. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that neither hypertension nor antihypertensive treatment is likely to alter the expression of the key entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2 in the human kidney. Our data further suggest that in the absence of SARS-CoV-2 infection, kidney ACE2 is most likely nephro-protective but the age-related increase in its expression within lungs and kidneys may be relevant to the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Jiang, Xiao; Eales, James M; Scannali, David; Nazgiewicz, Alicja; Prestes, Priscilla; Maier, Michelle; Denniff, Matthew; Xu, Xiaoguang; Saluja, Sushant; Cano-Gamez, Eddie; Wystrychowski, Wojciech; Szulinska, Monika; Antczak, Andrzej; Byars, Sean; Skrypnik, Damian; Glyda, Maciej; Król, Robert; Zywiec, Joanna; Zukowska-Szczechowska, Ewa; Burrell, Louise M; Woolf, Adrian S; Greenstein, Adam; Bogdanski, Pawel; Keavney, Bernard; Morris, Andrew P; Heagerty, Anthony; Williams, Bryan; Harrap, Stephen B; Trynka, Gosia; Samani, Nilesh J; Guzik, Tomasz J; Charchar, Fadi J; Tomaszewski, Maciej",Eur Heart J,420,16

This unique 3' end distinguishes replication-dependent histone mRNAs from all other eukaryotic mRNAs, which end with a poly(A) tail produced by the canonical 3'-end processing mechanism of cleavage and polyadenylation. The pioneering studies of Max Birnstiel's group demonstrated nearly 40 years ago that the unique 3' end of animal replication-dependent histone mRNAs is generated by a distinct processing mechanism, whereby histone mRNA precursors are cleaved downstream of the stem-loop, but this cleavage is not followed by polyadenylation. The key role is played by the U7 snRNP, a complex of a â¼60 nucleotide U7 snRNA and many proteins. Some of these proteins, including the enzymatic component CPSF73, are shared with the canonical cleavage and polyadenylation machinery, justifying the view that the two metazoan pre-mRNA 3'-end processing mechanisms have a common evolutionary origin. The studies on U7 snRNP culminated in the recent breakthrough of reconstituting an entirely recombinant human machinery that is capable of accurately cleaving histone pre-mRNAs, and determining its structure in complex with a pre-mRNA substrate (with 13 proteins and two RNAs) that is poised for the cleavage reaction. The structure uncovered an unanticipated network of interactions within the U7 snRNP and a remarkable mechanism of activating catalytically dormant CPSF73 for the cleavage. This work provides a conceptual framework for understanding other eukaryotic 3'-end processing machineries.","Dominski, Zbigniew; Tong, Liang",Biochem. Soc. Trans,420,5

We aimed to reveal the general health status of the pediatric asthmatic patients during the pandemic, considering the role of household factors in parental attitudes. METHODS: We asked 60 asthmatic patients and their parents to respond to a questionnaire, aiming to reveal the current health status of the patients and the general approach of the family to the asthma management during the pandemic. RESULTS: A total of 8 patients had had an asthma attack during the outbreak, but there was no confirmed correlation with COVID-19 infection. Most of the parents had never considered to stop their children's current medications. However, the majority of them reported concerns about failure of the ambulatory care services and almost all saw their children as being at high risk for COVID-19 infection. There was no significant relationship between these concerns and their psychological statuses (p>0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The crucial point of asthma management is to keep down both patients' medical and psychological status that may lead to minimize the effects of the pandemic. Healthcare professionals should also pay attention to household members of the patients that their adaptation period to 'new normal'of pandemic may directly effect the patients state of health.","Hepkaya, Evrim; Kilinc, Ayse Ayzit; Cebi, Memnune Nur; Koyuncu, Zehra; Cokugras, Haluk",Pediatr Int,420,16

By the end of April 2020, governments and professional organisations were publishing recommendations or guidance for the reopening/restructuring of dental services. The aim of this study was to assess how dental aerosol-generating procedures (AGPs) were defined in international dental guidelines, what mitigation processes were advised, and whether they were linked to COVID-19 epidemiology. METHODS: Electronic searches of a broad range of databases, along with grey literature searches, without language restriction were conducted up to 13 July 2020. Recommendations for the use of face masks and fallow times with patients without COVID-19 were assessed against the deaths per 1 million population in the included countries and country income level using Pearson Chi-squared statistics. RESULTS: Sixty-three guidance documents were included. Most (98%) indicated that AGPs can be performed with patients without COVID-19 with caveats, including advice to restrict AGPs where possible, with 21% only recommending AGPs for dental emergencies. Face masks were recommended by most documents (94%), with 91% also specifying the use of goggles or face shields. Fallow periods for patients without COVID-19 were mentioned in 48% of documents, ranging from 2 to 180 minutes. There were no significant differences in recommendations for face masks or fallow time in patients without COVID-19 by country death rate (P = .463 and P = .901) or World Bank status (P = .504 and P = .835). Most documents recommended procedural or environmental mitigations such as preprocedural mouthwash (82%) and general ventilation (52%). Few documents provided underpinning evidence for their recommendations. CONCLUSIONS: While the amount of high-quality direct evidence related to dentistry and COVID-19 remains limited, it is important to be explicit about the considered judgements for recommendations as well as generate new evidence to face this challenge.","Robertson, Clare; Clarkson, Jan E; Aceves-Martins, Magaly; Ramsay, Craig R; Richards, Derek; Colloc, Thibault",Int. dent. j,420,26

The transmission of such pathogens to humans may lead to self-sustaining chains of transmission. These pathogens represent the highest risk for future pandemics. For their prevention, the transmission over the species barrier - although rare - should, by all means, be avoided. In the current COVID-19 pandemic, surprisingly though, most of the current research concentrates on the control by drugs and vaccines, while comparatively little scientific inquiry focuses on future prevention. Already in 2012, the World Bank recommended to engage in a systemic One Health approach for zoonoses control, considering integrated surveillance-response and control of human and animal diseases for primarily economic reasons. First examples, like integrated West Nile virus surveillance in mosquitos, wild birds, horses and humans in Italy show evidence of financial savings from a closer cooperation of human and animal health sectors. Provided a zoonotic origin can be ascertained for the COVID-19 pandemic, integrated wildlife, domestic animal and humans disease surveillance-response may contribute to prevent future outbreaks. In conclusion, the earlier a zoonotic pathogen can be detected in the environment, in wildlife or in domestic animals; and the better human, animal and environmental surveillance communicate with each other to prevent an outbreak, the lower are the cumulative costs.","Zinsstag, Jakob; Utzinger, Jürg; Probst-Hensch, Nicole; Shan, Lv; Zhou, Xiao-Nong",Infect Dis Poverty,420,2

In this research note, I suggest that belief in masculine norms partly explains these differences. Using data from a large (n=100,689) survey of American adults conducted between March and June by the Democracy Fund + UCLA (Nationscape), I find that sexist beliefs, a component of masculine norms, are consistently the strongest predictor of coronavirus-related emotions, behaviors, policy attitudes, and ultimately contracting COVID-19.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the level of awareness, perception, and attitude regarding the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and infection control among Jordanian dentists. METHODS: The study population consisted of dentists who worked in private clinics, hospitals, and health centers in Jordan. An online questionnaire was sent to a sample of Jordanian dentists in March 2020. The questionnaire was comprised of a series of questions about dentists' demographic characteristics; their awareness of the incubation period, the symptoms of the disease, mode of transmission of COVID-19 and infection control measures for preventing COVID-19; and their attitude toward treating patients with COVID-19. RESULTS: This study included a total of 368 dentists aged 22-73 years (mean 32.9 years, SD 10.6 years). A total of 112 (30.4%) dentists had completed a master or residency program in dentistry, 195 (53.0%) had received training in infection control in dentistry, and 28 (7.6%) had attended training or lectures regarding COVID-19. A total of 133 (36.1%) dentists reported that the incubation period is 1-14 days. The majority of dentists were aware of COVID-19 symptoms and ways of identifying patients at risk of having COVID-19, were able to correctly report known modes of transmission, and were aware of measures for preventing COVID-19 transmission in dental clinics. A total of 275 (74.7%) believed that it was necessary to ask patients to sit far from each other, wear masks while in the waiting room, and wash hands before getting in the dental chair to decrease disease transmission.

Internet of Health Things (IoHT) networks have privacy requirements within a healthcare setting. However, these networks have unique challenges and security requirements (integrity, authentication, privacy and availability) must also be balanced with the need to maintain efficiency in order to conserve battery power, which can be a significant limitation in IoHT devices and networks. Data are usually transferred without undergoing filtering or optimization, and this traffic can overload sensors and cause rapid battery consumption when interacting with IoHT networks. This consequently poses restrictions on the practical implementation of these devices. As a solution to address the issues, this paper proposes a privacy-preserving two-tier data inference framework, this can conserve battery consumption by reducing the data size required to transmit through inferring the sensed data and can also protect the sensitive data from leakage to adversaries. Results from experimental evaluations on privacy show the validity of the proposed scheme as well as significant data savings without compromising the accuracy of the data transmission, which contributes to energy efficiency of IoHT sensor devices.","Kang, James Jin; Dibaei, Mahdi; Luo, Gang; Yang, Wencheng; Zheng, Xi",,420,13

Telehealth interventions have been seen as a useful resource with potential to improve clinical effectiveness. OBJECTIVE: To describe the implementation of a spiritual and psychological palliative telehealth system during the pandemic. METHODS: Pilot study based on the implementation of a telehealth system designed to support hospitalized patients referred to a mobile palliative care team, through synchronic videoconferences, and including patients' relatives. The implementation included protocol development, physical infrastructure, and training. The intervention consisted of spiritual and psychological telehealth sessions performed remotely by the chaplain and psychologist of a palliative care team. RESULTS: During the study period 59 patients were recruited, median age of 70 years, 57.6% females. The primary diagnosis was severe COVID-19 (50.8%), advanced cancer (32.2%) and advanced chronic illness (16.9%). A total of 211 telehealth sessions were carried out, 82% psychological and 18% spiritual. The main criteria for psychological sessions were being related to seriously ill patients with withdrawal or withholding of life-support treatment (60.1%). The main criteria for spiritual sessions were being a patient with spiritual suffering or requesting spiritual assistance (73.6%). An electronic user satisfaction survey indicated high satisfaction rates. CONCLUSION: This report demonstrates that it is possible to provide spiritual and psychological palliative care to hospitalized patients and families during pandemic restrictions through interdisciplinary telehealth delivery.","Palma, Alejandra; Rojas, Verónica; Ihl, Fernando; Ávila, Cristina; Plaza-Parrochia, Francisca; Estuardo, Nivia; Castillo, Domingo",J. pain symptom manage,420,26

We studied prostate cancer (PCa) protein-protein interaction (PPI) network constructed from patients' gene expression datasets and found that the network exhibits hierarchical scale free topology which lacks centrality lethality rule. Knockout experiments of the sets of leading hubs from the network leads to transition from hierarchical (HN) to scale free (SF) topology affecting network integration and organization. This transition, HNâ¯ââ¯SF, due to removal of significant number of the highest degree hubs, leads to relatively decrease in information processing efficiency, cost effectiveness of signal propagation, compactness, clustering of nodes and energy distributions. A systematic transition from a diassortative PCa PPI network to assortative networks after the removal of top 50 hubs then again reverting to disassortativity nature on further removal of the hubs was also observed indicating the dominance of the largest hubs in PCa network intergration. Further, functional classification of the hubs done by using within module degrees and participation coefficients for PCa network, and leading hubs knockout experiments indicated that kinless hubs serve as the basis of establishing links among constituting modules and heterogeneous nodes to maintain network stabilization. We, then, checked the essentiality of the hubs in the knockout experiment by performing Fisher's exact test on the hubs, and showed that removal of kinless hubs corresponded to maximum lethality in the network. However, excess removal of these hubs essentially may cause network breakdown.","Mangangcha, Irengbam Rocky; Malik, Md Zubbair; Kucuk, Omer; Ali, Shakir; Singh, R K Brojen",Genomics,420,16

The aim of this study was to compare the number and type of patients attending a hospital emergency unit before and during the COVID-19 pandemic in order to avoid the impact of any difference on the community's healthcare and on healthcare providers. Methods: This study assessed differences in the numbers of patients attending the emergency department in 2018, 2019 and 2020, and then determined whether a particular patient type accounted for any such difference. An open-source data repository was accessed to collect the data targeting a private hospital in Riyadh city, the capital of Saudi Arabia. Descriptive statistics and a paired t-test were used to verify the level of variations in the number of patients attending the emergency rooms. Results: Results showed no statistically significant difference in the number of patients attending the emergency department between 2018 and 2019, while a noticeable drop was found in the number of patients attending the department between 2019 and 2020. Conclusion: The reduction in the number of patients attending the emergency department was found in some but not all patient types. These conclusion highlight variations in ED attendance of which hospital management should be aware so that action can be taken to avoid negative consequences.","Abdelhadi, A.",Journal of multidisciplinary healthcare,420,26

MethodsCOVID-19 case series (March 6, 2020 - January 10, 2021) were shifted by 9 days to approximate the infection date. We analyzed the effects of state and county policies on Rt using EpiEstim. We performed linear regression to evaluate if per-capita cumulative case count varies across counties with different population size. ResultsRt shifted from 2-3 in March to <1 during April and May. Rt rose over the summer and stayed between 1.4 and 0.7. The introduction of statewide mask mandates was associated with a decline in Rt (-15.3%; 95% CrI, -13.6%, -16.8%), and school re-opening, an increase by 12.3% (95% CrI, 10.1%, 14.4%). Less densely populated counties had higher attack rate (p<0.0001). ConclusionThe Rt dynamics over time indicated that public health interventions substantially slowed COVID-19 transmission in South Carolina, while their relaxation may have promoted further transmission. Policies encouraging people to stay home, such as closing non-essential businesses, were associated with Rt reduction, while policies that encouraged more movement, such as re-opening schools, were associated with Rt increase.","Davies, Margaret R.; Hua, Xinyi; Jacobs, Terrence D.; Wiggill, Gabi I.; Lai, Po-Ying; Du, Zhanwei; DebRoy, Swati; Robb, Sara Wagner; Chowell, Gerardo; Fung, Isaac Chun-Hai",,420,1

Our previous mechanistic and neuroimaging work in young rhesus monkeys linked the central nucleus of the amygdala to AT and its underlying neural circuit. METHODS: Here, we used laser capture microscopy and RNA sequencing in 47 young rhesus monkeys to investigate AT's molecular underpinnings by focusing on neurons from the lateral division of the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeL). RNA sequencing identified numerous AT-related CeL transcripts, and we used immunofluorescence (n = 3) and tract-tracing (n = 2) methods in a different sample of monkeys to examine the expression, distribution, and projection pattern of neurons expressing one of these transcripts. RESULTS: We found 555 AT-related transcripts, 14 of which were confirmed with high statistical confidence (false discovery rate < .10), including protein kinase C delta (PKCÎ´), a CeL microcircuit cell marker implicated in rodent threat processing. We characterized PKCÎ´ neurons in the rhesus CeL, compared its distribution with that of the mouse, and demonstrated that a subset of these neurons project to the laterodorsal bed nucleus of the stria terminalis. CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate that CeL PKCÎ´ is associated with primate anxiety, provides evidence of a CeL to laterodorsal bed nucleus of the stria terminalis circuit that may be relevant to understanding human anxiety, and points to specific molecules within this circuit that could serve as potential treatment targets for anxiety disorders.","Kovner, Rothem; Souaiaia, Tade; Fox, Andrew S; French, Delores A; Goss, Cooper E; Roseboom, Patrick H; Oler, Jonathan A; Riedel, Marissa K; Fekete, Eva M; Fudge, Julie L; Knowles, James A; Kalin, Ned H",Biol. psychiatr,420,20

At the moment, no reports are available regarding thrombosis of prosthetic vascular grafts. We present the case of a patient with COVID-19-related pneumonia, who suffered from the acute thrombosis of a previously implanted aortic graft. METHODS AND RESULTS: A 67-year-old male patient, who had undergone open repair of an abdominal aortic aneurysm with a bifurcated graft 6 years before, was admitted to the emergency department with high fever for a week without cough or dyspnea. Thoracic ultrasound showed signs of bilateral interstitial pneumonia, and the Sars-Cov-2 swab was positive. Antiretroviral therapy and prophylactic low molecular weight heparin treatment were initiated. Owing to the progressive impairment of the respiratory function, the patient was intubated after eight days from the admission, the day after he showed signs of bilateral acute limb ischemia. A duplex ultrasound demonstrated the complete thrombosis of the aortic graft without flow at the femoral level. An urgent angio-computed tomography scan for revascularization purpose was requested, but the patient died on the arrival in the radiological suite. CONCLUSIONS: Acute thrombosis of vascular prosthetic grafts is a possible, catastrophic complication of COVID-19 infection. In COVID-19 patients with prosthetic graft, an aggressive antithrombotic treatment could be considered to prevent such an event.","Giacomelli, Elena; Dorigo, Walter; Fargion, Aaron; Calugi, Gianmarco; Cianchi, Giovanni; Pratesi, Carlo",Ann Vasc Surg,420,26

With access to these data, the authors extend that work and support a definite construct for auditory processing disorder (APD). The goal here is to examine MAPA-2 reliability and validity (construct, content, and concurrent). Evidence for the APD construct is further buttressed by measures of sensitivity and specificity. Results of MAPA-2 testing on children diagnosed with learning disability (LD), attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and specific language impairment (SLI) are included. Method Normative data (previously published as the MAPA-2) allowing derivation of these findings included a representative sample of 748 children (53% girls) ages 7-14 years tested by 54 speech-language pathologists and audiologists in 27 U.S. states. The authors examined diagnostic accuracy based on the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association (2005) criteria (index test) for confirmed cases of APD. The index was also used to identify listening problems for three other diagnostic categories (LD, ADHD, and SLI). Validated questionnaire responses from parents and school personnel allowed incorporation of functional measures widely supported in APD diagnosis but unavailable with other normative and sensitivity/specificity studies. Results Reliability and validity were both satisfactory, and diagnostic accuracy for an APD group of 18 (28% female) compared to the remaining typical group of 625 yielded 89% sensitivity and 82% specificity. The remaining three groups (LD, ADHD, and SLI), where comorbidity was expected to be about 50%, had APD-type listening problems with a prevalence ranging from 52% to 65%. Conclusions Current results provide important evidence for the construct of APD. The MAPA-2 can be administered by an audiologist or speech-language pathologist. A similar diagnostic protocol in Australia yielded positive therapeutic gains.

Among the putative links between hypertension and COVID-19 is a key counter-regulatory component of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS): angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). ACE2 facilitates entry of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, the virus responsible for COVID-19, into host cells. Because RAS inhibitors have been suggested to increase ACE2 expression, health-care providers and patients have grappled with the decision of whether to discontinue these medications during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, experimental models of analogous viral pneumonias suggest RAS inhibitors may exert protective effects against acute lung injury. We review how RAS and ACE2 biology may affect outcomes in COVID-19 through pulmonary and other systemic effects. In addition, we briefly detail the data for and against continuation of RAS inhibitors in persons with COVID-19 and summarize the current consensus recommendations from select specialty organizations.","Edmonston, Daniel L.; South, Andrew M.; Sparks, Matthew A.; Cohen, Jordana B.",Adv.

Scholars and supporters from both the public and private sector proclaim that innovations in financial technology will ""bank the unbanked"" and open new channels to affordable credit. This exuberance for all things tech in finance has led to a quiet yet aggressive deregulatory agenda, including, as of late, a federal assault via rulemaking on the ability of states to police the cost and privilege of extending credit within their borders. This deregulation and the ethos behind it have made space for growth in high-cost, predatory lending that reaches across state lines via websites and smart phones and aggressively targets cash-strapped families. These loans are made using a business model whereby funds are funneled through a group of lightly regulated banks in a way designed to take advantage of federal preemption. Fintech companies rent out and profit from the special legal status of these bank partners, which in turn keeps the bank's involvement in the shadows. Stripping down predatory fintech's practices and showing them for what they really are, this Article situates fintech in the context of this country's longstanding dual banking wars, both between states and the federal government and between consumer advocates and banking regulators. And it points the way forward for scholars and regulators willing to shake off fintech's hypnotic effect. This means, in the short term, using existing regulatory tools to curtail the dangerous lending identified here, including by taking a more expansive view of what it means for a bank to operate safely and soundly under the law. In the long term, it means having a more comprehensive and national discussion about how we regulate household credit in the digital age, specifically through the convening of a Twenty-First Century Commission on Consumer Finance. The Article explains how and why the time is ripe to do both. As the current pandemic wipes out wages and decimates savings, leaving desperate families turning to predatory fintech finance ever more, the need for reform has never been greater.

Although cross-sex hormone treatment (CSHT) is usually considered safe, serious adverse events may occur. Here we report a case of deep vein thrombosis associated with estradiol treatment in an otherwise healthy young transgender woman. Case Presentation: A 21-year-old transgender woman using CSHT applied to our outpatient clinic with the complaint of painful swelling in her left leg. She was diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the same leg one year earlier when she was admitted to the emergency room of another hospital with similar symptoms, and was given warfarin treatment for 3 months which has improved the symptoms. Three months after cessation of warfarin, symptoms re-occurred, but she was only able to apply to our clinic after another 3 months due to COVID-19 pandemic. Physical examination was unremarkable except asymmetrical swelling in the left leg. She has been receiving oral estradiol 6 mg/day and spironolactone 200 mg/day for 2 years. She denied taking estradiol in higher doses than recommended. She did not have any predisposing factors for DVT including obesity, immobilization and smoking. She had no prior history of venous thromboembolic events (VTE). Family history was also negative for thrombophilia except her uncle was diagnosed with ischemic cerebrovascular event at the age of 60. Lower extremity venous doppler ultrasonography revealed a thrombus in the left popliteal vein that caused total obstruction of blood flow to the distal. Plasma levels of d-dimer and fibrinogen were 0.35 mg/L and 262 mg/dL, respectively. Serum levels of sex hormones were estradiol: 204 pg/mL, total testosterone: 22.4 ng/dL, FSH: 0.22 mIU/mL, LH: 1.5 mIU/mL. Thrombophilia panel revealed a homozygous mutation in MTHFR (1296), and heterozygous mutations in both Factor V Leiden and plasma activator inhibitor (4G/5G). She was given enoxaparin in addition to warfarin until INR was elevated up to desired levels. Oral estradiol treatment was switched to transdermal route. Life-long anticoagulant treatment was suggested since the thrombotic event was triggered by estradiol treatment which will be continued. Conclusions: Limited data are available on incidence and management of VTE associated with estradiol treatment in male-to-female individuals. As in general population, routine screening for thrombophilia is not recommended in transgender women prior to the initiation of CSHT if no personal or family history of VTE is present. Even in the absence of predisposing factors, life-long anticoagulant therapy may be considered since the VTE-provoking estradiol treatment will be continued. Switching the route of estradiol treatment from oral to transdermal may be beneficial.","Oguz, Seda Hanife Buyukasik Yahya Yildiz Bulent O.",Journal of the Endocrine Society,420,16

Forecasting the long-term trend of the COVID-19 epidemic can help health authorities determine the transmission characteristics of the virus and take appropriate prevention and control strategies beforehand. Previous studies that solely applied traditional epidemic models or machine learning models were subject to underfitting or overfitting problems. We propose a new model named Dynamic-Susceptible-Exposed-Infective-Quarantined (D-SEIQ), by making appropriate modifications of the Susceptible-Exposed-Infective-Recovered (SEIR) model and integrating machine learning based parameter optimization under epidemiological rational constraints. We used the model to predict the long-term reported cumulative numbers of COVID-19 cases in China from January 27, 2020. We evaluated our model on officially reported confirmed cases from three different regions in China, and the results proved the effectiveness of our model in terms of simulating and predicting the trend of the COVID-19 outbreak. In China-Excluding-Hubei area within 7 days after the first public report, our model successfully and accurately predicted the long trend up to 40 days and the exact date of the outbreak peak. The predicted cumulative number (12,506) by March 10, 2020, was only 3·8% different from the actual number (13,005). The parameters obtained by our model proved the effectiveness of prevention and intervention strategies on epidemic control in China. The prediction results for five other countries suggested the external validity of our model. The integrated approach of epidemic and machine learning models could accurately forecast the long-term trend of the COVID-19 outbreak. The model parameters also provided insights into the analysis of COVID-19 transmission and the effectiveness of interventions in China.","Sun, Jichao; Chen, Xi; Zhang, Ziheng; Lai, Shengzhang; Zhao, Bo; Liu, Hualuo; Wang, Shuojia; Huan, Wenjing; Zhao, Ruihui; Ng, Man Tat Alexander; Zheng, Yefeng",Sci Rep,420,10

METHOD AND MATERIALS: A total of 103 hospitalized patients were offered one of three options to control N/V. Patient choice was considered in the holistic trial design so that patients were not denied either the essential oil or antiemetics. Patients rated nausea 0 to 10 on the Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale at symptom onset and within 60 minutes of the intervention. RESULTS: Only three subjects enrolled in the antiemetic arm; thus this arm was eliminated from analysis, resulting in 100 evaluable patients. Mean nausea score improved significantly for the entire sample following the aromatherapy or aromatherapy/antiemetic intervention (p < .0001). Patients in the aromatherapy arm had significant improvement in nausea compared to the combined aromatherapy/antiemetic arm (p < .0001). Patient perception that peppermint oil relieves N/V significantly improved for the entire sample. Notable is that 65% of patients used peppermint essential oil alone. CONCLUSIONS: Peppermint essential oil is an effective independent or complementary modality for relief of N/V in hospitalized patients. Research designs that incorporate patient decision making should be considered for studies in which placebos do not contribute to holistic care.","Mohr, Carla; Jensen, Cassandra; Padden, Nicole; Besel, Jamie M; Brant, Jeannine M",J Holist Nurs,420,1

Membrane (M) protein of SARS-CoV-2 has been reported to suppress host IFN-I production, but the underlying mechanism is not completely understood. In this study, SARS-CoV-2 M protein was confirmed to suppress the expression of IFNß and interferon-stimulated genes induced by RIG-I, MDA5, IKKÏµ, and TBK1, and to inhibit IRF3 phosphorylation and dimerization caused by TBK1. SARS-CoV-2 M could interact with MDA5, TRAF3, IKKÏµ, and TBK1, and induce TBK1 degradation via K48-linked ubiquitination. The reduced TBK1 further impaired the formation of TRAF3-TANK-TBK1-IKKÎµ complex that leads to inhibition of IFN-I production. Our study revealed a novel mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 M for negative regulation of IFN-I production, which would provide deeper insight into the innate immunosuppression and pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2.","Sui, Liyan; Zhao, Yinghua; Wang, Wenfang; Wu, Ping; Wang, Zedong; Yu, Yang; Hou, Zhijun; Tan, Guangyun; Liu, Quan",Front Immunol,420,16

In April 2020, clinicians at 56 Dean Street sexual health and advice clinic in central London described social isolation as 'a unique window of opportunity' to 'break the chain' in HIV transmission. This was followed by critical responses within HIV prevention circles. Drawing from these responses, this article examines the implications of the clinic's 'Test Now, Stop HIV' campaign by asking how has the early COVID-19 pandemic reshaped institutional responses and strategies to end HIV transmission in England? We assess how campaign messages developed between April and May 2020. We analyse materials related to the campaign, including the clinic's Twitter account, the campaign website, and journalism in mainstream media. Based on this information, we discuss three themes: testing and issues of access; the biopolitics of testing; and the idealism of quarantine. We draw on sociology, cultural theory and science and technology studies to describe how the 'end of HIV' was constructed through the link between COVID-19 and HIV. We suggest the campaign reinscribes historical perceptions of abstinence and quarantine as idealised HIV prevention strategies, and thus fails to address safer sex in the time of Coronavirus.","Ledin, Chase; Weil, Benjamin",Cult Health Sex,420,26

Despite social and economic concerns, this epidemiologic emergency has brought unexpected positive consequences for environmental quality as human activities were reduced. In this paper, the impact of restricted human activities on urban air quality in Ecuador is investigated. This country implemented a particularly strict set of quarantine measures at the very dawn of the exponential growth of infections on March 17, 2020. As a result, significant reductions in the concentrations of NO2(–68%), SO2(–48%), CO (–38%) and PM2.5(–29%) were measured in the capital city of Quito during the first month of quarantine. This large drop in air pollution concentrations occurred at all the monitoring sites in Quito, serving as a valuable proof of the anthropogenic impact on urban air quality. The spatial evolution of atmospheric pollution using observed surface and satellite data, showed different results for the two major cities: Quito and Guayaquil. While the population in Quito adhered to the quarantine measures immediately, in the port city of Guayaquil, quarantine measures were slow to be adopted and, thus, the effect on air quality in Guayaquil occurred more slowly. This lag could have a considerable cost to the mortality rate in the port city, not only due to the spread of the disease but also due to the poor air quality. Overall, the air quality data demonstrate how quickly air quality can improve when emissions are reduced.","Zalakeviciute, Rasa; Vasquez, Renne; Bayas, Daniel; Buenano, Adrian; Mejia, Danilo; Zegarra, Rafael; Diaz, Valeria; Lamb, Brian",Aerosol Air Qual.

We discuss, firstly, the existence and stability of the disease-free and endemic equilibrium of wild animals and environment-only model; this happens to be the initial stage of disease transmission. Further, with the intervention of control measures, the model degenerates into a subsystem with only human population and environment; the existence and stability of the disease-free equilibrium of this subsystem are studied. With the strengthening of control strategies, the environment and human population subsystems have further degenerated into a human population-only model with blocking migration and environment; the ultimate extinction of this disease and the peak of the outbreak are researched. Finally, some numerical simulations are carried to explain the main results and the impacts of various control strategies on the disease outbreak. In particular, we also fit the confirmed cases in Wuhan from 24 January to 5 March to illustrate the rationality and effectiveness of our model. The results show that, in the early stage of the outbreak of COVID-19, stopping all the migration of humans, increasing the intensity of treatment, enhancing the awareness of personal protection, and especially increasing the ability to identify asymptomatic infections are indispensable control means to control this disease.","Hu, Lin; Nie, Lin-Fei",Math Methods Appl Sci,420,6

The recent outbreak of COVID-19 has caused a sharp rise in the incidence of pulmonary fibrosis owing to SARS-CoV-2 infection-mediated acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The considerable oxidative damage caused by locally infiltrated immune cells plays a crucial role in ARDS, suggesting the potential use of antioxidative therapeutics. Here, we report the therapeutic potential of nanoparticles derived from the endogenous antioxidant and anti-inflammatory bile acid, bilirubin (BRNPs), in treating pulmonary fibrosis in a bleomycin-induced mouse model of the disease. Our results demonstrate that BRNPs can effectively reduce clinical signs in mice, as shown by histological, disease index evaluations, and detection of biomarkers. Our findings suggest that BRNPs, with their potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects, long blood circulation half-life, and preferential accumulation at the inflamed site, are potentially a viable clinical option for preventing Covid-19 infection-associated pulmonary fibrosis.","Keum, Hyeongseop; Kim, Dohyeon; Kim, Jinjoo; Kim, Tae Woo; Whang, Chang-Hee; Jung, Wonsik; Jon, Sangyong",Biomaterials,420,20

Design/Methodology/Approach: The main study method was the survey method. The subjects were individuals born after 1990 (representatives of Generation Y) in full-time and part-time graduate and undergraduate programmes of the biggest private and state universities of technology and humanities in the Lublin region. The study was anonymous and encompassed a sample of 140 students. The surveys were conducted in the third quarter of 2020, after the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic outbreak. Findings: The respondents would like their future, post-pandemic jobs to be interesting and consistent with their interests and competencies. A job must entail a decent salary that will allow them to live a prosperous life and pursue their hobbies. Good workplace atmosphere and a possibility of work-life balance are more important than promotions and classic career. Many students see opening their own business and self-employment to those ends. Practical Implications: The study results seem to be particularly important in the context of choosing an optimum method for managing young, qualified employees, such as (most likely) the future university graduates who are about to enter the new, reshaped labour market. Defining their expectations towards future jobs will allow employers to make sustainable, optimum and effective use of the potential of this unique generation. Originality/Value: The study was conducted right after the outbreak of the SARS-Cov-2 pandemic, which significantly remodelled the modern economy and labour market in Poland, and thus had a significant impact on the way young people perceive their future work.","Laskowska, Agnieszka Laskowski Jan",European Research Studies,420,16

Current anti-counterfeiting labels have weaknesses: they can either be duplicated easily, are expensive or ill-suited for the existing complex supply chains. While RFID tags provide for an excellent alternative to current anti-counterfeiting methods, they can prove to be expensive and other routes involving nanomaterials can be difficult to encrypt. A DNA based anticounterfeiting system has significant advantages such as relative ease of synthesis and vast data storage abilities, along with great potential in encryption. Although DNA is equipped with such beneficial properties, major challenges that limit its real-world anti-counterfeiting applications include protection in harsh environments, rapid inexpensive sequence determination, and its attachment to products. This review elaborates the current progress of DNA based anti-counterfeiting systems and identifies technological gaps that need to be filled for its practical application.

First, there are questions about which policies are most effective and fair in the here and now, as the pandemic unfolds. These polices concern, for example, who should receive priority in being tested, how to implement contact tracing, or how to decide who should get ventilators or vaccines when not all can. Second, it is imperative to anticipate the medium- and longer-term consequences that these policies have. The case of vaccine rationing is particularly instructive. Ethical, epidemiological, and economic reasons demand that rationing approaches give priority to groups who have been structurally and historically disadvantaged, even if this means that overall life years gained may be lower.","Schmidt, Harald",Hastings Cent. rep,420,16

Many of the factors associated with tumour progression and immune resistance, such as yin yang (YY)1 and glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)3ß, regulate acetyl-CoA and the melatonergic pathway, thereby having significant impacts on the dynamic interactions of the different types of cells present in the tumour microenvironment. The association of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) with immune suppression in the tumour microenvironment may be mediated by the AhR-induced cytochrome P450 (CYP)1b1-driven 'backward' conversion of melatonin to its immediate precursor N-acetylserotonin (NAS). NAS within tumours and released from tumour microenvironment cells activates the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) receptor, TrkB, thereby increasing the survival and proliferation of cancer stem-like cells. Acetyl-CoA is a crucial co-substrate for initiation of the melatonergic pathway, as well as co-ordinating the interactions of OXPHOS and glycolysis in all cells of the tumour microenvironment. This provides a model of the tumour microenvironment that emphasises the roles of acetyl-CoA and the melatonergic pathway in shaping the dynamic intercellular metabolic interactions of the various cells within the tumour microenvironment. The potentiation of YY1 and GSK3ß by O-GlcNAcylation will drive changes in metabolism in tumours and tumour microenvironment cells in association with their regulation of the melatonergic pathway. The emphasis on metabolic interactions across cell types in the tumour microenvironment provides novel future research and treatment directions.","Anderson, George",Int. j. mol. sci. (Online),420,27

Significant studies have been conducted on this pandemic, some of which have addressed understanding the relationship between different air pollutants and confirmed cases. In this study, the effects of four air pollutants (carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, ozone, and sulfur dioxide) were assessed from February 19 to March 22, 2020 to explore how they can affect COVID-19 contagion in Iran. The mean concentrations of air pollutants were extracted from Sentinel 5P data. The COVID-19 confirmed case densities of two provinces, Semnan and Qom, were more than all other provinces. The effect of pollutants on the confirmed case densities was analyzed using multiple linear regression in order to estimate the impact coefficients for individual provinces. The impact coefficients determine the level of each pollutant's contribution to the density of total confirmed cases. Carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and ozone had both considerable negative and positive correlations with the density of confirmed COVID-19 cases, although sulfur dioxide was correlated more negatively than positively.

We seek to systematically review the available evidence regarding the anticoagulation approach to prevent venous thromboembolism (VTE) among COVID-19 patients admitted to intensive care units. Electronic databases were searched for studies reporting venous thromboembolic events in patients admitted to the intensive care unit receiving any type of anticoagulation (prophylactic or therapeutic). The pooled prevalence (and 95% confidence interval [CI]) of VTE among patients receiving anticoagulant were calculated using the random-effects model. Subgroup pooled analyses were performed with studies reported prophylactic anticoagulation alone and with studies reported mixed prophylactic and therapeutic anticoagulation. We included twelve studies (8 Europe; 2 UK; 1 each from the US and China) in our systematic review and meta-analysis. All studies utilized LMWH or unfractionated heparin as their pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis, either prophylactic doses or therapeutic doses. Seven studies reported on the proportion of patients with the previous history of VTE (range 0-10%). The pooled prevalence of VTE among ICU patients receiving prophylactic or therapeutic anticoagulation across all studies was 31% (95% CI 20-43%). Subgroup pooled analysis limited to studies reported prophylactic anticoagulation alone and mixed (therapeutic and prophylactic anticoagulation) reported pooled prevalences of VTE of 38% (95% CI 10-70%) and 27% (95% CI 17-40%) respectively. With a high prevalence of thromboprophylaxis failure among COVID-19 patients admitted to intensive care units, individualised rather than protocolised VTE thromboprophylaxis would appear prudent at interim.","Hasan, Syed Shahzad; Radford, Sam; Kow, Chia Siang; Zaidi, Syed Tabish Razi",J Thromb Thrombolysis,420,1

PNS have the functions of scavenging free radicals, anti-inflammation, improving blood supply for tissue and so on. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of PNS on the oxidative stress of immune cells induced by porcine circovirus 2 (PCV2) infection in vitro and in vivo. METHODS: Using an oxidative stress model of PCV2 infection in a porcine lung cell line (3D4/2 cells) and mice, the levels of nitric oxide (NO), reactive oxygen species (ROS), total glutathione (T-GSH), reduced glutathione (GSH), and oxidized glutathione (GSSG) and the activities of xanthine oxidase (XOD), myeloperoxidase (MPO) and inducible nitric oxide synthetase (iNOS) were determined to evaluate the regulatory effects of PNS on oxidative stress. RESULTS: PNS treatment significantly reduced the levels of NO and ROS, the content of GSSG and the activities of XOD, MPO, and iNOS (p < 0.05), while significantly increasing GSH and the ratio of GSH/GSSG in infected 3D4/2 cells (p < 0.05).Similarly, in the in vivo study, PNS treatment significantly decreased the level of ROS in spleen lymphocytes of infected mice (p < 0.05), increased the levels of GSH and T-GSH (p < 0.05), significantly decreased the GSSG level (p < 0.05), and decreased the activities of XOD, MPO, and iNOS.

Evidence sources, however, often change over time as more information is gathered and revised. In order to adapt, models must be sensitive to subtle differences in supporting evidence. We present VitaminC, a benchmark infused with challenging cases that require fact verification models to discern and adjust to slight factual changes. We collect over 100,000 Wikipedia revisions that modify an underlying fact, and leverage these revisions, together with additional synthetically constructed ones, to create a total of over 400,000 claim-evidence pairs. Unlike previous resources, the examples in VitaminC are contrastive, i.e., they contain evidence pairs that are nearly identical in language and content, with the exception that one supports a given claim while the other does not. We show that training using this design increases robustness -- improving accuracy by 10% on adversarial fact verification and 6% on adversarial natural language inference (NLI). Moreover, the structure of VitaminC leads us to define additional tasks for fact-checking resources: tagging relevant words in the evidence for verifying the claim, identifying factual revisions, and providing automatic edits via factually consistent text generation.","Schuster, Tal; Fisch, Adam; Barzilay, Regina",,420,16

However, it is not known whether specialty-specific recommendations for COVID-19 are followed by allergists. OBJECTIVES: By conducting this study, we aimed to determine the attitudes and experiences of adult/pediatric allergists on allergy management during COVID-19. METHOD: We used a 20-question survey to elicit data from allergists (residents and pediatric and adult allergists registered to the Turkish National Society of Allergy and Clinical Immunology) across Turkey via e-mail. We analyzed the data statistically for frequency distributions and descriptive analysis. RESULTS: A total of 183 allergists participated in the survey. Telemedicine was used for management of asthma (73%), allergic rhinitis (53%), atopic dermatitis (51%), chronic urticaria/angioedema (59%), drug hypersensitivity (45%), food allergy (48%), venom allergy (30%), anaphylaxis (22%), and hereditary angioedema (28%). Thirty-one percent of the respondents discontinued subcutaneous immunotherapy (SCIT) during the COVID-19 pandemic. Thirty-four percent of the physicians reported interruption of systemic steroid use in asthma patients, and 25% of the respondents discontinued biological therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Allergists in Turkey have been using telemedicine at a high rate during the COVID-19 pandemic for asthma and rhinitis. The continuation rate of SCIT was low while the discontinuation rate of biologicals and systemic steroid use in asthma was high in Turkey.Our study results and learning from the experiences of other countries and specialties may help to optimize allergy practice and compatibility with international guidelines.","Ozturk, Ayse Bilge; Baççioglu, Ayse; Soyer, Ozge; Civelek, Ersoy; Sekerel, Bülent Enis; Bavbek, Sevim",Int Arch Allergy Immunol,420,24

RESULTS: A total of 101 IM residents participated in the study (out of N=162). Of the 101 samples, three (2.9%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. No residents tested PCR positive for SARS-CoV-2. DISCUSSION: The implementation of COVID-19 patient cohorting and the incorporation of telemedicine to communicate with hospitalized patients into clinical practice early in the pandemic may have prevented the spread of the virus among the surveyed clinical trainees. CONCLUSION: Despite significant engagement with COVID-19 patients, IM residents demonstrated a low rate of SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence.","Murphy, M.; Li, W. S.; Gentilesco, B.; Toma, E.; Napoleon, S.

The callers' characteristic could help us to study their experiences of emotional distress, as well as the reasons for calling during the pandemic, which can be used to inform future service design and delivery. METHODS: The information of 1558 callers called our hospital' s hotline for help from February 3, 2020, to March 16, 2020 were collected in the form of Tick-box and Free text, and the inductive content analysis was undertaken focusing on the reasons for caller engagement. RESULTS: It was indicated that more than half of the callers are female (59.7%), mostly between the age of 18-59 (76.5%). The average age was 37.13 ± 13.76 years old. The average duration of a call to the hotline was 10.03 ± 9.84 min. The most frequent description emotional state were anxious (45.1%) and calm (30.3%), with the sub-sequence of scared (18.2%), sad (11.9%), and angry (6.9%). All callers displayed a wide range of reasons for calling, with needing support around their emotion (64.6%), seeking practical help (44.0%), and sleep problems (20.3%) constituting the majority of calls.

METHODS: To retrieve the vitamin D levels data, the authors analyzed the vitamin D European population data compiled by 2019 European Calcified Tissue Society (ECTS) statement on vitamin D status published in the European Journal of Endocrinology. For the data set to be used for analysis, only recently published data that included general adult population of both genders aged 40-65 years or wider and must have included the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency. RESULTS: There were data sets from 10 countries that fitted the criteria and were analyzed. Severe vitamin D deficiency was defined as 25(OH)D less than 25â¯nmol/L (10â¯ng/dL). Pearson correlation analysis between death rate per million of population from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and prevalence of severe vitamin D deficiency showed a strong correlation with râ¯= 0.79, pâ¯= 0.007. Over time, correlation strengthened, and r coefficient asymptotically increased. After adjusting for countries' age structure and per capita health expenditures, multiple linear regression analysis showed that higher prevalence of severe vitamin D deficiency is associated with increased mortality.

The greatest impact that COVID-19 had was on intensive care units (ICUs), given that approximately 20% of hospitalized cases developed acute respiratory failure (ARF) requiring ICU admission. Based on the assumption that COVID-19 represented a viral pneumonia and no anti-coronaviral therapy existed, nearly all national and international health care societies' recommended ""supportive care only"" avoiding other therapies outside of randomized controlled trials, with a specific prohibition against the use of corticosteroids in treatment. However, early studies of COVID-19-associated ARF reported inexplicably high mortality rates, with frequent prolonged durations of mechanical ventilation (MV), even from centers expert in such supportive care strategies. These reports led the authors to form a clinical expert panel called the Front-Line COVID-19 Critical Care Alliance (www.flccc.net). The panel collaboratively reviewed the emerging clinical, radiographic, and pathological reports of COVID-19 while initiating multiple discussions among a wide clinical network of front-line clinical ICU experts from initial outbreak areas in China, Italy, and New York.

Images depicting individuals alone, in small groups (up to four people), and in large groups (more than seven people) were rated in terms of valence, arousal, and perceived physical distance. Pre-pandemic normative ratings were obtained from a validated database (OASIS). Several self-report measures were also taken, and condensed into four factors through factor analysis. All images were rated as more arousing compared to the pre-pandemic period, and the greater the decrease in real-life physical interactions reported by participants, the higher the ratings of arousal. As expected, only images depicting large gatherings of people were rated less positively during, compared to before, the pandemic. These ratings of valence were, however, moderated by a factor that included participants' number of days in isolation, relationship closeness, and perceived COVID-19 threat. Higher scores on this factor were associated with more positive ratings of images of individuals alone and in small groups, suggesting an increased appreciation of safer social situations, such as intimate and small-group contacts. The same factor was inversely related to the perceived physical distance between individuals in images of small and large groups, suggesting an impact of lockdown measures and contagion-related worries on the representation of interpersonal space. These findings point to rapid and compelling psychological and social consequences of the lockdown measures imposed during the COVID-19 pandemic on the perception of social groups. Further studies should assess the long-term impact of such events as typical everyday life is restored.","Massaccesi, C.; Chiappini, E.; Paracampo, R.; Korb, S.",Frontiers in Psychology,420,30

In this study, we built a virus-drug dataset, which included 34 viruses, 210 drugs, and 437 confirmed related virus-drug pairs from existing literature. Besides, we developed an Indicator Regularized non-negative Matrix Factorization (IRNMF) method, which introduced the indicator matrix and Karush-Kuhn-Tucker condition into the non-negative matrix factorization algorithm. According to the 5-fold cross-validation on the virus-drug dataset, the performance of IRNMF was better than other methods, and its Area Under receiver operating characteristic Curve (AUC) value was 0.8127.

Yet, there is less information on how different groups respond to the pandemic in terms of compliance with the measures implemented by the government, and the role that parenthood and employment play in explaining compliance for such groups. We take insights from the literature on policy preferences and compliance to argue that gender, ethnicity, parenthood and employment are associated with high levels of worry about the consequences of the pandemic, leading to variations in compliance with social distancing measures. We test our argument using data from an original nationally representative survey. Results indicate that women and BAME respondents present important challenges to manage anxiety, stress and worry but they manifest differently in their compliance with social distancing measures. We also find that parenthood and employment affect compliance but in an unexpected direction. Together, results indicate that compliance is not only a matter of individual choice but also a matter of structural and contextual factors.

However, its realization currently relies on various sophisticated fabrication approaches such as lithography or direct printing on a carrier substrate before attaching to the body. Here we report a universal fabrication scheme to enable printing and room-temperature sintering of metal nanoparticle on paper/fabric for FPCBs and directly on the human skin for on-body sensors with a novel coating layer. Consisting of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) paste and nanoparticle additives in the water, the novel coating layer reduces the sintering temperature. Together with the significantly decreased surface roughness, it allows for the integration of a submicron-thick conductive pattern with enhanced electromechanical performance. Various on-body sensors integrated with an FPCB to detect health conditions illustrate a system-level example.","Zhang, Ling; Ji, Hongjun; Huang, Houbing; Yi, Ning; Shi, Xiaoming; Xie, Senpei; Li, Yaoyin; Ye, Ziheng; Feng, Pengdong; Lin, Tiesong; Liu, Xiangli; Leng, Xuesong; Li, Mingyu; Zhang, Jiaheng; Ma, Xing; He, Peng; Zhao, Weiwei; Cheng, Huanyu",ACS appl. mater. interfaces (Online),420,14

SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Medical records of subjects with BDs admitted to a psychiatric inpatient unit over a 5-year period of time were retrospectively reviewed and clinical data were extracted into an electronic dataset. ""Revolving Door Subjects"" (RDS) were defined as those who presented three or more ""Revolving Door Hospitalizations"" (RDH) during twelve months. Features of RDH were compared with non-RDH in order to identify characteristics associated with RD phenomenon and possible risk factors for readmission. To explore predictors of RDH, a stepwise backword logistic regression model was built, including the variables that were significantly associated with RDH in the bivariate analyses. RESULTS: In our sample of 176 subjects affected by BDs, 53 (19.9%) RDH were identified. In the RDH group, a higher prevalence of mixed episodes (p=0.029) and medical co-morbidities (p=0.004) was detected. Subjects with repeated hospitalizations were more often committed to psychiatric residential facilities at discharge (p=0.002). Treatment features related to RDH were represented by a higher prescription rate of atypical antipsychotics (p=0.030), benzodiazepines (p=0.001) and antidepressants (p=0.048). CONCLUSIONS: Findings from the present study suggest that the early identification and treatment of medical comorbidities and specific clinical features of BDs may help reducing the RD phenomenon in this population of subjects.","Menculini, Giulia; Gobbicchi, Chiara; Verdolini, Norma; Cirimbilli, Federica; Moretti, Patrizia; Tortorella, Alfonso",Psychiatr Danub,420,5

The secondary objective was to define the priority to be assigned to each principle. SETTING: The study was conducted from March to June 2020 within the context of an ethical committee (EC) in Northern Italy. PARTICIPANTS: Eleven EC members and five additional external healthcare and bioethical professionals, forming a multidisciplinary panel, took part in the study. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: The compilation of a list of ethical principles (maximum of 10 items) and their priority ranking and application within an emergency pandemic context was established as the expected outcome of this work. RESULTS: A consensus on 10 guiding ethical principles was reached by the multidisciplinary panel. Transparency ranked first on the priority list as the most frequently voted principle, followed by the number of lives saved, life-years saved, respect for individuals' autonomy and equity. Other principles including life cycle, 'sickest first', reciprocity, instrumental value and lottery were also considered appropriate as potential tiebreakers. These principles were discussed and made consistent with the current Italian pandemic context by producing an explanatory document. CONCLUSIONS: The identified principles could be used in preparedness plans to guide resource allocation during pandemic events. By combining their rank and relevance in relation to disease, health system organisations, social and economic settings, and critical resources at risk of scarcity, these principles could help to maximise the benefit of resource use for the community, thus reducing inequalities for individuals.","Zeneli, Anita; Brandi, Giovanni; Di Pasquale, Giuseppe; Orlandini, Danilo; De Carolis, Piero; Bravi, Francesca; Pugliese, Francesco; Poluzzi, Elisabetta; Catena, Fausto; Giovanardi, Filippo; Valpiani, Giorgia; Mantovani, Renato; Magnanimi, Eugenia; Iannone, Primiano",BMJ Open,420,20

For the first time, the results of our study suggested that vaccination with BCG may increase the risk for COVID-19 at certain age, particularly in individuals vaccinated at childhood. Childhood BCG vaccination increased the likelihood of being diagnosed with COVID-19 fivefold in COVID-19 low-incidence countries and threefold in high-incidence countries. A reasonable explanation for this effect is the activation of certain innate immunity mechanisms associated with inflammatory reactions.

The illness caused by SARS COV-2 is referred to as the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). It is a highly contagious disease that has resulted in a global pandemic. The clinical spectrum of COVID-19 ranges from asymptomatic illness to acute respiratory distress syndrome, septic shock, multi-organ dysfunction, and death. The most common symptoms include fever, fatigue, dry cough, dyspnea, and diarrhea. Neurological manifestations have also been reported. However, the data on the association of Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) with COVID-19 are scarce. We report a rare case of a COVID-19-positive 36-year-old immunocompromised male who presented with clinical features of GBS. His clinical examination showed generalized weakness and hyporeflexia. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis showed albuminocytological dissociation. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) was administered based on the high clinical suspicion of GBS. The patient's neurological condition worsened with progression to bulbar weakness and ultimately neuromuscular respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation. His nerve conduction studies were consistent with demyelinating polyneuropathy. He received five plasma exchange treatments and was successfully weaned from mechanical ventilation. A brain and cervical spine magnetic resonance imaging was obtained to rule out other causes, which was normal. COVID-19 is believed to cause a dysregulated immune system, which likely plays an important role in the neuropathogenesis of GBS.","Rajdev, Kartikeya; Victor, Navin; Buckholtz, Elaine S; Hariharan, Praveen; Saeed, Muhammad Ahsan; Hershberger, Daniel M; Bista, Sabin",J Investig Med High Impact Case Rep,420,16

Cleaning (e.g., cleaning surfaces, washing and sanitizing hands) and containing (e.g., covering coughs, keeping distance from others, especially sick people) behaviors are recommended. PURPOSE: To develop the Clean and Contain Measure, a brief measure of compliance with CDC recommendations for prevention of infectious disease, and validate the measure in individuals experiencing the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Participants were recruited from Amazon Mechanical Turk and social media. RESULTS: In Study 1 (N = 97), exploratory factor analysis revealed two scales: (a) five items assessing cleaning behaviors and (b) four items assessing containing behaviors. Simple structure was obtained and alpha coefficients for both scales were >.83. In Studies 2 (N = 204) and 3 (N = 527), confirmatory factor analysis verified the identical factor structure found in Study 1. All loadings were statistically significant at p < .001. Alpha coefficients for both scales were >.84 for Studies 2 and 3. CONCLUSIONS: Our measure is a reliable and valid indicator of compliance with cleaning and containing health behaviors that help to prevent the spread of diseases like COVID-19.

Recent advances address the implications of CAI with respect to privacy, safety, security, and access. However, there is a need to connect and embed the ethical and technical aspects in the design. Using a case-study of a research and development project focused on the use of CAI in storytelling for children, this paper reflects on the social context within a specific case of technology development, as substantiated and supported by argumentation from within the literature. It describes the decision making process behind the recommendations made on this case for their adoption in the creative industries. Further research that engages with developers and stakeholders in the ethics of storytelling through CAI is highlighted as a matter of urgency.","Chubba, ennifer; Missaouib, Sondess; Concannonc, Shauna; Maloneyb, Liam; Walker, James Alfred",,420,16

A large number of inbound travelers from other regions could lead to a renewed outbreak of COVID-19 in the local regions. Globally, as a result of the imbalance in the control of the epidemic, all countries are facing the risk of a renewed COVID-19 outbreak brought about by travelers from epidemic areas. Therefore, studies on a proper management of the inbound travelers are urgent. Methods: We collected a total of 4,733,414 inbound travelers and 174 COVID-19 diagnosed patients in Yunnan province from 21 January 2020 to 20 February 2020. Data on place of origin, travel history, age, and gender, as well as whether they had suspected clinical manifestations for inbound travelers in Yunnan were collected. The impact of inbound travelers on the local epidemic was analyzed with a collinear statistical analysis and the effect of the control measures on the epidemic was evaluated with a sophisticated modeling approach. Results: Of the 174 COVID-19 patients, 60.9% were not from Yunnan, and 76.4% had a history of travel in Hubei. The amount of new daily cases in Yunnan was significant correlated with the number of inbound travelers from Hubei and suspected cases among them. Using Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) model analysis, we found that the prevention and control measures dropped the local R0 down to 1.07 in Yunnan province. Conclusions: Our preliminary analysis showed that the proper management of inbound travelers from outbreak areas has a significantly positive effect on the prevention and control of the virus. In the process of resettlement, some effective measures taken by Yunnan province may provide an important reference for preventing the renewed COVID-19 outbreak in other regions.","Sun, Zhong; He, Guozhong; Huang, Ninghao; Chen, Hongyu; Zhang, Shuwei; Zhao, Zizhao; Zhao, Yao; Yang, Guang; Yang, Songwang; Xiong, Haiyan; Karuppiah, Thilakavathy; Kumar, S Suresh; He, Jibo; Xiong, Chenglong",Front Public Health,420,30

METHOD: Adjusted relative risks/hazard ratios were calculated for the associations between BMI category (underweight, normal-weight, overweight, class 1 obesity, class 2 obesity, and class 3 obesity) and testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 or experiencing hospitalization, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, mechanical ventilation, and death among those testing positive. RESULTS: Higher BMI categories were associated with higher risk of a positive SARS-CoV-2 test compared to the normal-weight category (class 3 obesity adjusted relative risk 1.34, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.28-1.42). Among 25,952 SARS-CoV-2-positive patients, class 3 obesity was associated with higher risk of mechanical ventilation (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 1.77, 95%CI 1.35-2.32) and mortality (aHR 1.42, 95%CI 1.12-1.78) compared to normal-weight individuals. These associations were present primarily in patients <65 and were attenuated or absent in older age groups (interaction p<0.05). CONCLUSION: VA enrollees with higher BMI were more likely to test positive for SARS-CoV-2 and were more likely to be mechanically ventilated or die if SARS-CoV-2-infected. Higher BMIs contributed relatively more to the risk of death in those <65 years of age as compared to other age categories.","Eastment, McKenna C; Berry, Kristin; Locke, Emily; Green, Pamela; O039,; Hare, Ann; Crothers, Kristina; Dominitz, Jason; Fan, Vincent S; Shah, Javeed A; Ioannou, George N",Obesity (Silver Spring),420,26

Pregnant women already exhibit an elevated risk for depression compared to the general public, a pattern expected to be exacerbated by the pandemic. Certain lifestyle factors, including moderate exercise, may help support mental health during pregnancy, but it is unclear how the pandemic may impact these associations across different locations. Here, we test whether: (i) reported exercise routine alterations during the pandemic are associated with depression scores; and, (ii) the likelihood of reporting pandemic-related exercise changes varies between women living in metro areas and those in non-metro areas. METHODS: This cross-sectional study used data from the COVID-19 And Reproductive Effects (CARE) study, an online survey of pregnant women in the United States. Participants were recruited April-June 2020 (n = 1,856). Linear regression analyses assessed whether reported COVID-19-related exercise change was associated with depression score as measured by the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Survey. Logistic regression analyses tested whether a participant's Rural-Urban Continuum Code classification of ""metro"" was linked with higher odds of reporting exercise changes compared to a ""non-metro"" classification. RESULTS: Women who reported exercise changes during the pandemic exhibited significantly higher depression scores compared to those reporting no changes. Moreover, individuals living in metro areas of all sizes were significantly more likely to report exercise changes compared to women living in non-metro areas. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the ability to maintain an exercise routine during the pandemic may help support maternal mental health. It may therefore be prudent for providers to explicitly ask patients how the pandemic has impacted their exercise routines and consider altered exercise routines a potential risk factor for depression. An effort should also be made to recommend exercises that are tailored to individual space restrictions and physical health.","Gildner, Theresa E; Laugier, Elise J; Thayer, Zaneta M",PLoS One,420,21

A case report of COVID-19,16.658453,6.5274925,2020,"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to assess the value of systematic screening in asymptomatic women admitted for spontaneous delivery with a combination of reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and cycle threshold (Ct) and serum antibodies. METHODS: Since May 6 all women admitted for spontaneous delivery underwent RT-PCR in nasopharyngeal swabs and specific antibodies IgG of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in serum that were performed as part of routine clinical care in our institution. Ct of the PCR was recorded. We analyzed the first 100 women consecutively admitted for spontaneous delivery at our institution. RESULTS: Nine women were positive for SARS-CoV-2 in nasopharyngeal samples (9%) and 13 (13%) presented positive specific antibodies of the coronavirus. Overall, SARS-CoV-2 prior exposure was 15%. The Ct determination (RT-PCR test) of our 9 positive patients ranged from 36 to 41 cycles with a median of 40. Vaginal delivery occurred in 94% of the cases and only 6% underwent a cesarean section, always for obstetric reasons. No fetal transmission was observed and maternal and neonatal prognosis was excellent. CONCLUSIONS: During epidemic episodes in asymptomatic women in labor, universal testing with RT-PCR (considering Ct determination), and the detection of antibodies, permits a better interpretation of the results and avoid unnecessary isolation procedures.","Viñuela, M C; De León-Luis, J A; Alonso, R; Catalán, P; Lizarraga, S; Muñoz, P; Bouza, E",Rev. esp. quimioter,420,16

METHODS: This study follows a systematic mapping review approach which does not make a judgement on the quality of the papers included in the review, thereby enabling a complete overview of the field. RESULTS: Of 4481 publications retrieved, 386 met the eligibility criteria for this study. These publications covered a wide range of conditions, but the majority were based on one or only a small number of neurological conditions. In particular, publications concerned with three discrete areas of neurological practice - multiple sclerosis (MS), epilepsy/seizure and Parkinson's disease - accounted for 60% of the total. MS was the focus of the highest proportion of eligible studies (35%), yet in the recent Global Burden of Neurological Disease study it ranks only 14th out of 15 neurological disorders for DALY rates. In contrast, migraine is the neurological disorder with the highest ranking of DALYs globally (after stroke) and yet it was represented by only 4% of eligible studies. CONCLUSION: This review shows that there is a disproportionately large body of literature pertaining to relatively rare disorders, and a correspondingly small body of literature describing more common conditions.

Therefore, prevention to be infected through social distancing and isolation is the most effective way. However, all the other physical and mental illnesses continue to exist, if possible even more burdened by the emergency situation and social distancing. The COVID-19 pandemic, especially in many low- and middle-income countries, has caused a deeper gap in seeking psychiatric help. In this scenario, telepsychiatry could play a decisive role in implementing clinical care for frail patients and ensuring continuous mental care. Therefore, we felt the urge to write this article to express our hope that the old health care system at this time of crisis, as we know it, can offer the chance to implement pervasive care technologies that perfectly fit current psychiatric needs.","Diwan, Mufaddal Najmuddin; Ali Awan, Hashir; Aamir, Alifiya; de Filippis, Renato; Ullah, Irfan",J Nerv Ment Dis,420,20

A number of reviews have summarized the validity and reliability of well-being and mental health measures for children but there are fewer attempts to consider utility for routine use. METHOD: This review considers four child self-report measures: the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), the Revised Child Anxiety and Depression Scale (RCADS), (Child) Outcomes Rating Scale (C/ORS) and Goals Based Outcomes (GBOs). It explores the strengths and limitations of each and considers how they can be used to support both clinical practice and service evaluation. RESULTS: There is evidence for the clinical utility of RCADS, C/ORS and GBOs, although the utility of the SDQ as a feedback measure remains unclear. For service evaluation, the SDQ has the greatest evidence for norms making it useful for comparison and there is evidence that the RCADS may be the most sensitive to change of the measures reviewed; C/ORS has issues around ceiling effect, data error and data manipulation. More research is required around GBOs before their use for service evaluation can be determined. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, these different measures may be viewed as complementary tools and determining the best way to make use of them severally and individually in clinical and community settings is a current focus for child mental health practitioners.","Wolpert, Miranda; Cheng, Helen; Deighton, Jessica",Child Adolesc Ment Health,420,29

These changes may be related to the number of new COVID-19 cases per day since they are visual indicators of the changes in the epidemic and are of interest to the public. This descriptive research took the spine surgery department as an example in a Grade-A tertiary hospital in Anhui province, China. The number and distribution of patients from January 24 to April 2, 2020 was collected and compared with the past 5 years. A psychological scale was constructed to assess the psychological distress of patients and the number of new COVID-19 cases per day in Anhui, China was collected each day from January 24 to April 2, 2020. Also, this research compared these variables with the emergency response or the number of new COVID-19 cases per day. All distributions dropped dramatically during first-level emergency response and then back to normal. The psychological distress of patients was relatively higher at the beginning of the outbreak and then gradually returned to normal. The trends between the psychological distress of patients and the number of new COVID-19 cases per day were similar. The number of new COVID-19 cases per day could be used to predict psychological distress, changes in patient numbers and distributions, which was beneficial for the department of spine surgery to adjust its treatment strategy during the epidemic.","Zheng, Yongshun; Zhang, Xingfang; Fang, Shiyuan; Zhang, Fan",Sci Prog,420,7

As COVID-19 spread in the United States, this study therefore aimed to examine age differences in risk perceptions, anxiety and depression. METHOD: In March 2020, a nationally representative address-based sample of 6666 US adults assessed their perceived risk of getting COVID-19, dying if getting it, getting quarantined, losing their job (if currently working), and running out of money. They completed a mental health assessment for anxiety and depression. Demographic variables and pre-crisis depression diagnosis had previously been reported. RESULTS: In regression analyses controlling for demographic variables and survey date, older adult age was associated with perceiving larger risks of dying if getting COVID-19, but with perceiving less risk of getting COVID-19, getting quarantined, or running out of money, as well as less depression and anxiety. Findings held after additionally controlling for pre-crisis reports of depression diagnosis. DISCUSSION: With the exception of perceived infection-fatality risk, US adults who were relatively older appeared to have a more optimistic outlook and better mental health during the early stages of the pandemic. Interventions may be needed to help people of all ages maintain realistic perceptions of the risks, while also managing depression and anxiety during the COVID-19 crisis.

Here we investigated the potential of using pooling of samples followed by one-step retrotranscription and quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) to increase SARS-CoV-2 testing capacity. METHODS: We first evaluated different sample pooling (1:5, 1:10 and 1:15) prior to RNA extractions followed by standard RT-qPCR for SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 diagnosis. The pool size achieving reproducible results in independent tests was then used for assessing nasopharyngeal samples in a tertiary hospital during August 2020. RESULTS: We found that pool size of five samples achieved the highest sensitivity compared to pool sizes of 10 and 15, showing a mean (± SD) Ct shift of 3.5 ± 2.2 between the pooled test and positive samples in the pool. We then used a pool size of five to test a total of 895 pools (4,475 prospective samples) using two different RT-qPCR kits available at that time. The Real Accurate Quadruplex corona-plus PCR Kit (PathoFinder) reported the lowest mean Ct (± SD) shift (2.2 ± 2.4) among the pool and the individual samples. The strategy allows detecting individual samples in the positive pools with Cts in the range of 16.7-39.4. CONCLUSIONS: We found that pools of five samples combined with RT-qPCR solutions helped to increase SARS-CoV-2 testing capacity with minimal loss of sensitivity compared to that resulting from testing the samples independently.","Alcoba-Florez, Julia; Gil-Campesino, Helena; García-Martínez de Artola, Diego; Díez-Gil, Oscar; Valenzuela-Fernández, Agustín; González-Montelongo, Rafaela; Ciuffreda, Laura; Flores, Carlos",Int. j. infect. dis,420,29

In the past 20 years, this is the third coronavirus that jumped the species barrier and infected humans. It is highly contagious but associated with low pathogenicity. First identified in Wuhan, China, a city of over 11 million, the disease has since spread to every continent except Antarctica. About 15% to 20% of all cases may be called severe, and it is believed many cases are asymptomatic. The average age of a person with COVID has been reported as 49 years. Worse outcomes are associated with geriatric populations and those with un-derlying diseases such as cardiovascular, respiratory disorders, and/or diabetes. The coronavirus, like other coronaviruses, is highly contagious and has a latency period of about 14 days. Most patients present with fever and a dry cough, but fever may be absent. Differential diagnosis can be challenging since influenza may present with similar symptoms. Chest radiography or computed to-mography may be used to find evidence of secondary pneumonia. Nosocomial infection is of concern, and it has been reported that 3.8% of all cases with COVID-19 in that country involve healthcare workers in China. Most patients have mild disease, and supportive care suffices. A variety of repurposed and investigational drugs are being evaluated.

However, there is great worry about the impact of pesticides on human health, due to their wide distribution and possible long-term effects. Complex mixtures with different formulations are often used, including a variety of genotoxic compounds. Thus, genotoxicity tests form an important part of cancer research and risk assessment of potential carcinogens. This study aimed to conduct a meta-analytical review of possible genetic damage resulting from occupational exposure in farmworkers and workers employed in pesticide production, both ever in comparison to non-exposed people, using comet assay (CA), micronucleus test (MN) and telomere length (TL) data available in the scientific literature. A total of 145 datasets were evaluated. The results showed that the occupationally exposed workers had more DNA damage in CA and MN than non-exposed workers. The TL result did not show difference between groups. When the data were categorized by gender (male, female or both), crop (general, tobacco, fruits, soybeans, cotton) and occupation (manufacturing or farmworkers), the study found that the exposed group always presented higher damage than the non-exposed individuals, in CA and MN. More studies with TL are needed to obtain a more precise response, and to segregate the effect of tobacco farming from pesticide exposure. When TL was segregated by gender, women and men presented difference between exposed and non-exposed groups. In general, the publication bias impact was modest. If all relevant studies were included, the key finding (i.e. the effect of pesticide exposure increases the genotoxicity and mutation rate) would probably remain unchanged. Lastly, it is important to highlight the importance of the use of personal protective equipment (PPE), and offer safer options to farmworkers (e.g. organic farming or less toxic alternatives).","Silva Pinto, Bruna Gabriele; Marques Soares, Tábatta Kim; Azevedo Linhares, Maristela; Castilhos Ghisi, Nédia",Sci Total Environ,420,24

In the current study, we examined whether tasks requiring overlapping processing resources may impair the ability to selectively encode information in dual-task conditions. Participants in the divided-attention conditions of Experiment 1 completed auditory tone-distractor tasks that required them to discriminate between tones of different pitches (audio-nonspatial) or auditory channels (audio-spatial), while studying items in different locations in a grid (visual-spatial) differing in reward value. Results indicated that, while reducing overall memory accuracy, neither cross-modal auditory distractor task influenced participants' ability to selectively encode high-value items relative to a full attention condition, suggesting maintained cognitive control. Participants in Experiment 2 studied the same important visual-spatial information while completing demanding color (visual-nonspatial) or pattern (visual-spatial) discrimination tasks during study. While the cross-modal visual-nonspatial task did not influence memory selectivity, the intra-modal visual-spatial secondary task eliminated participants' sensitivity to item value. These results add novel evidence of conditions of impaired cognitive control, suggesting that the effectiveness of top-down, selective encoding processes is attenuated when concurrent tasks rely on overlapping processing resources.","Siegel, Alexander L M; Schwartz, Shawn T; Castel, Alan D",Mem. cogn,420,20

The 2020–2021 influenza season is predicted to be further impacted by COVID-19 infections. Historical data reflect disproportionate morbidity and mortality rates in the Hispanic population for influenza and COVID-19. Influenza vaccination rates remain low in the Hispanic community. We aim to improve vaccination through a community-led event, partnering with the Cristo Rey School Dallas, located in a zip code with a higher age-adjusted influenza/pneumonia mortality rate. A survey was administered to adults attending the Influenza vaccine event to understand attitudes and perceptions about influenza, vaccination, and effective messaging strategies for the campaign. Methods: Messaging was cocreated with student health ambassadors to promote immunization and delivered through trusted sources. The health department administered vaccines to individuals &gt;age 3 at no cost. Adults were asked to complete a 19-question survey postvaccination offered in both English and Spanish. Results: Two hundred and forty-one of 394 (61.2%) participants completed the survey. Ninety-eight percent identified as Hispanic/Latino, and the majority of surveys were administered in Spanish. Among Spanish language participants, the church bulletins (57.3%) and Spanish language radio (30.5%) were reported to be most effective modes of messaging versus word of mouth (32.9%) and social media (26.3%) for English-speaking participants. Sixteen percent of participants surveyed had never received an influenza vaccine before this event. Conclusion: Cocreated messaging delivered by trusted sources in the Hispanic community led to a successful Influenza vaccine drive with the Dallas County health department.","Long, Apple Mathew Sheryl Alvarez Kristin S.; Smartt, Jillian Shah Monal Madden Christopher Perl Trish M.; Cerise, Fred P.; Bhavan, Kavita P.",Health Equity,420,20

METHODS: A total of 528 patients from cancer centres of four hospitals were enrolled in this cross-sectional study. All patients were divided into cachexia and non-cachexia according to international consensus definition of cachexia. Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) and Quality of Life Questionnaire-Cancer 30 (QLQ-C30) were used to evaluate depression, anxiety and QoL. RESULTS: 285 patients (53.98%) were classified as cachexia. The prevalence of depression, anxiety, severe depression and severe anxiety in cachexia was 30.2%, 18.6%, 6.7% and 8.4%, respectively, which were significantly higher than in non-cachexia (all p<0.01). Patients with cachexia obviously acquired poorer physical function (PF), role function (RF), cognitive function (CF), emotional function (EF), social function (SF) and overall QoL than non-cachexia patients (all p<0.01). Cachexia was positively associated with depression (unstandardised coefficient (B)=2.123, p<0.001) and anxiety (B=1.123, p=0.024), and had a negative relationship with PF, CF, EF, SF and overall QoL (all B<0, all p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Cachexia was associated with greater depression and anxiety and poorer QoL in patients with cancer, which emphasised the importance of timely identification and management of cachexia to improve the psychological problems and QoL among patients with cancer.","Sun, Huihui; Sudip, Thapa; Fu, Xiaofen; Wen, Su; Liu, Huiquan; Yu, Shiying",BMJ support. palliat. care (Online),420,18

Antibody tests enable detection of individuals past the initial phase of infection and help examine vaccine responses. The major targets of human antibody response in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are the spike glycoprotein (SP) and nucleocapsid protein (NP). We have developed a rapid homogenous approach for antibody detection termed LFRET (protein L-based time-resolved Förster resonance energy transfer immunoassay). In LFRET, fluorophore-labeled protein L and antigen are brought to close proximity by antigen-specific patient immunoglobulins of any isotype, resulting in TR-FRET signal. We set up LFRET assays for antibodies against SP and NP and evaluated their diagnostic performance using a panel of 77 serum/plasma samples from 44 individuals with COVID-19 and 52 negative controls. Moreover, using a previously described SP and a novel NP construct, we set up enzyme linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) for antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 SP and NP. We then compared the LFRET assays with these ELISAs and with a SARS-CoV-2 microneutralization test (MNT). We found the LFRET assays to parallel ELISAs in sensitivity (90-95% vs. 90-100%) and specificity (100% vs. 94-100%). In identifying individuals with or without a detectable neutralizing antibody response, LFRET outperformed ELISA in specificity (91-96% vs. 82-87%), while demonstrating an equal sensitivity (98%). In conclusion, this study demonstrates the applicability of LFRET, a 10-min ""mix and read"" assay, to detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.","Rusanen, Juuso; Kareinen, Lauri; Levanov, Lev; Mero, Sointu; Pakkanen, Sari H; Kantele, Anu; Amanat, Fatima; Krammer, Florian; Hedman, Klaus; Vapalahti, Olli; Hepojoki, Jussi",Viruses,420,21

The high fatality rate associated with coronavirus infection underlines the urgent need for an effective treatment to reduce disease severity and mortality. AREAS COVERED: A detailed search for treatments related to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV2) was carried out using PubMed. Components of the virus relevant to the infectious mechanism were identified. We have highlighted all the latest emerging and repurposed drugs that were found to be active against this novel coronavirus and classified these drugs according to their category. Different drug targets are discussed in order to identify new molecules or new combinations as candidates to manage SARS-CoV2/COVID-19 infections. EXPERT OPINION: The development of novel molecules and vaccines has been a challenge during this urgent crisis. Nucleoside analogs and IL-6 receptor antagonists have been identified as the best candidates for treatment of this disease. Multi-drug therapy by targeting different pathways will need to be corroborated and then confirmed through clinical trials. Until a vaccine is available, an alternative drug regimen needs to be adopted by clinicians in the management of coronavirus symptoms.","Debnath, Sujit Kumar; Srivastava, Rohit; Omri, Abdelwahab",Expert Opin Emerg Drugs,420,16

We examine downstream effects on mental health, how effects vary by race and ethnicity, and the role of existing state-level social policies in softening the pandemic's impact. METHODS: We analyze an online, multi-wave Census Bureau survey fielded to nearly a million respondents between late April and July 2020. The survey includes questions measuring psychological distress as well as indirect measures of experience with the pandemic. We combine these data with state-level measures of COVID cases, lock-down orders, unemployment filings, and safety net policy. FINDINGS: We find significant mental stress among all respondents and a sizeable gap between non-white and white respondents. Adjusting for pandemic experiences eliminates this gap. The effect of losing work due to the pandemic is slightly offset by state policies such as unemployment benefit size and Medicaid expansion. The magnitude of these offsetting effects is similar across racial/ethnic groups. CONCLUSIONS: The racialized impacts of the pandemic are exacerbated by inequalities in state policy exemplifying structural racism.

The HCP serves as the first line of defense against this pandemic, what if we faced a significant loss in their number? And what if our HCP was going through a deep dark depression? The condition would be terrifying not only for now but also in the future. This raises the need for an intensified International collaboration, that mainly supports the HCP. We are throwing by challenging moments, and it is clear that social distancing, cooperation, hygiene awareness and abide by the recommendation and help of all governments, as well as obtaining the support of international organizations could be an excellent tool for preventing an increase in the number of cases, principally in countries and regions were COVID-19 is in the early stage of the epidemic. However, this is not the final solution for the current pandemic. An intensified global program, which mainly supports the HCP, then considers the other aspects of the COVID19 pandemic might bring this pandemic to a peaceful end.","Mohamed, Kawthar; Rezaei, Nima; Rodríguez-Román, Eduardo; Rahmani, Farzaneh; Zhang, Hongbo; Ivanovska, Mariya; A Makka, Sara; Joya, Musa; Makuku, Rangarirai; Goda, Rayan; Zoghi, Samaneh; Irtsyan, Sevan; Ling, Irene; Attig-Bahar, Faten; Hazar Sayar, Esra; Soloukey, Chagajeg",Acta Biomed,420,20

No definitive medical treatment or vaccine is available to date. Health professionals all over the world now show a great example of virtue. The purpose of our questionnaire is to evaluate the awareness of the doctor, nurse and technical team working at the Kastamonu Education and Research Hospital about Covid -19 disease. Material and Method: An online questionnaire was applied to 182 people working in Kastamonu Education and Research Hospital. Our survey was divided into two sections: one-part consisted of 4 questions examining the participant characteristics, and the second part consisted of 11 questions examining COVID -19 disease awareness. While examining awareness of COVID-19 disease, the participants' information sources, ways of transmission of the disease, symptoms, diagnostic methods, isolation time, risks, vaccines, drugs and prevention pathways were used in responses to general information questions. Results: Doctors, nurses and technical staff responded in a similar way to the awareness survey questions regarding general information about COVID-19 disease. We conclude that the most effective sources of learning about COVID-19 disease for the participants are social media and government guides. Discussion: COVID-19 is a disease that is still unknown in the world, but health workers are learning about this disease from their own experience and reviews. As a result of our survey, we can say that healthcare professionals are wondering and learning about this disease.","Yilmaz, A.; Can, E. Z.

The pandemic has made a significant impact on the way we behave and interact in our daily life. The past year has witnessed a strong interplay between human behaviors and epidemic spreading. In this paper, we propose an evolutionary game-theoretic framework to study the coupled evolutions of herd behaviors and epidemics. Our framework extends the classical degree-based mean-field epidemic model over complex networks by coupling it with the evolutionary game dynamics. The statistically equivalent individuals in a population choose their social activity intensities based on the fitness or the payoffs that depend on the state of the epidemics. Meanwhile, the spreading of the infectious disease over the complex network is reciprocally influenced by the players' social activities. We analyze the coupled dynamics by studying the stationary properties of the epidemic for a given herd behavior and the structural properties of the game for a given epidemic process. The decisions of the herd turn out to be strategic substitutes. We formulate an equivalent finite-player game and an equivalent network to represent the interactions among the finite populations. We develop structure-preserving approximation techniques to study time-dependent properties of the joint evolution of the behavioral and epidemic dynamics. The resemblance between the simulated coupled dynamics and the real COVID-19 statistics in the numerical experiments indicates the predictive power of our framework.","Liu, Shutian; Zhao, Yuhan; Zhu, Quanyan",,420,29

METHODS: This cross-sectional online survey was conducted (in community pharmacies in the United Arab Emirates) over 3 weeks (24 May 2020 to 14 June 2020). A proportionate random sample of 491 participants was invited to take part. The SPSS version 26 was used for data management and analysis. KEY FINDINGS: The majority of participants (n = 400) had good knowledge about COVID-19 and high level of preparedness for the pandemic control. Most pharmacists agreed (212, 53.0%) or strongly agreed (91, 22.8%) that they have a major role in the management of the ongoing crisis. Most participants had good awareness about the most common methods of COVID-19 transmission (359, 89.7%) and symptoms encountered (368, 92.0%).

OBJETIVO: Documentar la información publicada sobre el impacto de la COVID-19 en la población con antecedente de trasplante hepático y establecer un protocolo de tratamiento. MÉTODO: Se buscaron en PubMed los términos MeSH ""SARS-CoV-2"", ""COVID-19"", ""trasplante hepático"" y ""tratamiento"". RESULTADOS: Hasta el momento se ha demostrado en la población con trasplante hepático una mayor facilidad para adquirir el virus, sin una diferencia en la mortalidad al compararla con la población general.

Most previous works have focused on two extreme situations where any testing data point either is completely adversarial or always equally prefers the positive label. In this paper, we generalize both of these through a unified framework for strategic classification, and introduce the notion of strategic VC-dimension (SVC) to capture the PAC-learnability in our general strategic setup. SVC provably generalizes the recent concept of adversarial VC-dimension (AVC) introduced by Cullina et al. arXiv:1806.01471. We instantiate our framework for the fundamental strategic linear classification problem. We fully characterize: (1) the statistical learnability of linear classifiers by pinning down its SVC; (2) its computational tractability by pinning down the complexity of the empirical risk minimization problem. Interestingly, the SVC of linear classifiers is always upper bounded by its standard VC-dimension.

Fear and stigma related to infection, mistrust between officials and the population, the often-asymptomatic nature of the disease is likely to lead to under-reporting. We conducted a cross-sectional study to determine the seroprevalence of COVID-19 infection in a large slum in South India 3 months after the index case and recruited 499 adults (age >18 years). The majority (74.3%) were females and about one-third of the population reported comorbidities. The overall seroprevalence of IgG antibody for COVID-19 was 57.9% (95% CI 53.4-62.3). Age, education, occupation and the presence of reported comorbidities were not associated with seroprevalence (P-value >0.05). Case-to-undetected-infections ratio was 1:195 and infection fatality rate was calculated as 2.94 per 10 000 infections. We estimated seroprevalence of COVID-19 was very high in our study population. The focus in this slum should shift from infection prevention to managing the indirect consequences of the pandemic. We recommend seroprevalence studies in such settings before vaccination to identify the vulnerability of COVID-19 infection to optimise the use of insufficient resources. It is a wake-up call to societies and nations, to dedicate paramount attention to slums into recovery and beyond - to build, restore and maintain health equity for the 'Health and wellbeing of all'.","George, Carolin Elizabeth; Inbaraj, Leeberk Raja; Chandrasingh, Sindhulina; de Witte, L P",Epidemiol Infect,420,24

Various proinflammatory stimuli can promote thrombosis by inducing luminal endothelial expression of tissue factor (TF), which interacts with circulating coagulation factor VII to trigger extrinsic coagulation. The signalling mechanism whereby these stimuli evoke TF expression entails activation of NADPH oxidase, upstream from activation of the NF-kappaB transcription factor that drives the induced transcription of the TF gene. When single-stranded RNA viruses are taken up into cellular endosomes, they stimulate endosomal formation and activation of NADPH oxidase complexes via RNA-responsive toll-like receptor 7. It is therefore proposed that SARS-CoV-2 infection of endothelial cells evokes the expression of TF which is contingent on endosomal NADPH oxidase activation. If this hypothesis is correct, hydroxychloroquine, spirulina (more specifically, its chromophore phycocyanobilin) and high-dose glycine may have practical potential for mitigating the elevated thrombotic risk associated with COVID-19.","DiNicolantonio, James J; McCarty, Mark",,420,20

MATERIAL AND METHODS: We performed a comparison of top EM journals by hand-search in terms of COVID-19 publications and citations between January 1st and December 31st, 2020. Publications were also categorized according to research field, country and article types. Data were given as numbers and percentages. RESULTS: Among 18 EM journals, Resuscitation ranked in the first place and American Journal of Emergency Medicine ranked in the last place according to Impact Factor. In these journals, 512 (12.2%) articles related to COVID-19 were published. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine and Internal and Emergency Medicine published the greatest amount of publications related to COVID-19 (n = 71). The American Journal of Emergency Medicine was also the leading journal in terms of ""Total Citations to COVID-19 Articles"" (n = 1192). Western Journal of Emergency Medicine published the greatest proportion of COVID-19 articles (Total COVID-19 Articles/Total Articles = 0.3). World Journal of Emergency Surgery ranked in the first place in terms of citations per COVID-19 articles (n = 33.2). The most common studied field was Effects of COVID-19 on the Health System (n = 222). The US was the most productive country with 188 COVID-19 publications and 1411 citations to these publications, followed by Italy. CONCLUSION: The contribution of EM journals to COVID-19 literature is controversial. ""Effects of COVID-19 on the Health System"" is the most studied field. ""Clinical Properties, Ethical Issues and Treatment Methods"" are neglected fields in EM journals.","Erenler, Ali Kemal; Baydin, Ahmet",Am J Emerg Med,420,22

There is a need to assess their test performance relative to one another. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to compare the test performance of a high complexity laboratory-developed rRT-PCR EUA from Stanford Health Care (SHC) targeting the SARS-CoV-2 envelope (E) gene with other tests: the Atila isothermal amplification assay targeting the nucleocapsid (N) gene and open reading frame 1ab (ORF1ab), the Altona E and spike (S) multiplex, real-time RT-PCR, and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) N1 and N2 rRT-PCRs. STUDY DESIGN: A diagnostic comparison study was performed by testing nasopharyngeal samples from persons under investigation for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Assay performance was assessed by percent agreement and Cohen's kappa coefficient. RESULTS: Positive percent agreement with the SHC EUA reference assay was 82.8 % (95 % confidence interval (CI) 65.0 to 92.9) for Atila, 86.7 % (95 % CI 69.7 to 95.3) for the Altona E and S targets, and 86.7 % (95 % CI 69.7 to 95.3) and 90.0 % (95 % CI 73.6 to 97.3), for the CDC N1 and N2 targets, respectively. All assays demonstrated 100 % negative percent agreement. Kappa coefficients ranged from 0.86 to 0.92, indicating excellent agreement. CONCLUSIONS: Performance was comparable among the SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid amplification methods tested, with a limited number of discrepancies observed in specimens with low viral loads.","Bulterys, Philip L; Garamani, Natasha; Stevens, Bryan; Sahoo, Malaya K; Huang, ChunHong; Hogan, Catherine A; Zehnder, James; Pinsky, Benjamin A",J Clin Virol,420,24

Such studies are now underway amid the ongoing rollout of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines globally. Although traditional case-control and test-negative design studies feature prominently among strategies used to assess vaccine effectiveness, such studies may encounter important threats to validity. Here, we review the theoretical basis for estimation of vaccine direct effects under traditional case-control and test-negative design frameworks, addressing specific natural history parameters of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 relevant to these designs. Bias may be introduced by misclassification of cases and controls, particularly when clinical case criteria include common, nonspecific indicators of COVID-19. When using diagnostic assays with high analytical sensitivity for SARS-CoV-2 detection, individuals testing positive may be counted as cases even if their symptoms are due to other causes. The traditional case-control design may be particularly prone to confounding due to associations of vaccination with healthcare-seeking behavior or risk of infection. The test-negative design reduces but may not eliminate this confounding, for instance, if individuals who receive vaccination seek care or testing for less-severe illness. These circumstances indicate the two study designs cannot be applied naively to datasets gathered through public health surveillance or administrative sources. We suggest practical strategies to reduce bias in vaccine effectiveness estimates at the study design and analysis stages.","Lewnard, Joseph A; Patel, Manish M; Jewell, Nicholas P; Verani, Jennifer R; Kobayashi, Miwako; Tenforde, Mark W; Dean, Natalie E; Cowling, Benjamin J; Lopman, Benjamin A",Epidemiology,420,16

The development of potent, targeted anti-inflammatory therapies to reduce lung inflammation and re-establish the homeostasis in the respiratory tract is still a challenge. Previously, we developed a unique anti-inflammatory nanodrug, P12 (made of hexapeptides and gold nanoparticles), which can attenuate Toll-like receptor-mediated inflammatory responses in macrophages. However, the effect of the administration route on its therapeutic efficacy and tissue distribution remained to be defined. RESULTS: In this study, we systematically compared the effects of three different administration routes [the intratracheal (i.t.), intravenous (i.v.) and intraperitoneal (i.p.)] on the therapeutic activity, biodistribution and pulmonary cell targeting features of P12. Using the LPS-induced ALI mouse model, we found that the local administration route via i.t. instillation was superior in reducing lung inflammation than the other two routes even treated with a lower concentration of P12. Further studies on nanoparticle biodistribution showed that the i.t. administration led to more accumulation of P12 in the lungs but less in the liver and other organs; however, the i.v. and i.p. administration resulted in more nanoparticle accumulation in the liver and lymph nodes, respectively, but less in the lungs. Such a lung favorable distribution was also determined by the unique surface chemistry of P12. Furthermore, the inflammatory condition in the lung could decrease the accumulation of nanoparticles in the lung and liver, while increasing their distribution in the spleen and heart. Interestingly, the i.t. administration route helped the nanoparticles specifically target the lung macrophages, whereas the other two administration routes did not. CONCLUSION: The i.t. administration is better for treating ALI using nanodevices as it enhances the bioavailability and efficacy of the nanodrugs in the target cells of the lung and reduces the potential systematic side effects.","Wang, Lu; Rao, Yafei; Liu, Xiali; Sun, Liya; Gong, Jiameng; Zhang, Huasheng; Shen, Lei; Bao, Aihua; Yang, Hong",J Nanobiotechnology,420,32

The study is motivated by the lack of understanding of the flow-field characteristics and droplet distribution during aerosol-generating procedures. The particle image velocimetry measurements with high temporal and spatial resolutions were performed under ultrasonic scaling in the mockup experimental dental clinic. Compared with other methods focusing on the settled droplet particles, the study focused on the visualization of suspended droplets. From the results of the velocity vector and trajectory map, the high-level contaminated area will be within 1 m from the oral cavity. The vortex structures were identified by the vorticity index. In the surface near the patient's head, a counterclockwise vortex would carry some droplets and contaminate this region. The small droplets circulated in the turbulence cloud and the droplet nuclei generated by dehydration are the two primary sources of suspended particles, which may cause airborne transmission in the dental clinic.

Saudi Arabia's first case was reported in March 2020. Subsequently, some 220,000 cases and 2,000 deaths were recorded through July 2020.COVID-19 infection aggravates glycemic control and provokes acute hyperglycemic crises, according to some reports.We made the same observations in some of our patients diagnosed with COVID-19.However, we are unaware of any reported cases of DKA among COVID-19 patients in Saudi Arabia. Objective: Highlighting the significance of hyperglycemia on COVID-19 patient outcomes. Methods: Five patients with DKA were admitted and diagnosed with COVID-19 based on real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays. Electronic medical records were reviewed and informed consent was obtained prior to reporting the index cases. Results: Five patients presenting with DKA complicating a concurrent COVID-19 infection were reported. Three were known to have preexisting diabetes and two had newly diagnosed diabetes based on significantly elevated glycated hemoglobin levels at admission. Four recovered and were discharged to their homes and one had a complicated course and died. Conclusion: Our cases demonstrate that COVID-19 infection can trigger DKA. DKA can occur among patients who are known to have diabetes mellitus or appears as a first presentation. Clinicians should be extremely careful in checking for admission hyperglycemia and closely monitor respiratory status during fluid resuscitation of COVID-19-related DKA.","Alsadhan, Ibrahim; Alruwashid, Shahad; Alhamad, Maram; Alajmi, Sarah; Alshehri, Sara; Alfadhli, Eman; Ekhzaimy, Aishah",Curr Ther Res Clin Exp,420,26

The aim of this article was to present representative troublesome cases related to the manipulation of donor arteries (DAs) and recipient arteries during low-flow extracranial-intracranial bypass. METHODS: In the past 5 years, 507 low-flow bypass surgeries were performed in patients with cerebral aneurysms, moyamoya disease, and intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis. Frustrating perioperative situations were retrospectively reviewed, and 6 representative cases were described. RESULTS: Case 1 involved repeat microanastomosis owing to occlusion of the anastomotic segment by thrombus formation. Case 2 involved repair of the DA injured by thermal energy. Case 3 involved direct repair of the DA damaged by a sharp knife. Case 4 involved repeat microanastomosis owing to avulsion of the anastomotic segment. Case 5 involved lengthening of the short DA with a nearby interposition graft. Case 6 involved use of retrograde flow via the distal segment of the DA secondary to the injury of the proximal segment of the DA. In all patients, rescue procedures were successful, and bypass flow was patent with no relevant complications. CONCLUSIONS: The intraoperative accidents reported here were frustrating; however, all patients were safely rescued without significant sequelae.

METHODS: We reviewed current literature reporting on COVID-19 in cancer (CA), hematopoietic cell (HCT), and solid organ transplant (SOT) patients and compared their clinical data and outcomes to the general population. For adult CA, HCT and SOT patients, an extensive search strategy retrieved all articles published until July 20, 2020 by combining the terms coronavirus, coronavirus infection, COVID-19, and SARS-CoV-2 in PubMed, Cochrane, and Web of Science, and following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis guidelines. For the pediatric CA cohort, a global COVID-19 registry was used. For the general population cohort, a large meta-analysis was used to compare pooled prevalence estimates, and two large meta-analyses were utilized to serve as pooled comparators for hospitalized COVID-19 patients. FINDINGS: Compared to the general population, adult CA and SOT patients with COVID-19 had higher comorbidities, greater levels of inflammatory markers at diagnosis, and higher rates of intensive care and hospital mortality. Pediatric CA patients and HCT patients with COVID-19 tended to have clinical presentations and outcomes similar to the general population. INTERPRETATION: To our knowledge, this is the first systematic review evaluating COVID-19 phenotype and outcomes in immunocompromised patients and comparing them to the general population, which shows that hospital outcomes appear to be worse in adult CA and SOT patients, potentially due to their higher co-morbidity burden.

Understanding hesitancy towards immunization is even more important nowadays, with the continuous threat of COVID-19 pandemic. Medical conspiracy beliefs, scientific skepticism, as well as low trust in governmental institutions, and evidence-based knowledge all have troubling effects on immunization. OBJECTIVE: To examine how these factors cross-react to influence vaccine behavior against any vaccine preventable disease (VPD), we hypothesized a model consisting of the belief in conspiracy theories as the predictor, and as the mediators subjective and objective vaccine knowledge, and trust in the health care system and science. The model was tested by examining the vaccine intentions for the children and self for any VPD. METHODS: Two separate studies were conducted on the representative samples of Serbian population; the first study investigated the intentions for child vaccination and the second study examined the vaccine intentions against any VPD, including adult vaccination. We used path analysis followed by logistic regression to analyze the data. RESULTS: The results revealed high vaccine hesitancy motivated by the belief in the vaccine conspiracy theories, through its effect on reduced trust in medical science and institutions, and low objective vaccine knowledge. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study may be used to implement appropriate policy changes and implementation of the public health campaigns to promote immunization with a wide range of vaccines against common diseases, such as measles, human papillomaviruses, or pertussis, and novel diseases, such as COVID.","Milosevic Dordevic, J; Mari, S; Vdovic, M; Milosevic, A",Soc Sci Med,420,20

In Egypt over 96,108 individuals were infected so far. Objective: In the present study, the objective is to perform a complete genome sequence of SAR-CoV2 isolated from Egyptian coronavirus disease (COVID-19) patients. Methods: Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from 61 COVID-19 patients who attended at National Cancer Institute, Kasr Al-Aini Hospital and the army hospital. Viral RNA was extracted and whole genomic sequencing was conducted using Next Generation Sequencing. Results: In all cases, the sequenced virus has at least 99% identity to the reference Wuhan 1. The sequence analysis showed 204 distinct genome variations including 114 missense mutations, 72 synonymous mutations, 1 disruptive in-frame deletion, 7 downstream gene mutations, 6 upstream gene mutations, 3 frame-shift deletions, and 1 in-frame deletion. The most dominant clades were G/GH/GR/O and the dominant type is B. Conclusion: The whole genomic sequence of SARS-CoV2 showed 204 variations in the genomes of the Egyptian isolates, where the Asp614Gly (D614G) substitution is the most common among the samples (60/61).

However, exercise can be provided remotely as part of a home exercise programme, while support and advice can be provided over the telephone. There is initial evidence from trials and systematic reviews to suggest that remotely provided physiotherapy can be used to manage a variety of musculoskeletal conditions safely and effectively. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The aim of this single-blind randomised controlled non-inferiority trial is to determine whether a supported home exercise programme is as good as or better than face-to-face physiotherapy for the treatment of musculoskeletal conditions. Two hundred and ten participants will be recruited from five public hospitals in Sydney, Australia. Participants will be randomised to either the supported home exercise group or the face-to-face physiotherapy group. Participants allocated to the supported home exercise group will initially receive one face-to-face session with the trial physiotherapist and will then be managed remotely for the next 6 weeks. Participants allocated to the face-to-face physiotherapy group will receive a course of physiotherapy as typically provided in Sydney government hospitals. The primary outcome is function measured by the Patient Specific Functional Scale at 6 weeks. There will be nine secondary outcomes measured at 6 and 26 weeks. Separate analyses will be conducted on each outcome, and all analyses will be conducted on an intention-to-treat basis. A health economic evaluation will be conducted from a health funder plus patient perspective. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval was obtained on the 17 March 2017 from the Northern Sydney Local Health District HREC, trial number HREC/16HAWKE/431-RESP/16/287. The results of this study will be submitted for publication to peer-reviewed journals and be presented at national and international conferences. Recruitment commenced in March 2019, and it is anticipated that the trial will be completed by December 2021.

Many patients do not receive high-dose therapy, however, e.g., due to limited availability and access, especially in the COVID era. Telehealth approaches can overcome many barriers, and evidence suggests that some forms of telerehabilitation are efficacious after stroke. However, uncertainty exists as to which patients are most likely to benefit from telerehabilitation. This issue was examined in the current study. Methods: Data are from patients randomized to telerehabilitation (TR) in an 11-site, assessor-blind trial (JAMA Neurol 76:1079) that provided 6 weeks of intensive arm motor therapy to hemiparetic patients with stroke 4-36 weeks prior. The primary endpoint was change in arm motor Fugl-Meyer (FM) from pre-treatment to 1-month post-treatment. Predictors of TR-related FM gain were identified using forward stepwise multivariable linear regression analysis, advancing the most significant predictor from each of 8 categories (demographics, stroke characteristics, medical history, amount of outside therapy, motivation, sensorimotor impairment, cognitive/affective status, and functional status) if it survived bivariate screening with p&lt;0.1. Results: In patients &gt;90 days post-stroke onset (n=44), sex (r=.33, p=.028), # hours of outside therapy post-randomization (r=.36, p=.019), spasticity (r=-.37, p=.014), and NIHSS visual field score (r=-.28, p=.068) were bivariate predictors of TR-related FM gain. In multivariable analysis, all except therapy hours survived as significant (P&lt;0.05) predictors: TR-related FM gains were higher in females and lower in patients with spasticity or visual field defects. When the 15 patients randomized to TR ≤90 days post-stroke were added in secondary analysis, multivariable analysis found that sex, # hours of therapy post-randomization, and NIHSS neglect score were significant predictors. Conclusions: In patients with stable motor status &gt;90 days post-stroke, behavioral gains from home-based TR were greatest in patients who were female and who had less spasticity and visual field defects. These results might be useful for patient selection and for design of future TR-based therapeutic approaches.","Paik, S. M.; Cramer, S. C.",Stroke,420,15

This paper presents the significant cluster events, relevant developments of innovation, and economical impact in Korea that could inform policy makers on how to respond to health crises in the future. Methods: Health care, economy, epidemiological data are collected from various sources including the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) or other government sources. Results: The KCDC jointly with medical professionals developed a series of innovations such as 1) Full contact tracing and rapid testing with a 12 hours turnaround and 10 minutes movement tracking systems, 2) transparent disclosure of all contract tracing data to the public through a central database, 3) Drive-Through and Walk-Through testing methods, and 4) a 4 tier patient severity index and community treatment isolation centers. Korea moved from the 4th in the world for total confirmed cases in March down to 76th in August. Conclusions: Expedited enforcement of amended legislation acts to protect the healthcare workforce resulted in only 10 healthcare professionals contracting the virus while caring for Covid-19 patients. This has resulted in minimal human capital loss and the government was able to re-direct existing medical workforce to areas in need. The quarantine strategies implemented resulted in little need to lock down the whole economy but also limited the cost spent to gain a year of life to 193,848 Won (US$163).","Lee, Doowon; Choi, Bobae",,420,24

Two specific risk factors are most prominent, old age and the presence of co-morbidity. Recent studies have shown that patients with compromised renal function, especially those treated with renal replacement therapy or having received a kidney transplant are at a much higher risk for severe COVID infection and increased mortality. This may be in part due to the increased prevalence of co-morbid conditions in these patients but specific alterations in their immune system, reflecting premature immunological aging, may be equally important. In this review the different aspects, in particular thymus function and memory T cell expansion, of uremia-associated immunological aging are reviewed with respect to COVID 19 infection. In essence, the decreased generation of naive T cells may be instrumental in suboptimal anti-viral immune responses while the relatively uncontrolled expansion of effector T cells may facilitate the feared phase of the COVID-19 infection with excessive and live-threatening inflammation of the lung parenchyma.","Betjes, M.

For the severe variant, PI*Z, the correlation coefficient (CC) was 0.8584 for the number of patients and 0.8713 for the number of deaths. For the milder variant, PI*S, it was 0.5818 and 0.6326, respectively. In Japan, the number of patients and deaths correlated with the population size with a CC of 0.6667 and 0.7074 respectively, and was proportional to the population size to the power of 1.65 and 1.54. The prevalence of AAT deficiency also correlated with the epidemiological pattern of COVID-19. In countries with high prevalence of AAT deficiency, after the initial rise, the daily number of patients and that of deaths ran parallel at a high level for more than 6 months without sign of abatement. In countries with a low prevalence of AAT deficiency, after the first wave of the epidemic, the number of the deaths decreased continuously while the number of patients remained the same or even increased resulting in a decreasing case-fatality rate. When the cumulative number of deaths was plotted on the y-axis against the cumulative number of patients on the x-axis, plots fell on a straight line in countries with a high prevalence of AAT deficiency;while in countries with a low prevalence of AAT deficiency, a break appeared, after which the plots fell on flatter slope indicating decreasing case-fatality rate. The observation suggests emergence of an attenuated variant in countries with a low prevalence of AAT deficiency.","Yoshikura, H.",Global Health &amp; Medicine,420,16

MethodsIn a tertiary health centre at Delhi, an online based cross-sectional study was conducted using a semi-structured questionnaire, developed by employing a nominal group technique, in aged 18 years and above who were SARS-CoV-2 positive during the month of January to April 2021. Socio-demographic, various potential risk factors, including pre-existing morbidities, vaccination status, and severity of acute COVID-19 illness, information on acute illness for management and a spectrum of PCS were collected between June 16 to July 28, 2021. Each participant was contacted telephonically before sending the survey link. PCS were presented as relative frequency; chi-square test, odds ratio, including adjusted, were calculated to rule out association between PCS and potential predictors. ResultsA total of 773 of 1801 COVID recovered participants responded to the link reaching a participation rate of 42{middle dot}9%, with a median age of 34 years (IQR 27 to 44). Male respondents were 56{middle dot}4%. Around 33{middle dot}2% of them had PCS at four or more weeks, affecting almost all body organ systems. The most prevalent PCS were fatigue (79{middle dot}3%), pain in the joins (33{middle dot}4%), muscle (29{middle dot}9%), hair loss (28{middle dot}0%), headache (27{middle dot}2%), breathlessness (25{middle dot}3%), sleep disturbance (25{middle dot}3%) and cough (24{middle dot}9%). The prevalence of PCS was reduced to 12{middle dot}8% at 12 weeks after positive test. Factor such as female gender, older age, oxygen supplementation during the acute illness, working in healthcare care facilities, the severity of acute illness, and pre-existing co-morbid were risk factors for PCS. Further, vaccination (second dose) reduced the odds of developing PCS by 45% compared to unvaccinated participants (aOR 0{middle dot}65; 95%CI 0{middle dot}45-0{middle dot}96). Finally, 8{middle dot}3% of participants rated their overall health status was either poor or very poor following COVID-19 illness. ConclusionsThe PCS involves almost all organ systems, regardless of the severity of acute COVID-19 illness. Two doses of vaccine help to reduce development of PCS. Research in ContextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSAlthough the evidence is mounting in prolonged COVID-19 symptoms among COVID-19 survivors, to date, the full range of such post-COVID-19 symptoms (PCS) is not yet fully understood. There is a lack of studies that assessed PCS comprehensively among persons who have recovered from the COVID-19illness. For example, limited data are available on psychosocial, behavioral, and oral manifestations related to PCS. Further, there is a paucity of studies that included a wide range of determinants of PCS and the association of vaccination with the development of PCS across the world. Our study is the first such study conducted among COVID-19 recovered persons who with a majority of them employed in a tertiary health care institute of north India. Added value of this studyOur study, for the first time, investigated a wide range of post-COVID-19 manifestations among COVID-19 recovered persons in organ-specific and psychosocial behavioral aspects, making this the largest categorization of PCS currently (in total 16). The study included telephonic calls to each eligible candidate which helped in ensuring the COVID-19 status at the time of the study. Since the participants either were employees in the hospital or their dependents that enhance the accuracy of reporting PCS. The most prevalent symptom was unspecific PCS (85.6%), e.g., fatigue, followed by musculoskeletal manifestations (49{middle dot}8%), Ear, Nose and Throat symptoms (47{middle dot}5%), neurological (47{middle dot}0%), cardio-respiratory (42{middle dot}4%, gastrointestinal (36{middle dot}2%), ocular symptoms (31{middle dot}9%), dermatological symptoms (31{middle dot}5%), and cardio-vascular (24{middle dot}5%) symptoms, and mental health symptoms (23{middle dot}7%). The rest of the organ specific symptoms were observed in less than 20% of the respondents. Older age, female gender, pre-existing co-morbid, oxygen supplementation during acute illness, the severity of illness, working in health care institutions were associated with PCS. Vaccination after the second dose was protective against PCS compared to non-vaccinated participants. Further, our study also reported a rating of the overall health status among COVID survivors, whereby around 8.3% of them reported being a poor or very poor health. Implications of all the available evidencePCS affects a multi-organ organ system, irrespective of the severity of acute-phase COVID-19 illness and hospitalization. Such persistent COVID-19 symptoms, compounded by its heterogeneity among COVID survivors can pose a substantial burden to the affected individuals and their families and additional challenges for healthcare delivery and public health service. The current study shows that one in three individuals experience persistent COVID-19 symptoms. Since the COVID pandemic is still ongoing across the world, therefore, the number of people experiencing PCS is likely to be increased substantially further. An integrated PCS care strategy, but not limited to organ-specific healthcare disciplines, others such as psychosocial support, including counseling and education, rehabilitation, community-based rehabilitation programs will be required for management. Prioritization of PCS care to elder and co-morbid patients should be recommended. Expediting the vaccination drive will be helpful to reduce the development of persistent COVID-19 symptoms. Research, collaborative and multidisciplinary, is required to understand the underlying pathophysiology mechanism for PCS.","Senjam, Suraj Singh; Singh, Balhara Yatan Pal; Parmeshwar, Kumar; Nichal, Neeraj; Manna, Souvik; Madan, Karan; Ahmed, Nishat Hussain; Gupta, Noopur; Sharma, Rajesh; Gupta, Yashdeep; Ray, Animesh; Gupta, Vivek; Vashist, Praveen; Kumar, Atul; Dar, Lalit; Titiyal, Jeevan Singh; Tandon, Radhika; Gulleira, Randeep",,420,16

As new infections have decreased in many PEPFAR-supported countries, PEPFAR is increasingly focusing on understanding and decreasing mortality among PLHIV, specifically by addressing advanced HIV disease (AHD) and its attendant opportunistic infections (OIs). Several developments in identifying AHD, in preventing, diagnosing, and treating selected OIs, and in PEPFAR's support for mortality surveillance make this an opportune moment for PEPFAR to address HIV-related mortality. DISCUSSION: AHD upon diagnosis or re-engagement in HIV care is not uncommon, and it substantially increases risk of death from OIs. The World Health Organization provides evidence-based guidelines for a package of interventions for preventing, diagnosing, and treating common OIs, including tuberculosis (TB), cryptococcal meningitis, and severe bacterial infections. PEPFAR facilitates implementation of these guidelines. To identify PLHIV with low CD4, PEPFAR plans to support expanded access to CD4 testing, including a point-of-care assay that differentiates CD4 cell count as a binary of greater than or less than 200 cells/µL. To prevent AHD-related mortality, PEPFAR supports rapid ART initiation with integrase inhibitor-based regimens and implementation and documentation of TB preventive treatment. To diagnose selected OIs, PEPFAR is implementing urine lateral flow lipoarabinomannan use to identify TB among PLHIV who have a CD4 cell count < 200 cells/µL. To treat selected OIs, PEPFAR has focused on improving patient-centered care in TB/HIV co-infection services and scaling up implementation of new drug regimens for cryptococcal meningitis. To better understand mortality, PEPFAR has introduced an indicator, TX_ML, to routinely and systematically categorize outcomes, including deaths, among PLHIV on ART. CONCLUSIONS: PEPFAR is increasing its efforts to identify AHD; to prevent, diagnose, and treat OIs; and to track mortality in its programs. These ongoing efforts, done in collaboration with other stakeholders, seek to decrease mortality among PLHIV.","Boyd, Andrew T; Oboho, Ikwo; Paulin, Heather; Ali, Hammad; Godfrey, Catherine; Date, Anand; Sean Cavanaugh, J",AIDS Res Ther,420,16

RESULTS: Total white blood cell count, neutrophil count and C-reactive protein were significantly higher in patients who died of COVID-19 than those who recovered from it (p < 0.05), but the total lymphocyte count, CD4 + T cells, CD8 + T cells, B cells and natural killer cells were significantly lower when compared in the same groups. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that increased D-dimer, decreased CD4 + T cells and increased neutrophils were risk factors for mortality. Further multiple COX regression demonstrated that neutrophil &#8805; 5.27 × 109/L increased the risk of death in COVID-19 patients after adjustment for age and gender. However, CD4 + T cells &#8805; 260/µL appeared to reduce the risk of death. CONCLUSION: SARS-CoV-2 infection led to a significant decrease of lymphocytes, and decreased CD4 + T cell count was a risk factor for COVID-19 patients to develop severe disease and death. METHODS: This study included 190 hospitalized COVID-19 patients from January 30, 2020 to March 4, 2020 in Wuhan, China, of whom 85 died and 105 recovered.

Contact tracing is usually performed manually by authorized personnel. Manual contact tracing is an inefficient, error-prone, time-consuming process of limited utility to the population at large as those in close contact with infected individuals are informed hours, if not days, later. This paper introduces an alternative way to manual contact tracing. The proposed Smart Contact Tracing (SCT) system utilizes the smartphone's Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) signals and machine learning classifier to accurately and quickly determined the contact profile. SCT's contribution is two-fold: a) classification of the user's contact as high/low-risk using precise proximity sensing, and b) user anonymity using a privacy-preserving communications protocol. SCT leverages BLE's non-connectable advertising feature to broadcast a signature packet when the user is in the public space. Both broadcasted and observed signatures are stored in the user's smartphone and they are only uploaded to a secure signature database when a user is confirmed by public health authorities to be infected. Using received signal strength (RSS) each smartphone estimates its distance from other user's phones and issues real-time alerts when social distancing rules are violated. The paper includes extensive experimentation utilizing real-life smartphone positions and a comparative evaluation of five machine learning classifiers. Reported results indicate that a decision tree classifier outperforms other states of the art classification methods in terms of accuracy. Lastly, to facilitate research in this area, and to contribute to the timely development of advanced solutions the entire data set of six experiments with about 123,000 data points is made publicly available.","Ng, Pai Chet; Spachos, Petros; Plataniotis, Konstantinos",,420,14

The overall inadequate preparation of the rehabilitation system to face a sudden epidemic was clear, and similar to that of the acute services. The original idea of confining the COVID-19 cases to some areas of rehabilitation wards and/or hospitals, preserving others, proved not to be feasible. Continuous reorganization and adaptation were required due to the rapid changes. Overall, rehabilitation needs had to surrender to the more acute emergency, with total conversion of beds, wards and even hospitals. The quarantine needs heavily involved also outpatient services that were mostly closed. Rehabilitation professionals needed support, but also acted properly, again similarly to what happened in the acute wards. The typical needs of rehabilitation, such as human and physical contacts, but also social interactions including patient, team, family and caregivers, appeared clearly in the current unavoidable need of being suppressed.

Artificial intelligence (AI)-aided tools have exhibited desirable potential; for example, chest computed tomography (CT) has been demonstrated to play a major role in the diagnosis and evaluation of COVID-19. However, developing a CT-based AI diagnostic system for the disease detection has faced considerable challenges, which is mainly due to the lack of adequate manually-delineated samples for training, as well as the requirement of sufficient sensitivity to subtle lesions in the early infection stages. In this study, we developed a dual-branch combination network (DCN) for COVID-19 diagnosis that can simultaneously achieve individual-level classification and lesion segmentation. To focus the classification branch more intensively on the lesion areas, a novel lesion attention module was developed to integrate the intermediate segmentation results. Furthermore, to manage the potential influence of different imaging parameters from individual facilities, a slice probability mapping method was proposed to learn the transformation from slice-level to individual-level classification. We conducted experiments on a large dataset of 1202 subjects from ten institutes in China. The results demonstrated that 1) the proposed DCN attained a classification accuracy of 96.74% on the internal dataset and 92.87% on the external validation dataset, thereby outperforming other models; 2) DCN obtained comparable performance with fewer samples and exhibited higher sensitivity, especially in subtle lesion detection; and 3) DCN provided good interpretability on the loci of infection compared to other deep models due to its classification guided by high-level semantic information.

Objective: To investigate the association between perinatal maternal depression and an increased long-term risk of depression in their adolescent and adult offspring. Data Sources: A systematic search of the electronic databases of PubMed and PsycINFO was conducted from May 2019 to June 2019. Study Selection: A total of 6309 articles were identified, of which 88 articles were extracted for full-text review by 2 reviewers. Only articles reporting data from prospective longitudinal studies that assessed maternal depression during antenatal and/or postnatal periods and resulting offspring 12 years or older with measures of established psychometric properties were included. Exclusion criteria consisted of all other study designs, mothers with other medical and psychiatric comorbidities, and offspring younger than 12 years. Data Extraction and Synthesis: Data were extracted by 2 independent reviewers, and discrepancies were mediated by an expert third reviewer. Meta-analysis was performed using Bayesian statistical inference and reported using Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) guideline. The association of depression timing with the sex of offspring was explored using metaregression. Main Outcomes and Measures: Offspring depression was evaluated using standardized depression scales or clinical interviews. Results: Six studies with a total of 15â¯584 mother-child dyads were included in the meta-analysis, which found the offspring of mothers who experienced perinatal depression to have increased odds of depression (odds ratio [OR], 1.70; 95% credible interval [CrI], 1.60-2.65; posterior probability [PP] [OR >1], 98.6%). Although metaregression found no evidence for an overall association between perinatal depression timing and offspring depression (antenatal vs postnatal, PP [OR >1] = 53.8%), subgroup analyses showed slightly higher pooled odds for the antenatal studies (OR, 1.78; 95% CrI, 0.93-3.33; PP [OR >1] = 96.2%) than for the postnatal studies (OR, 1.66; 95% CrI, 0.65-3.84; PP [OR >1] = 88.0%). Female adolescent offspring recorded higher rates of depression in metaregression analyses, such that a 1% increase in the percentage of female (relative to male) offspring was associated with a 6% increase in the odds of offspring depression (OR, 1.06; 95% CrI, 0.99-1.14; &#964;2 = 0.31). Conclusions and Relevance: In this study, maternal perinatal depression, especially antenatal depression, was associated with the risk of depression in adolescence and adulthood. More research into the mechanisms of depression risk transmission and assessments of postinterventional risk reduction could aid in the development of future strategies to tackle depressive disorders in pregnancy.","Tirumalaraju, Vaishali; Suchting, Robert; Evans, Jonathan; Goetzl, Laura; Refuerzo, Jerrie; Neumann, Alexander; Anand, Deepa; Ravikumar, Rekha; Green, Charles E; Cowen, Philip J; Selvaraj, Sudhakar",JAMA Netw Open,420,6

Genome reductions tend toward the energetically favorable removal of unnecessary, redundant, or nonfunctional genes. However, without mechanisms to compensate for these losses, deleterious mutation and genetic drift might otherwise overwhelm a population. Among the mechanisms employed to counter gene loss and share evolutionary success within a population, gene transfer agents (GTAs) are increasingly becoming recognized as important contributors. Although viral in origin, GTA particles package fragments of their ""host"" genome for distribution within a population of cells, often in a synchronized manner, rather than selfishly packaging genes necessary for their spread. Microbes as diverse as archaea and alpha-proteobacteria have been known to produce GTA particles, which are capable of transferring selective advantages such as virulence factors and antibiotic resistance. In this review, we discuss the various types of GTAs identified thus far, focusing on a defined set of symbiotic alpha-proteobacteria known to carry them. Drawing attention to the predicted presence of these genes, we discuss their potential within the selective marine and terrestrial environments occupied by mutualistic, parasitic, and endosymbiotic microbes.","Christensen, Steen; Serbus, Laura R",Results Probl Cell Differ,420,23

METHODS: A quantitative study with a descriptive-comparative and cross-sectional design carried out. The sample, selected for convenience, consisted of 837 Spanish children aged 0-12. The ""Children and confinement"" questionnaire was used, distributed electronically through Google Forms and social networks and activated for 45 days. The individuals participating in this study were mainly children (50.2%) who were in primary education (44.8%). Predominantly, the families of participants were biparental (87.9%), with established routines and schedules (85.7%). RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The use of digital screens is an important part of children's daily routine. Their daily activities were practiced for more than three-six years, with more by girls. The time children devoted to sleep was directly proportional to the time they devoted to physical activity and indirectly proportional to the time they spent watching screens. The children who slept the most were those aged zero-three years, especially girls, who belonged to large families. The levels of physical activity in the sample were low, as were the times spent on activities such as music or games.","Cachón-Zagalaz, Javier; Zagalaz-Sánchez, M ª Luisa; Arufe-Giráldez, Víctor; Sanmiguel-Rodríguez, Alberto; González-Valero, Gabriel",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),420,16

The formulation of functional materials requires synergistic understanding on the properties of materials and mechanisms of virus transmission and disease progression, including secondary bacterial infections that are prevalent in COVID-19 patients. A viable candidate in the struggle against the pandemic is antimicrobial polymer, due to their favorable properties of flexibility, lightweight, and ease of synthesis. Polymers are the base material for personal protective equipment (PPE), such as gloves, face mask, face shield, and coverall suit for frontliners. Conducting polymers (CPs) are polymers with electrical properties due to the addition of dopant in the polymer structure. The conductivity of polymers augments their antiviral and antibacterial properties. This review discusses the types of CPs and how their properties could be exploited to ward off bacterial infections in hospital settings, specifically in cases involving COVID-19 patients. This review also covers common CPs fabrication techniques. The key components to produce CPs at several possibilities to fit the current needs in fighting secondary bacterial infections are also discussed.","Mahat, Mohd Muzamir; Sabere, Awis Sukarni Mohmad; Azizi, Juzaili; Amdan, Nur Asyura Nor",Emergent Mater,420,6

However, in contrast to physical conferences, virtual conferences face a challenge in efficiently scheduling talks, accounting for the availability of participants from different time-zones as well as their interests in attending different talks. In such settings, a natural objective for the conference organizers would be to maximize some global welfare measure, such as the total expected audience participation across all talks. However, we show that optimizing for global welfare could result in a schedule that is unfair to the stakeholders, i.e., the individual utilities for participants and speakers can be highly unequal. To address the fairness concerns, we formally define fairness notions for participants and speakers, and subsequently derive suitable fairness objectives for them. We show that the welfare and fairness objectives can be in conflict with each other, and there is a need to maintain a balance between these objective while caring for them simultaneously. Thus, we propose a joint optimization framework that allows conference organizers to design talk schedules that balance (i.e., allow trade-offs) between global welfare, participant fairness and the speaker fairness objectives. We show that the optimization problem can be solved using integer linear programming, and empirically evaluate the necessity and benefits of such joint optimization approach in virtual conference scheduling.","Patro, Gourab K; Chakraborty, Abhijnan; Ganguly, Niloy; Gummadi, Krishna P.",,420,24

The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) became pandemic within weeks and the number of human infections and severe cases is increasing. We aimed to investigate the susceptibilty of potential animal hosts and the risk of anthropozoonotic spill-over infections. Methods: We intranasally inoculated nine fruit bats (Rousettus aegyptiacus), ferrets (Mustela putorius), pigs (Sus scrofa domesticus), and 17 chickens (Gallus gallus domesticus) with 105 TCID50 of a SARS-CoV-2 isolate per animal. Direct contact animals (n=3) were included 24 h after inoculation to test viral transmission. Animals were monitored for clinical signs and for virus shedding by nucleic acid extraction from nasal washes and rectal swabs (ferrets), oral swabs and pooled faeces samples (fruit bats), nasal and rectal swabs (pigs), or oropharyngeal and cloacal swabs (chickens) on days 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, and 21 after infection by quantitative RT-PCR (RT-qPCR). On days 4, 8, and 12, two inoculated animals (or three in the case of chickens) of each species were euthanised, and all remaining animals, including the contacts, were euthanised at day 21. All animals were subjected to autopsy and various tissues were collected for virus detection by RT-qPCR, histopathology immunohistochemistry, and in situ hybridisation. Presence of SARS-CoV-2 reactive antibodies was tested by indirect immunofluorescence assay and virus neutralisation test in samples collected before inoculation and at autopsy. Findings: Pigs and chickens were not susceptible to SARS-CoV-2. All swabs, organ samples, and contact animals were negative for viral RNA, and none of the pigs or chickens seroconverted. Seven (78%) of nine fruit bats had a transient infection, with virus detectable by RT-qPCR, immunohistochemistry, and in situ hybridisation in the nasal cavity, associated with rhinitis. Viral RNA was also identified in the trachea, lung, and lung-associated lymphatic tissue in two animals euthanised at day 4. One of three contact bats became infected. More efficient virus replication but no clinical signs were observed in ferrets, with transmission to all three direct contact animals. Mild rhinitis was associated with viral antigen detection in the respiratory and olfactory epithelium. Prominent viral RNA loads of 0-104 viral genome copies per mL were detected in the upper respiratory tract of fruit bats and ferrets, and both species developed SARS-CoV-2-reactive antibodies reaching neutralising titres of up to 1/1024 after 21 days. Interpretation: Pigs and chickens could not be infected intranasally by SARS-CoV-2, whereas fruit bats showed characteristics of a reservoir host. Virus replication in ferrets resembled a subclinical human infection with efficient spread. Ferrets might serve as a useful model for further studies-eg, testing vaccines or antivirals.

It reports on how a shared sense of purpose has been established, that of minimizing harm to lives and livelihoods, for which the government has sought – and secured – New Zealanders’ commitment. Key leadership practices comprise the government’s willingness to themselves be led by expertise, its efforts to mobilise the population, and to enable coping, all of which serve to build the trust in leadership needed for transformative, collective action such as the pandemic demands. At the time of writing, New Zealand appears well on track to achieve its ambitious goal of achieving rapid and complete control over the COVID-19 outbreak – not just ‘flattening the curve’ as other countries are struggling to do – at least in part due to these leadership contributions. A framework of good practices for pandemic leadership is offered drawn from this case study, in the hope transferable lessons can be taken to aid others in the continuing struggle to limit the harm COVID-19 poses to lives and livelihoods throughout the world.","Wilson, Suze",Leadership,420,1

We present a case of a 76-year-old, female lung transplant recipient treated for acute cellular rejection with methylprednisolone and anti-thymocyte globulin, who subsequently contracted SARS-CoV-2 and developed a sharp increase in the mean fluorescent intensity of anti-HLA antibodies. Analysis of circulating exosomes during rejection, but before SARS-CoV-2 infection, revealed the presence of lung self-antigens and HLA class II molecules. After the patient contracted SARS-CoV-2, exosomes with the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein were also found. After resolution of infectious symptoms, exosomes with SARS-CoV-2 spike protein were no longer detected; however, exosomes with lung self-antigens and HLA class II molecules persisted, which coincided with a progressive decline in spirometric flows, suggesting chronic lung allograft dysfunction. We propose that the analysis of circulating exosomes may be used to detect allograft injury mediated by both rejection and infection. Furthermore, the detection of exosomes containing viral proteins may be helpful in identifying allograft injury driven by viral pathogens.","Goodlet, Kellie J; Bansal, Sandhya; Arjuna, Ashwini; Nailor, Michael D; Buddhdev, Bhuvin; Abdelrazek, Hesham; Mohamed, Hesham; Omar, Ashraf; Walia, Rajat; Mohanakumar, Thalachallour; Tokman, Sofya",Transpl Infect Dis,420,21

Real-time data is noisy and very often hampered by systematic errors in reporting. Detailed epidemic models may contain a large number of empirical parameters, which cannot be determined with sufficient accuracy. In this paper, we show that the cumulative number of deaths can be regarded as a master variable, and the parameters of the epidemic such as the basic reproduction number, the size of the susceptible population, and the infection rate can be determined. In the SIR model, we derive an explicit single variable differential equation for the evolution of the cumulative number of fatalities. We show that the epidemic in Spain, Italy, and Hubei Province, China follows this master equation closely. We discuss the relationship with the logistic growth model, and we show that it is a good approximation when the basic reproduction number is less than $2.3$. This condition is valid for the outbreak in Hubei, but not for the outbreaks in Spain, Italy, and New York. The difference is in the shorter infectious period in China, probably due to the separation policy of the infected. For more complex models, with more internal variables, such as the SEIR model, the equations derived from the SIR model remain valid approximately, due to the separation of timescales.","Vattay, Gabor",,420,33

However, the rapid dissemination of information has highlighted some issues with communication of scientific results and opinions in this time of heightened sensitivity and global concern. MAIN TEXT: Rapid publication of COVID-19 literature through expedited review, preprint publications and opinion pieces are important resources for the medical scientific community. Yet the risks of unverified information loom large in times when the healthcare community is desperate for information. Information that has not been properly vetted, or opinion pieces without solid evidence, may be used to influence public health policy decisions. We discuss three examples of unverified information and the consequences in this time of high anxiety surrounding COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: In an era when information can be widely and swiftly disseminated, it is important to ensure that the scientific community is not an inadvertent source of misinformation. This will require a multimodal approach, with buy-in from editors, publishers, preprint servers, authors and journalists. The landscape of medical publications has changed, and a collaborative approach is required to maintain a high standard of scientific communications.","Bagdasarian, N; Cross, G B; Fisher, D",BMC Med,420,24

We researched whether the speed of sharing research results in the COVID-19 epidemic was higher than the SARS and Ebola epidemics. We also researched whether there is any difference in the most frequent topics investigated before and after the COVID-19, SARS, and Ebola epidemics started. METHODS: We used PubMed database search tools to determine the time-period it took for the number of articles to rise after the epidemics started and the most frequent topics assigned to the articles. RESULTS: The main results were, first, the rise in the number of articles occurred 6 weeks after the COVID-19 epidemic started whereas, this rise occurred 4 months after the SARS and 7 months after the Ebola epidemics started. Second, etiology, statistics & numerical data, and epidemiology were the three most frequent topics investigated in the COVID-19 epidemic. However, etiology, microbiology, and genetics in the SARS epidemic, and statistics & numerical data, epidemiology, and prevention & control in the Ebola epidemic were more frequently studied compared with other topics. Third, some topics were studied more frequently after the epidemics started. CONCLUSIONS: The speed of sharing results in the COVID-19 epidemic was much higher than the SARS and Ebola epidemics, and that there is a difference in the most frequent articles' topics investigated in these three epidemics. Due to the value of time in controlling epidemics spread, the study highlights the necessity of defining more solutions for rapidly providing pertinent research findings in fighting against the next public health emergency.","Khanali, Javad; Malekpour, Mohammad-Reza; Kolahi, Ali-Asghar",BMC Public Health,420,1

To achieve such a goal, it is important to have epidemiological surveillance to retrieve data about its routes of transmission and dispersion. This study investigated the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 detection using filtration through 0.22 µm pores. METHODS: A filtration system with vacuum pump was used for sampling, and molecular analysis was performed by RT-PCR for detecting the COVID-19 virus. RESULTS: It was found that SARS-CoV-2 could be detected in particulate matter trapped on 0.22 µm filters 3 h after air sampling, and the only contaminated areas were those near patient zones. CONCLUSIONS: The results confirm the possibility of finding this virus in floating particulate matter in contaminated zones, with a simple and economic sampling method based on filtration technology through 0.22 µm pores and detection with molecular techniques (RT-PCR). The higher risk zones were those near patients with COVID-19.","López, Jorge Hernández; Romo, Álvaro Santos; Molina, Daniel Coronado; Hernández, Gerardo Álvarez; Cureño, Ángel Benjamín Gutiérrez; Acosta, Magali Avilés; Gaxiola, Carlos Andrés Avilés; Félix, Marcos José Serrato; Galván, Teresa Gollas",Int J Infect Dis,420,5

Here, the model is based upon the well-known susceptible-infected-removed (SIR) model with the difference that a total population is not defined or kept constant per se and the number of susceptible individuals does not decline monotonically. To the contrary, as we show herein, it can be increased in surge periods! In particular, we investigate the time evolution of different populations and monitor diverse significant parameters for the spread of the disease in various communities, represented by China, South Korea, India, Australia, USA, Italy and the state of Texas in the USA. The SIR model can provide us with insights and predictions of the spread of the virus in communities that the recorded data alone cannot. Our work shows the importance of modelling the spread of COVID-19 by the SIR model that we propose here, as it can help to assess the impact of the disease by offering valuable predictions. Our analysis takes into account data from January to June, 2020, the period that contains the data before and during the implementation of strict and control measures. We propose predictions on various parameters related to the spread of COVID-19 and on the number of susceptible, infected and removed populations until September 2020. By comparing the recorded data with the data from our modelling approaches, we deduce that the spread of COVID-19 can be under control in all communities considered, if proper restrictions and strong policies are implemented to control the infection rates early from the spread of the disease.","Cooper, Ian; Mondal, Argha; Antonopoulos, Chris G.",Chaos Solitons Fractals,420,16

Further, the ligand binding site residues and non-covalent interactions between protein and ligand were used as an additional filter to identify phytochemical inhibitors that either bind to or form interactions with residues important for the specificity of the target proteases. This led to the identification of 96 inhibitors of TMPRSS2 and 9 inhibitors of cathepsin L among phytochemicals of Indian medicinal plants. Further, we have performed molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to analyze the stability of the protein-ligand complexes for the three top inhibitors of TMPRSS2 namely, qingdainone, edgeworoside C and adlumidine, and of cathepsin L namely, ararobinol, (+)-oxoturkiyenine and 3&#945;,17&#945;-cinchophylline. Interestingly, several herbal sources of identified phytochemical inhibitors have antiviral or anti-inflammatory use in traditional medicine. Further in vitro and in vivo testing is needed before clinical trials of the promising phytochemical inhibitors identified here.","Vivek-Ananth, R P; Rana, Abhijit; Rajan, Nithin; Biswal, Himansu S; Samal, Areejit",Molecules (Basel),420,16

Although coagulation dysfunction was reported to affect the severity of COVID-19, the association between pregnancy, which is usually accompanied by changes in coagulation function, and the worsening of COVID-19 is unknown. We present a case of a 30-year-old woman in the 36th week of pregnancy who was diagnosed with severe COVID-19 pneumonia and required postpartum extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) therapy. CASE REPORT A 30-year-old, 36-weeks pregnant woman presented to our hospital and was diagnosed with severe COVID-19 pneumonia soon after she had undergone a cesarean section. Her respiratory failure could not be managed by conventional therapeutic approaches. Therefore, ECMO was administered on day 7. Controlling coagulation function to maintain ECMO therapy was challenging. Nafamostat mesylate and cryoprecipitate were administered to treat the hypercoagulative status and severe hypofibrinogenemia, respectively. Since coagulopathy and her respiratory state improved, the ECMO therapy was terminated on day 15. CONCLUSIONS We report a case of severe COVID-19 pneumonia in a pregnant woman urgently treated with ECMO in the postpartum period. Thus, this case highlights the importance of close monitoring and appropriate medical care for pregnant women with severe COVID-19 pneumonia.","Takayama, Watatu; Endo, Akira; Yoshii, Junichiro; Arai, Hirokuni; Oi, Keiji; Nagaoka, Eiki; Toyama, Satoshi; Yamamoto, Hiroto; Uchida, Tokujiro; Otomo, Yasuhiro",Am J Case Rep,420,16

Atezolizumab monotherapy is an established treatment for recurrent NSCLC, and were reported to have a lower risk of pneumonitis than PD-1 inhibitors. This study aims to assess the safety and efficacy of atezolizumab monotherapy for pretreated advanced or recurrent NSCLC patients with idiopathic IP. METHODS: Advanced/recurrent NSCLC patients with comorbid idiopathic, chronic fibrotic IP with %forced vital capacity (FVC) of > 70% and no history of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) were enrolled. The patients received atezolizumab (1200 mg) every three weeks until the discontinuation criteria are met. The primary end point of this study is the one-year survival rate. A sample size of 38 patients was set. RESULTS: This study was terminated early due to high incidence of pneumonitis. Seventeen patients were enrolled, with a median age of 70 years. The median %FVC and %diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide at baseline were 85.4% and 54.4%, respectively. The incidence of pneumonitis was 29.4% (5/17) for all grade, 23.5% (4/17) for grade &#8805; 3, and 5.9% (1/17) for grade 5. 57.1% (4/7) of patients with honeycomb lung developed grade &#8805;3 pneumonitis, whereas only one patient (10%) of grade 1 pneumonitis was found in patients without honeycomb lung (n=10). CONCLUSIONS: NSCLC patients with comorbid IP as defined by the selection criteria for this study may have an increased risk of ICI-induced pneumonitis.","Ikeda, Satoshi; Kato, Terufumi; Kenmotsu, Hirotsugu; Ogura, Takashi; Iwasawa, Shunichiro; Sato, Yuki; Harada, Toshiyuki; Kubota, Kaoru; Tokito, Takaaki; Okamoto, Isamu; Furuya, Naoki; Yokoyama, Toshihide; Hosokawa, Shinobu; Iwasawa, Tae; Yamanaka, Takeharu; Okamoto, Hiroaki",J. thorac. oncol,420,26

Those behaviors include 1) covering the nose and mouth with a mask to protect others from possible infection when in public settings and when around persons who live outside of one's household or around ill household members; 2) maintaining at least 6 feet (2 meters) of distance from persons who live outside one's household, and keeping oneself distant from persons who are ill; and 3) washing hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, or, if soap and water are not available, using hand sanitizer containing at least 60% alcohol (1). Age has been positively associated with mask use (2), although less is known about other recommended mitigation behaviors. Monitoring mitigation behaviors over the course of the pandemic can inform targeted communication and behavior modification strategies to slow the spread of COVID-19. The Data Foundation COVID Impact Survey collected nationally representative data on reported mitigation behaviors during April-June 2020 among adults in the United States aged &#8805;18 years (3). Reported use of face masks increased from 78% in April, to 83% in May, and reached 89% in June; however, other reported mitigation behaviors (e.g., hand washing, social distancing, and avoiding public or crowded places) declined marginally or remained unchanged. At each time point, the prevalence of reported mitigation behaviors was lowest among younger adults (aged 18-29 years) and highest among older adults (aged &#8805;60 years). Lower engagement in mitigation behaviors among younger adults might be one reason for the increased incidence of confirmed COVID-19 cases in this group, which have been shown to precede increases among those >60 years (4). These findings underscore the need to prioritize clear, targeted messaging and behavior modification interventions, especially for young adults, to encourage uptake and support maintenance of recommended mitigation behaviors to prevent the spread of COVID-19.","Hutchins, Helena J; Wolff, Brent; Leeb, Rebecca; Ko, Jean Y; Odom, Erika; Willey, Joe; Friedman, Allison; Bitsko, Rebecca H",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,420,6

Complications may arise or severity may increase in cancer patients due to restrictions imposed by respective authorities as an effort to control COVID-19. The impact may vary from patient to patient and factors may include a delay in diagnosis, difficulty managing both cancer therapy and COVID-19 at same time, troubles in routine monitoring of cancer patients, and delays in urgent surgical procedures and patient care.

Distinctive microvascular abnormalities in COVID-19 include endothelial inflammation, disruption of intercellular junctions and microthrombi formation. A distinct COVID-19-associated coagulopathy along with increased cytokines and activation of platelets, endothelium and complement occur in COVID-19, which is more frequent with worsening disease severity. This proinflammatory milieu may result in immunothrombosis, a host defence mechanism that can become dysregulated, leading to excess formation of immunologically mediated thrombi which predominantly affect the microvasculature. The haemostatic and immune systems are intricately linked, and multifactorial processes are likely to contribute to VTE and immunothrombosis in COVID-19. This state-of-the-art review will explore the pathobiological mechanisms of immunothrombosis and VTE in COVID-19 focusing on: COVID-19-associated coagulopathy, pathology, endothelial dysfunction and haemostasis, the immune system and thrombosis, genetic associations and additional thrombotic mechanisms.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the incidence of COVID-19 among youth soccer athletes and the risk mitigation practices utilized by youth soccer organizations. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort. PARTICIPANTS: Youth soccer club directors throughout the United States. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Surveys were completed in late August 2020 regarding phase of return to soccer (individual only, group non-contact, group contact), date of reinitiation, number of players, cases of COVID-19, and risk reduction procedures being implemented. Case and incidence rates were compared to national pediatric data and county data from the prior 10 weeks. A negative binomial regression model was developed to predict club COVID-19 cases with local incidence rate and phase of return as covariates and the log of club player-days as an offset. RESULTS: 124 respondents had reinitiated soccer, representing 91,007 players with a median duration of 73 days (IQR: 53-83 days) since restarting. Of the 119 that had progressed to group activities, 218 cases of COVID-19 were reported among 85,861 players. Youth soccer players had a lower case rate and incidence rate than children in the US (254 v. 477 cases per 100,000; incidence rate ratio [IRR]=0.511, 95% CI = [0.40-0.57], p<0.001) and the general population from the counties where data was available (268 v. 864 cases per 100,000; IRR=0.202 [0.19-0.21], p<0.001). After adjusting for local COVID-19 incidence, there was no relationship between club COVID-19 incidence and phase of return (non-contact: b=0.35±0.67, p=0.61; contact: b=0.18±0.67, p=0.79). Soccer clubs reported utilizing a median of 8 (IQR: 6-10) risk reduction procedures. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of COVID-19 among youth soccer athletes is relatively low when compared to the background incidence among children in the United States in summer of 2020. No relationship was identified between club COVID-19 incidence and phase of return to soccer.","Watson, Andrew M; Haraldsdottir, Kristin; Biese, Kevin; Goodavish, Leslie; Stevens, Bethany; McGuine, Timothy",J. athl. train,420,24
444369,444369,444369,Severe asthma at COVID-19 time: what is new on biologic therapies,16.8818,6.2211647,2021,"BACKGROUND: Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, social distancing, self-quarantining, wearing masks, and washing hands have become part of the new norm for many, but not all. It appears that such preventive measures are critical to ""flattening the curve"" of the spread of COVID-19. The public's adoption of such behaviors is an essential component in the battle against what has been referred to as the ""invisible enemy."" OBJECTIVE: The primary objective of this study was to develop a model for predicting COVID-19 preventive behaviors among US college students. The Health Belief Model has a long history of use and empirical support in predicting preventive health behaviors, but it is not without its purported shortcomings. This study identifies a more optimal and defensible combination of variables to explain preventive behaviors among college students. This segment of the US population is critical in helping slow the spread of COVID-19 because of the relative reluctance of college students to perform the needed behaviors given they do not feel susceptible to or fearful of COVID-19. METHODS: For this study, 415 US college students were surveyed via Qualtrics and asked to answer questions regarding their fear of COVID-19, information receptivity (seeking relevant information), perceived knowledge of the disease, self-efficacy, and performance of preventive behaviors. The PROCESS macro (Model 6) was used to test our conceptual model, including predictions involving sequential mediation. RESULTS: Sequential mediation results show that fear of COVID-19 leads individuals to seek out information regarding the disease, which increases their perceived knowledge and fosters self-efficacy; this is key to driving preventive behaviors. CONCLUSIONS: Self-imposed preventive measures can drastically impact the rate of infection among populations. Based on this study's newly created sequential mediation model, communication strategies for encouraging COVID-19 preventive behaviors are offered. It is clear that college students, and very possibly adults of all ages, must have a healthy fear of COVID-19 to set in motion a process where concerned individuals seek out COVID-19-related information, increasing their store of knowledge concerning the disease, their self-efficacy, and ultimately their likelihood of performing the needed preventive behaviors.","Roberts, James A; David, Meredith E",J Med Internet Res,420,9

This study aims at comparatively analyzing COVID-19's effect on cancer care from both patient and provider perspectives. METHODS: A multi-institutional survey was developed to assess COVID-19-specific concerns regarding treatment, safety, and emotional stress through 5-point Likert-type prompts and open-ended questions before and during the pandemic. Wilcoxon signed-rank and rank-sum tests were used to analyze before/during answers for providers and patients independently. Open-ended responses were assessed using inductive thematic analysis. RESULTS: The survey was completed by 104 (69.3%) patients and 50 (50%) providers. Patients demonstrated a significant change in only 1 of 15 Likert prompts. Most significant were increased concern regarding susceptibility to infection [z = 2.536, p = 0.011] and concerns regarding their cancer outcome [z = 4.572, p < 0.001]. Non-physician providers demonstrated significant change in 8 of 13 Likert prompts, whereas physicians had all 13 Likert prompts change in the COVID-19 setting. Physicians believed care to be more poorly planned [z = -3.857, p &#8804; 0.001], availability of protective personal equipment to be more limited [z = -4.082, p < 0.001], and were significantly concerned infecting family members [z = 4.965, p < 0.001]. CONCLUSIONS: While patients had more difficulty coping with their cancer, they did not perceive significant differences in their actual treatment. This suggests the need for a renewed focus on patients coping with cancer. Among providers, physicians more than any other provider group had a strong negative perception of COVID-19's impact on healthcare, suggesting the need for novel approaches to target physician burnout.","Salehi, Omid; Alarcon, Sylvia V; Vega, Eduardo A; Kutlu, Onur C; Kozyreva, Olga; Chan, Jennifer A; Kazakova, Vera; Harz, Dominique; Conrad, Claudius",J. gastrointest. surg,420,29

Our study aimed to evaluate the physiological (i.e., JIP-test) and phytochemical response of spinach baby leaves grown with regular or mildly saline (40 mM NaCl) nutrient solution and irradiated by four light-emitting diodes (LEDs) with broad spectra. T1 (highest red and far-red, low blue) and T3 (high red, balanced blue, green and far-red) led to a better developed photosynthetic apparatus compared to T2 (red peak in 631 nm) and T4 (highest blue and green), highlighted by PIABS and its structural components: RC/ABS, φP0, ψE0, and ΔVIP. Elevated salinity only affected the latter parameter. T1 induced the maximum yield production but also the highest nitrate content which was far below the maximum level permitted by European legislation. Regardless of salinity level, T3 enhanced total phenol, chlorophyll, and carotenoid content. T2 and T4 led to inferior nutritional quality. Non-saline nutrient solution promoted the chlorophyll and carotenoid contents and the antioxidant potential, regardless of light treatment. By contrast, soluble sugar content was enhanced by saline nutrient solution.

As of 12 April 2020, this outbreak has spread to more than 210 countries and territories and caused 108,837 deaths. The development of this outbreak has resulted in the closure of several major cities in the world (such as Wuhan, Daegu, and Manila) to country-wide lockdowns as observed in Italy and Malaysia. This also affects the construction sector as a labor-intensive industry. Force majeure has become one of the critical points of discussion, considering that this provision allows a contract party to hinder from fulfilling its obligations on the grounds that events are beyond a party’s control. Nevertheless, the application of this provision often faces challenges considering that in prior legal cases, the Courts tend to interpret this clause narrowly. Thus, it would be problematic when the force majeure clause does not include an epidemic outbreak as a force majeure event in the contract. This paper aims to explore the potential of the COVID-19 outbreak as a force majeure event in construction contracts. A qualitative approach consisting of two-step interdependent methods was done to highlight the fundamental elements of force majeure and to analyze whether the COVID-19 outbreak constitutes a force majeure event or not. Finally, a decision model was developed to assist the contracting parties in determining the COVID-19 outbreak potential as a force majeure event. This paper contributes since research related to the impacts of epidemic or pandemic outbreaks on the construction industry has not been intensified.","Hansen, Seng",Journal Of The Civil Engineering Forum,420,24

Breast Cancer (BC) patients are concerned both with BC treatment and COVID-19. This study aimed to estimate the impact of anxiety among patients, caused by the spreading of COVID-19. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between the 16th of January and the 20th of March 2020, we retrospectively enrolled 160 patients. Eighty-two patients with a suspected breast lesion (SBL) were divided into two groups: PRE-COVID-19-SBL and POST-COVID-19-SBL. Seventy-eight BC patients were divided into PRE-COVID-19-BC and POST-COVID-19-BC. Patient characteristics including age, marital status, SBL/BC diameter, personal and family history of BC, clinical stage and molecular subtype were recorded. Procedure Refusal (PR) and Surgical Refusal (SR) were also recorded with their reason. RESULTS: BC and SBL analysis showed no difference in pre-treatment characteristics (p>0.05).

SARS-CoV-2 causes COVID-19 disease which may present with mild, moderate, or severe illness. In severe cases, pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis, and septic shock can occur. Individuals above 60 years and people with preexisting comorbidities are at higher risk for developing serious complications. The incubation period of this new pathogen ranges from 1 to 14 days and there is no preexisting immunity to the disease. Countries across the globe have adopted various prevention and control measures to minimize negative health impacts. India has adopted various public health measures which include social distancing measures, nationwide lockdown to reduce risk of exposure, widespread IEC messaging regarding hand-washing, usage of masks, and recommending avoidance of unnecessary travel to combat the spread of disease. This manuscript reviews the global situation, contextualizes India's disease control efforts, and outlines the possible way forward by identifying specific actions under the following headings: enhancing district preparedness, enabling care for patients, and broadening community and stakeholder engagement for India.","Zodpey, Sanjay; Negandhi, Himanshu; Dua, Aman; Vasudevan, Akshaya; Raja, Mitali",Indian J.

In Hong Kong, low socioeconomic districts were the epicentres of third-wave outbreak of COVID-19 in July and August 2020, suggesting that people from low socioeconomic class are vulnerable groups. Socially disadvantaged people are relatively more vulnerable to the physical, mental, and social impacts of infectious diseases. To achieve more effective infection control, the social determinants of health and existing health inequalities should be identified, and understanding the experiences of socially disadvantaged groups in the COVID-19 outbreak will be beneficial to health authorities in formulating a responsive infection control policy targeting the needs of the socially disadvantaged. This article investigates the experiences of economically disadvantaged groups during the COVID-19 outbreak and examines how they were further disadvantaged in the outbreak by delineating how health inequality intersected with social inequality. In-depth, semistructured interviews were conducted from February to April 2020 with 35 participants from the poverty class in Hong Kong. The high prices of surgical face masks and disinfecting products as well as the economic impacts induced by COVID-19-related social distancing policies imposed severe economic burden on the participants. In addition to economic and housing deprivation, social inequality was closely associated with health inequality, which made the participants more vulnerable to infection. Social inequality is associated with and can worsen health inequality. Here, the participants, who were of low socioeconomic status were more disadvantaged in health and in the attainment of social resources such as employment, education, face masks, disinfection products and right to use public facilities, during the COVID-19 outbreak. All these elements may have interrelated effects and in turn limit accessibility to healthcare and lead to less positive health outcomes and consequently to health inequality.","Siu, Judy Yuen-Man",Heal. soc. care community,420,1

A significant proportion of patients who require intubation succumb to the disease, despite the availability of ventilators and the best treatment practices. Researchers worldwide are in search of anti-inflammatory medicines in the hope of finding a cure for COVID-19. Low-level laser therapy (LLLT) has strong, anti-inflammatory effects confirmed by meta-analyses, and it may be therapeutic to ARDS. LLLT has been used for pain management, wound healing, and other health conditions by physicians, physiotherapists, and nurses worldwide for decades. In addition, it has been used in veterinary medicine for respiratory tract disease such as pneumonia. Laser light with low-power intensity is applied to the surface of the skin to produce local and systemic effects. Based on the clinical experience, peer-reviewed studies, and solid laboratory data in experimental animal models, LLLT attenuates cytokine storm at multiple levels and reduces the major inflammatory metabolites. LLLT is a safe, effective, low-cost modality without any side-effects that may be combined with conventional treatment of ARDS. We summarize the effects of LLLT on pulmonary inflammation and we provide a protocol for augmenting medical treatment in COVID-19 patients. LLLT combined with conventional medical therapy has the potential to prevent the progression of COVID-19, minimize the length of time needed on a ventilator, enhance the healing process, and shorten recovery time.","Mokmeli, Soheila; Vetrici, Mariana",Can J Respir Ther,420,16

Furthermore, vaccines that are safe, cost-effective, and logistic-friendly are critically needed for global equity, especially for middle- to low-income countries. Recombinant protein-based subunit vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 have been reported using the receptor-binding domain (RBD) and the prefusion spike trimers (S-2P). Recently, a new version of prefusion spike trimers, named HexaPro, has been shown to possess two RBD in the “up” conformation, due to its physical property, as opposed to just one exposed RBD found in S-2P. Importantly, this HexaPro spike antigen is more stable than S-2P, raising its feasibility for global logistics and supply chain. Here, we report that the spike protein HexaPro offers a promising candidate for the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. Mice immunized by the recombinant HexaPro adjuvanted with aluminum hydroxide using a prime-boost regimen produced high-titer neutralizing antibodies for up to 56 days after initial immunization against live SARS-CoV-2 infection. Also, the level of neutralization activity is comparable to that of convalescence sera. Our results indicate that the HexaPro subunit vaccine confers neutralization activity in sera collected from mice receiving the prime-boost regimen.","Seephetdee, Chotiwat Buasri Nattawut Bhukhai Kanit Srisanga Kitima Manopwisedjaroen Suwimon Lertjintanakit Sarat Phueakphud Nut Pakiranay Chatbenja Kangwanrangsan Niwat Srichatrapimuk Sirawat Kirdlarp Suppachok Sungkanuparph Somnuek Chutipongtanate Somchai Thitithanyanont Arunee Hongeng Suradej Wongtrakoongate Patompon",Vaccines,420,29

Herein, we show that PRMT1 methylates SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) protein at residues R95 and R177 within RGG/RG motifs, preferred PRMT target sequences. We confirmed arginine methylation of N protein by immunoblotting viral proteins extracted from SARS-CoV-2 virions isolated from cell culture. Type I PRMT inhibitor (MS023) or substitution of R95 or R177 with lysine inhibited interaction of N protein with the 5'-UTR of SARS-CoV-2 genomic RNA, a property required for viral packaging. We also defined the N protein interactome in HEK293 cells, which identified PRMT1 and many of its RGG/RG substrates, including the known interacting protein G3BP1 as well as other components of stress granules (SGs), which are part of the host antiviral response. Methylation of R95 regulated the ability of N protein to suppress the formation of SGs, as R95K substitution or MS023 treatment blocked N-mediated suppression of SGs. Also, the coexpression of methylarginine reader Tudor domain-containing protein 3 quenched N protein-mediated suppression of SGs in a dose-dependent manner. Finally, pretreatment of VeroE6 cells with MS023 significantly reduced SARS-CoV-2 replication. Because type I PRMT inhibitors are already undergoing clinical trials for cancer treatment, inhibiting arginine methylation to target the later stages of the viral life cycle such as viral genome packaging and assembly of virions may represent an additional therapeutic application of these drugs.","Cai, Ting; Yu, Zhenbao; Wang, Zhen; Liang, Chen; Richard, Stéphane",J Biol Chem,420,33

Drug-induced QTc prolongation is a known adverse reaction of hydroxychloroquine, especially during chronic treatment. However, when administered concurrently with potential pro-arrhythmic drugs such as protease inhibitors, the risk of QTc prolongation imposed on these patients is not known. We aim to investigate the incidence of QTc prolongation events and potential factors associated with its occurrence in COVID-19 population. METHODS: We included 446 SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR-positive patients taking at least one treatment drug for COVID-19 within a period of one month (March-April 2020). In addition to COVID-19-related treatment (HCQ/PI), concomitant drugs with risks of QTc prolongation were considered. We defined QTc prolongation as QTc interval of &#8805;470 ms in postpubertal males, and &#8805;480 ms in postpubertal females. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: QTc prolongation events occurred in 28/446 (6.3%) patients with an incidence rate of 1 case per 100 person-days. A total of 26/28 (93%) patients who had prolonged QTc intervals received at least two pro-QT drugs. Multivariate analysis showed that HCQ and PI combination therapy had five times higher odds of QTc prolongation as compared to HCQ-only therapy after controlling for age, cardiovascular disease, SIRS and the use of concurrent QTc-prolonging agents besides HCQ and/or PI (OR 5.2; 95% CI, 1.11-24.49; p = 0.036). Independent of drug therapy, presence of SIRS resulted in four times higher odds of QTc prolongation (OR 4.3; 95% CI, 1.66-11.06; p = 0.003). In HCQ-PI combination group, having concomitant pro-QT drugs led to four times higher odds of QTc prolongation (OR 3.8; 95% CI, 1.53-9.73; p = 0.004). Four patients who had prolonged QTc intervals died but none were cardiac-related deaths. WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION: In our cohort, hydroxychloroquine monotherapy had low potential to increase QTc intervals. However, when given concurrently with protease inhibitors which have possible or conditional risk, the odds of QTc prolongation increased fivefold. Interestingly, independent of drug therapy, the presence of systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) resulted in four times higher odds of QTc prolongation, leading to the postulation that some QTc events seen in COVID-19 patients may be due to the disease itself. ECG monitoring should be continued for at least a week from the initiation of treatment.","Koh, Hui Moon; Chong, Pei Feng; Tan, Ju Nee; Chidambaram, Suresh Kumar; Chua, Hiu Jian",J Clin Pharm Ther,420,24

Although the Department of Veterans Affairs is a leading provider of telehealth, disparities may exist in reaching older veterans living in rural areas. VA Video Connect (VVC) is a video conferencing app that enables veterans to connect with their health care provider via a secure and private session. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to examine the capability and willingness of older veterans to participate in a VVC visit during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted on older veterans (N=118) at the Central Arkansas Veterans Healthcare System. Participants were interviewed over the phone and responses to the following items were recorded: availability of internet, email, and an electronic device with a camera; veterans' willingness to complete an appointment via a VVC visit; and availability of assistance from a caregiver for those who were unable to participate in a VVC visit alone. RESULTS: Participants' mean age was 72.6 (SD 8.3) years, 92% (n=108) were male, 69% (n=81) were Caucasian, 30% (n=35) were African Americans, and 36% (n=42) lived in a rural location. The majority reported having access to the internet (n=93, 77%) and email service (n=83, 70%), but only 56% (n=67) had a camera-equipped device. Overall, 53% (n=63) were willing and capable of participating in a VVC visit. The availability of internet access was significantly lower in rural compared to nonrural participants (P=.045) and in those with or less than a high school education compared to those who pursued higher education (P=.02). Willingness to participate in the VVC visit was significantly lower in rural compared to nonrural participants (P=.03). Of the participants who reported they were able and willing to partake in a VVC visit (n=54), 65% (n=35) opted for VVC and 35% (n=19) preferred a phone visit.

Although the Department of Veterans Affairs is a leading provider of telehealth, disparities may exist in reaching older veterans living in rural areas. VA Video Connect (VVC) is a video conferencing app that enables veterans to connect with their health care provider via a secure and private session. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to examine the capability and willingness of older veterans to participate in a VVC visit during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted on older veterans (N=118) at the Central Arkansas Veterans Healthcare System. Participants were interviewed over the phone and responses to the following items were recorded: availability of internet, email, and an electronic device with a camera; veterans' willingness to complete an appointment via a VVC visit; and availability of assistance from a caregiver for those who were unable to participate in a VVC visit alone. RESULTS: Participants' mean age was 72.6 (SD 8.3) years, 92% (n=108) were male, 69% (n=81) were Caucasian, 30% (n=35) were African Americans, and 36% (n=42) lived in a rural location. The majority reported having access to the internet (n=93, 77%) and email service (n=83, 70%), but only 56% (n=67) had a camera-equipped device. Overall, 53% (n=63) were willing and capable of participating in a VVC visit. The availability of internet access was significantly lower in rural compared to nonrural participants (P=.045) and in those with or less than a high school education compared to those who pursued higher education (P=.02). Willingness to participate in the VVC visit was significantly lower in rural compared to nonrural participants (P=.03). Of the participants who reported they were able and willing to partake in a VVC visit (n=54), 65% (n=35) opted for VVC and 35% (n=19) preferred a phone visit. In total, 77% (n=27) of the scheduled VVC visits were successful. CONCLUSIONS: Despite advances in technology, and willingness on the part of health care systems, there are some lingering issues with capability and willingness to participate in video telehealth visits, particularly among older adults residing in rural areas.","Padala, Kalpana P; Wilson, Kerrie B; Gauss, C Heath; Stovall, Jessica D; Padala, Prasad R",J Med Internet Res,420,16

The economic efficiency of an agricultural enterprise depends to a large extent on the efficiency of its personnel. In our opinion, human resources are one of the most important resources in the agricultural business. In this paper, we considered the use of grading to motivate employees of an agricultural enterprise. In our opinion, this will assist in the formation of a clear and transparent system of payment for work activities for the company's employees and, in addition, will optimize the size of the company's employee compensation fund. The system of management of labor resources of the agricultural enterprise should take into account the personality of the employee, knowledge of his features of motivation, and also be combined with the goals and objectives that the enterprise has. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2021.","Yekimov, S.; Otroshchenko, N.; Voytsekhovska, Y.; Nakhod, S.; Gavrilko, T.","2021 International Scientific and Practical Conference on Fundamental and Applied Research in Biology and Agriculture: Current Issues, Achievements and Innovations, FARBA 2021",420,16

An increasing number of clinical trials have been registered to evaluate the effects of TCM for COVID-19. The aim of this study was to review the existing TCM clinical trial registrations and identify potentially promising and available TCM therapies, in order to provide a reference for the global management of COVID-19. Methods: All clinical trials on TCM for COVID-19 registered in registry platforms worldwide were searched. The data of registration temporal trend, design, objective, interventions, and relevant information were reviewed and summarized. Results: 161 TCM trials were identified from three registries (January 26 to May 14 2020). Of these, 94 (58.4%) were randomized controlled trials and 114 trials (70.8%) assessed therapeutic effects; while the remainder focused on prevention, rehabilitation, and the epidemiology of TCM syndromes. Eight trials (5.0%) had completed their recruitment. TCM interventions with potential for further evaluation in terms of prevention were moxibustion, Huoxiang Zhengqi pill and Jinye Baidu granules. For treatment of COVID-19, Qingfei Paidu decoction, Huashi Baidu decoction, Lianhua Qingwen capsules, Toujie Quwen granules and Xiyanping injection, and Xuebijing injection were to be tested for their therapeutic effects and symptoms relief. For rehabilitation, Tai Chi and Liuzijue were to be tested for improving patients' lung function. Conclusion: Some potentially promising TCM interventions have been identified and deserve further evaluation to establish their evidence base, particularly on populations outside of China.","Luo, Hui; Yang, Ming; Tang, Qiao-Ling; Hu, Xiao-Yang; Willcox, Merlin L; Liu, Jian-Ping",Eur J Integr Med,420,1

The molecular diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection is based on the detection of viral RNA on different biological specimens. Unfortunately, the test may require several hours to be performed. In the present study, we evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of lung point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) for SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia in a cohort of symptomatic patients admitted to one emergency department (ED) in a high-prevalence setting. This retrospective study enrolled all patients who visited one ED with suspected respiratory infection in March 2020. All the patients were tested (usually twice if the first was negative) for SARS-CoV-2 on ED admission. The reference standard was considered positive if at least one specimen was positive. If all the specimens tested negative, the reference was considered negative. Diagnostic accuracy was evaluated using sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive value. Of the 444 symptomatic patients who were admitted to the ED in the study period, the result of the lung POCUS test was available for 384 (86.5%). The sensitivity of the test was 92.0% (95% CI 88.2-94.9%), and the specificity was 64.9% (95% CI 54.6-74.4%). We observed a prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection of 74.7%. In this setting, the positive and negative predicted values were 88.6% (95% CI 84.4-92.0) and 73.3% (95% CI 62.6-82.2%), respectively. Lung POCUS is a sensitive first-line screening tool for ED patients presenting with symptoms suggestive of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Sorlini, Cristina; Femia, Marco; Nattino, Giovanni; Bellone, Pietro; Gesu, Elisa; Francione, Paolo; Paternò, Michele; Grillo, Pasquale; Ruffino, Aurora; Bertolini, Guido; Cariati, Maurizio; Cortellaro, Francesca",Intern. emerg. med,420,16

The main goal of this study is to develop a more effective method for diagnosing and predicting the COVID-19 spread and to evaluate the effectiveness of control measures to reduce and stop the virus spread. To this end, the COVID-19 Decision-Making System (CDMS) was developed to study disease transmission. CDMS divides the population into groups as susceptible, infected, cured and dead. The trends of the people's number in these groups have deterministic and stochastic components. The deterministic components are described by a differential equations system with parameters determined by the data reported. The stochastic components are represented as an indicator of instability that characterizes the tendency of COVID-19 spread. The simulation experiments have shown a good agreement between the CDMS estimates and the data reported in Russia and Greece. The analysis performed showed that the newly-introduced instability indicator may be the precursor to the pandemic dynamics. In this context, our results showed three potential candidates for a second wave of COVID-19 disease: USA, Russia and Brazil. Although the proportion of infected individuals in countries with high temperatures is lower than in European countries and Russia, temperature and humidity are slowly affecting the effects of the pandemic. Finally, the results presented may contribute to the urgent need to reduce the risks associated with the second wave of the COVID-19, to improve public health intervention and safety measures to be taken by various countries.","Varotsos, Costas A; Krapivin, Vladimir F",Saf Sci,420,1

We conclude that LA positivity is a feature of COVID-19, at least in some patients, and potentially those who are the sickest or have the most severe infection. However, many publications have failed to appropriately consider the many confounders to LA identification, being assessed using clot-based assays such as the dilute Russell viper venom time, the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), and the silica clotting time. First, most patients hospitalized with COVID-19 are placed on anticoagulant therapy, and those with prior histories of thrombosis would possibly present to hospital already on anticoagulant therapy. All anticoagulants, including vitamin K antagonists, heparin (both unfractionated heparin and low-molecular-weight heparin), and direct oral anticoagulants affect these clot-based assays. Second, C-reactive protein (CRP) is highly elevated in COVID-19 patients, and also associated with severity. CRP can also lead to false-positive LA, particularly with the aPTT assay. Third, persistence of aPL positivity (including LA) is required to identify APS. Fourth, those at greatest risk of thrombosis due to aPL are those with highest titers or multiple positivity. Most publications either did not identify anticoagulation and/or CRP in their COVID-19 cohorts or did not seem to account for these as possible confounders for LA detection. Most publications did not assess for aPL persistence, and where persistence was checked, LA appeared to represent transient aPL. Finally, high titer aPL or multiple aPL positivity were in the minority of COVID-19 presentations. Thus, at least some of the reported LAs associated with COVID-19 are likely to be false positives, and the relationship between the detected aPL/LA and COVID-19-associated coagulopathy remains to be resolved using larger and better studies.","Favaloro, Emmanuel J; Henry, Brandon Michael; Lippi, Giuseppe",Semin. thromb. hemost,420,2

Since then, the disease has spread throughout the country, reaching the poorest areas. This study analyzes the relationship between COVID-19 and the population's living conditions. We aimed to identify social determinants related to the incidence, mortality, and case fatality rate of COVID-19 in Brazil, in 2020. METHODS: This is an ecological study evaluating the relationship between COVID-19 incidence, mortality, and case fatality rates and 49 social indicators of human development and social vulnerability. For the analysis, bivariate spatial correlation and multivariate and spatial regression models (spatial lag model and spatial error models) were used, considering a 95% confidence interval and a significance level of 5%. RESULTS: A total of 44.8% of municipalities registered confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 14.7% had deaths. We observed that 56.2% of municipalities with confirmed cases had very low human development (COVID-19 incidence rate: 59.00/100 000; mortality rate: 36.75/1 000 000), and 52.8% had very high vulnerability (COVID-19 incidence rate: 41.68/100 000; mortality rate: 27.46/1 000 000). The regression model showed 17 indicators associated with transmission of COVID-19 in Brazil. CONCLUSIONS: Although COVID-19 first arrived in the most developed and least vulnerable municipalities in Brazil, it has already reached locations that are farther from large urban centers, whose populations are exposed to a context of intense social vulnerability. Based on these findings, it is necessary to adopt measures that take local social aspects into account in order to contain the pandemic.","de Souza, Carlos Dornels Freire; Machado, Michael Ferreira; do Carmo, Rodrigo Feliciano",Infect Dis Poverty,420,29

Patients with pulmonary diseases in the COVID-19 pandemic period were analyzed. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Non-COVID-19 cases who were hospitalized in the pulmonology clinic, outpatients, and patients who applied to the non-COVID-19 emergency service and requested a pulmonology consultation in the period from March 16, 2020 to May 15, 2020 and in the same period of the previous year (i.e., from March 16, 2019 to May 15, 2019) were included in this study. RESULTS: In the pandemic period, it was found that there was an 84% decrease in outpatient admissions, a 43% decrease in inpatients, and a 75% decrease in emergency services. During the pandemic period, in outpatient setting, male and younger case admissions increased, admissions with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and interstitial lung diseases decreased, whereas the frequency of admission to asthma, pneumonia, and pulmonary thromboembolism increased. In the period of the pandemic, patients with asthma, COPD, and lung cancer were less hospitalized, whereas patients with pulmonary thromboembolism, pneumonia, and pleural effusion were hospitalized more. In non-COVID-19 patient treatments during the pandemic period, usage of a metered dose inhaler increased. CONCLUSION: During the COVID-19 pandemic, non-COVID pulmonary pathologies decreased significantly, and there was a change in the profile of the patients. From now on, to be prepared for pandemic and similar extraordinary situations, to organize hospitals for the epidemic, to determine health institutions to which nonepidemic patients can apply, to make necessary plans in order not to neglect the nonepidemic patients, and to develop digital health service methods, especially telemedicine, would be appropriate.","Sevinç, Can; Tertemiz, Kemal Can; Atik, Merve; Güler, Nurcan; Ulusoy, Mustafa; Coskun, Figen; Uyar, Nezihe; Ellidokuz, Hülya; Itil, Oya; Cimrin, Arif Hikmet; Uçan, Eyup Sabri",Turk Thorac J,420,20

In NLR resistance genes, the toll/interleukin-1 receptor (TIR)-NB-LRRs (TNLs) are an important subfamily out of which approximately half members carry a post-LRR (PL) domain of unknown role. We first investigated the requirement of the PL domain for TNL-mediated immune response by mutating the most conserved amino acids across PL domains of Arabidopsis thaliana TNLs. We identified several amino acids in the PL domain of RPS4 required for its ability to trigger a hypersensitive response to AvrRps4 in N. tabacum transient assay. Mutating the corresponding amino acids within the PL domain of the tobacco TNL gene N also affected its function. Consequently, our results indicate that the integrity of the PL domain at conserved positions is crucial for at least two unrelated TNLs. We then tested the PL domain specificity for function by swapping PL domains between the paralogs RPS4 and RPS4B. Our results suggest that the PL domain is involved in their TNL pair specificity, 'off state' stability and NLR complex activation. Considering genetically paired Arabidopsis TNLs, we finally compared the PL and TIR domains of their sensor and executor sequences, respectively. While TIR and PL domains from executors present complete motifs, sensors showed a lack of conservation with degenerated motifs. We provide here a first contribution to the functional analysis of the PL domain in order to decipher its role for TNLs' function.","Saucet, Simon Bernard; Esmenjaud, Daniel; Van Ghelder, Cyril",Mol. plant-microb. interact,420,10

The DNA DSB response and repair is facilitated by hierarchical signaling networks that orchestrate chromatin structural changes specifically histone modifications which impact cell-cycle checkpoints through enzymatic activities to repair the broken DNA ends. Various histone posttranslational modifications such as phosphorylation, acetylation, methylation and ubiquitylation have been shown to play a role in DNA damage repair. Recent studies have provided important insights into the role of histone-specific modifications in sensing DNA damage and facilitating the DNA repair. Histone modifications have been shown to determine the pathway choice for repair of DNA DSBs.

These changes create both challenges and opportunities for medical students and radiation oncology residency programs. We conducted a comprehensive needs assessment to prepare for a virtual recruitment season, including a focus group of senior medical students seeking careers in oncology. Methods: A single 1.5-hour focus group was conducted with 10 third- and fourth-year medical students using Zoom videoconferencing software. Participants shared opinions relating to visibility of residency programs, virtual clerkship experiences, expectations for program websites, and remote interviews. The focus group recording was transcribed and analyzed independently by 2 authors. Participants' statements were abstracted into themes via inductive content analysis. Results: Inductive content analysis of the focus group transcript identified several potential challenges surrounding virtual recruitment, including learning the culture of a program and/or city, obtaining accurate information about training programs, and uncertainty surrounding the best way to present themselves during a virtual interview season. In the present environment, the focus group participants anticipate relying more on departmental websites and telecommunications since in-person interactions will be limited. In addition, students perceived that the educational yield of a virtual clerkship would be low, particularly if an in-person rotation had already been completed at another institution. Conclusion: With the COVID-19 crisis limiting visiting student rotations and programs transitioning to hosting remote interviews, we recommend programs focus resources towards portraying the culture of their program and city, accurately depicting program information, and offering virtual electives or virtual interaction to increase applicant exposure to residency program culture.","Everett, Ashlyn S; Strickler, Scott; Marcrom, Samuel R; McDonald, Andrew M",,420,4

The effect of statins on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is unclear. To investigate the association between statins and COVID-19 outcomes and, if possible, identify the subgroup population that benefits most from statin use. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A systematic review and meta-analysis of published studies that included statin users and described COVID-19 outcomes through 10 November 2020. This study used the generic inverse variance method to perform meta-analyses with random-effects modelling. The main outcomes were evaluation of the need for invasive mechanical ventilator (IMV) support, the need for intensive care unit (ICU) care and death. All outcomes were measured as dichotomous variables. RESULTS: A total of 28 observational studies, covering data from 63,537 individuals with COVID-19, were included. The use of statins was significantly associated with decreased mortality (odds ratio [OR] = 0.71, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.55-0.92, I2=72%) and the need for IMV (OR = 0.81, 95% CI: 0.69-0.95, I2=0%) but was not linked to the need for ICU care (OR = 0.91, 95% CI: 0.55-1.51, I2=66%). Subgroup analysis further identified five types of studies in which statin users had even lower odds of death. CONCLUSIONS: The use of statins was significantly associated with a reduced need for IMV and decreased mortality among individuals with COVID-19. Statins may not need to be discontinued because of concern for COVID-19 on admission. Further randomized controlled trial (RCTs) are needed to clarify the causal effect between statin use and severe COVID-19 outcomes.Key messagesParticipants in five types of studies were shown to have even lower odds of death when taking statins.The use of statins was significantly associated with a reduced need for invasive mechanical ventilation and decreased all-cause mortality among individuals with COVID-19.

In Alzheimer's disease (AD), the major form of dementia, ß-amyloid (Aß) levels in the blood are increased; however, the impact of elevated Aß levels on the progression of COVID-19 remains largely unknown. Here, our findings demonstrate that Aß1-42, but not Aß1-40, bound to various viral proteins with a preferentially high affinity for the spike protein S1 subunit (S1) of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the viral receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). These bindings were mainly through the C-terminal residues of Aß1-42. Furthermore, Aß1-42 strengthened the binding of the S1 of SARS-CoV-2 to ACE2 and increased the viral entry and production of IL-6 in a SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus infection model. Intriguingly, data from a surrogate mouse model with intravenous inoculation of Aß1-42 show that the clearance of Aß1-42 in the blood was dampened in the presence of the extracellular domain of the spike protein trimers of SARS-CoV-2, whose effects can be prevented by a novel anti-Aß antibody. In conclusion, these findings suggest that the binding of Aß1-42 to the S1 of SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2 may have a negative impact on the course and severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Further investigations are warranted to elucidate the underlying mechanisms and examine whether reducing the level of Aß1-42 in the blood is beneficial to the fight against COVID-19 and AD.","Hsu, John Tsu-An; Tien, Chih-Feng; Yu, Guann-Yi; Shen, Santai; Lee, Yi-Hsuan; Hsu, Pei-Chien; Wang, Yun; Chao, Po-Kuan; Tsay, Huey-Jen; Shie, Feng-Shiun",Int. j. mol. sci.

For small, medium, and large hospitals, the annum kWh for NP rooms were 116,700 kWh, 332,530 kWh, 795,675 kWh, which correspond to annum energy costs of $11,845 ($1,077/room), $33,752 ($1,534/room), and $80,761 ($1,836/room). For XP-UV, the annum-kilowatt-hours (and costs) were 438 ($45), 493 ($50), and 548 ($56) for small, medium, and large hospitals. While energy efficiencies may be expected for the large hospital, the hospital contained more energy-intensive use rooms (ICUs) which resulted in higher operational and energy costs. XP-UV had a greater reduction in secondary COVID-19 infections in large and medium hospitals. NP rooms had a greater reduction in secondary SARS-CoV-2 transmission in small hospitals. Early implementation of interventions can result in realized cost savings through reduced hospital-acquired infections.","Squire, Marietta M; Munsamy, Megashnee; Lin, Gary; Telukdarie, Arnesh; Igusa, Takeru",Energy Build,420,1

Opinion surveys identified the importance of political ideology in shaping perceptions of the pandemic and compliance with preventive measures. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to measure political partisanship and antiscience attitudes in the discussions about the pandemic on social media, as well as their geographic and temporal distributions. METHODS: We analyzed a large set of tweets from Twitter related to the pandemic, collected between January and May 2020, and developed methods to classify the ideological alignment of users along the moderacy (hardline vs moderate), political (liberal vs conservative), and science (antiscience vs proscience) dimensions. RESULTS: We found a significant correlation in polarized views along the science and political dimensions. Moreover, politically moderate users were more aligned with proscience views, while hardline users were more aligned with antiscience views. Contrary to expectations, we did not find that polarization grew over time; instead, we saw increasing activity by moderate proscience users. We also show that antiscience conservatives in the United States tended to tweet from the southern and northwestern states, while antiscience moderates tended to tweet from the western states. The proportion of antiscience conservatives was found to correlate with COVID-19 cases. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings shed light on the multidimensional nature of polarization and the feasibility of tracking polarized opinions about the pandemic across time and space through social media data.","Rao, Ashwin; Morstatter, Fred; Hu, Minda; Chen, Emily; Burghardt, Keith; Ferrara, Emilio; Lerman, Kristina",J Med Internet Res,420,20

This study assessed the efficacy of perioperative management of patients scheduled for gastrointestinal surgery during COVID-19 pandemic of 2020. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 188 patients who underwent gastrointestinal surgery during the COVID-19 outbreak in Jiaxing, China. Perioperative data were collected, including data on pre-, intra-, and postoperative management strategies. The same data over the same period in 2019 were also collected for comparison. RESULTS: A total of 117, 63, and 8 patients underwent emergency, semi-elective, and elective surgeries, respectively. The locals: nonlocals ratio was significantly higher during this investigation period in 2020 than during the same period in 2019 (P < .05). After screening, 12 patients were identified as unqualified. The number of gastrointestinal surgeries was reduced in 2020. There were no differences in the ratio of emergency surgery or semi-elective surgery between in 2020 and in 2019. The elective surgery ratio between January 27 and February 28 was found to be lower in 2020 than in 2019 (P < .05). The disease spectra of emergency surgery and semi-elective surgery were similar. A total of 31 elective surgeries were postponed. There were five cases of short-term complications for emergency surgeries and two cases of short-term complications for semi-elective surgeries. No long-term complications or COVID-19 infection occurred in any of the cases, and no medical staff member was infected. CONCLUSION: Perioperative management strategies minimize the risk of nosocomial infection and reduce the influence of epidemics on gastrointestinal surgery.","Zhou, Yuan; Cen, Lusha",Am Surg,420,20

Unsuccessful Approaches to COVID-19 in Western Society,16.812716,6.199832,2021,"PURPOSE: The vascular enlargement (VE) pattern differs from previously described imaging patterns for pneumonia. This study aimed to investigate the incidence, computed tomography (CT) characteristics, and diagnostic value of the VE pattern in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). METHOD: The CT data of 106 patients with COVID-19 from January 19 to February 29, 2020, and 52 patients with influenza virus pneumonia (IVP) from January 2018 to February 2020 were retrospectively collected. The incidences of the VE pattern between the two groups were compared. The CT manifestations of COVID-19 were analyzed with a particular focus on the VE pattern's specific CT signs, dynamic changes, and relationships with lesion size and disease severity. RESULTS: Peripheral and multilobar ground-glass opacities (GGOs) or mixed GGOs with various sizes and morphologies were typical features of COVID-19 on initial CT. The VE pattern was more common in COVID-19 (88/106, 83.02 %) than in IVP (10/52, 19.23 %) on initial CT (P < 0.001). Three special VE-pattern-specific CT signs, including central vascular sign, ginkgo leaf sign, and comb sign, were identified. Four types of dynamic changes in the VE pattern were observed on initial and follow-up CT, which were closely associated with the evolution of lesions and the time interval from the onset of symptoms to initial CT scan. The VE pattern in COVID-19 was more commonly seen in larger lesions and patients with severe-critical type (all P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The VE pattern is a valuable CT sign for differentiating COVID-19 from IVP, which correlates with more extensive or serious disease. A good understanding of the CT characteristics of the VE pattern may contribute to the early and accurate diagnosis of COVID-19 and prediction of the evolution of lesions.","Li, Qi; Huang, Xing-Tao; Li, Chun-Hua; Liu, Dan; Lv, Fa-Jin",Eur J Radiol,420,24

Little is known about the mental health changes during this phase of this pandemic. This study evaluated mental health levels in Romania at the end of the first wave of the pandemic and amidst the third and most severe wave. We administered a two-phase internet-based survey among 543 and 583 participants, respectively, recruited through snowball sampling at a 6-month interval. The IPAT Anxiety Scale measured anxiety, the Beck's Depression Inventory measured depression, and the Dissociative Experiences Scale measured dissociation. We observed no statistically significant differences in the number of participants with clinically relevant scores at either time point. In the first survey, 23.8%, 19.2%, and 32.6% reported being clinically anxious, clinically depressed, and showed clinical dissociation, respectively. Binary logistic regressions indicated that age, education level, and previous traumatic events were significantly associated with clinical levels of anxiety and depression. Moreover, multiple linear regression analysis reported a collective significant effect of gender, age, psychological impact, traumatic events, and dissociation on predicting high levels of anxiety and depression.

Harms are typically assessed through the collection of adverse events (AEs). Despite AEs being routine outcomes collected in trials, analysis and reporting of AEs in journal articles are continually shown to be suboptimal. One key challenge is the large volume of AEs, which can make evaluation and communication problematic. Prominent practice is to report frequency tables of AEs by arm. Visual displays offer an effective solution to assess and communicate complex information; however, they are rarely used and there is a lack of practical guidance on what and how to visually display complex AE data. METHODS: In this article, we demonstrate the use of two plots identified to be beneficial for wide use in RCTs, since both can display multiple AEs and are suitable to display point estimates for binary, count, or time-to-event AE data: the volcano and dot plots. We compare and contrast the use of data visualisations against traditional frequency table reporting, using published AE information in two placebo-controlled trials, of remdesivir for COVID-19 and GDNF for Parkinson disease. We introduce statistical programmes for implementation in Stata. RESULTS/CASE STUDY: Visualisations of AEs in the COVID-19 trial communicated a risk profile for remdesivir which differed from the main message in the published authors' conclusion. In the Parkinson's disease trial of GDNF, the visualisation provided immediate communication of harm signals, which had otherwise been contained within lengthy descriptive text and tables. Asymmetry in the volcano plot helped flag extreme events that were less obvious from review of the frequency table and dot plot. The dot plot allowed a more comprehensive representation by means of a more detailed summary. CONCLUSIONS: Visualisations can better support investigators to assimilate large volumes of data and enable improved informal between-arm comparisons compared to tables. We endorse increased uptake for use in trial publications. Care in construction of visual displays needs to be taken as there can be potential to overemphasise treatment effects in some circumstances.","Cornelius, Victoria; Cro, Suzie; Phillips, Rachel",Trials,420,19

Firstly, an improved CSPDarkNet53 is introduced into the trunk feature extraction network, which reduces the computing cost of the network and improves the learning ability of the model. Secondly, the adaptive image scaling algorithm can reduce computation and redundancy effectively. Thirdly, the improved PANet structure is introduced so that the network has more semantic information in the feature layer. At last, a face mask detection data set is made according to the standard wearing of masks. Based on the object detection algorithm of deep learning, a variety of evaluation indexes are compared to evaluate the effectiveness of the model. The results of the comparations show that the mAP of face mask recognition can reach 98.3% and the frame rate is high at 54.57 FPS, which are more accurate compared with the exiting algorithm.","Yu, Jimin; Zhang, Wei",Sensors (Basel),420,0

Methods: Data on hospital and ICU admissions with COVID-19 at 31 NHS trusts in England were collected by Public Health England's Severe Acute Respiratory Infections surveillance system and linked to death information. We applied parametric multi-state mixture models, accounting for censored outcomes and regressing risks and times between events on month of admission, geography, and baseline characteristics. Findings: 20,785 adults were admitted with COVID-19 in 2020. Between March and June/July/August estimated HFR reduced from 31.9% (95% confidence interval 30.3-33.5%) to 10.9% (9.4-12.7%), then rose steadily from 21.6% (18.4-25.5%) in September to 25.7% (23.0-29.2%) in December, with steeper increases among older patients, those with multi-morbidity and outside London/South of England. ICU admission risk reduced from 13.9% (12.8-15.2%) in March to 6.2% (5.3-7.1%) in May, rising to a high of 14.2% (11.1-17.2%) in September. Median length of stay in non-critical care increased during 2020, from 6.6 to 12.3 days for those dying, and from 6.1 to 9.3 days for those discharged. Interpretation: Initial improvements in patient outcomes, corresponding to developments in clinical practice, were not sustained throughout 2020, with HFR in December approaching the levels seen at the start of the pandemic, whilst median hospital stays have lengthened. The role of increased transmission, new variants, case-mix and hospital pressures in increasing COVID-19 severity requires urgent further investigation.","Kirwan, Peter D.; Elgohari, Suzanne; Jackson, Christopher H.; Tom, Brian D.

To investigate the effect of this metaphor on immersive network exploration, we designed and evaluated interfaces of varying degrees of egocentrism. In a user study, we evaluated the effect of these interfaces on visual search tasks, efficiency of network traversal, spatial orientation, as well as cyber-sickness. Results show that a simple egocentric interface considerably improves visual search efficiency and navigation performance, yet does not decrease spatial orientation or increase cyber-sickness. An occlusion-free Ego-Bubble view of the neighborhood only marginally improves the user's performance.

Right-left lung aeration asymmetry and poorly recruitable lungs with increased recruitability with alternating body position between supine and prone have been reported. However, real-time effects of changing body position and PEEP on regional overdistension and collapse, in individual patients, remain largely unknown and not timely monitored. The aim of this study was to individualize PEEP and body positioning in order to reduce the mechanisms of ventilator-induced lung injury: collapse and overdistension. METHODS: We here report a series of five consecutive mechanically ventilated patients with COVID-19-associated ARDS in which sixteen decremental PEEP titrations were performed in the first days of mechanical ventilation (8 titration pairs: supine position immediately followed by 30° targeted lateral position). The choice of lateral tilt was based on X-Ray. This targeted lateral position strategy was defined by selecting the less aerated lung to be positioned up and the more aerated lung to be positioned down. For each PEEP level, global and regional collapse and overdistension maps and percentages were measured by electrical impedance tomography. Additionally, we present the incidence of lateral asymmetry in a cohort of forty-four patients. RESULTS: The targeted lateral position strategy resulted in significantly smaller amounts of overdistension and collapse when compared with the supine one: less collapse along the PEEP titration was found within the left lung in targeted lateral (P = 0.014); and less overdistension along the PEEP titration was found within the right lung in targeted lateral (P = 0.005). Regarding collapse within the right lung and overdistension within the left lung: no differences were found for position. In the cohort of forty-four patients, ventilation inequality of > 65/35% was observed in 15% of cases. CONCLUSIONS: Targeted lateral positioning with bedside personalized PEEP provided a selective attenuation of overdistension and collapse in mechanically ventilated patients with COVID-19-associated ARDS and right-left lung aeration/ventilation asymmetry.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of pulmonary embolism in patients with COVID-19; to determine the possible relationship between the severity of pulmonary involvement and D-dimer levels; to analyze the location of pulmonary embolisms in patients with COVID-19 and to compare it with the location in patients without COVID-19. METHODS: This retrospective study analyzed all CT angiograms of the pulmonary arteries done in patients with suspected pulmonary embolisms between March 15 and April 30, 2020 and compared them with studies done in the same period one year earlier. RESULTS: We included 492 pulmonary CT angiograms (342 (69.9%) in patients with COVID-19 and 147 (30.1%) in patients without COVID-19). The prevalence of pulmonary embolisms was higher in patients with COVID-19 (26% vs. 16.3% in patients without COVID-19, p=0.0197; relative risk=1.6). The prevalence of pulmonary embolisms in the same period in 2019 was 13.2%, similar to that of the group of COVID-19-negative patients in 2020 (p=0.43). There were no significant differences in D-dimer levels or the location of pulmonary embolisms between the two groups. CT showed moderate or severe pulmonary involvement in 78.7% of the patients with COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with COVID-19 have an increased prevalence of pulmonary embolisms (26%), and most (78.7%) have moderate or severe lung involvement on CT studies. The location of pulmonary embolisms and the degree of elevation of D-dimer levels does not differ between patients with COVID-19 and those without.","Martínez Chamorro, E; Revilla Ostolaza, T Y; Pérez Núñez, M; Borruel Nacenta, S; Cruz-Conde Rodríguez-Guerra, C; Ibáñez Sanz, L",Radiologia,420,1

However, contradictory findings have been reported regarding the impact of glycaemic control on COVID-19 outcome. The aim of this meta-analysis was to explore the impact of hospital pre-admission or at-admission values of HbA1c on COVID-19 mortality or worsening in patients with diabetes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We searched PubMed, Embase and Scopus up to 30th December 2020. Eligibility criteria for study selection were the following: (1)enrolling patients with any form of diabetes mellitus and hospitalized for COVID-19 and (2) reporting data regarding HbA1c values before infection or at hospital admission in relation to COVID-19 mortality or worsening. Descriptive statistics, HbA1c values, odds ratios (ORs) and hazard ratios were extracted from seven observational studies and generic inverse variance (random effects) of OR was used to estimate the effect of HbA1c on COVID-19 outcome. RESULTS: HbA1c was linearly associated with an increased COVID-19 mortality or worsening when considered as a continuous variable (OR 1.01 [1.01, 1.01]; p < 0.00001). Similarly, when analysing studies providing the number of events according to the degree of glycaemic control among various strata, a significantly increased risk was observed with poor glycaemic control (OR 1.15 [1.11, 1.19]; p < 0.00001), a result corroborated by sensitivity analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Notwithstanding the large heterogeneity in study design and patients' characteristics in the few available studies, data suggest that patients with diabetes and poor glycaemic control before infection might have an increased risk of COVID-19 related mortality.","Prattichizzo, Francesco; de Candia, Paola; Nicolucci, Antonio; Ceriello, Antonio",Diabetes Metab Res Rev,420,15

An online survey collected during the COVID-19 lockdown (total n = 875; analysed n = 588; 33.4 ± 12.6 years; 82% UK-based; mostly white, educated, and not home schooling) investigated reported changes to the amount consumed and changes to intake of high energy dense (HED) sweet and savoury foods. The study also assessed which eating behaviour traits predicted a reported increase of HED sweet and savoury foods and tested whether coping responses moderated this relationship. Results showed that 48% of participants reported increased food intake in response to the COVID-19 lockdown. There was large individual variability in reported changes and lower craving control was the strongest predictor of increased HED sweet and savoury food intake. Low cognitive restraint also predicted greater increases in HED sweet snacks and HED savoury meal foods. Food responsiveness, enjoyment of food, emotional undereating, emotional overeating and satiety responsiveness were not significant predictors of changes to HED sweet and savoury food intake. High scores on acceptance coping responses attenuated the conditional effects of craving control on HED sweet snack intake. Consistent with previous findings, the current research suggests that low craving control is a risk factor for increased snack food intake during lockdown and may therefore represent a target for intervention.","Buckland, Nicola J; Swinnerton, Lucy F; Ng, Kwok; Price, Menna; Wilkinson, Laura L; Myers, Anna; Dalton, Michelle",Appetite,420,20

The effectiveness of teach-back has been underexamined, particularly for older patients discharged from the emergency department (ED). We aimed to determine whether teach-back would reduce ED revisits and whether it would increase patients' retention of discharge instructions, improve self-management at home and increase satisfaction with the provision of instructions. METHODS: A nonrandomised pre-post pilot evaluation in the ED of one Dutch academic hospital including patients discharged from the ED receiving standard discharge care (pre) and teach-back (post). Primary outcomes were ED-revisits within 7 days and within 8-30 days postdischarge. Secondary outcomes for a subsample of older adults were retention of instructions, self-management 72 hours after discharge and satisfaction with the provision of discharge instructions. RESULTS: A total of 648 patients were included, 154 were older adults. ED revisits within 7 days and within 8-30 days were lower in the teach-back group compared with those receiving standard discharge care: adjusted odds ratios (AORs) of 0.23 (95% CI 0.05 to 1.07) and 0.42 (95% CI 0.14 to 1.33), respectively. Participants in the teach-back group had an increased likelihood of full knowledge retention on information related to their ED diagnosis and treatment (AOR 2.19; 95% CI 1.01 to 4.75; p=0.048), medication (AOR 14.89; 95% CI 4.12 to 53.85; p>0.001) and follow-up appointments (AOR 3.86; 95% CI 1.33 to 10.19; p=0.012). Use of teach-back was not significantly associated with improved self-management and higher satisfaction with discharge instructions. Discharge conversations were generally shorter for participants receiving teach-back. CONCLUSIONS: Discharging patients from the ED with a relatively simple and feasible teach-back method can contribute to safer and better transitional care from the ED to home.","Hesselink, Gijs; Sir, Özcan; Koster, Nadia; Tolsma, Carolien; Munsterman, Maartje; Olde Rikkert, Marcel; Schoon, Yvonne",Emerg. med. j,420,14

We have considered all complete severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) genomes deposited in the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) repository until four different cutoff dates, and used direct coupling analysis together with an assumption of quasi-linkage equilibrium to infer epistatic contributions to fitness from polymorphic loci. We find eight interactions, of which three are between pairs where one locus lies in gene ORF3a, both loci holding nonsynonymous mutations. We also find interactions between two loci in gene nsp13, both holding nonsynonymous mutations, and four interactions involving one locus holding a synonymous mutation. Altogether, we infer interactions between loci in viral genes ORF3a and nsp2, nsp12, and nsp6, between ORF8 and nsp4, and between loci in genes nsp2, nsp13, and nsp14.

Assessment of verbal STM/WM is critical for identifying and addressing these delays, but standard assessment procedures require face-to-face (FTF) administration. The purpose of this study was to determine the feasibility and validity of remote testing methods (teleassessment) of verbal STM/WM in youth with CIs as a method of addressing COVID-19-related restrictions on FTF test administration. Method Tests of verbal STM/WM for nonwords, digit spans, letter-number sequences, sentences, and stories were individually administered by speech-language pathologists over a teleassessment platform to 28 youth (aged 9-22 years) with CIs and 36 same-aged normal-hearing peers. Examiners, parents, and participants completed quality and satisfaction ratings with the teleassessment procedure. Teleassessment scores were compared to results of tests obtained at FTF visits an average of 1.6 years earlier. Results Quality and satisfaction ratings for teleassessment were high and in almost all cases did not differ between the CI and normal-hearing samples. Youth with CIs scored lower than normal-hearing peers on measures of verbal STM/WM, and scores for digit span and letter-number sequencing did not differbetween teleassessment and FTF methods. Correlations across teleassessment and FTF visits were strong for digit span, letter-number sequencing, and sentence memory, but were more modest for nonword repetition. Conclusion With some caveats, teleassessment of verbal STM/WM was feasible and valid for youth with CIs.","Kronenberger, William G; Montgomery, Caitlin J; Henning, Shirley C; Ditmars, Allison; Johnson, Courtney A; Herbert, Carolyn J; Pisoni, David B",Am J Speech Lang Pathol,420,16

Although many computational and experimental phasing methods have been developed for analyzing diploid genomes, it remains challenging to reconstruct chromosome-scale haplotypes at low cost, which constrains the utility of this valuable genetic resource. Gamete cells, the natural packaging of haploid complements, are ideal materials for phasing entire chromosomes because the majority of the haplotypic allele combinations have been preserved. Therefore, compared to the current diploid-based phasing methods, using haploid genomic data of single gametes may substantially reduce the complexity in inferring the donor's chromosomal haplotypes. In this study, we developed the first easy-to-use R package, Hapi, for inferring chromosome-length haplotypes of individual diploid genomes with only a few gametes. Hapi outperformed other phasing methods when analyzing both simulated and real single gamete cell sequencing datasets. The results also suggested that chromosome-scale haplotypes may be inferred by using as few as three gametes, which has pushed the boundary to its possible limit. The single gamete cell sequencing technology allied with the cost-effective Hapi method will make large-scale haplotype-based genetic studies feasible and affordable, promoting the use of haplotype data in a wide range of research.","Li, Ruidong; Qu, Han; Chen, Jinfeng; Wang, Shibo; Chater, John M; Zhang, Le; Wei, Julong; Zhang, Yuan-Ming; Xu, Chenwu; Zhong, Wei-De; Zhu, Jianguo; Lu, Jianming; Feng, Yuanfa; Chen, Weiming; Ma, Renyuan; Ferrante, Sergio Pietro; Roose, Mikeal L; Jia, Zhenyu",Mol. biol. evol,420,16

Researchers have suggested that COVID-19 death characteristics (e.g., intensive care admission, unexpected death) and circumstances (e.g., secondary stressors, social isolation) will precipitate a worldwide increase of prolonged grief disorder (PGD) and persistent complex bereavement disorder (PCBD). Yet, no study has investigated this. Since acute grief is a strong predictor of future pathological grief, we compared grief levels among people recently bereaved due to COVID-19, natural, and unnatural causes. METHODS: People bereaved through COVID-19 (n = 49), natural causes (n = 1182), and unnatural causes (n = 210), completed self-report measures of demographic and loss-related characteristics and PGD and PCBD symptoms. RESULTS: COVID-19 bereavement yielded higher symptom levels of PGD (d = 0.42) and PCBD (d = 0.35) than natural bereavement (but not unnatural bereavement). Effects held when limiting analyses to recent losses and those who participated during the pandemic. Expectedness of the death explained this effect. LIMITATIONS: Limitations include using a convenience sample and self-report measures. CONCLUSIONS: Higher grief levels occur among people bereaved due to COVID-19 compared to people bereaved due to natural loss. We predict that pandemic-related increases in pathological grief will become a worldwide public health concern.","Eisma, Maarten C; Tamminga, Aerjen; Smid, Geert E; Boelen, Paul A",J Affect Disord,420,16

This review aims to provide the information available so far on the likely animal origin of SARS-CoV-2 and its possible hosts/reservoirs as well as all natural animal infections and experimental evidence using animal models. Horseshoe bats from the species Rhinolophus affinis seem to be a natural reservoir and pangolins (Manis javanica) appear to be an intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2. Humans remain the most likely spreading source of SARS-CoV-2 to other humans and also to domestic, zoo and farm animals. Indeed, human-to-animal transmission has been reported in cats, dogs, tigers, lions, a puma and minks. Animal-to-human transmission is not a sustained pathway, although mink-to-human transmission remains to be elucidated. Through experimental infections, other animals seem also to be susceptible hosts for SARS-CoV-2, namely ferrets, some non-human primate species, hamsters and transgenic mice, while dogs, pigs and poultry are resistant. A One Health perspective must be implemented in order to develop epidemiological surveillance and establish disease control mechanisms to limit zoonotic transmission. Moreover, research in this field is important to better understand SARS-CoV-2 and to obtain the long-awaited vaccine and specific treatment.","do Vale, Beatriz; Lopes, Ana Patrícia; Fontes, Maria da Conceição; Silvestre, Mário; Cardoso, Luís; Coelho, Ana Cláudia",Vet Res Commun,420,30

Antibiotic resistance testing is not widely available in North America where there are insufficient resistance and susceptibility data. Quadruple regimens (bismuth-based or concomitant/non-bismuth-based) have been recommended first-line. A rifabutin-based combination product recently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration is highly effective and should simplify treatment. The potassium-competitive acid blocker vonoprazan is being evaluated as part of dual or triple combination regimens. Molecular-based genotypic testing for antibiotic resistance and an effective H. pylori vaccine remain under development. Summary: Inability to test for antibiotic resistance renders treatment selection empiric. However, resistance to rifabutin and amoxicillin remains rare.

In this study, we investigated the immune response in acute or convalescent COVID19 patients. We characterized the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) using flow cytometry and found that CD8+ T cells were significantly subsided in moderate COVID-19 and convalescent patients. Furthermore, characterization of CD8+ T cells suggested that patients with a mild and moderate course of the COVID-19 disease and convalescent patients have significantly diminished expression of both perforin and granzyme A in CD8+ T cells. Using 1H-NMR spectroscopy, we characterized the metabolic status of their autologous PBMCs. We found that fructose, lactate and taurine levels were elevated in infected (mild and moderate) patients compared with control and convalescent patients. Glucose, glutamate, formate and acetate levels were attenuated in COVID-19 (mild and moderate) patients. In summary, our report suggests that SARS-CoV-2 infection leads to disrupted CD8+ T cytotoxic functions and changes the overall metabolic functions of immune cells.","Singh, Yogesh; Trautwein, Christoph; Fendel, Rolf; Krickeberg, Naomi; Berezhnoy, Georgy; Bissinger, Rosi; Ossowski, Stephan; Salker, Madhuri S; Casadei, Nicolas; Riess, Olaf",Heliyon,420,20

Thus, novel biomarkers are required to enable making this distinction. Here, we evaluated whether the surfactant protein D (SP-D), a collectin produced at the alveolar epithelium with known immune properties, was useful to differentiate pandemic influenza A(H1N1) from COVID-19 in critically ill patients. Our results revealed high serum SP-D levels in patients with severe pandemic influenza but not those with COVID-19. This finding was validated in a separate cohort of mechanically ventilated patients with COVID-19 who also showed low plasma SP-D levels. However, plasma SP-D levels did not distinguish seasonal influenza from COVID-19 in mild-to-moderate disease. Finally, we found that high serum SP-D levels were associated with death and renal failure among severe pandemic influenza cases. Thus, our studies have identified SP-D as a unique biomarker expressed during severe pandemic influenza but not COVID-19.","Choreño-Parra, José Alberto; Jiménez-Álvarez, Luis Armando; Ramírez-Martínez, Gustavo; Cruz-Lagunas, Alfredo; Thapa, Mahima; Fernández-López, Luis Alejandro; Carnalla-Cortés, Martha; Choreño-Parra, Eduardo M; Mena-Hernández, Lourdes; Sandoval-Vega, Montserrat; Hernández-Montiel, Erika Mariana; Hernández-García, Diana Lizzeth; Ramírez-Noyola, Jazmín Ariadna; Reyes-López, Cynthia Estefania; Domínguez-Faure, Andrea; Zamudio-López, Guillermo Yamil; Márquez-García, Eduardo; Moncada-Morales, Angélica; Mendoza-Milla, Criselda; Cervántes-Rosete, Diana; Muñoz-Torrico, Marcela; Luna-Rivero, Cesar; García-Latorre, Ethel A; Guadarrama-Ortíz, Parménides; Ávila-Moreno, Federico; Domínguez-Cherit, Guillermo; Rodríguez-Reyna, Tatiana Sofía; Mudd, Philip A; Hernández-Cárdenas, Carmen Margarita; Khader, Shabaana A; Zúñiga, Joaquín",J Infect Dis,420,24

Molecular assays are the preferred method to detect a broad range of viral pathogens with high sensitivity and specificity. The implementation of molecular assay testing in a rapidly evolving public health emergency, such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, can be hindered by resource availability or technical constraints. We present a screening strategy that is easily scaled up to support a sustained large volume of testing over long periods of time. This non-adaptive pooled-sample screening protocol employs Bayesian inference to yield a reportable outcome for each individual sample in a single testing step (no confirmation of positive results required). The proposed method is validated using clinical specimens tested using a real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction test for SARS-CoV-2. This screening protocol has substantial advantages for its implementation, including higher sample throughput, faster time to results, no need to retrieve previously screened samples from storage to undergo retesting, and excellent performance of the algorithm's sensitivity and specificity compared with the individual test's metrics.","Sobczyk, Juliana; Pyne, Michael T; Barker, Adam; Mayer, Jeanmarie; Hanson, Kimberly E; Samore, Matthew H; Noriega, Rodrigo",J R Soc Interface,420,1

The purpose of this survey-based assessment was to demonstrate the beneficial effects of radiologist engagement during this pandemic and potentially in future crises if needed. METHODS: After the program's completion, a survey consisting of 13 multiple-choice and open-ended questions was distributed to the 69 radiologists who volunteered for a minimum of 7 days. The survey focused on how the experience would change future practice, the nature of interaction with medical students, and the motivation for volunteering. The electronic medical record system identified the patients who tested positive for or were suspected of having COVID-19 and the number of notes documenting family communication. RESULTS: In all, 69 radiologists signed or cosigned 7,027 notes. Of the 69 radiologists, 60 (87.0%) responded to the survey. All found the experience increased their understanding of COVID-19 and its effect on the health care system. Overall, 59.6% agreed that participation would result in future change in communication with patients and their families. Nearly all (98.1%) who worked with medical students agreed that their experience with medical students was rewarding. A majority (82.7%) chose to participate as a way to provide service to the patient population. CONCLUSION: This program provided support to frontline inpatient teams while also positively affecting the radiologist participants. If a similar situation arises in the future, this communication tool could be redeployed, especially with the collaboration of medical students.","Taffel, Myles T; Hochman, Katherine A; Chhor, Chloe M; Alaia, Erin F; Borja, Maria J; Sondhi, Jaya; Lala, Shailee V; Tong, Angela",J.

It uses wastewater SARS-CoV-2 data collected from 394 sampling sites, and implements normalisation based on concentrations of a) ammoniacal nitrogen, and b) orthophosphate. Wastewater SARS-CoV-2 metrics are evaluated at a site and aggregated level against three indicators prevalence, based on positivity rates from the Office for National Statistics Coronavirus Infection Survey and test results reported by NHS Test and Trace. Normalisation is shown to have little impact on the overall trends in the wastewater SARS-CoV-2 data on average. However, significant variability between the impact of population normalisation at different sites, which is not evident from previous WBE studies focussed on a single site, is also revealed. Critically, it is demonstrated that while the impact of normalisation on SARS-CoV-2 trends is small on average, it is not reasonable to conclude that it is always insignificant. When averaged across many sites, normalisation strengthens the correlation between wastewater SARS-CoV-2 data and indicators of prevalence; however, confidence in the improvement is low. Lastly, it is noted that most data were collected during periods of national lockdown and/or local restrictions, and thus the impacts and benefits of population normalisation are expected to be higher when normal travel habits resume.","Sweetapple, Chris; Wade, Matthew John; Grimsley, Jasmine M.

The impact of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection on PwMS receiving DMTs that inhibit immune cell trafficking, such as natalizumab (NTZ) and fingolimod (FTY), remains to be determined, as do the possible effects of these drugs on both the infection and the related disease. AIMS: To describe self-reported COVID-19 symptoms and disease severity in PwMS on NTZ or FTY who received serology confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: From 27th April to 3rd May 2020, telephone interviews were conducted with 140 PwMS under treatment with NTZ or FTY in order to collect structured data on multiple sclerosis (MS) and COVID-19. The patients, all followed at our center, were classified as symptomatic, paucisymptomatic or asymptomatic on the basis of their self-reported clinical characteristics. COVID-19 severity was rated on a 7-point ordinal scale. In addition, in the period 4th May to 3rd June 2020 SARS-CoV-2 serology testing, using the Roche SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay (Elecsysâ), was performed in 104/140 (74.2%) of the interviewed PwMS (50 treated with NTZ and 54 with FTY). RESULTS: 14/104 (13.4%) PwMS on NTZ or FTY had anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies: 8 met the criteria for asymptomatic, 3 for paucisymptomatic and 3 for symptomatic COVID-19 (COVID-19 severity score lower than 3). None of them required hospitalization or showed severe COVID-19 complications. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the relatively high SARS CoV-2 seroprevalence found in this sample of PwMS, all the positive cases showed either no or only mild COVID-19 symptoms. These reassuring findings indicate a lack of COVID-19 complications in PwMS on DMTs and support the hypothesis that it is safe to maintain ongoing treatment with these drugs in the current setting.","Mallucci, Giulia; Zito, Antonio; Baldanti, Fausto; Gastaldi, Matteo; Fabbro, Beatrice Dal; Franciotta, Diego; Bergamaschi, Roberto",Mult Scler Relat Disord,420,26

Less job satisfaction and impaired health can have an impact on health care quality. Our aim was to examine the association of stressors (illegitimate tasks) and health related resources (work-related sense of coherence; recovery experience) with life satisfaction, happiness, job satisfaction and burnout among German general practitioners (GPs). We conducted a cross-sectional survey among general medical practices in Germany. Main outcome measures were life satisfaction, happiness (Subjective Happiness Scale), job satisfaction (Work Satisfaction Scale) and burnout (Copenhagen Burnout Inventory). 548 GPs from across Germany participated (53.6% males, 45.6% females; mostly representative of German GPs). One third (35.2%) of the participants reported a high prevalence of personal, and one quarter (26.5%) indicated a high prevalence of work-related burnout symptoms. Illegitimate tasks are negatively associated with life and job satisfaction and are positively associated with personal, work-related and patient-related burnout among GPs. Work-SoC and recovery experience are positively associated with life satisfaction, happiness, and job satisfaction and are negatively associated with personal, work-related and patient-related burnout. Female physicians have a higher job satisfaction than male physicians. Being female and working as an employed physician is associated with a higher prevalence of personal burnout symptoms. GPs working in a group practice are happier and more satisfied with their job than GPs in single practices. Personal, work-related and patient-related burnout symptoms are stronger in GPs working in a single practice than in GPs in group practices.

The assumption is that the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus2 is still circulating and that occasional or seasonal outbreaks will occur. They recommend that the first step should be to assess how many patch tests each clinic can handle and review the waiting list to prioritize cases according to disease severity and urgency. Digital technologies can, where possible, be used to send and receive the documentation necessary for the patch test (information, instructions, informed consent, etc.). If the necessary infrastructure is available, patients can be offered the option of a remote initial consultation. Likewise, in selected cases, the patch test results can be read in a virtual visit using photographs taken by the patient or a video visit can be scheduled to allow the physician to evaluate the site of application remotely. These measures will reduce the number of face-to-face visits required, but will not affect the time spent on each case, which must be scheduled in the normal manner. All of these recommendations are suggestions and should be adapted to the needs and possibilities of each health centre.","Carrascosa, J M; Pastor-Nieto, M A; Ruiz-González, I; Silvestre, J F; Borrego, L; Gatica-Ortega, M E; Giménez-Arnau, A M",Actas Dermosifiliogr,420,16

Obesity as a unifying risk factor for severe COVID-19 is an emerging hypothesis. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether excessive body weight per se, was a risk factor for developing a severe form of COVID-19. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We included 131 patients hospitalized for COVID-19 pneumonia in a single center of the internal medicine department in Marseille, France. We recorded anthropometric and metabolic parameters such as fasting glycaemia, insulinemia, HOMA-IR, lipids, and all clinical criteria linked to SARS-CoV-2 infection at the admission. Excess body weight was defined by a BMIâ¯&#8805;â¯25â¯kg/m2. The occurrence of a serious event was defined as a high-debit oxygen requirement over 6â¯L/min, admission into the intensive care unit, or death. RESULTS: Among 113 patients, two thirds (nâ¯=â¯76, 67%) had an excess body weight. The number of serious events was significantly higher in excess body weight patients compared to normal weight patients (respectively 25% vs 8%, pâ¯=â¯0.03) although excess body weight patients were younger (respectively 63.6 vs 70.3â¯years old, pâ¯=â¯0.01). In multivariate analyses, the excess body weight status was the only predictor for developing a serious event linked to SARS-CoV-2 infection, with an odds ratio at 5.6 (95% CI: 1.30-23.96; pâ¯=â¯0.02), independently of previous obesity associated comorbidities. There was a trend towards a positive association between the BMI (normal weight, overweight and obesity) and the risk of serious events linked to COVID-19, with a marked increase from 8.1% to 20% and 30.6% respectively (pâ¯=â¯0.05). CONCLUSION: Excess body weight was significantly associated with severe forms of the disease, independently of its classical associated comorbidities. Physicians and specialists in Public Health must be sensitized to better protect people with an excess body weight against SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Pietri, Léa; Giorgi, Roch; Bégu, Audrey; Lojou, Manon; Koubi, Marie; Cauchois, Raphael; Grangeot, Rachel; Dubois, Noémie; Kaplanski, Gilles; Valéro, René; Béliard, Sophie",Metabolism,420,16

One particular device that has been the focus of several recent published works is the dynamic collimation system (DCS), which provides energy-specific collimation by intercepting the scanned proton beam as it nears to target edge with a set of orthogonal trimmer blades. While several computational studies have shown that this dynamic collimator can provide additional healthy tissue sparing, there has not been any rigorous experimental work to benchmark the theoretical models used in these initial studies. Therefore, it was the purpose of this work to demonstrate an experimental method that could integrate an experimental prototype with a clinical PBS system and benchmark the Monte Carlo methods that have been used to model the DCS. METHODS: An experimental DCS prototype was designed and built in house to actively collimate individual proton beamlets during PBS within a well-characterized experimental setup. Monte Carlo methods were initially used to assess construction tolerances and later benchmarked against measurements, including integral depth dose and lateral asymmetric beamlet profiles. The experimental apparatus and measurement geometry were modeled using MCNP6 benchmarked from measurements performed at the Northwestern Chicago Proton Center. RESULTS: Gamma analysis tests were used to evaluate the agreement between the measured and simulated profiles with a strict 1 mm/1% criteria and 5% dose threshold. Excellent agreement was observed between the simulated and measured profiles, which included 1 mm/1% gamma analysis pass rates of at least 100% and 95% for the integral depth dose (IDD) profiles and lateral profiles, respectively. Differences in the relative profile shape were observed experimentally between beamlets collimated on- and off-axis, which was attributed to the partial transmission of the beam through an unfocused collimator. Exposure rates resulting from the activation of the device were monitored with survey meter measurements and were found to agree with Monte Carlo estimates of the exposure rate to within 20%. CONCLUSION: A DCS prototype was constructed and integrated into a clinical dose delivery system. While the results of this work are not exhaustive, they demonstrate the effects of beam source divergence, device activation, and beamlet deflection during scanning, which were found to be successfully modeled using Monte Carlo methods and experimentally benchmarked. Excellent agreement was achieved between the simulated and measured lateral spot profiles of collimated beamlets delivered on- and off-axis in PBS. The Monte Carlo models adequately predicted the measured elevated plateau region in the integral depth-dose profiles from the low-energy scatter off the collimators.","Smith, Blake R; Pankuch, Mark; Hyer, Daniel E; Culberson, Wesley S",Med Phys,420,27

We aimed to synthesize seroprevalence data to better estimate the level and distribution of SARS-CoV-2 infection, identify high-risk groups, and inform public health decision making. METHODS: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched publication databases, preprint servers, and grey literature sources for seroepidemiological study reports, from January 1, 2020 to December 31, 2020. We included studies that reported a sample size, study date, location, and seroprevalence estimate. We corrected estimates for imperfect test accuracy with Bayesian measurement error models, conducted meta-analysis to identify demographic differences in the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, and meta-regression to identify study-level factors associated with seroprevalence. We compared region-specific seroprevalence data to confirmed cumulative incidence. PROSPERO: CRD42020183634. RESULTS: We identified 968 seroprevalence studies including 9.3 million participants in 74 countries. There were 472 studies (49%) at low or moderate risk of bias. Seroprevalence was low in the general population (median 4.5%, IQR 2.4-8.4%); however, it varied widely in specific populations from low (0.6% perinatal) to high (59% persons in assisted living and long-term care facilities). Median seroprevalence also varied by Global Burden of Disease region, from 0.6% in Southeast Asia, East Asia and Oceania to 19.5% in Sub-Saharan Africa (p<0.001). National studies had lower seroprevalence estimates than regional and local studies (p<0.001). Compared to Caucasian persons, Black persons (prevalence ratio [RR] 3.37, 95% CI 2.64-4.29), Asian persons (RR 2.47, 95% CI 1.96-3.11), Indigenous persons (RR 5.47, 95% CI 1.01-32.6), and multi-racial persons (RR 1.89, 95% CI 1.60-2.24) were more likely to be seropositive. Seroprevalence was higher among people ages 18-64 compared to 65 and over (RR 1.27, 95% CI 1.11-1.45). Health care workers in contact with infected persons had a 2.10 times (95% CI 1.28-3.44) higher risk compared to health care workers without known contact. There was no difference in seroprevalence between sex groups. Seroprevalence estimates from national studies were a median 18.1 times (IQR 5.9-38.7) higher than the corresponding SARS-CoV-2 cumulative incidence, but there was large variation between Global Burden of Disease regions from 6.7 in South Asia to 602.5 in Sub-Saharan Africa. Notable methodological limitations of serosurveys included absent reporting of test information, no statistical correction for demographics or test sensitivity and specificity, use of non-probability sampling and use of non-representative sample frames. DISCUSSION: Most of the population remains susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Public health measures must be improved to protect disproportionately affected groups, including racial and ethnic minorities, until vaccine-derived herd immunity is achieved. Improvements in serosurvey design and reporting are needed for ongoing monitoring of infection prevalence and the pandemic response.","Bobrovitz, Niklas; Arora, Rahul Krishan; Cao, Christian; Boucher, Emily; Liu, Michael; Donnici, Claire; Yanes-Lane, Mercedes; Whelan, Mairead; Perlman-Arrow, Sara; Chen, Judy; Rahim, Hannah; Ilincic, Natasha; Segal, Mitchell; Duarte, Nathan; Van Wyk, Jordan; Yan, Tingting; Atmaja, Austin; Rocco, Simona; Joseph, Abel; Penny, Lucas; Clifton, David A; Williamson, Tyler; Yansouni, Cedric P; Evans, Timothy Grant; Chevrier, Jonathan; Papenburg, Jesse; Cheng, Matthew P",PLoS One,420,16

Risk factors for mortality in critically ill patients, especially detailed self-evaluation indicators and laboratory-examination indicators, have not been well described. In this paper, a total of 192 critically ill patients (142 were discharged and 50 died in the hospital) with COVID-19 were included. Self-evaluation indicators including demographics, baseline characteristics, and symptoms and detailed lab-examination indicators were extracted. Data were first compared between survivors and nonsurvivors. Multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) was performed to identify possible risk factors for mortality of COVID-19 patients. MVPA achieved a relatively high classification accuracy of 93% when using both self-evaluation indicators and laboratory-examination indicators. Several self-evaluation factors related to COVID-19 were highly associated with mortality, including age, duration (time from illness onset to admission), and the Barthel index (BI) score. When the duration, age increased by 1 day, 1 year, BI decreased by 1 point, the mortality increased by 3.6%, 2.4%, and 0.9% respectively. Laboratory-examination indicators including C-reactive protein, white blood cell count, platelet count, fibrin degradation products, oxygenation index, lymphocyte count, and d-dimer were also risk factors. Among them, duration was the strongest predictor of all-cause mortality. Several self-evaluation indicators that can simply be obtained by questionnaires and without clinical examination were the risk factors of all-cause mortality in critically ill COVID-19 patients. The prediction model can be used by individuals to improve health awareness, and by clinicians to identify high-risk individuals.","Chen, Yinyin; Linli, Zeqiang; Lei, Yuting; Yang, Yiya; Liu, Zhipeng; Xia, Youchun; Liang, Yumei; Zhu, Huabo; Guo, Shuixia",J. med. virol,420,22

Fortunately, sufficient vaccines are now available. Local reactions with ipsilateral lymphadenopathy are among the most common side effects. We investigated the impact of lymphadenopathy after Covid-19 vaccination on the value of ultrasound in tumor patients. Patients and methods Patients with melanoma or merkel cell carcinoma were included who underwent lymph node excision and received Covid-19 vaccination within 6 weeks before surgery. The consistency of the preoperative ultrasound findings with the histopathologic findings was investigated. Results Eight patients were included (two Merkel cell carcinoma and six melanoma patients) who underwent lymph node excision between April 16, 2021, and May 19, 2021, and had previously received Covid-19 vaccination. In three of the eight patients (one Merkel cell carcinoma and two melanoma patients), lymph node metastases were erroneously diagnosed preoperatively during tumor follow-up with physical examination, ultrasound, and or FDG PET/CT. In these three patients, the suspected lymph node metastases were located in the left axilla after Covid19 vaccination in the left upper arm, which resulted in selective lymph node removal in two patients and complete lymphadenectomy in one patient. Conclusion Covid-19 vaccine-associated lymphadenopathy is expected to be observed much more frequently in the near future due to increasing vaccination rates. This cause of lymphadenopathy, which may in ultrasound as well as in FDG PET/CT resemble lymph node metastases, must be considered, especially in oncologic patients undergoing tumor follow-up. In addition, Covid-19 vaccination should be given as far away as possible from an underlying primary on the contralateral side to avoid oncologic misdiagnosis followed by malpractice.","Placke, J.

The goal of the present study was to advance our understanding on this front. METHOD: We isolated and examined motor kinematics associated with the learning of a rapid aimed limb movement in a sample of 40 individuals (13-34 years of age) with ETPKU and a matched comparison group of 40 individuals without phenylketonuria (PKU). Indices of motor learning included overall movement duration as well as the relative proportion of movement time devoted to ballistic and corrective submovements. (Note that practice of motor movements in nonclinical populations is associated with, not only improvements in overall speed, but also reduction in the proportion of movement time devoted to corrective submovements relative to an initial ballistic submovement.) Results: A group-by-time interaction was found. With practice, the non-PKU group showed a significant reduction in the proportion of movement time devoted to the corrected (as compared to the ballistic) submovement. A similar change was not observed for the ETPKU group. In addition, within the ETPKU group, the rate of improvement in total movement duration was correlated with recent blood phenylalanine levels (an indicator of treatment adherence). CONCLUSIONS: Motor learning is adversely affected in individuals with ETPKU. Further investigation into the behavioral and neural mechanisms of motor learning in ETPKU will advance our understanding of the etiologic basis for this disruption as well as how it relates to the broader neurocognitive profile of ETPKU.

For the seven kits evaluated, N gene was more sensitive than ORF1ab gene in most kits, whereas E gene was most sensitive among the three genes in Shanghai Kehua Bio-Engineering Co, Ltd, and Applied Biological Technologies Co, Ltd. PerkinElmer got the lowest limit of detection for N gene at 11.61 copies/mL, and the value was 34.66 copies/mL for ORF1ab gene. All of the kits showed good precision, with CV values of <5%, as well as acceptable anti-interference ability of 2 mg/L human genomic DNA. No cross-reactivity was observed with other respiratory viruses.","Yan, Ying; Chang, Le; Luo, Wenxin; Liu, Junyi; Guo, Fei; Wang, Lunan",J. mol. diagn,420,1

Preferably, the performance of serological tests for a novel virus should be determined with clinical specimens against a gold standard, i.e. virus neutralisation. We compared the performance of six commercial immunoassays for the detection of SARS-COV-2 IgG, IgA and IgM antibodies, including four automated assays [Abbott SARS-COV-2 IgG (CE marked), Diasorin Liaison® SARS-COV-2 S1/S2 IgG (research use only, RUO), and Euroimmun SARS-COV-2 IgG and IgA (CE marked)], and two rapid lateral flow (immunocromatographic) tests [Acro Biotech 2019-nCoV IgG/IgM (CE marked) and Xiamen Biotime Biotechnology SARS-COV-2 IgG/IgM (CE marked)] with a microneutralisation test (MNT). Two specimen panels from serum samples sent to Helsinki University Hospital Laboratory (HUSLAB) were compiled: the patient panel (N=70) included sera from PCR confirmed COVID-19 patients, and the negative panel (N=81) included sera sent for screening of autoimmune diseases and respiratory virus antibodies in 2018 and 2019. The MNT was carried out for all COVID-19 samples (70 serum samples, 62 individuals) and for 53 samples from the negative panel. Forty-one out of 62 COVID-19 patients showed neutralising antibodies.The specificity and sensitivity values of the commercial tests against MNT, respectively, were as follows: 95.1 %/80.5 % (Abbott Architect SARS-CoV-2 IgG), 94.9 %/43.8 % (Diasorin Liaison SARS-CoV-2 IgG; RUO), 68.3 %/87.8 % (Euroimmun SARS-CoV-2 IgA), 86.6 %/70.7 % (Euroimmun SARS-CoV-2 IgG), 74.4 %/56.1 % (Acro 2019-nCoV IgG), 69.5 %/46.3 % (Acro 2019-nCoV IgM), 97.5 %/71.9 % (Xiamen Biotime SARS-CoV-2 IgG), and 88.8 %/81.3 % (Xiamen Biotime SARS-CoV-2 IgM).

AIM: The aim of this study was to collect information regarding the extent of online medication purchasing in the UAE and to assess the factors that motivating the purchase of medications from the internet. METHOD: A convenience sampling of people living in the UAE was used to conduct an online descriptive cross-sectional study. Respondents were solicited using the social media platforms WhatsApp and Facebook, whereby they were asked to fill in a validated web-based questionnaire. The number of people buying medications from online pharmacies was calculated using a percentage with 95% CIs. RESULTS: 131 respondents (31.2%) [95% CI: 26.7-35.6] stated that they purchased medication via the Internet after Covid-19 was classed as a pandemic. It was found that those respondents most likely to have purchased medication via the Internet were male, single, and older and with a high school education. CONCLUSION: More research should be conducted to investigate and compare the self-medication and associated risk factors between online pharmacies and community pharmacies. Moreover, regulatory bodies need to make and implement changes to the regulations that govern the sale and use of medications during COVID-19.","Jairoun, Ammar Abdulrahman; Al-Hemyari, Sabaa Saleh; Abdulla, Naseem Mohammed; El-Dahiyat, Faris; Jairoun, Maimona; Al-Tamimi, Saleh Karamah; Babar, Zaheer-Ud-Din",J Pharm Policy Pract,420,5

Brain tissues from 13 autopsies of people who died of COVID-19 were examined. Cultured endothelial and neuronal cells were incubated with and wild type mice were injected IV with different spike subunits. In situ analyses were used to detect SARS-CoV-2 proteins and the host response. In 13/13 brains from fatal COVID-19, pseudovirions (spike, envelope, and membrane proteins without viral RNA) were present in the endothelia of microvessels ranging from 0 to 14 positive cells/200× field (mean 4.3). The pseudovirions strongly co-localized with caspase-3, ACE2, IL6, TNF&#945;, and C5b-9. The surrounding neurons demonstrated increased NMDAR2 and neuronal NOS plus decreased MFSD2a and SHIP1 proteins. Tail vein injection of the full length S1 spike subunit in mice led to neurologic signs (increased thirst, stressed behavior) not evident in those injected with the S2 subunit. The S1 subunit localized to the endothelia of microvessels in the mice brain and showed co-localization with caspase-3, ACE2, IL6, TNF&#945;, and C5b-9. The surrounding neurons showed increased neuronal NOS and decreased MFSD2a. It is concluded that ACE2+ endothelial damage is a central part of SARS-CoV2 pathology and may be induced by the spike protein alone. Thus, the diagnostic pathologist can use either hematoxylin and eosin stain or immunohistochemistry for caspase 3 and ACE2 to document the endothelial cell damage of COVID-19.","Nuovo, Gerard J; Magro, Cynthia; Shaffer, Toni; Awad, Hamdy; Suster, David; Mikhail, Sheridan; He, Bing; Michaille, Jean-Jacques; Liechty, Benjamin; Tili, Esmerina",Ann Diagn Pathol,420,29

We conducted an online survey across Brazil during the initial outbreak, in which 8,345 participants answered a questionnaire designed to identify the maximum tolerated risk (k') necessary for them to disregard social distancing recommendations and guarantee their salaries. Generalized linear mixed models, path analysis structural equation, and conditional interference classification tree were performed to further understand how sociodemographic factors impact k' and to establish a predictive model for the risk behavior of leaving home during the pandemic. We found that, on average, people tolerate 38% risk of infection to leave home and earn a full salary, but this number decreased to 13% when the individual risk perception of becoming ill from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 is considered. Furthermore, participants who have a medium-to-high household income and who are older than 35 years are more likely to be part of the risk-taking group who leave home regardless of the potential COVID-19 infection level; while participants over 45 years old and with good financial health are more likely to be part of the risk-averse group, who stay home at the expense of any salary offered. Our findings add to the political and public debate concerning lockdown strategies by showing that, contrary to supposition, people with low socioeconomic status are not more likely to ignore social distancing recommendations due to personal economic matters.","Kluwe-Schiavon, Bruno; Viola, Thiago Wendt; Bandinelli, Lucas Poitevin; Castro, Sayra Catalina Coral; Kristensen, Christian Haag; Costa da Costa, Jaderson; Grassi-Oliveira, Rodrigo",PLoS One,420,33

Nurses are suffering from psychological distress and are exhausted and burntout as the pandemic's second wave moves around the world. Many have been subjected to violence and aggression from people in their communities. Against this backdrop, nurses' contributions have been vital in saving lives and the profession has learnt many powerful lessons that will resonate in nursing practice for the future.

The IFS theory tackles the uncertainty of key challenges while DEMATEL addresses the interlaced causal relationships among crucial challenges to the COVID-19 VSC. This work identifies 15 challenges and reveals that ‘Limited number of vaccine manufacturing companies’, ‘Inappropriate coordination with local organizations’, ‘Lack of vaccine monitoring bodies’, ‘Difficulties in monitoring and controlling vaccine temperature’, and ‘Vaccination cost and lack of financial support for vaccine purchase’ are the most critical challenges. The causal interactions along with mutual relationships among these challenges are also scrutinized, and implications for sustainable development goals (SDGs) are drawn.

Additionally, the pathophysiologic implications of timing of intubation are poorly understood, including the potential for pulmonary vascular thrombosis and intussusceptive angiogenesis. This study examines the differences in outcomes and respiratory mechanics between subjects who are intubated earlier versus later in their COVID-19 disease course. Study Design and Methods: Retrospective single-center cohort study of subjects intubated for COVID-19 ARDS between March and June 2020. Patients were stratified by time to intubation: 30 subjects were intubated 4-24 hours after presentation and 24 subjects were intubated 5-10 days after presentation. Data regarding baseline characteristics, hospitalization, ventilator mechanics and outcomes were extracted and analyzed. 10 clinically available CT scans for these patients were manually reviewed to identify evidence of pulmonary vascular thrombosis and intussusceptive angiogenesis. Results: Median time from symptom onset to intubation was significantly different between the Early and Late Intubation Cohorts, with the latter being intubated later in the course of their illness (7.9 days vs 11.8 days;p=0.04). The Early Intubation Cohort had a lower mortality rate than the Late Intubation Cohort (6% vs 30%, p &lt; 0.001) without significantly different ventilator mechanics at the time of intubation. However, the Late Intubation Cohort was noted to have higher dead space ratio (0.40 vs 0.52;p = 0.03). On review of CT scans, the Late Intubation Cohort also had more segments with dilated and tortuous peripheral vessels on imaging (2 segments vs 5 segments). Interpretation: As our approaches to treatment of COVID-19 continue to evolve, the decision of timing of intubation remains paramount. While non-invasive ventilation may allow for delaying intubation, it is possible that there are downstream effects of delayed intubation that should be considered.","Bavishi, A.

However, limited information on the skeletal complications of COVID-19 is known, even though inflammatory diseases of the respiratory tract have been known to perturb bone metabolism and cause pathological bone loss. In this study, we characterized the effects of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection on bone metabolism in an established golden Syrian hamster model for COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 causes significant multifocal loss of bone trabeculae in the long bones and lumbar vertebrae of all infected hamsters. The bone loss progressively worsens from the acute phase to the post-recovery phase. Mechanistically, the bone loss was associated with SARS-CoV-2-induced cytokine dysregulation which upregulates osteoclastic differentiation of monocyte-macrophage lineage. The pro-inflammatory cytokines further trigger a second wave of cytokine storm in the skeletal tissues to augment their pro-osteoclastogenesis effect. Our findings in this established hamster model suggest that pathological bone loss may be a neglected complication which warrants more extensive investigations during the long-term follow-up of COVID-19 patients. The benefits of potential prophylactic and therapeutic interventions against pathological bone loss should be further evaluated.","Qiao, Wei; Lau, Hui En; Xie, Huizhi; Poon, Vincent K.M.; Chan, Chris C.S.; Chu, Hin; Yuan, Shuofeng; Yuen, Terrence T.T.; Chik, Kenn K.H.; Tsang, Jessica O.L.; Chan, Chris C.Y.; Cai, Jian-Piao; Luo, Cuiting; Yuen, Kwok-Yong; Cheung, Kenneth M.C.; Chan, Jasper F.W.; Yeung, Kelvin W.K.",,420,23

It is important to examine vaccination acceptance when people are making real rather than hypothetical decisions, to identify whether targeted support is needed, and to identify implications for communications. MethodsCross-sectional online and telephone survey with probability-based sample (n=4,978) of British adults, conducted January-February 2021. Measures: socio-demographic characteristics (age, gender, ethnicity, education, financial status), COVID-19 status, vaccine acceptance, trust in COVID-19 vaccination information sources, perceptions of vaccination priority groups, and perceptions of importance of second dose. FindingsAmong 5,931 individuals invited, survey response rate was 84%. COVID-19 vaccine acceptance (83%) was associated with increasing age, higher level of education and having been invited for vaccination. Acceptance decreased with unconfirmed past COVID-19, greater financial hardship, and non-White British ethnicity; Black/Black British participants had lowest acceptance. Overall, healthcare and scientific sources of information were most trusted. Compared with White British participants, other ethnicities had lower trust in healthcare and scientific sources. Those with lower educational attainment or financial hardship had lower trust in healthcare and scientific sources. Those with no qualifications had higher trust in media and family/friends. While trust was low overall in community or faith leaders it was higher among those with Asian/Asian British and Black/Black British ethnicity compared with White British participants. Views of vaccine prioritisation were mostly consistent with UK official policy but there was support for prioritising additional groups. There was high support for having the second vaccine dose. ConclusionsTargeted engagement is needed to address COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy in non-White British ethnic groups, in younger adults, and among those with lower education, greater financial hardship and unconfirmed past infection. Healthcare professionals and scientific advisors should play a central role in communications and tailored messaging is needed for hesitant groups. Careful communication around vaccination prioritisation continues to be required.","Stead, Martine; Jessop, Curtis; Angus, Kathryn; Bedford, Helen; Ussher, Michael; Ford, Allison; Eadie, Douglas; MacGregor, Andy; Hunt, Kate; MacKintosh, Anne Marie",,420,14

Pregnant women are particularly affected by this disease. OBJECTIVE: The aims of this study are to assess the levels of perceived threat (susceptibility, severity, impact), negative emotions (fear, worry), and self-efficacy of pregnant women in China related to COVID-19 and to examine their associations with mental health (depression and anxiety) and personal protective behavior (wearing a face mask). METHODS: A total of 4087 pregnant women from China completed a cross-sectional web-based survey between March 3 and 10, 2020. RESULTS: The prevalence of probable depression and anxiety was 48.7% (1989/4087) and 33.0% (1347/4087), respectively; 23.8% participants (974/4087) reported always wearing a face mask when going out. Of the 4087 participants, 32.1% (1313) and 36.4% (1490) perceived themselves or their family members to be susceptible to COVID-19 infection, respectively; 3216-3518 (78.7%-86.1%) agreed the disease would have various severe consequences. Additionally, 2275 of the 4087 participants (55.7%) showed self-efficacy in protecting themselves from contracting COVID-19, and 2232 (54.6%) showed efficacy in protecting their family members; 1303 (31.9%) reported a high level of fear of the disease, and 2780-3056 (68.0%-74.8%) expressed worry about various aspects of COVID-19. The results of the multivariate multinominal logistic regression analyses showed that perceived severity, perceived impact, fear, and worry were risk factors for probable depression and anxiety, while self-efficacy was a protective factor. The results of the multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that perceived susceptibility was associated with always wearing a face mask. CONCLUSIONS: Chinese pregnant women showed high levels of mental distress but low levels of personal protective behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic. Interventions are needed to promote the mental health and health behavior of pregnant women during the pandemic.","Mo, Phoenix Kit Han; Fong, Vivian Wai In; Song, Bo; Di, Jiangli; Wang, Qian; Wang, Linhong",J Med Internet Res,420,5

However, before addressing Taiwan's inclusion into WHO, we first describe how the era in which WHO was founded, and WHO's resulting constitutional mandate, have focused the Organisation's work on infectious disease eradication. Narrowing in on pandemic management - one aspect of infectious disease eradication - we describe what WHO can offer. These two sections allude to what Taiwan is excluded from. Using Taiwan's COVID-19 experience as a case study, Taiwan's successful management suggests that it is excluded from little, and thus marginally benefits in terms of public health. Yet, there are beneficial political gains in its call for inclusion. Taiwan's recent leveraging and amplification of its COVID-19 success story is thus an extension of its health diplomacy. Extending the call for inclusion online captures a novel digitised health diplomacy effort from Taiwan. The present study computationally analyses press-release and Twitter data to understand how Taiwanese government engages in these channels to frame and respond to the Taiwan/WHO issue. We find that Taiwan brands and propagates a 'Taiwan Model' through hashtags that revolve around coordination and solidarity as opposed to exclusion, indirectly criticising WHO. The piece concludes by discussing the foundational weaknesses in WHO's pandemic management effort in contrast to Taiwan's successful effort despite exclusion. Although Taiwan's inclusion to WHO is improbable due to larger geopolitical factors, inclusion is not a zero-sum game, with potential bi-directional benefits and lessons that can fortify domestic health capacities in preparation for the next pandemic.","Yin, Jason Dean-Chen",Glob Public Health,420,1

By adopting Cognitive Dissonance Theory, the objectives of the study are a) to examine how dissonance, caused by the negative disconfirmation of expectations, may translate into a positive outcome and b) study how negative emotions, such as anger, guilt and regret, determine the selection of the mechanism to reduce dissonance. The theorised model was tested using a cross-sectional research design and a sample of 387 smart home users. The focus on smart home users fitted the objectives of the study due to the high expectations that users form and the challenges that the utilisation of technology sometimes causes. The collected data was analysed using structural equation modelling. Findings indicate that post-disconfirmation dissonance induces feelings of anger, guilt and regret, correlating with dissonance reduction mechanisms, which in turn have a distinctive effect on satisfaction and wellbeing. The findings of the study contribute to the discussion on expectation-disconfirmation and cognitive dissonance, by illustrating the interrelationship between emotional, cognitive and behavioural factors following the evaluation of technology performance and confirming that negative disconfirmation may result in satisfaction.","Marikyan, Davit; Papagiannidis, Savvas; Alamanos, Eleftherios",Inf Syst Front,420,16

We identify the health, social and economic impacts that this specific vulnerability creates relative to COVID-19 outcomes. Reduced national and global pandemic resilience due to high obesity prevalence should spur governments and funders to provide urgent specific protection and support for people with overweight/obesity, and to commission rapid research to identify effective prevention and reduction measures.

Fortunately, faced with the threat of COVID-19 spread, there has been a growing awareness of the importance of antimicrobial stewardship programs, as well as infection prevention and control measures that could help reduce the microbial load and hence circulation of pathogens, with a reduction in dissemination of antimicrobial resistance. These measures should be improved particularly in developing countries. Studies need to be conducted to evaluate the worldwide evolution of antimicrobial resistance during the COVID-19 pandemic, because pathogens do not respect borders.

Despite intensive research, several prediction tasks are not well supported, such as predicting effectiveness of partial vaccination, of vaccine boosters and in vaccinated subpopulations. This paper introduces a novel predictive framework to accommodate such tasks and improve prediction accuracy. It was developed for predicting the symptomatic effectiveness of the BNT162b2 (Comirnaty) and ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (Vaxzevria) vaccines but could apply to other vaccines and effectiveness types. Direct prediction within the framework uses levels of vaccine-induced neutralising antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 variants to fit efficacy and effectiveness estimates from studies with a given vaccine. Indirect prediction uses a model fitted for one vaccine to predict the effectiveness of another. The directly predicted effectiveness of Comirnaty against the Delta variant was 44.8% (22, 69) after one and 84.6% (64, 97) after two doses, which is close to 45.6% and 85.5%, the average estimates from effectiveness studies with the vaccine.

Assess the effect of ACEI/ARBs on outcome in COVID-19 patients. Hospital-based prospective study. A total of 431 patients consecutively presenting at the Emergency Department and found to be affected by COVID-19 were assessed. Relevant clinical and laboratory variables were recorded, focusing on the type of current anti hypertensive treatment. Outcome variables were NO, MILD, SEVERE respiratory distress (RD) operationally defined and DEATH. Hypertension was the single most frequent comorbidity (221/431 = 51%). Distribution of antihypertensive treatment was: ACEIs 77/221 (35%), ARBs 63/221 (28%), OTHER than ACEIs or ARBs 64/221 (29%). In 17/221 (8%) antihypertensive medication was unknown.

Asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection development and progression was investigated in subjects undergoing mandatory quarantine on airport arrival. METHODS: 2714 subjects were tested for SARS-CoV-2 and all were quarantined for 2 weeks. Viral retesting was undertaken on symptom development and routinely at 14 days if asymptomatic. Asymptomatic, positive patients underwent viral testing every 2 days to determine viral clearance. RESULTS: 188/2714 (6.9%) patients became SARS-CoV-2 positive. On arrival, 136/188 tested positive, with 44/188 (23.4%) symptomatic and 92/188 (48.9%) asymptomatic. All 92 patients remained asymptomatic and were retested every 2 days until viral clearance. 2526 quarantined subjects remained virus free at 14 days. Viral clearance did not differ between symptomatic and asymptomatic patients (12.6 ± 1.0 days and 12.1 ± 0.4 days, respectively). Of the 52/188 (27.7%) testing negative on arrival, 27/52 subsequently became positive and developed symptoms 2-13 days after arrival. 25/188 (13.3%) remained asymptomatic and tested positive at day 14, with viral testing undertaken every 2 days in these subjects; of these, 24 remained asymptomatic, with viral clearance at 9.4 ± 0.7 days - less than for those who were asymptomatic on arrival (p < 0.002).

Interestingly, the chlorinated isoxazole linked maslinic acid (compound 17) showed promising antiviral activity at micromolar non-toxic concentrations. Thoughtfully, we showed that compound 17 mainly impairs the viral replication of SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, a very promising SAR study for the examined compounds was concluded, which could be used by medicinal chemists in the near future for the design and synthesis of potential anti-SARS-CoV-2 candidates.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has been identified as a receptor that mediates the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into human cells, as in the case of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Several studies have reported that ACE2 expression is higher in Leydig, Sertoli and seminiferous ductal cells of males, as well as in ovarian follicle cells of females, suggesting possible potential pathogenicity of the coronavirus in the reproductive system. Higher ACE2 expression in the human placenta and reports of vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 among clinical cases have increased the relevance of further studies in this area. This review focuses on the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 and the ACE2 receptor and speculates on the mechanistic interplay in association with male and female reproductive physiology. In addition, based on the available literature, we discuss the alleged sex differences in terms of the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2, which is claimed greater among males, and further explore the physiological role of ACE2 and 17ß-oestradiol for the same.","Sharma, G Taru; Chandra, Vikash; Mankuzhy, Pratheesh; Thirupathi, Yasotha; Swain, Dilip Kumar; Pillai, Harikrishna; Patel, Shailesh Kumar; Pathak, Mamta; Guttula, SaiKumar",Reprod Fertil Dev,420,1

The inherent non-linearity of the equations governing the ligament destabilization lead to significant differences in the resulting drop sizes, owing to small fluctuations in the myriad initial conditions. Previous experiments and simulations reveal a variety of drop size distributions, corresponding to competing underlying physical interpretations. Here, we perform numerical simulations of individual ligaments, the deterministic breakup of which is triggered by random initial surface corrugations. Stochasticity is incorporated by simulating a large ensemble of such ligaments, each realization corresponding to a random but unique initial configuration. The resulting probability distributions reveal three stable drop sizes, generated via a sequence of two distinct stages of breakup. The probability of the large sizes is described by volume-weighted Poisson and Log-Normal distributions for the first and second breakup stages, respectively. The study demonstrates a precisely controllable and reproducible framework, which can be employed to investigate the mechanisms responsible for the polydispersity in drop sizes found in complex fluid fragmentation scenarios.","Pal, Sagar; Crialesi-Esposito, Marco; Fuster, Daniel; Zaleski, St'ephane",,420,29

Based on observations, as well as analyses of policy documents and self-organization cases, this article shows that Chinese citizens and governments collaborated through three different channels in fighting against the virus, but different channels produced different results. First, through residential committees, Chinese governments successfully mobilized most citizens to comply with stay-at-home orders, contact traced and isolated suspected cases through existing networks within the communities. Second, as a formal channel for state–society interaction during the crisis, government-organized nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) failed in bridging demands of the health system and contributions from citizens. Third, self-organizations emerged as a key informal channel for citizens to fight against the virus. The experiences and lessons learned in this citizen–government collaboration in combating the virus may offer some implications for other settings.","Zhao, Ting; Wu, Zhongsheng",Am. Rev.

This assay is based on rescuing protease-mediated cytotoxicity and does not require live virus. By enabling the facile testing of compounds across a range of 15 distantly related coronavirus 3CLpro enzymes, we identified compounds with broad 3CLpro-inhibitory activity. We also adapted the assay for use in compound screening and in doing so uncovered additional severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) 3CLpro inhibitors. We observed strong concordance between data emerging from this assay and those obtained from live-virus testing. The reported approach democratizes the testing of 3CLpro inhibitors by developing a simplified method for identifying coronavirus 3CLpro inhibitors that can be used by the majority of laboratories, rather than the few with extensive biosafety infrastructure. We identified two lead compounds, GC376 and compound 4, with broad activity against all 3CL proteases tested, including 3CLpro enzymes from understudied zoonotic coronaviruses. IMPORTANCE Multiple coronavirus pandemics have occurred over the last 2 decades. This has highlighted a need to be proactive in the development of therapeutics that can be readily deployed in the case of future coronavirus pandemics. We developed and validated a simplified cell-based assay for the identification of chemical inhibitors of 3CL proteases encoded by a wide range of coronaviruses. This assay is reporter free, does not require specialized biocontainment, and is optimized for performance in high-throughput screening. By testing reported 3CL protease inhibitors against a large collection of 3CL proteases with variable sequence similarity, we identified compounds with broad activity against 3CL proteases and uncovered structural insights into features that contribute to their broad activity. Furthermore, we demonstrated that this assay is suitable for identifying chemical inhibitors of proteases from families other than 3CL proteases.","Resnick, Samuel J; Iketani, Sho; Hong, Seo Jung; Zask, Arie; Liu, Hengrui; Kim, Sungsoo; Melore, Schuyler; Lin, Fang-Yu; Nair, Manoj S; Huang, Yaoxing; Lee, Sumin; Tay, Nicholas E S; Rovis, Tomislav; Yang, Hee Won; Xing, Li; Stockwell, Brent R; Ho, David D; Chavez, Alejandro",J Virol,420,1

We describe our experience with hospitalized dialysis patients with COVID-19 and factors associated with mortality. METHODS: From March 1, 2020, to May 31, 2020, all dialysis patients admitted to 4 Emory Hospitals and tested for COVID-19 were identified. Sociodemographic information and clinical and laboratory data were obtained from the medical record. Death was defined as an in-hospital death or transfer to hospice for end-of-life care. Patients were followed until discharge or death. RESULTS: Sixty-four dialysis patients with COVID-19 were identified. Eighty-four percent were African-American. The median age was 64 years, and 59% were males. Four patients were on peritoneal dialysis, and 60 were on hemodialysis for a median time of 3.8 years, while 31% were obese. Fever (72%), cough (61%), and diarrhea (22%) were the most common symptoms at presentation. Thirty-three percent required admission to intensive care unit, and 23% required mechanical ventilation. The median length of stay was 10 days, while 11 patients (17%) died during hospitalization and 17% were discharged to a temporary rehabilitation facility. Age >65 years (RR 13.7, CI: 1.9-100.7), C-reactive protein >100 mg/dL (RR 8.3, CI: 1.1-60.4), peak D-dimer >3,000 ng/mL (RR 4.3, CI: 1.03-18.2), bilirubin >1 mg/dL (RR 3.9, CI: 1.5-10.4), and history of peripheral vascular disease (RR 3.2, CI: 1.2-9.1) were associated with mortality. Dialysis COVID-19-infected patients were more likely to develop thromboembolic complications than those without COVID-19 (RR 3.7, CI: 1.3-10.1). CONCLUSION: In a predominantly African-American population, the mortality of end-stage kidney disease patients admitted with COVID-19 infection was 17%.

Endoscopic activity has had frequent disruptions during this pandemic. The objective of the study was to see the influence of pandemic over the endoscopic activity. Methods: This retrospective analysis of endoscopic activity was undertaken at Nishtar Hospital Multan. Procedural analysis was done in the three months immediately after covid lockdown (1st April till 30th June 2020) and was compared to a similar period one year back. Results: Five hundred and fifty-four (68.5%) patients underwent endoscopic procedures during the three months of pre-COVID era, while this number reduced to half (n=255, 31.5%) patients during the covid pandemic. Even though the absolute number of Esophagogastroduodenoscopies (EGDs) reduced during the pandemic, patients were more likely to undergo EGDs during the COVID pandemic in contrast to the era before the pandemic (79% versus 66%, p = 0.002). The most common indication for EGD was upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB). The percentage of EGDs done for UGIB rose from almost 60% to 80% during the covid pandemic (p < 0.001). The most common findings were esophageal varices and portal gastropathy (non-significant difference during and before the pandemic). Percentage of ERCPs done for obstructive jaundice doubled during the COVID pandemic (33% versus 65%, p = 0.002).The most common indication for sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy was lower gastrointestinal bleeding. However, no significant difference was found before and during the covid pandemic (41.7% and 45.8% respectively, p=0.72). Internal hemorrhoids were the most common endoscopic finding. Colon cancer diagnosis reduced from 10% to undetected during the pandemic period. Conclusion: COVID pandemic resulted in a considerable reduction in all types of endoscopic procedures. The majority of procedures were done for emergency indications like gastrointestinal bleeding. Rates of cancer detection were significantly reduced.

In addition, perceivers should perceive such relationships directly, rather than by combining lower-order constituents of the affordance, such as non-affordance properties of the animal or the environment. In the present study, we investigated whether this latter claim applied to perception of superordinate affordances - affordances that emerge from relations between lower-order affordances. We asked whether perception of a superordinate affordance for reaching by different means would be reducible to a combination of lower-order constituents of that affordance. Participants reported the maximum height that they would be able to reach with their arm alone versus with a hand-held tool. In both cases, reported judgments of maximum reaching height differed from an additive model in which values were computed from a combination of perceived lower-order constituents of the affordance. The results are consistent with the ecological claim that affordances are perceived, ""as such,"" rather than being computed or inferred from constituent properties, even when those constituent properties are, themselves, affordances.","Wagman, Jeffrey B; Stoffregen, Thomas A",Atten. percept. psychophys.

The authors support with their findings the theory that the furin cleavage site insertion present in SARS-CoV-2 is natural. Because no nucleotide alignment with closely related strains of the region coding for the supposed insertion is provided by Zhou et al., we have applied several alignment algorithms to search for the most parsimonious alignments. We conclude that RmYN02 does not contain an insertion at the S1/S2 junction when compared to its closest relatives at the nucleotide level, but rather a 6-nucleotide deletion and that the claimed PAA insertion is more likely to be the result of mutations. A close examination of RmYN02 sequencing records and assembly methods is wishful. In conclusion, SARS-CoV-2, with its 12-nucleotide insertion at the S1/S2 junction remains unique among its sarbecovirus relatives.","Deigin, Yuri; Inc., Rossana Segreto Youthereum Genetics; Toronto,; Canada, ON; Microbiology, Department of; Innsbruck, University of; Austria,",,420,1

OBJECTIVES: The present cross-sectional meta-research study aimed to assess the availability of open data and metrics of articles pertaining to the COVID-19 outbreak in five high-impact journals. METHODS: All articles regarding the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), published in five high-impact journals (Ann Intern Med, BMJ, JAMA, NEJM and Lancet) until March 14, 2020 were retrieved. Metadata (namely the type of article, number of authors, number of patients, citations, errata, news and social media mentions) were extracted for each article in each journal in a systematic way. Google Scholar and Scopus were used for citations and author metrics respectively, and Altmetrics and PlumX were used for news and social media mentions retrieval. The degree of adherence to the PHEIC open data call was also evaluated. RESULTS: A total of 140 articles were published until March 14, 2020, mostly opinion papers. Sixteen errata followed these publications. The number of authors in each article ranged from 1 to 63, whereas the number of patients with a laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection reached 2645.

Janus wettability between the adaxial and abaxial sides of the banana leaf surface is revealed for the first time in this work. This has relevance for the preparation of bionic materials and an important role in the efficient and high-quality production management of pesticide spraying in banana orchards. The main purpose of this research is to analyze and study the microscale mechanism and coupling relationship between the Janus wettability of banana leaf surface and the microstructure and micromorphology. We adopt advanced modern instrument analysis technology, such as contact angle (CA) measurements, field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), X-ray spectrometric analysis (EDS), and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and performed tests on the adaxial and abaxial sides of banana leaves to investigate the cause of Janus wettability. The results show that banana leaves exhibit different degrees of anisotropy, mainly due to the surface micromorphology. Banana leaves exhibit a hydrophilic Wenzel state on the adaxial side and a weakly hydrophobic Cassie-Baxter state on the abaxial side. We focused on studying the coupling effect and found that the main coupling element impacting the Janus wettability of the banana leaf surface is the nanopillars microstructure, and the secondary coupling element is the content of hydrophilic functional groups on the surface. This work may lead to the design and fabrication of Janus wetting surfaces by mimicking the nanopillar structure on banana leaf surfaces and help explore the potential application of efficient and high-quality pesticide spraying in banana orchards.","Jiang, Yinlong; Duan, Jieli; Jiang, Tingting; Yang, Zhou",Micron,420,33

In the context of marked improvement in SARS-CoV-2 testing infrastructure, we sought to examine the alignment of testing with epidemic intensity to mitigate subsequent waves of COVID-19 in Massachusetts. METHODS: We compiled publicly available weekly SARS-CoV-2 molecular testing data for period (May 27 to October 14, 2020) following the initial COVID-19 wave. We defined testing intensity as weekly SARS-CoV-2 tests performed per 100,000 population and used weekly test positivity (percent of tests positive) as a measure of epidemic intensity. We considered optimal alignment of testing resources to be matching community ranks of testing and positivity. In communities with a lower rank of testing than positivity in a given week, the testing gap was calculated as the additional tests required to achieve matching ranks. Multivariable Poisson modeling was utilized to assess for trends and association with community characteristics. RESULTS: During the observation period, 4,262,000 tests were reported in Massachusetts and the misalignment of testing with epidemic intensity increased. The weekly testing gap increased 9.0% per week (adjusted rate ratio [aRR]: 1.090, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.08–1.10). Increasing levels of community socioeconomic vulnerability (aRR: 1.35 per quartile increase, 95% CI: 1.23–1.50) and the highest quartile of minority and language vulnerability (aRR: 1.46, 95% CI 0.96–1.49) were associated with increased testing gaps, but the latter association was not statistically significant. Presence of large university student population (>10% of population) was associated with a marked decrease in testing gap (aRR 0.21, 95% CI: 0.12–0.38). CONCLUSION: These analyses indicate that despite objectives to promote equity and enhance epidemic control in vulnerable communities, testing resources across Massachusetts have been disproportionally allocated to more affluent communities. Worsening structural inequities in access to SARS-CoV-2 testing increase the risk for another intense wave of COVID-19 in Massachusetts, particularly among vulnerable communities.","Dryden-Peterson, Scott; Velásquez, Gustavo E.; Stopka, Thomas J.; Davey, Sonya; Lockman, Shahin; Ojikutu, Bisola",medRxiv,420,24

PM(2.5) and NO(2) are the most significant pollutant agents responsible for facilitating COVID-19 attributed death rates. Besides, we found only six out of many tested causal inferences to be significant and true within the AUPRC analysis. In line with the causal findings, a unidirectional causal effect is found from PM(2.5) to Deaths, NO(2) to Deaths, and economic growth to both PM(2.5) and NO(2). Corroborating the first experiment, the causal results confirmed the capability of polluting variables (PM(2.5) to Deaths, NO(2) to Deaths) to accelerate COVID-19 deaths.

This shows how unsustainable economic growth could increase environmental pollution by escalating emissions of pollutant agents (PM(2.5) and NO(2)) in New York state.","Magazzino, Cosimo; Mele, Marco; Sarkodie, Samuel Asumadu",J Environ Manage,420,11

Materials and methods: We retrospectively examined 162 patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test. All cases were evaluated separately by radiologists (visually) and by using three computer software programs: (1) Thoracic VCAR software, GE Healthcare, United States; (2) Myrian, Intrasense, France; (3) InferRead, InferVision Europe, Wiesbaden, Germany. The degree of lesions was visually scored by the radiologist using a score on 5 levels (none, mild, moderate, severe, and critic). The parameters obtained using the computer tools included healthy residual lung parenchyma, ground-glass opacity area, and consolidation volume. Intraclass coefficient (ICC), Spearman correlation analysis, and non-parametric tests were performed. Results: Thoracic VCAR software was not able to perform volumes segmentation in 26/162 (16.0%) cases, Myrian software in 12/162 (7.4%) patients while InferRead software in 61/162 (37.7%) patients. A great variability (ICC ranged for 0.17 to 0.51) was detected among the quantitative measurements of the residual healthy lung parenchyma volume, GGO, and consolidations volumes calculated by different computer tools. The overall radiological severity score was moderately correlated with the residual healthy lung parenchyma volume obtained by ThoracicVCAR or Myrian software, with the GGO area obtained by the ThoracicVCAR tool and with consolidation volume obtained by Myrian software. Quantified volumes by InferRead software had a low correlation with the overall radiological severity score. Conclusions: Computer-aided pneumonia quantification could be an easy and feasible way to stratify COVID-19 cases according to severity; however, a great variability among quantitative measurements provided by computer tools should be considered.","Grassi, Roberto; Cappabianca, Salvatore; Urraro, Fabrizio; Feragalli, Beatrice; Montanelli, Alessandro; Patelli, Gianluigi; Granata, Vincenza; Giacobbe, Giuliana; Russo, Gaetano Maria; Grillo, Assunta; De Lisio, Angela; Paura, Cesare; Clemente, Alfredo; Gagliardi, Giuliano; Magliocchetti, Simona; Cozzi, Diletta; Fusco, Roberta; Belfiore, Maria Paola; Grassi, Roberta; Miele, Vittorio",Int J Environ Res Public Health,420,1

Currently, it is important to contextualize COVID-19 fatality to guide mitigation efforts. Objectives: The objective of this study was to assess the ecological factors (policy, health behaviors, socio-economic, physical environment, and clinical care) associated with COVID-19 case fatality rate (CFR) in the United States. Methods: Data from the New York Times’ COVID-19 repository and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Data (01/21/2020 - 02/27/2021) were used. County-level CFR was modeled using the Spatial Durbin model (SDM). The SDM estimates were decomposed into direct and indirect impacts. Results: The study found percent positive for COVID-19 (0.057% point), stringency index (0.014% point), percent diabetic (0.011% point), long-term care beds (log) (0.010% point), premature age-adjusted mortality (log) (0.702 % point), income inequality ratio (0.078% point), social association rate (log) (0.014% point), percent 65 years old and over (0.055% point), and percent African Americans (0.016% point) in a given county were positively associated with its COVID-19 CFR. The study also found food insecurity, long-term beds (log), mental health-care provider (log), workforce in construction, social association rate (log), and percent diabetic of a given county as well as neighboring county were associated with given county’s COVID-19 CFR, indicating significant externalities. Conclusion: The spatial models identified percent positive for COVID-19, stringency index, elderly, college education, race/ethnicity, residential segregation, premature mortality, income inequality, workforce composition, and rurality as important ecological determinants of the geographic disparities in COVID-19 CFR.","Kathe, Niranjan J.; Wani, Rajvi J.",Journal of Health Economics and Outcomes Research,420,1

A novel synthetic approach for the same is always a beneficial addition to the literature. Henceforth, for the first time, we report the formation of three new Pd(II) complexes through the Michael addition pathway. Three chromone-based thiosemicarbazone ligands (SVSL1–SVSL3) and Pd(II) complexes (1–3) were synthesized and characterized by analytical and spectroscopic tools. The Michael addition pathway for the formation of complexes was confirmed by spectroscopic studies. Distorted square planar structure of complex 2 was confirmed by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. Complexes 1–3 were subjected to DNA- and BSA-binding studies. The complex with cyclohexyl substituent on the terminal N of thiosemicarbazone (3) showed the highest binding efficacy toward these biomolecules, which was further understood through molecular docking studies. The anticancer potential of these complexes was studied preliminarily by using MTT assay in cancer and normal cell lines along with the benchmark drugs (cisplatin, carboplatin, and gemcitabine). It was found that complex 3 was highly toxic toward MDA-MB-231 and AsPC-1 cancer cells with IC(50) values of 0.5 and 0.9 μM, respectively, and was more efficient than the standard drugs. The programmed cell death mechanism of the complexes in MDA-MB-231 cancer cells was confirmed. Furthermore, the complexes induced apoptosis via ROS-mediated mitochondrial signaling pathway. Conveniently, all the complexes showed less toxicity (≥50 μM) against MCF-10a normal cell line. Molecular docking studies were performed with VEGFR2, EGFR, and SARS-CoV-2 main protease to illustrate the binding efficiency of the complexes with these receptors. To our surprise, binding potential of the complexes with SARS-CoV-2 main protease was higher than that with chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine.","Haribabu, Jebiti; Srividya, Swaminathan; Mahendiran, Dharmasivam; Gayathri, Dasararaju; Venkatramu, Vemula; Bhuvanesh, Nattamai; Karvembu, Ramasamy",Inorg Chem,420,24

It is currently known that six CoV are able to infect pigs. Four of them belong to the genus Alphacoronavirus [transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TEGV), porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV), porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), swine acute diarrhea syndrome coronavirus (SADS-CoV)], one of them to the genus Betacoronavirus [porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (PHEV)] and the last one to the genus Deltacoronavirus (PDCoV). PHEV was one of the first identified swine CoV and is still widespread, causing subclinical infections in pigs in several countries. PRCV, a spike deletion mutant of TGEV associated with respiratory tract infection, appeared in the 1980s. PRCV is considered non-pathogenic since its infection course is mild or subclinical. Since its appearance, pig populations have become immune to both PRCV and TGEV, leading to a significant reduction in the clinical and economic importance of TGEV. TGEV, PEDV and PDCoV are enteropathogenic CoV and cause clinically indistinguishable acute gastroenteritis in all age groups of pigs. PDCoV and SADS-CoV have emerged in 2014 (US) and in 2017 (China), respectively. Rapid diagnosis is crucial for controlling CoV infections and preventing them from spreading. Since vaccines are available only for some porcine CoV, prevention should focus mainly on a high level of biosecurity. In view of the diversity of CoV and the potential risk factors associated with zoonotic emergence, updating the knowledge concerning this area is essential.","Turlewicz-Podbielska, Hanna; Pomorska-Mól, Małgorzata",Virol Sin,420,16

As such, attempts at measurement can suffer several limitations which risk leading to inadequate indices or representations. In this study, we critically review common indicators of HR capacity and performance and explore their strengths and limitations. The paper is informed by review of data sources and documents, combined with interviews and peer-to-peer learning activities conducted with officials working in health and education ministries in a set of nine African countries. We find that many metrics that can assess HR performance have gaps in the conceptualisation or fail to address local contextual realities, which makes it a challenge to interpret them in relation to other theoretical constructs. Our study identified several concepts that are excluded from current definitions of indicators and systems of metrics for HR performance. These omissions may be particularly important for interpreting HR performance within the context and processes of HR in African countries, and thus challenging the relevance, utility, appropriateness and acceptability of universal measures of HR in the region. We discuss the challenges that scholars may find in conceptualising such a complex phenomenon—including the different and competing viewpoints of stakeholders, in setting objectives of HR measurement work, and in navigating the realities of empirical measurement where missing or partial data may necessitate that proxies or alternative indicators may be chosen. These findings are important to ensure that the global health community does not rely on over-simplistic evaluations of HR when analysing and planning for improvements in low-income and middle-income countries.","Mijumbi-Deve, Rhona; Parkhurst, Justin; Jones, Catherine; Juma, Pamela A; Sobngwi-Tambekou, Joelle L; Wenham, Clare",BMJ Glob Health,420,16

A few cases of GBS associated with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) infection have been reported. To identify specific clinical features of GBS associated with COVID‐19. METHODS: We searched Pubmed, EMBASE and Cochrane from November 1, 2019 to May 17, 2020 and included all papers with full text in English, Spanish, French, or Italian, reporting original data of patients with GBS and COVID‐19. Data were extracted according to a predefined protocol. RESULTS: A total of 18 patients reported in 14 papers were included in this review. All the patients were symptomatic for COVID‐19, with cough and fever as the most frequently reported symptoms. The interval between the onset of symptoms of COVID‐19 and the first symptoms of GBS ranged from ‐8 to 24 days (mean 9 days; median 10 days). Most of the patients had a typical GBS clinical form predominantly with a demyelinating electrophysiological subtype. Mechanical ventilation was necessary in 8 (44%) patients. Two (11%) patients died. CONCLUSIONS: Published cases of GBS associated with COVID‐19 report a sensorimotor, predominantly demyelinating GBS with a typical clinical presentation. Clinical features and disease course seem similar to those observed in GBS related to other etiologies. These results should be interpreted with caution since only 18 cases have been heterogeneously reported so far.","De Sanctis, Paolo; Doneddu, Pietro Emiliano; Viganò, Luca; Selmi, Carlo; Nobile‐Orazio, Eduardo",Eur J Neurol,420,21

Human cases of Nipah virus infection, apparently unassociated with infection in livestock, have been reported in Bangladesh since 2001. Species of fruit bats (genus Pteropus ) have been identified as natural hosts of both agents. Anthropogenic changes (habitat loss, hunting) that have impacted the population dynamics of Pteropus species across much of their range are hypothesised to have facilitated emergence. Current strategies for the management of henipaviruses are directed at minimising contact with the natural hosts, monitoring identified intermediate hosts, improving biosecurity on farms, and better disease recognition and diagnosis. Investigation of the emergence and ecology of henipaviruses warrants a broad, cross-disciplinary ecosystem health approach that recognises the critical linkages between human activity, ecological change, and livestock and human health.","Field, H.

Identification of antigenic regions on pathogen proteins will play a pivotal role in designer vaccine immunotherapy. We have developed a system that not only identifies high binding T-cell antigenic epitopes, but also class I T-cell antigenic clusters termed immunological hot spots. Methods: MULTIPRED, a computational system for promiscuous prediction of HLA class I binders, uses artificial neural networks (ANN) and hidden Markov models (HMM) as predictive engines. The models were rigorously trained, tested and validated using experimentally identified HLA class I T-cell epitopes from human melanoma related proteins and human papillomavirus proteins E6 and E7. We have developed a scoring scheme for identification of immunological hot spots for HLA class I molecules, which is the sum of the highest four predictions within a window of 30 amino acids. Results: Our predictions against experimental data from four melanoma-related proteins showed that MULTIPRED ANN and HMM models could predict T-cell epitopes with high accuracy. The analysis of proteins E6 and E7 showed that ANN models appear to be more accurate for prediction of HLA-A3 hot spots and HMM models for HLA-A2 predictions. For illustration of its utility we applied MULTIPRED for prediction of promiscuous T-cell epitopes in all four SARS coronavirus structural proteins. MULTIPRED predicted HLA-A2 and HLA-A3 hot spots in each of these proteins.","Srinivasan, K.N.; Zhang, G.L.; Khan, A.M.; August, J.T.; Brusic, V.",Bioinformatics,420,27

Diagnostic radiographers in Gauteng providing chest CT, chest radiograph and MRI services are frontline workers experiencing these unprecedented times. Therefore, this study undertook to explore diagnostic radiographers’ experiences of COVID-19. Methods A qualitative approach using an asynchronous opened-ended online questionnaire was used to explore diagnostic radiographers’ experiences of COVID-19. Responses from purposively sampled diagnostic radiographers in Gauteng SA, underwent thematic analysis. Results Sixty diagnostic radiographers representing both the private and public health sector responded to the questionnaire. Thematic analysis revealed three themes: new work flow and operations, effect on radiographer well-being and radiographer resilience. Conclusion Besides experiencing a shift in their professional work routine and home/family dynamics, diagnostic radiographers’ well-being has also been impacted by COVID-19. Adapting to the “new way of work” has been challenging yet their resilience and dedication to their profession, providing quality patient care and skill expertise is their arsenal to combat these challenges. Implications for practice Understanding the impact of COVID-19 on diagnostic radiographers will allow radiology departments’ management, hospital management, professional bodies and educational institutions to re-evaluate provision of resources, training, employee wellness programs as well as policies and procedures.

HYPOTHESIS: Fecal calprotectin and IgA concentrations in puppies are not influenced by fecal moisture in puppies but by enteropathogen shedding. ANIMALS: Three hundred and twenty‐four puppies. METHODS: Fecal consistency was assessed by gross examination. Fecal moisture was evaluated before and after lyophilization. Canine parvovirus and coronavirus were detected in feces by qPCR and qRT‐PCR respectively. Giardia intestinalis antigen was quantified by ELISA. The standard McMaster flotation technique was used to detect eggs and oocysts in feces. Fecal calprotectin and IgA concentrations were quantified by in‐house radioimmunoassays. RESULTS: For each marker (IgA and calprotectin), a strong positive correlation was observed between concentration in fresh feces and concentration in fecal dry matter. 75.6% of the puppies were found to be infected by at ≥1 of the enteropathogens evaluated. Fecal calprotectin concentration was significantly influenced by age (P = .001), with higher concentrations in younger puppies, but not by viral (P = .863) or parasitic infection (P = .791).

While early solutions such as AromaRama and Smell-O-Vision were beset by technical challenges, low-tech scratch and sniff (Odorama) and, more recently, Edible Cinema-type solutions (where the audience get to consume flavourful, and often aromatic, morsels in time with the events on screen) have proved somewhat more successful. Nevertheless, there are a number of key psychological factors that will likely inhibit the uptake of scented cinema in the future, even should the technical and financial issues (associated with retrofitting cinemas, and providing the appropriate fragrances) one day be satisfactorily resolved. These include the phenomenon of “inattentional anosmia” as well as the “fundamental misattribution error,” whereby people (who are, by-and-large, visually-dominant) tend to attribute their enjoyment to the action seen on screen, rather than to smell, and hence are unlikely to pay a premium for the latter.","Spence, Charles",Iperception,420,23

Technically, fast laboratory testing is vital to develop an effective surveillance and monitoring system of counterfeit medicines. This study proposed the combination of Attenuated Total Reflectance Fourier Transform Infrared (ATR-FTIR) and Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) for the quick detection of counterfeit medicines, through the polymer analysis of blister packaging materials. A sample set containing three sets of original and counterfeit medicine was analyzed using ATR-FTIR and DSC, while the spectra from ATR-FTIR were employed as a fingerprint for the polymer characterization. Intending to analyze the polymeric material of each sample, DSC was set at a heating rate of 10 °C min(−l) and within a temperature range of 0–400 °C, with nitrogen as a purge gas at a flow rate of 20 mL min(−1). The ATR-FTIR spectra revealed the chemical characteristics of the plastic packaging of fake and original medicines. Further analysis of the counterfeit medicine’s packaging with DSC exhibited a distinct difference from the original due to the composition of polymers in the packaging material used. Overall, this study confirmed that the rapid analysis of polymeric materials through ATR-FTIR and comparing DSC thermograms of the plastic in their packaging effectively distinguished counterfeit drug products.","Salim, Mohammad Rizalmazli; Widodo, Riyanto Teguh; Noordin, Mohamed Ibrahim",Polymers (Basel),420,15

A total of 738 COVID-19 survivors participated in the study, of whom 237 (32.1%) were hospitalized for COVID-19 treatment while 501 (76.9%) were not hospitalized, and 320 (43.4%) were females and 418 (56.6%) were males. Overall, no significant difference was noted in healthy diet score between males and females; however, this score was significantly lower for Saudis compared to non-Saudis. Among the non-hospitalized patients, eating a more healthy diet was associated with a shorter duration of recovery (p < 0.05) and was significantly affected by gender (15.8 ± 9.3 male vs. 12.1 ± 8.9 female; p < 0.001) and marital status (12.1 ± 8.4 singles vs. 13.7 ± 9.3 married vs. 16.1 ± 11.8 divorced; p < 0.05).

METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CINAHL for peer‐reviewed communications, letters, and manuscripts published during the COVID‐19 pandemic evaluating medication taking among individuals with rheumatic diseases. We appraised assessment and reporting of medication adherence according to established definitions of three distinct problems of medication taking (i.e., non‐initiation, poor implementation, and discontinuation) and pooled findings using random effects models. RESULTS: We included 31 peer‐reviewed studies in our synthesis from various jurisdictions, of which 25 described medication taking among rheumatology patients and 6 described medication prescribing among rheumatology providers. The pooled prevalence of overall medication non‐adherence was 14.8% (confidence interval [CI]: 12.3%, 17.2%) and that of medication discontinuation (i.e., stopping of prescriptions) and poor implementation (i.e., not taking medication at the dose/frequency prescribed) as 9.5% (CI: 5.1%, 14.0%) and 9.6% (CI: 6.2%, 13.0%), respectively. Non‐initiation (i.e., not starting/not filling new prescriptions) was not addressed. CONCLUSIONS: Medication taking among individuals with rheumatic diseases during the COVID‐19 pandemic varies globally. Unclear reporting and extensive variation in research methods between studies creates barriers to research replication, comparison, and generalization to specific patient populations. Future research in this area should use consistent and transparent approaches to defining and measuring medication taking problems in order to ensure findings appropriately describe the epidemiology of medication adherence and have the potential to identify modifiable targets for improving patient care.","Rebić, Nevena; Park, Jamie; Garg, Ria; Ellis, Ursula; Kelly, Ayano; Davidson, Eileen; De Vera, Mary A.",Arthritis Care Res (Hoboken),420,1

However, recent serological survey reported that several percent of population showed IgG positive to SARS-CoV-2. Specificity in the assays might influence the estimate, and possibility of overdiagnosis should be investigated. Serological tests for SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus were performed in pre-COVID-19 sera in Japan (400 healthy subjects in 2012–2015). Lateral flow assay (LFA) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) showed 1.5% (6/400) and 1.75% (7/400) IgG positives, respectively. Among those false positive samples, only one sample was positive in both LFA and ELISA (0.25%; 95% CI: 0.006–1.39%). Possible bias from pooling method was examined by Monte Carlo method and the possibility was unlikely at low false positive rate. Previous surveys might overestimate COVID-19 seroprevalence in several populations of Japan. These false positives could be excluded by combination of different diagnostics.

E1‐deleted adenoviruses replicate to high titer in PER.C6 cells whereas subsequent deletion of E2A from the vector results in absence of replication in PER.C6 cells and drastically lowers the expression of adenovirus proteins in such cells. We therefore considered the use of an ΔE1/ΔE2 type 5 vector (Ad5) to deliver genes to PER.C6 cells growing in suspension with the aim to achieve high protein yield. To evaluate the utility of this system we constructed ΔE1/ΔE2 vector carrying different classes of protein, that is, the gene coding for spike protein derived from the Coronavirus causing severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS‐CoV), a gene coding for the SARS‐CoV receptor or the genes coding for an antibody shown to bind and neutralize SARS‐CoV (SARS‐AB). The ΔE1/ΔE2A‐vector backbones were rescued on a PER.C6 cell line engineered to constitutively over express the Ad5 E2A protein. Exposure of PER.C6 cells to low amounts (30 vp/cell) of ΔE1/ΔE2 vectors resulted in highly efficient (>80%) transduction of PER.C6 cells growing in suspension. The efficient cell transduction resulted in high protein yield (up to 60 picogram/cell/day) in a 4 day batch production protocol. FACS and ELISA assays demonstrated the biological activity of the transiently produced proteins. We therefore conclude that ΔE1/ΔE2 vectors in combination with the PER.C6 technology may provide a viable answer to the increasing demand for high quality, high yield recombinant protein. Biotechnol.

However, with the rapid development of the COVID-19 pandemic, there is little direct evidence available in infected patients. The objective of this scoping review is to examine the availability and nature of literature describing the effect of probiotics in adults with conditions or infections similar to COVID-19 infection, on related health outcomes. MEDLINE, CINAHL and Cochrane Databases were searched for studies, published from 1999 to May 1, 2020, examining the effect of probiotics in conditions applicable to individuals infected with COVID-19, including, but not limited to, other forms of coronavirus, critical illness, and mechanical ventilation. The databases search identified 1,925 unique articles, 77 full-text articles were reviewed, and 48 studies were included in this scoping review, including 31 primary studies and 17 systematic reviews. Primary studies examined a range of interventions that varied by probiotic diversity and types, including eight studies which focused on synbiotics, which include both pre- and probiotics. Several systematic reviews examined the effect of probiotics on ventilator-associated pneumonia and other infections. While most systematic reviews concluded probiotics may improve these outcomes, most systematic review authors concluded that the evidence was low in quality and high in heterogeneity. In the absence of direct evidence with COVID-19 infected patients, studies in comparable populations are currently the best resource to guide probiotics interventions in conjunction with clinical expertise and multidisciplinary healthcare planning.","Rozga, Mary; Cheng, Feon W.; Handu, Deepa",J Acad Nutr Diet,420,26

OBJECTIVE: We aimed to understand the reasons why patients tend to avoid using online medical records and to compare the perceptions that patients have of online medical records based on demographics and cancer diagnosis. METHODS: We used data from the Health Information National Trends Survey Cycle 3, a nationally representative survey, and assessed outcomes using descriptive statistics and chi-square tests. The patients (N=4328) included in the analysis had experienced an outpatient visit within the previous 12 months and had answered the online behavior question regarding their use of online medical records. RESULTS: Patients who were nonusers of online medical records consisted of 58.36% of the sample (2526/4328). The highest nonuser rates were for patients who were Hispanic (460/683, 67.35%), patients who were non-Hispanic Black (434/653, 66.46%), and patients who were older than 65 years (968/1520, 63.6%). Patients older than 65 years were less likely to use online medical records (odds ratio [OR] 1.51, 95% CI 1.24-1.84, P<.001). Patients who were White were more likely to use online medical records than patients who were Black (OR 1.71, 95% CI 1.43-2.05, P<.001) or Hispanic (OR 1.65, 95% CI 1.37-1.98, P<.001). Patients who were diagnosed with cancer were more likely to use online medical records compared to patients with no cancer (OR 1.31, 95% CI 1.11-1.55, 95% CI 1.11-1.55, P=.001). Among nonusers, older patients (≥65 years old) preferred speaking directly to their health care providers (OR 1.76, 95% CI 1.35-2.31, P<.001), were more concerned about privacy issues caused by online medical records (OR 1.79, 95% CI 1.22-2.66, P<.001), and felt uncomfortable using the online medical record systems (OR 10.55, 95% CI 6.06-19.89, P<.001) compared to those aged 18-34 years. Patients who were Black or Hispanic were more concerned about privacy issues (OR 1.42, 1.09-1.84, P=.007).

The SARS-CoV-2 was found to be closely related to the SARS-CoV, based on the genomic analysis. The Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 protein (ACE2) utilized by the SARS-CoV as a receptor was found to facilitate the infection of SARS-CoV-2 as well, initiated by the binding of the spike protein to the human ACE2. Using homology modeling and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation methods, we report here the detailed structure of the ACE2 in complex with the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. The predicted model is highly consistent with the experimentally determined complex structures. Plausible binding modes between human ACE2 and the RBD were revealed from all-atom MD simulations. The simulation data further revealed critical residues at the complex interface and provided more details about the interactions between the SARS-CoV-2 RBD and human ACE2. Two mutants mimicking rat ACE2 were modeled to study the mutation effects on RBD binding to ACE2. The simulations showed that the N-terminal helix and the K353 of the human ACE2 alter the binding modes of the CoV2-RBD to the ACE2.","Lupala, Cecylia S.; Li, Xuanxuan; Lei, Jian; Chen, Hong; Qi, Jianxun; Liu, Haiguang; Su, Xiao-dong",bioRxiv,420,21

Investigating the microbial composition across different cities enables us to unravel city-specific microbial signatures and further predict the origin of unknown samples. As part of the CAMDA 2020 Metagenomic Geolocation Challenge, MetaSUB provided the whole genome shotgun (WGS) metagenomics data from samples across 28 cities along with non-microbial city data for 23 of these cities. In our solution to this challenge, we implemented feature selection, normalization, clustering and three methods of machine learning to classify the cities based on their microbial compositions. Of the three methods, multilayer perceptron obtained the best performance with an error rate of 19.60% based on whether the correct city received the highest or second highest number of votes for the test data contained in the main dataset. We then trained the model to predict the origins of samples from the mystery dataset by including these samples with the additional group label of “mystery.” The mystery dataset compromised of samples collected from a subset of the cities in the main dataset as well as samples collected from new cities. For samples from cities that belonged to the main dataset, error rates ranged from 18.18 to 72.7%. For samples from new cities that did not belong to the main dataset, 57.7% of the test samples could be correctly labeled as “mystery” samples. Furthermore, we also predicted some of the non-microbial features for the mystery samples from the cities that did not belong to main dataset to draw inferences and narrow the range of the possible sample origins using a multi-output multilayer perceptron algorithm.","Zhang, Runzhi; Ellis, Dorothy; Walker, Alejandro R.; Datta, Susmita",Front Genet,420,20

Worryingly, COVID-19 with cancer is associated with a poor prognosis. Cancer patients are a vulnerable group, threatened by COVID-19, finding a way to combat COVID-19 for them is urgent. Immunonutrition is closely related to balance and strong immune function. Supplementary immunonutrition can improve the immune function and inflammatory response of cancer patients after surgery, which provides evidence for the role of immunonutrition in combating COVID-19. We reviewed possible mechanisms of immunonutrition against COVID-19, including enhancing immune cell function, increasing immune cell count, ameliorating excessive inflammatory response, and regulating gut microbiota. Immunonutrition supplementation in cancer patients may be beneficial to enhance immune function in the early stage of COVID-19 infection and control excessive inflammatory response in the late stage.

In contrast with the wt, none of these five cause fatal disease (mortality less than 10%). Three of these ts mutants did not induce any demyelinating disease, a fourth caused demyelinating disease in 5% of the animals and a fifth, designated ts8, exhibited strong demyelinating properties and caused demyelination in 99% of the animals. SDS-PAGE analysis revealed no differences in the molecular weight of S peplomer protein of wt or ts MHV-JHM mutants.

Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play important roles in a number of biological process including inflammation response. However, whether lncRNAs participate in TGEV-induced inflammation in porcine intestinal epithelial cells (IPECs) is largely unknown. RESULTS: In this study, the next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology was used to analyze the profiles of lncRNAs in Mock and TGEV-infected porcine intestinal epithelial cell-jejunum 2 (IPEC-J2) cell line. A total of 106 lncRNAs were differentially expressed. Many differentially expressed lncRNAs act as elements to competitively attach microRNAs (miRNAs) which target to messenger RNA (mRNAs) to mediate expression of genes that related to toll-like receptors (TLRs), NOD-like receptors (NLRs), tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs) pathways. Functional analysis of the binding proteins and the up/down-stream genes of the differentially expressed lncRNAs revealed that lncRNAs were principally related to inflammatory response. Meanwhile, we found that the differentially expressed lncRNA TCONS_00058367 might lead to a reduction of phosphorylation of transcription factor p65 (p-p65) in TGEV-infected IPEC-J2 cells by negatively regulating its antisense gene promyelocytic leukemia (PML). CONCLUSIONS: The data showed that differentially expressed lncRNAs might be involved in inflammatory response induced by TGEV through acting as miRNA sponges, regulating their up/down-stream genes, or directly binding proteins.","Ma, Xuelian; Zhao, Xiaomin; Wang, Kaili; Tang, Xiaoyi; Guo, Jianxiong; Mi, Mi; Qi, Yanping; Chang, Lingling; Huang, Yong; Tong, Dewen",BMC Genomics,420,20

Recent advances in nanoparticle concentration have given rise to many novel detection methodologies, which address the shortcomings in modern clinical assays. Here, we review the primary, well-characterized methods for nanoparticle concentration in the context of viral detection via diffusion, centrifugation and microfiltration, electric and magnetic fields, and nano-microfluidics. Details of the concentration mechanisms and examples of related applications provide valuable information to design portable, integrated sensors.

It included 720 recipients who had COVID‐19 and 1680 controls composed by recipients in follow‐up who did not contact the transplantation center for COVID‐19 symptoms, up to the moment of their inclusion in the study. HLA‐A, ‐B, and ‐DRB1 allele groups and ABO frequencies were compared between recipients with COVID‐19 (all cases, or separately mild/moderate and severe disease) and controls. The HLA association study was conducted in two case–control series and only associations that showed a p‐value <0.05 in both series were considered. No HLA association regarding COVID‐19 occurrence or severity met this criterion. Homozygosity at HLA‐A locus was associated with COVID‐19 susceptibility (odds ratio 1.4) but not severity. Blood groups A and O were associated with susceptibility and resistance to COVID‐19, respectively. COVID‐19 severity was associated only with older age and cardiac disease, in a multivariate analysis. We conclude that an influence of HLA on COVID‐19 susceptibility is supported by the association with homozygosity at HLA‐A locus but that there is no evidence for a role of any particular HLA‐A, ‐B, or ‐DRB1 polymorphism. Thus, we suggest that what matters is the overall capability of an individual's HLA molecules to present SARS‐CoV‐2 peptides to T cells, a factor that might have a great influence on the breadth of the immune response.","De Marco, Renato; Faria, Tathyane C.; Mine, Karina L.; Cristelli, Marina; Medina‐Pestana, José O.; Tedesco‐Silva, Hélio; Gerbase‐DeLima, Maria",HLA,420,27

As in most countries of the world, in Brazil, the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic have been catastrophic. Several studies have reported the fecal shedding of SARS-CoV-2 RNA titers from infected symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals. Therefore, the quantification of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater can be used to track the virus spread in a population. In this study, samples of untreated wastewater were collected for 44 weeks at five sampling sites in the ABC Region (São Paulo, Brazil), in order to evaluate the SARS-CoV-2 occurrence in the sewerage system. SARS-CoV-2 RNA titers were detected throughout the period, and the concentration ranged from 2.7 to 7.7 log(10) genome copies.L(−1), with peaks in the last weeks of monitoring. Furthermore, we observed a positive correlation between the viral load in wastewater and the epidemiological/clinical data, with the former preceding the latter by approximately two weeks. The COVID-19 prevalence for each sampling site was estimated via Monte-Carlo simulation using the wastewater viral load. The mean predicted prevalence ranged 0.05 to 0.38%, slightly higher than reported (0.016 ± 0.005%) in the ABC Region for the same period. These results highlight the viability of the wastewater surveillance for COVID-19 infection monitoring in the largest urban agglomeration in South America.

This study was an online survey performed in Eastern, Central, and Western China between February 2021 and March 2021 using proportional sampling (n = 7381). Adults aged ≥ 18 years were included, especially younger people (aged < 65). Vaccine hesitancy was assessed using the 3C model and relative scales; logistic regression was used to explore the factors affecting vaccination uptake; structural equation modeling was used to evaluate the correlations between variables. Overall, 67.6% and 24.7% of adults reported vaccine hesitancy toward the non-EPI and COVID-19 vaccines, respectively. Participants (66.3%) reported taking the vaccine mainly based on recommendations from medical staff. Vaccine-hesitant participants (60.5%) reported a fear of side effects as the deciding factor in vaccine rejection. Vaccine hesitancy interacted negatively with confidence (β = −0.349, p < 0.001) and convenience (β = −0.232, p < 0.001), and positively with complacence (β = 0.838, p < 0.001).

Accurate detection of SARS‐CoV‐2 using molecular assays is critical for patient management and the control of the COVID‐19 pandemic. However, there is an increasing number of SARS‐CoV‐2 viruses with mutations at the primer or probe binding sites, and these mutations may affect the sensitivity of currently available real‐time reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction (RT‐PCR) assays targeting the N, E, and ORF1a/b genes. Using sequence‐independent single‐primer amplification (SISPA) and nanopore whole‐genome sequencing, we have found that the nsp1 gene, located at the 5’ end of the SARS‐CoV‐2 genome, was highly expressed in the nasopharyngeal or saliva specimens of 9 COVID‐19 patients of different clinical severity. Based on this finding, we have developed a novel nsp1 real‐time RT‐PCR assay. The primers and probes are highly specific for SARS‐CoV‐2. Validation with 101 clinical specimens showed that our nsp1 RT‐PCR assay has a sensitivity of 93.1% (95% confidence interval, 86.2‐97.2%), which was similar to those of N and E gene RT‐PCR assays. The diagnostic specificity was 100% (95% CI, 92.9‐100%). The addition of nsp1 for multi‐target detection of SARS‐CoV‐2 can avoid false negative results due to mutations at the primers/probes binding sites of currently available RT‐PCR assays.

Recently, it has been shown that Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) might protect against COVID-19. This study aims to investigate the possible correlation between BCG vaccination and morbidity/mortality/recovery rate associated with COVID-19 infection. METHODS Data of COVID-19 confirmed cases, deaths, recoveries, and population were obtained from https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/ (Accessed on 12 June, 2020). To have meaningful comparisons among countries' mortality and recovery rates, we only choose those countries with COVID-19 infected cases at least 200. The Poisson regression and logistic regression were used to explore the relationship between BCG vaccination and morbidity, mortality and recovery rates. RESULTS Among those 158 countries with at least 200 COVID-19 infected cases, there were 141 countries with BCG vaccination information available. The adjusted rates ratio of COVID-19 confirmed cases for Current BCG vaccination vs. non-Current BCG vaccination was 0.339 (with 95% CI= (0.338,0.340)). Moreover, the adjusted odds ratio (OR) of death and recovery after coronavirus infected for Current BCG vaccination vs. non-Current BCG vaccination were 0.258 (with 95% CI= (0.254,0.261)) and 2.151 (with 95% CI= (2.140,2.163)), respectively. CONCLUSIONS That data in this study show the BCG might provide the protection against COVID-19, with consequent less COVID-19 infection and deaths and more rapid recovery. BCG vaccine might bridge the gap before the disease-specific vaccine is developed, but this hypothesis needs to be further tested in rigorous randomized clinical trials.","Chang, C.-H.; Chang, Y.-C.",,420,23

CONCLUSIONS: We recommend to perform NPS after elevation of the tip of the nose in order to reduce the risk of contamination from the nasal vestible, and to let it flow over the floor of the nasal cavity in parallel to the hard palate in order to reach the nasopharynx. Then the tip of the swab should be left in place for few seconds, and then rotated in order to achieve the largest absorption of nasopharyngeal secretions.

The testing of 201 clinical specimens with this multiplex assay along with other one formerly described by our group to simultaneously detect and type the influenza viruses, respiratory syncytial viruses, and a generic detection of all serotypes of adenovirus, covers the detection of most viruses causing respiratory infectious disease in humans. The results obtained were compared with conventional viral culture, immunofluorescence assay, and a third multiplex RT‐PCR assay for all human parainfluenza viruses types described previously. In conclusion, both multiplex RT‐PCR assays provide a system capable of detecting and identifying simultaneously 14 different respiratory viruses in clinical specimens with high sensitivity and specificity, being useful for routine diagnosis and survey of these viruses within the population.

The requirement of microfluidics to generate and analyze the emulsions, however, is a barrier to its adoption, particularly in low resource settings or clinical laboratories. Here, we report a novel method to prepare ddPCR droplets by vortexing and readout of the results by bulk analysis of recovered amplicons. We demonstrate the approach by accurately quantitating SARS-CoV-2 sequences using entirely bulk processing and no microfluidics. Our approach for quantitating reactions should extend to all digital assays that generate amplicons, including digital PCR and LAMP conducted in droplets, microchambers, or nanoliter wells. More broadly, our approach combines important attributes of ddPCR, including enhanced accuracy and robustness to inhibition, with the high-volume sample processing ability of quantitative PCR.","Sun, Chen; Liu, Leqian; Vasudevan, Harish N; Chang, Kai-Chun; Abate, Adam R",Anal Chem,420,16

Thus, rapid manufacturing, scattered distribution, high design degrees of freedom, and the advantages of the low threshold of 3D printing can play important roles in the production of emergency supplies. In order to better realize the efficient distribution of 3D printing emergency supplies, this paper studies the relationship between supply and demand of 3D printing equipment and emergency supplies produced by 3D printing technology after public health emergencies. First, we fully consider the heterogeneity of user orders, 3D printing equipment resources, and the characteristics of diverse production objectives in the context of the emergent public health environment. The multi-objective optimization model for the production of 3D printing emergency supplies, which was evaluated by multiple manufacturers and in multiple disaster sites, can maximize time and cost benefits of the 3D printing of emergency supplies. Then, an improved non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) to solve the multi-objective optimization model is developed and compared with the traditional NSGA-II algorithm analysis. It contains more than one solution in the Pareto optimal solution set. Finally, the effectiveness of 3D printing is verified by numerical simulation, and it is found that it can solve the matching problem of supply and demand of 3D printing emergency supplies in public health emergencies.","He, Jianjia; Liu, Gang; Mai, Thi Hoai Thuong; Li, Ting Ting",Front Public Health,420,20

With one of the highest excess death rates globally, Ecuador had a comparatively low number of confirmed COVID-19 cases, which may have been influenced by limited availability of data for decision-making due to low laboratory capacity. METHODS: We examine de-identified data on 55,063 individuals with suspected COVID-19 between February 27 and April 30, 2020 included in the RT-PCR testing database collected by the Ministry of Health. Processing times and rates per province, and the number of pending tests, were tallied cumulatively. We assessed the relationship between sample shipping, laboratory capacity and case completion using a negative binomial generalized linear model. RESULTS: The national average time for case completion was 3 days; 12.1% of samples took ≥10 days to complete; the national average daily backlog was 29.1 tests per 100,000 people. Only 8 out of 24 provinces had authorized COVID-19 processing laboratories but not all processed samples. There was an association between samples coming from outside the processing laboratory province, the number of other samples present at the laboratory during processing, and the amount of time needed to process a sample. Samples from another province took 1.29 times as long to process, on average. The percentage of pending results on April 30 was 67.1%. CONCLUSION: A centralized RT-PCR testing system contributes to critical delays in processing, which may mask a case burden higher than reported, impeding timely awareness, and adequate clinical care and vaccination strategies and subsequent monitoring. Although Ecuador adapted or authorized existing facilities to address limitations in laboratory capacity for COVID-19, this study highlights the need to estimate and augment laboratory capabilities for improved decision making and policies on diagnostic guidelines and availability. Support is needed to procure the necessary human and physical resources at all phases of diagnostic testing, including transportation of samples and supplies, and information management.

It was thought that measures introduced to stem the pandemic, such as the lockdown, contributed to this development. However, the data on hospital admissions, delay times, and mortality are not consistent. METHODS: Our systematic literature review and meta-analysis embraced studies reporting the number of hospital admissions of patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and/or non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) during lockdown episodes. We also collected data on patient- and system-related delay times and on mortality. RESULTS: Data from 27 studies on a total of 81 163 patients were included in our meta-analysis. We found that the number of hospital admissions of patients with myocardial infarction was significantly lower during the lockdown than before the pandemic (incidence rate ratio [IRR] = 0.516 [0.403; 0.660], I2 = 98%). This was true both for patients with STEMI (IRR = 0.620 [0.514; 0.746], I2 = 96%) and for patients with NSTEMI (IRR = 0.454 [0.354; 0.584], I2 = 96%). However, we found no significant difference in the time from hospital admission to cardiac catheterization, or in mortality, in relation to the time from symptom onset to first medical contact. CONCLUSION: In this study, we have shown that the lockdown due to COVID-19 was associated with a marked decline in the number of hospital admissions of patients with myocardial infarction. As no significant effect on delay times or mortality was observed, it seems that timely medical care continued to be delivered.","Baumhardt, Michael; Dreyhaupt, Jens; Winsauer, Claudia; Stuhler, Lina; Thiessen, Kevin; Stephan, Tilman; Markovic, Sinisa; Rottbauer, Wolfgang; Imhof, Armin; Rattka, Manuel",Dtsch Arztebl Int,420,1

While this has been recognized in studies of how gatekeepers pass judgment on the works of others, little is known about how scholars deal with the uncertainty about how their work will be evaluated by gatekeepers. Building upon 35 interviews with early career academics in political science and history, this paper explores how junior scholars use appraisal devices to navigate this kind of uncertainty. Appraisal devices offer trusted and knowledgeable appraisals through which scholars are informed whether their work and they themselves are good enough to succeed in academia. Investigating how early career academics rely upon appraisals from assessors (i.e., ‘academic mentors’), the study adds to existing literature on uncertainty and worth in academic life by drawing attention to how scholars’ anticipatory practices are informed by trusting the judgment of others. The empirical analysis demonstrates that early career academics are confronted with multiple and conflicting appraisals that they must interpret and differentiate between. However, the institutional conditions for dealing with uncertainty about what counts in future evaluations, as well as which individuals generally come to function as assessors, differ between political science and history. This has an impact on both valuation practices and socialization structures. Focusing on what I call practices of appraisal devices, the paper provides a conceptual understanding of how scholars cope with uncertainties about their future. Furthermore, it expands existing theory by demonstrating how scholars’ self-concept and desired identities are key to the reflexive ways appraisal devices are used in the course of action.","Nästesjö, Jonatan",Minerva,420,16

Patient portals are a tool whose use requires similar resources and skills as those required for telehealth. Patients' capacity to use patient portals may therefore provide insight regarding patients' readiness and capacity to use telehealth. OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to examine factors related to patients' capacity to use a patient portal and test the impact of these factors on patients' portal use. RESEARCH DESIGN AND SUBJECTS Using data from a large-scale pragmatic randomized controlled trial of patient portal use, 1081 hospitalized patients responded to survey items that were then mapped onto the 4 dimensions of the Engagement Capacity Framework: self-efficacy, resources, willingness, and capabilities. MEASURES The outcome variable was frequency of outpatient portal use. We evaluated associations between Engagement Capacity Framework dimensions and patient portal use, using regression analyses. RESULTS Patients with fewer resources, fewer capabilities, lower willingness, and lower overall capacity to use patient portals used the portal less; in contrast, those with lower perceived self-efficacy used the portal more. CONCLUSIONS Our findings highlight differences in patients' capacity to use patient portals, which provide an initial understanding of factors that may influence the use of telehealth and offer important guidance in efforts to support patients' telehealth use. Offering patients training tailored to the use of telehealth tools may be particularly beneficial.","McAlearney, Ann Scheck; Sieck, Cynthia J; Gregory, Megan E; Di Tosto, Gennaro; MacEwan, Sarah R; DePuccio, Matthew J; Lee, Jennifer A; Huerta, Timothy R; Walker, Daniel M",Medical care,420,1

Once we have all the pieces of the puzzle, we will be able to successfully treat this disease with its multiple challenges. COVID-19 has a high thrombogenic potential. In this study, we aimed to review published data about COVID-19 associated thrombosis from pathophysiology to treatment and the role in patient evolution. We searched for articles and studies published online through MEDLINE/PubMed database, Google Scholar, ScienceDirect, Wiley Online Library, and Nature Public Health Emergency Collection. We found numerous articles regarding COVID-19 infection but selected only those focused on thrombosis. D-dimers have a predictive value in identifying thrombosis and a high level correlates with the severity of the infection and death. Most patients who were on chronic anticoagulant therapy before contracting the virus had a better prognosis. Heparin has other favorable effects such as a direct antiviral and anti-inflammatory effect in addition to its anticoagulant effect. COVID-19 infections are frequently complicated by thrombotic pathology. High plasma level of D-dimers is a predictive factor for severe prognosis, and the recommended anticoagulant, associated with low mortality, is heparin followed by a direct oral anticoagulant. Randomized studies in large groups of patients and therapeutic guidelines are still needed on this subject.","Bobescu, Elena; Marceanu, Luigi Geo; Covaciu, Alexandru; Vladau, Larisa Alexandra",Anatol J Cardiol,420,10

ACE2 is a SARS-Cov-2 receptor and changes in its renal expression have been linked to several human nephropathies.

We used Human Primary Proximal Tubule (HPPT) cells to show genome-wide gene expression patterns after cytokine stimulation, with emphasis on the ACE2/dACE2 locus. Putative regulatory elements controlling dACE2 expression were identified using ChIP-seq and RNA-seq. qRT-PCR differentiating between ACE2 and dACE2 revealed 300- and 600-fold upregulation of dACE2 by IFNα and IFNβ, respectively, while full length ACE2 expression was almost unchanged. JAK inhibitor ruxolitinib ablated STAT1 and dACE2 expression after interferon treatment. Finally, with RNA-seq, we identified a set of genes, largely immune-related, induced by cytokine treatment.

The study aimed to screen the most useful predictive factor for critical illness caused by COVID-19. METHODS: The study prospectively involved 61 patients with COVID-19 infection as a derivation cohort, and 54 patients as a validation cohort. The predictive factor for critical illness was selected using LASSO regression analysis. A nomogram based on non-specific laboratory indicators was built to predict the probability of critical illness. RESULTS: The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) was identified as an independent risk factor for critical illness in patients with COVID-19 infection. The NLR had an area under receiver operating characteristic of 0.849 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.707 to 0.991) in the derivation cohort and 0.867 (95% CI 0.747 to 0.944) in the validation cohort, the calibration curves fitted well, and the decision and clinical impact curves showed that the NLR had high standardized net benefit. In addition, the incidence of critical illness was 9.1% (1/11) for patients aged ≥ 50 and having an NLR < 3.13, and 50% (7/14) patients with age ≥ 50 and NLR ≥ 3.13 were predicted to develop critical illness. Based on the risk stratification of NLR according to age, this study has developed a COVID-19 pneumonia management process. CONCLUSIONS: We found that NLR is a predictive factor for early-stage prediction of patients infected with COVID-19 who are likely to develop critical illness.

We sought to examine colchicine’s effects on circulating inflammatory and metabolic molecules in adults with obesity and metabolic syndrome (MetS). METHODS: Blood samples were collected pre- and post-intervention during a double-blind randomized controlled trial in which 40 adults with obesity and MetS were randomized to colchicine 0.6 mg or placebo twice-daily for 3 months. Serum samples were analyzed for 1305 circulating factors using the SomaScan Platform. The Benjamini–Hochberg procedure was used to adjust the false discovery rate (FDR) for multiple testing. RESULTS: At baseline, age (48.0 ± 13.8 vs. 44.7 ± 10.3 years) and BMI (39.8 ± 6.4 vs. 41.8 ± 8.2 kg/m(2)) were not different between groups. After controlling for the FDR, 34 molecules were significantly changed by colchicine. Colchicine decreased concentrations of multiple inflammatory molecules, including C-reactive protein, interleukin 6, and resistin, in addition to vascular-related proteins (e.g., oxidized low-density lipoprotein receptor, phosphodiesterase 5A). Conversely, relative to placebo, colchicine significantly increased concentrations of eight molecules including secreted factors associated with metabolism and anti-thrombosis. CONCLUSIONS: In adults with obesity, colchicine significantly affected concentrations of proteins involved in the innate immune system, endothelial function and atherosclerosis, uncovering new mechanisms behind its cardiometabolic effects.

The AA population is disproportionally affected by COVID-19, in part, because they have high prevalence of underlying conditions such as obesity, diabetes, and hypertension, which are known to exacerbate not only kidney diseases, but also COVID-19. Further, a decreased adherence to COVID-19 guidelines among tobacco smokers could result in increased infection, inflammation, reduced immune response, and lungs damage, leading to more severe form of COVID-19. As a result of high prevalence of underlying conditions that cause kidney diseases in the AA population coupled with tobacco smoking make the AA population vulnerable to severe form of both COVID-19 and kidney diseases. In this review, we describe how tobacco smoking interact with SARS-CoV-2 and exacerbates SARS-CoV-2-induced kidney diseases including renal failure, especially in the AA population. We also explore the role of extracellular vesicles (EVs) in COVID-19 patients who smoke tobacco. EVs, which play important role in tobacco-mediated pathogenesis in infectious diseases, have also shown to be important in COVID-19 pathogenesis and organ injuries including kidney. Further, we explore the potential role of EVs in biomarker discovery and therapeutics, which may help to develop early diagnosis and treatment of tobacco-induced renal injury in COVID-19 patients, respectively.

We varied daily community incidence from 1 to 100 cases per 100,000 population. PATIENTS (OR PARTICIPANTS). We simulated students, faculty/staff, and adult household members. INTERVENTIONS. We evaluated isolation of symptomatic individuals, quarantine of an infected individual’s contacts, reduced class sizes, alternative schedules, staff vaccination, and weekly asymptomatic screening. MEASUREMENTS. We projected transmission among students, staff and families during one month following introduction of a single infection into a school. We also calculated the number of infections expected for a typical 8-week quarter, contingent on community incidence rate. RESULTS. School transmission risk varies according to student age and community incidence and is substantially reduced with effective, consistent mitigation measures. Nevertheless, when transmission occurs, it may be difficult to detect without regular, frequent testing due to the subclinical nature of most infections in children. Teacher vaccination can reduce transmission to staff, while asymptomatic screening both improves understanding of local circumstances and reduces transmission, facilitating five-day schedules at full classroom capacity. LIMITATIONS. There is uncertainty about susceptibility and infectiousness of children and low precision regarding the effectiveness of specific prevention measures, particularly with emergence of new variants. CONCLUSION. With controlled community transmission and moderate school-based prevention measures, elementary schools can open with few in-school transmissions, while high schools require more intensive mitigation. Asymptomatic screening should be a key component of school reopenings, allowing reopening at higher community incidence while still minimizing transmission risk.","Bilinski, Alyssa; Salomon, Joshua A.; Giardina, John; Ciaranello, Andrea; Fitzpatrick, Meagan C.",medRxiv,420,16

It looks at the circumstances of the migrants prior to the global health emergency, before exploring possibilities for a post-pandemic future for this stratum of the working people by raising critical questions addressed to agrarian movements. It does this by focusing on the nature and dynamics of the nexus of land and labour in the context of production and social reproduction, a view that in the context of rurally rooted cross-border migrant workers necessarily requires interrelated perspectives on labour, agrarian, and food justice struggles. This requires a rethinking of the role of land, not as a factor in either production or social reproduction, but as a central component in both spheres simultaneously. The question is not ‘whether’ it is necessary and desirable to forge multi-class coalitions and struggles against external capital, while not losing sight of the exploitative relations within rural communities and the household; rather, the question is ‘how’ to achieve this. It will require a messy recursive process, going back and forth between theoretical exploration and practical politics.","Borras, Saturnino M.; Franco, Jennifer C.; Ra, Doi; Kramer, Tom; Kamoon, Mi; Phyu, Phwe; Ju, Khu Khu; Vervest, Pietje; Oo, Mary; Shell, Kyar Yin; Soe, Thu Maung; Dau, Ze; Phyu, Mi; Poine, Mi Saryar; Jumper, Mi Pakao; Mon, Nai Sawor; Oo, Khun; Thu, Kyaw; Khine, Nwet Kay; Naing, Tun Tun; Papa, Nila; Htwe, Lway Htwe; Reang, Lway Hlar; Jay, Lway Poe; Jai, Naw Seng; Xu, Yunan; Wang, Chunyu; Ye, Jingzhong",Agric Human Values,420,5

Abstract Pathological consequences of a severe outbreak of swine influenza (H1N1 virus) in the non immune sow at the beginning of pregnancy, under natural conditions. A sudden acute outbreak of fever, depression, anorexia and coughing in a group of nulliparous sows from a herd that was currently under epidemiological investigation lead to build a particular disposal of observation. The clinical signs were daily recorded including rectal temperature. Blood was taken from the sows at the beginning of the troubles and 3 weeks later for the detection of Aujesky's disease, coronavirus TGE-like, Influenza viruses A/H1N1 and A/H3N2 and Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae. Viral detection was attempted from nasal swabs and aborted fetuses during the acute phase. The clinical study showed fever reaching near 41°C on most of the pigs and lasting usually from 2 to 5 days. The diagnosis of Influenza (virus swine H1N1) was established both on serology (massive seroconversion) and on the detection of the virus from the nasal swabs and from an aborted fetus. The control of the lungs of sows “not in pig” and culled showed extended lesions of bronchopneumonia and Pasteurella multocida was found. The technical consequences of this severe outbreak of Influenza on reproduction were mainly important at the beginning of pregnancy. Over 13 sows inseminated less than 1 week before the outbreak, only 3 farrowed (respectively 5,5 and 12 piglets); 7 returned to oestrus and 3 “not a pig” at 21 days (echotomography) did not show signs of heat and were culled. Over 8 pregnant sows (1 month of pregnancy), 6 farrowed normal litters and total embryonic resorption occurred in 2 sows. Over 18 pregnant sows (more than 45 days gestation) one aborted.","Madec, F.; Kaiser, Cl.; Gourreau, J. M.; Martinat-Botte, F.","Comparative Immunology, Microbiology and Infectious Diseases",420,3

Isolation and propagation of the pathogen in cell culture resulted in discovery of a novel swine enteric alphacoronavirus (tentatively named SeACoV) related to the bat coronavirus HKU2 identified in the same region a decade ago. Specific fluorescence signal was detected in Vero cells infected with SeACoV by using a positive sow serum collected in the same farm, but not by using TGEV-, PEDV- or PDCoV-specific antibody. Electron microscopy observation demonstrated that the virus particle with surface projections was 100–120 nm in diameter. Complete genomic sequencing and analyses of SeACoV indicated that the extreme amino-terminal domain of the SeACoV spike (S) glycoprotein structurally similar to the domain 0 of the alphacoronavirus NL63, whereas the rest part of S structurally resembles domains B to D of the betacoronavirus. The SeACoV-S domain 0 associated with enteric tropism had an extremely high variability, harboring 75-amino-acid (aa) substitutions and a 2-aa insertion, compared to that of HKU2, which is likely responsible for the extended host range or cross-species transmission. The isolated virus was infectious in pigs when inoculated orally into 3-day-old newborn piglets, leading to clinical signs of diarrhea and fecal virus shedding. These results confirmed that it is a novel swine enteric coronavirus representing the fifth porcine coronavirus.","Pan, Yongfei; Tian, Xiaoyan; Qin, Pan; Wang, Bin; Zhao, Pengwei; Yang, Yong-Le; Wang, Lianxiang; Wang, Dongdong; Song, Yanhua; Zhang, Xiangbin; Huang, Yao-Wei",Vet Microbiol,420,27

A Review of Seven Months of Experience Working in a COVID-19 Dedicated Centre,16.892786,6.2264075,2021-01-21,"BACKGROUND: Fangcang Hospitals (cabin hospitals) played a key role in isolation and control of the infection sources during COVID‐19 epidemic. Many patients at Fangcang Hospitals had complications or mental stress. As the doctors, nurses and paramedics presented in the emergency, there was a growing demand for clinical pharmacists to provide pharmaceutical care for the affected patients with chronic diseases via telemedicine. OBJECTIVE: This study was a retrospective study to evaluate the usefulness of clinical prevention and control measures of clinical pharmacists at Jianghan Fangcang Hospital. Besides, this study proposed innovative strategies for developing pharmacy services to ensure the medication compliance, accuracy and cure rates under the epidemic. METHODS: A total of 374 patients filled in the questionnaires and 349 patients were enrolled in this study. Patients who refused to receive pharmaceutical care were not included in this study. The pharmaceutical care included medication education via broadcast station, medication reconciliation, optimisation of drug use, monitor of adverse drug events and psychological comfort via WeChat one‐to‐one service. The data were collected from patients’ interviews and the questionnaires of inpatients and discharged patients. RESULTS: In Jianghan Fangcang Hospital, many patients had complications with hypertension (12.9%), hyperlipidaemia (9.2%), thyroid disease (8.9%), diabetes (7.2%), heart disease (3.4%), nephropathy (1.7%), cancer (1.1%) and other diseases (12.6%). After 35 days’ pharmacy service, about 200 different questions had been solved by our clinical pharmacists, including drug usage (65.38%), medication reconciliation (55.13%), drug precautions (23.1%), adverse drug reactions (35.9%) and psychological counselling (32.05%). Most patients were satisfied with clinical pharmacist service (66.7% great, 18.0% good). CONCLUSION: The results of the retrospective study indicated that clinical pharmacist can effectively reduce and prevent drug‐related, life‐related and COVID‐19‐related problems for COVID‐19 patients, which is important for the disease recovery. This study also demonstrated that clinical pharmacist played a key role for patients’ healthcare during the pandemic.","Wang, Dongyuan; Liu, Yihui; Zeng, Fang; Shi, Chen; Cheng, Fang; Han, Yong; Zhang, Yu",Int J Clin Pract,420,12

The effect of this disruption on injury rates, specifically injury to the ulnar collateral ligament (UCL), has not been quantified. PURPOSE/HYPOTHESIS: The purpose of this study was to compare the rate of UCL reconstruction (UCLR), surgery timing, and pitching workload in MLB pitchers from before and after the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown. We hypothesized that UCLR rates relative to games played would be increased and pitching workload would be decreased in 2020 compared with previous seasons. STUDY DESIGN: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3. METHODS: An extensive online search using publicly available data was conducted to identify all MLB pitchers who underwent UCLR between January 1, 2017, and December 31, 2020. Only pitchers who were competing at the MLB level when undergoing reconstruction were included. Player characteristics and surgery date, as well as career and season of surgery pitching workload, were collected for all included pitchers. All data were compared as a pooled sample (2017-2019 vs 2020). RESULTS: A similar number of pitchers underwent UCLR during or after the 2020 regular season (n = 18) compared with the 2017-2019 seasons (n = 16, 20, and 16, respectively). However, after accounting for the decrease in games played during the 2020 regular season, an MLB pitcher was 2.9 times more likely to undergo surgery per game after the COVID-19 lockdown compared with the previous years (P < .001). MLB pitchers who underwent surgery in 2020 threw fewer preseason innings than did pitchers who underwent surgery between 2017 and 2019 (5.98 vs 9.39; P = .001). CONCLUSION: MLB pitchers were almost 3 times more likely to undergo UCLR per game after the COVID-19 lockdown. A decreased preseason pitching workload because of the COVID-19 lockdown may have had an effect on per game UCLR rates.","Paul, Ryan W.; Omari, Ali; Fliegel, Brian; Bishop, Meghan E.; Erickson, Brandon J.; Alberta, Frank G.",Orthop J Sports Med,420,16

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) are states of chronic inflammation and indicate advanced metabolic disease. The purpose of this observational study was to characterize the risk of hospitalization for Covid-19 in patients with NAFLD/NASH and evaluate the mitigating effect of various metabolic treatments. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of electronic medical record data of 26,896 adults from a 12-hospital Midwest healthcare system with a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR from March 1, 2020 to Jan 26, 2021. Variable selection was guided by LASSO and multiple imputation was used to account for missing data. Multivariable logistic regression and competing risk models were used to assess odds of being hospitalized within 45 days of Covid-19 diagnosis. Analysis assessed the risk of hospitalization among patients with a prescription for metformin and statin use within the 3 months prior to the SARS-CoV-2 PCR result, history of home glucagon-like-peptide 1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA) use, and history of metabolic and bariatric surgery (MBS). Interactions were assessed by gender and race. RESULTS: A history of NAFLD/NASH was associated with increased odds of admission for Covid-19, (OR 1.88 95% CI 1.57-2.26, p<0.001)) and mortality (OR 1.96, 95% CI 1.45-2.67, p < 0.001). Each additional year of having NAFLD/NASH was associated with a significant increased risk of being hospitalized for Covid-19 (OR 1.24 95% CI 1.14-1.35, p<0.001). NAFLD/NASH increased risk of hospitalization in men, but not women, and increased risk of hospitalization in all non-white racial/ethnic subgroups. Medication treatments for metabolic syndrome were associated with significantly reduced risk of admission: OR 0.81 (0.67-0.99, p<0.001) for home metformin use and OR 0.71 (0.65-0.83, p<0.001) for home statin use. MBS was associated with a significant decreased risk of admission: OR 0.48 (0.33-0.69, p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: NAFLD/NASH is a significant risk factor for hospitalization for Covid-19, and appears to account for risk attributed to obesity. Other significant risks include factors associated with socioeconomic status and other comorbidities, such as history of venous thromboembolism. Treatments for metabolic disease mitigated risks from NAFLD/NASH. More research is needed to confirm risk associated with visceral adiposity, and patients should be screened for and informed of treatments for metabolic syndrome.","Tignanelli, Christopher J.; Bramante, Carolyn T.; Dutta, Nirjhar; Tamariz, Leonardo; Usher, Michael G.; Ikramuddin, Sayeed",Surg Obes Relat Dis,420,1

Lepidopteran-specific Alphabaculovirus and Betabaculovirus are two large genera in the family of Baculoviridae. In this study, we analyzed the codon usage patterns in 17 baculoviruses, including 10 alphabaculoviruses and 7 betabaculoviruses, which were isolated from seven insect species, and we characterized the codon usage patterns between Alphabaculovirus and Betabaculovirus. Our results show that all the baculoviruses possessed a general weak trend of codon bias. The differences of ENc (effective number of codons) values, nucleotide contents and the impacts of nucleotide content on ENc value within alpha-/betabaculovirus pairs were independent of whether the host species are the same or different. Furthermore, the majority of amino acid sequences adopted codons unequally in all viruses, but the numbers of common preferred codons between alpha- and betabaculoviruses hosted by the same insect species were not significantly different from the differences observed between alpha- and betabaculoviruses hosted by different insect species. In addition, the amino acids that adopt the same synonymous codon composition between alpha- and betabaculoviruses hosted by the same insect species were statistically as few as those between alpha- and betabaculoviruses hosted by different insect species. Correspondence analysis revealed that no major factors resulted in the codon bias in these baculoviruses, implying multiple minor influential factors exist. Neutrality plot analysis indicated that selection pressure dominated mutations in shaping the codon usage. However, the levels of selection pressure were not significantly different among viruses hosted by the same insect species. We expect that evolution would cause the alpha- and betabaculoviruses hosted by the same insect species to share more patterns, but this effect was not observed.","Shi, Sheng-Lin; Jiang, Yi-Ren; Yang, Rui-Sheng; Wang, Yong; Qin, Li",Infect Genet Evol,420,20

Incidence and cure rate of PD-related peritonitis and catheter-related non-infectious complications were compared. All patients were followed up for 30 days from the date of complication. RESULTS PD-related peritonitis, catheter displacement, and catheter occlusion had no significant difference, and the cure rate of PD-related peritonitis, catheter displacement, and catheter occlusion also had no significant difference in two comparisons despite the cure rate of PD-related peritonitis being slightly higher before (90.9%) than during (80%) the transmission control of COVID-19 epidemic. CONCLUSION Distance training mode had a similar effect compared to the traditional training mode in the prevention and treatment of PD-related peritonitis and catheter-related non-infectious complications.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this prospective monocentric study COVID-19 patients had standardized lung ultrasound (12 area evaluation) at day 1, 3 and 5. The primary end point was detection of pathologies and their change over time. The secondary end point was relationship between change in sonographic results and clinical outcome. Clinical outcome was assessed on development of severe disease defined as need for intensive care unit. RESULTS: Data of 30 patients were analyzed, 26 patients with follow-up lung ultrasound. All of them showed lung pathologies with dynamic patterns. 26,7% developed severe disease tending to have an ubiquitous lung involvement in lung ultrasound. In patients with need for intensive care unit a previously developed increase in B-lines, subpleural consolidations and pleural line irregularities was more common. A statistically significant association between change in B-lines as well as change in pleural line irregularities and development of severe disease was observed (p<0,01). CONCLUSION: The present study demonstrates that follow up lung ultrasound can be a powerful tool to track the evolution of disease and suggests that lung ultrasound is able to indicate an impending development of severe disease in COVID-19 patients.","Hoffmann, Tatjana; Bulla, Peter; Jödicke, Lisa; Klein, Constantin; Bott, Sarah M.; Keller, Ronald; Malek, Nisar; Fröhlich, Eckhart; Göpel, Siri; Blumenstock, Gunnar; Fusco, Stefano",PLoS One,420,26

However, the current approaches to ventilator sharing lack the ability to individualize ventilation to each patient, measure pulmonary mechanics, and accommodate rebalancing of the airflow when one patient improves or deteriorates, posing safety concerns to patients. Potential cross-contamination, lack of alarms, insufficient monitoring, and inability to adapt to sudden changes in patient status have prevented widespread acceptance of ventilator sharing. We have developed an individualized system for augmenting ventilator efficacy (iSAVE) as a rapidly deployable platform that uses a single ventilator to simultaneously and more safely support two subjects. The iSAVE enables subject-specific volume and pressure control and the rebalancing of ventilation in response to improvement or deterioration in an individual’s respiratory status. The iSAVE incorporates mechanisms to measure pulmonary mechanics, mitigate cross-contamination and backflow, and accommodate sudden flow changes due to subject interdependencies within the respiratory circuit. We demonstrate these capacities through validation using closed- and open-circuit ventilators on linear test lungs. We show that the iSAVE can temporarily ventilate two pigs on one ventilator as efficaciously as each pig on its own ventilator. By leveraging off-the-shelf medical components, the iSAVE could rapidly expand the ventilation capacity of healthcare facilities during emergency situations such as pandemics.","Srinivasan, Shriya; Ramadi, Khalil B; Vicario, Francesco; Gwynne, Declan; Hayward, Alison; Lagier, David; Langer, Robert; Frassica, Joseph J.; Baron, Rebecca M.; Traverso, Giovanni",Sci Transl Med,420,1

However, Australia lacks fundamental evidence about the prevalence and characteristics of child maltreatment, its associations with mental disorders and physical health, and the associated burden of disease. These evidence gaps impede the development of public health strategies to better prevent and respond to child maltreatment. The aims of this research are to generate the first comprehensive population-based national data on the prevalence of child maltreatment in Australia, identify associations with mental disorders and physical health conditions and other adverse consequences, estimate attributable burden of disease and indicate targeted areas for future optimal public health prevention strategies. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The Australian Child Maltreatment Study (ACMS) is a nationwide, cross-sectional study of Australia’s population aged 16 years and over. A survey of approximately 10 000 Australians will capture retrospective self-reported data on the experience in childhood of all five types of maltreatment (physical abuse, sexual abuse, emotional abuse, neglect and exposure to domestic violence). A customised, multimodule survey instrument has been designed to obtain information including: the prevalence and characteristics of these experiences; diagnostic screening of common mental health disorders; physical health; health risk behaviours and health service utilisation. The survey will be administered in March–November 2021 to a random sample of the nationwide population, recruited through mobile phone numbers. Participants will be surveyed using computer-assisted telephone interviews, conducted by trained interviewers from the Social Research Centre, an agency with extensive experience in studies of health and adversity. Rigorous protocols protect the safety of both participants and interviewers, and comply with all ethical and legal requirements. Analysis will include descriptive statistics reporting the prevalence of individual and multitype child maltreatment, multiple logistic and linear regression analyses to determine associations with mental disorders and physical health problems. We will calculate the population attributable fractions of these putative outcomes to enable an estimation of the disease burden attributable to child maltreatment. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study has been approved by the Queensland University of Technology Human Research Ethics Committee (#1900000477, 16 August 2019). Results will be published to the scientific community in peer-reviewed journals, scientific meetings and through targeted networks. Findings and recommendations will be shared with government policymakers and community and organisational stakeholders through diverse engagement activities, a dedicated Advisory Board and a systematic knowledge translation strategy. Results will be communicated to the public through an organised media strategy and the ACMS website.","Mathews, Ben; Pacella, Rosana; Dunne, Michael; Scott, James; Finkelhor, David; Meinck, Franziska; Higgins, Daryl J; Erskine, Holly; Thomas, Hannah J; Haslam, Divna; Tran, Nam; Le, Ha; Honey, Nikki; Kellard, Karen; Lawrence, David",BMJ Open,420,8

In this study, we investigated the changes in practices and policies related to stroke care through an online survey. METHODS: A 12 question, cross-sectional survey targeting practitioners involved in acute stroke care in the US was distributed electronically through national society surveys, social media and personal communication. RESULTS: Respondants from 39 states completed 206 surveys with the majority (82.5%) from comprehensive stroke centers. Approximately half stated some change in transport practices with 14 (7%) reporting significant reduction in transfers. Common strategies to limit healthcare provider exposure included using personal protective equipment (PPE) for all patients (127; 63.5%) as well as limiting the number of practitioners in the room (129; 64.5%). Most respondents (81%) noted an overall decrease in stroke volume. Many (34%) felt that the outcome or care of acute stroke patients had been impacted by COVID-19. This was associated with a change in hospital transport guidelines (OR 1.325, P=0.047, 95% CI: 1.004-1.748), change in eligibility criteria for IV-tPA or mechanical thrombectomy (MT) (OR 3.146, P=0.052, 95% CI: 0.988- 10.017), and modified admission practices for post IV-tPA or MT patients (OR 2.141, P=0.023, 95% CI: 1.110-4.132). CONCLUSION: Our study highlights a change in practices and polices related to acute stroke management in response to COVID-19 which are variable among institutions. There is also a reported reduction in stroke volume across hospitals. Amongst these changes, updates in hospital transport guidelines and practices related to IV-tPA and MT may affect the perceived care and outcome of acute stroke patients.","Kamdar, Hera A.; Senay, Blake; Mainali, Shraddha; Lee, Vivien; Gulati, Deepak Kumar; Greene-Chandos, Diana; Hinduja, Archana; Strohm, Tamara",J Stroke Cerebrovasc Dis,420,20

Although the virus usually first invades and infects the lung and respiratory track tissue, in extreme cases, almost all major organs in the body are now known to be negatively impacted often leading to severe systemic failure in some people. Unfortunately, there is currently no effective treatment for this disease. Pre-existing pathological conditions or comorbidities such as age are a major reason for premature death and increased morbidity and mortality. The immobilization due to hospitalization and bed rest and the physical inactivity due to sustained quarantine and social distancing can downregulate the ability of organs systems to resist to viral infection and increase the risk of damage to the immune, respiratory, cardiovascular, musculoskeletal systems and the brain. The cellular mechanisms and danger of this “second wave” effect of COVID-19 to the human body, along with the effects of aging, proper nutrition, and regular physical activity, are reviewed in this editorial article.","Woods, Jeffrey; Hutchinson, Noah T.; Powers, Scott K.; Roberts, William O.; Gomez-Cabrera, M.

This COVID-19 associated coagulopathy (CAC) shares features with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), including mild thrombocytopenia and thrombosis. We thus tested 10 CAC patients for anti-PF4/heparin antibodies and functional platelet activation. HIT was excluded in all samples based on anti-PF4/heparin antibody and serotonin release assay results. Of note, 6 CAC patients demonstrated platelet activation by the serotonin release assay that was inhibited by Fc{gamma}RIIA receptor blockade, confirming an IgG-specific immune complex (IC)-mediated reaction. Platelet activation was independent of heparin, but inhibitable by both therapeutic and high dose heparin. All 6 samples were positive for IgG-specific antibodies targeting the receptor binding domain (RBD) or the spike protein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. These samples were additionally characterized by significant endothelial activation, shown by increased von Willebrand factor antigen and activity. ADAMTS13 activity was not severely reduced, and ADAMTS13 inhibitors were not present, ruling out thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura.

Although FCoV is prevalent among cats; the fastidious nature of type I FCoV to grow on cell culture has limited further studies on tissue tropism and pathogenesis of FCoV. While several studies reported serological evidence for FCoV in Malaysia, neither the circulating FCoV isolated nor its biotypes determined. This study for the first time, describes the isolation and biotypes determination of type I and type II FCoV from naturally infected cats in Malaysia. FINDINGS: Of the total number of cats sampled, 95% (40/42) were RT-PCR positive for FCoV. Inoculation of clinical samples into Crandell feline kidney cells (CrFK), and Feline catus whole fetus-4 cells (Fcwf-4), show cytopathic effect (CPE) characterized by syncytial cells formation and later cell detachment. Differentiation of FCoV biotypes using RT-PCR assay revealed that, 97.5% and 2.5% of local isolates were type I and type II FCoV, respectively. These isolates had high sequence homology and phylogenetic similarity with several FCoV isolates from Europe, South East Asia and USA. CONCLUSIONS: This study reported the successful isolation of local type I and type II FCoV evident with formation of cytopathic effects in two types of cell cultures namely the CrFK and Fcwf-4 , where the later cells being more permissive. However, the RT-PCR assay is more sensitive in detecting the antigen in suspected samples as compared to virus isolation in cell culture.

The mechanisms of many events induced by NO are now well defined, so that a fundamental understanding of NO biology is almost established. Accumulated evidence suggests that NO and oxygen radicals such as superoxide are key molecules in the pathogenesis of various infectious diseases. NO biosynthesis, particularly through expression of an inducible NO synthase (iNOS), occurs in a variety of microbial infections. Although antimicrobial activity of NO is appreciated for bacteria and protozoa, NO has opposing effects in virus infections such as influenza virus pneumonia and certain other neurotropic virus infections. iNOS produces an excessive amount of NO for long periods, which allows generation of a highly reactive nitrogen oxide species, peroxynitrite, via a radical coupling reaction of NO with superoxide. Thus, peroxynitrite causes oxidative tissue injury through potent oxidation and nitration reactions of various biomolecules. NO also appears to affect a host's immune response, with immunopathological consequences. For example, overproduction of NO in virus infections in mice is reported to suppress type 1 helper T-cell-dependent immune responses, leading to type 2 helper T-cell-biased immunological host responses. Thus, NO may be a host response modulator rather than a simple antiviral agent. The unique biological properties of NO are further illustrated by our recent data suggesting that viral mutation and evolution may be accelerated by NO-induced oxidative stress. Here, we discuss these multiple roles of NO in pathogenesis of virus infections as related to both non-specific inflammatory responses and immunological host reactions modulated by NO during infections in vivo.","Akaike, T; Maeda, H",Immunology,420,33

In this study, 1566 SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences across ten Asian countries are collected, clustered, and characterized based on the clade they belong to. The isolates are compared to the Wuhan reference sequence (Accession no:MN996528.1) to identify the mutations that occurred at different protein regions. Structural changes in amino acids due to mutations lead to functional instability of the proteins. Detailed clade-wise functional assessments are carried out to quantify the stability and vulnerability of the mutations occurring in SARS-CoV-2 genomes which can shade light on personalized prevention and treatment of the disease and encourage towards the invention of clade-specific vaccines.","Sengupta, Antara; Hassan, Sk.

Nearly 30,000 JE cases with 10,000 deaths are still annually reported in East Asia. Although the JEV genotype III vaccine has been licensed, it elicits a lower protection against other genotypes. Moreover, no effective treatment for a JE case is developed. This study constructed a pBR322-based and cytomegaloviruses (CMV) promoter-driven JEV replicon for the production of JEV single-round infectious particles (SRIPs) in a packaging cell line expressing viral structural proteins. Genetic instability of JEV genome cDNA in the pBR322 plasmid was associated with the prokaryotic promoter at 5′ end of the JEV genome that triggers the expression of the structural proteins in E. coli. JEV structural proteins were toxic E. coli, thus the encoding region for structural proteins was replaced by a reporter gene (enhanced green fluorescent protein, EGFP) that was in-frame fused with the first eight amino acids of the C protein at N-terminus and the foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) 2A peptide at C-terminus in a pBR322-based JEV-EGFP replicon. JEV-EGFP SRIPs generated from JEV-EGFP replicon-transfected packaging cells displayed the infectivity with cytopathic effect induction, self-replication of viral genomes, and the expression of EGFP and viral proteins. Moreover, the combination of JEV-EGFP SRIP plus flow cytometry was used to determine the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values of antiviral agents according to fluorescent intensity and positivity of SRIP-infected packaging cells post treatment. MJ-47, a quinazolinone derivative, significantly inhibited JEV-induced cytopathic effect, reducing the replication and expression of JEV-EGFP replicon in vitro. The IC50 value of 6.28 µM for MJ-47 against JEV was determined by the assay of JEV-EGFP SRIP infection in packaging cells plus flow cytometry that was more sensitive, effective, and efficient compared to the traditional plaque assay. Therefore, the system of JEV-EGFP SRIPs plus flow cytometry was a rapid and reliable platform for screening antiviral agents and evaluating antiviral potency.","Lu, Chien-Yi; Hour, Mann-Jen; Wang, Ching-Ying; Huang, Su-Hua; Mu, Wen-Xiang; Chang, Yu-Chun; Lin, Cheng-Wen",Viruses,420,1

RESULTS: Total 31studies with 4086 SARS-CoV-2 infectedcancer patientsmet the inclusion criteria. Most prevalent co-morbidities in cancer patients with SARS CoV-2 infection were hypertension [42.3% (95%CI:37.5- 47.0)], diabetes [17.8% (95% CI: 15.3-20.4)] and cardiovascular diseases [16.7% (95%CI:12.9-20.4)].The risk of mortality (pOR) was significantly higher in individuals with hypertension[1.6(95%CI 1.24-2.00)], cardiovascular diseases [2.2 (95%CI 1.49- 3.27)], chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases [1.4(95% CI 1.05-2.00)] and diabetes [1.35(95%CI 1.06-1.73)].

We evaluated the role of weather (considering equivalent temperature that combines the effect of humidity and air temperature) with particular consideration of urban density, mobility, homestay, demographic information, and mask use within communities. Our findings highlighted the importance of considering spatial and temporal scales for interpreting the weather/climate impact on the COVID-19 spread and spatiotemporal lags between the causal processes and effects. On global to regional scales, we found contradictory relationships between weather and the transmission rate, confounded by decentralized policies, weather variability, and the onset of screening for COVID-19, highlighting an unlikely impact of weather alone. At a finer spatial scale, the mobility index (with the relative importance of 34.32%) was found to be the highest contributing factor to the COVID-19 pandemic growth, followed by homestay (26.14%), population (23.86%), and urban density (13.03%). The weather by itself was identified as a noninfluential factor (relative importance < 3%). The findings highlight that the relation between COVID-19 and meteorology needs to consider scale, urban density and mobility areas to improve predictions.","Jamshidi, Sajad; Baniasad, Maryam; Niyogi, Dev",Int J Environ Res Public Health,420,22

Among many sectors, the food and the agriculture sector was the worst hit following the immediate lockdown and market shutdowns. Though some stability was prevalent from supply side till date, however, the severe restrictions put in place to curb the spread of pandemic have endangered the supply of agricultural and food articles contemporaneously across borders and from field to fork. While the income decline due to price falland supplies chain disruptions due to pandemic have escalated the food shortages in several of developing and developed countries. Nevertheless the global demand for food items has remained more or less unchanged owing to their inelastic demand. Even within the global level, the scenario of food security and supply chain stability has been substantially deplorable for emerging and less developing countries due to their lack of insulation to the global shocks or pandemics. Notably, the technological backwardness, excessive know-how dependence and denied accessibility on several grounds lead to poverty and food hunger in these countries. At the policy level, a holistic approach specifically targeted towards the developing and less developed economies is highly warranted to ensure an appreciable progress towards the minimisation of sensitivity with regard to agriculture and food security. Apart from the measures to insulate them from global shocks, additional steps need to be taken to alleviate their technological backwardness and denied accessibility on certain socio-cultural norms.","Hamid, Saima; Mir, Mohammad Yaseen",Front Sociol,420,20

PITUITARY ADENOMA SURGERIES IN COVID-19 ERA: EARLY LOCAL EXPERIENCE FROM EGYPT,16.892431,6.2982244,2021-06-01,"Infectious bursal disease (IBD) is an acute, highly contagious and immunosuppressive avian disease caused by infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV). In recent years, remarkable progress has been made in the understanding of the pathogenesis of IBDV infection and the host response, including apoptosis, autophagy and the inhibition of innate immunity. Not only a number of host proteins interacting with or targeted by viral proteins participate in these processes, but microRNAs (miRNAs) are also involved in the host response to IBDV infection. If an IBDV–host interaction at the protein level is taken imaginatively as the front line of the battle between invaders (pathogens) and defenders (host cells), their fight at the RNA level resembles the hidden front line. miRNAs are a class of non-coding single-stranded endogenous RNA molecules with a length of approximately 22 nucleotides (nt) that play important roles in regulating gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. Insights into the roles of viral proteins and miRNAs in host response will add to the understanding of the pathogenesis of IBDV infection. The interaction of viral proteins with cellular targets during IBDV infection were previously well-reviewed. This review focuses mainly on the current knowledge of the host response to IBDV infection at the RNA level, in particular, of the nine well-characterized miRNAs that affect cell apoptosis, the innate immune response and viral replication.","Li, Jiaxin; Zheng, Shijun J.",Viruses,420,11

While a wide range of nonlinear models has been developed and tested on high-end applications considering various degrees of freedom (DOF), linear models suitable for low-cost applications have not been explored thoroughly. In this study, we propose and compare two linear models, a linearized version of a 6-DOF model specifically developed for micro-lightweight systems, and an alternative model based on a double integrator. Both linear models are implemented with a sensor fusion algorithm using a Kalman filter to estimate the position and attitude of PADSs, and their performance is compared to a nonlinear 6-DOF model. Simulation results demonstrate that both models, when incorporated into a Kalman filter estimation scheme, can determine the flight dynamics of PADSs during smooth flights. While it is validated that the double integrator model can adequately operate under the proposed estimation scheme for up to small acceleration changes, the linearized model proves to be capable of reproducing the nonlinear model characteristics even during moderately steep turns.","Garcia-Huerta, Raul A.; González-Jiménez, Luis E.; Villalon-Turrubiates, Ivan E.",Sensors (Basel),420,32

METHODS: This study involves 462 laboratory-confirmed patients with COVID-19 who were admitted to Shenzhen Third People’s Hospital from January 11, 2020 to April 26, 2020. A total of 457 patients underwent thin-section chest CT scans during the hospitalization or after discharge to identify the pulmonary lesion. A total of 287 patients were followed up from 90 to 150 days after the onset of the disease, and lung function tests were conducted about three months after the onset. The risk factors affecting the persistence of pulmonary fibrosis were identified through regression analysis and the prediction model of the persistence of pulmonary fibrosis was established. RESULTS: Parenchymal bands, irregular interfaces, reticulation and traction bronchiectasis were the most common CT features in all COVID-19 patients. During the 0–30, 31–60, 61–90, 91–120 and > 120 days after onset, 86.87%, 74.40%, 79.56%, 68.12% and 62.03% patients developed with pulmonary fibrosis and 4.53%, 19.61%, 18.02%, 38.30% and 48.98% patients reversed pulmonary fibrosis, respectively. It was observed that Age, BMI, Fever, and Highest PCT were predictive factors for sustaining fibrosis even after 90 days from onset. A predictive model of the persistence with pulmonary fibrosis was developed based-on the Logistic Regression method with an accuracy, PPV, NPV, Sensitivity and Specificity of the model of 76%, 71%, 79%, 67%, and 82%, respectively. More than half of the COVID-19 patients revealed abnormal conditions in lung function after 90 days from onset, and the ratio of abnormal lung function did not differ on a statistically significant level between the fibrotic and non-fibrotic groups. CONCLUSIONS: Persistent pulmonary fibrosis was more likely to develop in patients with older age, higher BMI, severe/critical condition, fever, a longer viral clearance time, pre-existing disease and delayed hospitalization. Fibrosis developed in COVID-19 patients could be reversed in about a third of the patients after 120 days from onset. The pulmonary function of less than half of COVID-19 patients could turn to normal condition after three months from onset. An effective prediction model with an average area under the curve (AUC) of 0.84 was established to predict the persistence of pulmonary fibrosis in COVID-19 patients for early diagnosis.","Li, Xiaohe; Shen, Chenguang; Wang, Lifei; Majumder, Sumit; Zhang, Die; Deen, M.

Using the murine MS model, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), we previously demonstrated that antagonism of the chemokine receptor CXCR7 blocks endothelial cell sequestration of CXCL12, thereby enhancing the abluminal localization of CXCR4-expressing leukocytes. CXCR7 antagonism led to decreased parenchymal entry of leukocytes and amelioration of ongoing disease during EAE. Of note, animals that received high doses of CXCR7 antagonist recovered to baseline function, as assessed by standard clinical scoring. Because functional recovery reflects axonal integrity, we utilized diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to evaluate axonal injury in CXCR7 antagonist- versus vehicle-treated mice after recovery from EAE. METHODS: C57BL6/J mice underwent adoptive transfer of MOG-reactive Th1 cells and were treated daily with either CXCR7 antagonist or vehicle for 28 days; and then evaluated by DTI to assess for axonal injury. After imaging, spinal cords underwent histological analysis of myelin and oligodendrocytes via staining with luxol fast blue (LFB), and immunofluorescence for myelin basic protein (MBP) and glutathione S-transferase-π (GST-π). Detection of non-phosphorylated neurofilament H (NH-F) was also performed to detect injured axons. Statistical analysis for EAE scores, DTI parameters and non-phosphorylated NH-F immunofluorescence were done by ANOVA followed by Bonferroni post-hoc test. For all statistical analysis a p < 0.05 was considered significant. RESULTS: In vivo DTI maps of spinal cord ventrolateral white matter (VLWM) axial diffusivities of naïve and CXCR7 antagonist-treated mice were indistinguishable, while vehicle-treated animals exhibited decreased axial diffusivities. Quantitative differences in injured axons, as assessed via detection of non-phosphorylated NH-F, were consistent with axial diffusivity measurements. Overall, qualitative myelin content and presence of oligodendrocytes were similar in all treatment groups, as expected by their radial diffusivity values. Quantitative assessment of persistent inflammatory infiltrates revealed significant decreases within the parenchyma of CXCR7 antagonist-treated mice versus controls. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that CXCR7 antagonism not only prevents persistent inflammation but also preserves axonal integrity. Thus, targeting CXCR7 modifies both disease severity and recovery during EAE, suggesting a role for this molecule in both phases of disease.","Cruz-Orengo, Lillian; Chen, Ying-Jr; Kim, Joong Hee; Dorsey, Denise; Song, Sheng-Kwei; Klein, Robyn S",J Neuroinflammation,420,1

The severe response to SARS-CoV-2 appears to include a “cytokine storm,” which indicates a state of hyperinflammation and subsequent dysfunction of multiple organs and tissues in the most severe cases. This could be the reason why populations at the highest risk for death from the SARS-CoV-2 infection–induced disease (coronavirus disease 2019 [COVID-19]) are those suffering from chronic low-grade inflammation, but prone to hyperinflammation. This includes individuals of advanced age and those with obesity, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and metabolic syndrome. Inflammation resolution is strongly dependent on lipid mediators, the specialized pro-resolution mediators (SPMs). ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (ω-3 PUFAs) are precursors of very potent SPMs, including resolvins, protectins, and maresins. Additionally, they are associated with a less aggressive inflammatory initiation, after competing with ω-6 fatty acids for eicosanoid synthesis. Therefore, it makes sense to consider the use of ω-3 PUFAs for clinical management of COVID-19 patients. ω-3 PUFAs may be given by oral, enteral, or parenteral routes; however, the parenteral route favors faster incorporation into plasma phospholipids, blood cells, and tissues. Here, we discuss these aspects to propose the parenteral infusion of ω-3 PUFAs as adjuvant immunopharmacotherapy for hospitalized patients with COVID-19.","Torrinhas, Raquel S.; Calder, Philip C.; Lemos, Gabriela O.; Waitzberg, Dan L.",Nutrition,420,16

Here we use a SARS-CoV infection-reinfection ferret model and a functional genomics approach to gain insight into SARS immunopathogenesis and to identify correlates of immune protection during SARS-CoV-challenge in ferrets previously infected with SARS-CoV or immunized with a SARS virus vaccine. We identified gene expression signatures in the lungs of ferrets associated with primary immune responses to SARS-CoV infection and in ferrets that received an identical second inoculum. Acute SARS-CoV infection prompted coordinated innate immune responses that were dominated by antiviral IFN response gene (IRG) expression. Reinfected ferrets, however, lacked the integrated expression of IRGs that was prevalent during acute infection. The expression of specific IRGs was also absent upon challenge in ferrets immunized with an inactivated, Al(OH)(3)-adjuvanted whole virus SARS vaccine candidate that protected them against SARS-CoV infection in the lungs. Lack of IFN-mediated immune enhancement in infected ferrets that were previously inoculated with, or vaccinated against, SARS-CoV revealed 9 IRG correlates of protective immunity.

Materials and Methods: We conducted an IRB-approved pilot trial using a telehealth platform for the first post-radiation visit in patients with any cancer diagnosis. The primary endpoint was feasibility of using telehealth defined by completion of five telehealth visits per month in a single department. Secondary endpoints included the ability to assess patients appropriately, patient and physician satisfaction. Physicians were surveyed again during the pandemic to determine whether viewpoints changed. Results: Between May 27, 2016 and August 1, 2018, 37 patients were enrolled in the Telehealth in Post-operative Radiation Therapy (TelePORT) trial, with 24 evaluable patients who completed their scheduled telehealth visit.

ADC dictates the evolution and fate of droplets under given temperature and humidity conditions. The definition of this variable is rooted in the Maxwell theory of droplet evolution via coupled heat and mass transfer between droplets and the surrounding environment. We present the climatology of ADC, and compare its observed distribution in space and time to the observed prevalence of influenza and COVID-19 from extensive global data sets. Globally, large ADC values appear to significantly constrain the observed transmission and spread of VRD, consistent with the significant coherency of the observed seasonal cycles of ADC and influenza. Our results introduce a new environmental determinant, rooted in the mechanism of VRD transmission, with potential implications for explaining seasonality of influenza, and for describing how environmental conditions may impact to some degree the evolution of similar VRDs, such as COVID-19.","Choi, Y.-W.; Tuel, A.; Eltahir, E.

However, these mobility restrictions place a significant economic burden on individuals and businesses. To balance these competing demands, policymakers need analytical tools to assess the costs and benefits of different mobility reduction measures. In this paper, we present our work motivated by our interactions with the Virginia Department of Health on a decision-support tool that utilizes large-scale data and epidemiological modeling to quantify the impact of changes in mobility on infection rates. Our model captures the spread of COVID-19 by using a fine-grained, dynamic mobility network that encodes the hourly movements of people from neighborhoods to individual places, with over 3 billion hourly edges. By perturbing the mobility network, we can simulate a wide variety of reopening plans and forecast their impact in terms of new infections and the loss in visits per sector. To deploy this model in practice, we built a robust computational infrastructure to support running millions of model realizations, and we worked with policymakers to develop an intuitive dashboard interface that communicates our model's predictions for thousands of potential policies, tailored to their jurisdiction. The resulting decision-support environment provides policymakers with much-needed analytical machinery to assess the tradeoffs between future infections and mobility restrictions.","Chang, S.

As a consequence, different drugs active on the immune system have been proposed for the treatment of the disease in adults. ROLE OF THE ANTI-RHEUMATIC AGENTS IN CHILDREN: Children are more likely to develop a mild disease course, as the severe form of COVID-19 is identified in less than 5% of the pediatric patients. Moreover, in children a peculiar disease phenotype, defined as multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) is observed, representing the most severe expression of the inflammatory dysregulation caused by SARS-CoV-2. The limited experience with the severe pediatric COVID-19 and MIS-C does not allow conclusions about the role of the immune pharmacological approach, and therefore the treatment of these conditions represents a considerable clinical challenge. The use of chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, and colchicine in the early disease stages is not sufficiently supported by evidence, and there is an increasing interest in the role of biologic agents, including anti-IL-1 and anti-IL-6 agents, in the prevention and treatment of the severe manifestations of COVID-19. CONCLUSION: The therapeutic approach to pediatric COVID-19 is multidisciplinary, and anti-rheumatic agents have a prominent role in severe disease. This paper reviews the rationale for the use of anti-rheumatic agents in pediatric COVID-19 and MIS-C and the clinical experience with the single drugs. Finally, the areas of potential improvement in the use of anti-rheumatic agents, including the optimization of the drug choice and the timing of administration, are discussed.","Costagliola, Giorgio; Spada, Erika; Consolini, Rita",Pediatr Rheumatol Online J,420,24

This article proposes a first measure of familiarity with and attitude toward clinical research in France. Drawing from the “Health Literacy Survey 2019” (HLS19) conducted online between 27 May and 5 June 2020 on a sample of the French adult population (N = 1003), we show that a significant proportion of the French population claimed some familiarity with clinical trials (64.8%) and had positive attitudes (72%) toward them. One of the important findings of this study is that positive attitudes toward clinical research exist side by side with a strong distancing from the pharmaceutical industry. While respondents acknowledged that the pharmaceutical industry plays an important role in clinical research (68.3%), only one-quarter indicated that they trust the industry (25.7%). Positive attitudes toward clinical trials were associated with familiarity with clinical trials (Odds Ratio, OR 2.97 [1.90–4.63]), financial difficulties (OR 0.63 [0.46–0.85]), as well as mistrust of doctors (0.48 [0.27–0.85]) and of scientists (OR 0.62 [0.38–0.99]). Although the French media provided a great deal of information on how clinical research works during the first months of the pandemic, there remains profound mistrust of the pharmaceutical industry in France. This suspicion can undermine crisis management, especially in the areas of vaccine development and preparation for future pandemics.","Schultz, Émilien; Ward, Jeremy K.; Atlani-Duault, Laëtitia; Holmes, Seth M.; Mancini, Julien",Int J Environ Res Public Health,420,17

OBJECTIVE: To study the clinical presentation of Covid‐19 in Europe. METHODS: Patients with positive diagnosis of Covid‐19 were recruited from 18 European hospitals. Epidemiological and clinical data were obtained through a standardized questionnaire. Bayesian analysis was used for analyzing the relationship between outcomes. RESULTS: 1,420 patients completed the study (962 females, 30.7% of health care workers). The mean age of patients was 39.17±12.09 years. The most common symptoms were headache (70.3%), loss of smell (70.2%), nasal obstruction (67.8%), cough (63.2%), asthenia (63.3%), myalgia (62.5%), rhinorrhea (60.1%), gustatory dysfunction (54.2%) and sore throat (52.9%). Fever was reported by on 45.4%. The mean duration of Covid‐19 symptoms of mild‐to‐moderate cured patients was 11.5±5.7 days. The prevalence of symptoms significantly varied according to age and sex. Young patients more frequently had ear, nose, and throat complaints, whereas elderly individuals often presented fever, fatigue and loss of appetite. Loss of smell, headache, nasal obstruction and fatigue were more prevalent in female patients. The loss of smell was a key symptom of mild‐to‐moderate Covid19 patients and was not associated with nasal obstruction and rhinorrhea. Loss of smell persisted at least 7 days after the disease in 37.5% of cured patients. CONCLUSION: The clinical presentation of mild‐to‐moderate Covid‐19 substantially varies according to the age and the sex characteristics of patients. Olfactory dysfunction seems to be an important underestimated symptom of mild‐to‐moderate Covid‐19 that needs to be recognized as such by the WHO.","Lechien, Jerome R.; Chiesa‐Estomba, Carlos M.; Place, Sammy; Van Laethem, Yves; Cabaraux, Pierre; Mat, Quentin; Huet, Kathy; Plzak, Jan; Horoi, Mihaela; Hans, Stéphane; Barillari, Maria Rosaria; Cammaroto, Giovanni; Fakhry, Nicolas; Martiny, Delphine; Ayad, Tareck; Jouffe, Lionel; Hopkins, Claire; Saussez, Sven",J Intern Med,420,28

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort study of patients diagnosed or under investigation for COVID-19. A machine learning algorithm was trained to predict future presence of intubation based on prior vitals, laboratory, and demographic data. Model performance was compared to ROX index, a validated prognostic tool for prediction of mechanical ventilation. RESULTS: 4087 patients admitted to five hospitals between February 2020 and April 2020 were included. 11.03% of patients were intubated. The machine learning model outperformed the ROX-index, demonstrating an area under the receiver characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.84 and 0.64, and area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC) of 0.30 and 0.13, respectively. In the Kaplan-Meier analysis, patients alerted by the model were more likely to require intubation during their admission (p < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: In patients diagnosed or under investigation for COVID-19, machine learning can be used to predict future risk of intubation based on clinical data which are routinely collected and available in clinical setting. Such an approach may facilitate identification of high-risk patients to assist in clinical care.","Arvind, Varun; Kim, Jun S.; Cho, Brian H.; Geng, Eric; Cho, Samuel K.",J Crit Care,420,5

T. gondii infection of the feline small intestine is critical for the completion of the life cycle and transmission of T. gondii. Protein acetylation is an important posttranslational modification, which plays roles in the regulation of various cellular processes. Therefore, understanding of how T. gondii reprograms the protein acetylation status of feline definitive host can help to thwart the production and spread of T. gondii. Here, we used affinity enrichment and high-resolution liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry to profile the alterations of the acetylome in cat small intestine 10 days after infection by T. gondii Prugniuad (Pru) strain. Our analysis showed that T. gondii induced significant changes in the acetylation of proteins in the cat intestine. We identified 2606 unique lysine acetylation sites in 1357 acetylated proteins. The levels of 334 acetylated peptides were downregulated, while the levels of 82 acetylated peptides were increased in the infected small intestine. The proteins with differentially acetylated peptides were particularly enriched in the bioenergetics-related processes, such as tricarboxylic acid cycle, oxidative phosphorylation, and oxidation-reduction. These results provide the first baseline of the global acetylome of feline small intestine following T. gondii infection and should facilitate further analysis of the role of acetylated protein in the pathogenesis of T. gondii infection in its definitive host.

Information about provider experiences treating these patients in hospital settings on the Texas-Mexico border is lacking. METHODS: The study team conducted semi-structured interviews with physicians, advanced practice clinicians, and nurses who had experience with patients presenting with early pregnancy complications in emergency and/or labor and delivery departments in five hospitals near the Texas-Mexico border. Interview questions focused on respondents’ roles at the hospital, knowledge of abortion services and laws, perspectives on SMA trends, experiences treating patients presenting after SMA, and potential gaps in training related to abortion. Researchers conducted interviews in person between October 2017 and January 2018, and analyzed transcripts using a thematic analysis approach. RESULTS: Most of the 54 participants interviewed said that the care provided to SMA patients was, and should be, the same as for patients presenting after miscarriage. The majority had treated a patient they suspected or confirmed had attempted SMA; typically, these cases required only expectant management and confirmation of pregnancy termination, or treatment for incomplete abortion. In rare cases, further clinical intervention was required. Many providers lacked clinical and legal knowledge about abortion, including local resources available. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment provided to SMA patients is similar to that provided to patients presenting after early pregnancy loss. Lack of provider knowledge about abortion and SMA, despite their involvement with SMA patients, highlights a need for improved training.","Raifman, Sarah; Baum, Sarah E.; White, Kari; Hopkins, Kristine; Ogburn, Tony; Grossman, Daniel",BMC Womens Health,420,21

The hourly AQI series in Shanghai from November 27, 2019 to March 23, 2020 is used for this study. Firstly, using the MF-DFA method, the multifractal characteristics of the AQI series are explored. Secondly, the causes of the multifractality of the AQI series are determined. Finally, the correlations between multifractal parameters of AQI time series and human activities are investigated. The multifractal analysis results reveal that the AQI series during COVID-19 partial lockdown also has multifractal characteristics, and the slightly weaker multifractal characteristics and marginally smaller multifractal degree are obtained in comparison with the pre-lockdown phase. However, the contribution of the effective or intrinsic multifractality before and during COVID-19 partial lockdown are very close.

Recent technological advances and external pressures have driven telemedicine to the forefront of medical reality. During an emergency declaration made March 17, 2020, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) stated the need for providers to use telemedicine to provide patients care in hospitals, clinics, nursing homes, and other settings across the states. Additionally, new policies have been implemented to better facilitate patient care, safety, and privacy. The convenience provided by this low resource modality facilitates the intercommunication between physicians and offers a suitable alternative for patients who are medically or socially unable to see providers in person. However, given the nature of the practice, much consideration is needed to build patient relationships and comfort. In the future, the impact of telemedicine on healthcare environments cannot be overstated, especially in hospice and nursing home settings where it stands to improve treatment efficacy and monitoring for the elderly. Newer inventions such as the remote patient monitoring system can act as safety nets for clinic patients, while improving accessibility of electronic health records (EHRs) will dramatically augment available treatment options. However, the spread of telehealth relies on community reimbursement and the ability for physicians to consistently offer the same services that are available in person. Additionally, it is imperative that physicians and other healthcare professionals integrate these new technologies into their fields while also maintaining the ethics of patient security and autonomy.","Jin, Michael X; Kim, Sun Young; Miller, Lauren J; Behari, Gauri; Correa, Ricardo",Cureus,420,21

We evaluated strategies to reduce SARS-CoV-2 burden in African countries, so as to support decisions that balance minimising mortality, protecting health services and safeguarding livelihoods. METHODS: We used a Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered mathematical model, stratified by age, to predict the evolution of COVID-19 epidemics in three countries representing a range of age distributions in Africa (from oldest to youngest average age: Mauritius, Nigeria and Niger), under various effectiveness assumptions for combinations of different non-pharmaceutical interventions: self-isolation of symptomatic people, physical distancing and ‘shielding’ (physical isolation) of the high-risk population. We adapted model parameters to better represent uncertainty about what might be expected in African populations, in particular by shifting the distribution of severity risk towards younger ages and increasing the case-fatality ratio. We also present sensitivity analyses for key model parameters subject to uncertainty. RESULTS: We predicted median symptomatic attack rates over the first 12 months of 23% (Niger) to 42% (Mauritius), peaking at 2–4 months, if epidemics were unmitigated. Self-isolation while symptomatic had a maximum impact of about 30% on reducing severe cases, while the impact of physical distancing varied widely depending on percent contact reduction and R(0). The effect of shielding high-risk people, e.g. by rehousing them in physical isolation, was sensitive mainly to residual contact with low-risk people, and to a lesser extent to contact among shielded individuals. Mitigation strategies incorporating self-isolation of symptomatic individuals, moderate physical distancing and high uptake of shielding reduced predicted peak bed demand and mortality by around 50%. Lockdowns delayed epidemics by about 3 months. Estimates were sensitive to differences in age-specific social mixing patterns, as published in the literature, and assumptions on transmissibility, infectiousness of asymptomatic cases and risk of severe disease or death by age. CONCLUSIONS: In African settings, as elsewhere, current evidence suggests large COVID-19 epidemics are expected. However, African countries have fewer means to suppress transmission and manage cases. We found that self-isolation of symptomatic persons and general physical distancing are unlikely to avert very large epidemics, unless distancing takes the form of stringent lockdown measures. However, both interventions help to mitigate the epidemic. Shielding of high-risk individuals can reduce health service demand and, even more markedly, mortality if it features high uptake and low contact of shielded and unshielded people, with no increase in contact among shielded people. Strategies combining self-isolation, moderate physical distancing and shielding could achieve substantial reductions in mortality in African countries. Temporary lockdowns, where socioeconomically acceptable, can help gain crucial time for planning and expanding health service capacity.","van Zandvoort, Kevin; Jarvis, Christopher I.; Pearson, Carl A.

We recently carried out a meta-analysis and found that pre- and in-hospital use of statins may improve COVID-19 mortality outcomes. Here, we provide an updated meta-analysis in an attempt to validate these results and increase the statistical power of these potentially important findings. METHODS: The meta-analysis investigated the effect of observational and randomized clinical studies on intensive care unit (ICU) admission, tracheal intubation, and death outcomes in COVID-19 cases involving statin treatment, by searching the scientific literature up to April 23, 2021. Statistical analysis and random effect modeling were performed to assess the combined effects of the updated and previous findings on the outcome measures. Findings. The updated literature search led to the identification of 23 additional studies on statin use in COVID-19 patients. Analysis of the combined studies (n = 47; 3,238,508 subjects) showed no significant effect of statin treatment on ICU admission and all-cause mortality but a significant reduction in tracheal intubation (OR = 0.73, 95% CI: 0.54-0.99, p = 0.04, n = 10 studies). The further analysis showed that death outcomes were significantly reduced in the patients who received statins during hospitalization (OR = 0.54, 95% CI: 0.50-0.58, p < 0.001, n = 7 studies), with no such effect of statin therapy before hospital admission (OR = 1.06, 95% CI = 0.82-1.37, p = 0.670, n = 29 studies). CONCLUSION: Taken together, this updated meta-analysis extends and confirms the findings of our previous study, suggesting that in-hospital statin use leads to significant reduction of all-cause mortality in COVID-19 cases. Considering these results, statin therapy during hospitalization, while indicated, should be recommended.","Vahedian-Azimi, Amir; Mohammadi, Seyede Momeneh; Banach, Maciej; Beni, Farshad Heidari; Guest, Paul C.; Al-Rasadi, Khalid; Jamialahmadi, Tannaz; Sahebkar, Amirhossein",Biomed Res Int,420,11

Hence, it has become important to improve public understanding of science with a focus on explaining the nature of uncertainty in science and its impacts. The goal of the present study was to explore pre-service teachers’ analysis of claims related to the COVID-19 pandemic throughout an 8-week online implementation of a pre-service teachers’ analysis task, focus group interviews, and instructor’s feedback to this analysis in a course focusing on critical and analytical thinking. In order to achieve this purpose, the researchers used the claims that contain fallacies, conspiracy theories, and scientific arguments related to the COVID-19 pandemic as an assessment tool. The researchers developed and used a rubric consisting of the high, moderate, and low levels of analysis in three different categories including evaluation of claims, demarcation of fallacies and conspiracy theories from scientific arguments, and judgment of the credibility of sources. The findings indicate that the participants analyzed the claims rarely at a high level before the focus group interviews. However, after the focus group interviews, almost every participant’s analysis scores of evaluation, demarcation, and judgment increased. The results also revealed their commitment to various fallacies and conspiracy theories while arguing the claims. Concluding remarks are made for the further implications of teaching critical evaluation of claims based on evidence.","Saribas, Deniz; Çetinkaya, Ertan",Sci Educ (Dordr),420,29

Antibodies against hemagglutinin have been shown to prevent infection and hence hemagglutinin is the major constituent of current vaccines. Antibodies directed against the highly conserved extracellular domain of M2 have also been shown to mediate protection against Influenza A infection in various animal models. Active vaccination is generally considered the best approach to combat viral diseases. However, passive immunization is an attractive alternative, particularly in acutely exposed or immune compromized individuals, young children and the elderly. We recently described a novel method for the rapid isolation of natural human antibodies by mammalian cell display. Here we used this approach to isolate human monoclonal antibodies directed against the highly conserved extracellular domain of the Influenza A M2 protein. The identified antibodies bound M2 peptide with high affinities, recognized native cell-surface expressed M2 and protected mice from a lethal influenza virus challenge. Moreover, therapeutic treatment up to 2 days after infection was effective, suggesting that M2-specific monoclonals have a great potential as immunotherapeutic agents against Influenza infection.","Beerli, Roger R; Bauer, Monika; Schmitz, Nicole; Buser, Regula B; Gwerder, Myriam; Muntwiler, Simone; Renner, Wolfgang A; Saudan, Philippe; Bachmann, Martin F",Virol J,420,27

The purpose of this review is to explore the risk factors associated with suicides in the elderly, provide an overview of the epidemiology of firearm-related suicides in older Americans, and explore methods of preventing firearm suicides in the elderly. The vast majority (70 %) of elderly suicides in the U.S were committed using a firearm. Elderly firearm suicides have increased by 49 % between 2010 and 2018, disproportionately affecting white males. Yearly firearm suicides in the elderly ranged from 4,276 in 2010 to 6,375 in 2018. In 2018, the rate of elderly male firearm suicides was 24.96/100,000 compared to a rate of 1.92/100,000 for elderly females, a rate ratio of 13 to 1 for males compared to females. The primary risk factors for elderly firearm suicides seem to be physical illnesses, mental illnesses, and social factors. Older Americans engage in suicidal behaviors with greater planning and lethality of intent than do young adults. Of all the strategies to prevent suicides with firearms, the most efficacious measures based on current research seem to be state firearm legislation and improving mental healthcare, but these effects are not specific to the elderly. Strengthening state firearm laws and improving mental healthcare for the elderly may have promise in preventing elderly firearm-related suicides. Additional implications for practice and research are discussed in this review.","Price, James H.; Khubchandani, Jagdish",J Community Health,420,0

At the current stage of COVID-19 pandemic, forecasts become particularly important regarding the possibility that the total incidence could reach the level where the disease stops spreading because a considerable portion of the population has become immune and collective immunity could be reached. Such forecasts are valuable because the currently undertaken restrictive measures prevent mass morbidity but do not result in the development of a robust collective immunity. Thus, in the absence of efficient vaccines and medical treatments, lifting restrictive measures carries the risk that a second wave of the epidemic could occur. Methods. We developed a heterogeneous model of COVID-19 dynamics. The model accounted for the differences in the infection risk across subpopulations, particularly the age-depended susceptibility to the disease. Based on this model, an equation for the minimal number of infections was calculated as a condition for the epidemic to start declining. The basic reproductive number of 2.5 was used for the disease spread without restrictions. The model was applied to COVID-19 data from Italy. Findings. We found that the heterogeneous model of epidemic dynamics yielded a lower proportion, compared to a homogeneous model, for the minimal incidence needed for the epidemic to stop. When applied to the data for Italy, the model yielded a more optimistic assessment of the minimum total incidence needed to reach collective immunity: 43% versus 60% estimated with a homogeneous model. Interpretation. Because of the high heterogeneity of COVID-19 infection risk across the different age groups, with a higher susceptibility for the elderly, homogeneous models overestimate the level of collective immunity needed for the disease to stop spreading. This inaccuracy can be corrected by the homogeneous model introduced here. To improve the estimate even further additional factors should be considered that contribute to heterogeneity, including social and professional activity, gender and individual resistance to the pathogen.","Gerasimov, A.; Lebedev, G.; Lebedev, M.; Semenycheva, I.",,420,24

Several vital signals, such as voice signals, can be acquired anytime and anywhere, achieved with the least possible discomfort to the patient thanks to the development of increasingly advanced devices. The integration of sensors with artificial intelligence techniques contributes to the realization of faster and easier solutions aimed at improving early diagnosis, personalized treatment, remote patient monitoring and better decision making, all tasks vital in a critical situation such as that of the COVID-19 pandemic. This paper presents a study about the possibility to support the early and non-invasive detection of COVID-19 through the analysis of voice signals by means of the main machine learning algorithms. If demonstrated, this detection capacity could be embedded in a powerful mobile screening application. To perform this important study, the Coswara dataset is considered. The aim of this investigation is not only to evaluate which machine learning technique best distinguishes a healthy voice from a pathological one, but also to identify which vowel sound is most seriously affected by COVID-19 and is, therefore, most reliable in detecting the pathology. The results show that Random Forest is the technique that classifies most accurately healthy and pathological voices. Moreover, the evaluation of the vowel /e/ allows the detection of the effects of COVID-19 on voice quality with a better accuracy than the other vowels.","Verde, Laura; De Pietro, Giuseppe; Sannino, Giovanna",Arab J Sci Eng,420,9

The study aimed to describe antibiotics susceptibility of E. coli from clinical specimens from October 11, 2019 to September 11, 2020. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Study was conducted retrospectively in a private microbiology laboratory in Mataram Indonesia. Period of study divided as two groups after WHO declared COVID-19 as pandemic by March 11, 2020; group A including the specimen related to September 2019 to March 11(th) 2020 and group B including the specimens related to March 11(th) 2020 to September 2020. All clinical specimens were subjected to identify E. coli isolates and their antibiotics susceptibility using WHO-NET 5.6 version. RESULTS: Totally, 148 E. coli isolates were found in group A and 62 isolates in group B. Prevalence of extended-spectrum beta lactamase (ESBL)- producing E. coli in group A was 50% and in group B was 20.9% with significantly difference (p<0.05). There was an increase in susceptibility to 10/16 antibiotics; where 3 antibiotics ofloxacin, aztreonam, and fosfomycin were significant (p<0.05). There was a significant decrease in susceptibility to the antibiotics piperacillin (p=0.012), amoxicillin (p=0.002), cefadroxil (p=0.036) and ampicillin (p=0.036). Type of infections between two groups: musculoskeletal infections, pneumonia, urinary tract infections and sepsis were not significant. CONCLUSION: Reduced number of E. coli isolates between two groups with decrease of ESBL-producing E. coli contribute in dynamics of antibiotics susceptibility.

The pathophysiology of myocarditis after this vaccination is indeterminate currently. The problem is a relatively new phenomenon, and so there are no current guidelines on how to manage these cases of myopericarditis. We intend to describe our management in these two cases so that it can help guide pediatricians, intensivists, and cardiologists taking care of similar cases. Case Summaries. The first case is a young adolescent who presented with chest pain after receiving his second dose of coronavirus disease 19 vaccination with no other symptoms. His troponin was found to be 40 ng/mL. He had a normal echocardiogram and chest CT angiogram. His troponins trended down with symptomatic pain management after 3 days. The second case is another adolescent who presented with fever, fatigue, headache, and chest pain 3 days after receiving his second dose of coronavirus vaccine. His troponin was elevated to 5 ng/mL, electrocardiogram with ST segment elevations, and mildly decreased systolic function on echocardiogram. His troponins and electrocardiogram were normalized in 3 days at the time of his discharge. CONCLUSION: The clinical course of vaccine-associated myocarditis appears favorable as both our patients have responded well to medications and rest with prompt improvement in symptoms with full recovery. The experience remains limited at this time regarding the investigations, management, and follow-up of this novel clinical entity. It is vital for all the health care providers taking care of adolescents to have knowledge about this phenomenon and make correct diagnosis in those presenting with chest pain after COVID-19 vaccine and in preventing unnecessary invasive procedures such as coronary angiogram to rule out acute coronary syndromes.","Ambati, Shashikanth; Colon, Michael; Mihic, Maya; Sanchez, Javier; Bakar, Adnan",Case Rep Cardiol,420,1

Pour cela, le même groupe d’experts, a été sollicité avec réalisation d’une revue de la littérature et prise en compte des avis de la Direction Générale de la Santé, la Haute Autorité de Santé, du Haut Conseil de Santé Publique. Résultats: Les données pendant la grossesse sont plus nombreuses et plus précises. Les données publiées semblent montrer que les symptômes chez la femmes enceintes sont les mêmes que ceux de la population générale et qu’un sur risque existe chez la femme enceinte particulièrement au troisième trimestre. Un cas de transmission materno-fœtale intra utérine a été formellement identifié. Une prématurité induite et des cas de détresses respiratoires chez les nouveau-nés de mères infectées ont été décrits.

On September 2020, over 28 million people have been infected with over 920,000 deaths. Methods: In view of the evolution of the epidemic the French National College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists has decided to update the recommendations previously issued. To do this, the same group of experts was called upon to carry out a review of the literature and take into account the opinions of the General Directorate of Health (DGS), the “Haute Autorité de Santé” (HAS) and the “Haut Conseil de santé Publique” (HCSP). Results: The data on consequences during pregnancy have accumulated. The symptoms in pregnant women appear to be similar to those of the general population, but an increased risk of respiratory distress exists in pregnant women especially in the third trimester. A case of intrauterine maternal-fetal transmission has been clearly identified. Induced prematurity and cases of respiratory distress in newborns of infected mothers have been described. Conclusion: In light of the new data, we propose updated recommendations. These proposals may continue to evolve in view of the pandemic and of advances in studies in pregnant women.","Peyronnet, Violaine; Sibiude, Jeanne; Huissoud, Cyril; Lescure, François-Xavier; Lucet, Jean-Christophe; Mandelbrot, Laurent; Nisand, Israel; Belaish-Allart, Joëlle; Vayssière, Christophe; Yazpandanah, Yazdan; Luton, Dominique; Picone, Olivier",Gynecol Obstet Fertil Senol,420,5

Infection with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was confirmed using a real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction test. RESULTS: The onset of PTE varied from 2 to 4 weeks after the occurrence of the initial symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection and led to deterioration of the clinical picture in all cases. PTE was the primary reason for hospital admission after a 2-week period of self-isolation at home (1 patient) and hospital readmission after initial uncomplicated hospital discharge (2 patients). Three of the patients had no past history of clinically relevant risk factors for venous thromboembolism (VTE). Severe disease progression was associated with concomitant increases in IL-6, ferritin, and D-Dimer levels. The outcome from PTE was related to the extent of vascular involvement, and associated complications.

We aimed to estimate in near real time the proportion of adults who have been infected by SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: In this modelling study, we developed a method to reconstruct the proportion of adults who have been infected by SARS-CoV-2 and the proportion of infections being detected, using the joint analysis of age-stratified seroprevalence, hospitalisation, and case data, with deconvolution methods. We developed our method on a dataset consisting of seroprevalence estimates from 9782 participants (aged ≥20 years) in the two worst affected regions of France in May, 2020, and applied our approach to the 13 French metropolitan regions over the period March, 2020, to January, 2021. We validated our method externally using data from a national seroprevalence study done between May and June, 2020. FINDINGS: We estimate that 5·7% (95% CI 5·1–6·4) of adults in metropolitan France had been infected with SARS-CoV-2 by May 11, 2020. This proportion remained stable until August, 2020, and increased to 14·9% (13·2–16·9) by Jan 15, 2021. With 26·5% (23·4–29·8) of adult residents having been infected in Île-de-France (Paris region) compared with 5·1% (4·5–5·8) in Brittany by January, 2021, regional variations remained large (coefficient of variation [CV] 0·50) although less so than in May, 2020 (CV 0·74). The proportion infected was twice as high (20·4%, 15·6–26·3) in 20–49-year-olds than in individuals aged 50 years or older (9·7%, 6·9–14·1). 40·2% (34·3–46·3) of infections in adults were detected in June to August, 2020, compared with 49·3% (42·9–55·9) in November, 2020, to January, 2021. Our regional estimates of seroprevalence were strongly correlated with the external validation dataset (coefficient of correlation 0·89).

However, there is no validated alternative to the CRT allowing injured or sailing personnel to conduct the yearly basic physical fitness test. Therefore, the aim of this study was to validate performance in a 6-min rowing ergometer test (6MRT) against CRT performance. Thirty-one individuals (M/F: 20/11, age: 34 ± 12 years) employed at the Danish Armed Forces completed testing on two independent days; (I) the CRT on an outdoor track and (II) a 6MRT with pulmonary measurements of breath-by-breath oxygen uptake. In addition, 5 participants (M/F: 4/1, age: 40 ± 10 years) completed re-testing of the 6MRT. No difference was observed between VO(2max) estimated from the CRT and measured during the 6MRT. Absolute VO(2max) correlated strongly (r = 0.95; p < 0.001) to performance in the 6MRT, and moderately (r = 0.80; p < 0.001) to performance in the CRT.

In addition to neutralization of wild-type SARS-CoV-2, patient sera were also able to neutralize the recently emerged SARS-CoV-2 mutant D614G, suggesting cross-protection from reinfection by either strain. However, SARS-CoV-2 sera generally lacked cross-neutralization to a highly homologous pre-emergent bat coronavirus, WIV1-CoV, which has not yet crossed the species barrier.

For over 60 years, various extensions and applications to the popular newsvendor model have been suggested, where cost/profit are often the focal objective. We propose a new version of the traditional single-period newsvendor model - the ”Rippled Newsvendor” - with supply chain severity (i.e. risk propagation) as the primary objective while taking into account network structure. Our model considers exogenous and endogenous risk(s) of disruption while exploring the tension between under-supply and ”wear-and-tear” (i.e system breakdown). To model the intricacies of this trade-off whilst minimizing the potential spread of risk, we leverage a Bayesian Network whereby the conditional probability distributions are functions of the inventory ordering decisions. We use a simulation study to understand the nature of our objective function as well as to gain insight into the potential optimal ordering policies of this new model. Furthermore, the simulation seeks to understand how the various factors in our system impact total risk severity, and if they do so in different ways.

Such a vaccine would need to rapidly confer protection after one or two doses and would need to be manufactured using components suitable for scale-up. Here, we developed an alphavirus-derived replicon RNA vaccine candidate, repRNA-CoV2S, encoding the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein. The RNA replicons were formulated with Lipid InOrganic Nanoparticles (LION) that were designed to enhance vaccine stability, delivery, and immunogenicity. We show that a single intramuscular injection of the LION/repRNA-CoV2S vaccine in mice elicited robust production of anti-SARS-CoV-2 S protein IgG antibody isotypes indicative of a Type 1 T helper cell response. A prime/boost regimen induced potent T cell responses in mice including antigen-specific responses in lung and spleen. Prime-only immunization of aged (17-month old) mice induced smaller immune responses compared to young mice, but this difference was abrogated by booster immunization. Importantly, in nonhuman primates, prime-only immunization in one intramuscular injection site or prime/boost immunizations in 5 intramuscular injection sites elicited modest T cell responses and robust antibody responses. The antibody responses persisted for at least 70 days and neutralized SARS-CoV-2 at titers comparable to those in human serum samples collected from individuals convalescing from COVID-19. These data support further development of LION/repRNA-CoV2S as a vaccine candidate for prophylactic protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Erasmus, Jesse H.; Khandhar, Amit P.; O’Connor, Megan A.; Walls, Alexandra C.; Hemann, Emily A.; Murapa, Patience; Archer, Jacob; Leventhal, Shanna; Fuller, James T.; Lewis, Thomas B.; Draves, Kevin E.; Randall, Samantha; Guerriero, Kathryn A.; Duthie, Malcolm S.; Carter, Darrick; Reed, Steven G.; Hawman, David W.; Feldmann, Heinz; Gale, Michael; Veesler, David; Berglund, Peter; Heydenburg Fuller, Deborah",Sci Transl Med,420,1

In response, many governments denied entry to travellers arriving from various countries affected by the virus. While several industries continue to experience economic losses due to the imposed interventions, it is unclear whether the different travel restrictions were successful in reducing COVID-19 importations. METHODS: Here we develop a comprehensive probabilistic framework to model daily COVID-19 importations, considering different travel bans. We quantify the temporal effects of the restrictions and elucidate the relationship between incidence rates in other countries, travel flows and the expected number of importations into the country under investigation. RESULTS: As a cases study, we evaluate the travel bans enforced by the Australian government. We find that international travel bans in Australia lowered COVID-19 importations by 87.68% (83.39 - 91.35) between January and June 2020. The presented framework can further be used to gain insights into how many importations to expect should borders re-open. CONCLUSIONS: While travel bans lowered the number of COVID-19 importations overall, the effectiveness of bans on individual countries varies widely and directly depends on the change in behaviour in returning residents and citizens. Authorities may consider the presented information when planning a phased re-opening of international borders.

We identify and characterize global variations in major rhetorical storylines invoked in publicly available speeches (N = 1201) across a sample of 26 countries. Employing a text analytics or corpus linguistics approach, we show that state heads rhetorically lead their nations by: enforcing systemic interventions, upholding global unity, encouraging communal cooperation, stoking national fervor, and assuring responsive governance. Principal component analysis further shows that country‐level rhetoric is organized along emergent dimensions of cultural cognition: an agency‐structure axis to define the loci of pandemic interventions and a hierarchy‐egalitarianism axis which distinguishes top‐down enforcement from bottom‐up calls for cooperation. Furthermore, we detect a striking contrast between countries featuring populist versus cosmopolitan rhetoric, which diverged in terms of their collective meaning making around leading over versus leading with, as well as their experienced pandemic severity. We conclude with implications for understanding global pandemic leadership in an unequal world and the contributions of mixed‐methods approaches to a generative political psychology in times of crisis. HIGHLIGHTS: During a global pandemic, political leaders must adapt their rhetoric to local societal conditions. Our work affirms the importance of political governance that elevates strong institutions while empowering public cooperation, but cautions that these may be most readily enacted in more democratic and economically developed contexts. In poorer, less democratic settings, rhetoric emphasizing accountable governance should be responsive to bottom‐up grassroots efforts in local communities, in contrast to the tightening grip of top‐down militarized policing in states witnessing the opportunistic creep of authoritarianism during a period of societal disorder. Finally, rhetoric where leaders uphold global ideals underscore wider identities of international collaborations in a global crisis, in contrast to more insularizing nationalistic rhetoric.","Montiel, Cristina Jayme; Uyheng, Joshua; Dela Paz, Erwine",Polit Psychol,420,1

METHODS: This was a retrospective single-center study of heart failure patients inserted with remote monitoring (RM)-capable CIED. We analyzed the transmitted data of physical activity and fluid volume status of all patients, before, and during the lockdown periods between February and April 2020. The clinical status of the patients was also evaluated. RESULTS: Device data from 429 patients implanted with CIED capable of RM were initially evaluated. Patients with an implantable loop recorder, Brugada or Long QT syndromes, and patients with incomplete transmissions were excluded. Eighty-two patients with heart failure were included. The median age was 65 years (58-72), and 53 (64.6%) subjects were men. There was a 27.1% decline in physical activity, and the median physical activity of patients significantly declined from 2.4 to 1.8 hours/day (p=0.000010). CONCLUSION: Data obtained by remotely monitored CIED in heart failure patients suggests a significant decline in physical activity during the country lockdown due to the pandemic.

The prepared photocatalyst exhibited a tetragonal phase with an energy band gap of 2.15 eV. The efficiency of the photocatalyst was elucidated by monitoring the photodegradation of organic dyes and antibiotics. The BiOI photocatalyst provided a 95% removal of norfloxacin (NOR) antibiotics under visible light illumination. Interestingly, the complete removal of Rhodamine B (RhB) dye was achieved after 80 min of natural sunlight irradiation. The photodegradation reaction followed the first-order reaction. Both photo-generated holes and electrons play vital roles in the photodegradation of the pollutant. The BiOI photocatalyst remains stable and still shows a high efficiency even after the fifth run. This confirms the great cycling ability and high structural stability of the photocatalyst. The prepared BiOI catalyst, with a high surface area of 118 m2 g-1, can act as an excellent adsorbent as well. The synergistic effect based on both adsorption and photocatalysis is a key factor in achieving a very high removal efficiency. The photoactivity under sunlight is higher than that observed under visible light, supporting the practical use of the BiOI photocatalyst for the removal of organic pollutants in wastewater through the utilization of abundant solar energy.","Narenuch, Teerapong; Senasu, Teeradech; Chankhanittha, Tammanoon; Nanan, Suwat",Molecules (Basel),420,30

More surprising was the recent discovery that eukaryotic genomes contain sequences from RNA viruses that have no DNA stage in their life cycle. Similarly, several single-stranded DNA viruses have left integrated copies in their host genomes. This review explores some major evolutionary aspects arising from the discovery of these endogenous viral elements (EVEs). In particular, the reasons for the bias toward EVEs derived from negative-sense RNA viruses are considered, as well as what they tell us about the long-term “arms races” between hosts and viruses, characterized by episodes of selection and counter-selection. Most dramatically, the presence of orthologous EVEs in divergent hosts demonstrates that some viral families have ancestries dating back almost 100 million years, and hence are far older than expected from the phylogenetic analysis of their exogenous relatives.","Holmes, Edward C.",Cell Host & Microbe,420,6

The adrenal gland can be infected by a myriad of pathogens including fungi, viruses, parasites, and bacteria. Infection can directly or indirectly cause tissue damage and alteration in endocrine function. Direct damage occurs via microbial replication and local production of toxic compounds, such as endotoxins. Indirect damage results from alterations in the regulation of a host's immunologic and endocrine mediators in response to damage by a microbe at a distant site. Variations in pathogen tropism, adrenal anatomy, and host immune integrity contribute to the progression of active disease and discernable adrenal dysfunction.

This article focuses on trade union financed journals for nurses in Scandinavia studying how the journals articulate AMR to its readership. A systematic literature search over an eleven‐year period was conducted, using web‐based national trade union financed journals, searching for ‘bacteria’ and ‘resistance’. A thematic analysis, inspired by Foucault's concepts of power and governmentality, was made of 131 texts to understand, which kind of practices, strategies and policies the journals frame regarding AMR. The time period studied resulted in the recognition of four separate themes: the horror scenario, the ‘dangerous’ other, healthcare professionals as a source of resistance development and AMR as a field of research and producer of research qualifications. The study concludes that the journals tend: to present AMR in apocalyptic terms with more research and pharmaceutical industries needed for avoidance; to point out problems in other countries, populations, and sometimes nurses’ working conditions, but primarily with other professionals’ behaviour; and lastly, to present the nurse as a good fairy and disciplinator of doctors.","Glasdam, Stinne; Loodin, Henrik; Wrigstad, Jonas",Nurs Inq,420,20

OBJECTIVE: We examined the temporal association of county-level Social Vulnerability Index (SVI), a percentile-based measure of social vulnerability to disasters, its subcomponents and race/ethnic composition with COVID-19 incidence and mortality in the USA in the year starting in March 2020. METHODS: Counties (n=3091) with ≥50 COVID-19 cases by 6 March 2021 were included in the study. Associations between SVI (and its subcomponents) and county-level racial composition with incidence and death per capita were assessed by fitting a negative-binomial mixed-effects model. This model was also used to examine potential time-varying associations between weekly number of cases/deaths and SVI or racial composition. Data were adjusted for percentage of population aged ≥65 years, state-level testing rate, comorbidities using the average Hierarchical Condition Category score, and environmental factors including average fine particulate matter of diameter ≥2.5 μm, temperature and precipitation. RESULTS: Higher SVI, indicative of greater social vulnerability, was independently associated with higher COVID-19 incidence (adjusted incidence rate ratio per 10 percentile increase: 1.02, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.03, p<0.001) and death per capita (1.04, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.05, p<0.001). SVI became an independent predictor of incidence starting from March 2020, but this association became weak or insignificant by the winter, a period that coincided with a sharp increase in infection rates and mortality, and when counties with higher proportion of white residents were disproportionately represented (‘third wave’). By spring of 2021, SVI was again a predictor of COVID-19 outcomes. Counties with greater proportion of black residents also observed similar temporal trends in COVID-19-related adverse outcomes. Counties with greater proportion of Hispanic residents had worse outcomes throughout the duration of the analysis. CONCLUSION: Except for the winter ‘third wave’, when majority of the white communities had the highest incidence of cases, counties with greater social vulnerability and proportionately higher minority populations experienced worse COVID-19 outcomes.","Islam, Shabatun J; Nayak, Aditi; Hu, Yingtian; Mehta, Anurag; Dieppa, Katherine; Almuwaqqat, Zakaria; Ko, Yi-An; Patel, Shivani A; Goyal, Abhinav; Sullivan, Samaah; Lewis, Tené T; Vaccarino, Viola; Morris, Alanna A; Quyyumi, Arshed A",BMJ Open,420,1

If so, surveillance for genetic markers of adaptation could help to predict the risk of disease emergence. However, adaptation is difficult to distinguish conclusively from the other processes that generate genetic change. In this Review we survey the research on the host jumps of influenza A, severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus, canine parvovirus and Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus to illustrate the insights that can arise from combining genetic surveillance with microbiological experimentation in the context of epidemiological data. We argue that using a multidisciplinary approach for surveillance will provide a better understanding of when adaptations are required for host jumps and thus when predictive genetic markers may be present.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Verification included assessment of within-run and between-run precision, bias, measurement uncertainty (MU), verification of the cut-off, method comparison between all assessed assays, and the reference commercial ELFA VIDAS D-Dimer Exclusion II. RESULTS: Within-run coefficients of variations (CVs) ranged from 1.6% (Atellica COAG 360) to 7.9% (ACL TOP 550), while between-run CVs ranged from 1.7% (Sysmex CS-5100) to 6.9% (Atellica COAG 360). Spearman’s rank correlation coefficients were > 0.99 between LPIAs and ≥ 0.93 when comparing ELFA with LPIA. Passing-Bablok regression analysis yielded constant and proportional difference for comparison of ACL TOP 550 with both Sysmex CS-5100 and Atellica COAG360, and for miniVidas with Atellica COAG360. Small proportional difference was found between miniVidas and both Sysmex CS-5100 and ACL TOP 550. Calculated MUs using D-dimer HS 500 calibrator were 12.6% (Sysmex CS-5100) and 15.6% (Atellica COAG 360), while with INNOVANCE D-dimer calibrator 12.0% (Sysmex CS-5100), 10.0% (Atellica COAG 360) and 28.1% (ACL TOP 550). Excellent agreement of results was obtained, with occasional discrepancies near the cut-off. The cut-off (0.5 mg/L FEU) was confirmed. CONCLUSIONS: The obtained results prove satisfactory analytical performance of LPIAs, their high comparability and almost equal discriminatory characteristics, suggesting them as a valid alternative to ELFA.","Lapić, Ivana; Coen Herak, Désirée; Prpić, Snježana; Prce, Andrea; Raščanec, Vanja; Zadro, Renata; Rogić, Dunja",Biochem Med (Zagreb),420,24

The BNPs were characterized and toxicity bioassay was examined on the larvae of the pathogen vectors such as Anopheles stephensi and Aedes aegypti mosquitoes. The predation efficiency test was evaluated on the invertebrate non-target organisms such as natural predatory nymphs of dragonfly and damselfly. The results of material characterization using UV VIS spectroscopy confirmed the synthesis of Au–Pd BNPs with the appearance of the SPR bands. FT-IR spectroscopy indicates the presence of functional groups containing high amounts of nitro compounds and amines on the surface of BNPs. TEM result shows the presence of spherical polydisperse Au–Pd BNPs in the sample. The XRD pattern displayed the semi-crystalline nature and the changes in the hydrodynamic size and surface potential was determined for the sample at 0 h, 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h of synthesis through DLS and ZP analysis. Au–Pd BNPs Bioassay provided the effective lethal concentrations (LC(50)) against the I–IV instar larvae of An. stephensi and Ae. aegypti after 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h of exposure. The LC(50) obtained from the larvicidal bioassay was used to test its effect on the predation efficiency of the selected nymphs which showed increased predation from 40 to 48 h of exposure as compared to the negative control.

COVID-19 infections are seen across all age groups but they have shown to have a predisposition for the elderly and those with underlying comorbidities. Specifically, these include cardiovascular diseases, diabetes and underlying lung conditions. Further, patients with severe COVID-19 infections and comorbidities are more prone to respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), mechanical ventilator use and ultimately succumb to these complications. Little evidence exists of the prevalence of underlying lung comorbidities among COVID-19 patients and associated mortality. Methods We performed a systematic review of the literature including PubMed (Medline), Embase (Ovid), Google Scholar and Cochrane Library. The last date for our search was 29th April 2020. We included all original research articles on COVID-19 and calculated prevalence of chronic lung disease patients among COVID-19 patients using random effects model. Further we assessed for mortality rates among COVID-19 patients associated with these lung comorbidities. We calculated pooled prevalence of these conditions among COVID-19 patients using random effects model. Results The authors identified 29 articles that reported the prevalence of chronic lung conditions among COVID-19 patients. Among those, 26 were from China and 3 from the United States. The pooled prevalence of lung comorbidities including Asthma, COPD, and lung cancer was 3% (95% CI=0-14%), 2.2% (95% CI=0.02-0.03%) and 2.1% (95% CI=0.00-0.21%) respectively. Mortality rates associated with these comorbidities was 30% (41/137) for COPD and 19% (7/37) for lung cancer respectively. No mortality rates were reported for patients with asthma. Conclusion This study provides preliminary evidence of the prevalence of chronic lung conditions among patients with COVID-19. Future studies are needed to assess other lung comorbidities and associated mortality among patients diagnosed with COVID-19.","Alkhathami, M. G.; Advani, S.; Al Shehri, M.

METHODS: In a longitudinal survey, we asked cigarette smokers in Pakistan about their smoking behaviours before and since COVID-19. Smokers were recruited before COVID-19 using two-stage random probability sampling. Since COVID-19, three subsequent waves were conducted over the telephone, asking additional questions on social determinants, mental health and wellbeing. Based on the first two waves, we estimated the proportion of smokers who stopped, decreased, maintained, or increased smoking. We also explored any factors associated with the change in smoking patterns. In those who stopped smoking soon after COVID-19, we estimated the proportion relapsed in subsequent waves. We estimated all proportions based on complete-case analysis. RESULTS: We recruited 6,014 smokers between September 2019 and February 2020; of these, 2,087 (2,062 reported smoking outcomes) were followed up in May 2020 after COVID-19. Since COVID-19, 14% (290/2,062) smokers reported quitting. Among those who continued smoking: 68% (1210/1772) reduced, 14% (239/1772) maintained, and 18% (323/1772) increased cigarette consumption; 37% (351/938) reported at least one quit attempt; 41% (669/1619) were more motivated while 21% (333/1619) were less motivated to quit. Changes in smoking patterns varied with nicotine dependence, motivation to quit, and financial stability since COVID-19. Among those reporting quitting soon after COVID-19, 39% (81/206) relapsed in the subsequent months (June-July 2020). CONCLUSIONS: There have been significant bidirectional changes in smoking patterns since COVID-19 in Pakistan. While many people stopped, reduced, or tried quitting smoking, some increased smoking, and some relapsed after quitting. IMPLICATIONS: We observed significant and complex changes in people’s smoking patterns, which are likely to be attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic and replicated in similar events in the future. Assessing these changes are essential for most low- and middle-income countries like Pakistan, where the vast majority of tobacco users live, but cessation support is still rudimentary. If provided routinely, smoking cessation interventions can potentially support millions of highly motivated individuals in quitting successfully both in general as well as in global events like COVID-19, in particular.","Siddiqi, Kamran; Siddiqui, Faraz; Khan, Amina; Ansaari, Saeed; Kanaan, Mona; Khokhar, Mariam; Islam, Ziauddin; Mishu, Masuma Pervin; Bauld, Linda",Nicotine Tob Res,420,16

The needs and quality of life of MBC women living in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) are understudied. Facilitating the interaction of various caregivers is beneficial in addressing the needs. Internet-based resources play an important role in reaching out to these patients. We aimed to bring the various stakeholders into a joint network force, create a web-based portal, understand the needs of MBC patients, and assess the utilization of web-based resources for women from Kenya. METHODS: A network of various stakeholders considered crucial in the care of Kenyan women with MBC was created. We conducted educational camps and assessed their needs, quality of life (QoL), and knowledge. We assessed the impact of utilizing web-based resources by MBC patients from here. RESULTS: We formed a network involving partners and launched the first dedicated website for MBC from Kenya. The website has received 13,944 visits and 310,379 hits in 2 years. One hundred fourteen women living with MBC were interviewed, and our findings show that psychological needs (63%), physical support needs (60%), and health care system needs (55%) are leading areas of needs that increase with rural residence (p = 0.001), less education (p = 0.003), and aggressive treatments (p = 0.008). Quality of life (QoL) confirmed better scores with urban residence (p = 0.002), internet access (p = 0.010), and stable disease (p = 0.042). CONCLUSIONS: Creating a network of caregivers provides opportunities for cohesive efforts in understanding the psychosocial and medical needs of patients with MBC. Internet-based resources are an effective way of reaching out to them. Kenyan patients show extremely good uptake of internet-based resources.

Understanding the microbiomes associated with the upper respiratory tract infection (URTI), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and COVID-19 diseases has clinical interest. We hypothesized that the diversity of microbiome compositions and their genomic features are associated with different pathological conditions of these human respiratory tract diseases (COVID-19 and non-COVID; URTI and COPD). To test this hypothesis, we analyzed 21 whole metagenome sequences (WMS) including eleven COVID-19 (BD = 6 and China = 5), six COPD (UK = 6) and four URTI (USA = 4) samples to unravel the diversity of microbiomes, their genomic features and relevant metabolic functions. The WMS data mapped to 534 bacterial, 60 archaeal and 61 viral genomes with distinct variation in the microbiome composition across the samples (COVID-19>COPD>URTI). Notably, 94.57%, 80.0% and 24.59% bacterial, archaeal and viral genera shared between the COVID-19 and non-COVID samples, respectively, however, the COVID-19 related samples had sole association with 16 viral genera other than SARS-CoV-2. Strain-level virome profiling revealed 660 and 729 strains in COVID-19 and non-COVID sequence data, respectively and of them 34.50% strains shared between the conditions. Functional annotation of metagenomics sequences of thevCOVID-19 and non-COVID groups identified the association of several biochemical pathways related to basic metabolism (amino acid and energy), ABC transporters, membrane transport, replication and repair, clustering-based subsystems, virulence, disease and defense, adhesion, regulation of virulence, programmed cell death, and primary immunodeficiency. We also detected 30 functional gene groups/classes associated with resistance to antibiotics and toxic compounds (RATC) in both COVID-19 and non-COVID microbiomes. Furthermore, a predominant higher abundance of cobalt-zinc-cadmium resistance (CZCR) and multidrug resistance to efflux pumps (MREP) genes were detected in COVID-19 metagenome. The profiles of microbiome diversity and associated microbial genomic features found in both COVID-19 and non-COVID (COPD and URTI) samples might be helpful for developing the microbiome-based diagnostics and therapeutics for COVID-19 and non-COVID respiratory diseases. However, future studies might be carried out to explore the microbiome dynamics and the cross-talk between host and microbiomes employing larger volume of samples from different ethnic groups and geoclimatic conditions.","Hoque, M.

METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 15 patients attending the Kingston Health Sciences Centre. The interviews were 20–25 min in length and recorded through an audio recorder. Thematic analysis was conducted in order to derive the major themes explored in this study. RESULTS: New mothers must often adopt new routines to balance their needs and their child’s needs. These routines could impact compliance and motivation to attend follow-up care. In our study, participants expressed high satisfaction with virtual care, emphasizing benefits related to comfort, convenience, communication, socioeconomic factors, and the ease of technology use. Participants also perceived that they could receive emotional support and build trust with their health care providers despite the remote nature of their care.

Quarantine strategies play the key role on the disease controlling and public health in the world with this pandemic of the COVID-19 defined by the World Health Organization. Methods: In this study, a SEIRQ epidemic model was developed to explore the dynamic changes of COVID-19 in Wuhan and mainland China, from Jan 27, 2020 to Mar 5, 2020. Moreover, to investigate the effects of the quarantine strategies, two perspectives are employed from the different quarantine magnitudes and quarantine time points. Results: The major results suggest that the COVID-19 variations are well captured by the epidemic model with very high accuracy in the cumulative confirmed cases, confirmed cases, cumulative recovered cases and cumulative death cases. The quarantine magnitudes in the susceptible individuals play larger roles on the disease control than the impacts of the quarantines of the exposed individuals and infectious individuals. For the quarantine time points, it shows that the early quarantine strategy is significantly important for the disease controlling. The time delayed quarantining will seriously increase the COVID-19 disease patients and prolongs the days of the disease extinction. Conclusions: Our model can simulate and predict the COVID-19 variations and the quarantine strategies are important for the disease controlling, especially at the early period of the disease outbreak. These conclusions provide important scientific information for the government policymaker in the disease control strategies.","Cui, Qianqian; Hu, Zengyun; Li, Yingke; Han, Junmei; Teng, Zhidong; Qian, Jing",J Infect Public Health,420,3

This study compared nine wild hemp (C. sativa spp. spontanea V.) accessions with 13 registered cultivars, eight breeding lines, and one cannabidiol (CBD) hemp strain belonging to C. sativa L. The first three groups had similar main essential oil (EO) constituents, but in different concentrations; the CBD hemp had a different EO profile. The concentration of the four major constituents in the industrial hemp lines and wild hemp accessions varied as follows: β-caryophyllene 11–22% and 15.4–29.6%; α-humulene 4.4–7.6% and 5.3–11.9%; caryophyllene oxide 8.6–13.7% and 0.2–31.2%; and humulene epoxide 2, 2.3–5.6% and 1.2–9.5%, respectively. The concentration of CBD in the EO of wild hemp varied from 6.9 to 52.4% of the total oil while CBD in the EO of the registered cultivars varied from 7.1 to 25%; CBD in the EO of the breeding lines and in the CBD strain varied from 6.4 to 25% and 7.4 to 8.8%, respectively. The concentrations of δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in the EO of the three groups of hemp were significantly different, with the highest concentration being 3.5%. The EO of wild hemp had greater antimicrobial activity compared with the EO of registered cultivars. This is the first report to show that significant amounts of CBD could be accumulated in the EO of wild and registered cultivars of hemp following hydro-distillation. The amount of CBD in the EO can be greater than that in the EO of the USA strain used for commercial production of CBD. Furthermore, this is among the first reports that show greater antimicrobial activity of the EO of wild hemp vs. the EO of registered cultivars. The results suggest that wild hemp may offer an excellent opportunity for future breeding and the selection of cultivars with a desirable composition of the EO and possibly CBD-rich EO production.","Zheljazkov, Valtcho D.; Sikora, Vladimir; Dincheva, Ivayla; Kačániová, Miroslava; Astatkie, Tess; Semerdjieva, Ivanka B.; Latkovic, Dragana",Molecules,420,30

Understanding micro-level patterns in US rates of COVID-19 can inform specific prevention strategies. METHODS: Using a negative binomial mixed-effects regression model we evaluated the association between a broad set of US county-level sociodemographic, economic, and health-status-related characteristics and cumulative rates of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths between January 22, 2020 and August 31, 2020. RESULTS: Rates of COVID-19 cases and deaths were higher in US counties that were more urban or densely-populated or that had more crowded housing, air pollution, women, 20–49-year-olds, racial/ethnic minorities, residential segregation, income inequality, uninsured, diabetics, or mobility outside the home during the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this study provides the most comprehensive multivariable analysis of county-level predictors of rates of COVID-19 cases and deaths conducted to date. Our findings make clear that ensuring that COVID-19 preventive measures, including vaccines when available, reach vulnerable and minority communities and are distributed in a manner that meaningfully disrupts transmission (in addition to protecting those at highest risk of severe disease) will likely be critical to stem the pandemic.","McLaughlin, John M; Khan, Farid; Pugh, Sarah; Angulo, Frederick J; Schmidt, Heinz-Joe; Isturiz, Raul E; Jodar, Luis; Swerdlow, David L",Clin Infect Dis,420,1

To date, 06 human coronaviruses (HCoVs) are reported; α-CoVs (HCoVs-NL63 and HCoVs-229E) and β-CoVs (HCoVs-OC43, HCoVs-HKU1, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV). While, novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is the most recent member. The genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 is 82% similar to SARS–COV-1. The compelling evidences link the progression of viral infection of SARS-CoV-2 with excessive inflammation as a result of the exaggerated immune response and elevated production of “immunocytokines” resulting in cytokine storm (CS); followed by a series of events, like acute organ damage, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) as well as death. Hence attempts to reduce cytokine storm are now being considered as a new paradigm shift in the clinical management of SARS-CoV-2. Tocilizumab (IL-6 blocker), Baricitinib (JAKs and AAK1 inhibitor), TNFα inhibitors (Infliximab, Adalimumab, Certolizumab) are currently being evaluated for possible block of the CS. Hence, rationalizing anti-inflammatory therapeutics would be the most judicious approach for significant reduction in COVID-19 mortality. In order to elucidate optimized and rationaled use of different therapeutics in COVID-19, we collated latest available information from emerging scientific evidences, integrated previous attempts as well as clinical successes, and various adopted approaches to mitigate past outbreaks with of SARS-CoV and MERS CoV.","Hyder Pottoo, Faheem; Abu-Izneid, Tareq; Mohammad Ibrahim, Abdallah; Noushad Javed, Md.; AlHajri, Noora; Hamrouni, Amar M.",Saudi Pharm J,420,16

As a result of the study, which was conducted with 330 caregivers, it was determined that the caregivers’ level of gratitude was high. In this study, it was found that the caregivers used mostly turning to religion, planning, positive reinterpretation, and instrumental social support as coping styles respectively. It was established that there was a significant correlation between caregivers’ depression level and gender, education level, level of gratitude, focus on and venting of emotions, substance use, behavioural disengagement, positive reinterpretation, using emotional social support and planning coping styles. The depression disclosure level was found to be 17.8%.

METHODS: Patients with rheumatoid arthritis, spondyloarthritis, and gout from 3 hospitals in different regions in The Netherlands completed the Health Literacy Questionnaire (HLQ). Hierarchical cluster analysis was used to identify patients’ health literacy profiles based on 9 HLQ domains. A multinomial regression model with the identified health literacy profiles as the dependent variable was fitted to assess whether patients with a given disease type or attending a given hospital were more likely to belong to a specific profile. RESULTS: Among 895 participating patients, the lowest mean HLQ domain scores (indicating most difficulty) were found for “critical appraisal,” “navigating the health system,” and “finding good health information.” The 10 identified profiles revealed substantial diversity in combinations of strengths and weaknesses. While 42% of patients scored moderate to high on all 9 domains (profiles 1 and 3), another 42% of patients (profiles 2, 4, 5, and 6) clearly struggled with 1 or several aspects of health literacy. Notably, 16% (profiles 7–10) exhibited difficulty across a majority of health literacy domains. The probability of belonging to one of the profiles was independent of the hospital where the patient was treated or the type of rheumatic disease. CONCLUSION: Ten distinct health literacy profiles were identified among patients with rheumatic diseases, independent of disease type and treating hospital. These profiles can be used to facilitate the development of health literacy interventions in rheumatology.","Bakker, Mark M.; Putrik, Polina; Rademakers, Jany; van de Laar, Mart; Vonkeman, Harald; Kok, Marc R.; Voorneveld‐Nieuwenhuis, Hanneke; Ramiro, Sofia; de Wit, Maarten; Buchbinder, Rachelle; Batterham, Roy; Osborne, Richard H.; Boonen, Annelies",Arthritis Care Res (Hoboken),420,8

There is a need for effective therapeutics to battle the ongoing pandemic. Repurposing existing drugs with known pharmacological safety profiles is a fast and cost-effective approach to identify novel treatments. The COVID-19 etiologic agent is the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a single-stranded positive-sense RNA virus. Coronaviruses rely on the enzymatic activity of the replication-transcription complex (RTC) to multiply inside host cells. The RTC core catalytic component is the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) holoenzyme. The RdRp is one of the key druggable targets for CoVs due to its essential role in viral replication, high degree of sequence and structural conservation and the lack of homologs in human cells. Here, we have expressed, purified and biochemically characterised active SARS-CoV-2 RdRp complexes. We developed a novel fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based strand displacement assay for monitoring SARS-CoV-2 RdRp activity suitable for a high-throughput format. As part of a larger research project to identify inhibitors for all the enzymatic activities encoded by SARS-CoV-2, we used this assay to screen a custom chemical library of over 5000 approved and investigational compounds for novel SARS-CoV-2 RdRp inhibitors. We identified 3 novel compounds (GSK-650394, C646 and BH3I-1) and confirmed suramin and suramin-like compounds as in vitro SARS-CoV-2 RdRp activity inhibitors. We also characterised the antiviral efficacy of these drugs in cell-based assays that we developed to monitor SARS-CoV-2 growth.","Bertolin, Agustina P.; Weissmann, Florian; Zeng, Jingkun; Posse, Viktor; Milligan, Jennifer C.; Canal, Berta; Ulferts, Rachel; Wu, Mary; Drury, Lucy S.; Howell, Michael; Beale, Rupert; Diffley, John F.X.",bioRxiv,420,2

This study aims to report the temporal changes in individuals' psychological wellbeing, perceived discrimination, sociopolitical perceptions and information-seeking behaviours among the general public in Hubei, China. Data were obtained from a two-wave survey of 1902 respondents aged 18–80 in Hubei province during the peak and mitigation stages of the outbreak. The results showed that the prevalence of psychological distress dropped from over 75% to around 15% throughout the study period, but perceived discrimination remained stable. Female, middle-aged, well-educated respondents and those employed in government/public institutions/state-owned enterprises tended to report more distress. While respondents' attention on COVID-19 information kept high and stable, their sources of information diversified across different sociodemographic groups. Over time, people obtained more social support from neighbourhoods than from their friends and relatives or non-government organisations. Over 80% of respondents were satisfied with the performance of the central government, which was notably higher than their ratings on the local government and neighbourhood/village committees.

This system was designed to remotely monitor vital signs, to calculate an automated Early Warning Score (aEWS) and to help identify patients at risk of deterioration. METHODS: Hospitalized patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 were connected to two wireless sensors measuring vital signs. Patients were divided into two groups based on the occurrence of adverse events during hospitalization. Heart and respiratory rate were monitored continuously and an automated EWS was calculated every 5 minutes. Data were compared between groups. RESULTS: Prior to the occurrence of adverse events, significantly higher median heart and respiration rate and significantly lower median SPO2 values were observed. Mean and median automated EWS were significantly higher in patients with an adverse event. CONCLUSION: Continuous monitoring systems might help to detect clinical deterioration in COVID-19 patients at an earlier stage. LAY SUMMARY: A new monitoring system was implemented to support nursing staff and physicians on the COVID-19 ward. This system was designed to remotely monitor vital signs, like respiratory rate, heart rate and the oxygen level in the blood. These parameters were used to calculate an automated early warning score which helps to identify patients at risk of deterioration. Hospitalized patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 were connected to two wireless sensors. Heart and respiratory rate were monitored continuously and an automated EWS was calculated every 5 minutes. Data were compared between patients at the COVID-19 ward and patients who were transported to the ICU or died. COVID patients at the ICU or those who died had significantly higher median heart and respiration rate and significantly lower median oxygen levels. These findings showed that continuous monitoring systems might help to detect clinical deterioration in COVID-19 patients at an earlier stage.","de Ree, Roy; Willemsen, Jorn; te Grotenhuis, Gilbert; de Ree, Rick; Kolkert, Joé; Peppelman, Malou",JAMIA Open,420,16

In 2016, 4.5 billion pounds of food waste was diverted through a network of 200 regional food banks, a fivefold increase in just 20 years. Recent global trade disruptions and the COVID-19 pandemic have further reinforced this trend. Economic geographers studying charitable food networks argue that its infrastructure and moral substructure serve to revalue food waste and surplus labor in the capitalist food system. The political–legal framework undergirding this revaluation process however is still poorly understood. Drawing on a 6-year institutional ethnography of the food banking economy in West Virginia, this paper takes a supply-side approach to examine the material and moral values driving the expansion of food waste recovery as hunger relief. Empirically, it focuses on the laws, contracts and fiscal incentives regulating charitable food procurement at the U.S. Department of Agriculture and Feeding America. The assemblage of government agencies, private businesses and non-profit organizations enrolled into this gift economy at different scales I argue, serves to enclose food waste into a public–private governance structure that regulates food surpluses and ensures these will not disrupt the scarcity logics driving profitability along primary food circuits.","Lohnes, Joshua D.",Agric Human Values,420,1

The objective was to determine if the use of injectable trace minerals (ITM; Se, Zn, Cu, and Mn) concurrent with a modified-live virus (MLV) vaccine enhances the immune response and onset of protection in beef calves challenged with BVDV2 five days after vaccination. Forty-five calves were randomly assigned to one of three groups (15/group): VAC + ITM, received MLV-vaccine and ITM (Multimin®90) subcutaneously (SC); VAC + SAL, received the same vaccine and saline SC; or UNVAC, unvaccinated. Five days after vaccination (d.0), calves were challenged with BVDV2 strain 890. Health status was evaluated and blood samples were collected for leukocyte counts, BVDV1 and 2 serum neutralizing antibody (SNA), BVDV-PCR, percentage of CD4+, CD8+, WC1+ and CD25+ T-cells. VAC + ITM had lower health scores than UNVAC (d.8 and 9). VAC + ITM had higher BVDV1 & 2 SNA titers than VAC + SAL and UNVAC on d.21 and 28. Lymphocyte counts decreased in UNVAC but not in VAC + ITM or VAC + SAL (d.3 to 11). CD4+ T-cells significantly decreased in UNVAC and VAC + SAL (d.3). VAC + ITM had higher percentage of CD4+ cells than UNVAC (d.3 and 7). VAC + ITM had lower percentage of activated CD4+ and CD8+ than UNVAC (d.7). In summary, vaccination induced a rapid protection against BVDV2 infection. Administration of ITM was associated with increased SNA response to BVDV1 & 2, enhanced health status, mitigation of CD4+ T-cells decreased, and reduction of T-cell activation in calves challenged with BVDV2 five days after immunization. These results support the strategic use of ITM concurrent with vaccination, especially when a rapid protection is needed in newly received beef calves.","Bittar, João H.J.; Palomares, Roberto A.; Hurley, David J.; Hoyos-Jaramillo, Alejandro; Rodriguez, Adriana; Stoskute, Agne; Hamrick, Brianna; Norton, Natalie; Adkins, Morgan; Saliki, Jeremiah T.; Sanchez, Susan; Lauber, Kelsey",Vet Immunol Immunopathol,420,28

These cases were further analyzed in order to cluster the behavior of criminal groups in response to the COVID-19 emergency, and the means by which they tried to exploit the pandemic to strengthen their political and economic power. We found that different governance-type criminal groups proposed themselves as institutions able to mitigate the burdens imposed by the pandemic by providing support to people in need and enforcing social-distancing measures. Further, identified cases did not provide evidence of groups devoted to the provision of illicit services and goods assuming any governance role.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome due to novel Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) related infection (COVID-19) is characterized by severe ventilation perfusion mismatch leading to refractory hypoxemia. To date, there is no specific treatment available for COVID-19. Nitric oxide is a selective pulmonary vasodilator gas used as a rescue therapy in refractory hypoxemia due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). In has also shown invitro and clinical evidence that inhaled nitric oxide gas (iNO) has antiviral activity against other strains of coronavirus. The primary aim of this study is to determine whether inhaled NO improves oxygenation in patients with hypoxic COVID-19. This is a multicenter randomized controlled trial with 1:1 individual allocation. Patients will be blinded to the treatment. METHODS AND ANALYSIS. Intubated patients admitted to the intensive care unit with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe hypoxemia will be randomized to receive inhalation of NO (treatment group) or not (control group). Treatment will be stopped when patients are free from hypoxemia for more than 24 hours. The primary outcome evaluates levels of oxygenation between the two groups at 48 hours. Secondary outcomes include rate of survival rate at 28 and 90 days in the two groups, time to resolution of severe hypoxemia, time to achieve negativity of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR tests. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION. The study protocol has been approved by the Investigational Review Board of Xijing Hospital (Xi’an, China) and by the Partners Human Research Committee (Boston, USA). Recruitment will start after approval of both IRBs and local IRBs at other enrolling centers. Results of this study will be published in scientific journals, presented at scientific meetings, reported through flyers and posters, and published on related website or media in combating against this widespread contagious disease.

Population studies, clinical studies, and in vitro animal studies underscore the critical importance of oral health to systemic health. These inextricable relationships come to the forefront as oral diseases, such as periodontal disease, take root. Special populations bring to bear the multimodal relationships between oral and systemic health. Specifically, periodontal disease has been associated with diabetes, metabolic syndrome, obesity, eating disorders, liver disease, cardiovascular disease, Alzheimer disease, rheumatoid arthritis, adverse pregnancy outcomes, and cancer. Although bidirectional relationships are recognized, the potential for multiple comorbidities, relationships, and connections (multimodal relationships) also exists. Proposed mechanisms that mediate this connection between oral and systemic health include predisposing and precipitating factors, such as genetic factors (gene polymorphisms), environmental factors (stress, habits—such as smoking and high‐fat diets/consumption of highly processed foods), medications, microbial dysbiosis and bacteremias/viremias/microbemias, and an altered host immune response. Thus, in a susceptible host, these predisposing and precipitating factors trigger the onset of periodontal disease and systemic disease/conditions. Further, high‐throughput sequencing technologies are shedding light on the dark matter that comprises the oral microbiome. This has resulted in better characterization of the oral microbial dysbiosis, including putative bacterial periodontopathogens and shifts in oral virome composition during disease. Multiple laboratory and clinical studies have illustrated that both eukaryotic and prokaryotic viruses within subgingival plaque and periodontal tissues affect periodontal inflammation, putative periodontopathogens, and the host immune response. Although the association between herpesviruses and periodontitis and the degree to which these viruses directly aggravate periodontal tissue damage remain unclear, the benefits to periodontal health found from prolonged administration of antivirals in immunocompromised or immunodeficient individuals demonstrates that specific populations are possibly more susceptible to viral periodontopathogens. Thus, it may be important to further examine the implications of viral pathogen involvement in periodontitis and perhaps it is time to embrace the viral dark matter within the periodontal environment to fully comprehend the pathogenesis and systemic implications of periodontitis. Emerging data from the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic further underscores the inextricable connection between oral and systemic health, with high levels of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 angiotensin‐converting enzyme 2 receptor noted on oral tissues (tongue) and an allostatic load or overload paradigm of chronic stress likely contributing to rapid breakdown of oral/dental, periodontal, and peri‐implant tissues. These associations exist within a framework of viremias/bacteremias/microbemias, systemic inflammation, and/or disturbances of the immune system in a susceptible host. A thorough review of systemic and oral diseases and conditions and their mechanistic, predisposing, and precipitating factors are paramount to better addressing the oral and systemic health and needs of our patients.","Kapila, Yvonne L.",Periodontol 2000,420,26

To develop tailored coastal climate services that can inform decision makers on climate adaptation in coastal cities, a better understanding and modeling of multifaceted urban dynamics is important. We develop a coastal urban model family, where the population growth and urbanization rates are modeled in the framework of diffusion over the half-bounded and bounded domains, and apply the maximum entropy principle to the latter case. Population density distributions are derived analytically whenever possible. Steady-state wave solutions balancing the width of inhabited coastal zones, with the skewed distributions maximizing population entropy, might be responsible for the coastward migrations outstripping the demographic development of the hinterland. With appropriate modifications of boundary conditions, the developed family of diffusion models can describe coastal urban dynamics affected by climate change.","Kovalevsky, Dmitry V.; Volchenkov, Dimitri; Scheffran, Jürgen",Entropy (Basel),420,26

METHODS: Between June and July 2020, an online questionnaire was used to collect information on the demographic and professional profiles of dentists and their levels of knowledge, perception, and attitudes towards teledentistry. Descriptive statistics were reported as percentages, and Chi-squared test was used to compare responses amongst general practitioners, specialists, and those with varying levels of professional experience. RESULTS: This study included 575 dentists, the majority of whom were from the southeast region of Brazil (73.4%) and had a specialist degree (70.4%). Approximately 42.4% of the study sample had graduated more than 10 years ago, 39.3% between 2 and 10 years ago, and 18.3% up to 2 years ago. In general, the majority of dentists exhibited only a superficial awareness of the resolution that regulates teledentistry in Brazil. A greater number of specialists were aware of the resolution (P = .007) and felt confident performing teledentistry (P = .000) compared to general practitioners, whilst those with more experience (graduated more than 10 years ago) exhibited greater knowledge (P = .012) and preparation (P = .000). More than 60% of the dentists, regardless of dental specialty and clinical experience, had no knowledge of providing prescriptions via teledentistry. The majority of general practitioners (89.5%) and specialists (81.4%) had no previous experience using teledentistry. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study suggest that Brazilian dentists are inadequately prepared for the implementation of teledentistry.","Raucci-Neto, Walter; de Souza Pereira, Mariele; Cerqueira, Nathália Mancioppi; Louzada, Victoria Gabriela; de Castro Raucci, Larissa Moreira Spinola; Leoni, Graziela Bianchi",Int. dent. j,420,21

Burn patients are physiologically immunocompromised, increasing the risk of COVID-19 infection in them. This study analyzes the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on patient trends in a burn and plastic unit and assesses the effect of COVID-19 infection in burns. Methods This single-center, retrospective observational case–control study was conducted in the Department of Burns, Plastic and Maxillofacial Surgery of a tertiary care hospital in New Delhi, India. Patient data was collected from April 1, 2019 to August 10, 2019 and from April 1, 2020 to August 10, 2020. All data of burns and trauma patients collected was analyzed and compared. Results There were total 350 admissions during COVID time period and 562 admissions during non-COVID time period. The admission rate, type of burn injury, and death rate did not vary significantly during the two time periods. Thermal burn was the most common type of burn injury. There were total 18 cases diagnosed to be COVID-19 positive during the pandemic. There were two deaths among COVID-19 positive burn cases. Conclusion This study finds no difference in patient patterns during COVID and non-COVID time period. Amongst burn patients, no increased risk of COVID-19 infection is seen with larger body surface area of burns. No increase in mortality is seen in burn patients infected with COVID-19.","Aggarwal, Nupur; Srivastava, Rakesh Kumar",Indian J Plast Surg,420,26

An effective tool to measure HRCD in healthcare workers would help inform teams to undertake more locally led research. The objective of this systematic review is to identify tools measuring healthcare workers’ individual capacities to conduct research. DESIGN: Systematic review and narrative synthesis using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses checklist for reporting systematic reviews and narrative synthesis and the Critical Appraisals Skills Programme (CASP) checklist for qualitative studies. DATA SOURCES: 11 databases were searched from inception to 16 January 2020. The first 10 pages of Google Scholar results were also screened. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: We included papers describing the use of tools/to measure/assess HRCD at an individual level among healthcare workers involved in research. Qualitative, mixed and quantitative methods were all eligible. Search was limited to English language only. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Two authors independently screened and reviewed studies using Covidence software, and performed quality assessments using the extraction log validated against the CASP qualitative checklist. The content method was used to define a narrative synthesis. RESULTS: The titles and abstracts for 7474 unique records were screened and the full texts of 178 references were reviewed. 16 papers were selected: 7 quantitative studies; 1 qualitative study; 5 mixed methods studies; and 3 studies describing the creation of a tool. Tools with different levels of accuracy in measuring HRCD in healthcare workers at the individual level were described. The Research Capacity and Culture tool and the ‘Research Spider’ tool were the most commonly defined. Other tools designed for ad hoc interventions with good generalisability potential were identified. Three papers described health research core competency frameworks. All tools measured HRCD in healthcare workers at an individual level with the majority adding a measurement at the team/organisational level, or data about perceived barriers and motivators for conducting health research. CONCLUSIONS: Capacity building is commonly identified with pre/postintervention evaluations without using a specific tool. This shows the need for a clear distinction between measuring the outcomes of training activities in a team/organisation, and effective actions promoting HRCD. This review highlights the lack of globally applicable comprehensive tools to provide comparable, standardised and consistent measurements of research competencies.

They are not immune to the perils of psychological distress and its cascading consequences including suicide, contrary to the popular societal myths. The intrinsic and extrinsic pressures of the profession, persistent discourse in managing the psychological distress of others, professional burnout, self-stigma, societal apathy and easy access to psychotropics are certain factors making the MHPs more vulnerable. This disengagement and stress can contribute to depression, anxiety and complex trauma in the MHPs.

The pandemic is historic in scope and precedent given its emergence in an increasingly digital era. Importantly, there have been concerns about the accuracy of COVID-19 case counts due to issues such as lack of access to testing and difficulty in measuring recoveries. OBJECTIVE: The aims of this study were to detect and characterize user-generated conversations that could be associated with COVID-19-related symptoms, experiences with access to testing, and mentions of disease recovery using an unsupervised machine learning approach. METHODS: Tweets were collected from the Twitter public streaming application programming interface from March 3-20, 2020, filtered for general COVID-19-related keywords and then further filtered for terms that could be related to COVID-19 symptoms as self-reported by users. Tweets were analyzed using an unsupervised machine learning approach called the biterm topic model (BTM), where groups of tweets containing the same word-related themes were separated into topic clusters that included conversations about symptoms, testing, and recovery. Tweets in these clusters were then extracted and manually annotated for content analysis and assessed for their statistical and geographic characteristics. RESULTS: A total of 4,492,954 tweets were collected that contained terms that could be related to COVID-19 symptoms. After using BTM to identify relevant topic clusters and removing duplicate tweets, we identified a total of 3465 (<1%) tweets that included user-generated conversations about experiences that users associated with possible COVID-19 symptoms and other disease experiences. These tweets were grouped into five main categories including first- and secondhand reports of symptoms, symptom reporting concurrent with lack of testing, discussion of recovery, confirmation of negative COVID-19 diagnosis after receiving testing, and users recalling symptoms and questioning whether they might have been previously infected with COVID-19. The co-occurrence of tweets for these themes was statistically significant for users reporting symptoms with a lack of testing and with a discussion of recovery. A total of 63% (n=1112) of the geotagged tweets were located in the United States. CONCLUSIONS: This study used unsupervised machine learning for the purposes of characterizing self-reporting of symptoms, experiences with testing, and mentions of recovery related to COVID-19. Many users reported symptoms they thought were related to COVID-19, but they were not able to get tested to confirm their concerns. In the absence of testing availability and confirmation, accurate case estimations for this period of the outbreak may never be known. Future studies should continue to explore the utility of infoveillance approaches to estimate COVID-19 disease severity.","Mackey, Tim; Purushothaman, Vidya; Li, Jiawei; Shah, Neal; Nali, Matthew; Bardier, Cortni; Liang, Bryan; Cai, Mingxiang; Cuomo, Raphael",JMIR Public Health Surveill,420,20

Dizziness Handicap Inventory (DHI) scores 0–3 months post-intervention were reported by four studies. Meta-analysis identified a 1.13 (95% CI, − 1.74, − 0.52) standardized mean difference reduction in DHI in VR and AR treated patients compared to controls. Side effects reported by two studies were reduced by week four of VR intervention. Bias assessment identified DHI scores and side effects to be at high risk or of some concern. Adjunct VR interventions reduced patient DHI significantly more than vestibular rehabilitation alone 0–3 months post-intervention in adult patients diagnosed with unilateral vestibular disease. High quality studies are needed.","Heffernan, Austin; Abdelmalek, Mohammed; Nunez, Desmond A.",Sci Rep,420,16

Despite the natural co-occurrence of intrapersonal and interpersonal conflicts in the transformation toward sustainability, both types of conflicts have been studied predominantly in isolation. In this conceptual article, we breathe new life into the traditional dialog between individual decision-making and negotiation research and address critical psychological barriers to the transformation toward sustainability. In particular, we argue that research on intrapersonal and interpersonal conflicts should be tightly integrated to provide a richer understanding of the interplay between these conflicts. We propose a novel, unifying framework of interdependent conflicts that systematically structures this interplay, and we analyze how complex interdependencies between the social (i.e., conflict between decision-makers) and temporal (i.e., conflict within a decision-maker) dimensions pose fundamental psychological barriers to mutually beneficial solutions. Since challenges to conflict resolution in the transformation toward sustainability emerge not only between individual decision-makers but also frequently between groups of decision-makers, we scale the framework up to the level of social groups and thereby provide an interdependent-conflicts perspective on the interplay between intra- and intergenerational conflicts. Overall, we propose simple, testable propositions, identify intervention approaches, and apply them to transition management. By analyzing the challenges faced by negotiating parties during interdependent conflicts and highlighting potential intervention approaches, we contribute to the transformation toward sustainability. Finally, we discuss implications of the framework and point to avenues for future research.","Majer, Johann M.; Barth, Matthias; Zhang, Hong; van Treek, Marie; Trötschel, Roman",Front Psychol,420,23

There is possibility of moderated mediation effect in the association between these variables. Objectives: To examine whether risk perception determines the association between COVID-19 knowledge and precautionary behaviour among Nigerians, taking into consideration the gender differentials that may exist in the process. Design: A web-based cross-sectional study. Setting: Participants were recruited via social media platform, WhatsApp using google form from March 28 to April 4, 2020. Participants: 1500-Nigerian (mean age =27.43, SD=9.75 with 42.7% females and 57.3% males) were recruited from 180 cities in Nigeria using snowball sampling technique. They responded to an online survey form comprising demographic questions and adapted versions of the Ebola knowledge scale, SARS risk perception scale and a precautionary behavior scale. Result: Moderated mediation analysis showed that risk perception mediated the association between COVID-19 knowledge and precautionary behavior and this indirect effect was moderated by gender. Having correct knowledge of COVID-19 was linked to higher involvement in precautionary behavior through risk perception for females but not for males. COVID-19 awareness campaigns may target raising more awareness of the risks associated with the infection in order to make individuals engage more in precautionary behaviors. Conclusion: Awareness campaigns and psychological intervention strategies may be particularly important at the moment, for males more than females.","Iorfa, S. K.; Ottu, I. F.

Remdesivir has been approved for the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in several countries, but its use as monotherapy has not substantially lowered mortality rates. Because agents from traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) have been successfully utilized to treat pandemic and endemic diseases, we designed the current study to identify novel anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents from TCM. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We initially used an antivirus-induced cell death assay to screen a panel of herbal extracts. The inhibition of the viral infection step was investigated through a time-of-drug-addition assay, whereas a plaque reduction assay was carried out to validate the antiviral activity. Direct interaction of the candidate TCM compound with viral particles was assessed using a viral inactivation assay. Finally, the potential synergistic efficacy of remdesivir and the TCM compound was examined with a combination assay. RESULTS: The herbal medicine Perilla leaf extract (PLE, approval number 022427 issued by the Department of Health and Welfare of Taiwan) had EC(50) of 0.12 ± 0.06 mg/mL against SARS-CoV-2 in Vero E6 cells – with a selectivity index of 40.65. Non-cytotoxic PLE concentrations were capable of blocking viral RNA and protein synthesis. In addition, they significantly decreased virus-induced cytokine release and viral protein/RNA levels in the human lung epithelial cell line Calu-3. PLE inhibited viral replication by inactivating the virion and showed additive-to-synergistic efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 when used in combination with remdesivir. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate for the first time that PLE is capable of inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 replication by inactivating the virion. Our data may prompt additional investigation on the clinical usefulness of PLE for preventing or treating COVID-19.","Tang, Wen-Fang; Tsai, Hui-Ping; Chang, Yu-Hsiu; Chang, Tein-Yao; Hsieh, Chung-Fan; Lin, Chia-Yi; Lin, Guan-Hua; Chen, Yu-Li; Jheng, Jia-Rong; Liu, Ping-Cheng; Yang, Chuen-Mi; Chin, Yuan-Fan; Chen, Cheng Cheung; Kau, Jyh-Hwa; Hung, Yi-Jen; Hsieh, Po-Shiuan; Horng, Jim-Tong",Biomed J,420,15

METHODS: One hundred and one patients diagnosed with COVID‐19 who underwent serial peripheral blood collection and chest computed tomography (CT) imaging were enrolled in this study and grouped by the severity of their illness. Changes in the immune and cardiovascular systems were analysed and compared between groups. RESULTS: The study included 43 women and 58 men, with a median age of 45 years (interquartile range [IQR], 16–71). We identified spleen shrinkage in 27.7% of study patients. Ratios of spleen volume to patient (skin) volume were compared, with evidence that severe patients had more splenic shrinkage than mild patients. Lymphopenia was observed in 65.3% of patients, and 27.3% of patients had persistently low levels of lymphocytes after discharge. Tachycardia occurred mainly during the first 2 days of hospitalisation, with increases in creatine kinase–myocardial band levels in 10 (9.9%) patients and arrhythmias in 16 (15.8%) patients. CONCLUSIONS: In addition to pulmonary manifestations, our study demonstrated that other organ systems can also be affected during COVID‐19 infection, with evidence of immunosuppression and cardiovascular dysfunction, which may contribute to increased mortality rates in critically ill COVID‐19 patients.","Bao, Hejing; Li, Gang; Fang, Yinhua; Lai, Qin; Bao, Hehong; Zheng, Yu; Hu, Yanjun",Clin Transl Immunology,420,16

In these circumstances, it is essential to understand the properties, key performance factors, filter mechanisms and evidence on cloth masks materials.

We present an overview of the filter materials, filter mechanisms and effectiveness, key performance factors, and hydrophobicity of the common disposable masks, as well as cloth masks. We also reviewed decontamination methods for disposable respiratory devices. As an alternative to surgical masks and respirators, we recommend a cloth mask made of at least three layers (300–350 threads per inch) and adding a nylon stocking layer over the mask for a better fit. Water-resistant fabrics (polyesters/nylon), blends of fabrics and water-absorbing fabrics (cotton) should be in the outside layer, middle layer/layers and inside layer, respectively.

However, the host immune response after severe 2009 pH1N1 infection is poorly understood. Herein, we investigated viral load, the immune response, and apoptosis in lung tissues from 50 fatal cases with 2009 pH1N1 virus infection. The results suggested that 7 of the 27 cytokines/chemokines showed remarkably high expression, including IL-1 receptor antagonist protein, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-α, IL-8, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, macrophage inflammatory protein 1-β, and interferon-inducible protein-10 in lung tissues of 2009 pH1N1 fatal cases. Viral load, which showed the highest level on day 7 of illness onset and persisted until day 17 of illness, was positively correlated with mRNA levels of IL-1 receptor antagonist protein, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, macrophage inflammatory protein 1-β, interferon-inducible protein-10, and regulated on activation normal T-cell expressed and secreted. Apoptosis was evident in lung tissues stained by the TUNEL assay. Decreased Fas and elevated FasL mRNA levels were present in lung tissues, and cleaved caspase-3 was frequently seen in pneumocytes, submucosal glands, and lymphoid tissues. The pathogenesis of the 2009 pH1N1 virus infection is associated with viral replication and production of proinflammatory mediators. FasL and caspase-3 are involved in the pathway of 2009 pH1N1 virus-induced apoptosis in lung tissues, and the disequilibrium between the Fas and FasL level in lung tissues could contribute to delayed clearance of the virus and subsequent pathological damages.","Gao, Rongbao; Bhatnagar, Julu; Blau, Dianna M.; Greer, Patricia; Rollin, Dominique C.; Denison, Amy M.; Deleon-Carnes, Marlene; Shieh, Wun-Ju; Sambhara, Suryaprakash; Tumpey, Terrence M.; Patel, Mitesh; Liu, Lindy; Paddock, Christopher; Drew, Clifton; Shu, Yuelong; Katz, Jacqueline M.; Zaki, Sherif R.",Am J Pathol,420,24

Although it is often alleged that rising income inequality will increase the advantages of the well-off in the competition for college, some researchers have provided descriptive evidence at odds with the income inequality hypothesis. In this paper, we track long-term trends in family income inequalities in college enrollment and completion (“collegiate inequalities”) using all available nationally representative datasets for cohorts born between 1908 and 1995. We show that the trends in collegiate inequalities moved in lockstep with the trend in income inequality over the past century. There is one exception to this general finding: For cohorts at risk for serving in the Vietnam War, collegiate inequalities were high, while income inequality was low. During this period, inequality in college enrollment and completion was significantly higher for men than for women, suggesting a bona fide “Vietnam War” effect. Aside from this singular confounding event, a century of evidence establishes a strong association between income and collegiate inequality, providing support for the view that rising income inequality is fundamentally changing the distribution of life chances.","Jackson, Michelle; Holzman, Brian",Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,420,5

It has been assumed that there is poor access to information related to the cause, prevention, and treatment of cataract in developing countries. There is also a paucity of data on knowledge and attitude towards cataract in Ethiopia. PURPOSE: This study aimed to assess the knowledge and attitude of cataract and their associated factors among adults in Arba Minch Zuria Woreda, Southern Ethiopia. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 623 adults from February 6 to April 16, 2020. The study participants were selected by the multi-stage sampling technique. Data were collected with a pre-tested structured questionnaire by using face-to-face interviews. The data were entered into Epi info version 7.2 and exported to SPSS version 23 for analysis. The level of statistical significance was set at a p-value less than 0.05 in multivariable logistic regression.

An innovative fabricated steel plate connection system, which consists of screws and steel plates embedded in concrete slabs, was adopted in the TCC beam specimens. The adopted shear connection can provide dry-type connection for TCC beams. Steel plates were embedded in concrete slabs while the concrete slab was constructed in factories. The timber beam and concrete slab can be assembled together using screws at the construction site. In this experimental programme, the beam specimens were subjected to constant loading for 613 days in indoor uncontrolled environments. The influence of long-term loading levels and the number of shear connections on the long-term performance of TCC beams was investigated and discussed. The mid-span deflection, timber strain, and interface relative slip at the positions of both connections and beam-ends were recorded throughout the long-term tests. It was found the long-term deflection of the TCC beam increased by approximately 60% while the long-term loads were doubled. Under the influence of the variable temperature and humidity, the TCC specimens with 8 shear connections showed slighter fluctuations compared with the TCC beam with 6 shear connections. In the 613-day observation period, the maximum deflection increment recorded was 6.56 mm for the specimen with eight shear connections and 20% loading level. A rheological model consisting of two Kelvin bodies was employed to fit the curves of creep coefficients. The final deflections predicted of all specimens at the end of 50-year service life were 2.1~2.7 times the initial deflections caused by the applied loads. All beam specimens showed relative small increments in mid-span deflection, strain and relative slip over time without any degradations, demonstrating the excellent long-term performance of TCC beams using the innovative steel plate connection system, which is also easily fabricated.","Shi, Benkai; Liu, Weiqing; Yang, Huifeng",Constr Build Mater,420,16

This study evaluated infrared thermography (IRT) and compared the influence of different imagers, ambient temperature discrepancy, and the distance between the subject and imager. Methods IRT-digital infrared thermal imaging (IRT-DITI), thermoguard, and ear drum IRT were used for visitors to Municipal Wang Fang Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan. The McNemar and c2 test, standard Pearson correlation, ANOVA, intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), and receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis were used to calculate the alarm temperature for each imager. Results A total of 1032 subjects were recruited. Different distances and ambient temperature discrepancy had a significant influence on thermoguard, and lateral and frontal view DITI. By ICC analysis, a significant difference was found at 10 m distance between ear drum IRT and thermoguard (r = 0.45), lateral view DITI (r = 0.37), and frontal view DITI (r = 0.44). With ROC analysis, the optimal preset cut-off temperatures for the different imagers were: 36.05°C for thermoguard (area under the curve [AUC], 0.716), 36.25°C for lateral view DITI (AUC, 0.801), and 36.25°C for frontal view DITI (AUC, 0.812). Conclusion The temperature readings obtained by IRT may be used as a proxy for core temperature. An effective IRT system with a strict operating protocol can be rapidly implemented at the entrance of a hospital during SARS or avian influenza epidemics.","Chiang, Ming-Fu; Lin, Po-Wei; Lin, Li-Fong; Chiou, Hung-Yi; Chien, Ching-Wen; Chu, Shu-Fen; Chiu, Wen-Ta",Journal of the Formosan Medical Association,420,14

Mass media is an alternative that could reach more people at lower cost but has rarely been rigorously evaluated. We assessed the effectiveness of a mass media campaign in improving handwashing knowledge and practices in rural Bangladesh. We conducted a cross-sectional assessment before the campaign among 8,947 households and again after 4 months of the campaign among 8,400 different households in the same areas. Trained enumerators conducted spot checks of water, sanitation, and hygiene facilities, and recorded reported knowledge and practices. We compared these outcomes after versus before the campaign using generalized linear models with robust standard errors. After the media campaign, caregivers were more likely to recall ≥ 3 messages regarding handwashing (prevalence ratio [PR] = 1.44, 1.34–1.55), sanitation (PR = 1.45, 1.35–1.55), and safe water (PR = 1.17, 1.08–1.26). After the campaign, the prevalence of using soap and water during handwashing demonstrations was higher among caregivers (PR = 1.15, 1.12–1.19) and children (PR = 1.31, 1.22–1.41). Hands were more commonly observed to be visibly clean among caregivers (PR = 1.14, 1.07–1.20) and children (PR = 1.13, 1.05–1.21).

Despite the strong potential to alleviate existential distress through psychosocial interventions, existential distress and its impact on healthcare outcomes have not yet been studied systematically. We aim to investigate the frequency, longitudinal trajectory and predictive impact of existential distress on end-of-life outcomes. We further aim to determine patients’ and caregivers’ specific need for and utilisation of psychosocial support for existential distress. METHODS: This longitudinal cohort study will consecutively recruit 500 patients with advanced cancer and 500 caregivers from oncological outpatient and inpatient clinics. Participants will complete self-report questionnaires (sociodemographic and disease-related characteristics, existential distress, end-of-life outcomes, resources and support needs) at five points of assessment (at baseline and after 3, 6, 9 and 12 months). At baseline and 6-month follow-up, we will conduct structured diagnostic interviews to assess mental disorders. Statistical analyses will include descriptive statistics to determine the prevalence of existential distress, mental disorders and end-of-life outcomes; multiple linear and logistic regression analyses to calculate the predictive impact of existential distress on end-of-life outcomes; and growth mixture models to analyse longitudinal trajectories of existential distress. DISCUSSION: This study will provide comprehensive knowledge about patients’ and caregivers’ existential concerns. The longitudinal empirical data will allow for conclusions concerning the frequency and course of existential distress throughout 1 year. This important extension of existing cross-sectional research will contribute to further develop targeted psychosocial interventions. Profiles of existential distress may be applied by clinicians from multiple professions and help to address existential concerns effectively. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study was approved by the institutional research ethics committee (reference number LPEK-0177). Results will be presented at scientific conferences and published in peer-reviewed journals. Other forms of dissemination will include sharing results on the psychometric properties of the structured demoralisation interview with international research groups and communication with healthcare professionals providing psychosocial treatment for patients and caregivers. Following scientific standards, our progress will be regularly updated on ClinicalTrials.gov.

METHODS: Prospective data on virus etiology of ARI hospitalizations during the peaks of 8 influenza seasons (2011-12 to 2018-19) in Quebec, Canada, was used to compare patients with HCoV to those with influenza infections; generalized estimation equations models were used for multivariate analyses. RESULTS: We identified 340 HCoV infections which affected 11.6%(n=136) of children and 5.2%(n=204) of adults hospitalized with ARI. The majority of children (75%) with HCoV infections were also coinfected with other respiratory viruses compared to 24% of the adults (p<0.0001). No deaths were recorded in children; 5.8% of adults with HCoV monoinfection compared to 4.2% of those with influenza monoinfection died (p=0.226). The risk of pneumonia was non-significantly lower in children with HCoV than with influenza but similarly high in adults. Markers of severity (length-of-stay, intensive-care admissions and case-fatality ratio) were comparable between these infections in multivariate analyses, both in children and adults. CONCLUSIONS: In children and adults hospitalized with ARI, HCoV infections were less frequent than influenza infections, but HCoV monoinfections were as severe as influenza monoinfections.","Gilca, Rodica; Carazo, Sara; Amini, Rachid; Charest, Hugues; De Serres, Gaston",J Infect Dis,420,1

It remains unclear, however, how the specialty’s priority on innovation materializes into commercialization or bench to bedside led by plastic surgeons. METHODS: Our analysis utilized Pitchbook (Seattle, Wash.), a market database of companies and investors, for ventures that have designed innovations related to plastic and reconstructive surgery. Companies were categorized into 5 focus areas: provider (outpatient surgical or hospital entity), aesthetics (cosmetics/injectables), devices (instrumentation, lasers, implants), regenerative medicine (tissue engineering/wound healing), and software (digital solutions). Company websites, LinkedIn (Sunnyvale, Calif.) profiles, and Crunchbase (San Francisco, Calif.) were reviewed to determine the leadership roles of plastic surgeons. RESULTS: Plastic surgeons primarily serve as advisors, as opposed to founders or chief executive officers (CEOs). Our analysis additionally found that provider and software solutions had a greater degree of plastic surgeon-led leadership, whereas regenerative medicine and device innovation remains less frequented. There was a relatively balanced representation of academic and private plastic surgeons in entrepreneurial pursuits. CONCLUSIONS: Plastic surgeons typically serve as board advisors, as opposed to founders and CEOs. Reasons for disengagement from leadership roles may include satisfaction with clinical work, time constraint, lack of business knowledge, financial constraint, and opportunity cost associated with starting a venture. To promote participation in innovation, future studies should explore tangible ways to engage in such opportunities. In doing so, plastic surgeons can own the “organ” of innovation, and continue to contribute to the legacy and the advancement of the specialty.","Khetpal, Sumun; Reátegui, Alvaro; Lopez, Joseph; Sacks, Justin M.; Prsic, Adnan",Plast Reconstr Surg Glob Open,420,18

During Plasmodium falciparum malaria in children, the activation of Tfh is restricted to the Th1 subset and not associated with antibody levels. To identify Tfh subsets that are associated with antibody development in malaria, we assess Tfh and antibodies longitudinally in human volunteers with experimental P. falciparum infection. Tfh cells activate during infection, with distinct dynamics in different Tfh subsets. Th2-Tfh cells activate early, during peak infection, while Th1-Tfh cells activate 1 week after peak infection and treatment. Th2-Tfh cell activation is associated with the functional breadth and magnitude of parasite antibodies. In contrast, Th1-Tfh activation is not associated with antibody development but instead with plasma cells, which have previously been shown to play a detrimental role in the development of long-lived immunity. Thus, our study identifies the contrasting roles of Th2 and Th1-Tfh cells during experimental P. falciparum malaria.","Chan, Jo-Anne; Loughland, Jessica R.; de Labastida Rivera, Fabian; SheelaNair, Arya; Andrew, Dean W.; Dooley, Nicholas L.; Wines, Bruce D.; Amante, Fiona H.; Webb, Lachlan; Hogarth, P.

Perceptual training has proved successful in improving multisensory temporal processing in young adults, but few studies have investigated this training approach in older adults. In the present study we used a simultaneity (or synchronicity) judgement task with feedback, to train the audio-visual abilities of community-dwelling, cognitively healthy older adults. We recruited 23 older adults (M = 74.17, SD = 6.23) and a group of 20 young adults (M = 24.20, SD = 4.23) who served as a comparison. Participants were tested before and after perceptual training using a 2-Interval Forced Choice Task (2-IFC); and the Sound-Induced Flash Illusion (SIFI). After 3 days of training, participants improved on the 2-IFC task, with a significant narrowing of the temporal window of integration (TWI) found for both groups. Generalization of training effects was not found, with no post-training differences in perceptual sensitivity to the SIFI for either group. These findings provide evidence perceptual narrowing can be achieved in older as well as younger adults after 3 days of perceptual training. These results provide useful information for future studies attempting to improve audio-visual temporal discrimination abilities in older people.","O’Brien, Jessica M.; Chan, Jason S.; Setti, Annalisa",Front Neurosci,420,5

As therapists who work with children, we have heard from parents who are desperate for support and advice about how to respond to their children’s behavioral changes, as well as those who feel too overwhelmed to continue their children’s sessions at the moment and want to take a break from treatment. We have had to rethink the frame in concrete ways, reimagine how to play, and renegotiate parameters around confidentiality. At a time when fear and uncertainty make mentalizing difficult, the hallmarks of a mentalizing approach—curiosity and flexibility—are most critical. This paper will describe how the Mentalization-Based Treatment for Children (MBT-C) model offers a framework for an integrative approach that can inform treatment via teletherapy, so that clinicians can continue supporting young people and their families through this period. We will begin by describing how the mentalizing stance, particularly an awareness of our own mentalizing capacities in the moment, has become more important than ever. Ways in which clinicians maintain their mentalizing in the face of the mentalizing breakdowns will be also discussed. Finally, we illustrate with clinical vignettes how the developmental levels of mentalizing—attention control, emotion regulation, and explicit mentalizing—can inform the structure, techniques and interventions in teletherapy with children and parents.","Bate, Jordan; Malberg, Norka",J Contemp Psychother,420,16

Children with COVID-19 differ from adults in that they are less often and less severely affected. Additional precautions required in the management of children address their increased radiosensitivity, need for accompanying carers, and methods for dealing with children in a mixed adult-paediatric institution. In this guidance document, our aim is to define a pragmatic strategy for imaging children with an emphasis on proven or suspected COVID-19 cases. Children suspected of COVID-19 should not be imaged routinely. Imaging should be performed only when expected to alter patient management, depending on symptoms, preexisting conditions and clinical evolution. In order to prevent disease transmission, it is important to manage the inpatient caseload effectively by triaging children and carers outside the hospital, re-scheduling nonurgent elective procedures and managing symptomatic children and carers as COVID-19 positive until proven otherwise. Within the imaging department one should consider conducting portable examinations with COVID-19 machines or arranging dedicated COVID-19 paediatric imaging sessions and performing routine nasopharyngeal swab testing before imaging under general anaesthesia. Finally, regular personal hygiene, appropriate usage of personal protective equipment, awareness of which procedures are considered aerosol generating and information on how to best disinfect imaging machinery after examinations should be highlighted to all staff members.

The new liability rules for copyright infringement are just an example of a more general tendency to charge intermediaries with responsibility. This tendency goes beyond the realm of intellectual property and includes consumer law, antitrust and competition law. The forthcoming EU Digital Services Act aims to revise the regulation of online intermediaries by means of new rules framing the responsibilities of digital services and online platforms’ market behaviour.

Herein, we describe the case of an immunocompetent COVID-19 patient with moderate symptoms who was twice re-tested as positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA, and the period between first and third viral RNA positivity was 95 days, longer than previously reported (18–25 days). The chest computed tomography findings, plasma anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody, neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) titer, and whole blood transcriptic characteristics in the viral RNA RP patient and other COVID-19 patients were analyzed. During the SARS-CoV-2 RNA RP period, new lung lesions were observed. The COVID-19 patient with viral RNA RP had delayed seroconversion of anti-spike/receptor-binding domain (RBD) IgA antibody and NAbs and were accompanied with disappearance of the lung lesions. Further experimental data validated that NAbs titer was significantly associated with anti-RBD IgA and IgG, and anti-spike IgG. The RP patient had lower interferon-, T cells- and B cell-related genes expression than non-RP patients with mild-to-moderate symptoms, and displayed lower cytokines and chemokines gene expression than severe patients. Interestingly, the RP patient had low expression of antigen presentation-related genes and low B cell counts which might have contributed to the delayed anti-RBD specific antibody and low CD8+ cell response. Collectively, delayed antigen presentation-related gene expression was found related to delayed adaptive immune response and contributed to the SARS-CoV-2 RNA RP in this described immunocompetent patient.","Lai, Changchun; Liu, Xinglong; Yan, Qihong; Lv, Hualiang; Zhou, Lei; Hu, Longbo; Cai, Yong; Wang, Guoqiang; Chen, Yufeng; Chai, Renjie; Liu, Zhenwei; Xu, Yuhua; Huang, Wendong; Xiao, Fei; Hu, Linhui; Li, Yaocai; Huang, Jianhong; Zhou, Qiang; Li, Luqian; Peng, Tao; Zhang, Haiye; Zhang, Zhenhui; Chen, Ling; Chen, Chunbo; Ji, Tianxing",Front Immunol,420,16

Children with epilepsy are challenging for teleconsultation as direct information from the patient is missing, regarding seizures and adverse effects, especially behavioral and psychological side effects. METHODS: Clinical and epilepsy-related details of telephonic consultations for children 1 month-18 years, performed between 26(th) March and 17(th) May 2020 in a tertiary care teaching hospital in Uttarakhand (a state of India known for hilly terrains with low per capita income) were recorded. Suitable changes in the dose/commercial brand of antiepileptic drug (AED) regimen were performed, along with the addition of new AED and referral to local practitioners for immediate hospitalization, when urgent health care issues were detected. Voice call, text message, picture/video message, and all other possible measures were employed to accumulate maximum clinical information in real-time. RESULTS: A total of 153 children(95 males [62%], 9.45 ± 3.24 years, 140 lower/middle socioeconomic status) were enrolled after screening 237 children with various neurological disorders, whose caregivers contacted for teleconsultation. A total of 278 telephone consultations performed for these 153 children (1-5 telephone calls per patient). Hundred-thirteen children were identified to have a total of 152 significant clinical events (breakthrough seizure/uncontrolled epilepsy (108), AED related (13), and unrelated systemic adverse effects (24), worsening of associated co-morbidities (7). In rest of the patients, the query of the caregiver included unavailability of AED/prescribed commercial brand in the locality, query related to the dose of drugs, proxy for a scheduled routine visit (no active issues), and concern regarding COVID-19 related symptoms and effect of COVID-19 and lockdown in children with epilepsy. Ninety-three (60%) patients required hiking up of AED dose, whereas 29 (17%) patients required the addition of a new AED/commercial brand. Five children were advised immediate admission to a nearby hospital. Overall, 147 (96%) caregivers were satisfied with the quality of medical advice. CONCLUSION: Teleconsultation is one of the few feasible options with good effectiveness for providing medical advice to children with epilepsy during pandemic times.","Panda, Prateek Kumar; Dawman, Lesa; Panda, Pragnya; Sharawat, Indar Kumar",Seizure,420,1

We have developed a computational technique that imparts both directionality and length constraints into searches for unique combinations of amino acids within protein sequences. Using statistical approaches, we have carried out searches of all possible two- and three-residue motifs contained within these databases. This technique is based on the unusually high occurrence of a small number of these motifs when compared to the expected probability of finding a specific residue grouping within a given database. Subsequent filtering of this search to identify such unique combinations has provided several examples that can be used as markers to identify particular proteins within or across databases. We focus on three of these motifs, which were found to be of greatest interest to us.

Weaned piglets, infected experimentally with transmissible gastroenteritis virus, a coronavirus that induces a diarrheal illness similar to human rotavirus infection, received methylprednisolone (30 mg/kg) or saline intramuscularly at 48 and 72 h after infection; noninfected littermate controls were similarly injected with methylprednisolone. Animals were killed at 96 h, at the height of diarrhea, and jejunal epithelium was studied in vitro. Transmissible gastroenteritis, as expected, induced structural, enzyme, and Na transport abnormalities. Methylprednisolone did not affect small intestinal structure or function of noninfected control piglets. In transmissible gastroenteritis-infected piglets, jejunal villi were longer and glucose-facilitated Na absorption was greater after methylprednisolone than after saline treatment. Increased glucose stimulation of Na flux in vitro in the methylprednisolone-treated infected group was not attributable to enhanced Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase activity and occurred despite persistence of the virus within mucosal cells, shown by immunofluorescense microscopy. In this piglet model of viral diarrhea, early regeneration of absorptive surface that precedes recovery of disaccharidase function is accelerated by glucocorticoid therapy.","Marc Rhoads, J; John Macleod, R; Richard Hamilton, J",Pediatr Res,420,17

Methods: Characteristics of psychiatric consultations, patients, and drug prescriptions were analyzed. Joinpoint models were used to identify changes in the weekly trend of consultations. Results: A 37.5% decrease in the number of consultations was seen during the lockdown period and 17.9% after the lockdown. The number of individual patients seen decreased by 34.9% during the lockdown and 11.2% after the lockdown. A significant change in the number of consultations from week 11 to week 18 occurred, followed by a gradual increase. There was a higher percentage of patients with previous psychiatric hospitalizations during the lockdown period (61.1 vs. 56.3%) and a lower percentage after the lockdown (59.7 vs. 64.7%). During the lockdown there was a large increase in psychiatric consultations for substance use disorders, whereas more consultations for manic episodes occurred after the lockdown. A 3.4% decrease was observed in consultations for suicidal ideation and planning during the lockdown, followed by an upward rebound after the lockdown, along with an increase in consultations for suicide attempts. During lockdown antipsychotic and benzodiazepine prescriptions increased by 5.2 and 4.1%, respectively. After the lockdown, the number of compulsory hospitalizations was higher than in 2019. Conclusions: We observed a decrease of psychiatric consultations during and after the lockdown. There was an increase in consultations for manic episodes and suicidality after the lockdown. The focus of psychiatric services must remain high particularly in this latter period.","Balestrieri, Matteo; Rucci, Paola; Amendola, Davide; Bonizzoni, Miki; Cerveri, Giancarlo; Colli, Chiara; Dragogna, Filippo; Ducci, Giuseppe; Elmo, Maria Giuseppa; Ghio, Lucio; Grasso, Federico; Locatelli, Clara; Mencacci, Claudio; Monaco, Leonardo; Nicotra, Alessandra; Piccinini, Giulia; Pischiutta, Livia; Toscano, Marco; Vaggi, Marco; Villari, Vincenzo; Vitalucci, Alberto; Castelpietra, Giulio; Bondi, Emi",Front Psychiatry,420,10

Highly efficient treatment options preventing morbidity and mortality are not broadly available and approved drugs are hardly affordable in developing countries. Even after vaccine approvals, it will take several months until the vaccinated and convalescent individuals establish herd immunity. Meanwhile, non-pharmaceutical interventions and antiviral treatments are indispensable to curb the death toll of the pandemic. To identify cost-effective and ubiquitously available options, we tested common herbs consumed worldwide as herbal teas. We found that aqueous infusions prepared by boiling leaves of the Lamiaceae plants perilla and sage elicit potent antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 in human cells. Sustained antiviral activity was evident even when cells were treated for only half an hour, and in therapeutic as well as prophylactic regimens. Given the urgency, such inexpensive and broadly available substances might provide help during the pandemic - especially in low-income regions.","Le-Trilling, Vu Thuy Khanh; Mennerich, Denise; Schuler, Corinna; Flores-Martinez, Yulia; Katschinski, Benjamin; Dittmer, Ulf; Trilling, Mirko",bioRxiv,420,3

HSR has brought impacts which have been widely studied in different countries in relation to the different socioeconomic, territorial and transport characteristics. This paper analyses the economic growth, the transport accessibility and the social impacts observed in Italy after ten years of HSR operation, as well as the estimated impacts of the system completion. The Italian case study is of particular interest since along the 1,467 km of new high speed line (300 km/h), a combination of major cities distances and a unique HSR competitive market, producing prices reductions and more daily trains, brought a 200% increase of HSR demand (from 15 to 45 millions of passengers/year). Estimations results show that, on average, HSR in Italy contributed to a significant increase in transport accessibility (+32%) for the zones along the HSR network, while only marginal for the others (+6%). Impacts on the economic growth show that HSR has contributed to an extra growth of per capita GDP of + 2.6% in 10 years and would have contributed to a further increase of 3.6% if the final project scenario (HSR_N) would had been completed by 2018. Regional (horizontal) equity impacts were evaluated in terms of the Gini indexes variations with respect to the distribution of the transport accessibility. It results that HSR in Italy has decreased equity in terms of users’ travel time accessibility of 11%, increasing the differences between the zones served by HSR and those not. If the HSR_N scenario would have been completed equity indices would have increased of 29% with respect to the pre-HSR 2008 scenario, thus reducing regional inequalities in the country. Results show that the HSR project was a country-level “game changer” in Italy, suggesting that the wider economic benefits, the assumptions on market regulation, the effects on regional disparities and the compensatory measures should be included in the ex ante and ex post evaluation of similar projects.","Cascetta, Ennio; Cartenì, Armando; Henke, Ilaria; Pagliara, Francesca",Transp Res Part A Policy Pract,420,16

Lombardy, region of the Northern Italy, has been the first area in the Western world whose organs and tissues procurement programs have had to face the virus pandemic emergency. We retrospectively collected and analyzed data about cardiovascular tissues (CT) in 2019 and in 2020. We aimed to describe the rapid evolution of SARS-CoV-2 regulation laws for tissue donor’s selection and harvesting from February 2020 until January 2021. As expected the number of CT donors in 2020 was significantly lower than those of 2019 (66 vs. 99, p value 0.02). The total number of CT collected from donors have been 254 in 2019 and 206 in 2020 (p 0.28). Femoral arteries were the most required vascular tissues (55.5% in 2019 and 40% in 2020).

Given that the envelope flow around a building is highly fluctuating, mean values could be insufficient to describe interunit dispersion. This study investigates the wind‐induced interunit dispersion around multistory buildings using the large eddy simulation (LES) method. This is the first time interunit dispersion has been investigated transiently using a LES model. The quality of the selected LES model is seriously assured through both experimental validation and sensitivity analyses. Two aspects are paid special attention: (i) comparison of dispersion routes with those provided by previous RANS simulations and (ii) comparison of timescales with those of natural ventilation and the survival times of pathogens. The LES results reveal larger dispersion scopes than the RANS results. Such larger scopes could be caused by the fluctuating and stochastic nature of envelope flows, which, however, is canceled out by the inherent Reynolds‐averaged treatment of RANS models. The timescales of interunit dispersion are comparable with those of natural ventilation. They are much shorter than the survival time of most pathogens under ordinary physical environments, indicating that interunit dispersion is a valid route for disease transmission.","Ai, Z.

However, the process of SARS-CoV-2 adsorption to exposed surfaces in high-risk environments remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the interfacial dynamics of single SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviruses with plasmonic imaging technology. Through the use of this technique, which has high spatial and temporal resolution, we tracked the collision of viruses at a surface and differentiated their stable adsorption and transient adsorption. We determined the effect of the electrostatic force on virus adhesion by correlating the solution and surface chemistry with the interfacial diffusion velocity and equilibrium position. Viral adsorption was found to be enhanced in real scenarios, such as in simulated saliva. This work not only describes a plasmonic imaging method to examine the interfacial dynamics of a single virus but also provides direct measurements of the factors that regulate the interfacial adsorption of SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus. Such information is valuable for understanding virus transport and environmental transmission and even for designing anticontamination surfaces.","Liu, Yi-Nan; Lv, Zhen-Ting; Yang, Si-Yu; Liu, Xian-Wei",Environ Sci Technol,420,31

There is little data regarding peri-procedural outcomes of medical procedures during the COVID-19 pandemic. We enacted protocols to safely reboot AF ablation while limiting healthcare resource utilization. We aimed to evaluate acute and subacute outcomes of protocols instituted for reboot of AF ablation during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Perioperative healthcare utilization and acute procedural outcomes were analyzed for consecutive patients undergoing AF ablation under COVID-19 protocols (2020 cohort; n=111) and compared to those of patients who underwent AF ablation during the same time period in 2019 (2019 cohort; n=200). Newly implemented practices included preoperative COVID-19 testing, selective transesophageal echocardiography (TEE), utilization of venous closure, and same-day discharge when clinically appropriate. RESULTS: Pre-ablation COVID-19 testing was positive in 1 of 111 patients. There were 0 cases ablation-related COVID-19 transmission and 0 major complications in either cohort. Pre-procedure TEE was performed in significantly fewer 2020 cohort patients compared to the 2019 cohort patients (68.4% vs. 97.5%, p <0.001, respectively) despite greater prevalence of persistent arrhythmia in the 2020 cohort. Same-day discharge was achieved in 68% of patients in the 2020 cohort, compared to 0% of patients in the 2019 cohort.

We describe and compare testing for SARS-CoV-2, test positivity and hospital admission, receipt of intensive care and mortality rates related to COVID-19 for people with a recent history of homelessness versus community-dwelling people as of July 31, 2020. METHODS: We conducted a population-based retrospective cohort study in Ontario, Canada, between Jan. 23 and July 31, 2020, using linked health administrative data among people who either had a recent history of homelessness or were dwelling in the community. People were included if they were eligible for provincial health care coverage and not living in an institutionalized facility on Jan. 23, 2020. We examined testing for SARS-CoV-2, test positivity and complication outcomes of COVID-19 (hospital admission, admission to intensive care and death) within 21 days of a positive test result. Extended multivariable Cox proportional hazard models were used to estimate adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) in 3 time periods: preshutdown (Jan. 23–Mar. 13), peak (Mar. 14–June 16) and reopening (June 17–July 31). RESULTS: People with a recent history of homelessness (n = 29 407) were more likely to be tested for SARS-CoV-2 in all 3 periods compared with community-dwelling people (n = 14 494 301) (preshutdown adjusted HR 1.61, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.22–2.11; peak adjusted HR 2.95, 95% CI 2.88–3.03; reopening adjusted HR 1.45, 95% CI 1.39–1.51). They were also more likely to have a positive test result (peak adjusted HR 3.66, 95% CI 3.22–4.16; reopening adjusted HR 1.76, 95% CI 1.15–2.71). In the peak period, people with a recent history of homelessness were over 20 times more likely to be admitted to hospital for COVID-19 (adjusted HR 20.35, 95% CI 16.23–25.53), over 10 times more likely to require intensive care for COVID-19 (adjusted HR 10.20, 95% CI 5.81–17.93) and over 5 times more likely to die within 21 days of their first positive test result (adjusted HR 5.73, 95% CI 3.01–10.91). INTERPRETATION: In Ontario, people with a recent history of homelessness were significantly more likely to be tested for SARS-CoV-2, to have a positive test result, to be admitted to hospital for COVID-19, to receive intensive care for COVID-19 and to die of COVID-19 compared with community-dwelling people. People with a recent history of homelessness should continue to be considered particularly vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 infection and its complications.","Richard, Lucie; Booth, Richard; Rayner, Jennifer; Clemens, Kristin K.; Forchuk, Cheryl; Shariff, Salimah Z.",CMAJ Open,420,0

We call this route self-burnout. We consider a region with (a) no influx of corona cases from the outside, (b) extensive social distancing, though not necessarily a full lockdown, and (c) high testing capacity relative to the actual number of new cases per day. These conditions can make it possible for the region to initiate the endgame phase of epidemic management, wherein the disease is slowly made to burn itself out through a combination of social distancing, sanitization, contact tracing and preventive testing. The dynamics of the case trajectories in this regime are governed by a single-variable first order linear delay differential equation, whose stability criterion can be obtained analytically. Basis this criterion, we conclude that the social mobility restrictions should be such as to ensure that on the average, one person interacts closely (from the transmission viewpoint) with at most one other person over a 4-5 day period. If the endgame can be played out for a long enough time, we claim that the Coronavirus can eventually get completely contained without affecting a significant fraction of the region's population. We present estimates of the duration for which the epidemic is expected to last, finding an interval of approximately 5-15 weeks after the self-burnout phase is initiated. South Korea, Austria, Australia, New Zealand and the states of Goa, Kerala and Odisha in India appear to be well on the way towards containing COVID by this method.","Shayak, B; Rand, Richard H",,420,17

With an unprecedented rate the different types of waste volume have up surged along with the COVID-19 contamination rate. As the situation has mandated people as well as the most infected persons to stay at home, the amount of generated hazardous waste is 3.40 kg that can be expected daily from each infected person. China and other countries have seen a massive increment in the hazardous waste generation (about 600% increase in Hubei province) amount. While dealing with this sudden increase in waste amount, the conventional incineration facilities have been outstripped and waste management industry is facing an immense pressure over handling hazardous waste generated from COVID-19 infected patients. Alongside with the hazardous waste volume, single-use plastic items and personal protective equipment (PPEs) have induced a new type of “PPE pollution” in the land and aquatic environment.

With the proposed approach, COVID-19 infection risks in 5 typical supermarkets and 21 small shops were evaluated. With one original infected early-shift staff, the average aerosols concentrations at steady-state are 1.06 × 10(−3) RNA copies/m(3) in the supermarkets and 4.73 × 10(−2) RNA copies/m(3) in the small shops. With the assumption of 5% original infected staff in the retail buildings, the infection probability of one customer is 1.40 × 10(−6) for visiting one small shop and 6.22 × 10(−6) for visiting one supermarket. The averaged infection risk in the supermarkets is higher than the small shops (p-value<0.001).

Currently, drugs originally developed for other viruses or parasites are currently in clinical trials based on empiric data. In the quest of an effective antiviral drug, the most specific target for an RNA virus is the RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase (RdRp) which shows significant differences between positive-sense and negative-sense RNA viruses. An accurate evaluation of RdRps from different viruses may guide the development of new drugs or the repositioning of already approved antiviral drugs as treatment of SARS-CoV-2.

In this study, a reliable and rapid sample preparation method was developed allowing identification of cultured respiratory viruses. Tenfold serial dilutions of ten cultures influenza A strains, mixed samples of influenza A virus with human metapneumovirus or respiratory syncytial virus, and reconstituted clinical samples were treated with the developed sample preparation method. Subsequently, peptides were subjected to MALDI-TOF MS and liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS).

However, the expressions of SARS-CoV-2 entry-related genes in aerodigestive cancers have not been fully elucidated. METHODS: In this study, the expressions of SARS-CoV-2 receptors and cofactors, including angiotensin I-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), basigin (BSG) and transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2), were comprehensively assessed. We compared BSG and TMPRSS2 expressions between aerodigestive cancers and matched normal tissues through Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis 2 (GEPIA2). Furthermore, expressions in healthy colon tissues at different anatomical locations were explored using the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) dataset. In addition, expressions among different tumor stages and the prognostic values were detected through GEPIA2. Moreover, the correlation between gene expression and immune infiltration was explored via Tumor Immune Estimation Resource (TIMER). Finally, expressions in primary colorectal cancer (CRC), lung metastasis and liver metastasis were investigated using the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) dataset GSE41258. RESULTS: Similar to ACE2, TMPRSS2 and BSG were also highly expressed in the digestive tracts. Intriguingly, BSG/TMPRSS2 expression in adjacent normal colon tissue or lung tissue was higher than that in corresponding healthy tissue, whereas they varied not among different tumor stages and correlated not with prognosis in aerodigestive cancers. Moreover, ACE2 was expressed at higher levels in lung metastases from CRC than in normal lung tissues. CONCLUSION: SARS-CoV-2 entry genes were highly expressed in CRC, and we reported for the first time higher expression of ACE2 in lung metastases from CRC than in normal lung, indicating that these patients may be more susceptible to extrapulmonary or pulmonary SARS-CoV-2 infection. Since our study is a bioinformatic analysis, further experimental evidences and clinical data are urgently needed.","He, Chaobin; Hua, Xin; Sun, Shuxin; Li, Shaolong; Wang, Jun; Huang, Xin",J Inflamm Res,420,12

Our study explored the distinct clinical features of COVID-19 patients with cancer. Experimental Design: 189 COVID-19 patients, including 16 cancer patients and 173 patients without cancer, were recruited. Propensity score 1:4 matching (PSM) was performed between cancer patients and patients without cancer based on age, gender and comorbidities. Survival was calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method and the difference was compared by the log-rank test. Results: PSM analysis yielded 16 cancer patients and 64 propensity score-matched patients without cancer. Compared to patients without cancer, cancer patients tended to have leukopenia and elevated high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) and procalcitonin. For those with critical COVID-19, cancer patients had an inferior survival than those without cancer. Also, cancer patients with severe/critical COVID-19 tended to be male and present with low S(P)O(2) and albumin, and high hs-CRP, lactate dehydrogenase and blood urea nitrogen on admission compared to those with mild COVID-19. In terms of risk factors, recent cancer diagnosis (within 1 year of onset of COVID-19) and anti-tumor treatment within 3 months of COVID-19 diagnosis were associated with inferior survival. Conclusions: We found COVID-19 patients with cancer have distinct clinical features as compared to patients without cancer. Importantly, cancer patients with critical COVID-19 were found to have poorer outcomes compared to those without cancer. In the cancer cohort, patients with severe/critical COVID-19 presented with a distinct clinical profile from those with mild COVID-19; short cancer history and recent anti-cancer treatment were associated with inferior survival.","Liu, Chao; Wang, Kai; Li, Luyuan; Lv, Qingquan; Liu, Yumei; Hu, Tian; Trent, Jonathan C.; Sun, Bing; Hu, Qinyong",J Cancer,420,1

Previous studies have investigated the risk of acute respiratory illness (ARI) after influenza vaccination with conflicting results. We assessed whether there is an increased rate of laboratory-confirmed ARI in post-influenza vaccination periods. METHODS: We conducted a cohort sub-analysis of children and adults in the MoSAIC community surveillance study from 2013 to 2016. Influenza vaccination was confirmed through city or hospital registries. Cases of ARI were ascertained by twice-weekly text messages to household to identify members with ARI symptoms. Nasal swabs were obtained from ill participants and analyzed for respiratory pathogens using multiplex PCR. The primary outcome measure was the hazard ratio of laboratory-confirmed ARI in individuals post-vaccination compared to other time periods during three influenza seasons. RESULTS: Of the 999 participants, 68.8% were children, 30.2% were adults. Each study season, approximately half received influenza vaccine and one third experienced ≥1 ARI. The hazard of influenza in individuals during the 14-day post-vaccination period was similar to unvaccinated individuals during the same period (HR 0.96, 95% CI [0.60, 1.52]). The hazard of non-influenza respiratory pathogens was higher during the same period (HR 1.65, 95% CI [1.14, 2.38]); when stratified by age the hazard remained higher for children (HR 1·71, 95% CI [1.16, 2.53]) but not for adults (HR 0.88, 95% CI [0.21, 3.69]). CONCLUSION: Among children there was an increase in the hazard of ARI caused by non-influenza respiratory pathogens post-influenza vaccination compared to unvaccinated children during the same period. Potential mechanisms for this association warrant further investigation. Future research could investigate whether medical decision-making surrounding influenza vaccination may be improved by acknowledging patient experiences, counseling regarding different types of ARI, and correcting the misperception that all ARI occurring after vaccination are caused by influenza.","Rikin, Sharon; Jia, Haomiao; Vargas, Celibell Y.; Castellanos de Belliard, Yaritza; Reed, Carrie; LaRussa, Philip; Larson, Elaine L.; Saiman, Lisa; Stockwell, Melissa S.",Vaccine,420,22

Unfortunately, the motorized Homo sapiens sapiens is not included and pays a price for it. Too often, drivers who simply follow other drivers are caught in the worst road threat after a crash: congestions. In the past, the solution to this problem has gone hand in hand with infrastructure investment. However, approaches such as the Nagoya Paradigm propose now to see congestion as the consequence of multiple interacting particles whose disturbances are transmitted in a waveform. This view clashes with a longlasting assumption ordering traffic flows, the rational driver postulate (i.e., drivers’ alleged propensity to maintain a safe distance). Rather than a mere coincidence, the worldwide adoption of the safety-distance tenet and the worldwide presence of congestion emerge now as cause and effect. Nevertheless, nothing in the drivers’ endowment impedes the adoption of other car-following (CF) strategies. The present study questions the a priori of safety-distance, comparing two elementary CF strategies, Driving to keep Distance (DD), that still prevails worldwide, and Driving to keep Inertia (DI), a complementary CF technique that offsets traffic waves disturbances, ensuring uninterrupted traffic flows. By asking drivers to drive DD and DI, we aim to characterize both CF strategies, comparing their effects on the individual driver (how he drives, how he feels, what he pays attention to) and also on the road space occupied by a platoon of DD robot-followers. METHODS: Thirty drivers (50% women) were invited to adopt DD/DI in a driving simulator following a swinging leader. The design was a repeated measures model controlling for order. The CF technique, DD or DI, was the within-subject factor. Order (DD-DI / DI-DD) was the between-subjects factor. There were four blocks of dependent measures: individual driving performance (accelerations, decelerations, crashes, distance to lead vehicle, speed and fuel consumption), emotional dimensions (measures of skin conductance and self-reports of affective states concerning valence, arousal, and dominance), and visual behavior (fixations count and average duration, dwell times, and revisits) concerning three regions of the driving scene (the Top Rear Car –TRC- or the Bottom Rear Car –BRC- of the leading vehicle and the surrounding White Space Area -WSA). The final block concerned the road space occupied by a platoon of 8 virtual DD followers. RESULTS: Drivers easily understood and applied DD/DI as required, switching back and forth between the two. Average speeds for DD/DI were similar, but DD drivers exhibited a greater number of accelerations, decelerations, speed variability, and crashes. Conversely, DI required greater CF distance, that was dynamically adjusted, and spent less fuel. Valence was similar, but DI drivers felt less aroused and more dominant. When driving DD visual scan was centered on the leader’s BRC, whereas DI elicited more attention to WSA (i.e., adopting wider vision angles). In spite of DI requiring more CF distance, the resulting road space occupied between the leader and the 8th DD robot was greater when driving DD.","Lucas-Alba, Antonio; Melchor, Óscar M.; Hernando, Ana; Fernández-Martín, Andrés; Blanch-Micó, Mª Teresa; Lombas, Andrés S.",Transp Res Part F Traffic Psychol Behav,420,5

BACKGROUND: Although long-term use of HCQ and AZT has been reported to cause QT prolongation and malign arrhythmia, there is not enough data about the effect of short-term use on arrhythmia. Purpose: The aim of this study was to assess the effect of HCQ alone and HCQ + AZT on corrected QT (QTc).Methods: A baseline ECG and on-treatment ECGs were retrospectively collected in COVID-19 patients who received HCQ and/or AZT. Also peak QTc intervals of monotherapy and combination therapy was compared. Results: Of the 155 patients included, 102 (65.8%) were using HCQ, 53 (34.2%) were using HCQ + AZT combination. The use of both HCQ alone and HCQ + AZT combined therapy significantly prolonged the QTc and the QTc interval was significantly longer in patients received combination therapy. QTc prolongation caused early termination in both groups, 5 (4.9%) patients in the monotherapy group and in 6 (11.3%) patients in the combined therapy group.Conclusion: Patients who received HCQ for COVID-19 were at high risk of QTc prolongation, and concurrent treatment with AZT was associated with greater changes in QTc.","Murat, B; Murat, S",Europace,420,16

Macrolides may be beneficial in settings where children have high rates of nasopharyngeal bacterial carriage and frequent prolonged illness. The aim of our double-blind placebo-controlled randomised trial was to determine if a large single dose of azithromycin (compared to placebo) reduced length of stay (LOS), duration of oxygen (O(2)) and respiratory readmissions within 6 months of children hospitalised with bronchiolitis. We also determined the effect of azithromycin on nasopharyngeal microbiology. METHODS: Children aged ≤18 months were randomised to receive a single large dose (30 mg/kg) of either azithromycin or placebo within 24 hrs of hospitalisation. Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected at baseline and 48hrs later. Primary endpoints (LOS, O(2)) were monitored every 12 hrs. Hospitalised respiratory readmissions 6-months post discharge was collected. RESULTS: 97 children were randomised (n = 50 azithromycin, n = 47 placebo). Median LOS was similar in both groups; azithromycin = 54 hours, placebo = 58 hours (difference between groups of 4 hours 95%CI -8, 13, p = 0.6). O(2) requirement was not significantly different between groups; Azithromycin = 35 hrs; placebo = 42 hrs (difference 7 hours, 95%CI -9, 13, p = 0.7). Number of children re-hospitalised was similar 10 per group (OR = 0.9, 95%CI 0.3, 2, p = 0.8). At least one virus was detected in 74% of children. The azithromycin group had reduced nasopharyngeal bacterial carriage (p = 0.01) but no difference in viral detection at 48 hours. CONCLUSION: Although a single dose of azithromycin reduces carriage of bacteria, it is unlikely to be beneficial in reducing LOS, duration of O(2) requirement or readmissions in children hospitalised with bronchiolitis. It remains uncertain if an earlier and/or longer duration of azithromycin improves clinical and microbiological outcomes for children.

How aberrant fibrinolysis influences the clinical progression of COVID-19 presents a clinicopathological dilemma challenging intensivists. METHODS: We performed meta-analysis and meta regression to analyze the associations of plasma D-dimer with 106 clinical variables to identify a panoramic view of the derangements of fibrinolysis in 14,862 patients of 42 studies. There were no limitations of age, gender, race, and country. Raw data of each group were extracted separately by two investigators. Individual data of case series, median and interquartile range, and ranges of median or mean were converted to SDM (standard deviation of mean). FINDINGS: The weighted mean difference of D-dimer was 0.97 µg/mL (95% CI 0.65, 1.29) between mild and severe groups, as shown by meta-analysis. Publication bias was significant. Meta-regression identified 58 of 106 clinical variables were associated with plasma D-dimer levels. Of these, 11 readouts were negatively related to the level of plasma D-dimer. Further, age and gender were confounding factors. There were 22 variables independently correlated with the D-dimer level, including respiratory rate, dyspnea plasma K(+), glucose, SpO2, BUN (blood urea nitrogen), bilirubin, ALT (alanine aminotransferase), AST (aspartate aminotransferase), systolic blood pressure, and CK (creatine kinase). INTERPRETATION: These findings support elevated D-dimer as an independent predictor for both mortality and complications. The identified D-dimer-associated clinical variables draw a landscape integrating the aggregate effects of systemically suppressive and pulmonary hyperactive derangements of fibrinolysis, and the D-dimer-associated clinical biomarkers, and conceptually parameters could be combined for risk stratification, potentially for tracking thrombolytic therapy or alternative interventions.","Zhao, Runzhen; Su, Zhenlei; Komissarov, Andrey A.; Liu, Shan-Lu; Yi, Guohua; Idell, Steven; Matthay, Michael A.; Ji, Hong-Long",Front Immunol,420,20

The performance analysis was conducted for two different purposes: (1) prediction of neutralization activity in MERS-CoV-infected patients, and (2) epidemiologic surveillance of MERS-CoV infections among MERS-CoV-exposed individuals. To evaluate performance according to serum collection time, we used ‘days post onset of illness (dpoi)’ and ‘days post exposure (dpex)’ assessing neutralization activity and infection diagnosis, respectively. Performance of serologic tests improved with delayed sampling time, being maximized after a seroconversion period. In predicting neutralization activity, ELISA IgG tests showed optimal performance using sera collected after 21 dpoi at cut-off values of OD ratio 0.4 (sensitivity 100% and specificity 100%), and ELISA IgA showed optimal performance using sera collected after 14 dpoi at cut-off value of OD ratio 0.2 (sensitivity 85.2% and specificity 100%).

Of those surveyed, 89% of HCWs had sufficient knowledge of COVID-19, more than 85% feared self-infection with the virus, and 89.7% followed correct practices regarding COVID-19. In addition to knowledge level, some risk factors including work experience and job category influenced HCWs’ attitudes and practice concerning COVID-19. Measures must be taken to protect HCWs from risks linked to job category, work experience, working hours, educational attainment, and frontline HCWs.","Zhou, Minghe; Tang, Fang; Wang, Yunjian; Nie, Hanxiao; Zhang, Luyang; You, Guohua; Zhang, Min",J Hosp Infect,420,24

The increased recognition of noroviruses as the cause of outbreaks and sporadic disease is due to the recent availability of improved norovirus-specific diagnostics. Transmission of these viruses is facilitated by their high prevalence in the community, shedding of infectious virus particles from asymptomatic individuals and the high stability of the virus in the environment. Currently, the spectrum of clinical disease and the understanding of host susceptibility factors are changing. Cases of chronic norovirus gastroenteritis have been observed in transplant recipients and unusual clinical presentations have been recognized in otherwise healthy adults that are under physical stress. Recently, noroviruses were found to bind to gut-expressed carbohydrates, leading to a correlation between a person's genetically determined carbohydrate expression and their susceptibility to Norwalk virus infection. Greater community surveillance and further investigation of carbohydrate receptor-binding properties could provide further insights into norovirus transmission, susceptibility and pathogenesis, and should aid in developing vaccines and antiviral therapies for this common viral disease.","Hutson, Anne M; Atmar, Robert L; Estes, Mary K",Trends Microbiol,420,1

Four antibodies were tested, and two of these,J.1.3 and J.3.9, were protective. Protection did not correlate with virus neutralization in vitro, antibody isotype, recognition of a unique El antigenic site, or dependence on complement in vivo. Survival from acute encephalitis was followed by subacute demyelination, as has been shown with protection mediated by neutralizing monoclonal antibodies against the major glycoprotein, E2. These results demonstrate that antibodies which are specific for a viral matrix protein are able to alter the course of disease.","Fleming, John O.; Shubin, Richard A.; Sussman, Mark A.; Casteel, Nancy; Stohlman, Stephen A.",Virology,420,20

To address this safety concern, we investigated whether use of remdesivir for COVID-19 is associated with an increased risk of bradycardia. METHODS: Using VigiBase®, the World Health Organization Global Individual Case Safety Reports database, we compared the cases of bradycardia reported in COVID-19 patients exposed to remdesivir with those reported in COVID-19 patients exposed to hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir, tocilizumab or glucocorticoids. All reports of patients with COVID-19 registered up to the 23(th) of September 2020 were included. We conducted disproportionality analyses allowing the estimation of reporting odds ratios (RORs) with 95% Confident Intervals (95% CI). RESULTS: We found 302 cardiac effects including 94 bradycardia (31%) among the 2,603 reports with remdesivir prescribed in COVID-19 patients. Most of reports were serious (75, 80%) and in 16 reports (17%) evolution was fatal. Compared with hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir, tocilizumab or glucocorticoids, the use of remdesivir was associated with an increased risk of reporting bradycardia (ROR 1.65; 95% CI 1.23, 2.22). Consistent results were observed in other sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSIONS: This post-marketing study in a real-world setting suggests that the use of remdesivir is significantly associated with an increased risk of reporting bradycardia and serious bradycardia when compared with the use of with hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir, tocilizumab or glucocorticoids. This result is in line with pharmacodynamic properties of the remdesivir.","Touafchia, Anthony; Bagheri, Haleh; Carrié, Didier; Durrieu, Geneviève; Sommet, Agnès; Montastruc, François",Clin Microbiol Infect,420,16

METHODS: Fifty-seven SPN patients and twenty-two hypo-NF-pNET patients were enrolled. Radiomics features were extracted from T1WI, arterial, portal and delayed phase of MR images. The enrolled patients were divided into training cohort and validation cohort with the 7:3 ratio. We built four radiomics signatures for the four phases respectively and ROC analysis were used to select the best phase to discriminate SPNs from hypo-NF-pNETs. The chosen radiomics signature and clinical independent risk factors were integrated to construct a clinic-radiomics nomogram. RESULTS: SPNs occurred in younger age groups than hypo-NF-pNETs (P < 0.0001) and showed a clear preponderance in females (P = 0.0185). Age was a significant independent factor for the differentiation of SPNs and hypo-NF-pNETs revealed by logistic regression analysis. With AUC values above 0.900 in both training and validation cohort (0.978 [95% CI, 0.942–1.000] in the training set, 0.907 [95% CI, 0.765–1.000] in the validation set), the radiomics signature of the arterial phase was picked to build a clinic-radiomics nomogram. The nomogram, composed by age and radiomics signature of the arterial phase, showed sufficient performance for discriminating SPNs and hypo-NF-pNETs with AUC values of 0.965 (95% CI, 0.923–1.000) and 0.920 (95% CI, 0.796–1.000) in the training and validation cohorts, respectively. Delong Test did not demonstrate statistical significance between the AUC of the clinic-radiomics nomogram and radiomics signature of arterial phase.

(2) Methods: Free-living thigh-worn accelerometry was recorded for three to seven days in 86 (women n = 55) community-dwelling older adults, on two occasions separated by one year, to evaluate the long-term consistency of free-living behavior. (3) Results: Year-to-year intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) for the number of STS transitions were 0.79 (95% confidence interval, 0.70-0.86, p < 0.001), for mean angular velocity-0.81 (95% ci, 0.72-0.87, p < 0.001), and maximal angular velocity-0.73 (95% ci, 0.61-0.82, p < 0.001), respectively. Day-to-day ICCs were 0.63-0.72 for number of STS transitions (95% ci, 0.49-0.81, p < 0.001) and for mean angular velocity-0.75-0.80 (95% ci, 0.64-0.87, p < 0.001). Minimum detectable change (MDC) was 20.1 transitions/day for volume, 9.7°/s for mean intensity, and 31.7°/s for maximal intensity. (4) Conclusions: The volume and intensity of STS transitions monitored by a thigh-worn accelerometer and a sit-to-stand transitions algorithm are reproducible from day to day and year to year. The accelerometer can be used to reliably study STS transitions in free-living environments, which could add value to identifying individuals at increased risk for functional disability.","Löppönen, Antti; Karavirta, Laura; Portegijs, Erja; Koivunen, Kaisa; Rantanen, Taina; Finni, Taija; Delecluse, Christophe; Roie, Evelien Van; Rantalainen, Timo",Sensors (Basel),420,20

There is apprehension on how to curb the spread and mitigate the socio-economic impacts of the pandemic, but timely and reliable daily confirmed cases' estimates are pertinent to the pandemic's containment. This study therefore conducted a situation assessment and applied simple predictive models to explore COVID-19 progression in Nigeria as at 31 May 2020. METHODS: Data used for this study were extracted from the websites of the European Centre for Disease Control (World Bank data) and Nigeria Centre for Disease Control. Besides descriptive statistics, four predictive models were fitted to investigate the pandemic natural dynamics. RESULTS: The case fatality rate of COVID-19 was 2.8%. A higher number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 was reported daily after the relaxation of lockdown than before and during lockdown. Of the 36 states in Nigeria, including the Federal Capital Territory, 35 have been affected with COVID-19. Most active cases were in Lagos (n = 4064; 59.2%), followed by Kano (n = 669; 9.2%). The percentage of COVID-19 recovery in Nigeria (29.5%) was lower compared to South Africa (50.3%), but higher compared to Kenya (24.1%). The cubic polynomial model had the best fit. The projected value for COVID-19 cumulative cases for 30 June 2020 in Nigeria was 27,993 (95% C.I: 27,001–28,986). CONCLUSION: The daily confirmed cases of COVID-19 are increasing in Nigeria. Increasing testing capacity for the disease may further reveal more confirmed cases.

There are several other clinical challenges for treatment of co-infected patients including: expense, pill burden, toxicity, and malabsorption that further necessitate the search for new drugs that may be effective against both pathogens simultaneously. The anti-helminthic niclosamide has been shown to have activity against a laboratory strain of Mtb in liquid culture while bacteriostatic activity against non-replicating M. abscessus was also recently described. Here we extend these findings to further demonstrate that niclosamide inhibits mycobacterial growth in infected human macrophages and mediates potent bacteriostatic activity against the virulent Mtb Beijing strain. Importantly, we provide the first evidence that niclosamide inhibits HIV replication in human macrophages and Jurkat T cells through post-integration effects on pro-virus transcription. The dual antiviral and anti-mycobacterial activity was further observed in an in vitro model of HIV and Mtb co-infection using human primary monocyte-derived macrophages. These results support further investigation of niclosamide and derivatives as anti-retroviral/anti-mycobacterial agents that may reduce clinical challenges associated with multi-drug regimens and drug resistance.","Fan, XiuZhen; Xu, Jimin; Files, Megan; Cirillo, Jeffrey D.; Endsley, Janice J.; Zhou, Jia; Endsley, Mark A.",Tuberculosis (Edinb),420,1

At the institutional level, the state has often implicitly reinforced, encouraged, and perpetuated this violence through bigoted rhetoric and exclusionary policies. COVID-19 has enabled the spread of racism and created national insecurity, fear of foreigners, and general xenophobia, which may be related to the increase in anti-Asian hate crimes during the pandemic.

We examine age-specific mortality trends and racial gaps in life expectancy in high- and low-income US areas and with reference to six European countries. Inequalities in life expectancy are starker in the United States than in Europe. In 1990, White Americans and Europeans in high-income areas had similar overall life expectancy, while life expectancy for White Americans in low-income areas was lower. However, since then, even high-income White Americans have lost ground relative to Europeans. Meanwhile, the gap in life expectancy between Black Americans and Europeans decreased by 8.3%. Black American life expectancy increased more than White American life expectancy in all US areas, but improvements in lower-income areas had the greatest impact on the racial life expectancy gap. The causes that contributed the most to Black Americans' mortality reductions included cancer, homicide, HIV, and causes originating in the fetal or infant period. Life expectancy for both Black and White Americans plateaued or slightly declined after 2012, but this stalling was most evident among Black Americans even prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. If improvements had continued at the 1990 to 2012 rate, the racial gap in life expectancy would have closed by 2036. European life expectancy also stalled after 2014.

METHODS: 1. Tblastx searches of SARS-CoV-2 are performed by limiting searches to five Plasmodium species that infect humans. 2. Aligned sequences in the respective organisms’ proteomes are searched with blastp. 3. Binding predictions of the identified SARS-CoV-2 peptide to HLA supertype representatives are performed. 4. Blastp searches of predicted epitopes that bind strongly to the identified HLA allele are performed by limiting searches to H. sapiens and Plasmodium species, separately. 5. Peptides with minimum 60% identity to the predicted epitopes are found in results. 6. Peptides among those, which bind strongly to the same HLA allele, are predicted. 7. Step-4 is repeated by limiting searches to H. sapiens, followed by the remaining steps until step-7, for peptides sourced by Plasmodium species after step-6. RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 peptide with single letter amino acid code CFLGYFCTCYFGLFC has the highest identity to P. vivax. Its YFCTCYFGLF part is predicted to bind strongly to HLA-A*24:02. Peptides in the human proteome both homologous to YFCTCYFGLF and with a strong binding affinity to HLA-A*24:02 are YYCARRFGLF, YYCHCPFGVF, and YYCQQYFFLF. Such peptides in the Plasmodium species’ proteomes are FFYTFYFELF, YFVACLFILF, and YFPTITFHLF. The first one belonging to P. falciparum has a homologous peptide (YFYLFSLELF) in the human proteome, which also has a strong binding affinity to the same HLA allele. CONCLUSION: Immune responses to the identified-peptides with similar sequences and strong binding affinities to HLA-A*24:02 can be related to autoimmune response risk in individuals with HLA-A*24:02 serotypes, upon getting infected with SARS-CoV-2 or P. falciparum.","Adiguzel, Yekbun",Acta Trop,420,28

Conventional testing for SARS-CoV-2 involves collection of a clinical specimen with a nasopharyngeal swab, storage of the swab during transport in universal transport medium (UTM), extraction of RNA, and quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR). As testing has scaled across the world, supply chain challenges have emerged across this entire workflow. Here we sought to evaluate how eliminating the UTM storage and RNA extraction steps would impact the results of molecular testing. Using paired mid-turbinate swabs self-collected by 11 individuals with previously established SARS-CoV-2 positivity, we performed a comparison of conventional (swab → UTM → RNA extraction → RT-qPCR) vs. simplified (direct elution from dry swab → RT-qPCR) protocols. Our results suggest that dry swabs eluted directly into a simple buffered solution (TE) can support molecular detection of SARS-CoV-2 via endpoint RT-qPCR without substantially compromising sensitivity. Although further confirmation with a larger sample size and variation of other parameters is necessary, these results are encouraging for the possibility of a simplified workflow that could support massively scaled testing for COVID-19 control.","Srivatsan, Sanjay; Han, Peter D.; van Raay, Katrina; Wolf, Caitlin R.; McCulloch, Denise J.; Kim, Ashley E.; Brandstetter, Elisabeth; Martin, Beth; Gehring, Jase; Chen, Wei; Kosuri, Sriram; Konnick, Eric Q.; Lockwood, Christina M.; Rieder, Mark J.; Nickerson, Deborah A.; Chu, Helen Y.; Shendure, Jay; Starita, Lea M.",bioRxiv,420,20

In the present study, we investigated the different microbiota from the cecal mucosa and cecal contents between healthy and PEDV-infected piglets. High-throughput 16S rRNA gene sequencing was performed to explore differences. The results revealed that microbial dysbiosis by PEDV infection occurred in the cecal mucosa and contents of suckling piglets at each microbial taxonomic level. The abundance of pathogenic bacteria associated with diseases, including diarrhea, was increased. The abundance of Fusobacterium was 26.71% and 33.91% in cecal mucosa and contents of PEDV-infected group, respectively, whereas that in the healthy groups was 17.85% and 9.88%. The proportion of Proteobacteria in the infected groups was relatively high (24.67% and 22.79%, respectively), whereas that in the healthy group was 13.13% and 11.34% in the cecal mucosa and contents, respectively. Additionally, the proportion of Bacteroidetes in the healthy group (29.89%, 37.32%) was approximately twice that of the PEDV-infected group (15.50%, 15.39%). “Nitrate reduction”, “Human pathogens diarrhea”, “Human pathogens gastroenteritis”, “Nitrite respiration”, and “Nitrite ammonification” were the enriched functional annotation terms in the PEDV-infected groups. Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus infection increased the proportion of harmful bacteria and decreased the proportion of beneficial bacteria in the cecal mucosa and contents of suckling piglets. Our findings suggest that determining the intestinal microbiota might provide a promising method to prevent PEDV and open a new avenue for future research.","Tan, Zhen; Dong, Wanting; Ding, Yaqun; Ding, Xiangdong; Zhang, Qin; Jiang, Li",PLoS One,420,20

Understanding and monitoring the genetic evolution of the virus, its geographical characteristics, and its stability are particularly important for controlling the spread of the disease and especially for the development of a universal vaccine covering all circulating strains. From this perspective, we analyzed 30,983 complete SARS-CoV-2 genomes from 79 countries located in the six continents and collected from 24 December 2019, to 13 May 2020, according to the GISAID database. Our analysis revealed the presence of 3206 variant sites, with a uniform distribution of mutation types in different geographic areas. Remarkably, a low frequency of recurrent mutations has been observed; only 169 mutations (5.27%) had a prevalence greater than 1% of genomes. Nevertheless, fourteen non-synonymous hotspot mutations (>10%) have been identified at different locations along the viral genome; eight in ORF1ab polyprotein (in nsp2, nsp3, transmembrane domain, RdRp, helicase, exonuclease, and endoribonuclease), three in nucleocapsid protein, and one in each of three proteins: Spike, ORF3a, and ORF8. Moreover, 36 non-synonymous mutations were identified in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein with a low prevalence (<1%) across all genomes, of which only four could potentially enhance the binding of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein to the human ACE2 receptor. These results along with intra-genomic divergence of SARS-CoV-2 could indicate that unlike the influenza virus or HIV viruses, SARS-CoV-2 has a low mutation rate which makes the development of an effective global vaccine very likely.","Alouane, Tarek; Laamarti, Meriem; Essabbar, Abdelomunim; Hakmi, Mohammed; Bouricha, El Mehdi; Chemao-Elfihri, M.

It has long been recognized that infections may serve as environmental triggers for the disease, and a large number of pathogens have been proposed to be associated with multiple sclerosis. Here, we detail the historical basis linking infections to multiple sclerosis and review the epidemiology of the disease, which suggests a possible relationship with infectious agents. We also describe pathophysiologic studies in animals and other human demyelinating diseases that have demonstrated a variety of mechanisms by which infectious agents may induce chronic, relapsing central nervous system disease with myelin damage and relative preservation of axons, similar to multiple sclerosis. In addition, we discuss recent studies in individuals with multiple sclerosis indicating enhanced immune responses to infectious antigens, though not consistently demonstrating evidence for ongoing infection. Taken together, these studies suggest a role for infectious agents in the development of multiple sclerosis. Conclusive evidence, however, remains lacking.","Venkatesan, Arun; Johnson, Richard T.",Handb Clin Neurol,420,19

In this study, infection kinetics (titres and antigen expression) of FIPV 79-1146, and FECV 79-1683, were determined in peripheral blood monocytes from 3 donor cats and compared to those in Crandell feline kidney (CrFK) cells. The infection kinetics in monocytes were host dependent. Monocytes from 1 cat were resistant to both FIPV- and FECV-infection. Monocytes from the other 2 cats could initially be infected by both FIPV and FECV but FIPV infection was sustained in monocytes of only one cat. FECV-infection was never sustained and viral production was up to 100 times lower than in FIPV-infected monocytes. In CrFK cells, FIPV and FECV infection kinetics did not differ. In monocytes of a larger cat population (n = 19) the 3 infection patterns were also found. Considering all 22 investigated cats, 3/22 were not susceptible for FIPV and FECV.

The study presented in this article investigated the preparedness of academics in Small Island Developing State (SIDS) universities for shifting to emergency online teaching. To examine the impact of preparedness and other factors on the efficacy of academic staff in performing their work duties during the pandemic, the research team collected data from 75 respondents who filled in a questionnaire. In addition, they conducted semi-structured online interviews with a subsample of 5 respondents. They found that most academics had the necessary tools and infrastructure to teach online, including access to reasonably fast internet connections. However, many of them lacked adequate training in applying the use of technology to teaching, which limited their preparedness for developing e-learning activities. Thus, the study found that, insufficient competence in using educational technologies and inadequate university support impacted academics’ work efficacy significantly. This impact was less pronounced for staff who had prior online teaching experience, which suggests that their pre-pandemic experiences lessened their dependence on support for online teaching when the sudden need arose. The authors’ thematic analysis similarly found academics’ uneven familiarity with technology and the need for more “at-the-elbow” technological support during crises to be significant, as well as a need for more leadership to deal with complex situations. Based on their findings, the authors conclude that greater preparedness for online teaching – and thus improved efficacy – might be achieved through a balanced mix of independent learning (by doing) on the part of academic staff and customised and targeted formal professional learning (through training provided by the university).","Seetal, Isma; Gunness, Sandhya; Teeroovengadum, Viraiyan",Int Rev Educ,420,18

Understanding the district level correlates of the COVID-19 infection ratio (IR) is essential for formulating policies and intervention. Objectives The present study examines the association between socioeconomic and demographic characteristics of India's population and the COVID-19 infection ratio at the district level. Data and Methods Using crowdsourced data on the COVID-19 prevalence rate, we analyzed state and district level variation in India from March 14 to July 31, 2020. We identified hotspot and cold spot districts for COVID-19 cases and infection ratio. We have also carried out a regression analysis to highlight the district level demographic, socioeconomic, infrastructure, and health-related correlates of the COVID-19 infection ratio. Results The results showed that the IR is 42.38 per one hundred thousand population in India. The highest IR was observed in Andhra Pradesh (145.0), followed by Maharashtra (123.6), and was the lowest in Chhattisgarh (10.1). About 80 percent of infected cases and 90 percent of deaths were observed in nine Indian states (Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, and Gujarat). Moreover, we observed COVID-19 cold-spots in central, northern, western, and north-eastern regions of India. Out of 736 districts, six metropolitan cities (Mumbai, Chennai, Thane, Pune, Bengaluru, and Hyderabad) emerged as the major hotspots in India, containing around 30 percent of confirmed total COVID-19 cases in the country. Simultaneously, parts of the Konkan coast in Maharashtra, part of Delhi, the southern part of Tamil Nadu, the northern part of Jammu & Kashmir were identified as hotspots of COVID-19 infection. Moran's- I value of 0.333showed a positive spatial clustering level in the COVID-19 IR case over neighboring districts. Our regression analysis found that district-level population density ({beta}: 0.05, CI:004-0.06), the percent of urban population ({beta}:3.08, CI: 1.05-5.11), percent of Scheduled Caste Population ({beta}: 3.92, CI: 0.12-7.72),and district-level testing ratio ({beta}: 0.03, CI: 0.01-0.04) are positively associated with the prevalence of COVID-19. Conclusion COVID-19 cases were heavily concentrated in 9 states of India. Several demographic, socioeconomic, and health-related variables are correlated with the COVID-19 prevalence rate. However, after adjusting the role of socioeconomic and health-related factors, the COVID-19 infection rate was found to be more rampant in districts with a higher population density, a higher percentage of the urban population, and a higher percentage of deprived castes and with a higher level of testing ratio. The identified hotspots and correlates in this study give crucial information for policy discourse.

This information is needed to clarify transmission risks beyond close contact. METHODS: We deployed particulate air samplers in rooms with COVID-19 positive patients in hospital ward and ICU rooms, rooms in long-term care homes experiencing outbreaks, and a correctional facility experiencing an outbreak. Samplers were placed between 2 and 3 meters from the patient. Aerosol (small liquid particles suspended in air) samples were collected onto gelatin filters by Ultrasonic Personal Air Samplers (UPAS) fitted with <2.5μm (micrometer) and <10 μm size-selective inlets operated for 16 hours (total 1.92m(3)), and with a Coriolis Biosampler over 10 minutes (total 1.5m(3)). Samples were assayed for viable SARS-CoV-2 virus and for the viral genome by multiplex PCR using the E and N protein target sequences. We validated the sampling methods by inoculating gelatin filters with viable vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), and with three concentrations of viable SARS-CoV-2, operating personal samplers for 16hrs, and quantifying viable virus recovery by TCID(50) assay. RESULTS: In total, 138 samples were collected from 99 rooms. RNA samples were positive in 9.1% (6/66) of samples obtained with the UPAS 2.5μm samplers, 13.5% (7/52) with the UPAS 10μm samplers, and 10.0% (2/20) samples obtained with the Coriolis samplers. Culturable virus was not recovered in any samples. Viral RNA was detected in 15.1% of the rooms sampled. There was no significant difference in viral RNA recovery between the different room locations or samplers.

Currently the only role for therapy is treatment of the disease, as opposed to post-exposure prophylaxis, however multiple clinical trials are currently ongoing for both treatment and prophylaxis. Treating COVID-19 relies on two components; the first is inhibition of the viral entrance and replication within the body and the second is inhibition of an exacerbated immune response which can be seen in patients with severe disease. Many drugs have shown in vitro antiviral activity, however clinical trials have not been as promising. Remdesivir has shown a shortening in the time to recovery in hospitalized adults, however currently no mortality benefit demonstrated. Dexamethasone has shown improved mortality in patients requiring respiratory support, but not otherwise. Current research is ongoing in immunomodulation with monoclonal antibodies including interleukin (IL)-6 receptor antagonists and Janus Kinase (JAK) inhibitors.

Outcome measures included life satisfaction, wellbeing (subjective and psychological wellbeing), stress, depression and anxiety symptoms, and self-compassion. The potential moderating effect of participating during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic was also explored. The intervention group showed greater improvements in life satisfaction by week six (β = 0.18, p = .014) and were maintained through to 7 weeks post-baseline (β = 0.23, t = 3.07, p = .002) and remained significant when accounting for COVID-19 restrictions.

A subpopulation of abundant erythroid cells, CD45+CD71+cells, co-express ACE2, TMPRSS2, CD147, CD26 and these can be infected with SARS-CoV-2. In turn, pre-treatment of erythroid cells with dexamethasone significantly diminished ACE2/TMPRSS2 expression and subsequently reduced their infectivity with SARS-CoV-2. Taken together, pathological abundance of erythroid cells might reflect stress erythropoiesis due to the invasion of erythroid progenitors by SARS-CoV-2. This may provide a novel insight into the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on erythropoiesis and hypoxia seen in COVID-19 patients.","Shahbaz, Shima; Xu, Lai; Osman, Mohammad; Sligl, Wendy; Shields, Justin; Joyce, Michael; Tyrrell, Lorne; Oyegbami, Olaide; Elahi, Shokrollah",bioRxiv,420,28
