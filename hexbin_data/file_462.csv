3183,3183,3183,Clinical study of children with cryofibrinogenemia: a retrospective study from a single center,16.516743,9.007089,2018-04-24,"BACKGROUND: This study aimed to evaluate the demographic, clinical features, laboratory data, pathology and other survey in pediatric patients with cryofibrinogenemia. METHODS: A 12-year retrospective chart review identified eight pediatric patients at Mackay Memorial Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan. RESULTS: The female-to-male ratio was 3:1. The mean age at symptom onset and of diagnosis was 10.3 ± 4.6 years and 12.3 ± 4 years, respectively. One child (12.5%) had primary cryofibrinogenemia. The common symptoms were purpura, arthralgia, and muscle weakness (100%). On laboratory examination, cryofibrinogen was positive in all patients. All patients had increased anti-thrombin III while 87.5% and 62.5% had abnormal protein S and protein C, respectively. All eight also complained of neurologic symptoms. One had vertebral artery narrowing, two showed increased T2-weighted signal intensity on the thalamus or white matter, and one had acute hemorrhagic encephalomyelitis on brain magnetic resonance imaging. CONCLUSIONS: This study reports on the presentations of cryofibrinogenemia, which is rare in children. Most cases are associated with autoimmune disease and have severe and complex presentations. Central nervous system involvement is common.","Chou, Hsiao-Feng; Wu, Yu-Hung; Ho, Che-Sheng; Kao, Yu-Hsuan",Pediatr Rheumatol Online J,462,1

Between 1980 and 1988, 29 episodes of streptococcal septicaemia occurred in 139 treatment events. All patients received as prophylaxis regimen ciprofloxacin (n=38) or a combination of polymyxin B with nalidixic acid (n=42) or neomycin (n=59). Six patients died of streptococcal septicaemia despite adequate antibiotic treatment. The high incidence of streptococcal septicaemia lead to the administration of penicillin G in addition to ciprofloxacin as prophylaxis regimen during the 14 days immediately following cytotoxic chemotherapy. Only two episodes of streptococcal septicaemia were documented after addition of penicillin G to the prophylaxis regimen (n=76, p<0.001). Both patients had an uneventful recovery after treatment with vancomycin. Patients receiving penicillin G prophylaxis experienced fever during 17 % of the time and received antimicrobial therapy during 20 % of the time per treatment event compared with 27 % and 32 % respectively of this time in patients receiving no streptococcal prophylaxis (p<0.001). Penicillin G prophylaxis was associated with an increased incidence of fever of unknown origin and more frequent isolation of aerobic gram-negative bacteria in surveillance cultures. Penicillin G in combination with ciprofloxacin proved to be highly successful in preventing infections caused by streptococci and in reducing infection-related mortality and morbidity.","de Jong, P.; de Jong, M.; Kuijper, E.; van der Lelie, J.",Eur J Clin Microbiol Infect Dis,462,1

Understanding the genetic diversity of pfmsp-3 is important for recognizing genetic nature and evolutionary aspect of the gene in the natural P. falciparum population and for designing an effective vaccine based on the antigen. METHODS: Blood samples collected from P. falciparum-infected patients in Naung Cho and Pyin Oo Lwin, Myanmar, in 2015 were used in this study. The pfmsp-3 was amplified by polymerase chain reaction, cloned, and sequenced. Genetic polymorphism and natural selection of Myanmar pfmsp-3 were analysed using the programs DNASTAR, MEGA6, and DnaSP 5.10.00. Genetic diversity and natural selection of the global pfmsp-3 were also comparatively analysed. RESULTS: Myanmar pfmsp-3 displayed 2 different alleles, 3D7 and K1. The 3D7 allelic type was predominant in the population, but genetic polymorphism was less diverse than for the K1 allelic type. Polymorphic characters in both allelic types were caused by amino acid substitutions, insertions, and deletions. Amino acid substitutions were mainly occurred at the alanine heptad repeat domains, whereas most insertions and deletions were found at the glutamate rich domain. Overall patterns of amino acid polymorphisms detected in Myanmar pfmsp-3 were similar in the global pfmsp-3 population, but novel amino acid changes were observed in Myanmar pfmsp-3 with low frequencies. Complicated patterns of natural selection and recombination events were predicted in the global pfmsp-3, which may act as major driving forces to maintain and generate genetic diversity of the global pfmsp-3 population. CONCLUSION: Global pfmsp-3 revealed genetic polymorphisms, suggesting that the functional and structural consequences of the polymorphisms should be considered in designing a vaccine based on PfMSP-3. Further examination of genetic diversity of pfmsp-3 in the global P. falciparum population is necessary to gain in-depth insight for the population structure and evolutionary aspect of global pfmsp-3.","Lê, Hương Giang; Thái, Thị Lam; Kang, Jung-Mi; Lee, Jinyoung; Moe, Mya; Võ, Tuấn Cường; Naw, Haung; Myint, Moe Kyaw; Htun, Zaw Than; Kim, Tong-Soo; Shin, Ho-Joon; Na, Byoung-Kuk",Malar J,462,1

We retrospectively analyzed the age, common clinical symptoms, immunologic and molecular manifestations in 11 patients with LOF STAT3 mutations and 1 patient with a GOF STAT3 mutation. METHODS: Twelve patients were enrolled in our study. Serum immunoglobulin measurements, lymphocyte subset detection and whole-exome sequencing were performed. RESULTS: The median age at diagnosis of STAT3-HIES patients was 4.74 years. Eczema, recurrent respiratory infections, fevers, abscesses and Staphylococcus aureus infections were the classic manifestations. Elevated serum IgE levels are not always observed in conjunction with high eosinophil counts. A moderate viral DNA load was also measured in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. We noticed that c. 1144C>T was the most common mutation site, followed by c.1311C>A. Additionally, c.1311C>A and c. 1826G>C are two novel mutations. Eight patients achieved notable improvement after receiving intravenous immunoglobulin. CONCLUSION: We updated the current knowledge of this topic. We found an earlier median age at diagnosis, a higher survival rate, and a general lack of nonimmunological abnormalities; we also described the treatment details and novel mutations involve in STAT3-HIES and compared STAT3 LOF and GOF mutations.","Lin, Li; Wang, Ying; Sun, Bijun; Liu, Luyao; Ying, Wenjing; Wang, Wenjie; Zhou, Qinhua; Hou, Jia; Yao, Haili; Hu, Liyuan; Sun, Jinqiao; Wang, Xiaochuan",Allergy Asthma Clin Immunol,462,27

We now report segregation of this variant in five probands from the initial clinical report defining the syndrome and an additional family of Puerto Rican descent with multiple affected adult individuals. We modeled the orthologous variant in murine Col27a1 and found it recapitulates some of the major Steel syndrome associated skeletal features including reduced body length, scoliosis, and a more rounded skull shape. Characterization of the in vivo murine model shows abnormal collagen deposition in the extracellular matrix and disorganization of the proliferative zone of the growth plate. We report additional COL27A1 pathogenic variant alleles identified in unrelated consanguineous Turkish kindreds suggesting Clan Genomics and identity-by-descent homozygosity contributing to disease in this population. The hypothesis that carrier states for this autosomal recessive osteochondrodysplasia may contribute to common complex traits is further explored in a large clinical population cohort.

Because of security and privacy concerns, Congress, in 1998, prevented the government from promulgating a unique patient identifier. The Health and Human Services funding bill that was enacted in 2019 requires that Health and Human Services report their recommendations on patient identification to Congress. While there are anecdotes of incomplete health care data due to patient misidentification, to date there have been insufficient large-scale analyses measuring improvements to patient care that a unique patient identifier might provide. This lack of measurement has made it difficult for policymakers to balance security and privacy concerns against the value of potential improvements. OBJECTIVE: We sought to determine the frequency of serious drug-drug interaction alerts discovered because a pharmacy benefits manager uses a universal patient identifier and estimate undiscovered serious drug-drug interactions because pharmacy benefit managers do not yet fully share patient records. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study of serious drug-drug interaction alerts provided from September 1, 2016 to August 31, 2019 to retail pharmacies by a national pharmacy benefit manager that uses a unique patient identifier. We compared each alert to the contributing prescription and determined whether the unique patient identifier was necessary in order to identify the crossover alert. We classified each alert’s disposition as override, abandonment, or replacement. Using the crossover alert rate and sample population size, we inferred a rate of missing serious drug-drug interaction alerts for the United States. We performed logistic regression in order to identify factors correlated with crossover and alert outcomes. RESULTS: Among a population of 49.7 million patients, 242,646 serious drug-drug interaction alerts occurred in 3 years. Of these, 2388 (1.0%) crossed insurance and were discovered because the pharmacy benefit manager used a unique patient identifier. We estimate that up to 10% of serious drug-drug alerts in the United States go undetected by pharmacy benefit managers because of unexchanged information or pharmacy benefit managers that do not use a unique patient identifier. These information gaps may contribute, annually, to up to 6000 patients in the United States receiving a contraindicated medication. CONCLUSIONS: Comprehensive patient identification across disparate data sources can help protect patients from serious drug-drug interactions. To better safeguard patients, providers should (1) adopt a comprehensive patient identification strategy and (2) share patient prescription history to improve clinical decision support.","Sragow, Howard Michael; Bidell, Eileen; Mager, Douglas; Grannis, Shaun",JMIR Med Inform,462,1
14433,14433,14433,Project OPUS: Development and evaluation of an electronic platform for pain management education of medical undergraduates in resource-limited settings,16.730114,6.8385606,2020-12-10,"BACKGROUND: Chronic pain is a significant risk factor for suicidal ideation (SI) and suicidal behavior (SB), including a 20%-40% prevalence rate of SI, a prevalence between 5% and 14% of suicide attempts, and a doubled risk of death by suicide in patients with chronic pain compared to controls. In most studies, associations between chronic pain and suicidality are robust, even after adjusting for the effect of sociodemographics and psychiatric comorbidity, and particularly for depressive conditions. A number of specific conditions that can modulate suicidality risk in patients with chronic pain have been investigated, but there is a need for their more specific characterization. Numerous recent studies have shown that demoralization and meaning in life (MiL) constructs affect suicidality as risk and protective factors, respectively. These constructs have been mainly investigated in patients with somatic illness and in community-dwelling individuals who may present with SI or SB independently of a psychiatric diagnosis of depression. However, a paucity of studies investigated them in suicidal patients affected by chronic pain. OBJECTIVE: The primary objective of this project is to investigate the relationship between demoralization and MiL on SI risk in patients with chronic pain. The secondary objectives are (1) to test whether demoralization can occur independently of depression in patients with chronic pain and SI, (2) to examine whether the expected association between demoralization and SI may be explained by a sole dimension of demoralization: hopelessness, (3) to examine whether the presence of MiL, but not the search for MiL, is associated with less SI, and (4) to explore whether previously described MiL profiles (ie, high presence-high search, high presence-low search, moderate presence-moderate search, low presence-low search, and low presence-high search) emerge in our cohort. METHODS: This project is a single-center, observational, case-control study—the Demoralization and Meaning in Life (DEMiL) study—conducted by the Division of Clinical Pharmacology and Toxicology, the Multidisciplinary Pain Centre, and the Service of Liaison Psychiatry and Crisis Intervention at the Geneva University Hospitals. Self- and hetero-administered questionnaires were conducted among patients and controls, matched by age and gender. The Ethics Committee of the Canton of Geneva approved the scientific utilization of collected data (project No. 2017-02138; decision dated January 25, 2018). Data have been analyzed with SPSS, version 23.0, software (IBM Corp). RESULTS: From March 1, 2018, to November 30, 2019, 70 patients and 70 controls were enrolled. Statistical analyses are still in progress and are expected to be finalized in November 2020. To date, we did not observe any unfavorable event for which a causal relationship with the collection of health-related personal data could be ruled out. Results of this study are expected to form the basis for possible prevention and psychotherapeutic interventions oriented toward demoralization and MiL constructs for suicidal patients with chronic pain. CONCLUSIONS: The interest in exploring demoralization and MiL in chronic pain patients with SI arises from the common clinical observation that experiencing chronic pain often requires a revision of one’s life goals and expectations. Hence, the impact of chronic pain is not limited to patients’ biopsychosocial functioning, but it affects the existential domain as well. The major clinical implications in suicidal patients with chronic pain consist in trying to (1) delineate a more precise and individualized suicide risk profile, (2) improve detection and prevention strategies by investigating SI also in individuals who do not present with a clinically diagnosed depression, and (3) enhance the panel of interventions by broadening supportive or psychotherapeutic actions, taking into consideration the existential condition of a person who suffers and strives to deal with his or her suffering.

However, data regarding the clinical resolution of loss of smell and/or taste are lacking. In this study we assess smell and taste loss resolution at 4–6 week follow-up, aim to identify risk factors for persistent smell loss and describe smell loss as a feature of long-COVID in a community cohort in London with known SARS-CoV-2 IgG/IgM antibody status. We also compare subjective and objective smell assessments in a subset of participants. METHODS: Four hundred sixty-seven participants with acute loss of smell and/or taste who had undergone SARS-CoV-2 IgG/IgM antibody testing 4–6 weeks earlier completed a follow-up questionnaire about resolution of their symptoms. A subsample of 50 participants completed an objective olfactory test and results were compared to subjective smell evaluations. RESULTS: People with SARS-CoV-2 antibodies with an acute loss of sense of smell and taste were significantly less likely to recover their sense of smell/taste than people who were seronegative (smell recovery: 57.7% vs. 72.1%, p = 0.027. taste recovery 66.2% vs. 80.3%, p = 0.017). In SARS-CoV-2 positive participants, a higher percentage of male participants reported full resolution of smell loss (72.8% vs. 51.4%; p < 0.001) compared to female participants, who were almost 2.5-times more likely to have ongoing smell loss after 4–6 weeks (OR 2.46, 95%CI 1.47–4.13, p = 0.001). Female participants with SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and unresolved smell loss and unresolved taste loss were significantly older (> 40 years) than those who reported full resolution. Participants who experienced parosmia reported lower smell recovery rates and participants with distorted taste perception lower taste recovery rates. Parosmia had a significant association to unresolved smell loss (OR 2.47, 95%CI 1.54–4.00, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Although smell and/or taste loss are often transient manifestations of COVID-19, 42% of participants had ongoing loss of smell, 34% loss of taste and 36% loss of smell and taste at 4–6 weeks follow-up, which constitute symptoms of ‘long-COVID’. Females (particularly > 40 years) and people with a distorted perception of their sense of smell/taste are likely to benefit from prioritised early therapeutic interventions.

Using a rapid ethnographic approach, the study explored perceptions of the role of community assets in how multimorbidity is managed within Southwark and Lambeth in Southeast London, England. The scoping work comprised of four micro-studies covering (1) Rapid review of the literature (2) Documentary analysis of publicly available local policy documents (3) Thematic analysis of community stories and (4) Semi-structured stakeholder interviews. The data were analysed using framework thematic analysis. Themes are presented for each of the microstudies. The literature review analysis highlights the role of attitudes and understandings in the management of multiple long-term conditions and the need to move beyond silos in their management. Documentary analysis identifies a resource poor climate, whilst recognising the role of community assets and solution-focussed interventions in the management of multimorbidity. Community patient stories underline the lack of joined up care, and psychosocial issues such as the loss of control and reducing isolation. The stakeholder interview analysis reveals again a sense of disjointed care, the need for holism in the understanding and treatment of multimorbidity, whilst recognising the important role of community-based approaches, beyond the biomedical model.

Many studies have evaluated gene expression deregulations in these diseases, but none has tackled systematically the role of alternative splicing. In the present study, we show that alternative splicing is an essential feature of placental diseases, affecting 1060 and 1409 genes in PE vs controls and IUGR vs controls, respectively, many of those involved in placental function. While in IUGR placentas, alternative splicing affects genes specifically related to pregnancy, in preeclamptic placentas, it impacts a mix of genes related to pregnancy and brain diseases. Also, alternative splicing variations can be detected at the individual level as sharp splicing differences between different placentas. We correlate these variations with genetic variants to define splicing Quantitative Trait Loci (sQTL) in the subset of the 48 genes the most strongly alternatively spliced in placental diseases. We show that alternative splicing is at least partly piloted by genetic variants located either in cis (52 QTL identified) or in trans (52 QTL identified). In particular, we found four chromosomal regions that impact the splicing of genes in the placenta.

The magnitude of the problem is unclear, and contradictory evidence surrounds postulated risk factors. POUR risks patient distress, catheter-complications and a financial and logistical burden to services. Separately, in the field of IHR, there has been a lack of research into patients’ perceptions of surgical ‘success’. Our aim is to perform a two-phase, multi-centre prospective study to: 1. Assess the rate, risk factors and impact related to POUR post IH repair. 2. Develop and validate a patient reported outcome measure (PROM) for inguinal hernia repair. METHODS: RETAINER I: We propose a 24-week prospective study with voluntary international participation in 4 week blocks. All patients undergoing elective IH repair (minimally-invasive/open) will be eligible. Standardised data collection will include patient and perioperative factors. Primary outcome will be development of POUR, defined as the need for insertion of a urinary catheter as determined by the treating clinician. Secondary outcomes will be identification of factors predisposing to POUR and the impact of POUR. RETAINER II: A patient reported outcome measure will be developed using representative patient focus groups for item generation, from which an initial questionnaire will be developed and piloted. Validity, reliability, sensitivity and reproducibility will be assessed using the QQ-10 and standard psychometric methodology. CONCLUSIONS: Using an international multicentre collaborative approach will produce the necessary volume of patients, whilst capturing inter-centre variability, to accurately reflect POUR rates and allow analysis of risk factors. This patient pool will provide an excellent opportunity to develop a PROM using appropriate qualitative methodology.

RETAINER I aims to explore the incidence of and risk factors for urinary retention following elective inguinal hernia repair. Urinary retention following inguinal hernia repair has a marked impact on patients and creates a significant financial and logistical burden for hospital services. RETAINER II is a prospective, qualitative study, recruiting patients to guide the creation of a patient-reported outcome measure (PROM) for elective inguinal hernia repair.","Croghan, Stefanie M.; Fleming, Christina A.; Mohan, Helen M.; Harji, Deena; Bolger, Jarlath C.; Elliott, Jessie A.; Boland, Michael; Lonergan, Peter E.; Dillon, Patrick; Quinlan, David M.; Winter, Des C.",,462,1

Most reporting on these disparities is based on predetermined administrative districts that may not reflect true neighborhoods. We undertook a ranking project to describe health at the neighborhood level and used Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, as our case study. METHODS: To create neighborhood health rankings, we first divided the city into neighborhoods according to groups of contiguous census tracts. Modeling our ranking methods and indicators on the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation County Health Rankings, we gathered census tract–level data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s 500 Cities Project and local sources and aggregated these data, as needed, to each neighborhood. We assigned composite scores and rankings for both health outcomes and health factors to each neighborhood. RESULTS: Scores for health outcomes and health factors were highly correlated. We found clusters of neighborhoods with low rankings in Philadelphia’s northern, lower northeastern, western, and southwestern regions. We disseminated information on rankings throughout the city, including through a comprehensive webpage, public communication, and a museum exhibit. CONCLUSION: The Philadelphia neighborhood health rankings were designed to be accessible to people unfamiliar with public health, facilitating education on drivers of health in communities. Our methods can be used as a model for other cities to create and communicate data on within-city geographic health disparities.","Whitley, Jessica; Hirsch, Jana A.; Moore, Kari A.; Melly, Steven J.; Rollins, Heather; Washington, Raynard",Prev Chronic Dis,462,1

Although the structures and evolutionary origins of viral fusion proteins vary widely, all fusion proteins use the same physical principles and topology to drive membrane fusion. First, exposure of a hydrophobic fusion anchor allows them to insert into the host-cell membrane. Conserved hydrophobic residues in the fusion anchor penetrate part way into the outer bilayer leaflet of the host-cell membrane. The fusion protein then folds back on itself, directing the C-terminal viral transmembrane anchor toward the fusion loop. This fold-back forces the host-cell membrane (held by the fusion loop) and the viral membrane (held by the C-terminal transmembrane anchor) against one another until they fuse. In West Nile virus and other flaviviruses this fold-back in the fusion protein, E, is triggered by the reduced pH of an endosome, is accompanied by the assembly of E monomers into trimers, and occurs by domain rearrangement rather than by an extensive refolding of secondary structure. The rearrangement releases a large amount of energy, which is used to exert a bending force on the apposed viral and cellular membranes, propelling them toward each other and, eventually, causing them to fuse. The conserved regions of E that are responsible for driving membrane fusion are attractive targets for antiviral therapies.","Modis, Yorgo; Nayak, Vinod",West Nile Encephalitis Virus Infection,462,1

As a theoretical framework, we will have Gilbert Durand's theory unrolled in the Anthropological Structures of the Imaginary. As a corpus of analysis, we will make a case study regarding visual representations of the risks, specifically, of diseases caused by viruses such as HIV, SARS, H1N1, Ebola and Coronavirus. In the study the concept of risk will be analyzed in a broad way, from a philosophical, communicational and anthropological reasoning of the term, to an instrumental conceptualization for the field of Risk Communication. For that, we will analyze constellations of images that metaphorically represent the risks and their effects. One of these effects are narratives and practices produced by the risk society that least caution about hazards, and that, however, act in the production of chronic, stigmatized and punitive subjectivities, as Vaz (2019) predicts. One of the strategies is to consider the metaphor not only as an ornament or as something that moves the sense from one place to another. The metaphor will be observed as a producer of truths. The concept of risk is thus perceived by theorists such as Beck, Giddens and Douglas as a form of normalization that became a kind of microphysics that acts in all areas of everyday life. This contemporary form of normalization is significant in the process of oppression and identification where the relationship and life management change significantly. KEY MESSAGES: To make a scientific conceptualization for an ethic of the Communication of Risk in the contemporaneity having as a foundation the imaginary produced by the visual metaphors that describe the viruses. This study has as a challenge to know the relationships between the concept of risk and imaginary that can collaborate in the development of prevention practices in the field of Communication.","Luz, L",Eur J Public Health,462,4

Which communities do they include and/or exclude? It explores and discusses paradigms, policies and curriculum developments that have been developed to address the growing levels of diversity in New Zealand’s schools and identifies some of the current significant gaps. This article argues that within the dominant Anglo-European framework, there are increasing intercultural initiatives supporting Māori and Pasifika communities within New Zealand schools but there are very limited policies and initiatives addressing the wider diverse communities. I argue that policies and initiatives should be all-encompassing, comprehensive and inclusive; that is, they must fairly encompass all members of the society and not be limited solely to specific groups. Moreover, the current policy statements are implemented in an ad hoc manner i.e. they are not supported through the systematic resource banks, leadership, teacher education and training and enabling strategies required to create societies that are more inclusive, with respectful intercultural relations. This article will be of interest to policy makers at a national level, those who work in schools and centres, and teacher educators who have a concern for the inclusion of ethnocultural minorities and intercultural education.","Salahshour, Neda",NZ J Educ Stud,462,24

Previous research has revealed a link between improved animal welfare, biosecurity and AMU reduction in pig and dairy sectors, however, little is known about the beef sector. This study aimed to investigate the impact of welfare standards and biosecurity on AMU in beef cattle. Data on performance traits and AMU were collected over a 3.5 year time from 27 specialised beef farms and a treatment incidence was calculated using the defined daily dose for animals. An on-farm assessment was carried out by assigning a score from 0 (very poor) to 100% (very good) to 3 sections: welfare, biosecurity and emergency management. The highest average score was obtained for the welfare section (76%) followed by emergency management (39%) and biosecurity (24%). This suggests that major focus on strategies for the implementation of biosecurity measures and emergency management is needed, due to the low scores reported. A statistically significant lower AMU was observed with improved level of welfare. These results may be helpful for farm benchmarking and highlight the importance of improved animal welfare for an efficient antimicrobial stewardship.","Diana, Alessia; Lorenzi, Valentina; Penasa, Mauro; Magni, Edoardo; Alborali, Giovanni L.; Bertocchi, Luigi; De Marchi, Massimo",Sci Rep,462,16

CONTINUATION OF TEMOZOLOMIDE CHEMOTHERAPY IN A GLIOBLASTOMA PATIENT AFTER RESOLUTION OF COVID-19 PNEUMONIA,16.838411,7.142758,2020-11-09,"BACKGROUND: In 2016 and 2017, Zika virus (ZIKV) infection outbreaks occurred in two communities in southern Thailand. This re-immerging infection can widely spread by mosquito bites and cause serious complications in a central nervous system among children born to infected mothers. Thus, they should be protected. This study aims to (1) To determine the prevalence of neutralizing ZIKV antibodies in the post-outbreak areas among the general population and pregnancy women residing at various distances from the houses of the nearest index patients; (2) To examine the cross-neutralizing capacity of antibodies against ZIKV on other flaviviruses commonly found in the study areas; (3) To identify factors associated with the presence of neutralizing ZIKV antibodies. METHODS: The two post-outbreak communities were visited at 18 months after the outbreaks. We enrolled (1) 18 confirmed ZIKV infected (index) cases, (2) sample of 554 neighbors in the outbreak areas who lived at various distances from the index patients’ houses, (3) 190 residents of non-outbreak areas, and (4) all pregnant women regardless of gestational age residing in the study areas (n = 805). All serum specimens underwent the plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT). Ten randomly selected ZIKV seropositive and ten randomly selected seronegative specimens were tested for dengue virus serotypes 1–4 (DENV1–4) and Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) antibodies using PRNT90. Serum titer above 1:10 was considered positive. Multiple logistic regression was used to assess factors associated with seropositivity. RESULTS: Out of all 18 index cases, 9 remained seropositive. The seroprevalence (95% CI) in the two outbreak areas were 43.7% (35.9–51.6%) and 29.7% (23.3–36.0%) in general population, and 24.3% (20.1–28.8%) and 12.8% (9.7–16.5%) in pregnant women. Multivariate analysis showed that seropositivity was independent of the distance gradient from the index’s houses. However, being elderly was associated with seropositivity. DENV1–4 and JEV neutralizing antibodies were present in most ZIKV-positive and negative subsamples. CONCLUSION: Protective herd immunity for ZIKV infection is inadequate, especially among pregnant women in the two post-outbreak areas in southern Thailand.

This is the conclusion of the present chapter. Information and disinformation have become effective weapons in international politics. This is part of a development where the weapons and concepts used in deterrence strategies have moved away from the military domain toward the political, economic, humanitarian, and communicative ones. In western literature, this is called hybrid warfare. In recent literature on hybrid warfare, resilience is often considered a key theme which may boost deterrence against hybrid activities and/or lower their impact. Most research on resilience and security is focused on infrastructure and resource planning. In this chapter, however, we attempt to ascertain how the existence of resilience in society can be observed. By looking at the case of the Dutch reaction to the shooting down of flight MH17, we hope to illustrate how resilience works in deterrence to hybrid warfare. We try to establish how subversive Russian activities were taking place and what measures were taken by the Netherlands government in order to counteract them. We monitored societal resilience by looking for the presence of trust, social capital, and credible narratives in reaction to disinformation activities after a disruptive event. All these elements appeared to be present in the MH17 case. Overall, we conclude, the handling of the MH17 case has reinforced deterrence.","van Doorn, Cees; Brinkel, Theo",NL ARMS Netherlands Annual Review of Military Studies 2020,462,1

This study describes the construction of a mechanistic, dynamic model for grapevine plant growth and canopy biomass (vigor). To parametrize and validate the model, the progeny from a cross of Ramsey (Vitis champinii) × Riparia Gloire (V. riparia) was evaluated. Plants with different vigor were grown in a greenhouse during the summer of 2014 and 2015. One set of plants was grafted with Cabernet Sauvignon. Shoot growth rate (b), leaf area (LA), dry biomass, whole plant and root specific hydraulic conductance (k(H) and L(pr)), stomatal conductance (g(s)), and water potential (Ψ) were measured. Partitioning indices and specific leaf area (SLA) were calculated. The model includes an empirical fit of a purported seasonal pattern of bioactive GAs based on published seasonal evolutionary levels and reference values. The model provided a good fit of the experimental data, with R = 0.85. Simulation of single trait variations defined the individual effect of each variable on vigor determination. The model predicts, with acceptable accuracy, the vigor of a young plant through the measurement of L(pr) and SLA. The model also permits further understanding of the functional traits that govern vigor, and, ultimately, could be considered useful for growers, breeders and those studying climate change.","Hugalde, Inés P.; Agüero, Cecilia B.; Barrios-Masias, Felipe H.; Romero, Nina; Viet Nguyen, Andy; Riaz, Summaira; Piccoli, Patricia; McElrone, Andrew J.; Walker, M.

The low-death rate European countries (e.g. Austria, Baltic States, Czech Republic, Finland, Norway, Poland, Slovakia) have used different quarantine and/or confinement times and methods and none have performed as many early tests as Germany. Among other factors that may be significant are the dietary habits. It seems that some foods largely used in these countries may reduce angiotensin-converting enzyme activity or are anti-oxidants.

A systematic review found that Xuefu Zhuyu (XFZY) has a promising effect on PD management, yet there is a dearth of high-quality evidence in support of this claim. We want to conduct a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of XFZY for PD patients. METHODS: This is a protocol for a multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled trial. A total of 248 participants with PD will be recruited at 6 centers and randomized into two groups—a herbal treatment group and a placebo group. The participants will receive either XFZY or placebo, three times per day, for 3 menstrual cycles, with a 12-week follow-up. The primary outcome will be the mean change in pain intensity as measured by VAS, while the change in menstrual pain duration, the change in peak pain intensity as measured by VAS, the Cox Menstrual Symptom Scale (CMSS), quality of life EQ-5D-5L, cumulative painkiller consumption, and health economics will be included as secondary outcomes. Adverse events will also be reported. DISCUSSION: This protocol describes a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial that investigates the efficacy and safety of XFZY for primary dysmenorrhea.

It allows using a pair of any oppositely charged polyelectrolytes. Nevertheless, it may be difficult to ascribe a particular physicochemical property of the resulting PEM to a structural or chemical feature of a single component. A solution to this problem is based on the application of a polycation and a polyanion obtained by proper modification of the same parent polymer. Polyelectrolyte multilayers (PEMs) were prepared using the LbL technique from hydrophilic and amphiphilic derivatives of poly(allylamine hydrochloride) (PAH). PAH derivatives were obtained by the substitution of amine groups in PAH with sulfonate, ammonium, and hydrophobic groups. The PEMs were stable in 1 M NaCl and showed three different modes of thickness growth: exponential, mixed exponential-linear, and linear. Their surfaces ranged from very hydrophilic to hydrophobic. Root mean square (RMS) roughness was very variable and depended on the PEM composition, sample environment (dry, wet), and the polymer constituting the topmost layer. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) imaging of the surfaces showed very different morphologies of PEMs, including very smooth, porous, and structured PEMs with micellar aggregates. Thus, by proper choice of PAH derivatives, surfaces with different physicochemical features (growth type, thickness, charge, wettability, roughness, surface morphology) were obtained.","Ciejka, Justyna; Grzybala, Michal; Gut, Arkadiusz; Szuwarzynski, Michal; Pyrc, Krzysztof; Nowakowska, Maria; Szczubiałka, Krzysztof",Materials (Basel),462,1

Methods: Focus group interviews with a write, draw, show, and tell activity were conducted with 32 adolescent boys aged 14–16 years from 3 secondary schools. Three separate sources of data (frequency counts, verbatim transcripts, and visual data) were generated and were pooled together and triangulated. Data were analysed deductively, first using the Youth Physical Activity Promotion model as a thematic framework, and then inductively. Results: Physical activity was frequently associated with organised sport, and most boys were unaware of current UK physical activity guidelines. Co-participation was frequently reported as a reinforcing factor to physical activity. Conclusions: There was a perceived lack of opportunity to participate in muscular fitness activities, particularly in school, and knowledge of how to conduct muscular fitness activities was limited.

Recently, with progress in antibody or protein engineering and recombinant DNA technology, various platforms for generating different types of BsAbs based on novel strategies, for various uses, have been established. More than 30 mature commercial technology platforms have been used to create and develop BsAbs based on the heterologous recombination of heavy chains and matching of light chains. The detailed mechanisms of clinical/therapeutic action have been demonstrated with these different types of BsAbs. Three kinds of BsAbs have received market approval, and more than 110 types of BsAbs are at various stages of clinical trials. In this paper, we elaborate on the classic platforms, mechanisms, and applications of BsAbs. We hope that this review can stimulate new ideas for the development of BsAbs and improve current clinical strategies.","Ma, Jiabing; Mo, Yicheng; Tang, Menglin; Shen, Junjie; Qi, Yanan; Zhao, Wenxu; Huang, Yi; Xu, Yanmin; Qian, Cheng",Front Immunol,462,1

Our aim was to analyse whether a move to virtual care is beneficial and sustainable in a rheumatology outpatient setting. Methods Data on volume of unscheduled access to an outpatient rheumatology service and questionnaire feedback responses from patients and rheumatology clinicians on virtual consultations, was analysed. Results During the COVID-19 pandemic period of March - July 2020, our department saw a majority of face to face outpatient rheumatology clinic appointments transferred to virtual (telephone/video) with a significant reduction in the number of scheduled clinics. In addition, the volume of telephone appointments booked online by patients saw a 27.2% rise (n = 2248) compared to March - July 2019 (n = 1767), with a 23.7% increase in telephone helpline calls in the 2020 period (n = 3246) compared to 2019 (n = 2624) and over a 300% increase in email helpline activity. Questionnaire responses were obtained from 382 patients (Table 1). 86% of patients felt they got a lot out of a virtual appointment, but 13% would prefer not to use it again. Of the 16 healthcare providers that responded, 12 (75%) were satisfied with the virtual clinic set up, but only 2/16 (13%) felt the same could be achieved for patients in a virtual setting compared to a face-to-face visit. The lack of clinical examination was a major limitation for clinicians 12/16 (75%) and was similarly identified amongst patient feedback (42/260) (16%). Conclusion Virtual care with the provision for patient-led care allows convenience for the patient with high patient satisfaction, however this is not necessarily an approach that suits all. Clinicians must beware the non-complaining patient, and careful selection of those suitable for virtual care may be needed. Our model of patient led care using telephone appointments booked online by patients coupled with telephone/email helplines is a potential strategy for other centers to develop. Ongoing patient and healthcare provider feedback, data on the effect on clinical outcomes and detailed quality improvement cycles are vital to adjust services over the coming months. Disclosure Z.

Furthermore, MNF under local anaesthetic (LA) provides similar results with regards to cosmesis and patient satisfaction. We present our experience of performing MNF under LA during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHOD: A single-centre, prospective study of all patients undergoing MNF under LA was conducted (13th July/20–11thSeptember/20). Following reduction, pain scores and patient satisfaction surveys were administered. RESULTS: A total of 25 patients (M/F:16/9, median age, 25.6yr (14-52yr)) were enrolled. The majority of patients received either one or two instillations of LA (n = 19, 76%). Pain reported during the MNF procedure was 4.4/10, whilst pain during LA administration was reported as 3.2/10. 80% of patients felt instillation of LA was less painful than expected. 88% of respondents tolerated the LA well, and only 8% would have opted for general anaesthetic. 24 (96%) participants were happy with the cosmetic result. DISCUSSION: MNF under LA is a safe and effective alternative to MNF under GA. More literature is needed to define the best method of administering LA prior to performing MNF.","Crotty, T; Corbett, M; Hussain, T; Diaconescu, A; Patil, N",Br J Surg,462,26

This project is functioning under three main objectives: (1) recognize the most occupied urban open spaces in New Cairo, (2) identify the required community needs in these urban open spaces, and (3) evaluate quality and suitability of these open spaces for public usage. In this paper, we are attempting to achieve the 2nd objective addressed previously by laying hands on hidden correlations among socio-ecological community needs. This is achieved in two phases; the first phase is mainly concerned with adapting thematic analytical method to tackle multiple correlations while reviewing literature, while the second phase is focusing on conducting a pilot study survey in East Academy district to validate the previously concluded socio-ecological correlations. Also findings indicate that East-Academy’s open spaces have strong correlations with multiple socio-ecological attributes and that ten urban qualities showed the highest positive measures. These correlations, in the future, can be used to establish an intervention action model.","Rasmi, Dalia M.; Zayed, Mohamed A.; Dewidar, Khaled M.; Gabr, Hisham S.",J,462,16

BACKGROUND: New COVID-19 disease is well known by its primary damage of respiratory system. However, it is also possible to involve other organs and systems. PURPOSE: To determine the cardiac involvement in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed echocardiography with speckle tracking in 48 patients. All of them had serologically verified COVID-19 pneumonia with lung involvement 5-60% on CT. None of them were treated by antimalarial drugs. 28 of them were men and 20 women, mean age - 45 ± 4,4 years old. We performed echocardiography in 1 month period from onset of the disease. RESULTS: Most of the patients (30 patients) had enlargement of right heart chambers. Despite of right ventricle enlargement, in none of the patients had reduced right ventricle function (TAPSE 22 ± 2 mm, right ventricle strain -21,2 ± 1,5%). The mean systolic pulmonary artery pressure was slightly elevated (38 ± 2 mm Hg). Left ventricle was enlarged in 9 patients (with mean end diastolic volume 82 ± 5 ml/m2). In 25 of them, the ejection fraction was decreased (44 ± 4%). In all patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, the changes in circumferential and longitudinal strain were observed. Both parameters were decreased. The mean value of circumferential strain was -16,3 ± 1,9%. The longitudinal strain parameter was -14,2 ± 1,4%. 25 patients had enlargement of left atrium (>40ml/m2) and the reservoir strain of left atrium was decreased (-23,3 ± 1,5%) in 29 of them. After 2 months from the onset of the disease, we noticed the normalization of echocardiography data in all patients. Nevertheless, we observed cardiac structural and functional changes in all patients, troponins levels were increased only in 12 patients. CONCLUSION: We observed cardiac involvement in different degree in all of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. Changes characterized by atriums and ventricles enlargement, and left ventricle contractile dysfunction. Due to the fact that only part of the patients with COVID-19 with cardiac changes had elevated troponins, we believe that the mechanism of these pathological changes need further research.","Germanova, O; Tereshina, O",Eur J Cardiovasc Nurs,462,1

The rise of celebrity politicians such as Donald Trump and Vladimir Zelensky has led political theorists and commentators to worry that the role of expertise in democratic politics has been undermined. According to one recent critique (Archer et al. 2020), celebrities possess a significant degree of epistemic power (the power to influence what people believe) that is unconnected to appropriate expertise. This presents a problem both for deliberative and epistemic theories of democratic legitimacy, which ignore this form of power, and for real existing democracies attempting to meet the standards of legitimacy set out by these theories. But do these critiques apply to democratic elitism? In this paper, we argue that recognition of celebrity epistemic power in fact represents a valuable resource for supporting the legitimacy and practice of democratic elitism, though these benefits do come with certain risks to which elite theories are particularly vulnerable.","Archer, Alfred; Cawston, Amanda",Topoi (Dordr),462,16

While many renewables are highly compatible with a more decentralized energy system, research indicates that participation in ‘desirable’ energy activities and energy decision-making is influenced by social and economic factors, including gender, economic status and home ownership. The overall aim of this article is to contribute to this line of inquiry by exploring how and under which conditions energy communities allow for broader participation in the energy system. This article examines how gender, as a more specific condition, influences the extent to which parties can or cannot engage with collective solar ownership models by means of a qualitative study of 11 solar energy communities and one housing association in Sweden. RESULTS: The study revealed that despite the relative potential for inclusion that they hold, energy communities can raise justice concerns in terms of inequities concerning access, capacity, and opportunity to engage in decision-making. CONCLUSIONS: While solely focusing on gender offers a limited view of the dynamics of inclusion and exclusion in renewable energy projects, it is our position that integrating it into the analysis will provide insights into possible measures to remedy limitations and accelerate the renewable energy transition.","Lazoroska, Daniela; Palm, Jenny; Bergek, Anna",Energy Sustain Soc,462,22

Complications that can cause airway compromise occur infrequently, but can rapidly lead to respiratory arrest, leading to severe morbidity or death. Knowing emergent post-operative airway management including surgical airway placement is critical. We aim to review the different etiologies of post-operative airway compromise following ACSS, the predictable timeline in which they occur, and the most appropriate treatment and management for each. We place special emphasis on the timing and proper surgical technique for an emergent cricothyrotomy. Angioedema is seen the earliest as a cause of post-operative airway compromise, typically within 6-12 hours. Retropharyngeal hematomas can be seen between 6-24 hours, most commonly within 12 hours. Pharyngolaryngeal edema is seen within 24-72 hours. After 72 hours, retropharyngeal abscess is the most likely etiology. Several studies have utilized delayed extubation protocols following ACSS based on patient risk factors and found reduced postoperative airway complications and reintubation rates. The administration of perioperative corticosteroids continues to be controversial with high-level studies recommending both for and against their use. Animal studies showed that after cardiac arrest, the brain can recover if oxygenation is restored within 5 minutes, but this time is likely shorter with asphyxia prior to cardiac arrest. Experience and training are essential to reduce the time for successful cricothyrotomy placement. Physicians must be prepared to diagnose and treat acute postoperative airway complications following ACSS to prevent anoxic brain injury or death. If emergent intubation cannot be accomplished on the first attempt, physicians should not delay placement of a surgical airway such as cricothyrotomy.","Debkowska, Monika P; Butterworth, John F; Moore, Jaime E; Kang, Soobin; Appelbaum, Eric N; Zuelzer, Wilhelm A",Journal of spine surgery,462,30

The disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 was named COVID-19 and was soon declared as pandemic because of the millions of infections and thousands of deaths worldwide. Children infected with SARS-CoV-2 usually develop asymptomatic or mild disease compared to adults. They are also more likely to have atypical and non-specific clinical manifestations than adults. METHODS A literature search was performed in PubMed and Scopus to summarize the extrapulmonary manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection in children since the beginning of the pandemic. Peer-reviewed papers in English were retrieved using the following keywords and combinations: 'pediatric', 'child', 'infant', 'neonate', 'novel coronavirus', 'SARS-CoV-2', 'COVID 19' and 'gastrointestinal', 'renal', 'cardiac', 'dermatologic' or 'ophthalmologic'. We included published case series and case reports providing clinical symptoms and signs in SARS-CoV2 pediatric patients. RESULTS Although fever and symptoms of upper respiratory infection are the most frequently presented, a variety of other atypical presentations has also been reported. The clinical spectrum includes dermatological, ophthalmological, neurological, cardiovascular, renal, reproductive, and gastrointestinal presentations. In addition, a rare multi-inflammatory syndrome associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection has been reported in children, often leading to shock requiring inotropic support and mechanical ventilation. CONCLUSIONS Clinicians need to be aware of the wider range of extrapulmonary atypical manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection in children, so that appropriate testing, treatment, and public health measures can be implemented rapidly.","Βenou, Sofia; Ladhani, Shamez; Dimitriou, Gabriel; Gkentzi, Despoina",Current pediatric reviews,462,31

This study compared revascularization performance between intra-arterial fibrinolytic treatment and forced arterial suction thrombectomy with a Penumbra reperfusion catheter in patients with acute basilar artery occlusion. MATERIALS AND METHODS Fifty-seven patients with acute basilar artery occlusion were treated with intra-arterial fibrinolysis (n = 25) or forced arterial suction thrombectomy (n = 32). Baseline characteristics, successful revascularization rate, and clinical outcomes were compared between the groups. RESULTS Baseline characteristics, the frequency of patients receiving intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator, and mean time interval between symptom onset and femoral puncture did not differ between groups. The forced arterial suction thrombectomy group had a shorter procedure duration (75.5 minutes versus 113.3 minutes, P = .016) and higher successful revascularization rate (88% versus 60%, P = .017) than the fibrinolysis group. Fair outcome, indicated by a modified Rankin Scale 0-3, at 3 months was achieved in 34% of patients undergoing forced arterial suction thrombectomy and 8% of patients undergoing fibrinolysis (P = .019), and the mortality rate was significantly higher in the fibrinolysis group (25% versus 68%, P = .001). Multiple logistic regression analysis identified the forced arterial suction thrombectomy method as an independent predictor of fair outcome with adjustment for age, sex, initial NIHSS score, and the use of intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (odds ratio, 7.768; 95% CI, 1.246-48.416; P = .028). CONCLUSIONS In acute basilar artery occlusion, forced arterial suction thrombectomy demonstrated a higher revascularization rate and improved clinical outcome compared with traditional intra-arterial fibrinolysis.

DESIGN Retrospective cohort study, Canadian Task Force Classification II-3. SETTING Tertiary-care university-based teaching hospital. PATIENTS Patients who underwent laparoscopic vaginal closure after removal of the uterus and/or cervix by members of a subspecialty gynecologic laparoscopy division from January 2007 to January 2010 (n = 387). INTERVENTIONS Use of bidirectional barbed suture for laparoscopic vaginal cuff closure. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS A total of 387 patient records were reviewed. The incidence of vaginal cuff dehiscence among those with other methods of closure was 4.2%, while there were no cases of dehiscence among those who had closure with bidirectional barbed suture (p = .008). Postoperative bleeding (OR 2.3, 95% C.I. 1.3-3.9), presence of granulation tissue (OR 1.9, 95% C.I. 0.92-3.9), and cellulitis (OR 4.6, 95% C.I. 1.0-21.1) all occurred more frequently in patients without barbed suture closure. CONCLUSION Dehiscence of the vaginal cuff after laparoscopic closure is a rare but important complication in gynecologic surgery. Use of bidirectional barbed suture eliminated the problem in our first year of experience with the technique. We also observed a decreased incidence of other common problems of the vaginal cuff. This method is easy to learn and inexpensive and does not require advanced skills such as laparoscopic knot-tying.","Siedhoff, Matthew T; Yunker, Amanda C; Steege, John F",Journal of minimally invasive gynecology,462,31

Case Description A 58-year-old woman presented with a continuously growing giant right VA aneurysm, partially thrombosed, even after endovascular treatment (placement of two diversion flow stents). Operative partial aneurysmectomy and intraoperative placement of an endovascular balloon allowed removal from circulation without significant bleeding with a good neurological outcome. Conclusions The variability of VA thrombosed giant aneurysms implies a customized therapeutic strategy. Combined endovascular techniques and surgical clipping allow safe and successful trapping and aneurysmectomy.

Federal legislation has responded to emergent public-health needs by removing barriers that have impeded widespread adoption of telehealth modalities.

Current margin assessment techniques are slow and labour intensive. Rapid evaporative ionisation mass spectrometry (REIMS) rapidly identifies dissected tissues by determination of tissue structural lipid profiles through on-line chemical analysis of electrosurgical aerosol toward real-time margin assessment. METHODS Electrosurgical aerosol produced from ex-vivo and in-vivo breast samples was aspirated into a mass spectrometer (MS) using a monopolar hand-piece. Tissue identification results obtained by multivariate statistical analysis of MS data were validated by histopathology. Ex-vivo classification models were constructed from a mass spectral database of normal and tumour breast samples. Univariate and tandem MS analysis of significant peaks was conducted to identify biochemical differences between normal and cancerous tissues. An ex-vivo classification model was used in combination with bespoke recognition software, as an intelligent knife (iKnife), to predict the diagnosis for an ex-vivo validation set. Intraoperative REIMS data were acquired during breast surgery and time-synchronized to operative videos. RESULTS A classification model using histologically validated spectral data acquired from 932 sampling points in normal tissue and 226 in tumour tissue provided 93.4% sensitivity and 94.9% specificity. Tandem MS identified 63 phospholipids and 6 triglyceride species responsible for 24 spectral differences between tissue types. iKnife recognition accuracy with 260 newly acquired fresh and frozen breast tissue specimens (normal n = 161, tumour n = 99) provided sensitivity of 90.9% and specificity of 98.8%. The ex-vivo and intra-operative method produced visually comparable high intensity spectra. iKnife interpretation of intra-operative electrosurgical vapours, including data acquisition and analysis was possible within a mean of 1.80 seconds (SD ±0.40). CONCLUSIONS The REIMS method has been optimised for real-time iKnife analysis of heterogeneous breast tissues based on subtle changes in lipid metabolism, and the results suggest spectral analysis is both accurate and rapid. Proof-of-concept data demonstrate the iKnife method is capable of online intraoperative data collection and analysis. Further validation studies are required to determine the accuracy of intra-operative REIMS for oncological margin assessment.","St John, Edward R; Balog, Julia; McKenzie, James S; Rossi, Merja; Covington, April; Muirhead, Laura; Bodai, Zsolt; Rosini, Francesca; Speller, Abigail V M; Shousha, Sami; Ramakrishnan, Rathi; Darzi, Ara; Takats, Zoltan; Leff, Daniel R",Breast cancer research : BCR,462,1

From 'stay-at-home' orders to the progressive lifting of restrictions, the COVID-19 pandemic has had unprecedented effects on consumer behaviours and waste disposal habits. The purpose of this short communication is to examine time series waste collection and disposal data in a mid-sized Canadian city to understand how behavioural changes have affected municipal waste management. The results suggest that private waste disposal increased during the pandemic. This may be due to people doing home renovations in order to accommodate working from home. Furthermore, it appears that changes in consumer habits destabilized the consistency of waste disposal tonnage when compared to the same time period in 2019. When considering curbside residential waste collection, there was also an increase in tonnage. This may be the result of more waste being generated at home due to changes in eating and cooking habits, and cleaning routine. Finally, the ratio of residential waste collection to total disposal is examined.

This upsurge is at least partly ascribed to the introduction of the pneumococcal conjugated vaccines that has resulted in an aetiological shift in NTHi's favor with respect to upper respiratory tract infections. Moreover, an increased antimicrobial resistance has been associated with the pathogen, a fact that further strengthens the case for novel vaccine development. AREAS COVERED A background to NTHi-mediated diseases and pathogenesis is outlined. The literature in the field of NTHi vaccine antigens and clinical trials is reviewed with focus on data added to scientific databases in the last two years. Various vaccine development strategies are conceptually discussed. EXPERT COMMENTARY Several promising vaccine antigens have been defined in recent years. A multicomponent protein-based vaccine, potentially boosted with extracellular vesicles, would constitute a suitable path going forward. Of note, however, a clinical trial investigating the efficacy of a combined NTHi/Moraxella catarrhalis vaccine to prevent infections in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients has been initiated. But, as this clinical trial has not yet concluded, and its results are thus unknown, investigations of NTHi pathogenesis must determinedly continue.","Jalalvand, Farshid; Riesbeck, Kristian",Expert review of vaccines,462,32

The use of EHRs and EHR skill development in curricula across pharmacy education is variable. Skills-based courses in curricula are ideal areas to develop these skills and integrate EHR use with the Pharmacists' Patient Care Process. Consideration should be given by each school/college of pharmacy to have an EHR curriculum embedded within skills based courses to help students be ready for Advanced Pharmacy Practice Experiences (APPEs), as well as practice. A consensus on what skills or competencies should be consistently included in schools/colleges of pharmacy should be developed across pharmacy education to increase consistency in the delivery of EHR skills education and assessment. Emphasis on EHR skills and incorporation of them in to national pharmacy education standards would help further guide development and assessment, as well as ensure new pharmacists are on the cutting edge of patient care and technology.","Cook, Kristen; Elder, Kimberly G; Richter, Sara K; Ronald, Katie",American journal of pharmaceutical education,462,1

The purpose of this review is to examine the types of support that online-based peer groups establish as well as its health effects to mothers and their children. METHODS Systematic scoping review. Systematic review of existing literature was conducted using Pubmed, Cinahl, Medline, Cochrane and Ichushi (Japanese language) database in December 2019. RESULTS Based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria, total of 1,475 articles were extracted by initial search. After the review of titles, abstracts and full texts, total of 21 articles met the inclusion criteria. The types of support mothers received were mainly informational and emotional support. Mothers also felt a sense of connection and community. Some health effects of online-based peer support group were seen in the area of mothers' mental well-being. Minimal effects were seen in behavioral modification for child nutrition and breastfeeding. CONCLUSION Due to the limited evidence in interventional studies, the effects of online-based peer support groups were inconclusive. Further studies with rigorous research designs would be helpful in future research.","Yamashita, Ai; Isumi, Aya; Fujiwara, Takeo",Journal of epidemiology,462,19

The reason is that the abnormal tumor microenvironment prevents nanoparticles from effective concentrating and reaching tumor area. Therefore, it's very necessary to better understand the effect of the abnormal tumor microenvironment on the transvascular transport of nanoparticles to overcome this critical problem. METHODS In this paper, a tumor abnormal vascular-interstitial model was established, and the transvascular transport process of nanoparticles was simulated in the model by computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modeling. RESULTS The simulation results showed that the transport efficiency of nanoparticles decreased with increasing interstitial fluid pressure (IFP), and nanoparticles could not cross the blood vessel wall when the IFP approached the blood vessel wall pressure. Interestingly, the transport efficiency of nanoparticles first increased with blood flow velocity, and then decreased with blood flow velocity. CONCLUSIONS The results showed that with the continuous malignant development of tumors, the ability of nanoparticles to passively diffuse has almost disappeared. The enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect of the nanoparticles disappeared with the disappearance of the pressure gradient inside the tumor. These results provided guidance for future research on the vascular transport pathways and mechanisms of nanoparticles.","Gao, Yan; Shi, Yanbin; Fu, Mengguang; Feng, Yihua; Lin, Guimei; Kong, Deyin; Jiang, Bo",Computer methods and programs in biomedicine,462,1

Heightened fears of viral contamination and fears of the negative consequences of social distancing (e.g., fears related to home confinement, fears of loneliness and isolation) might contribute to the distress caused by the pandemic. Cross-sectional data were collected from undergraduates (N = 608) residing in a U.S. pandemic ""hotspot"" at the time of data collection (between 7 April to 9 May, 2020). Outcome variables included viral contamination fears and social distancing fears. Predictor variables included biological sex, underlying medical vulnerability, number of recent viral symptoms, presence of positive COVID-19 test in social network, anxiety, depression, stress, emotion dysregulation, intolerance of uncertainty, body vigilance, and health anxiety. Female sex, anxiety severity, intolerance of uncertainty, and health anxiety uniquely predicted fears of viral contamination. Female sex and depression severity uniquely predicted fears of social distancing. Multiple anxiety-related vulnerabilities are potential intervention targets for reducing viral contamination fears. Depression is a potential intervention target for social distancing fears. Females might be at greater risk for both types of fears.","Fedorenko, Erick J; Kibbey, Mindy M; Contrada, Richard J; Farris, Samantha G",Cognitive behaviour therapy,462,1

The purpose of this study was to explore caregiver burden and psychological distress among caregivers of children with DD as compared to caregivers of typically developing children across the United States as a result of COVID-19. Between 2 weeks and 1 month following COVID-19-related school closures, a total of 460 caregivers from across the U.S. completed an online survey via Qualtrics; recruitment and initial survey completion occurred simultaneously. Of the total sample of eligible participants (N = 407), 225 were the primary caregiver of a child with autism spectrum disorder (ASD)/attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and 182 were the primary caregiver of a child without ASD/ADHD. Participants across groups indicated varying levels of exposure to COVID-19 and an impact of COVID-19 at the community and individual or family levels. However, caregivers of children with ASD/ADHD reported significantly higher levels of burden, depression, anxiety, and stress. Overall, findings are consistent with anecdotal and preliminary reports that all caregivers are experiencing COVID-19-related challenges, with caregivers of children with ASD/ADHD experiencing even greater challenges, particularly with regard to burden and psychological distress.

This study aimed to estimate the prevalence of digital eye strain (DES), describe the pattern of gadget usage, and analyse the risk factors for DES. Methods: This online survey analysed 941 responses from students of online classes (688), teachers of online classes (45), and general population (208). A pre-validated questionnaire was used to calculate the DES score. Non-parametric tests of medians were used to compare the median DES score, Chi-square test to compare categorical variables, and binary logistic regression to find the predictors of DES. Results: The prevalence of eye strain was higher among students taking online classes compared to the general public (50.6% vs 33.2%; χ2 = 22.5, df = 1, p < .0001). There was an increase in screen time during the pandemic compared to pre-pandemic time. The DES score was highest among students attending online classes (p < .0001), in those with eye diseases (p = .001), greater screen time (p = <0.0001), screen distance <20 cm (p = .002), those who used gadgets in dark (p = .017) and those who took infrequent/no breaks (p = .018). The DES scores were proportional to the increase in the number of hours of gadget usage during the pandemic. Conclusion: There is a need to educate people about limiting overall screen exposure and ergonomic methods of screen viewing. Efforts from policymakers to reduce the duration of online classes for students and online work hours for professionals are warranted to control this epidemic of eye strain.","Ganne, Pratyusha; Najeeb, Shaista; Chaitanya, Ganne; Sharma, Aditya; Krishnappa, Nagesha C",Ophthalmic epidemiology,462,1

Their clinical translation, however, depends on delivery technologies that improve stability, facilitate internalization and increase target affinity. Here, we review four platform technologies that have enabled the clinical translation of nucleic acid therapeutics: antisense oligonucleotides, ligand-modified small interfering RNA conjugates, lipid nanoparticles and adeno-associated virus vectors. For each platform, we discuss the current state-of-the-art clinical approaches, explain the rationale behind its development, highlight technological aspects that facilitated clinical translation and provide an example of a clinically relevant genetic drug. In addition, we discuss how these technologies enable the development of cutting-edge genetic drugs, such as tissue-specific nucleic acid bioconjugates, messenger RNA and gene-editing therapeutics.","Kulkarni, Jayesh A; Witzigmann, Dominik; Thomson, Sarah B; Chen, Sam; Leavitt, Blair R; Cullis, Pieter R; van der Meel, Roy",Nature nanotechnology,462,19

A proline residue located at the central FP region has often been suggested to have a distinctive role in this fusion event. The spike glycoprotein from strain RSA59 (PP) of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) contains two central, consecutive prolines in the FP. Here, we report that deletion of one of these proline residues, resulting in RSA59 (P), significantly affected neural cell syncytia formation and viral titers postinfection in vitro Transcranial inoculation of C57Bl/6 mice with RSA59 (PP) or RSA59 (P) yielded similar degrees of necrotizing hepatitis and meningitis, but only RSA59 (PP) produced widespread encephalitis that extended deeply into the brain parenchyma. By day 6 postinfection, both virus variants were mostly cleared from the brain. Interestingly, inoculation with the RSA59 (P)-carrying MHV significantly reduced demyelination at the chronic stage. We also found that the presence of two consecutive prolines in FP promotes a more ordered, compact, and rigid structure in the spike protein. These effects on FP structure were due to proline's unique stereochemical properties intrinsic to its secondary amino acid structure, revealed by molecular dynamics and NMR experiments. We therefore propose that the differences in the severity of encephalitis and demyelination between RSA59 (PP) and RSA59 (P) arise from the presence or absence, respectively, of the two consecutive prolines in FP.

METHODS A matched cohort study was conducted using the Clinical Practice Research Database (CPRD). Adults with an incident asthma code were identified and matched, with up to four randomly selected people without asthma, by age, gender, and practice. Osteoporosis and FF incidence rates were calculated, and Cox regression was performed comparing hazard rates to the general population. We report the impact of age, gender, glucocorticoids, and the risk of specific fractures. RESULTS Patients with asthma had a higher risk of osteoporosis (aHR=1.18, 95% CI: 1.13-1.23) and were 12% (aHR=1.12, 95% CI: 1.07-1.16) more likely to sustain FF than the general population. Age modified the effect of asthma on osteoporosis and FF, such that effect to be stronger in younger people (pinteraction <0.0001). Vertebral (aHR=1.40, 95% CI: 1.33-1.48), and forearm-wrist (aHR=1.27, 95% CI: 1.22-1.32) were the sites linked with a larger incidence. A dose-response relationship between oral corticosteroids (OCS) and osteoporosis was observed, whereas the risk of FF increased in those with 6 or more OCS courses per year. Regular use of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) increased the risk of both bone conditions. CONCLUSION Patients with asthma are more likely to develop osteoporosis or sustain FF than the general population with a particular concern in younger people and those more frequently using OCS and ICS.","Chalitsios, Christos V; McKeever, Tricia M; Shaw, Dominick E",The European respiratory journal,462,24

Methods: We retrospectively reviewed our single-center experience with nephrologist-placed minimally invasive, double-cuffed PD catheters (PDCs). Results: The recruitment period was March 2014 through December 2015. The follow-up period lasted until 2016. The mean age of the subjects was 60 ± 18 years and indications for the PD were diuretic resistant acutely decompensated chronic heart failure in seven patients (47%) and end-stage renal disease in eight (53%) patients. Comorbid conditions included diabetes (27%), ischemic heart disease (47%), advanced liver failure (27%), and a history of hypertension (73%). The cohort had a high mortality with five subjects only in severe heart failure group (33%) passing away during the index hospitalization; of the rest, two (13%) had heart transplantation, three (20%) changed modality to hemodialysis, and only five (33%) continued with maintenance PD beyond 1 month. Acute technical complications within the first month were infrequent: one catheter (6%) had drainage problems and one (6%) was lost due to extrusion.

METHODS AtT rate of patients with scheduled intravitreal injections (IVT) during the COVID-19 outbreak from 23/02/20 to 31/03/20 was compared to the previous trimester and with March 2019. The impact of age, sex, visual function and diagnosis on the AtT rate during unlocked/locked weeks (from March 8) was evaluated. RESULTS Of 650 consecutive patients with scheduled IVT, AtT rate during the COVID-19 outbreak was 0.37. This was significantly lower compared to AtT registered in the previous trimester (0.92) and in the same weeks in 2019 (0.90) (both p <0.001). Patients adherent to treatment were significantly younger (p<0.001) and had a lower best-corrected visual acuity in the fellow eye (p=0.046). During the lockdown weeks AtT rate was significantly lower than in the two unlocked weeks (0.19 vs 0.73, p<0.001). In addition, the AtT rate in patients classified as ""Emergent"" during the lockdown weeks was 0.60. CONCLUSIONS These preliminary results can help the retina specialist community to foresee this unique scenario and to develop successful management strategies.","Viola, Francesco; Milella, Paolo; Giuffrida, Francesco Pozzo; Ganci, Simone; Invernizzi, Alessandro",Retina,462,31

It was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization shortly thereafter. This pandemic is going to have a lasting impact on the functioning of pathology laboratories due to the frequent handling of potentially infectious samples by the laboratory personnel. To deal with this unprecedented situation, various national and international guidelines have been put forward outlining the precautions to be taken during sample processing from a potentially infectious patient. Purpose Most of these guidelines are centered around laboratories that are a part of designated COVID 19 hospitals. However, proper protocols need to be in place in all laboratories, irrespective of whether they are a part of COVID 19 hospital or not as this would greatly reduce the risk of exposure of laboratory/hospital personnel. As part of a laboratory associated with a rural cancer hospital which is not a dedicated COVID 19 hospital, we aim to present our institute's experience in handling pathology specimens during the COVID 19 era. Conclusion We hope this will address the concerns of small to medium sized laboratories and help them build an effective strategy required for protecting the laboratory personnel from risk of exposure and also ensure smooth and optimum functioning of the laboratory services.","Somal, Puneet Kaur; Sancheti, Sankalp; Sali, Akash Pramod; Bansal, Saloni; Kalra, Supreet Kaur; Thakur, Anantika; Gupta, Neha; Kapoor, Rakesh",Journal of cancer research and therapeutics,462,1

In the Third International Stroke Trial, blood pressure was measured in the acute phase of ischemic stroke immediately prior to randomization, and at 0.5, 1, and 24 h after randomization. Masked neuroradiologists rated index infarct, leukoaraiosis, and atrophy on CT using validated methods. We characterized blood pressure variation by coefficient of variance and three other standard methods. We measured associations between blood pressure, blood pressure variability, and leukoaraiosis using generalized estimating equations, adjusting for age, and a number of covariates related to treatment and stroke type/severity. Among 3017 patients, mean (±SD) systolic and diastolic blood pressure decreased from 155(±24)/82(±15) mmHg pre-randomization to 146(±23)/78(±14) mmHg 24 h later ( P < 0.005). Mean within-subject coefficient of variance was 0.09 ± 0.05 for systolic and 0.11 ± 0.06 for diastolic blood pressure. Patients with most leukoaraiosis were older and had higher blood pressure than those with least ( P < 0.0001). Although statistically significant in simple pairwise comparisons, no measures of blood pressure variability were associated with leukoaraiosis when adjusting for confounding variables ( P > 0.05), e.g. age.

We sought to elucidate whether PCI improves mortality compared to MT in patients with objective evidence of ischemia (assessed using noninvasive imaging or its invasive equivalent). We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing PCI to MT in patients with SIHD. To maintain a high degree of specificity for ischemia, studies were only included if ischemia was defined on the basis of noninvasive stress imaging or abnormal fractional flow reserve. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality. We identified 3 RCTs (Effects of Percutaneous Coronary Interventions in Silent Ischemia After Myocardial Infarction II, Fractional Flow Reserve versus Angiography for Multivessel Evaluation 2, and a substudy of the Clinical Outcomes Utilizing Revascularization and Aggressive Drug Evaluation trial) enrolling a total of 1,557 patients followed for an average of 3.0 years. When compared with MT in this population of patients with objective ischemia, PCI was associated with lower mortality (hazard ratio 0.52, 95% confidence interval 0.30 to 0.92, p=0.02). There was no evidence of study heterogeneity or bias among included trials. In this meta-analysis of published RCTs, PCI was shown to have a mortality benefit over MT in patients with SIHD and objective assessment of ischemia using noninvasive imaging or its invasive equivalent. In conclusion, this study provides insight into the management of a higher-risk SIHD population that is the focus of the ongoing International Study of Comparative Health Effectiveness with Medical and Invasive Approaches trial.","Gada, Hemal; Kirtane, Ajay J; Kereiakes, Dean J; Bangalore, Sripal; Moses, Jeffrey W; Généreux, Philippe; Mehran, Roxana; Dangas, George D; Leon, Martin B; Stone, Gregg W",The American journal of cardiology,462,16

Nonmotor symptoms presenting in ALS may cause significant distress, worsen prognosis, and affect survival. OBJECTIVE To systematically review evidence for the prevalence of nonmotor ALS symptoms, and treatment options. METHODS Multiple medical literature databases were searched and studies screened using predefined inclusion criteria. Of 4580 studies, 44 were eligible for inclusion with 25 relating to treatment and 19 to the prevalence of nonmotor symptoms in ALS. RESULTS Nonmotor symptoms involve neuropsychiatric, autonomic, gastrointestinal, and vascular systems, and affect between 5% and 80% of people with ALS. Screening tools for individual nonmotor symptoms are useful in classifying symptom severity and to compare between treatment options. Several methods to relieve nonmotor symptoms have been trialed with varying success rates. CONCLUSIONS Many of the current studies of nonmotor symptoms in ALS have small sample sizes, requiring more evidence to increase precision in prevalence estimates. Further research is needed to assess the efficacy of current treatments and to find new therapies. Symptom relief or treatment of these nonmotor symptoms should therefore be considered during the clinical management of ALS.","Fang, Ton; Jozsa, Felix; Al-Chalabi, Ammar",International review of neurobiology,462,27

The aim of this review was to assess the efficacy, safety and optimal technical parameters of HIFU to treat malignant lesions of the hepatobiliary system. METHODS A systematic search of the English literature was performed until March 2020, interrogating Pubmed, Embase and Cochrane Library databases. The following key-words were input in various combinations: 'HIFU', 'High intensity focussed ultrasound', 'Hepatobiliary', 'Liver', 'Cancer' and 'Carcinoma'. Extracted content included: Application type, Exposure parameters, Patient demographics, and Treatment outcomes. RESULTS Twenty-four articles reported on the clinical use of HIFU in 940 individuals to treat malignant liver lesions. Twenty-one studies detailed the use of HIFU to treat hepatocellular carcinoma only. Mean tumour size was 5.1 cm. Across all studies, HIFU resulted in complete tumour ablation in 55% of patients. Data on technical parameters and the procedural structure was very heterogeneous. Ten studies (n = 537 (57%) patients) described the use of HIFU alongside other modalities including TACE, RFA and PEI; 66% of which resulted in complete tumour ablation. Most common complications were skin burns (15%), local pain (5%) and fever (2%). CONCLUSION HIFU has demonstrated benefit as a treatment modality for malignant lesions of the hepatobiliary system. Combining HIFU with other ablative therapies, particularly TACE, increases the efficacy without increasing complications. Future human clinical studies are required to determine the optimal treatment parameters, better define outcomes and explore the risks and benefits of combination therapies.","Sehmbi, Arjan S; Froghi, Saied; Oliveira de Andrade, Matheus; Saffari, Nader; Fuller, Barry; Quaglia, Alberto; Davidson, Brian",HPB : the official journal of the International Hepato Pancreato Biliary Association,462,1

Since its emergence, COVID-19 has been outbreaking rapidly worldwide, where the virus has so far caused the death of hundreds of thousands and infected more than a million, what has been called a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). According to the WHO-Coronavirus disease 2019 Situation Report-142, by June 10, 2020, there are 7,145,539 confirmed cases and 408,025 deaths. There is an urgent need to develop a suitable specific medicine against this novel coronavirus; therefore, scientists and researchers around the world are making great efforts endeavoring to discover an efficient specific medication for COVID-19 treatment. Given the similarity of the novel coronavirus with previous epidemic viruses, namely, the acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), previously tested drugs could potentially work against the novel coronavirus. In this narrative review, we aim to summarize and discuss the effectiveness of current Western medicine and traditional Chinese medicine options for COVID-19 treatment based on the overview of the scientific literature. Some Western medicines including remdesivir, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, favipiravir, lopinavir/ritonavir, and arbidol, as well as some traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) such as Qingfei Paidu decoction, Yupingfeng, Lianhua Qingwen, and TCM injections have revealed a relative activity against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro, in observational studies, and in clinical trials. However, further extensive studies and clinical trials including double-blind and randomized clinical trials, with a higher number of patients, are necessary to confirm the activity of these medicines. There are several ongoing trials conducted on the drugs of COVID-19, and the results are urgently needed to make a suitable treatment recommendation.","Al-Romaima, Abdulbaset; Liao, Yinan; Feng, Jie; Qin, Xihui; Qin, Guiming",Journal of thoracic disease,462,19

Here we report the case of COVID-19 affecting an immunocompromised women and her presumably immunocompetent spouse. A married couple (age 60 years) was simultaneously admitted to the emergency department on 10 March 2020 because of dyspnoea and fever, consistent with COVID-19. The wife (patient 1) was partially immunocompromised as a consequence of a recently started chemotherapy with fulvestrant and abemaciclid for recurring breast cancer, her husband (patient 2) had been healthy except for a history of controlled arterial hypertension. Both patients were treated with darunavir/cobicistat and hydroxychloroquine. The clinical course of the immunocompromised partner was benign, without need of intensive care. She was able to leave the hospital on day 6 after admission. In contrast, her husband needed intensive care and his recovery was slow, although eventually successful too. These findings suggest that the course of COVID-19 is not necessarily ominous in the presence of a compromised immune response and tend to reinforce the emerging therapeutic concepts of a controlled mitigation of the immune cascade following SARS CoV-2 infection.","Spezzani, Valentina; Piunno, Alessio; Iselin, Hans-Ulrich",Swiss medical weekly,462,24

Phylogenetic analysis of full-length sequences of the spike 1 (S1) gene revealed a new genotype of IBV that we refer to as 'IBADAN'. The minimum genetic distance to the closest 'non-IBADAN' strains (UK/7/93 at the nucleotide level; H120 and M41 at the amino acid level) reached 24 and 32 % at the nucleotide and amino acid levels, respectively. The full genome of the IBADAN reference strain (NGA/A116E7/2006) had a genetic distance of 9.7-16.4 % at the nucleotide level with all available fully sequenced strains. As IBV S1 plays a major role in antigenicity, the antigenic relatedness of NGA/A116E7/2006 was compared with strains of other serotypes. NGA/A116E7/2006 did not cross-react with antisera against IT02, M41, D274, Connecticut or 793/B strains in virus neutralization assays. NGA/A116E7/2006 cross-reacted with the QX-like strain ITA/90254/2005 but only to a low level (antigenic relatedness of 33 %), suggesting that IBADAN also represents a new serotype. A comparison of S1 sequences identified several amino acids that may play a role in IBV antigenicity. Despite the absence of obvious clinical signs in poultry infected by IBADAN strains, it is important to test the cross-protection of current vaccine strains.","Ducatez, Mariette F; Martin, Ana Moreno; Owoade, Ademola A; Olatoye, Isaac O; Alkali, Bello R; Maikano, Issoufou; Snoeck, Chantal J; Sausy, Aurelie; Cordioli, Paolo; Muller, Claude P",The Journal of general virology,462,27

Vaccinated HCWs agreed more frequently with mandatory vaccination than non-vaccinated ones. More studies that consider mandatory vaccination acceptance as the main outcome are needed, but the results of this study confirm that in some settings the majority of HCWs favour mandatory vaccination.

The current treatments for HCC suffer from drug resistance and poor prognosis; therefore, novel therapeutic agents are urgently needed. Phytochemicals have been proposed to treat a range of cancers. Among them, α-lipoic acid (α-LA), a naturally synthesized antioxidant found in various dietary animal and plant sources, prevents oxidant-mediated cell death in normal cells while inducing apoptosis in several cancer cell lines. Previously, we demonstrated that the treatment of hepatoma cells with α-LA induced apoptosis, which was preceded by the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and activation of the p53 protein, a known inducer of mitochondria-mediated apoptosis. Several studies have shown that ROS-induced apoptosis is associated with endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and Unfolded Protein Response (UPR) activation. Herein, we investigated if α-LA-induced apoptosis in hepatoma cell lines was ER stress- and UPR-mediated by gene expression profiling analyses. UPR and ER stress pathways were the most up-regulated after treatment with α-LA. This finding, which has been confirmed by expression analyses of ER- and UPR-associated proteins, provides a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms behind the anti-tumoral action of α-LA on hepatoma cells.","Pibiri, Monica; Sulas, Pia; Camboni, Tania; Leoni, Vera Piera; Simbula, Gabriella",Scientific reports,462,1

OBJECTIVE To compare splenectomized (SP) versus sham-splenectomized (SSP) swine during acute controlled hemorrhage. METHODS Twenty-six male Landrace White swine (mean body weight ± standard deviation, 33.8 ± 2.9 kg) were used. Ethics approval was obtained. Landrace swine underwent splenectomy (n = 13) or sham-splenectomy (n = 13), were bled to mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) of 40 mm Hg, which was held for 60 min, given 125 mL IV RescueFlow, held for a further 60 min, given whole blood, and held for a final 60 min. Tissue oxygen saturation, thromboelastography, oncotic pressure, urine volume and specific gravity, complete blood count, serum chemistry, body temperature, hematocrit, total solids, arterial and mixed venous blood gas, bispectral index, SAP, MAP, DAP, cardiac index, total blood volume (TBV) removed and returned, rate of hemorrhage and transfusion, spleen weight, heart rate (HR), arterial pH, lactate, PaO2, PaCO2, respiratory rate, cranial mesenteric and renal artery blood flow were recorded. Groups were compared using two-way ANOVA with post hoc Bonferroni (P < 0.05) for repeated measures or t test for non-repeated measures. RESULTS Compared with the SSP swine, SP swine had higher HR post-splenectomy for the duration of the experiment (P < 0.03), and higher hematocrits at 15 and 60 min post splenectomy (P < 0.01, P < 0.001, respectively). SSP swine had greater TBV removed during hemorrhage (P < 0.01); however, when blood loss based on splenic weight was considered, TBV removed was similar between groups. CONCLUSION Splenectomy likely accounts for the transient increase in hematocrit and the higher HR in SP swine prior to hemorrhage, and the differences in TBV removed between the two groups during hemorrhage. With a fixed end point model using a moderate rate of acute hemorrhage and an MAP of 40 mm Hg, splenectomy is not necessary and may confound results.","Boysen, Søren R; Caulkett, Nigel A; Brookfield, Caroline E; Warren, Amy; Pang, Jessica M",Shock,462,29

MIS allows for exploration and potential repair of an occult contralateral hernia. The aim of this study is to evaluate complications associated with intraoperative contralateral exploration and repair through robotic-assisted (da Vinci®) IHR. 652 robotic-assisted inguinal hernia procedures were uniformly and retrospectively collected from seven surgeons. Incidental contralateral findings were evaluated and populations with and without contralateral findings were compared in terms of demographics, operative characteristics and complications. This case series includes the earliest cases in each surgeon's robotic-assisted IHR experience. Seventy-one percent (71%) of patients presented with a unilateral hernia. Intraoperative/incidental contralateral (""occult"") hernias were found in 12.3% of patients with a unilateral diagnosis. For patients with and without contralateral findings, there were no significant differences in demographics and baseline health characteristics. Perioperative morbidity was statistically similar between groups: intraoperative complications (0 vs 0.5%, p = 1.000), postoperative complications prior to discharge (0 vs 3.2%, p = 0.38) and from discharge through 30 days (5.3 vs 4.0%, p = 0.72), as well as readmissions and reoperations related to the repair within 30 days. Differences in setting of care, length of stay, rate of blood transfusions, concomitant procedures and conversions were nonsignificant. Mean operative time was longer in patients with a contralateral hernia by 19 min (p < 0.0001). Intraoperative contralateral exploration and subsequent repair during robotic-assisted IHR does not compromise perioperative patient morbidity. These study results support the increasing evidence for repair of contralateral, incidentally discovered inguinal hernias.Clinicaltrials.Gov ID number: NCT02684448.","Dickens, Eugene O; Kolachalam, Ramachandra; Gonzalez, Anthony; Richardson, Christopher; D'Amico, Lawrence; Rabaza, Jorge; Gamagami, Reza",Journal of robotic surgery,462,1

Principles of education in resuscitation.,16.503939,7.06907,2010,"Resurgent outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases that have previously been controlled or eliminated have been observed in many settings. Reactive vaccination campaigns may successfully control outbreaks but must necessarily be implemented in the face of considerable uncertainty. Real-time surveillance may provide critical information about at-risk population and optimal vaccination targets, but may itself be limited by the specificity of disease confirmation. We propose an integrated modelling approach that synthesizes historical demographic and vaccination data with real-time outbreak surveillance via a dynamic transmission model and an age-specific disease confirmation model. We apply this framework to data from the 1996-1997 measles outbreak in São Paulo, Brazil. To simulate the information available to decision-makers, we truncated the surveillance data to what would have been available at 1 or 2 months prior to the realized interventions. We use the model, fitted to real-time observations, to evaluate the likelihood that candidate age-targeted interventions could control the outbreak. Using only data available prior to the interventions, we estimate that a significant excess of susceptible adults would prevent child-targeted campaigns from controlling the outbreak and that failing to account for age-specific confirmation rates would underestimate the importance of adult-targeted vaccination.","Fonnesbeck, Christopher J; Shea, Katriona; Carran, Spencer; Cassio de Moraes, Jose; Gregory, Christopher; Goodson, James L; Ferrari, Matthew J","Journal of the Royal Society, Interface",462,23

The reason for this proposal is the usual scientific argument claiming that these trials are the most efficient method to obtain reliable results, and individuals in these countries will continue to get the local standard of care, meaning no vaccination, and thus participants are not being left worse off. We refute this argument on two counts. First the global equity and justice issue, that the scarcity of vaccines in most countries is created by the rich nations that have hoarded vaccines. Second, the science versus research ethics issue, that there are valid scientific methods like non-inferiority trials which can give reliable results, and that applying a standard of care imposed by rich nations is both unethical and possibly exploitative. Thus, we feel that the WHO Ad Hoc Expert Group is wrong in proposing to continue placebo-controlled Covid-19 vaccine trials.","Ahmad, Aasim; Dhrolia, Murtaza F",Indian journal of medical ethics,462,1

One potential strategy that has been suggested is the use of stem cells to accelerate healing. Methods The following databases were searched: MEDLINE, CENTRAL, EMBASE, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, WHO-ICTRP, ClinicalTrials.gov, as well as reference checking of included studies. The inclusion criteria for the study were: population (any adults who have sustained a fracture, not including those with pre-existing bone defects); intervention (use of stem cells from any source in the fracture site by any mechanism); and control (fracture healing without the use of stem cells). Studies without a comparator were also included. The outcome was any reported outcomes. The study design was randomized controlled trials, non-randomized or observational studies, and case series. Results In all, 94 eligible studies were identified. The clinical and methodological aspects of the studies were too heterogeneous for a meta-analysis to be undertaken. A narrative synthesis examined study characteristics, stem cell methods (source, aspiration, concentration, and application) and outcomes. Conclusion Insufficient high-quality evidence is available to determine the efficacy of stem cells for fracture healing. The studies were heterogeneous in population, methods, and outcomes.

Cerebral vasospasm (CVS; narrowing of cerebral arteries) occurs following SAH and represents a major cause of associated mortality and morbidity. To improve postsurgery care of SAH patients and their prognosis, the ability to predict CVS onset is critical. We report a long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) signature to distinguish SAH patients with CVS from SAH patients without CVS. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was obtained from SAH patients without CVS (n = 10) and SAH patients with CVS (n = 10). lncRNAs ZFAS1 and MALAT1 were significantly upregulated (p < 0.05), whereas lncRNAs LINC00261 and LINC01619 were significantly downregulated in SAH patients with CVS (p < 0.05) compared to SAH patients without CVS. We applied this lncRNA signature to retrospectively predict CVS in SAH patients (n = 38 for SAH patients without CVS, and n = 27 for SAH patients with CVS). The 4-lncRNA signature was found to be predictive in >40% of samples and the 2-lncRNA comprising MALAT1 and LINC01619 accurately predicted CVS in ∼90% cases. These results are initial steps toward personalized management of SAH patients in clinics and provide novel CSF biomarkers that can substantially improve the clinical management of SAH patients.","Pan, Chen-Yu; Tian, Miao; Zhang, Lei-Lei; Tian, Dan; Wang, Li-Yan; Sun, Yu-Jia; Cui, Yun-Feng",Molecular therapy.

However, with no standardised regulation of the internet, the population is vulnerable to misinformation regarding important health information. This review aimed to evaluate the quality and readability of the online information available on emergency contraception (EC) options. STUDY DESIGN In this descriptive study, a Google search was performed using the term 'emergency contraception options' on 13 April 2020 yielding 232 results. Seventy-one results were excluded (34 inaccessible, 37 contained no medical information). The remaining 161 results were categorised by typology and assessed for credibility (JAMA criteria and HONcode), reliability (DISCERN tool) and readability (Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level and Simple Measure of Gobbledygook). RESULTS Of all webpages evaluated, the most common typology was governmental. Credibility of web pages was poor (average JAMA score of 1.47 out of 4). Only 10.6% of webpages were HONcode certified. The most common DISCERN category was Fair (29.81%), closely followed by Poor (27.95%) reliability. On average, readability levels were above the recommended grade level for health information. The intrauterine device was discussed least frequently (86.96%) of all the EC options. CONCLUSION Online information was of low credibility, reliability and written above the recommended reading level.

Multipotency of MSC may result in both desirable and undesirable cells, post-transplantation. A better strategy to attain desired cells may be in vitro commitment of hADMSCs to uni-/bi- potent neural progenitor cells (NPCs), prior to transplantation. Derivation of stable NPCs may require a suitable niche eliciting proliferation and differentiation signals. The present study designed a biomimetic niche comprising insoluble fibrin supported adhesion matrix and exogenously added growth factors (GFs) for deriving different neural cells and established the role of Notch and Wnt signals for proliferation and differentiation of hADMSCs, respectively. The stable transformation of hADMSCs into neurospheres (NS) comprising Nestin+ve NPCs was achieved consistently. Slight modifications of niche enable differentiation of NS to NPCs; NPCs to neurons; NPCs to oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs); and OPCs to oligodendrocytes (OLG). Fibrin plays a crucial role in the conversion of hADMSC to NS and NPCs to OPCs; but, not essential for OPC to OLG maturation. Co-survival and cell-cell interaction of NPC derived neurons and OPCs promoting OLG maturation is illustrated. The designed biomimetic niche shows the potential for directing autologous ADMSCs to neural cells for applications in regenerative medicine.","Chandrababu, Krishnapriya; Senan, Manesh; Krishnan, Lissy K",Scientific reports,462,1

STUDY DESIGN An anonymous survey was designed to collect data regarding demographics, duration and nature of DE symptoms, type of surgery and postoperative outcomes. Members of endometriosis patient associations in 14 countries were invited to complete the survey if they had been diagnosed with DE. Factors associated with postoperative outcomes were analyzed using Mann-Whitney U and Fisher's exact tests. RESULTS Data was available from 136 respondents (median age 34 years). 98 % of respondents were from Europe, North America or Oceania. The most frequently reported symptoms of DE were moderate-severe pain in the upper abdomen (68 %), chest (64 %) and shoulder (54 %). Pain was right-sided in 54 %, left-sided in 11 % and bilateral in 35 %. Of 122 respondents who initially consulted a primary care physician, a gynaecology referral occurred after a median of five consultations (range 1-100). The median time between first primary care consultation and diagnosis of DE was two years (range 0-23). 31 % were diagnosed >1 year after their first gynaecology consultation (range 1-13 years), and 30 % required two or more laparoscopies before diagnosis. 116 respondents underwent surgical treatment. Postoperative data was available for 113 respondents, and 65 % reported either a significant improvement or complete resolution of symptoms. There was no significant difference in age (P = 0.19), timing of diagnosis (P = 0.59) or type of procedure (excision or ablation) (P = 0.13) between respondents who did and did not experience symptomatic relief after surgery. 61 % reported long-lasting symptomatic relief after a median of 1 year, whilst 39 % reported ongoing moderate-severe pain or have undergone further surgery for recurrent symptoms. CONCLUSION The diagnosis and treatment of diaphragmatic endometriosis is often delayed, due to lack of awareness by patients and healthcare professionals. The diagnosis of DE requires a high index of suspicion and involvement of surgeons trained in laparoscopic liver mobilization. Recurrent symptoms are common following surgical treatment, and international collaborative studies are required to determine the long-term outcomes of this condition.","Piccus, Rachel; Mann, Christopher; Sutcliffe, Robert P","European journal of obstetrics, gynecology, and reproductive biology",462,1

Moral distress is previously considered a root cause of burnout, but there are other risk factors of burnout such as personality, work-life balance and culture. This study aimed to disentangle the associations of ICU professionals' moral distress and other risk factors with the components of burnout-emotional exhaustion, depersonalisation and personal accomplishment-suggesting informed burnout prevention strategies. METHODS Cross-sectional survey completed in 2019 of ICU professionals in two Dutch hospitals. The survey included validated measure for burnout (the Dutch Maslach Burnout Inventory), moral distress (Moral Distress Scale), personality (short Big Five Inventory), work-home balance (Survey Work-Home Interaction Nijmegen) and organisational culture (Culture of Care Barometer). Each of the three components of burnout was analysed as a separate outcome, and for each of the components, a separate regression analysis was carried out. RESULTS 251 ICU professionals responded to the survey (response rate: 53.3%). Burnout prevalence was 22.7%. Findings showed that moral distress was associated with emotional exhaustion (β=0.18, 95% CI 0.9 to 0.26) and depersonalisation (β=0.19, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.28) and with increased emotional exhaustion mediated by negative work-to-home spillover (β=0.09, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.13). Support from direct supervisors mitigates the association between moral distress and emotional exhaustion (β=0.16, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.27). CONCLUSIONS Understanding moral distress as a root cause of burnout is too simplified. There is an important interplay between moral distress and work-home imbalance. Interventions that support individual coping with moral distress and a work-home imbalance, and the support of direct supervisors, are paramount to prevent burnout in physicians and nurses.","Kok, Niek; Van Gurp, Jelle; van der Hoeven, Johannes G; Fuchs, Malaika; Hoedemaekers, Cornelia; Zegers, Marieke",BMJ quality & safety,462,1

Herein, we report our experience of extracorporeal ligation of the ureter and the ureteral catheter through the trocar port, which differs from conventional laparoscopic ligation in the retroperitoneal space. This technique was selected to reduce the time needed for ureter management using the stripping technique and to provide secure ligation. MATERIALS AND SURGICAL TECHNIQUE We performed this stripping technique in patients with T1 and T2 stage renal pelvic cancer without imaging-evident lymph node metastasis. After transurethrally placing a ureteral catheter, we resected the circumference of the ureteral orifice. After laparoscopic nephrectomy via a retroperitoneal approach, the ureteral catheter and distal ureter were ligated extracorporeally. The catheter was pulled to invaginate the ureter so it could then be pulled through the external urethral orifice. DISCUSSION This technique of extracorporeal ligation ensures more a secure ligation of the ureter and ureteral catheter. This modified stripping technique does not require lower ureter management with laparotomy, and it is also useful in shortening the operative time. This method is effective for relatively early stage renal pelvic cancer.","Nakamura, K; Nagata, D; Kajikawa, K; Kobayashi, I; Zennami, K; Nishikawa, G; Yoshizawa, T; Tobiume, M; Aoki, S; Yamada, Y; Sumitomo, M",Asian journal of endoscopic surgery,462,2

OBJECTIVES To retrospectively review adult patients with DAIB without pneumonia, document the etiologies and outcomes, and assess the relation between DAIB and postinfectious bronchiolitis obliterans. METHODS We retrospectively analyzed medical records of 1,664 patients with lower respiratory tract infections admitted to our institution in Saitama, Japan. DAIB was diagnosed when patients developed acute feverish lower respiratory tract infection and chest computed tomography demonstrated mainly multiple centrilobular nodules in four or more lobes. Pneumonia was diagnosed when patients developed acute feverish lower respiratory tract infection and chest computed tomography demonstrated consolidation and/or ground-glass opacities with or without centrilobular nodules. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Of the 1,664 patients, 20 (1.2%) and 1,644 (98.8%) patients were diagnosed as having DAIB and pneumonia, respectively. Of the 20 patients with DAIB, the etiology was determined in 16 (80%): 13 (65.0%) had a single pathogen and 3 (15.0%) had two pathogens. Detected organisms included Mycoplasma pneumoniae in eight (40.0%) patients, influenza virus in two (10.0%), influenza virus and Streptococcus pneumoniae in two (10.0%), Haemophilus influenzae in three (15.0%), and respiratory syncytial virus and rhinovirus in one (5.0%) patient. All patients improved and none developed postinfectious bronchiolitis obliterans. CONCLUSIONS The three most common etiologies of DAIB in the studied adults were M. pneumoniae, influenza virus, and H. influenzae.

Such masks are believed to be effective in prevention of respiratory viral transmission. OBJECTIVES The study was undertaken to assess the use of face masks among students during the COVID-19 pandemic, with focus on similarities and differences between medical and non-medical students. MATERIAL AND METHODS The study was based on the specially designed survey. The questionnaire, after consultation with 10 students, was created using Google Forms and posted on numerous Facebook groups for students in Poland. The recall period of the questionnaire was the previous 7 days. In 48 h, 2,315 answers were obtained. Fifty-nine questionnaires were excluded due to data incompleteness and failure to fulfil inclusion criteria. Therefore, 2,256 surveys (97.5%) were considered for final analysis. RESULTS Medical students showed significantly different attitudes and practices concerning the use of face masks. Medical students used face masks more commonly and for longer periods of time. Moreover, they wore single-use masks more often and less frequently re-used them. Also, multiple use of single-use face masks and masks decontamination procedures were less common among medical students. CONCLUSIONS We suggest that medical students might be of help in educational campaigns for general public on proper use of face protection.","Matusiak, Łukasz; Szepietowska, Marta; Krajewski, Piotr; Białynicki-Birula, Rafał; Szepietowski, Jacek",Advances in clinical and experimental medicine : official organ Wroclaw Medical University,462,1

MATERIALS AND METHODS Twenty healthy adult donor PB samples, and twenty CB samples acquired at the time of delivery were processed to obtain serum (S), platelet-rich plasma (PRP), platelet-poor plasma (PPP), and S retrieved from PRP after activation with Ca-gluconate (PRP-R). The levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), nerve growth factor (NGF), glial-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), fibroblast growth factor (FGF), and epidermal growth factor (EGF) were assessed with a Luminex xMAP (Luminex Corporation), and by using multikine kits from R&D system, and were statistically analysed in the eight different preparations. The impact of S, PRP, PPP, PRP-R from both sources on a cell line responding to NF supplementation (MIO-M1, UCL Institute of Ophthalmology, London, UK) was tested with a scratch wound assay, and analysed by IncuCyte S3 equipment. RESULTS All the preparations from CB showed higher NF levels, except for BDNF where no difference was found as compared to PB. PRP showed higher NF levels with respect to S, PPP and PRP-R in this decreasing order. Younger donors in PB contributed with higher NF levels. The scratch assay showed different cell migration results, with a complete wound closure only recorded with the supplementation of CB-S, and a progressive reduction by using PRP, PRP-R, and PPP from both sources. DISCUSSION Protocols of preparation and choice of blood source determine different NF levels in the final products. The therapeutic use of a natural neurotrophin pool from blood sources might have a clinical impact in several different settings. Efforts are needed to standardise the manufacturing and the product content in order to establish and modulate the posology of the final supplementation.","Valente, Sabrina; Curti, Nico; Giampieri, Enrico; Randi, Vanda; Donadei, Chiara; Buzzi, Marina; Versura, Piera",Blood transfusion = Trasfusione del sangue,462,26

Patient preparation can help to obtain a cleaner intestine and thus better visibility in the resulting videos. However, studies on the most effective preparation method are conflicting due to the absence of objective, automatic cleanliness evaluation methods. In this work, we aim to provide such a method capable of presenting results on an intuitive scale, with a relatively light-weight novel convolutional neural network architecture at its core. We trained our model using 5-fold cross-validation on an extensive data set of over 50,000 image patches, collected from 35 different CE procedures, and compared it with state-of-the-art classification methods. From the patch classification results, we developed a method to automatically estimate pixel-level probabilities and deduce cleanliness evaluation scores through automatically learnt thresholds. We then validated our method in a clinical setting on 30 newly collected CE videos, comparing the resulting scores to those independently assigned by human specialists. We obtained the highest classification accuracy for the proposed method (95.23%), with significantly lower average prediction times than for the second-best method. In the validation of our method, we found acceptable agreement with two human specialists compared to interhuman agreement, showing its validity as an objective evaluation method.","Noorda, Reinier; Nevárez, Andrea; Colomer, Adrián; Pons Beltrán, Vicente; Naranjo, Valery",Scientific reports,462,27

Legal and regulatory standards are in place to prevent agricultural, nosocomial, and community airborne disease transmission. However, the overall importance of the airborne pathway is underappreciated, e.g.,, US National Library of Medicine's Medical Subjects Headings (MESH) thesaurus lacks an airborne disease transmission indexing term. This has practical consequences as airborne precautions to control epidemic disease spread may not be taken when airborne transmission is important, but unrecognized. Publishing clearer practical methodological guidelines for surveillance studies and disease outbreak evaluations could help address this situation.To inform future work, this paper highlights selected, well-established airborne transmission events - largely cases replicated in multiple, independently conducted scientific studies. Methodologies include field experiments, modeling, epidemiology studies, disease outbreak investigations and mitigation studies. Collectively, this literature demonstrates that airborne viruses, bacteria, and fungal pathogens have the capability to cause disease in plants, animals, and humans over multiple distances - from near range (< 5 m) to continental (> 500 km) in scale. The plausibility and implications of undetected airborne disease transmission are discussed, including the notable underreporting of disease burden for several airborne transmitted diseases.","Dillon, Charles F; Dillon, Michael B",Applied and environmental microbiology,462,31

In this study, we implemented a previously described fast and simple lanthanum-based protocol for concentration of norovirus genogroup I (GI), genogroup II (GII) and hepatitis A virus (HAV) in drinking and surface water. We compared the results with those of a widely used skimmed milk flocculation method, followed by nucleic acid extraction and RT-qPCR detection. Three seeding levels, with intended concentrations 5 × 103, 5 × 104 and 5 × 105 genome copies/10 L, were added to drinking water or surface water. All seed levels were detected with both flocculation methods. Samples extracted with skimmed milk flocculation had on average 1.82, 1.86 and 1.38 times higher measured concentration of norovirus GI, GII and HAV, respectively, than those extracted with lanthanum flocculation, across all seeding levels and water types tested. Mengovirus was used as a positive process control. Mengovirus recovery was higher for skimmed milk (40.7% in drinking water, 26.0% in surface water) than for lanthanum flocculation (24.4% in drinking water, 9.7% in surface water). Together, this indicates that skimmed milk flocculation provides higher viral recovery than lanthanum flocculation. However, lanthanum-based flocculation can be performed much faster than skimmed milk flocculation (1.5 h versus 16 h flocculation time) and thus could be a good alternative for rapid monitoring of viruses in water.","Borgmästars, Emmy; Persson, Sofia; Hellmér, Maria; Simonsson, Magnus; Eriksson, Ronnie",Food and environmental virology,462,31

Here, we report a nanoparticle-based trispecific NK cell engager (nano-TriNKE) platform that can target epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-overexpressing tumors and promote the recruitment and activation of NK cells to eradicate these cancer cells. Moreover, the nanoengagers can deliver cytotoxic chemotherapeutics to further improve their therapeutic efficacy. We have demonstrated that effective NK cell activation can be achieved by the spatiotemporal coactivation of CD16 and 4-1BB stimulatory molecules on NK cells with nanoengagers, and the nanoengagers are more effective than free antibodies. We also show that biological targeting, either through radiotherapy or EGFR, is critical to the therapeutic effects of nanoengagers. Last, EGFR-targeted nanoengagers can augment both NK-activating agents and chemotherapy (epirubicin) as highly effective anticancer agents, providing robust chemoimmunotherapy.","Au, Kin Man; Park, Steven I; Wang, Andrew Z",Science advances,462,1

However, much less attention has been paid to the differential effect of COVID-19 according to different personalities. We do this using the UK Household Longitudinal Study (UKHLS), a large-scale panel survey representative of the UK population. The UKHLS allows us to assess the mental health of the same respondent before and during the COVID-19 period based on their ""Big Five"" personality traits and cognitive skills. We find that during the COVID-19 period, individuals who have more extravert and open personality traits report a higher mental health deterioration, while those scoring higher in agreeableness are less affected. The effect of openness is particularly strong: One more SD predicts up to 0.23 more symptoms of mental health deterioration in the 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12) test during the COVID-19 period. In particular, for females, cognitive skills and openness are strong predictors of mental health deterioration, while for non-British White respondents, these predictors are extraversion and openness. Neuroticism strongly predicts worse mental health cross-sectionally, but it does not lead to significantly stronger deterioration during the pandemic. The study's results are robust to the inclusion of potential confounding variables such as changes in physical health, household income, and job status (like unemployed or furloughed).","Proto, Eugenio; Zhang, Anwen",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,462,16

To prevent serious stoma-related complications such as stoma side perforation, prolapse, fall and surgical site infection, we introduce our new ""sutureless enterostomy"" technique. METHODS We present the procedures in detail. We reviewed the medical records of twelve patients who underwent ""sutureless enterostomy"" in our neonatal intensive care unit from 2007 to 2013. Patient attributes, surgery-related items, stoma-related complications and outcomes were investigated. RESULTS Mean birth weight was 671±158g (mean±S.D.). Six cases of MOP, three cases of SIP and three cases of NEC were diagnosed. Mean operative time was 75±35min (mean±S.D.) None of them presented any of early stoma-related complications (necrosis, fall, and surgical site infection). However the parastomal hernia occurred in one patient as late complication. Three deaths occurred postoperatively as a result of exacerbations of their conditions. CONCLUSIONS Based on our preliminary observations, our new ""sutureless enterostomy"" was done safely and reduced the risk of stoma-related complications. It may be an ideal procedure for the ELBWI with MOP or SIP.","Ohashi, Kensuke; Koshinaga, Tsugumichi; Uehara, Shuichiro; Furuya, Takeshi; Kaneda, Hide; Kawashima, Hiroyuki; Ikeda, Taro",Journal of pediatric surgery,462,1

Recent studies uncovered the ubiquitous and influential KCNQ family of voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channels as a therapeutic target for several medicinal plant compounds. Capers - immature flower buds of Capparis spinosa - have been consumed for food and medicinal purposes for millennia. Here, we show that caper extract hyperpolarizes cells expressing KCNQ1 or KCNQ2/3 Kv channels. Capers are the richest known natural source of quercetin, the most consumed dietary flavonoid. Quercetin potentiated KCNQ1/KCNE1, KCNQ2/3 and KCNQ4 currents but, unusually, not KCNQ5. Strikingly, quercetin augmented both activation and inactivation of KCNQ1, via a unique KCNQ activation mechanism involving sites atop the voltage sensor and in the pore. The findings uncover a novel potential molecular basis for therapeutic effects of quercetin-rich foods and a new chemical space for atypical modes of KCNQ channel modulation.","Redford, Kaitlyn E; Abbott, Geoffrey W",Communications biology,462,16

SRD5A2 is already a target of clinically relevant drugs. However, the detailed mechanism of SRD5A-mediated reduction remains elusive. Here we report the crystal structure of PbSRD5A from Proteobacteria bacterium, a homolog of both SRD5A1 and SRD5A2, in complex with the cofactor NADPH at 2.0 Å resolution. PbSRD5A exists as a monomer comprised of seven transmembrane segments (TMs). The TM1-4 enclose a hydrophobic substrate binding cavity, whereas TM5-7 coordinate cofactor NADPH through extensive hydrogen bonds network. Homology-based structural models of HsSRD5A1 and -2, together with biochemical characterization, define the substrate binding pocket of SRD5As, explain the properties of disease-related mutants and provide an important framework for further understanding of the mechanism of NADPH mediated steroids 3-oxo-Δ4 reduction.

This is due to both to the reallocation of resources toward COVID-19 patients as well as concern for the risk of nosocomial severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) exposure. The interruption of routine care is especially problematic for patients with chronic conditions requiring regular follow-up, such as lung transplant (LTx) recipients. Introduction: New methods such as telemedicine are needed to bridge the gap in follow-up care caused by the pandemic. Materials and Methods: A retrospective analysis of video consultations (VCs) in comparison with on-site visits (OSVs) was performed during a 6-week period in an LTx center in Germany. VC included a structured work-up questionnaire and vital sign documentation. Results: During the 6-week study period, 75 VCs were performed for 53 patients and 75 OSVs by 51 patients occurred. By the end of our study period, 77% of physician-patient contacts occurred through VC. Physician-patient consultations were reduced by 47% compared with the equivalent time frame in 2019. In 62% of cases, VC resulted in a concrete clinical decision. One COVID-19 patient in home quarantine was admitted due to respiratory failure detected by VC. Patient satisfaction with VC was high. Discussion: Implementation of VC helped to reduce the need for OSV and thus the risk of SARS-CoV-2 exposure in our patient cohort. This technology can be adopted to provide care for a wide range of chronic illnesses. Conclusions: VC can preserve access to specialist care while reducing SARS-CoV-2 exposure for patients with chronic illnesses during the pandemic.","Kayser, Moritz Z; Valtin, Christina; Greer, Mark; Karow, Bernd; Fuge, Jan; Gottlieb, Jens",Telemedicine journal and e-health : the official journal of the American Telemedicine Association,462,0

CD45RA- memory T cells confer protection against viruses such as cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, and adenovirus; however, reports have shown an unexpectedly high incidence of human herpesvirus (HHV)-6B encephalitis among pediatric allo-HSCT patients. METHODS We report the first 18 consecutive allo-HSCT, 16 haplo-HSCT, and two human leukocyte antigen-matched related donors implanted with naïve TCD grafts. All donors were administered three cell products: first, a CD34+ stem cell product; second, a CD45RA+ TCD graft, followed by an adoptive natural killer (NK) cell infusion within 10 days after HSCT. The study's primary endpoint was the incidence of HHV-6B encephalitis. RESULTS Engraftment was achieved in 94.5% of cases; 2-year overall survival, event-free survival, and GvHD/relapse-free survival were 87.2% (95% CI 78.6-95.8), 67.3% (95% CI 53.1-81.5), and 64% (95% CI 50.5-78.1), respectively.

As the elimination of cuff inflation may shorten insertion time, the i-gel might be a useful tool in emergency situations requiring prompt airway care. This systematic review and meta-analysis of previous adult manikin studies for inexperienced personnel was performed to compare the i-gel with other supraglottic airways. METHODS We searched PubMed, the Cochrane Library, and EMBASE for eligible randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published before June 2015, including with a crossover design, using the following search terms: ""i-gel,"" ""igel,"" ""simulation,"" ""manikin,"" ""manikins,"" ""mannequin,"" and ""mannequins."" The primary outcomes of this review were device insertion time and the first-attempt success rate of insertion. RESULTS A total of 14 RCTs were included. At the initial assessment without difficult circumstances, the i-gel had a significantly shorter insertion time than the LMA Classic, LMA Fastrach, LMA Proseal, LMA Unique, laryngeal tube, Combitube, and EasyTube. However, a faster insertion time of the i-gel was not observed in comparisons with the LMA Supreme, aura-i, and air-Q. In addition, the i-gel did not show the better results for the insertion success rate when compared to other devices. CONCLUSION The findings of this meta-analysis indicated that inexperienced volunteers placed the i-gel more rapidly than other supraglottic airways with the exception of the LMA Supreme, aura-i, and air-Q in manikin studies. However, the quicker insertion time is clinically not relevant. The unapparent advantage regarding the insertion success rate and the inherent limitations of the simulation setting indicated that additional evidence is necessary to confirm these advantages of the i-gel in an emergency setting.","An, Jiwon; Nam, Sang Beom; Lee, Jong Seok; Lee, Jinae; Yoo, Hanna; Lee, Hye Mi; Kim, Min-Soo",Medicine,462,24

Remediation of organophosphorus pesticide polluted soil using microwave-activated persulfate (MW/PS) oxidation was investigated in this study, with parathion as the representative pesticide. Approximately 90 % of parathion was degraded after 90 min of MW/PS oxidation treatment, which was superior to those by single PS or MW treatment. Relatively greater performances for parathion degradation were obtained in a relatively larger PS dosage, higher microwave temperature, and lower organic matter content. Appropriate soil moisture favored parathion degradation in soil. SO4-, OH, O2-, and 1O2 generated in the MW/PS system all contributed to parathion degradation. Multiple spectroscopy analyses indicated that PO and PS bonds in parathion were destroyed after MW/PS oxidation, accompanied by generation of hydroxylated and carbonylated byproducts. The soil safety after parathion degradation was assessed via model prediction. Furthermore, MW/PS oxidation also exhibited great performance for degradation of other organophosphorus pesticides, including ethion, phorate, and terbufos.","Kan, Hongshuai; Wang, Tiecheng; Yu, Jinxian; Qu, Guangzhou; Zhang, Peng; Jia, Hanzhong; Sun, Hongwen",Journal of hazardous materials,462,1

Previous studies have linked cognitive control to electrophysiological fluctuations in the theta band and theta-gamma cross-frequency coupling (CFC) arising from the cingulate and frontal cortices. Yet, to date the behavioral consequences of different forms of theta-gamma CFC remain elusive. Here, we studied the behavioral effects of the theta-gamma CFC via transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) designed to stimulate the frontal and cingulate cortices in humans. Using a double-blind, randomized, repeated measures study design, 24 healthy participants were subjected to three active and one control CFC-tACS conditions. In the active conditions, 80 Hz gamma tACS was coupled to 4 Hz theta tACS. Specifically, in two of the active conditions, short gamma bursts were coupled to the delivered theta cycle to coincide with either its peaks or troughs. In the third active condition, the phase of a theta cycle modulated the amplitude of the gamma oscillation. In the fourth, control protocol, 80 Hz tACS was continuously superimposed over the 4 Hz tACS, therefore lacking any phase-specificity in the CFC. During the 20-minute of stimulation, the participants performed a Go/NoGo monetary reward- and punishment-based instrumental learning task. A Bayesian hierarchical logistic regression analysis revealed that relative to the control, the peak-coupled tACS had no effects on the behavioral performance, whereas the trough-coupled tACS and, to a lesser extent, amplitude-modulated tACS reduced performance in conflicting trials. Our results suggest that cognitive control depends on the phase-specificity of the theta-gamma CFC.Statement of significance This study investigated the behavioral effects of different forms of theta-gamma cross-frequency coupling in cognitive control. To this aim, we delivered cross-frequency transcranial alternating current stimulation over the cingulate and frontal cortices in humans. We found that when gamma tACS was coupled to the trough of theta tACS, the stimulation worsened the ability of healthy participants to employ cognitive control.

Risk Stratification for Workers during the Covid-19 Pandemic.",16.605036,7.0648537,2020-05-26,"The first order of DNA packaging is the nucleosome with the DNA wrapped around the histone octamer. This leaves the nucleosomal DNA with access restrictions, which impose a significant barrier to repair of damaged DNA. The efficiency of DNA repair has been related to nucleosome structure and chromatin status, which is modulated in part by post-translational modifications (PTMs) of histones. Numerous studies have suggested a role for acetylation of lysine at position 56 of the H3 histone (H3K56ac) in various DNA transactions, including the response to DNA damage and its association with human cancer. Biophysical studies have revealed that H3K56ac increases DNA accessibility by facilitating spontaneous and transient unwrapping motions of the DNA ends. However, how this acetylation mark modulates nucleosome structure and dynamics to promote accessibility to the damaged DNA for repair factors and other proteins is still poorly understood. Here, we utilize approximately 5-6 microseconds of atomistic molecular dynamics simulations to delineate the impact of H3K56 acetylation on the nucleosome structure and dynamics, and to elucidate how these nucleosome properties are further impacted when a bulky benzo[a]pyrene-derived DNA lesion is placed near the acetylation site. Our findings reveal that H3K56ac alone induces considerable disturbance to the histone-DNA/histone-histone interactions, and amplifies the distortions imposed by the presence of the lesion. Our work highlights the important role of H3K56 acetylation in response to DNA damage and depicts how access to DNA lesions by the repair machinery can be facilitated within the nucleosome via a key acetylation event.","Fu, Iwen; Geacintov, Nicholas E; Broyde, Suse",DNA repair,462,31

The predictive power of any single factor, however, is limited. We aimed to develop profiles of antidepressant response and remission based upon hierarchical combinations of baseline clinical and demographic factors. METHODS Using data from Level 1 of the Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression trial (STAR*D), in which 2,876 participants with MDD were treated with citalopram, a signal-detection analysis was performed to identify hierarchical predictive profiles for patients with different treatment outcome. An automated algorithm was used to determine the optimal predictive variables by evaluating sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value, and test efficiency. RESULTS Hierarchical combinations of baseline clinical and demographic factors yielded profiles that significantly predicted treatment outcome. In contrast to an overall 47% response rate in STAR*D Level 1, response rates of profiled patient subgroups ranged from 31 to 63%. In contrast to an overall remission rate of 28%, identified subsets of patients had a 12 to 55% probability of remission. The predictors of antidepressant treatment outcome most commonly incorporated into profiles were related to socioeconomic status (e.g., income, education), whereas indicators of depressive symptom type and severity, as well as comorbid clinical conditions, were useful but less powerful predictors. CONCLUSIONS Hierarchical profiles of demographic and clinical baseline variables categorized patients according to the likelihood they would benefit from a single antidepressant trial. Socioeconomic factors had greater predictive power than symptoms or other clinical factors, and profiles combining multiple factors were stronger predictors than individual factors alone.","Jain, Felipe A; Hunter, Aimee M; Brooks, John O; Leuchter, Andrew F",Depression and anxiety,462,19

Within 10 days of identification of the first healthcare worker infection, both hospitals had closed, and all patients were discharged or decanted to other facilities within the state. The entire hospital staff (approximately 1300 people) and their households (approximately 3000-4000 people) were furloughed for 14 days to halt the spread of infection. During the furlough period, a decommissioning, terminal clean and recommissioning process was undertaken alongside recovery and reorientation of the workforce to personal protective equipment. Within 4 days of closure, an Australian Defence Force and Australian Medical Assistance Team team opened the prioritised emergency department to provide emergency care for the local community, supported by modified diagnostic services. The decommissioning and cleaning rolled on over the ensuing month, in a predetermined priority order. As staff returned from quarantine, they recommissioned their clinical areas. The final ward, a modified medical isolation wing, reopened on day 29. ISSUE Disaster management activities may be grouped under four main headings: prevention, preparedness, response and recovery. There are many opportunities for improvement and learning, and this article focuses on the local response and recovery, describing the process undertaken from the perspective of a small management group. Authors CC, HE, TB and MW were on the ground during the decommissioning process, then managed aspects of the cleaning and recommissioning remotely from furlough.

In this report, we showed that BTV, through its non-structural protein NS3 (BTV-NS3), is able to activate the MAPK/ERK pathway as assessed by phosphorylation levels of ERK1/2 and the translation initiation factor eIF4E. By combining immunoprecipitation of BTV-NS3 and mass spectrometry analysis from both BTV-infected and NS3-transfected cells, we identified the serine/threonine-protein kinase B-Raf (BRAF), a crucial player of the MAPK/ERK pathway, as a new cellular interactor of BTV-NS3. BRAF silencing led to a significant decrease of the MAPK/ERK activation by BTV supporting a model where BTV-NS3 interacts with BRAF to activate this signaling cascade. This positive regulation acts independently of the role of BTV-NS3 in counteracting the induction of the IFN-α/β response. Furthermore, the intrinsic ability of BTV-NS3 to bind BRAF and activate the MAPK/ERK pathway is conserved throughout multiple serotypes/strains but appears to be specific to BTV compared to other members of Orbivirus genus. Inhibition of MAPK/ERK pathway with U0126 reduced viral titers, suggesting that BTV manipulates this pathway for its own replication. Altogether, our data provide molecular mechanisms that unravel new essential functions of NS3 during BTV infection.IMPORTANCE Bluetongue Virus (BTV) is responsible of the arthropod-borne disease Bluetongue (BT) transmitted to ruminants by blood-feeding midges. In this report, we found that BTV, through its non-structural protein NS3 (BTV-NS3), interacts with BRAF, a key component of the MAPK/ERK pathway. In response to growth factors, this pathway promotes cell survival and increases protein translation. We showed that BTV-NS3 enhances the MAPK/ERK pathway and this activation is BRAF-dependent. Treatment of MAPK/ERK pathway with the pharmacologic inhibitor U0126 impairs viral replication, suggesting that BTV manipulates this pathway for its own benefit. Our results illustrate, at the molecular level, how a single virulence factor has evolved to target a cellular function to increase its viral replication.","Kundlacz, Cindy; Pourcelot, Marie; Fablet, Aurore; Amaral Da Silva Moraes, Rayane; Léger, Thibaut; Morlet, Bastien; Viarouge, Cyril; Sailleau, Corinne; Turpaud, Mathilde; Gorlier, Axel; Breard, Emmanuel; Lecollinet, Sylvie; van Rijn, Piet A; Zientara, Stephan; Vitour, Damien; Caignard, Grégory",Journal of virology,462,1

The American College of Cardiology Foundation (ACCF) and the Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) collaborated to compare the rates of long-term survival after PCI and CABG. METHODS We linked the ACCF National Cardiovascular Data Registry and the STS Adult Cardiac Surgery Database to claims data from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services for the years 2004 through 2008. Outcomes were compared with the use of propensity scores and inverse-probability-weighting adjustment to reduce treatment-selection bias. RESULTS Among patients 65 years of age or older who had two-vessel or three-vessel coronary artery disease without acute myocardial infarction, 86,244 underwent CABG and 103,549 underwent PCI. The median follow-up period was 2.67 years. At 1 year, there was no significant difference in adjusted mortality between the groups (6.24% in the CABG group as compared with 6.55% in the PCI group; risk ratio, 0.95; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.90 to 1.00). At 4 years, there was lower mortality with CABG than with PCI (16.4% vs. 20.8%; risk ratio, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.76 to 0.82). Similar results were noted in multiple subgroups and with the use of several different analytic methods. Residual confounding was assessed by means of a sensitivity analysis. CONCLUSIONS In this observational study, we found that, among older patients with multivessel coronary disease that did not require emergency treatment, there was a long-term survival advantage among patients who underwent CABG as compared with patients who underwent PCI.

We hypothesized that evolving metabolic abnormalities during prolonged ICU stay are reflected by changing nutrient patterns in blood, urine and skeletal muscle, and that these patterns differ in patients with/without ICU-AW and between patients with/without sepsis. METHODS In a prospective single-center observational trial, we aim to recruit 100 critically ill patients (ICU length of stay ≥ 5 days) with severe sepsis/septic shock (""sepsis group"", n = 50) or severe head trauma/intracerebral hemorrhage (""CNS group"", n = 50). Patients will be sub-grouped for presence or absence of ICU-AW as determined by the Medical Research Council sum score. Blood and urine samples will be collected and subjected to comprehensive nutrient analysis at different time points by targeted quantitative mass spectrometric methods. In addition, changes in muscular tissue (biopsy, when available), muscular architecture (ultrasound), electrophysiology, body composition analyses (bioimpedance, cerebral magnetic resonance imaging), along with clinical status will be assessed. Patients will be followed-up for 180 and 360 days including assessment of quality of life. DISCUSSION Key objective of this trial is to assess changes in nutrient pattern in blood and urine over time in critically ill patients with/without ICU-AW by using quantitative nutrient analysis techniques.

How the interactions between these two critical systems contribute to post-CA outcome remains largely unknown. Using a mouse model of CA and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CA/CPR), we demonstrate that CA/CPR induced neuroinflammation in the brain, in particular, a marked increase in pro-inflammatory cytokines, which subsequently activated the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Importantly, this activation was associated with a severe immunosuppression phenotype after CA. The phenotype was characterized by a striking reduction in size of lymphoid organs accompanied by a massive loss of immune cells and reduced immune function of splenic lymphocytes. The mechanistic link between post-CA immunosuppression and the HPA axis was substantiated, as we discovered that glucocorticoid treatment, which mimics effects of the activated HPA axis, exacerbated post-CA immunosuppression, while RU486 treatment, which suppresses its effects, significantly mitigated lymphopenia and lymphoid organ atrophy and improved CA outcome. Taken together, targeting the HPA axis could be a viable immunomodulatory therapeutic to preserve immune homeostasis after CA/CPR and thus improve prognosis of post-resuscitation CA patients.","Zhao, Qiang; Shen, Yuntian; Li, Ran; Wu, Jiangbo; Lyu, Jingjun; Jiang, Maorong; Lu, Liping; Zhu, Minghua; Wang, Wei; Wang, Zhuoran; Liu, Qiang; Hoffmann, Ulrike; Karhausen, Jörn; Sheng, Huaxin; Zhang, Weiguo; Yang, Wei",Journal of cerebral blood flow and metabolism : official journal of the International Society of Cerebral Blood Flow and Metabolism,462,1

Using T-cell knockout (KO) mice adoptively reconstituted with splenocytes from immunologically naive mice, we examined the immune responses of an immune system derived from homeostatically proliferating (HP) T cells. HP cells mounted relatively normal acute CD8 T-cell responses to lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), but with altered T-cell receptor (TCR) repertoires, and they became functional memory cells capable of recall responses. Although homeostatic proliferation does not normally fully restore T-cell numbers, the CD8(+) T-cell pool was completely restored in T-cell KO mice after LCMV infection. CD4 T-cell responses were lower and not fully restored but seemed sufficient to allow for complete differentiation of CD8 memory T cells. The LCMV-immune HP mouse had an immune repertoire heavily biased with LCMV epitope-specific T cells with oligoclonal expansions. LCMV-immune HP mice had reduced cross-reactive and non-cross-reactive CD8 T-cell responses when challenged with a T cell-cross-reactive virus. Thus, whereas an HP immune system is capable of mounting relatively normal acute and memory CD8 T-cell responses, the narrowing of the T-cell repertoire may reduce immune responses to subsequently encountered pathogens.","Lin, Sue-Jane; Chen, Alex T; Welsh, Raymond M",Blood,462,1

These include dengue, Ebola, Marburg, Lassa fever, yellow fever and influenza viruses, cytomegalovirus and coronaviruses. There are currently seven human endemic coronaviruses, all of which cause respiratory diseases and bind to receptors found within the endothelium. The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that causes the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is highly infectious. Like its predecessor, SARS-CoV, it binds to angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2), which is expressed in many cell types, particularly in the lung, including endothelial cells. The initiation of a cytokine storm by the virus along with infection of endothelial cells leads to apoptosis and structural and functional changes that attenuate vascular integrity in many organs including the lungs, heart, liver and kidney. Endothelial damage also enhances the coagulation pathway leading to thrombus formation in major vessels and capillaries. Infection with SARS-CoV-2 has an adverse outcome for individuals with particular comorbid diseases, e.g. hypertension, obesity, type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. It is possible that this is due to the presence of pre-existing endothelial dysfunction and systemic inflammation in subjects with these diseases.

We analyzed the influence of food intake during hemodialysis on intradialytic hypotension. METHODS A total of 105 patients treated with chronic hemodialysis were observed for 8 weeks-4 weeks with a meal during hemodialysis and 4 weeks without a meal. FINDINGS A statistically significant decrease of hypotensive events (p < 0.001) and cramping episodes (p = 0.035) was observed during a 4-week period without a meal. Patients who were particularly susceptible to intradialytic hypotension were those who were diabetic, had low urinary excretion, and were treated with hemodialysis for a long time. On a follow up, there was a significant increase in serum albumin after 3 months (p = 0.01) and 6 months (p = 0.036) despite meal withdrawal during hemodialysis.

The novel compound STR-324 belongs to the DENKI pharmacological class. This first-in-human study evaluated safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of STR-324 in healthy male participants. METHODS This was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled ascending dosing study including two parts: in part 1, 30 participants received 0.004-11.475mg h-1 of STR-324 or placebo (ratio 4:1) by 4h intravenous infusion in a two-group, partial cross-over design with four treatment periods separated by one month wash-out, and in part 2, 48 participants divided into three groups received either the active drug (1.25-11.25mg h-1) or placebo (ratio 3:1) by 48h intravenous infusion. Safety and tolerability parameters, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamic effects on neurocognitive and neurophysiological tasks and on a nociceptive test battery were evaluated. RESULTS No clinically relevant changes in safety parameters were observed. All treatment-emergent adverse events were mild and transient. Pharmacokinetics of STR-324 could not be determined due to most concentrations being below quantifiable limits. STR-324 metabolite concentrations were measurable, showing dose proportionality of Cmax and AUCinf with an estimated T1/2 of 0.2-0.5h. Significant changes on pharmacodynamic parameters were observed, however these were not consistent or dose-dependent. CONCLUSION STR-324 displayed favourable safety and tolerability profiles at all doses up to 11.475mg h-1. Although pharmacokinetic characterisation of STR-324 was limited, dose proportionality could be assumed based on major metabolite data assayed as proxy. No clear effects on nociceptive thresholds or other pharmacodynamic measures were observed.","Moss, Laurence M; Berends, Cecile L; van Brummelen, Emilie M J; Kamerling, Ingrid M C; Klaassen, Erica S; Bergmann, Kirsten; Ville, Vanessa; Juarez-Perez, Victor; Benichou, Annie-Claude; Groeneveld, Geert Jan",British journal of clinical pharmacology,462,31

Materials & methods: National Health Interview Survey datasets (2011-2018) were reviewed and adult participants (≥18 years old) with a history of cancer diagnosis and complete information about virtual healthcare utilization (defined by [a] filling a prescription on the internet in the past 12 months and/or [b] communicating with a healthcare provider through email in the past 12 months) were included. Information about video-conferenced phone calls and telephone calls are not available in the National Health Interview Survey datasets; and thus, they were not examined in this study. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to evaluate factors associated with the utilization of virtual care tools. Results: A total of 25,121 participants were included in the current analysis; including 4499 participants (17.9%) who utilized virtual care in the past 12 months and 20,622 participants (82.1%) who did not utilize virtual care in the past 12 months. The following factors were associated with less utilization of virtual healthcare tools in multivariable logistic regression: older age (continuous odds ratio [OR] with increasing age: 0.987; 95% CI: 0.984-0.990), African-American race (OR for African American vs white race: 0.608; 95% CI: 0.517-0.715), unmarried status (OR for unmarried compared with married status: 0.689; 95% CI: 0.642-0.739), lower level of education (OR for education ≤high school vs >high school: 0.284; 95% CI: 0.259-0.311), weaker English proficiency (OR for no proficiency vs very good proficiency: 0.224; 95% CI: 0.091-0.552) and lower yearly earnings (OR for earnings <$45,000 vs earnings >$45,000: 0.582; 95% CI: 0.523-0.647). Conclusion: Older patients, those with African-American race, lower education, lower earnings and weak English proficiency are less likely to access the above studied virtual healthcare tools.

The main purpose of this scoping review is to summarize existing literature regarding the bioethical dilemmas when a conflict arises in the maternal-fetus dyad, like the one related to cancer and pregnancy outcomes. Moreover, we illustrate the decision-making process of real-life case reports. Published data were searched through the PubMed and Google Scholar databases, as well as in grey literature, using appropriate controlled keywords in English and Portuguese. After identification, screening, eligibility and data extraction from the articles, a total of 50 was selected. There are several established ethical frameworks for conflict resolution and decision-making. Pragmatic theoretical approaches include case-based analysis, the ethics of care, feminist theory, and traditional ethical principlism that scrutinizes the framework of autonomy, justice, beneficence, and non-maleficence. In addition, society and practitioner values could mediate this complex ethical interplay. The physician must balance autonomy and beneficence-based obligations to the pregnant woman with cancer, along with beneficence-based obligations to the fetus. Ethical challenges have received less attention in the literature, particularly before the third trimester of pregnancy. Best, unbiased and balanced information must be granted both to the patient and to the family, regarding the benefits and harms for the woman herself as well as for the fetal outcome. Based on a previously validated method for analyzing and working up clinical ethical problems, we suggest an adaptation of an algorithm for biomedical decision-making in cancer during pregnancy, including recommendations that can facilitate counseling and help reduce the suffering of the patient and her family.","Alpuim Costa, Diogo; Nobre, José Guilherme; de Almeida, Susana Baptista; Ferreira, Marisa Horta; Gonçalves, Inês; Braga, Sofia; Pais, Diogo",Frontiers in oncology,462,17

Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) plays an important role in understanding the phenotypes and treatment of AR. However, there are currently no normative clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) for the treatment of AR in children. The study aimed to develop an evidence-based CPG for the treatment of AR in children with TCM. Systematic literature research, expert questionnaire, and clinical evaluation after three rounds of surveys were adopted to form recommendations for treating children with AR using the Delphi method. Depending on the clinical manifestations, we finally recommended two decoctions with two Chinese patent medicines for an acute attack of AR and two decoctions for a chronic period of AR. For the acute attack of AR in children, Xinyi Qingfei decoction, Wenfei Zhiliu decoction, Xinqin granules, and Xinyi Biyan pills were suggested, whereas for the chronic period of AR, Buzhong Yiqi and Jingui Shenqi decoctions were recommended. The four external treatment methods suggested for the prevention and care of AR were body acupuncture, moxibustion, auricular point pressing, and acupoint application. The recommended levels of the suggested TCM strategies ranged from Grade B to D, indicating the weakness of the recommendations. TCM has the potential to offer new insights into phenotypes and the management of AR worldwide; however, more high-quality clinical studies are needed to improve the quality of evidence.","Feng, Lu; Lin, Lili; Wang, Shouchuan; Zhao, Xia; Dai, Qigang; Wang, Lei; Yang, Yan; Xu, Ling; Liu, Yuling; An, Li; Shen, Cunsi",Anatomical record,462,20

We sought to determine whether this form of asthma is characterised by any unique physiological features. Methods Spirometry, body plethysmography, multiple breath nitrogen washout (MBNW) and methacholine challenge were performed in four subject groups: Lean Control (n=11), Lean Asthma (n=11), Obese Control (n=11) and LONA Obese Asthma (n=10). The MBNW data were fitted with a novel computational model that estimates functional residual capacity (FRC), dead space volume (VD), the coefficient of variation of regional specific ventilation (CV,V'E) and a measure of structural asymmetry at the level of the acinus (sacin). Results Body mass index and waist circumference values were similar in both obese groups, and significantly greater than in lean asthmatic individuals and controls. Forced vital capacity was significantly lower in the LONA Asthma group compared with the other groups (p<0.001). Both asthma groups exhibited similar hyperresponsiveness to methacholine. FRC was reduced in the Obese LONA Asthma group as measured by MBNW, but not in obese controls, whereas FRC was reduced in both obese groups as measured by plethysmography. VD, CV,V'E and sacin were not different between groups. Conclusions Chronic lung compression characterises all obese subjects, as reflected by reduced plethysmographic FRC. Obese LONA asthma is characterised by a reduced ability to recruit closed lung units, as seen by reduced MBNW FRC, and an increased tendency for airway closure as seen by a reduced forced vital capacity.","Dixon, Anne E; Peters, Ubong; Walsh, Ryan; Daphtary, Nirav; MacLean, Erick S; Hodgdon, Kevin; Kaminsky, David A; Bates, Jason H T",ERJ open research,462,1

In patients in whom there are indications to perform a laparoscopic renal biopsy, LESS surgery is a valid alternative to mini invasive surgery and is becoming more common. We report our experience on 14 renal biopsy procedures performed in a retroperitoneal LESS. METHODS LESS renal biopsy was performed in 14 patients 18 to 80 years old (mean age 58.3 years) during a 36 month period. All procedures were performed by a single operator. The patient was in a standard flank position. The procedure was performed using a 2.5 cm, single incision via a retroperitoneal access at the Petit's triangle. A 5 mm biopsy forceps was used to collect the specimen under direct vision, and haemostasis was obtained with an Argon beam probe and the application of oxidized regenerated cellulose gauze. RESULTS Biopsy was performed successfully in all cases. Mean operative time was 52.64 min, blood loss was minimal, and the hospital stay ranged from 12 to 24 hours. None of the patients required narcotics or additional analgesia in the postoperative period. No postoperative complications occurred. CONCLUSIONS The LESS technique is safe, reliable (100% success), easy to learn, and offers subjective cosmetic benefits to the patient. Minimal hospitalization requirement following retroperitoneal LESS biopsy is an additional timely advantage over laparoscopic renal biopsy. We think that with the right indications (marked obesity, failure of previous percutaneous biopsy attempts, a solitary kidney and coagulopathy) LESS renal biopsy is a good alternative to laparoscopy. Our next step will be a randomized prospective study of LESS compared with laparoscopy for renal biopsy to support our findings.","Micali, Salvatore; Zordani, Alessio; Galli, Riccardo; Martorana, Eugenio; Piccoli, Micaela; Cappelli, Gianni; Bianchi, Giampaolo",BMC urology,462,16

Tantrum was detected in 34% and mood swings in 30% of children. The majority of parents (77.8%) considered that distance education does not guarantee children's education and that the level of learning acquired through online classes is not the same as that of face-to-face education (83.5%). In contrast, 70.6% of parents considered that it is not yet time to reopen schools, 78.8% believed that there is sufficient evidence to keep them closed, and 45% indicated that it is better not to return to campus this year.

However, scanning for associations of drugs and adverse events that occur less frequently than expected provides hypotheses for drug repurposing, i.e. a known drug could be therapeutically beneficial for a new indication like the coronavirus disease (COVID-19). As coronavirus related adverse events are scarce in pharmacovigilance data prior to 2020, we searched for drugs suitable against similar viral diseases. METHODS In this observational, retrospective, pharmacovigilance study, drugs associated with viral respiratory tract infections and/or diseases caused by RNA-viruses, which are phylogenetically similar to SARS-CoV-2, were extracted from the U.S. FAERS pharmacovigilance data 2004Q1 to 2020Q2 using OpenVigil 2.1-MedDRA17, filtered for significant inverse associations (ROR<1 and padj <0.05), checked for implausibility (e.g., only topically) or clinical infeasibility (e.g., strong cytotoxic effects), and categorised by their WHO Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classification code. RESULTS A total of 126 drugs were identified. ATC clustering of the manually curated list of 112 candidate drugs revealed female sex hormones, anti-diabetics, neuropharmacological sigma-receptor modulators, peptidase inhibitors, antiviral drugs, nicotinic acetylcholine receptor agonists, and tyrosine kinase inhibitors as putatively antiviral. CONCLUSION Scanning for inverse signals in pharmacovigilance data provides new hypotheses for drug repurposing, theoretically for all indications. Concerning the treatment of viral respiratory infections, there is affirmative data for some candidate drugs; the remaining proposed candidate drugs without already known antiviral mechanism of action should stimulate further exploration.","Böhm, Ruwen; Bulin, Claudia; Waetzig, Vicki; Cascorbi, Ingolf; Klein, Hans-Joachim; Herdegen, Thomas",British journal of clinical pharmacology,462,31

AIM The purpose of this scoping review was to provide an overview of existing literature on midwifery practice, education, and regulation in MENA countries in the context of ICM standards. METHODS A search was conducted inclusive of English and Persian written studies published between 2000 and 2019 in CINAHL plus; Ovid MEDLINE; PubMed; Scopus; and grey literature. Title and abstract and full-text review were performed in Covidence, and data extraction and synthesis performed using NVivo 12. RESULTS The initial search identified 7,994 articles. Overall, 139 studies were included in the review. Although, the primary concept of most included studies was ""midwifery practice"", ""midwifery regulation"" was addressed in limited way. Approximately 90% were from Middle Eastern countries. Forty-two per cent of studies used cross-sectional designs, and most originated from Iran, Jordan, and Palestine. Diversity was found in midwifery education, practice and regulation across the MENA countries. Midwives from different nations had uneven levels of proﬁciency, scope of practice, and education. Midwifery curricula were aligned with ICM competencies in some countries. Most countries had midwifery associations and were members of ICM. Some countries had regulations recognising midwifery as an autonomous profession. CONCLUSION Midwifery practice, education and regulation in MENA countries were not always comparable with ICM standards, although some progress was evident.","Safari, Kolsoom; McKenna, Lisa; Davis, Jenny",Women and birth : journal of the Australian College of Midwives,462,8

The role of endovascular surgery in traumatic iliac lesions is unclear. The aim of this study is to compare outcomes for open versus endovascular management of traumatic iliac injuries. MATERIALS AND METHODS The National Trauma Data Bank was searched for patients from 2002to 2016 with iliac arterial injury. Patients were sorted by treatment modality (open versus endo) and mechanism (blunt versus penetrating) and matched using mangled extremity score variables. The proportion of patients undergoing amputation were compared using the chi-square test. RESULTS In the blunt group, 1550 (82%) had endovascular and 342 (18%) had open repair. Endovascular repair was associated with a significantly lower amputation rate than open repair (0.6% versus 3.6%, P = 0.015) despite higher incidence of concomitant injuries. Venous injury was more frequent in the open group (13.7% versus 1.8%, P < 0.001). Within the penetrating group, 209 (22%) had endovascular and 755 (78%) had open repair. Again endovascular repair was associated with a lower amputation rate (0% versus 5.1%, P = 0.004). Patients undergoing endovascular repair had more severe extremity/orthopedic injury, with venous injury again associated with open repair (48.5% versus 37.4%, P = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS Endovascular repair of iliac injuries was associated with a significantly lower rate of amputation than open surgery. Endovascular repair was associated with a higher incidence of several injuries, although open repair was associated with concomitant venous injury. Further work is required to delineate the benefit of endovascular intervention and role of venous injury in limb salvage.","Abdou, Hossam; Kundi, Rishi; DuBose, Joseph J; Scalea, Thomas M; Morrison, Jonathan J; Ottochian, Marcus",The Journal of surgical research,462,30

The study seeks to identify the dysfunction pattern in suicide brain for BD-II patients. METHODS Graph theory was utilized to explore topological properties at whole-brain, module and region levels based on resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) data, which acquired from 38 un-medicated BD-II patients with at least one SA, 60 none SA (NSA) patients and 69 healthy controls (HCs). Finally, the correlation relationship between graph metrics and clinical variables were estimated. RESULTS Compared with NSA patients and HCs, the functional connectivity strength between limbic/sub-cortical (LIMB/SubC) and frontoparietal network (FPN) were significantly weakened. Nodal strength in left head of caudate nucleus (HCN), raphe nucleus (RN), right nucleus accumbens (NAcc), right subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (sgACC) and nodal efficiency in right sgACC, right HCN for SA patients were significantly reduced relative to NSA and HCs. In particular, nodal strength in RN and nodal efficiency in right sgACC showed a significant negative correlation with Nurses' Global Assessment of Suicide Risk (NGASR) scores. LIMITATIONS This is a single-mode cross-sectional study, the results were not verified by multi-center data. CONCLUSIONS The abnormal disrupted FC between LIMB/SubC and FPN is associated with SA in BD-II patients, which increased the susceptibility of suicide. Especially, the dysfunction in RN and right sgACC predict a higher suicide risk in BD-II patients.The results can help us to understand the suicide mechanism and early judgment of suicidal behaviors for BD-II patients.","Wang, Huan; Zhu, Rongxin; Dai, Zhongpeng; Tian, Shui; Shao, Junneng; Wang, Xinyi; Sun, Yurong; Chen, Zhilu; Li, Xuesong; Yao, Zhijian; Lu, Qing",Journal of affective disorders,462,29

METHODS A retrospective chart review was conducted of electronic medical records, ED visits, and hospital admissions during Ramadan, Hajj, and all other months over a three-year period on the Hijra calendar (1438-1440) or Gregorian (2016-2019). Primary outcomes were the change in the number of ED visits, hospital admissions, and intensive care unit (ICU) admissions during Ramadan in comparison to during Hajj and other months. Secondary outcomes included mortality; number of surgeries by specialty; and admissions to cardiac, respiratory, orthopedic, and neurosurgery wards. RESULTS During the three years, ED visits increased during Ramadan by 83.0%, 74.8%, and 40.3%, respectively, when compared to non-Hajj, non-Ramadan months. Hospital admissions rose by 21.05%, 50.96% and 48.22%. Combined ED and in-hospital mortality rose by 15.21%, 21.47%, and 1.39%. While there was a large increase in ICU admissions during Ramadan of 1440 (May 2019), this was not a trend seen in other years. Despite there only being two years of data for comparison, there was a trend towards increased admissions to all specialty wards. There was an average 46.69% increase in admissions to the general surgery ward during Ramadan months compared to other months, a 31.06% increase in admissions to the orthopedic surgery ward, and a 44.05% increase in admissions to the cardiac care unit. CONCLUSIONS Ramadan is associated with a significant increase in the population of Makkah (Mecca), Saudi Arabia. Despite this study only focusing on a three-year period, and some variables with only two years of data available, it demonstrates a significant increase in ED visits, hospital admissions, and mortality during Ramadan compared to non-Hajj/non-Ramadan months. During mass gatherings of this size, it would benefit local and regional hospital systems to devote increased resources to patient care, especially to the ED, to prevent morbidity and mortality.","Almalki, Yousef; Hart, Alexander; Issa, Fadi; Hertelendy, Attila J; Mahon, Selwyn; Voskanyan, Amalia; Ciottone, Gregory R",Prehospital and disaster medicine,462,7

A diagnostic accuracy study.,16.67884,7.2177243,2016,"OBJECTIVE The main concern during transfemoral carotid artery stenting (CAS) is preventing cerebral embolus dislodgement. We compared clinical outcomes and intraprocedural embolization rates of CAS using a distal filter protection device or proximal balloon occlusion device. METHODS From January 2011 to March 2015, a series of 58 patients with symptomatic or asymptomatic internal carotid artery stenosis ≥70% were treated with CAS with embolic protection device in single center. All patients underwent post-CAS diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) to detect new ischemic lesions. We compared clinical outcomes and postprocedural embolization rates. RESULTS CAS was performed in all 61 patients. Distal filter protection success rate was 96.6% (28/29), whose mean age was 70.9 years, and mean stenosis was 81%. Their preprocedural infarction rate was 39% (11/28). Subsequent DW-MRI revealed 96 new ischemic lesions in 71% (20/28) patients. In contrast, the proximal balloon occlusion device success rate was 93.8% (30/32), whose mean age was 68.8 years and mean stenosis was 86%. Preprocedure infarction rate was 47% (14/30). DW-MRI revealed 45 new ischemic lesions in 57% (17/30) patients. Compared with distal filter protection device, proximal balloon occlusion device resulted in fewer ischemic lesions per patient (p=0.028). In each group, type of stent during CAS had no significant effect on number of periprocedural embolisms. Only 2 neurologic events occurred in the successfully treated patients (one from each group). CONCLUSION Transfemoral CAS with proximal balloon occlusion device achieves good results. Compared with distal filter protection, proximal balloon occlusion might be more effective in reducing cerebral embolism during CAS.","Lee, Jong Hyeok; Sohn, Hee Eon; Chung, Seung Young; Park, Moon Sun; Kim, Seong Min; Lee, Do Sung",Journal of Korean Neurosurgical Society,462,31

MATERIALS AND METHODS From January 2012 to July 2014, local excision was performed using a TEO system in 46 consecutive patients with rectal tumors. Patient and tumor characteristics and perioperative outcomes were prospectively assessed. RESULTS The median patient age was 56 years for 15 women and 31 men. The mean tumor size was 1.8 cm, and the mean distance from the anal verge was 7.8 cm. The mean operative time was 85 minutes, and the mean postoperative hospital stay was 4.5 days. The postoperative pathologic diagnosis was adenocarcinoma for 17 patients (37%), adenoma for 4 patients (9%), carcinoid tumor for 23 patients (50%), and leiomyoma and lipoma for the 2 remaining patients (2%). A positive resection margin was documented for 4 patients (9%). No mortality was associated with the procedure although postoperative bleeding, leakage, perianal fistula, fecal incontinence, and voiding difficulty developed in 8 patients. According to the cumulative sum (CUSUM) analysis, the operation time and hospital stay significantly decreased after 17 case experiences. CONCLUSIONS TEO is a feasible and safe treatment option for local excision of rectal tumors. TEO has the advantage of being a precise surgical procedure with a stable and magnifying endoscopic view. However, TEO requires a learning period and a careful selection of patients through proper indications and preoperative diagnostics.","Hur, Hyuk; Bae, Sung Uk; Han, Yoon Dae; Kang, Jeonghyun; Min, Byung Soh; Baik, Seung Hyuk; Lee, Kang Young; Kim, Nam Kyu","Surgical laparoscopy, endoscopy & percutaneous techniques",462,16

Cherry laurel (Laurocerasus officinalis Roem.) fruit is rich in vitamins and phenolic compounds with antioxidant effect. The aim of this study was to investigate how effective its extract would be against dimethoate-induced testis and sperm damage in rats. Sixty animals were divided in six groups of 10. Group 1 (control) received only 1 mL of saline (0.9 % NaCl). Group 2 received 7 mg/kg of dimethoate in 1 mL of saline. Group 3 received 4 mg/kg of extract in 1 mL of saline. Group 4 received the extract 30 min before dimethoate administration. Group 5 received vitamin C (positive control, 100 mg/kg in 1 mL of saline) 30 min before dimethoate administration. Group 6 received only dimethoate for the first four weeks and then a combination of dimethoate and extract for another four weeks. All doses were administered daily by oral gavage. After eight weeks of treatment, the rats were euthanised and their reproductive organs removed. We took their body and reproductive organ weights and evaluated testicular oxidative stress, semen characteristics, sperm DNA damage, testicular apoptosis, and histopathological changes. Dimethoate significantly decreased body and reproductive organ weights, sperm motility and concentration, testicular superoxide dismutase, and glutathione-peroxidase activities and significantly increased lipid peroxidation, abnormal sperm rate, sperm DNA damage, testicular apoptosis, and caused histopathological lesions. Cherry laurel extract significantly countered many dimethoate-induced adverse effects, both as pre- and post-treatment, including reproductive organ weight, semen parameters, oxidant-antioxidant balance, sperm DNA integrity, testicular apoptosis, and histological structure. Our findings clearly suggest that the beneficial effects of the extract are associated with countering oxidative stress, lipid peroxidation in particular.","Bakır, Elçin; Sarıözkan, Serpil; Endirlik, Burcu Ünlü; Kılıç, Ayşe Baldemir; Yay, Arzu Hanım; Tan, Fazile Cantürk; Eken, Ayşe; Türk, Gaffari",Arhiv za higijenu rada i toksikologiju,462,1

Mitochondria are key organelles that act as a hub for vital metabolic processes, for example, energy transduction by oxidative phosphorylation, intermediary metabolism, redox signaling, calcium and iron homeostasis, heme and steroid biosynthesis, metal homeostasis, programmed cell death, and innate immunity. Consequently, a wide assortment of diseases-including neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, cancer, rare syndromes, and many others-relate to mitochondrial dysfunction. The high relevance of mitochondria in metabolism centers on the core of cell signaling pathways, including those involved in cell-fate decisions. Critical metabolites synthesized in mitochondria are, for instance, key modulators of the sirtuin, AMPK, mTOR, and Hypoxia-inducible Factor 1A pathways. Mitochondria are indeed the major source of reactive oxygen species, which in turn mediate several regulatory routes. Interestingly, multiple nuclear-encoded factors control essential processes in mitochondrial dynamics, namely fusion (for instance, OPA1), fission (DNM1L), transport (RHOT1), and mitophagy (PINK1). The release of mitochondrial factors like cytochrome c to the cytoplasm is indeed key for the rapid onset of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway. The CrossMitoNus meeting aims to join efforts from diverse disciplines to unveil the mitochondrial and nuclear factors that are emerging as essential elements in mitochondria-nucleus communication. Needless to say, the mechanisms regulating mitochondrial protein trafficking into and out of the nucleus and the role of these proteins in the nucleus remain to be elucidated.","Díaz-Moreno, Irene; De la Rosa, Miguel A",IUBMB life,462,7

DESIGN Overview of systematic reviews (SRs) using Revised-AMSTAR approach to assess quality. DATA SOURCES Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, MEDLINE, Embase, PubMed, Scopus and PROSPERO to June 2017. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR SELECTING STUDIES SRs of randomised control trials (RCTs) or individual patient data (IPD) from RCTs, examining the effectiveness of statins versus placebo or no treatment on all-cause mortality, coronary heart disease, CVD (including stroke) and composite endpoints, with stratification by baseline risk and gender. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Two independent reviewers extracted data and assessed methodological quality. A narrative synthesis was conducted. RESULTS Three SRs were included. Quality of included SRs was mixed, and none reported on the risk of bias of included trials.We found trends towards reduced all-cause mortality in all SRs (RR 0.91 [95% CI 0.85 to 0.97]), (RR 0.91 [95% CI 0.83 to 1.01]) and (RR 0.78 [95% CI 0.53 to 1.15]) though it was not statistically significant in two SRs. When stratified by baseline risk, the effect on all-cause mortality was no longer statistically significant except in one medium risk category. One review reported significant reductions (RR 0.85 [95% CI 0.77 to 0.95]) in vascular deaths and non-significant reductions in non-vascular deaths (RR 0.97 [95% CI 0.88 to 1.07]). There were significant reductions in composite outcomes overall, but mixed results were reported in these when stratified by baseline risk. These reviews included studies with participants considered risk equivalent to those with established CVD. CONCLUSIONS There is limited evidence on the effectiveness of statins for primary prevention with mixed findings from studies including participants with widely ranging baseline risks. Decision making for the use of statins should consider individual baseline risk, absolute risk reduction and whether risk reduction justifies potential harms and taking a daily medicine for life.

To assess early impacts, we investigated trends in, and factors associated with, HCV viraemia among people who inject drugs (PWID). We also examined trends in self-reported treatment access. Bio-behavioural data from an annual, national surveillance survey of PWID (2011 to 2018) estimated trends in viraemic prevalence among HCV antibody-positive PWID. Multivariable logistic regression identified characteristics independently associated with viraemia. Trends in treatment access were examined for PWID with known infection. Between 2011 and 2016, viraemic prevalence among antibody-positive PWID remained stable (2011, 57.7%; 2016, 55.8%) but decreased in 2017 (49.4%) and 2018 (50.4%) (both p<0.001). After adjustment for demographic and behavioural characteristics, there remained significant reduction in viraemia in 2017 (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 0.79, 95%CI 0.65-0.94) and 2018 (aOR 0.79, 95%CI 0.66-0.93) compared to 2016. Other factors associated with viraemia were male gender (aOR 1.68, 95%CI 1.53-1.86), geographical region, injecting in past year (aOR 1.26, 95%CI 1.13-1.41), imprisonment (aOR 1.14, 95%CI 1.04-1.31) and homelessness (aOR 1.17, 95%CI 1.04-1.31).

Population growth and climatic variability are exuberating the impact on surface and underground water supply. Understanding the causes and the extent of water vulnerability is required for developing effective strategies for water insecurities. This study attempts to assess the water vulnerability across different wards of a touristic city of Himalaya-Nainital using IPCC approach considering the three dimensions: exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity. Seven indicators, mostly spatial, i.e. edaphic (aspect, elevation) and climatic (land surface temperature) besides some water infrastructural (distance to water distribution) and population, were considered for development of vulnerability index using Analytical Hierarchy Process for assigning weights. These indicators were simple to extract and easy to obtain and mostly available from secondary sources and were capable to account the variability at micro-level. Moreover, the current adaptation mechanisms for water security were also derived through conducting surveys by randomly selecting households across the wards. Staff House and Harinagar wards were the most vulnerable. The survey results that the adaptation mechanism should be managed at individual and organization level. Policy measures such as optimum use of water, grey water recycling, spring rejuvenation, rain water harvesting, and leakage proof infrastructure with intervention of new technologies, may be adopted and implemented for reducing the water vulnerability in the city along with the public participation. The appropriate measures for water vulnerability would further provide support for improving the facilities to the tourists in the city thereby improved economic opportunities to the locals.","Chauhan, Disha; Thiyaharajan, Muthuprasad; Pandey, Anvita; Singh, Nidhi; Singh, Vishal; Sen, Sumit; Pandey, Rajiv",Environmental science and pollution research international,462,12

A peritoneoscopy was performed through the gastrotomy. In four pigs, gastrotomy was repaired with an endoscopic suturing device (OverStitch™, Apollo Medical). Full-thickness suturing was started at the edges of the incision, and a figure-of-eight pattern was used. A dedicated helical tissue grasper combined with endoscopic suction was used to retract incision borders and ensure full-thickness closure. Sutures were locked using a cinching device. In two pigs, the gastrotomy was closed laparoscopically and served as a control. An air leak test was performed. On postoperative day 10 (POD 10), all pigs underwent endoscopy and laparotomy and were euthanized. RESULTS Mean endoscopic suturing time was 57.5 ± 14.15 min, and four to six sutures were delivered per incision. Laparoscopic suturing time was 8 min. All leak tests were negative. No intraoperative or postoperative complications occurred. On POD 10, all gastrotomies were healed. In one animal, thick adhesions were found surrounding the suture site but no leak was identified. CONCLUSIONS Full-thickness suturing of experimental gastrotomies using the OverStitch™ device is feasible and effective.","Halvax, Peter; Diana, Michele; Lègner, Andras; Lindner, Véronique; Liu, Yu-Yin; Nagao, Yoshihiro; Cho, Sungwoo; Marescaux, Jacques; Swanström, Lee L",Surgical endoscopy,462,1

METHODS Files of patients with acute ischemic symptoms due to ICA occlusions managed from August 2010 to August 2016 by urgent endovascular revascularization were retrospectively reviewed with a waiver of informed consent. Cases where there was escalation to stiff tipped cardiovascular microguidewires after at least two failed attempts to cross the carotid occlusion with standard neuro-microguidewires were included. Radiological and interventional data were recorded. RESULTS 63 patients with acute carotid occlusions underwent emergent endovascular revascularization in the study period; 5/63 patients met the inclusion criteria. In 4/5 patients, there was no angiographic evidence of the remnant origin of the ICA; in 1/5 there was a wide round shaped proximal calcified cap that precluded soft guidewire entry. In all cases, antegrade wiring was achieved only after switching to stiffer guidewires designed for the management of chronic cardiac occlusions. The use of these stiffer tip wires was considered of critical importance in achieving the successful performance of the ICA revascularization procedure. In all patients, revascularization was achieved, and 90 day modified Rankin Scale score ranged from 0 to 2. CONCLUSIONS When regular neuro-guidewires do not allow antegrade wiring in cases of ICA occlusion, wire escalation to high tip stiffness guidewires may improve success. These wires, designed to deal with chronic total coronary occlusions, can serve as a platform for new neuro-guidewires to be used in the challenging field of resistant supra-aortic occlusions.","Cohen, José E; Leker, Ronen R; Gomori, John M; Itshayek, Eyal",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,462,1

METHODS The derivation cohort consisted of patients with AIS enrolled prospectively at the University Hospital Basel, Switzerland. The validation cohort was prospectively enrolled after the derivation cohort at the University Hospital of Bern and University Hospital Basel, Switzerland, as well as Frankfurt a.M., Germany. The score components were copeptin levels, age, NIH Stroke Scale, and recanalization therapy (CoRisk score). Copeptin levels were measured in plasma drawn within 24 hours of AIS and before any recanalization therapy. The primary outcome of disability and death at 3 months was defined as modified Rankin Scale score of 3 to 6. RESULTS Overall, 1,102 patients were included in the analysis; the derivation cohort contributed 319 patients, and the validation cohort contributed 783. An unfavorable outcome was observed among 436 patients (40%). For the 3-month prediction of disability and death, the CoRisk score was well calibrated in the validation cohort, for which the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.819 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.787-0.849). The calibrated CoRisk score correctly classified 75% of patients (95% CI 72-78). The net reclassification index between the calibrated CoRisk scores with and without copeptin was 46% (95% CI 32-60). CONCLUSIONS The biomarker-based CoRisk score for the prediction of disability and death was externally validated, was well calibrated, and performed better than the same score without copeptin.

This study was conducted to determine the economic impact of the MERS outbreak on the tourism and travel-related service sectors, including accommodation, food and beverage, and transportation, in the ROK. We projected monthly numbers of noncitizen arrivals and indices of services for 3 travel-related service sectors during and after the MERS outbreak (June 2015 to June 2016) using seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average models. Tourism losses were estimated by multiplying the monthly differences between projected and actual numbers of noncitizen arrivals by average tourism expenditure per capita. Estimated tourism losses were allocated to travel-related service sectors to understand the distribution of losses across service sectors. The MERS outbreak was correlated with a reduction of 2.1 million noncitizen visitors corresponding with US$2.6 billion in tourism loss for the ROK. Estimated losses in the accommodation, food and beverage service, and transportation sectors associated with the decrease of noncitizen visitors were US$542 million, US$359 million, and US$106 million, respectively. The losses were demonstrated by lower than expected indices of services for the accommodation and food and beverage service sectors in June and July 2015 and for the transportation sector in June 2015. The results support previous findings that public health emergencies due to traveler-associated outbreaks of infectious diseases can cause significant losses to the broader economies of affected countries.","Joo, Heesoo; Maskery, Brian A; Berro, Andre D; Rotz, Lisa D; Lee, Yeon-Kyeng; Brown, Clive M",Health security,462,31

We hypothesize that patients who develop stroke while hospitalized for severe COVID-19 will have higher inflammatory markers and distinct stroke imaging patterns compared with patients positive for COVID-19 with out-of-hospital stroke onset and milder or no COVID-19 symptoms. MATERIALS AND METHODS This is a retrospective case series of patients positive for COVID-19 on polymerase chain reaction testing with imaging-confirmed stroke treated within a large health care network in New York City and Long Island between March 14 and April 26, 2020. Clinical and laboratory data collected retrospectively included complete blood counts and creatinine, alanine aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase, C-reactive protein, ferritin, and D-dimer levels. All CT and MR imaging studies were independently reviewed by 2 neuroradiologists who recorded stroke subtype and patterns of infarction and intracranial hemorrhage. RESULTS Compared with patients with COVID-19 with outside-of-hospital stroke onset and milder or no COVID-19 symptoms (n = 45, 52.3%), patients with stroke already hospitalized for severe COVID-19 (n = 41, 47.7%) had significantly more frequent infarctions (95.1% versus 73.3%, P = .006), with multivascular distributions (56.4% versus 33.3%, P = .022) and associated hemorrhage (31.7% versus 4.4%, P = .001). Patients with stroke admitted with more severe COVID-19 had significantly higher C-reactive protein and ferritin levels, elevated D-dimer levels, and more frequent lymphopenia and renal and hepatic injury (all, P < .003). CONCLUSIONS Patients with stroke hospitalized with severe COVID-19 are characterized by higher inflammatory, coagulopathy, and tissue-damage biomarkers, supporting proposed pathogenic mechanisms of hyperinflammation activating a prothrombotic state. Cautious balancing of thrombosis and the risk of hemorrhagic transformation is warranted when considering anticoagulation.","Katz, J M; Libman, R B; Wang, J J; Filippi, C G; Sanelli, P; Zlochower, A; Gribko, M; Pacia, S V; Kuzniecky, R I; Najjar, S; Azhar, S",AJNR.

While penicillin remains the only appropriate treatment for maternal syphilis, we hypothesized that low non-treponemal titers (<1:16) may lead to reduced penicillin treatment in Brazil. METHODS Using Brazilian Ministry of Health data on women diagnosed with maternal syphilis between January 1, 2010 and December 31, 2018, we conducted a random effects logistic regression model with a cluster correction at the state level to evaluate predictive factors of penicillin treatment. RESULTS We observed yearly increases in cases of pregnant women with syphilis from 2010-2018. There was significant variation by state: 52,451 cases were reported in São Paulo, followed by 26,838 in Rio de Janeiro. Among 215,937 cases of maternal syphilis, 91·3% received penicillin. In the random effects model, a non-treponemal titer ≥1:16 was associated with 1·44 higher odds of receiving penicillin (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1·39,1·48), and pre-natal care was associated with a 2·12 increased odds of receiving penicillin (95% CI: 2·02,2·21). Although there is an association between absence of pre-natal care and inadequate treatment for syphilis, 83·2% of women in this cohort who did not receive penicillin were engaged in pre-natal care. CONCLUSIONS Providers may inappropriately exclude low non-treponemal titers and thereby fail to use penicillin treatment in maternal syphilis. While the cause of the maternal syphilis epidemic in Brazil is multifactorial, we believe our findings can be used to develop targeted interventions throughout Brazil as well as shape public health initiatives globally.","Swayze, Emma Jane; Nielsen-Saines, Karin; Segura, Eddy R; Saad, Eduardo; Yue, Dahai; Comulada, Warren Scott; Cambou, Mary Catherine",International journal of infectious diseases : IJID : official publication of the International Society for Infectious Diseases,462,19

In the early 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared it as a global health emergency without definitive treatments and preventive approaches. In the absence of definitive therapeutic agents, this thorough review summarizes and outlines the potency and safety of all molecules and therapeutics which may have potential antiviral effects. A number of molecules and therapeutics licensed or being tested for some other conditions were found effective in different in vitro studies as well as in many small sample-sized clinical trials and independent case studies. However, in those clinical trials, there were some limitations which need to be overcome to find the most promising antiviral against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). In conclusion, many of above-mentioned antivirals seems to have some therapeutic effects but none of them have been shown to have a strong evidence for their proper recommendation and approval in the treatment of COVID-19. Constantly evolving new evidences, exclusive adult data, language barrier, and type of study (observational, retrospective, small-sized clinical trials, or independent case series) resulted to the several limitations of this review. The need for multicentered, large sample-sized, randomized, placebo-controlled trials on COVID-19 patients to reach a proper conclusion on the most promising antiviral agent is warranted.","Yadav, Ambedkar Kumar; Wen, Siwan; Xu, Xianghuai; Yu, Li",Annals of palliative medicine,462,17

For this reason, we aimed to present a state-of-the-art systematic review and meta-analysis on the prognostic factors for adverse outcomes in COVID-19 patients. METHODS We systematically reviewed PubMed from January 1, 2020 to July 26, 2020 to identify non-overlapping studies examining the association of any prognostic factor with any adverse outcome in patients with COVID-19. Random-effects meta-analysis was performed, and between-study heterogeneity was quantified using I2 metric. Presence of small-study effects was assessed by applying the Egger's regression test. RESULTS We identified 428 eligible articles, which were used in a total of 263 meta-analyses examining the association of 91 unique prognostic factors with 11 outcomes. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, obstructive sleep apnea, pharyngalgia, history of venous thromboembolism, sex, coronary heart disease, cancer, chronic liver disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, dementia, any immunosuppressive medication, peripheral arterial disease, rheumatological disease and smoking were associated with at least one outcome and had >1000 events, p-value <0.005, I2 <50%, 95% prediction interval excluding the null value, and absence of small-study effects in the respective meta-analysis. The risk of bias assessment using the Quality In Prognosis Studies tool indicated high risk of bias in 302 of 428 articles for study participation, 389 articles for adjustment for other prognostic factors, and 396 articles for statistical analysis and reporting.

METHODS Between January 2014 and February 2018, ten patients suspected with muscle-invasive bladder cancer and request of bladder-preserving treatment were selected. In each case, bilateral pelvic lymphadenectomy was performed before green-laser assisted laparoscopic partial cystectomy. Under the direct view of cystoscope, the front-firing green-laser incision was performed 0.5-1 cm away from the exterior margin of lesion with adequate depth into the fat tissue. Tumours were then en bloc removed via laparoscope under the tracing of laser beam. RESULTS The location of 12 tumours in 10 patients was superior wall in 7 cases, lateral wall in 3 cases, anterior wall in 1 case, and posterior wall in 1 case. All procedures were completed without serious complications. The median operating time was 270 (210-360) min with a median haemoglobin decrease of 11 (3-38) g/L. Nine patients were high-grade transitional cell carcinoma and one patient was urachal carcinoma, and the clinical stage was pT1 in 1 case, pT2 in 4 cases, and pT3 in 5 cases. The pathological evaluation of tumour margins was negative in 10 patients. During the follow-up, no recurrence or metastasis were detected in 8 patients, but 2 patients presented regional recurrence.

The overall (5 years) survival rate of PC is less than 9% and is anticipated to be aggravated in the future due to the lack of molecular acquaintance and diagnostic tools for its early detection. Multiple factors are involved in the course of PC development, including genetics, cigarette smoking, alcohol, family history, and aberrant epigenetic signatures of the epigenome. In this review, we will mainly focus on the genetic mutations and epigenetic signature of PC. Multiple tumor suppressor and oncogene mutations are involved in PC initiation, including K-RAS, p53, CDKN2A, and SMAD4. The mutational frequency of these genes ranges from 50 to 98% in PC. The nature of mutation diagnosis is mostly homozygous deletion, point mutation, and aberrant methylation. In addition to genetic modification, epigenetic alterations particularly aberrant hypermethylation and hypomethylation also predispose patients to PC. Hypermethylation is mostly involved in the downregulation of tumor suppressor genes and leads to PC, while multiple genes also represent a hypomethylation status in PC. Several renewable drugs and detection tools have been developed to cope with this aggressive malady, but all are futile, and surgical resection remains the only choice for prolonged survival if diagnosed before metastasis. However, the available therapeutic development is insufficient to cure PC. Therefore, novel approaches are a prerequisite to elucidating the genetic and epigenetic mechanisms underlying PC progression for healthier lifelong survival.","Khan, Aamir Ali; Liu, Xinhui; Yan, Xinlong; Tahir, Muhammad; Ali, Sakhawat; Huang, Hua",Cancer metastasis reviews,462,24

The authors evaluated the feasibility of multislice computed tomographic angiography in vascular mapping of the facial artery. METHODS In total, 187 facial arteries in 94 patients without facial tumor or vascular disease were studied. Anatomical variations of the facial artery were classified into four types: type 1, a short course that terminates proximal to the superior labial artery; type 2, an intermediate course that terminates distal to the superior labial artery near the nasolabial fold; type 3, a classic course that extends to the lateral nasal ala beyond the nasolabial fold with an angular branch; and type 4, duplex with dominant lateral angular branch. Facial artery patterns were compared with dominant patterns of the facial-submental artery bifurcation. The extent of the inferior and superior labial artery was evaluated separately. RESULTS Sixty-four facial artery branches (34 percent) were classified as type 1, 74 (40 percent) as type 2, and 45 (24 percent) as type 3. Type 4 was seen in only four branches (2 percent). The facial artery was dominant in the facial-submental artery bifurcation in 84 percent of type 3 facial arteries. Three-dimensional volume-rendered images allow detailed visualization of the facial artery and its branches and help preoperative mapping. CONCLUSION Facial computed tomographic angiography allows detailed visualization of the facial artery and its branches and is a potential noninvasive imaging tool for preoperative vascular mapping for facial reconstructive operations.","Furukawa, Matakazu; Mathes, David W; Anzai, Yoshimi",Plastic and reconstructive surgery,462,8

However, there is an existing controversy, over when and if a free flap is needed during complex skull reconstruction (ie, cranioplasty). As such the authors present here our experience using full-thickness skin grafts (FTSGs) to cover local defects following scalp adjacent tissue transfer in the setting of cranioplasty. METHODS By way of an institutional review board-approved database, the authors identified patients treated over a 3-year period spanning January 2015 to December 2017, who underwent scalp reconstruction using the technique presented here. Patient demographics, clinical characteristics, technical details, outcomes, and long-term follow up were statistically analyzed for the purpose of this study. RESULTS Thirty-three patients, who underwent combined cranioplasty and scalp reconstruction using an FTSG for local donor site coverage, were identified. Twenty-five (75%) patients were considered to have ""high complexity"" scalp defects prior to reconstruction. Of them, 12 patients (36%) were large-sized and 20 (60%) medium-sized; 21 (64%) grafts were inset over vascularized muscle or pericranium while the remaining grafts were placed over bare calvarial bone. In total, the authors found 94% (31/33) success for all FTSGs in this cohort. Two of the skin grafts failed due to unsuccessful take. Owing to the high rate of success in this series, none of the patient's risk factors were found to correlate with graft failure. In addition, the success rate did not differ whether the graft was placed over bone verses over vascularized muscle/pericranium. CONCLUSION In contrary to previous studies that have reported inconsistent success with full-thickness skin grafting in this setting, the authors present a simple technique with consistent results-as compared to other more complex reconstructive methods-even in the setting of highly complex scalp reconstruction and simultaneous cranioplasty.","Wolff, Amir Y; Santiago, Gabriel F; Belzberg, Micah; Manson, Paul N; Huang, Judy; Brem, Henry; Gordon, Chad R",The Journal of craniofacial surgery,462,19

Using a single-center analysis, we aimed to establish predictors of survival. METHODS We retrospectively analyzed a consecutive cohort of 74 patients who had metastatic GEP NET and underwent PRRT with (177)Lu-octreotate (mean activity of 7.9 GBq per cycle, aimed at 4 treatment cycles at standard intervals of 3 mo). Patients (33 with pancreatic NET and 41 with nonpancreatic GEP NET) had unresectable metastatic disease graded as G1 or G2 (G1/G2) and documented morphologic or clinical progression within less than 12 mo or uncontrolled disease under somatostatin analog treatment. Responses were evaluated according to modified Southwest Oncology Group criteria. Potential predictors of survival were analyzed with the Kaplan-Meier curve method (log-rank test) and multivariate analysis (P < 0.05). RESULTS The response rates were 36.5% partial response, 17.6% minor response, 35.1% stable disease, and 10.8% progressive disease for the entire cohort; 54.5% partial response, 18.2% minor response, 18.2% stable disease, and 9.1% progressive disease for pancreatic NET; and 22.0% partial response, 17.1% minor response, 48.8% stable disease, and 12.2% progressive disease for nonpancreatic GEP NET. The median progression-free survival and overall survival were 26 mo (95% confidence interval, 18.3-33.7) and 55 mo (95% confidence interval, 48.8-61.2), respectively. Besides the Ki-67 index, a Karnofsky performance score of less than or equal to 70%, a hepatic tumor burden of greater than or equal to 25%, and a baseline plasma level of neuron-specific enolase of greater than 15 ng/mL independently predicted shorter overall survival (hazard ratio, 2.1-3.1). Patients with a Ki-67 index of greater than 10% still had median progression-free survival and overall survival of 19 and 34 mo, respectively. CONCLUSION The results of this study demonstrated the favorable response and long-term outcome of patients with G1/G2 GEP NET after PRRT. Independent predictors of survival were the Ki-67 index, the patient's performance status (Karnofsky performance scale score), the tumor burden, and the baseline neuron-specific enolase level. Even patients with a Ki-67 index of greater than 10% seemed to benefit from PRRT, with a good response and a notable long-term outcome. We present the first evidence, to our knowledge, that even in patients with metastatic disease the distinction between G1 and G2-in particular, between G1 (Ki-67 index of 1%-2%) and low-range G2 (Ki-67 index of 3%-10%)-provides prognostic stratification.","Ezziddin, Samer; Attassi, Mared; Yong-Hing, Charlotte J; Ahmadzadehfar, Hojjat; Willinek, Winfried; Grünwald, Frank; Guhlke, Stefan; Biersack, Hans-Jürgen; Sabet, Amir","Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine",462,12

Therefore, this prospective randomized study aims to compare the effect of continuous suctioning of subglottic secretions versus intermittent suctioning of subglottic secretions (CSSS vs. ISSS) secretions on tracheal mucosa in front of the suctioning port of the endotracheal tube. Patients and Methods Patients requiring intubation or reintubation in Intensive Care Unit with an expected ventilation duration > 24 h were eligible. Participants received CSSS at -20 mmHg or ISSS at -100 mmHg during 15 s and no suction during 8 s. The effect on tracheal mucosa in front of the suction port was assessed after intubation (T0) and before extubation (T1) using bronchoscopy. Tracheal mucosa damages were graded into five categories (no injury, erythema, edema, ulceration, or necrosis). The occurrence (no injury observed at T0 but present at T1) or the worsening (injury observed at T0 exacerbating at T1) was studied. Results Seventy-three patients were included and 53 patients (CSSS, n = 26 and ISSS, n = 27) were evaluable on the primary endpoint. The occurrence or worsening of tracheal mucosal damages did not differ between the two groups (CSSS, n = 7 [27%] vs. ISSS, n = 5 [17%], P = 0.465). Daily average volume of suctioned secretion was higher with ISSS (74 ± 100 ml vs. 20 ± 25 ml, P < 0.001). Impossibility to aspirate was higher with CSSS (0.14 ± 0.16 per day vs. 0.03 ± 0.07 per day, P < 0.001). Conclusions Our results suggest that tracheal mucosal damages did not differ between CSSS and ISSS. The aspirated volume was higher and impossibility to aspirate was lower with ISSS.

The continuous use of METH eventually leads to drug addiction and causes serious health complications, including attention deficit, memory loss and cognitive decline. These neurological complications are strongly associated with METH-induced neurotoxicity and neuroinflammation, which leads to neuronal cell death. The current review investigates the molecular mechanisms underlying METH-mediated neuronal damages. Our analysis demonstrates that the process of neuronal impairment by METH is closely related to oxidative stress, transcription factor activation, DNA damage, excitatory toxicity and various apoptosis pathways. Thus, we reach the conclusion here that METH-induced neuronal damages are attributed to the neurotoxic and neuroinflammatory effect of the drug. This review provides an insight into the mechanisms of METH addiction and contributes to the discovery of therapeutic targets on neurological impairment by METH abuse.","Kim, Buyun; Yun, Jangmi; Park, Byoungduck",Biomolecules & therapeutics,462,31

Methods: Using Baidu Index Platform (http://index.baidu.com) and the website of Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention as data resources to obtain the search volume (SV) of keywords for symptoms associated with COVID-19 from January 1 to February 20 in each year from 2017 to 2020, in Hubei province and other top 10 impacted provinces in China and the epidemic data. Data of 2020 were compared with the previous three years. Data of Hubei province were compared with confirmed cases. The differences and characteristics of the SV of COVID-19-related symptoms, and the correlation between the SV of COVID-19 and new confirmed or suspected cases were analyzed and the hysteresis effects were discussed. Results: Compared the data from January 1 to February 20, 2020, with the SV for the same period of previous three years, Hubei's SV for cough, fever, diarrhea, chest tightness, dyspnea and other symptoms were significantly increased. The total SV of lower respiratory symptoms was significantly higher than that of upper respiratory symptoms (P<0.001). The SV of COVID-19 in Hubei province was significantly correlated with new confirmed or suspected cases (R(confirmed) = 0.723, R(suspected) = 0.863, all P < 0.001). The results of the distributed lag model suggested that the patients who retrieved relevant symptoms on the Internet may begin to see a doctor in 2-3 days later and be diagnosed in 3-4 days later. Conclusions: The total SV of lower respiratory symptoms is higher than that of upper respiratory symptoms, and the SV of diarrhea also increased significantly. It warns us to pay attention to not only the symptoms of lower respiratory tract, but also the gastrointestinal symptoms, especially diarrhea in patients with COVID-19. There is a relationship between Internet retrieval behavior and the number of new confirmed or suspected cases.

METHODS This study was conducted at 28 centres from February 2020 to April 2020. Participants filled out a 62-item online survey including sociodemographic, COVID-19-related, epilepsy-related and psychological variables and were divided into two groups based on whether their seizure frequency increased during the COVID-19 pandemic. Chi-square tests and t-tests were used to test differences in significant characteristics. Multiple logistic regression analyses were used to identify risk factors for seizure worsening. RESULTS A total of 1,237 adult PWE were enrolled for analysis. Of this sample, 31 (8.33%) patients experienced an increase in seizures during the pandemic. Multivariate logistic regression suggested that feeling nervous about the pandemic (P < 0.05), poor quality of life (P = 0.001), drug reduction/withdrawal (P = 0.032), moderate anxiety during the COVID-19 outbreak (P = 0.046) and non-seizure free before the COVID-19 outbreak (P < 0.05) were independently related to seizure increase during the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS During the COVID-19 pandemic, PWE with poor quality of life and mental status, as well as AED reduction/withdrawal, were more likely to experience seizure increase. This observation highlights the importance of early identification of the population at high risk of seizure worsening and implementation of preventive strategies during the pandemic.","Zeng, Chang; Meng, Hongmei; Zhu, Yulan; Yao, Lifen; Lian, Yajun; Zhu, Yanmei; Zhang, Min; Dai, Yuwei; Wang, Kang; Han, Xiong; Li, Ling; Zhang, Lifang; Xu, Huiqing; Yao, Dongai; Luo, Xinmin; Jiang, Wen; Wang, Xiahong; Zhao, Chuansheng; Chen, Yangmei; Deng, Xuejun; Liu, Chaorong; Feng, Li; Song, Yanmin; Wu, Yuan; Liao, Weiping; Wang, Furong; Zhu, Suiqiang; Xiao, Bo; Wang, Qun; Long, Lili",Seizure,462,1

However, the potential benefit of more intense antiplatelet therapy must be assessed in relation to the risk for major bleeding. The SOCRATES trial (Acute Stroke or Transient Ischemic Attack Treated With Aspirin or Ticagrelor and Patient Outcomes) was the first trial with ticagrelor in patients with acute ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack in which the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor were compared with those of aspirin. The main safety objective was assessment of PLATO (Platelet Inhibition and Patient Outcomes)-defined major bleeds on treatment, with special focus on intracranial hemorrhage (ICrH). METHODS An independent adjudication committee blinded to study treatment classified bleeds according to the PLATO, TIMI (Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction), and GUSTO (Global Use of Strategies to Open Occluded Coronary Arteries) definitions. The definitions of ICrH and major bleeding excluded cerebral microbleeds and asymptomatic hemorrhagic transformations of cerebral infarctions so that the definitions better discriminated important events in the acute stroke population. RESULTS A total of 13 130 of 13 199 randomized patients received at least 1 dose of study drug and were included in the safety analysis set. PLATO major bleeds occurred in 31 patients (0.5%) on ticagrelor and 38 patients (0.6%) on aspirin (hazard ratio, 0.83; 95% confidence interval, 0.52-1.34). The most common locations of major bleeds were intracranial and gastrointestinal. ICrH was reported in 12 patients (0.2%) on ticagrelor and 18 patients (0.3%) on aspirin. Thirteen of all 30 ICrHs (4 on ticagrelor and 9 on aspirin) were hemorrhagic strokes, and 4 (2 in each group) were symptomatic hemorrhagic transformations of brain infarctions. The ICrHs were spontaneous in 6 and 13, traumatic in 3 and 3, and procedural in 3 and 2 patients on ticagrelor and aspirin, respectively. In total, 9 fatal bleeds occurred on ticagrelor and 4 on aspirin. The composite of ICrH or fatal bleeding included 15 patients on ticagrelor and 18 on aspirin. Independently of bleeding classification, PLATO, TIMI, or GUSTO, the relative difference between treatments for major/severe bleeds was similar. Nonmajor bleeds were more common on ticagrelor. CONCLUSIONS Antiplatelet therapy with ticagrelor in patients with acute ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack showed a bleeding profile similar to that of aspirin for major bleeds.

The Cytosponge-trefoil factor 3 (TFF3) is a non-endoscopic test for Barrett's oesophagus. The aim of this study was to investigate whether offering this test to patients on medication for gastro-oesophageal reflux would increase the detection of Barrett's oesophagus compared with standard management. METHODS This multicentre, pragmatic, randomised controlled trial was done in 109 socio-demographically diverse general practice clinics in England. Randomisation was done both at the general practice clinic level (cluster randomisation) and at the individual patient level, and the results for each type of randomisation were analysed separately before being combined. Patients were eligible if they were aged 50 years or older, had been taking acid-suppressants for symptoms of gastro-oesophageal reflux for more than 6 months, and had not undergone an endoscopy procedure within the past 5 years. General practice clinics were selected by the local clinical research network and invited to participate in the trial. For cluster randomisation, clinics were randomly assigned (1:1) by the trial statistician using a computer-generated randomisation sequence; for individual patient-level randomisation, patients were randomly assigned (1:1) by the general practice clinics using a centrally prepared computer-generated randomisation sequence. After randomisation, participants received either standard management of gastro-oesophageal reflux (usual care group), in which participants only received an endoscopy if required by their general practitioner, or usual care plus an offer of the Cytosponge-TFF3 procedure, with a subsequent endoscopy if the procedure identified TFF3-positive cells (intervention group). The primary outcome was the diagnosis of Barrett's oesophagus at 12 months after enrolment, expressed as a rate per 1000 person-years, in all participants in the intervention group (regardless of whether they had accepted the offer of the Cytosponge-TFF3 procedure) compared with all participants in the usual care group. Analyses were intention-to-treat. The trial is registered with the ISRCTN registry, ISRCTN68382401, and is completed. FINDINGS Between March 20, 2017, and March 21, 2019, 113 general practice clinics were enrolled, but four clinics dropped out shortly after randomisation. Using an automated search of the electronic prescribing records of the remaining 109 clinics, we identified 13 657 eligible patients who were sent an introductory letter with 14 days to opt out. 13 514 of these patients were randomly assigned (per practice or at the individual patient level) to the usual care group (n=6531) or the intervention group (n=6983). Following randomisation, 149 (2%) of 6983 participants in the intervention group and 143 (2%) of 6531 participants in the usual care group, on further scrutiny, did not meet all eligibility criteria or withdrew from the study. Of the remaining 6834 participants in the intervention group, 2679 (39%) expressed an interest in undergoing the Cytosponge-TFF3 procedure. Of these, 1750 (65%) met all of the eligibility criteria on telephone screening and underwent the procedure. Most of these participants (1654 [95%]; median age 69 years) swallowed the Cytosponge successfully and produced a sample. 231 (3%) of 6834 participants had a positive Cytosponge-TFF3 result and were referred for an endoscopy. Patients who declined the offer of the Cytosponge-TFF3 procedure and all participants in the usual care group only had an endoscopy if deemed necessary by their general practitioner. During an average of 12 months of follow-up, 140 (2%) of 6834 participants in the intervention group and 13 (<1%) of 6388 participants in the usual care group were diagnosed with Barrett's oesophagus (absolute difference 18·3 per 1000 person-years [95% CI 14·8-21·8]; rate ratio adjusted for cluster randomisation 10·6 [95% CI 6·0-18·8], p<0·0001). Nine (<1%) of 6834 participants were diagnosed with dysplastic Barrett's oesophagus (n=4) or stage I oesophago-gastric cancer (n=5) in the intervention group, whereas no participants were diagnosed with dysplastic Barrett's oesophagus or stage I gastro-oesophageal junction cancer in the usual care group. Among 1654 participants in the intervention group who swallowed the Cytosponge device successfully, 221 (13%) underwent endoscopy after testing positive for TFF3 and 131 (8%, corresponding to 59% of those having an endoscopy) were diagnosed with Barrett's oesophagus or cancer. One patient had a detachment of the Cytosponge from the thread requiring endoscopic removal, and the most common side-effect was a sore throat in 63 (4%) of 1654 participants. INTERPRETATION In patients with gastro-oesophageal reflux, the offer of Cytosponge-TFF3 testing results in improved detection of Barrett's oesophagus. Cytosponge-TFF3 testing could also lead to the diagnosis of treatable dysplasia and early cancer. This strategy will lead to additional endoscopies with some false positive results.

Flow volume of the brachial artery was monitored using Doppler ultrasonography during the banding procedure. In patients with steal syndrome, the finger probe of a pulse oximeter was attached to a finger on the ipsilateral side, and the peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) was monitored. RESULTS In the high-flow group, the mean access blood flow (Qa) decreased from 2043 ± 463 ml/min (mean ± SD) to 1248 ± 388 ml/min (p<0.001). In the steal syndrome group, the SpO2 value improved in all steal syndrome patients after banding. Symptoms were almost relieved in two steal syndrome patients. The Qa in the steal group decreased from 997 ± 867 to 548 ± 376 ml/min (p = 0.12). The secondary patency rates of the high-flow and steal groups at 6 months were 83.3% and 50%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS The MILLER banding procedure with intraoperative access flow monitoring is effective to treat high-flow VA and steal syndrome.","Shintaku, Sadanori; Kawanishi, Hideki; Moriishi, Misaki; Banshodani, Masataka; Ago, Rika; Tsuchiya, Shinichiro",The journal of vascular access,462,1

DESIGN Retrospective. SETTING An Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admitting mechanically ventilated patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. PATIENTS Four adult patients. INTERVENTIONS We compared the blood values of IL-6, C-reactive protein (CRP) and of other biochemical variables including the PaO2/FiO2 in two patients who received TCZ alone and in other 2 in whom it was associated with the HA (TCZ-HA) due to the presence of impending or established organ failures other than the lung. All variables were measured before, during and after the treatment. MAIN RESULTS In all patients, the IL-6 increased during the treatment; after its termination, its values sharply decreased only in those treated also with HA; conversely, the CRP decreased in all patients; the PaO2/FiO2 increased in three patients and remained stable in the remaining one. Both the TCZ and the HA were well tolerated; all patients were weaned from the mechanical ventilation and discharged from the hospital. LIMITATIONS Although the limited number of patients does not allow to draw firm conclusions, the increase of the IL-6 of can be ascribed to its displacement from cellular and soluble receptors, whereas its decrease is likely due to the scavenging effect exerted by the HA. Although the association TCZ-HA could be valuable in the treatment of the Cytokine Release Storm (CRS) associated with the SARS-CoV-2, the HA could be more effective as it neutralizes a wider panel of inflammatory mediators.","Berlot, Giorgio; Pintacuda, Stefania; Moro, Edoardo; Paluzzano, Giacomo; Scamperle, Alice; Chillemi, Antonino; Longo, Irene; Dattola, Roberto; Roman-Pognuz, Erik; Tomasini, Ariella",The International journal of artificial organs,462,28

However, the feasibility of using STAT for translumenal organ resection is unknown. This study aimed to evaluate the technical performance of organ resection using STAT, the integrity of the STAT gastric tunnel after organ resection, and the postoperative morbidity of organ resection using STAT. METHODS In this study, 14 domestic swine underwent transgastric organ resection (7 cholecystectomies, 7 uterine horn resections) followed by sequential removal of two different sizes of standardized specimens. Evaluation of operative injury to the tunnel and difficulty of specimen extraction was performed. After 2 weeks of observation, necropsy was performed for evaluation and documentation of gross findings. RESULTS The mean operating room time (intubation recovery) was 4.1 h. A tunnel with a mean length of 12 cm and a mean width of 4 cm was created. The tunnel remained fully intact in 14 of 14 animals after organ resection, in 13 of 13 animals after balloon extraction, and in 12 of 14 animals after rigid specimen extraction (1 clinically significant tear occurred). Postoperatively, all the animals gained weight appropriately. Necropsy findings included adhesions (n = 4), bile leak (n = 2), minor lap-port abscess (n = 1), and ventral hernia (n = 1). CONCLUSIONS Although this study was a limited, prospective, animal survival study without a control arm, it again indicates that STAT allows safe abdominal access, a reliable means of closure, and directed endoscope positioning. Although one significant mucosal tear did occur, this study suggests STAT will tolerate the mechanical forces of peroral transgastric procedures provided the organ resected is small to moderate in size (<8 × 3 cm).","Moyer, Matthew T; Pauli, Eric M; Gopal, Jegan; Mathew, Abraham; Haluck, Randy S",Surgical endoscopy,462,1

Changes in mucosal 5-HT (serotonin) signalling occur in animal models of colitis and in humans suffering from IBD. Melatonin is co-released with 5-HT from the mucosa and has a wide variety of actions in the GI tract. Here, we examined how melatonin signalling is affected by colitis and determined how this relates to 5-HT signalling. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH Using electroanalytical approaches, we investigated how 5-HT release, reuptake and availability as well as melatonin availability are altered in dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis in mice. Studies were conducted to explore if melatonin treatment during active colitis could reduce the severity of colitis. KEY RESULTS We observed an increase in 5-HT and a decrease in melatonin availability in DSS-induced colitis. A significant reduction in 5-HT reuptake was observed in DSS-induced colitis animals. A reduction in the content of 5-HT was observed, but no difference in tryptophan levels were observed. A reduction in deoxycholic acid-stimulated 5-HT availability and a significant reduction in mechanically-stimulated 5-HT and melatonin availability were observed in DSS-induced colitis. Orally or rectally administered melatonin once colitis was established did not significantly suppress inflammation. CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS Our data suggest that DSS-induced colitis results in a reduction in melatonin availability and an increase in 5-HT availability, due to a reduction/loss of tryptophan hydroxylase 1 enzyme, 5-HT content and 5-HT transporters. Mechanosensory release was more susceptible to inflammation when compared with chemosensory release.","MacEachern, Sarah J; Keenan, Catherine M; Papakonstantinou, Evangelia; Sharkey, Keith A; Patel, Bhavik Anil",British journal of pharmacology,462,1

Tocilizumab, a monoclonal antibody against the interleukin 6 receptor, may counteract the inflammatory cytokine release syndrome in patients with severe COVID-19 illness. Objective To test whether tocilizumab decreases mortality in this population. Design, Setting, and Participants The data for this study were derived from a multicenter cohort study of 4485 adults with COVID-19 admitted to participating intensive care units (ICUs) at 68 hospitals across the US from March 4 to May 10, 2020. Critically ill adults with COVID-19 were categorized according to whether they received or did not receive tocilizumab in the first 2 days of admission to the ICU. Data were collected retrospectively until June 12, 2020. A Cox regression model with inverse probability weighting was used to adjust for confounding. Exposures Treatment with tocilizumab in the first 2 days of ICU admission. Main Outcomes and Measures Time to death, compared via hazard ratios (HRs), and 30-day mortality, compared via risk differences. Results Among the 3924 patients included in the analysis (2464 male [62.8%]; median age, 62 [interquartile range {IQR}, 52-71] years), 433 (11.0%) received tocilizumab in the first 2 days of ICU admission. Patients treated with tocilizumab were younger (median age, 58 [IQR, 48-65] vs 63 [IQR, 52-72] years) and had a higher prevalence of hypoxemia on ICU admission (205 of 433 [47.3%] vs 1322 of 3491 [37.9%] with mechanical ventilation and a ratio of partial pressure of arterial oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen of <200 mm Hg) than patients not treated with tocilizumab. After applying inverse probability weighting, baseline and severity-of-illness characteristics were well balanced between groups. A total of 1544 patients (39.3%) died, including 125 (28.9%) treated with tocilizumab and 1419 (40.6%) not treated with tocilizumab. In the primary analysis, during a median follow-up of 27 (IQR, 14-37) days, patients treated with tocilizumab had a lower risk of death compared with those not treated with tocilizumab (HR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.56-0.92). The estimated 30-day mortality was 27.5% (95% CI, 21.2%-33.8%) in the tocilizumab-treated patients and 37.1% (95% CI, 35.5%-38.7%) in the non-tocilizumab-treated patients (risk difference, 9.6%; 95% CI, 3.1%-16.0%). Conclusions and Relevance Among critically ill patients with COVID-19 in this cohort study, the risk of in-hospital mortality in this study was lower in patients treated with tocilizumab in the first 2 days of ICU admission compared with patients whose treatment did not include early use of tocilizumab.

Recently, immune checkpoint inhibitors (anti-PD-L1/PD1) have been approved in this setting after durable clinical response was demonstrated in several clinical trials. In this series, we present a multicentre real-world experience in using anti-PD-L1/PD1 in advanced MCC. METHODS A retrospective review was performed of all patients with metastatic MCC who were treated with at least one dose of anti-PD-L1/PD1 presenting to Sydney West Cancer Network (Westmead, Nepean and Blacktown hospitals) was performed between 2016 and 2020. Treatment response was assessed based on morphologic and/or metabolic changes of the disease on FDG-PET/CT scans. Primary end point investigated was objective response rate. Secondary outcomes included therapy toxicity, disease control and overall survival. RESULTS Thirteen patients received anti-PD-L1/PD1 with a median age of 82 (range 62-89). Two patients had undergone prior palliative chemotherapy. The median follow-up time was 17 months (range 2-34). The overall, complete and partial response rates were 77% (10), 54% (7) and 23% (3), respectively. Treatment-related grade 1 or 2 toxicity was experienced by 69% with only 2 cases of greater severity. The median progression-free survival and overall survival were 18 months (95% CI 10-26 months) and 33 months (95% CI range 7.6-58.4 months), respectively. CONCLUSIONS Consistent with clinical trial results, anti-PD-L1/PD1 therapy in this small series demonstrated efficacy and safety in patients with metastatic MCC.","Hasmat, Shaheen; Howle, Julie R; Karikios, Deme J; Carlino, Matteo S; Veness, Michael J",Journal of medical imaging and radiation oncology,462,17

Specifically, there has been a heightened receptivity to the importance of preserving physicians' and other health care professionals' time, cognitive bandwidth, and emotional reserve for the direct care of patients, instead of squandering these resources on low-value tasks and frustrating technology. Instead of reflexively reverting to past practices and policies, there is now an opportunity to take advantage of the lessons of COVID-19 for the further transformation of health care to achieve Quadruple Aim outcomes (better care for individuals, better health for the population, better experience for clinicians, and lower costs).

PURPOSE To assess the controversial indications for and limitations of ending the instrumentation for posterior spinal fusion (PSF) at L5 in patients with flaccid neuromuscular scoliosis (fNMS). METHODS We reviewed the cases of 45 patients with progressive spinal deformity as a result of fNMS treated by PSF to L5 and followed for an average of 4 years postoperatively with adequate clinical and radiological data. Anterior-posterior and lateral whole spine radiographs were evaluated. We divided patients into two groups based on the degree of pelvic obliquity (PO) at the final follow-up. Radiographic data from the two groups were analyzed to identify the indications and limitations of this surgical method focusing on PO. RESULTS Preoperatively, there were significant differences between the two groups in Cobb angle, PO, thoracolumbar kyphosis, and lumbar lordosis (LL) while sitting; Cobb angle and LL while supine (Supine Cobb, and Supine LL); and major curve flexibility. Multivariate logistic regression analysis identified Supine Cobb and Supine LL as independent risk factors for residual PO at the final follow-up (Supine Cobb: odds ratio, 1.1; 95% confidence interval 1.0-1.2, Supine LL: odds ratio, 0.9; 95% confidence interval 0.8-1.0). CONCLUSION Patients with larger preoperative Cobb angle and smaller LL while supine may not achieve adequate spine and pelvic correction and this may lead to deterioration in the PO over time, even after spinal fusion ending at L5.","Saito, Wataru; Inoue, Gen; Shirasawa, Eiki; Imura, Takayuki; Nakazawa, Toshiyuki; Miyagi, Masayuki; Kawakubo, Ayumu; Uchida, Kentaro; Kotani, Toshiaki; Akazawa, Tsutomu; Takaso, Masashi",Spine deformity,462,28

Given the significant global demand to provide telehealth services, it is important to explore patient receptiveness toward this alternative service model, particularly from regions where it has yet to be implemented. We conducted a cross-sectional study to understand the views and willingness of patients toward the use of telehealth for cancer genetic counseling. A survey was completed by 160 patients of the National Cancer Centre Singapore, and descriptive statistics were used to analyze the data. The study found that 95.6% (n = 153/160) of participants did not have prior telehealth experience. Most participants were willing or neutral toward having genetic counseling by phone (n = 114/160, 71.3%) and video (n = 106/160, 66.3%). However, majority prefer in-person appointments for first (n = 127/160, 79.4%) and follow-up (n = 97/160, 60.6%) visits over telehealth. Majority agreed that a phone/video consultation would meet most of their needs but voiced concerns regarding privacy and sharing of information (n = 79/160, 49.4% for phone; n = 74/160, 46.3% for video) and whether their emotional needs could be met (n = 61/160, 38.1%). Participants' age, employment status, income, mode of transportation to the appointment, and whether special arrangements were made to attend the in-person appointment were associated with receptivity to telehealth genetic counseling (p ≤ .05 for all). This study adds diversity to existing literature and demonstrates that patients from Asia are generally willing and accepting of the use of telehealth in a cancer genetics service. This will help meet increasing global demand of telehealth consultations in the post-pandemic new norm. Furthermore, it will also provide services for underserved populations and patients requiring urgent testing in a timely manner.

Simultaneously, the banning of some existing antibiotics and the lack of development of new antimicrobials have created an urgent need to find new alternatives against animal infections. Bacteriophages (phages) are naturally occurring predators of bacteria, ubiquitous in the environment, with high host specificity and harmless to animals. For these reasons, phages and their derivatives are being considered valuable antimicrobial alternatives and an opportunity to reduce the current use of antibiotics in agri-food production, increasing animal productivity and providing environmental protection. Furthermore, the possibility of combining phage genetic material with foreign genes encoding peptides of interest has enabled their use as vaccine delivery tools. In this case, besides bacterial infections, they might be used to prevent viral infections. This review explores current data regarding advances on the use of phages and phage-encoded proteins, such as endolysins, exolysins and depolymerases, either for therapeutic or prophylactic applications, in animal husbandry.

Smartphone ophthalmoscopy involves using a smartphone camera for digital retinal imaging. Utilizing smartphones to detect DR is potentially more affordable, accessible, and easier to use than conventional methods. OBJECTIVE This study aimed to determine the diagnostic accuracy of various smartphone ophthalmoscopy approaches for detecting DR in diabetic patients. METHODS We performed an electronic search on the Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library for literature published from January 2000 to November 2018. We included studies involving diabetic patients, which compared the diagnostic accuracy of smartphone ophthalmoscopy for detecting DR to an accurate or commonly employed reference standard, such as indirect ophthalmoscopy, slit-lamp biomicroscopy, and tabletop fundus photography. Two reviewers independently screened studies against the inclusion criteria, extracted data, and assessed the quality of included studies using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 tool, with disagreements resolved via consensus. Sensitivity and specificity were pooled using the random effects model. A summary receiver operating characteristic (SROC) curve was constructed.

RESULTS In all, nine studies involving 1430 participants were included. Most studies were of high quality, except one study with limited applicability because of its reference standard. The pooled sensitivity and specificity for detecting any DR was 87% (95% CI 74%-94%) and 94% (81%-98%); mild nonproliferative DR (NPDR) was 39% (10%-79%) and 95% (91%-98%); moderate NPDR was 71% (57%-81%) and 95% (88%-98%); severe NPDR was 80% (49%-94%) and 97% (88%-99%); proliferative DR (PDR) was 92% (79%-97%) and 99% (96%-99%); diabetic macular edema was 79% (63%-89%) and 93% (82%-97%); and referral-warranted DR was 91% (86%-94%) and 89% (56%-98%). The area under SROC curve ranged from 0.879 to 0.979. The diagnostic odds ratio ranged from 11.3 to 1225. CONCLUSIONS We found heterogeneous evidence showing that smartphone ophthalmoscopy performs well in detecting DR. The diagnostic accuracy for PDR was highest. Future studies should standardize reference criteria and classification criteria and evaluate other available forms of smartphone ophthalmoscopy in primary care settings.

Despite the effectiveness of bariatric surgery, about 10 to 20% of patients continue to regain weight after the procedure. New evidence supports that ADHD may be directly associated with obesity and may affect outcomes following bariatric surgery. However, certain psychiatric illnesses, such as ADHD, are rarely screened for, leading to a continued lack of data on the interaction between ADHD and bariatric surgery. A comprehensive literature search for both published and unpublished studies of ADHD and bariatric surgery from 1946 to August 2018 was performed. The search was conducted using the Medline, EMBASE, Scopus, the Cochrane Library, and Web of Science databases as well as conference abstracts. Our search strategy terms included ""(ADHD OR attention deficit hyperactivity disorder) AND (bariatrics OR obesity surgery OR gastric bypass OR gastric sleeve OR Roux-en-Y OR RYGB OR sleeve gastrectomy)"" and was limited to human studies in the English language. Preliminary database search of the literature yielded 104 articles after 70 duplicates were removed. A total of five studies with 492 patients were included. The overall ADHD rate was 20.9% with reported rates ranging from 7 to 38%. The weighted mean age was 44.0 ± 10.2 years, the weighted sex was 83.6% female, and the weighted mean follow-up was 22.2 months. Preoperative weighted mean BMI was 43.7 versus a postoperative weighted mean BMI of 34.7. No statistical significance was observed for mean BMI difference between non-ADHD vs. ADHD patients undergoing bariatric surgery (three studies; MD - 2.66; CI - 7.54 to 2.13; p = 0.28). Statistical significance was, however, observed for postoperative follow-up between patients with ADHD vs. non-ADHD subjects (three studies; MD - 7.28; - 13.83 to -0.73; p = 0.03). Patients with ADHD do not have a statistically significant mean BMI difference following bariatric surgery but have a statistically significant reduction in postoperative follow-up versus non-ADHD patients. Targeted strategies aimed at improving clinic attendance for this at-risk ADHD population may improve bariatric outcomes and minimize recidivism rates.","Mocanu, Valentin; Tavakoli, Iran; MacDonald, Andrew; Dang, Jerry T; Switzer, Noah; Birch, Daniel W; Karmali, Shahzeer",Obesity surgery,462,1

Recent studies in humans have questioned this assumption by showing that within-network functional connectivity fluctuates on the order of seconds to minutes. Time-varying profiles of resting-state networks (RSNs) may relate to spontaneously shifting, electrophysiological network states and are thus mechanistically of particular importance. However, because these studies acquired data from awake subjects, the fluctuating connectivity could reflect various forms of conscious brain processing such as passive mind wandering, active monitoring, memory formation, or changes in attention and arousal during image acquisition. Here, we characterize RSN dynamics of anesthetized macaques that control for these accounts, and compare them to awake human subjects. We find that functional connectivity among nodes comprising the ""oculomotor (OCM) network"" strongly fluctuated over time during awake as well as anaesthetized states. For time dependent analysis with short windows (<60 s), periods of positive functional correlations alternated with prominent anticorrelations that were missed when assessed with longer time windows. Similarly, the analysis identified network nodes that transiently link to the OCM network and did not emerge in average RSN analysis. Furthermore, time-dependent analysis reliably revealed transient states of large-scale synchronization that spanned all seeds. The results illustrate that resting-state functional connectivity is not static and that RSNs can exhibit nonstationary, spontaneous relationships irrespective of conscious, cognitive processing. The findings imply that mechanistically important network information can be missed when using average functional connectivity as the single network measure.","Hutchison, R Matthew; Womelsdorf, Thilo; Gati, Joseph S; Everling, Stefan; Menon, Ravi S",Human brain mapping,462,31

We aimed to perform quantitative analysis of the bacterial cells and reveal the microbiota of the nasal discharge in children at the species level based on highly accurate 16S rRNA gene sequencing. This study enrolled 40 pediatric patients with rhinorrhea. The bacterial cells in the nasal discharge were counted by epifluorescence microscopic analysis. The microbiota was analyzed by using the 16S rRNA gene clone library sequencing method. We demonstrated that a high abundance (median 2.2 × 107 cells/mL) of bacteria was contained in the nasal discharge of children. Of the 40 samples, 37 (92.5%) were dominated by OTUs corresponding to Haemophilus aegyptius/influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis/nonliquefaciens, or Streptococcus pneumoniae. These samples showed higher cell abundance and lower alpha diversity than the remaining three samples in which the other bacteria coexisted. In addition, 12 sequences with low homology to type strains were considered as previously unknown bacterial lineages. In conclusion, the nasal discharge of most young children contains a large amount of respiratory pathogens and several unknown bacteria, which could not only cause endogenous infection but also be a source of transmission to others.","Haro, Kaoru; Ogawa, Midori; Saito, Mitsumasa; Kusuhara, Koichi; Fukuda, Kazumasa",Scientific reports,462,16

However, due to travel restrictions currently associated with COVID-19, many are now considering virtual MMIs. Long Island University (LIU) took the step to conduct MMIs virtually for its inaugural class before the pandemic restrictions occurred, largely because it hoped to reduce the cost of admission by eliminating travel costs. In this process, we encountered a unique set of challenges, the resolution of which we believe constitutes best practices for virtual MMIs. This report describes the design and execution of an MMI for LIU. We were able to interview 340 applicants in 7 days. Based on feedback from applicants as well as raters, most considered it an acceptable means of interviewing students.

We performed a cross-sectional study of ALD at our liver transplantation (LT) center, located in the initial U.S. epicenter, New York City (NYC). Results Centered around the ""stay at home"" order date in NY state, 3/22/20, we defined 3 time periods: ""pre-COVID"" (1/1/20-3/21/20); ""COVID-quarantine"" (3/22/20-4/22/20); and ""declining-COVID"" (4/23/20-8/25/20).We found a 62% increase in interhospital patient transfers for ALD from pre-COVID (20/93, 21%) to the declining-COVID period (43/127, 34%). Our inpatient liver census with ALD also increased: 38% pre-COVID, 45% COVID-quarantine and 49% declining-COVID.Among 30 severe AH patients not responding to medical therapy since 3/22/20, 9 underwent early LT for AH (16% of the total number of early LT during our 8-year program). Three of 9 early LT recipients reported specific COVID-related stressors.All 25 previous LT recipients with established abstinence pre-COVID maintained abstinence at follow-up visits during declining-COVID period. Of 6 recipients with sustained alcohol use within 6 months before 3/22/20, half regained abstinence during the declining-COVID period. Conclusion Our findings help confirm the predictions of rising AUD and ALD as an immediate consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic. This aftershock particularly affected ethnically diverse ALD patients with high inpatient mortality, reflecting the disproportionate impact of COVID-19 on underserved and minority populations.Alcohol relapse did not occur in long-term early LT for AH recipients during the time of COVID-19. This lends further support to AH being a viable indication for LT, with recipients able to demonstrate ongoing resilience in the face of this unprecedented universal stressor.","Rutledge, Stephanie M; Schiano, Thomas D; Florman, Sander; Im, Gene Y",Hepatology communications,462,26

Objectives The purposes of this study were to assess the diagnostic yield of electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy (ENB) combined with transbronchial lung cryobiopsy (TBLC) and to compare it with standard transbronchial biopsy (TBB) in pulmonary nodules of less than 2 cm in diameter. Methods We prospectively included 32 patients (18 men and 14 women, mean age 68 ± 9 years) with nodules of less than 2 cm in diameter and no metastasis at 18FDG PET-CT. The nodule position was determined by ENB, radial endobronchial ultrasonography miniprobe, and fluoroscopy. Eight samples were obtained, six by TBB and two by TBLC. Results Nodule diameter averaged 16 ± 3 mm. Twenty-five nodules were malignant and 18 were surgically resected. Surgery was avoided in four patients as the biopsies revealed a benign disease. The samples obtained by TBLC were five times larger than those by TBB. The diagnostic yields of TBLC and TBB were 69% and 38%, respectively (p=0.017). Adverse events consisted in 15 mild or moderate bleedings and one pneumothorax. Conclusions In the setting of peripheral pulmonary lesions of less than 20 mm in diameter, ENB-combined TBLC is feasible and safe, provides larger samples, and has higher diagnostic yield than TBB.","Taton, Olivier; Bondue, Benjamin; Gevenois, Pierre Alain; Remmelink, Myriam; Leduc, Dimitri",Pulmonary medicine,462,1

DESIGN Population-level deterministic compartmental epidemic modelling of eight scenarios applying various assumptions regarding SARS-CoV-2 transmissibility (baseline R0 = 3.5 or 7.0), vaccine rollout speed (slow or fast), and scale of border re-opening (mean of 2500 or 13 000 overseas arrivals per day). SETTING Simulation population size, age structure, and age-based contact rates based on recent estimates for the Australian population. We assumed that 80% vaccination coverage of people aged 16 years or more was reached in mid-October 2021 (fast rollout) or early January 2022 (slow rollout). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Numbers of people admitted to hospital with COVID-19, December 2021 - December 2022. RESULTS In scenarios assuming a highly transmissible SARS-CoV-2 variant (R0 = 7.0), opening the international border on either scale was followed by surges in both infections and hospitalisations that would require public health measures beyond mask wearing and social distancing to avoid overwhelming the health system. Reducing the number of hospitalisations to manageable levels required several cycles of additional social and mobility restrictions. CONCLUSIONS If highly transmissible SARS-CoV-2 variants are circulating locally or overseas, large and disruptive COVID-19 outbreaks will still be possible in Australia after 80% of people aged 16 years or more have been vaccinated. Continuing public health measures to restrict the spread of disease are likely to be necessary throughout 2022.","Hanly, Mark J; Churches, Timothy; Fitzgerald, Oisin; Post, Jeffrey J; MacIntyre, C Raina; Jorm, Louisa",The Medical journal of Australia,462,7

Data on the revisional restrictive options including laparoscopic adjustable gastric band (LAGB) is scarce. This study analyzes the mid-term efficacy and safety of LAGB as a revisional procedure after RYGB. METHODS Data of all patients with revisional LAGB after primary RYGB between January 2011 and May 2019 were retrospectively reviewed. Outcomes included assessment of weight changes, resolution of comorbidities, and early and late complications during the study period. RESULTS Twenty patients were included. The median Body Mass Index (BMI) before revisional LAGB was 34.8 (interquartile range [IQR] 31.9-38.1) kg/m2. After a median follow-up of 33.5 (IQR 19.5-76.5) months, the median BMI was 28.7 (IQR 26.1-32.2) kg/m2. The median additional Excess Weight Loss (EWL) was 37.6% (IQR 23-44.4), leading to a median total EWL of 79.5% (IQR 54.4-94.6). BMI and EWL post-LAGB improved significantly compared to BMI and EWL pre-LAGB (p<0.001 and p<0.001, respectively). Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome resolved 6 months after LAGB in one patient. Three band deflations occurred during the follow-up. Six patients underwent band removal after a median time of 19 (IQR 15.8-26) months. Overall, thirteen patients underwent a reoperation. There was no loss of follow-up until 5 years. After that, two patients were lost to follow-up. CONCLUSION LAGB may be a salvage option after failed RYGB. However, the high rate of revisions after secondary LAGB needs to be taken into consideration.","Lazaridis, Ioannis I; Kraljević, Marko; Süsstrunk, Julian; Köstler, Thomas; Zingg, Urs; Delko, Tarik",Journal of gastrointestinal surgery : official journal of the Society for Surgery of the Alimentary Tract,462,28

METHODS This was a retrospective case series of all patients who underwent radical cystectomy. Patients were grouped based on surgical approach (open vs robot assisted) and diversion technique (extracorporeal vs intracorporeal). Patients completed BCI and BIS preoperatively and at standardized postoperative intervals (at least 2). The primary exposure variable was surgical approach. The primary outcome measure was difference in interval and baseline BCI and BIS scores in each group. The Fisher exact, Wilcoxon rank-sum, and Kruskal-Wallis tests were used for comparisons. RESULTS Eighty-two and 100 patients underwent RARC and ORC, respectively. Compared with RARC, more patients undergoing ORC had an American Society of Anesthesiology score≥3 (66% vs 45.1% RARC; P=.007) and shorter median operative time (350 vs 380 minutes; P=.009). Baseline urinary, bowel, sexual function, and body image were not different between both the groups (P=1.0). Longitudinal postoperative analysis revealed better sexual function in ORC group (P=.047), with no significant differences between both the groups in the other 3 domains (P=.11, .58, and .93). Comparisons regarding diversion techniques showed similar findings in baseline and postoperative HRQL data, with no significant differences in the HRQL and body image domains. CONCLUSION RARC has comparable HRQL outcomes to ORC using validated BCI and BIS. The diversion technique used does not seem to affect patients' quality of life.","Aboumohamed, Ahmed A; Raza, Syed Johar; Al-Daghmin, Ali; Tallman, Christopher; Creighton, Terrance; Crossley, Heather; Dailey, Stephen; Khan, Aabroo; Din, Rakeeba; Mehedint, Diana; Wang, Katy; Shi, Yi; Sharif, Mohamed; Wilding, Gregory; Weizer, Alon; Guru, Khurshid A",Urology,462,5

To supplement the national inventory of N95 respirators, contingency and crisis capacity strategies were implemented and incorporated a component that endorsed the use of non-NIOSH-approved respiratory protective devices that conformed to select international standards. The development and execution of this strategy required the collaborative effort of numerous agencies. The Food and Drug Administration temporarily authorized non-NIOSH-approved international respiratory protective devices through an emergency use authorization, OSHA relaxed their enforcement guidance concerning their use in US workplaces, and NIOSH initiated a supplemental performance assessment process to verify the quality of international devices.

Methods A convenience sample of smokers at 2 Pennsylvania hospital EDs who met inclusion/exclusion criteria were approached to participate in a brief intervention known as screening, treatment initiation, and referral (STIR) counseling that included phone follow-up. Demographic information, current smoking status, and specific physician prescription and follow-up recommendations were collected. Approximately 3 months later, patients were contacted to determine current smoking status and actions taken since their ED visit. Results One hundred six patients were approached and 7 (6.6%) opted out of the intervention. Patients who did not opt out were evaluated for appropriate use of smoking cessation-related medications; 35 (35.4%) opted out of the prescription(s) and 6 (6.1%) were not indicated. Twenty-one (21.2%) patients opted out of ambulatory referral follow-ups with primary care and/or tobacco treatment program; one (1.0%) was not indicated for referral.

The findings showed 54 PTM sites without a transmembrane domain. Also, ROP38 was proved a non-allergenic and antigenic protein. The protein had Sec signal peptide (Sec/SPI) with 0.8762 likelihood. The secondary structure included 52.68% random coil, 29.57% alpha helix and 17.74% extended strand. Based on Ramachandran plot output for refined model, 95.3%, 3.4%, and 1.4% of amino acid residues were incorporated in the favored, allowed, and outlier regions, respectively. B-cell epitopes TFPGDDIQTSS (67-72) and KAKNKWGRTRYTLQG (207-221) as well as T-cell epitope LSPVGFFTAL (6-15) possessed the highest antigenic index in the protein sequence. This paper is a premise for further researches, and provides insights for the development of a suitable vaccine against toxoplasmosis. More empirical studies are required using the ROP38 alone or in combination with other antigens/epitopes in the future.","Nosrati, MohammadReza Chaechi; Ghasemi, Ezatollah; Shams, Morteza; Shamsinia, Sadegh; Yousefi, Ali; Nourmohammadi, Hassan; Javanmardi, Erfan; Kordi, Bahareh; Majidiani, Hamidreza; Ghaffari, Ali Dalir",Microbial pathogenesis,462,16

Therefore, this study was carried with the aims to explore whether blood Bcl-2 concentrations at diagnosis of sepsis are different in survivor and non-survivor septic patients, are associated with mortality, and are useful for the mortality prediction. METHODS Intensive Care Units from 3 Spanish hospitals participated in this observational and prospective study with septic patients and serum Bcl-2 concentrations at diagnosis of sepsis were determined. Mortality at 30 days was as outcome variable. RESULTS We found that 30-day non-surviving patients (n=81) showed lower serum Bcl-2 levels (p=0.003) than surviving patients (n=140). We found that serum concentrations of Bcl-2<4.4ng/mL were associated with mortality (OR=3.228; 95% CI=1.406-7.415; p=0.006) in the multiple logistic regression analysis, and that showed an area under the curve for mortality prediction of 62% (95% CI=55-68%; p=0.003). CONCLUSIONS In our study appears novel findings such as higher blood Bcl-2 concentrations in survivor than in non-survivor septic patients, the association between low blood Bcl-2 concentrations and mortality of septic patients, and the ability of blood Bcl-2 concentrations for the prediction of septic patient mortality.","Lorente, Leonardo; Martín, María M; Ortiz-López, Raquel; González-Rivero, Agustín F; Pérez-Cejas, Antonia; Martín, María; Gonzalez, Verónica; Pérez, Alejandra; Rodin, Mario; Jiménez, Alejandro",Enfermedades infecciosas y microbiologia clinica,462,33

While these self-exciting processes have a simple formulation, they are able to model incredibly complex phenomena. Traditionally Hawkes processes are a continuous-time process, however we enable these models to be applied to a wider range of problems by considering a discrete-time variant of Hawkes processes. We illustrate this through the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) as a substantive case study. While alternative models, such as compartmental and growth curve models, have been widely applied to the COVID-19 epidemic, the use of discrete-time Hawkes processes allows us to gain alternative insights. This paper evaluates the capability of discrete-time Hawkes processes by retrospectively modelling daily counts of deaths as two distinct phases in the progression of the COVID-19 outbreak: the initial stage of exponential growth and the subsequent decline as preventative measures become effective. We consider various countries that have been adversely affected by the epidemic, namely, Brazil, China, France, Germany, India, Italy, Spain, Sweden, the United Kingdom and the United States. These countries are all unique concerning the spread of the virus and their corresponding response measures, in particular, the types and timings of preventative actions. However, we find that this simple model is useful in accurately capturing the dynamics of the process, despite hidden interactions that are not directly modelled due to their complexity, and differences both within and between countries. The utility of this model is not confined to the current COVID-19 epidemic, rather this model could be used to explain many other complex phenomena. It is of interest to have simple models that adequately describe these complex processes with unknown dynamics. As models become more complex, a simpler representation of the process can be desirable for the sake of parsimony.","Browning, Raiha; Sulem, Deborah; Mengersen, Kerrie; Rivoirard, Vincent; Rousseau, Judith",,462,24

Furthermore, PPE for the eyes and mouth, such as face shields, allow for additional protection when working with aerosols. 3-D printing enables the easy and rapid production of lightweight plastic frameworks based on open-source data. The practicality and clinical suitability of four face shields printed using a fused deposition modeling printer were examined. The weight, printing time, and required tools for assembly were evaluated. To assess the clinical suitability, each face shield was worn for one hour by 10 clinicians and rated using a visual analogue scale. The filament weight (21-42 g) and printing time (1:40-3:17 h) differed significantly between the four frames. Likewise, the fit, wearing comfort, space for additional PPE, and protection varied between the designs. For clinical suitability, a chosen design should allow sufficient space for goggles and N95 respirators as well as maximum coverage of the facial area. Consequently, two datasets are recommended. For the final selection of the ideal dataset to be used for printing, scalability and economic efficiency need to be carefully balanced with an acceptable degree of protection.","Wesemann, C.; Pieralli, S.; Fretwurst, T.; Nold, J.; Nelson, K.; Schmelzeisen, R.; Hellwig, E.; Spies, B.

While advanced medical imaging technologies of today deliver detailed diagnostic information, a low-dose, fast, and inexpensive option for early detection and/or follow-ups is still lacking. Here, we report on the first human application of a novel modality, namely X-ray dark-field chest imaging, which might fill this gap. Enabling the assessment of microstructural changes in lung parenchyma, this technique presents a more sensitive alternative to conventional chest X-rays, and yet requires only a fraction of the dose applied in computed tomography (CT). Methods For this first clinical evaluation, we have built a novel dark-field chest X-ray system, which is also capable of simultaneously acquiring a conventional thorax radiograph (7 seconds, 0.035 mSv effective dose). Representing a major medical condition, we selected chronic obstructive pulmonary disease as study subject to obtain a first impression of potential diagnostic benefits relevant to humans. For a collective of 77 patients with different disease stages, X-ray dark-field- and CT-images were acquired and visually assessed by 5 readers. In addition, pulmonary function tests were performed for every patient. The individual data sets were evaluated in a statistical work-up using correlation testing, rank-based analysis of variance, and pair-wise post-hoc comparison. Findings Compared to CT-based parameters (quantitative emphysema: rho=-0.27, p=0.0893 and visual emphysema: rho=-0.45, p=0.0028), the dark-field signal (rho=0.62, p<0.0001) yields a stronger correlation with diffusion capacity in the evaluated collective. Emphysema assessment based on dark-field chest X-ray features yields consistent conclusions with findings from visual CT image interpretation and shows improved diagnostic performance in comparison to conventional clinical tests characterizing emphysema. Interpretation X-ray dark-field chest imaging allows the diagnosis of pulmonary emphysema as it provides relevant information representing the structural condition of lung parenchyma. Significant diagnostic benefits are also expected for other lung disorders.

This makes some countries implement policies to impose lockdowns to prevent the spread of the Coronavirus. A mathematic model for Covid-19 though stochastic transmission model has been proposed to estimate how transmission had varied over time during 2020. The previous mathematic modeling about Covid-19 almost exhibits exponential-shaped trends. Therefore, this study aims to formulate a deployment approach function of Covid-19 using the statistical thermodynamics concept. The spread function is developed from the distribution of velocity and rate of molecules by applying several molecular hypotheses. The formulation is done by making several analogies related to the social intervention, medical aspect, and weather conditions. Relating to relative humidity, it is not the main parameter, but it is used as a correction factor to temperature. The results in the exponential curves show that social intervention and medical aspects are more significant in preventing the Covid-19 transmission rather than the weather condition.

With all uncertainty, fears and disorientation, it’s no surprise that many people have developed an AD linked to the sudden changes brought about by COVID-19, such as threat to life, imposed restrictions, and the associated changes. Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) has been found to be effective for depression and anxiety problems, little is known, however, about its efficacy for adjustment disorder.ObjectivesThe aim of the current research was to evaluate if 4 weeks long, modified internet-delivered MBCT can reduce symptoms of Covid-19 related AD.Methods438 individuals with a diagnosis of AD were recruited to take part in the study. They were randomly assigned to i-MBCT, i-progressive muscle relaxation training (i-PMR), and Waiting List (WL). Assessments with questionnaires evaluating AD (ADMN-20), depression (PHQ-9, HADS-D), and anxiety (HADS-A, GAD-7) were filled at baseline, 4-week, and 1-month post-randomization. 142 individuals completed baseline and 4 week assessment (i-MBCT, n= 34;i-PMR, n= 36 and WL, n=72).ResultsWe found a significant reduction in AD symptoms following the i-MBCT group, whereas no change was found in both control conditions. While a decrease in depressive and anxiety was found in both i-MBCT and i-PMR groups, the greatest reduction has been observed in i-MBCT.ConclusionsThese preliminary findings suggest that i-MBCT can be an effective intervention in treating Covid-19 related AD, but more studies are needed.DisclosureNo significant relationships.","Holas, P.",European Psychiatry,462,1

A feasibility study is necessary regarding the practicality of the application of neoliberalist policies in Zimbabwe’s water sector. This is important because there has been a lack of water in urban and rural areas of Zimbabwe even before the COVID-19 era. Aim: The objective of this study was to investigate the feasibility of the commercialisation of water in Zimbabwe. Setting: The formation of the state-owned Zimbabwe National Water Authority signified a move towards the solidification of the commercialisation of the water sector in Zimbabwe, based in part on neoliberal principles. Methods: This study is a conceptual study, involving the review of various sources of literature to identify trends in the commercialisation of Zimbabwe’s water sector. This study is descriptive in nature and involves the use of secondary data gathered from various publications. This study also makes use of a case study approach. Results: The findings of this study show that the commercialisation of the water sector in Zimbabwe is practical to a certain extent;however, it needs to be performed in a way that acknowledges existing strengths and weaknesses with continuous monitoring and evaluation taking place. Conclusion: While commercialisation is a necessary tool to incentivising economic water usage and generate revenue, there is a need to ensure that those who cannot afford to pay for water in Zimbabwe are safeguarded in order to guarantee their access to basic water, which is their human right.","Mukonavanhu, Tinashe Ukwandu Damian Nel-Sanders Danielle",Africa's Public Service Delivery and Performance Review,462,1

We examine the cost-effectiveness of four gHAT elimination strategies in Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), which has the highest burden of gHAT. Methods: We compared four strategies against gHAT by coupling a transmission model with a health outcomes model in five settings -- spanning low- to high-risk. Alongside passive surveillance (PS) in fixed health facilities, the strategies included active screening (AS) at average or high coverage levels, both alone or with vector control (VC). A scale-back algorithm was devised to simulate cessation of AS and VC when no cases were reported for three consecutive years. Outcomes were denominated in disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) and costs until 2040 were denominated in 2018 US$. Results: In high or moderate-risk settings, costs of gHAT strategies are primarily driven by AS and, if used, VC. Due to the cessation of AS and VC most investments (75-80%) will be made by 2030 and VC might be cost-saving while ensuring EOT. In low-risk settings, costs are driven by PS, and minimum-cost strategies consisting of AS and PS lead to EOT by 2030 with high probability. Conclusion: In many settings, the case for EOT by 2030 is a sensible use of resources, and investments in gHAT will decelerate within this decade in moderate- and low-risk regions.","Antillon, M.; Huang, C.-I.; Crump, R.

To examine this issue, we adopted the measure of countries’ progress for the SDGs in the SDG Index Scores (SDGS) and employed two analytical devices. The first was regression-aided adjustment of the number of deaths and confirmed cases. The second was the use of robust regressions to control the undue influence of outliers. The results are mixed. Between the SDGS and the adjusted infection rates, we found no significant correlation;however, between the SDGS and the adjusted death rates, the correlation was negative and statistically significant. These results provide a nuanced contrast to the hasty conclusions some of us might be tempted to draw from apparent positive correlations between SDGS and the cases and the deaths. The SDGs represent the fruit of painstaking global efforts to encourage and coordinate international action to enhance sustainability. We find the results reassuring, in that they suggest that the countries with higher SDGS have been able to control the devastation of deaths from COVID-19 more effectively, despite being unable to control the propagation of infections.","Kim, Taejong Kim Hyosun",Sustainability,462,1

Methods We invited confirmed COVID-19 cases and their household members to attend up to four household visits with collection of nasopharyngeal and serum samples over 28 days after index case onset. We calculated secondary attack rates (SAR) based on the presence of SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein IgG antibodies (IgG Ab) and/or neutralizing antibodies (NAb) overall and per households. Three and six months later, we assessed the persistence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Findings We recruited 39 index cases and 90 household members. Among 87 household members evaluated, SAR was 48% (n=42), including 37 symptomatic secondary cases.

Hence, the main objective of this article is to propose a prevention technique through the study of an electronic device that allows users to keep their safety distance, while reminding them of the approach of a hand towards their face. It is an electronic pin featuring PIR sensors, with lenses designed to detect at distances 1.5 m. Containing a battery for power, a button, which turn on or off the pin, depending on whether you are in a bus for example or in an airport. Besides, this simple electronic component designed, pin will have suitable cost for all social categories. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Moulebe, L.

I will argue that the current Covid-19 pandemic shows us that being in the immediacy of the embodied presence of one's students is intimately intertwined with being responsive to the needs of students, which highlights that teaching is not only the transmission of intellectual knowledge and skills but first and foremost an ethical attunement to the suffering of the Other. Levinas argues that teaching is in its essence a relation between unique individuals;a uniqueness that originates in the individual's unconditional responsibility to each and every other human being. This unconditional responsibility is for Levinas the non-mediated embodied sensitivity to the needs of the Other;an openness that precedes freedom and the conscious choice of a person. In this article I claim this embodied sensitivity is jeopardised in online education, which makes it harder for the teacher to attune to the needs of every student. The risk we run is that the face of the Other remains ‘plastic’, which makes it more difficult for the teacher to attune to the specific needs of students. I will argue that online teaching should not only concentrate on enabling the transmission of knowledge but should also invest in creating an environment of intimacy that enables responsiveness and genuine contact. © 2021 The Authors.

At the moment there is hardly any research on the optimal and early treatment of these comorbidities. The COACH project (Chronic Conditions in Adolescents: Implementation and Evaluation of Patient-centered Collaborative Healthcare), funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research, aims to identify psychological stress in chronically ill adolescents at an early stage, to gain a better understanding and optimise treatment. Methods: As part of the COACH project, an anxiety and depression screening tool was implemented in the German CF register Mukoweb. Based on the current international guidelines, the evaluated questionnaires PHQ-9 and GAD-7 are completed once a year in participating German clinics by adolescents with CF aged 12 to 21 years and transferred directly to Mukoweb. Patients are then offered the opportunity to participate in further sub-projects, which are intended to improve depressive and anxiety distress by supporting strengths and strategies in coping with their illness. Results: So far, 7 CF centres are participating in the COACH project. Screening was performed in 96 patients with a median age of 16.6 years, 56.3% of which were female. In 19.8% of the patients screened, the result was in the abnormal range with a screening result of PHQ-9 ≥7 or GAD-7 ≥7 (as of Dec 31, 2020). Due to the COVID-19 pandemic restrictions, recruitment has been very delayed in 2020. Conclusion: The first interim results show that one in five of the adolescents with CF examined suffers from anxiety or depression and the care for these comorbidities is of high relevance. Based on the study results of the COACH project, the aim is to raise awareness of Mental Health Screening and to provide evidence-based recommendations for collaborative care of those affected.","Temming, S.; Thalemann, R.; Andert, M.; Nährlich, L.; Baumeister, H.; Mall, M.; Staab, D.",Journal of Cystic Fibrosis,462,10

However, questions remain regarding the sensitivity of WBE and its use in low prevalence settings. In this study, we estimated the total number of COVID-19 cases required for detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater. To do this, we leveraged a unique situation where, over a 4-month period, all symptomatic and asymptomatic cases, in a population of approximately 120,000, were precisely known and mainly located in a single managed isolation and quarantine facility (MIQF) building. From 9 July to 6 November 2020, 24-hr composite wastewater samples (n = 113) were collected daily from the sewer outside the MIQF, and from the municipal wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) located 5 km downstream. New daily COVID-19 cases at the MIQF ranged from 0 to 17, and for most of the study period there were no cases outside the MIQF identified. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in 54.0% (61/113) at the WWTP, compared to 95.6% (108/113) at the MIQF. We used logistic regression to estimate the shedding of SARS-CoV-2 RNA into wastewater based on four infectious shedding models. With a total of 5 and 10 COVID-19 infectious cases per 100,000 population (0.005 % and 0.01% prevalence) the predicated probability of SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection at the WWTP was estimated to be 28 and 41%, respectively. When a more realistic proportional shedding model was used, this increased to 58% and 87% for 5 and 10 cases, respectively. In other words, when 10 individuals were actively shedding SARS-CoV-2 RNA in a catchment of 100,000 individuals, there was a high likelihood of detecting viral RNA in wastewater. SARS-CoV-2 RNA detections at the WWTP were associated with increasing COVID-19 cases. Our results show that WBE provides a reliable and sensitive platform for detecting infections at the community scale, even when case prevalence is low, and can be of use as an early warning system for community outbreaks.","Hewitt, J.; Trowsdale, S.; Armstrong, B.; Chapman, J.

A model was built from the behavior of the operators, especially when an alarm happened. Introduction: The frequency of ventilator use is increasing due to COVID-19. Thus, there is an increasing need for staff who can manipulate the ventilator appropriately. There is a need for a support system that will enable the operator to manipulate the equipment appropriately for the situation, especially when an alarm happens. Methods: The operator’s behavior during the ventilator alarm was video-recorded. The verbal protocol data were also recorded to examine the thinking during the manipulation. After the experiment, the video recordings were reviewed with the participants and interviewed about the reasons for their speeches and behaviors. Results: As a result of behavioral analysis of each participant, behavioral patterns split into “Skilled Group (SG)” and “Inexperienced Group (IG)” around about 17 s after the alarm happened. From the verbal protocol data and interview data obtained from the experiment, the reasons why the behaviors divided into two groups were analyzed. Based on these results, the cognitive reasons behind the behavior were clarified. In addition, a cognitive model of the operators when a ventilator alarm happens was built. Applications: The results of this research can be applied not only to the manipulation of ventilator alarms, but also to the manipulation of medical equipment, for example, ECMO (Extra Corporeal Membrane Oxygenation). © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Hamaguchi, J.; Yamamoto, S.","Thematic area Human Interface and the Management of Information, HIMI 2021 Held as Part of the 23rd HCI International Conference, HCII 2021",462,32

In this region, select mutations in K13 can result in delayed parasite clearance rates in vivo and enhanced survival in the ring-stage survival assay (RSA) in vitro. Our genotyping of 3,299 P. falciparum isolates across 11 sub-Saharan countries reveals the continuing dominance of wild-type K13 and confirms the emergence of a K13 R561H variant in Rwanda. Using gene editing, we provide definitive evidence that this mutation, along with M579I and C580Y, can confer variable degrees of in vitro ART resistance in African P. falciparum strains. C580Y and M579I were both associated with substantial fitness costs in African parasites, which may counter-select against their dissemination in high-transmission settings. We also report the impact of multiple K13 mutations, including the predominant variant C580Y, on RSA survival rates and fitness in multiple Southeast Asian strains. No change in ART susceptibility was observed upon editing point mutations in ferrodoxin or mdr2, earlier associated with ART resistance in Southeast Asia. These data point to the lack of an evident biological barrier to mutant K13 mediating ART resistance in Africa, while identifying their detrimental impact on parasite growth.","Stokes, Barbara H.; Rubiano, Kelly; Dhingra, Satish K.; Mok, Sachel; Straimer, Judith; Gnädig, Nina F.; Bath, Jade R.; Deni, Ioanna; Ward, Kurt E.; Striepen, Josefine; Yeo, Tomas; Ross, Leila S.; Legrand, Eric; Ariey, Frédéric; Cunningham, Clark H.; Souleymane, Issa M.; Gansané, Adama; Nzoumbou-Boko, Romaric; Ndayikunda, Claudette; Kabanywanyi, Abdunoor M.; Uwimana, Aline; Smith, Samuel J.; Kolley, Olimatou; Ndounga, Mathieu; Warsame, Marian; Leang, Rithea; Nosten, François; Anderson, Timothy J.C.; Rosenthal, Philip J.; Ménard, Didier; Fidock, David A.",bioRxiv,462,16

We here investigated the geographical character of the early spread of the infection and correlated it with several annual satellite and ground indexes of air quality in China, the United States, Italy, Iran, France, Spain, Germany, and the United Kingdom. The time of the analysis corresponded with the end of the first wave infection in China, namely June 2020. We found more viral infections in those areas afflicted by high PM 2.5 and nitrogen dioxide values. Higher mortality was also correlated with relatively poor air quality. In Italy, the correspondence between the Po Valley pollution and SARS-CoV-2 infections and induced mortality was the starkest, originating right in the most polluted European area. Spain and Germany did not present a noticeable gradient of pollution levels causing non-significant correlations. Densely populated areas were often hotspots of lower air quality levels but were not always correlated with a higher viral incidence. Air pollution has long been recognised as a high risk factor for several respiratory-related diseases and conditions, and it now appears to be a risk factor for COVID-19 as well. As such, air pollution should always be included as a factor for the study of airborne epidemics and further included in public health policies.

Materials and methods. The patient records who were admitted to our Hospital Urology outpatient clinic during March 20th - May 29th, 2019, and March 20th - May 29th, 2020 has been evaluated and constituted two groups as Non-Pandemic Group and Pandemic Group according to application date. Groups have been compared according to demographic and cohort-specific variables. Results. There has been a statistically significant difference between groups according to age, gender, admission, prescription, and hospitalization rates. During the pandemic period, we found that the rates of patient admission, frequency and the number of hospitalizations decreased, and the rate of prescribing increased. Also, we found that male patients aged 18-65 years were admitted more frequently during the pandemic period. The analysis of the subgroups constituted according to diagnostic segmentation revealed that the patients with lower urinary tract symptoms and pediatric urology patients decreased while infertility and infection groups were increased. Conclusion. The urology outpatient clinic has been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic from various perspectives.

Forecasting of admissions can help for the efficient organisation of hospital care. We aimed to forecast the number of admissions to psychiatric hospitals before and during the COVID-19 pandemic and we compared the performance of machine learning models and time series models. This would eventually allow to support timely resource allocation for optimal treatment of patients. Methods We used admission data from 9 psychiatric hospitals in Germany between 2017 and 2020. We compared machine learning models with time series models in weekly, monthly and yearly forecasting before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our models were trained and validated with data from the first two years and tested in prospectively sliding time-windows in the last two years. Results A total of 90,686 admissions were analysed. The models explained up to 90% of variance in hospital admissions in 2019 and 75% in 2020 with the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. The best models substantially outperformed a one-step seasonal naive forecast (seasonal mean absolute scaled error (sMASE) 2019: 0.59, 2020: 0.76). The best model in 2019 was a machine learning model (elastic net, mean absolute error (MAE): 7.25). The best model in 2020 was a time series model (exponential smoothing state space model with Box-Cox transformation, ARMA errors and trend and seasonal components, MAE: 10.44), which adjusted more quickly to the shock effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Models forecasting admissions one week in advance did not perform better than monthly and yearly models in 2019 but they did in 2020. The most important features for the machine learning models were calendrical variables. Conclusion Model performance did not vary much between different modelling approaches before the COVID-19 pandemic and established forecasts were substantially better than one-step seasonal naive forecasts. However, weekly time series models adjusted quicker to the COVID-19 related shock effects. In practice, different forecast horizons could be used simultaneously to allow both early planning and quick adjustments to external effects.","Wolff, J.; Klimke, A.; Marschollek, M.; Kacprowski, T.",,462,24

The present study aims at quantifying this effect by means of ground-level concentrations of NO2, PM2.5, as well as aerosol optical depth (AOD) measurements and tropospheric NO2 column number density (NO2 TVCD), during the imposed governmental restrictions in spring 2020. The analyses were performed for both urban and non-built-up areas across the whole of Poland accompanied by Warsaw (urban site) and Strzyzow (a background site). The results revealed that mean PM2.5 concentrations in spring 2020 for urban and non-built-up areas across Poland and for Warsaw were 20%, 23%, 15% lower than the 10-year average, respectively.

Methods: We conducted an overview of systematic reviews of health impacts of climate change. We systematically searched the literature using a predefined search strategy, inclusion, and exclusion criteria. We included systematic reviews that explored at least one health impact of climate change. We organized systematic reviews according to their key characteristics, including geographical regions, year of publication and authors' affiliations. We mapped the climate effects and health outcomes being studied and synthesized major findings. Findings: We included ninety-four systematic reviews. Most were published after 2015 and approximately one fifth contained meta-analyses. Reviews synthesized evidence about five categories of climate impacts; the two most common were meteorological and extreme weather events. Reviews covered ten health outcome categories; the three most common were 1) infectious diseases, 2) mortality, and 3) respiratory, cardiovascular, cardiopulmonary or neurological outcomes. Most reviews suggested a deleterious impact of climate change on multiple adverse health outcomes, although the majority also called for more research. Interpretation: Overall, most systematic reviews suggest that climate change is associated with worse human health. Future research could explore the potential explanations between these associations to propose adaptation and mitigation strategies and could include psychological and broader social health impacts of climate change.

Additionally, we posit that such school-based operations could become the nexus of a primary food-security hub, alongside the Lunches in Schools programme, working in a tailor-made fashion bespoke to whänau without a charity or welfare label. Given the recent well-resourced COVID-19-related investment into the business world and the ongoing lack of progress in the reduction of child poverty, in the post-COVID-19-lockdown environment, simple structural rearrangements for the chronically food insecure are likely to become politically acceptable to the nation. © 2021, Nga Pae o te Maramatanga.

Using these “molecular scars” as a guide, we discovered a vertebrate-specific MItochondrial STress Response circuit (MISTR). MISTR proteins are associated with electron transport chain factors and activated by stress signals such as interferon-gamma and hypoxia. Upon stress, ultraconserved miRNAs downregulate MISTR1 followed by replacement with paralogs MISTR AntiViral (MISTRAV) or MISTR Hypoxia (MISTRH), depending on the insult. While cells lacking MISTR1 are more sensitive to apoptotic triggers, cells lacking MISTRAV or expressing the poxvirus-encoded vMISTRAV exhibit resistance to the same insults. Rapid evolution signatures across primate genomes for MISTR1 and MISTRAV indicate ancient and ongoing conflicts with pathogens. MISTR proteins are also found in plants, yeasts, and an algal virus indicating ancient origins and suggesting diverse means of altering mitochondrial function under stress. The discovery of MISTR circuitry highlights the use of evolution-guided studies to reveal fundamental biological processes.","Sorouri, Mahsa; Chang, Tyron; Jesudhasan, Palmy; Pinkham, Chelsea; Elde, Nels C.; Hancks, Dustin C.",bioRxiv,462,19

We surveyed the mutational profiles of Delta VOC genomes between September 2020 and mid-August 2021 and identified a previously unreported mutation pattern at amino acid position 142 in the N-terminal domain (NTD) of the spike protein which demonstrated multiple rounds of mutation from G142 to D142 and back. This pattern of frequent back mutations was observed at multiple time points and across Delta VOC sub-lineages. The etiology for these recurrent mutations is unclear but raises the possibility of host-directed editing of the SARS-CoV-2 genome. Within Delta VOC this mutation is associated with higher viral load, further enhanced in the presence of another NTD mutation (T95I) which was also frequently observed in these cases. Protein modeling of both mutations predicts alterations of the surface topography of the NTD by G142D, specifically disturbance of the 'super site' epitope that binds NTD-directed neutralizing antibodies (NAbs). The appearance of frequent and repeated G142D followed by D142G back mutations is previously unreported in SARS-CoV-2 and may represent viral adaptation to evolving host immunity characterized by increasing frequency of spike NAbs, from both prior infection and vaccine-based immunity. The emergence of alterations of the NTD in and around the main NAb epitope is a concerning development in the ongoing evolution of SARS-CoV-2 which may contribute to increased infectivity, immune evasion and 'breakthrough infections' characteristic of Delta VOC. Future vaccine and therapy development may benefit by recognizing the emergence of these novel spike NTD mutations and considering their impact on antibody recognition, viral neutralization, infectivity, replication, and viral load.","Shen, L.; Triche, T.

Design: A retrospective study was conducted in children (0-18 years), admitted in two pediatric hospitals of Rio de Janeiro city, between January 17 and July 3, 2021 with confirmed COVID-19 by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction or serological tests. Trends of COVID-19 pediatric admissions number during the first 24 weeks of COVID-19 vaccination in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil and the pre-vaccine period were measured by linear regression. Participants: Children admitted in pediatric hospitals in Rio de Janeiro, city, Brazil Results: The number of total admitted patients (with all diseases) were 5340 during the pre-vaccine period, being 94 (1.8%) of them with confirmed COVID-19, and 4182 children admitted during the vaccine period, with 86 confirmed COVID-19 patients (2.1 %) (p=0.29). Media of cases admitted per/week were 2.02 in pre-vaccine period and 3.6 during the first 24 weeks of COVID vaccination (p=0.009). One death was reported in the pre-vaccine period and four in the vaccine period (p=0.14). Trends of increase in the number of admitted cases were verified both in the pre-vaccine period as in the vaccine period, being more expressive in the last one. Conclusion: There was trend of increase in number of children admitted with confirmed COVID-19 during the first 24 weeks of COVID-vaccination in Rio de Janeiro, city. Considering that few people were fully vaccinated, reducing of number of admitted children with confirmed COVID-19 was not verified.","Araujo da Silva, A. R.; Esteves, M. D. M.; de Carvalho, B. R.

It connects the housing experience to broader systems of inequality in America. Following the Great Recession of 2007-2009, the US elections of 2008, the impact of COVID-19, and widespread demonstrations resulting from the murder of George Floyd by police, the sociopolitical and economic status of Blacks in the United States is at a critical point in history, with demand for major transformation. The authors reveal a history of racist practices against Blacks in many systems, including education, policing, incarceration, wealth transmission, voting restrictions, and housing segregation. The social costs of the recession are manifested in the daily lives of African American families. In addition to financial losses, African Americans are more likely to be plagued with issues related to poverty, chronic illnesses, and lack of trust of social and economic institutions. Research, policy, and practical implications of this research include identifying social and economic supports unique to African Americans and determining strategies to strengthen families;paramount to addressing racial disparities.

The mechanisms of infection and transmission of this coronavirus are largely unknown but some of the clearer recommendations are washing hands and surfaces. Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder has a lifetime prevalence of 2-3%, among the multiple symptoms, fear of dirt or being contaminated, and excessive washing are the most common affecting about 50% of patients.ObjectivesWe reviewed the available information to understand if there are changes in OCD symptoms during the pandemic.MethodsNon-systematic review of the literature with selection of scientific articles published in the past 6 months;by searching Pubmed and Medscape databases using the combination of MeSH descriptors. The following MeSH terms were used: Covid-19;SARS-Cov2;pandemic;obsessive compulsive disorder;OCD.ResultsFrom a theoretical point of view, the increased frequency of hand washing and the importance of following hand-washing steps can add to a ritualistic pattern, also cleaning hands every time a person comes from outside or contacts with others can be justified as a preventive action rather than considered a problem and it can be “normalized” by others as a pandemic response.ConclusionsIn conclusion, there is evidence that during quarantine an overall increase in obsession and compulsion severity emerged with contamination symptoms associated with worse outcomes. There is data on an increase in relapses with patients not asking for help in a timely manner. The current situation is unpredictable and rapidly changing. It is likely that more information about this topic will arise in the next months.","André, R.; Gonçalves, M. J.; Sereijo, C.; Abreu, M.",European Psychiatry,462,7

At the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak, pregnant women were classified as at risk and advised to shield. This may have caused increased generalised anxiety disorder and health anxiety across the demographic. This study aimed to explore current, actual and perceived levels of generalised anxiety disorder and health anxiety in pregnant women during the COVID-19 outbreak. A sample of 674 participants completed an online questionnaire consisting of demographic and pregnancy related questions, the GAD-7 and HAI. The COVID-19 outbreak has increased self-reported levels of general anxiety and health anxiety in pregnant women. Of the sample, 633 (94%) agreed that the outbreak had increased their general anxiety;607 (90.1%) also reported increased health anxiety. Due to the negative effects that anxieties may cause during pregnancy, it is recommended that reintroducing normality to pre- and postnatal healthcare, where safe to do so, will be beneficial.

The clinician can, first, observe the sketching process in real-time on a mobile tablet, e.g., in telemedicine settings or to follow Covid-19 distancing regulations. Second, the results of an automatic test analysis are presented to the clinician in real-time, thereby reducing manual scoring effort and producing objective reports. The presented research describes the architecture of our cognitive assessment tool and examines how accurately different machine learning (ML) models can automatically score cognitive tests, without a semantic content analysis. Our system uses a set of more than 170 pen features, calculated directly from the raw digital pen signal. We evaluate our system with 40 subjects from a geriatrics daycare clinic.

To date, Israel vaccinated substantial parts of the adult population, which enables extracting real world signals. The vaccination rollout started on Dec 20th 2020, utilized mainly the BNT162b2 vaccine, and focused on individuals who are 60 years or older. By now, more than 75% of the individuals of this age group have been at least 14 days after the first dose, compared to 25% of the individuals between ages 40-60 years old. Here, we traced the Ct value distribution of 16,297 positive qPCR tests in our lab between Dec 1st to Jan 31st that came from these two age groups. As we do not have access to the vaccine status of each test, our hypothesis was that if vaccines reduce viral load, we should see a difference in the Ct values between these two age groups in late January but not before. Consistent with this hypothesis, until Jan 15th, we did not find any statistically significant differences in the average Ct value between the groups. In stark contrast, our results in the last two weeks of January show a significant weakening in the average Ct value of 60+ individuals to the 40-60 group. To further corroborate these results, we also used a series nested linear models to explain the Ct values of the positive tests. This analysis favored a model that included an interaction between age and the late January time period, consistent with the effect of vaccination. We then used demographic data and the daily vaccination rates to estimate the effect of vaccination on viral load reduction. Our estimate suggests that vaccination reduces the viral load by 1.6x to 20x in individuals who are positive for SARS-CoV-2. This estimate might improve after more individuals receive the second dose. Taken together, our findings indicate vaccination is not only important for individual's protection but can reduce transmission.","Petter, E.; Mor, O.; Zuckerman, N.; Oz-Levi, D.; Younger, A.; Aran, D.; Erlich, Y.",,462,30

Innate and adaptive immune responses to viral infections are researched in vitro, in vivo, and in silico using mathematical and computational methods. The construction of computational models is an iterative and interactive process which combines existing knowledge and hypotheses (knowledge-driven approach) with empirical datasets (data-driven approach). The resulting models should ideally provide reusability, composability, and interoperability to support system simulation. The main premises of this paper are (1) computational models can be used not only for representation of existing knowledge, but also as experimental tools to demonstrate, exemplify, create, and serve as test-beds for the analysis of empirical data;and (2) computational models should be evaluated in terms of their usability (defined as a measure of how well a specified group of users can achieve predefined goals effectively, efficiently, and satisfactorily in a specified context of use). The usability measure is specified by the context information: user characteristics, their goals, and additional constraints (e.g., data availability, temporal limitations).

The emergence of COVID 19 forced almost every job to operate online so as to bridge the distance amongst individuals. The rapid increment in the needs of web application increases security threats on information and data. According to the Open Web Application Security Project, Structured Query Language Injection Attack (SQLIA) is a top security threat for web application. SQLIA inserts malicious code to gain access or to manipulate database information by cheating the server to bypass the code to the database, thereby causing a severe impact on web application. In this paper, permutation encoding method has been proposed to prevent SQLIA, which is based on encoding all database information using the proposed method. Initially, a special character is inserted to restrict the method from reversing. Subsequently, permutation encoding method is applied. Permutation refers to the method wherein the bit location is changed within three characters and then radix encoding is applied. Permutation is based on the primitive root value. Encoding has been used to hide permutation. The proposed method is implemented and tested using PHP and MySQL databases, where the proposal result has been compared with those of other proposal methods. The results with security analysis prove that the proposal method prevents SQLIA and protects database information. © 2021 ACM.","Hussain, M. A.; Abbdal Refish, S. H.; Khalefa, M. S.; Hussain, S.

Other murine glycoproteins in the Bgp subfamily, including Bgp1b and Bgp2, also can serve as MHV receptors when transfected into MHV-resistant cells. Previous studies have shown that the 108-amino-acid N-terminal domain of MHVR is essential for virus receptor activity and is the binding site for monoclonal antibody (MAb) CC1, an antireceptor MAb that blocks MHV infection in vivo and in vitro. To further elucidate the regions of MHVR required for virus receptor activity and MAb CC1 binding, we constructed chimeras between MHVR and other members of the CEA family and tested them for MHV strain A59 (MHV-A59) receptor activity and MAb CC1 binding activity. In addition, we used site-directed mutagenesis to introduce selected amino acid changes into the N-terminal domains of MHVR and these chimeras and tested the abilities of these mutant glycoproteins to bind MAb CC1 and to function as MHV receptors. Several recombinant glycoproteins exhibited virus receptor activity but did not bind MAb CC1, indicating that the virus and MAb binding sites on the N-terminal domain of MHVR are not identical. Analysis of the recombinant glycoproteins showed that a short region of MHVR, between amino acids 34 and 52, is critical for MHV-A59 receptor activity. Additional regions of the N-terminal variable domain and the constant domains, however, greatly affected receptor activity. Thus, the molecular context in which the amino acids critical for MHV-A59 receptor activity are found profoundly influences the virus receptor activity of the glycoprotein.","Wessner, D R; Shick, P C; Lu, J H; Cardellichio, C B; Gagneten, S E; Beauchemin, N; Holmes, K V; Dveksler, G S",Journal of virology,462,17

This analysis suggests that many results originally ascribed to associative changes can be more economically accounted for by nonassociative factors inherent in the experiments. Furthermore, the data show that neither one of the more economical nonassuciative explanations at either the sensory, the drive, or the response level can by itself account for the complex interactions observed. The studies dealing with drug effects in lesioned animals, and those using intracerebral treatments, point out several sites of action of muscarinic agonists and antagonists in the septum, the hippocampus, the amygdala, the striatum, the hypothalamus, midline thalamic nuclei, and the reticular formation. Therefore, the provisional conclusion must be that central muscarinic systems subserve several functions, ranging from the modulation of consummatory responses to the control of motor-act differentiation. Both the drug and the lesion studies show not only that the fronto-limbic system has a considerable role in the latter process, but also that the localization of motor-act differentiation under a given drive depends both on the category of the cue, and on the category of the response. Some comparisons between the effects of muscarinic agonists and blockers and those of other drugs indicate that the alteration of sensory-motor relations caused by the former can be separated from (i) the motor hyperactivity caused by amphetamine, which is relatively less dependent on sensory factors; (ii) the selective (response enhancements caused by the indole hallucinogen LSD25, which appear to be amenable to a disinhibition of drive; (iii) the attenuation of punishment suppression by sedative and antianxiety agents (benzodiazepines and subhypnotic doses of barbiturates); and (iv) the hyperarousal or hyperreactivity syndrome induced by compounds which deplete central 5-hydroixytryphamine stores, such as panachlorophenylalanine.","Bignami, G",Acta neurobiologiae experimentalis,462,7

Genomic DI RNA and subgenomic DI RNA accumulated at a constant ratio from 3 to 11 h postinfection (p.i.) in the cells infected with MHV-containing DI particles. Earlier, at 1 h p.i., this ratio was not constant; only genomic DI RNA accumulated, indicating that MHV RNA replication, but not MHV RNA transcription, was active during the first hour of MHV infection. Negative-strand genomic DI RNA and negative-strand subgenomic DI RNA were first detectable at 1 and 3 h p.i., respectively, and the amounts of both RNAs increased gradually until 6 h p.i. These data showed that at 2 h p.i., subgenomic DI RNA was undergoing synthesis in the cells in which negative-strand subgenomic DI RNA was undetectable. These data, therefore, signify that negative-strand genomic DI RNA, but not negative-strand subgenomic DI RNA, was an active template for subgenomic DI RNA synthesis early in infection.","An, S; Maeda, A; Makino, S",Journal of virology,462,1

EMG signals from 9 leg muscles and pedal forces were measured bilaterally during recumbent pedaling in 16 post-acute stroke patients and 12 age-matched healthy controls. Patients were asked to walk over a GaitRite mat and standard gait parameters were computed. Four muscle synergies were extracted through nonnegative matrix factorization in healthy subjects and patients unaffected legs. Two to four synergies were identified in the affected sides and the number of synergies significantly correlated with the Motricity Index (Spearman's coefficient = 0.521). The reduced coordination complexity resulted in a reduced biomechanical performance, with the two-module sub-group showing the lowest work production and mechanical effectiveness in the affected side. These patients also exhibited locomotor impairments (reduced gait speed, asymmetrical stance time, prolonged double support time). Significant correlations were found between cycling-based metrics and gait parameters, suggesting that neuro-mechanical quantities of pedaling can inform on walking dysfunctions. Our findings support the use of pedaling as a rehabilitation method and an assessment tool after stroke, mainly in the early phase, when patients can be unable to perform a safe and active gait training.","Ambrosini, Emilia; De Marchis, Cristiano; Pedrocchi, Alessandra; Ferrigno, Giancarlo; Monticone, Marco; Schmid, Maurizio; D'Alessio, Tommaso; Conforto, Silvia; Ferrante, Simona",Annals of biomedical engineering,462,33

In our hospital, VTE was diagnosed in 10% of COVID-19 patients admitted to the general ward (non-ICU patients) despite regular thromboprophylaxis. Deterioration in the course of COVID-19 has differential diagnoses such as progression of the infection itself, secondary bacterial pneumonia, left heart failure and in our experience not infrequently VTE. We therefore recommend to consider VTE in COVID-19 patients with a sudden clinical deterioration such as hypotension, tachycardia, unexplained hypoxaemia or insufficient clinical improvement and to perform CT-angiography if indicated. A high dose of thromboprophylaxis in COVID-19 patients may be considered because of increased coagulation activation.","Deenstra, Duco D; Nijziel, Marten R; Aldenkamp, Arnoud F; van Balkom, Roland H H; Smeenk, Frank W J M",Nederlands tijdschrift voor geneeskunde,462,28

METHODS The clinical data of 220 patients with intertrochanteric fracture and 261 patients with femoral neck fracture from September 2013 to December 2016 in our hospital (≥60 years old) was reviewed. The sodium, potassium and calcium values, and the underlying diseases of patients were recorded after the first blood test. These patients were divided into two groups according to the fracture site: femoral neck fracture group and intertrochanteric fracture group. Then, the differences between these two groups were compared to analyze the proportion of electrolyte disturbances in elderly patients with hip fracture, and explore its clinical significance. RESULTS Patients with intertrochanteric fractures were older than patients with femoral neck fracture. There was no significant difference in the prevalence of underlying diseases between these two groups. The incidence of hyponatremia, hypokalemia and hypocalcemia was 10.0%, 32.9% and 1.4%, respectively, in the femoral neck fracture group, and 24.3%, 21.1% and 7.7%, respectively, in the intertrochanteric fracture group. The incidence of hypernatremia, hyperkalemia and hypercalcemia was 1.4%, 1.4% and 0.9%, respectively, in the femoral neck fracture group, and 1.1%, 0.7% and 0.8%, respectively, in the intertrochanteric fracture group. CONCLUSION Patients with old hip fractures before an operation are prone to hyponatremia, hypokalemia and hypocalcemia, and most of them have mild electrolyte disorders, which needs to be corrected in time. Furthermore, some patients urgently need urgent supplementation ofblood electrolytes for some diseases, the correction of electrolyte disorders, and the prevention of serious adverse consequences.

Several European countries have reported considerable quantities of meat imported on commercial passenger flights. The objective of this study was to estimate the quantity of meat illegally imported into Switzerland, with a separate estimation for bushmeat. Data were obtained by participation in intervention exercises at Swiss international airports and by analysing data on seizures during the four-year period 2008 to 2011. The study revealed that a wide array of animal species was imported into Switzerland. From the database, the average annual weight of meat seized during the period analysed was 5.5 tonnes, of which 1.4% was bushmeat. However, in a stochastic model the total annual inflow of illegal meat imports was estimated at 1,013 tonnes (95% CI 226 to 4,192) for meat and 8.6 tonnes (95% CI 0.8 to 68.8) for bushmeat. Thus, even for a small European country such as Switzerland the quantities of illegally imported meat and meat products are substantial and the consequences for public and animal health could be high. To reduce the risk, it is essential that surveillance at European airports is harmonised and that passenger information campaigns clarify the consequences of the illegal import of meat, particularly bushmeat.","Falk, H; Dürr, S; Hauser, R; Wood, K; Tenger, B; Lörtscher, M; Schüpbach-Regula, G",Revue scientifique et technique,462,1

Current diagnostic methods include serologic testing and histologic examination. During a recent rat coronavirus outbreak, we tested a rapid, noninvasive method of RCV diagnosis that involved use of reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis to detect RCV RNA on cages housing infected rats. METHODS The RT-PCR was used to detect RCV RNA in tissues from infected rats and on cages housing infected rats and to amplify portions of the RCV N, M, and S genes for molecular characterization. RESULTS The RT-PCR detected RCV RNA on cages and in tissues from infected rats. The RCV-NJ N gene is most closely related to the MHV-Y N gene. The M proteins of RCV-NJ and RCV-SDA are 99% homologous, and the six RCV S protein fragments are 97 to 100% homologous. CONCLUSIONS Use of RT-PCR with cage-swab specimens was capable of diagnosing RCV infection in and viral excretion from rats. Additionally, molecular characterization of the N, M, and S genes of RCV-NJ provided baseline information that can be used in performing further epidemiologic studies.","Compton, S R; Vivas-Gonzalez, B E; Macy, J D",Laboratory animal science,462,33

By using one- or two-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, chemical cross-linking, and sucrose gradient centrifugation, we found that the majority of the G1 and G2 glycoproteins are assembled into noncovalently linked G1-G2 heterodimers. At the same time, a fraction of the G2 protein, possibly produced independently of the G1 protein, is assembled into G2 homodimers. Kinetic analysis indicates that heterodimerization occurs between newly synthesized G1 and G2 within 3 min after protein synthesis, and that the G1 and G2 glycoproteins are associated as dimeric forms both during transport and after accumulation in the Golgi complex. Analysis of a G1-truncated G2 mutant, which is also targeted to the Golgi complex, showed that these molecules also assemble into dimeric forms, which are linked by disulfide bonds. Both the G1-G2 heterodimer and the G2 homodimer were found to be able to exit from the endoplasmic reticulum. Differences in transport kinetics observed for the G1 and G2 proteins may be due to the differences in the transport efficiency between the G1-G2 heterodimer and the G2 homodimer from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi complex. These and previous results (S.-Y. Chen, Y. Matsuoka, and R.W. Compans, Virology 183:351-365, 1991) suggest that Golgi retention of the G2 homodimer occurs by association with the G1-G2 heterodimer, whereas the Golgi targeting of the G1-G2 heterodimer occurs by a specific retention mechanism.","Chen, S Y; Compans, R W",Journal of virology,462,10

PATIENTS AND METHODS Materials and methods: 306 volunteers aged 18-65 years participated in this study. All participants were tested during strict quarantine in April 2020. In order to diagnose the personality traits related to ambiguity tolerance, we used Budner's scale of tolerance-intolerance of ambiguity. To determine the features of experiences we used the survey, which included 40 statements and 12 emotional states related to the cognitive, emotional-evaluative, and behavioral components of the person's self-image. RESULTS Results: The overwhelming majority of volunteers perceive the pandemic as a dangerous, threatening, uncertain situation and make hasty decisions on the base of polar judgments, react with anxiety, attempt to avoid uncertainty, rejection of everything unusual. Their experiences were filled with feelings of powerlessness and deterioration in mood. For the majority of our subjects, the situation of uncertainty is the source of intolerance. Negative consequences appeared in the behavior (loss of time management skills, laziness). There are direct relationships between the factor of shock and anxiety with the sources of intolerance, novelty and complexity, and general intolerance. The cognitive component of the experience was the least pronounced and involved only after an emotional experience. CONCLUSION Conclusions: It has been established that cognitive rethinking of the self-isolation during the COVID-19 pandemic is possible after an emotional response and leads to a change in the behavioral stereotypes.","Pogorilska, Nataliia I; Synelnykov, Roman Y; Palamar, Borys I; Tukaiev, Sergii V; Nezhyva, Liudmyla L",Wiadomosci lekarskie,462,16

In spite of its epidemiological importance, little is known of the association of PRRSV or other arteriviruses with gonadal tissues. We experimentally infected a group of boars with PRRSV 12068-96, a virulent field strain. By combined use of in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry, we detected infection by PRRSV in the testes of these boars. The PRRSV testicular replication in testis centers on two types of cells: (i) epithelial germ cells of the seminiferous tubules, primarily spermatids and spermatocytes, and (ii) macrophages, which are located in the interstitium of the testis. Histopathologically, hypospermatogenesis, formation of multinucleated giant cells (MGCs), and abundant germ cell depletion and death were observed. We obtained evidence that such germ cell death occurs by apoptosis, as determined by a characteristic histologic pattern and evidence of massive DNA fragmentation detected in situ (TUNEL [terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated digoxigenin-UTP nick end labeling] assay). Simultaneously with these testicular alterations, we observed that there is a significant increase in the number of immature sperm cells (mainly MGCs, spermatids, and spermatocytes) in the ejaculates of the PRRSV-inoculated boars and that these cells are infected with PRRSV. Our results indicate that PRRSV may infect target cells other than macrophages, that these infected cells can be primarily responsible for the excretion of infectious PRRSV in semen, and that PRRSV induces apoptosis in these germ cells in vivo.","Sur, J H; Doster, A R; Christian, J S; Galeota, J A; Wills, R W; Zimmerman, J J; Osorio, F A",Journal of virology,462,27

NMRI mice were infected intravenously with a non-lethal dose of 5 x 10(6) colony forming units of N. otitidiscaviarum (GAM-5). Fourteen days after bacterial infection, most of the 60 mice injected exhibited parkinsonian features characterized by vertical head tremor, akinesia/bradykinesia, flexed posture and postural instability. There was a peak of nocardial growth in the brain during the first 24 h followed by a decrease, so that by 14 days nocardiae could no longer be cultured. At 24 h after infection, Gram staining showed nocardiae in neurons in the substantia nigra and occasionally in the brain parenchyma in the frontal and parietal cortex. At 21 days post-infection, tyrosine hydroxylase immunolabeling showed a 58% reduction of tyrosine hydroxylase in the substantia nigra, and a 35% reduction of tyrosine hydroxylase in the ventral tegmental region.

We recorded the baseline demographic profile, baseline clinical and laboratory parameters, and prevalence of various co-morbidities and their effect on the prognosis of COVID-19 cases. We conducted a prospective observational study and analyzed baseline clinical and laboratory parameters and co-morbidities and their effect on severity and mortality in 710 COVID-19 cases. Seven hundred ten patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 were recruited from the 28th of March to the 31st of August 2020. The mean age was 48.4 ± 16.4years. A total of 530 (74.6%) patients were male. Overall, the mean length of hospital stay was 12.7 days. In total, 645 patients(90.8%) were mild to moderate cases and did not require initial ICU care. Sixty-five (9.2%) cases required initial intensive care unit care. Fifty (7%) admitted patients succumbed to the illness. Diabetes mellitus and hypertension increased the risk of death in COVID-19 patients irrespective of age. Increasing age and co-morbidities adversely affect the prognosis of patients of COVID-19. Diabetes mellitus and hypertension increase the risk of death in COVID-19 patients and negate the incremental effect of age on death in these patients.","Gupta, Anirban; Nayan, Neelabh; Nair, Ranjith; Kumar, Krishna; Joshi, Aditya; Sharma, Shivangi; Singh, Jasdeep; Kapoor, Rajan",SN Compr Clin Med,462,24

The tested unit, the Molekule Air Mini, incorporates a MERV 16 filter as well as a photoelectrochemical oxidating layer. It was found to have a collection efficiency above 95.8% for all tested particle diameters and flow rates, with collection efficiencies above 99% for supermicrometer particles with the minimum collection efficiency for particles smaller than 100 nm. For all three tested viruses, the physical tracer-based log reduction was near 2.0 (99% removal). Conversely, the viable virus log reductions were found to be near 4.0 for IAV, 3.0 for BCoV, and 2.5 for PRCV, suggesting additional inactivation in a virus family- and genus-specific manner.

The essence of the situation in education during the COVID-19 pandemic in the world is quite complex: due to the large number of restrictions in some countries, education is conducted completely remotely or hybrid. In the period of 2020, medical university students were forced to practice in hospitals in the context of the pandemic, helping local medical staff, which helped to fill the shortage of specialists. The quality of education will inexorably fall due to low involvement in remote education as well as many distractions which have already proven many researchers. Universities were not ready for mass digitalization due to government restrictions and social distancing, so the quality of material transfer cannot match the classical education. The purpose of the study is to examine the impact of the pandemic COVID-19 on the medical education market and its stakeholders. Results. Universities were not ready for the transition to online (distance) education, as evidenced by the decline in the quality of education, based on surveys of the faculty of some universities. As a result, on the one hand, you can get higher education online while in your country, on the other hand, the quality of education falls without an adequately commensurate practical part (for example, medical education cannot be of high quality when it is taught online). Over time, only the year 2025 is expected to surge technologies to improve online education and the full transfer of many universities to provide distance learning;it is a good chance to get an education to those who previously could not obtain it, including for economic reasons. Conclusion. The global COVID-19 pandemic has become a catalyst for global processes of digital transformation in all spheres of life. In such circumstances, the role of digital technologies in education has become extremely important. Among the many technological advantages, their ability to protect human lives and at the same time ensure the implementation of the educational process remained almost unnoticed. Current situation has accelerated the mass transition to the use of digital technologies, including digitalization of education, its technologization and standardization. © Institute of Society Transformation, 2020","Kolomiets, O.; Litvinova, T.",Economic Annals-XXI,462,22

We investigated the possibility that SARS-CoV-2 RNAs can be reverse-transcribed and integrated into the DNA of human cells in culture and that transcription of the integrated sequences might account for some of the positive PCR tests seen in patients. In support of this hypothesis, we found that DNA copies of SARS-CoV-2 sequences can be integrated into the genome of infected human cells. We found target site duplications flanking the viral sequences and consensus LINE1 endonuclease recognition sequences at the integration sites, consistent with a LINE1 retrotransposon-mediated, target-primed reverse transcription and retroposition mechanism. We also found, in some patient-derived tissues, evidence suggesting that a large fraction of the viral sequences is transcribed from integrated DNA copies of viral sequences, generating viral-host chimeric transcripts. The integration and transcription of viral sequences may thus contribute to the detection of viral RNA by PCR in patients after infection and clinical recovery. Because we have detected only subgenomic sequences derived mainly from the 3' end of the viral genome integrated into the DNA of the host cell, infectious virus cannot be produced from the integrated subgenomic SARS-CoV-2 sequences.","Zhang, Liguo; Richards, Alexsia; Barrasa, M Inmaculada; Hughes, Stephen H; Young, Richard A; Jaenisch, Rudolf",Proc.

The outbreak will cause bad emotions such as tension, anxiety, fear, and so on. College students who have returned home from school face infection, isolation, and delay in starting school, and thus, their emotional stress should be observed. METHODS: This study used self-designed questionnaires and artificial intelligence (AI) to assess and analyze the emotional state of over 30,000 college students during the outbreak period in January (T1) and home quarantine in February (T2). This survey used online questionnaire (www.wjx.cn) to investigate the emotion information of college students. RESULTS: In the T1 survey, the ""Typhoon Eye Effect"" appeared. College students in Hubei are calmer than those outside Hubei in T1. However, in T2, an emotional ""infection point"" appeared, there was an ""Exposure Effect"", the negative emotions of students in Hubei largely increased and became higher than students outside Hubei. CONCLUSION: This survey found that there is an emotional ""infection point"" in February among college students, especially in the Hubei area. College students in Hubei are calmer than those outside Hubei in T1. In contrast, college students in Hubei were more nervous and scared than those outside Hubei in T2. This epidemic has caused the students to experience significant pressure and negative emotions. Therefore, universities and society should pay attention to their emotional adjustment, there are some suggestions such as establish the mental health organizations, test students' emotion status regularly.","Zhang, Yan; Cao, Xiaochen; Wang, Pu; Wang, Guixiang; Lei, Guanghui; Shou, Zhexing; Xie, Simiao; Huang, Fei; Luo, Na; Luo, Mingyan; Bian, Yueran; Zhang, Jingyuan; Xiao, Qiang",J Affect Disord,462,22

They exercise an undue influence over police today in ways that are not widely acknowledged and increasingly play a role in the data capture and processing that feeds into larger cloud infrastructures and data markets. These developments are having profound effects on how policing is organized and on existing power relations, whereby decisions are increasingly being made by algorithms. Although attention is paid to algorithmic police surveillance in academic research as well as in mainstream media, critical discussions about its democratic oversight are rare.

The efficacy and reliability of these assays are of paramount importance in both tracking and controlling the spread of the virus. Real-time reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) assays rely on a fixed genetic sequence for primer and probe binding. Mutations can potentially alter the accuracy of these assays and lead to unpredictable analytical performance characteristics and false-negative results. Here, we identify a G-to-U transversion (nucleotide 26372) in the SARS-CoV-2 E gene in three specimens with reduced viral detection efficiency using a widely available commercial assay. Further analysis of the public GISAID repository led to the identification of 18 additional genomes with this mutation, which reflect five independent mutational events.

It learns geometric texture statistics from local neighborhoods (i.e., local triangular patches) of a single reference 3D model. It learns deep features on the faces of the input triangulation, which is used to subdivide and generate offsets across multiple scales, without parameterization of the reference or target mesh. Our network displaces mesh vertices in any direction (i.e., in the normal and tangential direction), enabling synthesis of geometric textures, which cannot be expressed by a simple 2D displacement map. Learning and synthesizing on local geometric patches enables a genus-oblivious framework, facilitating texture transfer between shapes of different genus.","Hertz, Amir; Hanocka, Rana; Giryes, Raja; Cohen-Or, Daniel",,462,26

Following the arrival of the COVID-19 pandemic, the survey acquired a new goal: how do the subjects of the follow-up sampling experience this severe stress situation, and in this experience, what role does physical activity and a salutogenetic sense of coherence play. Austrian women (N = 53) took part in the training program, whose physical condition was assessed before the start of the program, then reassessed after three months and after six months; the organizers also had them fill out the sense of coherence questionnaire (SOC) as well as the Regensburger insomnia scale. After the lifting of the lockdown introduced due to the pandemic, participants completed an online survey relating to their changed life conditions, physical activities, sense of coherence and sleep quality. Results: After the first three months of the training, no significant changes were detected. After six months, the participants SOC and sleep quality improved (Friedman test: p = 0.005 and p < 0.001). During the lockdown, sleep quality generally deteriorated (W-rank test: p = 0.001), while SOC did not change. The women in possession of a relatively stronger SOC continued the training (OR = 3.6, CI 95% = 1.2-12.2), and their sleep quality deteriorated to a lesser degree. (OR = 1.7, CI 95% = 1.1-2.8). Conclusion: The data reinforce the interdependency between physical exercise (PE) and SOC; furthermore, the personal training that the authors formulated for middle-aged women proved to be successful in strengthening their sense of coherence, and it also reduced the deterioration in sleep quality due to stress.","Szovák, Etelka; Varga, Károly; Pelyva, Imre Zoltán; Soós, Rita; Jeges, Sára; Kívés, Zsuzsanna; Tóth, Ákos Levente",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),462,10

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty-one patients with COVID-19 pneumonia including ordinary cases (group A, n = 12), severe cases (group B, n = 15), and critical cases (group C, n = 24) were retrospectively enrolled. The qualitative and quantitative indicators from chest CT were recorded and compared using Fisher exact test, one-way analysis of variance, Kruskal-Wallis H test, and receiver operating characteristic analysis. RESULTS: Depending on the severity of the disease, the number of involved lung segments and lobes, the frequencies of consolidation, crazy-paving pattern, and air bronchogram increased in more severe cases. Qualitative indicators including total severity score for the whole lung and total score for crazy-paving and consolidation could distinguish groups B and C from A (69% sensitivity, 83% specificity, and 73% accuracy) but were similar between group B and group C. Combined qualitative and quantitative indicators could distinguish these 3 groups with high sensitivity (B + C vs A, 90%; C vs B, 92%), specificity (100%, 87%), and accuracy (92%, 90%). Critical cases had higher total severity score (>10) and higher total score for crazy-paving and consolidation (>4) than ordinary cases, and had higher mean lung density (>-779 HU) and full width at half maximum (>128 HU) but lower relative volume of normal lung density (â¦50%) than ordinary/severe cases. In our critical cases, 8 patients with relative volume of normal lung density smaller than 40% received mechanical ventilation for supportive treatment, and 2 of them had died. CONCLUSIONS: A rapid, accurate severity assessment of COVID-19 pneumonia based on chest CT would be feasible and could provide help for making management decisions, especially for the critical cases.","Lyu, Peijie; Liu, Xing; Zhang, Rui; Shi, Lei; Gao, Jianbo",Invest Radiol,462,1

In very different ways, the immune and taste systems both fulfill this function, with growing evidence suggesting a relationship between the two, through shared signaling pathways, receptors, and feedback loops. The purpose of this review was to explore recent reports on taste and immunity in model animals and in humans to explore our understanding of the interplay between these systems. RECENT FINDINGS: Acute infections in the upper airway, as with SARS-CoV-2, are associated with a proinflammatory state, and blunted taste perception. Further, recent findings highlight taste receptors working as immune sentinels throughout the body. Work in humans and mice also points to inflammation from obesity impacting taste, altering taste bud abundance and composition. There is accumulating evidence that taste cells, and particularly their receptors, play a role in airway and gut immunity, responsive to invading organisms. Inflammation itself may further act on taste buds and other taste receptor expressing cells throughout the body as a form of homeostatic control.","Goodman, Jason R; Dando, Robin",Curr Nutr Rep,462,20

The COVID-19 pandemic, which was initially considered as a Chinese-centric problem, has now affected more than 200 countries worldwide. The impact of the virus on human sufferings is unaccountable. However, economists consider the repercussion of the outbreak as contagious economically as it has been medically. Throughout this paper, we mainly address a few important research questions about the economic aspects of COVID-19. We further highlight three critical channels through which the economic effect of the outbreak can be assessed. Finally, we explain the case of Middle East states and demonstrate the pathways that explain the economic repercussion of this global pandemic on the region.

Prior to the pandemic, adoption of telehealth by health care providers was hampered by outdated legislative and regulatory barriers at the federal and state levels. This paper provides a review of the legislative and regulatory landscape for telehealth in the United States and how it has changed during the COVID-10 PHE. It remains to be seen whether the temporary flexibilities surrounding delivery and payment of telehealth services will remain in place; some require Congressional action to make permanent while others can be made permanent through rulemaking. Other actions are dependent on state legislatures and commercial payers. Issues under debate by stakeholders include long-term audio-only coverage; broadband connectivity; disparities in access to telehealth; appropriate payment for telehealth versus in-person care; concerns about fraud, quality, and safety; and the need for additional data to inform future policymaking. Insights are provided into these key issues that are expected to shape future legislative and regulatory action at the federal and state levels. Health care providers and patients need to engage in advocacy work at the federal and state level, and with commercial payers, to affect meaningful long-term change.","Schofield, Marsha",Nutr Clin Pract,462,2

First, in the absence of explicit guidance for responding to cases in which there is significant uncertainty or disagreement about the relative therapeutic, prophylactic or diagnostic merits of available interventions they perpetuate self-defeating practices. Second, without addressing the role of advertising in shaping patient and community preferences they risk creating moral loopholes that bypass and undermine professional duties of fidelity, honesty and transparency. In both cases, these flaws are exacerbated by an individualism that ignores the critical role of health systems in managing and reducing uncertainty and conflict over best practices, and in communicating with and shaping the expectations of the public.

Digital platforms are a technology-enabled business model that facilitates exchanges between interacting agents. They represent a bridging link among disconnected nodes, improving the scalable value of networks. Application to healthcare public-private partnerships (PPPs) is significant due to the consistency of digital platforms with health issues and the complexity of the stakeholder's interaction. In infrastructural PPPs, public and private players cooperate, usually following PF patterns. This relationship is complemented by digitized supply chains and is increasingly patient-centric. This paper reviews the literature, analyzes some supply chain bottlenecks, addresses solutions concerning the networking effects of platforms to improve PPP interactions, and investigates the cost-benefit analysis of digital health with an empirical case. Whereas diagnostic or infrastructural technology is an expensive investment with long-term payback, leapfrogging digital applications reduce contingent costs. ""Digital"" savings can be shared by key stakeholders with P4P schemes, incentivizing value co-creation patterns. Efficient sharing may apply network theory to a comprehensive PPP ecosystem where stakeholding nodes are digitally connected. This innovative approach improves stakeholder relationships, which are re-engineered around digital platforms that enhance patient-centered satisfaction and sustainability. Digital technologies are useful even for infectious disease surveillance, like that of the coronavirus pandemic, for supporting massive healthcare intervention, decongesting hospitals, and providing timely big data.","Moro Visconti, Roberto; Morea, Donato",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),462,1

Under the auspices of the Canadian Association of Medical Oncologists, we conducted an online national survey to better understand the impact of the pandemic on the medical oncology community in Canada. Methods: An English-language multiple-choice survey, including questions about demographics, covid-19 risk, use of personal protective equipment (ppe), personal challenges, and chemotherapy management was distributed to Canadian medical oncologists. The survey was open from 30 March to 4 April 2020, and attracted 159 responses. Results: More than 70% of medical oncologists expressed moderate-to-extreme concern about personally contracting covid-19 and about family members or patients (or both) contracting covid-19 from them. Despite that high level of concern, considerable variability in the use of ppe in direct cancer care was reported at the time of this survey, with 33% of respondents indicating no routine ppe use at their institutions and 69% indicating uncertainty about access to adequate ppe. Of the respondents, 54% were experiencing feelings of nervousness or anxiety on most days, and 52% were having feelings of depression or hopelessness on at least some days. Concern about aging parents or family and individual wellness represented the top personal challenges identified. The management of cancer patients has been affected, with adoption of telemedicine reported by 82% of respondents, and cessation of clinical trial accrual reported by 54%. The 3 factors deemed most important for treatment decision-making wereâ cancer prognosis and anticipated benefit from treatment,â risk of treatment toxicity during scarce health care access, andâ patient risk of contracting covid-19. Conclusions: This report describes the results of the first national survey assessing the impact of the covid-19 on Canadian medical oncologists and how they deliver systemic anticancer therapies. We hope that these data will provide a framework to address the challenges identified.","Gill, S; Hao, D; Hirte, H; Campbell, A; Colwell, B",Curr Oncol,462,30

OBJECTIVE: To assess the clinical features of Brazilian patients with SARS-CoV-2 and analyze its local epidemiological features. DESIGN AND SETTING: Observational retrospective study conducted using data from an official electronic platform for recording confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases. METHODS: We extracted data from patients based in the state of Pernambuco who were registered on the platform of the Center for Strategic Health Surveillance Information, between February 26 and May 25, 2020. Clinical signs/symptoms, case evolution over time, distribution of confirmed, recovered and fatal cases and relationship between age group and gender were assessed. RESULTS: We included 28,854 patients who were positive for SARS-CoV-2 (56.13% females), of median age 44.18 years. SARS-CoV-2 infection was most frequent among adults aged 30-39 years. Among cases that progressed to death, the most frequent age range was 70-79 years. Overall, the mortality rate in the cohort was 8.06%; recovery rate, 30.7%; and hospital admission rate (up to the end of follow-up), 17.3%.

There is limited data on whether a specific symptom or collection of symptoms may be useful to predict test positivity. METHODS: An anonymous electronic survey was publicized through social media to query participants with COVID-19 testing. Respondents were questioned regarding 10 presenting symptoms, demographic information, comorbidities, and COVID-19 test results. Stepwise logistic regression was used to identify predictors for COVID-19 positivity. Selected classifiers were assessed for prediction performance using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. RESULTS: A total of 145 participants with positive COVID-19 testing and 157 with negative results were included. Participants had a mean age of 39 years, and 214 (72%) were female. Smell or taste change, fever, and body ache were associated with COVID-19 positivity, and shortness of breath and sore throat were associated with a negative test result (p < 0.05). A model using all 5 diagnostic symptoms had the highest accuracy with a predictive ability of 82% in discriminating between COVID-19 results. To maximize sensitivity and maintain fair diagnostic accuracy, a combination of 2 symptoms, change in sense of smell or taste and fever was found to have a sensitivity of 70% and overall discrimination accuracy of 75%. CONCLUSION: Smell or taste change is a strong predictor for a COVID-19-positive test result. Using the presence of smell or taste change with fever, this parsimonious classifier correctly predicts 75% of COVID-19 test results. A larger cohort of respondents will be necessary to refine classifier performance.","Roland, Lauren T; Gurrola, Jose G; Loftus, Patricia A; Cheung, Steven W; Chang, Jolie L",Int Forum Allergy Rhinol,462,26

Thus, evaluating the effectiveness of existing vaccines like Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) has attracted attention. The aim of this review was evidence synthesis on the effect of BCG vaccine in preventing severe infectious respiratory disease including COVD-19, but not tuberculosis. We considered studies conducted on human participants of any study design from any country setting that were published in Enlgish. We did a systematic literature search in MEDLINE, Scopus and Google scholar databases and a free search on Google. The identified studies were appraised and relevant data were extracted using Joanna Briggs Institute tools. The extracted findings were synthesized with tables and narrative summary. Nine studies met the inclusion criteria. The findings indicated that BCG vaccine has a strong protective effect against both upper and lower acute respiratory tract infections. For instance in countries with universal BCG vaccination policy, the incidence of COVID-19 was lower compared to the counterparts. Addtionally, BCG vaccine was found to protect against infections like lethal influenza A virus, pandemic influenza (H1N1), and other acute respiratory tract infections. BCG improved the human body's immune response involving antigen-specific T cells and memory cells. It also induced adaptive functional reprogramming of mononuclear phagocytes that induce protective effects against different respiratory infections other than tuberculosis. In countries with universal BCG vaccination, the incidence and death from acute respiratory viral infection including COVID - 19 is significantly low. However, there is an urgent need for further evidence from well-designed studies to understand the possible role of BCG vaccination over time and across age groups, its possible benefits in special populations such as health workers and cost-savings related to a policy of universal BCG vaccination.","Yitbarek, Kiddus; Abraham, Gelila; Girma, Tsinuel; Tilahun, Tizta; Woldie, Mirkuzie",Vaccine,462,27

The purpose of this study is to assess the impact of COVID-19 on faculty teaching methods, assessment methods, and personal well-being. The study was a combination of a quantitative survey and a qualitative study using interviews of engineering faculty teaching in Spring 2020. In the first part, we surveyed all faculty teaching during Spring 2020 in the SJSU College of Engineering about their experiences after the move to 100% online instruction in March 2020. In the second part of the research, we interviewed 23 faculty members to obtain a more in-depth understanding of their experiences during the move online in Spring 2020. Overall, 98 faculty participated in the survey: lecturers (58), tenure-track (18), tenured (13), adjunct (1), and Teaching Associates (1). The faculty reported being worried about their family and their students' well-being. In addition, 65% of faculty members reported either a moderate or a great deal of stress related to the shelter in place, and this percentage was higher for female faculty (74%) and for tenure-track faculty (83%). Overall, faculty members felt that they had their classes under control most of the time and that the transition to online teaching was positive, even if they felt they had too much work to do and felt always in a hurry and under pressure. From a teaching perspective, the interviews highlight that faculty members' main concerns focus on testing and assessment and students' engagement.

The recently characterized E protein ion channel activity (EIC) has also been implicated in modulating viral pathogenesis. In this study, we used infectious bronchitis coronavirus (IBV) as a model to study EIC. Two recombinant IBVs (rIBVs) harboring EIC-inactivating mutations – rT16A and rA26F – were serially passaged, and several compensatory mutations were identified in the transmembrane domain (TMD). Two rIBVs harboring these putative EIC-reverting mutations – rT16A/A26V and rA26F/F14N – were recovered. Compared with the parental rIBV-p65 control, all four EIC mutants exhibited comparable levels of intracellular RNA synthesis, structural protein production, and virion assembly. Our results showed that the IBV EIC contributed to the induction of ER stress response, as up-regulation of ER stress-related genes was markedly reduced in cells infected with the EIC-defective mutants. EIC-defective mutants also formed smaller plaques, released significantly less infectious virions into the culture supernatant, and had lower levels of viral fitness in cell culture. Significantly, all these defective phenotypes were restored in cells infected with the putative EIC revertants. EIC mutations were also implicated in regulating IBV-induced apoptosis, induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and viral pathogenicity in vivo. Taken together, this study highlights the importance of CoV EIC in modulating virion release and various aspects of CoV – host interaction.","Li, Shumin; Yuan, Lixia; Dai, Guo; Chen, Rui Ai; Liu, Ding Xiang; Fung, To Sing",Front.

Here, we describe how a national network of acoustic tracking receivers can be leveraged to assess the effects of human activity on animal movement and space use during such global disruptions. We outline variation in restrictions on human activity across Australian states and describe four mechanisms affecting human interactions with the marine environment: (1) reduction in economy and trade changing shipping traffic;(2) changes in export markets affecting commercial fisheries;(3) alterations in recreational activities;and (4) decline in tourism. We develop a roadmap for the analysis of acoustic tracking data across various scales using Australia's national Integrated Marine Observing System (IMOS) Animal Tracking Facility as a case study. We illustrate the benefit of sustained observing systems and monitoring programs by assessing how a 51-day break in white shark (Carcharodon carcharias) cage-diving tourism due to COVID-19 restrictions affected the behaviour and space use of two resident species. This cessation of tourism activities represents the longest break since cage-diving vessels started day trips in this area in 2007. Long-term monitoring of the local environment reveals that the activity space of yellowtail kingfish (Seriola lalandi) was reduced when cage-diving boats were absent compared to periods following standard tourism operations. However, white shark residency and movements were not affected. Our roadmap is globally applicable and will assist researchers in designing studies to assess how anthropogenic activities can impact animal movement and distributions during regional, short-term through to major, unexpected disruptions like the COVID-19 pandemic.","Huveneers, C.; Jaine, F.

Unsurprisingly, deception and fraud in such platforms have also increased, but have not been thoroughly studied to understand what characteristics can expose such behavior and allow its automatic detection and blocking. Indeed, crowdfunding platforms are the only ones typically performing oversight for the campaigns launched in each service. However, they are not properly incentivized to combat fraud among users and the campaigns they launch: on the one hand, a platform's revenue is directly proportional to the number of transactions performed (since the platform charges a fixed amount per donation); on the other hand, if a platform is transparent with respect to how much fraud it has, it may discourage potential donors from participating. In this paper, we take the first step in studying fraud in crowdfunding campaigns. We analyze data collected from different crowdfunding platforms, and annotate 700 campaigns as fraud or not. We compute various textual and image-based features and study their distributions and how they associate with campaign fraud. Using these attributes, we build machine learning classifiers, and show that it is possible to automatically classify such fraudulent behavior with up to 90.14% accuracy and 96.01% AUC, only using features available from the campaign's description at the moment of publication (i.e., with no user or money activity), making our method applicable for real-time operation on a user browser.","Perez, Beatrice; Machado, Sara R.; Andrews, Jerone T.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the incidence and predictors of sustained tachyarrhythmias in hospitalized patients with COVID-19, and their potential association with disease severity and in-hospital mortality. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a retrospective multicenter observation study including consecutive patients with laboratory confirmed COVID-19 admitted to emergency department of ten Italian Hospitals from 15 February to 15 March 2020. The prevalence and the type of incident sustained arrhythmias have been collected. The correlation between the most prevalent arrhythmias and both baseline characteristics and the development of ARDS and in-hospital mortality has been evaluated. RESULTS: 414 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 (66.9 ± 15.0 years, 61.1% male) were included in the present study. During a median follow-up of 28 days (IQR: 12-45), the most frequent incident sustained arrhythmia was AF (N: 71; 17.1%), of which 50 (12.1%) were new-onset and 21 (5.1%) were recurrent, followed by VT (N: 14, 3.4%) and supraventricular arrhythmias (N: 5, 1.2%). Incident AF, both new-onset and recurrent, did not affect the risk of severe adverse events including ARDS and death during hospitalization; in contrast, incident VT significantly increased the risk of in-hospital mortality (RR: 2.55; P: .003). CONCLUSIONS: AF is the more frequent incident tachyarrhythmia; however, it not seems associated to ARDS development and death. On the other hand, incident VT is a not frequent but independent predictor of in-hospital mortality among hospitalized COVID-19 patients.","Russo, Vincenzo; Di Maio, Marco; Mottola, Filiberto Fausto; Pagnano, Gianpiero; Attena, Emilio; Verde, Nicoletta; Di Micco, Pierpaolo; Silverio, Angelo; Scudiero, Fernando; Nunziata, Luigi; Fele, Nunzia; D039,; Andrea, Antonello; Parodi, Guido; Albani, Stefano; Scacciatella, Paolo; Nigro, Gerardo; Severino, Sergio",Eur J Clin Invest,462,1

Recent studies suggested that long-term environmental exposures may be important determinants of severe COVID-19. However, very few environmental factors have been studied, often separately, without considering the totality of the external environment (i.e., the external exposome). We conducted an external exposome-wide association study (ExWAS) using the nationwide county-level COVID-19 mortality data in the contiguous US. A total of 337 variables characterizing the external exposome from 8 data sources were integrated, harmonized, and spatiotemporally linked to each county. A two-phase procedure was used: (1) in Phase 1, a random 50:50 split divided the data into a discovery set and a replication set, and associations between COVID-19 mortality and individual factors were examined using mixed-effect negative binomial regression models, with multiple comparisons addressed, and (2) in Phase 2, a multivariable regression model including all variables that are significant from both the discovery and replication sets in Phase 1 was fitted. A total of 13 and 22 variables were significant in the discovery and replication sets in Phase 1, respectively. All the 4 variables that were significant in both sets in Phase 1 remained statistically significant in Phase 2, including two air toxicants (i.e., nitrogen dioxide or NO2, and benzidine), one vacant land measure, and one food environment measure. This is the first external exposome study of COVID-19 mortality. It confirmed some of the previously reported environmental factors associated with COVID-19 mortality, but also generated unexpected predictors that may warrant more focused evaluation.","Hu, Hui; Zheng, Yi; Wen, Xiaoxiao; Smith, Sabrina S; Nizomov, Javlon; Fishe, Jennifer; Hogan, William R; Shenkman, Elizabeth A; Bian, Jiang",Sci Total Environ,462,20

Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) has in vitro activity against SARS-CoV-2, but clinical data supporting HCQ for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are limited. METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 who received &#8805;1 dose of HCQ at two New York City hospitals. We measured incident Grade 3 or 4 blood count and liver test abnormalities, ventricular arrhythmias, and vomiting and diarrhea within 10 days after HCQ initiation, and the proportion of patients who completed HCQ therapy. We also describe changes in Sequential Organ Failure Assessment hypoxia scores between baseline and day 10 after HCQ initiation and in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: None of the 153 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 who received HCQ developed a sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmia. Incident blood count and liver test abnormalities occurred in <15% of patients and incident vomiting or diarrhea was rare. Eighty-nine percent of patients completed their HCQ course and three patients discontinued therapy because of QT prolongation. Fifty-two percent of patients had improved hypoxia scores 10 days after starting HCQ. Thirty-one percent of patients who were receiving mechanical ventilation at the time of HCQ initiation died during their hospitalization, compared to 18% of patients who were receiving supplemental oxygen but not requiring mechanical ventilation, and 8% of patients who were not requiring supplemental oxygen. Co-administration of azithromycin was not associated with improved outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: HCQ appears to be reasonably safe and tolerable in most hospitalized patients with COVID-19. However, nearly one-half of patients did not improve with this treatment, highlighting the need to evaluate HCQ and alternate therapies in randomized trials.","Satlin, Michael J; Goyal, Parag; Magleby, Reed; Maldarelli, Grace A; Pham, Khanh; Kondo, Maiko; Schenck, Edward J; Rennert, Hanna; Westblade, Lars F; Choi, Justin J; Safford, Monika M; Gulick, Roy M",PLoS One,462,1

Globally understanding the humoral immunity in asymptomatic carriers will provide scientific knowledge for developing serological tests, improving early identification, and implementing more rational control strategies against the pandemic. MEASURE: Utilizing both NAT and commercial kits for serum IgM and IgG antibodies, we extensively screened 11 766 epidemiologically suspected individuals on enrollment and 63 asymptomatic individuals were detected and recruited. Sixty-three healthy individuals and 51 mild patients without any preexisting conditions were set as controls. Serum IgM and IgG profiles were further probed using a SARS-CoV-2 proteome microarray, and neutralizing antibody was detected by a pseudotyped virus neutralization assay system. The dynamics of antibodies were analyzed with exposure time or symptoms onset. RESULTS: A combination test of NAT and serological testing for IgM antibody discovered 55.5% of the total of 63 asymptomatic infections, which significantly raises the detection sensitivity when compared with the NAT alone (19%). Serum proteome microarray analysis demonstrated that asymptomatics mainly produced IgM and IgG antibodies against S1 and N proteins out of 20 proteins of SARS-CoV-2. Different from strong and persistent N-specific antibodies, S1-specific IgM responses, which evolved in asymptomatic individuals as early as the seventh day after exposure, peaked on days from 17 days to 25 days, and then disappeared in two months, might be used as an early diagnostic biomarker. 11.8% (6/51) mild patients and 38.1% (24/63) asymptomatic individuals did not produce neutralizing antibody. In particular, neutralizing antibody in asymptomatics gradually vanished in two months. CONCLUSION: Our findings might have important implications for the definition of asymptomatic COVID-19 infections, diagnosis, serological survey, public health, and immunization strategies.","Lei, Qing; Li, Yang; Hou, Hong-Yan; Wang, Feng; Ouyang, Zhu-Qing; Zhang, Yandi; Lai, Dan-Yun; Banga Ndzouboukou, Jo-Lewis; Xu, Zhao-Wei; Zhang, Bo; Chen, Hong; Xue, Jun-Biao; Lin, Xiao-Song; Zheng, Yun-Xiao; Yao, Zong-Jie; Wang, Xue-Ning; Yu, Cai-Zheng; Jiang, He-Wei; Zhang, Hai-Nan; Qi, Huan; Guo, Shu-Juan; Huang, Sheng-Hai; Sun, Zi-Yong; Tao, Sheng-Ce; Fan, Xiong-Lin",Allergy,462,22

METHODS: Fifty-six patients, who were admitted to the emergency clinic and diagnosed with COVID-19 infection, were included in the study. Data on clinical characteristics, inflammatory parameters and vitamin D status were recorded for each patient. All the participants had data on 25-hydroxyvitamin D status within the last 6 months prior to COVID-19 infection. RESULTS: The patients were stratified as those with vitamin D status less than 20 ng/mL and higher than 20 ng/mL. A group with vitamin D status less than 20 ng/mL had lower lymphocyte counts and lower haemoglobin levels that was statistically significant (respectively; p = 0.021, p = 0.035). Higher C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were seen in the vitamin D-deficient group (p = 0.013). It was observed that vitamin D status of the patients who required oxygen therapy were lower than those who did not require oxygen therapy, not statistically significant (p = 0.05). Patients who did not use vitamin D supplementation within 6 months prior to COVID-19 infection had more likely to be diagnosed with pneumonia (p = 0.004). CONCLUSION: Cases with lower vitamin D status had increased inflammatory markers and worse clinical outcomes than patients with higher vitamin D status. This study suggests that vitamin D status can be used as a prognostic factor in COVID-19 patients, and vitamin D supplementation can be recommended to improve the clinical outcomes in COVID-19 infection.","Ünsal, Y A; Gül, Ö Ö; Cander, S; Ersoy, C; Aydemir, E; Ates, C; Uzun, Z; Armagan, E; Ünsal, O; Ertürk, E",J. endocrinol. invest,462,20

Videos are especially challenging for this kind of methods, since real-time decompression requires highly efficient algorithms. Dedicated inpainting-based video codecs have so far focused on efficient frame-by-frame reconstruction without exploiting redundancies in time. As a remedy, we propose a modular framework that combines a classical prediction and correction approach with suitable structures for fully inpainting-based methods. The core idea of these techniques is to store values only at a small number of positions, and reconstruct missing regions via inpainting. Our generic framework supports any algorithm that generates such sparse representations. As a concrete demonstrator, we provide a prototypical implementation of our framework by supplementing all modules with methods based on partial differential equations (PDEs): Dense variational optic flow fields yield accurate motion-compensated predictions, while homogeneous diffusion inpainting and pseudodifferential equations are applied as intra prediction and residual compression techniques. With these components, we are able to outperform other inpainting-based video codecs in terms of quality and speed. For the first time in inpainting-based video compression, we can decompress FullHD (1080p) videos in real-time with a fully CPU-based implementation.","Andris, Sarah; Peter, Pascal; Mohideen, Rahul Mohideen Kaja; Weickert, Joachim; Hoffmann, Sebastian",,462,1

The Partial correlation coefficient (PCC) and Sobol'-Jansen methods are used for analyzing the effect and correlation of variables with the COVID-19 spreading rate. The result of sensitivity analysis shows that the population density, intra-provincial movement have a direct relationship with the infection outbreak. Conversely, areas with low values of wind speed, humidity, and solar radiation exposure to a high rate of infection that support the virus's survival. The provinces such as Tehran, Mazandaran, Alborz, Gilan, and Qom are more susceptible to infection because of high population density, intra-provincial movements and high humidity rate in comparison with Southern provinces.","Ahmadi, Mohsen; Sharifi, Abbas; Dorosti, Shadi; Jafarzadeh Ghoushchi, Saeid; Ghanbari, Negar",Sci Total Environ,462,13

However, for this to become a reality, both n-MOS and p-MOS should be realized, ideally with the same (standard) material. In the specific case of MoS2 field effect transistors (FETs), ambipolar transport is seldom reported, primarily due to the phenomenon of Fermi level pinning (FLP). In this study we identify the possible sources of FLP in MoS2 FETs and resolve them individually. A novel contact transfer technique is used to transfer contacts on top of MoS2 flake devices that results in a significant increase in the hole branch of the transfer characteristics as compared to conventionally fabricated contacts. We hypothesize that the pinning not only comes from the contact-MoS2 interface, but also from the MoS2-substrate interface. We confirm this by shifting to an hBN substrate which leads to a 10 fold increase in the hole current compared to the SiO2 substrate. Furthermore, we analyse MoS2 FETs of different channel thickness on three different substrates, SiO2, hBN and Al2O3, by correlating the p-branch I ON/I OFF to the position of oxide defect band in these substrates. FLP from the oxide is reduced in the case of Al2O3 which enables us to observe ambipolar transport in a bilayer MoS2 FET. These results highlight that MoS2 is indeed an ambipolar material, and the absence of ambipolar transport in MoS2 FETs is strongly correlated to its dielectric environment and processing conditions.","Mootheri, Vivek; Leonhardt, Alessandra; Verreck, Devin; Asselberghs, Inge; Huyghebaert, Cedric; de Gendt, Stefan; Radu, Iuliana; Lin, Dennis; Heyns, Marc",Nanotechnology,462,16

In this line, repurposing of existing drugs against known or predicted SARS-CoV-2 protein actions have been advanced, while natural products have also been tested. Here, we propose that p-cymene, a natural monoterpene, can act as a potential novel agent for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2-induced COVID-19 and other RNA-virus-induced diseases (influenza, rabies, Ebola). We show by extensive molecular simulations that SARS-CoV-2 C-terminal structured domain contains a nuclear localization signal (NLS), like SARS-CoV, on which p-cymene binds with low micromolar affinity, impairing nuclear translocation of this protein and inhibiting viral replication, as verified by preliminary in vitro experiments. A similar mechanism may occur in other RNA-viruses (influenza, rabies and Ebola), also verified in vitro for influenza, by interaction of p-cymene with viral nucleoproteins, and structural modification of their NLS site, weakening its interaction with importin A. This common mechanism of action renders therefore p-cymene as a possible antiviral, alone, or in combination with other agents, in a broad spectrum of RNA viruses, from SARS-CoV-2 to influenza A infections.","Panagiotopoulos, Athanasios; Tseliou, Melpomeni; Karakasiliotis, Ioannis; Kotzampasi, Danai-Maria; Daskalakis, Vangelis; Kesesidis, Nikolaos; Notas, George; Lionis, Christos; Kampa, Marilena; Pirintsos, Stergios; Sourvinos, George; Castanas, Elias",Pharmacol Res Perspect,462,10

Despite growing knowledge of the nature of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), treatment options are still poorly defined. The safety of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), specifically ibuprofen, has been openly questioned without any supporting evidence or clarity over dose, duration, or temporality of administration. This has been further conflicted by the initiation of studies to assess the efficacy of ibuprofen in improving outcomes in severe COVID-19 patients. To clarify the scientific reality, a literature search was conducted alongside considerations of the pharmacological properties of ibuprofen in order to construct this narrative review. The literature suggests that double-blind, placebo-controlled study results must be reported and carefully analysed for safety and efficacy in patients with COVID-19 before any recommendations can be made regarding the use of ibuprofen in such patients. Limited studies have suggested: (i) no direct interactions between ibuprofen and SARS-CoV-2 and (ii) there is no evidence to suggest ibuprofen affects the regulation of angiotensin-converting-enzyme 2 (ACE2), the receptor for COVID-19, in human studies. Furthermore, in vitro studies suggest ibuprofen may facilitate cleavage of ACE2 from the membrane, preventing membrane-dependent viral entry into the cell, the clinical significance of which is uncertain. Additionally, in vitro evidence suggests that inhibition of the transcription factor nuclear factor-&#954;B (NF-kB) by ibuprofen may have a role in reducing excess inflammation or cytokine release in COVID-19 patients. Finally, there is no evidence that ibuprofen will aggravate or increase the chance of infection of COVID-19.","Smart, Lucinda; Fawkes, Neil; Goggin, Paul; Pennick, Graham; Rainsford, K D; Charlesworth, Bruce; Shah, Neil",Inflammopharmacology,462,10

However, studies regarding the risk factors associated with prolonged shedding of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the impact of lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) treatment on viral shedding remain scarce. METHODS: Data were collected from all SARS-CoV-2 infected patients who were admitted to isolation wards and had reverse transcription PCR conversion at the No. 3 People's Hospital of Hubei province, China, between 31 January and 9 March 2020. We compared clinical characteristics and SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding between patients initiated with LPV/r treatment and those without. Logistic regression analysis was employed to evaluate the risk factors associated with prolonged viral shedding. RESULTS: Of 120 patients, the median age was 52â years, 54 (45%) were male and 78 (65%) received LPV/r treatment. The median duration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection from symptom onset was 23â days (interquartile range 18-32â days). Older age (OR 1.03, 95% CI 1.00-1.05; p=0.03) and the lack of LPV/r treatment (OR 2.42, 95% CI 1.10-5.36; p=0.029) were independent risk factors for prolonged SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding. Patients who initiated LPV/r treatment within 10â days from symptom onset, but not initiated from day 11 onwards, had significantly shorter viral shedding duration compared with those without LPV/r treatment (median 19â days versus 28.5â days; log-rank p<0.001). CONCLUSION: Older age and the lack of LPV/r treatment were independently associated with prolonged SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

Emergency regulatory changes allow buprenorphine initiation without an in-person visit. We describe the use of videoconferencing for buprenorphine initiation combined with street outreach to engage 2 patients experiencing homelessness with severe opioid use disorder (OUD). CASE PRESENTATION: Patient 1 was a 30-year-old man with severe OUD who had relapsed to injection heroin/fentanyl after incarceration. A community drop-in center outreach harm reduction specialist facilitated a videoconference with an addiction specialist at an OUD bridge clinic. The patient completed a community buprenorphine/naloxone initiation and self-titrated to his prior dose, 8/2âmg twice daily. One week later, he reconnected with the outreach team for a follow-up videoconference visit. Patient 2, a 36-year-old man with severe OUD, connected to the addiction specialist via a syringe service program harm reduction specialist. He had been trying to connect to a community buprenorphine/naloxone provider, but access was limited due to COVID-19, so he was using diverted buprenorphine/naloxone to reduce opioid use. He was restarted on his previous dose of 12/3âmg daily which was continued via phone follow-up 16 days later. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19-related regulatory changes allow buprenorphine initiation via telemedicine.

The current study was designed to evaluate the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection based on both nucleic acid testing (NAT) and antibody testing in Chinese patients receiving MHD. STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: From December 1, 2019, to March 31, 2020, a total of 1,027 MHD patients in 5 large hemodialysis centers in Wuhan, China, were enrolled. Patients were screened for SARS-CoV-2 infection by symptoms and initial computed tomography (CT) of the chest. If patients developed symptoms after the initial screening was negative, repeat CT was performed. Patients suspected of being infected with SARS-CoV-2 were tested with 2 consecutive throat swabs for viral RNA. In mid-March 2020, antibody testing for SARS-CoV-2 was obtained for all MHD patients. EXPOSURE: NAT and antibody testing results for SARS-CoV-2. OUTCOMES: Morbidity, clinical features, and laboratory and radiologic findings. ANALYTICAL APPROACH: Differences between groups were examined using t test or Mann-Whitney U test, comparing those not infected with those infected and comparing those with infection detected using NAT with those with infection detected by positive serology test results. RESULTS: Among 1,027 patients receiving MHD, 99 were identified as having SARS-CoV-2 infection, for a prevalence of 9.6%. Among the 99 cases, 52 (53%) were initially diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection by positive NAT; 47 (47%) were identified later by positive immunoglobulin G (IgG) or IgM antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. There was a spectrum of antibody profiles in these 47 patients: IgM antibodies in 5 (11%), IgG antibodies in 35 (74%), and both IgM and IgG antibodies in 7 (15%). Of the 99 cases, 51% were asymptomatic during the epidemic; 61% had ground-glass or patchy opacities on CT of the chest compared with 11.6% among uninfected patients (P<0.001). Patients with hypertensive kidney disease were more often found to have SARS-CoV-2 infection and were more likely to be symptomatic than patients with another primary cause of kidney failure. LIMITATIONS: Possible false-positive and false-negative results for both NAT and antibody testing; possible lack of generalizability to other dialysis populations.

This article will describe and discuss a new ethical dilemma faced by clinicians in the out-of-hospital environment during this time, namely the delivery of bad news to family members who are required to remain at home and self-isolate while the critically unwell patient is transported to hospital. I will discuss some failings of current practice and reflect on some of the ethical and practical challenges confronting paramedics in these circumstances. I conclude by making three recommendations: first, that dedicated pastoral outreach teams ought to be set up during pandemics to assist family members of patients transported to hospital; second, I offer a framework for how bad news can be delivered during a lockdown in a less damaging way; and finally, that a new model of bad news delivery more suited for unplanned, time-pressured care should be developed.","Campbell, Iain",J. med. ethics,462,21

However, the amount of hip fractures has remained relatively stable throughout the period. The objective of this study is to investigate the impact of perioperative COVID-19 infections on mortality among hip fracture patients. METHODS: A meta-analysis was performed by collecting current data available through a systematic literature search in the PubMed database. The search was performed Oct 18 2020. RESULTS: The meta-analysis was conducted on a trial population consisting of 1.272 hip fracture patients with a pooled prevalence of COVID-19 of 18%. Mortality among hip fracture patients without a perioperative COVID-19 infection was 7.49%. Mortality among hip fracture patients infected with COVID-19 perioperatively was associated with an odds ratio of 6.70 [(95% CI 4.64-9.68), p < 0.00001, I2 = 41%]. A sensitivity analysis showed no major impact of assumptions regarding varying definitions of COVID-19 statuses among the included studies. CONCLUSION: Perioperative infections with COVID-19 in hip fracture patients are correlated with a significantly increased mortality.

Classical compartmental models must be modified and studied to correctly describe the effects of forced external actions to reduce the impact of the disease. The importance of social structure, such as the age dependence that proved essential in the recent COVID-19 pandemic, must be considered, and in addition, the available data are often incomplete and heterogeneous, so a high degree of uncertainty must be incorporated into the model from the beginning. In this work we address these aspects, through an optimal control formulation of a socially structured epidemic model in presence of uncertain data. After the introduction of the optimal control problem, we formulate an instantaneous approximation of the control that allows us to derive new feedback controlled compartmental models capable of describing the epidemic peak reduction. The need for long-term interventions shows that alternative actions based on the social structure of the system can be as effective as the more expensive global strategy. The timing and intensity of interventions, however, is particularly relevant in the case of uncertain parameters on the actual number of infected people.

We sought to expand the catalogue of dystonia-predominant phenotypes in monogenic DEEs, building on the recently introduced concept of an epilepsy-movement disorder spectrum. METHODS: Cases were identified from a whole-exome-sequenced cohort of 45 pediatric index patients with complex dystonia (67% sequenced as parent-child trios). Review of molecular findings in DEE-associated genes was performed. For five individuals with identified DEE-causing variants, detailed information about presenting phenotypic features and the natural history of disease was obtained. RESULTS: De-novo pathogenic and likely pathogenic missense variants in GABRA1, GABBR2, GNAO1, and FOXG1 gave rise to infantile-onset persistent and paroxysmal dystonic manifestations, beginning in the limb or truncal musculature and progressing gradually to a generalized state. Coexisting, less prominent movement-disorder symptoms were observed and included myoclonic, ballistic, and stereotypic abnormal movements as well as choreoathetosis. Dystonia dominated over epileptic neurodevelopmental comorbidities in all four subjects and represented the primary indication for molecular genetic analysis. We also report the unusual case of an adult female patient with dystonia, tremor, and mild learning disability who was found to harbor a pathogenic frameshift variant in MECP2. CONCLUSIONS: Dystonia can be a leading clinical manifestation in different DEEs. A monogenic basis of disease should be considered on the association of dystonia and developmental delay-epilepsy presentations, justifying a molecular screening for variants in DEE-associated genes.","Dzinovic, Ivana; Skorvánek, Matej; Necpál, Ján; Boesch, Sylvia; Svantnerová, Jana; Wagner, Matias; Havránková, Petra; Pavelekova, Petra; Han, Vladimír; Janzarik, Wibke G; Berweck, Steffen; Diebold, Isabel; Kuster, Alice; Jech, Robert; Winkelmann, Juliane; Zech, Michael",Parkinsonism Relat Disord,462,16

However, the epidemic could rebound when such measures are relaxed, possibly leading to a requirement for a second or more, repeated lockdowns2. Here, we present results of a stochastic agent-based microsimulation model of the COVID-19 epidemic in France. We examined the potential impact of post-lockdown measures, including physical distancing, mask-wearing and shielding individuals who are the most vulnerable to severe COVID-19 infection, on cumulative disease incidence and mortality, and on intensive care unit (ICU)-bed occupancy. While lockdown is effective in containing the viral spread, once lifted, regardless of duration, it would be unlikely to prevent a rebound. Both physical distancing and mask-wearing, although effective in slowing the epidemic and in reducing mortality, would also be ineffective in ultimately preventing ICUs from becoming overwhelmed and a subsequent second lockdown. However, these measures coupled with the shielding of vulnerable people would be associated with better outcomes, including lower mortality and maintaining an adequate ICU capacity to prevent a second lockdown. Benefits would nonetheless be markedly reduced if most people do not adhere to these measures, or if they are not maintained for a sufficiently long period.","Hoertel, Nicolas; Blachier, Martin; Blanco, Carlos; Olfson, Mark; Massetti, Marc; Rico, Marina Sánchez; Limosin, Frédéric; Leleu, Henri",Nat Med,462,16

Previous studies have pointed out that disruption of the proteolytic cleavage of proteins can promote infectious and non-infectious diseases. The last few weeks have been marked by an important revelation concerning the pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2. This new coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a highly contagious and transmissible acute respiratory infectious disorder. SARS-CoV-2 is composed of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and structural proteins including Spike protein (S protein). Interestingly, the FURIN, one of the proproteins of the convertase family, plays a crucial role in the maturation of viral glycoproteins. In addition, many viruses including coronaviruses, exploit FURIN for the activation of their glycoproteins. Recent data indicate that SARS-CoV-2 enters human cells by binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2. Subsequently, the S protein is cleaved by transmembrane protease serine 2 with the help of FURIN which facilitates the entry of the virus into the cell after binding. Furthermore, it seems that FURIN is implicated in the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 and potentially in the increased rates of human-to-human transmission.","Drak Alsibai, Kinan",Med Hypotheses,462,16

We examined volumetric changes in 50 participants who underwent MRI scans before and after the COVID-19 outbreak and lockdown in Israel. Their scans were compared with those of 50 control participants who were scanned twice prior to the pandemic. Following COVID-19 outbreak and lockdown, the test group participants uniquely showed volumetric increases in bilateral amygdalae, putamen, and the anterior temporal cortices. Changes in the amygdalae diminished as time elapsed from lockdown relief, suggesting that the intense experience associated with the pandemic induced transient volumetric changes in brain regions commonly associated with stress and anxiety.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a prospective study of 535 diabetes patients who underwent metabolic surgery (n=112) and medical treatment (n=423). Changes in the target BP from baseline to every follow-up were analysed. RESULTS: Metabolic surgery decreased both office systolic and diastolic BP (DBP) and also significantly reduced ambulatory systolic BP(SBP) (132±2 vs 119±1 mmHg, p<0.0001), but not DBP (78 ±1 vs 76±1mmHg, p=0.177).The proportion of patients who maintained their SBP at <120 mmHg after 2 years (50% vs 1.9%, p<0.0001). Moreover, the rate of achieving the target SBP of 130 and 140 mmHg was also significantly higher in the surgery group, and this started from the initial 6months after commencing treatment to the end of follow-up. The dosage (DDD: 1.44±0.65 vs 0.32±0.05, p<0.001) of antihypertensive medication was significantly decreased in after metabolic surgery.

CONCLUSIONS: Metabolic surgery can effectively achieve the BP target and reduce the usage of antihypertensive medications as well as improve multiple metabolic dysfunction in T2DM patients with hypertension. This study provides an alternative approach to antagonize the metabolic related hypertension. This article is protected by copyright.

Transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) is regarded as one of the main proteases implicated in the coronavirus S protein priming, an important step for binding of the S protein to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor before cell entry. Methods: We developed a cell-based assay to identify TMPRSS2 inhibitors. Inhibitory activity was established in SARS-CoV-2 viral load systems. Results: We identified the human extracellular serine protease inhibitor (serpin) alpha 1 anti-trypsin (A1AT) as a novel TMPRSS2 inhibitor. Structural modeling revealed that A1AT docked to an extracellular domain of TMPRSS2 in a conformation that is suitable for catalysis, resembling similar serine protease inhibitor complexes. Inhibitory activity of A1AT was established in a SARS-CoV-2 viral load system. Notably, plasma A1AT levels were associated with COVID-19 disease severity. Conclusions: Our data support the key role of extracellular serine proteases in SARS CoV-2 infections and indicate that treatment with serpins, particularly the FDA-approved drug A1AT, may be effective in limiting SARS-CoV-2 dissemination by affecting the surface of the host cells.","Azouz, N.

It is an oleaginous plant whose seeds have been used mainly in biodiesel production. Plant seed oil can be extracted mechanically or using solvents, generating castor bean cake and castor bean meal as by-products, respectively. Accidental ingestion of these by-products can cause poisoning in animals and humans, characterized by digestive signs resulting from the presence of a toxalbumin called ricin. Seed toxicity varies among animal species; in horses, the lethal dose of seeds is 0.1 g/kg of body weight. The literature presents plenty of studies addressing poisoning by R. communis in different animal species and in humans; however, reports are scarce and little information is available on the pathological aspects of poisoning regarding equines. Therefore, the present study aimed to describe the epidemiological, clinical and pathological aspects observed in an outbreak of accidental poisoning with castor bean cake in horses. The equines were supplemented with palm kernel (Elaeis guianeesis) cake; however, in the purchase of a new batch, there was an error in the order, and castor bean cake was requested instead. Four horses that received castor bean cake presented clinical signs indicative of colic, which started about 21 hours after administration. Three of these horses died, with clinical evolution from 2 to 4.5 hours; the other animal was treated with intravenous fluid and antibiotic therapy and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and recovered after five days. In the necropsy of two of these horses, the main lesions were found in the small intestine, where mucosae with pronounced redness and covered with a thin layer of yellow fibrous material were observed. In the intestinal lumen, there was a large amount of bloody liquid. The stomach was full, and dark lumps similar to crushed castor bean seeds were observed in the contents. The adrenal glands of both horses presented congestion and hemorrhage in the cortex. In microscopy, the main lesion was an acute, diffuse and accentuated fibrin-necrotic enteropathy affecting the jejunum. The diagnosis of castor bean cake poisoning was based on the circumstantial evidence of by-product consumption supported by clinical and pathological aspects. The results indicate that castor bean cake commercially available as fertilizer is extremely toxic when ingested, and there is a need for appropriate detoxification or labeling informing of its toxicity.(AU)","Montão, Daniele P; Araújo, Bruna T.

We conducted this study to show the different spectral frequency and time domain parameters of HRV as a prospective predictor for critically ill patients, and in particular for COVID-19 patients who are on mechanical ventilation. The hypothesis is that most severely ill COVID-19 patients have a depletion of the sympathetic nervous system and a predominance of parasympathetic activity reflecting the remaining compensatory anti-inflammatory response. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A single-center, prospective, observational pilot study which included COVID-19 patients admitted to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit was conducted. The normalized high-frequency component (HFnu), i.e. ANIm, and the standard deviation of RR intervals (SDNN), i.e. Energy, were recorded using the analgesia nociception index monitor (ANI). To estimate the severity and mortality we used the SOFA score and the date of discharge or date of death. RESULTS: A total of fourteen patients were finally included in the study. ANIm were higher in the non-survivor group (p = 0.003) and were correlated with higher IL-6 levels (p = 0.020). Energy was inversely correlated with SOFA (p = 0.039) and fewer survival days (p = 0.046). A limit value at 80 of ANIm, predicted mortalities with a sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 85.7%. In the case of Energy, a limit value of 0.41 ms predicted mortality with all predictive values of 71.4%. CONCLUSION: A low autonomic nervous system activity, i.e. low SDNN or Energy, and a predominance of the parasympathetic system, i.e. low HFnu or ANIm, due to the sympathetic depletion in COVID-19 patients are associated with a worse prognosis, higher mortality, and higher IL-6 levels.","Aragón-Benedí, Cristian; Oliver-Forniés, Pablo; Galluccio, Felice; Yamak Altinpulluk, Ece; Ergonenc, Tolga; El Sayed Allam, Abdallah; Salazar, Carlos; Fajardo-Pérez, Mario",PLoS One,462,22

As SARS-CoV-2 has the potentiality of leading to life-threatening respiratory failure, its transmission routes need to be characterized. Yet, the possibility of airborne transmission is still debated. This study was performed to evaluate potential hospital indoor air viral quality in order to detect SARS-COV-2. For this purpose, an impinger method was used to monitor the SARS-COV-2 virus in the air. Thus, 33 samples were collected from 8 different hospital locations. The sampling time was between 50 and 60 min with a sampling flow rate of 28 L/min. Air samples were taken from 2 to 5 m away from the patients' beds. Temperature, relative humidity, and CO2 concentration were 28, 37, and 438 ppm, respectively. The results indicated that air samples which were 2 to 5 m away from the patients' beds were negative for the presence of the virus. According to the obtained results, it is suggested that airborne transmission may not have much effect on this pandemic. However, as the patients with SARS-CoV-2 were hospitalized in rooms with negative air pressure, the results might have been negatively affected.

(3) Results: Two hundred and sixty-four participants participated in the webinar and registered to take at least one survey. Participants reported receiving most of their COVID-19 vaccine information from their doctor, clinic, or hospital. Before the webinar, 71% of participants reported the intention to receive a COVID-19 vaccine, 24% were unsure, and 5% had no intention of receiving a vaccine. The strongest predictors of vaccine enthusiasm were (a) planning to encourage the vaccination of family, friends, co-workers, and community, and (b) physician recommendation. The chief reason for vaccine hesitancy was a fear of side effects. After the webinar, 82.5% reported the intention to receive a vaccine, 15.4% were still unsure, and 2% stated that they had no intention of receiving a vaccine.

Older age, and underlying health conditions, are associated with higher risk of death from COVID-19. This study aimed to describe the population at risk of severe COVID-19 due to underlying health conditions across the United Kingdom. METHODS: We used anonymised electronic health records from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink GOLD to estimate the point prevalence on 5 March 2019 of the at-risk population following national guidance. Prevalence for any risk condition and for each individual condition is given overall and stratified by age and region with binomial exact confidence intervals. We repeated the analysis on 5 March 2014 for full regional representation and to describe prevalence of underlying health conditions in pregnancy. We additionally described the population of cancer survivors, and assessed the value of linked secondary care records for ascertaining COVID-19 at-risk status. RESULTS: On 5 March 2019, 24.4% of the UK population were at risk due to a record of at least one underlying health condition, including 8.3% of school-aged children, 19.6% of working-aged adults, and 66.2% of individuals aged 70 years or more. 7.1% of the population had multimorbidity. The size of the at-risk population was stable over time comparing 2014 to 2019, despite increases in chronic liver disease and diabetes and decreases in chronic kidney disease and current asthma. Separately, 1.6% of the population had a new diagnosis of cancer in the past 5 y. CONCLUSIONS: The population at risk of severe COVID-19 (defined as either aged &#8805;70 years, or younger with an underlying health condition) comprises 18.5 million individuals in the UK, including a considerable proportion of school-aged and working-aged individuals. Our national estimates broadly support the use of Global Burden of Disease modelled estimates in other countries. We provide age- and region- stratified prevalence for each condition to support effective modelling of public health interventions and planning of vaccine resource allocation. The high prevalence of health conditions among older age groups suggests that age-targeted vaccination strategies may efficiently target individuals at higher risk of severe COVID-19.","Walker, Jemma L; Grint, Daniel J; Strongman, Helen; Eggo, Rosalind M; Peppa, Maria; Minassian, Caroline; Mansfield, Kathryn E; Rentsch, Christopher T; Douglas, Ian J; Mathur, Rohini; Wong, Angel Y S; Quint, Jennifer K; Andrews, Nick; Bernal, Jamie Lopez; Scott, J Anthony; Ramsay, Mary; Smeeth, Liam; McDonald, Helen I",BMC Public Health,462,21

It establishes in an explicit way the extent of an epidemic spread process in a population. The current estimation methods for the time evolution of R(t), using incidence data, rely on the generation interval distribution, g(\tau), which is usually obtained from empirical data or already known distributions from the literature. However, there are systems, especially highly heterogeneous ones, in which there is a lack of data and an adequate methodology to obtain g(\tau). In this work, we use mathematical models to bridge this gap. We present a general methodology for obtaining an explicit expression of the reproduction numbers and the generation interval distributions provided by an arbitrary compartmental model. Additionally, we present the appropriate expressions to evaluate those reproduction numbers using incidence data. To highlight the relevance of such methodology, we apply it to the spread of Covid-19 in municipalities of the state of Rio de janeiro, Brazil. Using two meta-population models, we estimate the reproduction numbers and the contributions of each municipality in the generation of cases in all others. Our results point out the importance of mathematical modelling to provide epidemiological meaning of the available data.","Jorge, D. C. P.; Oliveira, J. F.; Miranda, J. G. V.; Andrade, R. F.

In response to Hooper's book, The River (1999), the Royal Society in London held a conference to debate the origins of HIV. Examination of the quick dismissal of the OPV theory opens a space for legitimately challenging the widely held belief that the vaccine contamination question was convincingly resolved. This article interrogates the relationship between historiography and the making of scientific facts and history, suggesting that historians have been too credulous of scientists' testimony. The further result of the lack of a thorough analysis of the evidence backing the OPV hypothesis has resulted in a missed opportunity to read The River as one of the few detailed accounts of the immense social, political, technological, and interspecies infrastructure constituted by Cold War vaccine production. This biomedical infrastructure dramatically changed the geographic and interspecies mobility of viruses in ways that may be impossible to reconstruct. Yet these potential transmission routes remain crucial to acknowledge. The COVID-19 pandemic draws attention to the critical importance of studying The WetNet, a concept coined by the author to name the conceptual and material infrastructures of inter- and intraspecies fluid bonding.","Jain, S Lochlann",Med. anthropol. q,462,16

Multiple countries and cities are implementing different mitigation strategies to reduce their transmission (e.g., physical distancing, stay-at-home orders, avoiding large gatherings). Such interventions have been related to positive and negative health externalities. Currently, the selection of mitigation strategies has not been systematically considering a long-term vision for urban health equity. This review presents evidence and a framework linking COVID-19 mitigation strategies, the built environment, and transport to health determinants and outcomes. In addition, the paper provides a set of urban interventions aimed at supporting COVID-19 mitigation strategies and promoting a long-term health equity vision. RECENT FINDINGS: COVID-19 mitigation strategies, in addition to helping reduce disease transmission, have also decreased urban road transport, resulting in indirect benefits on air quality, traffic noise, and traffic incidents. On the other hand, the same mitigation strategies have had negative impacts on physical activity, mental health, home isolation, and access to transport options, among others. COVID-19 mitigation strategies are an opportunity to test and implement built environment and transport interventions aimed to maximize health equity and minimize health risks. National and local authorities should systematically integrate a long-term urban health equity vision when designing and implementing COVID-19 mitigation strategies. COVID-19 offers an opportunity to rethink the built environment and transport infrastructure with the aim to support short-term mitigation strategies and reduce long-term urban health inequities.","Rojas-Rueda, David; Morales-Zamora, Emily",Curr.

OBJECTIVE: To describe the mucocutaneous involvement in pediatric patients with COVID-19 admitted to a pediatric institution in Madrid (Spain), located in a zone reporting among the highest prevalence of COVID-19 in Europe. METHODS: A descriptive, analytical study was conducted on a series of 50 children hospitalized with COVID-19 between March 1, 2020, and November 30, 2020. RESULTS: Twenty-one patients presented with mucocutaneous symptoms: 18 patients with macular and/or papular exanthem, 17 with conjunctival hyperemia, and 9 with red cracked lips or strawberry tongue. Eighteen patients fulfilled criteria for multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children. Patients with mucocutaneous involvement tended to be older and presented to the emergency department with poor general status and extreme tachycardia, higher C-reactive protein and D-dimer levels, and lower lymphocyte counts than patients without skin signs. Mucocutaneous manifestations pose a higher risk of admission to the pediatric intensive care unit (odds ratio, 10.24; 95% confidence interval, 2.23-46.88; P = .003).

The structures reveal a binding cavity that accommodates ADPR and analogs via local structural changes within the pocket. Using a radioactive assay, we present evidence of mono-ADPR (MAR) hydrolase activity. In silico analysis presents further evidence on recognition of the ADPR modification for hydrolysis. Mutational analysis of residues within the binding pocket resulted in diminished enzymatic activity and binding affinity.

During the current COVID-19 pandemic, social distancing guidelines require alternative data collection in order to protect both research staff and participants. Home-collected respiratory specimens are less resource-intensive, can be collected earlier after symptom onset, and provide a low-contact means of data collection. A prospective, multi-year, community-based cohort study is an ideal setting to examine the utility of home-collected specimens for identification of influenza. METHODS: We describe the feasibility and reliability of home-collected specimens for the detection of influenza. We collected data and specimens between October 2014 and June 2017 from the Household Influenza Vaccine Evaluation (HIVE) Study. Cohort participants were asked to collect a nasal swab at home upon onset of acute respiratory illness. Research staff also collected nose and throat swab specimens in the study clinic within 7 days of onset. We estimated agreement using Cohen's kappa and calculated sensitivity and specificity of home-collected compared to staff-collected specimens. RESULTS: We tested 336 paired staff- and home-collected respiratory specimens for influenza by RT-PCR; 150 staff-collected specimens were positive for influenza A/H3N2, 23 for influenza A/H1N1, 14 for influenza B/Victoria, and 31 for influenza B/Yamagata. We found moderate agreement between collection methods for influenza A/H3N2 (0.70) and B/Yamagata (0.69) and high agreement for influenza A/H1N1 (0.87) and B/Victoria (0.86). Sensitivity ranged from 78% to 86% for all influenza types and subtypes.

Supply is short, with donor availability further limited by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. This study examined whether a novel, personalized, technology-based nomogram was noninferior with regard to significant hypotensive adverse events (AEs) in healthy donors. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: IMPACT (IMproving PlasmA CollecTion) was a prospective, multicenter, double-blinded, randomized, controlled trial carried out between January 6 and March 26, 2020, in three U.S plasma collection centers. Donors were randomly assigned to the current simplified 1992 nomogram (control) or a novel percent plasma nomogram (PPN) with personalized target volume calculation (experimental). Primary endpoint was the rate of significant hypotensive AEs. Noninferiority (NI) was tested with a margin of 0.15%. Collected plasma volume was a secondary endpoint. RESULTS: A total of 3443 donors (mean [SD] BMI: 32 [7.74] kg/m2 ; 65% male) underwent 23,137 donations (median [range]: 6 [1-22] per subject). Ten significant hypotensive AEs were observed (six control; four experimental), with model-based AE incidence rate estimates (95% CI) of 0.051% (0.020%-0.114%) and 0.035% (0.010%-0.094%), respectively (p = .58). NI was met at an upper limit of 0.043% versus the predefined margin of 0.15%. There was no statistical difference between total AEs (all AE types: p = .32). Mean plasma volume collected was 777.8 ml (control) versus 841.7 ml (experimental); an increase of 63.9 ml per donation (8.2%; p < .0001). CONCLUSION: This trial showed that a novel personalized nomogram approach in healthy donors allowed approximately 8% more plasma per donation to be collected without impairing donor safety.","Hartmann, Jan; Ragusa, Michael J; Burchardt, Elmar R; Manukyan, Zorayr; Popovsky, Mark A; Leitman, Susan F",Transfusion,462,24

From January 23, 2020, the number of affected individuals from this virus rapidly increased in Wuhan and other countries. This research proposes a system for classifying and analyzing the predictions obtained from symptoms of this virus. The proposed system aims to determine those attributes that help in the early detection of Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) using the Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS). This work computes the accuracy of different machine learning classifiers and selects the best classifier for COVID-19 detection based on comparative analysis. ANFIS is used to model and control ill-defined and uncertain systems to predict this globally spread disease's risk factor.

METHODS: Patients aged under 18 admitted to the pediatric emergency clinic with suspicion of COVID-19, who underwent point-of-care LUS and from whom COVID-19 reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) samples were collected, were included in the study. RESULTS: Point-of-care LUS was performed on 74 patients in the emergency room. LUS findings were more sensitive than chest X-ray in the early stages of the disease and in mild cases. Involvement was observed at LUS despite RT-PCR being negative in some symptomatic patients with a COVID-19 contact history. CONCLUSIONS: We think that LUS can be beneficial in terms of identifying patients with lung involvement and staging their severity in this new disease in pediatric emergency clinics. The procedure is noninvasive, rapid, reproducible, and low cost, involving simple sterilization. Based on the current literature and our own practical experience, we think that increased use of point-of-care LUS can protect patients from unnecessary radiation and treatment delays during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Türe, Esra; Korkmaz, Muhammet Furkan; Aksoy, Fatma Dilsad; Ceylan Demirbas, Basak; Menekse, Burcu; Çiftçi, Mehtap; Korkmaz, Merve",J. clin. ultrasound,462,0

During the pandemic of the new coronavirus infection (COVID-19), one of the most vulnerable and actively involved in the epidemic process categories of the population were medical workers. The study of the incidence of COVID-19 among medical workers, risk factors for infection and safety measures is an important area of research in modern conditions. The aim of the study is to assess the prevalence of COVID-19 among employees of medical organizations and occupational risk factors for infection in order to develop proposals for corrective measures. Materials and methods. To study the incidence of COVID-19 among employees of medical organizations, an anonymous online questionnaire developed by the authors was used, which was posted on the Google platform and distributed during the first wave of the pandemic among employees of medical organizations in several regions of the Russian Federation through corporate e-mail or specialized online resources adapted for health workers. The survey involved 1,872 medical workers of different genders, ages, positions and work experience. Results and discussion. Among the survey participants, 161 employees have already had a new coronavirus infection. In the majority (64.0%) of them, the disease occurred in the form of acute respiratory infection, in 28.6%-interstitial pneumonia, in 7.4% only the fact of isolation of the SARS-CoV-2 antigen without clinical manifestations of infection was documented. The most affected contingents were secondary and junior medical personnel, mainly hospital staff. The likelihood of infection in the workplace was increased by factors such as providing care to patients with confirmed COVID-19, participating in procedures related to aerosol generation, working with biomaterials of patients with COVID-19, contact with surfaces in the environment of a COVID-19 patient, ignorance of infectious safety issues due to lack of instruction before admission to work. When assessing the efficiency of personal protective equipment (PPE) when they are used in the process, it was found that the highest value for the prevention of infection COVID-19 had a PPE for face protection, respiratory and eye, and hand hygiene. At the same time, many employees are faced with the problem of an insufficient number of protective equipment in the workplace. When assessing the availability of SARS-CoV-2 testing to employees, it was found that only 77.4% of survey participants had the opportunity to be tested for coronavirus infection in a timely manner. Conclusion. Thus, for more effective protection of employees of medical organizations, it is necessary to have a sufficient number of personal protective equipment, especially for the face, respiratory organs and vision, the availability of hygienic hand treatment during work, regular instruction on infectious safety, using interactive forms of training, and the organization of screening examinations of previously unvaccinated and unvaccinated employees. © 2021, Numikom.

The model coefficients are calculated: the growth rate and the expected number of infected people, as well as the exponent indexes in the generalized logistic equation. It is shown that the dependence of the number of the infected people on time is well described on average by the logistic curve (within the framework of a simple or generalized logistic equation) with a determination coefficient exceeding 0.8. At the same time, the dependence of the number of the infected people per day on time has a very uneven character and can be described very roughly by the logistic curve. To describe it, it is necessary to take into account the dependence of the model coefficients on time or on the total number of cases. Variations, for example, of the growth rate can reach 60%. The variability spectra of the coefficients have characteristic peaks at periods of several days, which corresponds to the observed serial intervals. The use of the stochastic logistic equation is proposed to estimate the number of probable peaks in the coronavirus incidence.","Pelinovsky, Efim; Kurkin, Andrey; Kurkina, Oxana; Kokoulina, Maria; Epifanova, Anastasia",,462,2

PURPOSE: Based on the pharmacokinetic profile of levothyroxine, a 3-day hold guideline for adult patients ordered for intravenous (IV) levothyroxine was implemented at a tertiary academic medical center. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of the implementation of an IV levothyroxine hold guideline. METHODS: This single-center, retrospective analysis identified patients ordered for IV levothyroxine during a thirteen-week period before and after implementation of the guideline. The primary outcome was guideline adherence, defined as full implementation of the three-day hold. Secondary outcomes included the number of IV levothyroxine administrations avoided in the post-guideline group, extrapolated yearly cost avoidance (EYCA) post-guideline implementation, reasons for guideline non-adherence, and number of safety reports involving IV levothyroxine. RESULTS: A total of 166 and 134 patients met inclusion criteria for the pre and post-guideline groups, respectively. Guideline adherence was observed in 94 (70.1%) patients, resulting in 276 vials saved in the thirteen-week post-guideline period which translated to an EYCA of $139,877. Forty orders (29.9%) were non-adherent to the guideline with the most common reason stated as nil per os (NPO). No difference in safety outcomes was seen between the pre- and post-guideline groups as evidenced by one safety report in each group. CONCLUSION: We observed a high rate of adherence to an IV levothyroxine hold guideline. This was associated with a substantial cost savings over the study period with no increase in reported safety events. To our knowledge, this is the first published report of an inpatient IV levothyroxine three-day hold guideline.","Marino, Kaylee K; Crowley, Kaitlin E; Tran, Lena K; Sylvia, Daniel; Dell039,; Orfano, Heather; DeGrado, Jeremy R; Szumita, Paul M",Am. j. health system pharm,462,2

Epidemiologic trends among American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) persons are not well known. METHODS: We analyzed 2010-2014 Indian Health Service data on health care encounters to assess regional and temporal trends in IDU indicators among adults aged &#8805;18 years. IDU indicators included acute or chronic HCV infection (only among adults aged 18-35 years), arm cellulitis and abscess, OUD, and opioid-related overdose. We calculated rates per 10 000 AI/AN adults for each IDU indicator overall and stratified by sex, age group, and region and evaluated rate ratios and trends by using Poisson regression analysis. RESULTS: Rates of HCV infection among adults aged 18-35 increased 9.4% per year, and rates of OUD among all adults increased 13.3% per year from 2010 to 2014. The rate of HCV infection among young women was approximately 1.3 times that among young men. Rates of opioid-related overdose among adults aged <50 years were approximately 1.4 times the rates among adults aged &#8805;50 years. Among young adults with HCV infection, 25.6% had concurrent OUD. Among all adults with arm cellulitis and abscess, 5.6% had concurrent OUD. CONCLUSIONS: Rates of HCV infection and OUD increased significantly in the AI/AN population. Strengthened public health efforts could ensure that AI/AN communities can address increasing needs for culturally appropriate interventions, including comprehensive syringe services programs, medication-assisted treatment, and opioid-related overdose prevention and can meet the growing need for treatment of HCV infection.","Evans, Mary E; Person, Marissa; Reilley, Brigg; Leston, Jessica; Haverkate, Richard; McCollum, Jeffrey T; Apostolou, Andria; Bohm, Michele K; Van Handel, Michelle; Bixler, Danae; Mitsch, Andrew J; Haberling, Dana L; Hatcher, Sarah M; Weiser, Thomas; Elmore, Kim; Teshale, Eyasu H; Weidle, Paul J; Peters, Philip J; Buchacz, Kate",Public Health Rep,462,16

METHODS: Nine hundred ninety-two parents of children and adolescents with ADHD filled out an anonymous online survey through the ADHD family association website. The survey investigated the sleep patterns and disturbances (using a modified version of the Sleep Disturbance Scale for Children) and screen exposure time before and during the lockdown. RESULTS: During the lockdown, 59.3% of children and 69.4% of adolescents with ADHD reported a change of bedtime with significant increase of ADHD patients that went to sleep at 11pm or later. Sleep duration, in contrast, resulted in two opposing processes with more children and adolescent sleeping either less than 6 hours/night or 10-11 hours/night. Among children and adolescents, respectively, 19.9% and 22% slept less than they did before lockdown, while 21.4% and 27.4% slept more hours. Bedtime delay and decreased sleep duration were associated with an increase in the screen time exposure. Moreover, ADHD patients reported an increase in sleep disturbances when compared to previous condition, including mainly difficulties falling asleep, anxiety at bedtime, night awakenings, nightmares and daytime sleepiness. CONCLUSIONS: The lockdown impacted on sleep-wake rhythms by strengthening the maladaptive sleep patterns reported in usual life conditions in ADHD children.","Bruni, Oliviero; Giallonardo, Martina; Sacco, Roberto; Ferri, Raffaele; Melegari, Maria Grazia",J. clin. sleep med,462,1

Here, we profiled by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) IgG, IgA and IgM responses to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (full length trimer) and its receptor-binding domain (RBD) in serum and saliva of acute and convalescent patients with laboratory-diagnosed COVID-19 ranging from 3-115 days post-symptom onset (PSO), compared to negative controls. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses were readily detected in serum and saliva, with peak IgG levels attained by 16-30 days PSO. Longitudinal analysis revealed that anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgA and IgM antibodies rapidly decayed, while IgG antibodies remained relatively stable up to 105 days PSO in both biofluids. Lastly, IgG, IgM and to a lesser extent IgA responses to spike and RBD in the serum positively correlated with matched saliva samples. This study confirms that serum and saliva IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 are maintained in the majority of COVID-19 patients for at least 3 months PSO. IgG responses in saliva may serve as a surrogate measure of systemic immunity to SARS-CoV-2 based on their correlation with serum IgG responses.","Isho, Baweleta; Abe, Kento T; Zuo, Michelle; Jamal, Alainna J; Rathod, Bhavisha; Wang, Jenny H; Li, Zhijie; Chao, Gary; Rojas, Olga L; Bang, Yeo Myong; Pu, Annie; Christie-Holmes, Natasha; Gervais, Christian; Ceccarelli, Derek; Samavarchi-Tehrani, Payman; Guvenc, Furkan; Budylowski, Patrick; Li, Angel; Paterson, Aimee; Yue, Feng Yun; Marin, Lina M; Caldwell, Lauren; Wrana, Jeffrey L; Colwill, Karen; Sicheri, Frank; Mubareka, Samira; Gray-Owen, Scott D; Drews, Steven J; Siqueira, Walter L; Barrios-Rodiles, Miriam; Ostrowski, Mario; Rini, James M; Durocher, Yves; McGeer, Allison J; Gommerman, Jennifer L; Gingras, Anne-Claude",Sci. immunol,462,21

The main objective of the study was to analyze the trend and forecast the spread of COVID-19 and to develop an appropriate statistical forecast model. Methodology: Data on the daily spread between 13 March, 2020 and 31 August 2020 were collected for the development of the autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model. Stationarity testing, parameter testing and model diagnosis were performed. In addition, candidate models were obtained using autocorrelation function (ACF) and partial autocorrelation functions (PACF). Finally, the fitting, selection and prediction accuracy of the ARIMA models was evaluated using the RMSE and MAPE model selection criteria. Results: A total of 51,910 confirmed COVID-19 cases were reported from 13 March to 31 August 2020. The total recovered and death rates as of 31 August 2020 were 37.2% and 1.57%, respectively, with a high level of increase after the mid of August, 2020. In this study, ARIMA (0, 1, 5) and ARIMA (2, 1, 3) were finally confirmed as the optimal model for confirmed and recovered COVID-19 cases, respectively, based on lowest RMSE, MAPE and BIC values. The ARIMA model was also used to identify the COVID-19 trend and showed an increasing pattern on a daily basis in the number of confirmed and recovered cases. In addition, the 60-day forecast showed a steep upward trend in confirmed cases and recovered cases of COVID-19 in Ethiopia. Conclusion: Forecasts show that confirmed and recovered COVID-19 cases in Ethiopia will increase on a daily basis for the next 60 days. The findings can be used as a decision-making tool to implement health interventions and reduce the spread of COVID-19 infection.","Gebretensae, Y.

We sought to calculate the prevalence of spitting on police officers in use of force incidents, as well as the demographic and situational factors associated with spitting. METHODS: Data on spitting were compiled from more than 10,000 use of force incidents occurring at 81 agencies in eight different states in the US. RESULTS: Spitting occurred in 3.6% of cases. Female and younger subjects and those using drugs and/or alcohol are more likely to spit on officers. Spitting is more likely to occur in incidents of longer duration, when officers use less force relative to subject resistance, when subjects are assaultive or engage in self-harm, and when subjects are hobbled.

At the onset of the pandemic, Swedish upper-secondary schools moved to online instruction, while lower-secondary schools remained open. This allows for a comparison of parents and teachers differently exposed to open and closed schools, but otherwise facing similar conditions. Leveraging rich Swedish register data, we connect all students and teachers in Sweden to their families and study the impact of moving to online instruction on the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19. We find that, among parents, exposure to open rather than closed schools resulted in a small increase in PCR-confirmed infections (odds ratio [OR] 1.17; 95% CI [CI95] 1.03 to 1.32). Among lower-secondary teachers, the infection rate doubled relative to upper-secondary teachers (OR 2.01; CI95 1.52 to 2.67). This spilled over to the partners of lower-secondary teachers, who had a higher infection rate than their upper-secondary counterparts (OR 1.29; CI95 1.00 to 1.67). When analyzing COVID-19 diagnoses from healthcare visits and the incidence of severe health outcomes, results are similar for teachers, but weaker for parents and teachers' partners. The results for parents indicate that keeping lower-secondary schools open had minor consequences for the overall transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in society. The results for teachers suggest that measures to protect teachers could be considered.","Vlachos, Jonas; Hertegård, Edvin; B Svaleryd, Helena",Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A,462,16

For that reason, the exact composition of DNA sequences underlying the heterochromatic regions and the active centromeres are still unexplored for many organisms. The centromere is a crucial region of eukaryotic chromosomes responsible for the accurate segregation of genetic material. The typical landmark of centromere chromatin is the rapidly-evolving variant of the histone H3, CenH3, while DNA sequences packed in constitutive heterochromatin are associated with H3K9me3-modified histones. In the Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas we identified its centromere histone variant, Cg-CenH3, that shows stage-specific distribution in gonadal cells. In order to investigate the DNA composition of genomic regions associated with the two specific chromatin types, we employed chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput next-generation sequencing of the Cg-CenH3- and H3K9me3-associated sequences. CenH3-associated sequences were assigned to six groups of repetitive elements, while H3K9me3-associated-ones were assigned only to three. Those associated with CenH3 indicate the lack of uniformity in the chromosomal distribution of sequences building the centromeres, being also in the same time dispersed throughout the genome. The heterochromatin of C. gigas exhibited general paucity and limited chromosomal localization as predicted, with H3K9me3-associated sequences being predominantly constituted of DNA transposons.","Tunjic Cvitanic, Monika; Vojvoda Zeljko, Tanja; Pasantes, Juan J; García-Souto, Daniel; Grzan, Tena; Despot-Slade, Evelin; Plohl, Miroslav; Satovic, Eva",,462,16

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) manifests itself through a wide spectrum of symptoms that can evolve to severe presentations as pneumonia and several non-respiratory complications. Increased susceptibility to COVID-19 hospitalization and mortality have been linked to associated comorbidities as diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular diseases and, recently, to obesity. Similarly, individuals living with obesity are at greater risk to develop clinical complications and to have poor prognosis in severe influenza pneumonia. Immune and metabolic dysfunctions associated with the increased susceptibility to influenza infection are linked to obesity-associated low-grade inflammation, compromised immune and endocrine systems, and to high cardiovascular risk. These preexisting conditions may favor virological persistence, amplify immunopathological responses and worsen hemodynamic instability in severe COVID-19 as well. In this review we highlight the main factors and the current state of the art on obesity as risk factor for influenza and COVID-19 hospitalization, severe respiratory manifestations, extrapulmonary complications and even death. Finally, immunoregulatory mechanisms of severe influenza pneumonia in individuals with obesity are addressed as likely factors involved in COVID-19 pathophysiology.","Andrade, Fernanda B; Gualberto, Ana; Rezende, Camila; Percegoni, Nathércia; Gameiro, Jacy; Hottz, Eugenio D",Front Cell Infect Microbiol,462,20

Among these drugs, a second-generation antiandrogen agent, enzalutamide, was proposed because it reduces the expression of transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2), a key component mediating SARS-CoV-2-driven entry, in prostate cancer cells. However, definitive evidence for the therapeutic efficacy of enzalutamide in COVID-19 is lacking. Here, we evaluated the antiviral efficacy of enzalutamide in prostate cancer cells, lung cancer cells, human lung organoids and Ad-ACE2-transduced mice. Tmprss2 knockout significantly inhibited SARS-CoV-2 infection in vivo. Enzalutamide effectively inhibited SARS-CoV-2 infection in human prostate cells, however, such antiviral efficacy was lacking in human lung cells and organoids. Accordingly, enzalutamide showed no antiviral activity due to the AR-independent TMPRSS2 expression in mouse and human lung epithelial cells. Moreover, we observed distinct AR binding patterns between prostate cells and lung cells and a lack of direct binding of AR to TMPRSS2 regulatory locus in human lung cells. Thus, our findings do not support the postulated protective role of enzalutamide in treating COVID-19 through reducing TMPRSS2 expression in lung cells.","Li, Fei; Han, Ming; Dai, Pengfei; Xu, Wei; He, Juan; Tao, Xiaoting; Wu, Yang; Tong, Xinyuan; Xia, Xinyi; Guo, Wangxin; Zhou, Yunjiao; Li, Yunguang; Zhu, Yiqin; Zhang, Xiaoyu; Liu, Zhuang; Aji, Rebiguli; Cai, Xia; Li, Yutang; Qu, Di; Chen, Yu; Jiang, Shibo; Wang, Qiao; Ji, Hongbin; Xie, Youhua; Sun, Yihua; Lu, Lu; Gao, Dong",Nat Commun,462,30

A literature search revealed only three published cases with similar histology but none of these reports provided profound molecular and mutational analyses. Our two cases exhibited a distinct, colon-like immunophenotype with strong nuclear CDX2 and ß-catenin expression in more than 90% of the tumour cells of both components. We analysed the two carcinomas regarding microsatellite stability, RAS, BRAF and PD-L1 status. In addition, next-generation panel sequencing with Ion AmpliSeq&#8482; Cancer Hotspot Panel v2 was performed. This approach revealed mutations in FBXW7, CTNNB1 and PIK3CA in the first case and FBXW7 and RB1 mutations in the second case. We looked for similar mutational patterns in three publicly available colorectal adenocarcinoma data sets, as well as in collections of colorectal mixed neuroendocrine-non-neuroendocrine neoplasms (MiNENs) and colorectal neuroendocrine carcinomas. This approach indicated that the FBXW7 point mutation, without being accompanied by classical adenoma-carcinoma sequence mutations, such as APC, KRAS and TP53, likely occurs at a relatively high frequency in mixed neuroendocrine and squamous cell carcinoma and therefore may be characteristic for this rare tumour type. FBXW7 codifies the substrate recognition element of an ubiquitin ligase, and inactivating FBXW7 mutations lead to an exceptional accumulation of its target ß-catenin which results in overactivation of the Wnt-signalling pathway. In line with previously described hypotheses of de-differentiation of colon cells by enhanced Wnt-signalling, our data indicate a crucial role for mutant FBXW7 in the unusual morphological switch that determines these rare neoplasms. Therefore, mixed large cell neuroendocrine and a squamous cell carcinoma can be considered as a distinct carcinoma entity in the colon, defined by morphology, immunophenotype and distinct molecular genetic alteration(s).","Woischke, Christine; Jung, Peter; Jung, Andreas; Kumbrink, Jörg; Eisenlohr, Sibylle; Auernhammer, Christoph Josef; Vieth, Michael; Kirchner, Thomas; Neumann, Jens","J. pathol., Clin. res",462,16

CLINICAL HISTORY: A 28-year-old G5P1 38w1d female presented with 4 days of blurry vision, left dilated pupil, and headache. She tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 on routine nasal swab testing but denied cough or fever. Endocrine testing demonstrated an elevated serum prolactin level, and central hypothyroidism. MRI showed a cystic-solid lesion with a fluid level in the pituitary fossa and expansion of the sella consistent with pituitary apoplexy. Her visual symptoms improved with corticosteroid administration and surgery was delayed to two weeks after her initial COVID-19 infection and to allow for safe delivery of the child. A vaginal delivery under epidural anesthetic occurred at 39 weeks. Two days later, transsphenoidal resection of the mass was performed under strict COVID-19 precautions including use of Powered Air Purifying Respirators (PAPRs) and limited OR personnel given high risk of infection during endonasal procedures. Pathology demonstrated a liquefied hemorrhagic mass suggestive of pituitary apoplexy. She made a full recovery and was discharged home two days after surgery. CONCLUSION: Here we demonstrate the first known case of successful elective induction of vaginal delivery and transsphenoidal intervention in a near full term gravid patient presenting with pituitary apoplexy and acute SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Little is known about this phenomenon in older adults. The present study aimed at determining the prevalence of persistent symptoms among older COVID-19 survivors and identifying symptom patterns. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: We analyzed data collected in people 65 years and older (n = 165) who were hospitalized for COVID-19 and then admitted to the Day Hospital Post-COVID 19 of the Fondazione Policlinico Universitario ""Agostino Gemelli"" IRCCS (Rome, Italy) between April and December 2020. All patients tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 and met the World Health Organization criteria for quarantine discontinuation. MEASURES: Patients were offered multidisciplinary individualized assessments. The persistence of symptoms was evaluated on admission using a standardized questionnaire. RESULTS: The mean age was 73.1 ± 6.2 years (median 72, interquartile range 27), and 63 (38.4%) were women. The average time elapsed from hospital discharge was 76.8 ± 20.3 days (range 25-109 days). On admission, 137 (83%) patients reported at least 1 persistent symptom. Of these, more than one-third reported 1 or 2 symptoms and 46.3% had 3 or more symptoms. The rate of symptom persistence was not significantly different when patients were stratified according to median age. Compared with those with no persistent symptoms, patients with symptom persistence reported a greater number of symptoms during acute COVID-19 (5.3 ± 3.0 vs 3.3 ± 2.0; P < .001). The most common persistent symptoms were fatigue (53.1%), dyspnea (51.5%), joint pain (22.2%), and cough (16.7%). The likelihood of symptom persistence was higher in those who had experienced fatigue during acute COVID-19.

We showed that the HIDROX solution exhibits time- and concentration-dependent SARS-CoV-2-inactivating activities, and that HIDROX has more potent virucidal activity than pure HT. The evaluation of the mechanism of action suggested that both HIDROX and HT induced structural changes in SARS-CoV-2, which changed the molecular weight of the spike proteins. Even though the spike protein is highly glycosylated, this change was induced regardless of the glycosylation status. In addition, HIDROX or HT treatment disrupted the viral genome. Moreover, the HIDROX-containing cream applied on film showed time- and concentration-dependent SARS-CoV-2-inactivating activities. Thus, the HIDROX-containing cream can be applied topically as an antiviral hand cream.

We aimed to find whether the characteristics of dental care provided to children at the Department of Pediatric Dentistry at Hadassah medical center, Jerusalem, Israel, differed between the periods, before COVID-19 outbreak, during the lockdown period and during the period that followed it. Materials and Methods: We retrospectively reviewed computerized records of patients who visited the pediatric dental clinic at three different periods: pre-lockdown period, lockdown period, and post-lockdown period. Results: Nine-hundred and forty-nine children were included in the study; most of them were healthy children between 3 and 6 years old. During lockdown, all scheduled appointments except for treatments under general anesthesia and deep sedation were canceled due to the government's restrictions; the frequency of treatments with non-pharmacological behavior management, general anesthesia or deep sedation was higher than in the previous or subsequent periods and the use of inhaled/conscious sedation was significantly lower. During lockdown most of the children were diagnosed with dentoalveolar abscess (32.3%), compared to 14 and 21% at the previous or subsequent periods, respectively (P < 0.001). Treatments combination during lockdown included more extractions, pulpectomies and pulp extirpation and less permanent restorations (P < 0.001). None of the staff members was infected with COVID-19 at the clinic during these periods.

COVID-19 vaccines uptake appears to have an essential role in the successful control of the COVID-19 pandemic. ObjectiveTo examine predictors of COVID-19 vaccination uptake and reasons for decline of vaccination. MethodsWe followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis guidelines for this systematic review. We searched Medline, PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, ProQuest, CINAHL, and a pre-print service (medRxiv) from inception to July 12, 2021. We used the following key-words: vaccin*, COVID-19, and uptake. We included all types of studies (quantitative, qualitative, and mixed methods) reporting COVID-19 vaccination uptake. The review protocol was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42021267460). ResultsTwelve studies met the inclusion and exclusion criteria. COVID-19 vaccination uptake ranged from 28.6% to 98% in the general population, while among healthcare workers ranged from 33.3% to 94.5%, and among patients ranged from 36% to 80%. The main predictors of COVID-19 vaccination uptake were male gender, white race, older age, higher socioeconomic status, higher self-perceived COVID-19 vulnerability, increased information about COVID-19 vaccines, and chronic illness. The most important reasons for decline of vaccination were concerns about the safety and effectiveness of vaccines, illness, medication, pregnancy, fertility, breastfeeding, religious reasons, ethical reasons, previous COVID-19 diagnosis, self-estimation that COVID-19 is not a severe disease, and limited knowledge about the vaccines. ConclusionsSeveral factors affect COVID-19 vaccination uptake, while various reasons affect peoples decision to refuse to take a COVID-19 vaccine. These findings are essential to further enhance our understanding of COVID-19 vaccination uptake and design specific interventions. Given the high prevalence of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy, our findings have major implications for the delivery of COVID-19 vaccination programmes in the public with special attention to people who are undecided or unlikely to take a COVID-19 vaccine.","Galanis, Petros A; Vraka, Irene; Siskou, Olga; Konstantakopoulou, Olympia; Katsiroumpa, Aglaia; Kaitelidou, Daphne",,462,25

The COVID-19 pandemic is a global health crisis. To curtail the pandemic and enable a return to normalcy, rapid and widely accessible COVID-19 testing is urgently needed. Much of the current efforts to develop COVID-19 testing are devoted to tests that determine whether a person is currently infected or whether a person has previously been infected. Now, Yan et al. take a different perspective and report a blood test that can predict COVID-19 mortality. The authors analyzed 75 clinical features, including the concentrations of markers in the blood of 485 infected individuals in Wuhan, and developed a mortality prediction model using machine learning tools. Their modeling identified three blood-borne markers that together classified the mortality of individual patients more than 10 days in advance with more than 90% accuracy. One of these markers alone, the level of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in the blood, was highly indicative of COVID-19 mortality. LDH is an enzyme involved in energy production and is found in almost all cells in the body. Tests that measure the concentration of LDH in the blood are commonly used to monitor tissue damage associated with a wide range of disorders, including liver disease and interstitial lung disease. The results from Yan et al. therefore suggest that tissue damage markers can be leveraged to predict COVID-19 outcomes. The markers and model developed by the authors are important because they can possibly help to identify patients that require immediate medical attention, which will be vital to guide clinical decision making. The test could also find use as a surrogate marker to be included in clinical trials of candidate COVID-19 treatments, but additional studies will be required to assess this possibility. The results require validation in larger and independent patient cohorts and call for the development of additional host injury markers, including markers that are cell- and tissue-type specific, to help guide patient management.","De Vlaminck, Iwijn",Sci.

Of 115 sera collected &#8805;61 days after onset of illness tested using plaque reduction neutralization (PRNT) assays, 99.1% remained seropositive for both 90% (PRNT90) and 50% (PRNT50) neutralization endpoints. We estimate that it takes at least 372, 416 and 133 days for PRNT50 titres to drop to the detection limit of a titre of 1:10 for severe, mild and asymptomatic patients, respectively. At day 90 after onset of symptoms (or initial RT-PCR detection in asymptomatic infections), it took 69, 87 and 31 days for PRNT50 antibody titres to decrease by half (T1/2) in severe, mild and asymptomatic infections, respectively. Patients with severe disease had higher peak PRNT90 and PRNT50 antibody titres than patients with mild or asymptomatic infections. Age did not appear to compromise antibody responses, even after accounting for severity.

Complement-mediated thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) has been associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection in adults but has not been studied in the pediatric population. We hypothesized that complement activation plays an important role in SARS-CoV-2 infection in children and sought to understand if TMA was present in these patients. We enrolled 50 hospitalized pediatric patients with acute SARS-CoV-2 infection (n = 21, minimal coronavirus disease 2019 [COVID-19]; n = 11, severe COVID-19) or MIS-C (n = 18). As a biomarker of complement activation and TMA, soluble C5b9 (sC5b9, normal 247 ng/mL) was measured in plasma, and elevations were found in patients with minimal disease (median, 392 ng/mL; interquartile range [IQR], 244-622 ng/mL), severe disease (median, 646 ng/mL; IQR, 203-728 ng/mL), and MIS-C (median, 630 ng/mL; IQR, 359-932 ng/mL) compared with 26 healthy control subjects (median, 57 ng/mL; IQR, 9-163 ng/mL; P < .001). Higher sC5b9 levels were associated with higher serum creatinine (P = .01) but not age. Of the 19 patients for whom complete clinical criteria were available, 17 (89%) met criteria for TMA. A high proportion of tested children with SARS-CoV-2 infection had evidence of complement activation and met clinical and diagnostic criteria for TMA. Future studies are needed to determine if hospitalized children with SARS-CoV-2 should be screened for TMA, if TMA-directed management is helpful, and if there are any short- or long-term clinical consequences of complement activation and endothelial damage in children with COVID-19 or MIS-C.","Diorio, Caroline; McNerney, Kevin O; Lambert, Michele; Paessler, Michele; Anderson, Elizabeth M; Henrickson, Sarah E; Chase, Julie; Liebling, Emily J; Burudpakdee, Chakkapong; Lee, Jessica H; Balamuth, Frances B; Blatz, Allison M; Chiotos, Kathleen; Fitzgerald, Julie C; Giglia, Therese M; Gollomp, Kandace; Odom John, Audrey R; Jasen, Cristina; Leng, Tomas; Petrosa, Whitney; Vella, Laura A; Witmer, Char; Sullivan, Kathleen E; Laskin, Benjamin L; Hensley, Scott E; Bassiri, Hamid; Behrens, Edward M; Teachey, David T",Blood Adv,462,16

The layer dependent inhibitory effect of graphene nanosheets on spike receptor-binding domain of 6LZG, complexed with host receptor i.e. angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) of SARS-CoV-2 was investigated through computational study. Graphene sample was synthesized using mechanical exfoliation with shear stress and its mechanism of inhibition towards the SARS-CoV-2 virus was explored by molecular docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation method. The thermodynamics study for the free binding energy of graphene towards the SARS-CoV-2 virus was analyzed. The binding energy of graphene towards the virus increased with an increasing number of layers. It shows the highest affinity of -17.5 Kcal/mol in molecular docking while &#916;Gbinding is in the order of -28.01 ± 0.04 5 Kcal/mol for the seven-layers structure. The increase in carbon layers is associated with an increasing number of edge sp3 -type carbon, providing greater curvature, further increase the surface reactivity responsible for high binding efficiency.

This research examined the influence dark personality traits on attitudes toward the COVID-19 pandemic and quarantine rules. We determined whether specific dark traits could predict non-compliance, beyond the global measure of dark personality traits. Additionally, previous research suggests that people are more likely to violate rules for the benefits of close relations, rather than for their own self-interests. We examined how this tendency interacts with dark traits. The 823 participants in the study completed measures of the dark triad, moral disengagement, and attitudes toward COVID-19 rules, and responded to vignettes about themselves or close relations escaping quarantine. Using a bifactor model approach, results showed that a general dark factor predicted non-compliance to COVID-19 rules, but that some moral disengagement mechanisms contributed to non-compliance beyond this factor. Vignette results showed that participants were more willing to break quarantine rules for a close relation than for themselves, except for those high in moral disengagement, who broke rules more-regardless of who was involved. These findings have important implications for intervention programs and policies, since individuals with dark traits tend to ""selfishly"" trespass norms, but anyone can ""go beyond the pale, i.e., go outside the limits of acceptable behavior, for a loved one.","Espinosa, Pablo; Clemente, Miguel",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),462,23

As replication of many viruses - including MERS-CoV - is supported by enhanced aerobic glycolysis, we hypothesized that SARS-CoV-2 replication in host cells (especially airway cells) is reliant upon altered glucose metabolism. This metabolism is similar to the Warburg effect well studied in cancer. Counteracting two main pathways (PI3K/AKT and MAPK/ERK signaling) sustaining aerobic glycolysis inhibits MERS-CoV replication and thus, very likely that of SARS-CoV-2, which shares many similarities with MERS-CoV. The Warburg effect appears to be involved in several steps of COVID-19 infection. Once induced by hypoxia, the Warburg effect becomes active in lung endothelial cells, particularly in the presence of atherosclerosis, thereby promoting vasoconstriction and micro thrombosis. Aerobic glycolysis also supports activation of pro-inflammatory cells such as neutrophils and M1 macrophages. As the anti-inflammatory response and reparative process is performed by M2 macrophages reliant on oxidative metabolism, we speculated that the switch to oxidative metabolism in M2 macrophages would not occur at the appropriate time due to an uncontrolled pro-inflammatory cascade. Aging, mitochondrial senescence and enzyme dysfunction, AMPK downregulation and p53 inactivation could all play a role in this key biochemical event. Understanding the role of the Warburg effect in COVID-19 can be essential to developing molecules reducing infectivity, arresting endothelial cells activation and the pro-inflammatory cascade.","Icard, Philippe; Lincet, Hubert; Wu, Zherui; Coquerel, Antoine; Forgez, Patricia; Alifano, Marco; Fournel, Ludovic",Biochimie,462,18

Tapentadol is approved for cancer pain in Japan; however, real-world evidence on tapentadol's effectiveness and safety for cancer-related pain in Japan is limited. METHODS: This retrospective study evaluated the effectiveness, safety, and tolerability of tapentadol (by patient type-opioid-naïve and opioid-tolerant) in 84 patients with moderate-to-severe cancer pain at Ichikawa General Hospital between September 2014 and August 2016. RESULTS: Almost 93% of patients achieved clinically relevant pain relief within 4 days (median). Over 90% of patients with neuropathic pain or mixed pain and all patients with nociceptive pain were responders. Pain intensity significantly decreased from baseline through to the end of maintenance period in opioid-naïve and opioid-tolerant patients. No patients discontinued tapentadol due to serious adverse events. No opioid-naïve patients experienced nausea or vomiting during tapentadol treatment. Only three opioid-tolerant patients experienced nausea which was considered to be related to tapentadol. CONCLUSION: Tapentadol is effective and well tolerated in opioid-naïve and opioid-tolerant patients with cancer pain of varying pathophysiology, including those with nociceptive and/or neuropathic components. Tapentadol may be considered for first-line use in moderate-to-severe cancer-related pain.","Sazuka, Shoichiro; Koitabashi, Toshiya",J. anesth,462,16

Here, we report the dynamic changes of SARS-CoV-2 viral antigens in nasopharyngeal swabs of COVID-19 patients and its association with the viral nucleic acid clearance and clinical outcomes. Eighty-five COVID-19 patients were enrolled for detection of SARS-CoV-2 viral antigens, including 57 anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody negative cases and 28 antibody positive cases. The viral antigen could be detected in 52.63% (30/57) patients with SARS-CoV-2 antibody negative at the early stage of SARS-CoV-2 infection, especially in the first 5 days after disease onset (p = 0.0018) and disappeared in about 8 days after disease onset. Viral antigens were highly detectable in patients with low Ct value (less than 30) of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid RT-PCT assay, suggesting the expression of viral antigen was associated with high viral load. Furthermore, positive antigen detection indicated disease progression, nine cases with positive antigen (9/30, 30.0%), in contrast to two cases (2/27, 7.40%) (p = 0.0444) with negative antigen, which progressed into severe disease. Thus, the viral antigens were persistent in early stages of infection when virus was in highly replicating status, and viral antigen detection promises to rapidly screen positive patients in the early stage of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Lv, Ying; Ma, Yuanyuan; Si, Yanhui; Zhu, Xiaoyi; Zhang, Lin; Feng, Haiyan; Tian, Di; Liao, Yixin; Liu, Tiefu; Lu, Hongzhou; Ling, Yun",Biosci Trends,462,1

The complete epidemic data are available for a complete assessment of epidemiological parameters in all regions and time periods. METHODS: This study aims to present a spatiotemporal epidemic model based on spatially stratified heterogeneity (SSH) to simulate the epidemic spread. A susceptible-exposed/latent-infected-removed (SEIR) model was constructed for each SSH-identified stratum (each administrative city) to estimate the spatiotemporal epidemiological parameters of the outbreak. RESULTS: We estimated that the mean latent and removed periods were 5.40 and 2.13 days, respectively. There was an average of 1.72 latent or infected persons per 10,000 Wuhan travelers to elsewhere until January 20th, 2020. The space-time basic reproduction number (R0) estimates indicate an initial value between 2 and 3.5 in most cities on this date. The mean period for R0 estimates to decrease to 80% and 50% of initial values in cities were an average of 14.73 and 19.62 days, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Our model estimates the complete spatiotemporal epidemiological characteristics of the outbreak in a space-time domain, and the findings will help enhance a comprehensive understanding of the outbreak and inform the strategies of prevention and control in other countries worldwide.","Hu, Bisong; Ning, Pan; Qiu, Jingyu; Tao, Vincent; Devlin, Adam Thomas; Chen, Haiying; Wang, Jinfeng; Lin, Hui",Int. j. infect. dis,462,12

We aimed to assess the medication management practices in place for NCDs during the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic across European countries. In December 2020, the European Network to Advance Best practices & technoLogy on medication adherencE (ENABLE) conducted a cross-sectional, web-based survey in 38 European and one non-European countries. Besides descriptive statistics of responses, nonparametric tests and generalized linear models were used to evaluate the impact on available NCD services of the number of COVID-19 cases and deaths per 100,000 inhabitants, and gross domestic product (GDP) per capita. Fifty-three collaborators from 39 countries completed the survey. In 35 (90%) countries face-to-face primary-care, and out-patient consultations were reduced during the COVID-19 pandemic. The mean +/- SD number of available forms of teleconsultation services in the public healthcare system was 3 +/- 1.3. Electronic prescriptions were available in 36 (92%) countries. Online ordering and home delivery of prescription medication (avoiding pharmacy visits) were available in 18 (46%) and 26 (67%) countries, respectively. In 20 (51%) countries our respondents were unaware of any national guidelines regarding maintaining medication availability for NCDs, nor advice for patients on how to ensure access to medication and adherence during the pandemic. Our results point to an urgent need for a paradigm shift in NCD-related healthcare services to assure the maintenance of chronic pharmacological treatments during COVID-19 outbreaks, as well as possible future disasters.","Agh, T.; van Boven, J.

It is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a novel virus that can be transmitted easily from human to human mainly by the respiratory route. Currently, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19 or a vaccine for prevention. The disease has various degrees of severity. It often presents with nonspecific symptoms such as fever, headache, and fatigue, accompanied by respiratory symptoms (e.g., cough and dyspnea) and other systemic involvement. Severe disease is associated with hemophagocytic syndrome and cytokine storm due to altered immune response. Patients with severe disease are more likely to have increased liver enzymes. The disease can affect the liver through various mechanisms. CASE REPORT We report an unusual case of SARS-CoV-2 infection in a 24-year-old man with no previous medical illness, who presented with mild respiratory involvement. He had no serious lung injury during the disease course. However, he experienced acute fulminant hepatitis B infection and cytokine release syndrome that led to multiorgan failure and death. CONCLUSIONS It is uncommon for SARS-CoV-2 infection with mild respiratory symptoms to result in severe systemic disease and organ failure. We report an unusual case of acute hepatitis B infection with concomitant SARS-CoV-2 leading to fulminant hepatitis, multiorgan failure, and death.","Ali, Elrazi; Ziglam, Hisham; Kohla, Samah; Ahmed, Mohanad; Yassin, Mohamed",Am J Case Rep,462,5

It is imperative to detect COVID-19 at the earliest to limit the span of infection. In this work, a new classification technique CB-STM-RENet based on deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Channel Boosting is proposed for the screening of COVID-19 in chest X-Rays. In this connection, to learn the COVID-19 specific radiographic patterns, a new convolution block based on split-transform-merge (STM) is developed. This new block systematically incorporates region and edge-based operations at each branch to capture the diverse set of features at various levels, especially those related to region homogeneity, textural variations, and boundaries of the infected region. The learning and discrimination capability of the proposed CNN architecture is enhanced by exploiting the Channel Boosting idea that concatenates the auxiliary channels along with the original channels. The auxiliary channels are generated from the pre-trained CNNs using Transfer Learning. The effectiveness of the proposed technique CB-STM-RENet is evaluated on three different datasets of chest X-Rays namely CoV-Healthy-6k, CoV-NonCoV-10k, and CoV-NonCoV-15k. The performance comparison of the proposed CB-STM-RENet with the existing techniques exhibits high performance both in discriminating COVID-19 chest infections from Healthy, as well as, other types of chest infections. CB-STM-RENet provides the highest performance on all these three datasets; especially on the stringent CoV-NonCoV-15k dataset. The good detection rate (97%), and high precision (93%) of the proposed technique suggest that it can be adapted for the diagnosis of COVID-19 infected patients.

A systematic review,16.510191,6.859264,2021,"Two types of ion-conducting polyimides with sulfonate or ether functional groups were synthesized as ion-type or coordination-type cathode binders for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), respectively. Although superior ion transport abilities have been reported for both types of ion-conducting polymers, their electrochemical performances are significantly different and the corresponding transport mechanisms at the electrolyte/electrode interface remain elusive. Here, we combine experimental and computational techniques to investigate the cathode interface in the presence of both functional polymer binders in comparison with the poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) binder as reference. A broad shoulder in the cyclic voltammogram accompanied by a poor rate performance of battery tests was observed for a LiFePO4 cathode with coordination-type ether-based polyimide (EPI) binder. In contrast, a LiFePO4 cathode with ion-type sulfonated polyimide (SPI) binder exhibits smaller concentration polarization, achieving satisfactory capacity at high current density. Simulations show that the ether-based binder strongly coordinates Li ions and thus slows the diffusion of Li ions. This leads to the reduction of the LIB electrochemical performance at a high C-rate. In contrast, the negative moiety of the SPI binder leads to less localization of Li ions, allowing a slightly higher Li-ion mobility. Conventional PVDF shows no affinity to Li ions, leading to less Li-ion accumulation at the electrode/electrolyte interface. Yet, the cathode surface covered with PVDF shows the lowest Li-ion diffusivity compared to those with the two types of Li-ion-conducting binders. Therefore, cathodes with SPI and PVDF binders show less polarization at the electrode interface and allow higher C-rate performance of LIBs. The combined results provide a comprehensive understanding of the mechanism of ion conduction in ion- and coordination-type Li-ion-conducting polymer binders.

A systematic review,16.575045,7.2595897,2021,"We examined whether heterosexual individuals' self-reported sexual orientation could be influenced experimentally by manipulating their knowledge of the nature of sexual orientation. In Study 1 (180 university students, 66% female) participants read summaries describing evidence for sexual orientation existing on a continuum versus discrete categories or a control manipulation, and in Study 2 (460 participants in a nationally representative Qualtrics panel, 50% female) additionally read summaries describing sexual orientation as fluid versus stable across the life-course. After reading summaries, participants answered various questions about their sexual orientation. In Study 1, political moderates and progressives (but not conservatives) who read the continuous manipulation subsequently reported being less exclusively heterosexual, and regardless of political alignment, participants reported less certainty about their sexual orientation, relative to controls. In Study 2, after exposure to fluid or continuous manipulations heterosexual participants were up to five times more likely than controls to rate themselves as non-exclusively heterosexual. Additionally, those in the continuous condition reported less certainty about their sexual orientation and were more willing to engage in future same-sex sexual experiences, than those in the control condition. These results suggest that non-traditional theories of sexual orientation can lead heterosexuals to embrace less exclusive heterosexual orientations.","Morandini, James S; Dacosta, Liam; Dar-Nimrod, Ilan",Sci Rep,462,1

In a randomized, double-blind, parallel, placebo-controlled trial, 100 HD patients were randomly divided into 4 equal groups: (a) PPE + Vit E, received 2 pomegranate tablets (each tablet contained 225 mg PPE, equal to 90 mg ellagic acid) + 1 Vit E soft gel (400 IU) daily, (b) PPE, received 2 pomegranate tablets + 1 Vit E placebo soft gel daily, (c) Vit E, received 1 Vit E soft gel + 2 pomegranate placebo tablets daily, and (d) placebo, received 2 pomegranate placebo tablets + 1 Vit E placebo soft gel daily. For group allocation, a stratified block randomization procedure based on sex, age, and HD duration was used. Each intervention product and its placebo had identical shape, color, size, and packaging. Consumption of PPE + Vit E significantly reduced the serum CRP level (mean change: -7.12 ± 4.59 mg l-1, P < 0.001) compared to other groups, while reduced levels of IL-6 (mean change: -2.19 ± 2.33 pg ml-1, P < 0.001), TNF-&#945; (mean change: -2.41 ± 3.21 pg ml-1, P = 0.008), ICAM-1 (mean change: -64.2 ± 111.0 ng ml-1, P = 0.017), and VCAM-1 (mean change: -117.7 ± 177.1 ng ml-1, P = 0.002) were observed compared to the control. There was no significant difference in the P-selectin level among the groups. Consumption of PPE or Vit E alone significantly reduced the CRP level (mean change for PPE: -3.58 ± 5.41 mg l-1, P < 0.001; mean change for Vit E: -3.25 ± 8.29 mg l-1, P = 0.002) compared to the control. As a result, consumption of PPE in combination with Vit E enhanced the inflammatory status and endothelial function in HD patients.","Jafari, Tina; Fallah, Aziz A; Reyhanian, Ali; Sarmast, Elham",Food funct,462,22

This has provided people with ongoing access to vital health services while minimizing their potential exposure to infection and allowing them to maintain social distancing. However, these solutions may have unintended consequences for health equity. Poverty, lack of access to digital health, poor engagement with digital health for some communities, and barriers to digital health literacy are some factors that can contribute to poor health outcomes. We present the Digital Health Equity Framework, which can be used to consider health equity factors. Along with person-centered care, digital health equity should be incorporated into health provider training and should be championed at the individual, institutional, and social levels. Important future directions will be to develop measurement-based approaches to digital health equity and to use these findings to further validate and refine this model.","Crawford, Allison; Serhal, Eva",J Med Internet Res,462,18

The reality could well be that the many of the world's wealthy coastal cities which historically developed as ports will be inundated repeatedly to disappear eventually below the sea, with large swathes of the earth being flooded. Other major conurbations may cease to be liveable without air conditioning, while large numbers of people could well starve as a result of disruption of ecosystems. To the extent that this possibility is recognized, it is nevertheless perceived as a gradual process with the worst results in a distance future with any sea-level rise a gradual process. Limiting emissions is unlikely to be sufficient, because the level of carbon dioxide in the earth's atmosphere is now much higher than ever before since humans started to exploit fossil fuels. We know this from the study of ancient air bubbles in Antarctic ice cores. There is a lack of balance between the energy transmitted by the incoming sunlight and the earth's outgoing infrared heat radiation. So far this imbalance is absorbed by the enormous thermal mass of the oceans. As to the speed of sea-level rise, a period of extremely rapid sea-level rise of about 1.4 cm per year has occurred in the prehistoric past and disintegration of ice sheets as is happening currently may well be a plausible explanation of this fact. In fact, it is straightforward to create substantial amounts of negative emissions of carbon dioxide. Nevertheless, making it happen will require an unprecedented degree of global cooperation, a high level of taxation on the extraction of coal and crude oil, and the use of pressurized liquid petrol gas as aviation fuel.","Heesterman, Aart Reinier Gustaaf",Clean Technol Environ Policy,462,20

The REFLECT rubric (Wald et al. 2012) was developed to address the challenge of assessing these written reflections. The objective of this replication work is to explore the reproducibility of the reliability characteristics presented by the REFLECT developers. METHODS: Five raters evaluated narratives written by medical students and experienced clinicians using the REFLECT rubric. Reliability across rubric domains was determined via intraclass correlation coefficient and internal consistency was determined via Cronbach's alpha. RESULTS: Intraclass coefficients demonstrated poor reliability for ratings across all tool criteria (0.350-0.452) including overall ratings of narratives (0.448). Moreover, the internal consistency between scale items was also poor across all criteria (0.529-0.621). DISCUSSION: We did not replicate the reliability characteristics presented in the original REFLECT article. We consider these findings with respect to the contextual differences that existed between our study and the Wald and colleagues study, pointing particularly at the possible influence that repetitive testing and refinement of the tool may have had on their reviewers' shared understanding of its use.

The pathogenesis of liver damage and its association with damage to the lung, heart, and brain and to the other protean manifestations of COVID-19 disease are not fully understood. In particular, tissue damage from thinning and leaky blood vessels appears to result from an inflammatory response to the virus rather than the virus itself. This article outlines a new hypothesis of the nature of the inflammatory factor responsible for tissue damage in COVID-19. Review of the literature reveals that COVID-19 disease closely resembles an endogenous form of hypervitaminosis A. We propose that SARS-CoV-2 virus-induced liver damage causes retinoic acid and stored retinyl esters to be released into the circulation in toxic concentrations, unbound to protein, with resulting damage to organs including the lungs, heart, blood vessels, and skin. Several lines of evidence support this model of disease causation.

Smell and/or taste disorders have emerged as a very frequent symptom as the disease has spread in Europe. Spain is one of the European countries with the highest number of infections. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the clinical progression of smell and taste disorders in Spanish patients with mild COVID-19. METHODS: An online survey was used to conduct a cross-sectional study of patients who presented sudden smell and/or taste disorders during the 2 months of total lockdown due to COVID-19 in Spain. RESULTS: In our sample, 91.18% of respondents with impaired smell and/or taste and who were able to undergo PCR testing were positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Anosmia and ageusia presented in isolation in 6.5% of participants. The remaining 93.5% presented other mild symptoms: headache (51.6%), cough (51.6%), myalgia (45.2%), asthaenia (38.7%), nasal congestion or rhinorrhoea (35.5%), fever (41.9%), low-grade fever (29.0%), odynophagia (25.8%), or diarrhoea (6.5%). The mean duration of anosmia was 8.33 days, with patients subsequently manifesting hyposmia; complete resolution occurred after a mean of 17.79 days.

STUDY DESIGN: Observational study. PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY: Departments of Infection Disease, Internal Medicine and Radiology, Sakarya Training and Research Hospital, Sakarya, Turkey, between March and May 2020. METHODOLOGY: This study was consisted of 100 adult patients having rRT-PCR positive COVID-19 pneumonia diagnossed by thorax CT. The clinical features, thorax USG and CT findings of these patients were recorded and expressed. USG and thorax CT findings were scored using a method described before. Continuous variables were expressed as mean (±SD) values. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was used for the normal distribution test, and continuous variables were compared using the Mann-Whitney U test. USG and CT performed at time of admission to the hospital. Descriptive statistics were conducted based on the structures of variable. RESULTS: A total of 100 patients (54 men and 46 women; mean age, 59.88±13.03 years; range, 28-91years) with COVID-19 pneumonia were evaluated. Involvement areas on the lower posterior of the right side were detected as 70% by ultrasound and 74% by CT. Positively correlation was detected in lung scans assessed by USG and CT (p<0.001, r=0.705). CONCLUSION: Ultrasound has several advantages including no ionizing radiation exposure for health care workers, being a safe, fast and non-invasive diagnostic technique with bedside usage. Hence, ultrasound is an efficient alternative to diagnosis and monitor of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia.

Lymphopenia may be considered as a cardinal laboratory finding, with prognostic potential. Neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio and peak platelet/lymphocyte ratio may also have prognostic value in determining severe cases. During the disease course, longitudinal evaluation of lymphocyte count dynamics and inflammatory indices, including LDH, CRP and IL-6 may help to identify cases with dismal prognosis and prompt intervention in order to improve outcomes. Biomarkers, such high serum procalcitonin and ferritin have also emerged as poor prognostic factors. Furthermore, blood hypercoagulability is common among hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Elevated D-Dimer levels are consistently reported, whereas their gradual increase during disease course is particularly associated with disease worsening. Other coagulation abnormalities such as PT and aPTT prolongation, fibrin degradation products increase, with severe thrombocytopenia lead to life-threatening disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), which necessitates continuous vigilance and prompt intervention. So, COVID-19 infected patients, whether hospitalized or ambulatory, are at high risk for venous thromboembolism, and an early and prolonged pharmacological thromboprophylaxis with low molecular weight heparin is highly recommended.

The availability of both monomer and dimer crystal bound with a common ligand, '13b' (&#945;-ketoamide inhibitor), opened up opportunities to understand the Mpro mechanism of action. A comparative analysis of both forms of Mpro was carried out to elucidate the binding site architectural differences in the presence and absence of '13b'. Molecular dynamics simulations suggest that the presence of '13b' enhances the stability of Mpro than the unbound APO form. The N- and C- terminals of both the protomers stabilize each other, and making it's interface essential for the active form of Mpro. In comparison to monomer, the relatively high affinity of '13b' is gained in dimer pocket due to the high stability of the pocket by the interaction of S1 residue of chain B with residues F140, E166 and H172 of chain A, which is absent in monomer. The comprehensive essential dynamics, protein structure network analysis and thermodynamic profiling highlight the hot-spots, pivotal in molecular recognition process at protein-ligand and protein-protein interaction levels, cross-validated through computational alanine scanning study. A comparative description of '13b' binding mechanism in both forms illustrates valuable insights into the inhibition mechanism and the selection of critical residues suitable for the structure-based approaches for the identification of more potent Mpro inhibitors.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

A range of therapies have been proven to be useful for patients with ARDS, including ventilatory and nonventilatory strategies. Prone positioning is one of the nonventilatory strategies and has been proven to be safe and is associated with significant mortality benefit in patients with moderate to severe ARDS. It is now included in several international guidelines as the standard of care for these cases. OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to develop, implement, and evaluate a prone positioning program in two nonmetropolitan, nontertiary intensive care units in South East Queensland. METHODS: A Plan-Do-Study-Act quality improvement model was used to implement changes in clinical practice in relation to prone positioning of patients. RESULTS: A description of the methods used to promote a complex change strategy is provided in this article. CONCLUSIONS: In this article, we demonstrate the feasibility of introducing a nonventilatory intervention of prone positioning in the management of patients with moderate to severe ARDS in regional intensive care in South East Queensland. This implementation strategy could be replicated and adopted in other similar intensive care units that do not have the ability to provide tertiary services such as extracorporeal life support.","Apte, Yogesh; Jacobs, Kylie; Shewdin, Shaun; Murray, Andrew; Tung, Luke; Ramanan, Mahesh; Massey, Debbie",Aust. crit. care,462,1

MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this retrospective study, we searched our clinical database between March 1st, 2020 and May 22nd, 2020 to identify patients who had positive real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on throat swabs for COVID-19, had availability of clinical, laboratory information and had availability of CT scan of chest or abdominal radiograph, abdominal ultrasound or CT scan within 2 weeks of the diagnosis. Abdominal imaging findings on all imaging modalities were documented. Chest CT severity score (CT-SS) was assessed in all patients. Clinical and laboratory findings were recorded from the electronic medical record. Statistical analysis was performed to determine correlation of abdominal findings with CT-SS, clinical and laboratory findings. RESULTS: Out of 264 patients with positive RT-PCR, 73 patients (38 males and 35 females; 35 African American) with mean age of 62.2 (range 21-94) years were included. The median CTSS was 13.5 (IQR 75-25 18-8). Most common finding in the abdomen on CT scans (n = 72) were in the gastrointestinal system in 13/72 patients (18.1%) with fluid-filled colon without wall thickening or pericolonic stranding (n = 12) being the most common finding. Chest-only CT (n = 49) found bowel findings in 3 patients. CTSS did not differ in terms of age, sex, race or number of comorbidities but was associated with longer duration of hospitalization (p = 0.0.0256), longer intensive care unit stay (p = 0.0263), more frequent serum lactate dehydrogenase elevation (p = 0.0120) and serum C-reactive protein elevation (p = 0.0402). No statistically significant correlation of occurrence of bowel abnormalities with CTSS, clinical or laboratory features. Deep venous thrombosis was seen in 7/72 patients (9.8%) with three patients developing pulmonary embolism CONCLUSION: Abnormal bowel is the most common finding in the abdomen in patients with COVID-19 infection, is often without abdominal symptoms and occurs independent of severity of pulmonary involvement, other clinical and laboratory features.","Tirumani, Sree Harsha; Rahnemai-Azar, Ata A; Pierce, Jonathan D; Parikh, Keval D; Martin, Sooyoung S; Gilkeson, Robert; Ramaiya, Nikhil H",Abdom. radiology (Internet),462,8

As learned from severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), proper biospecimen handling is necessary to prevent laboratory-related infections. METHODS: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and World Health Organization severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) interim biosafety guidelines continue to be updated. Presented here are additional considerations intended to complement the interim guidance. These considerations draw on prior SARS recommendations and recent COVID-19 reports. RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA has been detected in various biospecimen types; however, studies are needed to determine whether viral load indicates viable virus. Throughout the pandemic, biospecimens will be collected for various purposes from COVID-19 known and suspected cases, as well as presymptomatic and asymptomatic individuals. Current data suggest the pandemic start may be as early as October 2019; thus, all biospecimens collected since could be considered potentially infectious. CONCLUSIONS: All entities handling these biospecimens should do risk assessments in accordance with institutional policies and adhere to any guidance provided. The scientific community has a responsibility to safely handle and maintain all biospecimens collected during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Our framework uses frontier analysis to identify the desirability of available health interventions so decision makers can choose diverse portfolios based upon information about expected returns and risks.

METHODS: A retrospective analysis of stroke related to large vessel occlusion was conducted amongst patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection and underlying mild atherosclerotic disease, between 19 March and 19 April 2020 in six different stroke centers in the Île-de France area, France. RESULTS: The median age was 52 years, median body mass index was 29.5 kg/m2 . All patients displayed previous vascular risk factors such as high blood pressure, diabetes, dyslipidemia or body mass index > 25. The delay between the first respiratory symptoms of COVID-19 and stroke was 11.5 days.

Recognizing that these fomites can be a secondary route for disease transmission, exploring the deposition pattern of such sessile respiratory droplets on daily-use substrates thus becomes crucial. EXPERIMENTS: The used surrogate respiratory fluid is composed of a water-based salt-protein solution, and its precipitation dynamics is studied on four different substrates (glass, ceramic, steel, and PET). For tracking the final deposition of viruses in these droplets, 100 nm virus emulating particles (VEP) are used and their distribution in dried-out patterns is identified using fluorescence and SEM imaging techniques. FINDINGS: The final precipitation pattern and VEP deposition strongly depend on the interfacial transport processes, edge evaporation, and crystallization dynamics. A constant contact radius mode of evaporation with a mixture of capillary and Marangoni flows results in spatio-temporally varying edge deposits. Dendritic and cruciform-shaped crystals are majorly seen in all substrates except on steel, where regular cubical crystals are formed. The VEP deposition is higher near the three-phase contact line and crystal surfaces. The results showed the role of interfacial processes in determining the initiation of fomite-type infection pathways in the context of COVID-19.","Rasheed, Abdur; Sharma, Shubham; Kabi, Prasenjit; Saha, Abhishek; Chaudhuri, Swetaprovo; Basu, Saptarshi",J Colloid Interface Sci,462,33

Rigorous analysis of the model reveals that its associated continuum of disease-free equilibria is globally-asymptotically stable whenever the control reproduction number is less than unity. The epidemiological implication of this result is that the disease will eventually die out, particularly if control measures are implemented early and for a sustainable period of time. For instance, numerical simulations suggest that if the lockdown measures in South Africa were implemented a week later than the 26 March, 2020 date it was implemented, this will result in the extension of the predicted peak time of the pandemic, and causing about 10% more cumulative deaths. In addition to illustrating the effectiveness of self-isolation in reducing the number of cases, our study emphasizes the importance of surveillance testing and contact tracing of the contacts and confirmed cases in curtailing the pandemic in South Africa.","Garba, Salisu M; Lubuma, Jean M-S; Tsanou, Berge",Math Biosci,462,3

Determining microbiomes diversity implies the assignment of individual reads to taxa by comparison to reference databases. Although computational methods aimed at identifying the microbe(s) taxa are available, it is well known that inferences using different methods can vary widely depending on various biases. In this study, we first apply and compare different bioinformatics methods based on 16S ribosomal RNA gene and shotgun sequencing to three mock communities of bacteria, of which the compositions are known. We show that none of these methods can infer both the true number of taxa and their abundances. We thus propose a novel approach, named Core-Kaiju, which combines the power of shotgun metagenomics data with a more focused marker gene classification method similar to 16S, but based on emergent statistics of core protein domain families. We thus test the proposed method on various mock communities and we show that Core-Kaiju reliably predicts both number of taxa and abundances. Finally, we apply our method on human gut samples, showing how Core-Kaiju may give more accurate ecological characterization and a fresh view on real microbiomes.","Tovo, Anna; Menzel, Peter; Krogh, Anders; Cosentino Lagomarsino, Marco; Suweis, Samir",Nucleic acids res,462,33

Multiple triage systems for nonemergent surgical procedures have been published, but potentially curative cancer procedures are essential surgery rather than elective surgery. In the present and future scenario of our country, thoracic oncology teams may have the difficult decision of weighing the utility of surgical intervention against the risk for inadvertent COVID-19 exposure for patients and medical staff. In consequence, traditional pathways of surgical care must be adjusted to reduce the risk of infection and the use of resources. It is recommended that all thoracic cancer patients should be offered treatment according to the accepted standard of care until shortage of services require a progressive reduction in surgical cases. Here, we present a consensus of recommendations discussed by a multidisciplinary panel of experts on thoracic oncology and based on the best available evidence, and hope it will provide a modifiable framework of guidance for local strategy planners in thoracic cancer care services in Mexico.

METHODS: This study retrospectively included 43 patients with a laboratory-confirmed infection and 33 patients with a suspected infection, in whom the disease was eventually excluded. The IgM/IgG titer of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was measured by chemiluminescence immunoassay analysis. RESULTS: Compared to molecular detection, the sensitivities of serum IgM and IgG antibodies to diagnose COVID-19 were 48.1% and 88.9%, and the specificities were 100% and 90.9%, respectively.In the COVID-19 group, the IgM-positive rate increased slightly at first and then decreased over time; in contrast, the IgG-positive rate increased to 100% and was higher than IgM at all times. The IgM-positive rate and titer were not significantly different before and after conversion to virus-negative. The IgG-positive rate was up to 90% and not significantly different before and after conversion to virus-negative. However, the median IgG titer after conversion to virus-negative was double that before, and the difference was significant. CONCLUSIONS: Viral serological testing is an effective means of diagnosis for SARS-CoV-2 infection.

In this sense, several factors may be related to the increase in experiences of anxiety and depression in PwMS during the current pandemic. OBJECTIVE: In this study we first explored the reactions of anxiety, depression and fear to COVID-19 in a group of PwMS that belong to the Ibero-American region. Besides, we explored whether having been positive to COVID-19, fear of COVID-19, the obstacles to attend medical appointments during the outbreak and subjective experience of MS progression, could predict the anxiety and depression reactions in our PwMS sample. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An online cross-sectional survey was conducted on 202 MS patients from six countries (Argentina, Mexico, Spain, Dominican Republic, Venezuela and Cuba). For comparisons between variables an independent-samples t-test and one-way analysis of variance were used. Multiple linear regression was used to evaluate the effects of potential predictor variables over emotional reactions. RESULTS: Our results showed that PwMS who were positive for COVID-19 reported higher levels of fear of COVID-19 (p<.001) and also higher levels of anxiety (p<.001) compared to non-positive patients. Those patients who had difficulties attending their medical appointments during the outbreak showed higher levels of depression (p=.03) and anxiety (p=.019). Levels of anxiety (p<.001) and depression (p=.006) were also higher among patients with the subjective experience of MS disease progression. The reactions of fear of COVID-19, having been positive to COVID-19, problems attending medical appointments, and subjective experience of MS disease progression showed a high association with the negative impact of the pandemic on mental health of PwMS. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that the situation generated by the COVID-19 pandemic has had a negative impact on the mental health of PwMS in our sample. Our results also alert to the importance of offering psychological care to patients with multiple sclerosis during the current outbreak, regardless of whether they have been positive for COVID-19.","Broche-Pérez, Yunier; Jiménez-Morales, Rodneys M; Monasterio-Ramos, Laura Ortiz; Vázquez-Gómez, Lázaro A; Fernández-Fleites, Zoylen",Mult Scler Relat Disord,462,23

This has appropriately led to prioritization of frail older adults and LTC residents, and those who care for them, in the vaccination effort against COVID-19. Older adults have distinct immunological, clinical, and practical complexity, which can be understood through a lens of frailty. Even so, frailty has not been considered in studies of COVID-19 vaccines to date, leading to concerns that the vaccines have not been optimally tailored for and evaluated in this population even as vaccination programs are being implemented. This is an example of how vaccines are often not tested in Phase 1/2/3 clinical trials in the people most in need of protection. We argue that geriatricians, as frailty specialists, have much to contribute to the development, testing and implementation of COVID-19 vaccines in older adults. We discuss roles for geriatricians in ten stages of the vaccine development process, covering vaccine design, trial design, trial recruitment, establishment and interpretation of illness definitions, safety monitoring, consideration of relevant health measures such as frailty and function, analysis methods to account for frailty and differential vulnerability, contributions in regulatory and advisory roles, post-marketing surveillance, and program implementation and public health messaging. In presenting key recommendations pertinent to each stage, we hope to contribute to a dialogue on how to push the field of vaccinology to embrace the complexity of frailty.

Damaneh-Daran aquifer is located at upstream of the Zayandehrood reservoir in west-central Iran. This aquifer has been highly contaminated by nitrate and is still rapidly being contaminated. Thus, its quality needs to be remediated. This paper is focused on the quantity-quality modeling to predict the average nitrate concentration of the aquifer. Several remediation scenarios are presented in a period beginning from fall 2019, ending in spring 2024. These scenarios address several ways to mitigate the injection of the major sources of contamination in the region, such as equipping the urban regions with wastewater collection and treatment plants and reducing the fertilizers' use. The decreased use of the fertilizers may be achieved through two strategies: directly reducing the amount of the fertilizers by several specific and predefined rates of reduction and indirectly decreasing the amount of the fertilizers used by crop pattern modification. The latter strategy is evaluated to replace all or a part of the areas allocated to the more fertilizer-demanding crops with those of the less fertilizer-demanding crops. Furthermore, some of these scenarios are hybridized to more mitigate groundwater quality degradation. The results of performing the proposed scenarios are once compared together and then compared with the trend scenario letting current case study conditions and facilities be held in the future. The results suggest that the scenario hybridizing the effects of the wastewater treatment plants-equipping scenario with those of the quality-enhancing crop pattern modification scenario is evaluated as the most effective and best-performing scenario, implementation of which offers 20% and 30% reduction of the nitrate concentration for the agricultural and urban areas, respectively.","Samadi-Darafshani, Mahsa; Safavi, Hamid R; Golmohammadi, Mohammad H; Rezaei, Farshad",Environ Monit Assess,462,1

METHODS: We conducted a systematic review using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. A comprehensive literature search was conducted in Global Health, SCOPUS, Medline and EMBASE using pertinent key words and Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms relating to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and HIV. A narrative synthesis was undertaken. Articles are summarized in relevant sections. RESULTS: Two hundred and eighty-five articles were identified after duplicates had been removed. After screening, eight studies were analysed, totalling 70 HIV-infected patients (57 without AIDS and 13 with AIDS). Three themes were identified: (1) controlled HIV infection does not appear to result in poorer COVID-19 outcomes, (2) more data are needed to determine COVID-19 outcomes in patients with AIDS and (3) HIV-infected patients presenting with COVID-19 symptoms should be investigated for superinfections. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that PLHIV with well-controlled disease are not at risk of poorer COVID-19 disease outcomes than the general population.

Methods: A Computer-Aided Diagnostic model for the acceptable and non-invasive prediction of CAD using the State Space Advanced FCM (AFCM) approach is proposed. Also, a rule-based mechanism is incorporated, to further increase the knowledge of the system and the interpretability of the decision mechanism. The proposed method is tested utilizing a CAD dataset from the Laboratory of Nuclear Medicine of the University of Patras. More specifically, two architectures of AFCMs are designed, and different parameter testing is performed. Furthermore, the proposed AFCMs, which are based on the new equations proposed recently, are compared with the traditional FCM approach. Results: The experiments highlight the effectiveness of the AFCM approach and the new equations over the traditional approach, which obtained an accuracy of 78.21%, achieving an increase of seven percent (+7%) on the classification task, and obtaining 85.47% accuracy. Conclusions: It is demonstrated that the AFCM approach in developing Fuzzy Cognitive Maps outperforms the conventional approach, while it constitutes a reliable method for the diagnosis of Coronary Artery Disease. Conclusions and future research related to recent pandemic of coronavirus are provided.","Apostolopoulos, Ioannis D.; Groumpos, Peter P.; Apostolopoulos, Dimitris I.",,462,20

To identify the resources and costs needed to implement school-based mitigation strategies and provide schools and jurisdictions with information to aid resource allocation, a microcosting methodology was employed to estimate costs in three categories: materials and consumables, additional custodial staff members, and potential additional transportation. National average estimates, using the national pre-kindergarten through grade 12 (preK-12) public enrollment of 50,685,567 students, range between a mean of $55 (materials and consumables only) to $442 (all three categories) per student. State-by-state estimates of additional funds needed as a percentage of fiscal year 2018 student expenditures (2) range from an additional 0.3% (materials and consumables only) to 7.1% (all three categories); however, only seven states had a maximum estimate above 4.2%.

Here, we estimated the number of Libyans exposed to COVID-19 by using a COVID-19 mortality adjusted mathematical model for the spread of infectious diseases. We estimated that 14-20% of the Libyan population have been exposed to the COVID-19 pandemic. Thus, the risk of spread of COVID-19 infections during the coming months is high, and a considerable number of Libyans, particularly the elderly and people with chronic diseases, should be protected against COVID-19 infection.

The severity of COVID-19 disease ranges from asymptomatic to fatal acute respiratory distress syndrome. In few patients, the disease undergoes phenotypic differentiation between 7 and 14 days of acute illness, either resulting in full recovery or symptom escalation. However, the mechanism of such variation is not clear, but the facts suggest that patient's immune status, comorbidities, and the systemic effects of the viral infection (potentially depending on the SARS-CoV-2 strain involved) play a key role. Subsequently, patients with the most severe symptoms tend to have poor outcomes, manifest severe hypoxia, and possess elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (including IL-1ß, IL-6, IFN-Î³, and TNF-&#945;) along with elevated levels of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10, marked lymphopenia, and elevated neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratios. Based on the available evidence, we propose a mechanism wherein SARS-CoV-2 infection induces direct organ damage while also fueling an IL-6-mediated cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and hypoxia, resulting in escalating systemic inflammation, multi-organ damage, and end-organ failure. Elevated IL-6 and hypoxia together predisposes patients to pulmonary hypertension, and the presence of asymptomatic hypoxia in COVID-19 further compounds this problem. Due to the similar downstream mediators, we discuss the potential synergistic effects and systemic ramifications of SARS-CoV-2 and influenza virus during co-infection, a phenomenon we have termed ""COVI-Flu."" Additionally, the differences between CRS and cytokine storm are highlighted. Finally, novel management approaches, clinical trials, and therapeutic strategies toward both SARS-CoV-2 and COVI-Flu infection are discussed, highlighting host response optimization and systemic inflammation reduction.","Leyfman, Yan; Erick, Timothy K; Reddy, Sandeep S; Galwankar, Sagar; Nanayakkara, Prabath W B; Di Somma, Salvatore; Sharma, Pushpa; Stawicki, Stanislaw P; Chaudry, Irshad H",Shock,462,24

We compared the incidence, causes, and outcomes of ventilator-associated events (VAEs) in ventilated patients with and without Covid-19. Methods We retrospectively identified all VAEs in adult patients on mechanical ventilation in two academic and two community hospitals in Eastern Massachusetts from 2017-2020. We compared VAE incidence between March 1-August 31 in each year (to correspond to the timeframe of the pandemic in 2020). We reviewed the charts of 200 randomly selected patients with VAEs (100 with Covid-19 and 100 without) to determine reasons for intubation and conditions precipitating VAEs. Results From 2017 through 2020 there were 236, 221, 291, and 458 VAEs during each 6-month period. Of the 458 VAEs during 2020, 224 were amongst patients with Covid-19 and 234 without. The mean incidence of VAEs per 100 episodes of mechanical ventilation trended higher in 2020 compared to prior years (8.0 vs 5.4, p=.09, Figure 1) but the rate of VAEs per 1000 ventilator-days was similar (19.6 vs 19.0, p=.56, Figure 1). The distribution of VAC and IVAC-plus was similar in Covid-19 vs non-Covid-19 patients. Mean age was also similar but male sex (72% vs 60%, p=.01), hypertension (59% vs. 50%, p=.02) and diabetes (50% vs. 19%, p&lt;.01) were more common amongst Covid-19 patients. Median duration of mechanical ventilation was longer in VAE patients with Covid-19 (21 vs 13 days, p&lt;.01) but there was no significant difference in in-hospital mortality (32% vs 39%, P=.14). On medical record review, the most common reason for intubation in Covid-19 patients with VAEs was Covid-19 pneumonia (91%), whereas non-Covid-19 patients with VAEs were most commonly intubated for surgery (26%), altered mental status (26%), and cardiac arrest (9%). The most common conditions precipitating VAEs in Covid-19 were ARDS (53%), pneumonia (22%), and atelectasis (11%) versus pneumonia (31%), pulmonary edema (23%) and atelectasis (20%) in patients without Covid-19. Conclusions VAEs were more frequent on a per-episode basis during Covid-19 compared to the same months in pre-Covid-19 years but rates per 1000 ventilator-days were similar, reflecting the longer duration of mechanical ventilation in Covid-19 patients. Progressive ARDS accounted for over half of VAEs in Covid-19 patients, whereas pulmonary edema, atelectasis and pneumonia were the most common triggers in patients without Covid-19. These findings provide insight into the natural history of Covid-19 in ventilated patients and may inform strategies to mitigate complications in this population.","Weinberger, J.; Rhee, C.; Klompas, M.",American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine,462,1

Constitutive activation of the janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT) signaling pathway in MF leads to cell proliferation, inhibition of cell death, and clonal expansion of myeloproliferative malignant cells. Fedratinib is a selective oral JAK2 inhibitor recently approved in the United States for treatment of adult patients with intermediate-2 or high-risk MF. In mouse models of JAK2V617F-driven myeloproliferative disease, fedratinib blocked phosphorylation of STAT5, increased survival, and improved MF-associated disease features, including reduction of white blood cell counts, hematocrit, splenomegaly, and fibrosis. Fedratinib exerts off-target inhibitory activity against bromodomain-containing protein 4 (BRD4); combination JAK/STAT and BRD4 inhibition was shown to synergistically block NF-kB hyperactivation and inflammatory cytokine production, attenuating disease burden and reversing bone marrow fibrosis in animal models of MPNs. In patients, fedratinib is rapidly absorbed and dosed once daily (effective half-life 41 h). Fedratinib showed robust clinical activity in JAK-inhibitor-naïve patients and in patients with MF who were relapsed, refractory, or intolerant to prior ruxolitinib therapy. Fedratinib is effective regardless of JAK2 mutation status. Onset of spleen and symptom responses are typically seen within the first 1-2 months of treatment. The most common adverse events (AEs) with fedratinib are grades 1-2 gastrointestinal events, which are most frequent during early treatment and decrease over time. Treatment discontinuation due to hematologic AEs in clinical trials was uncommon (~3%). Suspected cases of Wernicke's encephalopathy were reported during fedratinib trials in ~1% of patients; thiamine levels should be monitored before and during fedratinib treatment as medically indicated. Phase III trials are ongoing to assess fedratinib effects on long-term safety, efficacy, and overall survival. The recent approval of fedratinib provides a much-needed addition to the limited therapeutic options available for patients with MF.","Talpaz, Moshe; Kiladjian, Jean-Jacques",Leukemia,462,9

In these days, the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus through the air has become a controversial topic among scientists. Various organizations provide standard methods for monitoring biological agents in the air. Nevertheless, there has been no standard recommended method for sampling and determination of viruses in air. This manuscript aimed at reviewing published papers for sampling and detection of corona viruses, especially SARS-Cov-2 as a global health concern. It was found that SARS-Cov 2 was present in some air samples that were collected from patient's rooms in hospitals. This result warrants its airborne transmission potential. However, due to the fact that in the most reviewed studies, sampling was performed in the patient's room, it seems difficult to discriminate whether it is airborne or is transmitted through respiratory droplets. Moreover, some other disrupting factors such as patient distance from the sampler, using protective or oxygen masks by patients, patient activities, coughing and sneezing during sampling time, air movement, air conditioning, sampler type, sampling conditions, storage and transferring conditions, can affect the results. About the sampling methods, most of the used samplers such as PTFE filters, gelatin filers and cyclones showed suitable performance for trapping SARS-Co and MERS-Cov viruses followed by PCR analysis.","Rahmani, Ali Reza; Leili, Mostafa; Azarian, Ghasem; Poormohammadi, Ali",Sci Total Environ,462,2

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study involved 32 confirmed COVID-19 patients who were divided into two groups according to the evidence of fibrosis on their latest follow-up CT imaging. Clinical data and CT imaging features of all the patients in different stages were collected and analyzed for comparison. RESULTS: The latest follow-up CT imaging showed fibrosis in 14 patients (male, 12; female, 2) and no fibrosis in 18 patients (male, 10; female, 8). Compared with the non-fibrosis group, the fibrosis group was older (median age: 54.0 years vs. 37.0 years, p = 0.008), and the median levels of C-reactive protein (53.4 mg/L vs. 10.0 mg/L, p = 0.002) and interleukin-6 (79.7 pg/L vs. 11.2 pg/L, p = 0.04) were also higher. The fibrosis group had a longer-term of hospitalization (19.5 days vs. 10.0 days, p = 0.001), pulsed steroid therapy (11.0 days vs. 5.0 days, p < 0.001), and antiviral therapy (12.0 days vs. 6.5 days, p = 0.012). More patients on the worst-state CT scan had an irregular interface (59.4% vs. 34.4%, p = 0.045) and a parenchymal band (71.9% vs. 28.1%, p < 0.001). On initial CT imaging, the irregular interface (57.1%) and parenchymal band (50.0%) were more common in the fibrosis group. On the worst-state CT imaging, interstitial thickening (78.6%), air bronchogram (57.1%), irregular interface (85.7%), coarse reticular pattern (28.6%), parenchymal band (92.9%), and pleural effusion (42.9%) were more common in the fibrosis group. CONCLUSION: Fibrosis was more likely to develop in patients with severe clinical conditions, especially in patients with high inflammatory indicators. Interstitial thickening, irregular interface, coarse reticular pattern, and parenchymal band manifested in the process of the disease may be predictors of pulmonary fibrosis. Irregular interface and parenchymal band could predict the formation of pulmonary fibrosis early.","Yu, Minhua; Liu, Ying; Xu, Dan; Zhang, Rongguo; Lan, Lan; Xu, Haibo",Korean J Radiol,462,29

We set out to evaluate tricuspid valve anterior leaflet deformations in ovine FTR. Eleven animals (FTR group) underwent implantation of a pacemaker with high rate pacing to induce biventricular dysfunction and at least moderate TR. Subsequently, both FTR (n=11) and Control (n=12) animals underwent implantation of 6 sonomicrometry crystals around the tricuspid annulus, 4 on the anterior leaflet, and 14 on RV epicardium. Tricuspid valve geometry and anterior leaflet strains were calculated from crystal coordinates. Left ventricular ejection fraction and RV fractional area change were significantly lower in FTR animals versus Control. Tricuspid annular area, septo-lateral diameter, RV pressures were all significantly greater in the FTR group. Mean TR grade (+0-3) was 0.7±0.5 in Control and 2.4±0.5 in FTR (p=<0.001). The anterior leaflet area and length increased significantly. Global radial leaflet strain was significantly lower in FTR mostly driven by decreased free edge leaflet strain. Global circumferential anterior leaflet strain was also significantly lower in FTR with more remarkable reduction in the belly region. Rapid ventricular pacing in sheep resulted in a clinically pertinent model of RV and annular dilation with FTR and leaflet enlargement. Both circumferential and radial anterior leaflet strains were significantly reduced with FTR. Functional TR may be associated with alteration of leaflet mechanical properties.","Jazwiec, Tomasz; Malinowski, Marcin J; Ferguson, Haley; Parker, Jessica; Mrudang, Mathur; Rausch, Manuel K; Timek, Tomasz A",Semin. thorac. cardiovasc. surg,462,20

During the patient's period of isolation (February 5th to February 29th, 2020), the author used Roy's adaptation model to perform first-level holistic physical, psychological, and social nursing assessments and collected health-problem information using face-to-face interviews, telephone interviews, and observations via a remote monitoring system. A second level of assessment confirmed that the problems faced by the patient included (1) existing infections related to COVID-19 and (2) anxiety related to uncertainties about disease prognosis, forgiveness from the family, and potential violations of personal privacy by the media. Due to the special nature of the isolation ward, the author used a remote physiological monitoring system to monitor the vital signs, fever, and shortness of breath status of the patient to quickly decrease her physical discomfort and to improve her self-care ability during hospitalization. Environmental cleanliness was strictly maintained to reduce the risk of cross-infection and ensure patient safety. To alleviate patient anxiety, the author established a good therapeutic interpersonal relationship with the patient by making 10-60 minutes of caring calls to her each day, by providing individual care measures, and by using the Internet to play audio and video to teach mindfulness meditation.

Inspired by these facts, this paper studies an extensive survey to draw a new direction of blockchain integration into 6G mobile networks, IoT technologies, and smart industries focusing the potential merits and challenges in terms of infrastructure sharing, computational loads, latency, bandwidth overhead, business model, sustainability goals, and edge intelligence. We highlighted the convergence of IoT in blockchain to enable intelligent distribution in future industrial IoT and the technical model of 6G networks to realize the successful deployment of BCT schemes. This paper pointed out the current intriguing challenges, canvassed the mitigation techniques, and plausible future research opportunities that may benefit the pursuit of this vision.","Jahid, Abu; Alsharif, Mohammed H.; Hall, Trevor J.",,462,1

The purpose of this article is to report our experience for rescheduling nonemergent imaging and procedures during the pandemic at our tertiary academic institution. METHODS: We rescheduled the nonemergent imaging and procedures in our hospitals and outpatient centers from March 16 to May 4, 2020. We created a tiered priority system to reschedule patients for whom imaging could be delayed with minimal clinical impact. The radiologists performed detailed chart reviews for decision making. We conducted daily virtual huddles with discussion of rescheduling strategies and issue tracking. RESULTS: Using a snapshot during the rescheduling period, there was a 53.4% decrease in imaging volume during the period of March 16 to April 15, 2020, compared with the same time period in 2019. The total number of imaging studies decreased from 38,369 in 2019 to 17,891 in 2020 during this period. Although we saw the largest reduction in outpatient imaging (72.3%), there was also a significant decrease in inpatient (40.5%) and emergency department (48.9%) imaging volumes. DISCUSSION: The use of multiple communication channels was critical in relaying the information to all our stakeholders, patients, referring physicians, and the radiology workforce. Teamwork, quick adoption, and adaptation of changing strategies was important given the fluidity of the situation.","Vagal, Achala; Mahoney, Mary; Allen, Becky; Kapur, Sangita; Udstuen, Gavin; Wang, Lily; Braley, Susan; Makramalla, Abouelmagd; Chadalavada, Seetharam; Choe, Kyuran A; Scheler, Jennifer; Brown, Ann; England, Eric; Hudepohl, Joseph; Rybicki, Frank J",J Am Coll Radiol,462,1

We reported a modified PT technique aiming to minimize the risk of aerosol generation and to increase the staff safety in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: PT was performed with a modified technique including the use of a smaller endotracheal tube (ETT) cuffed at the carina during the procedure. RESULTS: The modified technique we proposed was successfully performed in three critically ill patients with COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: In COVID-19 critically ill patients, a modified PT technique, including the use of a smaller ETT cuffed at the carina and fiber-optic bronchoscope inserted between the tube and the inner surface of the trachea, may ensure a better airway management, respiratory function, patient comfort, and great safety for the staff.","Vargas, Maria; Russo, Gennaro; Iacovazzo, Carmine; Servillo, Giuseppe",Head Neck,462,16

Practitioners in the construction industry are facing high probabilities of COVID-19 transmission, while their knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) are critical to the prevention of virus spread. This study seeks to investigate the KAP of construction industry practitioners in China through an online questionnaire survey conducted from 15 to 30 June 2020. A total of 702 effective responses were received and analyzed. The results revealed that: (1) although an overwhelming percentage of respondents had the correct knowledge about COVID-19, there were significant respondents (15% of all) who were unsure or wrong about the human-to-human transmission of the virus; (2) practitioners generally showed an optimistic attitude about winning the battle against the COVID-19 pandemic and were satisfied with the governments' contingency measures; (3) practitioners tended to actively take preventive measures, although checking body temperature, wearing face masks, and keeping safe social distance still needs to be reinforced. This research is among the first to identify the KAP of construction industry practitioners toward the COVID-19 pandemic in China.

SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein and its receptor binding domain (RBD) are the antigens with higher potential to develop SARS-CoV-2 serological assays. Moreover, structural studies of these antigens are key to understand the molecular basis for Spike interaction with angiotensin converting enzyme 2 receptor, hopefully enabling the development of COVID-19 therapeutics. Thus, it is urgent that significant amounts of this protein became available at the highest quality. In this study, we produced Spike and RBD in two human derived cell hosts: HEK293-E6 and Expi293F&#8482;. We evaluated the impact of different and scalable bioprocessing approaches on Spike and RBD production yields and, more importantly, on these antigens' quality attributes. Using negative and positive sera collected from human donors, we show an excellent performance of the produced antigens, assessed in serologic enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) tests, as denoted by the high specificity and sensitivity of the test. We show robust Spike productions with final yields of approx. 2 mg/L of culture that were maintained independently of the production scale or cell culture strategy. To the best of our knowledge, the final yield of 90 mg/L of culture obtained for RBD production, was the highest reported to date. An in-depth characterization of SARS-CoV-2 Spike and RBD proteins was performed, namely the antigen's oligomeric state, glycosylation profiles, and thermal stability during storage. The correlation of these quality attributes with ELISA performance show equivalent reactivity to SARS-CoV-2 positive serum, for all Spike and RBD produced, and for all storage conditions tested. Overall, we provide straightforward protocols to produce high-quality SARS-CoV-2 Spike and RBD antigens, that can be easily adapted to both academic and industrial settings; and integrate, for the first time, studies on the impact of bioprocess with an in-depth characterization of these proteins, correlating antigen's glycosylation and biophysical attributes to performance of COVID-19 serologic tests.","Castro, Rute; Nobre, Lígia S; Eleutério, Rute P; Thomaz, Mónica; Pires, António; Monteiro, Sandra M; Mendes, Sónia; Gomes, Ricardo A; Clemente, João J; Sousa, Marcos F Q; Pinto, Filipe; Silva, Ana C; Freitas, Micael C; Lemos, Ana R; Akpogheneta, Onome; Kosack, Lindsay; Bergman, Marie-Louise; Duarte, Nadia; Matoso, Paula; Costa, Júlia; Bandeiras, Tiago M; Gomes-Alves, Patricia; Gonçalves, Carlos P; Demengeot, Jocelyne; Alves, Paula M",Biotechnol. bioeng,462,16

Massive changes in the health care system imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic clearly impact the overall quality of medical care. In this survey, we aim to explore experiences and concerns of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) regarding the current pandemic. METHODS: A 40-item web-based questionnaire on disease-related experiences and concerns during the COVID-19 pandemic was made available to patients with IBD from 28 April 2020 to 31 July 2020. RESULTS: An increased risk of SARS-CoV2 infection was a concern for 56.7% of the 1199 patients (aged 41.3±12.8, women 77%, Crohn's disease 58.8%, ulcerative colitis 38.5%); 61.7% feared an increased risk of severe disease course of COVID-19. Effective preventive measures in either outpatient practices or hospitals were observed by 84.7% of the patients. Appointments with an IBD specialist were canceled in 38.7%, frequently on the patients' initiative. Telecommunication visits were considered an acceptable alternative to personal visits by 71.0%. Medication was reduced or paused in 6.9% because of the pandemic. A swab (SARS-CoV2-PCR) was done in 13.2% of the patients; only 3 patients (0.25%) were tested positive. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic is a major concern of patients with IBD. However, the cumulative prevalence in our cohort is low. Patients at risk should be identified and counseled individually. When required because of the local COVID-19 situation, telecommunication visits and liberal prescription policies are advisable to reduce in-person contacts, while ensuring continuous therapy and maintaining communication with patients.","Schlabitz, Franziska; Teich, Niels; Riesner-Wehner, Anica; Böhm, Sebastian; Greinert, Robin; Eisenmann, Stephan; Michl, Patrick; Walldorf, Jens",J. clin. gastroenterol,462,10

Measures to mitigate the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused widespread changes in human activity, leading to a months-long reduction in seismic noise of up to 50%. The 2020 seismic noise quiet period is the longest and most prominent global anthropogenic seismic noise reduction on record. Although the reduction is strongest at surface seismometers in populated areas, this seismic quiescence extends for many kilometers radially and hundreds of meters in depth. This quiet period provides an opportunity to detect subtle signals from subsurface seismic sources that would have been concealed in noisier times and to benchmark sources of anthropogenic noise. A strong correlation between seismic noise and independent measurements of human mobility suggests that seismology provides an absolute, real-time estimate of human activities.","Lecocq, Thomas; Hicks, Stephen P; Van Noten, Koen; van Wijk, Kasper; Koelemeijer, Paula; De Plaen, Raphael S M; Massin, Frédérick; Hillers, Gregor; Anthony, Robert E; Apoloner, Maria-Theresia; Arroyo-Solórzano, Mario; Assink, Jelle D; Büyükakpinar, Pinar; Cannata, Andrea; Cannavo, Flavio; Carrasco, Sebastian; Caudron, Corentin; Chaves, Esteban J; Cornwell, David G; Craig, David; den Ouden, Olivier F C; Diaz, Jordi; Donner, Stefanie; Evangelidis, Christos P; Evers, Läslo; Fauville, Benoit; Fernandez, Gonzalo A; Giannopoulos, Dimitrios; Gibbons, Steven J; Girona, Társilo; Grecu, Bogdan; Grunberg, Marc; Hetényi, György; Horleston, Anna; Inza, Adolfo; Irving, Jessica C E; Jamalreyhani, Mohammadreza; Kafka, Alan; Koymans, Mathijs R; Labedz, Celeste R; Larose, Eric; Lindsey, Nathaniel J; McKinnon, Mika; Megies, Tobias; Miller, Meghan S; Minarik, William; Moresi, Louis; Márquez-Ramírez, Víctor H; Möllhoff, Martin; Nesbitt, Ian M",Science,462,16

METHODS: From June to August 2020, semi-structured interviews were conducted. Sixteen nurses caring for COVID-19 patients during the first surge of the pandemic were selected via purposive sampling. Participants worked in ICUs of a quaternary 1,000-bed hospital in the Northeast United States. Interviews were transcribed verbatim, identifiers were removed, and data were coded thematically. RESULTS: Our exploratory study identified four themes that describe the experiences of nurses providing care to patients in COVID-19 ICUs during the first surge: (a) challenges of working with new co-workers and teams, (b) challenges of maintaining existing working relationships, (c) role of nursing leadership in providing information and maintaining morale and (d) the importance of institutional-level acknowledgement of their work. CONCLUSIONS: As the pandemic continues, hospitals should implement nursing staffing models that maintain and strengthen existing relationships to minimize exhaustion and burnout.

The body of evidence on COVID-19 increases at an impressive pace, calling for a method to rapidly assess the current knowledge and identify key information. Gold standard methods, such as systematic reviews and meta-analyses are unsuitable due to their narrow scope and high time-consumption. OBJECTIVE: To explore the published scientific literature on COVID-19 and map the research evolution during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We analyzed the titles, keywords, and abstracts of articles on COVID-19 from PubMed. We used latent Dirichlet allocation modeling to extract topics and conducted trend analysis to explore the temporal changes of research for each topic, journal impact factor (JIF), and geographical origin. RESULTS: Our search identified 16 670 relevant articles dated between February 14, 2020, and June 1, 2020. Of these articles, six were reports from peer-reviewed randomized trials on COVID-19 patients. We identified 14 main research topics. The most common topics were healthcare response, and clinical manifestations with 2 812/16 670 (16.9%) and 1 828/16 670 (11.0%) publications, respectively. We found a growing trend of publications on clinical manifestations, and protective measures, and a decrease in research on disease transmission, epidemiology, healthcare response, and radiology. Publications on protective measures, immunology, and clinical manifestations were associated with the highest JIF. We calculated an overall median JIF of 3.7 (IQR 2.6-5.9) and found that the publications' JIF declined over time. The top countries of research origin were the USA, China, Italy, and the UK. CONCLUSIONS: In less than six months since the detection of the novel coronavirus, a remarkably high number of articles on COVID-19 have been published. We present the temporal changes of the available COVID-19 research during the early phase of the pandemic. Our findings may aid researchers and policy makers to form a structured view of the current COVID-19 evidence base and provide further research directions.","Älgå, Andreas; Eriksson, Oskar; Nordberg, Martin",J. med. internet res,462,24

METHODS: This population-based cohort study identified all COVID-19 cases among the whole PLWH in Wuhan city, China, by April 16, 2020. The epidemiological, virological and serological features were analyzed based on the demographic data, temporal profile of nucleic acid test for SARS-CoV-2 during the disease, and SARS-CoV-2-specific IgM and IgG after recovery. RESULTS: From January 1 to April 16, 2020, 35 of 6001 PLWH have experienced COVID-19, with the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 to be 0.58% (95%CI: 0.42%-0.81%). Among the COVID-19 cases, 15 (42.86%) had severe illness, with 2 deaths. The incidence, case-severity and case-fatality of COVID-19 in PLWH were comparable to that in the entire population in Wuhan. 197 persons had cART discontinuation, of whom 4 persons experienced COVID-19. Risk factors for COVID-19 were age &#8805;50 years old and cART discontinuation. The median duration of SARS-CoV-2 viral shedding among confirmed COVID-19 cases in PLWH was 30 (IQR: 20-46) days. Cases with high HIV viral load (&#8805;20 copies/ml) had lower IgM and IgG levels than those with low HIV viral load (<20 copies/ml) (median S/CO for IgM, 0.03 vs. 0.11, P<0.001; median S/CO for IgG, 10.16 vs. 17.04, P=0.069). CONCLUSIONS: Efforts need to maintain the persistent supply of antiretroviral treatment to elderly PLWH aged 50 years or above during the COVID-19 epidemic. The coinfection of HIV and SARS-CoV-2 might change the progression and prognosis of COVID-19 patients in PLWH.","Huang, Jiao; Xie, Nianhua; Hu, Xuejiao; Yan, Han; Ding, Jie; Liu, Pulin; Ma, Hongfei; Ruan, Lianguo; Li, Gang; He, Na; Wei, Sheng; Wang, Xia",Clin. infect. dis,462,1

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-2019), which was defined by the World Health Organization as pandemic, has rapidly emerged as a global health threat. Outbreak evolution and prevention of international implications require substantial flexibility of frontline health care facilities in their response. AIM To explore the effect of the implementation and management strategy of prescreening triage in children during COVID-19. METHODS The standardized triage screening procedures included a standardized triage screening questionnaire, setup of pre-screening triage station, multi-point temperature monitoring, extensive screenings, and two-way protection. In order to ensure the implementation of the pre-screening triage, the prevention and control management strategies included training, emergency exercise, and staff protection. Statistical analysis was performed on the data from all the children hospitalized from January 20, 2020 to March 20, 2020 at solstice during the pandemic period. Data were obtained from questionnaires and electronic medical record systems. RESULTS A total of 17561 children, including 2652 who met the criteria for screening, 192 suspected cases, and two confirmed cases without omission, were screened from January 20, 2020 to March 20, 2020 at solstice during the pandemic period. There was zero transmission of the infection to any medical staff. CONCLUSION The effective strategies for pre-screening triage have an essential role in the prevention and control of hospital infection. © The Author(s) 2021.

Previous and posterior phases were compared, and the period was compared with the same period in 2019. A total of 191,738 advertisements were downloaded using the Instar Analytics application and analyzed using inferential statistics to observe the presence of health advertisements during the four study periods. It was observed that during the lockdown, there were more health advertisements than after, as well as during the same period in 2019, although health advertisements had the strongest presence during the pre-lockdown phase. The presence of most types of health advertisements also changed during the four phases of the study. We conclude that, although many differences can be explained by the time of the year-due to the presence of allergies or colds, for instance-the lockdown and the pandemic affected health advertising. However, the effects were mostly visible after the lockdown, when advertisers and broadcasters had had time to adapt to the unexpected circumstances.","Blanco-Herrero, David; Gallardo-Camacho, Jorge; Arcila-Calderón, Carlos",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),462,20

The SARS-CoV-2 appears to have originated from bats but is now easily transmissible among humans, primarily through droplet or direct contact. Clinical features of COVID-19 include high fever, cough, and fatigue which may progress to ARDS. Respiratory failure can occur rapidly after this. The primary laboratory findings include lymphopenia and eosinopenia. Elevated D-dimer, procalcitonin, and CRP levels may correlate with disease severity. Imaging findings include ground-glass opacities and patchy consolidation on CT scan. Mortality is higher in patients with hypertension, cardiac disease, diabetes mellitus, cancer, and COPD. Elderly patients are more susceptible to severe disease and death, while children seem to have lower rates of infection and lower mortality. Diagnostic criteria and the identification of persons under investigation have evolved as more data has emerged. However, the approach to diagnosis is still very variable from region to region, country to country, and even among different hospitals in the same city. The importance of a clinical pathway to implement the most effective and relevant diagnostic strategy is of critical importance to establish the control of this virus that is responsible for more and more deaths each day.","Xu, Guogang; Yang, Yongshi; Du, Yingzhen; Peng, Fujun; Hu, Peng; Wang, Runsheng; Yin, Ming; Li, Tianzhi; Tu, Lei; Sun, Jinlyu; Jiang, Taijiao; Chang, Christopher",Clin Rev Allergy Immunol,462,3

Due to the lack of broad diagnostic setup, consistent reagent supply lines, and access to laboratory instruments and equipment, it is undoubtedly an enormous burden for developing countries to face the crisis. OBJECTIVES: To develop a cost-effective, reliable and sensitive multiplex assay for SARS-CoV-2 screening which would expand the testing capacities of a developing and low-income country like Bangladesh. STUDY DESIGN: Initially a singleplex and then a multiplex real-time reverse-transcriptase PCR assays were developed targeting 2 nucleocapsid genes of SARS-CoV-2, and the human RNase P gene as an internal control using laboratory-made mastermixes. Three sets of primer- probes were designed for each of the target genes and one set was optimized for the final reaction set-up. Limit of detection, cross-reactivity and reproducibility were checked in order to assess the sensitivity and specificity of the assays, and validation was done using clinical specimens. RESULTS: Clinical evaluation of the new assays using 240 nasopharyngeal swabs showed 100 % sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy in detecting SARS-CoV-2 infection in human. Equal efficiency and concordant results were observed between the singleplex and multiplex approaches. Notably, the kit was able to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA at very low concentration upto 5 copies/reaction. CONCLUSION: This is the first locally developed multiplex rRT-PCR kit in Bangladesh providing rapid and low-cost screening of COVID-19 which would be valuable for infection prevention and clinical management in the perspective of Bangladesh.","Noor, Farjana Akther; Safain, Kazi Sarjana; Hossain, Md Walid; Arafath, Khalid; Mannoor, Kaiissar; Kabir, Mazbahul",J Virol Methods,462,21

The study explores the return journeys of pilgrim-tourists from Iran to Pakistan during COVID-19 pandemic and contextualizes travel burnout as a negative emotional state placed in the existing theoretical streams. The conservation of resources theory (Hobfoll, 1989;2004) provided theoretical support to guide current study's research agenda. On the basis of a qualitative grounded theory research design, 47 in-depth interviews of pilgrim-tourists were conducted. Travel burnout emerged as a multidimensional concept comprising 3 core dimensions, i.e., low tourist self-efficacy, travel exhaustion and emotional maladaptation. Travel burnout anchors emerged as those factors that facilitated preservation of the tourists' resources when travel circumstances became beyond their regulation. The results pave the way for a more theoretically sound conceptualization of travel burnout. For destination marketing organizations, various avenues are identified that need attention to alleviate the tourist concerns that lead to burnout.

A major concern for neurologists worldwide is the course and outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with MS treated with different DMTs. Although initial studies do not suggest an unfavourable course of infection in this group of patients, the data is limited. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study included 396 MS patients treated with DMTs and confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection from 28 Polish MS centres. Information concerning patient demographics, comorbidities, clinical course of MS, current DMT use, as well as symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection, need for pharmacotherapy, oxygen therapy, and/or hospitalisation, and short-term outcomes was collected up to 30 January 2021. Additional data about COVID-19 cases in the general population in Poland was obtained from official reports of the Polish Ministry of Health. RESULTS: There were 114 males (28.8%) and 282 females (71.2%). The median age was 39 years (IQR 13). The great majority of patients with MS exhibited relapsing-remitting course (372 patients; 93.9%). The median EDSS was 2 (SD 1.38), and the mean disease duration was 8.95 (IQR 8) years. Most of the MS patients were treated with dimethyl fumarate (164; 41.41%). Other DMTs were less frequently used: interferon beta (82; 20.70%), glatiramer acetate (42; 10.60%), natalizumab (35;8.84%), teriflunomide (25; 6.31%), ocrelizumab (20; 5.05%), fingolimod (16; 4.04), cladribine (5; 1.26%), mitoxantrone (3; 0.76%), ozanimod (3; 0.76%), and alemtuzumab (1; 0.25%). The overall hospitalisation rate due to COVID-19 in the cohort was 6.81% (27 patients). Only one patient (0.3%) died due to SARS-CoV-2 infection, and three (0.76%) patients were treated with mechanical ventilation; 106 (26.8%) patients had at least one comorbid condition. There were no significant differences in the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection regarding patient age, duration of the disease, degree of disability (EDSS), lymphocyte count, or type of DMT used. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Most MS patients included in this study had a favourable course of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The hospitalisation rate and the mortality rate were not higher in the MS cohort compared to the general Polish population. Continued multicentre data collection is needed to increase the understanding of SARS-CoV-2 infection impact on the course of MS in patients treated with DMTs.","Czarnowska, Agata; Brola, Waldemar; Zajkowska, Olga; Rusek, Stanislaw; Adamczyk-Sowa, Monika; Kubicka-Baczyk, Katarzyna; Kalinowska-Lyszczarz, Alicja; Kania, Karolina; Slowik, Agnieszka; Wnuk, Marcin; Marona, Monika; Podlecka-Pietowska, Aleksandra; Nojszewska, Monika; Zakrzewska-Pniewska, Beata; Jasinska, Elzbieta; Goluch, Katarzyna; Lech, Beata; Noga, Magdalena; Perenc, Adam; Popiel, Malgorzata; Lasek-Bal, Anetta; Puz, Przemyslaw; Maciejowska, Katarzyna; Kucharska-Lipowska, Marta; Lipowski, Michal; Kapica-Topczewska, Katarzyna; Chorazy, Monika; Tarasiuk, Joanna; Kochanowicz, Jan; Kulikowska, Joanna; Wawrzyniak, Slawomir; Niezgodzinska-Maciejek, Anna; Pokryszko-Dragan, Anna; Gruszka, Ewa; Budrewicz, Slawomir; Bialek, Marta; Kurkowska-Jastrzebska, Iwona; Kurowska, Katarzyna; Stepien, Adam; Wlodek, Agata; Ptasznik, Violetta; Pawelczyk, Malgorzata; Sobolewski, Piotr; Lejmel, Henryka; Strzalinska, Katarzyna; Maciejowski, Maciej; Tutaj, Andrzej; Zwiernik, Jacek; Litwin, Anna; Lewanczyk, Bozena",Neurol Neurochir Pol,462,16

RESULTS: Chongqing reported a 5.3% case fatality rate of the 75 ICU patients. The median age of the ICU patients was 57 years (interquartile range, 25-75), and no bias was obtained in the sex ratio. A total of 93% of patients developed ARDS during ICU stay, and more than half had moderate ARDS. However, most of the patients (55%) were supported with high-flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy, but not mechanical ventilation. Nearly one third of patients with ARDS improved (arterial blood oxygen partial pressure/oxygen concentration >300 mm Hg) in 1 week, which was defined as early improvement of ARDS-- eiARDS. Patients with eiARDS had a higher survival rate and lower length of ICU stay than those with ""non-eiARDS"". Age (<55 years) was the only variable independently associated with eiARDS, with a risk ratio of 2.67 (95% confidence interval: 1.17-6.08). CONCLUSIONS: A new subphenotype of ARDS-- eiARDS in patients with COVID-19 was identified. As clinical outcomes differ, stratified management of patients based on eiARDS or age is highly recommended.","Zhan, Zhu; Yang, Xin; Du, Hu; Zhang, Chuanlai; Song, Yuyan; Ran, Xiaoyun; Zhang, An; Yang, Mei",,462,29

There is an urgent need to continue to deliver outpatient care for chronic neurological disease and teleneurology has the potential to fulfill this gap. Introduction: This study reports the implementation and utilization of teleneurology across all neurological subspecilities during the COVID-19 pandemic. Materials and Methods: This is a retrospective observational study that identified all in-person and teleneurology outpatient nonprocedural visits from January 5 to April 4, 2020, across neurological specialties at a single academic center. Visit volumes were assessed weekly and practice patterns were compared before and after March 15, 2020, as this was the date of a major statewide stay-at-home order in Ohio. Results: Before March 15 the mean in-person visit per week was 5129.4 and decreased to 866.7 after that date. The mean teleneurology visits per week increased from 209.1 to 2619.3 for the same time period. The overall teleneurology visit volume in the 3 weeks after March 15 increased by 533%. Discussion: In a relatively short time frame of 3 weeks, a single academic center was able to dramatically increase teleneurology visits to provide outpatient neurological care. Conclusions: This study demonostrates that teleneruology can be a solution for outpatient neurological care in the context of COVID-19. The increased utilization of teleneurology during this crisis has the potential to expand teleneurology and improve access to neurological care in the future outside the pandemic setting.","McGinley, Marisa P; Ontaneda, Daniel; Wang, Zhini; Weber, Malory; Shook, Steven; Stanton, Matthew; Bermel, Robert",Telemed. j. e. health,462,19

Truth or Myth?,16.594593,6.894814,2020,"The severe form of coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) is characterized by cytokine storm syndrome (CSS) and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Diabetes, obesity, and hypertension have, as minor common denominators, chronic low-grade inflammation and high plasma myeloperoxidase levels, which could be linked to pulmonary phagocytic hyperactivation and CSS. The hyperactivation of M1 macrophages with a proinflammatory phenotype, which is linked to aerobic glycolysis, leads to the recruitment of monocytes, neutrophils, and platelets from circulating blood and plays a crucial role in thrombo-inflammation (as recently demonstrated in COVID-19) through the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps and monocyte-platelet aggregates, which could be responsible for DIC. The modulation of glucose availability for activated M1 macrophages by means of a eucaloric ketogenic diet (EKD) could represent a possible metabolic tool for reducing adenosine triphosphate production from aerobic glycolysis in the M1 macrophage phenotype during the exudative phase. This approach could reduce the overproduction of cytokines and, consequently, the accumulation of neutrophils, monocytes, and platelets from the blood. Second, an EKD could be advantageous for the metabolism of anti-inflammatory M2 macrophages because these cells predominantly express oxidative phosphorylation enzymes and are best fed by the oxidation of fatty acids in the mitochondria. An EKD could guarantee the availability of free fatty acids, which are an optimal fuel supply for these cells. Third, an EKD, which could reduce high lactate formation by macrophages due to glycolysis, could favor the production of interferon type I, which are inhibited by excessive lactate production. From a practical point of view, the hypothesis, in addition to being proven in clinical studies, must obviously take into account the contraindications of an EKD, particularly type 1 or 2 diabetes treated with drugs that can cause hypoglycemia, to avoid the risk for side effects of the diet.","Sukkar, Samir Giuseppe; Bassetti, Matteo",Nutrition,462,12

This inclination can become especially striking when citizens reject notions that scientists would consider ""facts"" in the light of overwhelming scientific evidence and consensus. The resulting polarization over science has reached alarming levels in recent years. This theoretical review conceptualizes political polarization over science and argues that it is driven by two interrelated processes. Through psychological science rejection, people can implicitly disregard scientific facts that are inconsistent with their political identity. Alternatively, citizens can engage in ideological science rejection by adhering to a political ideology that explicitly contests science. This contestation can in turn be subdivided into four levels of generalization: An ideology can dispute either specific scientific claims, distinct research fields, science in general, or the entire political system and elite. By proposing this interdisciplinary framework, this article aims to integrate insights from various disciplines.","Rekker, Roderik",Public Underst Sci,462,24

In public health emergencies, the use of information to achieve disease prevention and treatment is incredibly important. Although both the Model of Information Acceptance (IAM) and Health Belief Model (HBM) have their own merits, they only focus on information or public influence factors to explain the public's online prevention and treatment information adoption intention. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to fill this gap by using IAM and HBM as the framework for exploring the influencing factors and paths in public health events that affect the public's adoption of online health information and health behaviors, focusing on both objective and subjective factors. METHODS: We carried out an online survey to collect the respondents (n=501) in China. Structural equation modeling was used to evaluate items and construct reliability and validity via confirmatory factor analysis, and the model goodness of fit and mediation effects were analyzed. RESULTS: The overall fitness indices for the model developed in this study indicated an acceptable fit. Adoption intention is predicted by information characteristic (beta=0.266, P<.001) and perceived usefulness (beta=0.565, P<.001), which jointly explanation nearly 67% of the adoption intention variance. Information characteristic (beta=0.244, P<.001), perceived drawbacks (beta=-0.097, P<.01), perceived benefits (beta=0.512, P<.001), and self-efficiency (beta=0.141, P<.001) jointly determine perceived usefulness and explanation about 81% variance of perceived usefulness. However, social influence is not statistically significant on perceived usefulness, and self-efficiency did not significantly influence adoption intention directly. CONCLUSIONS: By integrating IAM and HBM, this study provided the insight and an understanding that perceived usefulness and adoption intentions of the online health information could be influenced by the information characteristic, people's perception of information drawbacks and benefits, and self-efficiency. Moreover, people also have proactive behavior rather than reactive behavior to adopt information. Thus, we should consider these factors to help the ""informed public"" obtain useful information from two aspects, and one is to improve the quality of government and other official information. The other is to improve public information-obtaining capacity, to promote truths and fight rumors. Thereby contributing to saving lives as the pandemic continues to unfold and run its course.

This research explores relationships between GVRN and DVMT effects in developing countries (DCs), proposing that transport, supply chain and logistics management (TSCLM) incorporating agility, can enable GVRN more supportive and responsive. In so doing, efforts for DVMT and PVTY eradication can improve, alleviating problems for individuals and systems left unprepared, bereft and vulnerable. It is vital to pursue this area of research for theoretical and managerial features in the underexplored contexts are generally still novel. To heighten research and practical consciousness of interactions between GVRN, TSCLM and DVMT, especially PVTY effects, this paper engages literature review and associated conceptual model with propositions. The conceptual model focuses on relationships and interactions, combining institutional theory and organisational learning theory incorporating networking or collaboration, presenting four propositions to sustain further exploration, management and practice. In concluding, this researcher presents implications, and suggests future research avenues with respect to interrelationships of GVRN, TSCLM and DVMT. The incorporation of elements to better enable GVRN relationship with DVMT beneficial to PVTY eradication in business context with COVID-19 hindrances, can assist individuals and firms to be more agile and effective in planning, implementation and output systems and to sustain advantageous outcomes. This research contributes to augmenting theory and practice in supply-chain management, GVRN and DVMT, so researchers, managers and others can benefit from value added in improving processes and practices including success with eradicating COVID-19 hindrances to significant attainments.","Brathwaite, Juliette",International Journal of Business and Economic Development (IJBED),462,30

The approach is validated by several robustness tests and by contrasting our estimates with the official statistics on the recession caused by COVID-19 in different European countries during the first two quarters of 2020. Compared with the standard indicators, our results are much more chronologically disaggregated and up-to-date and, therefore, can inform the current debate on the appropriate policy response to the pandemic. Unsurprisingly, we find that nations that experienced the most severe initial outbreaks also grappled with the hardest economic recessions. However, we detect diffused signs of recovery, with economic activity in most European countries returning to its pre-pandemic level by August 2020. Furthermore, we show how delaying intervention or pursuing 'herd immunity' are not successful strategies, since they increase both economic disruption and mortality. The most effective short-run strategy to minimize the impact of the pandemic appears to be the introduction of early and relatively less stringent non-pharmaceutical interventions.","Fezzi, Carlo; Fanghella, Valeria",,462,29

Clinical trials and extensive studies are being conducted on a large scale for a better understanding of the pathophysiology of this disease and its effect on different organs. Several experimental treatment protocols have been introduced, in which hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) was one of the first drugs used. While patients can develop many side effects of HCQ, studies have documented a rare association of long-term HCQ treatment with zebra-like bodies in the ultrastructural examination of kidney biopsies, a finding typically seen in Fabry's disease, as well as in association with chronic HCQ use, among other drugs. We present a similar finding in the postmortem examination of a male in his early seventies with COVID-19 infection, who received five days of HCQ treatment before stopping the medication due to cardiac and renal toxicity.","Obeidat, Mohammad; Isaacson, Alexandra L; Chen, Stephanie J; Ivanovic, Marina; Holanda, Danniele",Ultrastruct Pathol,462,20

The fundamentals of the virus remain the same - one infected person will, without a lockdown pass it onto three others on average. The consequences of lifting the lockdown are unforeseeable and the stakes are high. Due to the different spectrum of severity with same strain of virus and uncertainty of post lockdown era, lifting the lockdown will be a trial and error approach. Nevertheless, at some point the lockdown has to be lifted. The strategic approach would be innumerable testing, investigations, strong contact tracing, isolation and follow-up.

There is increasing evidence to suggest Vitamin D deficiency may increase individuals risk of COVID-19 infection and susceptibility. We aimed to determine the relationship between severity of vitamin D deficiency and sufficiency and COVID-19 infection within healthcare workers. Methods: The study included an observational cohort of healthcare workers who isolated due to COVID-19 symptoms from 12th to 22nd May 2020, from the University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust (UHBFT). This was part of the COVID-19 convalescent immunity study (COCO). Data collected included SARS-CoV-2 seroconversion status, serum 25(OH)D3 levels as well as age, body mass index (BMI), sex, ethnicity, job role, and co-morbidities. Participants were grouped into four vitamin D (VD) categories. 1) Severe VD deficiency (VD <30 nmol/L); 2) VD deficiency (VD > or equal to 30 nmol/L and <50 nmol/L); 3) VD insufficiency (VD > or equal to 50 nmol/L and <75 nmol/L); 4) VD sufficiency (VD > or equal to 75 nmol/L). Results: When VD levels were compared against COVID-19 seropositivity rate, a U-shaped curve was identified in the total population. This trend repeated when split into subgroups of age, sex, ethnicity, BMI, and co-morbidity status. Significant difference was identified in the COVID-19 seropositivity rate between VD groups between multiple VD groups in the total population, males, females, BAME, BMI<30 (kg/m2), 0 and +1 comorbidities; the majority of which were differences when the severely VD deficient category were compared to the other group. A significantly larger proportion of those within the Black, Asian, minority ethnic (BAME) group (vs. white ethnicity) were severely vitamin D deficient (P <0.00001). A significantly higher proportion of the 0-comorbidity subgroup were vitamin D deficient in comparison to the 1+ comorbidity subgroup (P = 0.046). Conclusions: Further investigation of the U-shaped curves is required to determine whether high VD levels can have a detrimental effect on susceptibility to COVID-19 infection. Future randomised clinical trials of VD supplementation could potentially identify optimal VD levels. This would allow for targeted therapeutic treatment for those at-risk such as in the BAME group.","Mackay, William R; Lugg, Sebastian T; Faniyi, Aduragbemi A; Faustini, Sian; Webster, Craig; Duffy, Joanne; Hewison, Martin; Shields, Adrian; Richter, Alex A; Parekh, Dhruv; Scott, Aaron; Thickett, David R",,462,13

However, the events surrounding the latest threat to global health, the PHEIC COVID-19, may be sufficient to highlight the role of mass gatherings, mass migration, and other forms of dense gatherings of people on the emergence, sustenance, and transmission of novel pathogens. The COVID-19 spread illustrates the role of MGs in exacerbation of the scope of pandemics. Cancellation or suspension of MGs would be critical to pandemic mitigation. It is unlikely that medical countermeasures are available during the early phase of pandemics. Therefore, mitigation of its impact, rather than containment and control becomes a priority during pandemics. As the most systematically studied MG-related respiratory disease data come from KSA, the cancellation of Umrah by the KSA authorities, prior to emergence of cases, provide the best opportunity to develop mathematical models to quantify event cancellations related mitigation of COVID-19 transmission in KSA and to the home countries of pilgrims.

All adult patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 were included in this retrospective cross-sectional study in two designated hospitals during 21 January 2020 to 16 March 2020 in Anhui, China. In all patients, data on the duration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding were analyzed by reviewing all RNA detection results during hospitalization. In addition, demographic, clinical, treatment, laboratory, and outcome data were also collected from electronic medical records. Factors associated with prolonged viral shedding were analyzed with the Cox proportional hazards model. Among 181 patients, the mean age was 44.3 ± 13.2 years, and 55.2% were male. The median duration of viral shedding from illness onset was 18.0 days (interquartile range [IQR], 15.0-24.0). Prolonged viral shedding was associated with longer hospital stays (P < .001) and higher medical costs (P < .001). The severity of COVID-19 had nothing to do with prolonged shedding. Moreover, the median time from onset to antiviral treatment initiation was 5.0 days (IQR, 3.0-7.0). Delayed antiviral treatment (hazard ratio [HR], 0.976; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.962-0.990]) and lopinavir/ritonavir + interferon-&#945; (IFN-&#945;) combination therapy as the initial antiviral treatment (HR 1.649; 95% CI, 1.162-2.339) were independent factors associated with prolonged SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding. SARS-CoV-2 showed prolonged viral shedding, causing increased hospital stays and medical costs.

In federated learning, since local data are collected by clients, it is hardly guaranteed that the data are correctly annotated. Although a lot of studies have been conducted to train the networks robust to these noisy data in a centralized setting, these algorithms still suffer from noisy labels in federated learning. Compared to the centralized setting, clients' data can have different noise distributions due to variations in their labeling systems or background knowledge of users. As a result, local models form inconsistent decision boundaries and their weights severely diverge from each other, which are serious problems in federated learning. To solve these problems, we introduce a novel federated learning scheme that the server cooperates with local models to maintain consistent decision boundaries by interchanging class-wise centroids. These centroids are central features of local data on each device, which are aligned by the server every communication round. Updating local models with the aligned centroids helps to form consistent decision boundaries among local models, although the noise distributions in clients' data are different from each other. To improve local model performance, we introduce a novel approach to select confident samples that are used for updating the model with given labels. Furthermore, we propose a global-guided pseudo-labeling method to update labels of unconfident samples by exploiting the global model. Our experimental results on the noisy CIFAR-10 dataset and the Clothing1M dataset show that our approach is noticeably effective in federated learning with noisy labels.","Yang, Seunghan; Park, Hyoungseob; Byun, Junyoung; Kim, Changick",,462,6

We hypothesized that engagement in these behaviors could provoke obsessions and phobias in vulnerable individuals in the community. METHODS: A total of 2117 participants, systematically selected to represent the age, gender, and race distributions of the US population, completed an online survey that assessed demographic characteristics, clinical features, COVID-19 risks, and COVID-19 contamination-prevention behaviors. Logistic regression was used to estimate the magnitude of the relationships between the COVID-19 behavior score and clinically significant contamination obsessions, contamination compulsions, and pre-COVID-19 to current change in obsessive-compulsive symptom scores. RESULTS: The COVID-19 behavior score was significantly associated with contamination obsessions (odds ratio (OR) = 1.15, 95% CI = 1.12-1.16; p < 0.001) and contamination phobias (OR = 1.14, 95% CI = 1.12-1.16; p < 0.001). The COVID-19 behavior score also was associated with pre-pandemic to current increase in the overall obsessive-compulsive symptom score (OR = 1.16, 95% CI = 1.09-1.23; p < 0.001), as well as increase in obsessive-compulsive symptom score excluding washing items (OR = 1.13, 95% CI = 1.07-1.19; p < 0.001). The magnitude of these relationships did not appreciably change, after adjustment for other variables associated with the outcomes. Moreover, the relationship was significant in those with or without OCD, and in individuals with different levels of doubt and COVID-19 risk. CONCLUSIONS: Contamination safety measures are critical for reducing the spread of COVID-19 in the community. However, they may be related to the development of contamination-related symptoms and OCD in vulnerable individuals, complicating the diagnosis and treatment of mental disorders during this period.","Samuels, Jack; Holingue, Calliope; Nestadt, Paul S; Bienvenu, O Joseph; Phan, Phillip; Nestadt, Gerald",J Psychiatr Res,462,16

However, little is known about the impact of COVID-19 on patients with diabetic nephropathy in comparison to patients with chronic kidney disease. METHODS: We used the Mexican Open Registry of COVID-19 patients 11 to analyze anonymized records of those who had symptoms related to COVID-19 to analyze the rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection, development of COVID-19 pneumonia, admission, intubation, Intensive Care Unit admission and mortality. Robust Poisson regression was used to relate sex and age to each of the six outcomes and find adjusted prevalences and adjusted prevalence ratios. Also, binomial regression models were performed for those outcomes that had significant results to generate probability plots to perform a fine analysis of the results obtained along age as a continuous variable. RESULTS: The adjusted prevalence analysis revealed that that there was a a 87.9% excess probability of developing COVID-19 pneumonia in patients with diabetic nephropathy, a 5% excess probability of being admitted, a 101.7% excess probability of intubation and a 20.8% excess probability of a fatal outcome due to COVID-19 pneumonia in comparison to CKD patients (p<0.01). Conclusions: Patients with diabetic nephropathy had nearly a twofold rate of COVID-19 pneumonia, a higher probability of admission, a twofold probability of intubation and a higher chance of death once admitted compared to patients with chronic kidney disease alone. Also, both diseases had higher COVID-19 pneumonia rates, intubation rates and case-fatality rates compared to the overall population.","Leon-Abarca, Juan Alonso; Memon, Roha Saeed; Rehan, Bahar; Iftikhar, Maimoona; Chatterjee, Antara",Acta Biomed,462,1

The analysis technique uses the Structural Equetion Model (SEM) with SmartPLS. The total sample is 95 heads of construction service companies in DKI Jakarta. Data were collected through distributing questionnaires. The results of the analysis show that transformational leadership in the construction service industry during the pandemic is at a high level. The results of testing the transformational leadership model show that each dimension is significant in composing transformational leadership. The four significant dimensions recommended are idealized influence, intellectual stimulation, individual consideration and inspirational motivation. Among the four dimensions, idealized influence and individual consideration are the dominant dimensions, this shows that during the Covid-19 pandemic, the influence of charismatic leadership role models became the main characteristics for companies that managed to survive, at the same time paying attention to each individual employee is indispensable.

This focus often overlooks rural and natural resource-based communities, particularly those dependent on renewable resources like fisheries or forestry. Drawing from a comprehensive review, we propose an alternative approach for interpreting and measuring SD in these contexts. We integrate two seemingly contradictory approaches: sustainability indicators (SIs), whose evolution reflects competing views of the nature of knowledge and action in pursuit of SD, and the use of storytelling in policy and planning, highlighting how actors tell stories to garner support for proposed developments, influence public understanding, and mobilize stakeholders. Examining the opposing epistemologies often underlying these two approaches, we posit that they can be brought together through a transdisciplinary lens for sustainable rural development. We illustrate these potentials in Newfoundland and Labrador, a highly resource-based region in which rural communities are often characterized by deficiencies based narratives. In such contexts, storytelling can allow rural stakeholders to interpret SD while potentially enlisting SIs in telling their own sustainability stories.","Lowery, Brennan; Dagevos, John; Chuenpagdee, Ratana; Vodden, Kelly",Sustainable Dev.,462,29

Although the debate about the medical and ethical problems of immunity passports has been widespread, there has been less inspection of the technical foundations of immunity passport schemes. These schemes are envisaged to be used for sharing COVID-19 test and vaccination results in general. The most prominent immunity passport schemes have involved a stack of little-known standards, such as Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and Verifiable Credentials (VCs) from the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). Our analysis shows that this group of technical identity standards are based on under-specified and often non-standardized documents that have substantial security and privacy issues, due in part to the questionable use of blockchain technology. One concrete proposal for immunity passports is even susceptible to dictionary attacks. The use of `cryptography theater' in efforts like immunity passports, where cryptography is used to allay the privacy concerns of users, should be discouraged in standardization. Deployment of these W3C standards for `self-sovereign identity' in use-cases like immunity passports could just as well lead to a dangerous form identity totalitarianism.","Halpin, Harry",,462,1

COVID-19 has many different clinical manifestations. One of them is arterial hypercoagulopathy. Although its mechanism is not fully explained, acute thrombosis and thromboembolism can be seen in patients. In this study, we present a case who was amputated due to the development of arterial thrombosis on the 10th day following infection with coronavirus, despite successful replantation after traumatic above-elbow amputation. After replantation on the seventh day, it was learned that the patient's husband was positive for COVID-19 and had come to visit the patient. For this reason, we performed reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to confirm the patient's COVID-19 status. We found that the patient, who was asymptomatic, was positive by RT-PCR for COVID-19. On the 10th day after the operation, it was observed that the blood circulation of the replanted extremity was impaired, although it had been perfect until that day. Emergency embolectomy and vascular reanastomosis were planned for the patient. Although we generally observe thrombosis at an end-to-end anastomosis site, massive axillary arterial thrombosis was detected at the proximal end of the vascular anastomosis. Upon development of tachycardia, hypotension, and metabolic acidosis after embolectomy and vascular reanastomosis, the decision was made to amputate the replanted limb to reduce the risk of life-threatening complications. To our knowledge, this is the first such COVID-19-related complication on upper extremity replantation in the literature.","Gunay, A. E.; Cavus, M.; Okur, K.

In this concepts paper, we argue that clinicians need to be agile in their thinking and practice in order to find the right time to change. Adoption of new methods should be based on clinical judgement, the weight of evidence and the balance of probabilities that any new technique, test or treatment might work.

This paper also analyzed the migration levels and diffusivity of the outer and inner cities of the GBA. Lastly, four evaluation indexes were selected to research the possibility of work resumption and the rating of epidemic prevention and control through kernel density estimation. According to the study, the amount of migration depends on the geographical proximity, relationship and economic development of the source region, and the severity of the epidemic depends mainly on the migration volume and the severity of the epidemic in the source region. The epidemic risk is related not only to the severity of the epidemic in the source region but also to the degree of urban traffic development and the degree of urban openness. After the resumption of work, the pressure of epidemic prevention and control has been concentrated mainly in Shenzhen and Canton; the further away a region is from the core cities, the lower the pressure in that region. The mass migration of the population makes it difficult to control the epidemic effectively. The study of the relationship between migration volume, epidemic severity and epidemic risk is helpful to further analyze transmission types and predict the trends of the epidemic.","Wang, Fangxiong; Tan, Ziqian; Yu, Zaihui; Yao, Siqi; Guo, Changfeng",PLoS One,462,2

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, most of these activities have been cancelled. A limited range of web-based activities have been offered as alternatives. However, the effectiveness of these web-based group activities for older adults has scarcely been researched. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to understand the extent to which web-based activities for older adults provide an adequate substitute for in-person activities. METHODS: In this telephone survey, we interviewed 105 older adults in Israel who had been offered the opportunity to participate in web-based activities after routine activities closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Of the total sample, 49/105 (46.7%) participated in the activities and 56/105 (53.3%) did not. We inquired about the respondents' background characteristics, satisfaction with the activities, and reasons for participation or nonparticipation. RESULTS: The respondents who participated in the web-based activities tended to be highly satisfied with at least some of them. They rated the enjoyment derived from the content of the activity as the most important motivator, followed by maintaining a routine and by enjoying the group and the presence of others. Over 50% of the participants (28/49, 57%) wished to continue with the exercise programming after the end of the COVID-19 pandemic, and 41% (20/49) wished to continue with the web-based lectures. Participants were more likely to report partaking in alternative activities than nonparticipants (P=.04). The most common reasons cited by nonparticipants were being unaware of the web-based program (24/56, 43%) despite a notification having been sent to the entire sample, lack of interest in the content (18/56, 32%), and technical issues (13/56, 23%), such as not owning or being able to fully use a computer. Both participants and nonparticipants were interested in a wide range of topics, with many being very particular about the topics they wished to access. Approximately half expressed willingness to pay for access; those who were willing to pay tended to have more years of education (P=.03). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest a need for web-based activities for countering boredom and feelings of isolation. The main factors that influence the use, efficacy, and sustainability of online activities are access, motivational and need-fulfilling factors, and whether the activities are sufficiently tailored to individuals' preferences and abilities. Challenges in substituting in-person services are promoting social relationships that are currently not sufficiently incorporated into most web-based programs, accommodating a wider range of topics, and increasing the accessibility of current programs to older adults, especially those who are homebound, both during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.","Cohen-Mansfield, Jiska; Muff, Aline; Meschiany, Guy; Lev-Ari, Shahar",J Med Internet Res,462,22

Thus, we performed a meta-analysis of published liver manifestations and described the liver damage in patients with COVID-19 who died or discharged alive. Approach & Results: We searched PubMed, Google Scholar, medRxiv, bioRxiv, the Cochrane Library, Embase, and three Chinese electronic databases through April 22, 2020. We analyzed pooled data on liver chemistries stratified by the main clinical outcome of COVID-19, using a fixed or random-effects model. In our meta-analysis of 19 studies, which included a total of 4,103 patients, the pooled mean alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase levels were respectively 31.7 and 51.0 IU/L in the patients with COVID-19 who died and 27.7 and 32.9 IU/L in those discharged alive (both p < 0.0001). Compared with the patients discharged alive, those who died tended to have lower albumin levels but longer prothrombin time and higher international standardized ratio. Conclusions: In this meta-analysis, according to the main clinical outcome of COVID-19, we comprehensively described three patterns of liver impairment related to COVID-19, hepatocellular injury, cholestasis, and hepatocellular disfunction. The patients who died from COVID-19 tended to have different liver chemistries from those discharged alive. Special caution should be given to the patients with relatively higher index of liver chemistries.","Xing, Qing-Qing; Dong, Xuan; Ren, Yan-Dan; Chen, Wei-Ming; Zeng, Dan-Yi; Cai, Yan-Yan; Hong, Mei-Zhu; Pan, Jin-Shui",,462,26

The virus responsible for COVID-9, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), has a spike glycoprotein (S protein) that binds angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) present on host cell membranes to gain entry. Based on the full-length human ACE2 cryo-EM structure, we generated homology models of full-length ACE2 proteins from various species (gorilla, monkey, pig, bovine, sheep, cat, dog, mouse, and rat). Although these ACE2 molecules were found to share similar overall structures, their S-ACE2 interface residues differed. These differences likely result in variations in the ACE2 binding affinities to the SARS-CoV-2 S protein. The highest affinities are predicted for human, gorilla, and monkey, while mouse and rat ACE2 are predicted to have the lowest affinities. Cat ACE2 is predicted to have a lower S protein affinity than dog ACE2. Although affinity is not the only factor that affects viral susceptibility, it is one of the most important factors. Thus, we believe that care should be taken with these animals to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2 among animal and human populations.","Ma, Cheng; Gong, Caixia",J Med Virol,462,9

SARS­CoV­2 is responsible for the worldwide pandemic which has been taking place in 2020, and is causing a markedly higher number of infections and deaths compared to previous coronaviruses, such as SARS­CoV or MERS­CoV. Based on updated scientific literature, the present review compiles the most relevant knowledge of SARS­CoV­2, COVID­19 and the clinical and typical responses that patients have exhibited against this virus, discussing current and future therapies, and proposing strategies with which to combat the disease and prevent a further global threat. The aggressiveness of SARS­CoV­2 arises from its capacity to infect, and spread easily and rapidly through its tight interaction with the human angiotensin­converting enzyme 2 (ACE­2) receptor. While not all patients respond in a similar manner and may even be asymptomatic, a wide range of manifestations associated with COVID­19 have been described, particularly in vulnerable population groups, such as the elderly or individuals with other underlying conditions. The proper function of the immune system plays a key role in an individual's favorable response to SARS­CoV­2 infection. A hyperactivated response, on the contrary, could account for the more severe cases of COVID­19, and this may finally lead to respiratory insufficiency and other complications, such as thrombotic or thromboembolic events. The development of novel therapies and vaccines designed to control and regulate a proper immune system response will be key to clinical management, prevention measures and effective population screening to attenuate the transmission of this novel RNA virus.","Ortega, Miguel A; Fraile-Martínez, Oscar; García-Montero, Cielo; García-Gallego, Sandra; Sánchez-Trujillo, Lara; Torres-Carranza, Diego; Álvarez-Mon, Miguel Ángel; Pekarek, Leonel; García-Honduvilla, Natalio; Bujan, Julia; Álvarez-Mon, Melchor; Asúnsolo, Ángel; De la Torre, Basilio",Int J Mol Med,462,0

Hantaan virus is second to the COVID-19 outbreak in China with seven cases positive and one death. Both RNA viruses have opposite sense as in (-) for Hantaan virus and (+) for SARS CoV2 but have similarity in the pathogenesis and relevant clinical features including dry cough, high fever, shortness of breath, and SARS associated with pneumonia and certain reported cases with multiple organ failure. Although COVID-19 has global impact with high death toll, Hantaan virus has varyingly high mortality rate between 1% and 40%. Hence, there is a need to explore novel therapeutic targets in Hantaan virus due to its rapid evolution rate in its genetic makeup which governs virulence and target host cells. This review emphasizes the importance of structural and nonstructural proteins of Hantaan virus with relevant insight from SARS CoV2. The envelope glycoproteins such as Gn, Gc, and nucleocapsid protein (N) direct the viral assembly and replication in host cells. Therapeutic treatment has similarity in using ribavirin and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation but lack of efficacious treatment in both cases of SARAS CoV2 and Hantaan virus. Therefore, potential features regarding therapeutic targets for drug discovery for Hantaan viruses are discussed herewith.

Hemato-oncological patients are particularly vulnerable to infection, requiring decisive recommendations on treatment and triage. The aim of this survey amongst experts on radiation therapy (RT) for lymphoma and leukemia is to delineate typical clinical scenarios and to provide counsel for high-quality care. METHODS: A multi-item questionnaire containing multiple-choice and free-text questions was developed in a peer-reviewed process and sent to members of the radiation oncology panels of the German Hodgkin Study Group and the German Lymphoma Alliance. Answers were assessed online and analyzed centrally. RESULTS: Omission of RT was only considered in a minority of cases if alternative treatment options were available. Hypofractionated regimens and reduced dosages may be used for indolent lymphoma and fractures due to multiple myeloma. Overall, there was a tendency to shorten RT rather than to postpone or omit it. Even in case of critical resource shortage, panelists agreed to start emergency RT for typical indications (intracranial pressure, spinal compression, superior vena cava syndrome) within 24â¯h. Possible criteria to consider for patient triage are the availability of (systemic) options, the underlying disease dynamic, and the treatment rationale (curative/palliative). CONCLUSION: RT for hemato-oncological patients receives high-priority and should be maintained even in later stages of the pandemic.

A few clinically approved drugs, such as remdesivir, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, nafamostat, camostat, and ivermectin, exhibited anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity in vitro and/or in a small number of patients. However, their clinical use may be limited by anti-SARS-CoV-2 50 % maximal effective concentrations (EC50) that exceeded their achievable peak serum concentrations (Cmax), side effects, and/or availability. To find more immediately available COVID-19 antivirals, we established a two-tier drug screening system that combines SARS-CoV-2 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and cell viability assay, and applied it to screen a library consisting 1528 FDA-approved drugs. Cetilistat (anti-pancreatic lipase), diiodohydroxyquinoline (anti-parasitic), abiraterone acetate (synthetic androstane steroid), and bexarotene (antineoplastic retinoid) exhibited potent in vitro anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity (EC50 1.13-2.01 µM). Bexarotene demonstrated the highest Cmax:EC50 ratio (1.69) which was higher than those of chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, and ivermectin. These results demonstrated the efficacy of the two-tier screening system and identified potential COVID-19 treatments which can achieve effective levels if given by inhalation or systemically depending on their pharmacokinetics.","Yuan, Shuofeng; Chan, Jasper F W; Chik, Kenn K H; Chan, Chris C Y; Tsang, Jessica O L; Liang, Ronghui; Cao, Jianli; Tang, Kaiming; Chen, Lin-Lei; Wen, Kun; Cai, Jian-Piao; Ye, Zi-Wei; Lu, Gang; Chu, Hin; Jin, Dong-Yan; Yuen, Kwok-Yung",Pharmacol Res,462,26

Methods: An email survey combining short and open-ended questions was distributed to all 40 Korean school deans in May 2020. Thirty-seven deans out of 40 medical schools in Korea (92.5%) participated. Results: Most lectures moved online but students’ assessments were delayed and later held onsite. Clinical rotations continued except for an average of 3-week suspension during the first COVID-19 wave. The deans’ remarks on the positive influences far outweighed the negative impact of COVID-19 on medical education. Although technological adaptations caused initial hardship, the experience gained through the use of various online learning systems led to attitudinal changes on the importance of adopting new technology and a tailored and student centric curriculum in medical education. Conclusion: The deans’ perspective changes has shown the possibility of the deans’ generation aligning more closely with the current Generation Z medical students. They projected further innovations in teaching and learning methods, especially applying flipped learning and highlighted the need to invest in faculty development so medical educators can be equipped and competent in diverse ICT (information and communications technology) learning platforms. Also, the need for advance preparations in medical education for future similar public health crises were stressed. Unprecedented changes brought by COVID-19 positively impacted Korean medical education in parts and the Korean deans envisioned further innovations using the experiences gained during this crisis.

Especially during the COVID-19 coronavirus epidemic, wearing a mask has become an effective means of preventing the virus spread. Traditional CNN-based face recognition models trained on existing datasets are almost ineffective for heavy occlusion. To this end, we pioneer a simulated occlusion face recognition dataset. In particular, we first collect a variety of glasses and masks as occlusion, and randomly combine the occlusion attributes (occlusion objects, textures,and colors) to achieve a large number of more realistic occlusion types. We then cover them in the proper position of the face image with the normal occlusion habit. Furthermore, we reasonably combine original normal face images and occluded face images to form our final dataset, termed as Webface-OCC. It covers 804,704 face images of 10,575 subjects, with diverse occlusion types to ensure its diversity and stability. Extensive experiments on public datasets show that the ArcFace retrained by our dataset significantly outperforms the state-of-the-arts.

To date whey protein derived mouthdrying has not been quantified using a 'physical measure' in parallel with rated perception. Saliva flow could also relate to whey protein derived mouthdrying, however this has not been previously tested as an intervention. Accordingly, volunteers (n = 40) tested mouthdrying in different whey beverages and the sensory profile was evaluated by a trained sensory panel (n = 10). Volunteers also rated mouthdrying combined with collection of saliva samples post beverage consumption to measure retention to the oral cavity. To modulate saliva flow rate, volunteers both chewed on parafilm (to increase saliva flow) and used cotton wool (to remove saliva) before tasting beverages and rating mouthdrying. Both the volunteers and sensory panel rated whey protein beverages (WPB) as significantly more mouthdrying than the control beverage (whey permeate). The significantly higher rating of mouthdrying from the volunteers coincided with significantly higher protein concentration in saliva samples post WPB consumption, supporting mucoadhesion as the mechanism. Modulating saliva flow did not lead to any difference in rated mouthdrying and future work would be beneficial to evaluate further the influence of natural variation in salivary flow rate.","Norton, Victoria; Lignou, Stella; Methven, Lisa",,462,29

To manage the problems, many research in a variety of area of science have started studying the issue. Artificial Intelligence is among the area of science that has found great applications in tackling the problem in many aspects. Here, we perform an overview on the applications of AI in a variety of fields including diagnosis of the disease via different types of tests and symptoms, monitoring patients, identifying severity of a patient, processing covid-19 related imaging tests, epidemiology, pharmaceutical studies, etc. The aim of this paper is to perform a comprehensive survey on the applications of AI in battling against the difficulties the outbreak has caused. Thus we cover every way that AI approaches have been employed and to cover all the research until the writing of this paper. We try organize the works in a way that overall picture is comprehensible.

Faced with the consequences of inaction, most national governments responded with policies that restricted the activities conducted by their inhabitants. As schools and businesses shuttered, the mobility of these people decreased. This reduction in mobility, and related activities, was recorded through ubiquitous location-enabled personal mobile devices. Patterns emerged that varied by place-based activity. In this work the differences in these place-based activity patterns are investigated across nations, specifically focusing on the relationship between government enacted policies and changes in community activity patterns. We show that people's activity response to government action varies widely both across nations as well as regionally within them. Three assessment measures are devised and the results correlate with a number of global indices.

The negative consequences have been highlighted in the decrease of the GPD level for regions, countries and even continents. Returning to pre-pandemic levels is a considerable effort for both economic and political decision-makers. This article deals with the construction of a mathematical model for economic aspects in the context of variable productivity in time. Through this mathematical model, we propose to maximize revenues in pandemic conditions, in order to limit the economic consequences of the lockdown. One advantage of the proposed model consists in the fact that it is based on units that can be regions, economic branches, economic units or fields of investment. Another strength of the model is determined by the fact that it offers the possibility to choose between two different investment strategies, based on the specific options of the decision makers: the consistent increase of the state revenues or the amelioration of the disparity phenomenon. Furthermore, our model extends previous approaches from the literature by adding some generalization options and the proposed model can be applied in lockdown cases and seasonal situations.","Tonnoir, Antoine Ciotir Ioana Adrian-Liviu Scutariu Dospinescu Octavian",Mathematics,462,26

Of these nucleotide substitutions 58, 94, and 37 were nonsynonymous types mostly present in the Nsp2, Nsp3, Spike, and ORF9. A continent-specific phylogram analyses clustered the SARS-CoV-2 in the different group based on the frequency of nucleotide substitutions. Detailed analyses about the continent-specific amino acid changes and their effectiveness by SNAP2 software was investigated. We found 11 common nonsynonymous mutations; among them, two novel effective mutations were identified in ORF9 (S194L and S202N). Intriguingly, ORF9 encodes nucleocapsid phosphoprotein possessing many effective mutations across continents and could be a potential candidate after the spike protein for studying the role of mutation in viral assembly and pathogenesis. Among the two forms of certain frequent mutation, one form is more prevalent in Europe continents (Nsp12:L314, Nsp13:P504, Nsp13:Y541, Spike:G614, and ORF8:L84) while other forms are more prevalent in American (Nsp12:P314, Nsp13:L504, Nsp13:C541, Spike:D614, and ORF8:L84) and Asian continents (Spike:D614), indicating the spatial and temporal dynamics of SARS-CoV-2. We identified highly conserved 38 regions and among these regions, 11 siRNAs were predicted on stringent criteria that can be used to suppress the expression of viral genes and the corresponding reduction of human viral infections. The present investigation provides information on different mutations and will pave the way for differentiating strains based on virulence and their use in the development of better antiviral therapy.","Mishra, Divya; Suri, Gurparsad Singh; Kaur, Gurleen; Tiwari, Manish",J Med Virol,462,20

The regionally-based Italian National Health System has been reorganized. Hospitals' biggest challenge was to create new intensive care unit (ICU) beds, as the existing system was insufficient to meet new demand, especially in the most affected areas. Our institution in the Milan metropolitan area of Lombardy, the epicentre of the infection, was selected as one of the three regional hub for major trauma, serving a population of more than three million people. The aims were the increase the ICU beds and the rationalization of human and structural resources available for treating COVID-19 patients. In our hub hospital, the reorganization aimed to reduce the risk of infection and to obtained resources, in terms of beds and healthcare personnel to be use in the COVID-19 emergency. Non-urgent outpatient orthopaedic activity and elective surgery was also suspended. A training programme for healthcare personnel started immediately. Orthopaedic and radiological pathways dedicated to COVID-19 patients, or with possible infection, have been established. In our orthopaedic department, we passed from 70 to 26 beds. Our goal is to treat trauma surgery's patient in the ""golden 72 hours"" in order to reduce the overall hospital length of stay. We applied an objective priority system to manage the flow of surgical procedures in the emergency room based on clinical outcomes and guidelines.

The false-negative nasopharyngeal swabs for SARS-CoV-2 caused delayed diagnosis of COVID-19, which hindered the prevention and control of the pandemic. The transmission risk of SARS-CoV-2 in negative nasopharyngeal swabs cases has rarely been addressed previously. This study evaluated two clusters of COVID-19 in six patients, four of whom (66.7%) tested negative for RNA of SARS-CoV-2 on RT-PCR of nasopharyngeal swabs. All epidemiological, clinical, and laboratory data were collected. The first cluster was a nosocomial infection of four health care providers in early January. One case resulted in a sequential familial cluster of infection. All patients either self-quarantined at home or were admitted to hospital for isolated treatment. All recovered and were anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG- and/or IgM-positive (100%) for serological detection of SARS-CoV-2 at the recovery stage. Our study provides a cautionary warning that negative results for nasopharyngeal swabs of suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection can increase the risk of nosocomial infection among health care providers.

The risk for developing a damage in respiratory epithelium and recurrent respiratory infections may vary among individuals. Preventive measures are based on strengthening the immune function, thus increasing the natural response to pathogens. Immunomodulatory agents are: i. synthetic molecules; ii. Probiotics, prebiotics, symbiotics; iii. Lysates, bacterial extracts immunomodulators: OM-85, RU 41740, D53; iv. Trace elements, vitamins. OM-85 is used for the prevention of recurrent respiratory tract infections and/or exacerbations both in adults and children, showing a good efficacy and safety profile. Its active principle, an extract of bacterial lysates isolated from 21 known respiratory pathogenic strains, shows protection against airway infections of bacterial and viral origin. AREAS COVERED: This non-systematic review focuses on bacterial lysates and in particular on OM-85 and its effects on respiratory epithelium function and activity in asthma respiratory infections. Studies were selected by PubMed search of ""bacterial lysate"" or ""OM-85"" and ""respiratory epithelium"" or ""respiratory infections"", from 1993 to 2019.

However, some develop prolonged symptoms. We sought to characterize the spectrum of neurologic manifestations in non-hospitalized Covid-19 ""long haulers"". METHODS: This is a prospective study of the first 100 consecutive patients (50 SARS-CoV-2 laboratory-positive (SARS-CoV-2+ ) and 50 laboratory-negative (SARS-CoV-2- ) individuals) presenting to our Neuro-Covid-19 clinic between May and November 2020. Due to early pandemic testing limitations, patients were included if they met Infectious Diseases Society of America symptoms of Covid-19, were never hospitalized for pneumonia or hypoxemia, and had neurologic symptoms lasting over 6 weeks. We recorded the frequency of neurologic symptoms and analyzed patient-reported quality of life measures and standardized cognitive assessments. RESULTS: Mean age was 43.2 ± 11.3 years, 70% were female, and 48% were evaluated in televisits. The most frequent comorbidities were depression/anxiety (42%) and autoimmune disease (16%). The main neurologic manifestations were: ""brain fog"" (81%), headache (68%), numbness/tingling (60%), dysgeusia (59%), anosmia (55%), and myalgias (55%), with only anosmia being more frequent in SARS-CoV-2+ than SARS-CoV-2- patients (37/50 [74%] vs. 18/50 [36%]; p < 0.001). Moreover, 85% also experienced fatigue. There was no correlation between time from disease onset and subjective impression of recovery. Both groups exhibited impaired quality of life in cognitive and fatigue domains.

Their immune response after infection is unclear. We have found high seroconversion rates in this population with 95% developing antibodies. It is unclear if and how long these antibodies persist. Here we investigate this with serial antibody testing. METHODS: We identified haemodialysis patients who had confirmed SARS-CoV-2 between March-May 2020 and measured monthly antibodies (IgG/IgM) in those who survived. We used a semi-quantitative cut-off index (COI) to create a qualitative result and plotted optical density (OD) over time. We used linear regression to examine the slope, as well as noting peak OD and time to peak OD. We correlated these against baseline demographics, markers of illness severity, and comorbidities. RESULTS: 122 patients were analysed. All remained antibody positive during follow-up; for a minimum of 148 days. 71% had a positive gradient indicating increasing antibody positivity over time. We found that age (p = 0.01), duration of PCR positivity (p = 0.06) and presence of symptoms (p = 0.05) were associated with a longer time to peak OD. Immunosuppression did not alter peak OD but did lead to a non-significant increase in time to peak OD and more patients had a subsequent fall in Ab levels (p = 0.02). Diabetic patients were more likely to have a positive slope (OR 2.26).

In this study, a prototype of a cost-effective sterilization box is developed to disinfect small items. The box utilizes ultra violet (UV) radiation with heat. For performance assessment, two studies were performed. First, IgG (glycoprotein, a model protein similar to that of spike glycoprotein of SARS-COV-2) was incubated under UV and heat sterilization. An incubation with UV at 70 °C for 15 min was found to be effective in unfolding and aggregation of the protein. At optimized condition, the hydrodynamic size of the protein increased to ~171 nm from ~5 nm of the native protein. Similarly, the OD280 values also increased from 0.17 to 0.78 indicating the exposure of more aromatic moieties and unfolding of the protein. The unfolding and aggregation of the protein were further confirmed by the intrinsic fluorescence measurement and FTIR studies, showing a 70% increase in the ß-sheets and a 22% decrease in the &#945;-helixes of the protein. The designed box was effective in damaging the protein's native structure indicating the effective inactivation of the SARS-COV-2. Furthermore, the incubation at 70 °C for 15 min inside the chamber resulted in 100% antibacterial efficacy for the clinically relevant E.coli bacteria as well as for bacteria collected from daily use items. It is the first detailed performance study on the efficacy of using UV irradiation and heat together for disinfection from virus and bacteria.","Mahanta, Nilkamal; Saxena, Varun; Pandey, Lalit M; Batra, Priyanka; Dixit, U S",Environ Res,462,13

SARS-CoV (2003) induces Cox-2, catalyzing the synthesis, from highly unsaturated fatty acids (HUFA), of eicosanoids and docosanoids that mediate both inflammation and thrombosis. HUFA balance between arachidonic acid (AA) and other HUFA is a likely determinant of net signaling to induce a healthy or runaway physiological response. AA levels are determined by a non-protein coding regulatory polymorphisms that mostly affect the expression of FADS1, located in the FADS gene cluster on chromosome 11. Major and minor haplotypes in Europeans, and a specific functional insertion-deletion (Indel), rs66698963, consistently show major differences in circulating AA (>50%) and in the balance between AA and other HUFA (47-84%) in free living humans; the indel is evolutionarily selective, probably based on diet. The pattern of fatty acid responses is fully consistent with specific genetic modulation of desaturation at the FADS1-mediated 20:3â20:4 step. Well established principles of net tissue HUFA levels indicate that the high linoleic acid and low alpha-linoleic acid in populations drive the net balance of HUFA for any individual. We predict that fast desaturators (insertion allele at rs66698963; major haplotype in Europeans) are predisposed to higher risk and pathological responses to SARS-CoV-2 could be reduced with high dose omega-3 HUFA.","Kothapalli, Kumar S D; Park, Hui Gyu; Brenna, J Thomas",Prostaglandins Leukot Essent Fatty Acids,462,1

Using a multinational convenience sample from four LMICs (DR Congo, Haiti, Rwanda, and Togo), this study aims to explore the prevalence of anxiety symptoms and associated risk and protective factors during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A total of 1267 individuals (40.8% of women) completed a questionnaire assessing exposure and stigmatization related to COVID-19, anxiety, and resilience. Analyses were performed to examine the prevalence and predictors of anxiety. RESULTS: Findings showed a pooled prevalence of 24.3% (9.4%, 29.2%, 28.5%, and 16.5% respectively for Togo, Haiti, RDC, and Rwanda, x2 = 32.6, p < .0001). For the pooled data, exposure to COVID-19 (ß = 0.06, p = .005), stigmatization related to COVID-19 (ß = 0.03, p < .001), and resilience (ß = -0.06, p < .001) contributed to the prediction of anxiety scores. Stigmatization related to COVID-19 was significantly associated to anxiety symptoms in all countries (ß = 0.02, p < .00; ß = 0.05, p = .013; ß = 0.03, p = .021; ß = 0.04, p < .001, respectively for the RDC, Rwanda, Haiti, and Togo). CONCLUSIONS: The findings highlight the need for health education programs in LMICs to decrease stigmatization and the related fears and anxieties, and increase observance of health instructions. Strength-based mental health programs based on cultural and contextual factors need to be developed to reinforce both individual and community resilience and to address the complexities of local eco-systems.","Cénat, Jude Mary; Dalexis, Rose Darly; Guerrier, Mireille; Noorishad, Pari-Gole; Derivois, Daniel; Bukaka, Jacqueline; Birangui, Jean-Pierre; Adansikou, Kouami; Clorméus, Lewis Ampidu; Kokou-Kpolou, Cyrille Kossigan; Ndengeyingoma, Assumpta; Sezibera, Vincent; Auguste, Ralph Emmanuel; Rousseau, Cécile",J Psychiatr Res,462,20

At this time, though there are guidelines and recommendations for medical management of these patients, there is a lack of guidance on how a plastic surgeon should approach the COVID-19 suspect or infected patient who presents either in an elective or emergency setting. We aim to provide a consensus guideline based on the current recommendations of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and the pooled experience of the major centers performing plastic and reconstructive surgery in India. METHODS: The current guidelines and recommendations on the COVID-19 pandemic were studied from both government and nongovernment sources including ICMR. The problems in the specialty of plastic surgery were categorized into four groups and for each group, separate and individual guidelines have been formulated. GUIDELINES: Consensus guidelines have been formulated for the specialty of Plastic and Reconstructive surgery. The patients requiring plastic surgery service have been categorized into four groups of acute, subacute, chronic, and late category. Acute cases are the ones who require intervention within 24-48â¯h. Subacute cases are the ones who require intervention in the next 3-10 days, while the chronic are the ones who need plastic surgery preferably within a month. The late category are the ones who need surgery within the next six months. This has been done based on the urgency and priority of surgical intervention titrated against the risks of operating and inadvertently acquiring the exposure of COVID-19-positive patients. CONCLUSION: Currently, in the wake of COVID-19 pandemic, there are no clear guidelines specific to the vast majority of patients who come for a plastic surgery intervention. This puts the patients at risk due to the impending plastic surgery problem while at the same time it poses a risk of exposure to COVID-19 for the surgical team. Consensus guidelines are presented, to steer the plastic surgeon in his work, in the wake of COVID-19 crisis. The guidelines are based on firm scientific evidence from the reputed research and regulatory bodies and have been made in consonance with plastic surgery experts around the country, so that these practices best suit the needs of the patients, while being mindful of resource limitations and infection risks. The approach of ""delayed conservative treatment"" works best in the present case scenario.","Agarwal, Rajiv; Singhal, Maneesh; Shankhdhar, Vinay Kant; Chittoria, Ravi Kumar; Sahu, Ranjit Kumar; Singh, Veena; Chandra, Ramesh",J. plast. reconstr. aesthet. surg,462,24

The disproportionate impact of COVID-19 on racial/ethnic minority and socially disadvantaged populations underscores the need to anticipate and address social inequalities and health disparities in AI development and application. Before the pandemic, there was growing optimism about AI's role in addressing inequities and enhancing personalized care. Unfortunately, ethical and social issues that are encountered in scaling, developing, and applying advanced technologies in health care settings have intensified during the rapidly evolving public health crisis. Critical voices concerned with the disruptive potentials and risk for engineered inequities have called for reexamining ethical guidelines in the development and application of AI. This paper proposes a framework to incorporate ethical AI principles into the development process in ways that intentionally promote racial health equity and social justice. Without centering on equity, justice, and ethical AI, these tools may exacerbate structural inequities that can lead to disparate health outcomes.","Dankwa-Mullan, Irene Elisabeth Lee Scheufele Matheny Michael E.; Quintana, Yuri Chapman Wendy W.; Jackson, Gretchen South Brett R.",Journal of Health Care for the Poor and Underserved,462,24

Our study aims to evaluate air pollution changes, with focus on nitrogen dioxide (NO2), before and during the lockdown in Rome and in the surroundings. Significant NO2 declines were observed during the COVID-19 pandemic with reductions of - 50%, - 34%, and - 20% at urban traffic, urban background, and rural background stations, respectively. Tropospheric NO2 vertical column density (VCD) from the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) was used to evaluate the spatial-temporal variations of the NO2 before and during the lockdown for the entire area where the surface stations are located. The evaluation is concerned with the pixels including one or more air quality stations to explore the capability of the unprecedented high spatial resolution to monitor urban and rural sites from space with relation to the surface measurements. Good agreement between surface concentration and TROPOMI VCD was obtained in Rome (R = 0.64 in 2019, R = 0.77 in 2020) and in rural sites (R = 0.71 in 2019). Inversely, a slight correlation (R = 0.20) was observed in rural areas during the lockdown due to very low levels of NO2. Finally, the TROPOMI VCD showed a sharp decline in NO2, larger in urban (- 43%) than in rural sites (- 17%) as retrieved with the concurrent surface measurements averaging all the traffic and urban background (- 44%) and all the rural background stations (- 20%). These results suggest air pollution improvement in Rome gained from implementing lockdown restrictions.","Bassani, Cristiana; Vichi, Francesca; Esposito, Giulio; Montagnoli, Mauro; Giusto, Marco; Ianniello, Antonietta",,462,1

Primary health care providers, which include those working in primary care and public health roles, have critical responsibilities in the management of health emergencies. OBJECTIVE: To synthesize accounts of primary care lessons learnt from past epidemics and their relevance to COVID-19. METHODS: We conducted a review of lessons learnt from previous infectious disease epidemics for primary care, and their relevance to COVID-19. We searched PubMed/MEDLINE, PROQUEST and Google Scholar, hand-searched reference lists of included studies, and included research identified through professional contacts. RESULTS: Of 173 publications identified, 31 publications describing experiences of four epidemics in 11 countries were included. Synthesis of findings identified six key lessons: (i) improve collaboration, communication and integration between public health and primary care; (ii) strengthen the primary health care system; (iii) provide consistent, coordinated and reliable information emanating from a trusted source; (iv) define the role of primary care during pandemics; (v) protect the primary care workforce and the community and (vi) evaluate the effectiveness of interventions. CONCLUSIONS: Evidence highlights distinct challenges to integrating and supporting primary care in response to infectious disease epidemics that have persisted over time, emerging again during COVID-19.

This study aimed to determine the prevalence of postpartum depression and its predictors among postnatal women in Lagos. Methods: A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted among 250 mothers in Eti-Osa Local Government Area of Lagos State, Nigeria, attending six Primary Health Care centers for infant immunization at six weeks post-delivery. Data was collected using a pretested semi-structured interviewer administered questionnaire which included the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale. Analysis was carried out using SPSS version 23TM. Chi-square and logistic regression analyses were used to determine associations and predictive relationships between various factors and the presence of postpartum depression. The level of significance was set at <0.05. Results: The prevalence of postpartum depression was 35.6%. Multiparity, delivery by cesarean section, mother being unwell after delivery, and not exclusively breastfeeding the baby were the factors linked with postpartum depression. Following multiple logistic regression, having postpartum blues (p=0.000; OR=32.77; 95%CI=7.23-148.58)., not getting help with caring for the baby (p=0.008; OR=2.64; 95%CI=1.29-5.42), experiencing intimate partner violence (p=0.000; OR=5.2; 95%CI=2.23-11.91) and having an unsupportive partner (p=0.018; OR=2.6; 95%CI=1.17-5.78) were identified as predictors of postpartum depression. Conclusion: This study revealed a high prevalence of postpartum depression, identifying both the obstetric and psychosocial predictors. Social support for women both in the pre- and postnatal periods and routine screening of women for postpartum depression should be encouraged for early detection and immediate intervention.","Adeyemo, E O; Oluwole, E O; Kanma-Okafor, O J; Izuka, O M; Odeyemi, K A",Afr Health Sci,462,16

However, real-world use of colonoscopy in older populations is rarely evaluated using Korean databases. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective, observational cohort study of individuals aged over 20 years between 2012 and 2017. We used the Health Insurance Review and Assessment-National Patient Samples database, previously converted to the standardized Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership-Common Data Model. The use of diagnostic colonoscopy and colonoscopic polypectomy was evaluated, stratified by age group and sex. RESULTS: During the study period, we captured data from the database on 240,406 patients who underwent diagnostic colonoscopy and 88,984 who underwent colonoscopic polypectomy. During the study period, use of diagnostic colonoscopy and colonoscopic polypectomy steadily increased, but both procedures were most significantly increased in the 65- to 85-year group compared to other age groups (p < 0.05). Average ages for both procedures significantly increased in the most recent 3 years (p < 0.05). Polypectomy rates for men plateaued in the 50- to 64-year age group, but rates for women steadily increased up to the 65- to 85-year group. Polypectomy rates were higher for men than for women in all index years. CONCLUSIONS: The use of diagnostic colonoscopy and colonoscopic polypectomy significantly increased in the 65- to 85-year age group. Our findings suggest that more available colonoscopy resources should be allocated to older populations, considering the aging society in Asian countries.","Kim, Ha Il; Yoon, Jin Young; Kwak, Min Seob; Cha, Jae Myung",Dig. dis. sci,462,12

However, social workers in Nigeria, appear not to be aware of the roles they can play. The question then arises as to the adequacy of their training curriculum that probably made them not be aware of their roles. Eight social workers who work in health and welfare agencies were purposively selected and interviewed by telephone. Findings show that they were not aware of the role expected of them during the pandemic. Some noted that their training was somewhat deficient hence the need to introduce some courses and also enhance field practicum in future training of social workers. The study recommends the need for social work educators to be more proactive in their interpretation of courses, the need to revise the current curriculum for training social workers in Nigeria to make it more action-oriented as well as incorporate more courses in public health and disaster management.","Onalu, Chinyere Edith; Chukwu, Ngozi Eucharia; Okoye, Uzoma Odera",Soc.

For example, in military sensor networks, users will want to detect when one or more of the sensors has been compromised, and critically, they will want to know which specific sensors might be compromised. Thus, we first define a formalization of this problem as multiple conditional distribution hypothesis tests and propose both non-parametric and parametric statistical tests. For both efficiency and flexibility, we then propose to use a test statistic based on the density model score function (i.e. gradient with respect to the input) -- which can easily compute test statistics for all dimensions in a single forward and backward pass. Any density model could be used for computing the necessary statistics including deep density models such as normalizing flows or autoregressive models. We additionally develop methods for identifying when and where a shift occurs in multivariate time-series data and show results for multiple scenarios using realistic attack models on both simulated and real world data.","Kulinski, Sean; Bagchi, Saurabh; Inouye, David I.",,462,16

Advantages include increasing accessibility, potential to reduce costs and, during the COVID-19 pandemic, reduced risk of infection transmission. Here, we systematically collate and synthesise the evidence base on outcomes from remote consultation in adult and paediatric ENT services. METHODS: We performed a review in accordance with PRISMA guidelines. We searched Medline and Embase for relevant articles. Outcomes include specific patient pathway efficiency measures (including number of healthcare visits, lead time, touch time and handoff), patient/clinician satisfaction, cost analysis and safety implications. RESULTS: From 6325 articles screened, 53 met inclusion criteria. Publications included studies on remote consultation for initial, preoperative and follow-up assessment (including postoperative). In most instances, remote consultation reduced costs and time from referral to assessment and was associated with high patient satisfaction. However, a face-to-face follow-up appointment was required in 13%-72% of initial consultations, suggesting that remote consultation is only appropriate in selected cases. CONCLUSION: Remote consultation is appropriate and preferable for ENT consultation in specific conditions and circumstances. Future research should look to better define those conditions and circumstances, and report using recognised quality standards and outcome measures.","Gupta, Tanya; Gkiousias, Vasileios; Bhutta, Mahmood F",Clin Otolaryngol,462,25

The impact on intensive care resources can be significant and often require modification of service delivery, a key element which includes rapid expansion of the critical care workforce. Pandemics are also unpredictable, which necessitates rapid decision-making and action which, in the lack of experience and guidance, may be extremely challenging. Recognising the potential strain on intensive care units (ICUs), particularly on staffing, a working group was formed for the purpose of developing recommendations to support decision-making during rapid service expansion. METHODS: The Critical Care Pandemic Staffing Working Party (n = 21), representing nursing, allied health, and medical disciplines, has used a modified consensus approach to provide recommendations to inform multidisciplinary workforce capacity expansion planning in critical care. RESULTS: A total of 60 recommendations have been proposed which reflect general recommendations as well as those specific to maintaining the critical care workforce, expanding the critical care workforce, rostering and allocation of the critical care workforce, nurse-specific recommendations for staffing the ICU, education support and training during ICU surge situations, workforce support, models of care, and de-escalation. CONCLUSION: These recommendations are provided with the intent that they be used to guide interdisciplinary decision-making, and we suggest that careful consideration is given to the local context to determine which recommendations are most appropriate to implement and how they are prioritised. Ongoing evaluation of recommendation implementation and impact will be necessary, particularly in rapidly changing clinical contexts.","Marshall, Andrea P; Austin, Danielle E; Chamberlain, Di; Chapple, Lee-Anne S; Cree, Michele; Fetterplace, Kate; Foster, Michelle; Freeman-Sanderson, Amy; Fyfe, Rachel; Grealy, Bernadette A; Hodak, Alison; Holley, Anthony; Kruger, Peter; Kucharski, Geraldine; Pollock, Wendy; Ridley, Emma; Stewart, Penny; Thomas, Peter; Torresi, Kym; Williams, Linda",Aust. crit. care,462,26

OBJECTIVE: To validate the CP-GEP model in an independent Dutch cohort of melanoma patients. METHODS: Patients (aged &#8805;18 years) with primary cutaneous melanoma who underwent sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) between 2007-2017 at the Erasmus Medical Centre Cancer Institute were eligible. The CP-GEP model combines clinicopathological features (age and Breslow thickness) with the expression of eight target genes involved in melanoma metastasis (ITGB3/PLAT/SERPINE2/GDF15/TGFBR1/ LOXL4/IL8/MLANA). Using the pathology result of SLNB as gold standard, performance measures of the CP-GEP model were calculated, resulting in CP-GEP high risk or low risk for nodal metastasis. RESULTS: In total, 210 patients were included in the study. Most patients presented with T2 (n=94,45%) or T3 (n=70,33%) melanoma. Of all patients, 27% (n=56) had a positive SLNB, with nodal metastasis in 0%, 30%, 54%, and 16% of T1, T2, T3, and T4 melanoma patients, respectively. Overall, the CP-GEP model had a negative predictive value (NPV) of 90.5% (95% confidence interval [CI]77.9-96.2), with an NPV of 100% (95%CI:72.2-100) in T1, 89.3% (95%CI:72.8-96.3) in T2, and 75.0% (95%CI:30.1-95.4) in T3 melanomas. The CP-GEP indicated high risk in all T4 melanomas. CONCLUSIONS: The CP-GEP model is a non-invasive and validated tool that accurately identified patients with primary cutaneous melanoma at low risk for nodal metastasis. In this validation cohort, the CP-GEP model has shown potential to reduce SLNB procedures in melanoma patients.","Mulder, E E A P; Dwarkasing, J T; Tempel, D; van, A; Bosman, L; Verver, D; Mooyaart, A L; van, A A M; Verhoef, C; Nijsten, T E C; Grunhagen, D J; Hollestein, L M",Br. j. dermatol,462,22

Social distancing and lockdown are important measures for prevention. Police personnel are losing their lives due to COVID-19 while doing their duty in this lockdown time. Aim: The study aims to assess knowledge, attitude, and practices (KAP) of police force toward COVID-19. To assess correlation of knowledge with their practices and attitude. Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional, self-administered, anonymous survey questionnaire was administered to 8706 police personnel and data collected over a time period from April 11 to 16, 2020. We used t-test and multivariable binary logistic regression analysis to identify the association between KAP and demographic variables. Results: In all 8706 police personnel participated in the study. The median age of participants was 35 years (interquartile range: 19-59), 6787 (77.9%) were male, 6675 (76.6%) were of constable grade. Seven thousand three hundred thirty-two (83.7%) of participants recorded accurate (high) knowledge, and 6790 (78%) reported following preventive practices. Female participants were more likely to follow preventive measures despite low knowledge as compared to their male counterparts (P &lt; 0.0001). Female gender, age more than 35 years, and lower rank were associated with low knowledge and fear of contracting the disease. Multivariable binary logistic regression analysis showed that low knowledge is significantly associated with fear of getting disease odds ratio 1.29;95% confidence interval (1.15-1.46). Conclusion: In a cohort of police personnel, overall knowledge about COVID-19 is high. Female participants are found to be practicing appropriate preventive measures and they have faced stigmatizing behavior from society.

MIS shares similar clinical features compatible with several overlapping lifethreatening hyperinflammatory syndromes, such as incomplete Kawasaki Disease (KD) and toxic shock syndrome (TSS) associated to a cytokine storm suggestive of a macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) without fulfilling the criteria for hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), that may create a great challenge to distinguish between them. MIS should promptly be considered and treated, as uncontrolled MIS has a high mortality. In MIS cardiac involvement, heart failure may present as an additional problem, especially because volume loading is advised in accordance with proposed therapy.

Objective To determine the spatial pattern of road traffic injury during the 7-day Songkran holiday in Thailand. Method This study utilized the data obtained from the Information Technology for Emergency Medical System (ITEMS) covering the nationwide road traffic injury during the Songkran festival, Thai New Year holiday (April 9-15, 2015). The Moran's I was used to identify global autocorrelation within the country whereas the Local Indicators of Spatial Association (LISA) analysis was administered for analyzing the spatial distribution of RTIs and determining the spatial autocorrelation and correlation of numbers motor vehicles and length of road networks and road traffic injury. Result During Songkran holiday 2015, the univariate Moran's I of RTIs distribution among provinces in Thailand showed a slightly positive spatial autocorrelation, as the Moran's I was 0.1701, with statistical significance at 0.05. Local indicators of spatial association indicated seven hotspots and five cold spots. In addition, the number of motor vehicles, and length of trunk road (super highway), tertiary roads, secondary roads, and primary roads had positive spatial autocorrelation with road traffic injury, with Moran's I values of 0.173, 0.117, 0.219, 0.162, and 0.279, respectively. Conclusion This study demonstrates that local indicators of spatial association could detect the spatial pattern of road traffic injury. The number of motor vehicles, length of all roads served as new parameters for determining road traffic injury hotspots.","Tubtimhin, S; Laohasiriwong, W; Pitaksanurat, S; Sornlorm, K; Luenam, A",Kathmandu Univ Med J (KUMJ),462,16

The posttranslational modification of proteins has primarily been studied in cells and tissues in an intra-proteomic context (where both substrates and enzymes are part of the same species). However, the inter-proteomic posttranslational modifications of most of the SARS-CoV-2 proteins by the host enzymes and vice versa are largely unexplored in virus pathogenesis and in the host immune response. It is now known that the structural spike (S) protein of the SARS-CoV-2 undergoes proteolytic priming by the host serine proteases for entry into the host cells, and N- and O-glycosylation by the host cell enzymes during virion packaging, which enable the virus to spread. New evidence suggests that both SARS-CoV-2 and the host proteins undergo inter-proteomic posttranslational modifications, which play roles in virus pathogenesis and infection-induced immune response by hijacking the host cell signaling. The purpose of this minireview is to bring attention of the scientific community to recent cutting-edge discoveries in this understudied area. It is likely that a better insight into the molecular mechanisms involved may open new research directions, and thereby contribute to novel therapeutic modality development against the SARS-CoV-2.

Objective: To examine levels of severity of depressive symptoms over time among individuals with high risk in the UK during the COVID-19 pandemic. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study is part of an ongoing large panel study of adults aged 18 years and older residing in the UK, the COVID-19 Social Study, established on March 21, 2020. Data analysis was conducted in May 2020. Exposures: Sociodemographic risk factors included belonging to the Black, Asian, and minority racial/ethnic communities, low socioeconomic position (SEP), and essential worker roles (eg, workers in health and social care, education, childcare, or key public services). Health-related and psychosocial risk factors included preexisting physical and mental health conditions, experience of psychological or physical abuse, and low social support. Main Outcomes and Measures: Depressive symptoms were measured on 7 occasions from March 21 to April 2, 2020, using the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). Group-based depressive symptom trajectories were derived using latent growth mixture modeling. Results: The analytical sample comprised 51â¯417 adults aged 18 years and older (mean [SD] age, 48.8 [16.8] years; 26â¯276 [51.1%] women; 6145 members [12.0%] of Black, Asian, and minority racial/ethnic communities). Among these, 17â¯143 participants (33.3%) were in the lowest SEP quartile, and 11â¯342 participants (22.1%) were classified as essential workers. Three levels of severity of depressive symptoms were identified: low (30â¯850 participants [60.0%]), moderate (14â¯911 participants [29.0%]), and severe (5656 participants [11.0%]).

At the conclusion of the Spring 2020 semester in which all courses transitioned from a face-to-face to an online format, students, N = 93, were asked to describe what worked well in their courses in regards to their remote instruction experience and, when things did not go so well, what would have helped to make their experience better. The qualitative data were coded, and inductive analysis was used to generate categories (Johnson, 2012;Strauss & Corbin, 1998). Responses were grouped into labeled categories, and illustrative quotes were chosen to represent categories. Results revealed that remote instruction was somewhat worse than regular instruction. Across all respondents, analysis of responses to the open-ended questions revealed four themes that students believed were integral to remote instruction: (1) communication between students and faculty;(2) flexibility with assignments;(3) increased virtual interaction;and (4) support. Findings suggest how faculty can facilitate and ameliorate remote and hybrid instruction for their students.","Gonzalez-Frey, Selenid M.; Garas-York, Keli Kindzierski Corinne M.; Henry, Julie J.",Excelsior: Leadership in Teaching and Learning,462,20

Our analysis is based on a methodology which illustrates how we gathered the data, extracted the topics of the citing articles, and visualized the results. The data and services used are all open and free to foster the reproducibility of the analysis. The outcomes concerned the analysis of the entities citing Wakefield et al.'s article and their related in-text citations. We observed a constant increasing number of citations in the last 20 years, accompanied with a constant increment in the percentage of those acknowledging its retraction. Citing articles have started either discussing or dealing with the retraction of Wakefield et al.'s article even before its full retraction, happened in 2010. Articles in the social sciences domain citing the Wakefield et al.'s one were among those that have mostly discussed its retraction. In addition, when observing the in-text citations, we noticed that a large part of the citations received by Wakefield et al.'s article has focused on general discussions without recalling strictly medical details, especially after the full retraction. Medical studies did not hesitate in acknowledging the retraction and often provided strong negative statements on it.","Heibi, Ivan; Peroni, Silvio",,462,20

The present study aimed to modify the psychological constructs of Health Belief Model (HBM) in relation to self-medication behaviors using Freire's Adult Education Model (FAEM) among older adults in Khorramabad, Iran, from 2017 to 2018. METHODS: The mean age of the older adults was 66.28 ± 7.18 years. This was a randomized controlled trial study conducted on 132 individuals older than 60 who were referred from different health care centers. The participants were selected using multistage sampling method and randomly divided into two groups of intervention and control. The data collection instruments included a questionnaire which was designed based on both HBM and self-medication behaviors questionnaire. The phase of adult education model (AEM) was used to modify the psychological constructs of HBM and self-medication behaviors. Data were analyzed using SPSS software version 20 with a significant level of 0.05. Descriptive statistical tests, chi-squared test, paired t-test, independent t-test, and univariate modeling were employed for the purpose of analyzing data. RESULTS: There was no significant difference between groups in terms of self-medication. Unawareness of the effects of medicine were the most important reason for self-medication (p = 0.50). The two groups were not significantly different in terms of knowledge, HBM constructs, and self-medication behaviors (p > 0.05). However, they came up to be considerably different for the above variables after the intervention was implemented (p < 0.05). When the findings were adjusted for the effects of confounding variables, there were significant differences between the two groups in almost all constructs of HBM and their behaviors (p < 0.05). However, the perceived barrier modality of HBM did not reach to a significant level of difference between two groups. CONCLUSION: The educational intervention, which was based on Freire's AEM, had positive effects on the constructs of HBM and consequently on self-medication behaviors. The psychological constructs of HBM were affected at the phases of listening to problems. Self-medication was tempered at the action-reflection phase with shared creation and evaluation of the action plan geared toward the achievement of the behavioral objectives. The results might be of importance to healthcare professionals involved in care of older patients. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Current Controlled Trials IRCT2013091814512N2.

Radiological examinations, especially computed tomography (CT), play an important role in the fight against COVID-19. A comprehensive and timely review of radiological role in the fight against COVID-19 remains urgent and mandatory. Hence, the aim of this review is to summarize the radiological role in the fight against COVID-19. This review of current studies on COVID-19 provides insight into the radiological role in the detection, diagnosis, and monitoring for COVID-19. The typical radiological features of COVID-19 include bilateral, multifocal, and multilobar ground glass opacification with patchy consolidation, a peripheral/subpleural or posterior distribution (or both), mainly in the lower lobes. A combination of chest CT and repeat Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) testing may be beneficial for the diagnosis of COVID-19 in the setting of strongly clinical suspicion. Chest CT may improve the sensitivity for COVID-19 diagnosis, but patients' exposure to radiation should be kept as low as possible especially for children and pregnant women patients.","Hu, L; Wang, C",Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,462,1

METHODS: A literature search was conducted in the PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library databases until October 28, 2020. Studies covering COVID-19's severity classification data and COVID-19 patients with acute ischemic stroke were included. Two independent evaluators extracted data, and the random effects model was used to calculate the risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) of acute ischemic stroke associated with COVID-19's severity. RESULTS: A total of 8 studies were included, involving 5266 patients. Among all COVID-19 patients, the total incidence of ischemic stroke was 1.76% (95% CI: 0.82-3.01). Severe patients have an increased risk of acute ischemic stroke compared with non-severe patients (RR = 3.53, 95% CI: 2.06-6.07, P < 0.0001; I2 = 12%).

Data was collected during the COVID-19 pandemic. Agentic narcissism was unrelated to loneliness and social support. People characterized by a high level of antagonistic narcissism reported getting less social support and therefore feeling more lonely. People characterized by a high level of communal narcissism reported getting more social support, protecting them from feeling lonely. Our study points to different consequences of social restrictions posed by the COVID-19 pandemic to people characterized by higher agentic, antagonistic, and communal narcissism levels. This research expands current knowledge about grandiose narcissists and their social functioning, also during forced isolation. Antagonistic narcissism seems to be maladaptive, communal narcissism has no adverse consequences, while agentic narcissism is unrelated to reactions toward forced isolation.","Gąsiorowska, Weronika Sioch Martyna Żemojtel-Piotrowska Magdalena Anna",Personality and Individual Differences,462,3

In this article we recapitulate the molecular mechanisms of host cell entry of SARS-CoV­2 and discuss the current evidence for a potential conjunctival transmission of SARS-CoV­2. The current body of evidence indicates that SARS-CoV­2 requires the membrane-bound angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and the membrane-bound serine protease TMPRSS2 to enter cells. Recent studies suggest that COVID-19 patients rarely exhibit viral RNA in tear film and conjunctival smears and that, ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are only expressed in very small amounts in the conjunctiva, making conjunctival infection with SARS-CoV­2 via these mediators unlikely. Nevertheless, we consider the current evidence to be still too limited to provide a conclusive statement and recommend appropriate protective measures for healthcare personnel who are in close contact with suspected and confirmed COVID-19 patients.","Lange, Clemens; Wolf, Julian; Auw-Haedrich, Claudia; Schlecht, Anja; Boneva, Stefaniya; Lapp, Thabo; Agostini, Hansjürgen; Martin, Gottfried; Reinhard, Thomas; Schlunck, Günther",Ophthalmologe,462,23

Its advantages cover both analytical performance as well as ecological greenness. The quality control of pharmaceuticals requires sensitive, fast and economic methodologies to provide a high throughput at desirable costs. The low energy and decreased solvent consumption make this technique green as well as economic, and hence it is much preferred by pharmaceutical industries. Remdesivir is a recent antiviral, previously used for the treatment of Ebola virus infections, which was approved by the US-FDA in 2020 for treatment of infections caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus. Formulation and wide-scale production of this drug started recently and hence methodologies related to its quality control are highly required. A smart spectrofluorimetric method was validated as per the US-FDA guidelines for the facile estimation of Remdesivir. The assay of Remdesivir was based on its native fluorescence measurements at pH 4 and wavelengths of 244/405 nm. Calibration was achieved over the range of 1.0-65.0 ng mL-1. Different variables affecting the proposed methodology were studied to achieve maximum sensitivity, at limits of detection and quantification of 0.287 and 0.871 ng mL-1, respectively. The developed method is regarded as the first spectrofluorimetric one for the estimation of Remdesivir. The developed method was also utilized for the determination of the drug in its formulated IV infusion and in spiked human plasma. Statistical analysis verified that this method is accurate and reproducible. Moreover, the ecological impact of the developed procedures was evaluated on two recently reported assessment metrics, the Green Analytical Procedure Index (GAPI) and AGREE-analytical greenness metric, to emphasize the greenness of the procedure.","Elmansi, Heba; Ibrahim, Adel Ehab; Mikhail, Ibraam E; Belal, Fathalla",,462,32

METHODS: To retrieve the vitamin D levels data, the authors analyzed the vitamin D European population data compiled by 2019 European Calcified Tissue Society (ECTS) statement on vitamin D status published in the European Journal of Endocrinology. For the data set to be used for analysis, only recently published data that included general adult population of both genders aged 40-65 years or wider and must have included the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency. RESULTS: There were data sets from 10 countries that fitted the criteria and were analyzed. Severe vitamin D deficiency was defined as 25(OH)D less than 25â¯nmol/L (10â¯ng/dL). Pearson correlation analysis between death rate per million of population from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and prevalence of severe vitamin D deficiency showed a strong correlation with râ¯= 0.79, pâ¯= 0.007. Over time, correlation strengthened, and r coefficient asymptotically increased. After adjusting for countries' age structure and per capita health expenditures, multiple linear regression analysis showed that higher prevalence of severe vitamin D deficiency is associated with increased mortality. Each 1% increase in prevalence increased deaths by 55 per million (95% confidence interval, CI 8-102), pâ¯= 0.03.

Neglecting either of them can negatively influence on the other and induce many health and communication problems. Association between oral/dental health, self-esteem, quality of life and holistic health has been recognized for a long time. There has been increasing interest in dental health among patients with major mental disorders as well as in mental states and problems among patients with orodental disorders. Despite of huge progress in the field of dentistry psychiatric patients have had poor oral/dental health. Patients with major mental disorders have quite number of the risk factors for oral disease and consequently poorer dental health, but oral/dental problems and diseases are commonly overlooked or neglected. Bad or inappropriate dental care is related to the patients' amotivation, ignorance, fears, low economic status, stigmas and negative attitudes by the medical professionals. It is important to stress that dental diseases in psychiatric patients deserve the same attention as other comorbid somatic diseases. In this review we accentuate the need for more collaboration in order to bridge the professional gap between dentistry and psychiatry.","Sarac, Zdenko; Zovko, Ruzica; Curlin, Marina; Filakovic, Pavo",Psychiatr Danub,462,1

These noncompliance behaviors partly reflect people's concerns for the inherent costs of social distancing while discounting its public health benefits. We propose that this oversight may be associated with the limitation in one's mental capacity to simultaneously retain multiple pieces of information in working memory (WM) for rational decision making that leads to social-distancing compliance. We tested this hypothesis in 850 United States residents during the first 2 wk following the presidential declaration of national emergency because of the COVID-19 pandemic. We found that participants' social-distancing compliance at this initial stage could be predicted by individual differences in WM capacity, partly due to increased awareness of benefits over costs of social distancing among higher WM capacity individuals. Critically, the unique contribution of WM capacity to the individual differences in social-distancing compliance could not be explained by other psychological and socioeconomic factors (e.g., moods, personality, education, and income levels). Furthermore, the critical role of WM capacity in social-distancing compliance can be generalized to the compliance with another set of rules for social interactions, namely the fairness norm, in Western cultures. Collectively, our data reveal contributions of a core cognitive process underlying social-distancing compliance during the early stage of the COVID-19 pandemic, highlighting a potential cognitive venue for developing strategies to mitigate a public health crisis.","Xie, Weizhen; Campbell, Stephen; Zhang, Weiwei",Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,462,3

Preclinical studies demonstrate the therapeutic efficacy of approaches that target and reduce Atxn1 expression in a non-allele-specific manner. However, studies using Atxn1-/- mice raise cautionary notes that therapeutic reductions of ATXN1 might lead to undesirable effects such as reduction in the activity of the tumor suppressor Capicua (CIC), activation of the protease ß-secretase 1 (BACE1) and subsequent increased amyloidogenic cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein (APP), or a reduction in hippocampal neuronal precursor cells that would impact hippocampal function. Here, we tested whether an antisense oligonucleotide (ASO)-mediated reduction of Atxn1 produced unwanted effects involving BACE1, CIC activity, or reduction in hippocampal neuronal precursor cells. Notably, no effects on BACE1, CIC tumor suppressor function, or number of hippocampal neuronal precursor cells were found in mice subjected to a chronic in vivo ASO-mediated reduction of Atxn1.

As known, with the development of modern-day technology, Internet usage has become a part of everyday life. However, this situation often brings about the problem of Internet addiction. A positive relationship is known to exist between Internet addiction and psychological problems. This study aims to examine the moderator effect of COVID-19 fear on the ""mediating role of boredom proneness in relationship between internet addiction and DASS-21."" Materials/methods: In the current study, the effect of boredom proneness in this relationship was examined through the mediator effect of boredom proneness in the relationship between Internet addiction and the ""Depression, stress and anxiety scale"" DASS-21. Then, the moderator effect of the fear of COVID-19 was examined on the mediator role, which constitutes the main purpose of this research. For these purposes, 560 students studying at the undergraduate level at state universities in Turkey were reached as a sample. In the analysis of the collected data;parametric tests, correlation test, structural equation model, and moderator analysis were employed. Results: In the model in which the moderator effect of COVID-19 fear was examined;it appears that fear of COVID-19 increases the relationship between Internet addiction and boredom proneness. It also increases the relationship between boredom proneness and DASS-21. However, no significant moderator effect was found to exist in the relationship between Internet addiction and DASS-21. Conclusion: This study shows that the fear of COVID-19 has a significant effect on Internet addiction, boredom proneness, and psychological problems.

During decision-making, policymakers consider an estimate of the effective reproduction number Rt, which is the expected number of secondary infections spread by a single infected individual. OBJECTIVE: We propose a simple method for estimating the time-varying infection rate and the Rt. METHODS: We used a sliding window approach with a Susceptible-Infectious-Removed (SIR) model. We estimated the infection rate from the reported cases over a 7-day window to obtain a continuous estimation of Rt. A proposed adaptive SIR (aSIR) model was applied to analyze the data at the state and county levels. RESULTS: The aSIR model showed an excellent fit for the number of reported COVID-19 cases, and the 1-day forecast mean absolute prediction error was <2.6% across all states. However, the 7-day forecast mean absolute prediction error approached 16.2% and strongly overestimated the number of cases when the Rt was rapidly decreasing. The maximal Rt displayed a wide range of 2.0 to 4.5 across all states, with the highest values for New York (4.4) and Michigan (4.5). We found that the aSIR model can rapidly adapt to an increase in the number of tests and an associated increase in the reported cases of infection. Our results also suggest that intensive testing may be an effective method of reducing Rt. CONCLUSIONS: The aSIR model provides a simple and accurate computational tool for continuous Rt estimation and evaluation of the efficacy of mitigation measures.","Shapiro, Mark B; Karim, Fazle; Muscioni, Guido; Augustine, Abel Saju",J Med Internet Res,462,3

The aim was to assess the variation of alcohol drinking habits in a sample of Italian citizens during lockdown and to identify the psychosocial factors surrounding it. METHODS: An online anonymous questionnaire was created and submitted from 9th April 2020 to 28th April 2020. Questions were related to personal psychosocial details and alcohol drinking habits during the lockdown, including Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT C) questions. RESULTS: On a total of 1234 surveys the increase of both anxiety and fear was largely detected (63% and 61% respectively). The 18% increased alcohol consumption during the lockdown and it showed a significant correlation with anxiety and fear experienced (both p<0.001). The relative risk for 7 to 9 and more than 10 drinks per day consumption were directly linked to these symptoms (p<0.001). The most involved categories of participants showed this harmful association were self-employed workers and participants who live alone, subject aged 30-50 with high level of instruction or students and not occupied people in the age range 18-19 (all p<0.001). Additionally, the subset of the study population that showed low alcohol consumption before the lockdown has demonstrated the worsening of alcohol assumption during the quarantine (p<0.0001).

This paper therefore validates the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT2) in the context of e-grocery and enriches it with five constructs. We exploit a self-administered survey among 560 customers of two Belgian supermarkets and test the model by means of hierarchical multiple regression analysis. We do so not only for the full sample, but also for users and non-users separately. For the full sample, four of the five proposed context-specific constructs-namely, perceived risk, perceived time pressure, perceived in-store shopping enjoyment, and innovativeness-help better explain the intention to adopt or continue to use e-grocery services. In the subsamples, only perceived time pressure and innovativeness add explanatory power, and this only for non-users. In other words, the additional constructs primarily help discriminate between users and non-users.

We described events by PHA, number of contacts and exposure context.ResultsThe RKI processed 467 events, initiating contact to PHA 1,099 times (medianâ¯=â¯1; interquartile range (IQR): 1-2) and sharing data on 5,099 contact persons. Of 327 (70%) events with known exposure context, the most commonly reported exposures were aircraft (nâ¯=â¯64; 20%), cruise ships (nâ¯=â¯24; 7%) and non-transport contexts (nâ¯=â¯210; 64%). Cruise ship and aircraft exposures generated more contacts with authorities (medianâ¯=â¯10; IQR: 2-16, medianâ¯=â¯4; IQR: 2-11) and more contact persons (medianâ¯=â¯60; IQR: 9-269, medianâ¯=â¯2; IQR: 1-3) than non-transport exposures (medianâ¯=â¯1; IQR: 1-6 and medianâ¯=â¯1; IQR: 1-2). The median time spent on contact tracing was highest for cruise ships: 5 days (IQR: 3-9).ConclusionIn the COVID-19 pandemic, cross-border contact tracing is considered a critical component of the outbreak response. While only a minority of international contact tracing activities were related to exposure events in transport, they contributed substantially to the workload. The numerous communications highlight the need for fast and efficient global outbreak communication channels between PHA.","Markus, Inessa; Steffen, Gyde; Lachmann, Raskit; Marquis, Adine; Schneider, Timm; Tomczyk, Sara; Koppe, Uwe; Rohde, Anna M; Schink, Susanne Barbara; Seifried, Janna; Domaszewska, Teresa; Rexroth, Ute; An der Heiden, Maria",Euro surveill,462,20

METHODS: Within a veteran affairs medical center clinical laboratory, VTM was prepared with a Hanks Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS) 500 mL bottle with phenol red, sterile heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS), gentamicin sulfate (50 mg/mL), and amphotericin B (250 µg/mL). An antimicrobial mixture was made of 50 mL each of amphotericin B and gentamicin sulfate. Ten mL of FBS and 2 mL of the antimicrobial mixture were mixed into the HBSS bottle, from which 3 mL aliquots were made. Sterility and efficacy check were assessed. These preparations were conducted at our VAMC's clinical laboratory to assure adequate VTM supply during the COVID-19 shortage. RESULTS: The VTM was successfully prepared in-house, supporting uninterrupted testing for the facility and other affiliated medical facilities/centers and community living centers. CONCLUSION: This quality assurance/improvement report represents the first published manuscript on feasible VTM preparation exclusively within a clinical microbiology laboratory during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Petersen, Jeffrey; Dalal, Sharvari; Jhala, Darshana",,462,14

These data include elevated D-dimers observed among many COVID-19 patients. We present a retrospective analysis of admission D-dimer, and D-dimer trends, among 1065 adult hospitalized COVID-19 patients, across 6 New York Hospitals. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality. Secondary outcomes were intubation and venous thromboembolism (VTE). Three-hundred-thirteen patients (29.4%) died, 319 (30.0%) required intubation, and 30 (2.8%) had diagnosed VTE. Using Cox proportional-hazard modeling, each 1 µg/ml increase in admission D-dimer level was associated with a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.06 (95%CI 1.04-1.08, p < 0.0001) for death, 1.08 (95%CI 1.06-1.10, p < 0.0001) for intubation, and 1.08 (95%CI 1.03-1.13, p = 0.0087) for VTE. Time-dependent receiver-operator-curves for admission D-dimer as a predictor of death, intubation, and VTE yielded areas-under-the-curve of 0.694, 0.621, and 0.565 respectively. Joint-latent-class-modeling identified distinct groups of patients with respect to D-dimer trend. Patients with stable D-dimer trajectories had HRs of 0.29 (95%CI 0.17-0.49, p < 0.0001) and 0.22 (95%CI 0.10-0.45, p = 0.0001) relative to those with increasing D-dimer trajectories, for the outcomes death and intubation respectively. Patients with low-increasing D-dimer trajectories had a multivariable HR for VTE of 0.18 (95%CI 0.05-0.68, p = 0.0117) relative to those with high-decreasing D-dimer trajectories. Time-dependent receiver-operator-curves for D-dimer trend as a predictor of death, intubation, and VTE yielded areas-under-the-curve of 0.678, 0.699, and 0.722 respectively. Although admission D-dimer levels, and D-dimer trends, are associated with outcomes in COVID-19, they have limited performance characteristics as prognostic tests.","Naymagon, Leonard; Zubizarreta, Nicole; Feld, Jonathan; van Gerwen, Maaike; Alsen, Mathilda; Thibaud, Santiago; Kessler, Alaina; Venugopal, Sangeetha; Makki, Iman; Qin, Qian; Dharmapuri, Sirish; Jun, Tomi; Bhalla, Sheena; Berwick, Shana; Christian, Krina; Mascarenhas, John; Dembitzer, Francine; Moshier, Erin; Tremblay, Douglas",Thromb Res,462,26

The recent outbreak of the pandemic of the COVID-19, a novel pulmonary infection, has more than ever brought the attention of the research community to the machine-aided diagnosis of respiratory problems. This paper is thus an effort to exploit machine learning for classification of respiratory problems and proposes a framework that employs as much correlated information (auditory and demographic information in this work) as a dataset provides to increase the sensitivity and specificity of a diagnosing system. First, we use deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) to process and classify a publicly released pulmonary auditory dataset, and then we take advantage of the existing demographic information within the dataset and show that the accuracy of the pulmonary classification increases by 5% when trained on the auditory information in conjunction with the demographic information. Since the demographic data can be extracted using computer vision, we suggest using another parallel DCNN to estimate the demographic information of the subject under test visioned by the processing computer. Lastly, as a proposition to bring the healthcare system to users' fingertips, we measure deployment characteristics of the auditory DCNN model onto processing components of an NVIDIA TX2 development board.","Hosseini, Morteza; Ren, Haoran; Rashid, Hasib-Al; Mazumder, Arnab Neelim; Prakash, Bharat; Mohsenin, Tinoosh",,462,24

Currently, clinicians use haphazard manual solutions. The ubiquitous use of electronic health records provides an opportunity to standardise safety-netting practices.A new electronic safety-netting toolkit has been introduced to provide systematic ways to track and follow up patients. We will evaluate the effectiveness of this toolkit, which is embedded in a major primary care clinical system in England:Egerton Medical Information System(EMIS)-Web. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will conduct a stepped-wedge cluster RCT in 60 general practices within the RCGP Research and Surveillance Centre (RSC) network. Groups of 10 practices will be randomised into the active phase at 2-monthly intervals over 12 months. All practices will be activated for at least 2 months. The primary outcome is the primary care interval measured as days between the first recorded symptom of cancer (within the year prior to diagnosis) and the subsequent referral to secondary care. Other outcomes include referrals rates and rates of direct access cancer investigation.Analysis of the clustered stepped-wedge design will model associations using a fixed effect for intervention condition of the cluster at each time step, a fixed effect for time and other covariates, and then include a random effect for practice and for patient to account for correlation between observations from the same centre and from the same participant. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval has been obtained from the North West-Greater Manchester West National Health Service Research Ethics Committee (REC Reference 19/NW/0692). Results will be disseminated in peer-reviewed journals and conferences, and sent to participating practices. They will be published on the University of Oxford Nuffield Department of Primary Care and RCGP RSC websites.

Here we summarize and rationalize the results obtained by various mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomic approaches applied to the functional characterization of proteins and pathways associated with SARS-CoV-2-mediated infections in humans. Comparative analysis of cell-lines versus tissue samples indicates that our knowledge in proteome profile alternation in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection is still incomplete and the tissue-specific response to SARS-CoV-2 infection can probably not be recapitulated efficiently by in vitro experiments. However, regardless of the viral infection period, sample types, and experimental strategies, a thorough cross-comparison of the recently published proteome, phosphoproteome, and interactome datasets led to the identification of a common set of proteins and kinases associated with PI3K-Akt, EGFR, MAPK, Rap1, and AMPK signaling pathways. Ephrin receptor A2 (EPHA2) was identified by 11 studies including all proteomic platforms, suggesting it as a potential future target for SARS-CoV-2 infection mechanisms and the development of new therapeutic strategies.

Yet, little is known about the clinical and biologic correlates of circulating ACE2 levels in humans. We assessed the clinical and proteomic correlates of plasma (soluble) ACE2 protein levels in human heart failure. We measured plasma ACE2 using a modified aptamer assay among PHFS (Penn Heart Failure Study) participants (n=2248). We performed an association study of ACE2 against &#8776;5000 other plasma proteins measured with the SomaScan platform. Plasma ACE2 was not associated with ACE inhibitor and angiotensin-receptor blocker use. Plasma ACE2 was associated with older age, male sex, diabetes mellitus, a lower estimated glomerular filtration rate, worse New York Heart Association class, a history of coronary artery bypass surgery, and higher pro-BNP (pro-B-type natriuretic peptide) levels. Plasma ACE2 exhibited associations with 1011 other plasma proteins. In pathway overrepresentation analyses, top canonical pathways associated with plasma ACE2 included clathrin-mediated endocytosis signaling, actin cytoskeleton signaling, mechanisms of viral exit from host cells, EIF2 (eukaryotic initiation factor 2) signaling, and the protein ubiquitination pathway. In conclusion, in humans with heart failure, plasma ACE2 is associated with various clinical factors known to be associated with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), including older age, male sex, and diabetes mellitus, but is not associated with ACE inhibitor and angiotensin-receptor blocker use. Plasma ACE2 protein levels are prominently associated with multiple cellular pathways involved in cellular endocytosis, exocytosis, and intracellular protein trafficking. Whether these have a causal relationship with ACE2 or are relevant to novel coronavirus-2 infection remains to be assessed in future studies.","Chirinos, Julio A; Cohen, Jordana B; Zhao, Lei; Hanff, Thomas; Sweitzer, Nancy; Fang, James; Corrales-Medina, Vicente; Anmar, Ron; Morley, Michael; Zamani, Payman; Bhattacharya, Priyanka; Brandimarto, Jeff; Jia, Yi; Basso, Michael D; Wang, Zhaoqing; Ebert, Christina; Ramirez-Valle, Francisco; Schafer, Peter H; Seiffert, Dietmar; Gordon, David A; Cappola, Thomas",Hypertension,462,26

To gain knowledge about the pathology that may contribute to disease progression and fatality, we performed postmortem needle core biopsies of lung, liver, and heart in four patients who died of COVID-19 pneumonia. The patients' ages ranged from 59 to 81, including three males and one female. Each patient had at least one underlying disease, including immunocompromised status (chronic lymphocytic leukemia and renal transplantation) or other conditions (cirrhosis, hypertension, and diabetes). Time from disease onset to death ranged from 15 to 52 days. All patients had elevated white blood cell counts, with significant rise toward the end, and all had lymphocytopenia except for the patient with leukemia. Histologically, the main findings are in the lungs, including injury to the alveolar epithelial cells, hyaline membrane formation, and hyperplasia of type II pneumocytes, all components of diffuse alveolar damage. Consolidation by fibroblastic proliferation with extracellular matrix and fibrin forming clusters in airspaces is evident. In one patient, the consolidation consists of abundant intra-alveolar neutrophilic infiltration, consistent with superimposed bacterial bronchopneumonia. The liver exhibits mild lobular infiltration by small lymphocytes, and centrilobular sinusoidal dilation. Patchy necrosis is also seen. The heart shows only focal mild fibrosis and mild myocardial hypertrophy, changes likely related to the underlying conditions. In conclusion, the postmortem examinations show advanced diffuse alveolar damage, as well as superimposed bacterial pneumonia in some patients. Changes in the liver and heart are likely secondary or related to the underlying diseases.","Tian, Sufang; Xiong, Yong; Liu, Huan; Niu, Li; Guo, Jianchun; Liao, Meiyan; Xiao, Shu-Yuan",Mod Pathol,462,12

METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, hospitalised patients with confirmed severe COVID-19 in a single referral centre for the treatment of COVID-19, in Santo André, São Paulo Metropolitan Area, Brazil, underwent dilated eye examination of both eyes performed by a retina specialist. Findings were recorded using a portable digital fundus camera. Retinographies were analysed by two retina specialists. Medical records were reviewed for assessment of patient demographics, baseline comorbidities and clinical data. RESULTS: There were a total of 18 patients, nine (50%) male, median IQR age of 62.5 (12) years. Ten of the 18 patients (55.6%; 95% CI 33.7 to 75.4) had abnormalities on dilated eye examination. The main findings were flame-shaped haemorrhages (N=4; 22.2%; 95% CI 9.0 to 45.2) and ischaemic pattern lesions (cotton wool spots and retinal sectorial pallor) (N=4; 22.2%; 95% CI 9.0 to 45.2), with one patient having both cotton wool spots and flame-shaped haemorrhages. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that patients with severe COVID-19 have acute vascular lesions of the inner retina including flame-shaped haemorrhages and cotton wool spots. Further studies controlling for confounding factors are necessary to properly assess these findings so as to increase the understanding of COVID-19 pathophysiology and to identify new therapies.","Pereira, Leonardo Amarante; Soares, Larissa Caroline Mansano; Nascimento, Priscila Alves; Cirillo, Luciano Rabello Netto; Sakuma, Hebert Toshiaki; Veiga, Glaucia Luciano da; Fonseca, Fernando Luiz Afonso; Lima, Vagner Loduca; Abucham-Neto, Julio Zaki",Br. j. ophthalmol,462,26

Screening and early identification of pre-cancerous lesions are a cornerstone of the cervical cancer prevention strategy. Yet, there is limited literature on barriers to screening among Peruvian women. In this cross-sectional study, we aimed to examine Peruvian women's knowledge, attitudes, and practices regarding cervical cancer screening and identify possible reasons for the gap between knowledge and screening. METHODS: The study was conducted in metropolitan Lima from June-August 2019. We purposefully recruited 12 women who had previously been screened, and 12 who had never been screened for cervical cancer. The women completed a 40-question knowledge and attitude survey and an in-depth interview about barriers to screening. Descriptive analysis was used to calculate a knowledge and attitude score and qualitative analysis was guided by the Health Belief Model constructs. RESULTS: Previously screened participants had greater knowledge of cervical cancer symptoms, risk factors, and prevention (mean score = 28.08, S.D. = 4.18) compared to participants who had never been screened (mean score = 21.25, S.D. = 6.35). Both groups described lack of priority and embarrassment as barriers to cervical cancer screening. For participants who had never been screened before, major barriers included the fear of a cancer diagnosis and lack of information about screening services. Pregnancy, unusual gynecological symptoms and encouragement from friends and family were cues to action for participants seeking screening. Most participants in both groups recognized the benefits of getting screened for cervical cancer. Being previously screened increased participants' self-efficacy for engaging in screening behaviors again. Misconceptions regarding screening procedures and cervical cancer were also noted as barriers for participants accessing screening services. CONCLUSIONS: Improving knowledge and awareness about cervical cancer and screening programs may improve screening behaviors among women. Targeting women who have never been screened before and addressing their fears and concerns around embarrassment may be other areas for intervention. Misconceptions that deter women from screening services are an important issue that should be addressed in order to increase the number of women who get timely screenings.","Pieters, Michelle M; Proeschold-Bell, Rae Jean; Coffey, Emily; Huchko, Megan J; Vasudevan, Lavanya",BMC Womens Health,462,6

Middle-income countries (MICs) typically lack the resources and regulatory capacities to pursue strategies that wealthier countries do, but they also face different sets of challenges and opportunities than low-income countries (LICs). We focus on three dimensions of vaccination: procurement and production; regulation of marketing registration; and distribution and uptake. For each dimension we show the distinct challenges and opportunities faced by MICs. We illustrate these challenges and opportunities with the case of Brazil, showing how each dimension has been affected by intense political conflicts. Brazil's procurement and production strategy, which builds on a long trajectory of local production and technology transfer, has been riddled by conflicts between the national government and state governments. The regulatory approval process, based around one of Latin America's most highly-regarded regulatory authorities, has also been subject to acute inter- and intra-governmental conflicts. And with regard to distribution and uptake, in the face of high uncertainty, even with a solid health infrastructure, Brazil encounters difficulties in promoting vaccine delivery. The research also reveals the importance of coordination among these dimensions, in Brazil and beyond. Pandemic preparedness and response must include sharing knowledge of how to produce vaccines and recognition of the crucial linkages between procurement, regulation, delivery, and uptake that are necessary for ensuring access to these products.","Fonseca, Elize Massard da; Shadlen, Kenneth C; Bastos, Francisco I",Soc Sci Med,462,29

To this point, Germany's COVID-19 infection numbers and death rate have been lower than those of many other nations. Methods: This article summarizes the current regimen used in the field of orthopaedics in Germany during the COVID-19 pandemic. Internal university clinic guidelines, latest research results, expert consensus, and clinical experiences were combined in this article guideline. Results: Every patient, with and without symptoms, should be screened for COVID-19 before hospital admission. Patients should be assigned to three groups (infection status unknown, confirmed, or negative). Patients with unknown infection status should be considered as infectious. Dependent of the infection status and acuity of the symptoms, patients are assigned to a COVID-19-free or affected zone of the hospital. Isolation, hand hygiene, and personal protective equipment is essential. Hospital personnel directly involved in the care of COVID-19 patients should be tested on a weekly basis independently of the presence of clinical symptoms, staff in the COVID-19-free zone on a biweekly basis. Class 1a operation rooms with laminar air flow and negative pressure are preferred for surgery in COVID-19 patients. Electrocautery should only be utilized with a smoke suction system. In cases of unavoidable elective surgery, a self-imposed quarantine of 14 days is recommended prior to hospital admission.

Twenty-nine patients recovered from COVID-19 as confirmed by negative nucleic tests for two consecutive times were recruited. A total of 29 age-, gender- and education-matched healthy controls were also recruited. The cognitive functions of all subjects were evaluated by the iPad-based online neuropsychological tests, including the Trail Making Test (TMT), Sign Coding Test (SCT), Continuous Performance Test (CPT), and Digital Span Test (DST). Blood samples from all patients were collected for examining inflammatory profiles, including interleukin-2 (IL-2), IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, tumor necrosis factor-&#945; (TNF-&#945;), interferon-Î³ (IFN-Î³), and C-reactive protein (CRP). The relationship between cognitive functions and inflammatory profiles were analyzed by Pearson correlation. In results, although no significant differences were found in TMT, SCT, and DST between the two groups, patients with COVID-19 scored lower in the correct number of the second and third parts of CPT, they also scored higher in the missing number of the third part of CPT (all P < 0.05). In patients with COVID-19, there was a trend of significant difference for lower reaction time in the first and second parts of CPT (P = 0.050, and 0.051, respectively), as well as the lower correct number of the second part of CPT (P = 0.050). Correlation analysis showed that the reaction time for the first and second parts of CPT was positively correlated with the CRP levels (r = 0.557 and 0.410, P < 0.05). In conclusion, our findings indicated that cognitive impairments exist even in patients recovered from COVID-19, and might be possibly linked to the underlying inflammatory processes.","Zhou, Hetong; Lu, Shaojia; Chen, Jingkai; Wei, Ning; Wang, Dandan; Lyu, Hailong; Shi, Chuan; Hu, Shaohua",J Psychiatr Res,462,1

The ability to recognize and potentially intervene early in those patients at greatest risk of developing this complication could be of great clinical utility. In this study, we performed flow cytometric analysis of peripheral blood samples from 34 COVID-19 patients in early 2020 in an attempt to identify factors that could help predict the severity of disease and patient outcome. Although we did not detect significant differences in the number of monocytes between patients with COVID-19 and normal healthy individuals, we did identify significant morphologic and functional differences, which are more pronounced in patients requiring prolonged hospitalization and intensive care unit (ICU) admission. Patients with COVID-19 have larger than normal monocytes, easily identified on forward scatter (FSC), side scatter analysis by routine flow cytometry, with the presence of a distinct population of monocytes with high FSC (FSC-high). On more detailed analysis, these CD14+ CD16+ , FSC-high monocytes show features of mixed M1/M2 macrophage polarization with higher expression of CD80+ and CD206+ compared with the residual FSC-low monocytes and secretion of higher levels of IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-&#945;, when compared with the normal controls. In conclusion, the detection and serial monitoring of this subset of inflammatory monocytes using flow cytometry could be of great help in guiding the prognostication and treatment of patients with COVID-19 and merits further evaluation.","Zhang, Dan; Guo, Rui; Lei, Lei; Liu, Hongjuan; Wang, Yawen; Wang, Yili; Qian, Hongbo; Dai, Tongxin; Zhang, Tianxiao; Lai, Yanjun; Wang, Jingya; Liu, Zhiqiang; Chen, Tianyan; He, Aili; O039,; Dwyer, Michael; Hu, Jinsong",J. leukoc. biol,462,7

As of July 2020, SARS-CoV-2 has infected more than 14 million people and provoked more than 590,000 deaths, worldwide. From the beginning, a variety of pharmacological treatments has been empirically used to cope with the life-threatening complications associated with Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). Thus far, only a couple of them and not consistently across reports have been shown to further decrease mortality, respect to what can be achieved with supportive care. In most cases, and due to the urgency imposed by the number and severity of the patients' clinical conditions, the choice of treatment has been limited to repurposed drugs, approved for other indications, or investigational agents used for other viral infections often rendered available on a compassionate-use basis. The rationale for drug selection was mainly, though not exclusively, based either i) on the activity against other coronaviruses or RNA viruses in order to potentially hamper viral entry and replication in the epithelial cells of the airways, and/or ii) on the ability to modulate the excessive inflammatory reaction deriving from dysregulated host immune responses against the SARS-CoV-2. In several months, an exceptionally large number of clinical trials have been designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of anti-COVID-19 therapies in different clinical settings (treatment or pre- and post-exposure prophylaxis) and levels of disease severity, but only few of them have been completed so far. This review focuses on the molecular mechanisms of action that have provided the scientific rationale for the empirical use and evaluation in clinical trials of structurally different and often functionally unrelated drugs during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.","Lisi, Lucia; Lacal, Pedro Miguel; Barbaccia, Maria Luisa; Graziani, Grazia",Biochem Pharmacol,462,1

The idea that conceptual metaphors actually influence reasoning has been corroborated by Thibodeau and Boroditsky, who showed that, when crime is metaphorically presented as a beast, readers become more enforcement-oriented than when crime is metaphorically framed as a virus. Recently, Steen, Reijnierse and Burgers replied that this metaphorical framing effect does not seem to occur and suggested that the question should be rephrased about the conditions under which metaphors do or do not influence reasoning. In this paper, we investigate whether presenting the COVID-19 pandemic as a war affects people's reasoning about the pandemic. Data collected suggest that the metaphorical framing effect does not occur by default. Rather, socio-political individual variables such as speakers' political orientation and source of information favor the acceptance of metaphor congruent entailments: right-wing participants and participants relying on independent sources of information are those more conditioned by the COVID-19 war metaphor, thus more inclined to prefer bellicose options.","Panzeri, Francesca; Di Paola, Simona; Domaneschi, Filippo",PLoS One,462,24

Objective: To assess the predictors for effective telepharmacy services on increasing access of patients to care and reducing dispensing errors in community pharmacies. Method: This is a prospective study carried out for 4 months in 52 community pharmacies across the United Arab Emirates (UAE) using disguised direct observation. Multivariable logistic regression was used as a tool to predict factors associated with effective telepharmacy services in improving dispensing safety and increasing access of patients to pharmaceutical care. Data were entered and analyzed using the Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS) software version 26. Results: Pharmacist recommendations related to COVID-19 at pharmacies with telepharmacy (n = 63,714) versus those without remote services (n = 15,539) were significantly more likely to be (1) contact the nearest testing center (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 7.93), (2) maintain home quarantine (AOR = 5.64), and (3) take paracetamol for fever (AOR = 3.53), all were significant results (p < 0.05). Rates of medication dispensing errors (MDEs) and its subcategories, prescription-related errors, and pharmacist counseling errors across pharmacies with telepharmacy versus those without remote services were (15.81% vs. 19.43%, p < 0.05), (5.38% vs. 10.08%, p < 0.05), and (10.42% vs. 9.35%, p > 0.05), respectively. However, pharmacies with telepharmacy were more likely to include wrong patient errors (AOR = 5.38, p < 0.05).

Methods: We conducted a narrative review of the use of NSAIDs in the orthopedic patient with COVID-19, focusing on the effects of NSAIDs on the inflammatory process, the role of NSAIDs in orthopedics, and the associations between NSAID use and complications of pneumonia. Results: We found that it may be appropriate to consider NSAID use in otherwise healthy orthopedic patients with COVID-19 and significant pain. Conclusions: In this context, we recommend that NSAIDs be used at the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration possible in orthopedic patients with COVID-19. However, pending further data and based on the concerns outlined in this review, we recommend avoiding NSAIDs in orthopedic patients with significant comorbidities and those who are undergoing major orthopedic surgery.","Wu, Christopher L; Jules-Elysee, Kethy M; Kirksey, Meghan A; Liguori, Gregory A",HSS J,462,1

METHODS: A sample of 512 (62.5% women; Mage = 22.12 years, SD = 2.47) Chinese college students participated in this study from 24 March to 1 April 2020 via online questionnaire. They completed measures of social media use, the COVID-19 stressor, negative affect, secondary traumatic stress (STS), depression, and anxiety as well as covariates. RESULTS: As expected, results from regression analyses indicated that a higher level of social media use was associated with worse mental health. More exposure to disaster news via social media was associated with greater depression for participants with high (but not low) levels of the disaster stressor. Moreover, path analysis showed negative affect mediated the relationship of social media use and mental health. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that the disaster stressor may be a risk factor that amplifies the deleterious impact of social media use on depression. In addition, excessive exposure to disaster on social media may trigger negative affect, which may in turn contribute to mental health problems. Future interventions to improve mental health should consider elements of both disaster stressor and negative affect.","Zhao, Nan; Zhou, Guangyu",Applied psychology.

An oral dose (50 or 100mg) of TRA was administered to 17 healthy volunteers. Hair samples were collected prior to drug administration and 14, 30, 60 and 120 days after ingestion. Each sample was segmented in 5mm segments and washed. The analytes were extracted from pulverized hair by incubation in extraction media for 18h at 37°C. A validated UHPLC-MS/MS method was used to quantify the analytes at a LLOQ of 0.001ng/mg. Hair segments corresponding to the time of ingestion were positive for TRA and the metabolites of each sampling time point, although neighboring segments also showed positive results. The highest concentrations for both dosage groups were observed in the proximal segment of hair collected 14 days after ingestion for all subjects: 0.061-0.95ng TRA/mg, 0.012-0.86ng NDMT/mg and 0.009-0.17ng ODMT/mg (n=16). Generally, the TRA concentration was higher than the metabolites concentrations but depended on the CYP2D6 phenotype. The metabolite to TRA ratios were stable within a subject over the sampling time points, however it varied greatly between subjects. No significant differences in hair concentrations were found between the two dosage groups at each sampling time. Several confounding factors were identified such as hair pigmentation and internal sweat. We showed that analysis of 5mm segments improved the determination of the exposure time after a single ingestion of TRA. In addition, in the later sampling time points the analytes were spread more between segments and the total drug amount of each later sampling time point declined up to a 100% (median: 75%) due to wash out. The presented results are important additions to the sparse literature reporting single dose of psychoactive drugs in hair.","Johansen, Sys Stybe; Dang, Linda Tuong Vy Le; Nielsen, Marie Katrine Klose; Haage, Pernilla; Kugelberg, Fredrik Carl; Kronstrand, Robert",Forensic Sci Int,462,26

The aim of this article is to argue that Camus's sense of cyclicality related to the recurrence of crises is particularly important for existential management. This idea is embodied primarily by Camus's famous retelling of the myth of Sisyphus, which is not only a provocative metaphor of his thoughts, as discussed by many authors, but is also an inspiring expression of the idea of âârevolt, which is further developed in Camus's later work. The article focuses on recent updates to Camus's Sisyphean revolt in existentially oriented approaches to management. These are mainly the concepts of the existential manager, an analysis of managerial lived experience within existential hermeneutic phenomenology, and the perspective of an absurd organization. Camus's motif of cyclicality represents a stimulating framework for analysing lived managerial experience, which is characterized by alternating phases of success and failure. The article also draws attention to other important motives in Camus's work, such as avoiding extremes and idealistic constructs, and expressing the value of human life as a basis for ethical behaviour. All the mentioned motives are closely related to the concept of revolt. This article also provides several explanatory comments on the editorial, which help to take a closer look at Camus's style of thinking and avoid possible misinterpretations. In this respect, the distinction between Camus's approach and forms of existentialism is particularly important.","Müller, Michal",Philos Manag,462,1

This also occurs with tapping of the radial bone, and it has been suggested that vibration is a stimulus for deep tendon reflexes. We investigated whether the normal stimulus for the deep tendon reflex is a sudden stretch, a phasic vibration, or both. Furthermore, we investigated the importance of forearm position for the reflex response in controls and stroke patients. METHODS: We investigated 50 neurological outpatients without clinical signs of neurological disorders in the arms. The biceps tendon and distal radius were tapped with the forearm in the midway (90°), supinated, and pronated positions. In 10 of these patients, the two reflexes were also investigated with quantitative electromyography (EMG) measurements in the 3 positions. Another 10 patients were investigated clinically when stretch of elbow was eliminated and 17 patients were examined when prestretching of the biceps tendon was avoided. Finally, we examined 32 patients that had experienced stroke. RESULTS: In 94% (47/50) of patients, after a radial tap, the biceps contraction disappeared in the supinated forearm, and the median peak-to-peak amplitude of the surface EMG response (n = 10) decreased from 1.1 to 0.2 mV (p < .01). Elimination of elbow stretch as well as pressure on the biceps tendon did not change the reflex response. In 84% (27/32) of stroke patients, after a radial tap, the biceps contraction persisted in supination in the arm with hyperreflexia. CONCLUSION: The combined clinical and EMG results are consistent with the concept that the deep tendon reflexes in man can be elicited by both stretch and phasic vibration. Clinicians should be aware that the brachioradial reflex depends on the forearm position.","Tfelt-Hansen, Peer; Meritam Larsen, Pirgit; van Deurs, Ulla; Fabricius, Martin",Brain Behav,462,22

Recently, transfer learning has been used for Covid-19 detection using X-ray, ultrasound, and CT scans. One of the major limitations inherent to these proposed methods is limited labeled dataset size that affects the reliability of Covid-19 diagnosis and disease progression. In this work, we demonstrate that how we can augment limited X-ray images data by using Contrast limited adaptive histogram equalization (CLAHE) to train the last layer of the pre-trained deep learning models to mitigate the bias of transfer learning for Covid-19 detection. We transfer learned various pre-trained deep learning models including AlexNet, ZFNet, VGG-16, ResNet-18, and GoogLeNet, and fine-tune the last layer by using CLAHE-augmented dataset. The experiment results reveal that the CLAHE-based augmentation to various pre-trained deep learning models significantly improves the model efficiency. The pre-trained VCG-16 model with CLAHEbased augmented images achieves a sensitivity of 95% using 15 epochs. AlexNet works show good sensitivity when trained on non-augmented data. Other models demonstrate a value of less than 60% when trained on non-augmented data. Our results reveal that the sample bias can negatively impact the performance of transfer learning which is significantly improved by using CLAHE-based augmentation.","Henna, Shagufta; Reji, Aparna",,462,23

Publications were also categorized according to research field, country and article types. Data were given as numbers and percentages. RESULTS: Among 18 EM journals, Resuscitation ranked in the first place and American Journal of Emergency Medicine ranked in the last place according to Impact Factor. In these journals, 512 (12.2%) articles related to COVID-19 were published. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine and Internal and Emergency Medicine published the greatest amount of publications related to COVID-19 (n = 71). The American Journal of Emergency Medicine was also the leading journal in terms of ""Total Citations to COVID-19 Articles"" (n = 1192). Western Journal of Emergency Medicine published the greatest proportion of COVID-19 articles (Total COVID-19 Articles/Total Articles = 0.3). World Journal of Emergency Surgery ranked in the first place in terms of citations per COVID-19 articles (n = 33.2). The most common studied field was Effects of COVID-19 on the Health System (n = 222). The US was the most productive country with 188 COVID-19 publications and 1411 citations to these publications, followed by Italy. CONCLUSION: The contribution of EM journals to COVID-19 literature is controversial. ""Effects of COVID-19 on the Health System"" is the most studied field. ""Clinical Properties, Ethical Issues and Treatment Methods"" are neglected fields in EM journals.","Erenler, Ali Kemal; Baydin, Ahmet",Am J Emerg Med,462,20
413238,413238,413238,Evaluating Clinical Efficacy of Antiviral Therapy for COVID-19: A Surrogate Endpoint Approach,16.729086,6.7826796,2021,"This study shows if biologically activated carbon (BAC) is backwashed at the correct frequency, a number of benefits can be derived in addition to aiding the subsequent coagulation process. Previous studies have shown that the BAC improves the removal of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) by subsequent coagulation by decreasing non-coagulable dissolved organic carbon (NC-DOC). However, the actual mechanism of such observation or optimising strategies of NC-DOC removal is unknown. The impact of backwashing on BAC reactor performance in terms of NC-DOC removal and microbial community structure was investigated. A laboratory scale BAC column was operated for more than five months with backwashing at once every five days, but in one cycle it was operated without backwashing for 14 days and the effluent collected at different times from the last backwash was subjected to enhanced coagulation (EC). All the effluent of BAC collected at different days depicted better floc forming characteristics than the feed water which is raw surface water. The effluent collected on day three from the last backwash (BAC-3d) contained the least amount (1.64 mg/L) of NC-DOC despite the highest DOC (3.89 mg/L) of all effluents. The coagulant requirement (5 mg-Fe3+/mg-DOC) was minimal for BAC-3d effluent among raw water and all other BAC effluent water samples. This is remarkable given the raw water contained 2.76 mg/L of NC-DOC. The microbial community on BAC granules on day three contained a higher abundance of biodegradable organic matter (BOM) removing microorganisms and low abundance of opportunistic pathogens. Similar performance in terms of DOC removal with the backwash was also observed in the continuous operation of other BAC columns. Possible backwash frequency that optimises the BAC/EC and derives many other benefits is proposed. The BAC/EC combination could help solve many emerging issues cost-effectively hence, needs further investigation.","Korotta-Gamage, Shashika Madushi; Sathasivan, Arumugam; Bal Krishna, K C",Sci Total Environ,462,16
413474,413474,413474,Pneumatosis intestinalis during treatment for bullous pemphigoid,16.626892,7.316665,2021,"Goal: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a contagious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus, initially identified in the mainland of China, late December 2019. COVID-19 has been confirmed as a higher infectious disease that can spread quickly in a community population depending on the number of susceptible and infected cases and also depending on their movement in the community. Since January 2020, COVID-19 has reached out to many countries worldwide, and the number of daily cases remains to increase rapidly. Method: Several mathematical and statistical models have been developed to understand, track, and forecast the trend of the virus spread. Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Quarantined-Recovered-Death-Insusceptible (SEIQRDP) model is one of the most promising epidemiological models that has been suggested for estimating the transmissibility of the COVID-19. In the present study, we propose a fractional-order SEIQRDP model to analyze the COVID-19 pandemic. In the recent decade, it has proven that many aspects in many domains can be described very successfully using fractional order differential equations. Accordingly, the Fractional-order paradigm offers a flexible, appropriate, and reliable framework for pandemic growth characterization. In fact, due to its non-locality properties, a fractional-order operator takes into consideration the variables’ memory effect, and hence, it takes into account the sub-diffusion process of confirmed and recovered cases. Results– The validation of the studied fractional-order model using real COVID-19 data for different regions in China, Italy, and France show the potential of the proposed paradigm in predicting and understanding the pandemic dynamic. Conclusions: Fractional-order epidemiological models might play an important role in understanding and predicting the spread of the COVID-19, also providing relevant guidelines for controlling the pandemic.","Bahloul, Mohamed A.; Chahid, Abderrazak Taous-Meriem Laleg-Kirati",IEEE Open Journal of Engineering in Medicine and Biology,462,26

Preliminary results suggest that tocilizumab, a humanized monoclonal anti-interleukin-6 receptor antibody, may be beneficial in severely ill patients, but no data are available on earlier stages of disease. An anticipated blockade of interleukin-6 might hypothetically prevent the catastrophic consequences of the overt cytokine storm. We evaluated early-given tocilizumab in patients hospitalized with COVID-19, and identified outcome predictors. Consecutive patients with initial Sequential-Organ-Failure-Assessment (SOFA) score < 3 fulfilling pre-defined criteria were treated with tocilizumab. Serial plasma biomarkers and nasopharyngeal swabs were collected. Of 193 patients admitted with COVID-19, 64 met the inclusion criteria. After tocilizumab, 49 (76.6%) had an early favorable response. Adjusted predictors of response were gender, SOFA score, neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio, Charlson comorbidity index and systolic blood pressure. At week-4, 56.1% of responders and 30% of non-responders had cleared the SARS-CoV-2 from nasopharynx. Temporal profiles of interleukin-6, C-reactive protein, neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio, NT-ProBNP, D-dimer, and cardiac-troponin-I differed according to tocilizumab response and discriminated final in-hospital outcome. No deaths or disease recurrences were observed. Preemptive therapy with tocilizumab was safe and associated with favorable outcomes in most patients. Biological and clinical markers predicted outcomes.","Guillén, Lucía; Padilla, Sergio; Fernández, Marta; Agulló, Vanesa; García, José Alberto; Telenti, Guillermo; García-Abellán, Javier; Botella, Ángela; Gutiérrez, Félix; Masiá, Mar",Sci Rep,462,23

This study evaluates the risk of hospitalization and mortality among patients with hypertension and COVID-19 in a large US integrated healthcare system. Methods Patients with hypertension and COVID-19 (between March 1- September 1, 2020) on ACEIs or ARBs were compared with patients on other frequently used antihypertensive medications. Results Among 14,129 patients with hypertension and COVID-19 infection (mean age 60 years, 48% men, 58% Hispanic), 21% were admitted to the hospital within 30 days of COVID-19 infection. Of the hospitalized patients, 24% were admitted to intensive care units, 17% required mechanical ventilation, and 10% died within 30 days of COVID-19 infection. Exposure to ACEIs or ARBs prior to COVID-19 infection was not associated with an increased risk of hospitalization or all-cause mortality (rate ratios for ACEIs vs other antihypertensive medications = 0.98, 95% CI: 0.88, 1.08;ARBs vs others = 1.00, 95% CI: 0.90, 1.11) after applying inverse probability of treatment weights. These associations were consistent across racial/ethnic groups. Use of ACEIs or ARBs during hospitalization was associated with a lower risk of all-cause mortality (odds ratios for ACEIs or ARBs vs others = 0.50, 95% CI: 0.34, 0.72).

This study explores the experiences of New Zealand general practice teams in their use of telehealth during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic in New Zealand. METHOD: We qualitatively analysed a subtheme on telehealth of the General Practice Pandemic Experience New Zealand (GPPENZ) study, where general practice team members across the country were invited to participate in five surveys between 8 May 2020 to 27 August 2020. RESULTS: 164 participants enrolled in the study during survey one, with 78 (48%) completing all surveys. Five telehealth themes were identified: benefits, limitations, paying for consults, changes over time and plans for future use. Benefits included rapid triage, convenience and efficiency, and limitations included financial and technical barriers for practices and patients and concerns about clinical risk. Respondents rapidly returned to in-person consultations and wanted clarification of conditions suited to telehealth, better infrastructure and funding. CONCLUSION: To equitably sustain telehealth use, the following are required: adequate funding, training, processes communicated to patients, improved patient access to technology and technological literacy, virtual physical examination methods and integration with existing primary health care services.","Wilson, G.; Currie, O.; Bidwell, S.; Saeed, B.; Dowell, A.; Halim, A.

But the role of chemokines in mild COVID-19 has not yet been established. According to the epidemiological statistics, most of the COVID-19 cases in Shiyan City, China, have been mild. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the level of chemokines in mild COVID-19 patients and explore the correlation between chemokines and host immune response. METHODS: In this study, we used an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to detect serum levels of chemokines in COVID-19 patients in Shiyan City. Expression of chemokine receptors and of other signaling molecules was measured by real-time polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: We first demonstrated that COVID-19 patients, both sever and mild cases, are characterized by higher level of chemokines. Specifically, monocyte chemotactic protein 1 (MCP-1) is expressed at higher levels both in severe and mild cases of COVID-19. The receptor of MCP-1, C-C chemokine receptor type 2, was expressed at higher levels in mild COVID-19 patients. Finally, we observed a significant negative correlation between expression levels of interferon (IFN) regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) and serum levels of MCP-1 in mild COVID-19 patients. CONCLUSION: Higher expression of MCP-1 in mild COVID-19 patients might be correlated with inhibition of IFN signaling. The finding adds to our understanding of the immunopathological mechanisms of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection and provides potential therapeutic targets and strategies.","Xi, Xueyan; Guo, Yang; Zhu, Min; Wei, Yuhui; Li, Gang; Du, Boyu; Wang, Yunfu",Virol J,462,21

Prevention-effective adherence proposes that PrEP adherence should be aligned with the risk of HIV, which could be applied to both daily and ED PrEP adherence measurement. The objective of this study was to describe the relationship between the use of PrEP and sex events among the MSM PrEP users and identify factors associated with adherence among daily and ED MSM PrEP users. METHODS: A multicentre, observational, prospective cohort study was conducted at three hospital-based clinics in three urban cities of Taiwan from January 2018 to December 2019. MSM ages 18 years or older - at high risk of HIV acquisition and taking PrEP during the study period - were included in the analysis. MSM PrEP users were allowed to choose between daily and ED PrEP based on their preference. Data on sociodemographic characteristics, mental health, sexual behaviours, substance use and PrEP-taking behaviours were collected at each visit. RESULTS: A total of 374 MSM were included in the analysis with 1,054 visits. More than half (56%) of the PrEP users chose ED at the baseline and 150 regimen switches were reported by 21% of the participants. There was only one seroconversion documented during the study period. Most (84.2%) of the MSM PrEP users were able to adhere to PrEP during the most recent anal intercourse in the past one month. Among ED PrEP users with suboptimal adherence, the majority (81.9%) missed the pre-coital dose. In the multivariable analysis, we found that participants who switched from daily to an ED dosing regimen were associated with poorer adherence to PrEP. CONCLUSIONS: A high level of PrEP adherence was observed among the majority of MSM in a real-world setting. On the other hand, Taiwanese MSM switching from daily to ED dosing regimens were less likely to adhere to PrEP, suggesting that novel approaches focusing on a dosing switch would be necessary for MSM to improve their adherence to PrEP.","Wu, Huei-Jiuan; Wen-Wei Ku, Stephane; Chang, Howard H; Li, Chia-Wen; Ko, Nai-Ying; Strong, Carol",J Int AIDS Soc,462,2

Objectives: The objectives of this study were (1) to design, validate, and calibrate a simple, easy-to-use mortality risk score in a hospitalized COVID-19 population. Methods: Multi-hospital health system in New York City. Patients (n=4840) with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV2 infection who were admitted between March 1 and April 28, 2020. Gray's K-sample test for the cumulative incidence of a competing risk was used to assess and rank 48 different variables' associations with mortality. Candidate variables were added to the composite score using DeLong's test to evaluate their effect on predictive performance (AUC) of in-hospital mortality. Final AUCs for the new score, SOFA, qSOFA, and CURB-65 were assessed on an independent test set. Results: Of 48 variables investigated, 36 (75%) displayed significant (p&lt;0.05 by Gray's test) associations with mortality. The variables selected for the final score were (1) oxygen support level, (2) troponin, (3) blood urea nitrogen, (4) lymphocyte percentage, (5) Glasgow Coma Score, and (6) age. The new score, COBALT, outperforms SOFA, qSOFA, and CURB-65 at predicting mortality in this COVID-19 population: AUCs for initial, maximum, and mean COBALT scores were 0.81, 0.91, and 0.92, compared to 0.77, 0.87, and 0.87 for SOFA. Conclusions: The COBALT score provides a point-of-care tool to estimate mortality in hospitalized COVID-19 patients with superior performance to SOFA and other scores currently in widespread use.","Yoo, E.

This bibliometric study revealed that publications related to macrophages in ALI tend to increase continuously. China was a big producer and the USA was an influential country in this field. Most studies were mainly centered on basic researches in the past decade, and pathways associated with the regulatory role of macrophages in inhibiting and attenuating ALI have become the focus of attention in more recent studies. What is more, our bibliometric analysis showed that macrophages play an important role in COVID-19-induced ALI and may be a target for the treatment of COVID-19.","Wang, Sheng; Zhou, Huanping; Zheng, Li; Zhu, Wanli; Zhu, Lina; Feng, Di; Wei, Juan; Chen, Guannan; Jin, Xiaohong; Yang, Hao; Shi, Xuan; Lv, Xin",Front Immunol,462,24

This situation manifested during the period of COVID-19 lockdown throughout the world and Africa in particular. The purpose of this study is to explore Domestic Violence (DV) cases in African during the COVID-19 lockdown. METHODS: Data for this study were gleaned from an electronic literature search using various databases PubMed and BioMed Central, Web of Science, etc. Key search words were gender DV during and after COVID-19. A total of 68 records were identified during the search. However, only 46 of these sources met the inclusion criteria. RESULTS: From the review done in selected African countries which include Egypt, South Africa, Kenya, Nigeria, Ghana and Zimbabwe; it was discovered that COVID-19 lockdown across these countries worsens the already existing cases of DV. The study also noted that generally, the response of the government has been very poor in terms of dealing with DV cases in the period of COVID-19 lockdown. CONCLUSION: The study concluded that despite the failures of government in tackling the DV pandemics, NGOs have been very active in championing the cause of those violated while also trying to provide succour to victims. Thus, the study recommended that countries in Africa need to join international initiatives in prioritising DV cases while trying to deal with the virus itself. Thus, one disease should not be traded for another.","Uzobo, Endurance; Ayinmoro, Aboluwaji D",Int Q Community Health Educ,462,1

It was a relatively under-explored field, and as a clinical and educational psychologist it was becoming increasingly apparent that there were concerns of young people, with some of these reflected in their experiences of sadness and despair. However, as I researched and measured the depression construct, I became aware of despair as a growing phenomenon, with an increased focus and emphasis on stress, anxiety and depression. In time, the statistics would bear out the concerns, as one in four young people have identified as being or are likely to be depressed in their lifetime in some Western communities like Australia, the United States and the United Kingdom (WHO, 2018). Given the growing 'ill health' of our Western communities, something had to change. In the 1980s, young people were concerned about their future with the fear of nuclear war. As I was writing this invited retrospective in late 2019, there were widespread concerns about global warming, and in the first half of 2020 concerns arising from the pandemic of COVID-19 are dominating. Coping theory research and practice can make a significant contribution to how we cope with our world in general and the specifics of our lives in particular. This article reports a body of work in the field of coping to illustrate the value of the core constructs and their applications in diverse settings providing opportunities for helpful adaptation and development in the face of whatever circumstances arise.","Frydenberg, Erica",Educa.

This paper reviews the recent literature of the anti-inflammatory effects of RIC, with a particular focus on the innate immune response and cytokine inhibition. Given the current COVID-19 pandemic, the inflammatory hypothesis of cardiac protection is an attractive target on which to re-purpose such novel therapies. A PubMed/MEDLINE&#8482; search was performed on July 13th 2020, for the key terms RIC, cytokines, the innate immune system and inflammation. Data suggest that RIC attenuates inflammation in animals by immune conditioning, cytokine inhibition, cell survival and the release of anti-inflammatory exosomes. It is proposed that RIC inhibits cytokine release via a reduction in nuclear factor kappa beta (NF-&#954;B)-mediated NLRP3 inflammasome production. In vivo, RIC attenuates pro-inflammatory cytokine release in myocardial/cerebral infarction and LPS models of endotoxaemia. In the latter group, cytokine inhibition is associated with a profound survival benefit. Further clinical trials should establish whether the benefits of RIC in inflammation can be observed in humans. Moreover, we must consider whether uncomplicated MI and elective surgery are the most suitable clinical conditions in which to test this hypothesis.","Pearce, Lucie; Davidson, Sean M; Yellon, Derek M",Basic Res Cardiol,462,21

Although big data analytics and artificial intelligence are widely used in the realms of health and medicine, researchers are only beginning to use these tools to explore the clinical characteristics and predictive factors of patients with COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: Our primary objectives are to describe the clinical characteristics and determine the factors that predict intensive care unit (ICU) admission of patients with COVID-19. Determining these factors using a well-defined population can increase our understanding of the real-world epidemiology of the disease. METHODS: We used a combination of classic epidemiological methods, natural language processing (NLP), and machine learning (for predictive modeling) to analyze the electronic health records (EHRs) of patients with COVID-19. We explored the unstructured free text in the EHRs within the Servicio de Salud de Castilla-La Mancha (SESCAM) Health Care Network (Castilla-La Mancha, Spain) from the entire population with available EHRs (1,364,924 patients) from January 1 to March 29, 2020. We extracted related clinical information regarding diagnosis, progression, and outcome for all COVID-19 cases. RESULTS: A total of 10,504 patients with a clinical or polymerase chain reaction-confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 were identified; 5519 (52.5%) were male, with a mean age of 58.2 years (SD 19.7). Upon admission, the most common symptoms were cough, fever, and dyspnea; however, all three symptoms occurred in fewer than half of the cases. Overall, 6.1% (83/1353) of hospitalized patients required ICU admission. Using a machine-learning, data-driven algorithm, we identified that a combination of age, fever, and tachypnea was the most parsimonious predictor of ICU admission; patients younger than 56 years, without tachypnea, and temperature <39 degrees Celsius (or >39 ºC without respiratory crackles) were not admitted to the ICU. In contrast, patients with COVID-19 aged 40 to 79 years were likely to be admitted to the ICU if they had tachypnea and delayed their visit to the emergency department after being seen in primary care. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that a combination of easily obtainable clinical variables (age, fever, and tachypnea with or without respiratory crackles) predicts whether patients with COVID-19 will require ICU admission.","Izquierdo, Jose Luis; Ancochea, Julio; Soriano, Joan B",J Med Internet Res,462,1

Since then, it has spread rapidly affecting 188 countries and was declared a pandemic by the WHO on 11 March 2020. Preliminary reports suggest up to 30% of patients require intensive care unit (ICU) admission and case fatality rate estimate is 2.3%-7.2%. The primary reason for ICU admission is hypoxaemic respiratory failure, while factors associated with ICU admission include increased age, presence of comorbidities and cytokine storm. Case series and retrospective trials initially assessed proposed treatments with randomised controlled trials now reporting early outcomes. We conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to identify epidemiological factors, treatments and complications that predict mortality among critically ill patients with COVID-19. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Our comprehensive search strategy was developed in consultation with a research librarian. We will search electronic databases: Ovid Medline, Ovid Embase, Ovid Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) and Wiley Cochrane Library. The search strategy combines concepts from COVID-19, validated COVID-19 search filters and geographical locations of large outbreaks. Citation screening, selection, quality assessment and data abstraction will be performed in duplicate. Clinically homogenous epidemiological characteristics, interventions and complications will be pooled in statistical meta-analysis. Within the framework of a living systematic review, the search and data analysis will be updated every 6 months. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Our systematic review will synthesise literature on risk factors and interventions associated with mortality in critically ill patients with COVID-19. Results will be presented at national and international conferences and submitted for peer-reviewed publication. The pooled analysis can provide guidance to inform clinical guidelines for care of critically ill patients with COVID-19. Iterative updates will be made public through open access.

This is the context for understanding government responses to COVID-19 and the Grenfell fire, both of which have resulted in avoidable death and injury and both of which illustrate the role of ""common-sense"" in the demonisation and blaming of the victims of state violence along with a deligitimation of expertise in public health. Following Gramsci's conceptualisation of common-sense and its role in cultivating a never-guaranteed consensus for the continuance of capitalist state power, we explore the emergence of Gramsci's ""good sense"" in the current juncture and its challenge to the harms of state that FMCS has generated.","Coleman, R.; Mullin-McCandlish, B.",State Crime,462,33

This study examined vicarious racism and vigilance in relation to symptoms of depression and anxiety among Asian and Black Americans. METHODS: We used data from a cross-sectional study of 604 Asian American and 844 Black American adults aged &#8805;18 in the United States recruited from 5 US cities from May 21 through July 15, 2020. Multivariable linear regression models examined levels of depression and anxiety by self-reported vicarious racism and vigilance. RESULTS: Controlling for sociodemographic characteristics, among both Asian and Black Americans, greater self-reported vicarious racism was associated with more symptoms of depression (Asian: ß = 1.92 [95% CI, 0.97-2.87]; Black: ß = 1.72 [95% CI, 0.95-2.49]) and anxiety (Asian: ß = 2.40 [95% CI, 1.48-3.32]; Black: ß = 1.98 [95% CI, 1.17-2.78]). Vigilance was also positively related to symptoms of depression (Asian: ß = 1.54 [95% CI, 0.58-2.50]; Black: ß = 0.90 [95% CI, 0.12-1.67]) and anxiety (Asian: ß = 1.98 [95% CI, 1.05-2.91]; Black: ß = 1.64 [95% CI, 0.82-2.45]). CONCLUSIONS: Mental health problems are a pressing concern during the COVID-19 pandemic. Results from our study suggest that heightened racist sentiment, harassment, and violence against Asian and Black Americans contribute to increased risk of depression and anxiety via vicarious racism and vigilance.

Reply,16.678612,7.1121216,2020,"Since the first known case of a COVID-19 infected patient in Wuhan, China on 8 December 2019, COVID-19 has spread to more than 200 countries, causing a worldwide public health crisis. The existing literature fails to examine what caused this sudden outbreak from a crisis management perspective. This article attempts to fill this research gap through analysis of big data, officially released information and other social media sources to understand the root cause of the crisis as it relates to China's current management system and public health policy. The article draws the following conclusions: firstly, strict government control over information was the main reason for the early silencing of media announcements, which directly caused most people to be unprepared and unaware of COVID-19. Secondly, a choice between addressing a virus with an unknown magnitude and nature, and mitigating known public panic during a politically and culturally sensitive time, lead to falsehood and concealment. Thirdly, the weak autonomous management power of local public health management departments is not conducive for providing a timely response to the crisis. Finally, the privatization of many state-owned hospitals led to the unavailability of public health medical resources to serve affected patients in the Wuhan and Hubei Province. This article suggests that China should adopt a Singaporean-style public health crisis information management system to ensure information disclosure and information symmetry and should use it to monitor public health crises in real time. In addition, the central government should adopt the territorial administration model of a public health crisis and increase investment in public health in China.","Shangguan, Ziheng; Wang, Mark Yaolin; Sun, Wen",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),462,8

Reduction in PP2A activity has been linked to progression of microglial mediated neuroinflammatory diseases. Inflammatory conditions are characterized by increased population of CD86+ve M1 cells and a therapeutic strategy to polarize microglial cells towards CD206+ve M2 cells is the need of hour. In this paper we analyzed A: whether the level of PP2A is altered in CD86+ve cells, B: whether FTY720, a known modulator of PP2A, is able to restore the level of PP2A in inflamed CD86+ve cells. Results revealed that PP2A activity was significantly diminished in inflamed cells but the surprising observation was the cell viability of only 35.99% upon FTY720 treatment in inflamed cells lacking basal PP2A activity. A sharp increase at mRNA level of CD95 and ASK-1 indicated that apoptosis occurred in these cells through CD95/ASK-1/JNK pathway. Importantly, flow cytometric analysis revealed apoptosis of not only CD86+ve cells but also CD206+ve cells. Previous studies have reported that FTY720 polarizes microglial cells towards M2 states; however apoptosis of M2 cells was not studied. As western blot analysis revealed that FTY720 failed to completely restore PP2A, another PP2A modulator, Memantine, was used for co-treatment. Upon co-treatment, the level of PP2A was completely restored and also viability of microglial cells was significantly improved with a significant reduction in apoptosis of M2 cells. These findings suggest that co-treatment strategy may prove beneficial to balance M1/M2 microglial population, thereby improving neuronal functions.","Nematullah, Md; Hoda, M N; Nimker, Shwetanjali; Khan, Farah",Toxicol Appl Pharmacol,462,0

Here we estimate the relation of the online attention on COVID-19-related conspiracy theories to human mobility, as well as to the numbers of confirmed COVID-19 cases, during 14 March 2020 to 28 August 2020. We observe that the online attention to COVID-19 conspiracy theories is significantly and negatively related to human mobility, but its negative impact is noticeably less than those of the attention to official information and personal protection measures. Since human mobility significantly promotes the spread of COVID-19, the attention to official information and personal protection measures lowers COVID-19 cases by 16.16% and 9.41%, respectively, while attention to conspiracy theories only reduces the COVID-19 cases by 6.65%. In addition, we find that in the states with higher online attention to COVID-19 conspiracy theories, the negative relation of the attention to conspiracy theories is much weaker than that in states where there is less concern about conspiracies.

OBJECTIVE: In southern Germany, a telephone hotline for psychological first aid for COVID-19-related burdens was set up under the lead of the Baden-Wuerttemberg Ministry of Social Affairs and Integration, opened to the entire population and evaluated in April 2020. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In the period from 22 April to 24 July 2020, 753 volunteer psychotherapeutically trained counselors from different professional groups answered a total of 8096 calls. RESULTS: Depression symptoms (36%), anxiety symptoms (18%) and psychotic symptoms (19%) were most frequently reported. Every second call was related to a previous mental illness. During the counseling sessions, which lasted 25â¯min on average, a variety of psychological acute interventions were conducted. In the presence of unclear symptoms, psychotic symptoms or severe personality disorder symptoms, the counselors were able to help significantly less compared to the remaining calls in which other clearly defined symptoms were present. CONCLUSION: The results point to both the benefits and limitations of hotline services. The major benefits relate to the fast availability and effective professional help for people with clearly characterized symptoms. In the case of unclear or complex symptoms, immediate help by telephone seems to be possible only to a limited extent, but it could initiate access to further help offers. Overall, the results of this study provide a first indication that hotline services for psychological first aid are feasible under pandemic conditions.","Vonderlin, Ruben; Biermann, Miriam; Konrad, Michael; Klett, Martin; Kleindienst, Nikolaus; Bailer, Josef; Lis, Stefanie; Bohus, Martin",Nervenarzt,462,1

Coronaviruses have produced two pandemics and one epidemic in the last two decades. The current pandemic has created a worldwide catastrophe threatening the lives of over 15 million as of July 2020. Current research efforts have been focused on producing a vaccine or repurposing current drug compounds to develop a therapeutic. There is, however, a need to study the active site preferences of relevant targets, such as the SARS-CoV-2 main protease (SARS-CoV-2 Mpro), to determine ways to optimize these drug compounds. The ensemble docking and characterization work described in this article demonstrates the multifaceted features of the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro active site, molecular guidelines to improving binding affinity, and ultimately the optimization of drug candidates. A total of 220 compounds were docked into both the 5R7Z and 6LU7 SARS-CoV-2 Mpro crystal structures. Several key preferences for strong binding to the four subsites (S1, S1', S2, and S4) were identified, such as accessing hydrogen binding hotspots, hydrophobic patches, and utilization of primarily aliphatic instead of aromatic substituents. After optimization efforts using the design guidelines developed from the molecular docking studies, the average docking score of the parent compounds was improved by 6.59 -log10(Kd) in binding affinity which represents an increase of greater than six orders of magnitude. Using the optimization guidelines, the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro inhibitor cinanserin was optimized resulting in an increase in binding affinity of 4.59 -log10(Kd) and increased protease inhibitor bioactivity. The results of molecular dynamic (MD) simulation of cinanserin-optimized compounds CM02, CM06, and CM07 revealed that CM02 and CM06 fit well into the active site of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro [Protein Data Bank (PDB) accession number 6LU7] and formed strong and stable interactions with the key residues, Ser-144, His-163, and Glu-166. The enhanced binding affinity produced demonstrates the utility of the design guidelines described. The work described herein will assist scientists in developing potent COVID-19 antivirals.","Stoddard, Shana V; Stoddard, Serena D; Oelkers, Benjamin K; Fitts, Kennedi; Whalum, Kellen; Whalum, Kaylah; Hemphill, Alexander D; Manikonda, Jithin; Martinez, Linda Michelle; Riley, Elizabeth G; Roof, Caroline M; Sarwar, Nowreen; Thomas, Doni M; Ulmer, Emily; Wallace, Felissa E; Pandey, Pankaj; Roy, Sudeshna",Viruses,462,10

Materials and Methods: The study population comprised of teenagers, aged 12 to 20 years, who belong to a WhatsApp group. The questions were framed and developed based on the transitional impact scale which has high test-retest reliability. Through the WhatsAppgroup, the teens were informed about the survey. Those who were willing to participate were provided the website link to fill the questionnaire. Fisher's exact tests were used to assess differences in proportions wherever applicable. Results: Among the 320 participants, 16.7% of them were boys and 83.3% were girls, and the mean age of boys and girls was 16.2 +/- 2.1years and 15.6 +/- 1.8 years, respectively. More than 40% of teens expressed that they often felt stressed out. Teens of both the genders reported getting irritated by small normal things (34.1%), thought they were helpless (32.8%), sometimes they felt like a burden to people around them (27.8%), and 36.9% reported feeling lonely or left out often. Regarding usage of electronic devices, 47.7% of girls and 58.5% of boys were always on any one of the electronic devices like mobiles, tabs, laptops, television, etc. Similarly, more than 50% of the boys and 60% of the girls slept 6-8h during this pandemic situation. Conclusion: This study shows that this life-changing transitional event has made a massive impact on the daily routine of these teenagers.

The objective is to analyze the rate of complicated AA during the pandemic, compared to the same period of the previous year. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospective unicenter observational cohort study that included patients under 14 years of age seen in the ED with a diagnosis of AA during the months of March to May 2019 (non-pandemic) and 2020 (pandemic). RESULTS: 90 patients were included (41 in non-pandemic and 49 in pandemic). No difference was found between the two periods in the time from the clinic onset until the visit to the ED (37h vs 38h, p=0.881), but there was a difference in the time from arrival at the ED until the surgery (7:00h vs 10:30h, p=0.004). The difference was accentuated when comparing the month of March with April-May 2020 (6h vs 12h; p=0.001). No significant differences were observed in the rate of complicated AA in intraoperative diagnosis (35% vs 33%; p=0.870) or anatomopathology (35% vs 48%; p=0.222), nor in the number of postoperative complications, length of hospitalization and readmissions. An increase in the anatomopathological diagnosis of AA with periapendicitis was observed (47% vs 81%; p=0.001) CONCLUSION: During the pandemic, a delay from arrival at the ED until the surgery was observed in children diagnosed with AA. This delay resulted in an increase in the diagnosis of histologically evolved AA, but without an increase in the clinical complications of the disease.","Bonilla, Leire; Gálvez, Carmen; Medrano, Lara; Benito, Javier",An. pediatr.

OC43 apparently emerged from a bovine coronavirus (BCoV) spillover. All three viruses attach to 9-O-acetylated sialoglycans via spike protein S with hemagglutinin-esterase (HE) acting as a receptor-destroying enzyme. In BCoV, an HE lectin domain promotes esterase activity toward clustered substrates. OC43 and HKU1, however, lost HE lectin function as an adaptation to humans. Replaying OC43 evolution, we knocked out BCoV HE lectin function and performed forced evolution-population dynamics analysis. Loss of HE receptor binding selected for second-site mutations in S, decreasing S binding affinity by orders of magnitude. Irreversible HE mutations led to cooperativity in virus swarms with low-affinity S minority variants sustaining propagation of high-affinity majority phenotypes. Salvageable HE mutations induced successive second-site substitutions in both S and HE. Apparently, S and HE are functionally interdependent and coevolve to optimize the balance between attachment and release. This mechanism of glycan-based receptor usage, entailing a concerted, fine-tuned activity of two envelope protein species, is unique among CoVs, but reminiscent of that of influenza A viruses. Apparently, general principles fundamental to virion-sialoglycan interactions prompted convergent evolution of two important groups of human and animal pathogens.","Lang, Yifei; Li, Wentao; Li, Zeshi; Koerhuis, Danielle; van den Burg, Arthur C S; Rozemuller, Erik; Bosch, Berend-Jan; van Kuppeveld, Frank J M; Boons, Geert-Jan; Huizinga, Eric G; van der Schaar, Hilde M; de Groot, Raoul J",Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,462,24

British MPs have also received abuse and hate on social media during this time. To understand and contextualise the level of abuse MPs receive, we consider how ministers use social media to communicate about the pandemic, and the citizen engagement that this generates. The focus of the paper is on a large-scale, mixed-methods study of abusive and antagonistic responses to UK politicians on Twitter, during the pandemic from early February to late May 2020. We find that pressing subjects such as financial concerns attract high levels of engagement, but not necessarily abusive dialogue. Rather, criticising authorities appears to attract higher levels of abuse during this period of the pandemic. In addition, communicating about subjects like racism and inequality may result in accusations of virtue signalling or pandering by some users. This work contributes to the wider understanding of abusive language online, in particular that which is directed at public officials.","Farrell, Tracie; Gorrell, Genevieve; Bontcheva, Kalina",J Comput Soc Sci,462,16

To enhance multilingual care, the authors created a freely available web application, RadTranslate, that provides multilingual radiology examination instructions. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the implementation of this intervention in radiology. METHODS: The device-agnostic web application leverages artificial intelligence text-to-speech technology to provide standardized, human-like spoken examination instructions in the patient's preferred language. Standardized phrases were collected from a consensus group consisting of technologists, radiologists, and ancillary staff members. RadTranslate was piloted in Spanish for chest radiography performed at a COVID-19 triage outpatient center that served a predominantly Spanish-speaking Latino community. Implementation included a tablet displaying the application in the chest radiography room. Imaging appointment duration was measured and compared between pre- and postimplementation groups. RESULTS: In the 63-day test period after launch, there were 1,267 application uses, with technologists voluntarily switching exclusively to RadTranslate for Spanish-speaking patients. The most used phrases were a general explanation of the examination (30% of total), followed by instructions to disrobe and remove any jewelry (12%). There was no significant difference in imaging appointment duration (11 ± 7 and 12 ± 3 min for standard of care versus RadTranslate, respectively), but variability was significantly lower when RadTranslate was used (P = .003). CONCLUSIONS: Artificial intelligence-aided multilingual audio instructions were successfully integrated into imaging workflows, reducing strain on medical interpreters and variance in throughput and resulting in more reliable average examination length.","Chonde, Daniel B; Pourvaziri, Ali; Williams, Joy; McGowan, Jennifer; Moskos, Margo; Alvarez, Carmen; Narayan, Anand K; Daye, Dania; Flores, Efren J; Succi, Marc D",J.

There is an urgent need for new treatment approaches for this difficult cancer. METHODS: We previously established an original cell line, HSC-60, from a scirrhous gastric cancer patient and isolated a peritoneal-metastatic cell line, 60As6, in nude mice following orthotopic inoculations. In the present study, we focused on the expression of long noncoding ribonucleic acid (RNA) (lncRNA) in the cell lines and investigated the mechanism on peritoneal dissemination. RESULTS: We demonstrated that an lncRNA, HOX transcript antisense RNA (HOTAIR), is expressed significantly more highly in 60As6 than HSC-60 cells. Then, using both HOTAIR knockdown and overexpression experiments, we showed that high-level expression of HOTAIR promotes epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in 60As6 cells. By luciferase assay, we found that HOTAIR directly targets and binds to miR-217, and that miR-217 directly binds to Zinc finger E-box-binding homeobox 1 (ZEB1). The knockdown of HOTAIR in 60As6 cells significantly reduced the invasion activity and peritoneal dissemination - and significantly prolonged the survival - in the orthotopic tumor mouse model. CONCLUSION: An EMT-associated pathway (the HOTAIR-miR-217-ZEB1 axis) appears to inhibit peritoneal dissemination and could lead to a novel therapeutic strategy against scirrhous gastric cancer in humans.","Takei, Yoshifumi; Hara, Toshifumi; Suzuki, Akiko; Mihara, Keichiro; Yanagihara, Kazuyoshi",Pathobiology,462,20

DESIGN: Diagnostic accuracy study. SETTING: Laboratory analyses were performed in the United Kingdom at Imperial College, London and university facilities in London. Research clinics for finger prick sampling were run in two affiliated NHS trusts. PARTICIPANTS: Sensitivity analyses were performed on sera stored from 320 previous participants in the React 2 programme with confirmed previous severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Specificity analyses were performed on 1000 prepandemic serum samples. 100 new participants with confirmed previous SARS-CoV-2 infection attended study clinics for finger prick testing. INTERVENTIONS: Laboratory sensitivity and specificity analyses were performed for seven LFIAs on a minimum of 200 serum samples from participants with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and 500 prepandemic serum samples, respectively. Three LFIAs were found to have a laboratory sensitivity superior to the finger prick sensitivity of the LFIA currently used in React 2 seroprevalence studies (84%). These LFIAs were then further evaluated through finger prick testing on participants with confirmed previous SARS-CoV-2 infection: two LFIAs (Surescreen, Panbio) were evaluated in clinics in June-July 2020 and the third LFIA (AbC-19) in September 2020. A spike protein enzyme linked immunoassay and hybrid double antigen binding assay were used as laboratory reference standards. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The accuracy of LFIAs in detecting immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 compared with two reference standards. RESULTS: The sensitivity and specificity of seven new LFIAs that were analysed using sera varied from 69% to 100%, and from 98.6% to 100%, respectively (compared with the two reference standards). Sensitivity on finger prick testing was 77% (95% confidence interval 61.4% to 88.2%) for Panbio, 86% (72.7% to 94.8%) for Surescreen, and 69% (53.8% to 81.3%) for AbC-19 compared with the reference standards. Sensitivity for sera from matched clinical samples performed on AbC-19 was significantly higher with serum than finger prick at 92% (80.0% to 97.7%, P=0.01). Antibody titres varied considerably among cohorts. The numbers of positive samples identified by finger prick in the lowest antibody titre quarter varied among LFIAs. CONCLUSIONS: One new LFIA was identified with clinical performance suitable for potential inclusion in seroprevalence studies. However, none of the LFIAs tested had clearly superior performance to the LFIA currently used in React 2 seroprevalence surveys, and none showed sufficient sensitivity and specificity to be considered for routine clinical use.","Moshe, Maya; Daunt, Anna; Flower, Barnaby; Simmons, Bryony; Brown, Jonathan C; Frise, Rebecca; Penn, Rebecca; Kugathasan, Ruthiran; Petersen, Claire; Stockmann, Helen; Ashby, Deborah; Riley, Steven; Atchison, Christina; Taylor, Graham P; Satkunarajah, Sutha; Naar, Lenny; Klaber, Robert; Badhan, Anjna; Rosadas, Carolina; Marchesin, Federica; Fernandez, Natalia; Sureda-Vives, Macià; Cheeseman, Hannah; O039,; Hara, Jessica; Shattock, Robin; Fontana, Gianluca; Pallett, Scott J C; Rayment, Michael; Jones, Rachael; Moore, Luke S P; Ashrafian, Hutan; Cherapanov, Peter; Tedder, Richard; McClure, Myra; Ward, Helen; Darzi, Ara; Elliott, Paul; Cooke, Graham S; Barclay, Wendy S",BMJ,462,16

To support pediatric clinical studies for investigational treatments of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), pediatric-specific dosing is required. Objective: To define pediatric-specific dosing regimens for hydroxychloroquine and remdesivir for COVID-19 treatment. Design, Setting, and Participants: Pharmacokinetic modeling and simulation were used to extrapolate investigated adult dosages toward children (March 2020-April 2020). Physiologically based pharmacokinetic modeling was used to inform pediatric dosing for hydroxychloroquine. For remdesivir, pediatric dosages were derived using allometric-scaling with age-dependent exponents. Dosing simulations were conducted using simulated pediatric and adult participants based on the demographics of a white US population. Interventions: Simulated drug exposures following a 5-day course of hydroxychloroquine (400 mg every 12 hours × 2 doses followed by 200 mg every 12 hours × 8 doses) and a single 200-mg intravenous dose of remdesivir were computed for simulated adult participants. A simulation-based dose-ranging study was conducted in simulated children exploring different absolute and weight-normalized dosing strategies. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome for hydroxychloroquine was average unbound plasma concentrations for 5 treatment days. Additionally, unbound interstitial lung concentrations were simulated. For remdesivir, the primary outcome was plasma exposure (area under the curve, 0 to infinity) following single-dose administration. Results: For hydroxychloroquine, the physiologically based pharmacokinetic model analysis included 500 and 600 simulated white adult and pediatric participants, respectively, and supported weight-normalized dosing for children weighing less than 50 kg. Geometric mean-simulated average unbound plasma concentration values among children within different developmental age groups (32-35 ng/mL) were congruent to adults (32 ng/mL). Simulated unbound hydroxychloroquine concentrations in lung interstitial fluid mirrored those in unbound plasma and were notably lower than in vitro concentrations needed to mediate antiviral activity. For remdesivir, the analysis included 1000 and 6000 simulated adult and pediatric participants, respectively. The proposed pediatric dosing strategy supported weight-normalized dosing for participants weighing less than 60 kg. Geometric mean-simulated plasma area under the time curve 0 to infinity values among children within different developmental age-groups (4315-5027 ng × h/mL) were similar to adults (4398 ng × h/mL). Conclusions and Relevance: This analysis provides pediatric-specific dosing suggestions for hydroxychloroquine and remdesivir and raises concerns regarding hydroxychloroquine use for COVID-19 treatment because concentrations were less than those needed to mediate an antiviral effect.","Maharaj, Anil R; Wu, Huali; Hornik, Christoph P; Balevic, Stephen J; Hornik, Chi D; Smith, P Brian; Gonzalez, Daniel; Zimmerman, Kanecia O; Benjamin, Daniel K; Cohen-Wolkowiez, Michael",JAMA Pediatr,462,21

The aim of our systematic review was to investigate symptoms and diagnostic-therapeutic management of IBD patients with COVID-19. METHODS: We searched PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and MedRxiv up to July 29, 2020, to identify all studies reporting clinical information on adult and pediatric IBD patients with confirmed COVID-19. RESULTS: Twenty-three studies met our inclusion criteria, including 243,760 IBD patients. COVID-19 was diagnosed in 1028 patients (509 with Crohn's disease [49.5%], 428 with ulcerative colitis [41.6%], 49 with indeterminate colitis [4.8%], and 42 with missing data [4.1%]), accounting for a cumulative prevalence of 0.4%. Viral infection occurred more frequently in males than in females (56.5% vs 39.7%), and the mean age ranged from 14 to 85 years. The most common symptoms were fever (48.3%), cough (46.5%), and diarrhea (20.5%), and a COVID-19 diagnosis was achieved mainly through polymerase chain reaction analysis of nasopharyngeal swabs (94.4%) and chest computed tomography scans (38.9%). Hydroxychloroquine (23.9%), lopinavir/ritonavir (8.2%), steroids (3.2%), and antibiotics (3.1%) were the most used drugs. Overall, approximately a third of patients were hospitalized (30.6%), and 11.4% of them required admission to the intensive care unit. In total, 29 COVID-19-related deaths were reported (3.8%), and increasing age and the presence of comorbidities were recognized as risk factors for COVID-19 and negative outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Diarrhea occurs more frequently in IBD patients with COVID-19 than in the non-IBD population. Further studies are needed to define the optimal diagnostic-therapeutic approach in IBD patients with COVID-19.","D039,; Amico, Ferdinando; Danese, Silvio; Peyrin-Biroulet, Laurent",Clin Gastroenterol Hepatol,462,16

A high background signal due to target interference was observed in our anti-REGN-Y antibody assay, and two different strategies were evaluated to mitigate this false-positive signal. Results: Multiple anti-target antibodies were tested and found to be ineffective at reducing target interference, so soluble target receptor and co-factor proteins were used in combination to inhibit the target-mediated signal. These competitive blockers synergistically inhibited target interference and increased target tolerance levels, especially when the assay was performed under mild acidic conditions. A separate approach, target immunodepletion using magnetic beads conjugated with an anti-target antibody, was also effective at mitigating the target-mediated signal, also in combination with mild acidic assay pH. Both methods allowed detection of a true ADA signal in monkey and human post-dose serum samples. Conclusion: These methods provide alternative strategies for mitigating target interference when standard anti-target antibodies are ineffective, with the competitive blocker method being recommended, if possible, due to its higher throughput and easier execution.","Chen, Jihua; Kendra, Kimberly; Torri, Albert; Sumner, Giane",Bioanal.

As of May 19th 2021, John Hopkins University's COVID-19 tracking platform has reported 3.3 million deaths associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Currently, the World Health Organization has granted emergency use listing (EUL) to six COVID-19 vaccines candidates. However much of the pathogenesis observed during SARS-CoV-2 infection remains elusive. To gain insight into the contribution of individual accessory open reading frame (ORF) proteins in SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis, we used our recently described reverse genetics system approach to successfully engineer recombinant (r)SARS-CoV-2, where we individually removed viral 3a, 6, 7a, 7b, and 8 ORF proteins, and characterized these recombinant viruses in vitro and in vivo. Our results indicate differences in plaque morphology, with ORF deficient (&#916;ORF) viruses producing smaller plaques than those of the wild-type (rSARS-CoV-2/WT). However, growth kinetics of &#916;ORF viruses were like those of rSARS-CoV-2/WT. Interestingly, infection of K18 human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) transgenic mice with the &#916;ORF rSARS-CoV-2 identified ORF3a and ORF6 as the major contributors of viral pathogenesis, while &#916;ORF7a, &#916;ORF7b and &#916;ORF8 rSARS-CoV-2 induced comparable pathology to rSARS-CoV-2/WT. This study demonstrates the robustness of our reverse genetics system to generate rSARS-CoV-2 and the major role for ORF3a and ORF6 in viral pathogenesis, providing important information for the generation of attenuated forms of SARS-CoV-2 for their implementation as live-attenuated vaccines for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection and associated COVID-19. IMPORTANCE Despite great efforts put forward worldwide to combat the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) continues to be a human health and socioeconomic threat. Insights into the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 and contribution of viral proteins to disease outcome remains elusive. Our study aims to determine the contribution of SARS-CoV-2 accessory open reading frame (ORF) proteins in viral pathogenesis and disease outcome, and develop a synergistic platform combining our robust reverse genetics system to generate recombinant (r)SARS-CoV-2 with a validated rodent model of infection and disease. We demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a and ORF6 contribute to lung pathology and ultimately disease outcome in K18 hACE2 transgenic mice, while ORF7a, ORF7b, and ORF8 have little impact on disease outcome. Moreover, our combinatory platform serves as the foundation to generate attenuated forms of the virus to develop live-attenuated vaccines for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2.","Silvas, Jesus A; Morales Vasquez, Desarey; Park, Jun-Gyu; Chiem, Kevin; Allué-Guardia, Anna; Garcia-Vilanova, Andreu; Platt, Roy Neal; Miorin, Lisa; Kehrer, Thomas; Cupic, Anastasija; Gonzalez-Reiche, Ana S; van Bakel, Harm; García-Sastre, Adolfo; Anderson, Tim; Torrelles, Jordi B; Ye, Chengjin; Martinez-Sobrido, Luis",J Virol,462,11

Disease outcomes range from asymptomatic to severe with, so far, minimal genotypic change to the virus so understanding the host response is paramount. Transcriptomics has become incredibly important in understanding host-pathogen interactions; however, post-transcriptional regulation plays an important role in infection and immunity through translation and mRNA stability, allowing tight control over potent host responses by both the host and the invading virus. Here, we apply ribosome profiling to assess post-transcriptional regulation of host genes during SARS-CoV-2 infection of a human lung epithelial cell line (Calu-3). We have identified numerous transcription factors (JUN, ZBTB20, ATF3, HIVEP2 and EGR1) as well as select antiviral cytokine genes, namely IFNB1, IFNL1,2 and 3, IL-6 and CCL5, that are restricted at the post-transcriptional level by SARS-CoV-2 infection and discuss the impact this would have on the host response to infection. This early phase restriction of antiviral transcripts in the lungs may allow high viral load and consequent immune dysregulation typically seen in SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Alexander, Marina R; Brice, Aaron M; Jansen van Vuren, Petrus; Rootes, Christina L; Tribolet, Leon; Cowled, Christopher; Bean, Andrew G D; Stewart, Cameron R",Int. j. mol. sci.

Méthodes Nous avons sélectionné les sujets hypertendus inclus dans l’étude nationale prospective de 3512 patients hospitalisés avec COVID-19 (cohorte French-COVID) jusqu’au 30 juin 2020. L’exposition était définie par la prescription d’inhibiteurs de l’enzyme de conversion ou antagonistes des récepteurs de l’angiotensine II avant hospitalisation. Des modèles de Cox avec pondérations basées sur le score de propension ont permis d’estimer des hazard ratios (HR) de mortalité à 30 jours du diagnostic de COVID-19 chez les sujets exposés aux ISRA par rapport aux non exposés.

The multimeric size and function of VWF are normally regulated through ADAMTS13-mediated proteolysis. OBJECTIVE: This study investigated the hypothesis that ADAMTS13 regulation of VWF multimer distribution may be impaired in SARS-CoV-2 infection contributing to the observed microvascular thrombosis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with COVID-19 (n=23) were recruited from the Beaumont Hospital Intensive Care Unit (ICU) in Dublin. Plasma VWF antigen, multimer distribution, ADAMTS-13 activity and known inhibitors thereof were assessed. RESULTS: We observed markedly increased VWF collagen-binding activity in patients with severe COVID-19 compared to controls (median 509.1 versus 94.3IU/dL). Conversely, plasma ADAMTS13 activity was significantly reduced (median 68.2IU/dL). In keeping with an increase in VWF:ADAMTS13 ratio, abnormalities in VWF multimer distribution were common in patients with COVID-19, with reductions in high molecular weight VWF multimers. Terminal sialylation regulates VWF susceptibility to proteolysis by ADAMTS13 and other proteases. We observed that both N- and O-linked sialylation were altered in severe COVID-19. Furthermore, plasma levels of the ADAMTS13 inhibitors interleukin-6, thrombospondin-1and platelet factor 4 were significantly elevated. CONCLUSIONS: These findings support the hypothesis that SARS-CoV-2 is associated with profound quantitative and qualitative increases in plasma VWF levels, and a multifactorial down-regulation in ADAMTS13 function. Further studies will be required to determine whether therapeutic interventions to correct ADAMTS13-VWF multimer dysfunction may be useful in COVID-microvascular thrombosis and angiopathy.","Ward, Soracha E; Fogarty, Helen; Karampini, Ellie; Lavin, Michelle; Schneppenheim, Sonja; Dittmer, Rita; Morrin, Hannah; Glavey, Siobhan; Ni Cheallaigh, Cliona; Bergin, Colm; Martin-Loeches, Ignacio; Mallon, Patrick W; Curley, Gerard F; Baker, Ross I; Budde, Ulrich; O039,; Sullivan, Jamie M; Donnell, James S",J. thromb. haemost,462,16

Nurses are the foundation of any healthcare system. Today, many of them are on the front line in the fight against COVID-19. Without nurses and other health professionals, the world will not win the fight against epidemics or pandemics or achieve the health potential of populations. AIM: The main purpose of this article is to draw attention to the heroic work of nurses and the role they have to fulfil in society. Their daily work, hardship and courage can be called heroism, especially when in times of epidemics or pandemics they risk their own lives to care for and support those most in need. CONCLUSION: The greatest heroes of today are health professionals, among whom nurses play a key role.

This study aims to assess the exposure to 10 phthalates, DINCH, and environmental phenols (3 BPs, 7 PBs, and TCS) of Slovenian men (n = 548) and lactating primiparous women (n = 536). We observed urinary concentrations comparable to studies from other countries and significant differences among the sub-populations. In our study, men had significantly higher levels of phthalates, DINCH, and BPs, whereas the concentrations of PBs in urine were significantly higher in women. The most significant determinant of exposure was the area of residence and the year of sampling (2008-2014) that mirrors trends in the market. Participants from urban or industrialized sampling locations had higher levels of almost all monitored analytes compared to rural locations. In an attempt to assess the risk of the population, hazard quotient (HQ) values were calculated for individual compounds and the chemical mixture. Individual analytes do not seem to pose a risk to the studied population at current exposure levels, whereas the HQ value of the chemical mixture is near the threshold of 1 which would indicate a higher risk. We conclude that greater emphasis on the risk resulting from cumulative exposure to chemical mixtures and additional studies are needed to estimate the exposure of susceptible populations, such as children.","Runkel, Agneta A; Mazej, Darja; Snoj Tratnik, Janja; Tkalec, Ziga; Kosjek, Tina; Horvat, Milena",Chemosphere,462,16

We also highlight how the government may provide the subsidy to support the above mentioned mobile service operation (MSO) to make it financially viable. We specifically show that the government may adopt the fixed-cost-subsidy (FCS) scheme, operations-cost-subsidy (OCS) scheme or safety-technology-support (STS) scheme to help. We further uncover that the OCS scheme would bring a larger consumer surplus than the FCS scheme and is hence more preferable. In the extended models, we first study the case when service fee cannot be changed because of corona virus outbreak (CVO). We then explore the feasibility of adopting MSO in the long run as a financially self-sustainable service operation and derive the analytical conditions under which MSO is a win-win business model for both the service provider and consumers.

Contrary to HLH, lymphocytopenia (11/13, 84.61%), leukocytosis (7/13, 53.84%), neutrophilia (7/13, 53.84%), and hyperfibrinogenemia (7/13, 53.84%) were observed. Serum CRP, LDH, and plasma D-dimer were elevated in all, while serum albumin was decreased in 12 of 13 (92.3%) patients. Five patients recovered with high-dose pulsed corticosteroid therapy. CONCLUSION: The immune response associated with severe COVID-19 infection is similar to HLH with few differences. HLH should be suspected in severe COVID-19 infection although all patients may not fulfill required HLH diagnostic criteria. BME should be done in suspected cases so that appropriate therapy may be initiated early.","Dandu, Himanshu; Yadav, Geeta; Malhotra, Hardeep Singh; Pandey, Saurabh; Sachu, Ruovinuo; Dubey, Kinjalk",Int. j. lab. hematol,462,29

Computed tomography (CT) has been described as a diagnostic modality in the COVID-19 diagnosis and treatment plan. We present a case series with virologically confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia. Variable CT features were observed: consolidation with ground-glass opacities, ground-glass opacities with subpleural reticular bands, and an anterior-posterior gradient of lung abnormalities resembling that of acute respiratory distress syndrome. Evolution of CT findings was observed in one patient, where there was interval resolution of bilateral lung consolidation with development of bronchiolectasis and subpleural fibrotic bands. While sensitive for detecting lung parenchymal abnormalities in COVID-19 pneumonia, the use of CT for initial diagnosis is discouraged and should be reserved for specific clinical indications. Interpretation of chest CT findings should be correlated with duration of symptoms to better determine the disease stage and aid in patient management.","Lim, Zhan Ye; Khoo, Hau Wei; Hui, Terrence Chi Hong; Kok, Shawn Shi Xian; Kwan, Kenneth Eng Ling; Young, Barnaby Edward; Tan, Cher Heng; Kaw, Gregory Jon Leng",Singapore Med J,462,33

Preliminary evidence from these patients, as well as past coronavirus epidemics, indicates that those infected suffer from disproportionate complement activation as well as excessive coagulation, leading to thrombotic complications and poor outcome. In non-coronavirus cohorts, evidence has accumulated of an interaction between the complement and coagulation systems, with one amplifying activation of the other. A pressing question is therefore if COVID-19 associated thrombosis could be caused by overactivation of the complement cascade? In this review, we summarize the literature on thrombotic complications in COVID-19, complement activation in coronavirus infections, and the crosstalk between the complement and coagulation systems. We demonstrate how the complement system is able to activate the coagulation cascade and platelets, inhibit fibrinolysis and stimulate endothelial cells. We also describe how these interactions see clinical relevance in several disorders where overactive complement results in a prothrombotic clinical presentation, and how it could be clinically relevant in COVID-19.","Fletcher-Sandersjöö, Alexander; Bellander, Bo-Michael",Thromb Res,462,25

AIMS: This study is aimed to summarize the existing data regarding anxiety, depression, and psychological distress during the covid-19 pandemic among the wider population so that effective intervention strategies will be initiated. METHODS: Pieces of literature that assessed anxiety, depression, and psychological distress among the general population during the COVID pandemic period were systematically gathered. Data extraction in Microsoft excel was done by two independent reviewers using predefined criteria. The analysis was done using a stata-11 and random effect model. A sub-group and sensitivity analysis was done. Besides, the funnel plot and eggers publication bias test was tested. RESULTS: Sixteen studies that assessed 78,225 participants were included. Nine studies were included in the meta-analysis for anxiety prevalence. The average prevalence of anxiety was found to be 38.12%. A sub-group analysis showed that anxiety was 33.33% in China and 47.70% in other countries (Italy, Turkey, and India). Anxiety prevalence in studies measured with the DASS-21 scale, GAD-7 scale, and other tools (SAS, HADS, and 5-point Likert scale) was 23.4%, 40.73%, and 44.47% respectively. The prevalence of anxiety in studies that assessed a sample size above 2,000 participants was 40.33%. The average prevalence of depression among included studies was 34.31% and a sub-group analysis showed that depression was higher in China (36.32%) than in other countries (28.3%). Moreover, six studies reported psychological distress and the average prevalence was 37.54%. CONCLUSION: This study revealed that anxiety, depression, and psychological distress are potential public mental health problems of the global community that suggests the need for early recognition and initiation of interventions during the COVID-19 pandemic period.","Necho, Mogesie; Tsehay, Mekonnen; Birkie, Mengesha; Biset, Gebyaw; Tadesse, Erkihun",Int J Soc Psychiatry,462,24

Little is known about the relationship between OVSARS2IgG ratio and neutralizing capacity of plasma/sera against genuine SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: Nine hundred eighty-one samples from 196 repeat CCP donors 0-119 days post-initial donation (DPID) were analyzed. Neutralizing capacity was assessed for 50% (PRNT50) and 90% (PRNT90) reduction of infectious virus using the gold standard plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT). A subset of 91 donations was evaluated by OVSARS2IgG and compared to PRNT titers for diagnostic accuracy. RESULTS: Of donations, 32.7%/79.5% (PRNT90/PRNT50) met a 1:80 titer initially but only 14.0%/48.8% (PRNT90/PRNT50) met this cutoffâ &#8805;85 DPID.

RESULTS: One hundred and four patients were included in the study, aged 67.4 (12.8), 43.3% female. Among them, 29 (27.9%) had headache.

In the comparison of the crude median values of cytokines, many cytokines were different between both groups. In the comparison of the central and dispersion parameters between the two groups, GROa, IL-10, IL1RA, IL-21, IL-22 remained statistically significant. After adjusting the values for age, sex, baseline situation and COVID-19 severity, IL-10 remained statistically significant (3.3 vs. 2.2 ng/dL, p = 0.042), with a trend towards significance in IL-23 (11.9 vs. 8.6 ng/dL, p = 0.082) and PIGF1 (1621.8 vs. 110.6 ng/dL, p = 0.071). CONCLUSIONS: The higher levels of IL-10 -an anti-inflammatory cytokine- found in our sample in patients with headache may be explained as a counteract of cytokine release, reflecting a more intense immune response in these patients.","Trigo, Javier; García-Azorín, David; Sierra-Mencía, Álvaro; Tamayo-Velasco, Álvaro; Martínez-Paz, Pedro; Tamayo, Eduardo; Guerrero, Angel Luis; Gonzalo-Benito, Hugo",J Headache Pain,462,29

Microbial association network inference is of great significance in applications on clinical diagnosis, disease treatment, pathological analysis, etc. However, most current network inference methods focus on mining strong pairwise associations between microorganisms, which is defective in reflecting the comprehensive interactive patterns participated by multiple microorganisms. It is also possible that the microorganisms involved in the generated network are not dominant in the microbiome due to the mere focus on the strength of pairwise associations. Some scholars tried to mine comprehensive microbial associations by association rule mining methods, but the adopted algorithms are relatively basic and have severe limitations such as low calculation efficiency, lacking the ability of mining negative correlations and high redundancy in results, making it difficult to mine high-quality microbial association rules and accurately infer microbial association networks. RESULTS: We proposed a microbial association network inference method ""MANIEA"" based on the improved Eclat algorithm for mining positive and negative microbial association rules. We also proposed a new method for transforming association rules into microbial association networks, which can effectively demonstrate the co-occurrence and causal correlations in association rules. An experiment was conducted on three authentic microbial abundance datasets to compare the ""MANIEA"" with currently popular network inference methods, which demonstrated that the proposed ""MANIEA"" show advantages in aspects of correlation forms, computation efficiency, adjustability, and network characteristics.

The consequences of this crisis largely impact children and teenagers, both now and in the future. School closures have particularly affected vulnerable children, deepening the effects of their unequal socio-economic circumstances. In this context, the actions governments are taking to protect their citizens' right to education will be crucial to reducing or exacerbating inequality in the long term. The authors of this article analyse the case of Chile, one of the most successful countries in Latin America regarding educational achievement and enrolment, as well as the most segregated educational system among member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). How is the right to education being guaranteed for all during the COVID-19 pandemic? Are the measures taken by the Ministry of Education mitigating or intensifying long-term inequalities? Based on the 4-A scheme described by Katarina Tomasevski, which conceptualises national governments' obligations to guarantee the right to education, the authors examine the normative basis of Chile's market-oriented educational system (1980-2013) as well as the latest educational reform (2014-2017), which aimed to promote the right to quality education, and critically analyse the measures adopted by the Chilean Ministry of Education in response to the pandemic. The authors conclude that Chile is facing a major challenge to ensure the right to education for all.

The TOMM40 '523' allele length was determined in 634 people with PD and 422 healthy controls from an Australian cohort and the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) cohort, using polymerase chain reaction or whole genome sequencing analysis. Genotype and allele frequencies of TOMM40 '523' and APOE Îµ did not differ significantly between the cohorts. Analyses revealed TOMM40 '523' allele groups were not associated with disease risk, while considering APOE Îµ genotype. Regression analyses revealed the TOMM40 S/S genotype was associated with a significantly later age of symptom onset in the PPMI PD cohort, but not after correction for covariates, or in the Australian cohort. Whilst variation in the TOMM40 '523' polymorphism was not associated with PD risk, the possibility that it may be a modifying factor for age of symptom onset warrants further investigation in other PD populations.","Bakeberg, Megan C; Hoes, Madison E; Gorecki, Anastazja M; Theunissen, Frances; Pfaff, Abigail L; Kenna, Jade E; Plunkett, Kai; Kõks, Sulev; Akkari, P Anthony; Mastaglia, Frank L; Anderton, Ryan S",Sci Rep,462,16

This study assessed the association of ACE-I/ARB therapy with the development of severe COVID-19. METHODS: This multi-center, prospective study enrolled patients hospitalized for COVID-19 and receiving one or more antihypertensive agents to manage either hypertension or cardiovascular disease. ACE-I/ARB therapy associations with severe COVID-19 on the day of hospitalization, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, mechanical ventilation and in-hospital death on follow-up were tested using a multivariate logistic regression model adjusted for age, obesity, and chronic illnesses. The composite outcome of mechanical ventilation and death was examined using the adjusted Cox multivariate regression model. RESULTS: Of 338 enrolled patients, 245 (72.4%) were using ACE-I/ARB on the day of hospital admission, and 197 continued ACE-I/ARB therapy during hospitalization. Ninety-eight (29%) patients had a severe COVID-19, which was not significantly associated with the use of ACE-I/ARB (OR 1.17, 95% CI 0.66-2.09; P = .57). Prehospitalization ACE-I/ARB therapy was not associated with ICU admission, mechanical ventilation, or in-hospital death. Continuing ACE-I/ARB therapy during hospitalization was associated with decreased mortality (OR 0.22, 95% CI 0.073-0.67; P = .008). ACE-I/ARB use was not associated with developing the composite outcome of mechanical ventilation and in-hospital death (HR 0.95, 95% CI 0.51-1.78; P = .87) versus not using ACE-I/ARB. CONCLUSION: Patients with hypertension or cardiovascular diseases receiving ACE-I/ARB therapy are not at increased risk for severe COVID-19 on admission to the hospital. ICU admission, mechanical ventilation, and mortality are not associated with ACE-I/ARB therapy. Maintaining ACE-I/ARB therapy during hospitalization for COVID-19 lowers the likelihood of death.

Our aim was to determine the real-life clinical sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR. METHODS: This population-based retrospective study was conducted in March-April 2020 in the Helsinki Capital Region, Finland. Adults who were clinically suspected of SARS-CoV-2 infection and underwent SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR testing, with sufficient data in their medical records for grading of clinical suspicion were eligible. In addition to examining the first RT-PCR test of repeat-tested individuals, we also used high clinical suspicion for COVID-19 as the reference standard for calculating the sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR. RESULTS: All 1,194 inpatients (mean [SD] age, 63.2 [18.3] years; 45.2% women) admitted to COVID-19 cohort wards during the study period were included. The outpatient cohort of 1,814 individuals (mean [SD] age, 45.4 [17.2] years; 69.1% women) was sampled from epidemiological line lists by systematic quasi-random sampling. The sensitivity (95% CI) for laboratory confirmed cases (repeat-tested patients) was 85.7% (81.5-89.1%) inpatients; 95.5% (92.2-97.5%) outpatients, 89.9% (88.2-92.1%) all. When also patients that were graded as high suspicion but never tested positive were included in the denominator, the sensitivity (95% CI) was: 67.5% (62.9-71.9%) inpatients; 34.9% (31.4-38.5%) outpatients; 47.3% (44.4-50.3%) all. CONCLUSIONS: The clinical sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR testing was only moderate at best.

In Sierra Leone, one of the three most affected countries, more than14,000 people got infected and almost 4,000 died. Risk communication and social mobilization efforts aimed to engage with the public and to educate people to prevent further transmission of the virus. Not much is known how being exposed to this type of information influenced people's knowledge, behaviors and risk perception around Ebola. Misinformation in the Ebola outbreak was widespread, but effective methods to counter real-life infectious disease misinformation have not been studied in a low-income setting.Aims: To determine the role of risk communication in the Ebola outbreak in Sierra Leone and to test the effectiveness of methods to debunk misinformation about infectious diseases.Methods: Four nationwide cross-sectional surveys among the general population of Sierra Leone were carried out at different timepoints of the Ebola outbreak (August 2014, n=1,413;October 2014, n=2,087;December 2014, n=3,540;July 2015, n=3,564). The four surveys were pooled (n=10,604) and the associations between exposure to various information sources and Ebola-specific knowledge, misconceptions, protective behavior and risk behavior were assessed using multilevel modeling. The associations between exposure to information sources and the perceived susceptibility to Ebola (i.e. risk perception), as well as the associations between Ebola-specific knowledge, misconceptions, behaviors and risk perception were measured in the pooled sample of the first three surveys (n=7,039).Qualitative, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 13 Sierra Leonean journalists who reported during the outbreak. Using thematic analysis, their perceived roles were mapped. After the epidemic, a three-arm, prospective, randomized controlled trial (RCT)(n=736) was carried out among adults in Freetown who were in possession of a smartphone with WhatsApp, to test whether 4-episode audio drama interventions could reduce the belief in typhoid-related misinformation.Results: Exposure to information sources was associated with increased Ebola-specific knowledge and protective behavior, but also - to a smaller extent - with misconceptions and risk behavior. Exposure to new media (e.g. mobile phones, internet) and community sources(e.g. religious/traditional leaders) as well as having Ebola-specific knowledge and engaging in frequent hand washing, was associated with increased risk perception. Having Ebola-specific misconceptions and avoiding burials on the other hand, was associated with lower risk perception (Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR) 0.7, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) 0.6-0.8 and AOR 0.8, 95% CI 0.6-1.0, respectively). Sierra Leonean journalists adopted various roles over the course of the outbreak;from being skeptical about the existence of an outbreak, to being eye-witnesses themselves. Through training about the virus, they later turned in to public mobilizers and instructors, stepping away from their journalistic independence. Results from the RCT showed that the audio drama interventions significantly reduced the belief in typhoid-related misinformation compared to the control group. In Intervention Group A (in which the audio dramas actively engaged with the misinformation) and in Intervention Group5B (where only the correct information was given), the belief that typhoid always co-occurs with malaria was significantly reduced (Intervention Group A: AOR 0.3, 95% CI 0.2-0.5,Intervention Group B: AOR 0.6, 95% CI 0.4-0.8). Actively engaging with the misinformation, instead of only focusing on the correct information, resulted in the largest reductions in belief in misinformation.

Here, we present a study providing preliminary support for the usefulness and validity of a self-other facial morphing task to capture the capacity for SOD in a sample of nonclinical participants high (n = 30) and low (n = 32) in BPD features. Participants had to watch a video sequence in which their own face was gradually morphed into the face of an unfamiliar other (self-to-other) or vice versa (other-to-self), requiring them to indicate at which point they judged the morph to look more like the target face than the starting face. Consistent with predictions, results showed that participants in the high-BPD group judged the morph to look like themselves for longer in the self-to-other direction (suggestive of egocentric bias), but only with a relatively more attractive target face. In the other-to-self direction, the high-BPD group had more difficulty recognizing their own face (i.e., an altercentric bias), but this time only with the relatively less attractive face. Further research is needed to replicate these findings in clinical samples, but overall they suggest that the current task might be suited to investigate SOD problems in BPD.

Using mechanistic mathematical models, we show how simple manipulations to population structure can exogenously impose Darwinian-like properties on communities. Such scaffolding causes communities to participate directly in the process of evolution by natural selection and drives the evolution of cell-level interactions to the point where, despite underlying stochasticity, derived communities give rise to offspring communities that faithfully re-establish parental phenotype. The mechanism is akin to a developmental process (developmental correction) that arises from density dependent interactions among cells. Knowledge of ecological factors affecting evolution of developmental correction has implications for understanding the evolutionary origin of major egalitarian transitions, symbioses, and for top-down engineering of microbial communities.","Doulcier, Guilhem; Lambert, Amaury; De Monte, Silvia; Rainey, Paul B",eLife (Cambridge),462,29

Surgical treatment of non-COVID-19 related disease during this period, however, still remains necessary. The decision to proceed with medically necessary, time-sensitive (MeNTS) procedures in the setting of the COVID-19 pandemic requires incorporation of factors (resource limitations, COVID-19 transmission risk to providers and patients) heretofore not overtly considered by surgeons in the already complicated processes of clinical judgment and shared decision-making. We describe a scoring system that systematically integrates these factors to facilitate decision-making and triage for MeNTS procedures, and appropriately weighs individual patient risks with the ethical necessity of optimizing public health concerns. This approach is applicable across a broad range of hospital settings (academic and community, urban and rural) in the midst of the pandemic and may be able to inform case triage as operating room capacity resumes once the acute phase of the pandemic subsides.","Prachand, Vivek N; Milner, Ross; Angelos, Peter; Posner, Mitchell C; Fung, John J; Agrawal, Nishant; Jeevanandam, Valluvan; Matthews, Jeffrey B",J Am Coll Surg,462,16

The clinical information in caring of critically ill patients with COVID-19 needs to be shared timely, especially under the situations that there is still a largely ongoing spread of COVID-19 in many countries. METHODS: A multicenter prospective observational study investigated all the COVID-19 patients received in 19 ICUs of 16 hospitals in Wuhan, China, over 24 h between 8 AM February 2h and 8 AM February 27, 2020. The demographic information, clinical characteristics, vital signs, complications, laboratory values, and clinical managements of the patients were studied. RESULTS: A total of 226 patients were included. Their median (interquartile range, IQR) age was 64 (57-70) years, and 139 (61.5%) patients were male. The duration from the date of ICU admission to the study date was 11 (5-17) days, and the duration from onset of symptoms to the study date was 31 (24-36) days. Among all the patients, 155 (68.6%) had at least one coexisting disease, and their sequential organ failure assessment score was 4 (2-8). Organ function damages were found in most of the patients: ARDS in 161 (71.2%) patients, septic shock in 34 (15.0%) patients, acute kidney injury occurred in 57 (25.2%) patients, cardiac injury in 61 (27.0%) patients, and lymphocytopenia in 160 (70.8%) patients. Of all the studied patients, 85 (37.6%) received invasive mechanical ventilation, including 14 (6.2%) treated with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) at the same time, 20 (8.8%) received noninvasive mechanical ventilation, and 24 (10.6%) received continuous renal replacement therapy. By April 9, 2020, 87 (38.5%) patients were deceased and 15 (6.7%) were still in the hospital. CONCLUSIONS: Critically ill patients with COVID-19 are associated with a higher risk of severe complications and need to receive an intensive level of treatments. COVID-19 poses a great strain on critical care resources in hospitals. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Chinese Clinical Trial Registry, ChiCTR2000030164.

Discussion includes accounting for differential impacts of COVID‐19 on demand for food across sociodemographic characteristics, and several high‐level issues and observations related to where and how consumers shop and what they buy. My own thinking leads me to conclude that demand‐side factors will account for most of the changes we see in retail food market.

Simulation training may enhance skills, but simulators must be accurate enough for trainees to engage in a realistic way-for example, detection of excessive injection pressure. The soft-embalmed Thiel cadaver is a life-like, durable simulator that is used for dedicated practice and mastery learning training in regional anesthesia. We hypothesized that injection opening pressure in perineural tissue, at epineurium and in subepineurium were similar to opening pressures measured in experimental animals, fresh frozen cadavers, glycol soft-fix cadavers and patients. METHODS: We systematically reviewed historical data, then conducted three validation studies delivering a 0.5 mL hydrolocation bolus of embalming fluid and recording injection pressure. First, we delivered the bolus at 12 mL/min at epimysium, perineural tissue, epineurium and in subepineurium at 48 peripheral nerve sites on three cadavers. Second, we delivered the bolus at using three infusion rates: 1 mL/min, 6 mL/min and 12 mL/min on epineurium at 70 peripheral nerve sites on five cadavers. Third, we repeated three injections (12 mL/min) at 24 epineural sites over the median and sciatic nerves of three cadavers. RESULTS: Mean (95%) injection pressure was greater at epineurium compared with subepineurium (geometric ratio 1.2 (95% CI: 0.9 to 1.6)), p=0.04, and perineural tissue (geometric ratio 5.1 (95% CI: 3.7 to 7.0)), p<0.0001. Mean (95%) injection pressure was greater at 12 mL/min compared with 1 mL/min (geometric ratio 1.6 (95% CI: 1.2 to 2.1), p=0.005). Pressure measurements were similar in study 3 (p>0.05 for all comparisons). DISCUSSION: We conclude that the soft-embalmed Thiel cadaver is a realistic simulator of injection opening pressure.","McLeod, Graeme; Zihang, Shengli; Sadler, Amy; Chandra, Anu; Qiao, Panpan; Huang, Zhihong; Demore, Christine",Reg Anesth Pain Med,462,16

Apart from being a major hurdle to delivery of basic healthcare services, this may be associated with potential harm for cancer patients. Usually being immunocompromised, cancer patients are at a higher risk of contracting the disease and with hospitals being a potential source of the infection, an urgent need to reorganise the structure of delivery of cancer care is essential. Cancer departments must balance patient care whilst also minimising transmission among patients and healthcare professionals. The Oxford Sarcoma Service was re-structured based on the guidelines issued by the National Health Service (NHS) and the British Orthopaedic Oncology Society (BOOS) to deliver unhindered care to patients. Prioritising patients who needed urgent surgery, weighing the risk-benefit ratio while delivering adjuvant treatments and conducting regular virtual multi-disciplinary team (MDT) meetings combined with personal protection equipment (PPE) usage by all involved healthcare workers were salient features in terms of ensuring the delivery of effective care during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our new model of modus operandi during this global crisis was effective in delivering high standard of care to patients and might serve as a guide to similar units managing bone and soft tissue tumours.","Rajasekaran, Raja Bhaskara; Whitwell, Duncan; Cosker, Thomas D.A; Gibbons, Christopher L.M.H",J.

Accurate outcome prognostication could facilitate hospital resource allocation. We develop and validate predictive models for each outcome using retrospective electronic health record data for COVID-19 patients treated between March 2 and May 6, 2020. MATERIALS AND METHODS: For each outcome, we trained 3 classes of prediction models using clinical data for a cohort of SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2)-positive patients (n = 2256). Cross-validation was used to select the best-performing models per the areas under the receiver-operating characteristic and precision-recall curves. Models were validated using a held-out cohort (n = 855). We measured each model's calibration and evaluated feature importances to interpret model output. RESULTS: The predictive performance for our selected models on the held-out cohort was as follows: area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve-MV 0.743 (95% CI, 0.682-0.812), RRT 0.847 (95% CI, 0.772-0.936), readmission 0.871 (95% CI, 0.830-0.917); area under the precision-recall curve-MV 0.137 (95% CI, 0.047-0.175), RRT 0.325 (95% CI, 0.117-0.497), readmission 0.504 (95% CI, 0.388-0.604). Predictions were well calibrated, and the most important features within each model were consistent with clinical intuition. DISCUSSION: Our models produce performant, well-calibrated, and interpretable predictions for COVID-19 patients at risk for the target outcomes. They demonstrate the potential to accurately estimate outcome prognosis in resource-constrained care sites managing COVID-19 patients. CONCLUSIONS: We develop and validate prognostic models targeting MV, RRT, and readmission for hospitalized COVID-19 patients which produce accurate, interpretable predictions.

These complementary non-financial ESG scores should provide information about the ESG performance and risks of different companies. However, the extent of missing information makes the reliability of ESG scores questionable. To account for the missing information in the underlying ESG pillars, we introduce a new pillar, the so-called Missing (M-) pillar, and propose an optimization approach to compute new ESG (ESGM) scores, which should also be related to the company riskiness. As a result, the ESGM scores allow for incorporating the extent of missing information and establishing some meaningful relationship with respect to the riskiness of the companies under consideration.

For some women this decision-making can be associated with anxiety. AIM: To provide rich, surface level descriptions by exploring women's experiences of their involvement in decision-making during a subsequent pregnancy after a previous caesarean birth. METHODS: A descriptive qualitative study was performed between May 2018 and February 2019 using Braun and Clarke's in steps guided analysis. Pregnant women with a previous caesarean birth, receiving antenatal care at a tertiary maternity hospital in Western Australia, and self-reported low to moderate levels of anxiety were invited to participate in a telephone interview. FINDINGS: Women's (n = 17) experiences revealed four themes: 1) Learning from past experiences (two sub-themes loss of control and coming to terms), 2) Claiming ownership in decisions (two sub-themes challenging professional judgement and prioritising needs wishes and preferences), 3) Being empowered (three sub-themes getting a full picture, speaking out, and not just the baby or a number), 4) Moving forward (two sub-themes building trust in health professionals and establishing guardrails to minimise loss of control). DISCUSSION: Women's experiences around decision-making in a subsequent pregnancy can vary according to whether their fears and anxieties are acknowledged and addressed. Women who are informed, and receive support and respect are empowered to move forward. CONCLUSION: Continuity of care may provide women with more opportunities to build trusting relationships with clinicians and be truly known as an individual with unique preferences and desires.","Chan, Maria Hakyung; Hauck, Yvonne; Kuliukas, Lesley; Lewis, Lucy",,462,10

DISCUSSION: Understanding the potential triggers and vulnerability factors can inform the development of institutional resources that would help minimize their impact, reducing the risk of psychological morbidity.","Kovner, Christine; Raveis, Victoria H; Van Devanter, Nancy; Yu, Gary; Glassman, Kimberly; Ridge, Laura Jean",Nurs. outlook,462,1

Elucidation of the kinetics and duration of the humoral response is important for clinical management and interpreting results from serological surveys. OBJECTIVES: Here we evaluated the clinical performance of Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG assays, as well as the longitudinal dynamics of the antibody response in symptomatic COVID-19 patients. STUDY DESIGN AND RESULTS: The diagnostic specificity was 100 % for IgM and 99.67 % for IgG using 300 pre-COVID-19 serum specimens. Using 1349 sequential serum samples collected up to 168 days post symptom onset from 427 PCR-confirmed individuals, clinical test sensitivity of the SARS-CoV-2 IgM assay was 24.6 % at &#8804;7 days, 75.3 % at 8-14 days, 95.0 % at 15-21 days, and 96.0 % at 4-5 weeks (peak test sensitivity). The median duration of time for IgM seroconversion was 10 days. IgM levels declined steadily 4-5 weeks after symptom onset, and the positive rate dropped to 30.8 % at >3 months. The diagnostic sensitivity for the SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay post symptom onset was 23.2 % at &#8804;7 days, 69.5 % at 8-14 days, 93.6 % at 15-21 days, and 99.6 % at 4-5 weeks (peak test sensitivity). The median duration of time for IgG seroconversion was 11.5 days. During the convalescent phase of the infection, a decline in the IgG level was observed in patients who were followed for >100 days. Despite that decline, 92.3 % of the patient cohort remained IgG positive 3-6 months following symptom onset. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the Abbott IgM assay against SARS-CoV-2 is detected slightly earlier compared to IgG, with both tests exhibiting excellent overall sensitivity and specificity. In symptomatic patients who test negative by PCR for a SARS-CoV-2 infection, assessing IgM and IgG antibodies can aid in supporting a diagnosis of COVID-19.","Maine, Gabriel N; Lao, Kriselle Maris; Krishnan, Subhashree Mallika; Afolayan-Oloye, Olabisi; Fatemi, Seyedalireza; Kumar, Sandeep; VanHorn, Lindsay; Hurand, Ashley; Sykes, Elizabeth; Sun, Qian",J Clin Virol,462,29

An altered splicing of lamin A, known as progerin, causes the disease Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome. Progerin-expressing cells have altered nuclear shapes and stiffened nuclear lamina with microaggregates of progerin. Here, progerin microaggregate inclusions in the lamina are shown to lead to cellular and multicellular dysfunction. We show with Comsol simulations that stiffened inclusions causes redistribution of normally homogeneous forces, and this redistribution is dependent on the stiffness difference and relatively independent of inclusion size. We also show mechanotransmission changes associated with progerin expression in cells under confinement and cells under external forces. Endothelial cells expressing progerin do not align properly with patterning. Fibroblasts expressing progerin do not align properly to applied cyclic force. Combined, these studies show that altered nuclear lamina mechanics and microstructure impacts cytoskeletal force transmission through the cell.","Danielsson, Brooke E; Tieu, Katie V; Bathula, Kranthidhar; Armiger, Travis J; Vellala, Pragna S; Taylor, Rebecca E; Dahl, Kris Noel; Conway, Daniel E",Nucleus,462,21

DESIGN: Rapid review. DATA SOURCES: Ovid Medline, Ovid Embase, Ovid Global Health, Scopus, Web of Science Core Collection, and WHO Global Index Medicus, searched from inception to 14 Mar 2020. Search strategies applied the CADTH database guidelines search filter, with no limits applied to search results. Further studies were identified through searches of grey literature using the ISARIC network. INCLUSION CRITERIA: Clinical guidelines for the management of covid-19, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) produced by international and national scientific organisations and government and non-governmental organisations relating to global health were included, with no exclusions for language. Regional/hospital guidelines were excluded. Only the earliest version of any guideline was included. QUALITY ASSESSMENT: Quality was assessed using the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE) II tool. The quality and contents of early covid-19 guidelines were also compared with recent clinical guidelines for MERS and SARS. RESULTS: 2836 studies were identified, of which 2794 were excluded after screening. Forty two guidelines were considered eligible for inclusion, with 18 being specific to covid-19. Overall, the clinical guidelines lacked detail and covered a narrow range of topics. Recommendations varied in relation to, for example, the use of antiviral drugs. The overall quality was poor, particularly in the domains of stakeholder involvement, applicability, and editorial independence. Links between evidence and recommendations were limited. Minimal provision was made for vulnerable groups such as pregnant women, children, and older people. CONCLUSIONS: Guidelines available early in the covid-19 pandemic had methodological weaknesses and neglected vulnerable groups such as older people.

Although the respiratory system is the main apparatus involved by the infection, several other organs may suffer coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-related injuries. The human tissues expressing angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) are all possible targets of viral damage. In fact myocarditis, meningo-encephalitis, acute kidney injury and other complications have been described with regard to SARS-CoV-2 infection. The liver has a central role in the body homeostasis contributing to detoxification, catabolism and also synthesis of important factor such as plasma proteins. ACE2 is significantly expressed just by cholangiocytes within the liver, however transaminases are increased in more than one third of COVID-19 patients, at hospital admission. The reasons for liver impairment in the course of this infection are not completely clear at present and multiple factors such as: Direct viral effect, release of cytokines, ischemic damage, use of hepatotoxic drugs, sepsis, and others, may contribute to damage. While COVID-19 seems to elicit just a transient alteration of liver function tests in subjects with normal hepatic function, of concern, more severe sequelae are frequently observed in patients with a reduced hepatic reserve. In this review we report data regarding SARS-CoV-2 infection in subjects with normal or diseased liver.

Genetically, it is considered the second largest genome of all RNA viruses with a 5' cap and 3' poly-A tail. Phylogenetic analyses of coronaviruses reveal that SARS-CoV-2 is genetically closely related to the Bat-SARS Like-Corona virus (Bat-SL-Cov) with 96% whole-genome identity. SARS-CoV-2 genome consists of 15 ORFs coded into 29 proteins. At the 5' terminal of the genome, we have ORF1ab and ORF1a, which encode the 1ab and 1a polypeptides that are proteolytically cleaved into 16 different nonstructural proteins (NSPs). The 3' terminal of the genome represents four structural (spike, envelope, matrix, and nucleocapsid) and nine accessory (3a, 3b, 6, 7a, 7b, 8b, 9a, 9b, and orf10) proteins. As the number of COVID-19 patients increases dramatically worldwide, there is an urgent need to find a quick and sensitive diagnostic tool for controlling the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 in the community.

Detailed information on serious injuries, injury mechanisms and consequences are needed. The aim of this study was to describe and compare by injury mechanism the demographics, injuries, injury severity, and treatment of seriously injured road traffic trauma patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We analysed data on severe traffic injury trauma patients aged &#8805;16 years of the Helsinki Trauma Registry (HTR) covering the years 2009-2018. The variables analysed were basic patient demographics, injury mechanism, Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) codes, injured body regions, patient Injury Severity Score (ISS) and New Injury Severity Score (NISS) values, NISS groups (NISS 16-24 and NISS &#8805;25), AIS 3+ injuries, trauma bay and 30-day mortality, length of stay (LOS) at ICU and in hospital, surgeries performed, pre-injury classification, and intention of injury. RESULTS: A total of 1 063 traffic injury patients were analysed; 38.6% were motor vehicle occupants, 28.5% motorcyclists or moped drivers, 17.2% bicyclists, and 15.7% pedestrians. The mean age of patients was 44.3 years (SD 20.2). Median ISS score was 22 and median NISS score was 27. Both scores were highest in pedestrians. Among all patients, total hospital LOS was 12 517 days (median 9) and total ICU LOS was 6 311 days (median 5). The most common AIS 3+ injuries according to ISS body regions were chest injuries (60%) and head or neck injuries (43.7%). Chest injuries occurred more frequently in motorcyclists and motor vehicle occupants, whereas head or neck injuries were most common among bicyclists and pedestrians. CONCLUSIONS: Severely injured pedestrians and bicyclists were older and they had higher mortality than motorcyclists and motor vehicle occupants. According to NISS, the overall severity was highest among pedestrians followed by bicyclists. However, the both median ICU LOS and hospital LOS were highest for pedestrians but lowest for bicyclists. The most common AIS 3+ injuries were chest and head or neck injuries.

Hormone replacement therapy is an effective treatment for post-menopausal OP, but estrogen has poor tissue selectivity and severe side effects. RESULTS: In this study, we constructed a poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) nanoparticles (NPs)-based drug delivery system to co-load 17ß estradiol (E2) and iron oxide (Fe3O4) together, modified with alendronate (AL) to achieve bone targeting and realize a magnetically remote-controllable drug release. The NPs were fabricated through the emulsion solvent diffusion method. The particle size was approximately 200 nm while the encapsulation efficiency of E2 was 58.34 ± 9.21%. The NPs were found to be spherical with a homogenous distribution of particle size. The NPs showed good stability, good biocompatibility, high encapsulation ability of E2 and excellent magnetic properties. The NPs could be effectively taken up by Raw 264.7 cells and were effective in enriching drugs in bone tissue. The co-loaded NPs exposed to an external magnetic field ameliorated OVX-induced bone loss through increased BV/TV, decreased Tb.N and Tb.Sp, improved bone strength, increased PINP and OC, and downregulated CTX and TRAP-5b. The haematological index and histopathological analyses displayed the NPs had less side effects on non-skeletal tissues. CONCLUSIONS: This study presented a remote-controlled release system based on bone-targeted multifunctional NPs and a new potential approach to bone-targeted therapy of OP.","Guo, Yuanyuan; Liu, Yongwei; Shi, Chen; Wu, Tingting; Cui, Yongzhi; Wang, Siyuan; Liu, Ping; Feng, Xiaobo; He, Yu; Fu, Dehao",J Nanobiotechnology,462,18

METHODS: We downloaded the full-length genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 from the databases of GISAID and NCBI. Using the software for bioinformatics including MEGA-X, BEAST, and TempEst, we constructed the genomic evolution tree, inferred the time evolution signal of the virus, calculated the tMRCA time of the virus and analyzed the selection pressure of the virus during evolution. RESULTS: The phylogenetic tree showed that SARS-CoV-2 belonged to the Sarbecovirus subgenus of ß Coronavirus genus together with bat coronavirus BetaCoV/bat/Yunnan/RaTG13/2013, bat-SL-CoVZC45, bat-SL-CoVZXC21 and SARS-CoV. The genomic sequences of SARS-CoV-2 isolated from the ongoing epidemic showed a weak time evolution signal with an average tMRCA time of 73 days (95% CI: 38.9-119.3 days). No positive time evolution signal was found between SARS-CoV-2 and BetaCoV/bat/Yunnan/RaTG13/2013, but the former virus had a strong positive temporal evolution relationship with bat-SL-CoVZC45 and SARS-CoV. The major cause for mutations of SARS-CoV-2 was the pressure of purification selection during the epidemic. CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 may have emerged as early as November, 2019, originating most likely from bat-associated coronavirus. This finding may provide evidence for tracing the sources and evolution of the virus.","Zhou, Yezhen; Zhang, Shihao; Chen, Jiayi; Wan, Chengsong; Zhao, Wei; Zhang, Bao",Nan Fang Yi Ke Da Xue Xue Bao,462,27

That is the approximation of possibly low regular and noised functions from the knowledge of their approximate values given at some random points. Our proposed scheme is based on the use of the pseudo-inverse of a random projection matrix, combined with some specific properties of the Jacobi polynomials system, as well as some properties of positive definite random matrices. This scheme has the advantages to be stable, robust, accurate and fairly fast in terms of execution time. Moreover and unlike most of the existing nonparametric regression estimators, no extra regularization step is required by our proposed estimator. Although, this estimator is initially designed to work with random sampling set of uni-variate i.i.d. random variables following a Beta distribution, we show that it is still work for a wide range of sampling distribution laws. Moreover, we briefly describe how our estimator can be adapted in order to handle the multivariate case of random sampling sets. In the second part of this work, we extend the random pseudo-inverse scheme technique to build a stable and accurate estimator for solving linear functional regression (LFR) problems. A dyadic decomposition approach is used to construct this last stable estimator for the LFR problem. The performance of the two proposed estimators are illustrated by various numerical simulations. In particular, a real dataset is used to illustrate the performance of our nonparametric regression estimator.","Saber, Asma Ben; Karoui, Abderrazek",,462,17

Resources were reallocated. Patients with COVID-19 still required instrumented spinal surgery for emergencies. Clinical outcomes for these patients are not known. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of COVID-19 on perioperative morbidity and mortality for patients undergoing emergency instrumented spinal surgery and to determine risk factors for increased morbidity/mortality. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included 11 patients who were negative for COVID-19 and 8 patients who were positive for COVID-19 who underwent emergency instrumented spinal surgery in 1 hospital in the United Kingdom during the pandemic peak. Data collection was performed through case note review. Patients in both treatment groups were comparable for age, sex, body mass index (BMI), comorbidities, surgical indication, and preoperative neurologic status. Predefined perioperative outcomes were recorded within a 30-day postoperative period. Univariable analysis was used to identify risk factors for increased morbidity. RESULTS: There were no mortalities in either treatment group. Four patients positive for COVID-19 (50%) developed a complication compared with 6 (55%) in the COVID-19-negative group (P > 0.05). The commonest complication in both groups was respiratory infection. Three patients positive for COVID-19 (37.5%) required intensive care unit admission, compared with 4 (36%) in the COVID-19-negative group (P > 0.05). The average time between surgery and discharge was 19 and 10 days in COVID-19-positive and -negative groups, respectively (P = 0.02). In the COVID-19 positive group, smoking, abnormal BMI, preoperative oxygen requirement, presence of fever, and oxygen saturations <95% correlated with increased risk of complications. CONCLUSIONS: Emergency instrumented spinal surgery in patients positive for COVID-19 was associated with increased length of hospital stay. There was no difference in occurrence of complications or intensive care unit admission. Risk factors for increased morbidity in patients with COVID-19 included smoking, abnormal BMI, preoperative oxygen requirement, fever and saturations <95%.","Sewell, Mathew; Rasul, Fahid; Vachhani, Kathak; Sedra, Fady; Aftab, Syed; Pushpananthan, Suresh; Bull, Jonathan; Ranganathan, Arun; Montgomery, Alex",World Neurosurg,462,16

Accumulative studies suggest that nurses were more likely to develop negative psychiatric outcomes following a public health disaster than other medical staffs, due to their more frequent and closer contact with patients. We examined the psychological status of nurses working in the tertiary women's and children's hospitals in Sichuan, China, in order to explore the possible effect of the COVID-19. The cross-sectional survey was conducted at the peak period of COVID-19 among 1971 nurses. Their anxiety, depression and self-efficacy were assessed by the seven-item anxiety scale (GAD-7), the nine-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), and the General Self-efficacy Scale (GSES), respectively. 1934 valid questionnaires were returned with a response rate of 98.1%. We found that 29.3% and 22.7% of the nurses were identified with anxiety and depressive symptoms, respectively. The median score of GSES was 30, which was at the upper middle level among all populations. Nurses having longer working years and cold-like symptoms, those who were at work during breakout period and working in pediatric ward were significantly associated with the presence of anxiety and depression. Findings suggest that the epidemic of COVID-19 does not necessarily affect the psychological health of nurses working in women's and children's hospitals in Sichuan. The results of this study could serve as valuable suggestions to direct the promotion of psychological well-being among targeted nurses.","He, Qiuyang; Ren, Jianhua; Wang, Guoyu; Zhang, Jinling; Xiang, Jie; He, Dongning",Int J Disaster Risk Reduct,462,22

The model treats the populations of cells and authorities of districts as agents, such that the former can reduce their economic activity and the latter can recommend economic activity reduction both with the overall goal to slow down the epidemic spreading. The agents make decisions with the aim of attaining as high socio-economic standings as possible relative to other agents of the same type by evaluating their standings based on the local and regional infection rates, compliance to the authorities' regulations, regional drops in economic activity, and efforts to mitigate the spread of epidemic. We find that the willingness of population to comply with authorities' recommendations has the most drastic effect on the epidemic spreading: periodic waves spread almost unimpeded in non-compliant populations, while in compliant ones the spread is minimal with chaotic spreading pattern and significantly lower infection rates. Health and economic concerns of agents turn out to have lesser roles, the former increasing their efforts and the latter decreasing them.","Snellman, Jan E.; Barrio, Rafael A.; Kaski, Kimmo K.; Kapyla, Maarit J.",,462,6

This fact was confirmed early during the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic and prompted several studies that proposed monitoring its incidence by wastewater. This paper studies the fate of SARS-CoV-2 genetic material in wastewater treatment plants using RT-qPCR with a two-fold goal: i) to check its presence in the water effluent and in the produced sludge and ii) based on the understanding of the virus particles fate, to identify the most suitable spots for detecting the incidence of COVID-19 and monitor its evolution. On the grounds of the affinity of enveloped virus towards biosolids, we hypothesized that the sludge line acts as a concentrator of SARS-CoV-2 genetic material. Sampling several spots in primary, secondary and sludge treatment at the Ourense (Spain) WWTP in 5 different days showed that, in effect, most of SARS-CoV-2 particles cannot be detected in the water effluent as they are retained by the sludge line. We identified the sludge thickener as a suitable spot for detecting SARS-CoV-2 particles thanks to its higher solids concentration (more virus particles) and longer residence time (less sensitive to dilution caused by precipitation). These findings could be useful to develop a suitable strategy for early warning of COVID-19 incidence based on WWTP monitoring.","Balboa, Sabela; Mauricio-Iglesias, Miguel; Rodriguez, Santiago; Martínez-Lamas, Lucía; Vasallo, Francisco J; Regueiro, Benito; Lema, Juan M",Sci Total Environ,462,4

However, some infectious diseases like COVID-19 amass at such a great scope that traditional methods of conducting contact tracing (e.g., face-to-face interviews) remain difficult to implement, pointing to the need to develop reliable and valid survey approaches. The purpose of this research is to test the effectiveness of three different egocentric survey methods for extracting contact tracing data: (1) a baseline approach, (2) a retrieval cue approach, and (3) a context-based approach. A sample of 397 college students were randomized into one condition each. They were prompted to anonymously provide contacts and populated places visited from the past four days depending on what condition they were given. After controlling for various demographic, social identity, psychological, and physiological variables, participants in the context-based condition were significantly more likely to recall more contacts (medium effect size) and places (large effect size) than the other two conditions. Theoretically, the research supports suggestions by field theory that assume network recall can be significantly improved by activating relevant activity foci. Practically, the research contributes to the development of innovative social network data collection methods for contract tracing survey instruments.","Pilny, Andrew; Huber, C Joseph",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),462,1

Nowadays, social media is one of the best ways to connect people through Internet technology, which is also considered an essential part of our daily lives. In late December 2019, an outbreak of the novel coronavirus, COVID-19 was reported, and the World Health Organization declared an emergency due to its rapid spread all over the world. The COVID-19 epidemic has affected the use of social media by many people across the globe. Twitter is one of the most influential social media services, which has seen a dramatic increase in its use from the epidemic. Thus dynamic extraction of specific topics with labels from tweets of COVID-19 is a challenging issue for highlighting conversation instead of manual topic labeling approach. In this paper, we propose a framework that automatically identifies the key topics with labels from the tweets using the top Unigram feature of aspect terms cluster from Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) generated topics.

However, due to the very high demands of face masks, especially the N95-type mask typically worn by medical workers, the public faces a shortage of face masks. Many papers have been published recently that focus on developing new and facile techniques to reuse and reinforce commercially available face masks. For instance, the N95 mask uses a polymer-based (membrane) filter inside, and the filter membrane can be replaced if needed. Another polymer sputtering technique by using a simple cotton candy machine could provide a cheap and robust solution for face mask fabrication. This review discuss the novel approaches of face mask reuse and reinforcement specifically by using membrane-based technology. Tuning the polymeric properties of face masks to enhance filterability and virus inactivity is crucial for future investigation.","Wibisono, Yusuf; Fadila, Cut Rifda; Saiful, Saiful; Bilad, Muhammad Roil",,462,6

INTRODUCTION: The pandemic caused by the new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has catalized several changes in many fields of our lives, and also at the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology of the University of Debrecen, Hungary. OBJECTIVES: We wanted to analyse the compound effect of our new local protocols regarding elective labour inductions at term, the coronavirus pandemic and the resulting infection control measures, the merging of the Obstetrics and Gynecology Ward of the Kenézy County Hospital of Debrecen and the University Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, and also the change of the legal environment. METHODS: Local protocols were introduced: 1. Labour induction. 2. Cervical ripening in labour induction. 3. Choosing the route of delivery after cesarean. 4. Management of pregnancy around term in the case of planned trial of labour after cesarean. We compared the obstetrical data (number of deliveries, cesarean section rate, perinatal outcome and the rate and success rate of labour inductions) before and after the implementation of the protocols. The results were also compared to the Hungarian national database. RESULTS: The annual cesarean rate at our department dropped to 33.5% in 2020. In the first 9-month period, after the introduction of the new reforms, the cesarean rate decreased to 30.7%, whereas the Hungarian national rate was 40.3% in 2020. At our department, 20% of all the deliveries were induced and 74% of them led to vaginal deliveries in 2020, while in 2019 only 11% of deliveries were labour inductions, and 47% of these cases were vaginal deliveries. The monthly number of deliveries was rising constantly between January 2020 (250 deliveries) and January 2021 (450 deliveries), and the monthly cesarean rate decreased from 41% to 25%. Comparing the data of 2019 and 2020, the annual perinatal mortality rate dropped from 6.3 in 2019 to 4.2 in 2020. Neonatal morbidity, as measured by admissions to the neonatal intensive care unit, also decreased (14.8% in 2019 and 13.5% in 2020). CONCLUSIONS: As a compound result of the described factors, but mainly due to the new protocols, both the rate and the success rate of labour inductions increased significantly, while the cesarean rate decreased with improving perinatal mortality and morbidity.

Patients with Cystic fibrosis are considered of major risk, as respiratory tract infections are more severe than in the general population, with a higher risk of complications and a negative impact on lung function. The performance of physical exercise is considered as key for its well-known general benefits and also as a complementary method to help airway clearance. Therefore, physical exercise is also considered as key in the therapeutic strategy during the quarantine period. However, the impossibility to perform exercise with appropriate prescription and monitoring is of considerable worry to health care professionals. Thus, alternative strategies, such as online measures to monitor this therapy and, consequently, to achieve a safe and effective dose are highly needed. Exercise regimens should include strength and endurance, as well as balance and flexibility exercises. Patients are highly encouraged to participate in exercise programs to maintain fitness and exercise should be continued during the quarantine period. This commentary provides a summary of the main effects and benefits of physical exercise, as well as the main recommendations for its adequate execution, including exercise modality, frequency, intensity, and volume.","Fernandez-Del-Valle, Maria; Donadio, Márcio Vinícius Fagundes; Pérez-Ruiz, Margarita",Pediatr. pulmonol,462,16

Spain is among the most affected countries that declared a countrywide lockdown. An ecological study is presented herein, assessing the trends for incidence, mortality, hospitalizations, Intensive Care Unit admissions, and recoveries per autonomous community in Spain. Trends were evaluated by the Joinpoint software. The timeframe employed was when the lockdown was declared on March 14, 2020. Daily percentage changes were also calculated, with CI = 95% and p<0.05. An increase was detected, followed by reduction, for the evaluated indicators in most of the communities. Approximately 18.33 days were required for the mortality rates to decrease. The highest mortality rate was verified in Madrid (118.89 per 100,000 inhabitants) and the lowest in Melilla (2.31). The highest daily percentage increase in mortality occurred in Catalonia. Decreasing trends were identified after approximately two weeks of the institution of the lockdown by the government. Immediately the lockdown was declared, an increase of up to 33.96% deaths per day was verified in Catalonia. In contrast, Ceuta and Melilla presented significantly lower rates because they were still at the early stages of the pandemic at the moment of lockdown. The findings presented herein emphasize the importance of early and assertive decision-making to contain the pandemic.","Siqueira, Camila Alves Dos Santos; Freitas, Yan Nogueira Leite de; Cancela, Marianna de Camargo; Carvalho, Monica; Oliveras-Fabregas, Albert; de Souza, Dyego Leandro Bezerra",PLoS One,462,1

Experiences from a single-center",16.783226,7.000417,2020,"Abstract: The COVID-19 disease, which is caused by the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, has affected the world by increasing the mortality rate in 2020. Currently, there is no definite treatment for COVID-19 patients. Several clinical trials have been proposed to overcome this disease and many are still under investigation. In this review, we will be focusing on the potency of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and MSC-derived secretome for treating COVID-19 patients. Fever, cough, headache, dizziness, and fatigue are the common clinical manifestations in COVID-19 patients. In mild and severe cases, cytokines are released hyper-actively which causes a cytokine storm leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). In order to maintain the lung microenvironment in COVID-19 patients, MSCs are used as cell-based therapy approaches as they can act as cell managers which accelerate the immune system to prevent the cytokine storm and promote endogenous repair. Besides, MSCs have shown minimal expression of ACE2 or TMPRSS2, and hence, MSCs are free from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Numerous clinical studies have started worldwide and demonstrated that MSCs have great potential for ARDS treatment in COVID-19 patients. Preliminary data have shown that MSCs and MSC-derived secretome appear to be promising in the treatment of COVID-19. Lay Summary: The COVID-19 disease is an infection disease which affects the world in 2020. Currently, there is no definite treatment for COVID-19 patients. However, several clinical trials have been proposed to overcome this disease and one of them is using mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and MSC-derived secretome for treating COVID-19 patients. During the infection, cytokines are released hyper-actively which causes a cytokine storm. MSCs play an important role in maintaining the lung microenvironment in COVID-19 patients. They can act as cell managers which accelerate the immune system to prevent the cytokine storm and promote the endogenous repair. Therefore, it is important to explore the clinical trial in the world for treating the COVID-19 disease using MSCs and MSC-derived secretome.","Chouw, Angliana; Milanda, Tiana; Sartika, Cynthia Retna; Kirana, Marsya Nilam; Halim, Danny; Faried, Ahmad",Regen Eng Transl Med,462,8

Upon infecting host cells, coronaviruses assemble a multi-subunit RNA-synthesis complex of viral non-structural proteins (nsp) responsible for the replication and transcription of the viral genome. Therefore, the role and inhibition of nsp12 are indispensable. A cryo-EM structure of RdRp from SARs-CoV-2 was used to identify novel drugs from Northern South African medicinal compounds database (NANPDB) by using computational virtual screening and molecular docking approaches. Considering Remdesivir as the control, 42 compounds were shortlisted to have docking score better than Remdesivir. The top 5 hits were validated by using molecular dynamics simulation approach and free energy calculations possess strong inhibitory properties than the Remdesivir. Thus, this study paved a way for designing novel drugs by decoding the architecture of an important enzyme and its inhibition with compounds from natural resources. This disclosing of necessary knowledge regarding the screening and the identification of top hits could help to design effective therapeutic candidates against the coronaviruses and design robust preventive measurements.","Khan, Abbas; Khan, Mazhar; Saleem, Shoaib; Babar, Zainib; Ali, Arif; Khan, Abdul Aziz; Sardar, Zain; Hamayun, Fahad; Ali, Syed Shujait; Wei, Dong-Qing",Interdiscip Sci,462,1

Requirements for decreased person-to-person contacts during the COVID-19 pandemic accelerated adoption of tele-neuro-ophthalmology. This review highlights the challenges and opportunities with tele-neuro-ophthalmology. RECENT FINDINGS: Tele-neuro-ophthalmology programs can be used for triage, diagnostic consultation, and long-term treatment monitoring. Formats include telephone appointments, interprofessional collaborations, remote data interpretation, online asynchronous patient communication, and video visits. Barriers to long-term implementation of tele-neuro-ophthalmology arise from data quality, patient engagement, workflow integration, state and federal regulations, and reimbursement. General neurologists may collaborate with local eye care providers for ophthalmic examination, imaging, and testing to facilitate efficient and effective tele-neuro-ophthalmology consultation. SUMMARY: Tele-neuro-ophthalmology has tremendous potential to improve patient access to high-quality cost-effective neuro-ophthalmic care.

This review provides my perspective on the field during this period, integrating fundamental and applied developments and milestones. Our basic understanding of the brain-pituitary-gonadal axis led to overcoming the failure of farmed fish to ovulate and spawn in captivity, allowing us to close the fish life cycle and establish a predictable, year-round production of eggs. Dissecting the molecular and hormonal mechanisms associated with sex determination and differentiation drove technologies for producing better performing mono-sex and reproductively-sterile fish. The growing contingent of passionate fish biologists, together with the availability of innovative platforms such as transgenesis and gene editing, as well as new models such as the zebrafish and medaka, have generated many discoveries, also leading to new insights of reproductive biology in higher vertebrates including humans. Consequently, fish have now been widely accepted as vertebrate reproductive models. Perhaps the best testament of the progress in our discipline is demonstrated at the International Symposia on Reproductive Physiology of Fish (ISRPF), at which our scientific family has convened every four years since the grandfather of the field, the late Ronald Billard, organized the inaugural 1977 meeting in Paimpont, France. As the one person who has been fortunate enough to attend all of these meetings since their inception, I have witnessed first-hand the astounding evolution of our field as we capitalized on the molecular and biotechnological revolutions in the life sciences, which enabled us to provide a higher resolution of fish reproductive and endocrine processes, answer more questions, and dive into deeper comprehension. Undoubtedly, the next (five) decades will be similarly exciting as we continue to integrate physiology with genomics, basic and translational research, and the small fish models with the aquacultured species.","Zohar, Yonathan",Gen Comp Endocrinol,462,16

It is responsible for significant morbidity and has had severe socioeconomic consequences. This study aims to assess the knowledge, preparedness and attitudes of medical students, physicians and faculty members in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) on COVID-19 and their perspective on the roles of educational and healthcare institution towards improving pandemic preparedness and enabling optimal care. METHODOLOGY: An exploratory, descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted with 444 participants, using a non-probability convenience sampling method. English-speaking participants from the medical field aged 18 and above were included in the study. The validated questionnaire was administered online and distributed across social media platforms from May-July 2020. T-test, ANOVA, Kruskal-Wallis test and Mann-Whitney-U test were used when appropriate. Responses were analysed and statistical tests applied using IBM SPSS, version 25. RESULTS: The knowledge scores were calculated amongst different ages and professional status, and the mean was 59.08% (SD = 12.848%). Almost half of the participants obtained poor knowledge scores (less than 60%). Most of the participants followed the latest updates on COVID-19 (86.7%). The majority opted to obtain information from the national health authorities (63.4%). The mean preparedness score among the participants was 68.65% (SD = 17.456%). Being in contact with patients significantly increased the preparedness score (p < 0.001). Only 27.9% of the participants believed their college education provided adequate knowledge to deal with epidemics or pandemics. Several barriers affect willingness to work in a pandemic, with 80.6% of participants worried about posing a risk to family members. CONCLUSION: This study highlights the importance of establishing tailored COVID-19 related education programs to improve knowledge levels, especially in medical students. Efforts are still needed to promote effective control measures and address the barriers affecting willingness to work in a pandemic.","Barqawi, Hiba J; Kampani, Drishti D; Haddad, Enad S; Al-Roub, Nora M; Abu-Gharbieh, Eman",PLoS One,462,22

In bioinformatics, localization of short DNA sequences (reads) within large genomic sequences is commonly facilitated by constructing index data structures which allow for efficient querying of substrings. Recent metagenomic classification pipelines annotate reads with taxonomic labels by analyzing their $k$-mer histograms with respect to a reference genome database. CPU-based index construction is often performed in a preprocessing phase due to the relatively high cost of building irregular data structures such as hash maps. However, the rapidly growing amount of available reference genomes establishes the need for index construction and querying at interactive speeds. In this paper, we introduce MetaCache-GPU -- an ultra-fast metagenomic short read classifier specifically tailored to fit the characteristics of CUDA-enabled accelerators. Our approach employs a novel hash table variant featuring efficient minhash fingerprinting of reads for locality-sensitive hashing and their rapid insertion using warp-aggregated operations. Our performance evaluation shows that MetaCache-GPU is able to build large reference databases in a matter of seconds, enabling instantaneous operability, while popular CPU-based tools such as Kraken2 require over an hour for index construction on the same data. In the context of an ever-growing number of reference genomes, MetaCache-GPU is the first metagenomic classifier that makes analysis pipelines with on-demand composition of large-scale reference genome sets practical.

We aimed to assess gender-based desparities during COVID-19 in Jordan in terms of health indices, mental well-being and economic burden. METHODS: A nationally representative sample of 1300 participants &#8805;18 years living in Jordan were selected using stratified random sampling. Data were collected via telephone interviews in this cross-sectional study. Chi-square was used to test age and gender differences according to demographics, economic burden, and health indices (access to healthcare, health insurance, antenatal and reproductive services). A multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to estimate the beta-coefficient (ß) and 95% confidence interval (CI) of factors correlated with mental well-being, assessed by patients' health questionnaire 4 (PHQ-4). RESULTS: 656 (50.5%) men and 644 (49.5%) women completed the interview. Three-fourths of the participants had health insurance during the COVID-19 crisis. There was no significant difference in healthcare coverage or access between women and men (p > 0.05). Half of pregnant women were unable to access antenatal care. Gender was a significant predictor of higher PHQ-4 scores (women vs. men: ß: 0.88, 95% CI: 0.54-1.22).

Specific subsets of the population are more vulnerable, namely those with chronic diseases. We aimed to estimate the share of the Portuguese population at the highest risk for complications following COVID-19 infection due to both old age and specific comorbidities. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Our sample included all people aged 65 years and above (2215 men and 3486 women) who participated in the fifth Portuguese National Health Interview Survey, conducted in 2014. In order to project the potential population at highest risk for COVID-19, we used the latest available official demographic estimates from the National Institute of Statistics - INE 2018. We used a more restrictive definition of risk combining old age criteria and the following chronic conditions as potential risk factors for COVID-19 according to the available literature: hypertension, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cardio- and cerebrovascular disease. RESULTS: We estimated that 15.5% (n = 1 560 667) of the Portuguese population might be at increased risk for complications from COVID-19 because of old age and existing chronic conditions. Such estimates vary across the country (from 1.7% in Azores to 33.7% in Northern Portugal). Northern Portugal not only has the highest prevalence of selected morbidity (72.8%) within mainland Portugal, but also has the largest population at risk for COVID-19 (n = 526 607). This was followed by the Lisbon and Tagus Valley region (n = 408 564) and Central Portugal (n = 388 867). DISCUSSION: Our results should encourage authorities to continue protecting those more vulnerable to the pandemic threat, particularly on those areas of the country which are more likely to be further affected. CONCLUSION: We projected a considerable number of Portuguese people at the highest risk for severe COVID-19 disease due to both old age and pre-existing chronic conditions. Such estimates vary across the country.","Laires, Pedro A; Nunes, Carla",Acta Med Port,462,25

Serological immunoglobulin M (IgM)/IgG testing has been proposed as a useful tool for detecting SARS-CoV-2 exposure. OBJECTIVE: The objective of our study was to compare the results of the rapid serological VivaDiag test for SARS-CoV-2-related IgM/IgG detection with those of the standard RT-PCR laboratory test for identifying SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid. METHODS: We simultaneously performed both serological and molecular tests with a consecutive series of 191 symptomatic patients. The results provided by a new rapid serological colorimetric test for analyzing IgM/IgG expression were compared with those of RT-PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 detection. RESULTS: Of the 191 subjects, 70 (36.6%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 based on RT-PCR results, while 34 (17.3%) tested positive based on serological IgM/IgG expression. Additionally, 13 (6.8%) subjects tested positive based on serological test results, but also tested negative based on RT-PCR results. The rapid serological test had a sensitivity of 30% and a specificity of 89% compared to the standard RT-PCR assay. Interestingly, the performance of both assays improved 8 days after symptom appearance. After 10 days had passed since symptom appearance, the predictive value of the rapid serological test was higher than that of the standard molecular assay (proportion of positive results: 40% vs 20%). Multivariate analysis showed that age >58 years (P<.01) and period of >15 days after symptom onset (P<.02) were significant and independent factors associated with serological test positivity. CONCLUSIONS: The rapid serological test analyzed in this study seems limited in terms of usefulness when diagnosing SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, it may be useful for providing relevant information on people's immunoreaction to COVID-19 exposure.","Paradiso, Angelo Virgilio; De Summa, Simona; Loconsole, Daniela; Procacci, Vito; Sallustio, Anna; Centrone, Francesca; Silvestris, Nicola; Cafagna, Vito; De Palma, Giuseppe; Tufaro, Antonio; Garrisi, Vito Michele; Chironna, Maria",J Med Internet Res,462,1

Data were collected according to an extraction sheet developed by the first and last authors. The cross-sectional evidence covers a variety of diseases, countries and timings of testing. Mostly, questionnaires recorded socio-demographics, media exposure, trust in institutions, disease proximity and knowledge; psychological variables, including personality traits, distress and self-efficacy, were less investigated. A miscellaneous operationalization of risk perception emerged, including the likelihood of getting sick, perceived dangerousness, concerns or a combination of them. A comprehensive understanding of the substantial amount of evidence may be challenging due to methodological heterogeneity.

Like any catastrophic event, the stress on hospitals to maintain a certain level of function is immense. Acute surgical pathologies cannot be prevented or curtailed; therefore, it is important to understand patterns and outcomes during catastrophes in order to optimize care and organize the health care system. METHODS: In a single urban tertiary care center, a retrospective study examined the first complete lockdown period of Israel during the COVID-19 pandemic. This was compared to the same time period the previous year. RESULTS: During the pandemic, time to hospitalization was significantly decreased. There was also an overall reduction in surgical admissions yet with a higher percentage being hospitalized for further treatment (69.2% vs 23.5%). The patients admitted during this time had a higher APACHE-II score and Charlson comorbidity index score. During the pandemic, time to surgery was decreased, there were less laparoscopic procedures, and more RBC units were used per patient. There were no differences in overall complications, except when sub-analyzed for major complications (9.7% vs 6.3%). There was no significant difference in overall in-house mortality or morbidity. Length of hospitalization was significantly decreased in the elderly population during the pandemic. CONCLUSION: During the COVID-19 pandemic, despite a significantly less number of patients presenting to the hospital, there was a higher percentage of those admitted needing surgical intervention, and they were overall sicker than the previous year.","Maman, Yossi; Lee Goldstein, Adam; Neeman, Uri; Lessing, Yonatan; Orbach, Lior; Sirhan, Saad; Falk, Ela; Lahat, Guy",Am Surg,462,2

Starting from the well-known ""pandemic effect"" on sleep and dreaming, we presented a picture of dream activity in pharmacologically treated NT1 patients during the Italian lockdown. Forty-three NT1 patients completed a web-survey during Spring 2021 and were compared with 86 matched-controls. Statistical comparisons revealed that: (a) NT1 patients showed greater sleepiness than controls;(b) controls showed higher sleep disturbances than NT1 patients, and this result disappeared when the medication effect in NT1 was controlled;(c) NT1 patients reported higher lucid dream frequency than controls. Focusing on dreaming in NT1 patients, we found that (a) nightmare frequency was correlated with female gender, longer sleep duration, higher intrasleep wakefulness;(b) dream recall, nightmare and lucid dream frequency were positively correlated with sleepiness. Comparisons between low and high NT1 lucid dreamers showed that patients more frequently experiencing lucid dreams reported a greater influence of dreaming during wakefulness, especially concerning problem-solving and creativity. Overall, our results are consistent with previous studies on pandemic dreaming carried out on healthy subjects. Moreover, we confirmed a link between lucidity and creativity in NT1 patients. Considering the small sample size and the cross-sectional design, our findings cannot provide a causal relationship between lucid dreams and the COVID-19 lockdown. Nevertheless, they represent a first contribution to address future studies on this issue, suggesting that some stable characteristics could interact with changes provoked by the pandemic.","Scarpelli, S.; Alfonsi, V.; D039,; Anselmo, A.; Gorgoni, M.; Musetti, A.; Plazzi, G.; De Gennaro, L.; Franceschini, C.",Frontiers in Psychology,462,26

We elucidated clinical and humoral immune response and genomic analysis of vaccine breakthrough (VBT) infections after ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine in healthcare workers (HCWs). MethodsThe study was conducted on 1858 HCWs receiving two doses of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine. Serial blood samples were collected to measure SARS CoV2 IgG and neutralizing antibodies. 46 RT-PCR positive samples from VBT infections were subjected to whole genome sequencing (WGS). ResultsInfection was confirmed in 219 (11.79%) HCWs of which 21.46% (47/219) were non-vaccinated, significantly more (p <0.001) than 9.52% (156/1639) vaccinated group. VBT infections were significantly higher in doctors and nurses compared to other hospital staff (p <0.001). Unvaccinated individuals had 1.57 times higher risk of infection compared to partially vaccinated (p 0.02) and 2.49 times than fully vaccinated (<0.001). Partially vaccinated were at higher risk of infection than fully vaccinated (RR 1.58,p 0.01). There were 3 (1.36%) severe cases and 1 death in unvaccinated group compared to none in the vaccinated. Non-response after 14 days of second dose was seen in 6.5% (3/46) and low antibody levels (1-4.62 S/CO) in 8.69% (4/46). Delta variant (B.1.617.2) was dominant (69.5%) and reinfection was documented in 4 (0.06%) HCWs. ConclusionsNearly one in ten vaccinated HCWs can get infected, more so with only single dose (13.65%) than two doses (8.62%). Fully vaccinated are better protected with higher humoral immune response.

METHODS: Twenty-two participants were allocated 5% ibuprofen gel (A) and 0.025% capsaicin cream (B) in random sequence (AB or BA). Patients underwent up to 3 treatment cycles, each comprising one treatment for 4 weeks, an individualized washout period (maximum 4 weeks), then the other treatment for 4 weeks. Differential (ibuprofen or capsaicin) response was defined when change-from-baseline pain intensity scores (0-10 NRS) differed by &#8805;1 between treatments in &#8805;2 cycles within a participant. RESULTS: A total of 104 treatment periods were aggregated. Mean pain reduction was 1.2 (95% CI: 0.5, 1.8) on ibuprofen and 1.6 (95% CI: 0.9, 2.4) on capsaicin (P = 0.221). Of 22 participants, 4 (18%) had a greater response to ibuprofen, 9 (41%) to capsaicin, 4 (18%) had similar responses, and 5 (23%) were undetermined. CONCLUSION: Irrespective of equal efficacy overall, 59% of people displayed a greater response to one treatment over the other. Patients who do not benefit from one type of topical treatment should be offered to try another, which may be more effective. N-of-1 trials are useful to identify individual response to treatment.

Firstly, we find that during the COVID-19 period, the oil-stock risk spillovers are obviously stronger than those during the normal period. And there are significant risk spillovers from the US and Chinese stock markets to the oil markets. It is also discovered that the oil markets are greatly influenced by the second board stock markets, also known as the growth enterprise markets, especially during the COVID-19 outbreak. Furthermore, the bidirectional China-oil risk spillovers during the COVID-19 pandemic have rapidly increased. Besides, it is reported that the relationships across oil futures, main board and second board stock markets in the US and China are stable under different TSI levels and extreme events. Finally, the GARCHSK-Mixed Copula-CoVaR-Network outperforms the control groups in terms of marginal distribution and dependence structure.

We use (a) the stable cumulative infection of various countries and (b) the number of infection versus the tests carried out to evaluate the model. The time-dependent infection rate is set in the model to obtain the best fit with the available data. The model is simulated aiming to project the probable features of the infection in India, various Indian states, and other countries. India imposed an early lockdown to contain the infection that can be treated by its healthcare system. We find that with the current infection rate and containment measures, the total active infection in India would be maximum at the end of June or beginning of July 2020. With proper containment measures in the infected zones and social distancing, the infection is expected to fall considerably from August. If the containment measures are relaxed before the arrival of the peak infection, more people from the susceptible population will fall sick as the infection is expected to see a threefold rise at the peak. If the relaxation is given a month after the peak infection, a second peak with a moderate infection will follow. However, a gradual relaxation of the lockdown started well ahead of the peak infection, leads to a nearly twofold increase of the peak infection with no second peak. The model is further extended to incorporate the infection arising from the population showing no symptoms. The preliminary finding suggests that random testing needs to be carried out within the asymptomatic population to contain the spread of the disease. Our model provides a semi-quantitative overview of the progression of COVID-19 in India, with model projections reasonably replicating the current progress. The projection of the model is highly sensitive to the choice of the parameters and the available data.","Chatterjee, Saptarshi; Sarkar, Apurba; Chatterjee, Swarnajit; Karmakar, Mintu; Paul, Raja",Indian J Phys Proc Indian Assoc Cultiv Sci (2004),462,23

Their safety and efficacy in older people is critical to their success. Even though care home residents and older people are likely to be amongst the first to be vaccinated, these patient groups are usually excluded from clinical trials. Data from several Phase II trials have given cause for optimism, with strong antibody responses and reassuring safety profiles but, with the exception of AstraZeneca's vaccine, recruited few older people. Overall, the sparse data from Phase II trials suggest a reduction in both antibody responses and mild to moderate adverse events in well older people compared to younger participants. Many of the Phase III trials have made a conscious effort to recruit older people, and interim analyses of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccine have led to press releases announcing high degrees of efficacy. However, older people with co-morbidities and frailty have once again been largely excluded and there are no published data on safety and efficacy in this group. Although the speed and impact of the pandemic on older people with frailty justify an approach where they are offered vaccination first, patients and their carers and supervising health care professionals alike will need to make a decision on accepting vaccination based on limited evidence. Here we review the main candidate vaccines that may become available, with a focus on the evidence of safety and efficacy in older people.","Soiza, Roy L; Scicluna, Chiara; Thomson, Emma C",Age ageing,462,24

However, complete transition from in-person visits to telehealth uncovered many opportunities for innovation. At-home semen testing is not yet widely recognized, and patients still require an in-person visit for ultrasounds, procedures, and physical examinations. Although emergency policies and waivers have made it easier for providers to legally practice across state borders and receive payments from insurance companies, they vary from state to state and have not been cemented into law. Finally, clinical training for medical students, residents, and fellows has been affected by decreased clinical and surgical volume. However, trainees have also proven to be the most adaptable, quickly shifting to remote learning practices through social media, online surgical atlases, and wide distribution of ""virtual visiting professor"" lectures.

In this retrospective single-center study, we included 67 COVID-19 patients with onset time within 2 weeks in Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University from January 9 to February 29, 2020. Patients were divided into EBV/SARS-CoV-2 coinfection group and SARS-CoV-2 infection alone group according to the serological results of EBV, and the characteristics differences between the two groups were compared. The median age was 37 years, with 35 (52.2%) females. Among these COVID-19 patients, thirty-seven (55.2%) patients were seropositive for EBV viral capsid antigen (VCA) IgM antibody. EBV/SARS-CoV-2 coinfection patients had a 3.09-fold risk of having a fever symptom than SARS-CoV-2 infection alone patients (95% CI 1.11-8.56; P = 0.03). C-reactive protein (CRP) (P = 0.02) and the aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (P = 0.04) in EBV/SARS-CoV-2 coinfection patients were higher than that in SARS-CoV-2 infection alone patients. EBV/SARS-CoV-2 coinfection patients had a higher portion of corticosteroid use than the SARS-CoV-2 infection alone patients (P = 0.03). We find a high incidence of EBV coinfection in COVID-19 patients. EBV/SARS-CoV-2 coinfection was associated with fever and increased inflammation.

Here, we aimed to delineate the uniquely age-dependent immune features of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in a retrospective study of 447 patients, stratified according to age distributions of COVID-19 morbidity statistics into well-defined age-cohorts (2-25y, 26-38y, 39-57y, 58-68y, and 69-79y). Age-dependent susceptibilities and severities of the disease were observed in COVID-19 patients. A comparison of the lymphocyte counts among the five age-groups indicated that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection led to age-dependent lymphopenia. Among the lymphocyte subsets, the CD8+ T cell count alone was significantly and age-dependently decreased (520, 385, 320, 172, and 139 n/µl in the five age-groups, respectively). In contrast, the CD4+ T cell, B cell, and natural killer cell counts did not differ among age-cohorts. Age and CD8+ T cell counts (r=â0.435, p<0.0001) were negatively correlated in COVID-19 patients. Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 infection age-dependently increased the plasma C-reactive protein concentrations (2.0, 5.0, 9.0, 11.6, and 36.1 mg/L in the five age-groups, respectively). These findings can be used to elucidate the role of CD8+ T cells in age-related pathogenesis and to help develop therapeutic strategies for COVID-19.","Jin, Shengwei; An, Hui; Zhou, Tong; Li, Ting; Chen, Chengshui; Ying, Binyu; Xu, Zhangye; Li, Xiaokun; Li, Ming",Aging (Albany NY),462,24

In this paper, a high-efficiency micro-electrolysis filler was prepared by a facile calcination method for the degradation of isobutyl xanthate (IBX). The optimization of filler fabrication process was investigated from aspects of compressive strength, abrasion loss and degradation rate. Combined with multi-characterization techniques, it can be found that the zero-valent iron (ZVI) was partially changed to Fe(2+) in the phase of fayalite (Fe2SiO4) during the treatment. The influence of operation parameters of filler dosage, initial pH and initial concentration were thoroughly studied. The result shows that the IBX degradation rate by optimized filler can reach 93.30%, superior to that of Fe/C filler (the element Fe kept at ZVI during heat treatment) with 61.8% removal. The degradation pathway of IBX was studied by GC-MS in details and the bis(2-methylpropyl)carbonate was postulated as the main by-product. The stability of filler was evaluated by batch cycle tests and column tests. This work provides a novel perspective about micro-electrolysis filler preparation.

It remains unknown, as of April 2020, whether summer weather will reduce its spread, thereby alleviating strains on hospitals and providing time for vaccine development. Early insights from laboratory studies and research on related viruses predicted that COVID-19 would decline with higher temperatures, humidity, and ultraviolet (UV) light. Using current, fine-scaled weather data and global reports of infections, we develop a model that explains 36% of the variation in maximum COVID-19 growth rates based on weather and demography (17%) and country-specific effects (19%). UV light is most strongly associated with lower COVID-19 growth. Projections suggest that, without intervention, COVID-19 will decrease temporarily during summer, rebound by autumn, and peak next winter. Validation based on data from May and June 2020 confirms the generality of the climate signal detected. However, uncertainty remains high, and the probability of weekly doubling rates remains >20% throughout summer in the absence of social interventions.

Our objectives were to evaluate the impact of the first wave of the pandemic in Québec by measuring SARS-CoV-2 antibody seroprevalence in a convenience sample of healthy blood donors and to study the association between seropositivity and the occurrence of COVID-19 symptoms. METHODS: The study design was a cross-sectional serological survey with a nested case-control study. Residual blood samples from donations collected between May 25 and July 9, 2020 (well before vaccination rollout) in the province of Québec were tested for anti-Spike RBD antibodies by ELISA. Seropositive donors and a control group of seronegative donors were questioned about prior COVID-19 symptoms. All qualified blood donors were eligible for participation. RESULTS: A total of 7691 blood donors were included in the study. After adjustments, the seroprevalence rate was 2.2% (95% CI 1.9-2.6). Seropositive donors reported one or more symptoms in a proportion of 52.2% (95% CI 44.2-60.1); this proportion was 19.1% (95% CI 13.4-26.1) among seronegative donors, suggesting that approximately 50-66% of all infections were asymptomatic. Univariate analysis of associations between symptoms and seropositivity revealed that except for rhinorrhea, all symptoms were significantly associated with seropositivity. CONCLUSION: Assuming that blood donors are fairly representative of the general adult population, this study shows that less than 3% of 18-69-year-olds have been infected during the first wave of the pandemic in the province of Québec. Our data also confirm that many infections escaped detection, including a substantial proportion that were asymptomatic.","Lewin, Antoine; Therrien, Roseline; De Serres, Gaston; Grégoire, Yves; Perreault, Josée; Drouin, Mathieu; Fournier, Marie-Josée; Tremblay, Tony; Beaudoin, Julie; Beaudoin-Bussières, Guillaume; Prévost, Jérémie; Gendron-Lepage, Gabrielle; Finzi, Andrés; Bernier, France; Bazin, Renée; Germain, Marc; Delage, Gilles",Can J Public Health,462,22

PURPOSE: The current evidence regarding iodine-containing compounds and iodine allergy cross-reactivity is reviewed. SUMMARY: Iodine is an essential human nutrient found in the thyroid gland. It is used in the synthesis of the thyroid hormones thyroxine and triiodothyroxine. Patients who report having adverse reactions to iodine-containing substances are often labelled as having an ""iodine allergy,"" which can result in delays in care or patients being denied essential ICM or other iodine-containing drugs. A literature review was conducted to evaluate the evidence regarding iodine allergy and iodine-containing drugs. Of 435 articles considered potentially appropriate for full review (plus 12 additional articles included on the basis of references from the eligible articles), 113 could not be obtained. After exclusion of 353 articles that did not meet all inclusion criteria, the remaining 81 articles were included in the review. The results of the literature review indicated that iodine has not been shown to be the allergen responsible for allergic reactions to iodinated contrast media, amiodarone, povidone-iodine, and other iodine-containing compounds. CONCLUSION: There is a lack of evidence to support cross-reactivity between iodine-containing compounds in so called iodine-allergic individuals.","Wulf, Nicole R; Schmitz, John; Choi, Amy",Am. j. health system pharm,462,24

International Physical Activity Questionnaire Short Form (IPAQ) and selected questions from Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index were administered to evaluate physical activity, sitting and sleep time. Decreased physical activity, and increased sitting and sleep time were observed from pre- to during lockdown in 6th-year students (p<0.01). 1st-6th-year students featured 10 [8-12] hours sitting (median [Q1-Q3]) and an IPAQ score of 1170 [400-2348] MET-min/week. Even participants with higher physical activity featured high sitting time. Sleeping less than recommended (<7 h/night) was associated with more sitting time and less energies to perform daily activities. Strategies fostering compliance with current guidelines for physical activity, sedentary behaviour and sleep should be implemented, especially in case of a repeated or intermittent lockdown. Highlights During lockdown, medicine students reduced their total physical activity and increased sedentary behaviour. Walking time was reduced in favour of increased higher-intensity physical activity. However, total metabolic expenditure was lower than before lockdown. Before lockdown students slept less than the recommended 7 hours per night, but they increased sleep time during lockdown. Medical schools should promote education on physical activity and sleep, since it improves the health of students, doctors and patients. This is especially valuable in case of repeated lockdown.","Luciano, Francesco; Cenacchi, Valentina; Vegro, Valentina; Pavei, Gaspare",Eur J Sport Sci,462,6

Currently, the knowledge regarding the clinical impact of COVID-19 on maternal, fetal, and placental aspects of pregnancy is minimal. Although the elderly and men were the most affected population, in previous situations, such as the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic and the Ebola epidemic, pregnant women were more likely to develop complications than nonpregnant women. There are unanswered questions specific to pregnant women, such as whether pregnant women are more severely affected and whether intrauterine transmission occurs. Additional information is needed to inform key decisions, such as whether pregnant health care workers should receive special consideration, whether to separate infected mothers and their newborns, and whether it is safe for infected women to breastfeed.","Gonçalves, Ana Katherine",Rev Bras Ginecol Obstet,462,33

The purpose of this systematic review was to understand the process of VI, its effectiveness as an alternative to FTFI, and the experiences of applicants and institutions with VI. We also share best practice strategies for applicants and institutions in VI preparation. METHOD: PubMed/MEDLINE, Cochrane Library of Systematic Reviews, Web of Science Core Collection, Scopus and CINAHL databases were searched through May 2020. Articles in English evaluating the effectiveness of VI were included, without applying any date limits. Two reviewers selected articles and extracted data. RESULTS: Of the 934 articles screened, 22 articles underwent full-text article analysis to include 15 studies. There were 4 studies that reported the use of VI as a screening tool. 11 studies completely replaced FTFI with VI. Most applicants could appropriately convey themselves through VI. Most applicants and interviewing programs expressed reservations about VI's use as an alternative to FTFI. CONCLUSION: There is dearth of evidence supporting the efficacy of VI. There is an opportunity for potential research at multi-institutional level to gain better understanding of the efficacy of VI. The knowledge obtained from this systematic review has the potential of helping applicants and institutions in preparing for VI process. Additionally, authors propose supportive strategies to help prepare applicants and institutions for VI.","Chandratre, Sonal; Soman, Aamod",PLoS One,462,20

Our group of clinicians and nurses developed and recorded short video messages to encourage viewers to stay home for the Thanksgiving and Christmas Holidays. We then conducted a two-stage clustered randomized controlled trial in 820 counties (covering 13 States) in the United States of a large-scale Facebook ad campaign disseminating these messages. In the first level of randomization, we randomly divided the counties into two groups: high intensity and low intensity. In the second level, we randomly assigned zip codes to either treatment or control such that 75% of zip codes in high intensity counties received the treatment, while 25% of zip codes in low intensity counties received the treatment. In each treated zip code, we sent the ad to as many Facebook subscribers as possible (11,954,109 users received at least one ad at Thanksgiving and 23,302,290 users received at least one ad at Christmas). The first primary outcome was aggregate holiday travel, measured using mobile phone location data, available at the county level: we find that average distance travelled in high-intensity counties decreased by -0.993 percentage points (95% CI -1.616, -0.371, p-value 0.002) the three days before each holiday. The second primary outcome was COVID-19 infection at the zip-code level: COVID-19 infections recorded in the two-week period starting five days post-holiday declined by 3.5 percent (adjusted 95% CI [-6.2 percent, -0.7 percent], p-value 0.013) in intervention zip codes compared to control zip codes.","Breza, E.; Stanford, F.

Epidemiological data on mental health and psychological disorder inpatients infected with COVID-19 pneumonia are not available in Iranian patients. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the anxiety, stress, and depression of patients with COVID-19. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This cross-sectional survey was conducted in 2020. All confirmed patients with COVID-19 were included in the study by census sampling. Assessment of depression, stress, and anxiety was performed using the DASS-21 questionnaire. All statistical analyses were performed using R version 3.5.1. RESULTS: The questionnaires were completed by 221 patients with COVID-19 infection (204 males, 17 females). The mean age was 45.90 ± 7.73 years. Our results indicated that the mean scores of depression and anxiety were at ""extremely severe"" levels, while stress levels were ""severe."" The prevalence of ""extremely severe"" symptoms of depression and anxiety was 54.29% and 97.29%, respectively. The prevalence of severe stress was 46.61%. CONCLUSION: In this study, patients infected with COVID-19 reported severe and extremely severe experience psychological distress. Further studies should focus on the combined use of psychological and molecular biomarker testing to increase accuracy. Overall, the findings demonstrate the necessity of special intervention programs for the confirmed patients with emerging infectious disease COVID-19 to promote mental health needs.","Moayed, Malihe Sadat; Vahedian-Azimi, Amir; Mirmomeni, Golshan; Rahimi-Bashar, Farshid; Goharimoghadam, Keivan; Pourhoseingholi, Mohamad Amin; Abbasi-Farajzadeh, Mohsen; Hekmat, Mostafa; Sathyapalan, Thozhukat; Guest, Paul C; Sahebkar, Amirhossein",Adv Exp Med Biol,462,16

Due to the spread of infection by SARS-CoV-2, many professionals have had to adapt their work to telerehabilitation practices, which require the best evidence at short notice and in summarized form. In this context, this protocol has been developed to evaluate the effectiveness of telerehabilitation as a care strategy in physical therapy for different conditions, populations, and contexts. Method and analysis: An overview will be carried out in the format of a rapid review. It will include systematic reviews of different conditions, populations, and contexts, where the intervention to be evaluated is telerehabilitation by physical therapy. The outcomes considered will be clinical effectiveness depending on the specific condition, functionality, quality of life, satisfaction, adherence, and safety. A search will be carried out of the MEDLINE/PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library databases. Studies will be selected in duplicate with any discrepancies resolved by a third reviewer. Data extraction and risk of bias assessment will be carried out by a reviewer with non-independent verification by a second reviewer. The findings will be reported qualitatively by tables and figures. Ethics and dissemination: The principles of the value of the research question, the methodological rigor, scientifically qualified investigators, an independent evaluation of the protocol, and timely and accurate publication of the results will be complied with. The complete review will lead to the publication of at least one article, and the results will be widely disseminated at various levels of decision-making.

CDC examined county-level disparities in COVID-19 cases among underrepresented racial/ethnic groups in counties identified as hotspots, which are defined using algorithmic thresholds related to the number of new cases and the changes in incidence. Disparities were defined as difference of &#8805;5% between the proportion of cases and the proportion of the population or a ratio &#8805;1.5 for the proportion of cases to the proportion of the population for underrepresented racial/ethnic groups in each county. During June 5-18, 205 counties in 33 states were identified as hotspots; among these counties, race was reported for &#8805;50% of cumulative cases in 79 (38.5%) counties in 22 states; 96.2% of these counties had disparities in COVID-19 cases in one or more underrepresented racial/ethnic groups.

A cross-sectional, professional pharmacy organization listserver-based online survey of a target group of health-system pharmacists across the United States was conducted. The survey was sent out through professional organization listservers and was anonymous and voluntary. The survey questionnaire included items regarding demographics and employment characteristics, COVID-19-related questions, a survey of respondents' perceptions of the prevalence and severity of burnout, and the Professional Quality of Life Scale (ProQOL). The ProQOL assessed respondents for compassion satisfaction (subcategorized as burnout and STS) and compassion fatigue. Descriptive statistics was used to assess the prevalence of burnout and STS. RESULTS: Four hundred eighty-four health-system pharmacists completed the survey. Based on respondents' self-ratings of burnout, 47% were identified as having current burnout and 81% as having a history of burnout. Based on ProQOL scoring, 65.3% of respondents were identified as having a moderate or high likelihood of burnout, which was a prevalence higher than that indicated by respondents' self-ratings. Additionally, 51.4% of respondents were identified as having a moderate or high probability of STS and 99.4% as having a moderate or high probability of compassion satisfaction. CONCLUSION: The survey found that over half of health-system pharmacists were affected with burnout, half with STS, and three-fourths with compassion satisfaction during the COVID-19 pandemic. Unfortunately, the development of burnout and STS in these health-system pharmacists may lead to several work-related consequences (eg, increase risk of medical errors, depression); therefore, addressing burnout and STS is crucial. Further studies of the consequences of burnout and STS during the COVID-19 pandemic are needed.","Jones, Adam M; Clark, John S; Mohammad, Rima A",Am. j. health system pharm,462,29

The cytokine storm is a known factor causing major clinical symptoms leading to death in COVID-19 patients. OBJECTIVE: To investigate and compare the serum levels of different cytokines in COVID-19 patients with different clinical severity. METHODS: Concentrations of serum cytokines, including IL-1ß, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, TNF-&#945;, IFN-Î³, and GM-CSF, were measured in 61 COVID-19 patients and 31 normal controls with ELISA. We investigated the correlation between the levels of these cytokines and clinical severity, CRP level, neutrophil and lymphocyte count in patients with COVID-19. RESULTS: Our data indicated that the levels of IL-1ß, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, TNF-&#945;, IFN-Î³, and GM-CSF, but not IL-10 were significantly increased in COVID-19 patients compared to normal controls. Statistical analysis showed that the level of IL-1ß, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, TNF-&#945;, IFN-Î³, and GM-CSF were higher in severe COVID-19 than those of mild cases. The concentrations of all mentioned cytokines were negatively associated with the absolute count of lymphocytes, and positively correlated with the CRP level and the absolute count of neutrophils.

Perturbance in coagulating factors has also been reported in Covid-19 patients, including increased d-dimers and reports of lupus anticoagulant (LA). METHODS: The current study aimed to identify the incidence of positivity of lupus anticoagulant in Covid-19 patients and analyze the association between LA and D-dimer in predicting thrombosis and mortality in one-hundred and five hospitalized adult (age &gt;14 years) patients and forty-three hospitalized pediatric (age &lt;14 years) patients with a confirmed diagnosis of Covid-19 between June 2020 and September 2020. RESULTS: Twenty-one (20%) adult patients were tested positive for PTT LA, of which nine (8.6%) turned out to be confirmed positive for LA through StaClot and DRVVT Ratio tests. Six (14%) pediatric patients were positive for PTT LA, and only one (2.3%) had positive StaClot. Median D-dimer at admission was positively correlated with age and CRP among adult patients and was significantly higher in expired cases (P=0.001). No association between any of the coagulation tests and thrombosis or mortality was observed in the pediatric cohort. CONCLUSION: We report an increased incidence of LA in Covid-19 patients, yet we didn't find any association between thrombotic events or mortality, probably due to the small sample size.","Owaidah, T.; Saleh, M.; Aguilos, A.

While the quality of antibody testing and the likelihood of even attaining COVID-19 immunity continue to be researched, we address the issues involved in providing tamper-proof and privacy-preserving certification, both for COVID-19 immunity and in general. Methods: We developed a prototype mobile phone app and requisite distributed server architecture that facilitates instant verification of tamper-proof test results. Personally identifiable information is only stored at the user's discretion, and the app allows the end-user selectively to present only the specific test result with no other personal information revealed. Behind the scenes it relies upon (a) the 2019 World Wide Web Consortium standard called 'Verifiable Credentials', (b) Tim Berners-Lee's decentralized personal data platform 'Solid', and (c) a consortium Ethereum-based blockchain. Results: Our mobile phone app and distributed server architecture enable the mixture of verifiability and privacy in a manner derived from public/private key pairs and digital signatures, generalized to avoid restrictive ownership of sensitive digital keys and/or data. For the test certificate Holder, Issuer (e.g. doctor, pharmacy) and Verifier (e.g. employer), it is 'just another app' which takes only minutes to use. Conclusions: The app and distributed server architecture offer a prototype proof of concept that is readily scalable, applicable generically, and in effect 'waiting in the wings' for the biological issues, plus key ethical issues raised in the discussion section, to be resolved.","Eisenstadt, Marc; Ramachandran, Manoharan; Chowdhury, Niaz; Third, Allan; Domingue, John",,462,20

Meanwhile, desperation has driven prescribers, researchers as well as administrators to recommend and try therapies supported by little or no reliable evidence. Recently, hydroxychloroquine-sulfate (HCQS) has got significant media and political attention for the treatment as well as prophylaxis of COVID-19 despite the lack of convincing and unequivocal data supporting its efficacy and safety in these patients. This has unfortunately, yet foreseeably led to several controversies and confusion among the medical fraternity, the patient community as well as the general public. Based on the available studies, many with high risk of bias, relatively small sample sizes, and abbreviated follow-ups, HCQS is unlikely to be of dramatic benefit in COVID-19 patients and yet has the potential to cause harm, particularly when used in combination with azithromycin or other medications in high risk individuals with comorbidities. Although definitive data from larger well-controlled randomized trials will be forthcoming in the future, and we may be able to identify specific patient subpopulations likely to benefit from hydroxychloroquine, till that time it will be prudent to prescribe it within investigational trial settings with close safety monitoring. Here we review the current evidence and developments related to the use of HCQS in COVID-19 patients and highlight the importance of risk-benefit assessment and rational use of HCQS during this devastating pandemic.","Singh, Harmanjit; Chauhan, Prerna; Kakkar, Ashish Kumar",Eur J Pharmacol,462,16

A survey of 887 patients,16.638927,7.965907,2020,"Purpose: This paper aims to provide an estimation of the costs of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic with a special focus on Spain. Costs include macroeconomic costs of foregone gross domestic product (GDP) attributable to the pandemic and the direct and indirect costs of prevention, treatment and lost productivity. This study also analyzes the cost-effectiveness of the test-tracking-quarantine (TTQ) strategy in Spain. Design/methodology/approach: The macroeconomic costs of foregone GDP attributable to the pandemic are estimated for different countries and areas by comparing the present GDP forecasts for 2020 and 2021 with counterfactuals estimated before the COVID-19 crisis aftermath. The total cost of the COVID-19 for Spain in 2020 was obtained using the cost of illness approach with a bottom-up process. A cost-effectiveness analysis of the TTQ strategy in Spain is based on the estimation of the total costs of TTQ and the health gains and avoided health-care costs associated with the TTQ strategy. A sensitivity analysis explores the consequences of uncertainty in key parameters. Findings: The GDP cost of the COVID-19 is by far larger than all the other components of the cost. The global cost of the Covid-19 crisis in 2020–2021 is estimated at 14% of 2019 GDP (around 12,206 mm$). In the specific case of Spain, it amounts to 24% of the 2019 GDP;which is 397.3 m €. Spain is and will be by far the European country most economically affected by the pandemic. In Spain 2020, the GDP cost accounts for 94.7% of the total cost of the COVID-19 and health-care direct costs are only 2.14%. TTQ is a dominant strategy in Spain. For each euro spent on it, 7 euros will be recovered only in terms of saved health-care resources. Research limitations/implications: Given the large degree of uncertainty and the fast-evolving nature of the epidemic, a number of assumptions are required to arrive at the estimates provided in this study. The results were found to be robust to the assumptions applied. Practical implications: TTQ is a key strategy for the contention of the epidemy and it is justified from the economic perspective. Originality/value: This is the first estimation of the cost of the COVID-19 and the cost-effectiveness of the TTQ strategy for Spain. © 2020, Beatriz González López-Valcárcel and Laura Vallejo-Torres.","González López-Valcárcel, B.; Vallejo-Torres, L.",Applied Economic Analysis,462,23

Based on structural similarity with other Î³-secretase (Î³S) targets, we hypothesized that ACE2 may be affected by Î³S proteolytic activity. We found that after ectodomain shedding, ACE2 is targeted for intramembrane proteolysis by Î³S, releasing a soluble ACE2 C-terminal fragment. Consistently, chemical or genetic inhibition of Î³S results in the accumulation of a membrane-bound fragment of ectodomain-deficient ACE2. Although chemical inhibition of Î³S does not alter SARS-CoV-2 cell entry, these data point to a novel pathway for cellular ACE2 trafficking.","Bartolomé, Alberto; Liang, Jiani; Wang, Pengfei; Ho, David D; Pajvani, Utpal B",Sci Rep,462,20

In this study, molecular docking, molecular dynamics, and structure-activity relationship are employed to assess the binding affinity and interaction of 76 prescription drugs against RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and Main Protease (Mpro) of SARS-CoV-2. The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase is a vital enzyme of coronavirus replication/transcription complex whereas the main protease acts on the proteolysis of replicase polyproteins. Among 76 prescription antiviral drugs, four drugs (Raltegravir, Simeprevir, Cobicistat, and Daclatasvir) that are previously used for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), Ebola, and Marburg virus show higher binding energy and strong interaction with active sites of the receptor proteins. To explore the dynamic nature of the interaction, 100 ns molecular dynamics (MD) simulation is performed on the selected protein-drug complexes and apo-protein. Binding free energy of the selected drugs is performed by MM/PBSA. Besides docking and dynamics, partial least square (PLS) regression method is applied for the quantitative structure activity relationship to generate and predict the binding energy for drugs. PLS regression satisfactorily predicts the binding energy of the effective antiviral drugs compared to binding energy achieved from molecular docking with a precision of 85%. This study highly recommends researchers to screen these potential drugs in vitro and in vivo against SARS-CoV-2 for further validation of utility.","Ahmed, Sinthyia; Mahtarin, Rumana; Ahmed, Sayeda Samina; Akter, Shaila; Islam, Md Shamiul; Mamun, Abdulla Al; Islam, Rajib; Hossain, Md Nayeem; Ali, Md Ackas; Sultana, Mossammad U C; Parves, Md Rimon; Ullah, M Obayed; Halim, Mohammad A",J Biomol Struct Dyn,462,27

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) may allow secondary fungal disease through a propensity to cause respiratory infection by affecting the immune system leading to dysregulation and reduced numbers of T lymphocytes, CD4+T, and CD8+T cells, altering the innate immunity. The aim of this study is to evaluate the incidence of acute invasive fungal rhinosinusitis (AIFRS) in COVID-19 patients. METHODOLOGY: Data for acute invasive rhinosinusitis was obtained from the Otorhinolaryngology departments at our tertiary hospital at the period from January 2017 to December 2020. Then the risk factors of comorbid diseases and fungal types between post-COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 groups regarding the incidence of AIFRS are compared. RESULTS: Consequently, the incidence of AIFRS showed a more significant difference (P < 0.05) in post-COVID-19 patients than in non-COVID-19 especially in immunocompromised patients, diabetic, renal, and liver dysfunction patients as well as patients with risk factors of AIFRS. The most common organisms affecting patients with AIFRS are Rhizopus oryzae, Aspergillus fumigatus, and Absidia mucor. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of AIFRS is markedly prominent in post-COVID-19 patients than in those of non-COVID-19, especially in immunocompromised, diabetic, renal, and liver dysfunction patients and patients with risk factors for rhinosinusitis.","Ismaiel, Wael F; Abdelazim, Mohamed H; Eldsoky, Ibrahim; Ibrahim, Ahmed A; Alsobky, Mahmoud E; Zafan, Ebtesam; Hasan, Abdulkarim",Am J Otolaryngol,462,1

Molecular diagnostic tests for COVID-19 emerged shortly after the isolation of SARS-CoV-2, however, serological tests based on antiviral antibody detection, revealing previous exposure to the virus, required longer developmental phases, due to the need for correctly folded and glycosylated antigens. The delay between the identification of a new virus and the development of reliable serodiagnostic tools limits our readiness for the control of a future epidemic. In this context, we propose the protozoan Leishmania tarentolae as an easy-to-handle micro-factory for the rapid production of viral antigens, to be used at the forefront of emerging epidemics. As a study model, we engineered L. tarentolae to express the SARS-CoV-2 Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) and report the ability of the purified RBD antigen to detect SARS-CoV-2 infection, with a sensitivity and reproducibility comparable to that of a reference antigen produced in human cells. This is the first application of an antigen produced in L. tarentolae for the serodiagnosis of a Coronaviridae infection. Based on our results, we propose L. tarentolae as an effective system for viral antigen production, even in countries that lack high-tech cell factories.","Varotto-Boccazzi, Ilaria; Manenti, Alessandro; Dapporto, Francesca; Gourlay, Louise; Bisaglia, Beatrice; Gabrieli, Paolo; Forneris, Federico; Faravelli, Silvia; Bollati, Valentina; Zuccotti, Gian Vincenzo; Montomoli, Emanuele; Epis, Sara; Bandi, Claudio",,462,16

Outbreaks in various homes are described in detail based on the documentation from the public health department. Results: By August 28, 2020, 2,665 COVID-19 infections were reported in Frankfurt am Main (incidence 351/100,000 inhabitants), including 116 (4.3%) residents of nursing homes (2,416/100,000 residents). Almost half (39%) of all deaths in Frankfurt (n=69; incidence 9.1/100,000) were among nursing home residents (n=27; incidence 558/100,000 nursing home residents), with 22 of them in just one long-term care facility (LTCF). Compared to previous years, the mortality rate in nursing homes did not increase in the first half of 2020. In one home, 75% of residents tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and 25% died; in two other homes, 6.7% and 14.1% of the residents became infected, and the mortality rate was 0.5% and 1%, resp. In the other 42 homes in the city (3,906 beds), the infection rate remained below 1% and the death rate was 0.1%. Discussion: In many countries, 30–70% of all deaths occur among nursing home residents, including Frankfurt (39%). An increase in overall mortality compared to previous years was not observed in Frankfurt as a whole or in the nursing homes in the city specifically. Due to the measures taken (monitoring of residents and staff, nursing care in protective clothing, prohibition or restriction of visits, physical distancing, isolation of infected people and quarantining of contact persons), only individual cases of COVID-19 illnesses occurred in nursing home residents in most homes and the outbreaks in the three homes could be stopped. We do not recommend regular nontargeted testing in nursing homes, but rather vigilance and the implementation of good hygiene as well as immediate targeted testing if COVID-19 is suspected in residents or staff. In order to mitigate the considerable negative effects of these measures on the residents, a good balance should be sought between infection prevention and the goal of ensuring self-determination and the residents’ quality of life.","Heudorf, Ursel; Müller, Maria; Schmehl, Cleo; Gasteyer, Stephanie; Steul, Katrin",GMS Hyg Infect Control,462,16

In mental health, the biggest enabler of digital solutions is the implementation of an effective model of care that is facilitated by integrated health information technologies (HITs); the latter ensuring the solution is easily accessible, scalable and sustainable. The University of Sydney’s Brain and Mind Centre (BMC) has developed an innovative digital health solution – delivered through the Youth Mental Health and Technology Program – which incorporates two components: 1) a highly personalised and measurement-based (data-driven) model of youth mental health care; and 2) an industrial grade HIT registered on the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods. This paper describes a research protocol to evaluate the impact of implementing the BMC’s digital health solution into youth mental health services (i.e. headspace - a highly accessible, youth-friendly integrated service that responds to the mental health, physical health, alcohol or other substance use, and vocational concerns of young people aged 12 to 25 years) within urban and regional areas of Australia. METHODS: The digital health solution will be implemented into participating headspace centres using a naturalistic research design. Quantitative and qualitative data will be collected from headspace health professionals, service managers and administrators, as well as from lead agency and local Primary Health Network (PHN) staff, via service audits, Implementation Officer logs, online surveys, and semi-structured interviews, at baseline and then three-monthly intervals over the course of 12 months. DISCUSSION: At the time of publication, six headspace centres had been recruited to this study and had commenced implementation and impact evaluation. The first results are expected to be submitted for publication in 2021. This study will focus on the impact of implementing a digital health solution at both a service and staff level, and will evaluate digital readiness of service and staff adoption; quality, usability and acceptability of the solution by staff; staff self-reported clinical competency; overall impact on headspace centres as well as their lead agencies and local PHNs; and social return on investment.

Babies born to mothers with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) currently get 24-h inpatient monitoring. We investigated whether a low-risk group of babies born to mothers with GDM could be defined for shorter inpatient hypoglycaemia monitoring. METHODS: Observational, retrospective cohort study conducted in a tertiary maternity hospital in 2018. Singleton, term babies born to women with GDM and no other risk factors for hypoglycaemia, were included. Capillary blood glucose (BG) testing and clinical observations for signs of hypoglycaemia during the first 24-h after birth. BG was checked in all babies before the second feed. Subsequent testing occurred if the first result was < 2.0 mmol/L, or clinical suspicion developed for hypoglycaemia. Neonatal hypoglycaemia, defined as either capillary or venous glucose ≤ 2.0 mmol/L and/or clinical signs of neonatal hypoglycaemia requiring oral or intravenous dextrose (lethargy, abnormal feeding behaviour or seizures). RESULTS: Fifteen of 106 babies developed hypoglycaemia within the first 24-h. Maternal and neonatal characteristics were not predictive. All babies with hypoglycaemia had an initial capillary BG ≤ 2.6 mmol/L (Area under the ROC curve (AUC) 0.96, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) 0.91–1.0). This result was validated on a further 65 babies, of whom 10 developed hypoglycaemia, in the first 24-h of life. CONCLUSION: Using the 2.6 mmol/L threshold, extended monitoring as an inpatient could have been avoided for 60% of babies in this study. Whilst prospective validation is needed, this approach could help tailor postnatal care plans for babies born to mothers with GDM.","Park, Esther H.

The Italian Society of Oncological Surgery–SICO has drafted these practical recommendations, calibrated on the most recent scientific literature and taking into account current health regulations and common sense. Surgical activity during phase 1 and 2 should follow a dynamic model, considering architectural structures, hospital mission, organizational models. Surgical delay should not affect oncological prognosis. However, COVID-19-positive cancer patients should be postponed until the infection is cured. The patients to consider more carefully before delaying surgery are those who have completed neoadjuvant therapy, patients with high biological aggressiveness tumors or without therapeutic alternatives. The multidisciplinary discussions are fundamental for sharing clinical decisions; videoconference meetings are preferable and use of telemedicine for follow-up is recommended. Especially in phase 1, maximum effort must be made to reduce the spread of the pandemic. Prefer intra-corporeal rather than open anastomosis during laparoscopy and mechanical rather than hand-sewn anastomosis in open surgery. Consider PPE for caregivers during stoma management. Minimal invasive surgery is not discouraged, because there is little evidence for augmented risk. Specific procedures have to be followed and use of energy devices has to be limited. Training programs with COVID-19 + patients are not recommended. All staff in OR should be trained with specific courses on specific PPE use. Differentiate recommendations are presented for every district cancer. Surgical oncology during phase 2 should be guaranteed by individual and distinct protocols and pathways between cancer patients and COVID-19 + patients with resources specifically addressed to the two distinct kind of patients to limit diagnostic/therapeutic interferences or slowdowns. These recommendations are based on currently available evidence about management of oncologic patients during COVID-19 pandemic, were endorsed by the SICO Executive Board, and are considered suitable for nationwide diffusion. They will be subject to updates and revisions in case of new and relevant scientific acquisitions.","Cavaliere, Davide; Parini, Dario; Marano, Luigi; Cipriani, Federica; Di Marzo, Francesco; Macrì, Antonio; D’Ugo, Domenico; Roviello, Franco; Gronchi, Alessandro",Updates Surg,462,18

METHODS: ECIEN-2020 is an observational study conducted in a tertiary referral hospital in Navarra, Spain. It describes the effects of COVID-19 pandemic and the preventive measures adopted, in pediatric admissions for non-COVID-19 diseases. Admissions during March–June 2020 (first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Spain) are described and compared with the same quarter in 2019. A sub-analysis was performed delving into epidemiology. Patient characteristics (age, sex, past medical history), disease characteristics (symptoms, duration of symptoms, previous consultation in Primary Care Health Center), and admission characteristics (place and average stay) were analyzed. RESULTS: A 33% reduction in the number of pediatric hospital admissions was observed, decreasing from 529 hospitalizations in 2019 to 353 in 2020 (P < 0.001). This highlights a 48% reduction in patients admitted for pulmonary diseases. There were no significant changes in average hospital-stay, percentage of intensive care unit admissions, or in admissions for other reasons. Percentage of patients admitted among those seen in the emergency department rose from 5.1% in 2019 to 10.9% in 2020, whereas the total number of consultations in the emergency department decreased by 68%. CONCLUSION: The pandemic and the measures adopted due to SARS-CoV-2 have significantly decreased pediatric admissions for non-COVID-19 diseases, especially due to a reduction in the hospitalization for respiratory diseases.","Ramos-Lacuey, Beatriz; Herranz Aguirre, Mercedes; Calderón Gallego, Clara; Ilundain López de Munain, Andrea; Gembero Esarte, Eva; Moreno-Galarraga, Laura",World J Pediatr,462,24

The present study was designed to systematically and intensively investigate the epidemiological features of SAFV in pediatric patients in China. Three cohorts of pediatric patients were recruited from 2009 to 2012. Cohort 1 comprised patients with acute respiratory tract infections. Cohort 2 comprised patients with diarrhea. Cohort 3 comprised hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) patients. A total of 115 patients (1.6%) among 6052 (17/1647, 12/2013, and 86/2392 in cohorts 1, 2, and 3, respectively) were SAFV-positive. The samples from 82 SAFV-positive patients were successfully sequenced, and four genotypes were identified: 8 SAFV-1, 41 SAFV-2, 29 SAFV-3, and 4 SAFV-6. A significantly higher detection rate was found in the HFMD patients than in other two cohorts (both P <0.001). A higher frequency of severe clinical outcome and nervous system manifestation were also observed in the SAFV-positive HFMD patients. Additionally, 6 (3.5%) cerebrospinal fluid and 7 (2.2%) serum samples from the HFMD-associated encephalitis patients were SAFV-positive. Based on the VP1 sequences, all four genotypes displayed distinct geographical clustering.

Host immune defence is a key fitness determinant because it underlies the capacity of animals to resist or tolerate potential infections. Importantly, immune function can be suppressed, depressed, reconfigured or stimulated by exposure to rapidly changing environmental drivers like temperature, pollutants and food availability. Thus, hosts may experience trade-offs resulting from altered investment in immune function under environmental stressors. As such, approaches in ecoimmunology can provide powerful tools to assist in the conservation of wildlife. Here, we provide case studies that explore the diverse ways that ecoimmunology can inform and advance conservation efforts, from understanding how Galapagos finches will fare with introduced parasites, to using methods from human oncology to design vaccines against a transmissible cancer in Tasmanian devils. In addition, we discuss the future of ecoimmunology and present 10 questions that can help guide this emerging field to better inform conservation decisions and biodiversity protection. From better linking changes in immune function to disease outcomes under different environmental conditions, to understanding how individual variation contributes to disease dynamics in wild populations, there is immense potential for ecoimmunology to inform the conservation of imperilled hosts in the face of new and re-emerging pathogens, in addition to improving the detection and management of emerging potential zoonoses.","Ohmer, Michel E B; Costantini, David; Czirják, Gábor Á; Downs, Cynthia J; Ferguson, Laura V; Flies, Andy; Franklin, Craig E; Kayigwe, Ahab N; Knutie, Sarah; Richards-Zawacki, Corinne L; Cramp, Rebecca L",Conserv Physiol,462,21

We performed a cross-sectional bibliometric analysis between 23rd March and 14th April 2020. Three sources of data were used: (1) deaths per number of population for COVID-19/SARS-CoV-2 retrieved from John Hopkins University and Worldometer, (2) publications related to COVID-19/SARS-CoV-2 retrieved from World Health Organisation COVID-19 database, and (3) tweets of these publications retrieved from Altmetric.com and Twitter. In the analysis, the number of publications used was 1761, and number of tweets used was 751,068. Mapping of worldwide data illustrated that high Twitter activity was related to high numbers of COVID-19/SARS-CoV-2 deaths, with tweets inversely weighted with number of publications. Regression models of worldwide data showed a positive correlation between the national deaths per number of population and tweets when holding number of publications constant (coefficient 0.0285, S.E. 0.0003, p < 0.001).

We assessed the association of symptom status and medical comorbidities on mortality and hospitalization risk associated with COVID-19 in residents of a large nursing home system. Design Retrospective cohort study. Setting and Participants 1,970 residents from 15 nursing home facilities with universal COVID-19 testing in Maryland. Methods We used descriptive statistics to compare baseline characteristics, logistic regression to assess the association of comorbidities with COVID-19, and Cox regression to assess the association of asymptomatic and symptomatic COVID-19 with mortality and hospitalization. We assessed the association of comorbidities with mortality and hospitalization risk. Symptom status was assessed at the time of the first test. Maximum follow-up was 94 days. Results Among the 1,970 residents (mean age 73.8, 57% female, 68% Black), 752 (38.2%) were positive on their first test. Residents who were positive for COVID-19 and had multiple symptoms at the time of testing had the highest risk of mortality (HR 4.44; 95% CI: 2.97, 6.65) and hospitalization (SHR 2.38; 95% CI: 1.70, 3.33), even after accounting for comorbidity burden. Cases who were asymptomatic at testing had a higher risk of mortality (HR 2.92; 95% CI: 1.95, 4.35), but not hospitalization (HR 1.06; 95% CI: 0.82, 1.38) compared to those who were negative for COVID-19. Of 52 SARS-CoV-2 positive residents who were asymptomatic at the time of testing and were closely monitored for 14 days at one facility, only 6 (11.6%) developed symptoms. Conclusions and Implications Asymptomatic infection with SARS-CoV-2 in the nursing home setting was associated with increased risk of death suggesting a need for closer monitoring of these residents, particularly those with underlying cardiovascular and respiratory comorbidities.","Tang, Olive; Bigelow, Benjamin F.; Sheikh, Fatima; Peters, Matthew; Zenilman, Jonathan M.; Bennett, Richard; Katz, Morgan J.",J Am Med Dir Assoc,462,33

Despite evidence indicating that OUD may be particularly severe for women, preclinical models have yet to establish sex as a major factor in OUD. OBJECTIVES: Here, we examined sex differences in vulnerability to relapse following intermittent access fentanyl self-administration and protracted abstinence and used buprenorphine, the FDA-approved treatment for OUD, to test the validity of our model. METHODS: Following acquisition of fentanyl self-administration under one of two training conditions, male and female rats were given extended, 24-h/day access to fentanyl (0.25 μg/kg/infusion, 10 days) using an intermittent access procedure. Vulnerability to relapse was assessed using an extinction/cue-induced reinstatement procedure following 14 days of abstinence; buprenorphine (0 or 3 mg/kg/day) was administered throughout abstinence. RESULTS: Levels of drug-seeking were high following extended-access fentanyl self-administration and abstinence; buprenorphine markedly decreased drug-seeking supporting the validity of our relapse model. Females self-administered more fentanyl and responded at higher levels during subsequent extinction testing. Buprenorphine was effective in both sexes and eliminated sex and estrous phase differences in drug-seeking. Interestingly, the inclusion of a time-out during training had a major impact on later fentanyl self-administration in females, but not males, indicating that the initial exposure conditions can persistently impact vulnerability in females. CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate the utility of this rat model for determining sex and hormonal influences on the development and treatment of OUD.","Bakhti-Suroosh, Anousheh; Towers, Eleanor Blair; Lynch, Wendy J.",Psychopharmacology (Berl),462,26

ABSTRACT Introduction: SARS-CoV-2 was first detected in December 2019 in the Chinese city of Wuhan and has since spread across the world. At present, the virus has infected over 1.7 million people and caused over 100 000 deaths worldwide. Research is currently focused on understanding the acute infection and developing effective treatment strategies. In view of the magnitude of the epidemic, we conducted a speculative review of possible medium- and long-term neurological consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection, with particular emphasis on neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric diseases of neuroinflammatory origin, based on the available evidence on neurological symptoms of acute SARS-CoV-2 infection. Development: We systematically reviewed the available evidence about the pathogenic mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 infection, the immediate and lasting effects of the cytokine storm on the central nervous system, and the consequences of neuroinflammation for the central nervous system. Conclusions: SARS-CoV-2 is a neuroinvasive virus capable of triggering a cytokine storm, with persistent effects in specific populations. Although our hypothesis is highly speculative, the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on the onset and progression of neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric diseases of neuroinflammatory origin should be regarded as the potential cause of a delayed pandemic that may have a major public health impact in the medium to long term. Cognitive and neuropsychological function should be closely monitored in COVID-19 survivors.","Serrano-Castro, Pedro J.; Estivill-Torrús, Guillermo; Cabezudo-García, Pablo; Antonio Reyes-Bueno, José; Petersen, Nicolás Ciano; Aguilar-Castillo, María José; Suárez-Pérez, Juan; Jiménez-Hernández, María Dolores; Moya-Molina, Miguel Ángel; Oliver-Martos, Begoña; Arrabal-Gómez, Carlos; de Fonseca, Fernando Rodríguez",Neurologia,462,24

When compared to ""outdoor active"" days, ""indoor only"" days had 6,590 fewer steps per day (2,320 vs 8,876, p < 0.001), a longer sedentary time (1.5 hours, p < 0.001), longer lying time (1.4 hours, p < 0.001) and shorter standing (1.9 hours, p < 0.001) and stepping (1.3 hours, p < 0.001) times. The ""indoor and exercise"" days had a smaller number of steps compared to ""outdoor active"" (7,932 vs 8,876, p < 0.05). There is a strong relationship between reduced daily stepping, and increased sedentary time, with a range of poor health outcomes. This has important implications for public health policy and messaging during pandemics.","Speirs, Craig; Granat, Malcolm; Stamatakis, Emmanuel; Hamer, Mark",Scand. j. med. sci. sports,462,16

Participants were adults aged between 20 and 69 years selected from 13 prefectures where the government declared the state of emergency from April to May 2020. All selected participants were shopping or cooking foods for more than 2 days a week at the time of the survey. A total of 2,299 participants were included in the analysis. Dietary consciousness was measured using 12 items, and the construct was examined using factor analysis. Cronbach's alpha was examined as an indicator of internal validity, and the criterion-referenced validity was confirmed using the Kruskal-Wallis test. To determine changes in dietary consciousness, we calculated total scores based on changes in each item of the Dietary Consciousness Scale as follows: no change (0 points), improved (+1 point), and worsening (-1 point). The associations between the changes in dietary consciousness and characteristics or socioeconomic factors of the participants were examined using the chi-squared test and residual analysis.ResultsãExploratory and confirmatory factor analyses demonstrated that a model consisting of two factors fitted the data (GFI = 0.958, AGFI = 0.938, CFI = 0.931, RMSEA = 0.066). Cronbach's alpha of the first factor (importance of diet) was 0.838 and 0.734 for the second factor (precedence of diet), and the reliability was confirmed at 0.828 for the entire scale. In the examination of criterion-related validity, the higher the stage of change, the higher the total score of the scale, and a significant difference was observed (P<0.001). The percentage of participants whose precedence worsened was higher than the importance. Significant differences were observed regarding gender, age group, marital status, employment status, household annual income, and income change during the COVID-19 pandemic considering changes in both the importance and precedence of diet. Those who were in the ""worsening tendency"" group in both the importance and precedence were men, 20-29 years old, unmarried, full-time employees, with a household income of 4-6 million yen during the past year.ConclusionãDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, the precedence of diet worsened, compared to its importance, and men, young, or unmarried persons show a worsening of dietary consciousness.","Hayashi, Fumi; Takemi, Yukari; Akaiwa, Yuki; Ishikawa, Hirono; Fukuda, Yoshiharu",Nippon koshu eisei zasshi,462,1

The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus spike protein (SARS-CoV S) can be primed by a variety of host cell proteases, with proteolytic cleavage occurring both as the S1/S2 boundary and adjacent to a fusion peptide in the S2 domain. Here, we studied the priming of SARS-CoV S by elastase and show an important role for residue Thr(795) in the S2 domain. A series of alanine mutants were generated in the vicinity of the S2 cleavage site, with the goal of examining elastase-mediated cleavage within S2. Both proteolytic cleavage and fusion activation were modulated by altering the cleavage site position. We propose a novel mechanism whereby SARS-CoV fusion protein function can be controlled by spatial regulation of the proteolytic priming site, with important implications for viral pathogenesis.","Belouzard, Sandrine; Madu, Ikenna; Whittaker, Gary R.",J Biol Chem,462,1

Antibodies can be powerful biotherapeutics to fight viral infections. Here, we use the human apoferritin protomer as a modular subunit to drive oligomerization of antibody fragments and transform antibodies targeting SARS-CoV-2 into exceptionally potent neutralizers. Using this platform, half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) values as low as 9 × 10(−)(14) M are achieved as a result of up to 10,000-fold potency enhancements compared to corresponding IgGs. Combination of three different antibody specificities and the fragment crystallizable (Fc) domain on a single multivalent molecule conferred the ability to overcome viral sequence variability together with outstanding potency and IgG-like bioavailability. The MULTi-specific, multi-Affinity antiBODY (Multabody or MB) platform thus uniquely leverages binding avidity together with multi-specificity to deliver ultrapotent and broad neutralizers against SARS-CoV-2. The modularity of the platform also makes it relevant for rapid evaluation against other infectious diseases of global health importance.

Because ACE-2 may be modulated by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), there is concern that patients treated with ACEIs and ARBs are at higher risk of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia. AIM: This study sought to analyze the association of COVID-19 pneumonia with previous treatment with ACEIs and ARBs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 684 consecutive patients hospitalized for suspected COVID-19 pneumonia and tested by polymerase chain reaction assay. Patients were split into two groups, according to whether (group 1, n = 484) or not (group 2, n = 250) COVID-19 was confirmed. Multivariable adjusted comparisons included a propensity score analysis. RESULTS: The mean age was 63.6 ± 18.7 years, and 302 patients (44%) were female. Hypertension was present in 42.6% and 38.4% of patients in groups 1 and 2, respectively (P = 0.28). Treatment with ARBs was more frequent in group 1 than group 2 (20.7% vs. 12.0%, respectively; odds ratio [OR] 1.92, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.23–2.98; P = 0.004). No difference was found for treatment with ACEIs (12.7% vs. 15.7%, respectively; OR 0.81, 95% CI 0.52–1.26; P = 0.35). Propensity score-matched multivariable logistic regression confirmed a significant association between COVID-19 and previous treatment with ARBs (adjusted OR 2.36, 95% CI 1.38–4.04; P = 0.002). Significant interaction between ARBs and ACEIs for the risk of COVID-19 was observed in patients aged > 60 years, women, and hypertensive patients. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that ACEIs and ARBs are not similarly associated with COVID-19.

The development of targeted drugs is held back due to a limited understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the perturbation of cell physiology observed after viral infection. Recently, several approaches, aimed at identifying cellular proteins that may contribute to COVID-19 pathology, have been reported. Albeit valuable, this information offers limited mechanistic insight as these efforts have produced long lists of cellular proteins, the majority of which are not annotated to any cellular pathway. We have embarked in a project aimed at bridging this mechanistic gap by developing a new bioinformatic approach to estimate the functional distance between a subset of proteins and a list of pathways. A comprehensive literature search allowed us to annotate, in the SIGNOR 2.0 resource, causal information underlying the main molecular mechanisms through which severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and related coronaviruses affect the host–cell physiology. Next, we developed a new strategy that enabled us to link SARS-CoV-2 interacting proteins to cellular phenotypes via paths of causal relationships. Remarkably, the extensive information about inhibitors of signaling proteins annotated in SIGNOR 2.0 makes it possible to formulate new potential therapeutic strategies. The proposed approach, which is generally applicable, generated a literature-based causal network that can be used as a framework to formulate informed mechanistic hypotheses on COVID-19 etiology and pathology.","Perfetto, Livia; Micarelli, Elisa; Iannuccelli, Marta; Lo Surdo, Prisca; Giuliani, Giulio; Latini, Sara; Pugliese, Giusj Monia; Massacci, Giorgia; Vumbaca, Simone; Riccio, Federica; Fuoco, Claudia; Paoluzi, Serena; Castagnoli, Luisa; Cesareni, Gianni; Licata, Luana; Sacco, Francesca",Genes (Basel),462,10

Spike glycoprotein engages host Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors for entry into host cells, where the receptor recognition and attachment of spike glycoprotein to the ACE2 receptors is a prerequisite step and key determinant of the host cell and tissue tropism. Binding of spike glycoprotein to the ACE2 receptor triggers a cascade of structural transitions, including transition from a metastable pre-fusion to a post-fusion form, thereby allowing membrane fusion and internalization of the virus. From ancient times people have relied on naturally occurring substances like phytochemicals to fight against diseases and infection. Among these phytochemicals, flavonoids and non-flavonoids have been the active sources of different anti-microbial agents. We performed molecular docking studies using 10 potential naturally occurring compounds (flavonoids/non-flavonoids) against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and compared their affinity with an FDA approved repurposed drug hydroxychloroquine (HCQ). Further, our molecular dynamics (MD) simulation and energy landscape studies with fisetin, quercetin, and kamferol revealed that these molecules bind with the hACE2-S complex with low binding free energy. The study provided an indication that these molecules might have the potential to perturb the binding of hACE2-S complex.

Accurate reporting and registration of the reason for death are crucial in planning of health programs in turn contributing for the national development. BACKGROUND: All births and deaths occurring across India should be mandatorily registered per the Registration of Births and Deaths Act passed in the year 1969. The act also requires the issuance of cause of death certificate by the doctor attending the departed during his last illness. Data obtained from the cause of death certificate provides cause-specific mortality profile, which is required to analyze the health trends of the population. REVIEW RESULTS: This article discusses the available guidelines on the appropriate documentation of cause of death in the confirmed or suspected coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) infection resulting into death. CONCLUSION: Proper certification of the cause of death leads to better epidemic surveillance. Scrutiny of the clinical sequences from the cause of death certificate is useful to prioritize the allocation of resources for critical care management and to augment our knowledge about underlying causes resulting in mortality from COVID-19.

METHODS: A questionnaire survey was conducted among 108 participants with mild COVID-19 who have isolated at home under the guidance of doctors. The results of the questionnaire and outpatient data were integrated to evaluate participants’ compliance with various epidemic prevention measures. RESULTS: During isolation, most participants were able to follow epidemic prevention measures under the guidance of doctors.

Widespread lockdown and preventative measures have isolated individuals, affected the world economy, and limited access to physical and mental healthcare. While these measures may be necessary to minimize the spread of the virus, the negative physical, psychological, and social effects are evident. In response, technology has been adapted to try and mitigate these effects, offering individuals digital alternatives to many of the day-to-day activities which can no longer be completed normally. However, the elderly population, which has been worst affected by both the virus, and the lockdown measures, has seen the least benefits from these digital solutions. The age based digital divide describes a longstanding inequality in the access to, and skills to make use of, new technology.

The media reflect and reinforce cultural conventions and sense-making, offering a lens which shapes personal experiences and attitudes. How COVID-19 bereavement is reported therefore has important societal implications. We aimed to explore the reportage and portrayal of COVID-19 related bereavement in the top seven most-read British online newspapers during two week-long periods in March and April 2020. We conducted a qualitative document analysis of all articles that described grief or bereavement after a death from COVID-19. Analysis of 55 articles was informed by critical discourse analysis and Terror Management Theory, which describes a psychological conflict arising between the realisation that death is inevitable and largely unpredictable and the human need for self-preservation. We identified three main narratives: (1) fear of an uncontrollable, unknown new virus and its uncertain consequences—associated with sensationalist language and a sense of helplessness and confusion; (2) managing uncertainty and fear via prediction of the future and calls for behaviour change, associated with use of war metaphors; and (3) mourning and loss narratives that paid respect to the deceased and gave voice to grief, associated with euphemistic or glorifying language (‘passed away’, ‘heroes’). Accounts of death and grief were largely homogenous, with bereavement due to COVID-19 presented as a series of tragedies, and there was limited practical advice about what to do if a loved one became seriously ill or died. Reporting reflected the tension between focusing on existential threat and the need to retreat from or attempt to control that threat. While the impact of this reporting on the public is unknown, a more nuanced approach is recommended to better support those bereaved by COVID-19.","Sowden, Ryann; Borgstrom, Erica; Selman, Lucy E.",PLoS One,462,1

While investigating a human psittacosis outbreak that was associated with avian chlamydiosis in Hong Kong, we identified a novel adenovirus in epidemiologically linked Mealy Parrots, which was not present in healthy birds unrelated to the outbreak or in other animals. The novel adenovirus (tentatively named Psittacine adenovirus HKU1) was most closely related to Duck adenovirus A in the Atadenovirus genus. Sequencing showed that the Psittacine adenovirus HKU1 genome consists of 31,735 nucleotides. Comparative genome analysis showed that the Psittacine adenovirus HKU1 genome contains 23 open reading frames (ORFs) with sequence similarity to known adenoviral genes, and six additional ORFs at the 3′ end of the genome. Similar to Duck adenovirus A, the novel adenovirus lacks LH1, LH2 and LH3, which distinguishes it from other viruses in the Atadenovirus genus. Notably, fiber-2 protein, which is present in Aviadenovirus but not Atadenovirus, is also present in Psittacine adenovirus HKU1. Psittacine adenovirus HKU1 had pairwise amino acid sequence identities of 50.3–54.0% for the DNA polymerase, 64.6–70.7% for the penton protein, and 66.1–74.0% for the hexon protein with other Atadenovirus. The C. psittaci bacterial load was positively correlated with adenovirus viral load in the lung. Immunostaining for fiber protein expression was positive in lung and liver tissue cells of affected parrots, confirming active viral replication. No other viruses were found. This is the first documentation of an adenovirus-C. psittaci co-infection in an avian species that was associated with a human outbreak of psittacosis. Viral-bacterial co-infection often increases disease severity in both humans and animals. The role of viral-bacterial co-infection in animal-to-human transmission of infectious agents has not received sufficient attention and should be emphasized in the investigation of disease outbreaks in human and animals.","To, Kelvin K.

They were strongly encouraged to self-isolate but remain physically active in a safe manner. This study aimed to explore the indirect, negative effects of COVID-19 restrictions (collateral damage) by exploring to what extent adherence to such recommendations might have impacted the lives and health of older adults living in central Stockholm. Methods: An ad-hoc phone questionnaire was administered by trained staff between May and June 2020 to a random sample of older adults 68+ years old (n=1231), who had attended the regular follow-up assessment of the longitudinal Swedish National study on Aging and Care in Kungsholmen (SNAC-K) during 2016-2019. We explored three dimensions of collateral damage, namely psychological distress (feelings of worry, stress and loneliness), reductions in social and physical activities, and reductions in medical and social care use. Logistic regression models were used to test the association between age, sex, education and living arrangement, and the risk of collateral damage. Results: Vast majority of participants adhered to the recommendations, with over three quarters practicing self-isolation (n=928). Half of the sample reported psychological distress, 55.3% reported reductions in social or physical activity, and 11.3% reported decreased medical or social care use. Over three quarters of participants were affected by at least one of the three collateral damage dimensions. Female sex was the strongest sociodemographic predictor of individual as well as co-occurring dimensions of collateral damage. Conclusion: COVID-19 and its restrictions during the first half of 2020 have had a negative effect on the health and lives of a majority of elderly living in central Stockholm. Women were at a particularly higher risk of these negative consequences. We emphasize the need for predefined, evidence-based interventions to address these negative consequences.","Beridze, G.; Triolo, F.; Grande, G.; Fratiglioni, L.; Calderon-Larranaga, A.",,462,1

The risks factors and the consequences of delirium are well-documented in the literature; however, little is known about the personal experience of delirium. Delirium burden is common and tends to be distressing even after the delirium episode has resolved. Taking this in mind, the present work provides a first-person account of a doctor who acquired Covid-19 and developed bilateral pneumonia and had delirium and a complicate course of illness. During the course of his delirium, the patient recalled experiences of reality and unreality, complete disorientation, lack of control, strong emotions, and intense fear of dying which was significantly distressing. We anticipate that delirium burden will be common on these patients and family members and clinicians should be aware of this phenomenon in order to evaluate the neuropsychiatric consequences of this condition.","Arumi, Antonio; Bulbena-Cabre, Andrea; Bulbena, Antonio",Front Psychiatry,462,17

Tocilizumab, a drug targeting interleukin-6 administrated in the right timeframe may be beneficial in coronavirus-disease-2019 (COVID-19). We aimed to assess its benefit, drawing from observations in compassionately treated patients. Methods: In a retrospective case-control study, treatment effect (tocilizumab 400mg, single-dose) was assessed using three statistical methods: propensity-score matching, Cox multivariable survival and inverse probability score weighting (IPSW) analyses. Were included all patients hospitalized with COVID-19, who presented severity criteria with SpO2<96% despite O2-support >6L/min for more than 6 hours. Were excluded patients in critical care medicine department and those under invasive mechanical ventilation. Primary outcome was a composite of mortality and ventilation, with a maximum follow-up of 28 days. Results: 246 patients were included (106 treated by tocilizumab). They were 67.6 +/-15.3 years-old, with 95 (38.5%) women. Delay between first symptoms and inclusion was 8.4 +/-4.5 days. Overall, 105 (42.7%) patients presented the primary outcome, with 71 (28.9%) deaths during the 28-days follow-up. Propensity-score-matched 84 pairs of comparable patients. In the matched cohort (n=168), tocilizumab was associated with fewer primary outcomes (hazard ratio (HR)=0.49 (95% confidence interval (95CI)=0.3-0.81), p-value=0.005). These results were similar in the overall cohort (n=246), with Cox multivariable analysis yielding a protective association between tocilizumab and primary outcome (adjusted HR=0.26 (95CI=0.135-0.51, p=0.0001), confirmed by IPSW analysis (p<0.0001).

A deeper understanding of evolutionary implications of distinct viral genomic compositional aspects, as well as substantial advances in synthetic biology technologies, have provided a framework to achieve new viral attenuation strategies.

The relative humidity in the inpatient buildings reaches 65%–75% during summer, resulting in the regular appearance of microbial growth on indoor surfaces. The average outdoor air change rate measured through the CO(2) concentration decay method in the sampled inpatient rooms is 1.1 h(−1), which is 45% below the standard threshold. The CO(2) concentration in over 99% of the functional spaces is below the threshold of 1000 ppm. However, the dissatisfaction rate of the air freshness is higher than 25%, owing to the characteristics of healthcare activities. Insufficient fresh air volume and high supply air humidity ratio of the outdoor air system result in the inadequate dehumidification capacity and the over-humid environment in the inpatient buildings. From the perspective of indoor TVOC and PM2.5 concentration, a hospitable IAQ is achieved in the inpatient buildings. In the nurse unit, the illumination levels in public areas, such as patient corridors and nurse stations, are inadequate. The average noise levels (A) in the inpatient rooms and nurse stations are 50.7 and 61.6 dB, respectively, which exceeds the Chinese standard. According to the subjective survey, the dissatisfaction rates of overall IEQ in the summer for patients and visitors are 7.9% and 10.4%, respectively, while for staff it is 34.8%.

While the literature recommends the use of multidisciplinary teams in the management of patients with tracheostomy for other diseases, little is known on the collaborative administration of physical therapy and speech language pathology services in the COVID-19 population. PURPOSE: We sought to determine the outcomes of a collaboration between physical therapy (PT) and speech language pathology (SLP) in the treatment of patients who underwent tracheostomy placement as part of their treatment for COVID-19 at our facility. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective case series on patients with COVID-19 who had a tracheostomy. We included patients who had undergone mechanical ventilation for 14 days or longer, had a surgical tracheostomy, been discharged from intensive care to a medical unit, and received PT and SLP referrals. We compiled retrospective data from electronic medical records, analyzing days from tracheostomy to achievement of PT and SLP functional milestones, including mobility, communication, and swallowing. Of six critically ill patients with COVID-19 who had tracheostomy placement at our facility, three met inclusion criteria: patient 1, a 33-year-old woman; patient 2, an 84-year-old man; and patient 3, an 81-year-old man. For all patients, PT interventions focused on breathing mechanics, secretion clearance, posture, sitting balance, and upper and lower extremity strengthening. SLP interventions focused on cognitive reorganization, verbal and nonverbal communication, secretion management, and swallowing function. Intensity and duration of the sessions were adapted according to patient response and level of fatigue. RESULTS: We found that time to tracheostomy from intubation for the three patients was 23 days, 20 days, and 24 days, respectively. Time from tracheostomy insertion to weaning from ventilator was 9 days for patient 1, and 5 days for patient 2 and patient 3. Regarding time to achieve functional PT and SLP milestones, all patients achieved upright sitting with PT prior to achieving initial SLP milestone of voicing with finger occlusion. Variations in progression to swallowing trials were patient specific and due to respiratory instability, cognitive deficits, and limitations in production of an effortful swallow. Patient participation in therapy sessions improved following establishment of oral verbal communication. CONCLUSION: Interdisciplinary cooperation and synchronized implementation of PT and SLP interventions in three COVID-19 patients following prolonged intubation facilitated participation in treatment and achievement of functional milestones.

METHOD: In this retrospective cross-sectional study, 650 adult laboratory-confirmed hospitalized COVID-19 patients were included. Patients with comorbidities that may cause enlarged mediastinal lymphadenopathy were excluded. Demographics, clinical characteristics, vital and laboratory findings, and outcome were obtained from electronic medical records. Computed tomography scans were evaluated by two blinded radiologists. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to determine independent predictive factors of 30-day mortality. RESULTS: Patients with enlarged mediastinal lymphadenopathy (n = 60, 9.2%) were older and more likely to have at least one comorbidity than patients without enlarged mediastinal lymphadenopathy (p = 0.03, p = 0.003). There were more deaths in patients with enlarged mediastinal lymphadenopathy than in those without (11/60 vs 45/590, p = 0.01).

CONCLUSIONS: Though many participants identified COVID-19 as a threat, many failed to place themselves appropriately in the correct categories with respect to risk. This may indicate a need for additional public education for appropriately defining the risk of this novel pandemic.","Shauly, Orr; Stone, Gregory; Gould, Daniel",J Med Internet Res,462,16

There is a need for agility in clinical research, and the use of data science to develop predictive models for patient treatment is a potential solution. However, rapidly developing predictive models in healthcare is challenging given the complexity of healthcare problems and the lack of regular interaction between data scientists and physicians. Data scientists can spend significant time working in isolation to build predictive models that may not be useful in clinical environments. We propose the use of an agile data science framework based on the Scrumban framework used in software development. Scrumban is an iterative framework, where in each iteration larger problems are broken down into simple do-able tasks for data scientists and physicians. The two sides collaborate closely in formulating clinical questions and developing and deploying predictive models into clinical settings. Physicians can provide feedback or new hypotheses given the performance of the model, and refinement of the model or clinical questions can take place in the next iteration. The rapid development of predictive models can now be achieved with increasing numbers of publicly available healthcare datasets and easily accessible cloud-based data science tools. What is truly needed are data scientist and physician partnerships ensuring close collaboration between the two sides in using these tools to develop clinically useful predictive models to meet the demands of the COVID-19 healthcare landscape.","Lei, Howard; O’Connell, Ryan; Ehwerhemuepha, Louis; Taraman, Sharief; Feaster, William; Chang, Anthony",Intell Based Med,462,16

There is limited data on post-mortem imaging. We explore the proposition that PMCT could be used as screening test. In an 11-week period, 39 deceased persons were referred for medicolegal investigation with pre-existing or subsequent nasopharyngeal swabs showing positivity on SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR testing. All 39 had routine whole-body CT scans on admission and 12 underwent medicolegal autopsy. These cases were contrasted with 4 others which were negative on nasopharyngeal swabs despite PMCT findings suggestive of CoVID-19 pneumonia (designated false positive). Nine of the 12 autopsies showed lung histology consistent with those reported in CoVID-19 pneumonia. Typical clinical CoVID-19 lung findings on PMCT were only detected in 5 (42%). In 3 of the 4 false positive cases, lung findings showed non-COVID-19 histology but in 1, findings were identical. PMCT CoVID-19 findings in the lungs are therefore not specific and may not be detected in all cases due to obscuration by expected agonal CT findings or other pathologies that pre-dated SARS-CoV-2 infection. PMCT findings may otherwise be subtle. Although PMCT may hint at CoVID-19, we believe that nasopharyngeal swabs are still required for definitive diagnosis. Even with positive swabs, clinical CoVID-19 lung findings on PMCT are often not detected. PMCT findings can be subtle, extreme or obscured by agonal changes. Given this range of PMCT changes, the challenge for pathologists is to determine whether death has been caused by, or merely associated with, SARS-CoV-2 infection.","O’Donnell, Chris; Iles, Linda; Woodford, Noel",Forensic Sci Med Pathol,462,16

Elective medical procedures, including routine office visits, were restricted raising concerns regarding opioid and benzodiazepine provider and prescription availability. OBJECTIVE: To examine how the cancelation of elective medical procedures due to COVID-19 impacted the dispensing of opioid and benzodiazepine prescriptions in Texas. METHODS: Interrupted time series analyses were preformed to examine changes in prescription trends for opioids and benzodiazepines before and after the restriction on elective medical procedures. Samples of patients who filled an opioid or benzodiazepine prescription from January 5, 2020 to May 12, 2020 were identified from the Texas Prescription Monitoring Program. Elective medical procedures were restricted starting March 23, 2020 indicating the beginning of the intervention period. RESULTS: Restricting elective procedures was associated with a significant decrease in the number of patients (β = −6029, 95%CI = −8810.40, −3246.72) and prescribers (β = −2784, 95%CI = −3671.09, −1896.19) filling and writing opioid prescriptions, respectively. Also, the number of patients filling benzodiazepine prescriptions decreased significantly (β = −1982, 95%CI = −3712.43, −252.14) as did the number of prescribers (β = −708.62, 95%CI = −1190.54, −226.71).

With an increased infection and transmission rate, it is imperative to determine whether antibodies induced against the D614 isolate may cross‐neutralise against the G614 variant. METHODS: Antibody profiling against the SARS‐CoV‐2 S protein of the D614 variant by flow cytometry and assessment of neutralising antibody titres using pseudotyped lentiviruses expressing the SARS‐CoV‐2 S protein of either the D614 or G614 variant tagged with a luciferase reporter were performed on plasma samples from COVID‐19 patients with known D614G status (n = 44 infected with D614, n = 6 infected with G614, n = 7 containing all other clades: O, S, L, V, G, GH or GR). RESULTS: Profiling of the anti‐SARS‐CoV‐2 humoral immunity reveals similar neutralisation profiles against both S protein variants, albeit waning neutralising antibody capacity at the later phase of infection. Of clinical importance, patients infected with either the D614 or G614 clade elicited a similar degree of neutralisation against both pseudoviruses, suggesting that the D614G mutation does not impact the neutralisation capacity of the elicited antibodies. CONCLUSIONS: Cross‐reactivity occurs at the functional level of the humoral response on both the S protein variants, which suggests that existing serological assays will be able to detect both D614 and G614 clades of SARS‐CoV‐2. More importantly, there should be negligible impact towards the efficacy of antibody‐based therapies and vaccines that are currently being developed.","Lee, Cheryl Yi‐Pin; Amrun, Siti Naqiah; Chee, Rhonda Sin‐Ling; Goh, Yun Shan; Mak, Tze‐Minn; Octavia, Sophie; Yeo, Nicholas Kim‐Wah; Chang, Zi Wei; Tay, Matthew Zirui; Torres‐Ruesta, Anthony; Carissimo, Guillaume; Poh, Chek Meng; Fong, Siew‐Wai; Bei, Wang; Lee, Sandy; Young, Barnaby Edward; Tan, Seow‐Yen; Leo, Yee‐Sin; Lye, David C; Lin, Raymond TP; Maurer‐Stroh, Sebastien; Lee, Bernett; Wang, Cheng‐I; Renia, Laurent; Ng, Lisa FP",Clin Transl Immunology,462,22

Advanced neuroimaging and electrophysiological techniques have revealed new insights into the biological mechanisms underlying recovery of consciousness and have enabled the identification of preserved brain networks in patients who seem unresponsive, thus raising hope for more accurate diagnosis and prognosis. Emerging evidence suggests that covert consciousness, or cognitive motor dissociation (CMD), is present in up to 15–20% of patients with DoC and that detection of CMD in the intensive care unit can predict functional recovery at 1 year post injury. Although fundamental questions remain about which patients with DoC have the potential for recovery, novel pharmacological and electrophysiological therapies have shown the potential to reactivate injured neural networks and promote re-emergence of consciousness. In this Review, we focus on mechanisms of recovery from DoC in the acute and subacute-to-chronic stages, and we discuss recent progress in detecting and predicting recovery of consciousness.

The problem of food and nutritional insecurity is severe in urban centers, where the global population is projected to increase (%/year) by 1.84, 1.63, and 1.44 between 2015 to 2020, 2020 to 2025, and 2025 to 2030, and it will increase overall from 54% in 2016 to 60% by 2030. The number of megacities (>10 million people) will increase from 34 in 2015 to 41 by 2030. The COVID-19 pandemic has aggravated food insecurity in urban centers because of the disruption in the food supply chain, aggravation of the physical and economic barriers that restrict access to food, and the catastrophic increase in food waste because of labor shortages. Thus, there is a need to adopt more resilient food systems, reduce food waste, and strengthen local food production. Enhancing availability at the household and community levels through home gardening and urban agriculture is an important strategy. Food production within the cities include small land farming in households, local community gardens, indoor and rooftop gardens, vertical farming, etc. Home gardening can play an important role in advancing food and nutritional security during and after the COVD-19 pandemic, while also strengthening the provisioning of numerous ecosystem services (i.e., plant biodiversity, microclimate, water runoff, water quality, human health).

Much of the current research into the factors contributing to these declines has focused on exposure to drug residues, lead, and other toxins. Despite increased monitoring of these declining populations, little is known about infectious diseases affecting scavenger bird species. To assess potential infectious disease risks to both obligate and facultative scavenger bird species, we performed a serosurvey for eleven potential pathogens in three species of scavenging birds in California: the California condor (Gymnogyps californianus), turkey vulture (Cathartes aura) and golden eagle (Aquila chrysaetos). California condors were seropositive for avian adenovirus, infectious bronchitis virus, Mycoplasma gallisepticum, avian paramyxovirus-2, West Nile virus (WNV) and Toxoplasma gondii. Golden eagles were seropositive for avian adenovirus, Chlamydophila psittaci and Toxoplasma gondii, and turkey vultures were seropositive for avian adenovirus, Chlamydophila psittaci, avian paramyxovirus-1, Toxoplasma gondii and WNV. Risk factor analyses indicated that rearing site and original release location were significantly associated with a positive serologic titer to WNV among free-flying condors. This study provides preliminary baseline data on infectious disease exposure in these populations for aiding in early disease detection and provides potentially critical information for conservation of the endangered California condor as it continues to expand its range and encounter new infectious disease threats.","Straub, Mary H.; Kelly, Terra R.; Rideout, Bruce A.; Eng, Curtis; Wynne, Janna; Braun, Josephine; Johnson, Christine K.",PLoS One,462,28

We aimed to investigate predictors of FOC and normal vaginal birth among postpartum women who had planned for a normal vaginal birth. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted in 2019 with postpartum women during the first 24 h after the birth. A sample of 662 women, selected using a convenient sampling method, filled out the questionnaire composed of socio-demographic and obstetric questions and the Wijma Delivery-Expectancy Questionnaire (W-DEQ). We used multiple logistic regression analyses to determine predictors of FOC and normal vaginal birth. RESULTS: The percentage of women with mild (score ≤ 37), moderate (38–65), high (66–84), severe (85–99), and intense FOC (score ≥ 100) were 7.9, 19.5, 40.9, 21.1, and 10.6% respectively. Predictors of intense FOC were age < 30, primiparity, low maternal satisfaction with pregnancy, and a low level of perceived marital satisfaction. Overall, 21.8% of women gave birth by cesarean. Predictors of normal vaginal birth were birth weight < 4 kg, spontaneous onset of labor pain, mother’s age < 30, term pregnancy, having a doula, multiparity, satisfaction with husband’s support, and overall satisfaction with pregnancy. A high level of perceived marital/sexual satisfaction was a risk factor for cesarean. Mode of birth was not a predictor of postpartum FOC. CONCLUSIONS: The rate of severe and intense FOC among this group of postpartum women is high. Our findings highlight modifiable factors for reducing FOC and increasing normal vaginal birth. In designing programs to increase the rate of normal vaginal birth, the following factors should be considered: limiting induced labor, encouraging women to recruit a doula to help them at labor, facilitate husband’s attendance throughout antenatal/intrapartum, and postnatal care to support his wife, and pay attention to women’s common misunderstandings about the effect of vaginal birth on marital/sexual relationship. Our findings indicate that seeking novel ways to promote marital/sexual satisfaction and helping women to have a smooth, hassle-free pregnancy may contribute to a reduction in the rate of the FOC.

Investigate the mediating role of conformity behavior can influence the reviewers' creditworthiness on purchase. Thus, it examines the moderating effect of consumer involvement. The results show that the degree of consumer involvement moderates the relationship between reviewers' creditworthiness, and the purchase intention is achieved through the mediation of conformity behavior.

Blood eosinophil counts act as a convenient biomarker for asthma phenotyping and the selection of biologics, and they are even used as a prognostic factor for severe coronavirus disease 2019. However, the circulating eosinophil count does not always reflect tissue eosinophilia and vice versa. The mismatch of blood and tissue eosinophilia can be seen in various clinical settings. For example, blood eosinophil levels in patients with acute eosinophilic pneumonia are often within normal range despite the marked symptoms and increased number of eosinophils in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Histological studies using immunostaining for eosinophil granule proteins have revealed the extracellular deposition of granule proteins coincident with pathological conditions, even in the absence of a significant eosinophil infiltrate. The marked deposition of eosinophil granule proteins in tissue is often associated with cytolytic degranulation. Recent studies have indicated that extracellular trap cell death (ETosis) is a major mechanism of cytolysis. Cytolytic ETosis is a total cell degranulation in which cytoplasmic and nuclear contents, including DNA and histones that act as alarmins, are also released.

In this regard, the province-wise data from Nepal provides a unique opportunity to study the effective control strategies. This is because (a) some provinces of Nepal share an open-border with India, resulting in a significantly high inflow of COVID-19 cases from India; (b) despite the inflow of a considerable number of cases, the local spread was quite controlled until mid-June of 2020, presumably due to control policies implemented; and (c) the relaxation of policies caused a rapid surge of the COVID-19 cases, providing a multi-phasic trend of disease dynamics. In this study, we used this unique data set to explore the inter-provincial disparities of the important indicators, such as epidemic trend, epidemic growth rate, and reproduction numbers. Furthermore, we extended our analysis to identify prevention and control policies that are effective in altering these indicators. Our analysis identified a noticeable inter-province variation in the epidemic trend (3 per day to 104 per day linear increase during third surge period), the median daily growth rate (1 to 4% per day exponential growth), the basic reproduction number (0.71 to 1.21), and the effective reproduction number (maximum values ranging from 1.20 to 2.86).

Examples of such diseases include bovine viral diarrhea (BVD), infectious bovine rhinotracheitis (IBR), and Johne's disease (JD). The CPs vary between countries in the design and quality of collected data as well as methods used to detect infection and estimate prevalence or probability of freedom from infection. Differences in disease status between countries and non-standardized approaches to assess freedom from infection pose a risk for countries with CPs for non-regulated diseases as infected animals may influence the progress of the disease control or eradication program. The implementation of output-based standards allows estimation and comparison of the probability of freedom for non-regulated cattle diseases in European countries. The aim of the current study was to assess the existence and quality of data that could be used for estimating freedom from infection in European countries. The online data collection tool was sent to 32 countries participating in the SOUND control COST Action and was completed by 24 countries.

Various antibodies targeting S-protein have been developed to combat COVID-19 pandemic; however, the potential risk of antibody-dependent enhancement and novel spike mutants-induced neutralization loss or antibody resistance still remain. Alternative preventative agents or therapeutics are still urgently needed. In this study, we designed series of peptides with either ACE2 protecting or Spike-protein neutralizing activities. Molecular docking predicted that, among these peptides, ACE2 protecting peptide AYp28 and Spike-protein neutralizing peptide AYn1 showed strongest intermolecular interaction to ACE2 and Spike-protein, respectively, which were further confirmed by both cell- and non-cell-based in vitro assays. In addition, both peptides inhibited the invasion of pseudotype SARS-CoV-2 into HEK293T/hACE2 cells, either alone or in combination. Moreover, the intranasal administration of AYp28 could partially block pseudovirus invasion in hACE2 transgenic mice. Much more importantly, no significant toxicity was observed in peptides-treated cells. AYp28 showed no impacts on ACE2 function. Taken together, the data from our present study predicted promising preventative and therapeutic values of peptides against COVID-19, and may prove the concept that cocktail containing ACE2 protecting peptides and spike neutralizing peptides could serve as a safe and effective approach for SARS-CoV-2 prevention and therapy.","Chen, Jiang; Li, Song; Lei, Zhifeng; Tang, Qinmin; Mo, Ling; Zhao, Xing; Xie, Feifei; Zi, Dan; Tan, Jun",Int J Biol Sci,462,20
618083,618083,618083,Oral manifestations in COVID‐19 patients,16.824919,7.085396,2020-06-10,"The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic caused by infection with SARS-CoV-2 has created an urgent need for animal models to enable study of basic infection and disease mechanisms and for development of vaccines, therapeutics, and diagnostics. Most research on animal models for COVID-19 has been directed toward rodents, transgenic rodents, and non-human primates. The primary focus has been on the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is a host cell receptor for SARS-CoV-2. Among investigated species, irrespective of ACE2 spike protein binding, only mild (or no) disease has occurred following infection with SARS-CoV-2, suggesting that ACE2 may be necessary for infection but is not sufficient to determine the outcome of infection. The common trait of all species investigated as COVID models is their healthy status prior to virus challenge. In contrast, the vast majority of severe COVID-19 cases occur in people with chronic comorbidities such as diabetes, obesity, and/or cardiovascular disease. Healthy pigs express ACE2 protein that binds the viral spike protein but they are not susceptible to infection with SARS-CoV-2. However, certain pig breeds, such as the Ossabaw pig, can reproducibly be made obese and show most aspects of the metabolic syndrome, thus resembling the more than 80% of the critically ill COVID-19 patients admitted to hospitals. We urge considering infection with porcine respiratory coronavirus of metabolic syndrome pigs, such as the obese Ossabaw pig, as a highly relevant animal model of severe COVID-19.","Heegaard, Peter M.

Basile Cancer Institute to Protect Patients and Medical Personnel From COVID Infections: Effectiveness and Patient Satisfaction,16.73478,7.179361,2021-06-10,"OBJECTIVES: In this study, we aimed to study the clinical presentations, and viral clearance of SARS-COV-2 positive quarantined individuals. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: Governmental- designated facility in the eastern province, Saudi Arabia. PARTICIPANTS: 128 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 quarantined individuals who had a history of travel abroad in the last 14 days before the quarantine or were in direct contact with laboratory-confirmed cases. The study was from March 18th-till April 16th. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY MEASURES: The clinical presentation, prevalence of asymptomatic carriers among SARS-COV-2 positive quarantined subjects, and the difference between virus clearance among symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals. RESULTS: Sixty-nine of the 128 residents (54%) were completely asymptomatic until the end of the study. The remaining 59 residents (46%) had only mild symptoms. The most common symptom was a sudden loss of smell and taste, accounting for 47.5%. The median time to virus clearance was significantly different between the two groups. Symptomatic residents cleared the virus at a median of 17 days (95% CI, 12.4–21.6) from the first positive PCR vs. 11days (95% CI, 8.7–13.3) in the asymptomatic group (P = 0.011). False-negative test results occurred in 18.8% of the total residents and false-positive results in 3%. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of asymptomatic carriers among quarantined travelers and those identified by contact tracing is high in our study. Therefore, testing, tracing, and isolating travelers and contacts of laboratory-confirmed cases, regardless of symptoms, were very effective measures for early disease identification and containment. Loss of taste and smell were the most common presentations in our mild symptomatic residents and should be used as a screening tool for COVID-19. The persistent positive PCR beyond 14 days observed in the mild symptomatic residents despite being symptoms free, warrant further studies to determine its implications on disease spread and control.","Alshami, Alanoud; Alattas, Rabab; Anan, Hadeel; Alhalimi, Abdulbary; Alfaraj, Ahmed; Al Qahtani, Hadi",PLoS One,462,20

Nous avons voulu identifier les symptômes plus souvent associés à un frottis SRAS-CoV-2-positif chez les enfants non hospitalisés. MÉTHODES: Nous avons procédé à une étude observationnelle chez des enfants soumis au dépistage et suivis pour une infection à SRAS-CoV-2 confirmée sur des prélèvements de sécrétions nasales, nasopharyngées, de la gorge et autres (p. ex., aspiration nasopharyngée, sécrétions trachéales ou non spécifiées) entre le 13 avril et le 30 septembre 2020 en Alberta. Nous avons calculé les rapports de vraisemblance (RV) positifs entre les symptômes autodéclarés et les frottis SRAS-CoV-2-positifs dans la cohorte entière et dans 3 analyses de sensibilité : tous les enfants présentant au moins 1 symptôme, tous les enfants, symptomatiques ou non, soumis au dépistage par suite d’une recherche de contacts, et tous les enfants de 5 ans et plus. RÉSULTATS: Nous avons analysé les résultats chez 2463 enfants soumis au dépistage de l’infection à SRAS-CoV-2; 1987 enfants se sont révélés positifs et 476 négatifs. Parmi les enfants SRAS-CoV-2-positifs, 714 (35,9 %) n’ont déclaré aucun symptôme.

Few studies have examined respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections in adults. We assessed the characteristics and outcomes of RSV relative to other viral infections. Methods. Patients ≥50 years old with acute respiratory illness were recruited for studies of influenza vaccine effectiveness from 2004 through 2010. Nasopharyngeal swabs from enrollees were analyzed for the presence of RSV and other respiratory viruses by multiplex reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Clinical data were obtained from interview and medical records. Results. A total of 2225 samples were tested across all seasons. The mean age was 64.2 (SD, 10.7) years; the mean interval from illness onset to sample collection was 4 (SD, 2.2) days. One or more viruses were detected in 1202 (54%) participants. In a multivariable logistic regression model, RSV was associated with ages 65–79 years (vs 50–64 years), symptoms of cough, nasal congestion and wheezing, and longer interval from illness onset to clinical encounter. RSV was not associated with the presence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or congestive heart failure in univariate analyses. Hospital admission within 30 days after illness onset was less common among patients with RSV compared to those with influenza (unadjusted odds ratio = 0.54 [95% confidence interval, .29–1.01], P = .06). Conclusions. RSV is a common cause of acute respiratory illness in adults aged ≥50 years; the risk of infection increases with age. Delays in healthcare seeking and reduced risk of hospital admission in patients with RSV suggest a milder course of illness relative to influenza.","Sundaram, Maria E.; Meece, Jennifer K.; Sifakis, Frangiscos; Gasser, Robert A.; Belongia, Edward A.",Clin Infect Dis,462,22

METHODS: The outcomes of patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia after IHCA over a 40-day period were retrospectively evaluated. Between January 15 and February 25, 2020, data for all cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) attempts for IHCA that occurred in a tertiary teaching hospital in Wuhan, China were collected according to the Utstein style. The primary outcome was restoration of spontaneous circulation (ROSC), and the secondary outcomes were 30-day survival, and neurological outcome. RESULTS: Data from 136 patients showed 119 (87.5%) patients had a respiratory cause for their cardiac arrest, and 113 (83.1%) were resuscitated in a general ward. The initial rhythm was asystole in 89.7%, pulseless electrical activity (PEA) in 4.4%, and shockable in 5.9%. Most patients with IHCA were monitored (93.4%) and in most resuscitation (89%) was initiated <1 min. The average length of hospital stay was 7 days and the time from illness onset to hospital admission was 10 days. The most frequent comorbidity was hypertension (30.2%), and the most frequent symptom was shortness of breath (75%). Of the patients receiving CPR, ROSC was achieved in 18 (13.2%) patients, 4 (2.9%) patients survived for at least 30 days, and one patient achieved a favourable neurological outcome at 30 days. Cardiac arrest location and initial rhythm were associated with better outcomes. CONCLUSION: Survival of patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia who had an in-hospital cardiac arrest was poor in Wuhan.","Shao, Fei; Xu, Shuang; Ma, Xuedi; Xu, Zhouming; Lyu, Jiayou; Ng, Michael; Cui, Hao; Yu, Changxiao; Zhang, Qing; Sun, Peng; Tang, Ziren",Resuscitation,462,20

Using data from a 2016 nation-wide survey pertaining to influenza, (generalized) ordered logit models are developed to identify the factors associated with the relative frequency (never/sometimes/always) a household (a) isolates a sick child from others in the household, (b) keeps the sick child out of school/daycare, (c) stops the child's social activities, (d) has a parent stay home to care for the child, and (e) has another adult care for the child. Marital status is non-significant for isolation practices but is significant in caregiving. Married individuals are 25% more likely to report a parent always staying home with a sick child. Males are more likely to report never isolating a sick child (6%, 3%, and 2% for actions a, b, and c, respectively) and 3% more likely to never have a parent stay home. Individuals knowledgeable about the disease are 10% more likely to always keep a sick child home from school/daycare. Parents are 27% more likely to always stay home with an infant.

Highly sensitive and specific techniques are required to isolate and identify the rare TCR sequences that respond to antigens of interest. Here, we describe the use of mRNA sequencing via cross-linker regulated intracellular phenotype (CLInt-Seq) for efficient recovery of antigen-specific TCRs in cells stained for combinations of intracellular proteins such as cytokines or transcription factors. This method enables high-throughput identification and isolation of low-frequency TCRs specific for any antigen. As a proof of principle, intracellular staining for TNFα and IFNγ identified cytomegalovirus (CMV)- and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-reactive TCRs with efficiencies similar to state-of-the-art peptide-MHC multimer methodology. In a separate experiment, regulatory T cells were profiled based on intracellular FOXP3 staining, demonstrating the ability to examine phenotypes based on transcription factors. We further optimized the intracellular staining conditions to use a chemically cleavable primary amine cross-linker compatible with current single-cell sequencing technology. CLInt-Seq for TNFα and IFNγ performed similarly to isolation with multimer staining for EBV-reactive TCRs. We anticipate CLInt-Seq will enable droplet-based single-cell mRNA analysis from any tissue where minor populations need to be isolated by intracellular markers.","Nesterenko, Pavlo A.; McLaughlin, Jami; Cheng, Donghui; Bangayan, Nathanael J.; Burton Sojo, Giselle; Seet, Christopher S.; Qin, Yu; Mao, Zhiyuan; Obusan, Matthew B.; Phillips, John W.; Witte, Owen N.",Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,462,21

The vast majority of scientific articles dealing with nosocomial infections address bacterial or fungal infections, and viral agents are often disregarded. This analysis reviews the medical literature in an effort to establish the incidence, types of pathogens, and clinical features of noncongenital neonatal viral infections. METHODS: This analysis was performed using the worldwide database of health care–associated outbreaks (http://www.outbreak-database.com). Items analyzed included causative pathogens, types of infection, source of outbreaks, and measures taken to stop outbreaks. RESULTS: The outbreak database contained a total of 590 neonatal outbreaks, of which 64 were originated by viruses, 44 of which (68.75%) were reported from neonatal intensive care units (NICUs). The 5 most frequent viral agents were rotavirus (23.44%), respiratory syncytial virus (17.19%), enterovirus (15.63%), hepatitis A virus (10.94%), and adenovirus (9.38%). CONCLUSION: Our analysis of the viral origins of nosocomial infections in NICUs can be a valuable tool in the investigation of neonatal infections. The mortality rates reported in this analysis demonstrate the significance of noncongenital viral infections in NICUs and the need for more effective outbreak prevention strategies.","Civardi, Elisa; Tzialla, Chryssoula; Baldanti, Fausto; Strocchio, Luisa; Manzoni, Paolo; Stronati, Mauro",Am J Infect Control,462,16

Patients were confirmed with rt-PCR; treated and monitored in accordance with standard protocols. The primary endpoints were hospitalization and 30-day mortality RESULTS: Of the 93,571 patients, 22.6% had T2DM, with older age and higher BMI. Propensity Score matched evaluation resulted in significantly higher rates of hospitalization (1.5-fold), 30-day mortality (1.6-fold), and pneumonia (1.4-fold).

METHODS: This review utilized search engines such as google scholar, PubMed, ResearchGate, and web of science to retrieve articles and information using keywords like “Coronavirus”, “SARS-CoV-2”, “COVID-19”, “Origin of coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2”, “microbiology of coronavirus”, “microbiology of SARS-CoV-2”, COVID-19”, “Coronavirus reservoir sites”, “Anatomic sanctuary sites and SARS-CoV-2”, biological barriers and coronavirus”, biological barrier and SARS-CoV-2”. RESULTS: While this pandemic has caught the global scientific community at its lowest level of preparedness, it has inadvertently created a unified and wholesome approach towards developing potential vaccine (s) candidates by escalating clinical trial protocols in many countries of Europe, China and the United States. Interestingly, viral pathobiology continues to be an evolving aspect that potentially shows that the management of the current outbreak may largely depend on the discovery of a vaccine as the administration of known antiviral drugs are proving to offer some respite. Unfortunately, discontinuation and longtime administration of these drugs have been implicated in endocrine, reproductive and neurological disorders owing to the development of pathological lesions at anatomical sanctuary sites such as the brain and testis, as well as the presence of complex biological barriers that permit the entry of viruses but selective to the entrance of chemical substances and drugs. CONCLUSION: This review focuses on the microbiologic perspectives and importance of anatomical sanctuary sites in the possible viral rebound or reinfection into the system and their implications in viral re-entry and development of reproductive and neurological disorders in COVID-19 patients.","Azu, O.O.; Olojede, S.O.; Lawal, S.K.; Oseni, S.O.; Rennie, C.O.; Offo, U.; Naidu, E.C.",J Infect Public Health,462,20

The objective of this study was to assess the well-being, resilience, burnout, and wellness factors and needs of EM physicians and advanced practice providers (APPs) during the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: A longitudinal, descriptive, prospective cohort survey study of 213 EM physicians and APPs was performed across ten emergency departments in a single state, including academic and community settings. Participants were recruited via email to complete four weekly, voluntary, anonymous questionnaires comprised of customized and validated tools for assessing wellness (Well Being Index), burnout (Physician Work Life Study item), and resilience (Brief Resilience Scale) during the initial acceleration phase of COVID-19. Univariate and multivariate analysis with Chi-squared, Fisherâ€™s Exact, and logistic regression was performed. Results: Of 213 eligible participants, response rates ranged from 31 to 53% over four weeks. Women comprised 54 to 60% of responses. Nonrespondent characteristics were similar to respondents. Concern for personal safety decreased from 85% to 61% (p<0.001). Impact on basic self-care declined from 66% to 32% (p<0.001). Symptoms of stress, anxiety or fear was initially 83% and reduced to 66% (p=0.009). Reported strain on relationships and feelings of isolation affected >50% of respondents initially without significant change (p=0.05 and p=0.30 respectively). Women were nearly twice as likely to report feelings of isolation as men (OR 1.95; 95%CI 1.82-5.88). Working part-time carried twice the risk of burnout (OR, 2.45; 95% CI, 1.10-5.47). Baseline resilience was normal to high. Provider well-being improved over the four-weeks (30% to 14%; p=0.01), but burnout did not significantly change (30% to 22%; p=0.39). Conclusion: This survey of frontline EM providers during the initial surge of COVID-19 found that despite being a resilient group, the majority experienced stress, anxiety, fear, and concerns about personal safety due to COVID-19, with many at risk for burnout.

The DFT method at B3LYP/6-31+G(d,p) level of theory was used. Reactivity indices, transition structures theory, IGM and ELF analysis were employed to reveal the mechanism of the reaction. The addition of DZM to PSH takes place through a one-step mechanism and an asynchronous transition states. Eight possible addition channels of reaction were investigated (addition of C(sp2) to Diazomethane at C4, C5, C6 or C7). The addition of C (sp2) at C5 leading to P1 product is the preferred channel . The addition of ether does not affect the chemo-, regio- and stereo-selectivity of the reaction. Analysis of transfer of charges along the IRC path associated with the P1 product shows a polar character for the studied reaction. We have also used the noncovalent interaction (NCI) which is very helpful to reveal the most favored addition channel of the reaction, by analyzing the weak interactions in different TSs. Finally, we investigate about the potential of inhibition of some pyrazoline compounds against COVID-19-M(pro) by performing a molecular docking calculations.","Salah, M.; Belghiti, M.E.; Aitouna, A.O.; Zeroual, A.; Jorio, S.; El Alaoui Abdellaoui, H.; El Hadki, H.; Marakchi, K.; Komiha, N.",J Mol Graph Model,462,30

We investigated an initially unnoticed SARS-CoV-2 outbreak linked to schools in northern France, beginning as early as mid-January 2020. AIMS: This retrospective observational study documents the extent of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, linked to an affected high school (n = 664 participants) and primary schools (n = 1,340 study participants), in the context of unsuspected SARS-CoV-2 circulation and limited control measures. METHODS: Between 30 March and 30 April 2020, all school staff, as well as pupils and their parents and relatives were invited for SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing and to complete a questionnaire covering symptom history since 13 January 2020. RESULTS: In the high school, infection attack rates were 38.1% (91/239), 43.4% (23/53), and 59.3% (16/27), in pupils, teachers, and non-teaching staff respectively vs 10.1% (23/228) and 12.0% (14/117) in the pupils’ parents and relatives (p < 0.001). Among the six primary schools, three children attending separate schools at the outbreak start, while symptomatic, might have introduced SARS-CoV-2 there, but symptomatic secondary cases related to them could not be definitely identified. In the primary schools overall, antibody prevalence in pupils sharing classes with symptomatic cases was higher than in pupils from other classes: 15/65 (23.1%) vs 30/445 (6.7%) (p < 0.001). Among 46 SARS-CoV-2 seropositive pupils < 12 years old, 20 were asymptomatic. Whether past HKU1 and OC43 seasonal coronavirus infection protected against SARS-CoV-2 infection in 6–11 year olds could not be inferred. CONCLUSIONS: Viral circulation can occur in high and primary schools so keeping them open requires consideration of appropriate control measures and enhanced surveillance.","Fontanet, Arnaud; Tondeur, Laura; Grant, Rebecca; Temmam, Sarah; Madec, Yoann; Bigot, Thomas; Grzelak, Ludivine; Cailleau, Isabelle; Besombes, Camille; Ungeheuer, Marie-Noëlle; Renaudat, Charlotte; Perlaza, Blanca Liliana; Arowas, Laurence; Jolly, Nathalie; Pellerin, Sandrine Fernandes; Kuhmel, Lucie; Staropoli, Isabelle; Huon, Christèle; Chen, Kuang-Yu; Crescenzo-Chaigne, Bernadette; Munier, Sandie; Charneau, Pierre; Demeret, Caroline; Bruel, Timothée; Eloit, Marc; Schwartz, Olivier; Hoen, Bruno",Euro Surveill,462,16

It reflects that diseases are not randomly distributed in the population and that individuals have certain characteristics that predispose to, or protect against, a variety of different diseases. Disease is the result of an epidemiological triad, where disease results from the interaction of: the human host, an infectious agent or toxin, and the environment that promotes the exposure. This chapter focuses on the use of epidemiology to identify the source of diseases caused by microorganisms or toxins. Microorganisms are very efficient at infecting humans, using a number of different strategies and mechanisms. The deliberate dissemination of a biological agent by many of these mechanisms presents the latest challenge to public health. It requires a careful epidemiologic investigation to determine whether an outbreak of infectious disease is because of the intentional release of an agent, or is naturally occurring. A number of molecular techniques have been developed for sub typing bacteria, viruses, fungi, and protozoa, which will facilitate this investigation as well as identify clusters of related microorganisms.","MORSE, STEPHEN A.; KHAN, ALI S.",Microbial Forensics,462,20

The underrepresented minorities, where the prevalence of obesity is higher, appear to be affected disproportionately. Our objectives were to assess the characteristics and early outcomes of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in the Bronx and investigate whether obesity is associated with worse outcomes. Methods: This retrospective study included the first 200 patients admitted to a tertiary medical center with COVID-19. The electronic medical records were reviewed at least three weeks after admission. The primary endpoint was in-hospital mortality. Results: 200 patients were included (female sex: 102, African American: 102). The median BMI was 30 kg/m2. The median age was 64 years. Hypertension (76%), hyperlipemia (46.2%), and diabetes (39.5%) were the three most common comorbidities. Fever (86%), cough (76.5%), and dyspnea (68%) were the three most common symptoms. 24% died during hospitalization (BMI <25 kg/m2: 31.6%, BMI 25-34 kg/m2: 17.2%, BMI[≥]35 kg/m2: 34.8%, p= 0.03). The multivariate analysis for mortality, demonstrates that BMI[≥]35 kg/m2 (OR: 3.78; 95% CI: 1.45 - 9.83; p=0.006), male sex (OR: 2.74; 95% CI: 1.25 - 5.98; p=0.011) and increasing age (OR: 1.73; 95% CI: 1.13 - 2.63; p=0.011) were independently associated with higher inhospital mortality. Similar results were obtained for the outcomes of increasing oxygen requirement and intubation. Conclusions: In this cohort of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in a minority-predominant population, severe obesity, increasing age, and male sex were associated with higher in-hospital mortality and in general worse in-hospital outcomes.","Palaiodimos, L.; Kokkinidis, D.

More women than men have been charged and convicted of this offence signifying a reversal of usual patterns of prosecution and conviction. This analysis interrogates how section 5 criminalises women who have experienced domestic abuse. Drawing on a case observation, reported cases and media reports of cases, I suggest this offence derives from and perpetuates patriarchal constructs of motherhood. Grounded in a feminist approach building on women’s concrete experiences of law, I conclude that section 5 should be amended so that it is only used where it cannot be ascertained which defendant actively harmed a child.","Singh, Sarah",Fem Leg Stud,462,6

It has limited suitability for production of specialist metals that are required in relatively small quantities. An approach that limits environmental impact by restricting mining to high-grade deposits requires the investigation of small ore deposits as alternative sources of metals. The return on investment from small deposits is incompatible with the expensive surveys needed to secure investment and the high costs of managing risk. But increasing energy and transport costs may create space in the market for small-deposit mining with highly-competitive technological solutions. It can be argued that small-deposit mining is ethical because it must involve cooperation between mining companies and local residents who share a collective expectation and responsibility for their quality of life. However, small-deposit mining tends to be a limited, short-term initiative, which requires consideration of the extended ‘afterlife’ of mines. This manuscript is the culmination of five years of cross-sector dialogue and stakeholder engagement activities. It debates what constitutes a small deposit and describes the interactions between mining and manufacturing, investment, environment and society. It reaches the conclusion that technological innovations will support the re-emergence of small deposit mining as an important part of a diverse raw materials production sector. We do not suggest a return to past approaches, to mining of small, high-grade deposits, but a consideration of alternative narratives of localised, community-oriented mining processes, thus giving social, economic and environmental context to the needs of the present day.","Moore, K R; Whyte, N; Roberts, D; Allwood, J; Leal-Ayala, D R; Bertrand, G; Bloodworth, A J",,462,24

PURPOSE: We performed a scoping review to synthesize laboratory values described in the literature and their associations with mortality and disease severity. METHODS: We identified all primary studies involving laboratory values with clinical outcomes as a primary endpoint by performing data searches in various systematic review databases until 10th August, 2020. Two reviewers independently reviewed all abstracts (13,568 articles) and full text (1126 articles) data. A total of 529 studies involving 165,020 patients from 28 different countries were included. Investigation of the number of studies and patients from a geographical perspective showed that the majority of published literature from January–March 2020 to April–June 2020 was from Asia, though there was a temporal shift in published studies to Europe and the Americas. For each laboratory value, the proportion of studies that noted a statistically significant (p < 0.05) correlation with adverse clinical outcomes (e.g., mortality, disease severity) was tabulated. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Among frequently reported laboratory values, blood urea nitrogen was the most often reported predictor of mortality (91%); neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio was the most frequent statistically significant laboratory parameter in predicting disease severity (96%). This review highlights the temporal progression of laboratory value frequencies, as well as potentially distinct utilities of different markers for clinical outcomes of COVID-19. Future research pathways include using this collected data for focused quantitative meta-analyses of particular laboratory values correlated with clinical outcomes of mortality and disease severity.

The development of efficient drugs and vaccines against COVID-19 requires detailed knowledge about SARS-CoV-2 biology. Several techniques to detect SARS-CoV-2 infection have been established, mainly based on counting infected cells by staining plaques or foci, or by quantifying the viral genome by PCR. These methods are laborious, time-consuming and expensive and therefore not suitable for a high sample throughput or rapid diagnostics. We here report a novel enzyme-based immunodetection assay that directly quantifies the amount of de novo synthesized viral spike protein within fixed and permeabilized cells. This in-cell ELISA enables a rapid and quantitative detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection in microtiter format, regardless of the virus isolate or target cell culture. It follows the established method of performing ELISA assays and does not require expensive instrumentation. Utilization of the in-cell ELISA allows to e.g. determine TCID50 of virus stocks, antiviral efficiencies (IC50 values) of drugs or neutralizing activity of sera. Thus, the in-cell spike ELISA represents a promising alternative to study SARS-CoV-2 infection and inhibition and may facilitate future research. Highlights Determination of SARS-CoV-2 infection by enzymatically quantifying the expression of viral spike protein in bulk cell cultures Targeting a highly conserved region in the S2 subunit of the S protein allows broad detection of several SARS-CoV-2 isolates in different cell lines Screening of antivirals in microtiter format and determining the antiviral activity as inhibitory concentrations 50 (IC50)","Conzelmann, Carina; Gilg, Andrea; Groß, Rüdiger; Schütz, Desirée; Preising, Nico; Ständker, Ludger; Jahrsdörfer, Bernd; Schrezenmeier, Hubert; Sparrer, Konstantin M.

The composite occurrence of LPD in CM has been occasionally reported, and chronic inflammation in response to viral infection has been suggested to be at the basis of oncogenesis. Cancers can upregulate autophagy to endure microenvironmental stress and to increase local growth and aggressiveness. CM exhibit a dichotomous separation in low and high inflammatory grades (LIG vs. HIG). We studied 23 CMs using autophagy-related proteins and NanoString technology for gene expression. Autophagy-related proteins (Beclin-1, LAMP-1, LC3, and p62) were demonstrated in both tumor and stromal cells. ATG genes showed a progression of involvement in CM using an 8-gene signature. They were associated with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) encoded latent membrane protein 1 (EBV LMP1) activation. We suggest that CM can upregulate autophagy, creating a favorable environment for EBV-driven oncogenesis. To the best of our knowledge, the present study is the first to report on the TME using the expression of autophagy-related genes and proteins in CM.

This is no longer a threat but a reality affecting us, our children, and the generations that follow. Pregnant mothers, their fetuses, and their children are among those at greatest risk in every population and every jurisdiction. A timely consideration is the health of racialized groups who are particularly vulnerable owing to the confluence of several risk factors that are compounded by climate change. Included among these are Indigenous communities that are the most directly threatened by climate change. This review discusses the main health challenges faced by mothers, fathers, and their children during the climate crisis, focusing on mental health as a causal factor. Exploration of this topic includes the role of prenatal maternal and paternal stresses, allostatic load, and the effect of degradation of the environment and ecosystems on individuals. These will be examined in relation to adverse pregnancy outcomes and altered developmental trajectories of children. The climate crisis is a health threat multiplier that amplifies the health inequities of the most at-risk populations and individuals. It accelerates the increase in allostatic load of those at risk. The path of tragedy begins with an accumulating allostatic load that overwhelms both individual and socio-ecological resilience. This can lead to worse mental health including depression and anxiety and, in the case of pregnant women and their children, more adverse pregnancy outcomes and impaired developmental trajectories for their newborn children. We argue that there is an urgent need to develop new (or re-discover or re-purpose existing) tools that will predict communities and individuals who are experiencing the highest levels of climate-related hazards and intervene to reduce stress and increase resilience in pre-conceptual women and men, pregnant and post-partum women, and their young children.","Olson, David M.; Metz, Gerlinde A.S.",F1000Res,462,23

This study compared the results from sequencing the SARS-CoV-2 genome using R9 vs R10 flow cells and a Rapid Barcoding Kit (RBK) vs a Ligation Sequencing Kit (LSK). The R9 chemistry provided a lower error rate (3.5%) than R10 chemistry (7%). The SARS-CoV-2 genome includes few homopolymeric regions. Longest homopolymers were composed of 7 (TTTTTTT) and 6 (AAAAAA) nucleotides. The R10 chemistry resulted in a lower rate of deletions in thymine and adenine homopolymeric regions than the R9, at the expenses of a larger rate (~10%) of mismatches in these regions. The LSK had a larger yield than the RBK, and provided longer reads than the RBK. It also resulted in a larger percentage of aligned reads (99 vs 93%) and also in a complete consensus genome. The results from this study suggest that the LSK preparation library provided longer DNA fragments which contributed to a better assembly of the SARS-CoV-2, despite an impaired detection of variants in a R10 flow cell. Nanopore sequencing could be used in epidemiological surveillance of SARS-CoV-2. KEY POINTS: • Sequencing SARS-CoV-2 genome is of great importance for the pandemic surveillance. • Nanopore offers a low cost and accurate method to sequence SARS-CoV-2 genome. • Ligation sequencing is preferred rather than the rapid kit using transposases.","González-Recio, Oscar; Gutiérrez-Rivas, Mónica; Peiró-Pastor, Ramón; Aguilera-Sepúlveda, Pilar; Cano-Gómez, Cristina; Jiménez-Clavero, Miguel Ángel; Fernández-Pinero, Jovita",Appl Microbiol Biotechnol,462,20

The outlook for the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic necessitates the development of protocols to sustain timely and effective acute stroke care while mitigating healthcare-associated transmission.","Moshayedi, Pouria; Ryan, Timothy E.; Mejia, Lucido Luciano Ponce; Nour, May; Liebeskind, David S.",Front Neurol,462,16

However, even if desire to help (Want) is low, intention to help may still occur if the expectancy regarding the perceived effectiveness of helping is high. We tested these predictions in a set of three experimental studies. In all three, we measured the desire to help (Want) and the Expectancy that the aid would be impactful for the victim; in addition, we manipulated Expectancy in Study 3. In Studies 1 and 3, we measured the participants’ declaration to help while in Study 2, their helping behavior was examined. In all three studies, we used variations of the same story about a victim. The results supported our hypothesis. Thus, the studies help to tease apart the determinants of helping under conditions of lowered desire to do so, an issue of great importance in public policymaking.

It has been validated to assess the risk of 1-month to 2-year mortality in frail older patients during hospitalization and after hospital discharge. However, whether the MPI is a valid prognostic tool for follow-up periods of different lengths remains to be validated. To this end, we followed up 80 hospitalized patients (female=37, male 43) at least 75 years of age (mean age=82.6±4.4, range=75-94 years) to assess the 3-month all-cause mortality (mean follow-up=61.0 ± 31.7 months [range 4-90 days]). Accordingly, patients were subdivided into low (MPI-1, score 0-0.33), moderate (MPI-2, score 0.34-0.66) and high (MPI-3, score 0.67-1) mortality risk classes. Moreover, baseline biochemical, inflammatory and metabolic parameters, as well as anamnestic and clinical characteristics, were obtained. Although the MPI-3 score was significantly associated with 3-month all-cause mortality in univariate analysis (HR=5.79, 95%CI=1.77-18.92, p=0.004), a multivariate model indicated that only low albumin (HR=0.33, 95%CI=0.16-0.68, p=0.003) and high IL6 (HR=1.01, 95%CI=1.00-1.02, p=0.010) levels were significantly associated with 3-month all-cause mortality. In conclusion, we suggest that measurement of IL6 as well as albumin, rather than the MPI score, may help in providing tailored therapeutic interventions to decrease short term mortality in older hospitalized individuals.","Rizza, Stefano; Morabito, Pasquale; De Meo, Livia; Farcomeni, Alessio; Testorio, Giulia; Cardellini, Marina; Ballanti, Marta; Davato, Francesca; Pecchioli, Chiara; Di Cola, Giovanni; Mavilio, Maria; Federici, Massimo",Aging Dis,462,26

However, their common genetic and biologic features remain elusive. Here we interrogate a total of 165 antibodies from eight COVID-19 patients, and find that potent nAbs from different patients have disproportionally high representation of IGHV3-53/3-66 usage, and therefore termed as public antibodies. Crystal structural comparison of these antibodies reveals they share similar angle of approach to RBD, overlap in buried surface and binding residues on RBD, and have substantial spatial clash with receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) in binding to RBD. Site-directed mutagenesis confirms these common binding features although some minor differences are found. One representative antibody, P5A-3C8, demonstrates extraordinarily protective efficacy in a golden Syrian hamster model against SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, virus escape analysis identifies a single natural mutation in RBD, namely K417N found in B.1.351 variant from South Africa, abolished the neutralizing activity of these public antibodies. The discovery of public antibodies and shared escape mutation highlight the intricate relationship between antibody response and SARS-CoV-2, and provide critical reference for the development of antibody and vaccine strategies to overcome the antigenic variation of SARS-CoV-2.","Zhang, Qi; Ju, Bin; Ge, Jiwan; Chan, Jasper Fuk-Woo; Cheng, Lin; Wang, Ruoke; Huang, Weijin; Fang, Mengqi; Chen, Peng; Zhou, Bing; Song, Shuo; Shan, Sisi; Yan, Baohua; Zhang, Senyan; Ge, Xiangyang; Yu, Jiazhen; Zhao, Juanjuan; Wang, Haiyan; Liu, Li; Lv, Qining; Fu, Lili; Shi, Xuanling; Yuen, Kwok Yung; Liu, Lei; Wang, Youchun; Chen, Zhiwei; Zhang, Linqi; Wang, Xinquan; Zhang, Zheng",Nat Commun,462,12

This study aims to highlight strengths and provide recommendations to improve adoption of future contact tracing developments. DESIGN: A 60-item, anonymous online questionnaire, disseminated through social media outlets and email lists by a team from Imperial College London. SETTING: England. PARTICIPANTS: Convenience sample of 1036 responses, from participants aged 18 years and above, between December 2020 and January 2021. PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Evaluate the compliance and public attitude towards the ‘NHS COVID-19’ app regarding its functionality and features. This included whether participants’ expectations were met, and their thoughts on the app privacy and security. Furthermore, to distinguish how usability, perception, and adoption differed with varying demographics and user values. RESULTS: Fair compliance with the app features was identified, meeting expectations of the 62.1% of participants who stated they downloaded it after weighted analysis. However, participants finding the interface challenging were less likely to read information in the app and had a lesser understanding of its functionality. Furthermore, little understanding regarding the app’s functionality and privacy concerns was a possible reason why users did not download it. A readability analysis of the text revealed information within the app was conveyed at a level that may be too complex for up to 43% of the UK population. The study highlighted issues related to the potential of false positives caused by the design choices in the ‘Check-In’ feature. CONCLUSION: This study showed that while the ‘NHS COVID-19’ app was viewed positively, there remained issues regarding participants’ perceived knowledge of app functionality, potentially affecting compliance. Therefore, we recommended improvements regarding the delivery and presentation of the app’s information, and highlighted the potential need for the ability to check out of venues to reduce the number of false positive contacts.","Panchal, Marcus; Singh, Sukhpreet; Rodriguez-Villegas, Esther",BMJ Open,462,29

On the basis of postmodern education theories, this study adopted images and oral accounts involving personal experiences to construct a postmodern education research scheme by using the method of collaborative ethnography. This study selected and performed the following services: filming a community documentary, administering community health dance classes, and archiving community cultural artifacts in databases. Interviews were also administered to facilitate implementation of the actual services. Community health services commonly seen in Taiwan and abroad were compiled, and the resources required for each service were examined. Subsequently, factor analysis was performed to explore the characteristic of these services in order to recommend feasible services for university students to undertake. The results indicated that the eight resources required for the 59 common community health services were (1) a designated space or venue, (2) materials, (3) monetary resources, (4) human resources, (5) expertise, (6) professional equipment, (7) patience, and (8) empathy. The results revealed three principal components, namely labor services, high-resource services, and professional services, for a total explanatory power of 67.99%; the individual explanatory power of these components accounted for 25.04%, 21.81%, and 21.15%, respectively. Next, community health care services suitable for university students to perform were selected and implemented, and these services were well received. The study results indicated that community and environmental justice can be realized by identifying with the value of community health services and promoting postmodern education theories and social norms. The research results are suitable for implementation after the COVID-19 pandemic.","Shyu, Guey-Shin; Lin, Shinn-Jou; Fang, Wei-Ta; Cheng, Bai-You",Int J Environ Res Public Health,462,13

COVID-19, as of July 3, 2021, yielded 182 million confirmed cases and 3.9 million deaths globally according to the World Health Organization. Several patients who were initially diagnosed with mild or moderate COVID-19 later deteriorated and were reclassified to severe disease type. OBJECTIVE: The aim is to create a predictive model for COVID-19 ventilatory support and mortality early on from baseline (at the time of diagnosis) and routinely collected data of each patient (CXR, CBC, demographics, and patient history). METHODS: Four common machine learning algorithms, three data balancing techniques, and feature selection are used to build and validate predictive models for COVID-19 mechanical requirement and mortality. Baseline CXR, CBC, demographic, and clinical data were retrospectively collected from April 2, 2020, till June 18, 2020, for 5739 patients with confirmed PCR COVID-19 at King Abdulaziz Medical City in Riyadh. However, of those patients, only 1508 and 1513 have met the inclusion criteria for ventilatory support and mortalilty endpoints, respectively. RESULTS: In an independent test set, ventilation requirement predictive model with top 20 features selected with reliefF algorithm from baseline radiological, laboratory, and clinical data using support vector machines and random undersampling technique attained an AUC of 0.87 and a balanced accuracy of 0.81. For mortality endpoint, the top model yielded an AUC of 0.83 and a balanced accuracy of 0.80 using all features with balanced random forest. This indicates that with only routinely collected data our models can predict the outcome with good performance. The predictive ability of combined data consistently outperformed each data set individually for intubation and mortality. For the ventilator support, chest X-ray severity annotations alone performed better than comorbidity, complete blood count, age, or gender with an AUC of 0.85 and balanced accuracy of 0.79. For mortality, comorbidity alone achieved an AUC of 0.80 and a balanced accuracy of 0.72, which is higher than models that use either chest radiograph, laboratory, or demographic features only. CONCLUSION: The experimental results demonstrate the practicality of the proposed COVID-19 predictive tool for hospital resource planning and patients’ prioritization in the current COVID-19 pandemic crisis.","Aljouie, Abdulrhman Fahad; Almazroa, Ahmed; Bokhari, Yahya; Alawad, Mohammed; Mahmoud, Ebrahim; Alawad, Eman; Alsehawi, Ali; Rashid, Mamoon; Alomair, Lamya; Almozaai, Shahad; Albesher, Bedoor; Alomaish, Hassan; Daghistani, Rayyan; Alharbi, Naif Khalaf; Alaamery, Manal; Bosaeed, Mohammad; Alshaalan, Hesham",J Multidiscip Healthc,462,16

Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) is caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome–Coronavirus—2 (SARS-COV2) and is an emergent pandemic for which no cure exist at the moment. Several drugs have been tried often with scant clinical evidence and safety. CASE PRESENTATION: Here we report the case of 78-years-old woman with cardiometabolic syndrome and COVID-19. A multidrug regimen including others hydroxychloroquine, antibiotics, dexamethasone and paracetamol, low-molecular-weight-heparin and potassium canrenoate was started. After almost 3 weeks, the patient started to display a violaceous rash initially involving the flexural folds atypical targetoid lesions and showing a very fast extension, blister formation and skin detachments of approximately 70% of the total body surface area and mucous membranes involvement consistent with toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN). The ALDEN algorithm was calculated inserting all drugs given to the patient in the 28 days preceding the onset of the skin manifestations. The highest score retrieved was for hydroxychloroquine. Other less suspicious drugs were piperacillin/tazobactam, ceftriaxone and levofloxacin. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first case of TEN in a patient suffering from COVID-19 probably associated with hydroxychloroquine. Given the activation of the immune system syndrome induced by the virus and the widespread off-label use of this drug, we suggest a careful monitoring of skin and mucous membranes in all COVID-19 positive patients treated with hydroxychloroquine in order to early detect early signs of toxicities.","Rossi, Carlo Maria; Beretta, Flavio Niccolò; Traverso, Grazia; Mancarella, Sandro; Zenoni, Davide",Clin Mol Allergy,462,26

Modified Buda scoring system for interstitial lung disease (ILD) was used to evaluate the severity and treatment effect of COVID-19 on ultrasonography. The differences between modified lung ultrasound (MLUS) score and high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) Warrick score were analyzed to evaluate their correlation. COVID-19 showed the following sonographic features: thickening (12/12), blurred (9/12), discontinuous (6/12) pleural line; rocket sign (4/12), partially diffused B-line (12/12), completely diffused B-line (10/12), waterfall sign (4/12); C-line sign (5/12); pleural effusion (1/12), and pulmonary balloon (Am line, 1/12). The last two features were rarely seen. Differences of ultrasonic features, including lesion range, lung signs and pneumonia-related complications, between COVID-19 and CAP were statistically significant (P<0.05 or 0.001).

When faced with a new pathogen, such as SARS-CoV-2, it is highly desirable to be able to forecast the case fatality rate (CFR) into the future. Considerable effort has been invested towards the development of a mathematical framework for predicting virulence evolution. Although these approaches accurately recapitulate some complex outcomes, most rely on an assumed trade-off between mortality and infectivity. It is often impractical to empirically validate this constraint for human pathogens. RESULTS: Using a compartment model with parameters tuning the degree to which symptomatic individuals are isolated and the duration of immunity, we reveal kinetic constraints where the variation of multiple parameters in concert leads to decreased virulence and increased pathogen fitness, whereas independent variation of the parameters decreases pathogen fitness. Smallpox, SARS-CoV-2, and Influenza are analyzed as diverse representatives of human respiratory viruses. We show that highly virulent viruses, such as Smallpox, are likely often constrained by host behavior, whereas moderately virulent viruses, such as SARS-CoV-2, appear to be typically constrained by the relationship between the duration of immunity and CFR. CONCLUSIONS: The evolution of human respiratory epidemics appears to be often kinetically constrained and a reduction in virulence should not be assumed. Our findings imply that, without continued public health intervention, SARS-CoV-2 is likely to continue presenting a substantial disease burden. The existence of a parameter regime admitting endemic equilibrium suggests that herd immunity is unachievable. However, we demonstrate that even partial isolation of symptomatic individuals can have a major effect not only by reducing the number of fatalities in the short term but also by potentially changing the evolutionary trajectory of the virus towards reduced virulence.","Rochman, Nash D.; Wolf, Yuri I.; Koonin, Eugene V.",medRxiv,462,24

Although no negative testing was performed between the two symptomatic bouts, this case raises the possibility of reinfection after controlling the virus and highlights the long period with which a patient can shed virus and experience symptoms after initial infection.

A great variety of chemical agents, microorganisms, and biotoxins can cause diarrhea, acute or persistent, slight or serious. From the epidemiological point of view, the cases can be sporadic or epidemic, and identification of the infection source and transmission mechanism is important for prevention and control. Knowledge of the etiology is a great help. The entrance route to the human body is usually through the digestive system. From some source in an individual's surroundings, the causal agent somehow reaches the mouth of the susceptible person. The hands play a fundamental role in many situations. This article revises the most important epidemiological characteristics of the agents that produce diarrhea as a main symptom, placing an emphasis on epidemiological point of view and environmental transmission mechanisms. Some aspects regarding individual susceptibility (genetic or other types) are also mentioned. Because the long-term consequences of infectious gastroenteritis are less well known, a small section dedicated to the long-term consequences of infectious gastroenteritis has been included. With suitable prevention, not only the acute consequences but also the aftereffects of these diseases can be avoided.","Bellido-Blasco, J.B.; Arnedo-Pena, A.",Encyclopedia of Environmental Health,462,24

METHODS: A population-based cohort study was conducted utilizing an amended International Obstetric Surveillance System protocol. Data on pregnant women with SARS-CoV-2 infection, hospitalized between April 14, 2020, and November 24, 2020, were analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 36 hospitals submitted data on 673 infected hospitalized pregnant women; 217 (32.2%) were admitted for COVID-19 illness and 456 for other indications. There were 39 deaths with a case fatality rate of 6.3%: 32 (14.7%) deaths occurred in women admitted for COVID-19 illness compared to 7 (1.8%) in women admitted for other indications. Of the women, 106 (15.9%) required critical care. Maternal tuberculosis, but not HIV co-infection or other co-morbidities, was associated with admission for COVID-19 illness. Rates of cesarean delivery did not differ significantly between women admitted for COVID-19 and those admitted for other indications. There were 179 (35.4%) preterm births, 25 (4.7%) stillbirths, 12 (2.3%) neonatal deaths, and 162 (30.8%) neonatal admissions. Neonatal outcomes did not differ significantly from those of infected women admitted for other indications. CONCLUSION: The maternal mortality rate was high among women admitted with SARS-CoV-2 infection and higher in women admitted primarily for COVID-19 illness with tuberculosis being the only co-morbidity associated with admission.","Budhram, Samantha; Vannevel, Valerie; Botha, Tanita; Chauke, Lawrence; Bhoora, Shastra; Balie, Gaynor M; Odell, Natalie; Lombaard, Hennie; Wise, Amy; Georgiou, Chrysanthi; Ngxola, Nondumiso; Wynne, Emma; Mbewu, Unati; Mabenge, Mfundo; Phinzi, Sibusiso; Gubu-Ntaba, Nontsikelelo; Goldman, Gareth; Tunkyi, Kay; Prithipal, Sudhir; Naidoo, Keshree; Venkatachalam, Santhi; Moodley, Terence; Mould, Sean; Hlabisa, Mzuvele; Govender, Logie; Maistry, Charlene; Habineza, John P; Israel, Priya; Foolchand, Serantha; Tsibiyane, Nomandla V; Panday, Mala; Soma-Pillay, Priya; Adam, Sumaiya; Molokoane, Felicia; Mojela, Matthew S; van Rensburg, Elizabeth J; Mashamba, Tshililo; Matjila, Mushi; Fawcus, Sue; Osman, Ayesha; Venter, Mareli; Petro, Gregory; Fakier, Ahminah; Langenegger, Eduard; Cluver, Catherine A; Bekker, Adrie; de Waard, Liesl; Stewart, Chantal; Ngene, Nnabuike C; Lunda, Ongombe",Int. j. gynaecol. obstet,462,10

The present results showed that the seroprevalence of anti-HEV IgG and anti-HEV IgM in schizophrenia were significantly higher than that in healthy controls. Anti-HEV IgG positivity increased with age and with the duration of disease in schizophrenia patients. Moreover, schizophrenia patients with increased CD4(+)/CD8(+) T-cell ratios (>2.03) had higher anti-HEV IgG detection rates than those with normal ratios (1.05-2.03). Compared with the schizophrenia patients who tested anti-HEV IgG negative, the levels of interleukin-4 and interleukin-10 (Th2 cytokines) were significantly higher, while the interleukin-12 (Th1 cytokine) level was significantly lower, in those with anti-HEV IgG positivity. Of five schizophrenia patients who were anti-HEV IgM positive, four had elevated CD4(+)/CD8(+) T-cell ratios. HEV RNA was isolated from one of these four patients and classified as genotype 4. Anti-HEV IgM positivity was not detected among healthy controls.

The virus has currently evolved into three separated groups including US, China and Southeast Asia (SEA) groups. In Vietnam, PDCoV was first reported in 2015. Based on phylogenetic analyses of spike, membrane and nucleocapsid genes, it is suggested that Vietnam PDCoV is chimeric virus. In the present study, we retrospectively investigated the presence of PDCoV in Vietnam and the full‐length genomes of six PDCoV isolates identified in 2014–2016 were further characterized. The results demonstrated that Vietnam PDCoV was first detected as early as 2014. All six Vietnam PDCoV are in the SEA group and further divided into two separated subgroups including SEA‐1 and SEA‐2. Vietnam PDCoV in SEA‐2 was closely related to Thai and Lao PDCoV. Recombination analysis demonstrated that three isolates in SEA‐1 were a chimeric virus of which P12_14_VN_0814, the first Vietnam isolate, and US PDCoV isolates were major and minor parents, respectively. The recombination was further evaluated by phylogenetic construction based on 3 recombinant fragments. The first and third fragments, closely related to P12_14_VN_0814, were associated with ORF1a/1b and N genes, respectively. The second fragment, associated with S, E, and M genes, was closely related to US PDCoV isolates. High antigenic and hydrophobic variations were detected in S1 protein. Three‐day‐old pigs challenged with the chimeric virus displayed clinical diseases and villus atrophy. In conclusion, Vietnam PDCoV is genetically diverse influenced by an external introduction from neighbouring countries. The chimeric Vietnam PDCoV can induce a disease similar to Thai PDCoV.","Saeng‐chuto, Kepalee; Jermsutjarit, Patumporn; Stott, Christopher J.; Vui, Dam Thi; Tantituvanont, Angkana; Nilubol, Dachrit",Transbound Emerg Dis,462,3

Although often distinct and evolving relatively independently, health disparity, social vulnerability and environmental justice research and practice intertwine and inform one another. Together, they increasingly provide evidence of how social processes intensify disasters almost predictably giving rise to inequitable disruptions and consequences. The domino and cumulative effects of cascading disasters invariably reveal inequities through differential impacts and recovery opportunities across communities and subgroups of people. Not only do cascading disasters reveal and produce inequitable effects, the cascade itself can emerge out of compounded nested social structures. Drawing on, and integrating, theory and practice from social vulnerability, health inequity, and environmental justice, this paper presents a comprehensive conceptual model of cascading disasters that offers a people-centric lens. The CHASMS conceptual model (Cascading Hazards to disAsters that are Socially constructed eMerging out of Social Vulnerability) interrogates the tension between local communities and the larger structural forces that produce social inequities at multiple levels, capturing how those inequities lead to cascading disasters. We apply the model to COVID-19 as an illustration of how underlying inequities give rise to foreseeable inequitable outcomes, emphasizing the U.S. experience. We offer Kenya and Puerto Rico as examples of cumulative effects and possible cascades when responding to other events in the shadow of COVID-19. COVID-19 has vividly exposed the dynamic, complex, and intense relevance of placing social conditions and structures at the forefront of cascading disaster inquiry and practice. The intensity of social disruption and the continuation of the pandemic will, no doubt, perpetuate and magnify chasms of injustice.","Thomas, Deborah S.K.; Jang, Sojin; Scandlyn, Jean",Int J Disaster Risk Reduct,462,20

From November 2002 to July 2003 the cumulative number of worldwide cases was >8000, with a mortality rate of close to 10%. The mortality has been higher in older patients and those with co-morbidities. SARS has been defined using clinical and epidemiological criteria and cases are considered laboratory-confirmed if SARS coronavirus is isolated, if antibody to SARS coronavirus is detected, or a polymerase chain reaction test by appropriate criteria is positive. At the time of writing (24 May 2004), no specific therapy has been recommended. A variety of treatments have been attempted, but there are no controlled data. Most patients have been treated throughout the illness with broad-spectrum antimicrobials, supplemental oxygen, intravenous fluids, and other supportive measures. Transmission of SARS is facilitated by close contact with patients with symptomatic infection. The majority of cases have been reported among healthcare providers and family members of SARS patients. Since SARS-CoV is contagious, measures for prevention center on avoidance of exposure, and infection control strategies for suspected cases and contacts. This includes standard precautions (hand hygiene), contact precautions (gowns, goggles, gloves) and airborne precautions (negative pressure rooms and high efficiency masks). In light of reports of new cases identified during the winter of 2003–4 in China, it seems possible that SARS will be an important cause of pneumonia in the future, and the screening of outpatients at risk for SARS may become part of the pneumonia evaluation.","File, Thomas M.; Tsang, Kenneth W.

However, the possibility of neural damage has recently been proposed as a mechanism in chronic disease. Experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE) is the most widely used experimental model for MS. We investigated occurrences of microglial activation and astrocytosis in the spinal cord, choline acetyl‐transferase (ChAT) and calcitonin gene‐related peptide (CGRP) mRNA regulation in spinal motoneurones during EAE. EAE was induced in female Lewis rats by injecting guinea pig spinal cord tissue in complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) to which heat‐inactivated Mycobacterium had been added. Rats injected with CFA and uninjected rats were used as controls. ChAT and CGRP mRNAs were studied by in situ hybridization in the lumbar spinal cord and a computerized grain counting procedure was used for quantification. No differences in ChAT mRNA level were found between control and CFA‐injected rats. ChAT mRNA level was strongly reduced in EAE 14 days after immunization and then recovered (29 days after immunization). CGRP mRNA increased 14 days after immunization, and then recovered to control level. Extensive long‐lasting gliosis developed in the spinal cord and around motoneurones and a transient expression of p75(LNGFR) in motoneurones was also found. These data suggest that during EAE, gliosis induces distress in spinal cord neurones involving the synthesis enzyme for the main transmitter.","Giardino, L.; Giuliani, A.; Fernandez, M.; Calzà, L.",Neuropathol Appl Neurobiol,462,1

In response, schools have been searching for methods to negate these results through wellness programs focused on student life. METHODS: A survey comprised of three multiple choice questions was disseminated amongst first year basic science medical students to determine their current state of well-being and potential interest in an educational course focused on wellness. Questions inquired about students’ current coping strategies and their interest in engaging in wellness focused activities. Participants’ responses were then used to create a Well-being selective. The course design was centered around a small points reward system in order to promote autonomous decision making and encourage balance of body, mind, and spirit. RESULTS/DISCUSSION: Initial survey data suggests student interest in the creation of a wellness centered selective. Students engaged in a diverse array of activities to support the whole of their being. By tracking student choices of activities to engage in and feedback sent to the selective director, the selective design is being adapted to fit the needs of the student body. CONCLUSION: Through promotion of on and off-campus extracurricular activities, the Well-being selective offers a non-threatening and self-paced approach to a balanced mind, body, and spirit. In this selective, students participate in diverse activities that support health and life balance, ranging from sunset group yoga to local botany. Student feedback suggests that through the selective they have experienced increased community engagement and support during their basic sciences medical education.","Salana, Kristen; Maty, Shauna; Hage, Robert",Glob Adv Health Med,462,24

Tracking and analysing the heterogeneity and effectiveness of cities’ prevention and control of the COVID-19 epidemic is essential to design and adjust epidemic prevention and control measures. The number of newly confirmed cases in 25 of China’s most-affected cities for the COVID-19 epidemic from January 11 to February 10 was collected. The heterogeneity and effectiveness of these 25 cities’ prevention and control measures for COVID-19 were analysed by using an estimated time-varying reproduction number method and a serial correlation method. The results showed that the effective reproduction number (R) in 25 cities showed a downward trend overall, but there was a significant difference in the R change trends among cities, indicating that there was heterogeneity in the spread and control of COVID-19 in cities. Moreover, the COVID-19 control in 21 of 25 cities was effective, and the risk of infection decreased because their R had dropped below 1 by February 10, 2020. In contrast, the cities of Wuhan, Tianmen, Ezhou and Enshi still had difficulty effectively controlling the COVID-19 epidemic in a short period of time because their R was greater than 1.","Cheng, Qing; Liu, Zeyi; Cheng, Guangquan; Huang, Jincai",Sci Rep,462,1

Maximum titers of infectious virus (∼107 PFU/ml) were observed at 12 hr p.i., while incorporation of [3H]uridine into virus-specific RNA became detectable at 4 hr p.i. and increased to reach a maximum rate at 8 hr p.i. This RNA was labeled between 2.5 and 7 hr p.i. and isolated from infected cells. About 44% bound to oligo(dT)-cellulose; this material was denatured using glyoxal and dimethyl sulfoxide and analyzed by electrophoresis in a 1% agarose-urea gel. Six virus-specific RNA species were found having the following molecular weights: 4.3 × 106 (RNA1), 1.3 × 106 (RNA2), 0.9 × 106 (RNA3), 0.7 × 106 (RNA4), 0.3 × 106 (RNA5), and 0.2 × 106 (RNA6). RNA1 comigrated with the viral genome. Artifacts caused by defective interfering particles or breakdown of RNA were excluded. Subsequently, the target sizes of the templates for the synthesis of the genome-sized RNA and the five subgenomic RNAs were determined by uv transcription mapping. Infected cells were irradiated at 6.5 hr p.i. The effect o of reasing uv doses on the RNA synthesis was determined by quantitation of the individual RNAs after separation by agarose gel electrophoresis. The uv target sizes calculated for the templates for RNAs 2–5 were very close to the physical size of RNA1. The target size of the template of RNA6 was smaller (2.8 × 106 daltons), although much greater than its physical size. The data are consistent with a model in which the individual RNAs are derived from a larger precursor RNA molecule. The consequences of these findings for the taxonomy of Togaviridae are discussed.","Van Berlo, Mario F.; Horzinek, Marian C.; Van der Zeijst, Bernard A.M.",Virology,462,22

A questionnaire related to different aspects of online teaching was developed on a 5-point Likert scale from “strongly agree” to “strongly disagree”. Following a pilot study, the questionnaire was shared among surgery residents, and response collection was done. The residents who did not attend at least 90% of scheduled classes were excluded. A total of 55 resident doctors without prior experience of online teaching program were enrolled in the study. All the participants responded to all questions and submitted their responses within stipulated time. On the basis of validity testing, questions 1 and 2 were found invalid and hence deleted. The median value for the total cohort was 4 indicating that majority of residents gave affirmative response. On segregating the result with the year of residency program, similar results were found in the 1st year and 2nd year group; however, the 3rd year group showed a median of 3, thus eliciting that only 50% of 3rd year residents liked online teaching. From the present study, it can be concluded that the online teaching is a feasible alternative to the physical class among surgical postgraduates.

Supply chain constraints—spanning limitations in testing kits, reagents, pipet tips, and swabs availability—have challenged the ability to scale COVID-19 testing. During the early months, sample collection kits shortages constrained planned testing expansions. In response, the University of Vermont Medical Center, University of Vermont College of Medicine, Vermont Department of Health Laboratory, Aspenti Health, and providers across Vermont including 16 area hospitals partnered to surmount these barriers. The primary objectives were to increase supply availability and manage utilization. Within the first month of Vermont’s stay-at-home order, the University of Vermont Medical Center laboratory partnered with College of Medicine to create in-house collection kits, producing 5000 per week. University of Vermont Medical Center reassigned 4 phlebotomists, laboratory educators, and other laboratory staff, who had reduced workloads, to participate (requiring a total of 5.3-7.6 full-time equivalent (FTE) during the period of study). By August, automation at a local commercial laboratory produced 22,000 vials of media in one week (reducing the required personnel by 1.2 FTE). A multisite, cross-institutional approach was used to manage specimen collection kit utilization across Vermont. Hospital laboratory directors, managers, and providers agreed to order only as needed to avoid supply stockpiles and supported operational constraints through ongoing validations and kit assembly. Throughout this pandemic, Vermont has ranked highly in number of tests per million people, demonstrating the value of local collaboration to surmount obstacles during disease outbreaks and the importance of creative allocation of resources to address statewide needs.","Warrington, Jill S.; Crothers, Jessica W.; Goodwin, Andrew; Coulombe, Linda; Hong, Tania; Bryan, Lynn; Wojewoda, Christina; Fung, Mark; Warrington, Gregory; Clark, Vanessa; Risley, Lauren; Lewis, Michael",Acad Pathol,462,21

RAPTOR-C19 will provide the community testbed to the COVID-19 National DiagnOstic Research and Evaluation Platform (CONDOR). METHODS: RAPTOR-C19 incorporates a series of prospective observational parallel diagnostic accuracy studies of SARS-CoV2 POCTs against laboratory and composite reference standards in patients with suspected current or past SARS-CoV2 infection attending community settings. Adults and children with suspected current SARS-CoV2 infection who are having an oropharyngeal/nasopharyngeal (OP/NP) swab for laboratory SARS-CoV2 reverse transcriptase Digital/Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (d/rRT-PCR) as part of clinical care or community-based testing will be invited to participate. Adults (≥ 16 years) with suspected past symptomatic infection will also be recruited. Asymptomatic individuals will not be eligible. At the baseline visit, all participants will be asked to submit samples for at least one candidate point-of-care test (POCT) being evaluated (index test/s) as well as an OP/NP swab for laboratory SARS-CoV2 RT-PCR performed by Public Health England (PHE) (reference standard for current infection). Adults will also be asked for a blood sample for laboratory SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing by PHE (reference standard for past infection), where feasible adults will be invited to attend a second visit at 28 days for repeat antibody testing. Additional study data (e.g. demographics, symptoms, observations, household contacts) will be captured electronically. Sensitivity, specificity, positive, and negative predictive values for each POCT will be calculated with exact 95% confidence intervals when compared to the reference standard. POCTs will also be compared to composite reference standards constructed using paired antibody test results, patient reported outcomes, linked electronic health records for outcomes related to COVID-19 such as hospitalisation or death, and other test results. DISCUSSION: High-performing POCTs for community use could be transformational. Real-time results could lead to personal and public health impacts such as reducing onward household transmission of SARS-CoV2 infection, improving surveillance of health and social care staff, contributing to accurate prevalence estimates, and understanding of SARS-CoV2 transmission dynamics in the population. In contrast, poorly performing POCTs could have negative effects, so it is necessary to undertake community-based diagnostic accuracy evaluations before rolling these out.

The overarching goal was to gain insight on how to build an effective psychological support system for teachers during and after the pandemic. Methods: The mental health condition of teachers (N = 18,521) was assessed online by using a questionnaire consisting of standard instruments PHQ-15, GAD-7, PHQ-2, PC-PTSD, and additional questions about sleep disturbance, suicidality and preference of psychological intervention methods. Results: 35.5% of Chinese teachers reported sleep disturbance, 25.3% complained somatic discomfort, 17.7% had anxiety symptoms, 4.0% had depression, 2.8% had self-injury or suicidal thoughts. Women are more likely to have somatic symptoms, sleep disturbance and depression. There were age differences for anxiety, somatic symptoms and suicidal thoughts. High percentages of university teachers reported moderate to severe anxiety, somatic symptoms, depression and sleep disturbance. The most preferred psychological intervention is the self-practice of stress management skills (N = 11,477, 62.0%). Teachers with moderate and severe symptoms are more likely in need of hotline and online counseling and those with serious suicidal thoughts are three times more likely to use a telephone hotline. Conclusions: During the COVID-19 outbreak, the major reported psychological distresses among Chinese teachers are anxiety, sleep disturbance and somatic symptoms. There were gender, age and school setting differences. Females, teachers over 45 years old and those who work at universities tend to be more vulnerable. Different teachers chose different interventions, mostly based on the severity of their symptoms.","Lizhi, Xu; Peng, Cheng; Wanhong, Zheng; Shengmei, Xu; Lingjiang, Li; Li, Zhang; Xiaoping, Wang; Weihui, Li",Front Psychiatry,462,16

We aimed to identify the psychological impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on haematology patients and identify correlated factors to inform the development of appropriate supportive interventions. METHODS: Three hundred and ninety-four respondents volunteered their participation in response to a study advertisement distributed online through established haematology groups. Participants completed a self-report online survey exploring wellbeing, psychological distress, unmet supportive care needs, and fear of cancer recurrence. RESULTS: At least 1 in 3 respondents (35%) reported clinical levels of distress and nearly 1 in 3 (32%) identified at least one unmet need. Among respondents in remission (n = 134), clinical fear of cancer recurrence was reported by nearly all (95%). Unmet needs, pre-existing health conditions, younger age, financial concerns, and perceived risk of contracting COVID-19 were the dominant factors contributing to psychological distress during the pandemic. Psychological distress, lost income, perceived inadequate support from care team, perceived risk of contracting COVID-19, and being a woman were significantly associated with unmet needs. Psychological distress and concern about the impact of COVID-19 on cancer management were significantly associated with fear of cancer recurrence among respondents in remission. CONCLUSION: Results highlight the high psychological burden and unmet needs experienced by people with haematological cancers during the COVID-19 pandemic and indicate a need for innovative solutions to rapidly identify distress and unmet needs during, and beyond, pandemic times.

The VBAC trend is accompanied with numerous challenges for healthcare professionals, from establishing suitability of each pregnant patient profile for TOLAC to active labor management, and ethical or legal issues, which occasionally are not included in specific guidelines. That is why an individualized risk assessment and management can serve obstetricians as a useful tool for improving outcomes of patients, satisfaction, and also for avoiding legal or moral liabilities. The risk management concept aims to reduce foreseen risks and to emulate strategies for prediction and prevention of unwanted events. In obstetrics, and particularly for the VBAC topic, this concept is relatively new and undefined, and thus its features are disparate between guideline recommendations and clinical studies. This narrative review intends to offer a new and organic perspective over clinical aspects of TOLAC and VBAC risk management.","Carauleanu, Alexandru; Tanasa, Ingrid Andrada; Nemescu, Dragos; Socolov, Demetra",Exp Ther Med,462,11

Shading of the plants during the growth period enhances the processes of synthesis and accumulation of biologically active compounds, including theanine, caffeine, chlorophyll and various types of catechins. Green tea contains four main catechins, i.e., (−)-epicatechin (EC), (−)-epicatechin-3-gallate (ECG), (−)-epigallocatechin (EGC) and (−)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), of which the latter is the most active and abundant and matcha is their best condensed source. Due to its unique chemical composition and prized flavour, which sets it apart from other tea beverages, it is considered the highest quality tea. Its health-promoting properties are attributed to the high content of antioxidant and anti-inflammatory substances. Studies confirming the high antioxidant potential of tea beverages claim that it originates from the considerable content of catechins, a type of phenolic compound with beneficial effects on human health. Due to its potential for preventing many diseases and supporting cognitive function, regular consumption of matcha may have a positive effect on both physical and mental health. The aim of this review was to compile the health benefits of matcha tea. It is the first such review to be undertaken, and presents its main bioactive compounds in a systematic manner.","Kochman, Joanna; Jakubczyk, Karolina; Antoniewicz, Justyna; Mruk, Honorata; Janda, Katarzyna",Molecules,462,27

Traumatic stress during adolescence increases the risk of IBS in adults. The aim of this study was to characterize the juvenile social defeat stress (SDS)-associated IBS model in mice. Juvenile mice were exposed to an aggressor mouse for 10 min once daily for 10 consecutive days. Behavioral tests, visceral sensitivity, immune responses, and fecal bacteria in the colon were evaluated in 5 weeks after SDS exposure. Social avoidance, anxiety- and depression-like behavior, and visceral hypersensitivity were observed. Juvenile SDS exposure significantly increased the number of 5-HT-containing cells and calcitonin gene-related peptide-positive neurons in the colon. The gut microbiota was largely similar between the control and juvenile SDS groups. The alterations in fecal pellet output, bead expulsion time, plasma corticosterone concentration, and colonic 5-HT content in response to restraint stress were exacerbated in the juvenile SDS group compared with the control group. The combination of juvenile SDS and restraint stress increased the noradrenaline metabolite 3-Methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol (MHPG) content and MHPG/noradrenaline ratio in the amygdala when compared with restraint stress in control mice. These results suggest that juvenile SDS exposure results in later onset of IBS-like symptoms.","Matsumoto, Kenjiro; Takata, Kana; Yamada, Daisuke; Usuda, Haruki; Wada, Koichiro; Tada, Maaya; Mishima, Yoshiyuki; Ishihara, Shunji; Horie, Syunji; Saitoh, Akiyoshi; Kato, Shinichi",Sci Rep,462,24

These mainly involve the development of antimicrobial, antiviral, and/or anti-inflammatory agents as well as vaccine production. However, other potential options should be more avidly investigated since vaccine production on a worldwide level, and the anti-vaccination movement, also known as anti-vax or vaccine hesitancy by many communities, are still real obstacles without a ready solution. This review presents recent findings on the potential therapeutic advantages of heterologous serotherapy for the treatment of COVID-19. We present not only the effective use in animal models of hyperimmune sera against this coronavirus but also strategies, and protocols for the production of anti-SARS-CoV-2 sera. Promising antigens are also indicated such as the receptor-binding domain (RBD) in SARS-CoV-2 S protein, which is already in phase 2/3 clinical trial, and the trimeric protein S, which was shown to be up to 150 times more potent than the serum from convalescent donors. Due to the high death rate, the treatment for those currently infected with coronavirus cannot be ignored. Therefore, the potential use of anti-SARS-CoV-2 hyperimmune sera should be carefully but urgently evaluated in phase 2/3 clinical studies.","B P da Costa, Camila; Martins, Francislene J; E R da Cunha, Luis; Ratcliffe, Norman A.; Cisne de Paula, Rafael; Castro, Helena C",Int Immunopharmacol,462,21

It displays 10-fold higher superoxide quenching activity compared to SOD as well as significant antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory activities through beneficial modulation of several significant inflammatory cytokines in vitro and in vivo. We tested the therapeutic potential of RM191A in a topical gel using a human skin explant model and observed that it significantly inhibits UV-induced DNA damage in the epidermis and dermis, including cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPD), 8-oxo-guanine (8-oxoG) and 8-nitroguanine (8NGO). RM191A topical gel is found to be non-toxic, non-teratogenic and readily distributed in the body of mice.

First positive was reported on late January 2020. Mid March, with 7000 confirmed cases, nationwide lockdown was imposed. Mid May the epidemic was stabilized and government eased measures. Here we model the dynamics of the epidemic in Spain over the whole span, and study the effectiveness of control measures. The model is also applied to Italy and Germany. We propose formulas to easily estimate the size of the outbreak and the benefit of early intervention. A susceptible-infectious-recovered (SIR) model was used to simulate the epidemic. The growth and transmission rates, doubling time, and reproductive number were estimated by least-mean-square fitting of daily cases. Time-series data were obtained from official government reports. We forecasted the epidemic curve after lockdown under different effectiveness scenarios, and nowcasted the trend by moving average sliding window. Exponential growth expressions were derived. Outbreak progression remained under the early growth dynamics. The basic reproductive number in Spain was 2.5 ± 0.1 (95% CI 2.3–2.7), and the doubling time was 2.8 ± 0.1 days (95% CI 2.6–3.0). Slight variations in measures effectiveness produce a large divergence in the epidemic size. The effectiveness in Spain was 68%, above control threshold (60%). During lockdown the reproductive number dropped to an average of 0.81 ± 0.02 (95% CI 0.77–0.85). Estimated epidemic size is about 300,000 cases. A 7-days advance of measures yields a reduction to 38%. The dynamics in Spain is similar to other countries. Strong lockdown measures must be adopted if not compensated by rapid detection and isolation of patients, and even a slight relaxation would raise the reproductive number above 1. Simple calculations allow anticipating the size of the epidemic based on when measures are taken and their effectiveness. Spain acted late. Control measures must be implemented immediately in the face on an epidemic.","Guirao, Antonio",Infect Dis Model,462,1

The objective of this study was to achieve an expert consensus defining failure criteria for anti-interleukin 5/R treatment in severe asthma patients. METHODS: Experts were invited to a 5-round Delphi exercise if they were pulmonologists managing ⩾30 patients at a nationally recognized severe asthma expert centre. Following two rounds of statement-generating brainstorming, the expert panel ranked each statement according to a 5-point Likert-type scale during three additional rounds. Positive consensus was considered achieved when ⩾80% of experts agreed with a statement with >50% strong agreement and <15% disagreement. RESULTS: Twenty experts participated in the study. All experts agreed that predefined treatment goals defining effectiveness should be personalized during shared decision making via a patient contract. Treatment failure was defined as (1) absence of a reduction in exacerbation rates by ⩾25% or (2) absence of a reduction in oral corticosteroid therapy by ⩾25% of the initial dosage or (3) occurrence of emergency room visits or hospitalizations after 6 months of treatment. Treatment failure should result in discontinuation. For partial responders, treatment discontinuation was not recommended unless an alternative from another therapeutic class exists and should be discussed in a multidisciplinary consultation.

The diagnosis of COVID-19 depends on real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). On imaging, computed tomography (CT) manifestations resemble those seen in viral pneumonias, with multifocal ground-glass opacities and consolidation in a peripheral distribution being the most common findings. Although these findings lack specificity for COVID-19 diagnosis on imaging grounds, CT could be used to provide objective assessment about the extension of the lung opacities, which could be used as an imaging surrogate for disease burden. We set out to investigate the diagnostic accuracy of chest CT scanning in detecting COVID-19 in a population with suspected COVID-19 patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this cross-sectional single-center study performed on 348 cases with clinical suspicion of COVID-19, all adult symptomatic ED patients had both a CT scan and a PCR upon arrival at. CT results were compared with PCR test (s) and diagnostic accuracy was calculated. RESULTS: Between February 15, 2020, and June 30, 2020, 348 symptomatic patients were included.

The sensitivity of the CT tended to be higher in those with acute respiratory distress syndrome (100.0%, P = 0.017) and severe COVID-19 (98.5%, P = 0.027) than in patients with mild (82.5%, P = 0.047) and moderate COVID-19 (89.3%, P = 0.039). The diagnostic ability of chest CT was found to be high with 86.3% concordance between findings of CT and PCR. In 48 (13.7%) patients, discordant findings between CT and PCR were observed. In most cases, the CT scan was considered suspicious for COVID-19, while the PCR was negative (37/48, 77.0%). In the majority of these, the diagnosis at discharge was pulmonary infection (n = 26; 54.1%). CONCLUSION: The accuracy of chest CT in symptomatic COVID suspect patients is high, but when used as a single diagnostic test, CT cannot accurately diagnose or exclude COVID-19. Therefore, we recommend a combination of both CT and RT-PCR for future follow-up, management, and medical surveillance.","Ravikanth, Reddy",Lung India,462,16

Population-based studies in the developed world suggest that the burden of critical illness is higher than generally appreciated and will increase as the population ages. Critical care capacity has long been needed in the developing world, and efforts to improve the care of the critically ill in these settings are starting to occur. Expansion of critical care to handle the consequences of an ageing population, natural disasters, conflict, inadequate primary care, and higher-risk medical therapies will be challenged by high costs at a time of economic constraint. To meet this challenge, investigators in this discipline will need to measure the global burden of critical illness and available critical-care resources, and develop both preventive and therapeutic interventions that are generalisable across countries.","Adhikari, Neill KJ; Fowler, Robert A; Bhagwanjee, Satish; Rubenfeld, Gordon D",Lancet,462,1

In this work, acetylated lignin was used to encapsulate five different porphyrins, aiming to preserve their photophysical properties, and for further use as antibacterial treatment. The obtained nanoparticles were physically characterized, through dynamic light scattering size measurement, polydispersity index and zeta potential values. Additionally, the photophysical properties of the nanoparticles, namely UV-vis absorption, fluorescence emission, singlet oxygen production and photobleaching, were compared with those of the free porphyrins. It was found that all the porphyrins were susceptible to encapsulation, with an observed decrease in their fluorescence quantum yield and singlet oxygen production. These nanoparticles were able to exert an effective photodynamic bactericide effect (blue-LED light, 450–460 nm, 15 J/cm(2)) on Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. Furthermore, it was achieved a photodynamic bactericidal activity on an encapsulated lipophillic porphyrin, where the free porphyrin failed to diminish the bacterial survival. In this work it was demonstrated that acetylated lignin encapsulation works as a universal, cheap and green material for the delivery of porphyrins, while preserving their photophysical properties.","Maldonado-Carmona, Nidia; Ouk, Tan-Sothea; Villandier, Nicolas; Calliste, Claude Alain; Calvete, Mário J.

Limited information is available on comparative evaluation of IgG immunoassays against a clinical reference standard, i.e., RT-PCR positivity with >20 days of illness. This study addresses the need for comparing clinical performance of IgG immunoassays with respect to this alternate reference standard. METHODS: We compared the performance of three immunoassays, an in-house RBD assay, and two commercial assays, the Diasorin LIAISON SARS-CoV-2 S1/S1 IgG CLIA which detects antibodies against S1/S2 domains of the Spike protein and the Zydus Kavach assay based on inactivated virus using a well-characterized panel of sera. 379 sera and plasma samples from RTPCR positive individuals >20 days of illness in symptomatic or RT-PCR positivity in asymptomatic individuals and 184 samples collected prior to 2019 were used for assay evaluation. RESULTS: The sensitivity of the assays were 84.7 (95%CI 80.6 - 88.1), 82.6 (95%CI 78.3 - 86.2) and 75.7 (95%CI 71.0 - 79.9) respectively for RBD, LIAISON and Kavach. Kavach and the in-house RBD ELISA showed a specificity of 99.5% and 100%, respectively. The RBD and LIAISON (S1/S2) assays showed high agreement (94.7%; 95%CI: 92.0, 96.6) and were able to correctly identify more positive sera/plasma than Kavach. CONCLUSION: Independent comparisons support the evaluation of performance characteristics of immunoassays. All three assays are suitable for serosurveillance studies, but in low prevalence sites, estimation of exposure may require adjustment based on our findings.","Chaudhuri, Susmita; Thiruvengadam, Ramachandran; Chattopadhyay, Souvick; Mehdi, Farha; Kshetrapal, Pallavi; Shrivastava, Tripti; Desiraju, Bapu Koundinya; Batra, Gaurav; Kang, Gagandeep; Bhatnagar, Shinjini",J Clin Virol,462,16

These raise ethical issues around privacy, personal freedoms and equity. However, little is known regarding public acceptability of these measures. Methods In December 2020, we conducted surveys among 3635 respondents in Singapore, Hong Kong and Malaysia to understand public perceptions on the ethical acceptability of COVID-19 control measures. Findings Hong Kong respondents were much less supportive of digital contact tracing and monitoring devices than those in Malaysia and Singapore. Around three-quarters of Hong Kong respondents perceived digital contact tracing as an unreasonable restriction of individual freedom; <20% trusted that there were adequate local provisions preventing these data being used for other purposes. This was the opposite in Singapore, where nearly three-quarters of respondents agreed that there were adequate data protection rules locally. In contrast, only a minority of Hong Kong respondents viewed mandatory testing and vaccination for travelers as unreasonable infringements of privacy or freedom. Less than two-thirds of respondents in all territories were willing to be vaccinated against COVID-19, with a quarter of respondents undecided. However, support for differential travel restrictions for vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals was high in all settings.

We analysed published data of five influenza pandemics (such as the Spanish Flu and the Swine Flu) and the SARS-CoV-1 pandemic to describe whether there were subsequent waves and how they differed. Methods We reanalysed literature and WHO reports on SARS-CoV-1 and literature on five influenza pandemics. We report frequencies of second and third waves, wave heights, wavelengths and time between subsequent waves. From this, we estimated peak-to-peak ratios to compare the wave heights, and wave-length-to-wave-length ratios to compare the wavelengths differences in days. Furthermore, we analysed the seasonality of the wave peaks and the time between the peak values of two waves. Results Second waves, the Spanish Flu excluded, were usually about the same height and length as first waves and were observed in 93% of the 57 described epidemic events of influenza pandemics and in 42% of the 19 epidemic events of the SARS-CoV-1 pandemic. Third waves occurred in 54% of the 28 influenza and in 11% of the 19 SARS-CoV-1 epidemic events. Third waves, the Spanish Flu excluded, usually peaked higher than second waves with a peak-to-peak ratio of 0.5.

Dans ce contexte, il était intéressant de mesurer en France Métropolitaine la circulation des maladies infectieuses, vues en médecine générale, au cours de la première année de propagation de la COVID-19. Matériel et méthodes Les incidences hebdomadaires de la diarrhée aiguë, de la varicelle, de la bronchiolite et des infections respiratoires aiguës (IRA) ont été estimées de janvier 2016 à décembre 2020 via les remontées de cas vus en consultation ou téléconsultation par deux réseaux de médecine générale : le réseau Sentinelles (INSERM–Sorbonne Université–participation active de+-500 médecins généralistes (MG) à la surveillance d’indicateurs de Santé Publique) et les EMR (Electronic Medical Records–participation passive : recueil longitudinal via le logiciel d’aide à la prescription d’un échantillon représentatif de 1200 MG) de la société IQVIA. Les délivrances en pharmacie des traitements médicamenteux de ces pathologies ont aussi été exploitées sur la même période à partir du panel IQVIA PharmaOne (taux de couverture : 66 %). Une régression périodique, modélisée sur les données de 2016 à 2019, a permis d’estimer les incidences et les délivrances médicamenteuses attendues pour l’année 2020. Ces estimations ont ensuite été comparées aux valeurs observées au cours de l’année 2020 en regard des différentes mesures sanitaires mises en place. Résultats Durant le 1er confinement (semaines 12 à 20), comparativement aux mêmes semaines des années passées, une baisse de l’incidence était observée, de 49 % pour les IRA, 67 % pour la diarrhée aiguë, 79 % pour la bronchiolite et 90 % pour la varicelle. L’incidence chez les enfants est celle enregistrant la plus forte diminution. Plus finement, la chute des taux d’incidence pour 100 000 habitants était de : – Diarrhée aiguë : 94 cas en semaine 11, à 25 cas en semaine 15, stabilisation autour de 50 cas ensuite ; – Varicelle : 10 cas en semaine 10, à 0 cas en semaine 17, niveau conservé pendant l’été, alors que le pic est généralement observé en mai et juin ; retour à un niveau comparable aux années précédentes à la rentrée scolaire de septembre ; – Bronchiolite : décrochage (<5 cas) dès la semaine 13 plus précoce et brutal qu’habituellement, stagnation ensuite, légère remontée en septembre puis rechute lors du 2nd confinement (±5 cas versus 15 à 25 observés d’habitude) ; – IRA : après la diminution durant le 1er confinement, lent retour aux niveaux habituels à la fin des vacances scolaires d’été, puis nouvelle chute de 55 % durant le 2ème confinement. Les consultations en soins primaires ont brièvement chuté de 28 % au début du 1er confinement, pour rapidement retrouver un niveau supérieur à 95 % de celui attendu. Conclusion Simultanément à la mise en œuvre des mesures de distanciation sociale, l’incidence des cas rapportés en soins primaires de diarrhées aiguës, varicelles, bronchiolites ou IRA a fortement diminué en France Métropolitaine. Cette baisse ne peut s’expliquer par la réduction du nombre de consultations en soins primaires et confirme que la circulation des virus responsables de ces infections a bien été réduite par les mesures barrières instaurées pour le contrôle de l’épidémie de la COVID-19.","Bardoulat, Isabelle; Launay, Titouan; Souty, Cécile; Vilcu, Ana-Maria; Turbelin, Clément; Guerrisi, Caroline; Hanslik, Thomas; Colizza, Vittoria; Boëlle, Pierre-Yves; Lemaître, Magali; Blanchon, Thierry",Revue d'Épidémiologie et de Santé Publique,462,5

While COVID-19 classically manifests as a respiratory illness, SARS-CoV-2 may infect multiple organ systems and cause a wide array of presentations. The gastrointestinal tract has become increasingly recognized as a site of SARS-CoV-2 infection with reports of diarrhea, nausea, and liver failure, with or without concomitant respiratory involvement. In this case series and literature review, we report three cases of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients that presented with predominantly gastrointestinal symptoms or laboratory abnormalities such as diarrhea, anorexia, and transaminitis. The receptor for SARS-CoV-2, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), as well as the necessary protease to facilitate viral entry, transmembrane protease serine-2 (TMPRSS2), and to a lesser extent, cathepsins, have been demonstrated to be present throughout the gastrointestinal tract, thus facilitating viral entry and pathogenesis. Furthermore, multiple reports have demonstrated evidence of viral shedding outside the nasopharynx, including the stool, for prolonged time periods even in the absence of detection of viral RNA in the nasopharynx. As such, testing for SARS-CoV-2 in stool samples with reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays for detection of viral RNA could aid in identifying patients that lack classic respiratory symptoms, present with atypical symptoms, or in those with a high index of suspicion (e.g. elevated inflammatory markers), but test negative on the classic nasopharyngeal swab. Furthermore, this underscores the potential for atypical transmission, with a focus on fecal-oral transmission and the need for strict hand hygiene.","Yousaf, Muhammad N; Naqvi, Haider A; Chaudhary, Fizah; Raddawi, Kenan; Haas, Christopher J",Cureus,462,25

The pH and ionic strength affect the binding affinity of the virus to cells. In this study, we initially investigated the effects of pH (4.0–10.0) and metal ions (Fe(2+), Co(2+), Cu(2+), Mg(2+), K(+), and Ca(2+)) on the binding of HAV to oyster digestive cells. The lowest relative binding (RB) of HAV to the cells was found at pH 4.0 and in FeSO(4) solution (64.6% and 68.1%, respectively). To develop an alternative to antibody-dependent immunomagnetic separation prior to detection of HAV using RT-PCR, the binding of HAV to five lectins, peanut agglutinin (PNA), Dolichos biflorus agglutinin (DBA), Helix pomatia agglutinin (HPA), Ulex europaeus agglutinin (UEA-1) and soybean agglutinin (SBA), was evaluated using ELISAs. SBA showed significantly higher RB to HAV than the other lectins tested. In addition, HAV could be concentrated within 30 min using SBA-linked magnetic bead separation (SMS) prior to the RT-PCR assay. Our findings demonstrate the feasibility of using SMS combined with RT-PCR to detect HAV at dilutions ranging from 10(−1)–10(−4) of a HAV stock (titer: 10(4) TCID(50)/mL).","Ko, Sang-Mu; Kwon, Joseph; Vaidya, Bipin; Choi, Jong Soon; Lee, Hee-Min; Oh, Myung-Joo; Bae, Hyeun-Jong; Cho, Se-Young; Oh, Kyung-Seo; Kim, Duwoon",Viruses,462,32

We aimed to study the association between levels of circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) and adverse clinical outcomes linked to SARS-CoV-2 infection. We further aimed to observe the incidence of low, below-average, and normal levels of 25(OH)D in patients hospitalized for COVID-19 between March 12, 2020, and May 20, 2020, and assess whether these values differed between these patients and a normal population. Finally, we determined whether the need for transfer to the intensive care unit (ICU) and the mortality rate were related to low levels of 25(OH)D. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective observational study SETTING: Quironsalud Hospitals in Madrid, Spain PARTICIPANTS: We analyzed 1549 patients (mean age, 70 years; range, 21-104 years); 835 were male (53.9%; mean age, 73.02 years), and 714 were female (46.1%; mean age, 68.05 years). Subsequently, infected patients admitted to the ICU (n = 112) and those with a fatal outcome (n = 324) were analyzed. PROCEDURES: Serum concentrations of 25(OH)D were measured by electrochemiluminescence. RESULTS: More hospitalized patients (66%, n = 1017) had low baseline levels of 25(OH)D (<20 ng/ml) than normal individuals (45%) (p < 0.001). An analysis by age group revealed that COVID-19 patients between the ages of 20 and 80 years old had significantly lower vitamin D levels than those of the normal population (p < 0.001). Patients admitted to the ICU tended to have lower levels of 25(OH)D than other inpatients (p < 0.001); if we stratified patients by 25(OH)D levels, we observed that the rate of ICU admission was higher among patients with vitamin D deficiency (p < 0.001), indicating that higher vitamin D levels are associated with a lower risk of ICU admission due to COVID-19. ICU admission was related to sex (higher rates in men, p < 0.001) and age (p < 0.001). When using a logistic regression model, we found that vitamin D levels continued to show a statistically significant relationship with ICU admission rates, even when adjusting for sex and age. Therefore, the relationship found between vitamin D levels and the risk of ICU admission was independent of patient age and sex in both groups. Deceased patients (n = 324 tended to have lower levels of 25 (OH)D that normal population of the same age ( p < 0.001) CONCLUSION: Vitamin D deficiency in patients with COVID-19 is correlated with an increased risk of hospital admission and the need for critical care. We found no clear relationship between vitamin D levels and mortality.","Diaz-Curiel, Manuel; Cabello, Alfonso; Arboiro-Pinel, Rosa; Mansur, Luis; Heili-Frades, Sarah; Mahillo-Fernandez, Ignacio; Herrero-González, Antonio; Andrade-Poveda, Marjorie",J Steroid Biochem Mol Biol,462,20

In some outbreaks, the intervention has evoked controversy and community resistance. This study evaluated how local opinion leaders in US localities affected by Zika think about community engagement in public health policies for outbreak response. In December 2017 through March 2018, 4 focus groups were convened in Houston, TX, New Orleans, LA, Miami, FL, and Brooklyn, NY. They discussed a hypothetical scenario that featured vector control by aerial spraying. Participants (N = 20) more readily accepted this vector control method under 4 conditions: They were informed of alternatives, benefits, and risks for human health and the environment. Public health claims were backed by objective evidence and an authority figure genuinely working in the community’s interests. They received timely notice about how to mitigate toxin exposure. And, aerial spraying helped to protect vulnerable individuals. The community engagement requirements of the local opinion leaders resonate with core principles of recent public health ethics frameworks: namely, personal autonomy, transparency, reasonableness, and solidarity. Participants foresaw problems with community consent in an era of growing social media use and mistrust in governmental and scientific authority. They also debated whether health authorities should use moral-based arguments, in addition to science-based ones, to communicate aerial spraying’s risks and benefits.","Schoch-Spana, Monica; Watson, Crystal; Ravi, Sanjana; Meyer, Diane; Pechta, Laura E.; Rose, Dale A.; Lubell, Keri M.; Podgornik, Michelle N.; Sell, Tara Kirk",Prev Med Rep,462,24

It suggests that treating social characteristics separately—mainly age, gender, ethnicity, and socio-economic position—does not match the reality that people simultaneously embody multiple characteristics and are therefore potentially subject to multiple forms of discrimination. Yet the intersectionality literature has paid very little attention to the nature of ageing or the life course, and gerontology has rarely incorporated insights from intersectionality. In this paper, we aim to illustrate how intersectionality might be synthesised with a life course perspective to deliver novel insights into unequal ageing, especially with respect to health. First we provide an overview of how intersectionality can be used in research on inequality, focusing on intersectional subgroups, discrimination, categorisation, and individual heterogeneity. We cover two key approaches—the use of interaction terms in conventional models and multilevel models which are particularly focussed on granular subgroup differences. In advancing a conceptual dialogue with the life course perspective, we discuss the concepts of roles, life stages, transitions, age/cohort, cumulative disadvantage/advantage, and trajectories. We conclude that the synergies between intersectionality and the life course hold exciting opportunities to bring new insights to unequal ageing and its attendant health inequalities.","Holman, Daniel; Walker, Alan",Eur J Ageing,462,20

The aim of the present manuscript is to review the main relevant mechanisms possibly contributing to worsen the clinical course of COVID-19 in T2D. RESULTS: Poor glucose control, high glycaemic variability and diabetes-related comorbidities at baseline, particularly cardiovascular diseases and obesity, contribute in worsening the prognosis in the above-mentioned cluster of patients. Moreover, both a lower efficient innate immune system response and cytokine dysregulation predispose patients with T2D to impaired viral clearance and more serious pulmonary and systemic inflammation once the SARS-CoV-2 infection occurred. Inconclusive data are currently available for specifically indicate or contraindicate concurrent medications for managing T2D and its comorbidities in infected patients. CONCLUSIONS: T2D individuals should be considered as more vulnerable to COVID-19 than general population, and thus require adequate advices about hygienic tips to protect themselves during the pandemic. A careful management of glucose levels and diabetes-related comorbidities remains essential for avoiding further complications, and patient monitoring during the pandemic should be performed also at distance by means of telemedicine. Further studies are needed to clarify whether medications normally used for managing T2D and its associated comorbidities could have a protective or detrimental effect on COVID-19 clinical course.","Lisco, Giuseppe; De Tullio, Anna; Giagulli, Vito Angelo; Guastamacchia, Edoardo; De Pergola, Giovanni; Triggiani, Vincenzo",Endocrine,462,1

METHODS AND RESULTS: Routine comprehensive echocardiography and STE of both ventricles were performed during hospitalization for acute coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection as part of a prospective pre-designed protocol and compared with echocardiography performed ∼3 months after recovery in 80 patients, using a similar protocol. Significantly improved right ventricle (RV) fractional area change, longer pulmonary acceleration time, lower right atrial pressure, and smaller RV end-diastolic and end-systolic area were observed at the recovery assessment (P < 0.05 for all). RV global longitudinal strain improved at the follow-up evaluation (23.2 ± 5 vs. 21.7 ± 4, P = 0.03), mostly due to improvement in septal segments. Only eight (10%) patients recovering from COVID-19 infection had abnormal ejection fraction (EF) at follow-up. However, LV related routine (E, E/e′, stroke volume, LV size), or STE parameters did not change significantly from the assessment during hospitalization. A significant proportion [36 (45%)] of patients had some deterioration of longitudinal strain at follow-up, and 20 patients (25%) still had abnormal LV STE ∼3 months after COVID-19 acute infection. CONCLUSION: In patients previously discharged from hospitalization due to COVID-19 infection, RV routine echocardiographic and RV STE parameters improve significantly concurrently with improved RV haemodynamics. In contrast, a quarter of patients still have LV systolic dysfunction based on STE cut-offs. Moreover, LV STE does not improve significantly, implying subclinical LV dysfunction may be part and parcel of recovering from COVID-19 infection.","Baruch, Guy; Rothschild, Ehud; Sadon, Sapir; Szekely, Yishay; Lichter, Yael; Kaplan, Alon; Taieb, Philippe; Banai, Ariel; Hochstadt, Aviram; Merdler, Ilan; Arbel, Yaron; Laufer-Perl, Michal; Beer, Gil; Kapusta, Livia; Topilsky, Yan",Eur Heart J Cardiovasc Imaging,462,16

Sequence analysis of this region revealed the presence of two ORFs encoding proteins of 12.9 and 9.5 kDa. These two proteins were identified as putatively nonstructural (ns) due to their homology to the corresponding BCV ns gene products. Northern blot analysis indicated that each of these two genes was present on a separate mRNA (5 and 5-1, respectively). In vitro translation analyses demonstrated that the HCV-OC43 9.5-kDa protein, like its BCV counterpart, is poorly translated when situated downstream of the 12.9-kDa ORF, although immunofluorescence studies did confirm its presence in infected cells. Sequence analysis showed that a large portion of the 3′-end of the leader sequence is present within the viral genome, upstream of the 12.9-kDa ORF. In addition, two ORFs encoding potential 4.9- and 4.8-kDa ns proteins in BCV are absent in HCV-OC43, although a corresponding mRNA 4 was found at a very low level. These results demonstrate that these two putative ns proteins are not essential for virus replication, at least in HRT-18 cells.","Mounir, Samir; Talbot, Pierre J.",Virology,462,1

Data provided in this study supports the utility of a newly-designed lateral flow immunoassay (LFA) for detecting SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG antibodies. We employed a clinical cohort of 1,892 SARS-CoV-2 patients and controls, including individuals diagnosed by RT-qPCR at Yale New Haven Hospital, The First Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention of Hefei City (Hefei CDC), Anhui Province (Anhui Province CDC), and Fuyang City (Fuyang CDC). The LFA studied here detects SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG antibodies with a specificity of 97.9-100% for IgM, 99.7-100% for IgG, and sensitivities ranging from 94.1-100% for patients >14-days post symptom onset. Sensitivity decreases in patients <14-days post symptom onset, which is likely due to lower IgG/IgM antibody levels in this population. Finally, we developed a visual intensity reporting system that we believe will be suitable for laboratory and point-of-care settings, and will provide granular information about antibody levels.

Sociodemographic data, exposure to COVID-19, perception of psychological care needs, depression, anxiety, somatization, and post-traumatic symptoms were concurrently assessed. The majority of the sample (71%) suffered from somatization and 55% of distress. Female care workers experienced higher levels of anxiety (d = 0.50) and somatization symptoms (d = 0.82) and stated they needed psychological care more than men (p < .001). Younger participants (aged <40 years-old) reported higher levels of somatization, depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic symptoms (effects size range from d = 0.22 to d = 0.31). Working in a high infected area (red-zones) and directly with COVID-19 patients (front-line) affected the psychological health of participants to a smaller degree. Health-care workers who lost one of their patients reported higher levels of depression (d = 0.22), anxiety (d = 0.19), post-traumatic symptoms (d = 0.30), and psychological care needs than those who did not have the same experience (p < .01). Health-care workers who perceived the need for psychological support scored above the clinical alarming level (cut-off scores) in all the psychological scales, ranging from 76% to 88%. Psychological distress (p < .01), anxiety (p < .05), depression (p < .05), and being women (p < .01) contribute to explain the need for psychological care and accounted for 32% of the variance in this sample. These findings point out the importance to consider the psychological impact of COVID-19 on Italian health-care workers and strongly suggest establishing psychological support services for providing adequate professional care.","Conti, Chiara; Fontanesi, Lilybeth; Lanzara, Roberta; Rosa, Ilenia; Porcelli, Piero",PLoS One,462,32

Chest radiography (CXR) is routinely obtained at admission of COVID-19 patients. However, little is known regarding correlates between CXR severity and time to intubation. We hypothesize that the degree of opacification on CXR at time of admission independently predicts need and time to intubation. METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, we reviewed COVID-19 patients who were admitted to an urban medical center during March 2020 that had a CXR performed on the day of admission. CXRs were divided into 12 lung zones and were assessed by two blinded thoracic radiologists. A COVID-19 opacification rating score (CORS) was generated by assigning one point for each lung zone in which an opacity was observed. Underlying comorbidities were abstracted and assessed for association. RESULTS: One hundred forty patients were included in this study and 47 (34%) patients required intubation during the admission. Patients with CORS ≥ 6 demonstrated significantly higher rates of early intubation within 48 h of admission and during the hospital stay (ORs 24 h, 19.8, p < 0.001; 48 h, 28.1, p < 0.001; intubation during hospital stay, 6.1, p < 0.0001). There was no significant correlation between CORS ≥ 6 and age, sex, BMI, or any underlying cardiac or pulmonary comorbidities. CONCLUSIONS: CORS ≥ 6 at the time of admission predicts need for intubation, with significant increases in intubation at 24 and 48 h, independent of comorbidities. KEY POINTS: • Chest radiography at the time of admission independently predicts time to intubation within 48 h and during the hospital stay in COVID-19 patients. • More opacities on chest radiography are associated with several fold increases in early mechanical ventilation among COVID-19 patients. • Chest radiography is useful in identifying COVID-19 patients whom may rapidly deteriorate and help inform clinical management as well as hospital bed and ventilation allocation.

Infection therefore requires close proximity of receptors and proteases. We considered whether tetraspanins, scaffolding proteins known to facilitate CoV infections, hold receptors and proteases together on cell membranes. Using knockout cell lines, we found that the tetraspanin CD9, but not the tetraspanin CD81, formed cell-surface complexes of dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), the MERS-CoV receptor, and the type II transmembrane serine protease (TTSP) member TMPRSS2, a CoV-activating protease. This CD9-facilitated condensation of receptors and proteases allowed MERS-CoV pseudoviruses to enter cells rapidly and efficiently. Without CD9, MERS-CoV viruses were not activated by TTSPs, and they trafficked into endosomes to be cleaved much later and less efficiently by cathepsins. Thus, we identified DPP4:CD9:TTSP as the protein complexes necessary for early, efficient MERS-CoV entry. To evaluate the importance of these complexes in an in vivo CoV infection model, we used recombinant Adenovirus 5 (rAd5) vectors to express human DPP4 in mouse lungs, thereby sensitizing the animals to MERS-CoV infection. When the rAd5-hDPP4 vectors co-expressed small RNAs silencing Cd9 or Tmprss2, the animals were significantly less susceptible, indicating that CD9 and TMPRSS2 facilitated robust in vivo MERS-CoV infection of mouse lungs. Furthermore, the S proteins of virulent mouse-adapted MERS-CoVs acquired a CD9-dependent cell entry character, suggesting that CD9 is a selective agent in the evolution of CoV virulence.","Earnest, James T.; Hantak, Michael P.; Li, Kun; McCray, Paul B.; Perlman, Stanley; Gallagher, Tom",PLoS Pathog,462,12

Our country faces a public health issue regarding adolescent pregnancy. This study assessed the predisposition of teenage mothers to postpartum depression and the influence of the viral pandemic on their emotional status. This study enrolled patients 10 to 19 years old who delivered in our department between March–December 2020. Teenagers were attributed to the “lockdown group” (n = 30) and the “open group” (n = 171). All study participants agreed to take an interview based on a three-part questionnaire, including the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS). In the “lockdown group”, 16.67% of patients felt stressed over the last year compared to 11.11% of individuals in the “open group”, but there was no statistically significant difference between groups regarding overall EPDS scores (z value 0.51, Mann–Whitney U test). Predictable variables for postpartum depression were the use of cigarettes (OR = 1.08, 95% CI: 1.00–1.16), intended pregnancies (OR = 0.25, 95% CI: 0.09–0.68, p = 0.007) and absence of stressors in the last year (OR = 0.07, 95% CI: 0.02–0.30, p = 0.0002). More adolescents were stressed during confinement compared to those who delivered in the following time period; this aspect did not interfere with depression screening scores. A planned pregnancy, even during adolescence, can serve as a protective factor for postpartum depression.","Matei, Alexandra; Dimitriu, Mihai Cornel Traian; Cirstoveanu, Catalin Gabriel; Socea, Bogdan; Ionescu, Cringu Antoniu",Healthcare (Basel),462,32

These appreciations may squeeze profit margins and lower export volumes. This paper investigates whether firms can weather appreciation periods by producing differentiated rather than commoditized products. To do this it investigates different sectors within the Japanese transportation equipment industry. Results from estimating pricing-to-market (PTM) coefficients indicate that firms producing differentiated products can pass-through more of exchange rate appreciations into higher foreign currency prices and thus better preserve their profit margins. Results from estimating trade elasticities are consistent with the PTM results and indicate that the automobile industry has exported much less than predicted after the yen depreciated in 2012. Finally, estimates of the stock market exposure across sectors indicates that the profitability of firms producing differentiated products is less exposed to appreciations. Producing differentiated, knowledge-intensive goods can thus help firms to survive endaka periods.","Thorbecke, Willem",Japan World Econ,462,16

METHODS: Data were collected via institutions’ respective electronic medical record systems. Local review boards approved this cross‐institutional study. RESULTS: Among 5 transplant centers, 26 patients (62% male) were reviewed with a median age of 8 years. 6 were heart recipients, 8 kidney, 10 liver, and 2 lung. Presenting symptoms included cough (n=12 (46%)), fever (n=9 (35%)), dry/sore throat (n=3 (12%)), rhinorrhea (n=3 (12%)), anosmia (n=2 (8%)), chest pain (n=2 (8%)), diarrhea (n=2 (8%)), dyspnea (n=1 (4%)), and headache (n=1 (4%)). Six patients (23%) were asymptomatic. No patient required supplemental oxygen, intubation, or ECMO.

As of November 18, 2020, SARS-CoV-2 has claimed more than 1,342,709 lives, with a global mortality rate of ~2.4% and a recovery rate of ~69.6%. Understanding the interaction of cellular targets with the SARS-CoV-2 infection is crucial for therapeutic development. Therefore, the aim of this study was to perform a comparative analysis of transcriptomic signatures of infection of SARS-CoV-2 compared to other respiratory viruses (EBOV, H1N1, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV), to determine a unique anti-SARS-CoV-2 gene signature. We identified for the first time that molecular pathways for heparin-binding, RAGE, miRNA, and PLA2 inhibitors were associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. The NRCAM and SAA2 genes, which are involved in severe inflammatory responses, and the FGF1 and FOXO1 genes, which are associated with immune regulation, were found to be associated with the cellular gene response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Moreover, several cytokines, most significantly IL-8 and IL-6, demonstrated key associations with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Interestingly, the only response gene that was shared among the five viral infections was SERPINB1. The protein-protein interaction (PPI) analysis shed light on genes with high interaction activity that SARS-CoV-2 shares with other viral infections. The findings showed that the genetic pathways associated with rheumatoid arthritis, the AGE-RAGE signaling system, malaria, hepatitis B, and influenza A were of high significance. We found that the virogenomic transcriptome of infection, gene modulation of host antiviral responses, and GO terms of SARS-CoV-2 and EBOV were more similar than to SARS, H1N1, and MERS. This work compares the virogenomic signatures of highly pathogenic viruses and provides valid targets for potential therapy against SARS-CoV-2.","Alsamman, Alsamman M.; Zayed, Hatem",PLoS One,462,20

The aim of this study is to examine the correlation of mental health status, sleep quality, and inflammatory markers, virus negative conversion time (NCT) among confirmed patients during the COVID-19 outbreak. A cross-sectional survey was conducted in this study. Data from 66 patients assessed with demographic information, anxious symptom, depressive symptom, stress, and sleep quality were collected using a smartphone-based questionnaire platform and then clinical characteristics and laboratory indicators were collected using case review. Nearly 30% of the participants reported depression, anxiety, perceived pressure, and poor sleep quality. Compared with the group without depression, neutrophil count, and ratio of neutrophil count to lymphocyte count (NLR) in the depression disorder group were increased (P = .028, 0.043). There was also a significant difference in NLR and NCT between the anxiety group and the non-anxiety group (P = .021, .024). Similarly, compared with the good sleep quality group, NLR in the poor sleep quality group was increased (P = .011). Correlation analysis indicated that Self-Rating Depression Scale score was positively related to neutrophil count and NLR (r = 0.366, 0.330, P = .016, .031). The total score of Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) was negatively related to lymphocyte count (r = −0.317, P = .049), and the sleep disturbance as 1 of the 7 dimensions of PSQI scale was positively correlated with NCT and NLR (r = 0.370, 0.340, P = .020, .034). In our study, confirmed patients were prone to have psychological and sleep problems. The level of inflammation in patients with psychological and sleep problems was higher than that in patients without corresponding problems. The inflammatory level increased with the increase of Self-Rating Depression Scale score, and the lymphocyte count decreased with the increase of the PSQI score.

To this aim, we administered an online questionnaire about COVID-19 together with other questionnaires assessing the psychological condition of participants. First, we found that the exposition to infection risk, due to living area or job, increased the perceived stress and anxiety (i.e., medical staff in North Italy was more stressed and anxious with respect to both medical- and non-medical participants from Center and South Italy). Then, we conducted hierarchical logistic regression models on our data to assess the response odds ratio relatively to each regressor on each dependent variable. We found that health workers reported higher risk perception, level of worry, and knowledge as related to COVID-19 infection compared to the general population. Psychological state, sex, and living area were less related to these factors. Instead, judgments about behaviors and containment rules were more linked to demographics, such as sex.

Online education has been gaining momentum in almost all countries around the world. This coincides with the recently introduced competency-based medical education in India which has embraced online education. This poses a new challenge for the institutions involved, the instructors or teachers, and the students since they must adapt quickly to the new mode of learning. Online education requires teachers to improve their competency in three major areas; pedagogy, technology, and content knowledge. Some of the challenges include; lack of technological skill, poor time management and lack of infrastructure. As technology rapidly advances, health care education systems must also advance in tandem. To implement the new competency-based system and online education, the institutions and the individuals must realize the importance of online education, identify the barriers and quickly work on solutions for success. METHODS: This review was conducted based on various research papers on the topic of online medical education, the challenges faced by faculty members, and the opinion of students on this dilemma. Search terms included online medical education, COVID19, competency-based medical education. CONCLUSION: This review identified various challenges posed by online education on the current medical curriculum, faced by both faculty members and students, especially under the light of the Competency-Based Undergraduate Curriculum for Indian Graduates. Different solutions were proposed to overcome these challenges.","Nimavat, Nirav; Singh, Shruti; Fichadiya, Nilesh; Sharma, Parul; Patel, Nilesh; Kumar, Manoj; Chauhan, Grishma; Pandit, Niraj",Adv Med Educ Pract,462,29

The aim of this study was to identify whether owning a cat and/or dog was associated with better psychological wellbeing during a strict lockdown period in Victoria, Australia, during the COVID-19 pandemic. Data were analysed from a large-scale mental health study: the COvid-19 and you: mentaL heaLth in AusTralia now survEy (COLLATE). The impact of pet ownership on levels of resilience, loneliness and quality of life were examined in a sample of 138 pet owners and 125 non-pet owners. Hierarchical linear regression analyses indicated that pet ownership was significantly associated with poorer quality of life, but not significantly associated with resilience or loneliness, after accounting for situational factors (e.g. job loss) and mood states. Contrary to expectations, the findings suggest that during a specific situation such as a pandemic, pets may contribute to increased burden among owners and contribute to poorer quality of life.","Phillipou, A; Tan, E J; Toh, W L; Van Rheenen, T E; Meyer, D; Neill, E; Sumner, P J; Rossell, S L",Australian veterinary journal,462,22

The seeds of Nigella sativa, which have many active constituents, are mainly used for medicine, food spice, and nutritional supplements in Egypt. Much attention has been paid to N. sativa seeds for their anticancer, antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, and immune properties. However, their active constituents and mechanisms underlying functions from N. sativa seeds is unclear. Thus, the bioactive constituents with immune regulation in N. sativa seeds were systematically studied. A new compound (3-methoxythymol-6-O-β-D-apiofuranosyl-(1→6)-β-D-glucopyranoside 1) and 11 known compounds (2–12) were separated from the N. sativa seeds by chromatographic methods. Their structures were then elucidated by spectroscopic analysis of MS, UV, IR, (1)H-, and (13)C-NMR. Furthermore, immunomodulatory effects of those compounds in RAW 264.7 cells were evaluated by phagocytosis, nitric oxide (NO) and cytokine release, related mRNA transcription, and key proteins expression in vitro. Monosaccharide derivatives, Ethyl-α-D-furaarabinose (5), and Ethyl-β-D-fructofuranoside (8) were shown to played bidirectional regulatory roles in immunity and anti-inflammation through the regulation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) signaling pathways. The results showed the active compounds and mechanisms of immune regulation in N. sativa, thus indicating that N. sativa seeds could be used as dietary supplements in immunomodulation.","Niu, Yun; Wang, Baoguang; Zhou, Li; Ma, Changyang; Waterhouse, Geoffrey I.

Nous rapportons ici le premier cas de syndrome Stevens-Johnson (SJS) associé à une infection à SARS-coV-2. Observations Une enfant de 7 ans était traitée par paracétamol et oxomémazine pour une rhinite allergique. À J5, une hyperthermie était observée, suivie d’un érythème des joues. Devant une généralisation de l’éruption, la patiente était prise en charge aux urgences où l’examen clinique mettait en évidence un exanthème bulleux, avec des érosions cutanées touchant majoritairement le tronc, les membres supérieurs et le visage avec signe de Nikolski positif. Des érosions des muqueuses orales, génitales et une conjonctivite étaient observées. Le tableau se compliquait d’une détresse respiratoire à la suite d’une laryngoscopie, 48h après son hospitalisation. La patiente était alors intubée pendant 7jours. En réanimation, la survenue d’une kératoconjonctivite érosive à fausse membrane et de symblépharons temporaux nécessitait la réalisation d’une double greffe de membrane amniotique et la pose d’anneaux de symplépharon. À son paroxysme, l’éruption touchait 60 % du tégument avec 10 % de surface décollée. Les hypothèses diagnostiques étaient celles d’un SJS médicamenteux ou infectieux. Le SJS était confirmé par l’histologie cutanée qui trouvait des bulles sous épidermiques avec nécroses kératinocytaires. Dans un contexte de pandémie, chez une patiente avec symptômes respiratoires et pyrexie, la PCR SARS-Cov-2 était réalisée et positive. Un scanner objectivait une atteinte pulmonaire compatible avec une infection à SARS-Cov-2. Les résultats sérologiques et PCR à la recherche de mycoplasma pneumoniae et d’autres causes infectieuses étaient négatifs. L’hypothèse médicamenteuse était improbable au vu du score chronologique, le diagnostic de SJS secondaire à une infection à SARS-Cov-2 était retenu. L’évolution cutanée était rapidement favorable. Un symblépharon et une photophobie séquellaire persistaient. Discussion Dans les cas pédiatriques de SJS, une origine infectieuse est trouvée dans un tiers des cas. L’infection à SARS-Cov-2 symptomatique est rare en pédiatrie. Chez l’enfant, les manifestations cutanées rapportées sont des engelures, des érythèmes polymorphes, des éruptions urticariennes et papulo-vésiculeuses ou encore des exanthèmes maculo-papuleux. Des syndromes de Kawasaki atypique en lien avec une infection à SARS-Cov-2 ont également été décrits. À ce jour, aucune éruption cutanée grave comme celle présentée par notre patiente n’a été décrite. Les manifestations cutanées de la COVID-19 sont le plus souvent bégnines et sans incidence pronostic ou fonctionnelle. Cependant, ce SJS en lien avec une infection à SARS-Cov-2 montre l’importance de la prise en charge par un dermatologue pour repérer les éventuels signes de gravité et prévenir les séquelles.","Sergeant, M.; Monitor, L.; Barbier, C.-M.; Colné, J.; Bursztejn, A.-C.",Annales de Dermatologie et de Vénéréologie,462,16

The observed decrease in emergency department (ED) visits is unsurprising during this major crisis, as patients are likely to prioritize avoiding exposure to SARS-CoV-2 over addressing what they may perceive as mild symptoms of headache, lethargy, difficulty speaking, and numbness. In the central and south Texas regions where we practice, we suspect that patient admission, treatment, and discharge volumes for acute stroke treatment have decreased significantly since COVID-19–related shelter-at-home orders were issued. Symptoms of stroke are frequently noticed by a family member, friend, or community member before they are recognized by the patients themselves, and these symptoms may be going unnoticed due to limited face-to-face encounters. This possibility emphasizes the importance of patient education regarding stroke warning signs and symptoms during the current period of isolation and social-distancing. The south Texas population, already saddled with above-average rates of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease, has a higher stroke mortality rate compared to Texas and U.S. averages; however, the number of patients presenting to EDs with acute ischemic stroke diagnoses is lower than average. In our viewpoint, we aim to present the relative literature to date and outline our ongoing analyses of the highly affected and diverse stroke populations in San Antonio and Austin, Texas, to answer a simple question: where did all our stroke patients go?","Dula, Adrienne Nicole; Gealogo Brown, Gretchel; Aggarwal, Aarushi; Clark, Kal L",JMIR Aging,462,1

Dysregulated systemic inflammation and various patient traits are presumed to underlie this anomaly. Optimal VTE prophylaxis in COVID‐19 patients has not been established due to a lack of validated models for predicting VTE in this population. Our study aims to address this deficiency by identifying demographic and clinical characteristics of COVID‐19 patients associated with increased VTE risk. METHODS: This study is a retrospective analysis of all adult patients (final sample, n = 355) hospitalized with confirmed COVID‐19 at Einstein Medical Center Philadelphia between March 1 and April 24, 2020. Demographic and clinical patient data were collected and factors associated with VTE were identified and analyzed using t‐tests, multivariable logistic regression, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. RESULTS: Thirty patients (8.5%) developed VTE. Patients with VTE had significantly higher D‐dimer levels on admission (P = 0.045) and peak D‐dimer levels (P < 0.0001), in addition to higher rates of vasopressor requirements (P = 0.038), intubation (P = 0.003), and death (P = 0.023). Age (OR 1.042), obstructive sleep apnea (OR 5.107), and need for intubation (OR 3.796) were associated with significantly increased odds of VTE. Peak D‐dimer level was a good predictor of VTE (AUC 0.806, P < 0.0001) and a D‐dimer cutoff of >6640 ng/mL had high (>70%) sensitivity and specificity for VTE. CONCLUSION: Peak D‐dimer level may be the most reliable clinical marker in COVID‐19 patients for predicting VTE and future prospective studies should attempt to further validate this.","Barnes, Drew H.; Lo, Kevin Bryan; Bhargav, Ruchika; Gul, Fahad; DeJoy, Robert; Peterson, Eric; Salacup, Grace; Pelayo, Jerald; Albano, Jeri; Azmaiparashvili, Zurab; Rangaswami, Janani; Carpio, Andres Mora; Patarroyo‐Aponte, Gabriel",Clin Respir J,462,6

The activity of TFs on anti-oxidation, anti-mutagenicity, hypolipidemic, anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer, anti-viral effect as well as the epidemiological cure were sorted. Converging pioneer literature and deduction, the underlying formation mechanism of TFs was proposed. Subsequently, acquisition of TFs was pointed out to be the fundament for further research. Accelerated by enzyme, bio-synthesis of TFs were reviewed simultaneously. At the end, employing modern analysis instrument and technology, isolations of TFs were enumerated. Key findings and conclusions: Structure of the skeleton as well as functional groups were paramount related with the bio-activity of TFs.

In this meta-analysis, we aimed to explore the role of coagulopathy on the severity differences in patients with COVID-19. We conducted systematic literature search via Pubmed, Embase, Cochrane, WanFang Database, CNKI, and medRxiv from December 1, 2019 to May 1, 2020, to identify all original studies that reports on coagulation parameters (D-dimer, PLT, PT, APTT, and FIB) during COVID-19 infection. Thereafter, we compared the coagulation parameters between less severe and more severe cases. All Statistical analyses were performed via Stata14.0 software. A total of 3,952 confirmed COVID-19 infected patients were included from 25 studies. Patients with severe COVID-19 infection exhibited significantly higher levels of D-dimer, PT, and FIB (SMD 0.83, 95% CI: 0.70-0.97, I2 56.9%; SMD 0.39, 95% CI: 0.14-0.64, I2 77.9%; SMD 0.35, 95% CI: 0.17-0.53, I2 42.4% respectively). However, difference in PLT and APTT levels between less severe and more severe patients was not statistically significant (SMD-0.26, 95% CI: -0.56-0.05, I2 82.2%; SMD-0.14,95% CI: -0.45-0.18, I2 75.5% respectively) This meta-analysis revealed coagulopathy is associated with the severity of COVID-19.

Genetics have been largely associated with the development or the risk to develop dementing diseases. Recent advances in molecular technologies permit analyzing of several genes in a small time, but the interpretation analysis is complicated by several factors: the clinical complexity of neurodegenerative disorders, the frequency of co-morbidities, and the high phenotypic heterogeneity of genetic diseases. Genetic counselling supports the diagnostic path, providing an accurate familial and phenotypic characterisation of patients. In this review, we summarise neurodegenerative dementing disorders and their genetic determinants. Genetic variants and associated phenotypes will be divided into high and low impact, in order to reflect the pathologic continuum between multifactorial and mendelian genetic factors. Moreover, we report a molecular characterisation of genes associated with neurodegenerative disorders with cognitive impairment. In particular, the high frequency of rare coding genetic variants in dementing genes strongly supports the role of geneticists in both, clinical phenotype characterisation and interpretation of genotypic data. The smart application of exome analysis to dementia patients, with a pre-analytical selection on familial, clinical, and instrumental features, improves the diagnostic yield of genetic test, reduces time for diagnosis, and allows a rapid and personalised management of disease.","Zampatti, Stefania; Ragazzo, Michele; Peconi, Cristina; Luciano, Serena; Gambardella, Stefano; Caputo, Valerio; Strafella, Claudia; Cascella, Raffaella; Caltagirone, Carlo; Giardina, Emiliano",J Pers Med,462,16

Direct detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) nucleic acids in respiratory tract specimens informs patient, healthcare institution and public health level decision-making. The numbers of available SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid detection tests are rapidly increasing, as is the COVID-19 diagnostic literature. Thus, the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) recognized a significant need for frequently updated systematic reviews of the literature to inform evidence-based best practice guidance. OBJECTIVE: The IDSA’s goal was to develop an evidence-based diagnostic guideline to assists clinicians, clinical laboratorians, patients and policymakers in decisions related to the optimal use of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid amplification tests. In addition, we provide a conceptual framework for understanding molecular diagnostic test performance, discuss the nuance of test result interpretation in a variety of practice settings, and highlight important unmet research needs in the COVID-19 diagnostic testing space. METHODS: IDSA convened a multidisciplinary panel of infectious diseases clinicians, clinical microbiologists, and experts in systematic literature review to identify and prioritize clinical questions and outcomes related to the use of SARS-CoV-2 molecular diagnostics. Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology was used to assess the certainty of evidence and make testing recommendations. RESULTS: The panel agreed on 15 diagnostic recommendations. CONCLUSIONS: Universal access to accurate SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid testing is critical for patient care, hospital infection prevention and the public response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Information on the clinical performance of available tests is rapidly emerging, but the quality of evidence of the current literature is considered low to very low. Recognizing these limitations, the IDSA panel weighed available diagnostic evidence and recommends nucleic acid testing for all symptomatic individuals suspected of having COVID-19. In addition, testing is recommended for asymptomatic individuals with known or suspected contact with a COVID-19 case. Testing asymptomatic individuals without known exposure is suggested when the results will impact isolation/quarantine/personal protective equipment (PPE) usage decisions, dictate eligibility for surgery, or inform administration of immunosuppressive therapy. Ultimately, prioritization of testing will depend on institutional-specific resources and the needs of different patient populations.","Hanson, Kimberly E; Caliendo, Angela M; Arias, Cesar A; Englund, Janet A; Lee, Mark J; Loeb, Mark; Patel, Robin; El Alayli, Abdallah; Kalot, Mohamad A; Falck-Ytter, Yngve; Lavergne, Valery; Morgan, Rebecca L; Murad, M Hassan; Sultan, Shahnaz; Bhimraj, Adarsh; Mustafa, Reem A",Clin Infect Dis,462,16

In this study, we examined the relationship between influenza activity, meteorological parameters, and PM(2.5). METHODS: A total of 20 165 laboratory‐confirmed influenza cases in Hangzhou, Zhejiang province, were documented in our dataset and aggregated into weekly counts for downstream analysis. We employed a combination of the quasi‐Poisson‐generalized additive model and the distributed lag non‐linear model to examine the relationship of interest, controlling for long‐term trends, seasonal trends, and holidays. RESULTS: A hockey‐stick association was found between absolute humidity and the risk of influenza infections. The overall cumulative adjusted relative risk (ARR) was statistically significant when weekly mean absolute humidity was low (<10 µg/m(3)) and high (>17.5 µg/m(3)). A slightly higher ARR was observed when weekly mean temperature reached over 30.5°C. A statistically significantly higher ARR was observed when weekly mean relative humidity dropped below 67%. ARR increased statistically significantly with increasing rainfall. For PM(2.5), the ARR was marginally statistically insignificant. In brief, high temperature, wet and dry conditions, and heavy rainfall were the major risk factors associated with a higher risk of influenza infections.

We aimed to summarize and critically appraise systematic reviews of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in humans that were available at the beginning of the pandemic. METHODS: Nine databases (Medline, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, CINAHL, Web of Sciences, PDQ-Evidence, WHO’s Global Research, LILACS, and Epistemonikos) were searched from December 1, 2019, to March 24, 2020. Systematic reviews analyzing primary studies of COVID-19 were included. Two authors independently undertook screening, selection, extraction (data on clinical symptoms, prevalence, pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions, diagnostic test assessment, laboratory, and radiological findings), and quality assessment (AMSTAR 2). A meta-analysis was performed of the prevalence of clinical outcomes. RESULTS: Eighteen systematic reviews were included; one was empty (did not identify any relevant study). Using AMSTAR 2, confidence in the results of all 18 reviews was rated as “critically low”. Identified symptoms of COVID-19 were (range values of point estimates): fever (82–95%), cough with or without sputum (58–72%), dyspnea (26–59%), myalgia or muscle fatigue (29–51%), sore throat (10–13%), headache (8–12%) and gastrointestinal complaints (5–9%). Severe symptoms were more common in men. Elevated C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase, and slightly elevated aspartate and alanine aminotransferase, were commonly described. Thrombocytopenia and elevated levels of procalcitonin and cardiac troponin I were associated with severe disease. A frequent finding on chest imaging was uni- or bilateral multilobar ground-glass opacity. A single review investigated the impact of medication (chloroquine) but found no verifiable clinical data. All-cause mortality ranged from 0.3 to 13.9%. CONCLUSIONS: In this overview of systematic reviews, we analyzed evidence from the first 18 systematic reviews that were published after the emergence of COVID-19. However, confidence in the results of all reviews was “critically low”. Thus, systematic reviews that were published early on in the pandemic were of questionable usefulness.

These effects are mainly achieved by the driving effect of NAD(+) on metabolic pathways as enzyme cofactors transferring hydrogen in oxidation-reduction reactions. Besides, multiple NAD(+)-dependent enzymes are involved in physiology either by post-synthesis chemical modification of DNA, RNA and proteins, or releasing second messenger cyclic ADP-ribose (cADPR) and NAADP(+). Prolonged disequilibrium of NAD(+) metabolism disturbs the physiological functions, resulting in diseases including metabolic diseases, cancer, aging and neurodegeneration disorder. In this review, we summarize recent advances in our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of NAD(+)-regulated physiological responses to stresses, the contribution of NAD(+) deficiency to various diseases via manipulating cellular communication networks and the potential new avenues for therapeutic intervention.","Xie, Na; Zhang, Lu; Gao, Wei; Huang, Canhua; Huber, Peter Ernst; Zhou, Xiaobo; Li, Changlong; Shen, Guobo; Zou, Bingwen",Signal Transduct Target Ther,462,29

Awareness and attitude about this virus have an important impact on infection prevention and coping with stress and anxiety. So we conducted this study to assess knowledge, attitude, and mental health status in MS and NMOSD patients within the COVID-19 pandemic. METHOD: In this cross-sectional study, the link of Depression Anxiety Stress Scales-21 (DASS-21) and a self-administered structured questionnaire were sent through social media to MS and NMOSD patients and two control groups consisting of healthy and migraine individuals. RESULTS: A total of 223 MS patients, 41 NMOSD, 29 migraine, and 245 healthy subjects participated in this study. MS patients had higher total DASS scores compared to healthy participants (p = 0.012). There were no significant differences among the study groups regarding knowledge and attitude. In MS patients, physical comorbidity was associated with a total score of attitude (OR 1.59, 95% CI 0.53, 2.66, p = 0.004). We did not find association between other demographic and clinical variables with DASS scores, attitude, and knowledge in MS patients. CONCLUSION: The current data highlight the necessity of attitude, knowledge, and mental health assessment among MS and NMOSD patients. Further studies in other countries need to be carried to assess these points among MS and NMOSD patients.","Shaygannejad, Vahid; Afshari-Safavi, Alireza; Hatef, Boshra",Neurol Sci,462,1

In this mass spectrometry (MS)-based study, we reveal that out of 21 possible glycosites in the HCoV-19 S protein, 20 are completely occupied by N-glycans, predominantly of the oligomannose type. All seven glycosylation sites in human angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) were found to be completely occupied, mainly by complex N-glycans. However, glycosylation did not directly contribute to the binding affinity between HCoV-19 S and hACE2. Additional post-translational modification (PTM) was identified, including multiple methylated sites in both proteins and multiple sites with hydroxylproline in hACE2. Refined structural models of HCoV-19 S and hACE2 were built by adding N-glycan and PTMs to recently published cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures. The PTM and glycan maps of HCoV-19 S and hACE2 provide additional structural details for studying the mechanisms underlying host attachment and the immune response of HCoV-19, as well as knowledge for developing desperately needed remedies and vaccines.","Sun, Zeyu; Ren, Keyi; Zhang, Xing; Chen, Jinghua; Jiang, Zhengyi; Jiang, Jing; Ji, Feiyang; Ouyang, Xiaoxi; Li, Lanjuan",Engineering (Beijing),462,32

We assessed the risk of measles outbreaks during the pandemic in Kenya as a case study for the African Region. METHODS: Combining measles serological data, local contact patterns, and vaccination coverage into a cohort model, we predicted the age-adjusted population immunity in Kenya and estimated the probability of outbreaks when contact-reducing COVID-19 interventions are lifted. We considered various scenarios for reduced measles vaccination coverage from April 2020. RESULTS: In February 2020, when a scheduled SIA was postponed, population immunity was close to the herd immunity threshold and the probability of a large outbreak was 34% (8–54). As the COVID-19 contact restrictions are nearly fully eased, from December 2020, the probability of a large measles outbreak will increase to 38% (19–54), 46% (30–59), and 54% (43–64) assuming a 15%, 50%, and 100% reduction in measles vaccination coverage. By December 2021, this risk increases further to 43% (25–56), 54% (43–63), and 67% (59–72) for the same coverage scenarios respectively. However, the increased risk of a measles outbreak following the lifting of all restrictions can be overcome by conducting a SIA with ≥ 95% coverage in under-fives. CONCLUSION: While contact restrictions sufficient for SAR-CoV-2 control temporarily reduce measles transmissibility and the risk of an outbreak from a measles immunity gap, this risk rises rapidly once these restrictions are lifted. Implementing delayed SIAs will be critical for prevention of measles outbreaks given the roll-back of contact restrictions in Kenya.

OBJECTIVE: We examine the COVID-19-related healthcare utilization and mortality by race and ethnicity of patients tested for SARS-CoV-2 in the Veterans Health Administration (VHA). DESIGN: A retrospective cohort study. SETTING: We used the VHA COVID-19 shared data resources between February 1 and June 30, 2020. PARTICIPANTS: Veterans tested for SARS-CoV-2 virus by VHA. EXPOSURE(S): Three racial-ethnicity groups of Black, Hispanic, and White (as reference) veterans. MAIN OUTCOME(S) AND MEASURE(S): Main outcomes are testing rate, positivity rate, hospitalization rate, ICU admission rate, and in-hospital mortality. Controlling for sex, age, and Elixhauser comorbidity index, we report adjusted odds ratios (aOR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) from logistic regression models. RESULTS: Of the 8,667,996 active veteran enrollees, 252,702 were tested by VHA from February to June, 2020, with 20,500 positive results and 4,790 hospitalizations. The testing rate was 4.4% among Black and 4.7% among Hispanic veterans compared to White veterans, 2.8%. The testing positivity rate was similarly elevated among Black (12.2%) and Hispanic (11.6%) veterans compared to White veterans (6.0%). The aORs of hospitalization in Black veterans (1.88; 95% CI 1.74, 2.03) and Hispanic veterans (1.41; 95% CI 1.25, 1.60) were higher compared to White veterans. No significant differences by race and ethnicity were observed in OR or aOR of ICU admission and in-hospital death among hospitalized patients. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: On a national level, the VHA was more likely to test and hospitalize Black and Hispanic veterans compared to White veterans, but there were no significant differences in ICU admission or in-hospital mortality among those hospitalized. This pattern of differences may relate to social determinants of health, factors affecting access to non-VHA care, or preferences for VHA care affecting initial care seeking, but not in-hospital outcomes.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says it has been detected in nearly 200 countries and is an ongoing concern in the United States. Various reports provided anecdotal evidence that many ethnic minorities and specifically African Americans have become ill and died from COVID-19. Coincidentally, several states have provided data that at least initially corroborate the anecdotes. Narratives and descriptive data were compiled from medical and public health professionals to ascertain whether medical evidence supports the over-representation of state-level total infections and deaths of African Americans. The ramifications are critical for African Americans, non-medical professional, citizens, and also to the reduction and mitigation of the novel coronavirus as an American pandemic. The medical and health policy literature suggests that African Americans are burdened with a disproportionate share of persons contracting and dying due to COVID-19. Authors and witnesses believe that their occupation as essential workers, poverty, health access, government distrust, comorbidities, and Social Determinants of Health (SDH) are important factors for further research. For these reasons, federal funding of a rigorous and robust national public health study of COVID-19 and African Americans is highly recommended and the next logical step to develop mitigation strategies that reduce infection, mortality, and disparate medical outcomes.","Mangum, Vincent E.",J Afr Am Stud (New Brunsw),462,24

Dietary patterns have likely changed during the COVID-19 pandemic due to major shifts and crises in social, economic, and food systems. This study examines self-reported dietary changes in Los Angeles (L.A.) County during COVID-19, and identifies factors associated with making healthy and unhealthy changes. Data are from the Understanding Coronavirus in America Study, an internet panel of adults representative of L.A. County households (N = 1080). Multinomial logistic regression was used to test if self-reported change in diet healthiness assessed in July 2020 was associated with socio-ecological factors known to be associated with diet, assessed between April-July 2020. More than half of L.A. County residents reported making changes to their diet: 28.3% reported eating healthier food since the beginning of the pandemic, while 24.8% reported eating less healthy food. Individuals who were significantly more likely to report healthy changes were Non-Hispanic Black or Hispanic/Latino (vs. Non-Hispanic White), had received unemployment insurance, or had larger social networks. Individuals who were significantly more likely to report unhealthy changes were younger, of mixed race, had children in their household, had transportation barriers, or had obesity. Individuals who were significantly more likely to report both healthy and unhealthy changes were Asian, had experienced food insecurity, or had challenges getting food due to store closures. The pandemic may be exacerbating diet-related disease risk in some groups, such as communities of color, and among individuals with obesity and those facing transportation barriers.","Miller, Sydney; Bruine de Bruin, Wandi; Livings, Michelle; Wilson, John; Weber, Kate; Frazzini, Alison; Babboni, Marianna; de la Haye, Kayla",Appetite,462,29

We performed complete genome sequencing on two EV71 (SZ/HK08-5 and SZ/HK08-6) and two CA16 (SZ/HK08-3 and SZ/HK08-7) strains from patients in Shenzhen, China. Phylogenetic, similarity plot and bootscan analyses revealed recombination between EV71 genotypes B and C at the 2A–2B junction, and between EV71 genotype B and CA16 strain G-10 in the 3C region for EV71 strains. A similar phenomenon was also found upon further gene sequencing with other EV71 strains. Recombination between CA16 strain G-10 and EV71 genotype A at the 2A–2B junction was also observed for CA16 strains. The present “double-recombinant” EV71 strains circulating in China and other EV71 subgenotype “C4” strains represent an additional genotype, D.

We found that cholesterol depletion from the cellular membrane by methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MβCD) significantly impaired the efficiency of TGEV infection. Infectivity was also reduced after depleting cholesterol from the viral envelope. This finding is surprising because coronaviruses bud from a pre-Golgi compartment which is expected to be low in cholesterol compared to the plasma membrane. Addition of exogenous cholesterol resulted in a restoration of the infectivity confirming our conclusion that efficient TGEV infection requires cholesterol in both the viral and the cellular membranes. Our data raise the possibility that the viral and cellular proteins involved in the entry process may be associated with cholesterol-rich membrane microdomains.","Ren, Xiaofeng; Glende, Joerg; Yin, Jiechao; Schwegmann-Wessels, Christel; Herrler, Georg",Virus Res,462,16

The state also offers the highest wages for migrant workers for jobs in the unorganised sector in the entire Indian subcontinent. Further, the state has evolved several measures for the inclusion of the workers and was able to effectively respond to their distress during the national lockdown. This paper examines labour migration to Kerala, key measures by the government to promote the social security of the workers and the state’s response to the distress of migrant workers during lockdown, by synthesising the available secondary evidence. The welfare measures as well as interventions initiated by the state are exemplary and promising given the intent and provisions. However, some of them do not appear to have consideration of the grassroots requirements and implementation mechanisms to enhance access. As a result, the policy intent and substantial investments have not yielded the expected results. The state’s effective response to the distress of workers during the lockdown emanates from its overall disaster preparedness and resilience achieved from confronting with two consecutive state-wide natural disasters and a public health emergency in the immediate past. While the government has played a strategic role through policy imperative and ensuring a synergistic response, the data presented by the state indicate a much larger but invisible role played by the employers and civil society in providing food and shelter to workers.","Peter, Benoy; Sanghvi, Shachi; Narendran, Vishnu",Indian J Labour Econ,462,1

In this study, we sequenced whole MERS-CoV genomes directly from respiratory samples collected from 23 confirmed MERS cases in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). These samples included cases from three nosocomial and three household clusters. The sequences were analysed for changes and relatedness with regard to the collected epidemiological data and other available MERS-CoV genomic data. Sequence analysis supports the epidemiological data within the clusters, and further, suggests that these clusters emerged independently. To understand how and when these clusters emerged, respiratory samples were taken from dromedary camels, a known host of MERS-CoV, in the same geographic regions as the human clusters. Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus genomes from six virus-positive animals were sequenced, and these genomes were nearly identical to those found in human patients from corresponding regions. These data demonstrate a genetic link for each of these clusters to a camel and support the hypothesis that human MERS-CoV diversity results from multiple zoonotic introductions.","Paden, C.

In this study, we found that peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from fully recovered SARS individuals rapidly produced IFN-γ and IL-2 following stimulation with a pool of overlapping peptides that cover the entire N protein sequence. The N-specific IFN-γ(+)CD4(+) T cells were mainly composed of CD45RA(−)CCR7(+)CD62L(−) cells, whereas IFN-γ(+)CD8(+) memory T cells were mostly contained within CD45RA(+)CCR7(−)CD62L(−) cell population. Epitope mapping study indicated that a cluster of overlapping peptides located in the C-terminal region (amino acids [aa] 331 to 362) of N protein contained at least two different T-cell epitopes.

Design: Retrospective cohort study Setting: A multicenter cohort across ten Dutch hospitals including patients from February 27 to June 8 2020. Participants: SARS-CoV-2 positive patients (age [≥] 18) admitted to the hospital. Main Outcome Measures: 21-day mortality evaluated by the area under the receiver operatory curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value. The predictive value of age was explored by comparison with age-based rules used in practice and by excluding age from analysis. Results: 2273 patients were included, of whom 516 had died or discharged to palliative care within 21 days after admission. Five feature sets, including premorbid, clinical presentation and laboratory & radiology values, were derived from 80 features. Additionally, an ANOVA-based data-driven feature selection selected the ten features with the highest F-values: age, number of home medications, urea nitrogen, lactate dehydrogenase, albumin, oxygen saturation (%), oxygen saturation is measured on room air, oxygen saturation is measured on oxygen therapy, blood gas pH and history of chronic cardiac disease.

In such outbreaks, many countries especially developing or underdevelopment faces a situation where the number of infected individuals is getting larger and the medical facilities are limited. In this paper, we construct an epidemic model to explore the transmission dynamics of vector-borne diseases with nonlinear saturated incidence rate and saturated treatment function. This type of incidence rate, as well as the saturated treatment function, is also known as the Holling type II form and describes the effect of delayed treatment. Initially, we formulate a mathematical model and then present the basic analysis of the model including the positivity and boundedness of the solution. The threshold quantity [Formula: see text] is presented and the stability analysis of the system is carried out for the model equilibria. The global stability results are shown using the Lyapunov function of Goh–Voltera type. The existence of backward bifurcation is discussed using the central manifold theory. Further, the global sensitivity analysis of the model is carried out using the Latin Hypercube sampling and the partial rank correlation coefficient techniques.

METHODS: The mortality rate was evaluated using conditional probability to identify the significant factors, and adjusted odds ratios (ORs) using a multivariable logistic regression analysis were estimated. RESULTS: The mortality rate of patients with underlying health conditions was 12%, which was 4 times higher than that of patients without underlying health conditions. Furthermore, the mortality rates of women and men with underlying health conditions were 5.5 and 3.4 times higher than the mortality rates of patients without underlying health conditions, respectively. In a multivariable logistic regression analysis including sex, age, and underlying health conditions, male sex (OR: 1.83), age ≥ 41 y (ORs > 2.70), and underlying health conditions (OR: 2.20) were confirmed as risk factors for death. CONCLUSIONS: More attention should be paid to older patients with underlying diseases and male patients with underlying diseases as the probability of death in this population was significantly higher.","Choi, Won-Young",Disaster medicine and public health preparedness,462,1

We propose a new self-exciting probability peaks-over-threshold (SEP-POT) model for forecasting the extreme loss probability and the value at risk. The model draws from the point-process approach to the POT methodology but is built under a discrete-time framework. Thus, time is treated as an integer value and the days of extreme loss could occur upon a sequence of indivisible time units. The SEP-POT model can capture the self-exciting nature of extreme event arrival, and hence, the strong clustering of large drops in financial prices. The triggering effect of recent events on the probability of extreme losses is specified using a discrete weighting function based on the at-zero-truncated Negative Binomial (NegBin) distribution. The serial correlation in the magnitudes of extreme losses is also taken into consideration using the generalized Pareto distribution enriched with the time-varying scale parameter. In this way, recent events affect the size of extreme losses more than distant events. The accuracy of SEP-POT value at risk (VaR) forecasts is backtested on seven stock indexes and three currency pairs and is compared with existing well-recognized methods. The results remain in favor of our model, showing that it constitutes a real alternative for forecasting extreme quantiles of financial returns.","Bień-Barkowska, Katarzyna",Entropy (Basel),462,1

Thus, early identification of patients at risk of poor outcomes is critical. Our objective was to analyse SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection in serum as a severity biomarker in COVID-19. Methods and Findings Retrospective observational study including 193 patients admitted for COVID-19. Detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in serum (CoVemia) was performed with samples collected at 48-72 hours of admission by two techniques from Roche and Thermo Fischer Scientific (TFS). Main outcome variables were mortality and need for ICU admission during hospitalization for COVID-19. CoVemia was detected in 50-60% of patients depending on technique. The correlation of Ct in serum between both techniques was good (intraclass correlation coefficient: 0.612; p < 0.001). Patients with CoVemia were older (p = 0.006), had poorer baseline oxygenation (PaO2/FiO2; p < 0.001), more severe lymphopenia (p < 0.001) and higher LDH (p < 0.001), IL-6 (p = 0.021), C-reactive protein (CRP; p = 0.022) and procalcitonin (p = 0.002) serum levels. We defined ""relevant CoVemia"" when detection Ct was < 34 with Roche and < 31 for TFS. These thresholds had 95% sensitivity and 35 % specificity. Relevant CoVemia predicted death during hospitalization (OR 9.2 [3.8 - 22.6] for Roche, OR 10.3 [3.6 - 29.3] for TFS; p < 0.001). Cox regression models, adjusted by age, sex and Charlson index, identified increased LDH serum levels and relevant CoVemia (HR = 9.87 [4.13-23.57] for TFS viremia and HR = 7.09 [3.3-14.82] for Roche viremia) as the best markers to predict mortality. Conclusions CoVemia assessment at admission is the most useful biomarker for predicting mortality in COVID-19 patients. CoVemia is highly reproducible with two different techniques (TFS and Roche), has a good consistency with other severity biomarkers for COVID-19 and better predictive accuracy.","Rodriguez Serrano, D.

Additionally, the inappropriate disposal and sterilization of PPE may result in a high risk of cross-contamination. Therefore, the exploration of antimicrobial materials possessing both microbe interception and self-decontamination effects to develop reusable and easy-to-sterilize PPE is of great importance. Herein, an aggregation-induced emission (AIE)-active luminogen-loaded nanofibrous membrane (TTVB@NM) sharing sunlight-triggered photodynamic/photothermal anti-pathogen functions are prepared using the electrospinning technique. Thanks to its porous nanostructure, TTVB@NM shows excellent interception effects toward ultrafine particles and pathogenic aerosols. Benefiting from the superior photophysical properties of the AIE-active dopants, TTVB@NM exhibits integrated properties of wide absorption in visible light range, efficient ROS generation, and moderate photothermal conversion performance. A series of antimicrobial evaluations reveal that TTVB@NM could effectively inactivate pathogenic aerosols containing bacteria (inhibition rate: >99%), fungi (~88%), and viruses (>99%) within only 10 min sunlight irradiation. This study represents a new strategy to construct reusable and easy-to-sterilize hybrid materials for potential bioprotective applications.","Li, Meng; Wen, Haifei; Li, Haoxuan; Yan, Zhi-Chao; Li, Ying; Wang, Lei; Wang, Dong; Tang, Ben Zhong",Biomaterials,462,20

The 3C protease has been regarded as a valid target due to its structural similarity among different picornaviruses and minimal sequence similarity with host proteins; therefore, the development of potent inhibitors against the 3C protease as an antiviral drug is ongoing. Duck hepatitis A virus (DHAV) belongs to the Picornavidea family and is a major threat to the poultry industry. To date, little is known about the roles of the DHAV 3C protease plays during infection. METHODS: In this study, we compared the full-length DHAV 3C protein sequence with other 3C sequences to obtain an alignment for the construction of a phylogenetic tree. Then, we expressed and purified recombinant DHAV 3C protease in the BL21 expression system using nickel-NTA affinity chromatography. The optimization of the cleavage assay conditions and the kinetic analysis for DHAV 3C protease were done by in vitro cleavage assays with a fluorogenic peptide respectively. The inhibitory activity of rupintrivir against the DHAV 3C protease was further evaluated. The localization of the 3C protease in infected and transfected cells was determined using immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy. RESULTS: Under different expression conditions, the 3C protease was found to be highly expressed after induction with 1 mM IPTG at 16 °C for 10 h. We synthesized a fluorogenic peptide derived from the cleavage site of the DHAV polyprotein and evaluated the protease activity of the DHAV 3C protease for the first time. We used fluorimetric based kinetic analysis to determine kinetic parameters, and V(max) and K(m) values were determined to be 16.52 nmol/min and 50.78 μM, respectively. Rupintrivir was found to exhibit inhibitory activity against the DHAV 3C protease. Using polyclonal antibody and an indirect immunofluorescence microscopy assay (IFA), it was determined that the DHAV 3C protease was found in the nucleus during infection. In addition, the DHAV 3C protease can enter into the nucleus without the cooperation of viral proteins. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to examine the activity of the DHAV 3C protease, and the activity of the DHAV 3C protease is temperature-, pH- and NaCl concentration- dependent. The DHAV 3C protease localizes throughout DHAV-infected cells and can enter into the nucleus in the absence of other viral proteins. The kinetic analysis was calculated, and the V(max) and K(m) values were 16.52 nmol/min and 50.78 μM, respectively, using the Lineweaver–Burk plot.","Sun, Di; Wang, Mingshu; Wen, Xingjian; Mao, Sai; Cheng, Anchun; Jia, Renyong; Yang, Qiao; Wu, Ying; Zhu, Dekang; Chen, Shun; Liu, Mafeng; Zhao, Xinxin; Zhang, Shaqiu; Chen, Xiaoyue; Liu, Yunya; Yu, Yanling; Zhang, Ling",Virol J,462,1

For this purpose, we developed a novel approach using ensemble docking high-throughput virtual screening directly coupled with subsequent Linear Interaction Energy (LIE) calculations to maximize the conformational space sampling and to assess the binding affinity of identified inhibitors.

Methods: Data from five ECMO centers included 300 patients on VA and 329 on VV ECMO support (March 2008 to November 2016). Different prognostic scores were compared between survivors and non-survivors: APACHE II, SOFA, SAPS II in all patients; SAVE, modified SAVE and MELD-XI in VA ECMO; RESP, PRESET, ROCH and PRESERVE in VV ECMO. Model performance was compared using receiver-operating-curve analysis and assessment of model calibration. Survival was assessed at intensive care unit discharge. Results: The main indication for VA ECMO was cardiogenic shock; overall survival was 51%. ICU survivors had higher Glasgow Coma Scale scores and pH, required cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) less frequently, had lower lactate levels and shorter ventilation time pre-ECMO at baseline. The best discrimination between survivors and non-survivors was observed with the SAPS II score (area under the curve [AUC] of 0.73 (95% CI 0.67–0.78)). The main indication for VV ECMO was pneumonia; overall survival was 60%. Lower PaCO(2), higher pH, lower lactate and lesser need for CPR were observed among survivors. The best discrimination between survivors and non-survivors was observed with the PRESET score (AUC 0.66 (95% CI 0.60–0.72)). Conclusion: The prognostic performance of most scores was moderate in ECMO patients.

The present work addresses a way to connect reinforcement learning to new technologies such as car-to-infrastructure communication in order to augment the drivers knowledge in an attempt to accelerate the learning process. Our method was compared to both a classical, iterative approach, as well as to standard reinforcement learning without communication. Results show that our method outperforms both of them. Further, we have performed robustness tests, by allowing messages to be lost, and by reducing the storage capacity of the communication devices. We were able to show that our method is not only tolerant to information loss, but also points out to improved performance when not all agents get the same information.

Both selection and exclusion presumably can occur in the compartment where assembly of the secretory granule begins, the trans most cisternae of the Golgi complex. Current research focused on the initial stages of secretory granule formation includes a search for the ‘signals’ which may mediate active sorting of components into secretory granules, and the role of aggregation of regulated secretory proteins in sorting. In addition, the temporal sequence of the sorting events in the Golgi, and post-Golgi compartments has gained much attention, as summarized by the alternative but not mutually exclusive ‘sorting for entry’ vs. ‘sorting by retention’ models. ‘Sorting for entry’ which encompasses the most popular models requires selection of cargo and membrane and exclusion of non-secretory granule proteins in the TGN prior to secretory granule formation. ‘Sorting by retention’ stipulates that protein selection or exclusion may occur after secretory granule formation: secretory granule specific components are retained during maturation of the granule while non-secretory granule molecules are removed in vesicles which bud from maturing secretory granules. Finally, some progress has been made in the identification of cytosolic components involved in the budding of nascent secretory granules from the TGN. This review will focus on the recent data concerning the events in secretory granule formation which occur, in the trans-Golgi network.","Tooze, Sharon A",Biochim Biophys Acta Mol Cell Res,462,32

Methods 116 hospitalized COVID-19-confirmed patients enrolled in this study were hospitalized in the Department of Infectious Diseases, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University from January 14 to February 13, 2020. The recorded information includes demographic data, medical history, contact history, potential comorbidities, symptoms, signs, laboratory test results, chest computer tomography (CT) scans, and treatment measures. SARS-CoV-2 RNA in 53 urine sediments of enrolled patients was examined by real-time RT-PCR. Findings 12 (10.8%) and 8 (7.2%) patients showed mild elevation of blood urea nitrogen or creatinine, and trace or 1+ albuminuria respectively in 111 COVID-19-confirmed patients without basic kidney disease.

The current standard of care leads to a sustained viral response of roughly 50% of treated patients at best. Furthermore, anti-viral therapy is expensive, prolonged, and associated with serious side-effects. Evidence suggests that a poor response to treatment may be the result of a suppressed anti-viral immunity due to the presence of increased numbers and activity of CD4(+)CD25(+)Foxp3(+) regulatory T cells (Treg cells). We and others have recently identified fibrinogen-like protein 2 (FGL2) as a putative effector of Treg cells, which accounts for their suppressive function through binding to Fc gamma receptors (FcγR). In an experimental model of fulminant viral hepatitis, our laboratory showed that increased plasma levels of FGL2 pre- and post-viral infection were predictive of susceptibility and severity of disease. Moreover, treatment with antibody to FGL2 fully protected susceptible animals from the lethality of the virus, and adoptive transfer of wild-type Treg cells into resistant fgl2-deficient animals accelerated their mortality post-infection. In patients with HCV infection, plasma levels of FGL2 and expression of FGL2 in the liver correlated with the course and severity of the disease. Collectively, these studies suggest that FGL2 may be used as a biomarker to predict disease progression in HCV patients and be a logical target for the development of novel therapeutic approaches for the treatment of patients with HCV infection.","Shalev, Itay; Selzner, Nazia; Helmy, Ahmed; Foerster, Katharina; Adeyi, Oyedele A.; Grant, David R.; Levy, Gary",Rambam Maimonides Med J,462,1

Initially, we considered the first and second vaccination doses as multiple vaccinations were initiated worldwide. The concerned models are then tested for the Saudi Arabia second virus wave, which is assumed to start on 1st March 2021. Four daily vaccination scenarios for the first and second dose are assumed for 100 days from the wave beginning. One of these scenarios is based on function optimization using the invasive weed optimization algorithm (IWO). After that, we numerically solve the established models using the fractional Euler method and the Euler-Murayama method. Finally, the obtained virus dynamics using the assumed scenarios and the real one started by the government are compared. The optimized scenario using the IWO effectively minimizes the predicted cumulative wave infections with a 4.4 % lower number of used vaccination doses.","Omar, Othman A.M.; Alnafisah, Yousef; Elbarkouky, Reda A.; Ahmed, Hamdy M.",Results Phys,462,27

Although Real Time Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (qRT-PCR) of respiratory specimens is the gold standard test for detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection, collecting nasopharyngeal swabs causes discomfort to patients and may represent considerable risk for healthcare workers. The use of saliva as a diagnostic sample has several advantages. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to validate the use of saliva as a biological sample for diagnosis of COVID-19. METHODS: This study was conducted at Infectious Diseases Research Laboratory (LAPI), in Salvador, Brazil. Participants presenting with signs/symptoms suggesting SARS-CoV-2 infection underwent a nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) and/or oropharyngeal swab (OPS), and saliva collection. Saliva samples were diluted in PBS, followed by RNA isolation and RT-Real Time PCR for SARS-CoV-2. Results of conventional vs saliva samples testing were compared. Statistical analyses were performed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences software (SPSS) version 18.0. RESULTS: One hundred fifty-five participants were recruited and samples pairs of NPS/OPS and saliva were collected. The sensitivity and specificity of RT-PCR using saliva samples were 94.4% (95% CI 86.4–97.8) and 97.62% (95% CI 91.7–99.3), respectively. There was an overall high agreement (96.1%) between the two tests. CONCLUSIONS: Use of self-collected saliva samples is an easy, convenient, and low-cost alternative to conventional NP swab-based molecular tests. These results may allow a broader use of molecular tests for management of COVID19 pandemic, especially in resources-limited settings.","Vaz, Sara Nunes; Santana, Daniele Souza de; Netto, Eduardo Martins; Pedroso, Celia; Wang, Wei-Kung; Santos, Felice Deminco Alves; Brites, Carlos",Braz J Infect Dis,462,2

In addition to the direct cytopathic effect of the virus, the host hyper-inflammatory response has emerged as a key factor in determining disease severity and mortality. Accumulating clinical observations raised hypotheses to explain why some patients develop more severe disease while others only manifest mild or no symptoms. So far, Covid-19 management remains mainly supportive. However, many researches are underway to clarify the role of antiviral and immunomodulating drugs in changing morbidity and mortality in patients who become severely ill. This review summarizes the current state of knowledge on the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 and the host immune system and discusses recent findings on proposed pharmacologic treatments.","Lega, Sara; Naviglio, Samuele; Volpi, Stefano; Tommasini, Alberto",Vaccines (Basel),462,9

Using a replicating modified vaccinia virus Tian Tan strain (MVTT) as a vaccine vector, we constructed MVTT(HA-QH) and MVTT(HA-AH), which expresses the H5 gene of a goose-derived Qinghai strain A/Bar-headed Goose/Qinghai/1/2005 or human-derived Anhui Strain A/Anhui/1/2005. The immunogenicity profiles of both vaccine candidates were evaluated. Vaccination with MVTT(HA-QH) induced a significant level of neutralizing antibodies (Nabs) against a homologous strain and a wide range of H5N1 pseudoviruses (clades 1, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3.2, and 2.3.4). Neutralization tests (NT) and Haemagglutination inhibition (HI) antibodies inhibit the live autologous virus as well as a homologous A/Xingjiang/1/2006 and a heterologous A/Vietnam/1194/2004, representing two human isolates from clade 2.2 and clade 1, respectively. Importantly, mice vaccinated with intranasal MVTT(HA-QH) were completely protected from challenge with lethal dosages of A/Bar-headed Goose/Qinghai/1/2005 and the A/Viet Nam/1194/2004, respectively, but not control mice that received a mock MVTT(S) vaccine. However, MVTT(HA-AH) induced much lower levels of NT against its autologous strain. Our results suggest that it is feasible to use the H5 gene from A/Bar-headed Goose/Qinghai/1/2005 to construct an effective vaccine, when using MVTT as a vector, to prevent infections against homologous and genetically divergent human H5N1 influenza viruses.","Xiao, Haixia; Liu, Li; Zhu, Qingyu; Tan, Zhiwu; Yu, Wenbo; Tang, Xian; Zhan, Dawei; Du, Yanhua; Wang, Haibo; Liu, Di; Li, Zhixin; Yuen, Kwok-Yung; Ho, David D.; Gao, George F.; Chen, Zhiwei",PLoS One,462,16

Medical care will increasingly depend on computer-generated probabilities guided and supported by a growing variety of individuals in health care-related professions, including statisticians, technologists, and information managers. Perhaps the biggest challenge to the profession will come from the erosion of professional autonomy, driven by smart machines, social networks, and internet search engines. As a result of these and other changes, physicians are facing a systematic loss of control, often without the direct input and leadership of the profession itself. In this commentary, the author urges the profession to adopt several strategies, including shifting its focus from reimbursement to the care patients value most, meaningfully addressing critical issues in health policy, becoming the definitive source for publicly available medical information, reimagining medical education, and overhauling the existing accreditation and licensing systems. Medical education must go beyond a focus on physicians whose professional identity revolves around being the exclusive source of medical knowledge. In the digitized 21st century, medical education should emphasize the centrality of the humanistic interface with patients such that the doctor-patient relationship is paramount in the complex medical world of machines and social media. Removing the roadblocks to successful professional reform is no small task, but the process can begin with a grassroots movement that empowers physicians and facilitates organizational and behavioral change. Failure to take action may well hasten the diminishment of patient care and the profession's trusted role in society.","Wartman, Steven A",Acad Med,462,22

The mandatory remote working and the constant use of technology for employees raised different implications related to technostress and psycho-physical disorders. This study aimed to detect, in such a period of crisis and changes, the role of organizational communication considering the mediating role of both technostress and self-efficacy, with psycho-physical disorders as outcome. The research involved 530 workers working from home. A Structural Equations Model was estimated, revealing that organizational communication is positively associated with self-efficacy and negatively with technostress and psycho-physical disorders. As mediators, technostress is positively associated with psycho-physical disorders, whereas self-efficacy is negatively associated. As regards mediated effects, results showed negative associations between organizational communication and psycho-physical disorders through both technostress and self-efficacy. This study highlighted the potential protective role of organizational communication that could buffer the effect of technostress and enhance a personal resource, self-efficacy, which is functional to the reduction of psycho-physical disorders. This study contributed to literature underlying the role of communication in the current crisis and consequent reorganization of the working processes.","Zito, Margherita; Ingusci, Emanuela; Cortese, Claudio G.; Giancaspro, Maria Luisa; Manuti, Amelia; Molino, Monica; Signore, Fulvio; Russo, Vincenzo",Int J Environ Res Public Health,462,21

It has been reported that fibrillarin is involved in the methylation of histone H2A in nucleoli and other processes, including viral progression, cellular stress, nuclear shape, and cell cycle progression. We show that fibrillarin has an additional activity as a ribonuclease. The activity is affected by phosphoinositides and phosphatidic acid and insensitive to ribonuclease inhibitors. Furthermore, the presence of phosphatidic acid releases the fibrillarin-U3 snoRNA complex. We show that the ribonuclease activity localizes to the GAR (glycine/arginine-rich) domain conserved in a small group of RNA interacting proteins. The introduction of the GAR domain occurred in evolution in the transition from archaea to eukaryotic cells. The interaction of this domain with phospholipids may allow a phase separation of this protein in nucleoli.","Guillen-Chable, Francisco; Rodríguez Corona, Ulises; Pereira-Santana, Alejandro; Bayona, Andrea; Rodríguez-Zapata, Luis Carlos; Aquino, Cecilia; Šebestová, Lenka; Vitale, Nicolas; Hozak, Pavel; Castano, Enrique",Cells,462,22

This study aims to quantify aerosol and droplet generation from mandibular and midface open fixation and measure mitigation of airborne particles by a smoke evacuating electrocautery hand piece. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The soft tissue of the bilateral mandible and midface of two fresh frozen cadaveric specimens was infiltrated using a 0.1% fluorescein solution. Surgical fixation via oral vestibular approach was performed on each of these sites. Droplet splatter on the surgeon's chest, facemask, and up to 198.12 cm (6.5 ft) away from each surgical site was measured against a blue background under ultraviolet-A (UV-A) light. Aerosol generation was measured using an optical particle sizer. RESULTS: No visible droplet contamination was observed for any trials of mandible or midface fixation. Total aerosolized particle counts from 0.300–10.000 μm were increased compared to baseline following each use of standard electrocautery (n = 4, p < 0.001) but not with use of a suction evacuating electrocautery hand piece (n = 4, p = 0.103). Total particle counts were also increased during use of the powered drill (n = 8, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Risk from visible droplets during mandible and midface fixation is low. However, significant increases in aerosolized particles were measured after electrocautery use and during powered drilling. Aerosol dispersion is significantly decreased with the use of a smoke evacuating electrocautery hand piece.","Ye, Michael J.; Sharma, Dhruv; Campiti, Vincent J.; Rubel, Kolin E.; Burgin, Sarah J.; Illing, Elisa A.; Ting, Jonathan Y.; Park, Jae Hong; Johnson, Jeffrey D.; Vernon, Dominic J.; Lee, Hui Bae; Nesemeier, B.

Our goal was to identify risk factors associated with admission and disease severity in patients with SARS-CoV-2. DESIGN: This was an observational, retrospective study based on real-world data for 7,995 patients with SARS-CoV-2 from a clinical data repository. SETTING: Yale New Haven Health (YNHH) is a five-hospital academic health system serving a diverse patient population with community and teaching facilities in both urban and suburban areas. POPULATIONS: The study included adult patients who had SARS-CoV-2 testing at YNHH between March 1 and April 30, 2020. MAIN OUTCOME AND PERFORMANCE MEASURES: Primary outcomes were admission and in-hospital mortality for patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection as determined by RT-PCR testing. We also assessed features associated with the need for respiratory support. RESULTS: Of the 28605 patients tested for SARS-CoV-2, 7995 patients (27.9%) had an infection (median age 52.3 years) and 2154 (26.9%) of these had an associated admission (median age 66.2 years). Of admitted patients, 1633 (75.8%) had a discharge disposition at the end of the study period. Of these, 192 (11.8%) required invasive mechanical ventilation and 227 (13.5%) expired. Increased age and male sex were positively associated with admission and in-hospital mortality (median age 81.9 years), while comorbidities had a much weaker association with the risk of admission or mortality. Black race (OR 1.43, 95%CI 1.14–1.78) and Hispanic ethnicity (OR 1.81, 95%CI 1.50–2.18) were identified as risk factors for admission, but, among discharged patients, age-adjusted in-hospital mortality was not significantly different among racial and ethnic groups. CONCLUSIONS: This observational study identified, among people testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection, older age and male sex as the most strongly associated risks for admission and in-hospital mortality in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. While minority racial and ethnic groups had increased burden of disease and risk of admission, age-adjusted in-hospital mortality for discharged patients was not significantly different among racial and ethnic groups. Ongoing studies will be needed to continue to evaluate these risks, particularly in the setting of evolving treatment guidelines.","McPadden, Jacob; Warner, Frederick; Young, H.

The 60th anniversary of the local Ambulance Services is a good opportunity to provide an overview of the current trends in prehospital emergency medical care in Shanghai. OBJECTIVES: In this report, the features of Shanghai prehospital emergency medical care are described, as well as the Shanghai model of purely prehospital emergency medical care, including the communications and dispatch system, ambulance depots and ambulances, and prehospital rescue teams. Responses to major incidents including public health emergencies and natural disasters are also discussed, with the intention of highlighting future directions in emergency medical services, as well as the influence of international trends in emergency patient care. DISCUSSION: Although Shanghai has the most advanced dispatch system in China (equipped with a Global Positioning System, Global Information System, and more) and can be expanded quickly in case of mass casualty incidents, there is, as yet, no uniform Emergency Medical Service (EMS) dispatching for the entire city. Nor are there certifications, degrees, or special continuing education programs available for EMS dispatchers. Although there are more and more ambulance depots spread all over Shanghai, the city struggles with inadequate prehospital emergency caregivers, because every ambulance has to be staffed with a qualified Emergency Physician, and there are also recruitment problems for ambulance physicians.

We used cryo-electron microscopy and image processing to investigate conformational changes that occur in the entire spike of intact virions when they bind to the viral receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). We have shown that ACE2 binding results in structural changes that appear to be the initial step in viral membrane fusion, and precisely localized the receptor-binding and fusion core domains within the entire spike. Furthermore, our results show that receptor binding and subsequent membrane fusion are distinct steps, and that each spike can bind up to three ACE2 molecules.

However, most data available focus on health-related events after severe infection and hospitalisation. We present a longitudinal, prospective analysis of health consequences in patients who initially presented with no or minor symptoms of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Hence, we focus on mild COVID-19 in non-hospitalised patients. METHODS: 958 Patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were observed from April 6th to December 2nd 2020 for long-term symptoms and SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. We identified anosmia, ageusia, fatigue or shortness of breath as most common, persisting symptoms at month 4 and 7 and summarised presence of such long-term health consequences as post-COVID syndrome (PCS). Predictors of long-term symptoms were assessed using an uni- and multivariable logistic regression model. FINDINGS: We observed 442 and 353 patients over four and seven months after symptom onset, respectively. Four months post SARS-CoV-2 infection, 8•6% (38/442) of patients presented with shortness of breath, 12•4% (55/442) with anosmia, 11•1% (49/442) with ageusia and 9•7% (43/442) with fatigue. At least one of these characteristic symptoms was present in 27•8% (123/442) and 34•8% (123/353) at month 4 and 7 post-infection, respectively. A lower baseline level of SARS-CoV-2 IgG, anosmia and diarrhoea during acute COVID-19 were associated with higher risk to develop long-term symptoms. INTERPRETATION: The on-going presence of either shortness of breath, anosmia, ageusia or fatigue as long-lasting symptoms even in non-hospitalised patients was observed at four and seven months post-infection and summarised as post-COVID syndrome (PCS). The continued assessment of patients with PCS will become a major task to define and mitigate the socioeconomic and medical long-term effects of COVID-19.

METHODS: : We searched PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library as well as CNKI, Wanfang and VIP from 1 January 2020 to 31 July 2021. The dates of publication, language of publication, methodological characteristics and the key findings were analyzed separately. The data were presented by bar graphs, structured tables and figures. RESULTS: : In this scoping review, 16 research articles were included: 7 case reports, 6 observational studies, 1 review, 1 RCT and 1 nonrandomized clinical trial. The majority of the articles (81.3%) were published by Chinese scholars whereas 12.5% articles were from scholars in United States and 6.3% articles were from scholars in Iran. Included studies uncovered that acupuncture can alleviate the symptoms of COVID-19 patients, shorten the hospitalization days, and is effective for the elderly. There are no side effects reported. The most frequently acupoints were used are LI4, PC6, ST36 and KI3. Finally, there are many obstacles in implementing acupuncture therapy in treating COVID-19 patients.

In this study, pharmacokinetics and lung distribution of NFM, administered via intravenous and intratracheal routes, were determined using high performance liquid chromatography analysis of blood plasma, lung lumen using bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, and lung tissue. Intratracheal administration had higher drug delivery and longer residual time in the lung lumen and tissue, which are the main sites of action, than intravenous administration. We confirmed the effect of lecithin as a stabilizer through an ex vivo stability test. Lecithin acts as an inhibitor of carboxylesterase and delays NFM decomposition.

Furthermore, persons with obesity who become ill and require intensive care present challenges in patient management as it is more difficult to intubate these persond, and this is especially true in Saudi Arabia and the region of Hail, where morbid obesity is at 33.6% of the population. Our aim is to establish an epidimiological link for our population between diabetes, obesity and percentage of intubated patients as we measured mortalities and readmissions in 30 days. Methods: A retrospective cohort study of 751 patients admitted as positive COVID 19 patients, from April 1, 2020 to July 31, 2020, covering a period of 4 months. We then categorised the patient in cohorts accordind to the existence of CHF or not, and categorised them according to their BMI index. We then correlated using statistical tool analysis - SPSS statistics tool - intubation, mortality,readmitance in 30 days in thes groups of patients Results: Around 12% of our cases were CHF. 16% of these cases intubated, instead of 5% of non CHF cases.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of dysphonia, and its severity and extent, of voice fatigue and of dysphagia in non hospitalized patients affected by COVID-19 in Lombardy, the Italian region most hit by the first explosive outbreak of COVID-19 in Europe. METHODS: Demographic and clinical data of 160 consecutive patients, with COVID-19 diagnosis confirmed by nasal swabs processed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, were gathered by means of telephone interviews performed by physicians in charge of daily follow-up. General and specific symptoms concerning voice and swallowing impairment were investigated. Dysphonia grade and duration were graded on 4-point scales, while voice fatigue was graded on a 5-point scale. RESULTS: Dysphonia was reported by 70 (43.7%) patients and was positively associated with voice fatigue (P < 0.001), cough (P = 0.005), rhinitis (P = 0.01), and dyspnea (P = 0.06); it was mild and/or moderate in 69 patients, but its duration was > 2 weeks in 33/70 (47.1%) patients and >1 month in 11/70 (15.7%). Grade and duration of dysphonia were positively associated with cough and rhinitis (all P values < 0.01). Voice fatigue was reported by 43/160 patients (26.8%) and its severity was correlated with dysphonia (P < 0.0001), cough (P = 0.02), rhinitis (P = 0.02), dyspnea (P < 0.001), and loss of appetite (P = 0.01). Dysphagia was encountered in 27/160 patients (16.9%) and was associated with dysgeusia, cough, arthralgia, myalgia and loss of appetite but not with dysphonia. CONCLUSIONS: Dysphonia was a highly prevalent and long-lasting symptom in this series; it has been underestimated to date.

We aim to investigate the dynamic changes of peripheral blood lymphocytes subsets in adult patients with COVID-19. Methods Electronic medical records including demographics, clinical manifestation, comorbidities, laboratory data, and radiological materials of 435 hospitalized COVID-19 patients, with confirmed result of SARS-CoV-2 viral infection, were extracted and retrospectively analyzed. The counts of lymphocyte subsets at each week after the onset of the illness were compared with other weeks of illness and with those from normal individuals. Results The various lymphocyte subsets (CD3 +, CD4 +, CD8 +, CD19 +and CD16/56 +) were below the normal ranges at the first week after the onset of the illness, reaching a nadir during the second week, which increased gradually in the third week and returned to normal levels in the fifth week, but was still lower than the healthy controls. The CD3+, CD4+ and CD8+ counts were significantly lower in those with severe disease compared to those with non-severe disease, and in those patients that died compared to those who recovered. Discussion our research indicates that the levels of peripheral blood lymphocyte subsets (CD3 +, CD4 +, and CD8 +) are associated with disease progression, severity, and prognosis in patients with COVID-19. Dynamic monitoring of human immune function is one of the indicators for evaluating the severity and prognosis of COVID-19 patients, and it is helpful to formulate appropriate treatment strategies.","Deng, Zhifeng; Zhang, Minli; Zhu, Ting; Liu, Zhili; Liu, Zheming; Xiang, Rong; Zhang, Wei; Xu, Yu",Int J Infect Dis,462,20

However, the existing frameworks of data analysis are insufficient or inefficient to investigate the potential causality behind the associations involving multidimensional factors and complicated interrelationships. Thus, a causal inference framework equipped with the structural causal model aided by machine learning methods was proposed and applied to examine the potential causal relationships between COVID-19 severity and 10 environmental factors (NO2, O3, PM2.5, PM10, SO2, CO, average air temperature, atmospheric pressure, relative humidity, and wind speed) in 166 Chinese cities. The cities were grouped into three clusters based on the socio-economic features. Time-series data from these cities in each cluster were analyzed in different pandemic phases. The robustness check refuted most potential causal relationships' estimations (89 out of 90). Only one potential relationship about air temperature passed the final test with a causal effect of 0.041 under a specific cluster-phase condition. The results indicate that the environmental factors are unlikely to cause noticeable aggravation of the COVID-19 pandemic. This study also demonstrated the high value and potential of the proposed method in investigating causal problems with observational data in environmental or other fields.","Kang, Qiao; Song, Xing; Xin, Xiaying; Chen, Bing; Chen, Yuanzhu; Ye, Xudong; Zhang, Baiyu",Environ Sci Technol,462,23

Healthcare workers (HCWs) are at risk of COVID-19 because of their profession. There are limited studies conducted in Ethiopia among HCWs regarding their compliance with COVID-19 preventive measures. Therefore, this study intended to assess HCWs’ compliance with measures to prevent COVID-19, and its potential determinants in public hospitals in Western Ethiopia. METHODS: A self-administered, multicenter hospital-based cross-sectional survey was proposed to 422 randomly selected HCWs working in seven public hospitals in Western Ethiopia identified as COVID-19 referral centers. Data were entered into Epi Data version 3.1 and analyzed using SPSS version 24. Binary logistic regression was used to identify potential determinants of outcome variables at p-value < 0.05. RESULTS: Out of 422 completed questionnaires, the overall HCWs’ compliance with COVID-19 prevention is 22% (n = 404). In multivariate regression analysis, factors such as spending most of caring time at bedside (AOR = 1.94, 95%CI, 1.06–3.55), receiving training on infection prevention/COVID-19 (AOR = 1.86, 95%CI, 1.04–3.33), reading materials on COVID-19 (AOR = 2.04, 95%CI, 1.14–3.63) and having support from hospital management (AOR = 2.09, 95%CI, 1.20–3.64) were found to be significantly associated with COVID-19 preventive measures. Furthermore, inadequate supplies of appropriate personal protective equipment (83.2%), insufficient supportive medications (78.5%), and lack of provision of adequate ventilation (77.7%) were the barriers to COVID-19 prevention most frequently mentioned by participants. CONCLUSION: Our findings highlight HCWs’ poor compliance with COVID-19 preventive measures. Providing information and refreshing training to improve the level of healthcare workers’ adherence with COVID-19 prevention is as imperative as increasing staff commitment to supply resources necessary to protect HCWs and to reduce healthcare-associated infections transmission of SARS-COV-2.

Most use simple calculations that can be performed by hand. While several COVID-19 specific risk scores exist, they lack the ease of use of these simpler scores. The objectives of this study were (1) to design, validate, and calibrate a simple, easy-to-use mortality risk score for COVID-19 patients and (2) to recalibrate SOFA, qSOFA, and CURB-65 in a hospitalized COVID-19 population. Design: Retrospective cohort study incorporating demographic, clinical, laboratory, and admissions data from electronic health records. Setting: Multi-hospital health system in New York City. Five hospitals were included: one quaternary care facility, one tertiary care facility, and three community hospitals. Participants: Patients (n=4840) with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV2 infection who were admitted between March 1 and April 28, 2020. Main outcome measures: Gray's K-sample test for the cumulative incidence of a competing risk was used to assess and rank 48 different variables' associations with mortality. Candidate variables were added to the composite score using DeLong's test to evaluate their effect on predictive performance (AUC) of in-hospital mortality. Final AUCs for the new score, SOFA, qSOFA, and CURB-65 were assessed on an independent test set. Results: Of 48 variables investigated, 36 (75%) displayed significant (p<0.05 by Gray's test) associations with mortality. The variables selected for the final score were (1) oxygen support level, (2) troponin, (3) blood urea nitrogen, (4) lymphocyte percentage, (5) Glasgow Coma Score, and (6) age. The new score, COBALT, outperforms SOFA, qSOFA, and CURB-65 at predicting mortality in this COVID-19 population: AUCs for initial, maximum, and mean COBALT scores were 0.81, 0.91, and 0.92, compared to 0.77, 0.87, and 0.87 for SOFA. We provide COVID-19 specific mortality estimates at all score levels for COBALT, SOFA, qSOFA, and CURB-65. Conclusions: The COBALT score provides a simple way to estimate mortality risk in hospitalized COVID-19 patients with superior performance to SOFA and other scores currently in widespread use. Evaluation of SOFA, qSOFA, and CURB-65 in this population highlights the importance of recalibrating mortality risk scores when they are used under novel conditions, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. This study's approach to score design could also be applied in other contexts to create simple, practical and high-performing mortality risk scores.","Yoo, E.; Percha, B.; Tomlinson, M.; Razuk, V.; Pan, S.; Basist, M.; Tandon, P.; Wang, J.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association between patient sociodemographics and neighborhood disadvantage with frequencies of death, invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), and intensive care unit (ICU) admission in patients hospitalized with COVID-19. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Four hospitals in an integrated health system serving southeast Michigan. PARTICIPANTS: Adult patients admitted to the hospital with a COVID-19 diagnosis confirmed by polymerase chain reaction. MAIN MEASURES: Patient sociodemographics, comorbidities, and clinical outcomes were collected. Neighborhood socioeconomic variables were obtained at the census tract level from the 2018 American Community Survey. Relationships between neighborhood median income and clinical outcomes were evaluated using multivariate logistic regression models, controlling for patient age, sex, race, Charlson Comorbidity Index, obesity, smoking status, and living environment. KEY RESULTS: Black patients lived in significantly poorer neighborhoods than White patients (median income: $34,758 (24,531–56,095) vs. $63,317 (49,850–85,776), p < 0.001) and were more likely to have Medicaid insurance (19.4% vs. 11.2%, p < 0.001). Patients from neighborhoods with lower median income were significantly more likely to require IMV (lowest quartile: 25.4%, highest quartile: 16.0%, p < 0.001) and ICU admission (35.2%, 19.9%, p < 0.001). After adjusting for age, sex, race, and comorbidities, higher neighborhood income ($10,000 increase) remained a significant negative predictor for IMV (OR: 0.95 (95% CI 0.91, 0.99), p = 0.02) and ICU admission (OR: 0.92 (95% CI 0.89, 0.96), p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Neighborhood disadvantage, which is closely associated with race, is a predictor of poor clinical outcomes in COVID-19.

Therefore, conserved amino acids located on a protein surface may be successfully targeted by antibodies. The quantitative deep mutational scanning approach is an excellent technique to understand viral evolution, and the obtained data can be utilized to develop a vaccine. However, the application of the approach to all of the proteins in general is difficult in terms of cost. To address this need, we report the construction of a deep neural network-based program for sequence-based prediction of supersecondary structure codes (SSSCs), called SSSCPrediction (SSSCPred). Further, to predict conformational flexibility or rigidity in proteins, a comparison program called SSSCPreds that consists of three deep neural network-based prediction systems (SSSCPred, SSSCPred100, and SSSCPred200) has also been developed. Using our algorithms we calculated here shows the degree of flexibility for the receptor-binding motif of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and the rigidity of the unique motif (SSSC: SSSHSSHHHH) at the S2 subunit and has a value independent of the X-ray and Cryo-EM structures. The fact that the sequence flexibility/rigidity map of SARS-CoV-2 RBD resembles the sequence-to-phenotype maps of ACE2-binding affinity and expression, which were experimentally obtained by deep mutational scanning, suggests that the identical SSSC sequences among the ones predicted by three deep neural network-based systems correlate well with the sequences with both lower ACE2-binding affinity and lower expression. The combined analysis of predicted and observed SSSCs with keyword-tagged datasets would be helpful in understanding the structural correlation to the examined system.","Izumi, Hiroshi; Nafie, Laurence A.; Dukor, Rina K.",ACS Omega,462,16

These circumstances affect the length of stay (LOS) or degree of crowding in the ED. The processes for patients with acute critical illness, such as cerebrovascular disease (CVD), can be also delayed. Using the process mining (PM) method, this study aimed to evaluate LOS, ED processes for CVD, and delayed processes during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. (2) Methods: Data were collected from the Clinical Data Warehouse of a medical center. Phase 1 included patients who visited the ED before the COVID-19 outbreak. In Phase 2, post-COVID-19 ED patients were divided into the COVID-19 tested group (CTG) and COVID-19 not tested group (CNTG) according to whether polymerase chain reaction test was performed. We analyzed patients’ ED processes before and after COVID-19 using the PM method. We analyzed patients with acute CVD separately to determine whether the process and LOS of patients with acute critical illness were changed or delayed. (3) Results: After the COVID-19 outbreak, the overall LOS was delayed and all processes in CTG patients were delayed. Registration to triage and triage were delayed in both CTG and CNTG patients. The brain imaging process for CTG patients with acute CVD was also delayed. (4) Conclusion: After a pandemic, some processes were changed, new processes were developed, and processes for patients with acute CVD who needed proper time management were not exempted.","Chang, Hansol; Yu, Jae Yong; Yoon, Sun Young; Hwang, Sung Yeon; Yoon, Hee; Cha, Won Chul; Sim, Min Seob; Jo, Ik Joon; Kim, Taerim",J Clin Med,462,20

In the literature, much attention is paid to the influence of coffee on human health, especially daily intake of caffeine, and also purchasing consumer behavior. There is a lack of research devoted to consumer choices and habits in relation to coffee consumption and brewing method. Therefore, the aim of this study is to describe the characteristics of coffee consumers and present their segmentation based on consumer choices and habits towards coffee consumption. The study was performed using the computer-assisted web interviewing (CAWI) method on a group of 1500 adults respondents in Poland reporting the consumption of coffee. We collected information about consumer choices and habits related to coffee consumption, including brewing method, place of consuming coffee, and factors determining coffee choices. Using cluster analysis, we identified three main groups of coffee consumers. There are “Neutral coffee drinkers”, “Ad hoc coffee drinkers”, and “Non-specific coffee drinkers”. The respondents in the study are not coffee gourmets; they like and consume coffee, but these are often changing choices. To conclude, it can be stated that the Polish coffee consumer prefers conventional methods of brewing coffee (like a “traditionalist”) but is open to novelties and new sensory experiences. Based on study results it is possible to know the coffee drinking habits in Poland.","Czarniecka-Skubina, Ewa; Pielak, Marlena; Sałek, Piotr; Korzeniowska-Ginter, Renata; Owczarek, Tomasz",Int J Environ Res Public Health,462,16

However, few studies have explored how stress response styles, like psychological resilience and rumination, might alter these relationships. Using validated tools, perceived stress, anxiety, stress response styles, and sleep behaviors of undergraduate and graduate students from seven countries during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic were characterized in order to examine the relationships between these factors using mediation and moderation analyses. Students enrolled in universities in China, Ireland, Malaysia, Taiwan, South Korea, the Netherlands, and the United States were recruited in May 2020. A total of 2254 students completed this cross-sectional study. Perceived stress and anxiety were negatively associated with sleep quality through the mediation of rumination. Increased psychological resilience weakened the relationships between perceived stress and anxiety on sleep quality. The majority of students reported that COVID-19 negatively influenced their mental health and sleep quality but not sleep duration. Based on these results, university students would likely benefit from sleep education and mental health promotion programs that include trainings to increase psychological resilience and reduce rumination, particularly during times of increased stress.","Du, Chen; Zan, Megan Chong Hueh; Cho, Min Jung; Fenton, Jenifer I.; Hsiao, Pao Ying; Hsiao, Richard; Keaver, Laura; Lai, Chang-Chi; Lee, HeeSoon; Ludy, Mary-Jon; Shen, Wan; Swee, Winnie Chee Siew; Thrivikraman, Jyothi; Tseng, Kuo-Wei; Tseng, Wei-Chin; Tucker, Robin M.",Clocks Sleep,462,1

The aim of this study was to determine the effects of EGF on atrophic enteritis induced in piglets by experimental infection with porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus (PEDV) strain Dr13. Two groups of 12 conventional, colostrum-deprived, 1-day-old, large White-Duroc cross breed piglets were inoculated orally with PEDV (3 × 10(5) 50% tissue culture infective doses), with or without EGF (10 μg/kg/day, intraperitoneally once daily for 4 days after infection) and compared to 12 uninfected, untreated control piglets. PEDV + EGF piglets had less severe clinical signs than PEDV only piglets at 48 and 60 h post-infection (hpi). Histologically, the ratio of villous height:crypt depth of PEDV + EGF piglets was significantly higher than PEDV only piglets at 36 and 48 hpi. Immunohistochemistry for Ki67 demonstrated increased proliferation in intestinal crypt epithelial cells of PEDV + EGF piglets compared to PEDV only piglets at 36, 48 and 60 hpi.

Systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) associated with bacterial infection is a hallmark of sepsis. Sepsis in neonatal foals is a common sequela of failure of passive transfer and, in addition to development of SIRS, may be characterised by bacteraemia, pneumonia, enterocolitis, omphalophlebitis, meningoencephalitis or arthritis. Sepsis in mature horses is most commonly observed secondary to gastrointestinal lesions that result in disrupted mucosa and bacterial translocation into circulation (endotoxaemia). Pleuropneumonia and metritis may also cause sepsis in mature horses. Diagnosis of sepsis is based on SIRS criteria as well as suspected or confirmed infection. Due to the relatively low sensitivity of microbial culture and the subjectivity of sepsis scoring, many sepsis biomarkers are being studied for their usefulness in diagnosis and prognostication of sepsis in horses. Treatment of sepsis requires an intensive care approach that includes antimicrobial drug administration, fluid resuscitation and pressure support, and treatment for inflammation, endotoxaemia and coagulopathy. Early recognition of sepsis and prompt antimicrobial drug treatment are critical for a successful outcome. Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome may occur in severe cases of sepsis, with common manifestations including laminitis and coagulopathies. Although prognosis for septic mature horses depends highly on the primary disease process, the overall survival rate in septic neonatal foals ranges from 26 to 86%, with most studies indicating a survival rate of 45–60%.","Taylor, S.",Equine Vet Educ,462,20

In spite of its clinical relevance and impact on feline health, currently the therapeutic possibilities for treatment of FIP in cats are limited. The emergence of the pandemic Severe Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (CoV) type 2 (SARS-CoV-2), etiological agent of the 2019 Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19), able to infect a broad spectrum of animal species including cats, triggered the interest for the development of novel molecules with antiviral activity for treatment of CoV infections in humans and animals. Essential oils (EOs) have raised significant attention for their antiviral properties integrating and, in some cases, replacing conventional drugs. Thymus vulgaris EO (TEO) has been previously shown to be effective against several RNA viruses including CoVs. In the present study the antiviral efficacy of TEO against FIPV was evaluated in vitro. TEO at 27 μg/ml was able to inhibit virus replication with a significant reduction of 2 log10 TCID(50)/50 μl. Moreover, virucidal activity was tested using TEO at 27 and 270 μg/ml, over the cytotoxic threshold, determining a reduction of viral titre as high as 3.25 log10 TCID(50)/50 μl up to 1 h of time contact. These results open several perspectives in terms of future applications and therapeutic possibilities for coronaviruses considering that FIPV infection in cats could be a potential model for the study of antivirals against CoVs.","Catella, Cristiana; Camero, Michele; Lucente, Maria Stella; Fracchiolla, Giuseppe; Sblano, Sabina; Tempesta, Maria; Martella, Vito; Buonavoglia, Canio; Lanave, Gianvito",Res Vet Sci,462,24

However, there is a dearth of data investigating the impact of age on the risk reported with male sex. We aimed to determine the risk associated with male sex in people of different age groups, that is, in people younger or older than 65 years of age. Methods This is a retrospective cohort study that included 370 adult patients hospitalized with COVID-19 between March 12, 2020, and May 13, 2020, at a 242-bed teaching community hospital in the New York City metropolitan region. Patients were classified into younger (age<65 years, n=132) and older individuals (age>=65, n=238). We calculated odds ratios for poor outcomes in men compared to women separately in these two groups. Results Among older individuals, there was no difference in the odds of poor outcomes between men and women. In contrast, among younger people, men had higher odds of severe pneumonia, need for high oxygen support, acute kidney injury and acute liver injury when compared to women. Conclusions Among people older than 65 years, sex did not impact disease severity and outcomes in COVID-19. Thus, older women were equally likely to have severe COVID-19 when compared to age-matched men. In contrast, among younger middle-aged adults (29-64 years), men had higher odds of end-organ damage from COVID-19 compared to women. Based on these observations, age is a more important driver of poor outcomes in COVID-19 than sex. Public health policies need to create awareness for the increased risk of older individuals to COVID-19, regardless of sex.","Naaraayan, Ashutossh; Nimkar, Abhishek; Hasan, Amrah; Pant, Sushil; Durdevic, Momcilo; Elenius, Henrik; Nava Suarez, Corina; Jesmajian, Stephen",Cureus,462,1

The COVID-19 pandemic has perturbed the functioning of healthcare systems around the world and led to changes in elective surgical care, with bariatric procedures being postponed until the end of pandemic. There is no data in the literature about the effect of a new epidemiological situation on bariatric patients. Methods: The study was designed as an online survey containing multiple open questions about bariatric care during the COVID-19 pandemic. The survey was conducted among pre- and postoperative bariatric patients. Results: Out of 800 respondents, 74.53% felt anxiety about their health in regard to the present epidemiologic state. Some (72.25%) were aware of the fact that obesity was an important risk factor that could impair the course of the COVID-19 disease. Almost 30% of respondents admitted having put on weight, significantly more in the group of preoperative patients (43.8% vs. 22.69%; p < 0.001). Only 20.92% of patients had a possibility of continuing direct bariatric care; 67.3% of patients had an opportunity of remote contact with a bariatric specialist, including online consultations, teleconsultations and social media meetings. Conclusions: Limited access to medical care and quarantine lockdown may result in a deterioration of long-time operation outcomes and lower weight losses. Patients should be encouraged to profit from online consultations with specialists and telemedicine to reduce the negative effects of the pandemic on their health.","Walędziak, Maciej; Różańska-Walędziak, Anna; Pędziwiatr, Michał; Szeliga, Jacek; Proczko-Stepaniak, Monika; Wysocki, Michał; Stefura, Tomasz; Major, Piotr",J Clin Med,462,3

DESIGN: A prospective, observational study using a self-designed questionnaire. SETTING: Three general practitioners’ (GP) offices in rural Germany. PARTICIPANTS: 271 adult patients without manifest cardiovascular or pulmonary disease with (n = 82) and without (n = 189) hypertension reporting to our GP offices. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The reported increase of depressive symptoms (loneliness, sleeplessness, joylessness, listlessness) prior to the first documented case in Germany on 27.01.2020 (t(0)) as opposed to patients’ health perception during the Corona pandemic (t(1)) was the primary outcome measure. The secondary outcome measures were changes in physical activity (PA), dyspnea and angina in the two groups. RESULTS: Out of 271 patients (50.8 ± 16.8 years, 55.1% females), 1.5% were tested positive for COVID-19. Overall, listlessness (8.5%, p = 0.001), sleeplessness (5.2%, p = 0.001) and joylessness (4.2%, p = 0.003) were increased. Dyspnea significantly increased (9.2%, p < 0.001) and employment status worsened (6.5%, p < 0.001). There were significant associations between the increase of depressive symptoms, weight increase (p = 0.017), and reduction in physical activity (p = 0.046).

CAP-associated main pathogens in adults include viruses as well as bacteria. However, large-scale epidemiological investigations of adult viral CAP in China are still lacking. In this study, we analyzed the etiology of adult CAP in Beijing, China and constructed diagnostic models based on combinations of patient clinical factors. METHODS: A multicenter cohort was established with 500 adult CAP outpatients enrolled in Beijing between November 2010 to October 2011. Multiplex and quantitative real-time fluorescence PCR were used to detect 15 respiratory viruses and mycoplasma pneumoniae, respectively. Bacteria were detected with culture and enzyme immunoassay of the Streptococcus pneumoniae urinary antigen. Univariate analysis, multivariate analysis, discriminatory analysis and Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves were used to build predictive models for etiological diagnosis of adult CAP. RESULTS: Pathogens were detected in 54.2% (271/500) of study patients. Viruses accounted for 36.4% (182/500), mycoplasma pneumoniae for 18.0% (90/500) and bacteria for 14.4% (72/500) of the cases. In 182 of the patients with viruses, 219 virus strains were detected, including 166 single and 53 mixed viral infections. Influenza A virus represented the greatest proportion with 42.0% (92/219) and 9.1% (20/219) in single and mixed viral infections, respectively. Factors selected for the predictive etiological diagnostic model of viral CAP included cough, dyspnea, absence of chest pain and white blood cell count (4.0-10.0) × 10(9)/L, and those of mycoplasma pneumoniae CAP were being younger than 45 years old and the absence of a coexisting disease. However, these models showed low accuracy levels for etiological diagnosis (areas under ROC curve for virus and mycoplasma pneumoniae were both 0.61, P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Greater consideration should be given to viral and mycoplasma pneumoniae infections in adult CAP outpatients. While predictive etiological diagnostic models of viral and mycoplasma pneumoniae based on combinations of demographic and clinical factors may provide indications of etiology, diagnostic confirmation of CAP remains dependent on laboratory pathogen test results.","Liu, Ya-Fen; Gao, Yan; Chen, Mei-Fang; Cao, Bin; Yang, Xiao-Hua; Wei, Lai",BMC Infect Dis,462,24

It has also been found to hamper SARS-CoV-2 replication in vitro, and its precise mechanism of action against SARS-CoV-2 is yet to be understood. IVM is known to interact with host importin (IMP)α directly and averts interaction with IMPβ1, leading to the prevention of nuclear localization signal (NLS) recognition. Therefore, the current study seeks to employ molecular docking, molecular mechanics generalized Born surface area (MM-GBSA) analysis and molecular dynamics simulation studies for decrypting the binding mode, key interacting residues as well as mechanistic insights on IVM interaction with 15 potential drug targets associated with COVID-19 as well as IMPα. Among all COVID-19 targets, the non-structural protein 9 (Nsp9) exhibited the strongest affinity to IVM showing −5.30 kcal/mol and −84.85 kcal/mol binding energies estimated by AutoDock Vina and MM-GBSA, respectively. However, moderate affinity was accounted for IMPα amounting −6.9 kcal/mol and −66.04 kcal/mol. Stability of the protein-ligand complexes of Nsp9-IVM and IMPα-IVM was ascertained by 100 ns trajectory of all-atom molecular dynamics simulation. Structural conformation of protein in complex with docked IVM exhibited stable root mean square deviation while root mean square fluctuations were also found to be consistent. In silico exploration of the potential targets and their interaction profile with IVM can assist experimental studies as well as designing of COVID-19 drugs. Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

The underlying mechanisms of SARS are still largely undefined. Long pentraxin PTX3, a humoral mediator of innate immunity, has been reported to have anti-viral effects. We examined the role of PTX3 in Coronavirus murine hepatitis virus strain 1 (MHV-1)-induced acute lung injury, a previously reported animal model for SARS. PTX3 deficient mice (129/SvEv/C57BL6/J) and their wild type littermates were intranasally infected MHV-1. These mice were also treated with recombinant PTX3. Effects of PTX3 on viral binding and infectivity were determined in vitro. Cytokine expression, severity of lung injury, leukocyte infiltration and inflammatory responses were examined in vivo. In PTX3wild type mice, MHV -1 induced PTX3 expression in the lung and serum in a time dependent manner. MHV-1 infection led to acute lung injury with greater severity in PTX3 deficient mice than that in wild type mice. PTX3 deficiency enhanced early infiltration of neutrophils and macrophages in the lung. PTX3 bound to MHV-1 and MHV-3 and reduced MHV-1 infectivity in vitro. Administration of recombinant PTX3 significantly accelerated viral clearance in the lung; attenuated MHV-1 induced lung injury, and reduced early neutrophil influx and elevation of inflammatory mediators in the lung. Results from this study indicate a protective role of PTX3 in coronaviral infection -induced acute lung injury.","Han, Bing; Ma, Xuezhong; Zhang, Jianhua; Zhang, Yu; Bai, Xiaohui; Hwang, David M.; Keshavjee, Shaf; Levy, Gary; McGilvray, Ian; Liu, Mingyao",Lab Invest,462,0

However, evidence on how pandemic-related risk factors contribute to changes in these outcomes is lacking. Aims We sought to examine how different adverse experiences and worries about adversity brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic contribute to changes in self-harm thoughts and behaviours over the first 45 weeks of the pandemic. Method Data from 48,446 UK adults in the UCL COVID-19 Social Study were analysed across the first 45 weeks (1 April to 7 February 2021) of the pandemic. Fixed effects regressions explored associations between weekly within-person variation in five categories of adversity experiences and adversity worries with changes in self-harm thoughts and behaviours across age groups (18-29, 30-44, 45-59, and 60+ years). Results More adverse experiences were more strongly related to outcomes than worries. Specific categories of worries and adversities had stronger associations with outcomes than others. The largest contributing factor to increases in both self-harm thoughts (odds ratio (OR) range = 3.38 to 4.00) and behaviours (OR range = 3.72 to 6.82) was physical or psychological abuse amongst all ages. Having had COVID-19 and financial worries were associated with increased likelihood of both outcomes, the latter being more consistently associated with outcomes than actual financial adversity. Conclusions These findings suggest that a significant portion of UK adults may be at increased risk for self-harm thoughts and behaviours during the pandemic, which is concerning given the link between self-harm and suicide. Policies currently place to protect and reassure citizens may be insufficient in assuaging fears and anxieties. Given the likelihood that as time goes on, the economic and social consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic will accumulate, policy makers can begin adapting a variety of existing evidence-based suicide prevention strategies and other social policies to help mitigate its consequences.","Paul, E.; Fancourt, D.",,462,26

METHODS: This is a multicenter randomized double blinded randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial. Participants were recruited from three hospitals that are affiliated to [Institution Blinded for Review], and [Institution Blinded for Review]. RESULTS: A total 106 hospitalized patients who had a circulating concentration of 25(OH)D <30 ng/ml were enrolled in this study. Within 30 and 60 days 79.4% (26 out of 34) and 100% (24 out of 24) of the patients who received 25(OH)D(3) became sufficient whereas ≤12.5% the patients in the placebo group became sufficient during 2 months follow-up. We observed an overall lower trend for hospitalization, ICU duration, needing ventilator assistance and mortality in the 25(OH)D3 group compared with placebo group but they weren’t statistically significant. Treatment with oral 25(OH)D(3) was associated with a significant increase in the lymphocyte percentage and decrease in the ratio of neutrophils to lymphocytes (NLR) in the patients. The lower NLR was significant associated with reduced ICU admission days and mortality. CONCLUSION: Our analysis indicated that oral 25-hydroxyvitamin D(3) was able to correct vitamin D deficiency/insufficiency in COVID-19 patients that resulted in improved immune function by increasing blood lymphocyte percentage. RCTs with a larger sample size and with higher dose of 25(OH)D3 maybe needed to confirm the potential effect of 25(OH)D3 on reducing clinical outcomes in COVID-19 patients.

RT-qPCR is the “gold-standard” method to sensitively detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA, but most laboratory-developed RT-qPCR assays involve complex steps. Here, we aimed to simplify RT-qPCR assays by streamlining reaction setup, eliminating RNA extraction, and proposing reduced-cost detection workflows that avoid the need for expensive qPCR instruments. METHOD: A low-cost RT-PCR based “kit” was developed for faster turnaround than the CDC developed protocol. We demonstrated three detection workflows: two that can be deployed in laboratories conducting assays of variable complexity, and one that could be simple enough for point-of-care. Analytical sensitivity was assessed using SARS-CoV-2 RNA spiked in simulated nasal matrix. Clinical performance was evaluated using contrived human nasal matrix (n = 41) and clinical nasal specimens collected from individuals with respiratory symptoms (n = 110). FINDING: The analytical sensitivity of the lyophilised RT-PCR was 10 copies/reaction using purified SARS-CoV-2 RNA, and 20 copies/reaction when using direct lysate in simulated nasal matrix. Evaluation of assay performance on contrived human matrix showed 96.7–100% specificity and 100% sensitivity at ≥20 RNA copies. A head-to-head comparison with the standard CDC protocol on clinical specimens showed 83.8–94.6% sensitivity and 96.8–100% specificity. We found 3.6% indeterminate samples (undetected human control), lower than 8.1% with the standard protocol. INTERPRETATION: This preliminary work should support laboratories or commercial entities to develop and expand access to Covid-19 testing. Software guidance development for this assay is ongoing to enable implementation in other settings.

However, the change in work culture would also increase the chances of the cybersecurity attack, MAC spoofing attack, and DDoS/DoS attack due to the divergent incoming traffic from the untrusted network for accessing the enterprise’s resources. Networks are usually unable to detect spoofing if the intruder already forges the host’s MAC address. However, the techniques used in the existing researches﻿ mistakenly classify the malicious host as the legitimate one. This paper proposes a novel access control policy based on a zero-trust network by explicitly restricting the incoming network traffic to substantiate MAC spoofing attacks in the software-defined network (SDN) paradigm of cloud computing. The multiplicative increase and additive decrease algorithm helps to detect the advanced MAC spoofing attack before penetrating the SDN-based cloud resources. Based on the proposed approach, a dynamic threshold is assigned to the incoming port number. The self-learning feature of the threshold stamping helps to rectify a legitimate user’s traffic before classifying it to the attacker. Finally, the mathematical and experimental results exhibit high accuracy and detection rate than the existing methodologies. The novelty of this approach strengthens the security of the SDN paradigm of cloud resources by redefining conventional access control policy.","Mandal, Sudakshina; Khan, Danish Ali; Jain, Sarika",New Gener Comput,462,5

Recently published reviews on SARS-CoV-2 have mainly focused on its structure, development of the outbreak, relevant precautions, management trials and available therapies. However, in this review, we aim to explore the history, evolution of all coronaviruses and the associated viral outbreaks along with the diagnostics for COVID-19 in the twenty-first century. MAIN BODY: We have focused on different RNA viruses’ viz. SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2, their classification, and the various disease outbreaks caused by them. In the subsequent section, the comparison of different RNA viruses affecting humans has been made based on the viral genome, structure, time of the outbreak, mode of spread, virulence, causative agents, and transmission. Due to the current mayhem caused by the rapidly emerging virus, special attention is given to SARS-CoV-2, its genome updates, and infectivity. Finally, the current diagnostic techniques such as nucleic acid testing (real time-polymerase chain reaction and loop-mediated isothermal amplification), CRISPR-based diagnostics (CRISPR based DETECTR assay, CRISPR based SHERLOCK test, AIOD-CRISPR, FELUDA, CREST), chest radiographs (computed tomography, X-ray), and serological tests (Lateral flow assay, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, chemiluminescent immunoassay, neutralization assay, nano-sensors, blood test, viral sequencing) with their pros and cons, and future diagnostic prospective have been described.

Since the Atangana–Baleanu fractional derivative gives better precise results to the derivative with exponential kernel because of having fractional order, hence, it is a generalized form of the derivative with exponential kernel. The numerical simulations are explored for various values of the fractional order. Finally, the effect of the ABC fractional-order derivative on suspected and infected individuals carefully is examined and compared with the real data.","Akyildiz, F.

The patients and staff in the hospitals faced mental health challenges. This paper reports the experiences and mental health needs from them. METHOD: Following the qualitative design, semi-structured interviews were conducted in the EastWest Lake Fangcang Shelter Hospital, Wuhan on March 2020. Data collection and analysis was based on grounded theory. Open coding was adapted and a structured codebook was developed through coding seminars. The themes and subthemes were then confirmed through thematic analysis. The findings were further explained and integrated in a theoretical framework. RESULTS: A total of 10 COVID-19 patients and 13 staff, including doctors, nurses, psychiatrists, and policemen participated in the interviews. They have common needs, as well as their own needs. The perspectives from the staff also did complement for needs of the patients. The mental health needs were generalized into four themes, that is, basic needs, information and communication, emotional needs, and social support, each with several subthemes. In addition, there were some external factors that regulated the internal needs, which were summarized in a theoretical framework. CONCLUSIONS: The study indicates the directions on hospital management, mental health services, policy making, and social work to meet the mental health needs of the inpatients and staff from temporary shelter hospitals like Fangcang in Wuhan during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Lu, Jing; Zhao, Min; Wu, Qianying; Ma, Chenyi; Du, Xiangdong; Lu, Xinchuan; Jia, Qiufang; Li, Chuanwei",Glob Ment Health (Camb),462,27

However, earlier research focused only on a subset of variable groups (predominantly one or two) that can contribute to the COVID-19 transmission/mortality rate. The current study effort is designed to remedy this by analyzing COVID-19 transmission/mortality rates considering a comprehensive set of factors in a unified framework. Method: We study two per capita dependent variables: (1) daily COVID-19 transmission rates and (2) total COVID-19 mortality rates. The first variable is modeled using a linear mixed model while the later dimension is analyzed using a linear regression approach. The model results are augmented with a sensitivity analysis to predict the impact of mobility restrictions at a county level. Findings: Several county level factors including proportion of African-Americans, income inequality, health indicators associated with Asthma, Cancer, HIV and heart disease, percentage of stay at home individuals, testing infrastructure and Intensive Care Unit capacity impact transmission and/or mortality rates. From the policy analysis, we find that enforcing a stay at home order that can ensure a 50% stay at home rate can result in a potential reduction of about 30% in daily cases. Interpretation: The model framework developed can be employed by government agencies to evaluate the influence of reduced mobility on transmission rates at a county level while accommodating for various county specific factors. Based on our policy analysis, the study findings support a county level stay at home order for regions currently experiencing a surge in transmission. The model framework can also be employed to identify vulnerable counties that need to be prioritized based on health indicators for current support and/or preferential vaccination plans (when available).

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A qualitative study of 556 blog posts submitted between January 1, 2007 and December 31, 2017 to 4 diabetes social networking sites was conducted between March 2018 and July 2019. All posts were coded inductively using thematic analysis procedures. Eton’s Burden of Treatment Framework and Boehmer’s Theory of Patient Capacity directed triangulation of themes with existing theory. RESULTS: Three themes were identified: (1) cost barriers to care: participants describe individual and systemic cost barriers that inhibit prescribed therapy goals; (2) impact of financial cost on health: participants describe the financial effects of care on their physical and emotional health; and (3) saving strategies to overcome cost impact: participants discuss practical strategies that help them achieve therapy goals. Finally, we also identify that the use of OHCs serves to increase persons’ capacity with the potential to decrease treatment burden, ultimately improving mental and physical health. CONCLUSION: High cost for diabetes care generated barriers that negatively affected physical health and emotional states. Participant-shared experiences in OHCs increased participants’ capacity to manage the burden. Potential solutions include cost-based shared decision-making tools and advocacy for policy change.","Gao, Catherine C.; Espinoza Suarez, Nataly R.; Toloza, Freddy J.K.; Malaga Zuniga, Ariana S.; McCarthy, Sarah R.; Boehmer, Kasey R.; Yao, Lixia; Fu, Sunyang; Brito, Juan P.",Mayo Clin Proc Innov Qual Outcomes,462,2

Objective: To examine the association between lockdown amid COVID-19 pandemic and the rate of cognitive decline among patients with dementia and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional observational study on patients with dementia and MCI who attended the outpatient clinic at Ibn Sina Hospital, the main tertiary neurology center in Kuwait, during the month of September 2020. The rate of cognitive decline, estimated by MMSE scores, was compared between the period prior to, and during lockdown. Results: We evaluated 36 consecutive patients with cognitive impairment (23 females [63.9%], mean age 71 ± 10.8 years, mean disease duration 34.6 ± 29 months). Eleven patients (30.6%) progressed to a more severe stage during the study period; 1 MCI (2.8%) converted to mild dementia, 6 (16.6%) mild to moderate, and 4 (11.1%) moderate to severe dementia. Monthly decline of MMSE scores before lockdown was 0.2 ± 0.1 points, while it was 0.53 ± 0.3 points during lockdown, which was statistically significant (p = .001). The most affected cognitive domain was the memory with a mean decline of 1.5 ± 0.8 points. Conclusions: This study provides “real-world” data suggesting rapid cognitive decline in patients with dementia during the lockdown period.

Radiation hormesis is the most thoroughly investigated among all hormesis-like phenomena, in particular in biogerontology. In this review, we aimed to summarize research evidence supporting hormesis through exposure to low-dose ionizing radiation (LDIR). Radiation-induced longevity hormesis has been repeatedly reported in invertebrate models such as C. elegans, Drosophila and flour beetles and in vertebrate models including guinea pigs, mice and rabbits. On the contrary, suppressing natural background radiation was repeatedly found to cause detrimental effects in protozoa, bacteria and flies. We also discussed here the possibility of clinical use of LDIR, predominantly for age-related disorders, e.g., Alzheimer’s disease, for which no remedies are available. There is accumulating evidence that LDIR, such as those commonly used in X-ray imaging including computer tomography, might act as a hormetin. Of course, caution should be exercised when introducing new medical practices, and LDIR therapy is no exception. However, due to the low average residual life expectancy in old patients, the short-term benefits of such interventions (e.g., potential therapeutic effect against dementia) may outweigh their hypothetical delayed risks (e.g., cancer). We argue here that assessment and clinical trials of LDIR treatments should be given priority bearing in mind the enormous economic, social and ethical implications of potentially-treatable, age-related disorders.","Vaiserman, Alexander; Cuttler, Jerry M.; Socol, Yehoshua",Biogerontology,462,26

However, to our knowledge no studies have covered the clinical course of patients with moderate-type COVID-19. This study describes the clinical course of moderate-type patients with COVID-19 from Wuhan City and Yiyang City, and explores factors relevant to the length of hospitalization and symptoms relief. Methods: The study analyzed the clinical course of 107 moderate-type patients with COVID-19 from the outbreak area (Wuhan) and the imported area (Yiyang), and used automatic linear modeling and multivariate linear regression analysis to explore the factors relevant to the length of hospitalization and symptoms relief. Furthermore, we created a scoring system to value the length of hospitalization and symptoms relief. Results: Lymphopenia, elevated C-reactive protein, increased LDH, bilateral lung GGO (ground glass opacity), and lung consolidation were more likely to appear in ordinary inpatients with moderate-type COVID-19 from Wuhan (P < 0.05), compared to infected medical staff from Wuhan and ordinary inpatients with moderate-type COVID-19 from Yiyang. Meanwhile, the length of hospitalization and symptoms relief was longer in ordinary patients with moderate-type COVID-19 from Wuhan (P < 0.05). Onset of symptoms to admission, ESR, leucocytes count, and bilateral lung GGO were linearly related to the length of hospitalization (P < 0.05); onset of symptoms to admission, leucocytes count, bilateral lung GGO, and lung consolidation were linearly related to the length of symptoms relief (P < 0.05). By using the scoring system, we found that the time of hospitalization and symptoms relief lengthened as the scores increased. Conclusions: This study described the clinical course of patients with moderate-type COVID-19, and found that ordinary patients with moderate-type COVID-19 in outbreak areas were more serious and needed stronger treatment and longer treatment time. Onset of symptoms to admission, ESR, leucocytes count, and bilateral lung GGO can be effective predictors of the length of hospitalization. And onset of symptoms to admission, leucocytes count, bilateral lung GGO, and lung consolidation can be effective predictors of the amount of time until symptoms relief.

METHODS: An IRB approved retrospective study of CTA of the chest, abdomen and pelvis between dates March 1st to September 15th, 2020 was performed in the hospitalized COVID-19 positive patients. CTA studies of solely the chest were excluded. Medical record review was performed to note patient demographics, CTA scan details and coagulation profile. CTA findings were reviewed to record vascular and non-vascular findings. CT chest was reviewed to calculate CT chest score. Logistic regression analyses were performed to correlate CT chest scores with odds of vascular and other abdomen–pelvis findings. A p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: A total of 45 consecutive hospitalized COVID-19 positive patients with 61 years mean age and M:F (2:1) gender ratio were evaluated, out of which majority 68.9% (n = 31) had CTA chest, abdomen and pelvis. The most common vascular findings were hematoma 46.7% (n = 21), active extravasation 24.4% (n = 11) and vascular occlusion 17.8% (n = 8). Higher CT chest scores were significantly associated with hematoma/extravasation (OR 1.19, 95% CI 1.07–1.34, p < 0.01). The most common non-vascular abdomen–pelvis findings were seen in organs gallbladder 20% (n = 9), liver 20% (n = 9) followed by kidney 15.6% (n = 7). Higher CT chest scores were significantly associated with bowel findings (OR 1.28, 95% CI 1.01–1.63, p < 0.05) and cholestasis (OR 13.3, 95% CI 1.28–138.9, p < 0.05).

Multiple vaccine candidates are under development, but no vaccine is currently available. Interim safety and immunogenicity data about the vaccine candidate BNT162b1 in younger adults have been reported previously from trials in Germany and the United States. METHODS: In an ongoing, placebo-controlled, observer-blinded, dose-escalation, phase 1 trial conducted in the United States, we randomly assigned healthy adults 18 to 55 years of age and those 65 to 85 years of age to receive either placebo or one of two lipid nanoparticle–formulated, nucleoside-modified RNA vaccine candidates: BNT162b1, which encodes a secreted trimerized SARS-CoV-2 receptor–binding domain; or BNT162b2, which encodes a membrane-anchored SARS-CoV-2 full-length spike, stabilized in the prefusion conformation. The primary outcome was safety (e.g., local and systemic reactions and adverse events); immunogenicity was a secondary outcome. Trial groups were defined according to vaccine candidate, age of the participants, and vaccine dose level (10 μg, 20 μg, 30 μg, and 100 μg). In all groups but one, participants received two doses, with a 21-day interval between doses; in one group (100 μg of BNT162b1), participants received one dose. RESULTS: A total of 195 participants underwent randomization. In each of 13 groups of 15 participants, 12 participants received vaccine and 3 received placebo. BNT162b2 was associated with a lower incidence and severity of systemic reactions than BNT162b1, particularly in older adults. In both younger and older adults, the two vaccine candidates elicited similar dose-dependent SARS-CoV-2–neutralizing geometric mean titers, which were similar to or higher than the geometric mean titer of a panel of SARS-CoV-2 convalescent serum samples. CONCLUSIONS: The safety and immunogenicity data from this U.S. phase 1 trial of two vaccine candidates in younger and older adults, added to earlier interim safety and immunogenicity data regarding BNT162b1 in younger adults from trials in Germany and the United States, support the selection of BNT162b2 for advancement to a pivotal phase 2–3 safety and efficacy evaluation.

This influences nurse-to-patient assignment and often causes an unbalanced workload and longer travel distances for nurses. The objective of this study was to investigate how floor configuration and room density influence nurse travel in the hospital's medical surgical units in Korea. This study presented a novel approach to measure nurse travel distances in eight existing nursing units. The agent-based simulation was conducted to model nurses' walking trails, and the distance of one nurse travel to assigned patient rooms was measured for each nurse. With revisions in the spatial arrangement of patient rooms, locating multi-bed rooms near the nurse station, symmetric room layout centering the nurse station, and planning both single/double-bed and multi-bed rooms on one side of corridors, nurse travel distance decreased more than 15%. This study contributed to the knowledge of agent-based simulation as an evaluation framework for spatial analysis. Apart from application to Korea, these results are particularly of interest in countries where private patient rooms are not commonly economically feasible.","Lee, Jisun; Lee, Hyunsoo; McCuskey Shepley, Mardelle",,462,20

We hypothesised that RV systolic function improves at higher doses of norepinephrine/MAP levels. METHODS: Eleven patients with septic shock requiring norepinephrine after fluid resuscitation were included <24 hours after ICU arrival. Study enrolment and insertion of a pulmonary artery catheter was performed after written informed consent from the next of kin. Norepinephrine infusion was titrated to target mean arterial pressures (MAP) of 60, 75 and 90 mmHg in a random sequential order. At each target MAP, strain—and conventional echocardiographic—and pulmonary haemodynamic variables were measured. RV afterload was assessed as effective pulmonary arterial elastance, (E (pa)) and pulmonary vascular resistance index, (PVRI). RV free wall peak strain was the primary end‐point. RESULTS: At highest compared to lowest norepinephrine dose/MAP level, RV free wall peak strain increased from −19% to −25% (32%, P = .003), accompanied by increased tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (22%, P = .01). At the highest norepinephrine dose/MAP, RV end‐diastolic area index (16%, P < .001), central venous pressure (38%, P < .001), stroke volume index (7%, P = .001), mean pulmonary artery pressure (19%, P < .001) and RV stroke work index (15%, P = .045) increased, with no effects on PVRI or E (pa).

The pathophysiological role of oxidative stress in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) has been well-documented. Additional oxidative stress caused by CQ/HCQ during ARDS could be problematic. In vitro data showing that CQ forms a complex with free-heme that promotes lipid peroxidation of phospholipid bilayers are also relevant to COVID-19. Free-heme induced oxidative stress is implicated as a systemic activator of coagulation, which is increasingly recognized as a contributor to COVID-19 morbidity. This review will also provide a brief overview of CQ/HCQ pharmacology with an emphasis on how these drugs alter proton fluxes in subcellular organelles. CQ/HCQ-induced alterations in proton fluxes influence the type and chemical reactivity of reactive oxygen species (ROS).","Klouda, Christina B.; Stone, William L.",Antioxidants (Basel),462,33

The potential to cause life-threatening respiratory failure and rapid transmission puts COVID-19 in the list of Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). In the last two decades, this is the 3rd deadliest Coronavirus pandemic, following SARS which lasted between 2002 and 2003 and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) from 2012 till date. Globally and as of April 1st 2020, COVID-19 has affected 924,688 individuals in over 200 countries, causing 46,368 fatalities. While the SARS-CoV-2 originated in China with over 82,724 confirmed cases and more than 3000 deaths as at the time of writing this review, the rapid transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has resulted in exponential increase in the number of cases outside of China to about 10 times the report case and death in mainland China. SARS-CoV-2 is suspected to be zoonotic in nature as genetic studies have shown sequence similarity to viruses originating from bats. Extreme precautionary measures, such as curfew, shutting of borders and quarantining of individuals suspected to be infected have been instituted with immediate effect; however, due to individuals that are asymptomatic, uncontrolled human-to-human transmission has resulted in exponential infection rate and numerous loss of lives even with this lockdown measures. This review article summarizes the developing situation surrounding the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic with respect to its epidemiology, unique genomic structure, possible origins, transmission, pathogenesis, comparison with other deadly species of Coronaviruses (CoV) and emerging treatment strategies built on informed literature.","Al-Qahtani, Ahmed A.",Saudi J Biol Sci,462,27

In the fourth industrial revolution, human–computer interaction has been increasingly applied to construction safety management, which has significantly promoted the progress of hazard recognition in the construction industry. However, limited scholars have yet systematically reviewed the development of human–computer interaction in construction hazard recognition. In this study, we analyzed 274 related papers published in ACM Digital Library, Web of Science, Google Scholar, and Scopus between 2000 and 2021 using bibliometric methods, systematically identified the research progress, key topics, and future research directions in this field, and proposed a research framework for human–computer interaction in construction hazard recognition (CHR-HCI). The results showed that, in the past 20 years, the application of human–computer interaction not only made significant contributions to the development of hazard recognition, but also generated a series of new research subjects, such as multimodal physiological data analysis in hazard recognition experiments, development of intuitive devices and sensors, and the human–computer interaction safety management platform based on big data. Future research modules include computer vision, computer simulation, virtual reality, and ergonomics. In this study, we drew a theoretical map reflecting the existing research results and the relationship between them, and provided suggestions for the future development of human–computer interaction in the field of hazard recognition from a practical perspective.","Wang, Jiaming; Cheng, Rui; Liu, Mei; Liao, Pin-Chao",Sensors (Basel),462,1

METHODS: January 2015-June 2019: data on multimodal PTA for <3 cm HCC were extracted from a prospective database. Local tumor progression (LTP), intrahepatic distant recurrence (IDR), time-to-LTP, time-to-IDR, recurrence-free (RFS) and overall (OS) survival were evaluated. RESULTS: 238 patients underwent 317 PTA sessions to treat 412 HCCs. During follow-up (median: 27.1 months), 47.1% patients had IDR and 18.5% died. LTP occurred after 13.3% of PTA. Tumor size (OR = 1.108, p < 0.001; hazard ratio (HR) = 1.075, p = 0.002) and ultrasound guidance (OR = 0.294, p = 0.017; HR = 0.429, p = 0.009) independently predicted LTP and time-to-LTP, respectively. Alpha fetoprotein (AFP) > 100 ng/mL (OR = 3.027, p = 0.037) and tumor size (OR = 1.06, p = 0.001) independently predicted IDR. Multinodular HCC (HR = 2.67, p < 0.001), treatment-naïve patient (HR = 0.507, p = 0.002) and AFP > 100 ng/mL (HR = 2.767, p = 0.014) independently predicted time-to-IDR. RFS was independently predicted by multinodular HCC (HR = 2.144, p = 0.001), treatment naivety (HR = 0.546, p = 0.004) and AFP > 100 ng/mL (HR = 2.437, p = 0.013).

CONCLUSIONS: IDR was associated with tumor aggressiveness, suggesting a metastatic mechanism. Besides AFP association with LTP, IDR, RFS and OS, treatment-naïve patients had longer RFS, and multi-nodularity was associated with shorter RFS and OS. Steatotic HCC, identified on pre-treatment MRI, independently predicted longer OS, and needs to be further explored.","Hermida, Margaux; Cassinotto, Christophe; Piron, Lauranne; Aho-Glélé, Serge; Guillot, Chloé; Schembri, Valentina; Allimant, Carole; Jaber, Samir; Pageaux, Georges-Philippe; Assenat, Eric; Guiu, Boris",Cancers,462,1

Among these proteins, 3-chymotrypsin-like cysteine protease (3CLpro), also named main protease, and the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), have been identified as fundamental targets due to its importance in the viral replication stages. OBJECTIVES: To investigate, in silico, two of the most abundant flavonoid glycosides from Dysphania ambrosioides; a medicinal plant found in many regions of the world, along with some of the putative derivatives of these flavonoid glycosides in the human organism as potential inhibitors of the SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro and RdRp. METHODS: Using a molecular docking approach, the interactions and the binding affinity with SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro and RdRp were predicted for quercetin-3-O-rutinoside (rutin), kaempferol-3-O-rutinoside (nicotiflorin) and some of their glucuronide and sulfate derivatives. FINDINGS: Docking analysis, based on the crystal structure of 3CLpro and RdRp, indicated rutin, nicotiflorin, and their glucuronide and sulfate derivatives as potential inhibitors for both proteins. Also, the importance of the hydrogen bond and π-based interactions was evidenced for the presumed active sites. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: Overall, these results suggest that both flavonoid glycosides and their putative human metabolites can play a key role as inhibitors of the SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro and RdRp. Obviously, further researches, mainly in vitro and in vivo experiments, are necessary to certify the docking results reported here, as well as the adequate application of these substances. Furthermore, it is necessary to investigate the risks of D. ambrosioides as a phytomedicine for use against COVID-19.","da Silva, Felipe Moura A; da Silva, Katia Pacheco A; de Oliveira, Luiz Paulo M; Costa, Emmanoel V; Koolen, Hector HF; Pinheiro, Maria Lúcia B; de Souza, Antonia Queiroz L; de Souza, Afonso Duarte L",Mem Inst Oswaldo Cruz,462,1

During septic shock, inflammatory reaction generates endothelial activation and procoagulant state with microvascular thrombi inducing disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Although CAC and DIC induce altered coagulation responses, their clinical outcomes are different. Objective We investigated and compared coagulopathy between septic shock and critical COVID-19 patients. Method Septic shock patients were diagnosed following the Survival Sepsis Campaign guidelines. COVID-19 patients were admitted in intensive care unit (ICU) for severe acute respiratory distress syndrome. Both were included in the study within 2 days after admission. Biomarkers were measured by ELISA from patient's plasma. Results We observed an increase in vWF and TFPI in both septic and COVID-19 patients compared to controls, highlighting endothelial damage. Interestingly, circulating TF was only elevated in COVID-19 patients. Platelet activation differed between the two cohorts of patients. P-selectin and TLT-1 were specifically heightened in septic shock whereas CD40L was only augmented in COVID-19. Coagulation markers were increased in a disease-dependent way, with PAI-1, tPA and D-Dimers higher in septic shock and fibrinogen level, higher in COVID-19. Discussion COVID-19 patients had longer length-of-stay with more pronounced respiratory failure. This strong lung disruption overtime induced plasmatic TF release with sustained inflammatory response characterized by sCD40L and fibrinogen secretion. Given the similarities between COVID-19 and septic shock regarding fibrinolysis and coagulation, but not platelet activation, endothelium seems to play a central role in COVID-19 and might explain the differences between CAC and DIC.","De Poortere, J.; Dechamps, M.; Laterre, P.

The proposed mechanism involves rotation of a redundant sigmoid loop around a narrow, elongated mesentery with subsequent vascular occlusion. The condition can be intermittent or may resolve spontaneously, complicating diagnosis. Early diagnosis is imperative to prevent ischemic complications including necrosis, perforation, and sepsis. Abdominal pain, abdominal distention, and vomiting are the most common presenting symptoms, however abdominal tenderness is uncommon. Colonic dilation is the most frequent finding on abdominal radiograph. Contrast enema reveals a “bird’s beak” configuration of the twisted colon and moreover, is successful in reducing the majority of pediatric cases. If there is no evidence of bowel ischemia or perforation, endoscopic reduction has been proposed as first-line treatment for sigmoid volvulus, especially in children.

By reviewing the existing literature, this paper analyzes the susceptibility of pregnant women to virus, especially to SARS-CoV-2, from the aspects of anatomical, reproductive endocrine and immune changes during pregnancy and screens effective and fetal-safe treatments from the existing drugs. The anatomical structure of the respiratory system is changed during pregnancy, and the virus transmitted by droplets and aerosols is more easily inhaled by pregnant women and is difficult to remove. Furthermore, the prognosis is worse after infection when compared with non-pregnancy women. And changes in reproductive hormones and immune systems during pregnancy collectively make them more susceptible to certain infections. More importantly, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-2, the SARS-CoV-2 receptor, has been proven highly increased during pregnancy, which may contribute to the susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2. When it comes to treatment, specific drugs for COVID-19 have not been found at present, and taking old drugs for new use in treating COVID-19 has become an emergency method for the pandemic. Particularly, drugs that show superior maternal and fetal safety are worthy of consideration for pregnant women with COVID-19, such as chloroquine, metformin, statins, lobinavir/ritonavir, glycyrrhizic acid, and nanoparticle-mediated drug delivery (NMDD), etc. Pregnant women are susceptible to COVID-19, and special attention should be paid to the selection of drugs that are both effective for maternal diseases and friendly to the fetus. However, there are still many deficiencies in the study of drug safety during pregnancy, and broad-spectrum, effective and fetal-safe drugs for pregnant women need to be developed so as to cope with more infectious diseases in the future.","Zhao, Xiaoxuan; Jiang, Yuepeng; Zhao, Yang; Xi, Hongyan; Liu, Chang; Qu, Fan; Feng, Xiaoling",Eur J Clin Microbiol Infect Dis,462,22

As recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, World Health Organization, and Milk Bank Association, “after each pumping session, all pump part that come into contact with breast milk should be appropriately disinfected.” The present study proposed different methods than can be used and focus on the safety analysis of chlorine solution (CS) in terms of residual hypochlorous acid (HCA) and total trihalomethanes (THM). We also performed an efficacy testing of the CS approach to decontaminate the devices used to collect the milk (breast pumps and bottles). The bacteriologic results of 1,982 breast pump milk samples collected in three different settings showed a major decrease of the microbial contamination using either sterile device or decontamination with CS compared to a simple soap washing. The main messages from our study are to propose a guideline for the safe use of CS and to define situations when breast pump decontamination might be necessary: vulnerable babies for which sterile device is recommended; special circumstances, for example the current COVID-19 pandemic; special situations, for example women living in precarious conditions; or women pumping their milk at work but that would have low or no access to boiled water.

METHODS: Data regarding the incidence of rubella between 1990 and 2004 from Beijing Center for Disease Control and Prevention, and the meteorological variables including daily average temperatures, daily average wind speeds, average precipitations, average relative humidity, average vapor pressures and average low cloud covers between 1986 and 2004 were collected from the Beijing Meteorological Observatory. Descriptive statistics and back-propagation artificial neural network for forecast model’s establishment were adopted for data analysis. RESULTS: The average temperature and relative humidity have a great contribution (100%) to the rubella morbidity. But the combination of other meteorological factors contributed to improve the accuracy of rubella-meteorological forecast models. The forecast accuracy could be improved by 76% through utilizing a combination of meteorological variables spanning from 3 years ago to the present rather than utilizing data from a single year or dating back to more earlier time than 3 years.

Cytoplasmic stress granules (SGs) and processing bodies (PBs) are dynamic structures that form in response to stress-induced translational arrest. PBs are linked to mRNA silencing and decay, while SGs are more closely linked to translation and the sorting of specific mRNAs for different fates. While they share some components and can interact physically, SGs and PBs are regulated independently, house separate functions, and contain unique markers. SG formation is associated with numerous disease states, and the expanding list of SG-associated proteins integrates SG formation with other processes such as transcription, splicing, and survival.

We defined cohorts of vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals from Minnesota (n = 25,589 each) matched on age, sex, race, history of prior SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing, and date of full vaccination. Both vaccines were highly effective during this study period against SARS-CoV-2 infection (mRNA-1273: 86%, 95%CI: 81–90.6%; BNT162b2: 76%, 95%CI: 69–81%) and COVID-19 associated hospitalization (mRNA-1273: 91.6%, 95% CI: 81–97%; BNT162b2: 85%, 95% CI: 73–93%). In July, vaccine effectiveness against hospitalization has remained high (mRNA-1273: 81%, 95% CI: 33–96.3%; BNT162b2: 75%, 95% CI: 24–93.9%), but effectiveness against infection was lower for both vaccines (mRNA-1273: 76%, 95% CI: 58–87%; BNT162b2: 42%, 95% CI: 13–62%), with a more pronounced reduction for BNT162b2. Notably, the Delta variant prevalence in Minnesota increased from 0.7% in May to over 70% in July whereas the Alpha variant prevalence decreased from 85% to 13% over the same time period. Comparing rates of infection between matched individuals fully vaccinated with mRNA-1273 versus BNT162b2 across Mayo Clinic Health System sites in multiple states (Minnesota, Wisconsin, Arizona, Florida, and Iowa), mRNA-1273 conferred a two-fold risk reduction against breakthrough infection compared to BNT162b2 (IRR = 0.50, 95% CI: 0.39–0.64).
