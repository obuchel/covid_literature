2805,Metagenomic Sequencing of an Echovirus 30 Genome From Cerebrospinal Fluid of a Patient With Aseptic Meningitis and Orchitis,2017-07-28,"Enteroviruses cause a wide spectrum of clinical disease. In this study, we describe the case of a young man with orchitis and aseptic meningitis who was diagnosed with enterovirus infection. Using unbiased “metagenomic” massively parallel sequencing, we assembled a near-complete viral genome, the first use of this method for full-genome viral sequencing from cerebrospinal fluid. We found that the genome belonged to the subgroup echovirus 30, which is a common cause of aseptic meningitis but has not been previously reported to cause orchitis.","Piantadosi, Anne; Mukerji, Shibani S; Chitneni, Pooja; Cho, Tracey A; Cosimi, Lisa A; Hung, Deborah T; Goldberg, Marcia B; Sabeti, Pardis C; Kuritzkes, Daniel R; Grad, Yonatan H",Open Forum Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5534216/,374

4310,A Case History in Cooperative Biological Research: Compendium of Studies and Program Analyses in Kazakhstan,2019-11-09,"Kazakhstan and the United States have partnered since 2003 to counter the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. The US Department of Defense (US DoD) has funded threat reduction programs to eliminate biological weapons, secure material in repositories that could be targeted for theft, and enhance surveillance systems to monitor infectious disease outbreaks that would affect national security. The cooperative biological research (CBR) program of the US DoD’s Biological Threat Reduction Program has provided financing, mentorship, infrastructure, and biologic research support to Kazakhstani scientists and research institutes since 2005. The objective of this paper is to provide a historical perspective for the CBR involvement in Kazakhstan, including project chronology, successes and challenges to allow lessons learned to be applied to future CBR endeavors. A project compendium from open source data and interviews with partner country Kazakhstani participants, project collaborators, and stakeholders was developed utilizing studies from 2004 to the present. An earlier project map was used as a basis to determine project linkages and continuations during the evolution of the CBR program. It was determined that consistent and effective networking increases the chances to collaborate especially for competitive funding opportunities. Overall, the CBR program has increased scientific capabilities in Kazakhstan while reducing their risk of biological threats. However, there is still need for increased scientific transparency and an overall strategy to develop a capability-based model to better enhance and sustain future research. Finally, we offer a living perspective that can be applied to further link related studies especially those related to One Health and zoonoses and the assessment of similar capability-building programs.","Yeh, Kenneth B.; Parekh, Falgunee K.; Musralina, Lyazzat; Sansyzbai, Ablay; Tabynov, Kairat; Shapieva, Zhanna; Richards, Allen L.; Hay, John",Trop Med Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6958332/,374
4867,Different Phenotypic Presentations of X-Linked Lymphoproliferative Disease in Siblings with Identical Mutations,2019-05-29,"An oligonucleotide containing multiple AP-1 binding sites was introduced into the regulatory sequence in the long terminal repeat (LTR) of feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV). Chloramphenicol acetyltransferase assay revealed that basal promoter activity of the mutated LTR was higher than that of the wild-type LTR in Crandell feline kidney (CRFK) cells. The mutated LTR was introduced into an infectious molecular clone of FIV and the clone was transfected into CRFK cells. The virus production of the mutant in the cells was as high as that of the wild-type when determined by the reverse transcriptase activity assay. The growth of the mutant virus obtained from the transfected CRFK cells was examined in feline T lymphoblastoid cell lines (MYA-1 and FeL-039 cells) and primary feline peripheral blood mononuclear cells (fPBMCs). The growth was delayed when compared with that of the wild-type virus in all the cells used. Upon examination by polymerase chain reaction, the length of the LTR of the mutant virus was shortened in both MYA-1 cells and fPBMCs. Sequence analysis revealed that the insertion was completely deleted 39 days after infection in the MYA-1 cells.","Miyazawa, T.; Tomonaga, K.; Kawaguchi, Y.; Kohmoto, M.; Inoshima, Y.; Maedadel, K.; Mikami, T.",Arch Virol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7086681/,374
6504,Surfactant protein B and A concentrations are increased in neonatal pneumonia,2015-06-24,"Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA), an autoimmune disease characterized by inflammatory granulomas and necrotizing small-vessel vasculitis, primarily affects the respiratory tract and kidneys. Azathioprine (AZA) is a purine analog that is commonly used for maintaining GPA remission after induction therapy with cyclophosphamide. While the dose-dependent side effects of AZA are common and well known, hypersensitivity reactions such as pulmonary toxicity are rare. Here, we describe a case involving a 38-year-old man with GPA-associated pauci-immune crescentic glomerulonephritis who developed subacute hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP) during AZA maintenance therapy. Five months after the initiation of AZA administration (100 mg/day), the patient was admitted with a 7-day history of cough, dyspnea, and fever. High-resolution computed tomography of the chest showed ill-defined centrilobular nodules and diffuse ground-glass opacities in both lung fields. Bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage was negative for infectious etiologies. A transbronchial lung biopsy specimen revealed poorly formed non-necrotizing granulomas. A chest radiograph obtained at 2 weeks after discontinuation of AZA showed normal findings. The findings from this case suggest that AZA-induced HP should be considered as a differential diagnosis when a patient with GPA exhibits fresh pulmonary lesions accompanied by respiratory symptoms during AZA therapy.","Lee, In Hee; Kang, Gun Woo; Kim, Kyung Chan",Rheumatol Int,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7101638/,374
6783,Der potentielle Organspender – Evaluierung unter besonderer Berücksichtigung der Herzentnahme,2010-07-16,"We found that: rats subjected to thermal skin injury (burn) had increased serum hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) scavenging activity, serum catalase activity, erythrocyte (RBC) fragility, and edematous lung injury (lung leak) when compared to sham-treated rats. Serum H(2)O(2) scavenging activity was inhibited by addition of sodium azide, a catalase inhibitor. Treatment of rats with the oxygen radical scavenger, dimethylthiourea (DMTU), decreased RBC fragility and lung leak but did not alter increased H(2)O(2) scavenging or catalase activity of serum from rats subjected to skin burn. We conclude that increased serum catalase activity is a consequence of thermal skin injury and that increased serum catalase activity may be a mechanism that modulates H(2)O(2)-dependcnt processes following skin burn.","Leff, Jonathan A.; Burton, Lisa K.; Berger, Elaine M.; Anderson, Benjamin O.; Wilke, Christian P.; Repine, John E.",Inflammation,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7102124/,374
7217,Reply to Hugonnet et al,2007-12-15,"Background. Previous studies have shown associations between low mannose-binding lectin (MBL) level or variant MBL2 genotype and sepsis susceptibility. However, MBL deficiency has not been rigorously defined, and associations with sepsis outcomes have not been subjected to multivariable analysis. Methods. We reanalyzed MBL results in a large cohort with use of individual data from 4 studies involving a total of 1642 healthy control subjects and systematically defined a reliable deficiency cutoff. Subsequently, data were reassessed to extend previous MBL and sepsis associations, with adjustment for known outcome predictors. We reanalyzed individual data from 675 patients from 5 adult studies and 1 pediatric study of MBL and severe bacterial infection. Results. XA/O and O/O MBL2 genotypes had the lowest median MBL concentrations. Receiver operating characteristic analysis revealed that an MBL cutoff value of 0.5 ≪g/mL was a reliable predictor of low-producing MBL2 genotypes (sensitivity, 82%; specificity, 82%; negative predictive value, 98%). MBL deficiency was associated with increased likelihood of death among patients with severe bacterial infection (odds ratio, 2.11; 95% confidence interval, 1.30–3.43). In intensive care unit–based studies, there was a trend toward increased risk of death among MBL-deficient patients (odds ratio, 1.58; 95% confidence interval, 0.90–2.77) after adjustment for Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Enquiry II score. The risk of death was increased among MBL-deficient patients with Streptococcus pneumoniae infection (odds ratio, 5.62; 95% confidence interval, 1.27–24.92) after adjustment for bacteremia, comorbidities, and age. Conclusions. We defined a serum level for MBL deficiency that can be used with confidence in future studies of MBL disease associations. The risk of death was increased among MBL-deficient patients with severe pneumococcal infection, highlighting the pathogenic significance of this innate immune defence protein.","Eisen, Damon P.; Dean, Melinda M.; Boermeester, Marja A.; Fidler, Katy J.; Gordon, Anthony C.; Kronborg, Gitte; Kun, Jürgen F.

7400,Clinical Features and Duration of Traveler's Diarrhea in Relation to Its Etiology,1994-10-11,"The possibility that viral infections of the respiratory tract might predispose to bacterial colonization or infection was studied in 120 patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and 30 control subjects; these individuals were observed for seven years. The ratio of the number of observed to the number of expected associations between viruses and bacteria was 2.43 (P = 0.037) for the pair influenza virus and Streptococcus pneumoniae and was 2.06 (P = 0.056) for influenza virus and Haemophilus influenzae. Consistently positive, but not significant, associations were detected between rhinovirus and herpes simplex virus infections and isolations of S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae. In contrast, isolations of the nonpathogenic Haemophilus parainfluenzae could not be related to prior viral infections. Significant rises in titer of antibody to H. iniluenzae were detected on 76 occasions, and 20 (26%) of these antibody rises were associated with viral or mycoplasmal infections during the preceding 120 days. The expected number of such associations was 8.34 (ratio of number observed to number expected, 2.40; P = 0.08). These results suggest that viral infections of the respiratory tract in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease are associated with increased colonization by potentially pathogenic bacteria and may also predispose to infection with H. injluenxae.","Smith, Charles B.; Golden, Carole; Klauber, Melville R.; Kanner, Richard; Renzetti, Attilio",J Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7109971/,374

18337,A Novel Dosing Strategy of Ceftolozane/Tazobactam in a Patient Receiving Intermittent Hemodialysis,2021-05-12,"Infections caused by multidrug resistant (MDR) bacteria are a major public health threat. Carbapenems are among the most potent antimicrobial agents that are commercially available to treat MDR bacteria. Bacterial production of carbapenem-hydrolysing metallo-β-lactamases (MBLs) challenges their safety and efficacy, with subclass B1 MBLs hydrolysing almost all β-lactam antibiotics. MBL inhibitors would fulfil an urgent clinical need by prolonging the lifetime of these life-saving drugs. Here we report the synthesis and activity of a series of 2-mercaptomethyl-thiazolidines (MMTZs), designed to replicate MBL interactions with reaction intermediates or hydrolysis products. MMTZs are potent competitive inhibitors of B1 MBLs in vitro (e.g., K(i) = 0.44 μM vs. NDM-1). Crystal structures of MMTZ complexes reveal similar binding patterns to the most clinically important B1 MBLs (NDM-1, VIM-2 and IMP-1), contrasting with previously studied thiol-based MBL inhibitors, such as bisthiazolidines (BTZs) or captopril stereoisomers, which exhibit lower, more variable potencies and multiple binding modes. MMTZ binding involves thiol coordination to the Zn(ii) site and extensive hydrophobic interactions, burying the inhibitor more deeply within the active site than d/l-captopril. Unexpectedly, MMTZ binding features a thioether–π interaction with a conserved active-site aromatic residue, consistent with their equipotent inhibition and similar binding to multiple MBLs. MMTZs penetrate multiple Enterobacterales, inhibit NDM-1 in situ, and restore carbapenem potency against clinical isolates expressing B1 MBLs. Based on their inhibitory profile and lack of eukaryotic cell toxicity, MMTZs represent a promising scaffold for MBL inhibitor development. These results also suggest sulphur–π interactions can be exploited for general ligand design in medicinal chemistry.","Rossi, Maria-Agustina; Martinez, Veronica; Hinchliffe, Philip; Mojica, Maria F.; Castillo, Valerie; Moreno, Diego M.; Smith, Ryan; Spellberg, Brad; Drusano, George L.; Banchio, Claudia; Bonomo, Robert A.; Spencer, James; Vila, Alejandro J.; Mahler, Graciela",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8179362/,374

Non-specific deposition of blood biomolecules on nanomedicines triggers complement activation through the alternative pathway, but complement-triggering mechanisms of nanomaterials with dimensions comparable to or smaller than many globular blood proteins are unknown. Here we study this using a library of <6 nm poly(amido amine) dendrimers bearing different end-terminal functional groups. Dendrimers are not sensed by C1q and mannan-binding lectin, and hence do not trigger complement activation through these pattern-recognition molecules. While, pyrrolidone- and carboxylic acid-terminated dendrimers fully evade complement response, and independent of factor H modulation, binding of amine-terminated dendrimers to a subset of natural IgM glycoforms triggers complement activation through lectin pathway-IgM axis. These findings contribute to mechanistic understanding of complement surveillance of dendrimeric materials, and provide opportunities for dendrimer-driven engineering of complement-safe nanomedicines and medical devices.","Wu, Lin-Ping; Ficker, Mario; Christensen, Jørn B.; Simberg, Dmitri; Trohopoulos, Panagiotis N.; Moghimi, Seyed M.",Nat Commun,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8357934/,374

This article argues that such “approaches” amount to physical and non-physical repression—hard power, but employed by Hong Kong, rather than mainland, forces, combined with sharp power exercised by both Beijing and the local authorities. These measures are responses to the limits on what Beijing can do under the “one country, two systems” model. As Beijing cannot send the People's Liberation Army (PLA), it has subverted Hong Kong's once-respected civilian police force to act like the mainland's public security. And as Hong Kong's judiciary is relatively autonomous and many of the arrested would not be convicted or sentenced, the police have resorted to a decapacitation campaign to inflict direct violence on protesters. Moreover, as the city's freedom has allowed the public to support protesters in various ways, Beijing has launched a program of dismissal of pro-democracy individuals in both public and private sectors. To zoom in on Beijing's hard and soft repression, this article examines in closer detail the other “frontliners” at protest sites who provide professional services vital to the sustainability of protests: medics, firefighters, lawyers, journalists, and educators.","Hui, Victoria Tin-bor",Orbis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7102642/,374

23507,Early Detection and Timely Reporting of Non-Mumps Etiologies of Parotitis: An Example in Developing Clinical and Public Health Partnerships,2015-12-09,"Although bats are increasingly becoming the focus of scientific studies due to their unique properties, these exceptional animals are still among the least studied mammals. Assembly quality and completeness of bat genomes vary a lot and especially non-coding RNA (ncRNA) annotations are incomplete or simply missing. Accordingly, standard bioinformatics pipelines for gene expression analysis often ignore ncRNAs such as microRNAs or long antisense RNAs. The main cause of this problem is the use of incomplete genome annotations. We present a complete screening for ncRNAs within 16 bat genomes. NcRNAs affect a remarkable variety of vital biological functions, including gene expression regulation, RNA processing, RNA interference and, as recently described, regulatory processes in viral infections. Within all investigated bat assemblies, we annotated 667 ncRNA families including 162 snoRNAs and 193 miRNAs as well as rRNAs, tRNAs, several snRNAs and lncRNAs, and other structural ncRNA elements. We validated our ncRNA candidates by six RNA-Seq data sets and show significant expression patterns that have never been described before in a bat species on such a large scale. Our annotations will be usable as a resource (rna.uni-jena.de/supplements/bats) for deeper studying of bat evolution, ncRNAs repertoire, gene expression and regulation, ecology and important host–virus interactions.","Mostajo, Nelly F; Lataretu, Marie; Krautwurst, Sebastian; Mock, Florian; Desirò, Daniel; Lamkiewicz, Kevin; Collatz, Maximilian; Schoen, Andreas; Weber, Friedemann; Marz, Manja; Hölzer, Martin",NAR Genom Bioinform,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7108008/,374

For each such system, we describe sources used to acquire necessary data for use by public health agencies, and the technology used to clean, manage, organize, and display the information. We discuss challenges and successes in sharing information among these various systems, and opportunities presented by emerging technologies. Systems to support public health surveillance may support traditional passive case-reporting, as enhanced by electronic laboratory reporting and (emerging) direct reporting from electronic health records, and also a wide variety of different surveillance systems. We address syndromic surveillance and other novel approaches including registries for reporting and follow-up of cases of cancer, birth defects, lead poisoning, hepatitis B, etc., and population-based surveys (such as BRFSS or PRAMS). Systems to support epidemiologic investigation of outbreaks and clusters include generic tools such as Excel, SAS, SPSS, and R, and specialized tool-kits for epidemiologic analysis such as Epi-Info. In addition to supporting outbreak investigation, agencies also need systems to collect and manage summary information about outbreaks, investigations, and responses. Systems to support case management, contact tracing, and case-based disease control interventions are often integrated to some degree with surveillance systems. We focus on opportunities and choices in the design and implementation of these systems.","Hopkins, Richard S.; Magnuson, J.

This paper deals with a novel method of outlier detection using linguistic summaries. Particular attention is devoted to examining the usefulness of non-monotonic quantifiers, which represent a fuzzy determination of the amount of analyzed data. The answer is positive. The use of non-monotonic quantifiers in the detection of outliers can provide a more significant value of the degree of truth of a linguistic summary.

35119,Reply,2020-06-22,"High-resolution reconstruction of emission rates from different sources is essential to achieve accurate simulations of atmospheric transport processes. How to achieve real-time forecasts of atmospheric transport is still a great challenge, in particular due to the large computational demands of this problem. Considering a case study of volcanic sulfur dioxide emissions, the codes of the Lagrangian particle dispersion model MPTRAC and an inversion algorithm for emission rate estimation based on sequential importance resampling are deployed on the Tianhe-2 supercomputer. The high-throughput based parallel computing strategy shows excellent scalability and computational efficiency. Therefore, the spatial-temporal resolution of the emission reconstruction can be improved by increasing the parallel scale. In our study, the largest parallel scale is up to 1.446 million compute processes, which allows us to obtain emission rates with a resolution of 30 min in time and 100 m in altitude. By applying massive-parallel computing systems such as Tianhe-2, real-time source estimation and forecasts of atmospheric transport are becoming feasible.","Liu, Mingzhao; Huang, Yaopeng; Hoffmann, Lars; Huang, Chunyan; Chen, Pin; Heng, Yi",Computational Science - ICCS 2020,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7304025/,374

The framework that we have developed is based around training an artificial neural network (ANN) to guide standard mesh generation software, based upon a prediction of the required local mesh density throughout the domain. We describe the training regime that is proposed, based upon the use of a posteriori error estimation, and discuss the topologies of the ANNs that we have considered. We then illustrate performance using two standard test problems, a single elliptic partial differential equation (PDE) and a system of PDEs associated with linear elasticity. We demonstrate the effective generation of high quality meshes for arbitrary polygonal geometries and a range of material parameters, using a variety of user-selected error norms.","Zhang, Zheyan; Wang, Yongxing; Jimack, Peter K.; Wang, He",Computational Science - ICCS 2020,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7304029/,374

Furthermore, the climate emergency will also increase the occurrence of such disasters. In this context, forest fire propagation prediction is a key tool to fight against these natural hazards efficiently and mitigate the damages. However, forest fire spread simulators require a set of input parameters that, in many cases, cannot be measured and must be estimated indirectly introducing uncertainty in forest fire propagation predictions. One of such parameters is the wind. It is possible to measure wind using meteorological stations and it is also possible to predict wind using meteorological models such as WRF. However, wind components are highly affected by the terrain topography introducing a large degree of uncertainty in forest fire spread predictions. Therefore, it is necessary to introduce wind field models that estimate wind speed and direction at very high resolution to reduce such uncertainty. Such models are time consuming models that are usually executed under strict time constrains. So, it is critical to minimize the execution time, taking into account the fact that in many cases it is not possible to execute the model on a supercomputer, but must be executed on commodity hardware available on the field or at control centers. This work introduces a new parallelization approach for wind field calculation based on Python multiprocessing to accelerate wind field evaluation. The results show that the new approach reduces execution time using a single personal computer.","Sanjuan, Gemma; Margalef, Tomas; Cortés, Ana",Computational Science - ICCS 2020,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7304711/,374

Given a text of length n and a pattern of length m, we are asked to output the distance between the pattern and every n-substring of the text. A basic variant of this problem is computation of Hamming distances, that is counting the number of mismatches (different characters aligned), for each alignment. Other popular variants include [Formula: see text] distance (Manhattan distance), [Formula: see text] distance (Euclidean distance) and general [Formula: see text] distance. While each of those problems trivially generalizes classical pattern-matching, the efficient algorithms for them require a broader set of tools, usually involving both algebraic and combinatorial insights. We briefly survey the history of the problems, and then focus on the progress made in the past few years in many specific settings: fine-grained complexity and lower-bounds, [Formula: see text] multiplicative approximations, k-bounded relaxations, streaming algorithms, purely combinatorial algorithms, and other recently proposed variants.","Uznański, Przemysław",Beyond the Horizon of Computability,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7309496/,374

To enhance UV protection and prevent skin penetration behaviors, inspired by the mussel adhesive proteins, the functional polydopamine (PDA) is employed herein to fabricate polydopamine/carboxymethyl cellulose/polyacrylic acid (PDA/CMC/PAA) adhesive hydrogels. To disperse PDA nanoparticles well in the PAA matrix, dopamine was self-polymerized in CMC solution to form PDA/CMC complex. Acrylic acid was polymerized in PDA/CMC complex solution and cross-linked to construct UV-resistant PDA/CMC/PAA hydrogel. The morphology, rheological behavior, mechanical properties and adhesion strength of PDA/CMC/PAA hydrogels were studied by scanning electron microscopy, rotational rheometer, universal test machine. Owing to the hydrogen bonding interaction between the PDA/CMC complex and PAA, the PDA/CMC/PAA hydrogels showed high resilience and compressive strength to withstand large deformation. The hydrogels exhibited strong adhesion to various substrate surfaces, such as stainless steel, aluminum, glass and porcine skin. The biocompatibility and UV-shielding properties were investigated through culture of cells and UV irradiation test. The adhesiveness of PDA promoted cell adhesion and provided the PDA/CMC/PAA hydrogels good biocompatibility with 96% of relative cell viability. The hydrogels possessed excellent UV-shielding ability to prevent collagen fibers from being destroyed during UV irradiation, which has promising potential in the practical applications for UV filtration membrane and skin care products.","Tang, Zuwu; Miao, Yanan; Zhao, Jing; Xiao, He; Zhang, Min; Liu, Kai; Zhang, Xingye; Huang, Liulian; Chen, Lihui; Wu, Hui",Cellulose (Lond),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7778394/,374

Traditionally, farm yard manure is produced from forest leaf litter and excreta of livestock obtaining > 50% feed from forests. Chemical fertilizers are not used in rainfed farms on slopes. Experiments were conducted to test whether increase in FYM input rates results improvement in economic and environmental functions of agro-ecosystems. Increase in FYM input rate from 30 t/ha/crop-season currently practiced by farmers to 60 t/ha/crop-season showed substantial increase in crop yield and soil quality. Rice and wheat were more responsive to FYM input than the legume black gram. Harvest index is maximum for 60 t/ha/crop-season FYM treatment for rice and wheat. In blackgram maximum harvest index was obtained when no FYM was provided. During the 3 years of study, soil pH decreased (becoming more acidic) as compared to that recorded at the start of the study. Soil organic carbon generally declined upto second kharif season and then improved during second rabi (fallow) under no input treatment, and 16t/ha/crop-season FYM treatment and levels of N, P and Mg too showed patterns similar to soil organic carbon, but the trends varied for Ca, Na and K. Soils of fields put to 0 and 16 t/ha/crop-season FYM treatments showed a net decrease in concentration of these elements and those put to 30 and 60 t/ha/crop-season FYM treatments showed increase in their level.","Chandra, Abhishek; Pardha-Saradhi, P.; Maikhuri, R.

This study applied the Job Demands-Resources Model (JD-R) and administered a cross-sectional survey (n = 137) to examine disparities in personal and external demands and resources that may impact job satisfaction and turnover rates among ECE staff who provide care for preschool children (3–5 years of age). ECE staff reported higher levels of personal demands, including depression and perceived stress, and external demands, including workload and staffing concerns, compared to the national workforce (all p < .01). The data also illustrated disparities related to resource access; ECE staff reported lower levels of personal resources, including mindfulness, and less access to external resources including safety climate, resource adequacy, role clarity, respect, and management relationships (all p < .01). Only 34% of ECE staff reported being very satisfied with their work compared to 49% of the national workforce (p < .01). External resources were significantly and positively associated with job satisfaction (B = .09, p < .01). These findings suggest that ECE staff experience significantly higher demands and have access to significantly fewer resources in the workplace, and that bolstering job-related resources may translate to increased job satisfaction.","Farewell, Charlotte V.; Quinlan, Jennie; Melnick, Emily; Powers, Jamie; Puma, Jini",Early Child Educ J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7784221/,374

Implementation and Evaluation of Alcohol Screening Tool in HIV Patients,2020-12-31,"BACKGROUND: Community acquired respiratory virus infections (RVI) are a major concern in solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients due to severe complications such as lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI), superimposed fungal and bacterial pneumonia, intensive care admission and mortality. Besides influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), there is paucity of data of RVI in SOT recipients. Table 1: Patients characteristics [Image: see text] Table 2: Concomitant infections [Image: see text] METHODS: Retrospective cohort study of a single large transplant center was performed. Data of multiplex qualitative PCR-based respiratory viral panel (RVP) samples collected between January 2017 and December 2019 were included. It is important to mention that our institution generally performs the RSV/influenza rapid detection assay as an initial test; if negative, the multiplex PCR panel is usually done. We did not include results from the RSV/influenza rapid test in this study. RESULTS: One hundred transplant patients with a single positive RVP were included (table 1). Transplanted organs include kidney (40%), followed by lung (33%) and liver (9%). Most common presenting symptoms were cough (52%), shortness of breath (28%) and rhinorrhea (26%). Of note fever was seen in only 24%. Most common RVI was Rhinovirus/Enterovirus (RHV/ENT) (59%), followed by non-SARS-CoV-2 Coronavirus (19%) and Parainfluenza (PIV) (14%). None of the patients had neutropenia, however, 52% had lymphocytopenia. Lung transplant patients developed LRTI in 70% of cases compared to non-lung transplant 64% (p=0.412). Multivariate analysis showed patients with PIV 3 were less likely to develop LRTI (p= 0.038). Significant Cytomegalovirus DNAemia (>137 IU/mL) was noted in 9.8% of the recipients. No proven or probable pulmonary fungal infection were noted within 3 months after diagnosis of RVI. Five patients were admitted to the Intensive care unit due to septic shock. Three patients died at 4, 5 and 35 days after diagnosis of RHV/ENT, PIV-3 and RHV/ENT respectively. CONCLUSION: Most of the cases of RVI were due to RHV/ENT. Patients with PIV 3 were less likely to develop LRTI. Lung transplant recipients developed LRTI with similar incidence to non-lung recipients. Our data shows a very low mortality of 3% after RVI in our SOT cohort, which warrants larger studies. DISCLOSURES: Michele I.

We sought to leveraging organic, large-scale discussion on Twitter about social distancing to understand public’s beliefs and opinions on this policy. METHODS: Between March 27 and April 10, 2020, we sampled 574,903 English tweets that matched the two most trending social distancing hashtags at the time, #socialdistancing and #stayathome. We used natural language processing techniques to conduct a sentiment analysis that identifies tweet polarity and emotions. We also evaluated the subjectivity of tweets and estimated the frequency of discussion of social distancing rules. We then identified clusters of discussion using topic modeling and compared the sentiment by topic. RESULTS: There was net positive sentiment toward both #socialdistancing and #stayathome with mean sentiment scores of 0.150 (standard deviation [SD], 0.292) and 0.144 (SD, 0.287) respectively. Tweets were also more likely to be objective (median, 0.40; IQR, 0 to 0.6) with approximately 30% of all tweets labeled as completely objective. Approximately half (50.4%) of all tweets primarily expressed joy and one-fifth expressed fear and surprise each (Figure 1). These trends correlated well with topic clusters identified by frequency including leisure activities and community support (i.e., joy), concerns about food insecurity and effects of the quarantine (i.e., fear), and unpredictability of COVID and its unforeseen implications (i.e., surprise) (Table 1).

Cases in the USA have exceeded 1.9 million with over 40% of deaths occurring in nursing homes and assisting living facilities. We describe our experience in controlling an outbreak in our community living centers (CLC) METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the charts of Veterans with positive nasopharyngeal (NP) RT-PCR for SC2 from March 24 to April 18, 2020 in 2 neighboring CLC units (80 bed capacity), at Northport Affairs Medical Center. RESULTS: Twenty five Veterans (24 men) tested positive for SC2. Of these, 5 remained asymptomatic, 9 got hospitalized, 6 died. No coinfection with influenza or other respiratory viruses identified. 11 health care workers (HCW) tested positive. Figure 1 shows test results by date. Table 1 summarizes the demographic characteristics, medical history, and laboratory findings. The median age was 74 years, with no difference in age between recovered and deceased, 73 vs. 77, P:0.105. Simplified acute physiology score (SAPS) II score was higher in the deceased group (P=0.001) and so were D-dimer (admission and peak levels), CRP, LDH, and peak ferritin/procalcitonin levels. There was no ICU admission. Figure 2 illustrates the CLC 1 and 2 outline of beds depicting positive cases in sequence of detection. Initial spread of the virus was fast, affecting residents and HCW. CLC visits were prohibited, floating of staff minimized, internal group activities halted, infection control measures and education on proper use of personal protective equipment provided. A SC2 (or “COVID”) unit was created in CLC1 and all patients and staff got tested. Withdrawal of isolation precautions required resolution of symptoms, and two sequential negative NP PCR tests which were obtained after 14 days from diagnosis. If the PCR was positive, a repeat test was obtained in 72 hours. 13 patients had persistent positive PCR for average 32 days (19 to 52) since diagnosis. 7/13 got tested and all were positive for SC2 IgG antibody.

A substantial amount of the morbidity is attributed to volume overload, for which loop diuretics are a mandatory treatment. However, the variability in response to diuretics and development of diuretic resistance adversely affect the clinical outcomes. Morevoer, there exists a marked intra- and inter-patient variability in response to diuretics that affects the clinical course and related adverse outcomes. In the present article, we review the mechanisms underlying the development of diuretic resistance. The role of the autonomic nervous system and chronobiology in the pathogenesis of congestive heart failure and response to therapy are also discussed. Establishing a novel model for overcoming diuretic resistance is presented based on a patient-tailored variability and chronotherapy-guided machine learning algorithm that comprises clinical, laboratory, and sensor-derived inputs, including inputs from pulmonary artery measurements. Inter- and intra-patient signatures of variabilities, alterations of biological clock, and autonomic nervous system responses are embedded into the algorithm; thus, it may enable a tailored dose regimen in a continuous manner that accommodates the highly dynamic complex system.","Kenig, Ariel; Kolben, Yotam; Asleh, Rabea; Amir, Offer; Ilan, Yaron",Front Cardiovasc Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8385752/,374

MATERIALS AND METHODS The study of publications was carried out through search engines on the Internet using keywords. To diagnose the infection, the COVID-19 program was used on the MeDiCase platform, which is publicly available on www.medicase.pro, which suggests a diagnosis with a sensitivity of 89.47%. The study included 85 patients with acute COVID-19 with mild to moderate disease, aged 11 to 81 years. The presence of the pathogen was confirmed immunologically in 12% of patients; in other cases, the diagnosis was based on the results of an automated survey in the MeDiCase system. All patients, according to the MGNOT recommendations, were prescribed one of the oral direct anticoagulants - Eliquis at a dose of 5 mg 2 times a day, Ksarelto at a dose of 10 mg 2 times a day or Pradax at a dose of 110 mg 2 times a day for at least 2 weeks. All other drugs with antiviral, immunomodulatory effects, antibiotics were canceled. RESULTS The presence of DIC is substantiated by the morphological picture of changes in organs and tissues, clinical (hematoma-petechial type of bleeding in combination with thromboembolic syndrome and the presence of thrombovasculitis) and laboratory changes: an increase in the level of soluble fibrin-monomer complexes, D-dimer, hyperfibrinogenaemia, less often - thrombocytopenia, violation of fibrinolytic activity. The phenomenon of consumption of clotting factors and profuse bleeding are rare. Direct anticoagulants, fresh frozen plasma transfusions and plasmapheresis are used in the treatment of disseminated intravascular coagulation. The paper presents its own positive results of early prescription at the outpatient stage of direct oral anticoagulants in prophylactic doses (no case of disease progression), individual cases of the use of fresh frozen plasma and plasapheresis. CONCLUSION DIC syndrome with the development of thrombovasculitis is the most important pathogenetic mechanism for the development of microthrombotic and hemorrhagic disorders in organs during infection with COVID-19, leading to dysfunction of the lungs, brain and other nerve tissues, kidneys, thromboembolic complications, etc. Many symptoms of the disease may be associated with a violation of the nervous regulation of the functions of organs and systems. Prevention of thrombovasculitis is effective already at the stage of the first manifestation of the disease with the outpatient use of direct anticoagulants (oral, low molecular weight heparins). In case of more severe manifestations (complications) of the disease, additional use of freshly frozen plasma and plasmapheresis is effective.","Vorobyev, P A; Momot, A P; Krasnova, L S; Vorobiev, A P; Talipov, A K",Terapevticheskii arkhiv,https://doi.org/10.26442/00403660.2020.11.000887; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33720604/,374
67465,Quantitative SARS-CoV-2 Serology in Children With Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome (MIS-C).,2020-09-02,"Epithelial and haematologic tumours often show the overexpression of the serine/threonine kinase AURKA. Recently, AURKA was shown to localise at mitochondria, where it regulates mitochondrial dynamics and ATP production. Here we define the molecular mechanisms of AURKA in regulating mitochondrial turnover by mitophagy. AURKA triggers the degradation of Inner Mitochondrial Membrane/matrix proteins by interacting with core components of the autophagy pathway. On the inner mitochondrial membrane, the kinase forms a tripartite complex with MAP1LC3 and the mitophagy receptor PHB2, which triggers mitophagy in a PARK2/Parkin-independent manner. The formation of the tripartite complex is induced by the phosphorylation of PHB2 on Ser39, which is required for MAP1LC3 to interact with PHB2. Last, treatment with the PHB2 ligand xanthohumol blocks AURKA-induced mitophagy by destabilising the tripartite complex and restores normal ATP production levels. Altogether, these data provide evidence for a role of AURKA in promoting mitophagy through the interaction with PHB2 and MAP1LC3. This work paves the way to the use of function-specific pharmacological inhibitors to counteract the effects of the overexpression of AURKA in cancer.","Bertolin, Giulia; Alves-Guerra, Marie-Clotilde; Cheron, Angélique; Burel, Agnès; Prigent, Claude; Le Borgne, Roland; Tramier, Marc",Life science alliance,https://doi.org/10.26508/lsa.202000806; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33820826/,374

To date at least six different inflammasome signalling platforms have been reported (Bauernfeind & Hornung, EMBO Mol Med. 2013;5:814-26; Broz & Dixit, Nat Rev Immunol. 2016;16:407). This review focuses on the complex molecular machinery involved in activation and regulation of the best characterised inflammasome, NLRP3 (NOD-, LRR- and pyrin domain-containing protein 3), and the development of molecular agents to modulate NLRP3 inflammasome function. Activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome induces inflammation via secretion of interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and interleukin-18 (IL-18) proinflammatory cytokines, with orchestration of pyroptotic cell death, to eliminate invading microbial pathogens. This field has gradually moved from an emphasis on monogenic autoinflammatory conditions, such as cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes (CAPS), to the broad spectrum of innate immune-mediated disease. NLRP3 inflammasome activation is also linked to a range of common disorders in humans including type 2 diabetes (Krainer et al., J Autoimmun. 2020:102421), cystic fibrosis (Scambler et al., eLife. 2019;8), myocardial infarction, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease (Savic et al., Nat Rev Rheumatol. 2020:1-16) and cancers such as mesotheliomas and gliomas (Moossavi et al., Mol Cancer. 2018;17:158). We describe how laboratory-based assessment of NLRP3 inflammasome activation is emerging as an integral part of the clinical evaluation and treatment of a range of undifferentiated systemic autoinflammatory disorders (uSAID) (Harrison et al., JCI Insight. 2016;1), where a DNA-based diagnosis has not been possible. In addition, this review summarises the current literature on physiological inhibitors and features various pharmacological approaches that are currently being developed, with potential for clinical translation in autoinflammatory and immune-mediated conditions. We discuss the possibilities of rational drug design, based on detailed structural analyses, and some of the challenges in transferring exciting preliminary results from trials of small-molecule inhibitors of the NLRP3 inflammasome, in animal models of disease, to the clinical situation in human pathology.","Caseley, Emily A; Poulter, James A; Rodrigues, François; McDermott, Michael F",Genes and immunity,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41435-020-0104-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32681062/,374

Throughout recent decades, dietary changes have boosted demand of beverages to meet the liquid consumption needs, among which rising consumption of several calorie-rich beverages have increased the risk of fatty liver disease. Meanwhile, certain beverages have capacity to deliver many unanticipated health benefits thereby reducing the burden of NAFLD and metabolic diseases. The present review therefore addresses the increasing interconnections between beverages intake among population, dietary patterns and the overall effect of these beverage on the development and prevention of NAFLD. Methods In the present review, some frequently consumed beverage groups have been analyzed in light of their role in the advancement and prevention of NAFLD, including sugar sweetened, hot and alcoholic beverages. The nutritional composition of different beverages makes the progression of NAFLD distinctive. RESULTS The ingestion of sugar-rich beverages has demonstrated the metabolic burden and in all cases, raises the risk of NAFLD, while intake of coffee and tea has decreased this risk without any significant adverse effects. In some cases, low to moderate alcohol intake has been shown to minimize the risk of advanced fibrosis and NAFLD-mortality.

81556,Posterior inferior cerebellar artery to posterior inferior cerebellar artery in situ bypass for the treatment of Bow hunter's-type dynamic ischemia in holovertebral dissection.,2012,"COVID-19 was first reported in December 2019 in the Wuhan city of China, and since then it has spread worldwide taking a heavy toll on human life and economy. COVID-19 infection is commonly associated with symptoms like coughing, fever, and shortness of breath, besides, the reports of muscle pain, anosmia, hyposmia, and loss of taste are becoming evident. Recent reports suggest the pathogenic invasion of the SARS-CoV-2 into the CNS, that could thereby result in devastating long term complications, primarily because some of these complications may go unnoticed for a long time. Evidence suggest that the virus could enter the CNS through angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) receptor, neuronal transport, haematogenous route, and nasal route via olfactory bulb, cribriform plate, and propagates through trans-synaptic signalling, and shows retrograde movement into the CNS along nerve fiber. COVID-19 induces CNS inflammation and neurological degenerative damage through a diverse mechanism which includes ACE-2 receptor damage, cytokine-associated injury or cytokine storm syndrome, secondary hypoxia, demyelination, blood-brain barrier disruption, neurodegeneration, and neuroinflammation. Viral invasion into the CNS has been reported to show association with complications like Parkinsonism, Alzheimer's disorder, meningitis, encephalopathy, anosmia, hyposmia, anxiety, depression, psychiatric symptoms, seizures, stroke, etc. This review provides a detailed discussion of the CNS pathogenesis of COVID-19. Authors conclude that the COVID-19 cannot just be considered as a disorder of the pulmonary or peripheral system, rather it has a significant CNS involvement. Therefore, CNS aspects of the COVID-19 should be monitored very closely to prevent long term CNS complications, even after the patient has recovered from COVID-19.","Nagu, Priyanka; Parashar, Arun; Behl, Tapan; Mehta, Vineet",Reviews in the neurosciences,https://doi.org/10.1515/revneuro-2020-0070; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33550782/,374

How the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Experience Influenced a Singapore Radiology Department's Response to the Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Epidemic.,2020-03-04,"PURPOSE Locally recurrent rectal cancer may cause significant morbidity. Prior reports of rectal cancer reirradiation following local recurrence suggest treatment efficacy, with variable rates of late toxicity. Modern techniques including intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) may improve the therapeutic index. We report outcomes for pelvic reirradiation as treatment for rectal cancer using IMRT. METHODS AND MATERIALS The records of 31 patients undergoing reirradiation for rectal cancer between 2004 and 2013 were reviewed. All patients underwent IMRT using an accelerated hyperfractionation (39 Gy in 1.5-Gy fractions delivered twice daily, n=15) or once-daily fractionation technique (median dose, 30.4 Gy; range, 27-40 Gy in 15-22 fractions; n = 16). The median cumulative dose was 77 Gy (range, 59-113), and the median interval from prior pelvic radiation therapy was 39.8 months (range, 10.1-307.6). Treatment intent was palliative in 20 patients and neoadjuvant or adjuvant in 11 patients. Surgery was generally reserved for patients with an isolated local recurrence. Concurrent chemotherapy was administered for 25/31 patients, most frequently capecitabine (n=11) or continuous infusion 5-fluorouracil (n=10). RESULTS Median follow-up was 11.3 months. The prescribed treatment was completed in 29/31 patients (93.5%). Among 18 patients with symptoms attributable to recurrent disease, successful palliation was achieved in 10/18 (55.6%). The rate of grade 2 and grade 3 acute toxicities was 32.3% and 3.2%, respectively. Local control rates at 1 and 2 years were 61.3% and 47.3%, respectively. Median overall survival was 21.9 months, and 1-year survival was 66.7% for patients who had surgical resection versus 58.7% for those who did not (P = .0802). CONCLUSIONS Rectal cancer reirradiation using IMRT is well-tolerated in the setting of prior pelvic radiation therapy. Given significant risk of local progression, further dose escalation may be warranted for patients with life expectancy exceeding 1 year.","Youssef, Fady F; Parikh, Parag J; DeWees, Todd A; Mutch, Matthew G; Tan, Benjamin R; Grigsby, Perry W; Myerson, Robert J; Olsen, Jeffrey R",Advances in radiation oncology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.adro.2016.02.002; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28740875/,374

88401,Seasonality of coronaviruses and other respiratory viruses in Canada: Implications for COVID-19.,2021-03-31,"BACKGROUND The pandemic due to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has tremendous consequences for our societies. Knowledge of the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 is needed to accurately monitor the spread of the epidemic and to calculate the infection fatality rate (IFR). These measures may help the authorities make informed decisions and adjust the current societal interventions. The objective was to perform nationwide real-time seroprevalence surveying among blood donors as a tool to estimate previous SARS-CoV-2 infections and the population-based IFR. METHODS Danish blood donors aged 17-69 years giving blood 6 April to 3 May were tested for SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin M and G antibodies using a commercial lateral flow test. Antibody status was compared between geographical areas, and an estimate of the IFR was calculated. Seroprevalence was adjusted for assay sensitivity and specificity taking the uncertainties of the test validation into account when reporting the 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS The first 20 640 blood donors were tested, and a combined adjusted seroprevalence of 1.9% (95% CI, .8-2.3) was calculated. The seroprevalence differed across areas. Using available data on fatalities and population numbers, a combined IFR in patients <70 years is estimated at 89 per 100 000 (95% CI, 72-211) infections. CONCLUSIONS The IFR was estimated to be slightly lower than previously reported from other countries not using seroprevalence data. The IFR is likely severalfold lower than the current estimate. We have initiated real-time nationwide anti-SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence surveying of blood donations as a tool in monitoring the epidemic.","Erikstrup, Christian; Hother, Christoffer Egeberg; Pedersen, Ole Birger Vestager; Mølbak, Kåre; Skov, Robert Leo; Holm, Dorte Kinggaard; Sækmose, Susanne Gjørup; Nilsson, Anna Christine; Brooks, Patrick Terrence; Boldsen, Jens Kjærgaard; Mikkelsen, Christina; Gybel-Brask, Mikkel; Sørensen, Erik; Dinh, Khoa Manh; Mikkelsen, Susan; Møller, Bjarne Kuno; Haunstrup, Thure; Harritshøj, Lene; Jensen, Bitten Aagaard; Hjalgrim, Henrik; Lillevang, Søren Thue; Ullum, Henrik",Clinical infectious diseases : an official publication of the Infectious Diseases Society of America,https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciaa849; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33501969/,374

However, the full clinical spectrum of HRV infection in critically ill patients is not well characterized. OBJECTIVE To evaluate the clinical and virological characteristics of critically ill patients with HRV infection. STUDY DESIGN HRV-specific reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed on nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA) specimens from 294 adult patients who required admission into the intensive care unit (ICU). Clinical characteristics were analyzed. HRV genotyping using the 5'UTR-VP4-VP2 region was performed. RESULTS HRV was detected in NPA specimens of 22 patients (7.5%) by RT-PCR. Dyspnea was the most common presenting symptom (16/22; 72.7%), but seizure also occurred in 5 (22.7%) patients. Exacerbation of underlying disease occurred in 12 (54.5%) patients. Four (18.2%) patients died, and HRV was considered to play a role as the cause of death in 3 patients. Thirteen (59.1%) patients had pneumonia, and the most common radiological finding was consolidation (6/13; 46.2%). Streptococcus pneumoniae was the most common co-pathogen among patients with pneumonia. Among the 9 patients without pneumonia, 3 patients had exacerbation of underlying lung diseases, 3 patients had acute pulmonary edema, 2 patients with diabetes mellitus had acute complications from poor glycemic control, and 1 patient had status epilepticus.

However, the conformational pathway leading to the nucleation-competent state is unclear due to lack of high-resolution structures of the activated state. Here we report a ~3.9 Å resolution cryo-EM structure of activated Schizosaccharomyces pombe Arp2/3 complex bound to the S. pombe NPF Dip1 and attached to the end of the nucleated actin filament. The structure reveals global and local conformational changes that allow the two actin-related proteins in Arp2/3 complex to mimic a filamentous actin dimer and template nucleation. Activation occurs through a clamp-twisting mechanism, in which Dip1 forces two core subunits in Arp2/3 complex to pivot around one another, shifting half of the complex into a new activated position. By showing how Dip1 stimulates activation, the structure reveals how NPFs can activate Arp2/3 complex in diverse cellular processes.","Shaaban, Mohammed; Chowdhury, Saikat; Nolen, Brad J",Nature structural & molecular biology,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41594-020-0481-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32839613/,374

Potentially harmful substances are liberated when tissues are vaporized with laser. This creates numerous risks, including the spread of infectious disease. Smoke evacuators are devices that capture and filter laser plume, thereby maintaining a safe environment for the surgical team and patient. Our aim was to characterize the microbial community structure within the suction tube and funnel of the smoke evacuator system, identify their origin, and evaluate pathogenicity. Dust particles were collected from the instruments with a cotton swab. DNA was extracted from the swabs and the transport media, and sequencing was performed using the Illumina HiSeq Xplatform. Metagenomic analysis was conducted using the Empowering the Development of Genomics Expertise (EDGE) Bioinformatics pipeline and custom Python scripts. The most abundant bacterial species were Micrococcus luteus and Brevibacterium casei in the suction tube, and Dermacoccus sp. Ellin 185 and Janibacter hoylei in the suction funnel. A total of 15 medium- to high-quality metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) were constructed where we found 104 antibiotic-resistant genes (ARGs) and 741 virulence factors. Findings indicate that the suction tube and funnel are likely a reservoir of virulence factor genes and ARGs, which can possibly be passed on to other bacteria via horizontal gene transfer.

The lack of national policies for pandemic control forced state and municipal authorities to implement public health measures. The aim of this study is to show the effect of these measures on the epidemic. The highest incidence of COVID-19 among the nine states in the Northeast was recorded in Sergipe, Paraíba and Ceará. Piauí, Paraíba and Ceará were the states that most tested. Factors associated with transmission included the high proportion of people in informal work. States with international airports played an important role in the entry of the virus and the initial spread, especially Ceará. All states applied social distancing measures, banned public events and closed schools. The response was a significant increase in social distancing, especially in Ceará and Pernambuco, a decline in the reproduction rate (Rt), and a separation of the curve of observed cases versus expected cases if the non-pharmacological interventions had not been implemented in all states. Poverty, inequality, and the high rates of informal work provide clues to the intensity of COVID-19 in the region.

126164,ACE2: Its potential role and regulation in severe acute respiratory syndrome and COVID-19.,2020-09-09,"Porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) is an emerging swine enteropathogenic coronavirus. The nonstructural protein nsp5, also called 3C-like protease, is responsible for processing viral polyprotein precursors in coronavirus (CoV) replication. Previous studies have shown that PDCoV nsp5 cleaves the NF-κB essential modulator and the signal transducer and activator of transcription 2 to disrupt interferon (IFN) production and signaling, respectively. Whether PDCoV nsp5 also cleaves IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs), IFN-induced antiviral effector molecules, remains unclear. In this study, we screened 14 classical ISGs and found that PDCoV nsp5 cleaved the porcine mRNA-decapping enzyme 1a (pDCP1A) through its protease activity. Similar cleavage of endogenous pDCP1A was also observed in PDCoV-infected cells. PDCoV nsp5 cleaved pDCP1A at glutamine 343 (Q343) and the cleaved pDCP1A fragments, pDCP1A1-343 and pDCP1A344-580, could not inhibit PDCoV infection. Mutant pDCP1A-Q343A, which resists nsp5-mediated cleavage, exhibited a stronger ability to inhibit PDCoV infection compared with wild-type pDCP1A. Interestingly, the Q343 cleavage site is highly conserved in DCP1A homologs from other mammalian species. Further analyses demonstrated that nsp5 encoded by seven tested CoVs that can infect human or pig also cleaved pDCP1A and human DCP1A, suggesting that DCP1A maybe the common target for cleavage by nsp5 of mammalian CoVs.IMPORTANCE IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) induction through interferon (IFN) signaling is important to create an antiviral state and usually directly inhibits virus infection. The present study first demonstrated that PDCoV nsp5 can cleave mRNA-decapping enzyme 1a (DCP1A) to attenuate its antiviral activity. Furthermore, cleaving DCP1A is a common characteristic of nsp5 proteins from different coronaviruses (CoVs), which represents a common immune evasion mechanism of CoVs. Previous evidence showed that CoV nsp5 cleaves the NF-κB essential modulator and signal transducer and activator of transcription 2.

133864,The Trilogy of SARS-CoV-2 in Pediatrics (Part 2): Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children.,2021,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Cerebral large vessel occlusion (LVO) in acute ischemic stroke (AIS) may be complete (CLVO) or incomplete (ILVO). The influence of ILVO on clinical outcome after mechanical thrombectomy (MT) remains unclear. We investigated primarily the clinical outcome in patients with AIS due to ILVO or CLVO. METHODS Five hundred three consecutive AIS patients with LVO treated with stent-retriever or direct aspiration-based MT between 2010 and 2016 were analyzed. The primary endpoint was favorable clinical outcome (modified Rankin Scale ≤2) at 90 days; secondary endpoints were periprocedural parameters. RESULTS Forty-nine patients (11.3%) with a median National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) of 11 presented with ILVO and the remainder presented with CLVO and median NIHSS of 15 (p < 0.001). The median groin puncture-to-reperfusion time was 30 vs. 67 min, respectively (p < 0.001). Successful reperfusion was reached in 47 out of 49 ILVO (95.9%) vs. 298 out of 381 CLVO (78.2%; p < 0.005) with less retrieval maneuvers (1.7 ± 2.2 vs. 3.0 ± 2.5; p < 0.001). The favorable outcome at 90 days was 81% in patients with ILVO vs. 29.1% in CLVO (p < 0.001); respective all-cause mortality rates were 6.4 vs. 28.5% (p < 0.001). Periprocedural complications (6.9%) occurred exclusively in CLVO patients (p < 0.05). ILVO was associated with favorable clinical outcome independent of age and NIHSS in multivariate logistic regression both in the anterior (OR 3.6; 95% CI 1.8-6.9; p < 0.001) and posterior circulation (OR 3.5; 95% CI 1.8-6.9; p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS AIS due to ILVO is frequent and is associated with a nearly threefold higher chance of favorable clinical outcome at 90 days, independent of age and initial NIHSS compared to CLVO.","Maus, Volker; You, Seunghwa; Kalkan, Alev; Borggrefe, Jan; Kabbasch, Christoph; Barnikol, Utako Birgit; Stetefeld, Henning; Dohmen, Christian; Liebig, Thomas; Fink, Gereon Rudolf; Mpotsaris, Anastasios",Cerebrovascular diseases,https://doi.org/10.1159/000477499; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28605743/,374

This novel disease is mild in certain individuals, usually younger healthy individuals, whereas the elder and those with underlying health conditions develop severe symptoms and may die as a result of the disease or associated complications. Along with pneumonia, hypercytokinemia, also termed a cytokine storm, is one of the most common pathologies observed in patients with COVID-19. As patients react to the infection with the virus differently; in certain individuals, a cytokine storm may result in death. At present, there is no cure or widely available vaccine for the novel coronavirus. However, it has been hypothesized that mesenchymal stem cells may assist in the treatment/management of the cytokine storm due to their immunomodulating properties.","Çetin, İdil; Topçul, Mehmet",Biomedical reports,https://doi.org/10.3892/br.2020.1369; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33194191/,374

146457,Lack of peripheral memory B cell responses in recovered patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome: a six-year follow-up study.,2011,"Background Severe acute respiratory syndrome virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), likely a bat-origin coronavirus, spilled over from wildlife to humans in China in late 2019, manifesting as a respiratory disease. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) spread initially within China and then globally, resulting in a pandemic. Objective This article describes predictive modelling of COVID-19 in general, and efforts within the Public Health Agency of Canada to model the effects of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) on transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in the Canadian population to support public health decisions. Methods The broad objectives of two modelling approaches, 1) an agent-based model and 2) a deterministic compartmental model, are described and a synopsis of studies is illustrated using a model developed in Analytica 5.3 software. Results Without intervention, more than 70% of the Canadian population may become infected. Non-pharmaceutical interventions, applied with an intensity insufficient to cause the epidemic to die out, reduce the attack rate to 50% or less, and the epidemic is longer with a lower peak. If NPIs are lifted early, the epidemic may rebound, resulting in high percentages (more than 70%) of the population affected. If NPIs are applied with intensity high enough to cause the epidemic to die out, the attack rate can be reduced to between 1% and 25% of the population. Conclusion Applying NPIs with intensity high enough to cause the epidemic to die out would seem to be the preferred choice. Lifting disruptive NPIs such as shut-downs must be accompanied by enhancements to other NPIs to prevent new introductions and to identify and control any new transmission chains.","Ogden, Nick H; Fazil, Aamir; Arino, Julien; Berthiaume, Philippe; Fisman, David N; Greer, Amy L; Ludwig, Antoinette; Ng, Victoria; Tuite, Ashleigh R; Turgeon, Patricia; Waddell, Lisa A; Wu, Jianhong",Canada communicable disease report = Releve des maladies transmissibles au Canada,https://doi.org/10.14745/ccdr.v46i06a08; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32673384/,374

Design: Retrospective analysis of pulse oximeter saturation and arterial blood gas analysis obtained at arrival. Setting: Tertiary referral hospital in Mexico City converted early in the pandemic to a COVID-19 center. Patients and measurements: A total of 2,960 patients with suspected COVID-19 pneumonia were admitted to the emergency department from April 2020 until March 2021. Pulse oximeter saturation and arterial blood gas analysis was obtained in all of them. Pulse oximeter saturation (SpO2) to inspired oxygen fraction ratio (FiO2), oxygen saturation in arterial blood (SatO2) to FiO2 ratio, and oxygen pressure in arterial blood to FiO2 ratio were calculated for every patient. Interventions: None. Main Results: A strong correlation was seen between PaO2/FiO2 & SpO2/FiO2 (rho = 0.6, p < 0.001), and SatO2/FiO2 & SpO2/FiO2 (rho = 0.65, p < 0.001), while a very strong correlation was seen between PaO2/FiO2 & SatO2/FiO2 (rho = 0.88, p < 0.001). When classifying severity by quantiles, considerable cross-over was observed when comparing oxygenation indexes, as only 785 (26.5%) patients were in the same quintile across the three indexes. Conclusions: Hypoxemia severity is heterogeneous according to the oxygenation index utilized. This limits their usefulness as sole markers of severity, as inter-observer variability, especially on FiO2 estimation, and different practices limit consistent follow up and treatment decisions.","Nunez, I.; Soto-Mota, A.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.06.23.21259421v1?rss=1,374
184416,A retrospective study of 78 patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome.,2003,"Background: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is independently associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). One of the early stages of atherosclerosis is endothelial dysfunction, which is increased in RA. Using drugs to target endothelial dysfunction is a promising novel strategy for CVD prevention in RA. Sildenafil has been shown to improve endothelial function in diabetics, who have similar increased CVD risk. Our hypothesis was that sildenafil use may be a novel primary CVD prevention strategy in RA. Objectives: To determine if sildenafil use in RA patients improves endothelial dysfunction (as measured by brachial artery flow-mediated dilation [FMD] and peripheral arterial tone [PAT]), as well as serum inflammatory and atherosclerosis biomarkers. Methods: This NIH-funded study was a phase II, randomized double-blind placebo-controlled crossover efficacy trial of 25 RA patients, with no known history of CVD, but at least one traditional CVD risk factor. Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive either sildenafil or placebo for 3 months, then after a 2-week washout, crossed over to each respective group for an additional 3 months. Vascular studies (FMD and PAT) and serum atherosclerosis biomarkers (e-Selectin, ICAM-1, VCAM-1) were performed at baseline, 3 months pre-and post-washout, and 6 months. Adverse events were collected. Given the cross-over design, analyses included a random effects model for within-subject comparisons of sildenafil versus placebo periods, adjusting for the baseline (FMD or EndoPAT) within that period and a term for treatment order. All tests were 2-sided with α=0.05. Results: A total of 233 subjects were assessed for eligibility, with 25 subjects being randomized after written informed consent. A total of 13 subjects were randomized to placebo first, and 12 to sildenafil first. Baseline characteristics were similar between those randomized to Placebo vs. Sildenafil first. Mean age was 62.0+/-10.9 years;84% were female;and 92% were white. A total of 6 adverse events experienced in 3 subjects occurred. The primary endpoint (increase in %FMD in Sildenafil period vs. Placebo period) was not significant (p=0.19). However, note the study was powered at 80% to detect an effect size of 0.37 for change in %FMD or biomarker with a sample size of 60, not 25. However, sildenafil use was associated with a significant increase (improvement) by 0.200 units of PAT ratio (p=0.003) compared with placebo, adjusted by treatment order and baseline PAT ratio (within the given treatment period). Exploratory linear mixed models comparing e-Selectin, ICAM-1, and VCAM-1 between Sildenafil vs. Placebo periods, adjusted for treatment order and the baseline biomarker level, did not show any significant differences except for ICAM-1 (55.3 units higher in Sildenafil vs. Placebo periods, p=0.011). Conclusion: In this pilot trial of 25 RA subjects, sildenafil use was associated with a significant increase (improvement) in endothelial function as measured by PAT. However, there was no significant difference in FMD. The study is limited due to the small sample size, which was impacted by slow recruitment as well as the COVID-19 pandemic. Future larger studies are required to assess whether other PDE5 inhibitors may improve endothelial dysfunction in RA and other autoimmune disease patients at high risk of CVD.","Liang, K.; Landsittel, D.; Li, Y.; Hope, L.; Ruffalo, L.; Peat-Fircak, J.; Avolio, J.; Biswas, P.; Roth, E.; Simon, M.; Moreland, L.",Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases,https://doi.org/10.1136/annrheumdis-2021-eular.4069,374

185538,Prognostic significance of the radiographic pattern of disease in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome.,2004,"The goal of reducing the climate impact of shipping requires many different activities. To reduce greenhouse gas emissions, the International Maritime Organization prepared some proposals to meet and fulfill the requirements. It sets out the provisions of the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships 73/78 Annex 6—Prevention of the Air Pollution from Ships (1997) with the amendments and the future objectives set. The main objective is to achieve climate neutrality from shipping by 2050. One method is the decarbonization of marine fuels. The types of fuels that are transient fuels, with the final target fuel being hydrogen, are shown. Carbon dioxide emissions depend on the chemical composition of the fuel, its Lower Heating Value and the engine efficiency. The aim of the manuscript is to demonstrate that the use of fuels with lower carbon content is a transitional process enabling the hydrogen era to take place. An analysis of this problem is presented as a review of the subject along with the author’s comments and observations. The development of technologies for adapting potential fuels to combustion requirements in marine diesel engines and gas turbines, together with their storage and bunkering capabilities, are the main barriers to their limited use. The efficiency of marine diesel engines reaches a value of about 50%, while that of fuel cells are close to 100%. It seems that hydrogen will be the fuel of the future, including in shipping. Its basic use is in fuel cells, the efficiency of which is almost twice that of current thermal internal combustion engines.","Herdzik, Jerzy",Energies,https://doi.org/10.3390/en14144311,374

Methodology: In this context, this article seeks to measure and characterize the conversation about Covid-19 vaccines on the social network Twitter. To this end, 62,045 tweets and 258,843 retweets from supporters and opponents of the vaccine were analyzed between December 2020 and February 2021. Results: The start of the vaccination campaign was the turning point at which pro-vaccine discourse began to take precedence over anti-vaccine discourse. Antivaccine groups are characterized by being strongly cohesive clusters, with an appreciable level of activity, but with less capacity to viralize content. Conclusions and discussion: Anti-vaccine discourses tend to rely on alternative media or content shared on social networks, which corroborates that quality information is one of the main measures against disinformation. It also highlights the role of quality or legacy media and the desirability of further developing anti-disinformation policies specific to the type of digital conversation taking place on Twitter. © 2021, University of La Laguna.

The case begins with a video of neurologist Dr. V.S. Ramachandran interviewing two amputees who experience phantom limb pain (part one). Through Dr. Ramachandran's dialog with amputees, students learn about the paradoxical condition of feeling pain in a limb that does not exist (e.g., phantom limb pain). Students witness Dr. Ramachandran analyzing fMRI data from an amputee, and subsequently learn the somatosensory cortical mapping of the amputee has remarkably changed. Dr. Ramachandran also introduces and demonstrates one form of treatment for phantom limb pain, the mirror box. The video case is supplemented with optional opportunities for further exploration about the mirror box (part two) and somatosensory cortical mapping, via the two-point discrimination test (parts three and four). In part two, students use the primary literature to investigate the effectiveness of the mirror box, and practice skills of interpreting figures. In parts three and four, students conduct a two-point discrimination test (part three) on each other or a person in their residence and analyze class data (part four). Students are led to discover conceptual connections between all four parts of this module. As one example, students are challenged to predict how two-point discrimination data from amputees (interviewed in the video, part one) would compare to students' two-point discrimination data (parts three and four). While the four parts of this learning module are highly interconnected, instructors can choose to selectively implement one or more parts. In addition, each part can be executed in the face-to-face classroom, as out-of-classroom assignment, in a synchronous or non-synchronous video meeting platform, or as a hybrid of these options, providing flexibility for the instructor. This case has been used in a 100-level face-to-face, non-science major course and it has been modified as an online module for a 300 level General Physiology course.","Lemons, Michele L","Journal of undergraduate neuroscience education : JUNE : a publication of FUN, Faculty for Undergraduate Neuroscience",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34552442/,374

The lung itself is rarely sampled directly, and sputum representing lower-airway secretions can rarely be obtained from children. In addition culture of secretions from upper respiratory tract is not useful since the normal flora includes the bacteria commonly responsible for pneumonia. Clinical and radiology data only suggest the diagnosis. The development of techniques to detect antigens of the causative agent in nasopharyngeal secretions, nucleic acid by means of the polymerise-chain reaction assays has significantly improved the identification of the responsible pathogen and the choice of appropriate treatment.

187960,Severe acute respiratory syndrome: temporal lung changes at thin-section CT in 30 patients.,2004,"Mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), a member of the Coronaviridae, contains a polyadenylated positive-sense single-stranded genomic RNA which is 31 kb long. MHV replication and transcription take place via the synthesis of negative-strand RNA intermediates from a positive-strand genomic template. A cis-acting element previously identified in the 3' untranslated region binds to trans-acting host factors from mouse fibroblasts and forms at least three RNA-protein complexes. The largest RNA-protein complex formed by the cis-acting element and the lysate from uninfected mouse fibroblasts has a molecular weight of about 200 kDa. The complex observed in gel shift assays has been resolved by second-dimension sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis into four proteins of approximately 90, 70, 58, and 40 kDa after RNase treatment. Specific RNA affinity chromatography also has revealed the presence of a 90-kDa protein associated with RNA containing the cis-acting element bound to magnetic beads. The 90-kDa protein has been purified from uninfected mouse fibroblast crude lysates. Protein microsequencing identified the 90-kDa protein as mitochondrial aconitase. Antibody raised against purified mitochondrial aconitase recognizes the RNA-protein complex and the 90-kDa protein, which can be released from the complex by RNase digestion. Furthermore, UV cross-linking studies indicate that highly purified mitochondrial aconitase binds specifically to the MHV 3' protein-binding element. Increasing the intracellular level of mitochondrial aconitase by iron supplementation resulted in increased RNA-binding activity in cell extracts and increased virus production as well as viral protein synthesis at early hours of infection. These results are particularly interesting in terms of identification of an RNA target for mitochondrial aconitase, which has a cytoplasmic homolog, cytoplasmic aconitase, also known as iron regulatory protein 1, a well-recognized RNA-binding protein. The binding properties of mitochondrial aconitase and the functional relevance of RNA binding appear to parallel those of cytoplasmic aconitase.","Nanda, S K; Leibowitz, J L",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11238861/,374

190906,Acute renal failure in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome.,2005,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a highly contagious virus that infects humans and a number of animal species causing coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19), a respiratory distress syndrome which has provoked a global pandemic and a serious health crisis in most countries across our planet. COVID-19 inflammation is mediated by IL-1, a disease that can cause symptoms such as fever, cough, lung inflammation, thrombosis, stroke, renal failure and headache, to name a few. Strategies that inhibit IL-1 are certainly helpful in COVID-19 and can represent one of the therapeutic options. However, until now, COVID-19 therapy has been scarce and, in many cases, ineffective, since there are no specific drugs other than the vaccine that can solve this serious health problem. Messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines which are the newest approach, are already available and will certainly meet the many expectations that the population is waiting for. mRNA vaccines, coated with protected soft fatty lipids, use genetic mRNA (plus various inactive excipients) to make a piece of the coronavirus spike protein, which will instruct the immune system to produce specific antibodies. The soft fatty lipids allow the entry of mRNA into cells where it is absorbed into the cytoplasm and initiates the synthesis of the spike protein. In addition, vaccination also activates T cells that help the immune system respond to further exposure to the coronavirus. mRNA induces the synthesis of antigens of SARS-CoV-2 virus which stimulate the antibody response of the vaccinated person with the production of neutralizing antibodies. The new variant of the coronavirus-19 has been detected in the UK where, at the moment, the London government has imposed a lockdown with restrictions on international movements. The virus variant had already infected 1/4 of the total cases and in December 2020, it reached 2/3 of those infected in the UK. It has been noted that the spreading rate of the British variant could be greater than 70% of cases compared to the normal SARS-CoV-2 virus, with an R index growth of 0.4. Recent studies suggest that coronavirus-19 variation occurs at the level N501Y of the spike protein and involves 23 separate mutations on the spike, 17 of which are linked to the virus proteins, thus giving specific characteristics to the virus. In general, coronaviruses undergo many mutations that are often not decisive for their biological behavior and does not significantly alter the structure and the components of the virus. This phenomenon also occurs in SARS-CoV-2. It is highly probable that the variants recently described in the UK will not hinder vaccine-induced immunity. In fact, the variant will not break the vaccine although it may have some chance of making it a little less effective. Therefore, it is pertinent to think that the vaccine will work against the SARS-CoV-2 variant as well. In today's pandemic, the D614G mutation of the amino acid of corronavirus-19, which emerged in Europe in February 2020 is the most frequent form and causes high viral growth. The previously infrequent D614G mutation is now globally dominant. This variant, which is being tested by many international laboratories, is rapidly spreading across the countries and a series of vaccinated subjects are testing to see if their antibodies can neutralize the new variant of SARS-CoV-2. This variant has a very high viral growth and is less detectable with the RT-PCR technique in the laboratory. It has been reported that the British variant that increases viral load does not cause more severe effects in the respiratory tract and lung disease, therefore, it is certain that the variant is growing rapidly and must be kept under control; for this reason, laboratory data is expected impatiently. The study on the many variants that coronavirus-19 presents is very interesting and complete and clearer data on this topic will be ready in the near future. In addition, it is still unclear whether the different variants discovered in many countries, including Africa, share the same spike protein mutation and therefore, this is another study to elaborate on. In order to be certain and to not have unexpected surprises, we need to reduce the spread and the transmission speed of viral variants that could appear around the world, creating new pandemics. For this reason, the scientific community is on the alert since laboratory tests on serum antibodies from COVID-19 survivors have been reported to be less effective in attacking the variant. In light of the above, the scientific community must be on the alert as larger variants of the spike protein could escape vaccine-induced antibodies, which for now are of great help to the community and can save millions of lives. Deepening the study of spike protein mutations will help to better understand how to combat coronavirus-19 and its variants.","Conti, P; Caraffa, Al; Gallenga, C E; Kritas, S K; Frydas, I; Younes, A; Di Emidio, P; Tetè, G; Pregliasco, F; Ronconi, G",Journal of biological regulators and homeostatic agents,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33377359/,374
191284,Early clinical predictors of severe acute respiratory syndrome in the emergency department.,2004,"In this work we have shown that astrovirus infection induces apoptosis of Caco-2 cells, since fragmentation of cellular DNA, cleavage of cellular proteins which are substrate of activated caspases, and a change in the mitochondrial transmembrane potential occur upon virus infection. The human astrovirus Yuc8 polyprotein capsid precursor VP90 is initially processed to yield VP70, and we have shown that this processing is trypsin independent and occurs intracellularly through four cleavages at its carboxy-terminal region. We further showed that VP90-VP70 processing is mediated by caspases, since it was blocked by the pancaspase inhibitor benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp fluoromethylketone (z-VAD-fmk), and it was promoted by the apoptosis inducer TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL). Although the cell-associated virus produced in the presence of these compounds was not affected, the release of infectious virus to the cell supernatant was drastically reduced in the presence of z-VAD-fmk and increased by TRAIL, indicating that VP90-VP70 cleavage is important for the virus particles to be released from the cell. This is the first report that describes the induction and utilization of caspase activity by a virus to promote processing of the capsid precursor and dissemination of the viral particles.","Méndez, Ernesto; Salas-Ocampo, Elizabeth; Arias, Carlos F",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15280469/,374

194986,"Outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome in southern Taiwan, 2003.",2005,"The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence and seasonal distribution of respiratory viruses in pediatric and adult outpatients and inpatients who were admitted to hospital with the symptoms of upper and lower respiratory tract infections, during a 12-year period. A total of 5102 clinical samples (4372 nasopharyngeal swabs, 316 bronchoalveolar lavages, 219 transtracheal aspirates, 163 nasopharyngeal aspirates, 20 sputum, 10 nasal swabs) examined in our laboratory between January 1st 2002 and July 17th 2014, were evaluated retrospectively. Of the specimens, 1107 (21.7%) were obtained from outpatients and 3995 (78.3%) from hospitalized patients. Of the patients, 2851 (55.9%) were male and 2251 (44.1%) were female, while 1233 (24.2%) were adults and 3869 (75.8%) were children (age range: 1 day - 93 years; median: 3 years). Respiratory samples were investigated for the presence of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza virus type A and B (INF-A, INF-B), adenovirus (AdV), parainfluenza viruses (PIV types 1-4), human rhinoviruses (HRV), human coronaviruses (HCoV), human metapneumovirus (HMPV) and human bocavirus (HBoV). All specimens were tested by both direct immunofluorescence antibody (DFA) and shell vial cell culture (SVCC) methods. In DFA assay the samples were initially screened by fluorescent-labeled polyclonal antibodies, and the positive ones were typed by using monoclonal antibodies (Light Diagnostics, Merck Millipore, USA). In SVCC, HEp-2, MDCK, A-549 and Vero cell lines were used for the isolation of viruses. In addition to these methods, real-time multiplex PCR methods (RealAccurate®, Respiratory RT PCR, PathoFinder, Netherlands and Seeplex® RV15 ACE Detection, Seegene, South Korea) were used for the detection of respiratory viruses in samples (n= 2104) obtained from 2007 to 2014. Respiratory viruses were detected in a total of 1705 (33.4%) patients, of them 967 (19%) were male and 738 (14.4%) were female. Three hundred and eighteen (18.6%) of the 1705 patients were infected with multiple respiratory viruses. The most frequently observed co-infections were RSV+INF-A (40/318; 12.6%), and RSV+PIV (33/318; 10.4%). The rate of positivity for the respiratory viruses in pediatric and adult groups were 35.4% (1369/3869) and 27.3% (336/1233), respectively (p< 0.000). The most frequently detected virus in pediatric group was RSV (336/1369; 24.5%), followed by influenza viruses (314/1369; 22.9%), PIV (197/1369; 14.4%), HRV (118/1369; 8.6%), AdV (75/1369; 5.5%) and the others (49/1369; 3.6%). On the other hand the most frequently detected virus in adult group was influenza viruses (181/336; 53.8%) followed by AdV (37/336; 11%), RSV (24/336; 7.1%), PIV (24/336; 7.1%), HRV (23/336; 6.8%) and the others (9/336; 2.7%). The rate of multiple virus infections in pediatric and adult groups were 7.2% (280/3869) and 3% (38/1233), respectively. Most of the coinfections (280/318; 88%) were detected in children. Respiratory viruses were detected positive in 40.2% (445/1107) of outpatients, and in 31.5% (1260/3995) of inpatients (p< 0.000). The most frequent viruses detected in pediatric outpatients and inpatients were HRV and RSV, respectively, while influenza viruses were the first in line among both adult outpatients and inpatients. During the study period, a PIV-3 outbreak (n= 96) have emerged between December 2004-April 2005, and an influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 outbreak (n= 207) between November 2009-January 2010. When the seasonal distribution was considered, the isolation rates of 1705 respiratory viruses in winter, spring, summer and autumn were 44.4%, 27%, 8.3% and 20.3%, respectively. RSV was most frequently detected from December to March, influenza viruses from November to March, HRV from December to June, and mixed infections from January to February. In conclusion, the data of our study obtained in about 12-year period indicated that the prevalence of respiratory viruses in acute respiratory infections is 33.4%, and they typically active during the months of winter and early spring in our region.","Çiçek, Candan; Arslan, Ayşe; Karakuş, Haydar Soydaner; Yalaz, Mehmet; Saz, Eylem Ulaş; Pullukçu, Hüsnü; Çok, Gürsel",Mikrobiyoloji bulteni,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26167819/,374
195121,Clinical characteristics of fatal patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome in a medical center in Taipei.,2003,"Translational readthrough-promoting drugs enhance the incorporation of amino acids at stop codons and can thus bypass premature termination during protein synthesis. The polymerase (Pol) proteins of Moloney murine leukemia virus (MoMLV) are synthesized as a large Gag–Pol fusion protein, formed by the readthrough of a stop codon at the end of the gag ORF. The downstream pol ORF lacks its own start codon, and Pol protein synthesis is wholly dependent on translation of the upstream gag gene and the readthrough event for expression. Here, we explored the effects of readthrough-promoting drugs – aminoglycoside antibiotics and the small molecule ataluren – on the efficiency of readthrough of the stop codon in the context of the MoMLV genome. We showed that these compounds increased readthrough of the stop codon at the MoMLV gag–pol junction in vivo above the already high basal level and that the resulting elevated gag–pol readthrough had deleterious effects on virus replication. We also showed that readthrough efficiency could be driven to even higher levels in vitro, and that the combination of the small molecules and the RNA structure at the MoMLV stop codon could achieve extremely high readthrough efficiencies.","Green, Lisa; Goff, Stephen P",The Journal of general virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26382736/,374

The discovery of this virus was soon followed by the discovery of the civet and bat SARS-CoV and the human coronaviruses NL63 and HKU1. Surveillance of coronaviruses in many animal species has increased the number on the list of coronaviruses to at least 36. The explosive nature of the first SARS epidemic, the high mortality, its transient reemergence a year later, and economic disruptions led to a rush on research of the epidemiological, clinical, pathological, immunological, virological, and other basic scientific aspects of the virus and the disease. This research resulted in over 4,000 publications, only some of the most representative works of which could be reviewed in this article. The marked increase in the understanding of the virus and the disease within such a short time has allowed the development of diagnostic tests, animal models, antivirals, vaccines, and epidemiological and infection control measures, which could prove to be useful in randomized control trials if SARS should return. The findings that horseshoe bats are the natural reservoir for SARS-CoV-like virus and that civets are the amplification host highlight the importance of wildlife and biosecurity in farms and wet markets, which can serve as the source and amplification centers for emerging infections.","Cheng, Vincent C C; Lau, Susanna K P; Woo, Patrick C Y; Yuen, Kwok Yung",Clinical microbiology reviews,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17934078/,374

Several biomarkers have been proposed to predict COVID-19 severity, but no definite interpretative criteria have been established to date for stratifying risk. Objective: To evaluate six serum biomarkers (C-reactive protein, lactate dehydrogenase, D-dimer, albumin, ferritin and cardiac troponin T) for predicting COVID-19 severity and to define related cut-offs able to aid clinicians in risk stratification of hospitalized patients. Design: A retrospective study of 427 COVID-19 patients was performed. Patients were divided into groups based on their clinical outcome: non-survivors vs. survivors and patients admitted to intensive care unit vs. others. ROC curves and likelihood ratios were employed to define predictive cut-offs for evaluated markers. Results: Marker concentrations at peak were significantly different between groups for both selected outcomes. At univariate logistic regression analysis, all parameters were significantly associated with higher odds of death and intensive care. At the multivariate analysis, high concentrations of lactate dehydrogenase and low concentrations of albumin in serum remained significantly associated with higher odds of death, while only low lactate dehydrogenase activities remained associated with lower odds of intensive care admission. The best cut-offs for death prediction were >731 U/L for lactate dehydrogenase and &#8804;18 g/L for albumin, while a lactate dehydrogenase activity <425 U/L was associated with a negative likelihood ratio of 0.10 for intensive treatment. Conclusions: Our study identifies which biochemistry tests represent major predictors of COVID-19 severity and defines the best cut-offs for their use.","Aloisio, Elena; Chibireva, Mariia; Serafini, Ludovica; Pasqualetti, Sara; Falvella, Felicia S; Dolci, Alberto; Panteghini, Mauro",Arch. pathol. lab. med.

How is this affected by demographic factors (such as gender)? What is the best age at which to immunize? Besides, although age-dependent mortality risk is estimated to be higher for men and older people, such interpretation across gender, age groups, and countries, however, must be accepted with caution at present Summary: COVID-19 has taught us that health is the basis of global wealth and international solidarity is an essential response and a superior approach to isolationism Hence, we must be clear about what the alternatives are when evaluating the merits of different ways of tackling this pandemic both in the short term as well as in the long term","Sisay, T.; Tolessa, T.",Risk Management &amp; Healthcare Policy,,374

Here, we contribute to the growing body of literature on emerging variants by evaluating the impact of single mutations on the overall antigenicity of selected variants and their binding to the ACE2 receptor. We observe a differential contribution of single mutants to the global variants phenotype related to ACE2 interaction and antigenicity. Using biolayer interferometry, we observe that enhanced ACE2 interaction is mostly modulated by a decrease in off-rate. Finally, we made the interesting observation that the Spikes from tested emerging variants bind better to ACE2 at 37{degrees}C compared to the D614G variant.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: In-hospital patients confirmed COVID-19 from January 18, 2020, to March 7, 2020, were retrospectively enrolled. PA trunk diameters on admission and death events were collected to calculate the optimum cutoff using a receiver operating characteristic curve. According to the cutoff, the subjects on admission were divided into two groups. Then the in-hospital various parameters were compared between the two groups to assess the predictive value of PA trunk diameter. RESULTS: In the 180 enrolled in-hospital patients (46.99 ± 14.95 years; 93 (51.7%) female, 14 patients (7.8%) died during their hospitalization. The optimum cutoff PA trunk diameter to predict in-hospital mortality was > 29 mm with a sensitivity of 92.59% and a specificity of 91.11%. Kaplan-Meier survival curves for PA trunk diameter on admission showed that a PA trunk diameter > 29 mm was a significant predictor of subsequent death (log-rank < 0.001, median survival time of PA > 29 mm was 28 days). CONCLUSION: PA trunk enlargement can be a useful predictive factor for distinguishing between mild and severe COVID-19 disease progression.","Zhu, Qing-Qing; Gong, Tao; Huang, Guo-Quan; Niu, Zhong-Feng; Yue, Ting; Xu, Fang-Yi; Chen, Chao; Wang, Guang-Bin",Jpn. j. radiol.

KD has been described in association with dengue, scrub typhus and leptospirosis. However, MIS-C with concomitant infection has rarely been reported in literature. A 14-year-old-girl presented with fever and rash with history of redness of eyes, lips and tongue. Investigations showed anemia, lymphopenia, thrombocytosis with elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, pro-brain natriuretic peptide, Interleukin-6, ferritin and d-dimer. Scrub typhus immunoglobulin M was positive. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) immunoglobulin G (IgG) level was also elevated. A diagnosis of MIS-C with concomitant scrub typhus was proffered. Child received azithromycin, intravenous immunoglobulin and methylprednisolone. After an afebrile period of 2.5 days, child developed unremitting fever and rash. Repeat investigations showed anemia, worsening lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, transaminitis, hypertriglyceridemia, hyperferritinemia and hypofibrinogenemia which were consistent with a diagnosis of macrophage activation syndrome (MAS). KD, MIS-C and MAS represent three distinct phenotypes of hyperinflammation seen in children during coronavirus disease pandemic. Several tropical infections may mimic or coexist with MIS-C which can be a diagnostic challenge for the treating physician. Identification of coexistence or differentiation between the two conditions is important in countries with high incidence of tropical infections to guide appropriate investigations and treatment.","Gupta, Aman; Gill, Arpinder",J. trop. pedriatr,,374
220755,Response to Dudoignon et al,2020,"This study, emerging from a larger, longitudinal research project, reports about a cohort (n = 13) of beginning teachers’ professional agency and resilience during the COVID-19 pandemic. From the social-ecological perspective, the participants perceived their professional agency as both temporal and relational phenomena by interacting within their current circumstances. The participants’ professional agency focused on facilitating students’ online learning. Meanwhile, the participants strove to achieve four types of resilience, i.e. personal, professional, institutional and community. These types of resilience supported their capacity to remain committed to learning to teach during the pandemic. Implications for facilitating teachers’ professional agency and resilience are discussed.

220781,Immune dysregulation and autoreactivity correlate with disease severity in SARS-CoV-2-associated multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children,2021,"OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to understand the relationship between resource gains and losses, coping, and the quality of life during the growth phase of the COVID­19 pandemic. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The Internet-based survey covered 353 individuals who had participated in a psychological support project operated by one of the non-governmental organizations in Lublin, Poland, in the 12 months prior to the outbreak of the pandemic. The questionnaire used in the study contained questions to collect sociodemographic data and psychometric scales to measure resource gains and losses (the Conservation of Resources - Evaluation questionnaire), the quality of life (the World Health Organization Quality of Life-BREF), and strategies of coping with the pandemic situation (a modified Brief Coping Orientation to Problems Experienced questionnaire). RESULTS: A higher global quality of life occurred with higher gains and minor losses, as well as with coping through planning, positive reframing, emotional support seeking, a reduced substance use tendency, low self-blame, avoidance, and disengagement. Moreover, helplessness-based coping strategies were found to mediate both the relationships between resource gains and the quality of life, and between resource losses and the quality of life. CONCLUSIONS: Factors that may reduce people's quality of life during the COVID­19 pandemic are an increase in losses and limited gains, experienced over the 6 months preceding the pandemic, as well as not using active, meaning-oriented, and support-seeking coping strategies, but using avoidance behaviors instead. Coping strategies specific to people experiencing helplessness are a mediating mechanism between losses and limited gains of resources, and the quality of life.

We aim to develop a model from a small number of countries to predict the epidemic alert level in all the countries worldwide. Methods: The ""interest over time"" and ""interest by region"" Google Trends data of Coronavirus, pneumonia, and six COVID symptom-related terms were searched. The daily incidence of COVID-19 from 10 January to 23 April 2020 of 202 countries was retrieved from the World Health Organization. Three alert levels were defined. Ten weeks' data from 20 countries were used for training with machine learning algorithms. The features were selected according to the correlation and importance. The model was then tested on 2830 samples of 202 countries. Results: Our model performed well in 154 (76.2%) countries, of which each had no more than four misclassified samples. In these 154 countries, the accuracy was 0.8133, and the kappa coefficient was 0.6828. While in all 202 countries, the accuracy was 0.7527, and the kappa coefficient was 0.5841. The proposed algorithm based on Random Forest Classification and nine features performed better compared to other machine learning methods and the models with different numbers of features. Conclusions: Our result suggested that the model developed from 20 countries with Google Trends data and Random Forest Classification can be applied to predict the epidemic alert levels of most countries worldwide.","Peng, Yuanyuan; Li, Cuilian; Rong, Yibiao; Chen, Xinjian; Chen, Haoyu",J Glob Health,,374

Despite his recommendation to remove the water pump handle and thus reduce the spread of cholera, his theory of faecal-oral transmission was not widely believed until after his death. Furthermore, he also pioneered substantial achievements in the development of anaesthesia. He studied both chloroform and ether, improving the accuracy of their delivery. In his obstetric practice, he achieved the feat of obtaining satisfactory analgesia with a safer technique and is remembered for administering chloroform to Queen Victoria, during the delivery of her last two children. There are several interesting and unusual memorials to Snow, ranging from replica water pumps, blue plaques and a public house named after him. The most recent new memorial was erected in 2017, in his home town of York, which commemorates his origins and his subsequent contribution to curbing the cholera outbreak. All the memorials commemorate his achievements, which remain relevant today.

OBJECTIVE: To compare clinical, perinatal outcomes of women with COVID-19 from high-income countries (HICs) and low- to middle-income countries (LMICs). SEARCH STRATEGY: Online databases were searched. SELECTION CRITERIA: Original studies on pregnant women with COVID-19 were included. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Information on clinical presentation, co-morbidities, pregnancy outcomes, neonatal outcomes, and SARS-CoV-2 infection in neonates was extracted. MAIN RESULTS: The pooled estimate of SARS-CoV-2 positive neonates is 3.7%. Symptomatic presentations are less common in LMICs compared to HICs (odds ratio [OR] 0.38). Diabetes (OR 0.5), hypertension (OR 0.5), and asthma (OR 0.14) are commonly reported from HICs; hypothyroidism (OR 2.2), anemia (OR 3.2), and co-infections (OR 6.0) are commonly reported in LMICs. The overall risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes is higher in LMICs compared to HICs (OR 2.4). Abortion (OR 6.2), stillbirths (OR 2.0), and maternal death (OR 7.8) are more common in LMICs. Preterm births and premature rupture of membranes are comparable in both groups. Neonatal deaths (OR 3.7), pneumonia (OR 7.5), and neonatal SARS-CoV-2 infection (OR 1.8) are commonly reported in LMICs.

We use longitudinal data with municipal-level information and check the robustness of our estimates to several sources of bias, including spatial dependence, reverse causality, and time-variant omitted variables. We use exogenous climate shocks as instruments for social distancing since people are more likely to stay home in wetter and colder periods. Our findings suggest that the health benefits of social distancing differ by levels of municipal development and may have vanished if the COVID-19 spread was not controlled in neighboring municipalities. In turn, we did not find evidence that municipalities with tougher social distancing performed worse economically. Our results also highlight that estimates that do not account for endogeneity may largely underestimate the benefits of social distancing on reducing the spread of COVID-19.","Maia, A.

In our descriptive analysis, we compare well-being during this period with a pre-crisis period for different groups. In a difference-in-differences design, we compare the change for individuals with children to the change for individuals without children, accounting for unrelated trends as well as potential survey mode and context effects. We find that the crisis lowered the relative well-being of individuals with children, especially for individuals with young children, for women, and for persons with lower secondary schooling qualifications.

As one of the most versatile and amenable specimen options, saliva offers great advantages for widespread screening strategies due to its non-invasive properties, cost-effectiveness, excellent stability and minimal risk of cross-infection. This review attempts to outline the scientific rationale for detection of SARS-COV-2 in saliva specimens. By combining the data obtained from ten chosen published clinical studies, we calculated the pooled sensitivity and specificity using an online calculator. Through evidence, we established that SARS-COV-2 is detectable in saliva with a high degree of diagnostic sensitivity (87%) and specificity (98%). We also presented a review of emerging technologies approved by the FDA for detection of SARS-COV-2 in oral fluids (saliva and sputum) using polymerase chain reaction methods. Given the challenges involved in obtaining invasive specimens from the naso- and oropharynx, saliva can serve as an easy to collect diagnostic specimen for screening in the work environment, schools and for home testing. Furthermore, saliva offers the opportunity to screen early cases that can be missed by invasive sampling.","Warsi, Ibrahim Khurshid Zohaib Shazam Hamda Umer Muhammad Farooq Imran Eisha Khan Muhammad Owais Slowey Paul Desmond Goodson J.

251214,Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children Related to SARS-CoV-2,2021,"The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic represents a significant risk to population health. Health organizations worldwide have recommended numerous preventive health behaviors to slow the spread of COVID-19. Yet, considerable variability exists in individual-level adherence to these recommendations. Mindfulness has been associated with greater engagement in health promotive behavior (e.g., physical activity, healthy eating), and may serve as an individual difference factor that encourages adherence. However, no study to date has examined the extent to which mindfulness is associated with preventive health behaviors during a global pandemic. The purpose of the present study was to assess the relations between mindfulness and recommended preventive health behaviors for COVID-19. A national U.S. sample (N = 353; M age = 41.47 years, range: 19-84; 50.2% female) completed an online survey via Amazon's Mechanical Turk from April 3rd to 15th, 2020, including measures of mindfulness and frequency of avoiding touching one's face, handwashing, disinfecting/cleaning frequently used surfaces, social distancing, and self-quarantining. Personality, health risk, and demographic factors were also assessed to test the unique association between mindfulness and preventive health behaviors. Mindfulness was significantly correlated with greater engagement in all of the COVID-19 preventive health behaviors. However, when accounting for demographics, health risk, and personality, mindfulness was only uniquely associated with engagement in social distancing.

A return to pre-pandemic ""normalcy"" depends on the successful delivery of the vaccine to a majority (~70%) so as to develop herd immunity critical to arrest the community spread of infection. Vaccination against COVID-19 is particularly important for dentistry as the dental team works in an environment replete with aerosol-generating procedures (AGP) that facilitate virus spread. Hence, a COVID-19 vaccine is likely to be an obligatory requirement for the dental practice, and the latest addition to the extensive list of vaccines required for dental professionals for the safe delivery of dental care. Here, we review the currently available major candidate vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 and their benefits and risks. These include the vaccines developed on next-generation platforms (mRNA, DNA, and viral vector vaccines), and the classic platforms (the live-attenuated virus, and the protein subunit vaccines) The review concludes with a summary of impending issues and challenges facing the provision of COVID-19 vaccines for all stakeholders in dentistry.","Samaranayake, Lakshman Perera; Seneviratne, Chaminda Jayampath; Fakhruddin, Kausar Sadia",Oral dis,,374
256806,Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 Pneumonia in a Newborn Treated With Remdesivir and Coronavirus Disease 2019 Convalescent Plasma,2021,"The Japanese immunization program has made considerable progress since 2009: several new vaccines have been introduced and most are included in the National Immunization Program (NIP). In October 2020, the Japanese law on immunization was revised, which resulted in a few laudable achievements. First, rotavirus vaccines were added to the NIP, 10 years after their introduction, and noteworthy studies of vaccine effectiveness and the incidence of intussusception in Japanese children were published. Second, rules on vaccine intervals-which had been a longstanding concern-were withdrawn. In addition to this revision of the law, the Japanese version of the Vaccine Information Statement (VIS) was released by the Japan Pediatric Society in 2018. The VIS provides useful caregiver information on general immunization concepts and individual vaccines. Further challenges for the Japanese immunization program include (1) administering a booster dose of pertussis-containing vaccine to preschool children or teenagers, (2) reestablishing the active recommendation for human papilloma virus vaccines, (3) adding the mumps and influenza vaccines to the NIP, and (4) ensuring optimal dosing of seasonal influenza vaccines. During the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, vaccination rates among children have been decreasing in many countries. In Japan, vaccination rates have been stable in infants, but declining among toddlers and school-aged children, despite public awareness of the need for timely administration of vaccines during the pandemic. Clearly, further action is needed if we are to adequately protect children living in Japan from vaccine-preventable diseases.","Saitoh, Akihiko; Okabe, Nobuhiko",Vaccine,,374

260112,A Paucity of Outcomes,2021,"Nowadays, in the context of the coronavirus crisis, the issue of ensuring the sustainable development of heavy industries is acute. However, theoretical and analytical researches alone are not sufficient for this, and economic science needs to develop fundamentally new approaches to the study of the development of industrial sectors. This article is devoted to the creation and testing of a simulation model for the development of individual sectors of the economy. The object of research is the metallurgical industry, as well as related ore mining, mechanical engineering and production of finished metal products. The theoretical basis of the research is a systematic approach that combines the theory of industry markets, economic growth, industrial economics, system dynamics and mathematical economics. The main research methods used are system analysis, statistical analysis to identify trends in changes in the main economic indicators, econometric modeling to build production functions, as well as mathematical modeling of macroeconomic systems. As a result, a simulation model developed in system dynamics notation is proposed, which makes it possible to evaluate the development of individual industries taking into account various changes. This model is built on the basis of the three-sector model of the national economy, where separate adjacent industries connected by dynamic feedback loops are identified as structural elements. The paper details the structure of the simulation model based on first-order dynamic equations, balance equations and nonlinear production functions. The simulation model allowed us to predict a number of scenarios for the development of metallurgical industries, taking into account changes in the labor force and investment in fixed assets. The results of the work can be used for forming proposals on industrial policy, monitoring the condition and efficiency of individual industries. © 2021 National Research University, Higher School of Econoimics.

261461,"Presentation, Treatment Response and Short-Term Outcomes in Paediatric Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome Temporally Associated with SARS-CoV-2 (PIMS-TS)",2020,"Sars-Cov-2 or Novel coronavirus infection (COVID-19) has become a global challenge, affecting elderly population at large, causing a burden on hospitals. It has been affecting the world from a health and economic perspective after its emergence since October 2019 at Wuhan province of China. Later on it became a pandemic, with aged people most affected. Surprisingly, the infants and children were not severely infected and mortality among them was reported infrequently. If they died it was due to some comorbidity or congenital heart problems. Why the rate of infection varies in different age groups around the world and what is the protective mechanism in children remains a mystery. Based on our neuropathological experience at the ""Lino Rossi Research Center for the study and prevention of the unexpected perinatal death and Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS)"" of the University of Milan, Italy, we hypothesize that the decreased severity of the disease in infants compared to the elderly may be due to alteration at neurotransmitter levels especially of the Substance P (SP) and of the spinal trigeminal nucleus in the brainstem that is responsible for its secretion. This neurotransmitter may be directly related to the respiratory illness as is in COVID-19 infection. It is responsible for the increased inflammation and the characteristic symptoms associated with this disease. It is the main switch that must be urgently turned off using the NK-1R antagonist which is the receptor of SP and responsible for its functionality, especially in the elderly.","Mehboob, Riffat; Lavezzi, Anna Maria",J Neurol Sci,,374

267622,SARS-CoV-2-associated multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children: clinical manifestations and the role of infliximab treatment,2021,"The antiviral protein kinase R (PKR) is an important host restriction factor, which poxviruses must overcome to productively infect host cells. To inhibit PKR, many poxviruses encode a pseudosubstrate mimic of the alpha subunit of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 (eIF2), designated K3 in vaccinia virus. Although the interaction between PKR and eIF2&#945; is highly conserved, some K3 orthologs from host-restricted poxviruses were previously shown to inhibit PKR in a species-specific manner. To better define this host range function, we compared the sensitivity of PKR from 17 mammals to inhibition by K3 orthologs from closely related orthopoxviruses, a genus with a generally broader host range. The K3 orthologs showed species-specific inhibition of PKR and exhibited three distinct inhibition profiles. In some cases, PKR from closely related species showed dramatic differences in their sensitivity to K3 orthologs. Vaccinia virus expressing the camelpox virus K3 ortholog replicated more than three orders of magnitude better in human and sheep cells than a virus expressing vaccinia virus K3, but both viruses replicated comparably well in cow cells. Strikingly, in site-directed mutagenesis experiments between the variola virus and camelpox virus K3 orthologs, we found that different amino acid combinations were necessary to mediate improved or diminished inhibition of PKR derived from different host species. Because there is likely a limited number of possible variations in PKR that affect K3-interactions but still maintain PKR/eIF2&#945; interactions, it is possible that by chance PKR from some potential new hosts may be susceptible to K3-mediated inhibition from a virus it has never previously encountered. We conclude that neither the sensitivity of host proteins to virus inhibition nor the effectiveness of viral immune antagonists can be inferred from their phylogenetic relatedness but must be experimentally determined.","Park, Chorong; Peng, Chen; Rahman, M Julhasur; Haller, Sherry L; Tazi, Loubna; Brennan, Greg; Rothenburg, Stefan",PLoS Pathog,,374

OBJECTIVE: To rapidly identify areas of need and improve care in people with PD during the COVID-19 pandemic, we deployed a survey to assess COVID-19 symptoms and the pandemic's effect among those with and without COVID-19. METHODS: People with and without PD participating in the online study Fox Insight (FI) were invited to complete a survey between April 23 and May 23, 2020. Among people reporting COVID-19 diagnoses, we compared symptoms and outcomes in people with and without PD. Among people not reporting COVID-19, we assessed access to healthcare and services and PD symptoms. RESULTS: 7,209/9,762 active FI users responded (approximately 74% response rate), 5,429 people with PD and 1,452 without PD. COVID-19 diagnoses were reported by 51 people with and 26 without PD. Complications were more frequent in people with longer PD duration. People with PD and COVID-19 experienced new or worsening motor (63%) and nonmotor (75%) symptoms. People with PD not diagnosed with COVID-19 reported disrupted medical care (64%), exercise (21%), and social activities (57%), and worsened motor (43%) and non-motor (52%) symptoms. Disruptions were more common for those living alone, with lower income and non-White race. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic is associated with wide-ranging effects on people with PD, and certain groups may be at particular risk. FI provides a rapid, patient-centered means to assess these effects and identify needs that can be used to improve the health of people with PD.","Brown, Ethan G; Chahine, Lana M; Goldman, Samuel M; Korell, Monica; Mann, Emerald; Kinel, Daniel R; Arnedo, Vanessa; Marek, Kenneth L; Tanner, Caroline M",J Parkinsons Dis,,374

283700,Mitigating Misinformation and Changing the Social Narrative,2020,"ABSTRACT Since December 2019, the world has been fighting the SARS-CoV2 virus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2). Little is known about vaccines and forms of treatment at this point. However, the importance of preventing transmission is very clear, and one of the main measures is social isolation. Major sports tournaments, including soccer championships, have been suspended or cancelled due to COVID-19, on the grounds of our understanding of the importance of social isolation. Accordingly, large clubs have handed over their stadiums for the construction of field hospitals, and have encouraged health care by providing guidance on hygiene and social distancing. The involvement of soccer in the prevention of this pandemic is due to the fact that its managers understand the importance of this sport in the process, and its influence on fans and players. Over the years, soccer has incorporated scientific and technological knowledge into the game, which has frequently served as a role model for other types of sport and for the population. Therefore, in these extreme times of the COVID-19 pandemic, there is no reason to believe it would be any different, and standpoints taken by soccer teams serve as an example and reiterate their role in the educational commitment to society and respect for government authorities. As a result, a protocol was drawn up for the resumption of training, in which all recommendations to be followed by players, managers/backroom staff and employees are in accordance with official health agencies of the national and international government. In other words, the resumption of training is subject to the authorization of government authorities.

However, a non-negligent proportion of plasma samples from infected individuals, as well as S-specific monoclonal antibodies, were reported to be non-neutralizing despite efficient interaction with the S glycoprotein in different biochemical assays using soluble recombinant forms of S or when expressed at the cell surface. How neutralization relates to the binding of S glycoprotein in the context of viral particles remains to be established. Here, we developed a pseudovirus capture assay (VCA) to measure the capacity of plasma samples or antibodies immobilized on ELISA plates to bind to membrane-bound S glycoproteins from SARS-CoV-2 expressed at the surface of lentiviral particles. By performing VCA, ELISA, and neutralization assays, we observed a strong correlation between these parameters. However, while we found that plasma samples unable to capture viral particles did not neutralize, capture did not guarantee neutralization, indicating that the capacity of antibodies to bind to the S glycoprotein at the surface of pseudoviral particles is required but not sufficient to mediate neutralization. Altogether, our results highlight the importance of better understanding the inactivation of S by plasma and neutralizing antibodies.","Ding, Shilei; Laumaea, Annemarie; Benlarbi, Mehdi; Beaudoin-Bussières, Guillaume; Gasser, Romain; Medjahed, Halima; Pancera, Marie; Stamatatos, Leonidas; McGuire, Andrew T; Bazin, Renée; Finzi, Andrés",Viruses,,374

The most prominent pollutant concerning air quality index (AQI) was determined by Pearson's correlation analysis and unpaired Welch's two-sample t test was carried out to measure the statistically significant reduction in average AQI for all the four sites. AQI significantly plummeted by 44%, 59%, 59%, and 6% in ITO-Delhi, Worli-Mumbai, Jadavpur-Kolkata, and Manali Village-Chennai respectively. The findings conclude a significant improvement in air quality with respect to reduction of 49-73%, 17-63%, 30-74%, and 15-58% in the mean concentration of PM2.5, PM10, NH3, and SO2 respectively during the confinement for the studied locations. The p values for all of the four studied locations were found significantly less than the 5% level of significance for Welch's t test analysis. In addition, reduced AQI values were highly correlated with prominent pollutants (PM2.5 and PM10) during Pearson's correlation analysis. These positive results due to pandemic imprisonment might aid to alter the current policies and strategies of pollution control for a safe and sustainable environment.

We began by repurposing mTrigger® (mTrigger LLC, Newark, DE, USA), a cost-effective, portable EMG-BFB device, for gait application. This included developing features in the cellphone app such as step feedback, success rate, muscle activity calibration, and cloud integration. Next, we tested the validity and reliability of the mTrigger device in healthy adults by comparing it to a laboratory-grade EMG system. While wearing both devices, 32 adults walked overground and on a treadmill at four speeds (0.3, 0.6, 0.9, and 1.2 m/s). Statistical analysis revealed good to excellent test-retest reliability (r > 0.89) and good to excellent agreement in the detection of steps (ICC > 0.85) at all speeds between two systems for treadmill walking.

It contributes to organ development, such as sculpting neuron synapses, promoting tissue regeneration and repair, and rapidly engaging and synergizing with a number of processes, including hemostasis leading to thromboinflammation. Complement is a double-edged sword. Although it usually protects the host, it may cause tissue damage when dysregulated or overactivated, such as in the systemic inflammatory reaction seen in trauma and sepsis and severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Damage-associated molecular patterns generated during ischemia-reperfusion injuries (myocardial infarction, stroke, and transplant dysfunction) and in chronic neurologic and rheumatic disease activate complement, thereby increasing damaging inflammation. Despite the long list of diseases with potential for ameliorating complement modulation, only a few rare diseases are approved for clinical treatment targeting complement. Those currently being efficiently treated include paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, atypical hemolytic-uremic syndrome, myasthenia gravis, and neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders. Rare diseases, unfortunately, preclude robust clinical trials. The increasing evidence for complement as a pathogenetic driver in many more common diseases suggests an opportunity for future complement therapy, which, however, requires robust clinical trials; one ongoing example is COVID-19 disease. The current review aims to discuss complement in disease pathogenesis and discuss future pharmacological strategies to treat these diseases with complement-targeted therapies. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: The complement system is the host's defense friend by protecting it from invading pathogens, promoting tissue repair, and maintaining homeostasis. Complement is a double-edged sword, since when dysregulated or overactivated it becomes the host's enemy, leading to tissue damage, organ failure, and, in worst case, death. A number of acute and chronic diseases are candidates for pharmacological treatment to avoid complement-dependent damage, ranging from the well established treatment for rare diseases to possible future treatment of large patient groups like the pandemic coronavirus disease 2019.","Garred, Peter; Tenner, Andrea J; Mollnes, Tom E",Pharmacol Rev,,374

Understanding such complex text data is imperative, given that it is rich in information and can be used widely across various applications. In this survey, we explore different word representation models and its power of expression, from the classical to modern-day state-of-the-art word representation language models (LMS). We describe a variety of text representation methods, and model designs have blossomed in the context of NLP, including SOTA LMs. These models can transform large volumes of text into effective vector representations capturing the same semantic information. Further, such representations can be utilized by various machine learning (ML) algorithms for a variety of NLP related tasks. In the end, this survey briefly discusses the commonly used ML and DL based classifiers, evaluation metrics and the applications of these word embeddings in different NLP tasks.","Naseem, Usman; Razzak, Imran; Khan, Shah Khalid; Prasad, Mukesh",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.15036v1.pdf,374

DESIGN: Retrospective; observational study. SETTING: Istanbul Faculty of Medicine hospital, Turkey. PARTICIPANTS: 362 hospitalized patients with laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 from March 11 to May 11, 2020. MEASUREMENTS: The demographic information; associated comorbidities; presenting clinical, laboratory, radiological characteristics on admission and outcomes from the electronic medical records were analyzed comparatively between the younger (<65 years) and older (&#8805;65 years) adults. Factors associated with in-hospital mortality of the older adults were analyzed by multivariate regression analyses. RESULTS: The median age was 56 years (interquartile range [IQR], 46-67), and 224 (61.9%) were male. There were 104 (28.7%) patients &#8805;65 years of age. More than half of the patients (58%) had one or more chronic comorbidity. The three most common presenting symptoms in the older patients were fatigue/myalgia (89.4%), dry cough (72.1%), and fever (63.5%). Cough and fever were significantly less prevalent in older adults compared to younger patients (p=0.001 and 0.008, respectively). Clinically severe pneumonia was present in 31.5% of the study population being more common in older adults (49% vs. 24.4%) (p<0.001). The laboratory parameters that were significantly different between the older and younger adults were as follows: the older patients had significantly higher CRP, D-dimer, TnT, pro-BNP, procalcitonin levels, higher prevalence of lymphopenia, neutrophilia, increased creatinine, and lower hemoglobin, ALT, albumin level (p<0.05). In the radiological evaluation, more than half of the patients (54.6%) had moderate-severe pneumonia, which was more prevalent in older patients (66% vs. 50%) (p=0.006). The adverse outcomes were significantly more prevalent in older adults compared to the younger patients (ICU admission, 28.8% vs. 8.9%; mortality, 23.1% vs. 4.3%, p<0.001). Among the triage evaluation parameters, the only factor associated with higher mortality was the presence of clinically severe pneumonia on admission (Odds Ratio=12.3, 95% confidence interval=2.7-55.5, p=0.001). CONCLUSION: Older patients presented with more prevalent chronic comorbidities, less prevalent symptomatology but more severe respiratory signs and laboratory abnormalities than the younger patients. Among the triage assessment factors, the clinical evaluation of pulmonary involvement came in front to help clinicians to stratify the patients for mortality risk.","Medetalibeyoglu, A; Senkal, N; Kose, M; Catma, Y; Bilge Caparali, E; Erelel, M; Oral Oncul, M; Bahat, G; Tukek, T",J Nutr Health Aging,,374

The SARS-CoV-2 appears to have originated from bats but is now easily transmissible among humans, primarily through droplet or direct contact. Clinical features of COVID-19 include high fever, cough, and fatigue which may progress to ARDS. Respiratory failure can occur rapidly after this. The primary laboratory findings include lymphopenia and eosinopenia. Elevated D-dimer, procalcitonin, and CRP levels may correlate with disease severity. Imaging findings include ground-glass opacities and patchy consolidation on CT scan. Mortality is higher in patients with hypertension, cardiac disease, diabetes mellitus, cancer, and COPD. Elderly patients are more susceptible to severe disease and death, while children seem to have lower rates of infection and lower mortality. Diagnostic criteria and the identification of persons under investigation have evolved as more data has emerged. However, the approach to diagnosis is still very variable from region to region, country to country, and even among different hospitals in the same city. The importance of a clinical pathway to implement the most effective and relevant diagnostic strategy is of critical importance to establish the control of this virus that is responsible for more and more deaths each day.","Xu, Guogang; Yang, Yongshi; Du, Yingzhen; Peng, Fujun; Hu, Peng; Wang, Runsheng; Yin, Ming; Li, Tianzhi; Tu, Lei; Sun, Jinlyu; Jiang, Taijiao; Chang, Christopher",Clin Rev Allergy Immunol,,374

328164,Web-based Infant Food Introduction (WIFI): Feasibility and satisfaction of virtual allergist-supervised food introduction,2021,"Along with epidemiologic transitions of the global population, the burden of aortic stenosis (AS) is rapidly increasing and transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has quickly spread; indeed, it is nowadays also employed in treating patients with AS at intermediate operative risk. Nonetheless, the less invasive interventional strategy still carries relevant issues concerning post-procedural optimal antithrombotic strategy, given the current indications provided by guidelines are not completely supported by evidence-based data. Geriatric patients suffer from high bleeding and thromboembolic risks, whose balance is particularly subtle due to the presence of concomitant conditions, such as atrial fibrillation and chronic kidney disease, that make the post-TAVR antithrombotic management particularly insidious. This scenario is further complicated by the lack of specific evidence regarding the 'real-life' complex conditions typical of the geriatric syndromes, thus, the management of such a heterogeneous population, ranging from healthy ageing to frailty, is far from being defined. The aim of the present review is to summarize the critical points and the most updated evidence regarding the post-TAVR antithrombotic approach in the geriatric population, with a specific focus on the most frequent clinical settings.","Bencivenga, Leonardo; Sepe, Immacolata; Palaia, Maria Emiliana; Komici, Klara; Corbi, Graziamaria; Puzone, Brunella; Arcopinto, Michele; Cittadini, Antonio; Ferrara, Nicola; Femminella, Grazia Daniela; Rengo, Giuseppe",Eur J Prev Cardiol,,374
330668,Reply To Authors,2020,"The independent role of hypertension for COVID-19 outcomes in the population remains unclear. We aimed to estimate the independent effect of hypertension and hypertension-related conditions, i.e., cardiovascular, cerebrovascular and chronic kidney diseases, as potential risk factors for COVID-19 hospitalization and severe COVID-19 (i.e., intensive care unit admission or death) in the population. The risk for severe COVID-19 among hospitalized patients was also evaluated. A Spanish population-based cohort of people aged 25-79 years was prospectively followed from March to May 2020 to identify hospitalizations for laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. Poisson regression was used to estimate the adjusted relative risk (aRR) for COVID-19 hospitalization and severe COVID-19 among the whole cohort, and for severe COVID-19 among hospitalized patients. Of 424,784 people followed, 1106 were hospitalized by COVID-19 and 176 were severe cases. Hypertension was not independently associated with a higher risk of hospitalization (aRR 0.96, 95% CI 0.83-1.12) nor severe COVID-19 (aRR 1.12, 95% CI 0.80-1.56) in the population. Persons with cardiovascular, cerebrovascular and chronic kidney diseases were at higher risk for COVID-19 hospitalization (aRR 1.33, 95% CI 1.13-1.58; aRR 1.41, 95% CI 1.04-1.92; and aRR 1.52, 95% CI 1.21-1.91; respectively) and severe COVID-19 (aRR 1.61, 95% CI 1.13-2.30; aRR 1.91, 95% CI 1.13-3.25; and aRR 1.78, 95% CI 1.14-2.76; respectively). COVID-19 hospitalized patients with cerebrovascular diseases were at higher risk of mortality (aRR 1.80, 95% CI 1.00-3.23). The current study shows that, in the general population, persons with cardiovascular, cerebrovascular and chronic kidney diseases, but not those with hypertension only, should be considered as high-risk groups for COVID-19 hospitalization and severe COVID-19.","Fresán, Ujué; Guevara, Marcela; Trobajo-Sanmartín, Camino; Burgui, Cristina; Ezpeleta, Carmen; Castilla, Jesús",,,374

As a consequence, fake news has made its way into our daily life because of very limited capacity to verify news on the Internet by large companies as well as individuals. In this paper, we focus on solving two problems which are part of the fact-checking ecosystem that can help to automate fact-checking of claims in an ever increasing stream of content on social media. For the first problem, claim check-worthiness prediction, we explore the fusion of syntactic features and deep transformer Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) embeddings, to classify check-worthiness of a tweet, i.e. whether it includes a claim or not. We conduct a detailed feature analysis and present our best performing models for English and Arabic tweets. For the second problem, claim retrieval, we explore the pre-trained embeddings from a Siamese network transformer model (sentence-transformers) specifically trained for semantic textual similarity, and perform KD-search to retrieve verified claims with respect to a query tweet.","Cheema, Gullal S.; Hakimov, Sherzod; Ewerth, Ralph",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.10534v1.pdf,374
336389,Ethics check-up of public health immunization programs in Canada,2021,"Purpose: COVID-19 infection, its treatment, resultant immunosuppression, and pre-existing comorbidities have made patients vulnerable to secondary infections including mucormycosis. It is important to understand the presentation, temporal sequence, risk factors, and outcomes to undertake measures for prevention and treatment. Methods: We conducted a retrospective, interventional study on six consecutive patients with COVID-19 who developed rhino-orbital mucormycosis and were managed at two tertiary ophthalmic referral centers in India between August 1 and December 15, 2020. Diagnosis of mucormycosis was based on clinical features, culture, and histopathology from sinus biopsy. Patients were treated with intravenous liposomal amphotericin B with addition of posaconazole and surgical debridement of necrotic tissue. Results: All patients were male, mean age 60.5 ± 12 (46.2-73.9) years, type 2 diabetics with mean blood glucose level of 222.5 ± 144.4 (86-404) mg/dL. Except for one patient who was diagnosed with mucormycosis concurrently with COVID-19, all patients received systemic corticosteroids for the treatment of COVID-19. The mean duration between diagnosis of COVID-19 and development of symptoms of mucor was 15.6 ± 9.6 (3-42) days. All patients underwent endoscopic sinus debridement, whereas two patients required orbital exenteration. At the last follow-up, all six patients were alive, on antifungal therapy. Conclusion: Mucormycosis is a life-threatening, opportunistic infection, and patients with moderate to severe COVID-19 are more susceptible to it. Uncontrolled diabetes mellitus and use of corticosteroids increase the risk of invasive fungal infection with mucormycosis which can develop during the course of the illness or as a sequelae. High index of suspicion, early diagnosis, and appropriate management can improve survival.","Sen, Mrittika; Lahane, Sumeet; Lahane, Tatyarao P; Parekh, Ragini; Honavar, Santosh G",Indian J Ophthalmol,,374

An early recommendation to utilize general anesthesia and intubate all patients undergoing intervention to avoid an emergent aerosolizing procedure was found to have worse outcomes. The decline in new stroke and subarachnoid hemorrhage diagnoses may be related to patient and/or family fear of seeking acute medical care. A true shift in stroke epidemiology is also possible. As several vaccines become more readily available and the world rebounds from this pandemic, we hope to transform the neurointerventional experiences discussed in this paper into strategies that may improve care delivery of neurologically ill patients during a global crisis.","Rana, Ameena; Nguyen, Thanh N; Siegler, James E",Expert Rev Med Devices,,374

METHODS AND RESULTS: We retrospectively studied 16 patients with advanced HFrEF who developed COVID-19 between 1 March and 29 May 2020. Follow-up lasted until 30 September. Ten patients previously hospitalized with decompensated HFrEF were infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) during hospitalization. Six patients undergoing ambulatory care at initiation of COVID-19 symptoms were hospitalized because of advanced HFrEF. All patients who experienced worsening of HFrEF due to COVID-19 required higher doses or introduction of additional inotropic drugs or intra-aortic balloon pump in the intensive care unit. The mean intravenous dobutamine dose before SARS-CoV-2 infection in previously hospitalized patients (n = 10) and the median (inter-quartile range) peak intravenous dobutamine dose during SARS-CoV-2 infection in all patients (n = 16) were 2 (0-7) µg/kg/min and 20 (14-20) (P < 0.001), respectively. During follow-up, 56% underwent heart transplantation (n = 2) or died (n = 7). Four patients died during hospitalization from mixed shock consequent to severe acute respiratory syndrome with inflammatory storm syndrome associated with septic and cardiogenic shock during COVID-19. After COVID-19 recovery, two patients died from mixed septic and cardiogenic shock and one from sustained ventricular tachycardia and cardiogenic shock. Five patients were discharged from hospital to ambulatory care. Four were awaiting heart transplantation. CONCLUSION: Worsening of advanced HF by COVID-19 is associated with high mortality.

342471,Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2-related multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children mimicking Kawasaki disease,2021,"BACKGROUND: The pandemic of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 has become a serious concern in the medical community and has resulted in an unprecedented psychological impact on health care workers (HCWs), already working under high stress levels. The viral infection expanded internationally and World Health Organization announced a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to identify and measure the effects of this pandemic on anxiety levels and sleep disturbance and the availability of personal protective equipment (PPE) among the HCWs in India. METHODS: We conducted an online cross-sectional study using piloted structured questionnaires with self-reported responses from 368 volunteer males and females HCWs from India. Study participants were identified through social networking sites: Facebook and WhatsApp. The degree of symptoms of anxiety, sleep quality and the availability of PPE was assessed by the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) scale, Single Sleep Quality scale and questions on availability of PPE. RESULTS: Majority of the study subjects were in the age group 45-60 years and 52.2% were doctors. Severe anxiety scores (GAD>10) were observed in 7.3%; moderate, mild and minimal anxiety was observed in 12.5%, 29.3% and 50.8% HCWs respectively, and 31.5% had poor to fair sleep scores (<6). Univariate analysis showed female gender and inadequate availability of PPE significantly associated with higher anxiety levels (P= 0.01 and 0.01). Sleep disturbance was significantly associated with age<30 years (P=0.04) and inadequate PPE (P<0.001). Multivariable analysis showed that poorer quality of sleep was associated with higher anxiety levels (P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 pandemic has potentially caused a significant level of anxiety and sleep disturbance amongst HCWs, associated with female gender, younger age group, and availability of inadequate PPE, which puts HCWs at constant risk of contracting the infection themselves or transmitting it to their families.

344121,Lessons Learned From Conducting Internet-Based Randomized Clinical Trials During a Global Pandemic,2021,"Highly sensitive troponin (hs-TnI) levels are frequently elevated in COVID-19 patients and are associated with increased cardiovascular mortality during hospitalization. However, no data exists on cardiac involvement in patients recovered from COVID-19 infection. We aimed to evaluate by global longitudinal strain (LV-GLS) whether there is subclinical myocardial deformation after COVID-19 infection. Two-dimensional speckle tracking echocardiography (2D-STE) was performed within 29.5 ± 4.5 days after COVID-19 treatment. The standard GLS limit was identified at < -18%. The patients were divided into two groups according to their hs-TnI levels during hospitalization as with (> 11.6 ng/dl) and without (< 11.6 ng/dl) myocardial injury. Patients' (n = 74) mean age was 59.9 years, and women were in the majority (60.8%). Of the patients, 43.2% of them were hypertensive, and 10.9% were diabetic. Abnormal LV-GLS values (> -18) were measured in 28 patients (37.8%). While 16 (57.1%) of these patients were in the group with myocardial injury, 12 (26.1%) of them were in the group without myocardial injury (p = 0.014). D-dimer, C reactive protein, white blood cell levels were higher in the group with myocardial injury (All p values < 0.05). Electrocardiographically, 9 (12.2%) patients had T wave inversion, while two patients had a bundle branch block. Subclinical left ventricular dysfunction was observed in approximately one-third of the patients at the one-month follow-up after COVID-19 infection. This rate was higher in those who develop myocardial injury during hospitalization. This result suggests that patients recovered from COVID-19 infection should be evaluated and followed in terms of cardiac involvement.","Özer, Savas; Candan, Lütfullah; Özyildiz, Ali Gökhan; Turan, Oguzhan Ekrem",Int J Cardiovasc Imaging,,374
344413,The effect of feeding a Saccharomyces cerevisiae fermentation derived postbiotic as a pre-harvest food safety hurdle for reducing Salmonella Enteritidis in the ceca of layer pullets,2020,"Background: Since April 2020, there have been numerous reports of children presenting with systemic inflammation, often in critical condition, and with evidence of recent infection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). This condition, since defined as the multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C), is assumed to be a delayed immune response to COVID-19, and there are frequently cardiac manifestations of ventricular dysfunction and/or coronary artery dilation. Methods: We surveyed the inpatient MIS-C management approaches of the members of the International Kawasaki Disease Registry across 38 institutions and 11 countries. Results: Among the respondents, 56% reported using immunomodulatory treatment for all MIS-C patients, regardless of presentation. Every respondent reported use of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), including 53% administering IVIG in all patients. Steroids were most often used for patients with severe clinical presentation or lack of response to IVIG, and only a minority used steroids in all patients (14%). ASA was frequently used among respondents (91%), including anti-inflammatory and/or anti-platelet dosing. Respondents reported use of prophylactic anticoagulation, especially in patients at higher risk for venous thromboembolism, and therapeutic anticoagulation, particularly for patients with giant coronary artery aneurysms. Conclusions: There is variation in management of MIS-C patients with suboptimal evidence to assess superiority of the various treatments; evidence-based gaps in knowledge should be addressed through worldwide collaboration to optimize treatment strategies.","Elias, Matthew D; McCrindle, Brian W; Larios, Guillermo; Choueiter, Nadine F; Dahdah, Nagib; Harahsheh, Ashraf S; Jain, Supriya; Manlhiot, Cedric; Portman, Michael A; Raghuveer, Geetha; Giglia, Therese M; Dionne, Audrey",,,374

350642,Creative Approaches to Teaching French and Francophone Culture Remotely,2021,"Background: SARS-CoV-2 occurs in the majority of children as COVID-19, without symptoms or with a paucisymptomatic respiratory syndrome, but a small proportion of children develop the systemic Multi Inflammatory Syndrome (MIS-C), characterized by persistent fever and systemic hyperinflammation, with some clinical features resembling Kawasaki Disease (KD). Objective: With this study we aimed to shed new light on the pathogenesis of these two SARS-CoV-2-related clinical manifestations. Methods: We investigated lymphocyte and dendritic cells subsets, chemokine/cytokine profiles and evaluated the neutrophil activity mediators, myeloperoxidase (MPO), and reactive oxygen species (ROS), in 10 children with COVID-19 and 9 with MIS-C at the time of hospital admission. Results: Patients with MIS-C showed higher plasma levels of C reactive protein (CRP), MPO, IL-6, and of the pro-inflammatory chemokines CXCL8 and CCL2 than COVID-19 children. In addition, they displayed higher levels of the chemokines CXCL9 and CXCL10, mainly induced by IFN-Î³. By contrast, we detected IFN-&#945; in plasma of children with COVID-19, but not in patients with MIS-C. This observation was consistent with the increase of ISG15 and IFIT1 mRNAs in cells of COVID-19 patients, while ISG15 and IFIT1 mRNA were detected in MIS-C at levels comparable to healthy controls. Moreover, quantification of the number of plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs), which constitute the main source of IFN-&#945;, showed profound depletion of this subset in MIS-C, but not in COVID-19. Conclusions: Our results show a pattern of immune response which is suggestive of type I interferon activation in COVID-19 children, probably related to a recent interaction with the virus, while in MIS-C the immune response is characterized by elevation of the inflammatory cytokines/chemokines IL-6, CCL2, and CXCL8 and of the chemokines CXCL9 and CXL10, which are markers of an active Th1 type immune response. We believe that these immunological events, together with neutrophil activation, might be crucial in inducing the multisystem and cardiovascular damage observed in MIS-C.","Caldarale, Francesca; Giacomelli, Mauro; Garrafa, Emirena; Tamassia, Nicola; Morreale, Alessia; Poli, Piercarlo; Timpano, Silviana; Baresi, Giulia; Zunica, Fiammetta; Cattalini, Marco; Moratto, Daniele; Chiarini, Marco; Cannizzo, Elvira Stefania; Marchetti, Giulia; Cassatella, Marco Antonio; Taddio, Andrea; Tommasini, Alberto; Badolato, Raffaele",Front Immunol,,374

352581,History for some or lesson for all? A systematic review and meta-analysis on the immediate and long-term mental health impact of the 2002-2003 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak,2021,"The emergence of SARS-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has led to a global pandemic disease referred to as coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19). Hydroxychloroquine (CLQ-OH)/azithromycin (ATM) combination therapy is currently being tested for the treatment of COVID-19, with promising results. However, the molecular mechanism of action of this combination is not yet established. Using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, this study shows that the drugs act in synergy to prevent any close contact between the virus and the plasma membrane of host cells. Unexpected molecular similarity is shown between ATM and the sugar moiety of GM1, a lipid raft ganglioside acting as a host attachment cofactor for respiratory viruses. Due to this mimicry, ATM interacts with the ganglioside-binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. This binding site shared by ATM and GM1 displays a conserved amino acid triad Q-134/F-135/N-137 located at the tip of the spike protein. CLQ-OH molecules are shown to saturate virus attachment sites on gangliosides in the vicinity of the primary coronavirus receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2). Taken together, these data show that ATM is directed against the virus, whereas CLQ-OH is directed against cellular attachment cofactors. We conclude that both drugs act as competitive inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 attachment to the host-cell membrane. This is consistent with a synergistic antiviral mechanism at the plasma membrane level, where therapeutic intervention is likely to be most efficient. This molecular mechanism may explain the beneficial effects of CLQ-OH/ATM combination therapy in patients with COVID-19. Incidentally, the data also indicate that the conserved Q-134/F-135/N-137 triad could be considered as a target for vaccine strategies.","Fantini, Jacques; Chahinian, Henri; Yahi, Nouara",Int J Antimicrob Agents,,374

352666,A COVID-19 case in Libya acquired in Saudi Arabia,2020,"Background: Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is regarded as an urgent clinical entity, and identification of differentially expressed genes, lncRNAs, and altered pathways shall provide new insight into the molecular mechanisms behind AMI. Materials and Methods: Microarray data was collected to identify key genes and lncRNAs involved in AMI pathogenesis. The differential expression analysis and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) were employed to identify the upregulated and downregulated genes and pathways in AMI. The protein-protein interaction network and protein-RNA interaction analysis were utilized to reveal key long noncoding RNAs. Results: In the present study, we utilized gene expression profiles of circulating endothelial cells (CEC) from 49 patients of AMI and 50 controls and identified a total of 552 differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Based on these DEGs, we also observed that inflammatory response-related genes and pathways were highly upregulated in AMI. Mapping the DEGs to the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network and identifying the subnetworks, we found that OMD and WDFY3 were the hub nodes of two subnetworks with the highest connectivity, which were found to be involved in circadian rhythm and organ- or tissue-specific immune response. Furthermore, 23 lncRNAs were differentially expressed between AMI and control groups. Specifically, we identified some functional lncRNAs, including XIST and its antisense RNA, TSIX, and three lncRNAs (LINC00528, LINC00936, and LINC01001), which were predicted to be interacting with TLR2 and participate in Toll-like receptor signaling pathway. In addition, we also employed the MMPC algorithm to identify six gene signatures for AMI diagnosis. Particularly, the multivariable SVM model based on the six genes has achieved a satisfying performance (AUC = 0.97). Conclusion: In conclusion, we have identified key regulatory lncRNAs implicated in AMI, which not only deepens our understanding of the lncRNA-related molecular mechanism of AMI but also provides computationally predicted regulatory lncRNAs for AMI researchers.","Sheng, Xiaodong; Fan, Tao; Jin, Xiaoqi",Biomed Res Int,,374
353106,Original Article Highlights From This Issue,2021,"OBJECTIVES: The enforcement of complete lockdown with home confinement has been necessary to limit SARS-CoV-2 contagions in Italy, one the most affected countries worldwide. Simultaneously, in several Emergency Departments, a reduction in cardio- and cerebrovascular presentations was noticed. This study analyses the impact of Covid-19 pandemic and lockdown measures on the incidence of stroke, in Campania, the most densely-populated region in Italy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed data regarding acute stroke patients presenting at 5 Campania stroke hubs, before and after the issue of lockdown in Italy on March 9th, 2020. RESULTS: Compared to the pre-lockdown, we observed a significant reduction in the number of acute reperfusion treatments in stroke (P for interact 0.001); however the global number of patients presenting with acute stroke did not significantly differ. The time to reach medical attention was significantly longer in the lockdown phase (230 versus 154 min, P 0.016). For patients who underwent acute reperfusion treatment we also observed significantly longer time-to-imaging (30 versus 40 min, P 0.0005) and a trend to longer time-to-needle (75 versus 90 min P 0.23), but not time-to-groin. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed the reduction in acute reperfusion treatments for acute ischemic stroke and the slowdown of stroke pathways, during the lockdown phase of Covid-19 pandemic, in Campania, the third-most-populous and the most-densely populated Italian Region. In the next future, the risk for high-grade disability and death, due to delayed or even avoided hospital presentation due to fear of contagion, may be high.","Candelaresi, Paolo; Manzo, Valentino; Servillo, Giovanna; Muto, Mario; Barone, Paolo; Napoletano, Rosa; Saponiero, Renato; Andreone, Vincenzo; Palma, Vincenzo; Spitaleri, Daniele; D039,; Onofrio, Florindo; Maniscalco, Giorgia; Salvatore, Simona; Leone, Giuseppe; Capone, Elisa; Schettino, Carla; Romano, Daniele; Martusciello, Gioacchino; Miniello, Stefania; Mazzaferro, Maria Pia; Ascione, Salvatore",J Stroke Cerebrovasc Dis,,374

368868,"Relative Bradycardia in Patients with Mild-to-Moderate Coronavirus Disease, Japan",2020,"PURPOSE: There have been anecdotal reports of ocular manifestations in the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). As the pandemic is spreading and the whole picture is yet unknown, ophthalmologists should be aware of unusual ocular presentations of COVID-19 since they could precede the development of severe respiratory distress. METHODS: We report here the first case of a patient with bilateral unusual dot-blot retinal hemorrhages and retinal venous dilation who presented shortly thereafter a PCR-proven COVID-19. CASE REPORT: A 59-year-old woman presented with a 7 days history of blurred vision in both eyes. Fundus examination revealed bilateral venous stasis and dot and blot intra-retinal hemorrhages preceding the diagnosis of COVID-19 in a patient with mild respiratory symptoms that progressed within a few days to a severe respiratory distress. After 1 month of the COVID-19 treatment, fundus examination improved and fluorescein angiography demonstrated no diabetic retinopathy signs, no retinal vasculitis and no significant delay in arterial or venous filling. CONCLUSION: Intraretinal hemorrhages similar to those found in the retinopathy associated to blood dyscrasias could be an association with SARS-CoV-2 in the context of a coagulopathy induced by the infection.","Monferrer-Adsuara, Clara; Castro-Navarro, Verónica; González-Girón, Nuria; Remolí-Sargues, Lidia; Ortiz-Salvador, Miguel; Montero-Hernández, Javier; Cervera-Taulet, Enrique",Eur J Ophthalmol,,374
368869,"Relative Bradycardia in Patients with Mild-to-Moderate Coronavirus Disease, Japan",2020,"BACKGROUND: This study aimed to explore the impacts of COVID-19 outbreak on mental health status in general population in different affected areas in China. METHODS: This was a comparative study including two groups of participants: (1) general population in an online survey in Ya'an and Jingzhou cities during the COVID-19 outbreak from 10-20 February 2020; and (2) matching general population selected from the mental health survey in Ya'an in 2019 (from January to May 2019). General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12), Self-rating Anxiety Scale (SAS), and Self-rating Depression Scale (SDS) were used. RESULTS: There were 1775 participants (Ya'an in 2019 and 2020: 537 respectively; Jingzhou in 2020: 701). Participants in Ya'an had a significantly higher rate of general health problems (GHQ scores â©¾3) in 2020 (14.7%) than in 2019 (5.2%) (p < 0.001). Compared with Ya'an (8.0%), participants in Jingzhou in 2020 had a significantly higher rate of anxiety (SAS scores â©¾50, 24.1%) (p < 0.001). Participants in Ya'an in 2020 had a significantly higher rate of depression (SDS scores â©¾53, 55.3%) than in Jingzhou (16.3%) (p < 0.001). The risk factors of anxiety symptoms included female, number of family members (â©¾6 persons), and frequent outdoor activities. The risk factors of depression symptoms included participants in Ya'an and uptake self-protective measures. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of psychological symptoms has increased sharply in general population during the COVID-19 outbreak. People in COVID-19 severely affected areas may have higher scores of GHQ and anxiety symptoms. Culture-specific and individual-based psychosocial interventions should be developed for those in need during the COVID-19 outbreak.","Ran, Mao-Sheng; Gao, Ru; Lin, Jing-Xia; Zhang, Tian-Ming; Chan, Sherry Kit Wa; Deng, Xiao-Peng; Zhang, Bing-Zhi; Zhang, Xin-Feng; Huang, Guo-Ping; Pu, Dao-Shen; Bai, Jing-Zhen; Xu, Liu-Xiu; Liu, Bo",Psychol Med,,374

369803,Reply,2021,"The natural carotenoid lycopene (LYC) has strong antioxidant and neuroprotective capacities. This study investigated the effects and mechanisms of LYC on chronic stress-induced hippocampal lesions and learning and memory dysfunction. Rats were administered LYC and/or chronic restraint stress (CRS) for 21 days. Morris water maze results demonstrated that LYC prevented CRS-induced learning and memory dysfunction. Histopathological staining and transmission electron microscopy observation revealed that LYC ameliorated CRS-induced hippocampal microstructural and ultrastructural damage. Furthermore, LYC alleviated CRS-induced oxidative stress by reducing reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and enhancing antioxidant enzyme activities. LYC also improved CRS-induced hippocampal mitochondrial dysfunction by recovering mitochondrial membrane potential, and complex I (NADH dehydrogenase) and II (succinate dehydrogenase) activities. Moreover, LYC reduced CRS-induced apoptosis via the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway, and decreased the number of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick-end-labeled positive cells. Additionally, western blot analysis demonstrated that LYC inhibited CRS-induced activation of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling pathway. Correlation analysis indicated that ROS levels, JNK activation, and the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway were positively correlated. Further investigation of the underlying mechanisms revealed that the ROS scavenger N-acetyl-l-cysteine inhibited CRS-induced JNK activation. Furthermore, the JNK inhibitor SP600125 relieved CRS-induced hippocampal mitochondrial dysfunction, apoptosis via the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway, and learning and memory dysfunction. Together, these results suggest that LYC alleviates hippocampal oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and apoptosis by inhibiting the ROS/JNK signaling pathway, thereby improving CRS-induced hippocampal injury and learning and memory dysfunction. This study provides a theoretical basis and new therapeutic strategies for the application of LYC to relieve chronic stress encephalopathy.","Zhang, Haiyang; Wei, Mian; Sun, Qinghong; Yang, Tianyuan; Lu, Xiangyu; Feng, Xiujing; Song, Miao; Cui, Lin; Fan, Honggang",Food Chem Toxicol,,374

370886,Addressing decontaminated respirators: Some methods appear to damage mask integrity and protective function,2020,"The complex coacervation of proteins with other macromolecules has applications in protein encapsulation and delivery and for determining the function of cellular coacervates. Theoretical or empirical predictions for protein coacervates would enable the design of these coacervates with tunable and predictable structure-function relationships; unfortunately, no such theories exist. To help establish predictive models, the impact of protein-specific parameters on complex coacervation were probed in this study. The complex coacervation of sequence-specific, polypeptide-tagged, GFP variants and a strong synthetic polyelectrolyte was used to evaluate the effects of protein charge patterning on phase behavior. Phase portraits for the protein coacervates demonstrated that charge patterning dictates the protein's binodal phase boundary. Protein concentrations over 100 mg mL-1 were achieved in the coacervate phase, with concentrations dependent on the tag polypeptide sequence covalently attached to the globular protein domain. In addition to shifting the binodal phase boundary, polypeptide charge patterning provided entropic advantages over isotropically patterned proteins. Together, these results show that modest changes of only a few amino acids in the tag polypeptide sequence alter the coacervation thermodynamics and can be used to tune the phase behavior of polypeptides or proteins of interest.","Zervoudis, Nicholas A; Obermeyer, Allie C",Soft matter (Online),,374

Our simulation predicts the infection by COVID-19 in the UK would be out of control in 73 days without any interventions; at the same time, herd immunity acquisition will begin from the epicentre. After we introduced government interventions, a single intervention is effective in disease control but at huge expense, while combined interventions would be more efficient, among which, enhancing detection number is crucial in the control strategy for COVID-19. In addition, we calculated requirements for the most effective vaccination strategy based on infection numbers in a real situation. Our model was programmed with iterative algorithms, and visualized via cellular automata; it can be applied to similar epidemics in other regions if the basic parameters are inputted, and is able to synthetically mimic the effect of multiple factors in infectious disease control.","Zhang, Yuxuan; Gong, Chen; Li, Dawei; Wang, Zhi-Wei; Pu, Shengda D; Robertson, Alex W; Yu, Hong; Parrington, John",Sci Rep,,374

Since the start of the project in 2019, the COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted the global education process, that is, the range of training activities for school staff in an unprecedented manner. First the lockdown and then the hygienic measures impact the habits and certainties in schools on multiple levels, including artifacts (e.g., physical distancing measures and virtual platforms), processes (e.g., virtual learning and home-schooling), social structures (e.g., separation of a high-risk group), and values (e.g., difficulties in building relations and showing empathy due to physical distance). Leaders and staff are facing an uncertain situation, while their actions and decisions may—also unintentionally—shape the social reality that will be inhabited to a significant extent. In this context, a number of questions become salient. How does the disruption of the pandemic affect interpersonal relationships, interactions, and the social field—the sum of relationships within the system of a school—as a whole? And specifically, how do the actors reflect on changes in the social field, their relationships, and the schools’ and classrooms’ overall relationship quality due to the crisis? The assessment combines qualitative interviews with leaders and teachers (N = 10) along with a self-report survey (N = 80) addressing the effects of the pandemic on interpersonal aspects in schools. Surprisingly, a number of positive effects were mentioned regarding the learning environment in the smaller-sized classes, which were caused by hygienic measures, as well as increased cohesion among faculty. The potential influence of these effects by consciously shaping relationships and cultivating empathy is discussed in the article. © Copyright © 2021 Herrmann, Nielsen and Aguilar-Raab.","Herrmann, L.; Nielsen, B.

Here, we investigated whether persons vaccinated after a prior infection have better protection against future infection than those vaccinated without prior infection. Effect of prior infection was assessed in Qatars population, where the Alpha (B.1.1.7) and Beta (B.1.351) variants dominate incidence, using two national retrospective, matched-cohort studies, one for the BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) vaccine, and one for the mRNA-1273 (Moderna) vaccine. Incidence rates of infection among BNT162b2-vaccinated persons, with and without prior infection, were estimated, respectively, at 1.66 (95% CI: 1.26-2.18) and 11.02 (95% CI: 9.90-12.26) per 10,000 person-weeks. The incidence rate ratio was 0.15 (95% CI: 0.11-0.20). Analogous incidence rates among mRNA-1273-vaccinated persons were estimated at 1.55 (95% CI: 0.86-2.80) and 1.83 (95% CI: 1.07-3.16) per 10,000 person-weeks. The incidence rate ratio was 0.85 (95% CI: 0.34-2.05). Prior infection enhanced protection of those BNT162b2-vaccinated, but not those mRNA-1273-vaccinated. These findings may have implications for dosing, interval between doses, and potential need for booster vaccination.","Abu-Raddad, Laith J; Chemaitelly, Hiam; Ayoub, Houssein H.; YASSINE, HADI M.; Benslimane, Fatiha; Khatib, Hebah A.

397830,Reply to Nagappa and Marimuthu,2020,"BACKGROUND: In late 2019, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus emerged in China and quickly spread into a worldwide pandemic. Prior to the development of specific drug therapies or a vaccine, more immediately available treatments were sought including convalescent plasma. A potential improvement from convalescent plasma could be the preparation of anti-SARS-CoV-2 hyperimmune globulin (hIVIG). STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Convalescent plasma was collected from an existing network of plasma donation centers. A caprylate/chromatography purification process was used to manufacture hIVIG. Initial batches of hIVIG were manufactured in a versatile, small-scale facility designed and built to rapidly address emerging infectious diseases. RESULTS: Processing convalescent plasma into hIVIG resulted in a highly purified immunoglobulin G (IgG) product with more concentrated neutralizing antibody activity. hIVIG will allow for the administration of greater antibody activity per unit of volume with decreased potential for several adverse events associated with plasma administration. IgG concentration and IgG specific to SARS-CoV-2 were increased over 10-fold from convalescent plasma to the final product. Normalized enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay activity (per mg/ml IgG) was maintained throughout the process. Protein content in these final product batches was 100% IgG, consisting of 98% monomer and dimer forms. Potentially hazardous proteins (IgM, IgA, and anti-A, anti-B, and anti-D) were reduced to minimal levels. CONCLUSIONS: Multiple batches of anti-SARS-CoV-2 hIVIG that met regulatory requirements were manufactured from human convalescent plasma. The first clinical study in which the hIVIG will be evaluated will be Inpatient Treatment with Anti-Coronavirus Immunoglobulin (ITAC) [NCT04546581].","Vandeberg, Peter; Cruz, Maria; Diez, Jose Maria; Merritt, W Keither; Santos, Benjamin; Trukawinski, Susan; Wellhouse, Andrea; Jose, Marta; Willis, Todd",Transfusion,,374

China has imposed the strictest quarantine and closed management measures in history to control the spread of the disease. However, a high level of evidence to support the surgical management of potential trauma patients during the novel coronavirus outbreak is still lacking. To regulate the emergency treatment of trauma patients during the outbreak, we drafted this paper from a trauma surgeon perspective according to practical experience in Wuhan. MAIN BODY: The article illustrates the general principles for the triage and evaluation of trauma patients during the outbreak of COVID-19, indications for emergency surgery, and infection prevention and control for medical personnel, providing a practical algorithm for trauma care providers during the outbreak period. CONCLUSIONS: The measures of emergency trauma care that we have provided can protect the medical personnel involved in emergency care and ensure the timeliness of effective interventions during the outbreak of COVID-19.","Li, Yang; Zeng, Ling; Li, Zhanfei; Mao, Qingxiang; Liu, Ding; Zhang, Letian; Zhang, Huayu; Xie, Yu; Liu, Guo; Gan, Xiaoqin; Yang, Fan; Zhou, Siru; Ai, Shanmu; Tang, Hao; Zhong, Qiu; Lu, Hongxiang; Zhang, Huacai; Talmy, Tomer; Zhang, Weiguo; Chen, Liyong; Bai, Xiangjun; Jiang, Jianxin; Zhang, Lianyang",World J Emerg Surg,,374
407678,Longitudinal profiling of the vaccination coverage in Brazil reveals a recent change in the patterns hallmarked by differential reduction across regions,2020,"After the emergence of a novel coronavirus named SARS-CoV-2, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was initially characterized by fever, sore throat, cough, and dyspnea, mainly manifestations of respiratory system. However, other manifestations such as headache, abdominal pain, diarrhea, loss of taste and smell were added to the clinical spectrum, during the course of the COVID-19 pandemic. The reports on the neurological findings are increasing rapidly and headache seems to be the leader on the symptom list. Headache was reported in 11%-34% of the hospitalized COVID-19 patients, but clinical features of these headaches were totally missing in available publications. According to our initial experience, significant features of headache presentation in the symptomatic COVID-19 patients were new-onset, moderate-severe, bilateral headache with pulsating or pressing quality in the temporoparietal, forehead or periorbital region. The most striking features of the headache were sudden to gradual onset and poor response to common analgesics, or high relapse rate, that was limited to the active phase of the COVID-19. Symptomatic COVID-19 patients, around 6%-10%, also reported headache as a presenting symptom. The possible pathophysiological mechanisms of headache include activation of peripheral trigeminal nerve endings by the SARS-CoV-2 directly or through the vasculopathy and/or increased circulating pro-inflammatory cytokines and hypoxia. We concluded that as a common non-respiratory symptom of COVID-19, headache should not be overlooked, and its characteristics should be recorded with scrutiny.","Bolay, Hayrunnisa; Gül, Ahmet; Baykan, Betül",Headache,,374
411853,How the COVID-19 Pandemic has changed multiple sclerosis clinical practice: Results of a nationwide provider survey,2021,"The novel coronavirus disease, named COVID-19, emerged in China in December 2019, and has rapidly spread around the world. It is clearly urgent to fight COVID-19 at global scale. The development of methods for identifying drug uses based on phenotypic data can improve the efficiency of drug development. However, there are still many difficulties in identifying drug applications based on cell picture data. This work reported one state-of-the-art machine learning method to identify drug uses based on the cell image features of 1024 drugs generated in the LINCS program. Because the multi-dimensional features of the image are affected by non-experimental factors, the characteristics of similar drugs vary greatly, and the current sample number is not enough to use deep learning and other methods are used for learning optimization. As a consequence, this study is based on the supervised ITML algorithm to convert the characteristics of drugs. The results show that the characteristics of ITML conversion are more conducive to the recognition of drug functions. The analysis of feature conversion shows that different features play important roles in identifying different drug functions. For the current COVID-19, Chloroquine and Hydroxychloroquine achieve antiviral effects by inhibiting endocytosis, etc., and were classified to the same community.

There are attempts to reproduce with animal models the conditions under which this phenomenon is observed to provide a useful paradigm for studying contextual aversion learning and the brain structures involved. This manuscript assessed the hippocampus involvement in acquiring and maintaining long-term conditioned place avoidance (CPA) induced by a gastric malaise-inducing agent, LiCl. Our results demonstrate that a reliable induction of CPA is possible after one acquisition trial. However, CPA establishment requires a 20-min confinement in the compartment associated with LiCl administration. Interestingly, both hippocampal regions seem to be necessary for CPA establishment; nonetheless, inactivation of the ventral hippocampus results in a reversion of avoidance and turns it into preference. Moreover, we demonstrate that activation of dorsal/ventral hippocampal NMDA receptors after CS-US association is required for long-term CPA memory maintenance.","Hernández-Matias, Arturo; Bermúdez-Rattoni, Federico; Osorio-Gómez, Daniel",Learn Mem,,374

418191,Reply,2020,"The COVID-19 crisis presents a unique opportunity to study how public opinion towards the redistributive role of the state reacts to a major economic shock. The pandemic and the measures taken to stop it exposed citizens to both increased fiscal constraint and heightened redistributive capacity: historical drops in GDP (and fiscal revenue) coincided with unprecedented increases in public spending on healthcare provisions and social policy, as well as staggering amounts of financial liquidity provided to hard-hit economic sectors. How did this affect citizens' attitudes towards redistribution and their assessments of the capacity of the state to intervene? To tackle these questions, we rely on a two-wave panel survey fielded in Germany, Sweden and Spain in late 2018 and June 2020. While preferred levels of redistribution have remained largely stable, our results indicate major shifts and growing ideological polarization around perceptions of welfare state efficiency and capacity, fiscal constraint and political trust. Hence, the COVID-crisis has so far neither led to a left- nor a right-wing shift in citizens' desired level of state intervention, but to an increasingly polarized context of (re)distributive politics, which is likely to imply heightened conflict over economic and social policy in the future.

Most protein quantitation strategies assume that multiple peptides derived from a protein will behave quantitatively similar across treatment groups, but this assumption may be false due to (1) heterogeneous proteoforms and (2) technical artifacts. Here we describe a strategy called peptide correlation analysis (PeCorA) that detects quantitative disagreements between peptides mapped to the same protein. PeCorA fits linear models to assess whether a peptide's change across treatment groups differs from all other peptides assigned to the same protein. PeCorA revealed that â¼15% of proteins in a mouse microglia stress data set contain at least one discordant peptide. Inspection of the discordant peptides shows the utility of PeCorA for the direct and indirect detection of regulated post-translational modifications (PTMs) and also for the discovery of poorly quantified peptides. The exclusion of poorly quantified peptides before protein quantity summarization decreased false-positives in a benchmark data set. Finally, PeCorA suggests that the inactive isoform of prothrombin, a coagulation cascade protease, is more abundant in plasma from COVID-19 patients relative to non-COVID-19 controls. PeCorA is freely available as an R package that works with arbitrary tables of quantified peptides.","Dermit, Maria; Peters-Clarke, Trenton M; Shishkova, Evgenia; Meyer, Jesse G",J. proteome res,,374

449099,"Clostridioides difficile in COVID-19 Patients, Detroit, Michigan, USA, March-April 2020",2020,"The novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, has infected more than 10 million people and caused more than 502,539 deaths worldwide as of June 2020. The explosive spread of the virus and the rapid increase in the number of cases require the immediate development of effective therapies and vaccines as well as accurate diagnosis tools. The pathogenesis of the disease is triggered by the entry of SARS-CoV-2 via its spike protein into ACE2-bearing host cells, particularly pneumocytes, resulting in overactivation of the immune system, which attacks the infected cells and damages the lung tissue. The interaction of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD) with host cells is primarily mediated by the N-terminal helix of ACE2; thus, inhibition of the spike-ACE2 interaction may be a promising therapeutic strategy for blocking the virus entry into host cells. In this paper, we used an in-silico approach to explore small-molecule &#945;-helix mimetics as inhibitors that may disrupt the attachment of SARS-CoV-2 to ACE2. First, the RBD-ACE2 interface in the 6M0J structure was studied by the MM-GBSA decomposition module of the HawkDock server, which led to the identification of two critical target regions in the RBD. Next, two virtual screening experiments of 7236 &#945;-helix mimetics from ASINEX were conducted on the above regions using the iDock tool, which resulted in 10 candidates with favorable binding affinities.

This study evaluated COVID-19 transmission risks in people in group living environments. A total of 4550 individuals with a history of recent contact with patients at different places (dormitory/home/outside the residences) and levels (close/lower-risk) were tested for SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA using a nasopharyngeal swab test between July 2020 and May 2021. The test-positive rate was highest in individuals who had contact in dormitories (27.5%), but the rates were largely different between dormitories with different infrastructural or lifestyle features and infection control measures among residents. With appropriate infection control measures, the secondary transmission risk in dormitories was adequately suppressed. The household transmission rate (12.6%) was as high as that of close contact outside the residences (11.3%) and accounted for > 60% of the current rate of COVID-19 transmission among non-adults. Household transmission rates synchronized to local epidemics with changed local capacity of quarantining infectious patients. In conclusion, a group living environment is a significant risk factor of secondary transmission. Appropriate infection control measures and quarantine of infectious residents will decrease the risk of secondary transmission in group living environments.","Akaishi, Tetsuya; Kushimoto, Shigeki; Katori, Yukio; Kure, Shigeo; Igarashi, Kaoru; Takayama, Shin; Abe, Michiaki; Tanaka, Junichi; Kikuchi, Akiko; Onodera, Ko; Ishii, Tadashi",Sci Rep,,374

We do not have any drug or vaccine available for the inhibition of this deadly virus. The expedition for searching a potential drug or vaccine against COVID-19 will be of massive potential and favor. This study is focused on finding an effective natural origin compound which can put a check on the activity of this virus. We chose important proteins from the SARS-CoV-2 genome such as NSP4, NSP15 and RdRp along-with the human ACE2 receptor which is the first point of contact with the virus. Virtual screening and followed up molecular docking resulted in Baicalin and Limonin as the final lead molecules. 200 ns of MD simulation for each protein-ligand complex provides the insights that Baicalin has a potential to target NSP4, NSP15 and RdRp proteins. Limonin which is largely used in traditional Indian medicine system is found to inhibit the human ACE2 receptor (making it inefficient in binding to the receptor binding domain of SARS-CoV-2).

In fact, in some people the immune system goes into overdrive and launches a large-scale assault on the tissue known as cytokine storm. This excessive inflammatory/immune reaction can damage tissue and eventually kill people. Evidence shows that blocking such cytokine storms can be effective and trials are under way to test drugs that act by reducing cytokine response, such as tocilizumab and sarilumab which bind interleukin 6 (IL-6), or anakinra which is the interleukin 1 receptor antagonist (IL-1). However, other drugs that block the cytokine cascade can also be considered. In this article we describe the scientific and molecular motivation for the use of drugs that act by modulating the hyperactive inflammatory system in severe patients suffering from SARS-CoV-2, considering in particular an old drug that has been in use for many years for other therapeutic indications such as colchicine, and that could be favorable to its use, with low cost and good tolerability.","Vitiello, Antonio; Ferrara, Francesco; Pelliccia, Chiara; Granata, Giovanni; la Porta, Raffaele",Ital.

The accepted rule is that mismatches are detrimental as they reduce the hybridization temperatures, yet a more quantitative assessment is rarely performed. METHODS: We calculate the hybridization temperatures of primer/probe sets after aligning to SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-1 and non-SARS genomes, considering all possible combinations of single, double and triple consecutive mismatches. We consider the mismatched hybridization temperature within a range of 5 &#8728;C to the fully matched reference temperature. RESULTS: We obtained the alignments of 19 PCR primers sets that were recently reported for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 and to 21665 SARS-CoV-2 genomes as well as 323 genomes of other viruses of the coronavirus family of which 10 are SARS-CoV-1. We find that many incompletely aligned primers become fully aligned to most of the SARS-CoV-2 when mismatches are considered. However, we also found that many cross-align to SARS-CoV-1 and non-SARS genomes. CONCLUSIONS: Some primer/probe sets only align substantially to most SARS-CoV-2 genomes if mismatches are taken into account. Unfortunately, by the same mechanism, almost 75% of these sets also align to some SARS-CoV-1 and non-SARS viruses. It is therefore recommended to consider mismatch hybridization for the design of primers whenever possible, especially to avoid undesired cross-reactivity.","Miranda, Pâmella; Weber, Gerald",Mol Cell Probes,,374
461959,Reply,2020,"Motivational digital systems offer capabilities to engage and motivate end-users to foster behavioral changes towards a common goal. In general these systems use gamification principles in non-games contexts. Over the years, gamification has gained consensus among researchers and practitioners as a tool to motivate people to perform activities with the ultimate goal of promoting behavioural change, or engaging the users to perform activities that can offer relevant benefits but which can be seen as unrewarding and even tedious. There exists a plethora of heterogeneous application scenarios towards reaching the common good that can benefit from gamification. However, an open problem is how to effectively combine multiple motivational campaigns to maximise the degree of participation without exposing the system to counterproductive behaviours. We conceive motivational digital systems as multi-agent systems: self-adaptation is a feature of the overall system, while individual agents may self-adapt in order to leverage other agents' resources, functionalities and capabilities to perform tasks more efficiently and effectively. Consequently, multiple campaigns can be run and adapted to reach common good. At the same time, agents are grouped into micro-communities in which agents contribute with their own social capital and leverage others' capabilities to balance their weaknesses. In this paper we propose our vision on how the principles at the base of the autonomous and multi-agent systems can be exploited to design multi-challenge motivational systems to engage smart communities towards common goals. We present an initial version of a general framework based on the MAPE-K loop and a set of research challenges that characterise our research roadmap for the implementation of our vision.","Bucchiarone, Antonio; Cicchetti, Antonio; Bencomo, Nelly; Loria, Enrica; Marconi, Annapaola",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.15559v1.pdf,374

The limited exchange of information outside of the quarterly clinic visits impedes optimal disease self-management, patient engagement, and shared decision making. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to adapt a mobile health (mHealth) app originally developed in Sweden to the needs of patients, families, and health care providers in a CF center in the United States and to test it as a platform for sharing patient-generated health data with the CF health care team. METHODS: Focus groups with health care providers of patients with CF, adolescents with CF, and caregivers of children with CF were conducted to determine what modifications were necessary. Focus group data were analyzed using a thematic analysis, and emergent themes were ranked according to desirability and technical feasibility. The mHealth platform was then modified to meet the identified needs and preferences, and the flow of patient-generated health data to a secure Research Electronic Data Capture database was tested. Protocols for data management and clinical follow-up were also developed. RESULTS: A total of 5 focus groups with 21 participants were conducted. Recommended modifications pertained to all functionalities of the mHealth platform, including tracking of symptoms, treatments, and activities of daily care; creating and organizing medication lists and setting up reminders; generating reports for the health care team; language and presentation; sharing and privacy; and settings and accounts. Overall, health care providers recommended changes to align the mHealth platform with US standards of care, people with CF and their caregivers requested more tracking functionalities, and both groups suggested the inclusion of a mental health tracker as well as more detailed response options and precise language. Beta testers of the modified platform reported issues related to translatability to US environment and various bugs. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated the importance of identifying the needs and preferences of target users and stakeholders before adopting existing mHealth solutions. All relevant perspectives, including those of clinicians, patients, and caregivers, should be thoroughly considered to meet both end users' needs and evidence-based practice recommendations.","Rutland, Sarah B; Bergquist, Rikard Palmer; Hager, Andreas; Geurs, Robin; Mims, Cathy; Gutierrez, Hector H; Oates, Gabriela R",JMIR Form Res,,374

Researchers from a variety of disciplines jumped at the opportunity to compare the rescheduled games, played in front of empty stadia, to previous games, played in front of fans. To date, most of this post-Covid soccer research has used linear regression models, or versions thereof, to estimate potential changes to the home advantage. But because soccer outcomes are non-linear, we argue that leveraging the Poisson distribution would be more appropriate. We begin by using simulations to show that bivariate Poisson regression reduces absolute bias when estimating the home advantage benefit in a single season of soccer games, relative to linear regression, by almost 85 percent. Next, with data from 17 professional soccer leagues, we extend bivariate Poisson models estimate the change in home advantage due to games being played without fans. In contrast to current research that overwhelmingly suggests a drop in the home advantage, our findings are mixed; in some leagues, evidence points to a decrease, while in others, the home advantage may have risen.

Therefore, we explored real-world effectiveness of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccination on subsequent infection in patients with IBD with diverse exposure to immunosuppressive medications. METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study of patients in the Veterans Health Administration with IBD diagnosed before December 18, 2020, the start date of the Veterans Health Administration patient vaccination program. IBD medication exposures included mesalamine, thiopurines, anti-tumor necrosis factor biologic agents, vedolizumab, ustekinumab, tofacitinib, methotrexate, and corticosteroid use. We used inverse probability weighting and Cox's regression with vaccination status as a time-updating exposure and computed vaccine effectiveness from incidence rates. RESULTS: The cohort comprised 14,697 patients, 7321 of whom received at least 1 vaccine dose (45.2% Pfizer, 54.8% Moderna). The cohort had median age 68 years, 92.2% were men, 80.4% were White, and 61.8% had ulcerative colitis. In follow-up data through April 20, 2021, unvaccinated individuals had the highest raw proportion of SARS-CoV-2 infection (197 [1.34%] vs 7 [0.11%] fully vaccinated). Full vaccination status, but not partial vaccination status, was associated with a 69% reduced hazard of infection relative to an unvaccinated status (hazard ratio, 0.31, 95% confidence interval, 0.17-0.56; P < .001), corresponding to an 80.4% effectiveness. CONCLUSIONS: Full vaccination (> 7 days after the second dose) against SARS-CoV-2 infection has an â¼80.4% effectiveness in a broad IBD cohort with diverse exposure to immunosuppressive medications.

METHODS: All relevant studies had been collected from PubMed, Scopus, Embase, and Web of Science databases. All extracted data were analyzed using Stata version 11.2. The I2 index was applied, and a random-effects model or a fixed-effects model was used for pooled estimation to assess the heterogeneity of studies. Furthermore, Egger and Beeg's tests were used to evaluate the publication bias. RESULTS: Fifty-seven studies (26 observational and 31 case reports) were included (including 6,597 COVID-19 patients). The most prevalent general symptoms were fever, cough, and dyspnea with 84.6% (95% CI: 75.3-92.1; I2 = 98.7%), 61.3% (95% CI: 55.3-67.0; I2 = 94.6%), and 34.2% (95% CI: 25.6-43.4; I2 = 97.7%), respectively. Neurological symptoms observed among COVID-19 patients were fatigue, gustatory dysfunction, anorexia, olfactory dysfunction, headache, dizziness, and nausea with 42.9% (95% CI: 36.7-49.3; I2 = 92.8%), 35.4% (95% CI: 11.2-64.4; I2 = 99.2%), 28.9% (95% CI: 19.9-38.8; I2 = 96.3%), 25.3% (95% CI: 1.6-63.4; I2 = 99.6%), 10.1% (95% CI: 2.7-21.0; I2 = 99.1%), 6.7% (95% CI: 3.7-10.5; I2 = 87.5%), and 5.9% (95% CI: 3.1-9.5; I2 = 94.5%).

495073,"Symptom Diary-Based Analysis of Disease Course among Patients with Mild Coronavirus Disease, Germany, 2020",2021,"Infectious Bronchitis (IB) caused by Infectious Bronchitis Virus (IBV) is currently a major threat to chicken health with multiple outbreaks being reported in the US over the past decade. Modified live virus (MLV) vaccines used in the field can persist and provide the genetic material needed for recombination and emergence of novel IBV serotypes. Inactivated and subunit vaccines overcome some of the limitations of MLV with no risk of virulence reversion and emergence of new virulent serotypes. However, these vaccines are weakly immunogenic and poorly protective. There is an urgent need to develop more effective vaccines that can elicit a robust, long-lasting immune response. In this study, we evaluate a novel adjuvant system developed from Quil-A and chitosan (QAC) for the intranasal delivery of nucleic acid immunogens to improve protective efficacy. The QAC adjuvant system forms nanocarriers (<100 nm) that efficiently encapsulate nucleic acid cargo, exhibit sustained release of payload and can stably transfect cells. Encapsulation of plasmid DNA vaccine expressing IBV nucleocapsid (N) protein by the QAC adjuvant system (pQAC-N) enhanced immunogenicity as evidenced by robust induction of adaptive humoral and cellular immune responses post vaccination and challenge. Birds immunized with pQAC-N showed reduced clinical severity and viral shedding post challenge on par with protection observed with current commercial vaccines without the associated safety concerns. Presented results indicate that the QAC adjuvant system can offer a safer alternative to the use of live vaccines against avian and other emerging coronaviruses.Importance According to the 2017 US agriculture statistics, the combined value of production and sales from broilers, eggs, turkeys, and chicks was $42.8 billion. Of this number, broiler sales comprised 67 percent of the industry value with the production of > 50 billion pounds of chicken meats. The economic success of the poultry industry in the USA hinges on the extensive use of vaccines to control Infectious Bronchitis Virus (IBV) and other poultry pathogens. Majority of vaccines currently licensed for poultry health include both modified live vaccine and inactivated pathogens. Despite their proven efficacy, modified live vaccine constructs take time to produce and could potentially revert to virulence, which limits their safety. The significance of our research stems from the development of a safer and potent alternative mucosal vaccine to replace live vaccines against IBV and other emerging coronaviruses.","Chandrasekar, Shaswath S; Kingstad-Bakke, Brock A; Wu, Chia-Wei; Suresh, M; Talaat, Adel M",J. virol,,374

EGCG and theaflavin showed inhibitory activity against the SARS-CoV-2 3CL-protease in a dose-dependent manner, and the half inhibitory concentration (IC50) was 7.58 µg/ml for EGCG and 8.44 µg/ml for theaflavin. In addition, we did not observe any cytotoxicity for either EGCG or theaflavin at the concentrations tested up to 40 µg/ml in HEK293T cells. These results suggest that upon further study, EGCG and theaflavin can be potentially useful to treat COVID-19.","Jang, Minsu; Park, Yea-In; Cha, Yeo-Eun; Park, Rackhyun; Namkoong, Sim; Lee, Jin I; Park, Junsoo",Evid Based Complement Alternat Med,,374

Care has been transformed by the crisis, but enduring lessons have been learned. In this article, we review how COVID-19 will impact cirrhosis care. We describe how this impact unfolds over 3 waves; i) an intense period with prioritized high-acuity care with delayed elective procedures and routine care during physical distancing, ii) a challenging 'return to normal' following the end of physical distancing, with increased emergent decompensations, morbidity, and systems of care overwhelmed by the backlog of deferred care, and iii) a protracted period of suboptimal outcomes characterized by missed diagnoses, progressive disease and loss to follow-up. We outline the concrete steps required to preserve the quality of care provided to patients with cirrhosis. This includes an intensification of the preventative care provided to patients with compensated cirrhosis, proactive chronic disease management, robust telehealth programs, and a reorganization of care delivery to provide a full service of care with flexible clinical staffing. Managing the pandemic of a serious chronic disease in the midst of a global infectious pandemic is challenging. It is incumbent upon the entire healthcare establishment to be strong enough to weather the storm. Change is needed.","Tapper, Elliot B; Asrani, Sumeet K",J Hepatol,,374
497959,SARS CoV-2-associated multisystem inflammatory syndrome of children (MIS-C) in the Washington DC metropolitan region,2020,"The recent 'outburst' of COVID-19 spurred efforts to model and forecast its diffusion patterns, either in terms of infections, people in need of medical assistance (ICU occupation) or casualties. Forecasting patterns and their implied end states remains cumbersome when few (stochastic) data points are available during the early stage of diffusion processes. Extrapolations based on compounded growth rates do not account for inflection points nor end-states. In order to remedy this situation, we advance a set of heuristics which combine forecasting and scenario thinking. Inspired by scenario thinking we allow for a broad range of end states (and their implied growth dynamics, parameters) which are consecutively being assessed in terms of how well they coincide with actual observations. When applying this approach to the diffusion of COVID-19, it becomes clear that combining potential end states with unfolding trajectories provides a better-informed decision space as short term predictions are accurate, while a portfolio of different end states informs the long view. The creation of such a decision space requires temporal distance. Only to the extent that one refrains from incorporating more recent data, more plausible end states become visible. Such dynamic approach also allows one to assess the potential effects of mitigating measures. As such, our contribution implies a plea for dynamically blending forecasting algorithms and scenario-oriented thinking, rather than conceiving them as substitutes or complements.","Decock, Kristof; Debackere, Koenraad; Vandamme, Anne-Mieke; Van Looy, Bart",Scientometrics,,374

The article assesses the closeness of the relationship between the respondents ' belonging to a particular socio-demographic group and their social well-being during the period of self-isolation, quarantine or other restrictions imposed during the coronavirus pandemic in 2020. To solve this problem, the demographic and socio-economic characteristics of respondents are presented, the distribution of responses according to the survey results is estimated and the most significant factor characteristics are selected. The distributions of respondents ' responses are presented for the selected questions. To determine the closeness of the relationship between the respondents ' answers to the question and their gender or age distribution, the coefficients of mutual conjugacy and rank correlation coefficients were calculated and analyzed.

The first related death occurred on March 17, 2020. Preparedness for the pandemic has been ongoing before the first case was detected. The National Pandemic Plan was published in 2006. The Pandemic Influenza National Preparedness Plan was available after being updated in light of experiences gained during the 2009 Influenza A pandemic. Accordingly, Pandemic Coordination Boards and Operation Centers have been established on the national and provincial levels. This was an adaptable plan to the Novel Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19). We formed teams to work on a 24/7 basis and established a Scientific Committee at the Public Health Emergency Operation Center within the General Directorate of Public Health. ""COVID-19 Risk Assessment"", ""COVID-19 Guideline"" and ""Case Report Form"", regulations of personal protective equipment along with need-based guidelines, treatment algorithms, brochures and related documents have been released. For the case-based follow-up, Public Health Management System (HSYS) is being used. PCR and rapid diagnostic kits are being used to analyze the samples at the central Microbiology Reference Laboratory and the authorized laboratories in several provinces. Various preventive measures were implemented including flight restrictions to certain countries, gradually expanded to suspending all flights and prohibiting the entry of foreign nationals, 14-day isolation and symptom monitoring for those that came from countries under risk. Persons with chronic diseases have been granted an administrative leave, on campus education at schools and activities of public rest and entertainment areas were temporarily suspended. The measures have been implemented for penitentiary institutions, dormitories, nursing homes, public transport and intercity buses, and also weekend curfews are implemented. In accordance with the pandemic plan, actions have been carried out with a multi-sectoral approach, and preventive measures have been implemented to cover the society as a whole.","Demirbilek, Yasemin; Pehlivantürk, Gülen; Özgüler, Zeynep Özge; Alp Mese, Emine",Turk J Med Sci,,374

METHODS: The Vascular Surgery Group of Regione Lombardia Register, a real-word, multicenter, retrospective register was interrogated. All patients admitted with vascular disease were included. Patients' data on demographics, COVID-19 positivity, comorbidities and outcomes were extrapolated. Two cohorts were obtained: patients admitted to HH or SH. Primary endpoint was 30- day mortality rate. Secondary outcomes were 30-day complications and amputation (in case of peripheral artery disease [PAD]) rates. Univariate and multivariate analysis were used to compare HH and SH groups and predictors of poor outcomes. RESULTS: During the study period, 659 vascular patients in 4 HH and 27 SH were analyzed. Among these, 321 (48.7%) were admitted to a HH. No difference in COVID-19 positive patients was described (21.7% in HH vs 15.9% in SH; p=.058). After 30 days from intervention, HH and SH experienced similar mortality and no-intervention-related complication rate (12.1% vs 10.0%; p=.427 and 10.3% vs 8.3%; p=.377, respectively). Conversely, in HH postoperative complications were higher (23.4% vs 16.9%, p=.038) and amputations in patients treated for PAD were lower (10.8% vs 26.8%; p<.001) than in SH. Multivariate analysis demonstrated in both cohorts COVID-19-related pneumonia as independent predictor of death and postoperative complications, while age for death.

Research involving the patients’ perspectives may help to improve healthcare professionals' understanding of ways to support patients. AIMS: To gain in‐depth understanding of the meaning of a COVID‐19 illness trajectory from the patients’ perspective. METHODS: Fifteen participants who had undergone an illness trajectory due to confirmed COVID‐19 infection participated in individual qualitative interviews. Data collection, analysis and interpretation were inspired by Ricoeur’s philosophy and Merleau‐Ponty’s phenomenology of perception and embodiment has been applied as a theoretical frame. FINDINGS: Being infected with coronavirus is expressed as an experience in which the participants oscillate between relief, security, imprisonment and raw fear. A predominant focus on the physical dimensions of the diseased body was found in the encounters between patient and healthcare system, and distance may furthermore be a consequence of use of protective equipment. Stigma and fear of infection were also expressed. After COVID‐19, an overwhelming feeling of a door opening to freedom is perceived. However, the body is marked, and bears witness to decay from this insidious and frightening virus. The responsibility for assessing their bodily symptoms is placed with the individual patients themselves, who feel lonely and fearful and this keeps them indoors. CONCLUSIONS: During a COVID‐19 illness, trajectory concerns about the unknown course of this disease are highlighted. Isolation is confrontational; however, a companionship between patients might emerge. The study shed light on an unavoidable gap between the patients and healthcare professionals due to the use protective equipment. After COVID‐19, the body is labelled as something others fear and become a symbol of awe and alienation for others.","Missel, Malene; Bernild, Camilla; Westh Christensen, Signe; Dagyaran, Ilkay; Kikkenborg Berg, Selina",Scand J Caring Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33734468/; https://doi.org/10.1111/scs.12975,374

Little is known about whether social distancing and other societal changes has provoked an increase in gambling, whether decreased betting opportunities due to paused sports events spurred gamblers to transition to online casino gambling, or whether any of these factors have had an impact on problem gambling. Methods: Data on lookup queries against the Swedish Gambling Paus registry, logging all initiated gambling sessions by all licensed gambling providers, from 2019-01-01 (start of registry) to 2020-04-08 (well into the first phase of the outbreak) were analyzed using TBATS time series forecasting to estimate trends after the first domestic COVID-19 death. Obfuscated data on daily total wagered and deposited amounts, split by modality (casino or betting, and low and high intensity, respectively) for the equivalent period were supplied by a licensed online gambling provider. Results: Total gambling activity decreased by 13.29% during the first phase of the outbreak compared to forecast. Analyses of online gambling data revealed that although betting decreased substantially in synchrony with a slight increase in online casino gambling, there was no increase in likely problematic, high-intensity gambling and neither did total online gambling increase. Conclusions: This first, preliminary study revealed no increase in Swedish gambling activity, total or specifically online, in the first phase of the COVID-19 outbreak. Future research should examine whether pandemic-induced transitioning between gambling modalities and/or increased participation in gambling, leads to long-term effects on prevalence of problem gambling.","Lindner, Philip; Forsström, David; Jonsson, Jakob; Berman, Anne H.; Carlbring, Per",Front Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2020.554542; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33117770/,374

PURPOSE: To determine the incidence, clinical characteristics, and outcomes of critically ill patients with COVID-19 infection who developed pneumothorax. In addition, we compared the clinical characteristics and outcomes of mechanically ventilated patients who developed a pneumothorax with those who did not develop a pneumothorax. METHODS: This study was a multicenter retrospective analysis of all adult critically ill patients with COVID-19 infection who were admitted to intensive care units in 4 tertiary care centers in the United States. RESULTS: A total of 842 critically ill patients with COVID-19 infection were analyzed, out of which 594 (71%) were mechanically ventilated. The overall incidence of pneumothorax was 83/842 (10%), and 80/594 (13%) in those who were mechanically ventilated.

Willingness to be vaccinated differed by age (p < 0.001), by race and ethnicity (p < 0.001) and by level of education (p < 0.001). Willingness generally increased with age and education. Asians were most willing to be vaccinated, followed by non-Hispanic Whites, Hispanics, and non-Hispanic Blacks (p < 0.001). Occupational groups differed in willingness (p < 0.001). Retired and students were more willing than all others (p < 0.001) followed by disabled or unemployed, healthcare workers, and educators. First Responders were least willing to be vaccinated (p < 0.001) followed by construction, maintenance and landscaping, homemakers, housekeeping, cleaning and janitorial workers, and retail and food service. The strongest predictor of willingness was confidence with the safety of the vaccine (r = 0.723, p < 0.001), followed by concern with protecting others by being vaccinated (r = 0.574, p < 0.001), and believing COVID-19 was serious enough to merit vaccination (r = 0.478, p < 0.00). Using multiple regression, confidence in safety was the strongest predictor for all groups. Protecting others was strongest for 13 of 15 demographic groups and 8 of 11 occupational groups. College educated, non-Hispanic Whites, first responders, construction, maintenance and landscape workers, housekeeping, cleaning and janitorial workers all gave greater weight to complacency about the disease.

603052,Impact of a viral respiratory epidemic on the practice of medicine and rehabilitation: Severe acute respiratory syndrome,2004-08-01,"OBJECTIVE: The study aimed to 1) measure the prevalence of depression and anxiety among Iraqi pharmacy and medical students at a number of universities in Baghdad using Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and 2) investigate the association between various sociodemographic factors and students’ HADS scores. METHODS: This study was based on a cross-sectional descriptive design in four universities in Baghdad, Iraq. Depression and anxiety were screened using an Arabic version of the HADS. An online survey was administered via Qualtrics to convenience samples of students at four colleges of pharmacy and a college of medicine between March and June 2018. Multiple linear regression was used to identify factors associated with depression and anxiety symptoms among the participants. RESULTS: The researchers received 750 usable surveys. The participating students spent more time browsing social media (6.64 hours/day) than studying (1.92 hours/day) and exercising (2.83 hours/week). Approximately forty-six percent (45.9%) of the participants had scores that indicated depression symptoms and one-quarter (24.8%) had scores that indicated depression borderline symptoms. More than one-half (52.1%) of the participants had scores that indicated anxiety symptoms, while 20.1% had scores that indicated anxiety borderline symptoms. According to the multiple linear regression analysis, more depression and anxiety symptoms were significantly (p-value <0.05) associated with higher study hours weekly and lower sleep hours at night, academic achievement, and colleagues and family social support during exams. CONCLUSIONS: Pharmacy and medical students may be vulnerable to depression and anxiety because of long study hours.. To reduce their levels of anxiety and depression, they may need more social support, more exercise, more sleep, less social media use and a lower academic workload.","Kathem, Sarmed H.; Al-Jumail, Ali Azeez; Noor-Aldeen, Malak; Najah, Noor; Khalid, Dema ALI",Pharm Pract (Granada),https://doi.org/10.18549/pharmpract.2021.2.2303; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34035869/,374

Data obtained from these devices is used to assist patient management and avoid heart failure hospitalizations. In this review, we outline the various devices, mechanisms they utilize, and effects on heart failure patients. RECENT FINDINGS: New applications of these devices to specific populations may expand the pool of patients that may benefit. In the COVID-19 pandemic with a growing emphasis on virtual visits, remote monitoring can add vital ancillary data. SUMMARY: Wireless hemodynamic monitoring with a pulmonary artery pressure sensor is a highly effective and safe method to assess for worsening intracardiac pressures that may predict heart failure events, giving lead time that is valuable to keep patients optimized. Implantation of this device has been found to improve outcomes in heart failure patients regardless of preserved or reduced ejection fraction.","Lander, Matthew M.; Aldweib, Nael; Abraham, William T.",Curr Heart Fail Rep,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11897-020-00498-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33420917/,374

People who use opioids may be a vulnerable group disproportionately impacted by the current pandemic, however, the limited prior research in this area makes it unclear whether COVID-19 and opioid use outcomes may be related, and whether other environmental and socioeconomic factors might play a role in explaining COVID-19 mortality. The objective of this study is to evaluate the association between opioid-related mortality and COVID-19 mortality across U.S. counties. METHODS: Data from 3142 counties across the U.S. were used to model the cumulative count of deaths due to COVID-19 up to June 2, 2020. A multivariable negative-binomial regression model was employed to evaluate the adjusted COVID-19 mortality rate ratios (aMRR). RESULTS: After controlling for covariates, counties with higher rates of opioid-related mortality per 100,000 persons were found to be significantly associated with higher rates of COVID-19 mortality (aMRR: 1.0134; 95% CI [1.0054, 1.0214]; P = 0.001). Counties with higher average daily Particulate Matter (PM2.5) exposure also saw significantly higher rates of COVID-19 mortality. Analyses revealed rural counties, counties with higher percentages of non-Hispanic whites, and counties with increased average maximum temperatures are significantly associated with lower mortality rates from COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates need for public health efforts in hard hit COVID-19 regions to also focus prevention efforts on overdose risk among people who use opioids. Future studies using individual-level data are needed to allow for detailed inferences.","Qeadan, Fares; Mensah, Nana Akofua; Tingey, Benjamin; Bern, Rona; Rees, Tracy; Madden, Erin Fanning; Porucznik, Christina A.; English, Kevin; Honda, Trenton",Arch Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34130741/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s13690-021-00626-z,374

This model allows us to consider realistic distributions for the exposed and infectious periods in a SEIR model, contrary to standard ODE models which only consider exponentially distributed exposed and infectious periods. We present theoretical results linking the (unobserved) parameters of the model to various quantities which are more easily measured during the early stages of an epidemic. We also stress the main quantitative differences between the non-Markovian and the Markovian (ODE) model. We then apply these results to estimate the state of the Covid-19 epidemic in France by analyzing three regions: the Paris region, the northeast regions and the rest of the country, based on current knowledge on the infection fatality ratio and the exposed and infectious periods distributions for Covid-19. Our analysis is based on the hospital data published daily by Sante Publique France (daily hospital admissions, intensive care unit admissions and hospital deaths).","Forien, Raphael; Pang, Guodong; Pardoux, Etienne",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.06.27.20141671v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.27.20141671,374

This tragedy taught us that we should be well-prepared to control the spread of such infectious diseases and prevent future hazards. As a consequence, this pandemic has drawn the attention of many researchers to the development of portable platforms with short hands-on and turnaround time suitable for batch production in urgent pandemic situations such as that of COVID-19. Two main groups of diagnostic assays have been reported for the detection of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) including nucleic acid-based and protein-based assays. The main focus of this paper is on the latter, which requires a shorter time duration, less skilled technicians, and faces lower contamination. Furthermore, this paper gives an overview of the complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) biosensors, which are potentially useful for implementing point-of-care (PoC) platforms based on such assays. CMOS technology, as a predominant technology for the fabrication of integrated circuits, is a promising candidate for the development of PoC devices by offering the advantages of reliability, accessibility, scalability, low power consumption, and distinct cost.","Shaffaf, Tina; Forouhi, Saghi; Ghafar-Zadeh, Ebrahim",Micromachines (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/mi12080915; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34442537/,374

Nearly half a million international students pursuing their studies in Chinese universities have also been exposed to the psychological distress triggered by the unfolding crisis. In addition to government and medical institutions' efforts, universities have also endeavored to mitigate concerns among these students under quarantine on campus by providing reliable information as well as medical, monetary, and emotional support. In this study, international students' trust in university management teams and its role in remediating their anxieties were evaluated using an online survey conducted after 10 days of the lockdown of Wuhan, China. The empirical analysis incorporates quantitative data from 180 international students. Ordinary least squares regression and probit regression were used in the analysis with the non-robust and robust models. The study found students' perception of trust in university management to be negatively associated with their anxiety levels. Additionally, having trust in university management was found to positively influence students' commitment to the self-quarantine guidelines. These results reinforce the important role of universities and their relationship with international students during public health emergencies.","Khan, Karamat; Li, Yanyan; Liu, Sheng; Li, Chuntao",Front Psychol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34220649/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.679661,374

However, acting as a severe health shock, exposure to an epidemic may induce positive changes in health behaviors among survivors, thereby leading to long-lasting improvement in population health. This study examined the long-term association between exposure to the 2002–2004 severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak and middle-aged and older Chinese adults' cognition assessed in 2011–2015. Drawing on data from the 2011–2015 China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study, we found that community exposure to the outbreak was associated with significantly higher scores on episodic memory, after adjusting for demographic characteristics, adulthood socioeconomic status and health, and community socioeconomic conditions. No such a significant association was found for mental intactness. Mediation analysis showed that community exposure to the epidemic was associated with increased participation in social activities, maintaining close family relationships with adult children and grandchildren, and increased participation in regular physical exercise, all of which were positively associated with cognitive functioning in middle-aged and older Chinese adults. These findings suggest that positive post-epidemic behavioral changes are possible and may have long-term health benefits for survivors.","Wen, Sha; Zou, Hong; Xu, Hongwei",Soc Sci Med,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277953621007218?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0277953621007218,374

Data came from 513 Vietnamese Americans who were subsample of the Asian American Quality of Life (AAQoL) survey (total N = 2,614). The AAQoL survey was conducted with self-identified Asian Americans aged 18 or older in Central Texas in 2015. More than 32% of the Vietnamese sample reported perceived discrimination. A higher level of mental distress was associated with younger age, unmarried status, unmet financial status, poorer ratings of health, fewer years of stay in the U.S., perceived discrimination, smaller social network, and lower levels of acculturation and religiosity. In a multivariate analysis, the experience of discrimination (β = 0.16, p < .01), smaller social network (β = −.10, p < .05), and lower acculturation (β = −.17, p < .05) were found to be significant predictors to mental distress.

Although much has been learned about COVID-19, we do not know much about its neurological features and their outcome. This observational study was conducted on the patients of Imam Hossein Hospital, and 361 adult patients (214 males) with confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 from March 5, 2020 to April 3, 2020, were enrolled. Data was gathered on age, sex, comorbidities, initial symptoms, symptoms during the disease course, neurological symptoms, and outcome. The mean age of the patients was 61.90 ± 16.76 years. The most common initial symptoms were cough, fever, and dyspnea. In 21 patients (5.8%), the initial symptom was neurological. History of dementia was associated with severe COVID-19 disease (odds ratio = 1.28).

Also, 31 patients had neurological complications (8.58%). Anosmia, ageusia, dizziness, and headache were associated with favorable outcome (P < 0.001), while altered mental status and hemiparesis were associated with poor outcome. The mortality rate of patients who had neurological complications was more than twice than that of patients without neurological complication (P = 0.008). Almost half of the patients experienced at least one neurological symptom, which may be the initial presentation of COVID-19. Dementia appears to be associated with severe COVID-19.

Some of them were associated with immunopathogenesis of the severe COVID-19. However, the reports on immunological indicators of severe COVID-19 in the early phase of infection in patients with comorbidities like cancer are scarce. We prospectively studied ~200 immune response parameters, including a comprehensive immune-cell profile, inflammatory cytokines, and other parameters in 95 patients with COVID-19 (37 cancer patients without active disease and intensive chemo/immunotherapy, 58 patients without cancer) and 21 healthy donors. Of 95 patients, 41 had severe disease, and the remaining 54 were categorized into non-severe disease. We evaluated the association of immune response parameters with severe COVID-19. By principal component analysis, three immune signatures defining characteristic immune response in COVID-19 patients were found. Immune cell perturbations, in particular, decreased levels of circulating dendritic cells (DC) along with reduced levels of CD4 T-cell subsets such as regulatory T cells (Tregs), Th1, Th9 and relative expansion of effector NK cells were significantly associated with severe-COVID-19. Compared to patients without cancer, the levels of terminal effector-CD4 T, Tregs, Th9, effector NK cells, B cells, intermediate-type monocytes, and myeloid-DC were significantly lower in cancer patients with mild and severe COVID-19. We concluded that severely depleted circulating myeloid-DCs and helper-T-subsets in the initial phase of infection were strongly associated with the severe COVID-19 independent of age, type of comorbidity and other parameters. Thus, our study describes the early immune response associated with severe COVID-19 disease in cancer patients without intensive chemo/immunotherapy.","Tembhare, Prashant R; Sriram, Harshini N; Chatterjee, Gaurav; Khanka, Twinkle; Gokarn, Anant; Mirgh, Sumeet; Rajendra, Akhil; Chaturvedi, Anumeha; Ghogale, Sitaram G; Deshpande, Nilesh; Girase, Karishma; Dalvi, Kajal; Rajpal, Sweta; Patkar, Nikhil; Trivedi, Bhakti; Joshi, Amit; Murthy, Vedang; Shetty, Nitin; Nair, Sudhir; More, Ashwini; Kamtalwar, Sujeet; Chavan, Preeti; Bhat, Vivek; Bhat, Prashant; Subramanian, Papagudi G; Gupta, Sudeep; Khattry, Navin",Immunol. cell biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34582592/; https://doi.org/10.1111/imcb.12504,374

Severe SARS-CoV-2-associated disease (coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)) was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization in March 2020 and is characterized by cytokine storm, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and in some cases by systemic inflammation–related pathology. Currently, our knowledge of the determinants of severe COVID-19 is primarily observational. Here, I review emerging evidence to argue that monocytes, a circulating innate immune cell, are principal players in cytokine storm and associated pathologies in COVID-19. I also describe changes in monocyte function and phenotype that are characteristic of both aging and severe COVID-19, which suggests a potential mechanism underlying increased morbidity and mortality due to SARS-CoV-2 infection in older adults. The innate immune system is therefore a potentially important target for therapeutic treatment of COVID-19, but experimental studies are needed, and SARS-CoV-2 presents unique challenges for pre-clinical and mechanistic studies in vivo. The immediate establishment of colonies of SARS-CoV-2-susceptible animal models for aging studies, as well as strong collaborative efforts in the geroscience community, will be required in order to develop the therapies needed to combat severe COVID-19 in older adult populations.","Pence, Brandt D.",GeroScience,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11357-020-00213-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32556942/,374
618149,"Relative Bradycardia in Patients with Mild-to-Moderate Coronavirus Disease, Japan",2020-10-11,"In December 2019, clusters of atypical pneumonia with unknown etiology emerged in the city of Wuhan in China. In early January 2020, the Center for Disease Control in China announced that it was identified a new coronavirus, first tentatively named 2019-nCoV and officially named SARS-CoV-2 by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses. On 11 February 2020 the WHO identified the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 as COVID-19 (COronaVIrus Disease-19 based on the year of appearance). Although only a few months have passed since the beginning of this pandemic, numerous studies, case reports, reviews by leading international scientific and medical journals have been published. However, given the unpredictability of virus behaviour and the still limited knowledge about it, many aspects of the infection are still little known. A recent epidemiological study has shown the presence of dysphonia in some patients with COVID-19, with a minority reporting aphonia during the clinical course of the disease. This case study draws attention on a 50-year-old female nurse presented with a history of fatigue for small efforts and persistent dysphonia at the Occupational Health Department of a major University Hospital in central Italy. The patient had a history of COVID-19 infection, which lasted about two months with pulmonary and extrapulmonary symptoms. After two RT-PCR negativities for SARS-CoV-2, dysphonia and fatigue due to minor efforts persisted. The patient, following the persistence of the symptomatology, carried out numerous specialist examinations, which showed no organic alterations. Based on her clinical and instrumental history, we hypothesized a psychogenetic dysphonia related to COVID-19. This case report highlights the importance of personalized medicine with long-term follow-up and good psychological support in patients who tested positive for COVID-19 and in particular in the categories at greatest risk of both contagion and adverse physical and mental outcomes like health care workers.","Buselli, Rodolfo; Corsi, Martina; Necciari, Gabriele; Pistolesi, Piero; Baldanzi, Sigrid; Chiumiento, Martina; Del Lupo, Elena; Guerra, Paolo del; Cristaudo, Alfonso",Brain Behav Immun Health,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbih.2020.100160; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33078141/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2666354620301253; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666354620301253?v=s5,374
618695,Paramyxo- and Coronaviruses in Rwandan Bats,2019-07-02,"INTRODUCTION: In response to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, New York City closed all nonessential businesses and restricted the out-of-home activities of residents as of March 22, 2020. This order affected different neighborhoods differently, as stores and workplaces are not randomly distributed across the city, and different populations may have responded differently to the out-of-home restrictions. This study examines how the business closures and activity restrictions affected COVID-19 testing results. An evaluation of whether such actions slowed the spread of the pandemic is a crucial step in designing effective public health policies. METHODS: Daily data on the fraction of COVID-19 tests yielding a positive result at the zip code level were analyzed in relation to the number of visits to local businesses (based on smartphone location) and the number of smartphones that stayed fixed at their home location. The regression model also included vectors of fixed effects for the day of the week, the calendar date, and the zip code of residence. RESULTS: A large number of visits to local businesses increased the positivity rate of COVID-19 tests, while a large number of smartphones that stayed at home decreased it. A doubling in the relative number of visits increases the positivity rate by about 12.4 percentage points (95% CI, 5.3 to 19.6). A doubling in the relative number of stay-at-home devices lowered it by 2.0 percentage points (95% CI, −2.9 to −1.2). The business closures and out-of-home activity restrictions decreased the positivity rate, accounting for approximately 25% of the decline observed in April and May 2020. CONCLUSION: Policy measures decreased the likelihood of positive results in COVID-19 tests. These specific policy tools may be successfully used when comparable health crises arise in the future.","Borjas, George J.",Prev Chronic Dis,https://doi.org/10.5888/pcd17.200264; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32945766/,374

Intern-nursing students face challenges in providing care for suspected and confirmed patients with COVID-19. This cross-sectional descriptive study aimed to explore the mental strain and changes in the psychological health hub among the intern-nursing students during COVID-19 pandemic. A sample of 150 intern-nursing students at pediatric and medical-surgical units completed the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome COVID-19 Questionnaire and General Health Questionnaire. Study results revealed that the most stressful factors were related to possibility of getting COVID-19 infection (2.89±0.39) and transmitting it to their families (2.72±0.62). Moreover, the availability of cure or vaccine for the disease was the most important motivational factor to participate in future outbreaks (2.64±0.77). Regarding students’ psychological health hub, 77.3% of them felt under strain, worthless and depressed (64.7%, 62.7%) since the influx of COVID-19 pandemic. Binary logistic regression indicated that students’ age (23-24), clinical experience (8 months) and clinical placement in adults’ units served as risk factor for developing psychological distress while, male gender and training in pediatric units were protective factors.

The study draws policy implications, especially for farming systems resilience and the achievement of SDGs 1 and 2. The findings are based on (i) three panel discussions over six months with policy makers and experts working at grassroots to understand and manage the crisis, (ii) key informants' interviews, and (iii) an extensive literature review. Results revealed that the lockdown and transport restrictions have had severe consequences, raising questions on the achievement of SDGs 1 and 2, especially in the already vulnerable regions dependent on food-aid. This crisis has also exposed the strengths and limitations of both subsistence and commercial farming systems in terms of resiliency, offering important lessons for policy makers. Traditional subsistence farming appears to be somewhat resilient, with a potential to contribute to key pillars of food security, especially access and stability, though with limited contributions to food availability because of low productivity. On the other hand, commercial farming - limited to the periphery of market centres, cities, and emerging towns and in the accessible areas - was more impacted due to the lack of resilient supply networks to reach even the local market. Lower resiliency of commercial farming was also evident because of its growing dependence on inputs (mainly seeds and fertilizer) on distant markets located in foreign countries. The observation of crisis over eight months unleashed by the pandemic clearly revealed that wage labourers, indigenous people, and women from marginalized groups and regions already vulnerable in food security and malnutrition suffered more due to COVID-19 as they lost both external support and the coping mechanisms. The findings have implications for policies to improve both subsistence and commercial farming systems – in particular the former by improving the productivity through quality inputs and by diversifying, promoting and protecting the indigenous food system, while the latter through sustainable intensification by building reliant supply network linking farming with markets and guarantying the supply of inputs.","Adhikari, Jagannath; Timsina, Jagadish; Khadka, Sarba Raj; Ghale, Yamuna; Ojha, Hemant",Agric Syst,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33191971/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.agsy.2020.102990; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0308521X20308519; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0308521X20308519?v=s5,374
623944,Evidence of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Reinfection After Recovery from Mild Coronavirus Disease 2019,2020-11-21,"In response to the urgent need to control Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19), this study aims to explore potential anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents from natural sources. Moreover, cytokine immunological responses to the viral infection could lead to acute respiratory distress which is considered a critical and life-threatening complication associated with the infection. Therefore, the anti-viral and anti-inflammatory agents can be key to the management of patients with COVID-19. Four bioactive compounds, namely ferulic acid 1, rutin 2, gallic acid 3, and chlorogenic acid 4 were isolated from the leaves of Pimenta dioica (L.) Merr (ethyl acetate extract) and identified using spectroscopic evidence. Furthermore, molecular docking and dynamics simulations were performed for the isolated and identified compounds (1–4) against SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro) as a proposed mechanism of action. Furthermore, all compounds were tested for their half-maximal cytotoxicity (CC(50)) and SARS-CoV-2 inhibitory concentrations (IC(50)). Additionally, lung toxicity was induced in rats by mercuric chloride and the effects of treatment with P. dioca aqueous extract, ferulic acid 1, rutin 2, gallic acid 3, and chlorogenic acid 4 were recorded through measuring TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-10, G-CSF, and genetic expression of miRNA 21-3P and miRNA-155 levels to assess their anti-inflammatory effects essential for COVID-19 patients. Interestingly, rutin 2, gallic acid 3, and chlorogenic acid 4 showed remarkable anti-SARS-CoV-2 activities with IC(50) values of 31 µg/mL, 108 μg/mL, and 360 µg/mL, respectively. Moreover, the anti-inflammatory effects were found to be better in ferulic acid 1 and rutin 2 treatments. Our results could be promising for more advanced preclinical and clinical studies especially on rutin 2 either alone or in combination with other isolates for COVID-19 management.","El Gizawy, Heba A.; Boshra, Sylvia A.; Mostafa, Ahmed; Mahmoud, Sara H.; Ismail, Muhammad I.; Alsfouk, Aisha A.; Taher, Azza T.; Al-Karmalawy, Ahmed A.",Molecules,https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules26195844; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34641388/,374

CASE REPORT: In this paper, we report two cases of acute pancreatitis at the front line of the patient's symptomatology revealing a COVID-19 infection. Both patients had respiratory symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 and abdominal symptoms consistent with acute pancreatitis later-on confirmed through laboratory and CT findings. Our conservative management led to an improvement of the pancreatitis, though the first patient suffered from a severe form of COVID-19 justifying the using of mechanical ventilation and ECMO, while the second patient exhibited a milder form of COVID-19. Although both patients improved in terms of pancreatitis, the overall evolution was very different due to the extent of the respiratory involvement of COVID-19, as one patient exhibited a spectacular improvement of her respiratory state leading to a full recovery, the other patient suffered a rapid worsening of her acute respiratory distress leading to death following ECMO complications. Our two cases join only few cases of COVID-19-induced pancreatitis that have been reported in the literature. DISCUSSION: in our discussion we highlight the association of COVID-19 and acute pancreatitis as it has been reported throughout literature, we then dive into the suggested physiopathological mechanisms that lay grounds for that association, before discussing our two cases, and emphasizing on the need of further studies to fully apprehend the scale of COVID-19's extra-pulmonary involvement in general, and pancreatic in particular. CONCLUSION: Acute pancreatitis is a sever condition involving potentially severe complications, COVID-19 is an emergent rare etiology recently identified as a causality.","Berrichi, Samia; Bouayed, Zakaria; Jebar, Khaoula; Zaid, Ikram; Nasri, Siham; Bkiyar, Houssam; Skiker, Imane; Housni, Brahim",Ann Med Surg (Lond),https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2049080121006439; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amsu.2021.102693; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2049080121006439?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34377453/,374
628462,Reply to Tleyjeh,2021,"Prediction of COVID-19 spread plays a significant role in the epidemiology study and government battles against the epidemic. However, the existing studies on COVID-19 prediction are dominated by constant model parameters, unable to reflect the actual situation of COVID-19 spread. This paper presents a new method for dynamic prediction of COVID-19 spread by considering time-dependent model parameters. This method discretises the susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered-dead (SEIRD) epidemiological model in time domain to construct the nonlinear state-space equation for dynamic estimation of COVID-19 spread. A maximum likelihood estimation theory is established to online estimate time-dependent model parameters. Subsequently, an extended Kalman filter is developed to estimate dynamic COVID-19 spread based on the online estimated model parameters. The proposed method is applied to simulate and analyse the COVID-19 pandemics in China and the United States based on daily reported cases, demonstrating its efficacy in modelling and prediction of COVID-19 spread.","Song, Jialu; Xie, Hujin; Gao, Bingbing; Zhong, Yongmin; Gu, Chengfan; Choi, Kup-Sze",Chaos Solitons Fractals,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chaos.2021.110922; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960077921002769?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33824550/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0960077921002769,374

633382,Pediatric Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome Temporally Associated With SARS‐COV‐2: Oral Manifestations and Implications,2020-08-07,"OBJECTIVES: The posterior approach in total hip arthroplasty (THA) often requires dissection of the short external rotators (SERs), which could increase the postoperative dislocation rate. The reattachment of the dissected SERs has been reported to reduce the dislocation rate, while such repair generally causes progression of muscle atrophy. 1 of the suggested causes of atrophy is reduced blood flow to the repaired SERs. The present study aimed to measure the blood flow of the SERs before dissection (pre-tenotomy) and after reattachment (post-reattachment) during the posterior approach in THA. METHODS: This prospective study included 26 patients who underwent THA via the posterior approach. A laser-Doppler rheometer was used to measure the blood flow in the following SERs at the time of pre-tenotomy and post-reattachment: the piriformis muscle (PM), superior gemellus (SG), inferior gemellus (IG), obturator internus (OI), and subcutaneous tissue as a control. RESULTS: The average pre-tenotomy and post-reattachment blood flows (mL/minutes/100 g) were: 1.90 ± 0.28 and 1.92 ± 0.40 in the PM, 1.94 ± 0.20 and 1.99 ± 0.39 in the SG, 1.91 ± 0.21 and 1.94 ± 0.30 in the IG, 1.93 ± 0.22 and 1.98 ± 0.36 in the OI, and 1.94 ± 0.24 and 1.87 ± 0.38 in the subcutaneous tissue. The pre-tenotomy and post-reattachment blood flows did not show significant difference in any muscle. CONCLUSIONS: Laser-Doppler blood flow measurements showed that the blood flow is preserved, even when the SERs are dissected and reattached in THA via the posterior approach.","Setoguchi, Daisuke; Kinoshita, Koichi; Ishimatsu, Tetsuro; Ishii, Satohiro; Yamamoto, Takuaki",Hip Int,https://doi.org/10.1177/1120700019864077; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31296062/,374

However, these are even more important for them to adhere to due to their increased levels of vulnerability, particularly to COVID-19. With a lack of previous evidence, we explored the understanding and changes in adherence to COVID-19 public health restrictions over time in people living with dementia (PLWD). METHODS: Unpaid carers and PLWD were interviewed over the phone in April 2020, shortly after the nationwide UK lockdown, with a proportion followed up from 24th June to 10th July. Participants were recruited via social care and third sector organisations across the UK, and via social media. FINDINGS: A total of 70 interviews (50 baseline, 20 follow-up) were completed with unpaid carers and PLWD. Five themes emerged: Confusion and limited comprehension; Frustration and burden; Putting oneself in danger; Adherence to restrictions in wider society; (Un) changed perceptions. Most carers reported limited to no understanding of the public health measures in PLWD, causing distress and frustration for both the carer and the PLWD. Due to the lack of understanding, some PLWD put themselves in dangerous situations without adhering to the restrictions. PLWD with cognitive capacity who participated understood the measures and adhered to these. DISCUSSION: In light of the new second wave of the pandemic, public health measures need to be simpler for PLWD to avoid unwilful non-adherence. Society also needs to be more adaptive to the needs of people with cognitive disabilities more widely, as blanket rules cause distress to the lives of those affected by dementia.

For the vast majority of hospitalised patients, COVID-19 infection posed an extra burden in addition to already known and treated chronic disorders. Therefore, the work schedule and infrastructure have been rearranged in order to minimise the risk of transmission of infection to the personnel as well as to ensure continuous preparedness to perform all endoscopic procedures in patients infected with or suspected of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Between 16.03.2020 and 20.07.2020 we performed 91 endoscopic procedures involving the upper and lower gastrointestinal tract. The majority of those procedures were performed for urgent indications and as a part of on-call duties. The scope of endoscopic procedures was much broader than initially anticipated at the beginning of the epidemic, indicating the need for a change in the recommendations in that regard.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a newly recognized infectious disease that has recently emerged in East Asia and North America. Although the clinical features of acute infection have been well described, mildly symptomatic or asymptomatic infections have not been well characterized. Objective. To assess the spectrum of illness in health-care workers (HCWs). Methods. A prospective seroepidemiologic cohort study was conducted on 372 HCWs in a large teaching hospital in Singapore who were both exposed and not exposed to patients with SARS. Participating HCWs completed a questionnaire and provided paired serum samples, which were analyzed by 2 different laboratories blinded to clinical data, by use of an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay based on a protocol developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and a dot-blot immunoassay, with confirmation by a viral neutralization assay. Results. A total of 21 patients with SARS were treated at our hospital. They were associated with transmission to 14 staff members, patients, and visitors in our hospital. Of the 372 HCWs participating in the present study, 8 were found to have positive antibodies to the SARS coronavirus in both samples by use of both test methods, and 6 had pneumonia and had been hospitalized for either probable or suspected SARS infection, whereas 2 had fever but did not have changes on chest radiographs. All seropositive HCWs had been exposed either directly or indirectly to patients with SARS. No asymptomatic, nonexposed staff members were found to be seropositive. There was a trend towards protection for HCWs who, while fully protected, had had contact with patients with SARS. Conclusions. Although the majority of cases of SARS are associated with pneumonia, a small number of mildly symptomatic individuals do seroconvert. HCWs who are exposed to patients with SARS can be infected with SARS, regardless of the intensity of exposure. This has implications for surveillance and infection control planning, in the event that SARS returns next winter.","Ho, Khek Y.; Singh, Kamaljit S.; Habib, Abdulrazaq G.; Ong, Benjamin K.; Lim, Tow K.; Ooi, Eng E.; Sil, Bijon K.; Ling, Ai-Ee; Bai, Xin L.; Tambyah, Paul A.",J Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14767817/,374

Baricitinib, a janus kinases inhibitor, can potentially suppress inflammatory cascades in severe COVID-19 pneumonia. METHODS: The objective of this study was to compare the clinical outcomes of high dose of baricitinib with its usual dose in patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia. This prospective cohort study was conducted on 238 adult patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia. Eight milligram and 4 mg of baricitinib was given orally to 122 patients in the high dose (HD) group and 116 patients the usual dose (UD) group, respectively daily for 14 days, and clinical outcomes were compared among the groups. RESULTS: Blood oxygen saturation level was stabilized (≥94% on room air) earlier in the HD group compared to the UD group [5 (IQR: 4–5)/8 (IQR: 6–9), P < 0.05]. Patients in the HD group required intensive care unit (ICU) and intubation supports more in the UD group than that in patients of the HD group [17.2%/9%, P < 0.05; 11.2%/4.1%, P > 0.05; N = 116/122, respectively]. The 30-day mortality and 60-day rehospitalization rate were higher in the UD group than the HD group [6%/3.3%, P < 0.01; 11.9%/7.6%, P > 0.05; N = 116/122, respectively]. CONCLUSION: The daily high dose of baricitinib in severe COVID-19 results in early stabilization of the respiratory functions, declined requirements of critical care supports, reduced rehospitalization with mortality rate compared to its daily usual dose.","Hasan, Md.

Although urgently needed, currently there are no specific treatments for COVID-19. Repurposing existing pharmaceuticals to treat COVID-19 is crucial to control the pandemic. In silico and in vitro studies suggest that a nucleotide inhibitor called Sofosbuvir, has also antiviral activity against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), apart from suppressing other positive-strand ribonucleic Acid viruses with conserved polymerase (hepatitis C virus). The aim of this study was to assess if Sofosbuvir improves clinical outcomes in patients with moderate or severe COVID-19. A compre-hensive overview of scientific literature has been made. Terms searched in PubMed were: COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, nucleotide inhibitors, pandemic, Sofosbuvir. Results clinical trials conducted among adults with moderate or severe COVID-19 were analyzed. Patients were divided in treatment and control arms, receiving Sofosbuvir plus standard care and standard care alone respectively. The addition of Sofosbuvir to standard care significantly reduced the duration of hospital stay compared with standard care alone in clinical trials examined.

The aim of this study was to determine the optimal duration of planned delay before surgery in patients who have had SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. This international, multicentre, prospective cohort study included patients undergoing elective or emergency surgery during October 2020. Surgical patients with pre‐operative SARS‐CoV‐2 infection were compared with those without previous SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. The primary outcome measure was 30‐day postoperative mortality. Logistic regression models were used to calculate adjusted 30‐day mortality rates stratified by time from diagnosis of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection to surgery. Among 140,231 patients (116 countries), 3127 patients (2.2%) had a pre‐operative SARS‐CoV‐2 diagnosis. Adjusted 30‐day mortality in patients without SARS‐CoV‐2 infection was 1.5% (95%CI 1.4–1.5). In patients with a pre‐operative SARS‐CoV‐2 diagnosis, mortality was increased in patients having surgery within 0–2 weeks, 3–4 weeks and 5–6 weeks of the diagnosis (odds ratio (95%CI) 4.1 (3.3–4.8), 3.9 (2.6–5.1) and 3.6 (2.0–5.2), respectively). Surgery performed ≥ 7 weeks after SARS‐CoV‐2 diagnosis was associated with a similar mortality risk to baseline (odds ratio (95%CI) 1.5 (0.9–2.1)). After a ≥ 7 week delay in undertaking surgery following SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, patients with ongoing symptoms had a higher mortality than patients whose symptoms had resolved or who had been asymptomatic (6.0% (95%CI 3.2–8.7) vs. 2.4% (95%CI 1.4–3.4) vs. 1.3% (95%CI 0.6–2.0), respectively).

640492,Subcutaneous terbutaline as an alternative to aerosolized albuterol,2020-04-20,"CD13 is a membrane glycoprotein with aminopeptidase activity, expressed on several cell types, including myeloid cells (dendritic cells, monocytes, macrophages, neutrophils, etc.). CD13 participates in several functions such as proteolytic regulation of bioactive peptides, viral receptor, angiogenesis, and tumor metastasis. CD13 has also been proposed to participate in cell adhesion, as crosslinking of CD13 by certain CD13-specific antibodies induces homotypic aggregation of monocytes and heterotypic adhesion of monocytes to endothelial cells. We generated two monoclonal antibodies (mAbs C and E) that block homotypic aggregation of U-937 monocytic cells induced by CD13-specific mAb 452. Moreover, the mAbs cause detachment of cells whose aggregation was induced by CD13 crosslinking. Both mAbs also inhibit heterotypic adhesion of U-937 monocytes to endothelial cells. mAbs C and E recognize membrane CD13 but bind to epitopes different from that recognized by mAb 452. Crosslinking of CD13 by mAb C or E is required to inhibit adhesion, as monovalent Fab fragments are not sufficient.

These antibodies may represent important tools to study cell-cell interactions mediated by CD13 in physiological and pathological conditions.","Garay-Canales, Claudia A.; Licona-Limón, Ileana; Ortega, Enrique",Biomed Res Int,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29789790/; https://doi.org/10.1155/2018/4093435,374
640975,Global commercial passenger airlines and travel health information regarding infection control and the prevention of infectious disease: What's in a website?,2019-11-21,"Since December 2019, the novel COVID-19 outbreak has spread rapidly around the globe and infected millions of people. Although the major transmission route of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is considered to be airborne droplets and close contact, the ocular transmission route has been reported with great concern. The current work summarises the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, the ocular distribution of the major SARS-CoV-2 binding protein, and the experimental and clinical evidence of the ocular transmission route. Although it seems that the likelihood of the ocular surface being an infection gateway is low, SARS-CoV-2 infection or transmission via the ocular surface may cause conjunctivitis and other ocular discomfort. Therefore, good eye protection is an essential safeguard procedure, especially for medical staff.","Chen, Xuhui; Yu, Huimin; Mei, Ting; Chen, Bo; Chen, Liwen; Li, Shanling; Zhang, Xian; Sun, Xufang",Br J Ophthalmol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32788324/; https://doi.org/10.1136/bjophthalmol-2020-316263,374

Treatment measures such as curative therapy and case isolation exert selective pressure by reducing the duration of infectivity, reducing the value of duration-increasing strategies to the pathogen and favoring pathogen strategies that maximize the rate of transmission. We extend the trade-off models of previous authors, and represents the reproduction number of the pathogen as a function of the transmissibility, host contact rate, disease-induced mortality, recovery rate, and treatment rate, each of which may be influenced by the virulence. We find that when virulence is subject to a transmissibility-mortality trade-off, treatment can lead to an increase in optimal virulence, but that in other scenarios (such as the activity-recovery trade-off) treatment decreases the optimal virulence. Paradoxically, when levels of treatment rise with pathogen virulence, increasing control efforts may raise predicted levels of optimal virulence. Thus we show that conflict can arise between the epidemiological benefits of treatment and the evolutionary risks of heightened virulence.","Porco, Travis C.; Lloyd-Smith, James O.; Gross, Kimber L.; Galvani, Alison P.",J Theor Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15615623/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022519304004655; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022519304004655,374
642361,"Pathogens associated with respiratory, gastrointestinal and febrile illness in patients consulting at Mbacke healthcare centre during the 2018 Grand Magal of Touba: A preliminary study",2020-07-22,"PURPOSE: The ocular surface is considered an important route for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) transmission. The expression level of the SARS‐CoV‐2 receptor angiotensin‐converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is vital for viral infection. However, the regulation of ACE2 expression on the ocular surface is still unknown. We aimed to determine the change in ACE2 expression in inflamed corneal epithelium and explore potential drugs to reduce the expression of ACE2 on the ocular surface. METHODS: The expression of the SARS-CoV-2 receptors ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in human corneal epithelial cells (HCECs) was examined by qPCR and Western blotting. The altered expression of ACE2 in inflammatory corneal epithelium was evaluated in TNFα- and IL-1β–stimulated HCECs and inflamed mouse corneal epithelium, and the effect of resveratrol on ACE2 expression in HCECs was detected by immunofluorescence and Western blot analysis. RESULTS: ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are expressed on the human corneal epithelial cells. ACE2 expression is upregulated in HCECs by stimulation with TNFα and IL-1β and inflamed mouse corneas, including dry eye and alkali-burned corneas. In addition, resveratrol attenuates the increased expression of ACE2 induced by TNFα in HCECs. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that ACE2 is highly expressed in HCECs and can be upregulated by stimulation with inflammatory cytokines and inflamed mouse corneal epithelium. Resveratrol may be able to reduce the increased expression of ACE2 on the inflammatory ocular surface. Our work suggests that patients with an inflammatory ocular surface may display higher ACE2 expression, which increases the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Jiang, Zhixin; Zhang, Huan; Gao, Juan; Yu, Hao; Han, Ruifang; Zhu, Lin; Chen, Xi; Fan, Qian; Hao, Peng; Wang, Liming; Li, Xuan",Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci,https://doi.org/10.1167/iovs.62.7.25; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34160563/,374

METHODS We conducted a two-part, phase 1 clinical trial to assess the safety and pharmacokinetics of CIS43LS, an antimalarial monoclonal antibody with an extended half-life, and its efficacy against infection with Plasmodium falciparum. Part A of the trial assessed the safety, initial side-effect profile, and pharmacokinetics of CIS43LS in healthy adults who had never had malaria. Participants received CIS43LS subcutaneously or intravenously at one of three escalating dose levels. A subgroup of participants from Part A continued to Part B, and some received a second CIS43LS infusion. Additional participants were enrolled in Part B and received CIS43LS intravenously. To assess the protective efficacy of CIS43LS, some participants underwent controlled human malaria infection in which they were exposed to mosquitoes carrying P. falciparum sporozoites 4 to 36 weeks after administration of CIS43LS. RESULTS A total of 25 participants received CIS43LS at a dose of 5 mg per kilogram of body weight, 20 mg per kilogram, or 40 mg per kilogram, and 4 of the 25 participants received a second dose (20 mg per kilogram regardless of initial dose). No safety concerns were identified. We observed dose-dependent increases in CIS43LS serum concentrations, with a half-life of 56 days. None of the 9 participants who received CIS43LS, as compared with 5 of 6 control participants who did not receive CIS43LS, had parasitemia according to polymerase-chain-reaction testing through 21 days after controlled human malaria infection. Two participants who received 40 mg per kilogram of CIS43LS and underwent controlled human malaria infection approximately 36 weeks later had no parasitemia, with serum concentrations of CIS43LS of 46 and 57 μg per milliliter at the time of controlled human malaria infection. CONCLUSIONS Among adults who had never had malaria infection or vaccination, administration of the long-acting monoclonal antibody CIS43LS prevented malaria after controlled infection.

646622,Role of Homozygous DC-SIGNR 5/5 Tandem Repeat Polymorphism in HIV-1 Exposed Seronegative North Indian Individuals,2007-09-18,"INTRODUCTION: Studies revealed COVID-19 atypical symptoms such as falls, delirium, confusion, dizziness, unusual fatigue in older patients. Falls in the older population and their consequences are one of the leading causes of disability; they significantly reduce the quality of life and lead to loss of independence and impaired social functioning. The aim of this study is to present the possible correlation between COVID-19 and diseases of the musculoskeletal system, in particular the occurrence of fall-related injuries. SIGNIFICANCE: This article highlights the importance of falls as one of the atypical symptoms of COVID-19 infection in older adults, which is not directly associated with infection and could be misinterpreted. METHODS: The conducted meta-analysis is based on a review of the scientific literature available in English, French, Dutch, Polish in the PubMed/MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, Embase, Scopus, PEDro, GBL databases from December 1, 2019 to July 30, 2020, covering Clinical Trial, Randomized Controlled Trial, Meta-Analysis, Systematic Reviews and Case Reports. The following keywords were taken into account: fall, (hip/pertrochanteric/proximal femur) fracture, aged and COVID-19. Twenty-seven references were accepted for final analysis. RESULTS: It was found that symptoms such as falls observed in the older adults can be associated with COVID-19 infection. Falls and slips are also the most common mechanism for hip fracture during the pandemic outbreak. CONCLUSIONS: According to authors of this study, atypical presentations of COVID-19 should be considered when screening and testing the people at increased risk due to their age. However, further prospective studies are urgently needed to investigate the possible correlation between COVID-19 and falls in older adults.","Gawronska, Karolina; Lorkowski, Jacek",Geriatr Orthop Surg Rehabil,https://doi.org/10.1177/2151459321996619; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33680533/,374

STUDY AND DESIGN: This is a multicenter, observational, retrospective registry to be conducted at 17 centers in Spain and Italy (ClinicalTrials.gov number: NCT04359927). Consecutive patients older than 18 years, who underwent a real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for SARS-CoV2 in the participating institutions, will be included since March 2020, to August 2020. Patients will be classified into two groups, according to the results of the RT-PCR: COVID-19 positive or negative. The primary outcome will be cardiovascular mortality at 1 year. The secondary outcomes will be acute myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure hospitalization, pulmonary embolism, and serious cardiac arrhythmias, at 1 year. Outcomes will be compared between the two groups. Events will be adjudicated by an independent clinical event committee. CONCLUSION: The results of this registry will contribute to a better understanding of the long-term cardiovascular implications of the COVID19.","Arévalos, Victor; Ortega-Paz, Luis; Fernandez-Rodríguez, Diego; Alfonso Jiménez-Díaz, Víctor; Rius, Jordi Bañeras; Campo, Gianluca; Rodríguez-Santamarta, Miguel; de Prado, Armando Pérez; Gómez-Menchero, Antonio; Díaz Fernández, José Francisco; Scardino, Claudia; Gonzalo, Nieves; Pernigotti, Alberto; Alfonso, Fernando; Jesús Amat-Santos, Ignacio; Silvestro, Antonio; Ielasi, Alfonso; María de la Torre, José; Bastidas, Gabriela; Gómez-Lara, Josep; Sabaté, Manel; Brugaletta, Salvatore",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0255263; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34324524/,374

Cu is involved in the functions of critical immune cells such as T helper cells, B cells, neutrophils natural killer (NK) cells, and macrophages. These blood cells are involved in the killing of infectious microbes, in cell-mediated immunity and the production of specific antibodies against the pathogens. Cu-deficient humans show an exceptional susceptibility to infections due to the decreased number and function of these blood cells. Besides, Cu can kill several infectious viruses such as bronchitis virus, poliovirus, human immunodeficiency virus type 1(HIV-1), other enveloped or nonenveloped, single- or double-stranded DNA and RNA viruses. Moreover, Cu has the potent capacity of contact killing of several viruses, including SARS‐CoV‐2. Since the current outbreak of the COVID-19 continues to develop, and there is no vaccine or drugs are currently available, the critical option is now to make the immune system competent to fight against the SARS‐CoV‐2. Based on available data, we hypothesize that enrichment of plasma copper levels will boost both the innate and adaptive immunity in people. Moreover, owing to its potent antiviral activities, Cu may also act as a preventive and therapeutic regime against COVID-19.","Raha, Syamal; Mallick, Rahul; Basak, Sanjay; Duttaroy, Asim K.",Med Hypotheses,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306987720308136?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32388476/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0306987720308136; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mehy.2020.109814,374

For such young people, risks of poor outcomes are related to both mental health as well as their RMD. Times of change during adolescence and young adulthood—transitions—are potentially vulnerable life stages for young people with RMD and warrant specific attention in health care provision. Such transitions include those occurring at puberty, during education, training, and employment, socially with moves away from the parental home, as well as from child to adult-centered health services. There is great potential for rheumatology professionals to support young people with RMD at these transitions in view of their frequent encounters and ongoing therapeutic relationships.

The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on access to and use of health services. We aimed to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 lockdown on asthma exacerbations, medical facility visits, and use of asthma medications in children. METHODS: We used data from a prospective cohort of 213 children aged 5–17 years in 3 Ecuadorian cities and analysed the impact of the COVID-19 lockdown on asthma. Outcomes (asthma exacerbations, emergency room [ER] visits, planned and unplanned outpatient visits, and use of inhaled corticosteroids and Beta-2 agonists) were analysed using repeated Poisson counts (ie, number of events per participant before and during the COVID-19 lockdown). RESULTS: During compared to before lockdown: a) the number of asthma exacerbations remained constant (IRR, 0.87; 95% CI: 0.72–1.05; p = 0.152); b) outpatient visits (IRR 0.26, 95% CI 0.14–0.47, p < 0.001) declined 74% while ER visits declined 89% (IRR 0.11, 95% CI 0.04–0.32, p < 0.001); and c) there was no change in inhaled corticosteroids use (IRR 1.03, 95% CI 0.90–1.16, P = 0.699) while Beta-2 agonist use increased (IRR 1.32, 95% CI 1.10–1.58, P = 0.003). CONCLUSIONS: In a cohort of Ecuadorian children with asthma, health services attendance decreased dramatically after COVID-19 lockdown, but asthma exacerbations and use of inhaled corticosteroids were unchanged.

Our results were comparable to data collected during the actual pandemic in Rwanda, determining the initial places affected after outbreak introduction in Kigali. They also highlighted the effectiveness of preventing outbreaks by targeting mitigation efforts at points of outbreak origin. This modeling approach can be valuable for planning and control purposes in real-time disease situations, providing helpful baseline scenarios during initial phases of outbreaks, and can be applied to other infectious diseases where high population mobility promotes rapid disease propagation.","Randhawa, Nistara; Mailhot, Hugo; Lang, Duncan Temple; Martínez-López, Beatriz; Gilardi, Kirsten; Mazet, Jonna A.

AIM: To develop and test a smartphone-based algorithm for diagnosing CAP without need for clinical examination or radiological inputs. DESIGN AND SETTING: A prospective cohort study using data from participants aged >12 years presenting with acute respiratory symptoms to a hospital in Western Australia. METHOD: Five cough audio-segments were recorded and four patient-reported symptoms (fever, acute cough, productive cough, and age) were analysed by the smartphone-based algorithm to generate an immediate diagnostic output for CAP. Independent cohorts were recruited to train and test the accuracy of the algorithm. Diagnostic agreement was calculated against the confirmed discharge diagnosis of CAP by specialist physicians. Specialist radiologists reported medical imaging. RESULTS: The smartphone-based algorithm had high percentage agreement (PA) with the clinical diagnosis of CAP in the total cohort (n = 322, positive PA [PPA] = 86.2%, negative PA [NPA] = 86.5%, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC] = 0.95); in participants 22–<65 years (n = 192, PPA = 85.7%, NPA = 87.0%, AUC = 0.94), and in participants aged ≥65 years (n = 86, PPA = 85.7%, NPA = 87.5%, AUC = 0.94). Agreement was preserved across CAP severity: 85.1% (n = 80/94) of participants with CRB-65 scores 1 or 2, and 87.7% (n = 57/65) with a score of 0, were correctly diagnosed by the algorithm. CONCLUSION: The algorithm provides rapid and accurate diagnosis of CAP. It offers improved accuracy over current protocols when clinical evaluation is difficult. It provides increased capabilities for primary and acute care, including telehealth services, required during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Porter, Paul; Brisbane, Joanna; Abeyratne, Udantha; Bear, Natasha; Wood, Javan; Peltonen, Vesa; Della, Phillip; Smith, Claire; Claxton, Scott",Br J Gen Pract,https://doi.org/10.3399/bjgp.2020.0750; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33558330/,374

MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Themes and subthemes that reflected patient experiences. RESULTS: Sixty people (24 women and 36 men; mean [SD] age, 48 [12] years) participated. All lived in low-income areas, 47 participants (78%) had more than 4 people in the home, and most (44 participants [73%]) were essential workers. Four participants (9%) could work from home, 12 (20%) had paid sick leave, and 21 (35%) lost their job because of COVID-19. We identified 5 themes (and subthemes) with public health and clinical care implications: COVID-19 was a distant and secondary threat (invincibility, misinformation and disbelief, ingrained social norms); COVID-19 was a compounder of disadvantage (fear of unemployment and eviction, lack of safeguards for undocumented immigrants, inability to protect self from COVID-19, and high-density housing); reluctance to seek medical care (worry about health care costs, concerned about ability to access care if uninsured or undocumented, undocumented immigrants fear deportation); health care system interactions (social isolation and change in hospital procedures, appreciation for clinicians and language access, and discharge with insufficient resources or clinical information); and faith and community resiliency (spirituality, Latinx COVID-19 advocates). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In interviews, Latinx patients with COVID-19 who survived hospitalization described initial disease misinformation and economic and immigration fears as having driven exposure and delays in presentation. To confront COVID-19 as a compounder of social disadvantage, public health authorities should mitigate COVID-19–related misinformation, immigration fears, and challenges to health care access, as well as create policies that provide work protection and address economic disadvantages.","Cervantes, Lilia; Martin, Marlene; Frank, Maria G.; Farfan, Julia F.; Kearns, Mark; Rubio, Luis A.; Tong, Allison; Matus Gonzalez, Andrea; Camacho, Claudia; Collings, Adriana; Mundo, William; Powe, Neil R.; Fernandez, Alicia",JAMA Netw Open,https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2021.0684; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33704475/,374

676705,Improving drought resilience in Northern Murray-Darling Basin farming communities: Is forecast-based financing suitable?,2021-08-17,"The expansion of the novel coronavirus known as SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2), COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019), or 2019-nCoV (2019 novel coronavirus) is a global concern over its pandemic potential. The need for therapeutic alternatives to stop this new pandemic is urgent. Nowadays, no efficacious therapy is available, and vaccines and drugs are underdeveloped to cure or prevent SARS-CoV-2 infections in many countries. Some vaccines candidates have been approved; however, a number of people are still skeptical of this coronavirus vaccines. Probably because of issues related to the quantity of the vaccine and a possible long-term side effects which are still being studied. The previous pandemics of infections caused by coronavirus, such as SARS-CoV in 2003, the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012, HCoV-229E, and HCoV-OC43 were described in the 1960s, -HCoV-NL63 isolated in 2004, and HCoV-HKU1identified in 2005 prompted researchers to characterize many compounds against these viruses. Most of them could be potentially active against the currently emerging novel coronavirus. Five membered nitrogen heterocycles with a triazole, imidazole, and thiazole moiety are often found in many bioactive molecules such as coronavirus inhibitors. This present work summarizes to review the biological and structural studies of these compound types as coronavirus inhibitors.","Seck, Insa; Nguemo, Filomain",Results Chem,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33907666/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rechem.2021.100132; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211715621000370?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2211715621000370,374

Here, we characterize rMVAs expressing the S protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Modifications of full-length S individually or in combination included two proline substitutions, mutations of the furin recognition site, and deletion of the endoplasmic retrieval signal. Another rMVA in which the receptor binding domain (RBD) is flanked by the signal peptide and transmembrane domains of S was also constructed. Each modified S protein was displayed on the surface of rMVA-infected cells and was recognized by anti-RBD antibody and soluble hACE2 receptor. Intramuscular injection of mice with the rMVAs induced antibodies, which neutralized a pseudovirus in vitro and, upon passive transfer, protected hACE2 transgenic mice from lethal infection with SARS-CoV-2, as well as S-specific CD3+CD8+IFNγ+ T cells. Antibody boosting occurred following a second rMVA or adjuvanted purified RBD protein. Immunity conferred by a single vaccination of hACE2 mice prevented morbidity and weight loss upon intranasal infection with SARS-CoV-2 3 wk or 7 wk later. One or two rMVA vaccinations also prevented detection of infectious SARS-CoV-2 and subgenomic viral mRNAs in the lungs and greatly reduced induction of cytokine and chemokine mRNAs. A low amount of virus was found in the nasal turbinates of only one of eight rMVA-vaccinated mice on day 2 and none later. Detection of low levels of subgenomic mRNAs in turbinates indicated that replication was aborted in immunized animals.","Liu, Ruikang; Americo, Jeffrey L.; Cotter, Catherine A.; Earl, Patricia L.; Erez, Noam; Peng, Chen; Moss, Bernard",Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2026785118; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33688035/,374

This study primarily focused on what effect smoking had on hospitalization; however, asymptomaticity and severity were discussed. Data: Data was collected through searches on databases including PubMed and Google Scholar. Eligibility criteria included being RT-PCR verified and including smoking data. Discussion: This study found that smokers were significantly underrepresented in COVID-19 hospitalization on a purely epidemiological level in some areas, including China and Manhattan, but not others: Seattle, Greater New York City Area, and Italy. Furthermore, smokers were equally represented in asymptomatic populations, but smokers will likely experience a more severe manifestation of the disease if they are symptomatic. Further inquiry into possible mechanisms by which the observed epidemiological effect is necessary, as it has implications for recommendations on loosening restrictions on social distancing measures. Conclusions and Recommendations: This study recommends that smokers consider themselves to be at higher risk for COVID-19, as they may experience a more severe manifestation of the disease. Health care providers and policymakers should consider smokers at higher risk as well, as there is evidence to claim that smokers may contract a more severe form of COVID-19.","Balabanski, L.",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.12.20129478; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.06.12.20129478v1?rss=1,374

On March 18, a total of 3 distinct clusters of COVID-19 cases were identified at BMH. Diagnosis of the initial 3 COVID-19 cases led to contact tracing, symptom screening, and testing of 495 persons and limited quarantine of affected institutes or departments. When 27 staff members in the catering company tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, the entire BMH staff (7,664 persons) was put under quarantine. Contact tracing in the community resulted in an additional 52,239 persons being quarantined. After 3 weeks, the hospital outbreak was contained; no further spread occurred in the hospital. Rapid screening of cases, extensive testing, prompt quarantine, contact tracing, and social distancing contributed to prevent community transmission in Hanoi and northern Vietnam.","Duy, Cuong; Nong, Vuong Minh; Van Ngo, An; Doan, Tra Thu; Nguyen, Tuan Quang; Truong, Phuong Thai; Olson, Linus; Larsson, Mattias",Emerg Infect Dis,https://doi.org/10.3201/eid2701.202656; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33207153/,374
680866,Clinical characteristics of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome by COVID-19 in Indigenous of Brazil,2020-10-27,"Attacks using animal pathogens can have devastating socioeconomic, public health and national security consequences. The livestock sector has some inherent vulnerabilities which put it at risk to the deliberate or accidental spread of disease. The growing concern of countries about the risks of agro-terrorism and agro-crime has led to efforts to prepare against potential attacks. One recent international effort is the launch of a joint OIE, FAO and INTERPOL project in 2019 to build resilience against agro-terrorism and agro-crime targeting animal health with the financial support of the Weapons Threat Reduction Programme of Global Affairs Canada. Given the importance of strong animal health surveillance systems for the early and effective response to agro-terrorism and agro-crime, the project will use the FAO Surveillance Evaluation Tool (SET) and its new Biothreat Detection Module to evaluate beneficiary countries’ capacities to detect criminal or terrorist animal health events. This paper presents the development of the new SET Biothreat Detection Module and how it will be used to evaluate surveillance for agro-terrorism and agro-crime animal disease threats. The module will be piloted in early 2021 and, once finalized, will be used by beneficiary countries of the joint OIE-FAO-INTERPOL project. Results from evaluations using SET and its Biothreat Detection Module are expected to provide a baseline from which countries can build targeted capacity for animal disease surveillance including early detection and investigation of potential terrorist or criminal events involving zoonotic and non-zoonotic animal pathogens.","Vasconcelos Gioia, Gisela; Lamielle, Gaël; Aguanno, Ryan; ElMasry, Ihab; Mouillé, Béatrice; De Battisti, Cristian; Angot, Angélique; Ewann, Fanny; Sivignon, Adrien; Donachie, Daniel; Rozov, Orr; Bonbon, Étienne; Poudevigne, Frédéric; VonDobschuetz, Sophie; Plée, Ludovic; Kalpravidh, Wantanee; Sumption, Keith",One Health Outlook,https://doi.org/10.1186/s42522-021-00045-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34275496/,374
682014,Universal screening identifies asymptomatic carriers of SARS-CoV-2 among pregnant women in India,2020-09-23,"OBJECTIVE Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) are an integral part of treat-to-target approaches in managing rheumatoid arthritis (RA). In clinical practice, however, routine collection, documentation, and discussion of PROs with patients are highly variable. The RISE LC (Rheumatology Informatics System for Effectiveness Learning Collaborative) was established to develop and share best practices in PRO collection and use across adult rheumatology practices in the United States METHODS: The goals of the RISE LC were developed through site surveys and in-person meetings. Participants completed a baseline survey on PRO collection and use in their practices. RISE LC learning sessions focused on improving communication around PROs with patients and enhancing shared decision-making in treatment plans. During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the RISE LC pivoted to adapt PRO tools for telehealth. RESULTS At baseline, all responding sites (n = 15) had established workflows for collecting PROs. Most sites used paper forms alone. PRO documentation in electronic health records was variable, with only half of the sites using structured data fields. To standardize and improve the use of PROs, participants iteratively developed a Clinical Disease Activity Index-based RA Disease Activity Communication Tool to solicit treatment goals and improve shared decision-making across sites. The COVID-19 pandemic necessitated developing a tool to gauge PROs via telehealth. CONCLUSION The RISE LC is a continuous, structured method for implementing strategies to improve PRO collection and use in rheumatological care, initially adapting from the Learning Collaborative model and extending to include features of a learning network. Future directions include measuring the impact of standardized PRO collection and discussion on shared decision-making and RA outcomes.","Subash, Meera; Liu, Lucy H; DeQuattro, Kimberly; Choden, Sonam; Jacobsohn, Lindsay; Katz, Patricia; Bajaj, Puneet; Barton, Jennifer L; Bartels, Christie; Bermas, Bonnie; Danila, Maria I; Downey, Christina; Ferguson, Sancia; Reiter, Kimberly; Wahl, Elizabeth; Weinstein, Elena; Zell, JoAnn; Schmajuk, Gabriela; Yazdany, Jinoos",ACR open rheumatology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34288595/; https://doi.org/10.1002/acr2.11310,374

SARS was associated with significant long-term stress in healthcare workers, but not with increased mental illness. Reducing pandemic-related stress may best be accomplished through interventions designed to enhance resilience in psychologically healthy people. Applicable models to improve adaptation in individuals include Folkman and Greer’s framework for stress appraisal and coping along with psychological first aid. Resilience is supported at an organizational level by effective training and support, development of material and relational reserves, effective leadership, the effects of the characteristics of “magnet hospitals,” and a culture of organizational justice. Evidence supports the goal of developing and maintaining an organizational culture of resilience in order to reduce the expected stress of an influenza pandemic on healthcare workers. This recommendation goes well beyond the provision of adequate training and counseling. Although the severity of a pandemic is unpredictable, this effort is not likely to be wasted because it will also support the health of both patients and staff in normal times.","Maunder, Robert G.; Leszcz, Molyn; Savage, Diane; Adam, Mary Anne; Peladeau, Nathalie; Romano, Donna; Rose, Marci; Schulman, Rabbi Bernard",Canadian Journal of Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19149392/,374
685631,Systemic Inflammation and Microbial Translocation Are Characteristic Features of SARS-CoV-2-Related Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children,2021-07-06,"Adjuvants improve the adaptive immune response to a vaccine antigen by modulating innate immunity or facilitating transport and presentation. The selection of an appropriate adjuvant has become vital as new vaccines trend toward narrower composition, expanded application, and improved safety. Functionally, adjuvants act directly or indirectly on antigen presenting cells (APCs) including dendritic cells (DCs) and are perceived as having molecular patterns associated either with pathogen invasion or endogenous cell damage (known as pathogen associated molecular patterns [PAMPs] and damage associated molecular patterns [DAMPs]), thereby initiating sensing and response pathways. PAMP-type adjuvants are ligands for toll-like receptors (TLRs) and can directly affect DCs to alter the strength, potency, speed, duration, bias, breadth, and scope of adaptive immunity. DAMP-type adjuvants signal via proinflammatory pathways and promote immune cell infiltration, antigen presentation, and effector cell maturation. This class of adjuvants includes mineral salts, oil emulsions, nanoparticles, and polyelectrolytes and comprises colloids and molecular assemblies exhibiting complex, heterogeneous structures. Today innovation in adjuvant technology is driven by rapidly expanding knowledge in immunology, cross-fertilization from other areas including systems biology and materials sciences, and regulatory requirements for quality, safety, efficacy and understanding as part of the vaccine product. Standardizations will aid efforts to better define and compare the structure, function and safety of adjuvants. This article briefly surveys the genesis of adjuvant technology and then re-examines polyionic macromolecules and polyelectrolyte materials, adjuvants currently not known to employ TLR. Specific updates are provided for aluminum-based formulations and polyelectrolytes as examples of improvements to the oldest and emerging classes of vaccine adjuvants in use.","Powell, Bradford S.; Andrianov, Alexander K.; Fusco, Peter C.",Clin Exp Vaccine Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25648619/; https://doi.org/10.7774/cevr.2015.4.1.23,374

We aimed to determine this risk in apparently non-diabetic individuals. MATERIAL METHODS: Baseline demographic and clinical data from 100 apparently non-diabetic household members (related or unrelated) of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus were collected until 49 days of lockdown and analyzed using the XL-STAT statistical software. A two-pronged analytical strategy was employed. First, the metabolic risk profile related to age, sex, weight, family history, and exercise pattern was analyzed. This was followed by an assessment of the risk of developing type 2 diabetes using an established risk assessment engine. RESULTS: There was a trend towards weight gain seen in 40% of the cohort, with 16% of the population experiencing a 2.1–5 kg weight increment. When all the risk parameters were analyzed together using the ADA risk engine, there was an increase in the ADA diabetes risk score in 7% of the population, with 6.66% in the high-risk group. There was a further increase in weight among 3% of the population who were already obese at baseline.

Severe disease is more often found in elderly people, whereas most of young children and adolescents show mild symptoms or even remain asymptomatic, so that infection might be undiagnosed. Therefore, only limited epidemiological data on SARS-CoV-2 infection in children and young adults are available. OBJECTIVE This study aims to determine the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in children from the city of Tübingen, Germany, and to follow the incidence of new cases in 12 months of follow-up. METHODS SARS-CoV-2 antibodies will be measured in saliva as a surrogate for a previous SARS-CoV-2 infection. Children will be sampled via (pre-schools, primary and secondary schools) at three time points: starting in German summer 2020, before winter and after winter 2021. An adult cohort will be sampled at the same time points (adult comparator group). The saliva-based SARS-CoV-2 antibody ELISA is validated with blood and saliva sampled from adults with confirmed previous SARS-CoV-2 infection (adult validation group). RESULTS Recruitment of participants to this study began in July 2020, and data collection will continue for a planned study period of 12 months. CONCLUSIONS Infection rates in children are commonly underreported due to lack of PCR testing. The study will inform about the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infections in infants, school children, adolescents and the incidence change over the upcoming 12 months (2020/2021) of the city of Tübingen, Germany. The saliva sampling approach for SARS-CoV-2 antibody measurement allows a unique and representative, population-based sample collection.
