They were analysed for pathogenic or protective role, trends, interaction with risk factors, Gene Ontology enrichment and tissue wise differential expression. The database T2DiACoD houses 650 genes, and 34 microRNAs associated with T2DM complications. Seven genes AGER, TNFRSF11B, CRK, PON1, ADIPOQ, CRP and NOS3 are associated with all 5 complications. Several genes are studied in multiple years in all complications with high proportion in cardiovascular (75.8%) and atherosclerosis (51.3%). T2DM Patients’ skeletal muscle tissues showed high fold change in differentially expressed genes. Among the differentially expressed genes, VEGFA is associated with several complications of T2DM. A few genes ACE2, ADCYAP1, HDAC4, NCF1, NFE2L2, OSM, SMAD1, TGFB1, BDNF, SYVN1, TXNIP, CD36, CYP2J2, NLRP3 with details of protective role are catalogued. Obesity is clearly a dominant risk factor interacting with the genes of T2DM complications followed by inflammation, diet and stress to variable extents. This information emerging from the integrative approach used in this work could benefit further therapeutic approaches.

Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) complicates up to 10% of pulmonary blastomycosis in hospitalized patients and carries a mortality of 50-90%. This report describes the clinical course of four consecutive patients with blastomycosis-related ARDS treated with venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) during 2009-2014. CLINICAL FEATURES: Four adults were referred from northwestern Ontario, Canada with progressive respiratory illnesses. All patients developed diffuse bilateral opacities on chest radiography and required mechanical ventilation within 6-72 hr. Patients satisfied Berlin criteria for severe ARDS with trough P(a)O(2)/F(i)O(2) ratios of 44-61 on positive end-expiratory pressure of 12-24 cm H(2)O. Wet mount microscopy from respiratory samples showed broad-based yeast consistent with B.dermatitidis. Despite lung protective ventilation strategies with maximal F(i)O(2) (patients A-D), neuromuscular blockade (patients A-D), inhaled nitric oxide (patients A and D), and prone positioning (patient D), progressive hypoxemia resulted in initiation of venovenous ECMO by hours 24-90 of mechanical ventilation with subsequent de-escalation of ventilatory support. In all four cases, ECMO decannulation was performed (7-23 days), mechanical ventilation was withdrawn (18-52 days), and the patients survived to hospital discharge (31-87 days). CONCLUSION: This report describes the successful application of ECMO as rescue therapy in aid of four patients with refractory blastomycosis-associated ARDS. In addition to early appropriate antimicrobial therapy, transfer to an institution experienced with ECMO should be considered when caring for patients from endemic areas with rapidly progressive respiratory failure.","Bednarczyk, Joseph M.; Kethireddy, Shravan; White, Christopher W.; Freed, Darren H.; Singal, Rohit K.; Bell, Dean; Ahmed, Syed Zaki; Kumar, Anand; Light, Bruce",Can J Anaesth,267,12

Different delivery routes such as intratracheal instillation, aerosol and intravenous injection have been utilized with varying degrees of efficiency. Both viral and non-viral vectors, with their respective strengths and weaknesses, have achieved significant levels of transgene expression in the lungs. However, the application of gene therapy for the treatment of pulmonary disease has been handicapped by various barriers to the delivery vectors such as serum proteins during intravenous delivery, and surfactant proteins and mucus in the airway lumen during topical application of therapeutic genes. Immune and cytokine responses against the delivery vehicle are also major problems encountered in pulmonary gene therapy. Despite these shortcomings much progress has been made to enhance the efficiency, as well as lower the toxicity of gene therapy vehicles in the treatment of pulmonary disorders such as cystic fibrosis, lung cancer and asthma.","Gautam, Ajay; Waldrep, Clifford J.; Densmore, Charles L.",Am J Respir Med,267,22

Influenza infection has been associated with increased risk of various neurological complications. We conducted a population-based registry study to investigate the risk of acute hospitalization of MS patients in relation to influenza infection or pandemic vaccination in Norway. The entire Norwegian population in the years 2008–2014 was defined as our study population (N = 5,219,296). Information on MS diagnosis, influenza infection and vaccination were provided by Norwegian national registries. The self-controlled case series method was used to estimate incidence rate ratios (IRRs) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) in defined risk periods. 6755 MS patients were identified during the study period. Average age at first registration of an MS diagnosis was 51.8 years among men and 49.9 years among females (66.9%). The IRR for emergency hospitalization among MS patients the first week after an influenza diagnosis was 3.4 (95% CI 2.4–4.8). The IRR was 5.6 (95% CI 2.7–11.3) after pandemic influenza, and 4.8 (95% CI 3.1–7.4) after seasonal influenza. Pandemic vaccination did not influence risk of hospitalization [IRR within the first week: 0.7 (95% CI 0.5–1.0)]. Among MS patients, influenza infection was associated with increased risk for acute hospitalization while no increased risk was observed after pandemic vaccination. Influenza vaccination could prevent worsening of MS-related symptoms as well as risk of hospitalization.","Ghaderi, Sara; Berg-Hansen, Pål; Bakken, Inger Johanne; Magnus, Per; Trogstad, Lill; Håberg, Siri Eldevik",Eur J Epidemiol,267,1

To reduce local rates of these morbidities, a multidisciplinary team developed a protocol standardizing evidence-based care practices during the first hour after birth. METHODS: Using quality improvement methodology, the Golden Hour protocol was implemented for all inborn infants <27 weeks’ gestation. Data were collected (2012–2017) over three phases; pre-protocol (n = 80), Phase I (n = 42), and Phase II (n = 92). RESULTS: There were no significant differences in infant characteristics. Improvements in hypothermia (59% vs 26% vs 38%; p = 0.001), hypoglycemia (18% vs 7% vs 4%; p = 0.012), and minutes to completion of stabilization [median (Q1,Q3) 110 (89,138) vs 111 (94,135) vs 92 (74,129); p = 0.0035] were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Implementation of an evidence-based, Golden Hour protocol is an effective intervention for reducing hypothermia and hypoglycemia in extremely premature infants.","Croop, Sarah E.

In this paper, a detailed comparison is given of the behavior of continuous and discrete models for two representative time-delay models, namely a model for HIV and an extended logistic growth model. For each model, there are seven different time-delay versions because there are seven different positions to include time delays. For the seven different time-delay versions of each model, proofs are given of necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence and stability of equilibrium points and for the existence of Andronov–Hopf bifurcations in the differential equations and Neimark–Sacker bifurcations in the difference equations. We show that only five of the seven time-delay versions have bifurcations and that all bifurcation versions have supercritical limit cycles with one having a repelling cycle and four having attracting cycles. Numerical simulations are used to illustrate the analytical results and to show that critical times for Neimark–Sacker bifurcations are less than critical times for Andronov–Hopf bifurcations but converge to them as the time step of the discretization tends to zero.","Darlai, Rachadawan; Moore, Elvin J.; Koonprasert, Sanoe",Adv Differ Equ,267,12

We present the unusual case of a previously healthy 18-year-old male with new-onset status epilepticus admitted to the neurologic intensive care unit for 70 days. Despite treatment with multiple anti-epileptic drugs in addition to IV anesthetics, burst suppression was initially unsustainable and the patient remained in super-refractory status epilepticus. Extensive evaluation revealed an underlying autoimmune-mediated etiology with positivity for glutamic acid decarboxylase-65 antibody. Clinical response with a goal of 1–2 bursts per screen on EEG monitor was eventually achieved after a course of rituximab and plasma exchange therapy as well as a 7-day barbiturate coma with a regimen of clobazam, lacosamide, Keppra, and oxcarbazepine followed by a slow taper of phenobarbital and the addition of fosphenytoin. Remarkably, the patient was subsequently discharged to a rehabilitation facility with complete neurologic recovery. We discuss treatment strategies for new-onset refractory status epilepticus and highlight the role of rapid initiation of burst suppression with high-dose IV anesthetics to ensure neuroprotection while the underlying etiology is addressed with immune-modulating therapy.","Brunker, Lucille; Hirst, Priscilla; Schlesinger, Joseph J.",SN Compr Clin Med,267,12

In this study, we propose a distinct graphene resonator-based system, which is composed of graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) coupled with dielectric grating-loaded graphene layer resonators, to achieve two switchable PIT effects. By designing crossed directions of the resonators, the proposed system exists two different PIT effects characterized by different resonant positions and linewidths. These two PIT effects result from two separate and polarization-selective coupling pathways, allowing us to switch the PIT from one to the other by simply changing the polarization direction. Parametric studies are carried to demonstrate the coupling effects whereas the two-particle model is applied to explain the physical mechanism, finding excellent agreements between the numerical and theoretical results. Our proposal can be used to design switchable PIT-based plasmonic devices, such as tunable dual-band sensors and perfect absorbers.","Guan, Jingrui; Xia, Shengxuan; Zhang, Zeyan; Wu, Jing; Meng, Haiyu; Yue, Jing; Zhai, Xiang; Wang, Lingling; Wen, Shuangchun",Nanoscale Res Lett,267,22

The Certificate in Emerging Infectious Disease Research was developed in 2008 to aid such professionals to respond to complex emerging disease problems. The short-course was modified slightly in 2013 and renamed the Certificate in One Health. To evaluate the immediate impact of the short-course, an online survey of 176 past participants from both the courses was conducted. The survey tool assessed the program’s process, impact, and outcome measures respectively via assessing the courses’ perceived strengths and weaknesses, perceived skills gained, and the participants’ current position, publication status, funding status, and educational attainment; 85 (48.3%) participants completed the survey. Reported program strengths included the curriculum, expertise of lecturers, and diversity of the training cohort. The principal reported weakness was the compressed academic schedule. The most frequently reported benefits included: epidemiological and biostatistical skills, followed by One-Health knowledge, and research skills. Twenty-eight percent of the survey respondents reported publishing one or more manuscripts since completing the course and 21% reported receiving research funding. The course appears to have had a positive, immediate impact on the students’ self-perceived knowledge and capabilities.","Valentine, Marissa A.; Perdue, Christopher L.; Cummings, James F.; Smith, Jacqueline C.; Gray, Gregory C.",J Epidemiol Glob Health,267,33
14001,14001,14001,Prediction of culture-positive sepsis and selection of empiric antibiotics in critically ill patients with complicated intra-abdominal infections: a retrospective study,19.77701,8.319452,2020-11-03,"[Image: see text] Vaccine therapies based on virus-like particles (VLPs) are currently in the spotlight due to their potential for generating high immunogenic responses while presenting fewer side effects than conventional vaccines. These self-assembled nanostructures resemble the native conformation of the virus but lack genetic material. They are becoming a promising platform for vaccine candidates against several diseases due to the ability of modifying their membrane with antigens from different viruses. The coproduction of extracellular vesicles (EVs) when producing VLPs is a key phenomenon currently still under study. In order to characterize this extracellular environment, a quantitative proteomics approach has been carried out. Three conditions were studied: non-transfected, transfected with an empty plasmid as control, and transfected with a plasmid coding for HIV-1 Gag polyprotein. A shift in EV biogenesis has been detected upon transfection, changing the production from large to small EVs. Another remarkable trait found was the presence of DNA being secreted within vesicles smaller than 200 nm. Studying the protein profile of these biological nanocarriers, it was observed that EVs were reflecting an overall energy homeostasis disruption via mitochondrial protein deregulation. Also, immunomodulatory proteins like ITGB1, ENO3, and PRDX5 were identified and quantified in VLP and EV fractions. These findings provide insight on the nature of the VLP extracellular environment defining the characteristics and protein profile of EVs, with potential to develop new downstream separation strategies or using them as adjuvants in viral therapies.","Lavado-García, Jesús; González-Domínguez, Irene; Cervera, Laura; Jorge, Inmaculada; Vázquez, Jesús; Gòdia, Francesc",J Proteome Res,267,1

A substantial body of research has examined the status and determinants of handwashing facilities in healthcare settings and schools. However, its status at home in the community, especially in developing countries, remains unclear. This study aimed to examine the availability and factors influencing basic handwashing facilities at households in Ethiopia. METHOD: We analysed the 2016 Ethiopian Demographic and Health Survey (EDHS) data. EDHS employed a two-stage stratified cluster sampling technique. Data were collected from the lowest administrative unit (kebele). A multivariable logistic regression model that allowed cluster-level random effects was employed to examine factors that affect the availability of basic handwashing facilities (water plus soap) at households. Estimates from the regression model are reported as odds ratios (ORs) with standard errors clustered at the DHS cluster level to account for a sampling methodology. RESULTS: In our sample, only 1292 (8% [95% CI, 7.6%–8.4%]) of the households had basic handwashing facilities. Compared with head of household who had no formal education, the odds of having basic handwashing facilities was higher among head of household who completed secondary level of education (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 1.83; 95% CI: 1.35–2.49) and higher level of education (AOR = 2.35; 95% CI: 1.63–3.39). Odds of having basic handwashing facilities was increased with having radio (AOR = 1.32; 95% CI: 1.10–1.63) and television (AOR = 1.49; 95% CI: 1.10–2.02) at home. Households that had improved latrine were two times more likely to have basic handwashing facilities (AOR = 2.09; 95% CI: 1.56–2.80). Being at higher household wealth quintiles was associated with increased odds of having basic handwashing facilities. CONCLUSION: Very low basic handwashing facilities was demonstrated by this study, whereas, awareness and socio-economic related factors were identified as a determinants for its availability in the household. Greater efforts are needed to increase the coverage of community-level handwashing facilities.","Odo, Daniel Bogale; Mekonnen, Alemayehu Gonie",PLoS One,267,1

Patients with the point mutation NFU1(G208C) and CRISPR/CAS9 (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat–associated 9)-generated rats develop mitochondrial dysfunction leading to pulmonary arterial hypertension. However, the mechanistic understanding of pulmonary vascular proliferation due to a single mutation in NFU1 remains unresolved. APPROACH AND RESULTS: Quantitative proteomics of isolated mitochondria showed the entire phenotypic transformation of NFU1(G206C) rats with a disturbed mitochondrial proteomic landscape, involving significant changes in the expression of 208 mitochondrial proteins. The NFU1 mutation deranged the expression pattern of electron transport proteins, resulting in a significant decrease in mitochondrial respiration. Reduced reliance on mitochondrial respiration amplified glycolysis in pulmonary artery smooth muscle cell (PASMC) and activated GPD (glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase), linking glycolysis to oxidative phosphorylation and lipid metabolism. Decreased PDH (pyruvate dehydrogenase) activity due to the lipoic acid shortage is compensated by increased fatty acid metabolism and oxidation. PASMC became dependent on extracellular fatty acid sources due to upregulated transporters such as CD36 (cluster of differentiation 36) and CPT (carnitine palmitoyltransferase)-1. Finally, the NFU1 mutation produced a dysregulated antioxidant system in the mitochondria, leading to increased reactive oxygen species levels. PASMC from NFU1 rats showed apoptosis resistance, increased anaplerosis, and attained a highly proliferative phenotype. Attenuation of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species by mitochondrial-targeted antioxidant significantly decreased PASMC proliferation. CONCLUSIONS: The alteration in iron-sulfur metabolism completely transforms the proteomic landscape of the mitochondria, leading toward metabolic plasticity and redistribution of energy sources to the acquisition of a proliferative phenotype by the PASMC.","James, Joel; Zemskova, Marina; Eccles, Cody A.; Varghese, Mathews V.; Niihori, Maki; Barker, Natalie K.; Luo, Moulun; Mandarino, Lawrence J.; Langlais, Paul R.; Rafikova, Olga; Rafikov, Ruslan",Arterioscler Thromb Vasc Biol,267,1

During this period, influenza activity was increasing across the country and was much greater than during the same period in previous years, with great harm to people’s health. METHODS: In this study, we isolated two human influenza virus strains—A/Hebei/F076/2018(H1N1) and B/Hebei/16275B/2018—from patients with severe influenza in Hebei, China, during the flu season in January 2018, and explored their genetic characteristics, pathogenicity, and transmissibility. RESULTS: A/Hebei/F076/2018(H1N1) belongs to the human-like H1N1 influenza virus lineage, whereas B/Hebei/16275B/2018 belongs to the Victoria lineage and is closely related to the World Health Organization reference strain B/Brisbane/60/2008. Pathogenicity tests revealed that A/Hebei/F076/2018(H1N1) replicated much more strongly in mice, with mice exhibiting 40% mortality, whereas B/Hebei/16275B/2018 was not lethal. Both viruses could be transmitted through direct contact and by the aerosol route between guinea pigs, but the H1N1 strain exhibited higher airborne transmissibility. CONCLUSIONS: These results may contribute to the monitoring of influenza mutation and the prevention of an influenza outbreak.","Zhang, Cheng; Cui, Huan; Wang, Zhongyi; Dong, Shishan; Zhang, Chunmao; Li, Jiaming; Meng, Keyin; Sun, Yucheng; Liu, Juxiang; Guo, Zhendong; Chen, Ligong",J Int Med Res,267,1

We present deep learning models based on the well-known you-only-look-once (YOLO) algorithm. This model can be used to simultaneously classify and localize the images to identify the species of the gender of field-caught mosquitoes. The results indicated that the concatenated two YOLO v3 model exhibited the optimal performance in identifying the mosquitoes, as the mosquitoes were relatively small objects compared with the large proportional environment image. The robustness testing of the proposed model yielded a mean average precision and sensitivity of 99% and 92.4%, respectively. The model exhibited high performance in terms of the specificity and accuracy, with an extremely low rate of misclassification. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was 0.958 ± 0.011, which further demonstrated the model accuracy. Thirteen classes were detected with an accuracy of 100% based on a confusion matrix. Nevertheless, the relatively low detection rates for the two species were likely a result of the limited number of wild-caught biological samples available. The proposed model can help establish the population densities of mosquito vectors in remote areas to predict disease outbreaks in advance.","Kittichai, Veerayuth; Pengsakul, Theerakamol; Chumchuen, Kemmapon; Samung, Yudthana; Sriwichai, Patchara; Phatthamolrat, Natthaphop; Tongloy, Teerawat; Jaksukam, Komgrit; Chuwongin, Santhad; Boonsang, Siridech",Sci Rep,267,12

Counter-intuitively, weight loss in old age might predict AD onset but obesity in midlife increases AD risk. Furthermore, AD is associated with diabetes-like alterations in glucose metabolism. Here, we investigated metabolic features of amyloid precursor protein overexpressing APP23 female mice modeling AD upon long-term challenge with high-sucrose (HSD) or high-fat diet (HFD). Compared to wild type littermates (WT), APP23 females were less prone to mild HSD-induced and considerable HFD-induced glucose tolerance deterioration, despite unaltered glucose tolerance during normal-control diet. Indirect calorimetry revealed increased energy expenditure and hyperactivity in APP23 females. Dietary interventions, especially HFD, had weaker effects on lean and fat mass gain, steatosis and adipocyte hypertrophy of APP23 than WT mice, as shown by (1)H-magnetic-resonance-spectroscopy, histological and biochemical analyses. Proteome analysis revealed differentially regulated expression of mitochondrial proteins in APP23 livers and brains. In conclusion, hyperactivity, increased metabolic rate, and global mitochondrial dysfunction potentially add up to the development of AD-related body weight changes in APP23 females, becoming especially evident during diet-induced metabolic challenge. These findings emphasize the importance of translating this metabolic phenotyping into human research to decode the metabolic component in AD pathogenesis.","Schreyer, Stefanie; Berndt, Nikolaus; Eckstein, Johannes; Mülleder, Michael; Hemmati-Sadeghi, Shabnam; Klein, Charlotte; Abuelnor, Basim; Panzel, Alina; Meierhofer, David; Spranger, Joachim; Steiner, Barbara; Brachs, Sebastian",Aging (Albany NY),267,1

Despite many years of research, 3D liver tumor segmentation remains a challenging task. In this paper, we propose an effective and efficient method for tumor segmentation in liver CT images using encoder-decoder based octave convolution networks. Compared with other convolution networks utilizing standard convolution for feature extraction, the proposed method utilizes octave convolutions for learning multiple-spatial-frequency features, thus can better capture tumors with varying sizes and shapes. The proposed network takes advantage of a fully convolutional architecture which performs efficient end-to-end learning and inference. More importantly, we introduce a deep supervision mechanism during the learning process to combat potential optimization difficulties, and thus the model can acquire a much faster convergence rate and more powerful discrimination capability. Finally, we integrate octave convolutions into the encoder-decoder architecture of UNet, which can generate high resolution tumor segmentation in one single forward feeding without post-processing steps. Both architectures are trained on a subset of the LiTS (Liver Tumor Segmentation) Challenge. The proposed approach is shown to significantly outperform other networks in terms of various accuracy measures and processing speed.","Wang, Bo; Yang, Jingyi; Ai, Jingyang; Luo, Nana; An, Lihua; Feng, Haixia; Yang, Bo; You, Zheng",Front Med (Lausanne),267,11

Although innovation policy does not bear all the blame for the opioid wave that has washed over communities across the country, innovation institutions are bound up in the ongoing epidemic to a degree that so far has gone underappreciated. This article examines the proliferation of opioid use and abuse through the lens of innovation policy, and it envisions ways in which innovation institutions could help to contain the crisis. Along the way, it seeks to derive broader lessons for innovation policy scholarship as well as recommendations for institutional reform. The opioid crisis challenges the conventional understanding of IP law as a trade-off between allocative efficiency and dynamic efficiency; it highlights the potentially pernicious role of IP protection for addictive and habit-forming products; and it exposes deep flaws in the structure of federal subsidies for and regulation of prescription drugs. It also draws attention to the political and cultural factors that contribute to innovation policy failures. Ultimately, the opioid crisis underscores both the urgency and the limits of institutional change in the innovation policy domain.","Hemel, Daniel J; Ouellette, Lisa Larrimore",J Law Biosci,267,5

This approach facilitates the dissection of the functional heterogeneity of M. tuberculosis–infected alveolar (AMs) and interstitial macrophages (IMs) in vivo. We identify clusters of pro-inflammatory AMs associated with stressed bacteria, in addition to three different populations of IMs with heterogeneous bacterial phenotypes. Finally, we show that the main macrophage populations in the lung are epigenetically constrained in their response to infection, while inter-species comparison reveals that most AMs subsets are conserved between mice and humans. This conceptual approach is readily transferable to other infectious disease agents with the potential for an increased understanding of the roles that different host cell populations play during the course of an infection.","Pisu, Davide; Huang, Lu; Narang, Vipin; Theriault, Monique; Lê-Bury, Gabrielle; Lee, Bernett; Lakudzala, Agnes E.; Mzinza, David T.; Mhango, David V.; Mitini-Nkhoma, Steven C.; Jambo, Kondwani C.; Singhal, Amit; Mwandumba, Henry C.; Russell, David G.",J Exp Med,267,1
20046,20046,20046,Metabolic surgery for type II diabetes: an update,19.415102,8.368755,2021-05-18,"BACKGROUND: Over one third of patients with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) do not respond to current interventions. Ketamine presents a potential treatment option; however, its effects are temporary. Administering ketamine alongside psychotherapy is one potential means of prolonging its effects; however, only a few studies have investigated this treatment method to date, and none have tested ketamine with internet-based or electronically delivered cognitive behavioral therapy (e-CBT). OBJECTIVE: This open-label randomized controlled trial aims to assess the efficacy of a combined treatment method of subanesthetic intravenous ketamine and e-CBT for treating patients with PTSD. METHODS: In total, 20 patients with refractory PTSD recruited from a community clinic will be randomly assigned to either an experimental group (n=10), receiving a combination of ketamine and therapist-administered e-CBT over 14 weeks, or a waitlist control group (n=10), receiving the experimental treatment after 14 weeks. Both groups will be assessed for the symptoms of PTSD and comorbid disorders before treatment, at two midway points, and at the end of the experiment. RESULTS: PTSD symptoms of participants in the experimental group are expected to improve significantly more than those of participants in the waitlist control group (P=.05) with a large effect size (η(2)=0.14). CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to assess the relationship between e-CBT and ketamine and their combined ability to treat refractory PTSD. If successful, this study will open web-based, asynchronous therapeutic options for patients with PTSD and will provide new insights into the functional role of glutamate in trauma-related disorders as well as in learning, memory, and fear extinction.

Previously we showed that tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) fruit is one of the interesting plant resources from which NVs can be obtained at a high yield. In the course of the isolation of NVs from different batches of tomatoes, using the established differential ultracentrifugation or size-exclusion chromatography methods, we occasionally observed the co-isolation of viral particles. Density gradient ultracentrifugation (gUC), using sucrose or iodixanol gradient materials, turned out to be efficient in the separation of NVs from the viral particles. We applied cryogenic transmission electron microscopy (cryo-TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) for the morphological assessment and LC–MS/MS-based proteomics for the protein identification of the gradient fractions. Cryo-TEM showed that a low-density gUC fraction was enriched in membrane-enclosed NVs, while the high-density fractions were rich in rod-shaped objects. Mass spectrometry–based proteomic analysis identified capsid proteins of tomato brown rugose fruit virus, tomato mosaic virus and tomato mottle mosaic virus. In another batch of tomatoes, we isolated tomato spotted wilt virus, potato virus Y and southern tomato virus in the vesicle sample. Our results show the frequent co-isolation of plant viruses with NVs and the utility of the combination of cryo-TEM, SEM and proteomics in the detection of possible viral contamination.","Mammadova, Ramila; Fiume, Immacolata; Bokka, Ramesh; Kralj-Iglič, Veronika; Božič, Darja; Kisovec, Matic; Podobnik, Marjetka; Zavec, Apolonija Bedina; Hočevar, Matej; Gellén, Gabriella; Schlosser, Gitta; Pocsfalvi, Gabriella",Nanomaterials (Basel),267,1

METHODS: The aim of this study was to identify distinct latent groups of internet users based on their PIU risk and to compare their psychosocial outcomes. To achieve this, a nationally representative sample of adolescents of the same grade (N = 1,066, Mean(age) = 13.46 years, range = 12–16) was recruited from several schools in Slovenia through stratified random sampling. RESULTS: A Latent Profile Analysis (LPA) revealed a two-class solution, with Class 1 (n = 853, 80%) featuring ‘low PIU risk’ participants and Class 2 (n = 213, 20%) including ‘high PIU risk’ participants. Behaviorally, the main feature of Class 1 denoted ‘time management difficulties’ while Class 2 was best characterized by ‘mood and time management issues’. Further frequentist and Bayesian analyses indicated that Class 2 presented greater psychosocial risk compared to Class 1 due to significantly higher levels of PIU (generalized and across specific PIU subfactors) coupled with lower levels of subjective well-being and self-control. CONCLUSIONS: Contrary to what was initially envisaged, the two classes did not differ in terms of perceived quality in parent-child relationship. This study shows that PIU patterns and symptom-severity may be developmentally specific, further highlighting the need for clinically age-adjusted PIU screening practices within epidemiological and healthcare settings.","Pontes, Halley M.; Macur, Mirna",PLoS One,267,0

The associations of hospital mergers with quality of care need further investigation. OBJECTIVES: To examine changes in quality of care for patients at rural hospitals that merged compared with those that remained independent. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this case-control study, mergers at community nonrehabilitation hospitals in Federal Office of Rural Health Policy–eligible zip codes during 2009 to 2016 in 32 states were identified from Irving Levin Associates and the American Hospital Association Annual Survey. Outcomes for inpatient stays for select conditions and elective procedures were derived from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project State Inpatient Databases. Difference-in-differences linear probability models were used to assess premerger to postmerger changes in outcomes for patients discharged from merged vs comparison hospitals that remained independent. Data were analyzed from February to December 2020. EXPOSURES: Hospital mergers. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The main outcome was in-hospital mortality among patients admitted for acute myocardial infarction (AMI), heart failure, stroke, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, hip fracture, or pneumonia, as well as complications during stays for elective surgeries. RESULTS: A total of 172 merged hospitals and 266 comparison hospitals were analyzed. After matching, baseline patient characteristics were similar for 303 747 medical stays and 175 970 surgical stays at merged hospitals and 461 092 medical stays and 278 070 surgical stays at comparison hospitals. In-hospital mortality among AMI stays decreased from premerger to postmerger at merged hospitals (9.4% to 5.0%) and comparison hospitals (7.9% to 6.3%). Adjusting for patient, hospital, and community characteristics, the decrease in in-hospital mortality among AMI stays 1 year postmerger was 1.755 (95% CI, −2.825 to −0.685) percentage points greater at merged hospitals than at comparison hospitals (P < .001). This finding held up to 4 years postmerger (DID, −2.039 [95% CI, −3.388 to −0.691] percentage points; P = .003). Greater premerger to postmerger decreases in mortality at merged vs comparison hospitals were also observed at 5 years postmerger among stays for heart failure (DID, −0.756 [95% CI, −1.448 to −0.064] percentage points; P = .03), stroke (DID, −1.667 [95% CI, −3.050 to −0.283] percentage points; P = .02), and pneumonia (DID, −0.862 [95% CI, −1.681 to −0.042] percentage points; P = .04). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These findings suggest that rural hospital mergers were associated with better mortality outcomes for AMI and several other conditions. This finding is important to enhancing rural health care and reducing urban-rural disparities in quality of care.","Jiang, H.

They usually learn node representations by transforming, propagating, aggregating node features and minimizing the prediction loss on labeled nodes. However, the pseudo labels generated on unlabeled nodes are usually overlooked during the learning process. In this paper, we propose a soft labels guided graph attention network (SLGAT) to improve the performance of node representation learning by leveraging generated pseudo labels. Unlike the prior graph attention networks, our SLGAT uses soft labels as guidance to learn different weights for neighboring nodes, which allows SLGAT to pay more attention to the features closely related to the central node labels during the feature aggregation process. We further propose a self-training based optimization method to train SLGAT on both labeled and pseudo labeled nodes. Specifically, we first pre-train SLGAT on labeled nodes and generate pseudo labels for unlabeled nodes. Next, for each iteration, we train SLGAT on the combination of labeled and pseudo labeled nodes, and then generate new pseudo labels for further training. Experimental results on semi-supervised node classification show that SLGAT achieves state-of-the-art performance.","Wang, Yubin; Zhang, Zhenyu; Liu, Tingwen; Guo, Li",Advances in Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,267,22

To tackle this problem, we herewith report the fabrication of the surface functionalised magnetic nanoparticles (MNP’s) and viral RNA-extraction protocol for potential detection of COVID-19. The zinc ferrite nanoparticles were prepared by combustion synthesis and its surface was functionalised by silica and carboxyl-modified polyvinyl alcohol. The MNP’s were characterized to confirm the nano-scale appearance and functionalization.

Nowadays, as the internet provides a vast platform for knowledge exploitation, the need becomes even more imminent. The kind of uncertainty encountered in most of these cases as well as its distributed nature make Dempster-Shafer (D-S) Theory to be an appropriate framework for its representation. However, we have to face the drawback of the computation burden of Dempster’s rule of combination due to its combinatorial behavior. Constraint Programming (CP) has proved to be an efficient tool in cases where results have to satisfy some specified properties and pruning of the computation space can be achieved. As D-S theory measures’ computation fulfills this requirement, CP seems a promising framework to employ for this purpose. In this paper, we present our approach to use CP to compute the belief and plausibility measures of D-S Theory and Dempster’s rule of combination as well as the results of the effort. As it was expected, the results are quite promising and in many cases impressive.","Kaltsounidis, Alexandros; Karali, Isambo",Information Processing and Management of Uncertainty in Knowledge-Based Systems,267,21

By looking at the unavoidable harms involved in the confinement and quarantine methods employed during the initial phase of the pandemic, we can develop a harm reduction approach to managing the phase during which society will be gradually reopened in a context of managed risk. The principles that are at the heart of such an approach include a reckoning with all of the harms involved in policy choice, including harms that might be given rise to by policy implementation itself; a focus on the harms to which already vulnerable populations are susceptible; and a strong preference for policies that economize on the use of prohibitions and of coercive state enforcement, and that instead emphasize the agency of citizens in realizing health-promoting behavior change. This framework is applied to a policy proposal that has been discussed in policy circles in a number of countries, that of immunity ‘passports’, and to policies that emphasize the creative use of space and time to achieve physical distancing goals.","Weinstock, Daniel",Public Health Ethics,267,2

This population has been disproportionately impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and the system-wide transition to remote, virtual visits. While COVID-19 has accelerated needs for impactful remote care and research, this has been impeded by low telehealth literacy and structural barriers, such as lack of internet and devices. There are major gaps in the literature regarding telemedicine services in geriatric and complex populations and efficacy rates are variable in these populations.

Here, we present a comprehensive and contemporary literature review that provides insight into NMPSI-type injuries, their mechanisms, clinical practice, management, and expectations. METHODS: An extensive review of the published literature was conducted in PubMed, OVID Medline, and EMBASE journals for studies of nonmissile penetrating spine injuries. Terms for search included NMPSI and nonmissile penetrating spinal cord injury. No date restrictions were used. RESULTS: The search yielded only 17 related articles. Cross-checking of articles was conducted to exclude duplicate articles. The 17 articles were screened for their full text and English language availability. We finalized those articles pertaining to the topic. CONCLUSION: The mechanism of injury in NMPSI occurs in two different stages. Immediate injury is caused by direct damage to the neurological structures. The delayed injury response is caused by damage to the spinal vasculature and activated immune response pathways. Computed tomography (CT) angiograms or formal diagnostic angiograms are indicated to identify vascular injury or development of pseudoaneurysm and can be performed both preoperatively and postoperatively. Surgically, decompressive procedures include laminectomies and hemilaminectomies. Dural exploration may be indicated if a cerebrospinal fluid leak with fistula develops from dural puncture. Further research and technologies are being developed to provide patients who have suffered NMPSI with more resources for a better quality of life.","Fiani, Brian; Figueras, Ryan Arthur; Stefano, Frank De; Gautam, Neha; Khan, Asif; Soula, Marisol",Surg Neurol Int,267,5

Here we investigate whether dimensional salience and dimension-selective attention modulate the cortical tracking of acoustic dimensions. In two experiments, participants listened to tone sequences varying in pitch and spectral peak frequency; these two dimensions changed at different rates. Inter-trial phase coherence (ITPC) and amplitude of the EEG signal at the frequencies tagged to pitch and spectral changes provided a measure of cortical tracking of these dimensions. In Experiment 1, tone sequences varied in the size of the pitch intervals, while the size of spectral peak intervals remained constant. Cortical tracking of pitch changes was greater for sequences with larger compared to smaller pitch intervals, with no difference in cortical tracking of spectral peak changes. In Experiment 2, participants selectively attended to either pitch or spectral peak. Cortical tracking was stronger in response to the attended compared to unattended dimension for both pitch and spectral peak. These findings suggest that attention can enhance the cortical tracking of specific acoustic dimensions rather than simply enhancing tracking of the auditory object as a whole.","Symons, Ashley E; Dick, Fred; Tierney, Adam T",NeuroImage,267,12

In case of hospital admission, continuation of therapy in patients undergoing chronic NIV is necessary and several protective circuit configurations have been recommended to reduce the risk of aerosol dissemination. However, all these configurations increase instrumental dead space. We therefore designed this study to evaluate their effects on the tidal volume (VTE) required to preserve stable end-tidal CO2 partial pressure (PETCO2) with constant respiratory rate. Methods A bench consisting of a test lung connected to an adult-sized mannequin head was set up. The model was ventilated through usual domiciliary configuration (single limb circuit with facial vented mask) which was used as reference. Then, five different circuit configurations including non-vented facial mask with viral/bacterial filter, modification of leak position, and change from single to double-limb circuit were evaluated. For each configuration, pressure support (PS) was gradually increased to reach reference PETCO2. Resulting VTE was recorded as primary outcome. Results Reference PETCO2 was 38(0) mmHg, with a PS set at 10 cmH2O, resulting in a VTE of 432(2) mL. Compared to reference, all the configurations evaluated required substantial increase in VTE to preserve alveolar ventilation, ranging from +79(2) to +216(1) mL. Conclusions Modifications of NIV configurations in the context of COVID-19 pandemic result in substantial increase of instrumental dead space. Re-evaluation of treatment efficiency and settings is crucial whenever protective measures influencing NIV equipment are considered.","Delorme, Mathieu; Leroux, Karl; Boussaid, Ghilas; Lebret, Marius; Prigent, Helene; Leotard, Antoine; Louis, Bruno; Lofaso, Frédéric",Archivos de bronconeumologia,267,7

A total of 19 E. cloacae isolates from pets with urinary tract infection were screened for the presence of fosA, fosA3, and fosC2 and for the genetic context of them by PCR amplification and sequencing. The transferability, resistance phenotypes, plasmid replicon typing properties and genetic environments of fosA- and/or fosA3-positive strains were characterized. Five E. cloacae isolates were positive for fosA and three coharbored fosA and fosA3. No fosC determinant was detected. Transconjugants of fosA3 were successfully acquired, while the acquisition of fosA transconjugants was failed. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of the three fosA3-positive isolates and their transconjugants were ≥256 mg/L, whereas the MICs of the five fosA-positive isolates ranged from 64 mg/L to 256 mg/L. Three plasmid replicons (InCFrepB, InCL/M, and InCHI2) were identified in fosA- and fosA3-positive E. cloacae isolates. Different genetic contexts lay in the downstream region of fosA and fosA3, respectively. Eight distinct patterns based on the similarity value of more than 80% were typed for all the 8 fosA-positive isolates. In conclusion, the fosA concomitant with fosA3 were found in E. cloacae isolates. The fosA3 not only exhibits stronger activity of inactivating fosfomycin than fosA but also possesses stronger potential to spread than fosA. Different genetic backgrounds exist in these fosA- and fosA3-positive isolates, and different mobile elements may confer the dissemination of fosA and fosA3.","Chen, Lin; Ou, Bingming; Zhang, Minyu; Chou, Chung-Hsi; Chang, Shao-Kuang; Zhu, Guoqiang",Microbial drug resistance,267,1

Infection with CoVs typically presents as mild to severe respiratory or enteric disease, but CoVs have the potential to cause significant morbidity or mortality in highly susceptible age groups. CoVs have exhibited a penchant for jumping species barriers throughout history with devastating effects. The emergence of highly pathogenic or infectious CoVs in humans over the past 20 years, including severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV), and most recently severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), underscores the significant threat that CoV spillovers pose to humans. Similar to the emergence of SARS-CoV-2, CoVs have been devastating to commercial animal production over the past century, including infectious bronchitis virus in poultry and bovine CoV, as well as the emergence and reemergence of multiple CoVs in swine including transmissible gastroenteritis virus, porcine epidemic diarrhea virus, and porcine deltacoronavirus. These naturally occurring animal CoV infections provide important examples for understanding CoV disease as many animal CoVs have complex pathogenesis similar to SARS-CoV-2 and can shed light on the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. We provide an overview and update regarding selected existing animal CoVs and their primary host species, diseases caused by CoVs, how CoVs jump species, whether these CoVs pose an outbreak risk or risk to humans, and how we can mitigate these risks.","Kenney, Scott P; Wang, Qiuhong; Vlasova, Anastasia; Jung, Kwonil; Saif, Linda",Veterinary pathology,267,12

Risk factors, histopathological characterization, pathophysiology, prevalence, and management of post-COVID-19 pulmonary fibrosis are poorly understood, and few studies have addressed these issues.Areas covered:This article reviews the current evidence regarding post-COVID-19 pulmonary fibrosis, with an emphasis on the potential risk factors, histopathology, pathophysiology, functional and tomographic features, and potential therapeutic modalities. A search on the issue was performed in the MEDLINE, Embase, and SciELO databases and the Cochrane library between 1 December 2019, and 25 January 2021. Studies were reviewed and relevant topics were incorporated into this narrative review. Expert opinion: Pulmonary sequelae may occur secondary to COVID-19, which needs to be included as a potential etiology in the current differential diagnosis of pulmonary fibrosis. Therefore, serial clinical, tomographic, and functional screening for pulmonary fibrosis is recommended after COVID-19, mainly in patients with pulmonary involvement in the acute phase of the disease. Further studies are necessary to determine the risk factors, markers, pathophysiology, and appropriate management of post-COVID-19 pulmonary fibrosis.","Tanni, Suzana Erico; Fabro, Alexandre Todorovic; de Albuquerque, André; Ferreira, Eloara Vieira Machado; Verrastro, Carlos Gustavo Yuji; Sawamura, Márcio Valente Yamada; Ribeiro, Sergio Marrone; Baldi, Bruno Guedes",Expert review of respiratory medicine,267,1

We describe three patients who independently acquired their infection. These three patients experienced mild COVID-19 and completely recovered symptomatically within 10 days, but remained PCR positive in deep pharyngeal samples for at least 37 days. We attempted to isolate virus from pharyngeal swabs to investigate whether these patients still carried infectious virus. In all three cases, infectious and replication-competent virus was isolated and amplified in Vero E6 cells. Virus replication was detected by RT-PCR and immunofluorescence microscopy. Electron microscopy confirmed the formation of intact SARS-CoV-2 particles. For a more detailed analysis, all three isolates were characterized by whole-genome sequencing (WGS). The sequence data revealed that the isolates belonged to the 20A or 20C clade, and two mutations in ORF8 were identified among other mutations that could be relevant for establishing a long-term infection. Characterization of the humoral immune response in comparison to patients that had fully recovered from mild COVID-19 revealed a lack of antibodies binding to sequential epitopes of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) for the long-term infected patients. Thus, a small portion of COVID-19 patients displays long-term infectivity and termination of quarantine periods after 14 days, without PCR-based testing, should be reconsidered critically.","Zahn, Tobias; Mhedhbi, Ines; Hein, Sascha; Raupach, Jan; Miskey, Csaba; Husria, Younes; Bayanga, Kathrin; Bartel, Detlef; Vieths, Stefan; Ivics, Zoltan; Oberle, Doris; Keller-Stanislawski, Brigitte; Herrlein, Marie-Luise; Maier, Thorsten Jürgen; Hildt, Eberhard",Allergy,267,10

Some evidence suggests that high IQ is associated with later sleep patterns. However, it is unclear whether the relationship between IQ and later sleep is due to biological or social effects, such as the timing of working hours. We investigated the association between habitual sleep timing during work days and work-free days, working time and membership in Mensa, an organization of highly intelligent individuals (IQ ≥130) using a sample of 1,172 adults split between Mensa members and age- and sex-matched volunteers from a large web-based database. We found no difference in chronotype, and the later sleep timing of Mensa members on work days was fully accounted for by later work start times. Our results indicate that later sleep timing in those with higher IQs is not due to physiological differences, but rather due to later work schedules. Later working times and the resulting lower social jetlag may be one of the reasons why higher IQ is associated with lower prospective morbidity and mortality.","Ujma, Péter P; Baudson, Tanja G; Bódizs, Róbert; Dresler, Martin",Scientific reports,267,17

Melatonin (N-acetyl-5-methoxytryptamine) is an endogenously produced hormone which has demonstrated direct and indirect antioxidant and neuroprotective effects. Previous studies have explored the use of exogenous melatonin in improving sleep outcomes in the general population, yet indications for use in schizophrenia are unclear. AIM To synthesize the evidence from clinical trials investigating prescribed melatonin as an adjunctive therapy in patients with schizophrenia. METHODS A systematic literature review of MEDLINE (Ovid), Embase, PsychINFO, and PubMed on the 27/08/20; and CINAHL and Cochrane Library databases, was conducted. Inclusion criteria were: a peer-reviewed clinical trial published in English; included a group of patients with schizophrenia; used melatonin as an adjunctive therapy; and reported any outcome of any duration. Exclusion criteria were: neurodegenerative diseases, primary sleep disorders, co-morbid substance use or animal studies. RESULTS Fifteen studies were included in the current review with the following primary outcomes: sleep (n = 6), metabolic profile (n = 3), tardive dyskinesia (n = 3), cognitive function (n = 2) and benzodiazepine discontinuation (n = 1). CONCLUSION Adjunctive melatonin therapy has some positive outcomes for sleep, metabolic profile and tardive dyskinesia in patients with schizophrenia. No beneficial effect of melatonin was observed on outcomes of cognition or benzodiazepine discontinuation. Future studies utilizing larger samples and investigations specifically comparing the effect of melatonin as adjunctive therapy with different antipsychotics in patients with schizophrenia are required.","Duan, Cathy; Jenkins, Zoe M; Castle, David",World journal of psychiatry,267,1

Despite the efficacy of treatment, the use of this therapy has met some limitations associated with possible damage to normal brain tissues located beyond the tumor site. In this context, the exploration of the harmful effects of protons on the normal brain tissues is of particular interest. We have investigated changes in the total mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) copy number and identified mtDNA mutant copies in three brain regions (the hippocampus, cortex and cerebellum) of rats after irradiation their whole-head with 150 MeV protons at doses of 3 and 5 Gy. The study was performed in 2-months old male Spraque Dawley rats (n = 5 each group). The mtDNA copy numbers were determined by real-time PCR. The level of mtDNA heteroplasmy was estimated using Surveyor nuclease technology. Our results show that after head exposure to protons, levels of mtDNA copy number in three rat brain regions increase significantly as the levels of mtDNA mutant copies increase. The most significant elevation is observed in the hippocampus. In conclusion, an increase in mtDNA mutant copies may contribute to mitochondrial dysfunction accompanied by increased oxidative stress in different brain regions and promote the development of neurodegenerative diseases and the induction of carcinogenesis.","Abdullaev, Serazhutdin; Bulanova, Tatiana; Timoshenko, Gennady; Gaziev, Azhub I",Molecular biology reports,267,19

Although COVID-19 is diagnosed with a nasopharyngeal swab, detection of pulmonary involvement is crucial for safe patient discharge. Computed tomography (CT) is currently the gold standard. To treat paucisymptomatic patients, we have implemented a ""fast track"" pathway in our emergency department, using LUS as a valid alternative. Minimal data is available in the literature about interobserver reliability and the level of expertise needed to perform a reliable examination. Our aim was to assess these. MATERIALS AND METHODS This was a single-center prospective study. We enrolled 96 patients. 12 lung areas were explored in each patient with a semiquantitative assessment of pulmonary aeration loss in order to obtain the LUS score. Scans were performed by two different operators, an expert and a novice, who were blinded to their colleague's results. RESULTS 96 patients were enrolled. The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) showed excellent agreement between the expert and the novice operator (ICC 0.975; 0.962-0.983); demographic features (age, sex, and chronic pulmonary disease) did not influence the reproducibility of the method. The ICC was 0.973 (0.950-0.986) in males, 0.976 (0.959-0.986) in females; 0.965 (0.940-0.980) in younger patients (≤ 46 yrs), and 0.973 (0.952-0.985) in older (> 46 yrs) patients. The ICC was 0.967 (0.882-0.991) in patients with pulmonary disease and 0.975 (0.962-0.984) in the other patients. The learning curve showed an increase in interobserver agreement. CONCLUSION Our results confirm the feasibility and reproducibility of the method among operators with different levels of expertise, with a rapid learning curve.","De Molo, Chiara; Consolini, Silvia; Salvatore, Veronica; Grignaschi, Alice; Lanotte, Antonella; Masi, Livia; Giostra, Fabrizio; Serra, Carla",Ultraschall in der Medizin,267,1

Initial reports on the use of endoscopic vacuum therapy (EVT) of Boerhaave's syndrome are now available. This article describes the experiences gained from the clinical application in two patients using this new surgical endoscopic procedure. The current literature regarding treatment of Boerhaave's syndrome is presented. MATERIAL AND METHODS Open-pore drainage is endoscopically placed either through the transmural defect in the extraluminal wound cavity (intracavitary EVT) or overlapping the defect into the esophageal lumen (intraluminal EVT). The application of a negative pressure results in active drainage directed to the lumen and simultaneously in defect closure. Through these therapeutic measures the perforation defect and the septic focus can be healed. Open-pore drains are manufactured from drainage tubes and open-pore foam or an open-pore film. RESULTS In both patients the distal esophageal perforation defects were completely healed using EVT. In 1 patient the treatment with EVT alone lasted 8 days. For the second patient EVT was combined with an open thoracotomy for decortication of pleural empyema. The treatment with EVT lasted 23 days and 1 cycle of EVT was carried out with an new open-pore film drainage (OFD). Surgical treatment to close the defect or an esophageal resection was not necessary for both patients. In the currently available studies and single case reports of ETV for Boerhaave's syndrome, 11 patients (84 %) of a total of 13 patients have been successfully treated. CONCLUSION First clinical experiences have demonstrated that with EVT draining of the septic focus and closure of the Boerhaave defect at the gastroesophageal junction can be achieved. The EVT is an organ-preserving endoscopic surgical treatment, which can be an alternative and complementary to traditional surgery.","Loske, G; Schorsch, T",Der Chirurg; Zeitschrift fur alle Gebiete der operativen Medizen,267,32

Despite the importance of HTC for HIV control, access to HTC services among female sex workers (FSWs) in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) remains suboptimal and little is known about factors influencing FSWs' access to HTC. Guided by the client-centred conceptual framework, we conducted a systematic review to understand the facilitators and barriers influencing FSWs in SSA to access HTC services. METHODS A systematic search was conducted in MEDLINE, POPLINE and Web of Science databases for literature published between January 2000 and July 2017. References of relevant articles were also searched. We included primary studies of any design, conducted in SSA and published in the English language. Studies conducted in multi-sites inclusive of SSA were included only if data from sites in SSA were separately analysed and reported. Similarly, studies that included other subpopulations were only eligible if a separate analysis was done for FSWs. This review excluded papers published as systematic reviews, editorial comments and mathematical modelling. The protocol for this review is registered in the Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO), registration number CRD42017062203. RESULTS This review shows that factors related to approachability, acceptability, availability, affordability and appropriateness of the services are crucial in influencing access to HTC services among FSWs in SSA. These factors were mediated by individual attributes such as HIV risk perceptions, awareness of the availability of HTC, and perceptions of the importance and quality of HTC services. The decision to utilise HTC was predominantly hampered by discriminatory social norms such as HIV stigma and criminalisation of sex work. CONCLUSIONS FSWs' access to HTC is facilitated by multiple factors, including individual awareness of the availability of HTC services, and perceived quality of HTC especially with regard to assured confidentiality. Concerns about HIV stigma and fear about discrimination due to community intolerance of sex work acted as major barriers for FSWs to seek HTC services from the facilities offering health services to the general population.","Nnko, Soori; Kuringe, Evodius; Nyato, Daniel; Drake, Mary; Casalini, Caterina; Shao, Amani; Komba, Albert; Baral, Stefan; Wambura, Mwita; Changalucha, John",BMC public health,267,1

BACKGROUND Direct peritoneal visualization, either by laparotomy or laparoscopy, continues to be the gold standard in diagnosing PC. We reported, in animal study, that combining single-incision laparoscopic surgery and flexible endoscopy improved evaluation of the peritoneal cavity in a live porcine model and in four human cadavers. METHODS Patients, undergoing surgical exploration for diagnosis and staging of PC, were included in a prospective study. Using a superiority design a sample size of 47 patients was determined. Through a single incision, a standardized peritoneoscopy was conducted with rigid (SIRE) and with flexible endoscope (SIFE). Primary outcome was the access success rates for the 13 regions of the Peritoneal Carcinomatosis Index (PCI). RESULTS Overall access to the 13 regions of PCI was successful in 83 % of the cases with SIRE and in 91.1 % with SIFE (p < 10(-10)). SIFE access rates were superior to SIREs' in the regions: R1 (87.2 vs. 61.7 %, p = 0.002), R2 (87.2 vs. 66 %, p = 0.004), R3 (85.1 vs. 59.6 %, p = 0.001) and R6 (80.9 vs. 61.7 %, p = 0.008). The mean PCI was higher (p < 10(4)) with SIFE 12.77 (±11.97) than with SIRE 11.77 (±11.63). CONCLUSION This prospective, comparative study shows that SIFE was significantly superior to SIRE in the exploration of some difficult-to-access peritoneal areas, located in regions 1, 2, 3 and 6. These two minimally invasive staging procedures are safe, feasible and have to be seen as complementary rather than competing.","Najah, Haythem; Lo Dico, Réa; Grienay, Marion; Dohan, Anthony; Dray, Xavier; Pocard, Marc",Surgical endoscopy,267,24

The formation of stable blood clots or hemostasis is essential to prevent major blood loss and death from excessive bleeding. However, the body's self-coagulation process cannot accomplish timely hemostasis without the assistance of hemostatic agents under some conditions. In the past two decades, topical hemostatic materials and devices containing platelets, fibrin, and polysaccharides have been gradually developed and introduced to induce faster or more stable blood clot formation, updating or iterating traditional hemostatic materials. Despite the various forms and functions of topical hemostatic materials that have been developed for different clinical conditions, uncontrolled hemorrhage still causes over 30% of trauma deaths across the world. Therefore, it is important to fabricate fast, efficient, safe, and ready-to-use novel hemostatic materials.

The mean symptom severity decreased from 11.24 ± 1.71 to 3.24 ± 0.84, mean symptom frequency decreased from 11.62 ± 1.70 to 3.45 ± 0.85, and mean total symptom score decreased from 22.85 ± 3.40 to 6.69 ± 1.69 (p < 0.0001). Three patients had recurrences on the upper gastrointestinal (UGI) series. Only one required reoperation. CONCLUSIONS Laparoscopic PEH repair with a falciform ligament buttress is a viable option. Ongoing follow-up will demonstrate the utility of this approach to decrease morbidity and recurrence rates for paraesophageal hernia repairs.","Laird, Raymond; Brody, Fred; Harr, Jeffrey N; Richards, Nathan G; Zeddun, Steve",Journal of gastrointestinal surgery : official journal of the Society for Surgery of the Alimentary Tract,267,1

Initial time strain occasionally results in treatment of patients with an alternate diagnosis (stroke mimics). We investigated whether intravenous thrombolysis is safe in these patients. METHODS In this multicenter observational cohort study containing 5581 consecutive patients treated with intravenous thrombolysis, we determined the frequency and the clinical characteristics of stroke mimics. For safety, we compared the symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (European Cooperative Acute Stroke Study II [ECASS-II] definition) rate of stroke mimics with ischemic strokes. RESULTS One hundred stroke mimics were identified, resulting in a frequency of 1.8% (95% confidence interval, 1.5-2.2). Patients with a stroke mimic were younger, more often female, and had fewer risk factors except smoking and previous stroke or transient ischemic attack. The symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage rate in stroke mimics was 1.0% (95% confidence interval, 0.0-5.0) compared with 7.9% (95% confidence interval, 7.2-8.7) in ischemic strokes. CONCLUSIONS In experienced stroke centers, among patients treated with intravenous thrombolysis, only a few had a final diagnosis other than stroke. The complication rate in these stroke mimics was low.","Zinkstok, Sanne M; Engelter, Stefan T; Gensicke, Henrik; Lyrer, Philippe A; Ringleb, Peter A; Artto, Ville; Putaala, Jukka; Haapaniemi, Elena; Tatlisumak, Turgut; Chen, Yaohua; Leys, Didier; Sarikaya, Hakan; Michel, P; Odier, Céline; Berrouschot, Jörg; Arnold, Marcel; Heldner, Mirjam R; Zini, Andrea; Fioravanti, Valentina; Padjen, Visnja; Beslac-Bumbasirevic, Ljiljana; Pezzini, Alessandro; Roos, Yvo B; Nederkoorn, Paul J",Stroke,267,33

It decreases the postoperative pain and discomfort in the inguinal area. The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of the sandwich approach, which is a new technique for creating a preperitoneal space. METHODS The operation was performed via the sandwich approach. We made sure to protect the preperitoneal fascia areolar layer when making the preperitoneal space. RESULTS We performed TAPP in 745 patients (876 hernias) treated between October 2006 and April 2015 at Himeji Medical Center and Kurashiki Central Hospital. Before October 2010, we did not use the sandwich approach, and recurrence was observed in three patients. From October 2010, we always used the sandwich approach and never experienced any cases of recurrence. Clavien-Dindo classification Grade 3 or higher postoperative complications occurred in 6 patients (0.8%) between October 2006 and April 2015. Mesh-related ileus was the most frequently observed morbidity. There were no cases of vas differentia or spermatic vessel injury, postoperative chronic pain, or urinary retention. CONCLUSION The sandwich approach is feasible as another standard dissective procedure for TAPP.","Nagahisa, Yoshio; Homma, Shusaku; Chen, Kai; Sakurai, Reo; Hattori, Nobuaki; Kawamoto, Yusuke; Hashida, Kazuki; Okabe, Michio; Itou, Tadashi",Surgery today,267,1

Administration or injection of exogenous insulin cannot mimic the endogenous insulin secreted by a healthy pancreas. Pancreas and islet transplantation have emerged as promising treatments for reconstructing the normal regulation of blood glucose in T1DM patients. However, a critical shortage of pancreases and islets derived from human organ donors, complications associated with transplantations, high cost, and limited procedural availability remain bottlenecks in the widespread application of these strategies. Attempts have been directed to accommodate the increasing population of patients with T1DM. Stem cell therapy holds great potential for curing patients with T1DM. With the advent of research on stem cell therapy for various diseases, breakthroughs in stem cell-based therapy for T1DM have been reported. However, many unsolved issues need to be addressed before stem cell therapy will be clinically feasible for diabetic patients.

N-player linear quadratic differential game theory is used to describe the system under study. N-player differential game theory can not be used directly in actual scenerie, since the robot cannot know humans' control objectives in advance. In order to let the robot know humans' control objectives, the paper presents an online estimation method to identify unknown humans' control objectives based on the recursive least squares algorithm. The Nash equilibrium solution of human-robot-human interaction is obtained by solving the coupled Riccati equation. Adaptive optimal control can be achieved during the human-robot-human physical interaction. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated by rigorous theoretical analysis and simulations. The simulation results show that the proposed controller can achieve adaptive optimal control during the interaction between the robot and two humans.

Closed-incision negative-pressure therapy can be used postoperatively to support healing by promoting angiogenesis and decreasing tension. The authors hypothesized that using it with panniculectomies would minimize complications, and that a longer duration of therapy would not increase the incidence of complications. The authors also evaluated whether closed-incision negative-pressure therapy malfunction was associated with complications. METHODS This retrospective, uncontrolled case series analyzed 91 patients who underwent panniculectomies managed with closed-incision negative-pressure therapy performed by a single surgeon from 2014 to 2018. Patients were followed for 6 months; therapy duration and malfunction were recorded. Patients were placed into therapy duration groups (2 to 7, 8 to 10, or >10 days). Complications managed conservatively were minor and major if they required intervention. Odds ratios were performed with 95 percent confidence intervals and p values. RESULTS Mean follow-up was 225.1 days and mean closed-incision negative-pressure therapy duration was 10.5 days. Major complications were reported in five patients (5.5 percent), infections in four (4.4 percent), dehiscence in two (2.2 percent), and seroma in four (4.4 percent). Patients with malfunction [n = 16 (17.6 percent)] were more likely to experience complications (OR, 3.3; p = 0.043). No significant increase in complications was found with therapy duration longer than 10 days, but potentially there is an increased risk of infection (OR, 4.0; p = 0.067). CONCLUSIONS Although high complication rates have been associated with panniculectomies, the authors' results show that low complication rates can be achieved with closed-incision negative-pressure therapy. Randomized controlled trials need to be conducted evaluating different therapy systems and the optimal duration of therapy with panniculectomies.

The potential for a future pandemic originating from animal reservoirs or health care-associated events is a major public health concern. There are no vaccines or therapeutic agents currently available for MERS-CoV. Using a probe-based single B cell cloning strategy, we have identified and characterized multiple neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) specifically binding to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) or S1 (non-RBD) regions from a convalescent MERS-CoV-infected patient and from immunized rhesus macaques. RBD-specific MAbs tended to have greater neutralizing potency than non-RBD S1-specific MAbs. Six RBD-specific and five S1-specific MAbs could be sorted into four RBD and three non-RBD distinct binding patterns, based on competition assays, mapping neutralization escape variants, and structural analysis. We determined cocrystal structures for two MAbs targeting the RBD from different angles and show they can bind the RBD only in the ""out"" position. We then showed that selected RBD-specific, non-RBD S1-specific, and S2-specific MAbs given prophylactically prevented MERS-CoV replication in lungs and protected mice from lethal challenge. Importantly, combining RBD- and non-RBD MAbs delayed the emergence of escape mutations in a cell-based virus escape assay. These studies identify MAbs targeting different antigenic sites on S that will be useful for defining mechanisms of MERS-CoV neutralization and for developing more effective interventions to prevent or treat MERS-CoV infections.IMPORTANCE MERS-CoV causes a highly lethal respiratory infection for which no vaccines or antiviral therapeutic options are currently available. Based on continuing exposure from established reservoirs in dromedary camels and bats, transmission of MERS-CoV into humans and future outbreaks are expected. Using structurally defined probes for the MERS-CoV spike glycoprotein (S), the target for neutralizing antibodies, single B cells were sorted from a convalescent human and immunized nonhuman primates (NHPs). MAbs produced from paired immunoglobulin gene sequences were mapped to multiple epitopes within and outside the receptor-binding domain (RBD) and protected against lethal MERS infection in a murine model following passive immunization. Importantly, combining MAbs targeting distinct epitopes prevented viral neutralization escape from RBD-directed MAbs. These data suggest that antibody responses to multiple domains on CoV spike protein may improve immunity and will guide future vaccine and therapeutic development efforts.","Wang, Lingshu; Shi, Wei; Chappell, James D; Joyce, M Gordon; Zhang, Yi; Kanekiyo, Masaru; Becker, Michelle M; van Doremalen, Neeltje; Fischer, Robert; Wang, Nianshuang; Corbett, Kizzmekia S; Choe, Misook; Mason, Rosemarie D; Van Galen, Joseph G; Zhou, Tongqing; Saunders, Kevin O; Tatti, Kathleen M; Haynes, Lia M; Kwong, Peter D; Modjarrad, Kayvon; Kong, Wing-Pui; McLellan, Jason S; Denison, Mark R; Munster, Vincent J; Mascola, John R; Graham, Barney S",Journal of virology,267,0

Specifically, a phenyl carboxylate substituent can be shifted from one carbon to an adjacent carbon on a (hetero) aromatic ring under palladium catalysis to often give a thermodynamically favored, regioisomeric product with modest to good conversions. The obtained ester moiety can be further converted to various aromatic derivatives through the use of classic and state-of-the-art transformations including amidation, acylations, and decarbonylative couplings.","Matsushita, Kaoru; Takise, Ryosuke; Muto, Kei; Yamaguchi, Junichiro",Science advances,267,24

METHODS After collecting nurse-related news articles published before and after 'the Thanks to You Challenge' campaign (between December 31, 2019, and July 15, 2020), keywords were extracted via preprocessing. A three-step method keyword analysis, latent Dirichlet allocation topic modeling, and keyword network analysis was used to examine the text and the structure of the selected news articles. RESULTS Top 30 keywords with similar occurrences were collected before and after the campaign. The five dominant topics before the campaign were: pandemic, infection of medical staff, local transmission, medical resources, and return of overseas Koreans. After the campaign, the topics 'infection of medical staff' and 'return of overseas Koreans' disappeared, but 'the Thanks to You Challenge' emerged as a dominant topic. A keyword network analysis revealed that the word of nurse was linked with keywords like thanks and campaign, through the word of sacrifice. These words formed interrelated domains of 'the Thanks to You Challenge' topic. CONCLUSION The findings of this study can provide useful information for understanding various issues and social perspectives on COVID-19 nursing. The major themes of news reports lagged behind the real problems faced by nurses in COVID-19 crisis. While the press tends to focus on heroism and whole society, issues and policies mutually beneficial to public and nursing need to be further explored and enhanced by nurses.","Yun, Eun Kyoung; Kim, Jung Ok; Byun, Hye Min; Lee, Guk Geun",Journal of Korean Academy of Nursing,267,1

OBJECTIVE The objective of this study was to re-assess the safety profile of IAHA in patients with OA, through a comprehensive meta-analysis of randomized, placebo-controlled trials. METHODS A comprehensive literature search was undertaken in the databases MEDLINE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and Scopus. Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trials that assessed adverse events (AEs) with IAHA in patients with OA were eligible for inclusion. Authors and/or study sponsors were contacted to obtain the full report of AEs. The primary outcomes were overall severe and serious AEs, as well as the following MedDRA System Organ Class (SOC)-related AEs: gastrointestinal, cardiac, vascular, respiratory, nervous system, skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders, musculoskeletal, renal and urinary disorders, infections and infestations, and hypersensitivity reaction. RESULTS Database searches initially identified 1481 records. After exclusions according to the selection criteria, 22 studies were included in the qualitative synthesis, and nine studies having adequate data were ultimately included in the meta-analysis. From the studies excluded according to the pre-specified selection criteria, 21 with other pharmacological OA treatments permitted during the trials were a posteriori included in a parallel qualitative synthesis, from which eight studies with adequate data were finally included in a parallel meta-analysis. Since this meta-analysis was designed to assess safety, the exclusion criterion on concomitant anti-OA medication was crucial. However, due to the high number of studies that allowed mainly concomitant oral non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), we decided to include them in a post hoc parallel analysis in order to compare the results from the two analyses. No statistically significant difference in odds was found between IAHA and placebo for all types of SOC-related disorders, except for infections and infestations, for which significantly lower odds were found with IAHA compared with placebo, both overall (odds ratio [OR] = 0.61, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.40-0.93; I2 = 0%) and in studies without concomitant anti-OA medication (OR = 0.49, 95% CI 0.27-0.89). There were significant increased odds of reporting serious AEs with IAHA compared with placebo, both overall (OR = 1.78, 95% CI 1.21-2.63; I2 = 0%) and in studies with concomitant anti-OA medication (OR = 1.78, 95% CI 1.10-2.89), but not in studies without concomitant anti-OA medication (OR = 1.78, 95% CI 0.92-3.47). CONCLUSIONS Using the available data on studies without any concomitant anti-OA medication permitted during clinical trials, IAHA seems not to be associated with any safety issue in the management of OA. However, this evidence was associated with only a ""low"" to ""moderate"" certainty. A possible association with increased risk of serious AEs, particularly when used with concomitant OA medications, requires further investigation.","Honvo, Germain; Reginster, Jean-Yves; Rannou, Francois; Rygaert, Xavier; Geerinck, Anton; Rabenda, Véronique; McAlindon, Tim; Charles, Alexia; Fuggle, Nicholas; Cooper, Cyrus; Curtis, Elizabeth; Arden, Nigel; Avouac, Bernard; Bruyère, Olivier",Drugs & aging,267,1

The process can either be automatic, semi-automatic, or manual, the first often not being sufficiently precise or easily reproducible, and the last being excessively time consuming when involving large districts with high-resolution acquisitions. A high-resolution CT of the chest is composed of hundreds of images, and this makes the manual approach excessively time consuming. Furthermore, the parenchymal alterations require an expert evaluation to be discerned from the normal appearance; thus, a semi-automatic approach to the segmentation process is, to the best of our knowledge, the most suitable when segmenting pneumonias, especially when their features are still unknown. For the studies conducted in our institute on the imaging of COVID-19, we adopted 3D Slicer, a freeware software produced by the Harvard University, and combined the threshold with the paint brush instruments to achieve fast and precise segmentation of aerated lung, ground glass opacities, and consolidations. When facing complex cases, this method still requires a considerable amount of time for proper manual adjustments, but provides an extremely efficient mean to define segments to use for further analysis, such as the calculation of the percentage of the affected lung parenchyma or texture analysis of the ground glass areas.","Cattabriga, Arrigo; Cocozza, Maria Adriana; Vara, Giulio; Coppola, Francesca; Golfieri, Rita",Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,267,27

During HD, ultrafiltration is performed to maintain an adequate fluid condition and is associated with subsequent blood volume (BV) reduction. We aimed to (1) monitor changes in cerebral oxygenation and BV reduction during HD, and (2) clarify the mechanism that influences cerebral oxygenation in HD patients. METHODS Eighteen HD patients and 12 healthy controls were recruited. Regional saturation of oxygen (rSO2) was continuously monitored in the frontal cortex using INVOS 5100C before, during, and after HD, and in healthy controls. Relative change in BV (%ΔBV) was simultaneously monitored during HD using a BV monitor. RESULTS Before HD, patients had significantly lower rSO2 values than controls (56.1 ± 1.4 vs. 70.4 ± 2.5%, p < 0.001). Although %ΔBV significantly decreased from 20 min to the end of HD (20 min: -3.3 ± 0.3%, p < 0.05; end of HD: -12.0 ± 1.0%, p < 0.01), changes in rSO2 values during HD were not significant. No relationship existed between rSO2 values and blood pressure levels, hemoglobin levels, oxygen pressure, HCO3(- ), oxygen saturation, and arterial O2 content before and after HD. Furthermore, changes in rSO2 were not correlated with changes in these parameters. CONCLUSION rSO2 values before HD were significantly lower in HD patients than in healthy controls. rSO2 values were maintained during HD and were not influenced by BV reduction.","Hoshino, Taro; Ookawara, Susumu; Goto, Sawako; Miyazawa, Haruhisa; Ito, Kiyonori; Ueda, Yuichiro; Kaku, Yoshio; Hirai, Keiji; Nabata, Aoi; Mori, Honami; Yoshida, Izumi; Tabei, Kaoru",Nephron.

Four complete genomes of the three novel CoVs were sequenced. Their genomes (26,396 to 26,552 bases) represent the smallest known CoV genomes. In phylogenetic trees constructed using chymotrypsin-like protease (3CL(pro)), RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (Pol), helicase, spike, and nucleocapsid proteins, BuCoV HKU11, ThCoV HKU12, and MuCoV HKU13 formed a cluster distantly related to infectious bronchitis virus and turkey CoV (group 3a CoVs). For helicase, spike, and nucleocapsid, they were also clustered with a CoV recently discovered in Asian leopard cats, for which the complete genome sequence was not available. The 3CL(pro), Pol, helicase, and nucleocapsid of the three CoVs possessed higher amino acid identities to those of group 3a CoVs than to those of group 1 and group 2 CoVs. Unique genomic features distinguishing them from other group 3 CoVs include a distinct transcription regulatory sequence and coding potential for small open reading frames. Based on these results, we propose a novel CoV subgroup, group 3c, to describe this distinct subgroup of CoVs under the group 3 CoVs. Avian CoVs are genetically more diverse than previously thought and may be closely related to some newly identified mammalian CoVs. Further studies would be important to delineate whether the Asian leopard cat CoV was a result of interspecies jumping from birds, a situation analogous to that of bat and civet severe acute respiratory syndrome CoVs.","Woo, Patrick C Y; Lau, Susanna K P; Lam, Carol S F; Lai, Kenneth K Y; Huang, Yi; Lee, Paul; Luk, Geraldine S M; Dyrting, Kitman C; Chan, Kwok-Hung; Yuen, Kwok-Yung",Journal of virology,267,1
89243,89243,89243,Frailty in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation: a protocol for a systematic review.,19.33543,8.407115,2019,"BACKGROUND Many research has indicated that, during the COVID-19 pandemic, health care workers are under greatly increased pressure and at increased risk for the development of mental health problems. Furthermore, previous research has indicated that psychiatrists are exposed to a number of unique stressors that may increase their risk for poor mental health. The aims of the present study were to assess the level of COVID-19 related concerns, psychological distress and life satisfaction among psychiatrists and other physicians during the first period of the pandemic and to examine whether individual differences in COVID-19 concerns, psychological flexibility, psychological resilience and coping behaviors account for differences in mental health indicators. SUBJECTS AND METHODS The sample consisted of N=725 physicians, among whom 22.8% were psychiatrists. This study was conducted online during the first lockdown in Croatia and collected data regarding COVID-19 related concerns, coping behaviors and mental health indicators (Psychological Distress and Life Satisfaction). RESULTS Physicians of other specialties had higher scores on a measure of COVID-19 anxiety than psychiatrists (p=0.012). In addition, a number of differences in coping behaviors are evident. Specifically, psychiatrists were less likely than physicians of other specializations to believe that being informed about COVID-19 is an effective coping strategy (p=0.013), but more prone to using sedatives and drugs as a coping strategy (p=0.002; p=0.037). CONCLUSIONS Psychiatrists are at special risk for substance abuse. Younger age, psychological inflexibility, low resilience and greater COVID-19 concerns might act as specific risk factors for distress. Our findings highlight the need for promoting a healthy lifestyle and psychological flexibility as universal protective factors.","Jokić-Begić, Nataša; Lauri Korajlija, Anita; Begić, Dražen",Psychiatria Danubina,267,9

These molecules function as both gastrointestinal toxins and superantigens (SAgs) which can simultaneously bind MHC-II and T cell receptor leading to a non-specific polyclonal T cell activation and massive proinflammatory cytokine release. Common symptoms include vomiting and diarrhea; however, in more severe cases, systemic dissemination may result in toxic shock syndrome and can be lethal in a few hours. Only small amounts of these heat-stable toxins are needed to cause the disease. Therefore, it is highly important to detect quickly low concentrations of SAgs in biological samples. In this work, we report a surface plasmon resonance (SPR)-based capture immunoassay for the detection of the SAg SEG. We analyzed the use of different amplification strategies. The SPR-based double-antibody sandwich approach could detect picomolar levels of SEG. The use of antibody-coated silica nanoparticles (AbSiNPs) as an alternative enhancing reagent also detected SEG in the picomolar range. Although AbSiNPs did not improve the limit of detection, for the same amount of SAg tested, AbSiNPs gave a higher response level than free antibodies. This work highlights the suitability of silica nanoparticles for signal amplification in SPR-based biosensors. Overall, SPR biosensors offer the capability for continuous real-time monitoring and high sensitivity that can be befitting for the detection of enterotoxins in food industries, laboratories and regulatory agencies.","Belen, Sarratea Maria; Sofía, Noli Truant; Romina, Mitarotonda; Belén, Antonoglou María; Santiago, Chiappini; María Julieta, Fernández Lynch; Pablo, Romasanta; Cristina, Vescina; Martín, Desimone; Mauricio, De Marzi; Emilio, Malchiodi; Marisa, Fernández",Biochemical and biophysical research communications,267,5

In humans, a Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) between theSARS CoV-2 Receptor-Binding Domain (RBD) and the extracellular peptidase domain ofACE2, on the surface of cells in the lower respiratory tract, is an initial step in the entrypathway. Inhibition of the SARS CoV-2 RBD / ACE2 PPI is currently being evaluated asa target for therapeutic and/or prophylactic intervention. However, relatively little is knownabout the molecular underpinnings of this complex. Employing multiple computationalplatforms, we predicted 'hot-spot' residues in a positive control PPI (PMI / MDM2) and theCoV-2 RBD/ACE2 complex. Computational alanine scanning mutagenesis wasperformed to predict changes in Gibbs' free energy that are associated with mutatingresidues at the positive control (PMI/MDM2) or SARS RBD/ACE2 binding interface toalanine. Additionally, we used the Adaptive Poisson-Boltzmann Solver to calculatemacromolecular electrostatic surfaces at the interface of the positive control PPI andSARS CoV-2 / ACE2 PPI. Finally, a comparative analysis of hot-spot residues for SARSCoVand SARS-CoV-2, in complex with ACE2, is provided. Collectively, this studyilluminates predicted hot-spot residues, and clusters, at the SARS CoV-2 RBD / ACE2binding interface, potentially guiding the development of reagents capable of disruptingthis complex and halting COVID-19.","McNaughton, Brian; Rosario, Pedro A",Chembiochem : a European journal of chemical biology,267,1

This study was performed to investigate the epidemiology of gastrointestinal cancer in Markazi Province. METHODS This is an epidemiological study in which data was gathered from the population-based cancer registry program in the Markazi province of Iran during the years 2010-2014. Data were recorded in Excel software and coded based on ICD-O. All cases out of Markazi provinces were excluded from study, and cases with code C-15-C20 were included in this study. Stata 11 was used to analyze the data. RESULTS In this study, 2975 new cases of gastrointestinal cancer in Markazi province were included in the analysis. The highest number of cancers was stomach (with 1595 cases), followed by colorectal cancer (980 cases), esophageal cancer (318 cases), and finally small bowl cancer (82 cases). The mean age of gastro-intestinal cancer diagnosis was 65.07 years. The results showed that with increasing age, the incidence of gastro-intestinal cancers increased, and in all sites and both sexes, the highest incidence of gastro-intestinal cancer was in the age group above 70 years. In both sexes, the age specific rate of stomach cancer was higher than other sites (with highest incidence in 2013) followed by colorectal cancer, esophageal cancer, and small bowl cancer. CONCLUSIONS The results showed similar incidence rate of gastrointestinal cancer in Markazi province to other provinces in Iran. This study found that stomach cancer is the most common cancer in the Markazi province; therefore, identifying effective and preventing factors is necessary.","Taheri, Majid; Nazari, Javad; Anoshirvani, Ali Arash; Aghabozorgi, Reza; Tabaeian, Seidamir Pasha; Bahrami, Masoud; Almasi-Hashiani, Amir",Journal of gastrointestinal cancer,267,27

The reduction of risk arising from the spread of pathogenic microorganisms in the hospital environment is a considerable challenge in the context of the proper functioning of the medical services sector. The financial costs of hospitals resulting from HAI are a serious problem for the Polish healthcare system. The spread of strains with a high level of drug resistance in individual hospitals is associated with the local epidemiological situation. In 2015-2017, there was a high increase in the number of infections caused by New Delhi strains. The highest increase due to this strain occurred in Mazowieckie and Podlasie provinces. The dynamics of infection caused by New Delhi strains throughout Poland in 2015-2016 indicated an increase of 278.7%. In 2017, the phenomenon of antibiotic abuse in all regions of Poland was 24% higher than the EU average. One of the reasons is the insufficient number of diagnostic tests ordered by both general practitioners and doctors representing hospital care. In 2016-2017, the average number of microbiological tests in diagnosing hospital infections performed annually within the entire territory of Poland was 50% lower than in European Union countries and the number recommended by WHO. Increased, and at the same time inappropriate antibiotic therapy led to a build-upof drug resistance among bacterial species of significant clinical importance. The current epidemiological situation imposes the necessity for constant HAI control and broadly understood rationalization of the guidelines of hospital antibiotic policy.","Lemiech-Mirowska, Ewelina; Kiersnowska, Zofia Maria; Michałkiewicz, Michał; Depta, Adam; Marczak, Michał",Annals of agricultural and environmental medicine : AAEM,267,1

PEDV replication is completed and results in a large amount of RNA in the cytoplasm. Stress granules (SGs) are dynamic cytosolic RNA granules formed under various stress conditions including viral infections. Several previous studies suggested that SGs were involved in the antiviral activity of host cells to limit viral propagation. However, the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. This study aimed to delineate the molecular mechanisms regulating the SG response to PEDV infection. SG formation is induced early during PEDV infection, but as infection proceeds, this ability is lost and SGs disappear at late stages of infection (>18 hours post-infection). PEDV infection resulted in the cleavage of Ras-GTPase-activating protein-binding protein 1 (G3BP1) mediated by caspase-8. Using mutational analysis, the PEDV-induced cleavage site within G3BP1 was identified, which differed from the 3C protease cleavage site previously identified. Furthermore, G3BP1 cleavage by caspase-8 at D168 and D169 was confirmed in vitro as well as in vivo The overexpression of cleavage-resistant G3BP1 conferred persistent SG formation and suppression of viral replication. Additionally, the knockdown of endogenous G3BP1 abolished SG formation and potentiated viral replication. Taken together, these data provide new insights into novel strategies in which PEDV limits the host stress response and antiviral responses, and indicate that caspase-8-mediated G3BP1 cleavage is important in the failure of host defense against PEDV infection.Importance: Coronaviruses (CoVs) are drawing extensive attention again since the outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in 2019. CoVs are prone to variation and own the transmission capability by crossing the species barrier resulting in reemergence. How CoVs manipulate the antiviral responses of their hosts needs to be explored. Overall, the study provides new insight into how Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus (PEDV) impaired SG assembly by targeting G3BP1 via the host proteinase caspase-8. These findings enhanced the understanding of PEDV infection and might help identify new antiviral targets that could inhibit viral replication and limit the pathogenesis of PEDV.","Sun, Liumei; Chen, Huan; Ming, Xin; Bo, Zongyi; Shin, Hyun-Jin; Jung, Yong-Sam; Qian, Yingjuan",Journal of virology,267,28

Although kidney is a crucial target of Ni toxicity, information on autophagy and the potential mechanisms of Ni-induced renal toxicity are still poorly described. As we discovered, NiCl2 could induce renal damage including decrease in renal weight, renal histological alterations, and renal function injury. According to the obtained results, NiCl2 could obviously increase autophagy, which was characterized by increase of LC3 expression and decrease of p62 expression. Meanwhile, the result of ultrastructure observation showed increased autolysosomes numbers in the kidney of NiCl2-treated mice. In addition, NiCl2 increased mRNA and protein levels of autophagy flux proteins including Beclin1, Atg5, Atg12, Atg16L1, Atg7, and Atg3. Furthermore, NiCl2 induced autophagy through AMPK and PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathways which featured down-regulated expression levels of p-PI3K, p-AKT and p-mTOR and up-regulated expression levels of p-AMPK and p-ULK1. In summary, the above results indicate involvement of autophagy in renal injury induced by NiCl2, and NiCl2 induced autophagy via PI3K/AKT/mTOR and AMPK pathways in mouse kidney.","Yin, Heng; Zuo, Zhicai; Yang, Zhuangzhi; Guo, Hongrui; Fang, Jing; Cui, Hengmin; Ouyang, Ping; Chen, Xia; Chen, Jian; Geng, Yi; Chen, Zhengli; Huang, Chao; Zhu, Yanqiu",Ecotoxicology and environmental safety,267,17

Patients with diabetes without symptoms of neuropathy already showed loss of nerve function for heat (standardized mean difference (SMD): 0.52, p<0.001), cold (SMD: -0.71, p=0.01) and electrical pain thresholds (SMD: 1.26, p=0.01). Patients with non-painful neuropathy had greater loss of function in heat pain threshold (SMD: 0.75, p=0.01) and electrical stimuli (SMD: 0.55, p=0.03) compared with patients with diabetes without neuropathy. Patients with painful diabetic neuropathy exhibited a greater loss of function in heat pain threshold (SMD: 0.55, p=0.005) compared with patients with non-painful diabetic neuropathy. Small-diameter nerve fiber function deteriorates progressively in patients with diabetes. Because the dysfunction is already present before symptoms occur, early detection is possible, which may assist in prevention and effective management of diabetic neuropathy.","Sierra-Silvestre, Eva; Somerville, Mari; Bisset, Leanne; Coppieters, Michel W",BMJ open diabetes research & care,267,20

This report describes the preliminary findings of cardiac manifestations seen in patients managed in three centres in Lagos, Nigeria. METHODS Ten patients, part of an ongoing study of patients admitted in three centres in Lagos, Nigeria, with COVID-19 diagnosed with reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or serology were retrospectively studied for cardiac manifestations. RESULTS The mean (SD) age was 52.5 ± 18.79 years (with a minimum of 17 years and maximum of 79 years). Six patients were female and four were male. Hypertension was seen in 70%, diabetes in 50% and obesity in 60% of patients. All had elevated inflammatory markers. Only four patients had bilateral pneumonia. The rest had only cardiac manifestations. Six patients presented with de novo heart failure and one had decompensated heart failure. A set of three patients had individually fulminant myocarditis, probable pulmonary embolism and stress cardiomyopathy, respectively. CONCLUSIONS This study shows that co-morbidities are common in patients with COVID-19 and cardiac complications.

These newer sutures were preceded by several iterations of nonabsorbable counterparts, all of which were eventually removed from the market because of complications. OBJECTIVE This review will provide a history of suture lift experience, review the published evidence on the safety and efficacy of currently available absorbable suture lift materials, and detail the clinical experience of the authors using these products. MATERIALS AND METHODS A review of relevant clinical terms was performed on PUBMED and MEDLINE databases. All articles were reviewed, and further studies examined from citations of selected articles. Articles that focused on suture lifting using extensive dissection were excluded. RESULTS Twelve studies detailed the results of absorbable suture lifting largely through patient satisfaction surveys or retrospective chart review of cases. No randomized controlled studies were available. CONCLUSION Data on suture lifting are limited, with largely descriptive and retrospective case reports available in the literature entailed Oxford Centre evidence-based medicine Levels 2a to 5. Based on the available data, suture lifting appears to be safe and well tolerated, with patient satisfaction similar to or above that reported for other noninvasive lifting and tightening procedures. However, due to the lack of randomized controlled trials, the authors give the suture lifting Strength of Recommendation Level C.

Many stakeholders affect the opioid epidemic, including government entities, healthcare providers and policymakers, and opioid users. Simulation and conceptual modeling can help us understand the dynamics of the opioid epidemic by simplifying the real world and informing policymakers about different health interventions that could reduce the deaths caused by opioid overdose in the United States every year. Objectives To conduct a scoping review of simulation and conceptual models that propose policies capable of controlling the opioid epidemic. We demonstrate the strengths and limitations of these models and provide a framework for further improvement of future decision support tools. Methods Using the methodology of a scoping review, we identified articles published after 2000 from eight electronic databases to map the literature that uses simulation and conceptual modeling in developing public health policies to address the opioid epidemic. Results We reviewed 472 papers of which 14 were appropriate for inclusion. Each used either system dynamics simulation modeling, mathematical modeling, conceptual modeling, or agent-based modeling. All included studies tested and proposed strategies to improve health outcomes related to the opioid epidemic. Factors considered in the models included physicians prescribing opioids, trafficking, users recruiting new users, and doctor shopping; no model investigated the impact of age and spatial factors on the dynamics of the epidemic. Key findings from these studies were (1) prevention of opioid initiation is better than treatment of opioid addiction, (2) the analysis of an intervention's impact should include both benefits and harms, and (3) interventions with short-term benefits might have a counterproductive impact on the epidemic in long run. Conclusions While most studies examined the role of prescription opioids and trafficking on this epidemic, the transition of patients from prescription opioid use to nonprescription use including heroin and synthetic opioids such as fentanyl impacts the system significantly and results in an epidemic with quite different characteristics than what it had a decade ago. We recommend including the impact of age and geographic location on the opioid epidemic using modeling methods.","Sharareh, Nasser; Sabounchi, Shabnam S; McFarland, Mary; Hess, Rachel",Substance abuse : research and treatment,267,24

Soil health is connected with human health, yet, knowledge of the underlying soil functioning remains incomplete. This review highlights selected services, i.e. (i) soil as a genetic resource and hotspot of biodiversity, forming the basis for providing (ii) biochemical resources and (iii) medicinal services and goods. Soils harbour an unrivalled biodiversity of organisms, especially microorganisms. Some of the abilities of autochthonous microorganisms and their relevant enzymes serve (i) to improve natural soil functions and in particular plant growth, e.g. through beneficial plant growth-promoting, symbiotic and mycorrhizal microorganisms, (ii) to act as biopesticides, (iii) to facilitate biodegradation of pollutants for soil bioremediation and (iv) to yield enzymes or chemicals for industrial use. Soils also exert direct effects on human health. Contact with soil enriches the human microbiome, affords protection against allergies and promotes emotional well-being. Medicinally relevant are soil substrates such as loams, clays and various minerals with curative effects as well as pharmaceutically active organic chemicals like antibiotics that are formed by soil microorganisms.

Currently, the literature lacks long-term outcomes in LSG and leak rates after reinforcement of the staple line. The aims are two-fold: to present leak rates from using staple line reinforcement and six year outcomes of LSG in relation to resolution of obesity-related comorbidities and long-term weight loss. MATERIALS AND METHODS This is a single-institution, retrospectively reviewed study of 204 patient case files. Data from all patients undergoing LSG between December 2007 and May 2013 was collected. RESULTS The total complication rate was 6.9% (14/204), with no recorded staple line leaks. The mean postoperative Body Mass Index (BMI) at 1 year, 2 years, 3 years, 4 years, 5 years, and 6 years was 39.3 ± 8, 38.7 ± 8, 40.4 ± 9, 40.5 ± 10, 43.0 ± 10, and 42.4 ± 7, respectively.

An ageing population poses a great challenge to our healthcare system that requires new tool to tackle the complexity of health services as well as the increasing expenses. Mobile health applications (mHealth app) is seen to have the potential to address these challenges, alleviating burdens on the healthcare system and enhance the quality of life for older adults. Despite the numerous benefits of mHealth apps, relatively little is known about whether older adults perceive that these apps confer such benefits. Their perspectives towards the use of mobile applications for health-related purposes have also been little studied. Therefore, in this paper, we outline our scoping review protocol to systematically review literature specific to older adults' willingness, perceived barriers and motivators towards the use of mobile applications to monitor and manage their health. METHODS AND ANALYSIS Arksey and O'Malley's scoping review methodology framework will guide the conduct of this scoping review. The search strategy will involve electronic databases including PubMed, Excerpta Medica Database, Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Cochrane Library, Google Scholar and ScienceDirect, in addition to grey literature sources and hand-searching of reference lists. Two reviewers will independently screen all abstracts and full-text studies for inclusion. Data will be charted and sorted through an iterative process by the research team. The extracted data will undergo a descriptive analysis and simple quantitative analysis will be conducted using descriptive statistics. Engagement with relevant stakeholders will be carried out to gain more insights into our data from different perspectives. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION Since the data used are from publicly available sources, this study does not require ethical approval. Results will be disseminated through academic journals, conferences and seminars. We anticipate that our findings will aid technology developers and health professionals working in the area of ageing and rehabilitation.","Ahmad, Nurul Asilah; Mat Ludin, Arimi Fitri; Shahar, Suzana; Mohd Noah, Shahrul Azman; Mohd Tohit, Noorlaili",BMJ open,267,19

Therefore, predicting post-CABG AF development is important for treatment management. In this study, we investigated the value of the ratio E/(Ea × Sa) as a combined systolic-diastolic index in predicting post-CABG AF development. METHODS This prospective study included 102 patients who underwent only isolated coronary bypass. Preoperative demographic features, biochemical, and hematological parameters, and the electrocardiographic data of all patients were recorded. The E/(Ea × Sa) indices were calculated from the echocardiographic measurements. Those who retained their postoperative sinus rhythm were defined as group 1, and those who developed AF were defined as group 2. RESULTS Group 2 had significantly higher lateral (group 1:1.14 ± 0.61 vs. group 2:1.47 ± 0.87; P = .02), medial (group 1:1.61 ± 0.70 vs. group 2:1.99 ± 0.91; P = .02), and mean (group 1:1.30 ± 0.58 vs. group 2:1.62 ± 0.74; P = .001) E/(Ea × Sa) indices than group 1. In the univariate analysis, age, CHA2 DS2 -VASc score, sPAP, IABP use, and mean E/(EaxSa) index were found to be significant predictors of post-CABG AF development. However, only the mean E/(EaxSa) index was found to be a significant predictor of post-CABG AF development in the multivariate analysis (OR: 2.19 95% CI 1.01-5.96; P = .045). CONCLUSIONS The combined systolic-diastolic index predicted the development of post-CABG AF.","Camci, Sencer; Ari, Selma; Karakus, Alper; Ari, Hasan; Taner, Temmuz",Echocardiography,267,1

Some studies have reported the efficacy of ultrasound-guided retrolaminar block (RLB) for the postoperative management of pain after chest wall surgery. The purpose of this study was to compare the postoperative analgesic efficacy and adverse effects of ultrasound-guided RLB with those of TEA in patients undergoing minor VATS procedures. Methods A total of 192 relevant records of patients were enrolled in this study. We reviewed electronic medical records of patients undergoing minor VATS procedures under general anesthesia. The primary outcome was the median differences in the numerical rating scale (NRS) scores during rest between the groups at the morning of postoperative day 1 (POD 1m). A propensity-matched analysis incorporating preoperative variables was used to compare the efficacy of postoperative analgesia in two groups. Results Overall, 94 patients were identified for analysis. Propensity score matching resulted in 47 patients in each group. There were no significant differences in the NRS scores between the two groups. The median differences in NRS scores during rest between the two groups at POD 1m were under 1, which indicates non-inferiority of RLB. There were no significant differences in the incidence of adverse effects and rescue dose of analgesic consumption between the two groups. Conclusions The analgesic effects of continuous ultrasound-guided RLB were non inferior to those of TEA for minor VATS procedures.","Nobukuni, Keiko; Hatta, Mariko; Nakagaki, Toshiaki; Yoshino, Jun; Obuchi, Toshiro; Fujimura, Naoyuki",Journal of thoracic disease,267,28

We present here a complete generative model that describes how confidence judgments result from some confidence evidence. The model that generates confidence evidence has two main parameters, confidence noise and confidence boost. Confidence noise reduces the sensitivity to the confidence evidence, and confidence boost accounts for information used for confidence judgment which was not used for the perceptual decision. The opposite effect of these two parameters creates a problem of confidence parameters indeterminacy, where the confidence in a perceptual decision is the same in spite of differences in confidence noise and confidence boost. When confidence is estimated for multiple stimulus strengths, both of these parameters can be recovered, thus allowing us to estimate whether confidence is generated using the same primary information that was used for the perceptual decision or some secondary information. We also describe a novel measure of confidence efficiency relative to the ideal confidence observer, as well as the estimate of one type of confidence bias. Finally, we apply the model to the confidence forced-choice paradigm, a paradigm that provides objective estimates of confidence, and we discuss how each parameter of the model can be recovered using this paradigm.

MATERIALS AND METHODS We evaluated 34 patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest without witnesses brought to our emergency department. Abdominal and cerebral saturations were measured using near-infrared spectrophotometry from the start of CPR. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation was performed for a maximum of 30 minutes. The effect of abdominal saturations in patients with or without spontaneous circulation restored through CPR was then assessed. RESULTS Thirty-four patients (17 males + females) with a mean age of 63.06 ± 11.66 years were included in the study. A significant correlation was determined between increase in abdominal saturations measured at the start and end of CPR and the return of spontaneous circulation (P < .001). A good positive correlation was also identified between abdominal saturation and return of spontaneous circulation. CONCLUSION Patients with increased abdominal and cerebral saturation values have a higher survival rate after appropriate CPR. This noninvasive measurement system and monitoring of patients during CPR may be a good method of predicting return of spontaneous circulation and assessing abdominal perfusion.,"Kalkan, Asim; Bilir, Ozlem; Ersunan, Gokhan; Ozel, Deniz; Tas, Mahmut; Memetoglu, Mehmet Erdem",The American journal of emergency medicine,267,17

Deficiencies of the TLR3 pathway impair cell-intrinsic immunity to vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and HSV-1 in fibroblasts, and to HSV-1 in cortical but not trigeminal neurons. The underlying molecular mechanism is thought to involve impaired IFN-α/β induction by the TLR3 recognition of dsRNA viral intermediates or by-products. However, we show here that human TLR3 controls constitutive levels of IFNB mRNA and secreted bioactive IFN-β protein, and thereby also controls constitutive mRNA levels for IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) in fibroblasts. Tlr3-/- mouse embryonic fibroblasts also have lower basal ISG levels. Moreover, human TLR3 controls basal levels of IFN-β secretion and ISG mRNA in induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cortical neurons. Consistently, TLR3-deficient human fibroblasts and cortical neurons are vulnerable not only to both VSV and HSV-1, but also to several other families of viruses. The mechanism by which TLR3 restricts viral growth in human fibroblasts and cortical neurons in vitro and, by inference, by which the human CNS prevents infection by HSV-1 in vivo, is therefore based on the control of early viral infection by basal IFN-β immunity.","Gao, Daxing; Ciancanelli, Michael J; Zhang, Peng; Harschnitz, Oliver; Bondet, Vincent; Hasek, Mary; Chen, Jie; Mu, Xin; Itan, Yuval; Cobat, Aurélie; Sancho-Shimizu, Vanessa; Bigio, Benedetta; Lorenzo, Lazaro; Ciceri, Gabriele; McAlpine, Jessica; Anguiano, Esperanza; Jouanguy, Emmanuelle; Chaussabel, Damien; Meyts, Isabelle; Diamond, Michael S; Abel, Laurent; Hur, Sun; Smith, Gregory A; Notarangelo, Luigi; Duffy, Darragh; Studer, Lorenz; Casanova, Jean-Laurent; Zhang, Shen-Ying",The Journal of clinical investigation,267,11

Among them, the accuracy achieved with modified Gaussian models that describe the deviation of an ideal Gaussian peak as a change in the peak variance or standard deviation over time, has been highlighted. These models are, in fact, a family of functions of different complexity with great flexibility to adjust chromatographic peaks over a wide range of asymmetries and shapes. However, an uncontrolled behaviour of the signal may occur outside the region being fitted, forcing the use of different strategies to overcome this problem. In this work, the performance of the LMG (Linear Modified Gaussian), PVMG (Parabolic Variance Modified Gaussian), and PLMG (Parabolic-Lorentzian Modified Gaussian) models is compared with variants obtained by combination of the modified Gaussian models with an equation that adds an exponential tail and with other functions that limit the growth of the independent variable. The behaviour of the approaches is checked through the simultaneous fitting of enantiomeric peaks showing a wide range of characteristics, obtained in the separation of drugs with chiral activity by liquid chromatography using enantioselective columns. The study is also carried out with the purpose of performing the deconvolution of the peaks of the enantiomers, when these are not completely resolved, in order to evaluate the enantiomeric fraction.","Pérez-Baeza, M; Escuder-Gilabert, L; Medina-Hernández, M J; Baeza-Baeza, J J; García-Alvarez-Coque, M C",Journal of chromatography.

The need for surgical skills and the long operative times have led to concern about its reproducibility. OBJECTIVE To illustrate our technique for RARC and totally intracorporeal orthotopic Padua ileal bladder. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS From August 2012 to February 2014, 45 patients underwent this technique at a single tertiary referral centre. SURGICAL PROCEDURE RARC, extended pelvic lymph node dissection, and intracorporeal partly stapled neobladder. Surgical steps are demonstrated in the accompanying video. MEASUREMENTS Demographics, clinical, and pathological data were collected. Perioperative, 2-yr oncologic and 2-yr functional outcomes were reported. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS Intraoperative transfusion or conversion to open surgery was not necessary in any case and intracorporeal neobladder was successfully performed in all 45 patients. Median operative time was 305min (interquartile range [IQR]: 282-345). Median estimated blood loss was 210ml (IQR: 50-250). Median hospital stay was 9 d (IQR: 7-12). The overall incidence of perioperative, 30-d and 180-d complications were 44.4%, 57.8%, and 77.8%, respectively, while severe complications occurred in17.8%, 17.8%, and 35.5%, respectively. Two-yr daytime and night-time continence rates were 73.3% and 55.5%, respectively. Two-yr disease free survival, cancer specific survival, and overall survival rates were 72.5%, 82.3%, and 82.4%, respectively. The small sample size and high caseload of the centre might affect the reproducibility of these results. CONCLUSIONS Our experience supports the feasibility of totally intracorporeal neobladder following RARC. Operative times and perioperative complication rates are likely to be reduced with increasing experience. PATIENT SUMMARY We report the outcomes of our first 45 consecutive patients who underwent robot-assisted radical cystectomy with intracorporeal neobladders. Perioperative, oncologic, and functional outcomes support this technique as a feasible and safe surgical option in tertiary referral centres.","Simone, Giuseppe; Papalia, Rocco; Misuraca, Leonardo; Tuderti, Gabriele; Minisola, Francesco; Ferriero, Mariaconsiglia; Vallati, Giulio; Guaglianone, Salvatore; Gallucci, Michele",European urology,267,1

The ongoing outbreak in Wuhan City spread rapidly throughout China, where the fatality rate ranged from 2.1 to 4.9%. Due to its high transmissibility, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a public health emergency of international concern on 30 January 2020. The current outbreak has the potential to become the first pandemic of the new millennium. Most patients who were first diagnosed with COVID-19 worked at or lived in the vicinity of the local Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, where live animals were also on sale. The concerted efforts of Chinese scientists led to the independent isolation from patients and identification of a novel coronavirus, SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), on 6 January 2020; this has been an important step in the development of treatment. The purpose of this article is to overview the history, epidemiology, clinical characteristics, diagnosis, and treatment of COVID 2019 reported in recently published studies.

He had no bleeding manifestations and had a good response to prednisone treatment.We review the characteristics of the cases reported to date in the literature, with an analysis of 57 patients. Mean age was 56 years (±19.6 SD), and 50.9% were male. This was the first episode of ITP in most of the patients (86.05%), with SARS-CoV-2 acting as the initial trigger. We found that ITP flares may appear in both mild and severe COVID-19 cases. They also appeared at any time during the course of the disease, 48.2% of patients developed it during hospitalization, while it was diagnosed at admission in the rest of the cases. Platelet counts were significantly lower than other ITP series, with a median nadir platelet count of 8 × 109/L (IQR 2-17.75 × 109/L). These patients show a higher bleeding rate (61.4%) compared with other ITP series. They also show a better response to treatment, with good response to the first line therapies in 76.9% of them. The most common first-line treatment was intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), used alone or combined with corticosteroids in 40.4% and 32.7% of cases respectively, while 25% of patients received only corticosteroids.Our review suggests that COVID-19-related ITP can be seen even in previously healthy patients. Clinicians must be aware that ITP may appear both in mild and severe COVID-19, at any time during its course. Given that this kind of ITP seems to be associated with a higher bleeding risk, its diagnosis in a clinical scenario such as COVID-19, where anticoagulant therapy is frequently used, may be critical. Treatment with IVIG and/or corticoids is often effective.","Alonso-Beato, Rubén; Morales-Ortega, Alejandro; Fernández, Francisco Javier De la Hera; Morón, Ana Isabel Parejo; Ríos-Fernández, Raquel; Rubio, José Luis Callejas; Centeno, Norberto Ortego",Lupus,267,28

This qualitative study in a large urban institution aimed to: 1) characterize the clinical specialties that predominantly treat STIs, 2) identify perceived barriers to EPT, and 3) describe strategies to advance routine EPT use. METHODS Providers in Obstetrics/Gynecology (OB/GYN), Infectious Disease (ID) and Emergency Medicine (EM) were interviewed using a structured discussion guide. Transcripts were double-coded and iteratively analyzed using qualitative content analysis. Barriers and strategies were summarized and supported with quotes from providers (n=23). RESULTS Perceived EPT barriers overlapped across OB/GYN, ID and EM, yet the settings were diverse in their patient populations, resources and concerns. OB/GYNs were the only providers practicing EPT, yet there was a lack of standardization. ID providers noted that an EPT prescription from an ID provider could inadvertently disclose HIV status of a patient to a sexual partner, posing an ethical dilemma. EM providers exhibited readiness for EPT, although routine empiric treatment of index patients in EM (est. at 90%) gave some providers pause in prescribing for partners: ""I don't know what I'm treating."" Point-of-care testing could increase providers' confidence in prescribing EPT, yet some worried it could contribute to overutilization of the ER as an STI clinic. All settings prioritized setting-specific training and protocols. CONCLUSIONS OB/GYN, ID and EM providers report unique hurdles, specific to their settings and patient populations; tailored EPT implementation strategies, particularly provider training, are urgently needed to improve patient/partner outcomes.","McCool-Myers, Megan; Wickham, Peggy G; Henn, Megan C; Sheth, Anandi N; Kottke, Melissa J",Sexually transmitted diseases,267,1

Interaction of the viral envelope glycoprotein (Env) with a specific cellular receptor is the first and crucial step in determining host specificity. Using a well-established retroviral model-avian Rous sarcoma virus (RSV)-we analyzed changes in an RSV variant that had repeatedly been able to infect rodents. By envelope gene (env) sequencing, we identified eight mutations that do not match the already described mutations influencing the host range. Two of these mutations-one at the beginning (D32G) of the surface Env subunit (SU) and the other at the end of the fusion peptide region (L378S)-were found to be of critical importance, ensuring transmission to rodent, human, and chicken cells lacking the appropriate receptor. Furthermore, we carried out assays to examine the virus entry mechanism and concluded that these two mutations cause conformational changes in the Env variant and that these changes lead to an activated, or primed, state of Env (normally induced after Env interaction with the receptor). In summary, our results indicate that retroviral host range extension is caused by spontaneous Env activation, which circumvents the need for original cell receptor. This activation is, in turn, caused by mutations in various env regions.","Lounková, Anna; Kosla, Jan; Přikryl, David; Štafl, Kryštof; Kučerová, Dana; Svoboda, Jan",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,267,12

Currently, there is an abundance of upper limb assessments used to quantify recovery. How well various assessments can describe upper limb function change over 1 year remains uncertain. A uniform and feasible standard would be beneficial to increase future studies' comparability on stroke recovery. This review describes which assessments are common in large-scale, longitudinal stroke trials and how these quantify the change in upper limb function from stroke onset up to 1 year. A systematic search for well-powered stroke studies identified upper limb assessments classifying motor recovery during the initial year after a stroke. A metaregression investigated the association between assessments and motor recovery within 1 year after stroke. Scores from nine common assessments and 4,433 patients were combined and transformed into a standardized recovery score. A mixed-effects model on recovery scores over time confirmed significant differences between assessments (P < 0.001), with improvement following the weeks after stroke present when measuring recovery using the Action Research Arm Test (β = 0.013), Box and Block test (β = 0.011), Fugl-Meyer Assessment (β = 0.007), or grip force test (β = 0.023). A last-observation-carried-forward analysis also highlighted the peg test (β = 0.017) and Rivermead Assessment (β = 0.011) as additional, valuable long-term outcome measures. Recovery patterns and, thus, trial outcomes are dependent on the assessment implemented. Future research should include multiple common assessments and continue data collection for a full year after stroke to facilitate the consensus process on assessments measuring upper limb recovery.","Wolf, Silke; Gerloff, Christian; Backhaus, Winifried",Frontiers in neurology,267,1

STUDY DESIGN Randomized, prospective clinical trial. ANIMALS Healthy, sexually intact female cats (n = 60). METHODS Cats were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 groups: Midline (n = 20), Flank (20), and Lap (20) were evaluated 1, 2, 4, 6, and 12 hours after endotracheal extubation. Postoperative pain was scored using the 4A-vet pain scale that combines a subjective numerical pain rating and objective scoring of physiologic and behavioral variables including the response to stimulation of the surgical site. Pain scores (PS) were compared between groups. RESULTS There was a significant difference in the PS between groups. PS for Midline and Flank were not significantly different but were both significantly higher compared with Lap. Depending on time, 5-20% of the cats had intense postoperative pain in both Midline and Flank groups. None of the Lap cats had intense postoperative pain. CONCLUSIONS Laparoscopic ovariectomy, although slower, appeared less painful compared with conventional ventral midline and flank ovariectomy. Postoperative pain did not differ significantly between midline and flank groups.","Gauthier, Olivier; Holopherne-Doran, Delphine; Gendarme, Thalia; Chebroux, Alexandre; Thorin, Chantal; Tainturier, Daniel; Bencharif, Djemil",Veterinary surgery : VS,267,31

Secondly, investigate if increasing NaOCl concentration and/or contact-time improves the performance of these techniques. METHODOLOGY A total of 83 extracted human maxillary permanent canines were decoronated to 15 mm and root canals prepared to a size 40,.10 taper. Root dentine was stained with crystal violet for 72 h and embedded in silicone. Eighty specimens were randomly distributed into 16 groups (n = 5) according to the irrigant activation technique, NaOCl concentration (2%; 5.25%) and irrigant contact-time (10 min; 20 min). All activation techniques were used for 60 s in the last minute of irrigation. Additionally, 3 teeth were not exposed to NaOCl to confirm adequate dentine staining had occurred (i.e. negative control). All specimens were subsequently dissected, observed under a light microscope and NaOCl penetration depth (µm) determined by measuring the average width of bleached dentine using ImageJ software. Statistical comparisons were made with paired and unpaired t-tests, ANOVAs followed by post-hoc Tukey and Dunnett's tests, and a general linear model (α < 0.05). RESULTS Overall, NaOCl penetration ranged from 38.8 µm - 411.0 µm with MDA, PUI and SI consistently resulting in significantly greater tubular infiltration than CNI (P < 0.05). The deepest measurements in the coronal, middle and apical segments were all recorded in the MDA; 5.25%; 20 min group and the least in the CNI; 2%; 10 min group. Increasing either irrigant concentration or contact-time resulted in significantly greater NaOCl penetration depths for all techniques and segments of the canal (P < 0.05). However, when irrigant concentration and contact-time were increased together, a significant interaction effect between these two independent variables was observed on overall NaOCl penetration (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS Agitating irrigants with MDA, PUI or SI, as well as using greater irrigant concentrations or contact-times, potentiated NaOCl penetration into root dentine. However, longer durations of NaOCl exposure at lower concentrations resulted in similar depths of tubular penetration as those achieved at higher concentrations.","Virdee, S S; Farnell, Djj; Silva, M A; Camilleri, J; Cooper, P R; Tomson, P L",International endodontic journal,267,1

This study aims to investigate the effect of prolonged use of NO donor sodium nitroprusside (SNP) on IOP. Since SNP has a short biological half-life, a nanoparticle drug delivery system (mesoporous silica nanoparticles) has been used to deliver SNP to the target tissues (trabecular meshwork and Schlemm's canal). We find that the sustained use of NO donor initially reduced IOP followed, surprisingly, by IOP elevation, which could not recover by drug withdraw but could be reversed by the antioxidant MnTMPyP application. The IOP elevation and normalization coincide with increased and reduced protein nitration in the mouse conventional outflow tissue. These findings suggest that the prolonged use of NO donor SNP may be problematic as it can cause outflow tissue damage by protein nitration. MnTMPyP is protective of the nitrative damage which could be considered to be co-applied with NO donors.","Hu, Chunchun; Zhang, Yu; Song, Maomao; Deng, Yonghui; Sun, Xinghuai; Lei, Yuan",Experimental eye research,267,12

Jet ventilation delivers and maintains a sustained airway pressure at high frequency, chest wall and diaphragmatic movement is drastically reduced compared with traditional ventilation. The current study looks to examine the effectiveness of tissue sampling (diagnostic yield) while using jet ventilation on target-lesion movement when compared with traditional ventilation. METHODS A total of 36 patients received total intravenous anesthesia with both jet and traditional ventilation during ENB procedure where sensor to lesion displacement was recorded. When planning the ENB procedure, the presence or absence of a viable airway to the lesion was recorded. Sensor to lesion movement was recorded and compared for significance using χ and t tests, utilizing stringent P-values. RESULTS Overall patients with an airway to the lesion (n=23) had a higher proportion of successful diagnostic biopsies, 83% compared with those patients that lacked an airway to the lesion (n=13) 70% proportion of successful diagnostic biopsies. When using jet ventilation, the chance of nonzero displacement was 8.3% (0.14 mm), regardless of the presence of an airway. Compared with traditional ventilation, the chance of a nonzero displacement between the sensor and target-lesion was 83% (6.4 mm), independent of airway presence to the lesions. CONCLUSION In patients without an airway, jet ventilation significantly decreased target displacement when compared with traditional ventilation (2 vs. 17 mm). In patients with direct airway to the lesion, jet ventilation did not significantly decrease target displacement when compared with the traditional approach.","Webb, Tracey N; Bonta, Dacian V; Masters, Roger; Parks, Christopher; Bechara, Rabih",Journal of bronchology & interventional pulmonology,267,7

Here, we distinguished the potential protective effect of allicin against CP-mediated hepatotoxicity in rats. To assess the effect of allicin, four experimental groups were used, with 7 rats per group, including control, allicin (10 mg/kg), CP (200 mg/kg), and allicin + CP-treated groups. All groups were treated for 10 days. Blood and liver samples were collected for biochemical, molecular, and histological analyses. Treatment with CP led to deformations in the liver tissue that were associated with higher liver function markers (alanine transaminase, aspartate transaminase, and alkaline phosphatase). Additionally, a disturbance in the redox balance was observed after CP exposure, as indicated by increased levels of oxidants, including malondialdehyde and nitric oxide, and the decreased levels of endogenous antioxidants, including glutathione, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase, superoxide dismutase, and catalase. At the molecular level, CP treatment resulted in reduced expression of the Nrf2/ARE pathway and other genes related to this pathway, including NAD(P)H quinone dehydrogenase 1 and glutamate-cysteine ligase catalytic subunit. CP also led to a hyper-inflammatory response in hepatic tissue, with increased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interlukin-1beta, and upregulation of nitric oxide synthase 2. CP also enhanced the immunoreactivity of the profibrogenic cytokine, transforming growth factor-beta, in liver tissue. Upregulation of caspase 3 and Bcl-2-associated X protein and downregulation of B-cell lymphoma 2 were also observed in response to CP treatment. Treatment with allicin reversed the molecular, biochemical, and histological changes that occurred with CP exposure. These results suggest that allicin can be used in combination with CP to avoid hepatotoxicity.","Sun, Dongsheng; Sun, Chen; Qiu, Gongcai; Yao, Lei; Yu, Jian; Al Sberi, Hassan; Fouda, Manar S; Othman, Mohamed S; Lokman, Maha S; Kassab, Rami B; Abdel Moneim, Ahmed E",Environmental science and pollution research international,267,24

This coronavirus infects by first binding to the ectoenzyme Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2), a serine protease acting as the receptor, while another serine protease is necessary for priming the viral spike “S” protein required for entering the cells. Repurposing existing drugs for potential anti-coronavirus activity have failed. As a result, there were intense efforts to rapidly produce ways of providing prophylactic active immunization (vaccines) or abortive passive (convalescent plasma or monoclonal antibodies) neutralizing antibodies. The availability of vaccines for COVID-19 have been largely successful, but many questions still remain unanswered. In spite of the original enthusiasm, clinical studies using convalescent serum or monoclonal antibodies have shown limited benefit. Moreover, the emergence of Long-COVID syndrome in most infected patients necessitates the development of treatment approaches that may prevent viral entry by blocking both serine proteases involved, as with a liposomal blend of the natural flavonoids luteolin and quercetin.","Theoharides, T C; Lauritano, D; Ronconi, G; Calvisi, V; Conti, P",Journal of biological regulators and homeostatic agents,267,1

METHODS Our institution hosted 25 students for 4-week VSI rotations. We held two sessions, one in July 2020 and another in August 2020. The students participated in a curriculum centered around Zoom® and phone interactions with residents and faculty. The curriculum included selected readings, surgical videos, group didactics and 1-on-1 mentorship. Anonymous pre-rotation and post-rotation self-assessments were used to ascertain achievement of learning objectives and utility of educational tools implemented during the rotation. Faculty and resident mentors were also surveyed to assess their experience. RESULTS With the exception of knot tying techniques (p=0.67), students reported significant improvement in their understanding vascular surgery concepts after the virtual elective (p < 0.05). The highest ranked components of the course were interpersonal including interaction with faculty, mentorship, and learning the program culture. The lowest ranked components of the course were simulation training and research opportunities. Rating of utility for aspects of the course were consistent with ranking of components, with faculty interaction having the highest average rating. The ideal number of hours for daily virtual interaction reported by students ranged from 3 to 6 with a median of 4. Overall, the majority of mentors were satisfied with virtual course. However, they did report limited ability to assess student personality and fit for the program. The number of hours per week spent by mentors on the virtual vascular surgery rotation ranged from 2 to 7 with a median of 4. Fourteen out of seventeen mentors reported that having a virtual student was significant addition to their existing workload. CONCLUSIONS Overall, our student and mentor feedback were positive. Several challenges inherent to the virtual environment still need to be refined, however the goals of a VSI are distinct and should be explored by training programs. With changes to healthcare in the United States in the horizon and the arrival of SARS-CoV2 pandemic constraints, implementing a virtual away rotation may be an acceptable platform for adapting our recruitment strategies.","Patel, Shivik; Chawla, Amit; Unruh, Marie; Guidry, London; Brooke, Amadis; Lalani, Alykhan; Kim, Joyce; Risher, William; Zea, Nicholas; Torrance, Bruce; Palit, Tapash; Gwin, Taylor; Danos, Denise M; McArthur Sheahan, Claudie; Sheahan, Malachi Gerard",Journal of vascular surgery,267,1

Interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) gene polymorphisms have been associated with parvovirus B19, hepatitis C virus, HIV-1/AIDS infection, cytomegalovirus viremia, and disease. IFN-γ is known to have potent inhibitory effects on BK virus gene expression, both at the level of transcription and translation. METHODS It was investigated whether IFN-γ polymorphisms are associated with BKV infection. Genotyping of four single-nucleotide polymorphisms located in the IFN-γ gene were performed on DNA collected from a total of 251 RTRs (71 RTRs with BKV infection and 180 without BKV infection). RESULTS Analysis of the results showed that IFN-γ (rs12369470) CC genotype was significantly associated with susceptibility to BKV infection (OR: 2.9, 95% CI: 1.29-6.44, P=0.007) while the IFN-γ +874 (rs2435061) TT and (rs2406918) CC genotypes appear to be markers for protection against BKV infection (OR: 0.29, 95% CI: 0.1-0.83, P=0.01 for rs245061; OR: 0.61, 95% CI: 0.4-0.94, P=0.02 for rs24069718). A haplotype analysis using the combination of rs2435061-rs2406918-rs2870953 showed that the A-G-T haplotype was associated with a significantly reduced risk for BKV infection (OR: 0.43, 95% CI: 0.25-0.73, P=0.001). CONCLUSION Polymorphisms in the IFN-γ gene may confer certain protection or predisposition for BKV infection.","Vu, Don; Sakharkar, Prashant; Shah, Tariq; Naraghi, Robert; Yasir, Qazi; Hutchinson, Ian; Min, David",Transplantation,267,16

DATA SOURCES The epidemiology, clinical signs and symptoms, and modes of transmission of COVID-19 are presented. This protocol was established as an international collaboration of three dental universities: Hadassah School of Dental Medicine, Israel; University of Rochester Medical Center, USA; and the University of Pennsylvania, USA. This protocol is based on a detailed review of the existing English language literature as well on the logistic and clinical experience of each facility and the opinion of the authors. The protocol is designed for a hospital setting and includes considerations related to dental treatment in both healthy subjects and those suspected or diagnosed with COVID-19. The first part of this review discusses operatory considerations; the second part discusses general dental clinical aspects; the third part discusses endodontic considerations; and the fourth part discusses surgical aspects. This protocol may be applicable to other future similar pandemics. CONCLUSION Logistic and clinical steps are required to provide dental care during the COVID-19 outbreak while preventing cross-contamination and protecting the dental team during the provision of care.","Abramovitz, Itzhak; Palmon, Aaron; Levy, David; Karabucak, Bekir; Kot-Limon, Nurit; Shay, Boaz; Kolokythas, Antonia; Almoznino, Galit",Quintessence international,267,1

CASE REPORT During the quarantine period of the COVID-19 pandemic, a 70-year-old man presented with a 1-day history of a paracentral scotoma of the left eye (OS) associated with diaphoresis. Four days later, the patient developed fever (38° C) followed by cough. Oral and nasal swab PCR testing was positive for COVID-19. Visual acuity in the day of presentation was 20/20 in OD and 20/100 in OS. Multimodal retinal imaging was unremarkable in OD but cross-sectional OCT displayed focal hyperreflectivity at the level of the outer nuclear layer associated with disruption of the ellipsoid zone (EZ). The corresponding en face OCT revealed an inferonasal hyperreflective parafoveal lesion. At 1 month of follow-up, tracked OCT of the macula showed resolution of the hyperreflective signal, thinning of the outer nuclear layer, and near-complete recovery of EZ integrity. CONCLUSION Patients with Covid-19 may rarely present with signs and symptoms of ocular disease. This case report describes a case of sudden visual loss caused by AMN as the presenting manifestation of active Covid-19 infection.","Preti, Rony C; Zacharias, Leandro C; Cunha, Leonardo P; Monteiro, Mario L R",Retinal cases & brief reports,267,8

Human errors during ventilator settings are frequent and may be associated with high morbidity/mortality. The aim of the study was to provide a complete ergonomic evaluation of emergency and transport ventilators, taking into account objective and subjective human-machine interface assessments and individual mental work load. METHODS We performed a prospective bench ergonomic evaluation of 13 emergency and transport ventilators, using standardized conditions and a global methodological approach. The study was performed in an evaluation laboratory dedicated to respiratory care, and 12 emergency physicians unfamiliar with the tested devices were included in the evaluation. The ventilators were classified into 3 categories (simple, sophisticated, and ICU-like). Objective chronometric evaluations were conducted considering 9 tasks, and subjective evaluations were performed (ease of use, willingness to use, and user-friendliness of monitoring) using Likert scales. Mental work load evaluation was performed using the NASA Task Load Index scale. RESULTS Overall task failure rate represented 4% of all attempts. Setting modifications, ventilation mode changes, and powering down durations were different between simple and other emergency and transport ventilator categories (P < .005). There was no difference between ventilator categories for the ease of use and user-friendliness of the monitoring. In contrast, the willingness to use was lower for simple devices, compared with sophisticated and ICU-like emergency and transport ventilators (2.9 ± 1.4 vs 3.9 ± 1.2, P = .002 and 4.3 ± 1, P < .001). No differences were observed between devices regarding the mental work load, except for several specific devices in the sophisticated category. CONCLUSIONS A comprehensive ergonomic evaluation provides valuable information while investigating operational friendliness in emergency and transport ventilators. The choice of a device not only depends on its technical characteristics but should take into account its clinical operational setting and ergonomics in order to decrease mental work load. Sophisticated emergency and transport ventilators should only be used by clinicians who demonstrate expertise in mechanical ventilation.","Marjanovic, Nicolas; L'Her, Erwan",Respiratory care,267,1

To facilitate drug target identification for drug development, studies on molecular mechanisms, such as SARS-CoV-2 protein interactions, are urgently needed. In this study, we focused on Nsp2, a non-structural protein with largely unknown function and mechanism. The interactome of Nsp2 was revealed through the combination of affinity purification mass spectrometry (AP-MS) and stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC), and 84 proteins of high-confidence were identified. Gene ontology analysis demonstrated that Nsp2-interacting proteins are involved in several biological processes such as endosome transport and translation. Network analysis generated two clusters, including ribosome assembly and vesicular transport. Bio-layer interferometry (BLI) assay confirmed the bindings between Nsp2- and 4-interacting proteins, i.e. STAU2 (Staufen2), HNRNPLL, ATP6V1B2, and RAP1GDS1 (SmgGDS), which were randomly selected from the list of 84 proteins.

Enhanced instruments could improve procedural efficiency leading to better patient outcomes. MATERIAL AND METHODS One pair of non-articulating (straight) and two different pairs of articulating laparoscopic instruments were evaluated using a peg-transfer surgical task simulator by premedical college students. The instruments were comparatively tested using task performance measures, ergonomic measures, and participant questionnaires. RESULTS The straight instrument produced significantly higher task performance scores and lower task times compared to both articulating instruments (p < 0.05). The straight instrument required less muscle activation and less wrist deviation than the articulating instruments to perform the same task. Participants rated the straight instrument significantly easier to use and less difficult to complete the task than with either articulating instrument (p < 0.05 for both). CONCLUSIONS This exploratory study suggests that novices have difficulty using articulating instruments and perform better using straight laparoscopic instruments when first attempting LESS surgical tasks. Although a study with post-graduate medical trainees is needed to confirm these results, trainees should initially practice LESS with non-articulating instruments to gain proficiency at basic laparoscopic tasks. Additionally, redesigning articulating instruments to specifically address the spatial constraints and learning curve of LESS may also improve trainee performance and instrument usability.","Riggle, Jakeb D; Miller, Emily E; McCrory, Bernadette; Meitl, Alex; Lim, Eric; Hallbeck, M Susan; LaGrange, Chad A",Minimally invasive therapy & allied technologies : MITAT : official journal of the Society for Minimally Invasive Therapy,267,1

In this study, we evaluated the efficacy, costs, and benefits of a portable small-bore chest tube (Thoracic Egg; Sumitomo Bakelite Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) compared with a conventional chest tube. Methods We retrospectively analyzed all primary spontaneous pneumothorax patients who underwent treatment at Gangnam Severance Hospital between August 2014 and May 2018. Results A total of 279 patients were divided into 2 groups: the conventional group (n=236) and the Thoracic Egg group (n=43). Of the 236 patients in the conventional group, 100 were excluded because they underwent surgery during the study period. The efficacy and cost were compared between the 2 groups. There was no statistically significant difference between the groups regarding recurrence (conventional group, 36 patients [26.5%]; Thoracic Egg group, 15 patients [29.4%]; p=0.287). However, the Egg group had statistically significantly lower mean medical expenses than the conventional group (433,413 Korean won and 522,146 Korean won, respectively; p<0.001). Conclusion Although portable small-bore chest tubes may not be significantly more efficacious than conventional chest tubes, their use is significantly less expensive.

Through the use of telephone and video technology, virtual clinics were rapidly introduced to reduce hospital footfall. METHODS This retrospective cohort study analyzed patient experiences in virtual and traditional face-to-face clinics through the month of April 2020, from the second week of the government-imposed lockdown. A 5-point Visit-Specific Satisfaction Questionnaire was used to subsequently collect patients' feedback regarding their appointments. RESULTS A total of 107 hand injury-related follow-up appointments were recorded during the 4-week period. Sixty (56.0%) appointments were performed as a virtual consultation, and 47 (43.9%) face-to-face consultations were carried out on site. It was possible to discharge 43.3% from the virtual clinic group and 57.4% from the face-to-face group. We identified no significant difference in patient satisfaction (P = .368, Mann-Whitney U test) between the 2 cohorts. CONCLUSION Virtual clinics appear to be safe and effective for the follow-up of patients with traumatic hand injuries during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The observed facilitative effects are thought to be mediated by the vagal pathways, particularly the vagus nerve (VN) brainstem nuclei of the dorsal motor nucleus of vagus and nucleus tractus solitarius (DMV-NTS). Sense of smell is one of the major sensory modalities for inducing vomiting and nausea as a primary defense against potentially harmful intake of material. This study aimed to test effects of non-invasive, high and low frequency MNS on human olfactory functioning, with supplementary exploration of the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). Twenty healthy, male, adults performed supra-threshold odor intensity tests (labeled magnitude scale, LMS) for four food-related odorant samples (presented in three different concentrations) before and after receiving high-, low frequency MNS and placebo (no stimulation), while cortical activities in the OFC was monitored by the NIRS. Data of the NIRS and LMS test of separate stimulation parameters were statistically analyzed using mixed-model analysis of variance (ANOVA). Only the high frequency MNS showed effects for suppressing the intensity perception of the moderate concentration of Amyl Acetate (p:0.042) and strong concentration of Isovaleric Acid (p:0.004) and 1-Octen-3-ol (p:0.006). These behavioral changes were coupled with significant changes in the NIRS recordings of the left (p:0.000) and right (p:0.003) hemispheric orbitofrontal cortices. This is the first study that applied non-invasive, high frequency MNS to suppress the supra-threshold odor ratings of specific concentrations of odors. The vagal networks are potential relays of MNS to influence OFC. Results from the current article implore further research into non-invasive, high frequency MNS in the investigation of its modulatory effects on olfactory function, given its potential to be used for ameliorating nausea and malnutrition associated with various health conditions.","Maharjan, Ashim; Peng, Mei; Cakmak, Yusuf O",Frontiers in human neuroscience,267,1

Locally occurring disease resistance in various crops remains elusive. Here, we have observed that rice plants of the same cultivar can be differentiated into disease-resistant and susceptible phenotypes under the same pathogen pressure. Following the identification of a seed-endophytic bacterium as the resistance-conferring agent, integration of high-throughput data, gene mutagenesis and molecular interaction assays facilitated the discovery of the underlying mode of action. Sphingomonas melonis that is accumulated and transmitted across generations in disease-resistant rice seeds confers resistance to disease-susceptible phenotypes by producing anthranilic acid. Without affecting cell growth, anthranilic acid interferes with the sigma factor RpoS of the seed-borne pathogen Burkholderia plantarii, probably leading to impairment of upstream cascades that are required for virulence factor biosynthesis. The overall findings highlight the hidden role of seed endophytes in the phytopathology paradigm of 'disease triangles', which encompass the plant, pathogens and environmental conditions.

Fifteen food co-ops were identified in the Sydney region and the most common objective was to provide cheap affordable produce. Most co-ops (61%) were in areas of high socio-economic status (SES). Members of food co-ops had a higher vegetable intake than non-members [mean difference (MD) = 0.54 serves/daily; 95% confidence interval (CI) of 0.15 to 0.93] and were also more likely to meet the recommendations for fruit and vegetable intake [odds ratio (OR) = 4.77 (95% CI = 1.15, 19.86)]. Implications of this study are that if food co-ops can be implemented on a wider scale, they hold potential for improving fruit and vegetable intakes.","Mihrshahi, Seema; Partridge, Stephanie R; Zheng, Xiaolei; Ramachandran, Divya; Chia, Debbie; Boylan, Sinead; Chau, Josephine Y",International journal of environmental research and public health,267,7

Although mice deficient in both pathways fail to control IAV and succumb to lethal respiratory infection, RIPK3-mediated apoptosis by itself can limit IAV, without need for necroptosis. However, whether necroptosis, conventionally considered a fail-safe cell death mechanism to apoptosis, can restrict IAV-or indeed any virus-in the absence of apoptosis is not known. Here, we use mice selectively deficient in IAV-activated apoptosis to show that necroptosis drives robust antiviral immune responses and promotes effective virus clearance from infected lungs when apoptosis is absent. We also demonstrate that apoptosis and necroptosis are mutually exclusive fates in IAV-infected cells. Thus, necroptosis is an independent, ""stand-alone"" cell death mechanism that fully compensates for the absence of apoptosis in antiviral host defense.","Shubina, Maria; Tummers, Bart; Boyd, David F; Zhang, Ting; Yin, Chaoran; Gautam, Avishekh; Guo, Xi-Zhi J; Rodriguez, Diego A; Kaiser, William J; Vogel, Peter; Green, Douglas R; Thomas, Paul G; Balachandran, Siddharth",The Journal of experimental medicine,267,4

The Musculoskeletal Infection Society (MSIS) recommends diagnosing PJI according to its guidelines. The aim of the current study was to assess whether fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded periprosthetic membranes can successfully improve the diagnosis of infection in patients with orthopaedic implants. METHODS We retrospectively analyzed 88 periprosthetic membranes of joint prostheses using FISH analysis according to a standard protocol, with a probe targeting a sequence found in most bacteria. We compared the results with routine clinical classification according to the guidelines of the MSIS, microbiological culture, and histopathological classification according to Morawietz and Krenn. We additionally performed FISH analysis using 2 species-specific probes for several culture-positive cases. RESULTS FISH successfully detected bacteria in 38 (95%) of 40 periprosthetic membranes that were rated positive by clinical classification. FISH results compared with clinical classification demonstrated a sensitivity of 95% (95% confidence interval [CI], 83.08% to 99.39%), a specificity of 85.42% (95% CI, 72.24% to 93.93%), a positive predictive value of 84.44% (95% CI, 70.55% to 93.50%), and a negative predictive value of 95.35% (95% CI, 84.19% to 99.43%). FISH results compared with histopathological classification demonstrated a sensitivity of 95.12% (95% CI, 83.47% to 99.40%), a specificity of 87.23% (95% CI, 74.26% to 95.17%), a positive predictive value of 86.67% (95% CI, 73.21% to 94.95%), and a negative predictive value of 95.35% (95% CI, 84.19% to 99.43%). We successfully detected Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus with species-specific FISH probes in all cases that were positive for these respective bacteria by microbiological culture. CONCLUSIONS FISH-based diagnosis of PJI is feasible and can be used as an additional diagnostic criterion. FISH not only can detect bacteria in periprosthetic membranes but can also differentiate pathogens at the species level. FISH represents a fast and reliable tool for detecting PJI in periprosthetic membranes, especially in combination with clinical and histopathological classification.

Pediatric RCTs frequently recruit from a smaller pool of patients making adequate recruitment difficult. One factor which influences recruitment and retention in pediatric trials is patient and parent preferences for treatment. Purpose To systematically review pediatric RCTs reporting treatment preference. Methods Database searches included: MEDLINE, CINAHL, EMBASE, and COCHRANE.Qualitative or quantitative papers were eligible if they reported: pediatric population, (0-17 years) recruited to an RCT and reported treatment preference for all or some of the participants/parents in any clinical area. Data extraction included: Number of eligible participants consenting to randomisation arms, number of eligible patients not randomised because of treatment preference, and any further information reported on preferences (e.g., if parent preference was different from child). Results Fifty-two studies were included. The number of eligible families declining participation in an RCT because of preference for treatment varied widely (between 2 and 70%) in feasibility, conventional and preference trial designs. Some families consented to trial involvement despite having preferences for a specific treatment. Data relating to 'participant flow and recruitment' was not always reported consistently, therefore numbers who were lost to follow-up or withdrew due to preference could not be extracted. Conclusions Families often have treatment preferences which may affect trial recruitment. Whilst children appear to hold treatment preferences, this is rarely reported. Further investigation is needed to understand the reasons for preference and the impact preference has on RCT recruitment, retention and outcome.","Beasant, L; Brigden, A; Parslow, R M; Apperley, H; Keep, T; Northam, A; Wray, C; King, H; Langdon, R; Mills, N; Young, B; Crawley, E",Contemporary clinical trials communications,267,27

The effectiveness of tFUS on human brain has been demonstrated, but how tFUS influences the human voluntary motor processing in the brain remains unclear. METHODS We apply low-intensity tFUS to modulate the movement-related cortical potential (MRCP) originating from human subjects practicing a voluntary foot tapping task. 64-channel electroencephalograph (EEG) is recorded concurrently and further used to reconstruct the brain source activity specifically at the primary leg motor cortical area using the electrophysiological source imaging (ESI). RESULTS The ESI illustrates the ultrasound modulated MRCP source dynamics with high spatiotemporal resolutions. The MRCP source is imaged and its source profile is further evaluated for assessing the tFUS neuromodulatory effects on the voluntary MRCP. Moreover, the effect of ultrasound pulse repetition frequency (UPRF) is further assessed in modulating the MRCP. The ESI results show that tFUS significantly increases the MRCP source profile amplitude (MSPA) comparing to a sham ultrasound condition, and further, a high UPRF enhances the MSPA more than a low UPRF does. CONCLUSION The present results demonstrate the neuromodulatory effects of the low-intensity tFUS on enhancing the human voluntary movement-related cortical activities evidenced through the ESI imaging. SIGNIFICANCE This work provides the first evidence of tFUS enhancing the human endogenous motor cortical activities through excitatory modulation.","Yu, Kai; Liu, Chang; Niu, Xiaodan; He, Bin",IEEE transactions on bio-medical engineering,267,31

Notably, multi-functional mixed fullerene ETLs show great potential in further improving both the power conversion efficiency (PCE) and stability of PSCs compared to the single PC61BM ETL. In this work, we reported the mixed fullerene ETLs comprising of PC61BM and its two analogs with different length of fluorocarbon chains, [6,6]-phenyl-C61-buryric acid 1H, 1H-trifluoro-1-ethyl ester (abbr. as CF3-PC61BM) and [6,6]-phenyl-C61-buryric acid 1H, 1H-tridecafluoro-1- heptyl ester (abbr. as C6F13-PC61BM).

Methods: The placentas delivered from pregnant women with confirmed 2019-nCoV infection which were received in the Department of Pathology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology collected by February 4th, 2020 and retrospectively studied. Their clinical material including placental tissue and lung CT, and laboratory results were collected, meanwhile, nucleic acid detection of 2019-nCoV of the placentas were performed by RT-PCR. Results: Three placentas delivered from pregnant women with confirmed 2019-nCoV infection, who were all in their third trimester with emergency caesarean section. All of the three patients presented with fever (one before caesarean and two in postpartum), and had no significant leukopenia and lymphopenia. Neonatal throat swabs from three newborns were tested for 2019-nCoV, and all samples were negative for the nucleic acid of 2019-nCoV. One premature infant was transferred to Department of Neonatology due to low birth weight. By the end of February 25, 2020, none of the three patients developed severe 2019-nCoV pneumonia or died(two patients had been cured and discharged, while another one had been transferred to a square cabin hospital for isolation treatment). There were various degrees of fibrin deposition inside and around the villi with local syncytial nodule increases in all three placentas. One case of placenta showed the concomitant morphology of chorionic hemangioma and another one with massive placental infarction. No pathological change of villitis and chorioamnionitis was observed in our observation of three cases. All samples from three placentas were negative for the nucleic acid of 2019-nCoV. Conclusions: The clinical characteristics of pregnant women with 2019-nCoV infection in late pregnancy are similar to those of non-pregnant patients, and no severe adverse pregnancy outcome is found in the 3 cases of our observation.

In individuals who are immunocompromised, JCPyV can become reactivated and cause a lytic infection in the central nervous system resulting in the fatal, demyelinating disease progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). Infection is initiated by interactions between the capsid protein viral protein 1 (VP1) and the α2,6-linked sialic acid on lactoseries tetrasaccharide c (LSTc), while JCPyV internalization is facilitated by 5-hydroxytryptamine 2 receptors (5-HT2Rs). The mechanisms by which the serotonin receptors mediate virus entry and the signaling cascades required to drive viral infection remain poorly understood. JCPyV was previously shown to induce phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), a downstream target of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, upon virus entry. However, it remained unclear whether ERK activation was required for JCPyV infection. Both ERK-specific small interfering RNA (siRNA) and ERK inhibitor treatments resulted in significantly diminished JCPyV infection in both kidney and glial cells yet had no effect on the infectivity of the polyomavirus simian virus 40 (SV40). Experiments characterizing the role of ERK during steps in the viral life cycle indicate that ERK activation is required for viral transcription, as demonstrated by a significant reduction in production of large T antigen (TAg), a key viral protein associated with the initiation of viral transcription and viral replication. These findings delineate the role of the MAPK-ERK signaling pathway in JCPyV infection, elucidating how the virus reprograms the host cell to promote viral pathogenesis.IMPORTANCE Viral infection is dependent upon host cell factors, including the activation of cellular signaling pathways. These interactions between viruses and host cells are necessary for infection and play an important role in viral disease outcomes. The focus of this study was to determine how the human JC polyomavirus (JCPyV), a virus that resides in the kidney of the majority of the population and can cause the fatal, demyelinating disease progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) in the brains of immunosuppressed individuals, usurps a cellular signaling pathway to promote its own infectious life cycle. We demonstrated that the activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), a component of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, promotes JCPyV transcription, which is required for viral infection. Our findings demonstrate that the MAPK-ERK signaling pathway is a key determinant of JCPyV infection, elucidating new information regarding the signal reprogramming of host cells by a pathogenic virus.","DuShane, Jeanne K; Wilczek, Michael P; Mayberry, Colleen L; Maginnis, Melissa S",Journal of virology,267,1

To further investigate this sex difference, we examined the role of ACE2 in Ang-[1-8] (angiotensin [1-8])-induced hypertension and regulation of the renin-angiotensin system in the kidney of WT (wild type) and Ace2 KO (knockout) mice. Mean arterial pressure rose faster in WT male than WT female mice after Ang-[1-8] infusion. This sex difference was attenuated in ACE2 KO mice. Ang-[1-8] infusion reduced glomerular AT1R (angiotensin type 1 receptor) binding in WT female mice by 30%, and deletion of Ace2 abolished this effect. In contrast, Ang-[1-8] infusion increased glomerular AT1R binding in WT male mice by 1.2-fold, and this effect of Ang-[1-8] persisted in Ace2 KO male mice (1.3-fold). ACE2 also had an effect on renal protein expression of the neutral endopeptidase NEP (neprilysin), the enzyme that catabolizes Ang-[1-10] (angiotensin [1-10]), the precursor of Ang-[1-8]. Ang-[1-8] infusion downregulated NEP protein expression by 20% in WT male, whereas there was a slight increase in NEP expression in WT female mice. Deletion of Ace2 resulted in lowered NEP expression after Ang-[1-8] infusion in both sexes. These findings suggest sex-specific ACE2 regulation of the renin-angiotensin system contributes to female protection from Ang-[1-8]-induced hypertension. These findings have ramifications for the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, especially in hypertension since ACE2 is the SARS-CoV-2 receptor and hypertension is a major risk factor for poor outcomes.","Ji, Hong; de Souza, Aline M A; Bajaj, Bilkish; Zheng, Wei; Wu, Xie; Speth, Robert C; Sandberg, Kathryn",Hypertension,267,28

This stress may consequently enhance maternal inflammation, pregnancy complication, and fetal loss.

Fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG-PET) has recently proved to be an important diagnostic tool in this condition since it may highlight brain metabolism abnormalities in a very early stage of the disease. Two main 18F-FDG-PET patterns have been described: the mixed hypermetabolic/hypometabolic and the neurodegenerative one. Arterial spin labeling (ASL) is an MRI technique showing brain perfusion, rarely used in autoimmune neurological conditions. The aim of the present study was to study patients with LE with both techniques, in order to compare their results. METHODS Two patients with LE underwent to 18F-FDG-PET and ASL MRI scans using the pseudo-continuous arterial spin labeling (PCASL) technique. Areas of altered perfusion and metabolism were analyzed by visual inspection, and findings were compared between the two techniques. RESULTS In the first patient, a relapsing LGI-1 LE, right hippocampal hypermetabolism was detected by 18F-FDG-PET (mixed hypermetabolic/hypometabolic pattern), while ASL MRI showed right hippocampal increased perfusion. In the second patient, a seronegative LE, 18F-FDG-PET scan detected a left hemispheric hypoperfusion (neurodegenerative pattern) and ASL MRI yielded similar results. The two 18F-FDG-PET patterns of altered metabolism were similarly detected by ASL imaging. CONCLUSION ASL and 18F-FDG-PET findings are strongly concordant in LE. ASL imaging was able to detect the two main 18F-FDG-PET patterns previously described in patients with LE.","Dinoto, Alessandro; Cheli, Marta; Ajčević, Miloš; Dore, Franca; Crisafulli, Carmelo; Ukmar, Maja; Sartori, Arianna; Manganotti, Paolo",Neurological sciences : official journal of the Italian Neurological Society and of the Italian Society of Clinical Neurophysiology,267,16

PURPOSE Visual performance has gradually gained recognition in baseball as a tool that can optimize on-field performance. It also may be useful in player development programs that gradually move players toward the major league. METHODS Recently, over the past 5 years, vision data from six different major league teams were used by the authors to assess prospective players before the annual Major League Baseball (MLB) draft. One thousand three hundred forty-three vision forms were evaluated representing 759 different players. Their vision data were retrospectively analyzed using a novel grading method to advise teams on the visual readiness of prospects for success in MLB. RESULTS On a one (best)-to-six (worst) vision scale, the average vision score was 2.080 ± 1.171. Sixty-eight percent (320/473) of the players with good vision scores were drafted, 66% (185/281) of the players with moderate vision scores were drafted, and only 1 player with a poor vision score was drafted. There was a statistically significant difference in the amount of signing bonus received by draftees with better vision scores compared with those with lower vision scores (P < .003 to P < .001). Draftees with the highest vision scores also received the highest signing bonuses as they entered MLB. CONCLUSIONS For both potential draftees and teams, the vision score seems to be a valuable tool in selecting players for the MLB draft. Adding the pre-draft visual assessment score to a team's projection model could help reduce the uncertainty surrounding the player draft and future service to the team.","Kirschen, David G; Laby, Daniel M",Optometry and vision science : official publication of the American Academy of Optometry,267,17

METHODS A case series of 10 total laparoscopic hysterectomies was conducted for benign indications and a vascular study was performed ex vivo on the surgical specimen, demonstrating ipsilateral and contralateral flow between the uterine artery (UA) and UOV visualizing anastomoses between these vessels. The flow pattern was documented using heparinized saline and illustrated through fluoroscopy using Isovue-300 dye. RESULTS Successful cannulation of UA was accomplished in all 10 cases. Ipsilateral flow between the UA and UOV was demonstrated in all except one case, and contralateral flow was observed. Due to the long interval between the time of specimen retrieval and vascular study, the time to cannulation limited the ability to demonstrate ipsilateral and contralateral flow in 2 cases. CONCLUSION Uterine transplantation has become a viable option for women with absolute uterine factor infertility. However, this surgery requires extensive surgical dissection, and the surgical retrieval of the uterine vein proposes a challenge.

The group appointment improves patient throughput and also provides a positive patient experience. Group visits offer a viable solution for increasing patient access to CI while maintaining quality in a busy academic medical center setting.","Sydlowski, Sarah; Donovan, Cara; McNair, Jordan; Hahn, Katie; Petter, Karen; Marks, Tina; Haberkamp, Tom; Nguyen-Huynh, Anh; Podriznik, James; Woodson, Erika","Otology & neurotology : official publication of the American Otological Society, American Neurotology Society [and] European Academy of Otology and Neurotology",267,30

STUDY DESIGN We performed a retrospective chart review of seventy-two children with a BAL pepsin obtained through our Aerodigestive Center over an 18-month period. BAL outcomes include evidence of viral, bacterial, or fungal infection, presence of lipid laden macrophages, and cytology (eosinophils, neutrophils, and lymphocytes). Gastrointestinal outcomes include esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) and pH impedance probe findings. Other characteristics include serum eosinophil, neutrophils, and lymphocytes; spirometry; FeNO; and IgE. RESULTS Seventy-two patients underwent BAL pepsin testing. Median age was 4.9 years, 30.6% had severe persistent asthma, and 59.2% were on reflux medication. There was an association between positive BAL pepsin assay and positive viral panel (p=0.002) or fungal culture (p=0.027). No significant association found between positive BAL bacterial culture; BAL cytology; presence of BAL lipid laden macrophages; IgE; spirometry; FeNO; CBC neutrophil, eosinophil, or lymphocytes; pH impedance testing parameters; or EGD pathology. CONCLUSIONS BAL pepsin is associated with a positive BAL viral PCR or fungal culture. Lack of correlation between pepsin-positivity and pH-impedance parameters or EGD pathology suggests microaspiration may be due to an acute event (such as a respiratory infection) rather than chronic GERD. This may be especially true in the presence of a positive viral panel or fungal culture when a BAL pepsin is obtained. This article is protected by copyright.

Cumulative exposure to PPTEs can lead to clinically significant symptoms of mental disorders. PURPOSE We designed the current study to investigate the prevalence of different PPTEs among Canadian nurses and estimate the associations between diverse exposures and several mental disorders. METHODS Canadian nurses (i.e., registered nurses, registered psychiatric nurses, licensed practical nurses, nurse practitioners) completed an online, self-reported survey. In total, 4067 participants (94.8% women) completed all relevant survey measures. RESULTS Nurses reported exposures to several PPTE categories including severe human suffering, life threatening illness or injury, and physical assault, often 11 or more times. There were significant (p<.05) associations between diverse traumatic events and all mental disorders (i.e., Posttraumatic Stress Disorder, Major Depressive Disorder, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Panic Disorder) except Alcohol Use Disorder. CONCLUSIONS The current findings suggest that Canadian nurses are substantially exposed to traumatic events, which vary by several sociodemographic categories. PPTE exposures were significantly associated with mental disorders; that is, if PPTEs were eliminated among Canadian nurses in the sample, symptoms would be reduced between 42.0% and 58.0%.","Stelnicki, Andrea M; Jamshidi, Laleh; Ricciardelli, Rosemary; Carleton, R Nicholas",The Canadian journal of nursing research = Revue canadienne de recherche en sciences infirmieres,267,1

Radical prostatectomy (RP) is the standard of care in the management of clinically localized cancer, but is considered complicated due to the presence of adhesions, and the location of transplanted ureter/kidney. To date, a few case series or studies on RP in RTR have been published, especially in Asian patients. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety and report the experience with RP on RTR. METHODS We retrospectively reviewed data of 1270 patients who underwent RP from January 2008 to March 2020, of which 5 patients were RTR. All available baseline characteristics, perioperative and postoperative data (operative time, estimated blood loss (EBL), complications, length of hospital stay, complication), pathological stage, Gleason score, surgical margin status, and pre/postoperative creatinine were reviewed. RESULTS Of the 5 RTR who underwent RPs (1 open radical prostatectomy (ORP), 1 laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (LRP), 2 robotic-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomies (RALRP), and 1 Retzius-sparing RALRP (RS-RALRP)) prostatectomy, the mean age (± SD) was 70 (± 5.62) years. In LRP and RALRP cases, the standard ports were moved slightly medially to prevent graft injury. The mean operative time ranged from 190 to 365 min. The longest operative time and highest EBL (630 ml) was the ORP case due to severe adhesion in Retzius space. For LRP and RALRP cases, the operative times seemed comparable and had EBL of ≤ 300 ml. All RPs were successful without any major intra-operative complication. There was no significant change in graft function. The restorations of urinary continence were within 1 month in RS-RALRP, approximately 6 months in RALRP, and about 1 year in ORP and LRP. Three patients with positive surgical margins had prostate-specific antigen (PSA) persistence at the first follow-up and 1 had later PSA recurrence. Two patients with negative margins were free from biochemical recurrence at 47 and 3 months after their RP. CONCLUSIONS Our series suggested that all RP techniques are safe and feasible mode of treatment for localized prostate cancer in RTR.","Sirisopana, Kun; Jenjitranant, Pocharapong; Sangkum, Premsant; Kijvikai, Kittinut; Pacharatakul, Suthep; Leenanupunth, Charoen; Kochakarn, Wachira; Kongchareonsombat, Wisoot",BMC urology,267,7

METHODOLOGY This was a retrospective and descriptive study based on 878 individuals suspected of harboring infectious diseases during two consecutive years, 2012-2013. More than 25 different pathogens were investigated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based methods. The individuals were stratified into gender, occupation, and age groups. RESULTS The pathogen with more clinical requests was hepatitis C virus, investigated in 225 individuals (30.0%), followed by Leptospira spp., in 187 (24.9%). Overall, data demonstrated a gender distribution bias, where 72.9% of cases were males. The age group of 25 to 44 years was the class with more clinical requests. Regarding occupation, a predominance of construction workers (12.0%) was observed, followed by retired workers (11.0%). Patient distribution per year showed a higher number of patients in the fall months. Diagnoses of leptospirosis and respiratory virus infections presented seasonality.

It has been recognized recently as a promising antiviral drug against a wide array of RNA viruses (including SARS/MERS-CoV5). We aimed at determining which drugs used in dentistry interact with Remdesivir in order to avoid adverse reactions that may worsen the condition of patients with COVID-19. MATERIALS AND METHODS A literature review was conducted to identify potential drug interactions between remdesivir (used in the treatment of COVID-19) and drugs prescribed in dentistry. The search was made in the databases PubMed and MEDLINE and official websites using key terms remdesivir, drug interactions and dentistry for articles published up to 31st July 2020. RESULTS According to the articles reviewed, a total of 279 drugs interact with Remdesivir. Two major interactions have been reported, 277 moderate drug interactions, and one with alcohol/food. The drug interactions involving drugs prescribed in dentistry are all moderate drug interactions and are (according to drug group): (1) antibiotics: azithromycin, clavulanate, doxycycline, erythromycin, levofloxacin; (2) antifungals: clotrimazole, fluconazole, itraconazole, ketoconazole; (3) non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (NAIDS): celecoxib diclofenac, etodolac, flurbiprofen, ibuprofen, ketoprofen, ketorolac, mefenamic acid, naproxen, piroxicam. CONCLUSIONS It is clinically necessary for oral health professionals to be aware of possible drug interactions that may occur between remdesivir and drugs commonly prescribed in dentistry in order to prevent adverse reactions that may even endanger the life of a patient with COVID-19.","Gómez-Moreno, G",European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,267,16

Despite the existence of effective treatment, undiagnosed OSA remains a challenge. The gold standard diagnostic tool is polysomnography (PSG), yet the test is expensive, labour intensive and time-consuming. Home-based, limited channel sleep study testing (levels 3 and 4) can advance and widen access to diagnostic services. This systematic review aims to summarise available evidence regarding the cost-effectiveness of limited channel tests compared to laboratory and home PSG in diagnosing OSA. METHODS Eligible studies will be identified using a comprehensive strategy across the following databases from inception onwards: MEDLINE, PsychINFO, SCOPUS, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, Emcare and Web of Science Core Collection and ProQuest databases. The search will include a full economic evaluation (i.e. cost-effectiveness, cost-utility, cost-benefit, cost-consequences and cost-minimisation analysis) that assesses limited channel tests and PSG. Two reviewers will screen, extract data for included studies and critically appraise the articles for bias and quality. Meta-analyses will be conducted if aggregation of outcomes can be performed. Qualitative synthesis using a dominance ranking matrix will be performed for heterogeneous data. DISCUSSION This systematic review protocol uses a rigorous, reproducible and transparent methodology and eligibility criteria to provide the current evidence relating to the clinical and economic impact of limited channel and full PSG OSA diagnostic tests. Evidence will be examined using standardised tools specific for economic evaluation studies.

OBJECTIVE To evaluate the degree to which hospital outcome ratings and potential eligibility for financial incentives are altered after including initial stroke severity in a claims-based risk model for hospital 30-day mortality for acute ischemic stroke. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS Data were analyzed from 782 Get With The Guidelines-Stroke participating hospitals on 127,950 fee-for-service Medicare beneficiaries with ischemic stroke who had a score documented for the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS, a 15-item neurological examination scale with scores from 0 to 42, with higher scores indicating more severe stroke) between April 2003 and December 2009. Performance of claims-based hospital mortality risk models with and without inclusion of NIHSS scores for 30-day mortality was evaluated and hospital rankings from both models were compared. MAIN OUTCOMES MEASURES Model discrimination, hospital 30-day mortality outcome rankings, and value-based purchasing financial incentive categories. RESULTS Across the study population, the mean (SD) NIHSS score was 8.23 (8.11) (median, 5; interquartile range, 2-12). There were 18,186 deaths (14.5%) within the first 30 days, including 7430 deaths (5.8%) during the index hospitalization. The hospital mortality model with NIHSS scores had significantly better discrimination than the model without (C statistic, 0.864; 95% CI, 0.861-0.867, vs 0.772; 95% CI, 0.769-0.776; P < .001). Among hospitals ranked in the top 20% or bottom 20% of performers by the claims model without NIHSS scores, 26.3% were ranked differently by the model with NIHSS scores. Of hospitals initially classified as having ""worse than expected"" mortality, 57.7% were reclassified to ""as expected"" by the model with NIHSS scores. The net reclassification improvement (93.1%; 95% CI, 91.6%-94.6%; P < .001) and integrated discrimination improvement (15.0%; 95% CI, 14.6%-15.3%; P < .001) indexes both demonstrated significant enhancement of model performance after the addition of NIHSS. Explained variance and model calibration was also improved with the addition of NIHSS scores. CONCLUSION Adding stroke severity as measured by the NIHSS to a hospital 30-day risk model based on claims data for Medicare beneficiaries with acute ischemic stroke was associated with considerably improved model discrimination and change in mortality performance rankings for a substantial portion of hospitals.","Fonarow, Gregg C; Pan, Wenqin; Saver, Jeffrey L; Smith, Eric E; Reeves, Mathew J; Broderick, Joseph P; Kleindorfer, Dawn O; Sacco, Ralph L; Olson, DaiWai M; Hernandez, Adrian F; Peterson, Eric D; Schwamm, Lee H",JAMA,267,8

A recent analysis of 3,615 genomes of serotype M1 group A Streptococcus strains (the so-called ""flesh-eating"" bacterium) identified a recombination event that coincides with the global M1 pandemic beginning in the early 1980s. Here, we have shown that the allelic variation that results from this recombination event, which replaces the chromosomal region encoding secreted NADase and streptolysin O, is the key driver of increased toxin production and enhanced infection severity of the M1 pandemic strains. Using isoallelic mutant strains, we found that 3 polymorphisms in this toxin gene region increase resistance to killing by human polymorphonuclear leukocytes, increase bacterial proliferation, and increase virulence in animal models of pharyngitis and necrotizing fasciitis. Genome sequencing of an additional 1,125 streptococcal strains and virulence studies revealed that a highly similar recombinational replacement event underlies an ongoing intercontinental epidemic of serotype M89 group A Streptococcus infections. By identifying the molecular changes that enhance upper respiratory tract fitness, increased resistance to innate immunity, and increased tissue destruction, we describe a mechanism that underpins epidemic streptococcal infections, which have affected many millions of people.","Zhu, Luchang; Olsen, Randall J; Nasser, Waleed; Beres, Stephen B; Vuopio, Jaana; Kristinsson, Karl G; Gottfredsson, Magnus; Porter, Adeline R; DeLeo, Frank R; Musser, James M",The Journal of clinical investigation,267,1

Accessing continuing professional development is one of those challenges and is related to retention of workforce. Effectiveness of distance learning strategies for continuing professional development in rural allied healthcare workers has not been evaluated. METHODS We searched 17 databases and the grey literature up to September 2016 following the PRISMA guidelines. Any primary studies were included that focussed on allied health and distance delivery regardless of education topic or study design. Two independent reviewers extracted data and critically appraised the selected studies. RESULTS The search returned 5257 results. With removal of duplicate references, we reviewed 3964 article titles and abstracts; n = 206 appeared potentially eligible and were scrutinised via full text screening; n = 14 were included. Studies were published between 1997 and 2016, were of varied methodological quality and were predominantly from Australia, USA and Canada with a focus on satisfaction of learners with the delivery method or on measures of educational outcomes. Technologies used to deliver distance education included video conference, teleconference, web based platforms and virtual reality. Early papers tended to focus more on the technology characteristics than educational outcomes. Some studies compared technology based delivery to face to face modes and found satisfaction and learning outcomes to be on par. Only three studies reported on practice change following the educational intervention and, despite a suggestion there is a link between the constructs, none measured the relationship between access to continuing professional development and workforce retention. CONCLUSION Technology based options of delivery have a high utility, however the complex inter-relatedness of time, use, travel, location, costs, interactivity, learning outcomes and educational design suggest a need for more sophisticated consideration by educational providers.

Random-effects meta-analysis was used to pool estimates of odds ratio (OR) or weighted mean difference (WMD) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) across studies. RESULTS Meta-analysis data were available for age, sex, hospital duration, disease severity, seven comorbidities, five symptoms, five indexes of blood routine, nine indexes of blood biochemistry, four treatment therapies, two antibodies, and history of high-risk contact. Among them, hospital duration of recurrence cases was significantly shorter than nonrecurrence subjects (WMD, -1.55 days; 95% CI, -2.66 to -0.45). Fatigue, positive IgM, and positive IgG were associated with an increased risk of recurrence cases, with ORs and 95% CIs of 4.06 (1.14-14.4), 2.95 (1.15-7.61), and 3.45 (1.58-7.54), respectively.

Histology remains the gold standard diagnostic of donor steatosis despite the lack of consensus definition and its subjective nature. In this prospective observational study of liver transplant patients, we demonstrate the feasibility of using a handheld optical backscatter probe to assess the degree of hepatic steatosis and correlate the backscatter readings with clinical outcomes. The probe is placed on the surface of the liver and emits red and near infrared light from the tip of the device and measures the amount of backscatter of light from liver tissue via two photodiodes. Measurement of optical backscatter (Mantel Cox p<0.0001) and histopathological scoring of macrovesicular steatosis (Mantel Cox p=0.046), were predictive of 5-year graft survival. Recipients with early allograft dysfunction defined according to both Olthoff (p=0.0067) and MEAF score (p=0.0097) had significantly higher backscatter levels from the donor organ. Backscatter was predictive of graft loss (AUC 0.75, p=0.0045). This study demonstrates the feasibility of real-time measurement of optical backscatter in donor livers. Early results indicate readings correlate with steatosis and may give insight to graft outcomes such as early allograft dysfunction and graft loss.","Richards, James A; Randle, Lucy V; Butler MChir, Andrew J; Martin, Jack L; Fedotovs, Arturs; Davies, Susan E; Watson, Christopher Je; Robertson, Paul A",Transplant international : official journal of the European Society for Organ Transplantation,267,16

In spite of attempts to create a theoretical framework in the early 2000s, a thorough understanding of sports clubs as a setting for health promotion (HP) is lacking. Despite calls for more effective, sustainable, and theoretically grounded interventions, previous literature reviews have identified no controlled studies assessing HP interventions in sports clubs. This systematic mapping review details how the settings-based approach is applied through HP interventions in sports clubs and highlights facilitators and barriers for sports clubs to become health-promoting settings. In addition, the mapped facilitators and barriers have been used to reformulate previous guidelines of HP in sports clubs. Seven databases were searched for empirical research published between 1986 and 2017. Fifty-eight studies were included, principally coming from Australia and Europe, describing 33 unique interventions, which targeted mostly male participants in team sports. The settings-based approach was not yet applied in sports clubs, as more than half of the interventions implemented in sports club targeted only one level of the socio-ecological model, as well as focused only on study participants rather than the club overall. Based on empirical data, the analysis of facilitators and barriers helped develop revised guidelines for sports clubs to implement settings-based HP. This will be particularly useful when implementing HP initiatives to aid in the development of sports clubs working with a whole setting approach.","Geidne, Susanna; Kokko, Sami; Lane, Aoife; Ooms, Linda; Vuillemin, Anne; Seghers, Jan; Koski, Pasi; Kudlacek, Michal; Johnson, Stacey; Van Hoye, Aurélie",Health education & behavior : the official publication of the Society for Public Health Education,267,1

Areas emphasized in the program included (1) personalized support for wellness; (2) prioritizing physical activity, healthy eating, sleep, and stress management; and (3) establishment of strength-based, sustainable solutions to improve health and well-being. Partnerships were implemented for 188 nurses who were coached by 49 APN students; 104 nurses participated for 6 weeks. In the program evaluation, 98% of nurses shared that the wellness support program helped them engage in self-care and wellness, and 94.7% agreed or strongly agreed that The Wellness Partner Program helped them improve their mental and physical health. In the midst of the pandemic, nurses were supported to cope with stress, focus on self-care and wellness goals, and address challenges to their well-being.","Teall, Alice M; Mazurek Melnyk, Bernadette",Nursing administration quarterly,267,1

A pilot study conducted in 2017 among GMT pilgrims showed that 41.8% of participants reported respiratory symptoms, mostly due to rhinovirus (13.0%), coronaviruses (16.0%) and adenovirus (4.6%). METHODS A PCR-based prospective cohort study was conducted among GMT pilgrims and controls (who did not participate to the event) in two rural villages in South Senegal, in 2019. RESULTS 93 pilgrims and 84 controls were included in the study. There were no significant differences between pilgrims and controls regarding demographic characteristics and chronic conditions. 60.2% of pilgrims reported respiratory symptoms during their stay in Touba, or soon after their return. By contrast, only 8.3% of controls reported respiratory symptoms after the GMT. The acquisition of rhinovirus, coronaviruses, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Moraxella catarrhalis was 22.6%, 6.5%, 17.2% and 6.8% respectively in pilgrims and was significantly higher than in controls (3.6%, 0%, 4.8% and 1.2% respectively). Respiratory symptoms post-GMT were five times more frequent in S. pneumoniae carriers (aOR = 5.18, 95%CI = [1.98 - 13.57]). CONCLUSION This study demonstrates that individuals who participated in the GMT were at higher risk of suffering from respiratory symptoms and that this was linked to the acquisition of S. pneumoniae.","Goumballa, Ndiaw; Hoang, Van Thuan; Perieres, Lauren; Anh Ly, Tran Duc; Gaye, Papa Mouhamadou; Diouf, Fatou Samba; Parola, Philippe; Sokhna, Cheikh; Gautret, Philippe",Travel medicine and infectious disease,267,1

This pandemic is the third fatal coronavirus outbreak that has already occurred in the 21st century. Even six months after its emergence, hundreds of thousands of people are still being infected with SARS-CoV-2, and thousands of lives are lost every day across the world. No effective therapy has been approved to date for the prevention or treatment of this disease, suggesting the need to broaden the scope in the search for effective treatments. Throughout history, folk medicine has been successfully used to treat various ailments in humans and Traditional Chinese Medicine has been instrumental in the containment of a number of viral diseases. Owing to their high chemical diversity and safety profiles, natural products offer great promises as potentially effective antiviral drugs. In recent years, a large number of anti-coronaviral phytochemicals with different mechanisms of action have been identified. Among them, tetra-O-galloyl-β-D-glucose, caffeic acid, and saikosaponin B2 block viral entry. A number of flavonoids inhibit viral proteases. Silvestrol inhibits protein synthesis. Myricetin and scutellarein inhibit viral replication. Emodin, luteolin, and quercetin demonstrate anti-coronaviral activity by inhibiting multiple processes in the virus life cycle. In this review, we critically evaluate the findings of the natural product-based anti-coronaviral research that has been published during last two decades, and attempt to provide a comprehensive description about their utility as potential broad-spectrum anti-coronaviral drugs, examining leads that may guide/facilitate anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug development studies.","Wijayasinghe, Yasanandana Supunsiri; Bhansali, Pravin; Viola, Ronald E; Kamal, Mohammad A; Poddar, Nitesh Kumar",Current pharmaceutical design,267,1

Cellular senescence, one of the hallmarks of ageing, is a state of irreversible cell cycle arrest that occurs in response to various genotoxic stressors and is considered an important factor in the development of many age-related diseases and therefore a potential therapeutic target. Here, the role of senescent cells in age-related diseases is discussed, focusing on their formation and main characteristics. The mechanisms leading to senescent cells are presented, including replicative and premature senescence as well as senescence that occurs in various physiological processes, such as wound healing. The second part comprises a comprehensive description of various biomarkers currently used for the detection of senescent cells along with the investigated therapeutic approaches, namely senolytics, senomorphics and the clearance of senescent cells by the immune system. Potential delivery systems suitable for such therapies and model organisms to study senescence are also briefly examined. This in-depth overview of cellular senescence contributes to a deeper understanding of a rapidly evolving area aimed to tackle the age-related diseases in a more mechanistic way, as well as highlights future research opportunities.","Prašnikar, Eva; Borišek, Jure; Perdih, Andrej",Ageing research reviews,267,1

Roughly, the ODE dynamics of these models contains only linear terms, with the exception of products between x and y terms. It has long been noticed that the reproduction number R has a very simple Formula in terms of the matrices which define the model, and an explicit first integral Formula is also available. These results can be traced back at least to Arino, Brauer, van den Driessche, Watmough, and Wu (2007) and to Feng (2007), respectively, and may be viewed as the “basic laws of SIR-type epidemics”. However, many papers continue to reprove them in particular instances. This motivated us to redraw attention to these basic laws and provide a self-contained reference of related formulas for (x,y,z) models. For the case of one susceptible class, we propose to use the name SIR-PH, due to a simple probabilistic interpretation as SIR models where the exponential infection time has been replaced by a PH-type distribution. Note that to each SIR-PH model, one may associate a scalar quantity Y(t) which satisfies “classic SIR relations”,which may be useful to obtain approximate control policies.","Avram, Florin Rim Adenane Ketcheson David I.",Mathematics,267,1

Global certification schemes, like FSC and PEFC, based on some preventive provisions in their procedural frame, developed new approaches and derogations to maintain quality evaluation and the power of standards. Arising from COVID-19 restrictions, postponed audits (and the extension of the validity of existing certifications) or remote auditing became increasingly common. Based on a survey applied to companies that had CoC FSC audits in 2020, this study aimed at evaluating the perceptions of companies regarding the audits performed under COVID pandemic procedural derogations, along with other research objectives like the continuous investigation of certification drivers or advantages. Companies indicated that the certification bodies explained the characteristics of pandemic-adapted audits and conducted risk assessments before choosing the adapted approach. Almost half of the companies perceived significant differences between the on-site previous audits and the audits performed during the pandemic due to the imposed restrictions and adapted approaches. Additionally, companies found that hybrid or remote audits are not so efficient, and for the future on-site audits are preferred. The study concluded that making the auditing procedures less interactional is not yet a sufficiently mature approach;there is a clear need for better procedures, building online tools usage capacity, to better communicate the specificity of such procedures better, and to better balance the online evaluations with on-site assessments.","Nicorescu, Adelin-Ionuț Hălălișan Aureliu-Florin Popa Bogdan Neykov Nikolay",Forests,267,12

Employees were offered weekly tests free of charge and on a voluntary basis. If tested positive, they were required to self-isolate for ten days and their contacts were subjected to daily testing at work. Thereby, the quarantine of contact persons could be waved. Here, we evaluate the effects of the testing program on the tested cohorts. We examined 121'364 test results from 27'514 participants during February-March 2021. By distinguishing different cohorts of employees, we observe a noticeable decrease in the test positivity rate and a statistically significant reduction in the associated incidence rate over the considered period. The reduction in the latter ranges between 18%-50%. The variability is partly explained by different exposures to exogenous infection sources (e.g., contacts with visiting tourists or cross-border commuters). Our analysis provides the first empirical evidence that applying repetitive mass testing to a real population over an extended period of time can prevent spread of COVID-19 pandemic.

The abrupt shift to online education presented significant challenges to teachers and learners alike. Uncovering students' perceptions of their online education experience will help address and deal with these challenges. This study attempted to explore the perceptions of Saudi female undergraduate students of their online education experience amid the COVID-19 pandemic. The total of 241 female students at the College of Languages and Translation at King Saud University in Riyadh answered a multi-item online survey. The results revealed that many of the respondents were happy with their online learning experience, enjoyed learning online and looked forward to their online classes. However, when asked to compare online learning to brick-and-mortar classes, more than half of the participants stated that they prefer traditional, face-to-face learning. The results of this study also revealed that the significant problems students faced in online education related to staying motivated, technical issues and the absence of face-to-face interaction. Despite the many challenges they face when learning online, the most cited advantage for online education mentioned by the participants is that it is more convenient.

New imaging modalities, probes, and analysis tools appear every few months and often prove decisive for enabling new directions in scientific discovery. One feature of this dynamic field is the need to capture new types of data and data structures. While there is a strong drive to make scientific data Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reproducible (FAIR 1), the rapid rate of innovation in imaging impedes the unification and adoption of standardized data formats. Despite this, the opportunities for sharing and integrating bioimaging data and, in particular, linking these data to other “omics” datasets have never been greater. Therefore, to every extent possible, increasing “FAIRness” of bioimaging data is critical for maximizing scientific value, as well as for promoting openness and integrity. In the absence of a common, FAIR format, two approaches have emerged to provide access to bioimaging data: translation and conversion. On-the-fly translation produces a transient representation of bioimage metadata and binary data but must be repeated on each use. In contrast, conversion produces a permanent copy of the data, ideally in an open format that makes the data more accessible and improves performance and parallelization in reads and writes. Both approaches have been implemented successfully in the bioimaging community but both have limitations. At cloud-scale, those shortcomings limit scientific analysis and the sharing of results.

Consequently, ongoing research has focused on better understanding the mechanisms underlying the symptoms of this disease. Although COVID-19 symptoms span a range of organ systems, the specific changes in gene regulation that lead to the variety of symptoms are still unclear. In our study, we used publicly available transcriptome data from previous studies on SARS-CoV-2 to identify commonly regulated genes across cardiomyocytes, human bronchial epithelial cells, alveolar type II cells, lung adenocarcinoma, human embryonic kidney cells, and patient samples. Additionally, using this common “core” transcriptome, we could identify the genes that were specifically and uniquely regulated in bronchial epithelial cells, embryonic kidney cells, or cardiomyocytes. For example, we found that genes related to cell metabolism were uniquely upregulated in kidney cells, providing us with the first mechanistic clue about specifically how kidney cells may be affected by SARS-CoV-2. Overall, our results uncover connections between the differential gene regulation in various cell types in response to the SARS-CoV-2 infection and help identify targets of potential therapeutics.","Nour, Elanood Tageldin; Tran, Ryan; Afravi, Ayda; Pei, Xinyue; Davidian, Angela; Kadandale, Pavan",bioRxiv,267,1

Interventions: All masks were reprocessed using a medical autoclave (34-minute total cycle time of steam sterilization, with 17 minutes at 121 degrees Celsius) and subsequently tested up to 3 times whether these decontaminated respirators retained their integrity (seal check, pressure drop) and ability to filter small particles (0.3-5.0 microns) in the laboratory using a particle penetration test. Results: We tested 32 respirators, and 63 samples for filter capacity. All 27 FFP-2 respirators retained their shape, whereas half of the sterilized FFP-3 respirators (Safe Worker 1116) showed deformities and failed the seal check. The filtering capacity of the 3M Aura 1862 was best retained after 1, 2, and 3 sterilization cycles (0.3 microns: 99.3+/-0.3% (new) versus 97.0+/-1.3, 94.2+/-1.3% or 94.4+/-1.6, p<0.001).

Only 2% of educators are trained to support these vulnerable students. Social robots show promise for language acquisition and may provide valuable support for students, especially as we return to needing smaller classes due to COVID-19. While cultural responsiveness increases gains for ELLs, little is known about the design of culturally responsive child-robot interactions. Method: Therefore, using a participatory design approach, we conducted an exploratory study with 24 Spanish-speaking ELLs at a Pacific Northwest elementary school. As cultural informants, students participated in a 15-min, robot-led, small group story discussion followed by a post-interaction feedback session. We then conducted reflexive critiques with six ELL teachers who reviewed the group interactions to provide further interpretation on design feature possibilities and potential interactions with the robot. Results: Students found the social robot engaging, but many were hesitant to converse with the robot. During post-interaction dialogue students articulated the specific ways in which the social robot appearance and behavior could be modified to help them feel more comfortable. Teachers postulated that the social robot could be designed to engage students in peer-to-peer conversations. Teachers also recognized the ELLs verbosity when discussing their experiences with the robot and suggested such interactions could stimulate responsiveness from students. Conclusion: Cultural responsiveness is a key component to successful education in ELLs. However, integrating appropriate, cultural responsiveness into robot interactions may require participants as cultural informants to ensure the robot behaviors and interactions are situated in that educational community. Utilizing a participatory approach to engage ELLs in design decisions for social robots is a promising way to gather culturally responsive requirements to inform successful child-robot interactions.","Bjorling, E.

Moreover, 97% of the participants used masks for prevention of airborne diseases, while 65.3% of the participants reused the same mask for several days. In addition, 50% of the participants were not satisfied with the government support. Future viral epidemics can be prevented by disseminating advanced knowledge and awareness among general public.","Saeed, U.; Piracha, Z. Z.; Uppal, S.

Single-centre pilot study aimed to analyse the coexistence of antiphospholipid antibodies and thrombotic events on SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. Antiphospholipid antibodies were measured by solid phase enzyme immunoassay. Clinical data were collected from electronic history and clinical records. Over 25 patients studied we report four cases of COVID-19 patients who presented circulating antiphospholipid antibodies and arterial or venous thrombotic events. No patient had a previous history of thrombosis. Two cases presented with pulmonary embolism, one with pulmonary embolism and pulmonary infarction and one with a stroke. All of them showed positive anti-cardiolipin antibodies. One patient died and three were discharged. The presence of antiphospholipid antibodies in these patients might represent an epiphenomenon secondary to the immune stimulation by the virus. It could be reasonable to consider measuring antiphospholipid antibodies as part of the study of a thrombotic event in COVID-19 patients to better understand the impact of these antibodies in the development of thrombotic events and we highlight the value of a periodic determination to define the need of long-term anticoagulant therapy.","Rita, C.

While Bluetooth-based contact tracing method using phones has become popular recently, these approaches suffer from the need for a critical mass adoption to be effective. In this paper, we present WiFiTrace, a network-centric approach for contact tracing that relies on passive WiFi sensing with no client-side involvement. Our approach exploits WiFi network logs gathered by enterprise networks for performance and security monitoring, and utilizes them for reconstructing device trajectories for contact tracing. Our approach is specifically designed to enhance the efficacy of traditional methods, rather than to supplant them with new technology. We designed an efficient graph algorithm to scale our approach to large networks with tens of thousands of users. The graph-based approach outperforms an indexed PostgresSQL in memory by at least 4.5X without any index update overheads or blocking. We have implemented a full prototype of our system and deployed it on two large university campuses. We validated our approach and demonstrate its efficacy using case studies and detailed experiments using real-world WiFi datasets.","Trivedi, Amee; Zakaria, Camellia; Balan, Rajesh; Shenoy, Prashant",,267,19

This study, aimed to evaluate the relationship between IG and SS, as a new inflammatory marker in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS). METHODS: Patients aged >18 years who were diagnosed with ACS in the emergency department were included in this study, which was planned as a cross-sectional study. Patients were divided into two groups of patients with high and low SSs according to coronary angiography results. Demographic and laboratory parameters were compared between the groups. RESULTS: Our study consisted of 78 patients diagnosed with ACS, who met the inclusion criteria. The average age of the study group was 59 years, and 67.9% of the patients were male. 21 patients (26.9%) had high SSs and 57 patients (73.1%) had low SSs. Mean IG% was significantly higher in high SS group compared to low SS group (0.71±0.25 vs 0.44±0.21 mg/dl, p<0.001). IG% can present a high SS with 76.2% sensitivity and 75.4% specificity at a cut-off value of 0.7. CONCLUSION: IG was significantly higher in ACS patients with high SSs. It seems that IG can be used as a parameter, which is quickly accessible and cheap, in order to predict high SS in ACS patients in daily clinical practice.","Bedel, Cihan; Korkut, Mustafa; Aksoy, Fatih; Kuş, Görkem",Arch Acad Emerg Med,267,1

METHODS A retrospective nursing method was implemented. A total of 280 cases of patients were diagnosed with coronavirus pneumonia in the isolation ward of our hospital. The 280 cases of newly diagnosed pneumonia were divided into two groups: the nursing crisis management system group (n=150, the nursing crisis management was given) and the non-nursing crisis management system (n=130, routine nursing management was given). The psychological status (profile of mood states (POMS) score) of nursing staff before and after the implementation of the nursing crisis management, the psychological status of patients after the implementation of nursing crisis management (POMS score), emotion, cognition, behavior severity, patients' satisfaction with nursing, treatment compliance (Morisky Medication Compliance Scale (MMAS) score) of patients, the rate of cure of patients and the infection rate of nursing staff were compared. RESULTS Compared with the non-nursing crisis management system group, the POMS scores of patients and nurses in the nursing crisis management system group decreased (all P<0.05). Compared with the non-nursing crisis management system group, the emotional, cognitive and behavioral scores of patients in the nursing crisis management system group were lower, while the MMAS score, satisfaction with nursing and cure rate were significantly increased (all P<0.05). The 142 nursing staff did not catch coronavirus. CONCLUSION During the novel coronavirus pneumonia outbreak and the current normal epidemic prevention and control periods, our crisis management mode was introduced into nursing work. The construction of the nursing crisis management mode under the epidemic situation can improve the psychological state and improve the management efficiency of the patients and nurses.

OBJECTIVES This article describes a semi-structured literature review of the use of face coverings to prevent the spread of coronaviruses and similar respiratory pathogens, with a focus on SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19). METHODS : The author conducted a semi-structured literature review using search terms ""COVID19"" or ""SARS-CoV-2"" crossed with ""mask/s"" or ""face covering/s."" Articles were evaluated through October 30, 2020 for inclusion, as were key references cited within the primary references and other references identified through traditional and social media outlets. RESULTS There is strong evidence to support the community use of face coverings to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 from various laboratory, epidemiological, natural history, clinical, and economic studies, although there was only 1 high-quality published randomized controlled trial of this topic at the time of review. CONCLUSIONS The evidence in favor of community face coverings to slow the spread of COVID-19 is strong. Although most of the benefit of wearing a face covering is conferred to the community and to bystanders, a face covering also can protect the wearer to some extent, both by reducing the risk of COVID-19 infection, and perhaps by reducing the severity of illness for those who contract a COVID-19 infection.","Raymond, John R",WMJ : official publication of the State Medical Society of Wisconsin,267,30

However, stigma and 'a culture of shame' are formidable barriers to mental health services and consequently many doctors and medical students with mental health difficulties continue to suffer in silence despite the availability of effective treatment. Indeed, a recent study on over 2100 female physicians who met the diagnostic criteria for a mental disorder revealed that 50% were reluctant to seek professional help due to fear of exposure to stigma. Left untreated or undertreated, mental health problems in doctors can result in impairment of occupational functioning, compromise patient safety and place considerable strain on the economy (by increasing the amount of sick leave taken). Moreover, the consequences of mental health stigma in the medical profession can be fatal. Dr Daksha Emson, a psychiatrist with bipolar affective disorder, tragically killed herself and her baby daughter during a psychotic episode. An independent inquiry into Dr Emson's death concluded that she was the victim of stigma in the National Health Service. The mental health of medical students and doctors, in all of its aspects, must therefore be addressed with the urgency that it demands. Stephanie Knaak and colleagues conducted a data synthesis of evaluative studies on anti-stigma programmes for healthcare providers and identified six key ingredients one of which was a personal testimony from a trained speaker who has lived experience of mental illness.

MERS-CoV has been shown to spread between people who are in close contact. Transmission from infected patients to healthcare personnel has also been observed and is irredeemable with present technology. Genetic studies on MERS-CoV have shown that ORF 1ab encodes replicase polyproteins and play a foremost role in viral infection. Therefore, ORF 1ab replicase polyprotein may be used as suitable target for disease control. Viral activity can be controlled by RNA interference (RNAi) technology, a leading method for post transcriptional gene silencing in a sequence specific manner. However, there is a genetic inconsistency in different viral isolates; it is a great challenge to design potential RNAi (miRNA and siRNA) molecules which can silence the respective target genes rather than any other viral gene simultaneously. In current study four effective miRNA and five siRNA molecules for silencing of nine different strains of MERS-CoV were rationally designed and corroborated using computational methods, which might lead to knockdown the activity of virus. siRNA and miRNA molecules were predicted against ORF1ab gene of different strains of MERS-CoV as effective candidate using computational methods. Thus, this method may provide an insight for the chemical synthesis of antiviral RNA molecule for the treatment of MERS-CoV, at genomic level.","Nur, Suza Mohammad; Hasan, Md Anayet; Amin, Mohammad Al; Hossain, Mehjabeen; Sharmin, Tahmina","Interdisciplinary sciences, computational life sciences",267,17

Between 5% and 10% of AtT20 cells are susceptible to the infection. Unlike infections of fibroblastic sac- and 17Cl 1 cells, the infection of AtT20 cells does not lead to cell fusion, despite the production of the fusogenic E2 viral spike glycoprotein. Within infected AtT20 cells the second viral envelope glycoprotein, E1, is located in a perinuclear region; at least until very late in the infection it fails to accumulate to detectable levels in the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER). By contrast to infection of sac- and 17Cl 1 cells, where the RER is a major site of assembly of progeny virions, in AtT20 cells budding of progeny virions is restricted to the Golgi cisternae, which eventually vesiculate, and peri-Golgi smooth membraned vesicles. Apparently, therefore, the intracellular compartments into which wild-type MHV-A59 buds are determined not by the virus but by the host cells. MHV-A59 infected cultures of AtT20 cells can be serially passaged without loss of the infection or increase in the proportion of infected cells; they become persistently infected carrier cultures. The progeny virus from serially passaged, infected AtT20 cells is apparently wild-type. It infects sac- cells and induces them to form syncitia. Within the sac- syncitia the viral E1 glycoprotein accumulates in the RER and many virions assemble there.","Tooze, J; Tooze, S A",European journal of cell biology,267,33

Any factors that contribute to increase the risk of AL should be identified and--if possible--eliminated. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are often used for treating pain after surgical procedures, among these also colorectal resections. The objective of this Ph.d. thesis was to investigate whether the use of NSAIDs in the postoperative period increases the risk of AL, and investigate the effect on pathophysiological mechanisms. In order to achieve this, the following studies were performed. Study I was a retrospective, case-control study in 75 patients undergoing laparoscopic colorectal resection for colorectal cancer. 33 of these patients received the NSAID diclofenac in the postoperative period; the remaining 42 did not receive any NSAID. There were significantly more ALs among the patients receiving diclofenac (7/33 vs. 1/42, p=0.018). In uni- and multivariate logistic regression analyses, diclofenac was the only factor associated with increased AL rate. This study functioned as a hypothesis generating study and laid the ground for the subsequent studies. Study II was an experimental, randomized, case-control study in 32 Wistar rats. The rats had a colonic anastomosis performed and were randomized to diclofenac or placebo treatment. After three days, the rats were sacrificed and the anastomoses were harvested. First, the anastomotic strengths were tested by longitudinal; subsequently, the levels of the enzyme cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) in the anastomotic tissues were measured. There was no difference among the groups with regard to anastomotic strength, but the animals treated with diclofenac had significantly lower COX-2 levels (median (range) 1.30 (0.42-3.31) ng/mg vs. 2.44 (0.88 - 18.94) ng/mg, p<0.001). This study showed that the used dose of diclofenac was sufficient and relevant, but did not show a direct damaging effect on the anastomoses due to NSAID treatment. Study III was also an experimental, randomized, case-control study. This time round, 60 Wistar rats were included. Again, colonic anastomoses were performed and the rats were randomized to diclofenac or placebo. Also, expanded polytetrafluoruethylene (ePTFE) tubes were placed under the skin of the rats. In this material, substituents of connective tissue accumulate and the amount of accumulation can be measured. After 7 days, the rats were sacrificed and, again, anastomotic strengths were measured along with collagen content in the ePTFE tubes. Anastomotic strength was similar in the two groups while collagen accumulation was significantly decreased among the rats treated with diclofenac (median (i.q.r.) 0.29 (0.13-0.47) vs. 0.47 (0.28-0.62) mcg/mg, p = 0.03). This study for the first time showed that NSAID inhibit subcutaneous collagen formation and that this formation is reversely correlated to anastomotic strength. This information can be used in further studies in this subject. Study IV was the final experimental case-control study in 40 Wistar rats. This time, in order to more easily extrapolate experimental results to daily clinical life, the colonic anastomoses were sutured with the same type of suture material as used in the clinical setting. Thus, half the anastomoses was performed with resorbable suture; the other half with non-resorbable suture. None of the rats received NSAID. The breaking strength was compared and found similar in the two groups. This study showed that experimental studies can be optimized in order to make comparisons and extrapolations to the clinical setting easier. Study V was a database study based on data from the Danish Colorectal Cancer Group's (DCCG) prospective database and electronically registered medical records. From the database information on demographic, surgical and postoperative variables (including AL) were provided. Information on NSAID consumption was retrieved by individual searches in the patients' medical records. Based on these data, uni- and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed. These analyses identified NSAID treatment in the postoperative period as an individual risk factor for AL. Other risk factors identified were consistent with the available literature. The detrimental effect of the NSAIDs are possibly due to an effect on collagen metabolism leading to weakened tissue around the anastomosis and/or on the risk of thrombosis formation leading to more thromboses in the vessels supplying the anastomosis, thereby limiting anastomotic blood flow. In conclusion, the studies included in this thesis have elucidated some of the physiological and pathophysiological mechanisms involved in anastomotic healing and leakage, and furthermore have shown that the use of NSAIDs in the postoperative period increase the risk of AL in patients undergoing colorectal surgery with primary anastomosis. Based on the findings in these studies, and based on existing knowledge, it is recommended that NSAIDs be abandoned after colorectal resection with primary anastomosis. It should be investigated whether the NSAIDs are also harmful to other types of anastomoses and after other surgical procedures where early tissue healing is crucial.","Klein, Mads",Danish medical journal,267,1

During this process, a pivotal event that influences the outcome of viral infection is the production of high levels of type I interferon by pDCs. In particular, recent research findings showed that pDCs not only shape the nature of innate resistance, but are also responsible for the successful transition from innate to adaptive immunity for viral resistance. In addition, pDCs can differentiate into antigen presenting cells that may regulate tolerance to a given pathogen.

To view these forces as independent, singular, linearly deterministic entities of globalisation is irrational and illogical. Understanding the concept of globalisation has significant implications not only for world health and international politics, but also the health of individuals. Depending on an individual's political stance and world-view, globalisation may be perceived as an emancipatory force, having the potential to bridge the chasm between rich and poor or, in stark contrast, the very essence of the divide. It is important that nurses appreciate that globalisation does not pertain solely to the realms of economic theory and world politics, but also that it impacts on our daily nursing practice and the welfare of our patients. Globalisation and the closer interactions of human activity that result, have implications for international governance, policy and theory development as well as nursing education, research and clinical practice. Nurses, individually and collectively, have the political power and social consciousness to influence the forces of globalisation to improve health for all.

From 8 hours post infection (h.p.i.) we see in thin sections pairs of cisternae closely, stably and uniformly aligned. Serial sectioning shows that the regions of pairing or lamination extend for many thousands of nm in two dimensions, with the spacing between the juxtaposed membranes remaining very uniform at about 18 nm. These structures appear coincident with the onset of accumulation of the viral glycoprotein E1 in the RER membrane but 2 hours after the viral glycoprotein E2 can first be detected there. Ribosomes are excluded from the paired cisternal surfaces, while budding of progeny virions has never been seen at the cisternal membranes facing the cytosol, although ribosomes bind there. The lumina of paired cixternae are usually devoid of virions which, however, accumulate in areas where the paired cisternae diverge. Electron immunocytochemistry shows that both E1 and E2 glycoproteins are abundant in the paired cisternae. Following labelling for the E1 glycoprotein we see a periodic fine structure, rows of ""beads"" with a centre to centre spacing of about 7.5 nm, in the region between the paired membranes. In oblique sections of this region in cells fixed as if for the immunoperoxidase labelling, but omitting all its steps we see parallel rows of ""beads"" separated by about 7 nm.

The mutated S protein was stably expressed in DBT cells and, in contrast to the wild-type protein, was not proteolytically cleaved. Nevertheless, the non-cleaved protein induced extensive syncytium formation. These results clearly indicate that the non-cleaved form of the MHV S protein is able to mediate cell membrane fusion.

It is evident that the poultry gut viral community remains minimally characterized and incompletely understood. Investigations into the microbiome of the poultry gut have provided some insight into the geographical distribution and the rapidly evolving taxonomy of the avian enteric picornaviruses. The present investigation was undertaken to produce a comparative metagenomic analysis of the gut virome from a healthy turkey flock versus a flock placed in the field. This investigation revealed a number of enteric picornavirus sequences that were present in the commercial birds in the field that were completely absent in the healthy flock. A novel molecular diagnostic assay was used to track the shedding of field strains of turkey enteric picornavirus in commercial poults inoculated with picornavirus-positive intestinal homogenates prepared from turkeys that were experiencing moderate enteric disease. The propagation of this novel enteric picornavirus in commercial poults resulted in significant reduction in weight gain, and suggests that this common inhabitant of the turkey gut may result in performance problems or enteric disease in the field.","Day, J Michael; Zsak, Laszlo",Avian diseases,267,7

RESULTS Patients with SARS showing severe psychological symptoms constituted about 41% (group I) and patients with SARS showing mild psychological symptoms (group II) constituted about 59%. There were no change of the psychological symptoms at the three stages in group I and II (P > 0.05). Statistical differences were found between physical parameters of group I and II in rehabilitating stage. CONCLUSIONS Severe psychological symptoms such as obsession, depression and anxiety were found in a minority of patients with SARS and the psychological symptoms were not related with the change of physical parameters. The majority of the patients with SARS did not have severe psychological symptoms.

This study investigated the key features of BAL fluids from COVID-19 patients and assessed their clinical significance. A total of 320 BAL samples from 83 COVID-19 patients and 70 non-COVID-19 patients (27 patients with other respiratory viral infections) were evaluated, including cell count/differential, morphology, flow cytometric immunophenotyping, and immunohistochemistry. The findings were correlated with clinical outcomes. Compared to non-COVID-19 patients, BAL from COVID-19 patients was characterized by significant lymphocytosis (p < 0.001), in contrast to peripheral blood lymphopenia commonly observed in COVID-19 patients and the presence of atypical lymphocytes with plasmacytoid/plasmablastic features (p < 0.001). Flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry demonstrated that BAL lymphocytes, including plasmacytoid and plasmablastic cells, were composed predominantly of T cells with a mixture of CD4+ and CD8+ cells. Both populations had increased expression of T-cell activation markers, suggesting important roles of helper and cytotoxic T-cells in the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection in the lung. More importantly, BAL lymphocytosis was significantly associated with longer hospital stay (p < 0.05) and longer requirement for mechanical ventilation (p < 0.05), whereas the median atypical (activated) lymphocyte count was associated with shorter hospital stay (p < 0.05), shorter time on mechanical ventilation (p < 0.05) and improved survival.

We aimed to determine the clinical characteristics of neurological manifestations in COVID-19. METHOD: A systematic review of studies reporting neurological manifestations published between 1 December, 2019 and 11 May, 2020 was performed. Studies were grouped based on neurological manifestation. Pooled analyses of individual patient's clinical characteristics and olfactory and gustatory dysfunction prevalence were performed. RESULTS: Of 486 studies identified, 48 were included. 70 patients with 73 neurological manifestations were reported. 39 (53.4%) patients had stroke, 18 (24.7%) had Guillain-Barré syndrome and variants, 11 (15.1%) had meningitis, encephalitis, encephalopathy, or myelitis, and five (6.8%) had seizures. They had a mean age of 61.9 ± 17.7 years (60.6% male). Neurological disease occurred 8.1 ± 6.8 days from initial symptoms. Average mortality rate was 17.8%. Stroke has a mortality rate of 25.6%.

For that purpose, sequences are preprocessed by feature extraction and the resulting feature vectors are analyzed by prototype-based classification to remain interpretable. In particular, we propose to use variants of learning vector quantization (LVQ) based on dissimilarity measures for RNA sequence data. The respective matrix LVQ provides additional knowledge about the classification decisions like discriminant feature correlations and, additionally, can be equipped with easy to realize reject options for uncertain data. Those options provide self-controlled evidence, i.e., the model refuses to make a classification decision if the model evidence for the presented data is not sufficient. This model is first trained using a GISAID dataset with given virus types detected according to the molecular differences in coronavirus populations by phylogenetic tree clustering. In a second step, we apply the trained model to another but unlabeled SARS-CoV-2 virus dataset. For these data, we can either assign a virus type to the sequences or reject atypical samples. Those rejected sequences allow to speculate about new virus types with respect to nucleotide base mutations in the viral sequences. Moreover, this rejection analysis improves model robustness. Last but not least, the presented approach has lower computational complexity compared to methods based on (multiple) sequence alignment.

METHODS: A prospective longitudinal multicenter study was conducted in 14 hospitals in Sweden. Two-hundred-and-thirty-five women with EC were included; 116 underwent surgery that included lymphadenectomy (+LA) and 119 were without lymphadenectomy (-LA). Lymphedema was assessed objectively on four occasions; preoperatively, at 4-6 weeks, six months and one year postoperatively using systematic measurement of leg circumferences, enabling calculation of leg volumes, and a clinical grading of LLL, and subjectively by the patient's perception of lymphedema measured by a lymphedema-specific quality-of-life instrument. Lymphocyst was evaluated by vaginal ultrasonography. RESULTS: After one year the incidence of LLL after increase in leg volume adjusted for body mass index was 15.8% in +LA women and 3.4% in -LA women. The corresponding figures for clinical grading were 24.1% and 11.8%, and for patient-reported perceived LLL 10.7% and 5.1%. The agreement between the modalities revealed fair to moderate correlation between patient-reported LLL and clinical grading, but poor agreement between volume increase and patient-reported LLL or clinical grading. Lymphocysts were found in 4.3% after one year. CONCLUSIONS: Although the incidence of LLL and lymphocysts after surgery for EC including LA seemed to be relatively high the study demonstrated significant variations in incidence depending on the measurement modality. This emphasizes the need for a 'gold standard' of measurement of LLL in clinical practice and research.","Wedin, Madelene; Stålberg, Karin; Marcickiewicz, Janusz; Ahlner, Eva; Åkesson, Åsa; Lindahl, Gabriel; Kjølhede, Preben",Gynecol. oncol,267,16

Treating neurosurgical patients with the restrictions imposed by the pandemic is challenging in institutions with shared patient areas. The present study was performed to assess the changing patterns of neurosurgical cases, the efficacy of repeated testing before surgery, and the prevalence of COVID-19 in asymptomatic neurosurgical inpatients. METHODS: Cases of non-trauma-related neurosurgical patients treated at the Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER) before and during the COVID-19 pandemic were reviewed. During the pandemic, all patients underwent a nasopharyngeal swab reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction test to detect COVID-19 at admission. Patients who needed immediate intervention were surgically treated following a single COVID-19 test, while stable patients who initially tested negative for COVID-19 were subjected to repeated testing at least 5 days after the first test and within 48 hours prior to the planned surgery. The COVID-19 positivity rate was compared with the local period prevalence. The number of patients who tested positive at the second test, following a negative first test, was used to determine the probable number of people who could have become infected during the surgical procedure without second testing. RESULTS: Of the total 1769 non-trauma-related neurosurgical patients included in this study, a mean of 337.2 patients underwent surgery per month before COVID-19, while a mean of 184.2 patients (54.6% of pre-COVID-19 capacity) underwent surgery per month during the pandemic period, when COVID-19 cases were on the rise in India. There was a significant increase in the proportion of patients undergoing surgery for a ruptured aneurysm, stroke, hydrocephalus, and cerebellar tumors, while the number of patients seeking surgery for chronic benign diseases declined. At the first COVID-19 test, 4 patients (0.48%) tested were found to have the disease, a proportion 3.7 times greater than that found in the local community. An additional 5 patients tested positive at the time of the second COVID-19 test, resulting in an overall inpatient period prevalence of 1%, in contrast to a 0.2% national cumulative caseload. It is possible that COVID-19 was prevented in approximately 67.4 people every month by using double testing. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 has changed the pattern of neurosurgical procedures, with acute cases dominating the practice. Despite the fact that the pandemic has not yet reached its peak in India, COVID-19 has been detected 3.7 times more often in asymptomatic neurosurgical inpatients than in the local community, even with single testing. Double testing displays an incremental value by disclosing COVID-19 overall in 1 in 100 inpatients and thus averting its spread through neurosurgical services.","Sahoo, Sushanta K; Dhandapani, Sivashanmugam; Singh, Apinderpreet; Gendle, Chandrashekhar; Karthigeyan, Madhivanan; Salunke, Pravin; Aggarwal, Ashish; Singla, Navneet; Singla, Raghav; Tripathi, Manjul; Chhabra, Rajesh; Mohindra, Sandeep; Tewari, Manoj Kumar; Mohanty, Manju; Bhagat, Hemant; Chakrabarti, Arunaloke; Gupta, Sunil Kumar",Neurosurg Focus,267,32

Specific clinical airway guidelines were endorsed in March 2020 by the Australian and New Zealand Intensive Care Society (ANZICS) and College of Intensive Care Medicine (CICM). METHODS AND FINDINGS: Prospective, structured questionnaire for all ICU directors in Australia and New Zealand was completed by 69 ICU directors after email invitation from ANZICS. The online questionnaire was accessible for three weeks during September 2020 and analysed by cloud-based software. Basic ICU demographics (private or public, metropolitan or rural) and location, purchasing, airway management practices, guideline uptake, checklist and cognitive aid use and staff training relevant to airway management during the COVID-19 pandemic were the main outcome measures. The 69 ICU directors reported significant simulation-based inter-professional airway training of staff (97%), and use of video laryngoscopy (94%), intubation checklists (94%), cognitive aids (83%) and PPE ""spotters"" (89%) during the airway management of patients with COVID-19. Tracheal intubation was almost always performed by a Specialist (97% of ICUs), who was more likely to be an intensivist than an anaesthetist (61% vs 36%). There was a more frequent adoption of specific airway guidelines for the management of COVID-19 patients in public ICUs (94% vs 71%) and reliance on specialist intensivists to perform intubations in private ICUs (92% vs 53%). CONCLUSION: There was a high uptake of a standardised approach to airway management in COVID-19 patients in ICUs in Australia and New Zealand, likely due to endorsement of national guidelines.","Brewster, David J; Nickson, Christopher P; McGloughlin, Steve; Pilcher, David; Sarode, Vineet V; Gatward, Jonathan J",PLoS One,267,26

SARS-CoV-2 is a highly contagious Coronavirus, which has led to an outbreak of acute respiratory tract infection called ""Coronavirus disease 2019"" (COVID-19), resulting in mild to severe respiratory infections in humans. The design of appropriate therapeutic approaches is dependent on the understanding of molecular and cellular pathways of Coronavirus infections. In this study, we summarized the characteristic features of SARS-CoV-2.

Many cyanobacteria taxa may produce microcystins, a group of toxic cyclic heptapeptides. Understanding the relationships between the abiotic drivers of microcystins and their occurrence would assist in the implementation of targeted, cost-effective solutions to maintain safe drinking and recreational waters. Cyanobacteria and microcystins were measured by flow cytometry and liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry in two interconnected reservoirs varying in age and management regimes, in southern Britain over a 12-month period. Microcystins were detected in both reservoirs, with significantly higher concentrations in the southern lake (maximum concentration >7 µg L-1). Elevated microcystin concentrations were not positively correlated with numbers of cyanobacterial cells, but multiple linear regression analysis suggested temperature and dissolved oxygen explained a significant amount of the variability in microcystin across both reservoirs. The presence of a managed fishery in one lake was associated with decreased microcystin levels, suggestive of top down control on cyanobacterial populations. This study supports the need to develop inclusive, multifactor holistic water management strategies to control cyanobacterial risks in freshwater bodies.","Hartnell, David M; Chapman, Ian J; Taylor, Nick G H; Esteban, Genoveva F; Turner, Andrew D; Franklin, Daniel J",Toxins (Basel),267,10

METHODS: A population-representative sample of 4011 Hong Kong Chinese residents aged 15 years or older were recruited between February and May 2020. Respondents reported current anxiety and depressive symptoms, unrest stress, COVID-19 stress, assets (savings and home ownership), and demographics. RESULTS: Stress due to unrest and COVID-19 was associated with higher prevalence of probable anxiety and depression; persons with both stressors had higher prevalence. This pattern was consistent among persons with low or high assets, but the probabilities of mental disorder were substantially higher among persons with fewer assets. CONCLUSIONS: The effect of stressors on probable anxiety and depression are cumulative: persons with stress due to civil unrest and to COVID-19 reported more mental disorders than persons with stress due to only one, or none of these factors. Overall high assets appear to buffer the consequences of stressors, lowering the risk of mental disorder.","Hou, Wai Kai; Lee, Tatia Mei-Chun; Liang, Li; Li, Tsz Wai; Liu, Huinan; Ettman, Catherine K; Galea, Sandro",Soc. psychiatr. psychiatr. epidemiol,267,1

A subset of these patients developed refractory hypoxaemia despite maximal conventional mechanical ventilation and required extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). This review focuses on considerations for ventilatory strategies, infection control and patient selection related to ECMO for ARDS in a pandemic. We also summarise the experiences with ECMO in previous respiratory pandemics. METHODS: A review of pertinent studies was conducted via a search using MEDLINE, EMBASE and Google Scholar. References of articles were also examined to identify other relevant publications. RESULTS: Since the H1N1 Influenza pandemic in 2009, the use of ECMO for ARDS continues to grow despite limitations in evidence for survival benefit. There is emerging evidence to suggest that lung protective ventilation for ARDS can be further optimised while receiving ECMO so as to minimise ventilator-induced lung injury and subsequent contributions to multi-organ failure. Efforts to improve outcomes should also encompass appropriate infection control measures to reduce co-infections and prevent nosocomial transmission of novel respiratory viruses. Patient selection for ECMO in a pandemic can be challenging. We discuss important ethical considerations and predictive scoring systems that may assist clinical decision-making to optimise resource allocation. CONCLUSION: The role of ECMO in managing ARDS during respiratory pandemics continues to grow. This is supported by efforts to redefine optimal ventilatory strategies, reinforce infection control measures and enhance patient selection.","Lim, Joel Kian Boon; Qadri, Syeda Kashfi; Toh, Theresa Shu Wen; Lin, Cheryl Bin; Mok, Yee Hui; Lee, Jan Hau",Ann Acad Med Singap,267,1

However, acceptance of vaccination against COVID-19 among HCWs has not been universal and emergence of new variants with increased transmissibility, reduced neutralization by BNT162b2 vaccine-elicited sera and ability to cause breakthrough infections in vaccinated individuals is concerning. The aim of this study was to compare viral load, clinical presentation at diagnosis and type of exposure among vaccinated (with BNT162b2) and non-vaccinated healthcare workers (HCWs). METHODS: Prospective cohort of HWCs diagnosed with COVID-19 by nasopharyngeal PCR from 4 January to 14 April. Viral loads were expressed by the cycle threshold (Ct) in PCR. RESULTS: During the study period 55 HCWs were found positive for SARS-CoV-2, most of whom (44/55) were identified from March 28 to April 14 during an in-hospital COVID-19 outbreak. Of the 55 HCWs, 21 were fully vaccinated and another three had received one dose. Most cases (54/55) were due to variant B.1.1.7. Vaccinated and unvaccinated HCWs did not differ significantly in regards to age, gender, site of acquisition, presence of symptoms at diagnosis and viral load.

There are several controversial hypotheses on the potentially harmful or beneficial effects of antihypertensive drugs acting on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Furthermore, there is accumulating evidence, based on several observational studies, that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) do not increase the risk of contracting SARS-CoV-2 infection. On the other hand, conflicting findings regarding the role of ACEIs/ARBs as prognosis modifiers in COVID-19 hospitalised patients have been reported. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this large-scale, retrospective cohort study was to investigate whether prior exposure to ACEIs and/or ARBs was associated with all-cause mortality among over 40,000 hospitalised COVID-19 patients compared with calcium channel blockers (CCBs), a potential therapeutic alternative. METHODS: This study was conducted using COVID-19 registries linked to claims databases from Lombardy, Veneto and Reggio Emilia (overall, 25% of Italian population). Overall, 42,926 patients hospitalised between 21 February and 21 April 2020 with a diagnosis of COVID-19 confirmed by real-time polymerase chain reaction tests were included in this study. All-cause mortality occurring in or out of hospital, as reported in the COVID-19 registry, was estimated. Using Cox models, adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) of all-cause mortality (along with 95% confidence intervals [CIs]) were estimated separately for ACEIs/ARBs and other antihypertensives versus CCBs and non-use. RESULTS: Overall, 11,205 in- and out-of-hospital deaths occurred over a median of 24 days of follow-up after hospital admission due to COVID-19. Compared with CCBs, adjusted analyses showed no difference in the risk of death among ACEI (HR 0.97, 95% CI 0.89-1.06) or ARB (HR 0.98, 95% CI 0.89-1.06) users. When non-use of antihypertensives was considered as a comparator, a modest statistically significant increase in mortality risk was observed for any antihypertensive use. However, when restricting to drugs with antihypertensive indications only, these marginal increases disappeared. Sensitivity and subgroup analyses confirmed our main findings. CONCLUSIONS: ACEI/ARB use is not associated with either an increased or decreased risk of all-cause mortality, compared with CCB use, in the largest cohort of hospitalised COVID-19 patients exposed to these drugs studied to date. The use of these drugs therefore does not affect the prognosis of COVID-19. This finding strengthens recommendations of international regulatory agencies about not withdrawing/switching ACEI/ARB treatments to modify COVID-19 prognosis.","Trifirò, Gianluca; Massari, Marco; Da Cas, Roberto; Menniti Ippolito, Francesca; Sultana, Janet; Crisafulli, Salvatore; Giorgi Rossi, Paolo; Marino, Massimiliano; Zorzi, Manuel; Bovo, Emanuela; Leoni, Olivia; Ludergnani, Monica; Spila Alegiani, Stefania",Drug Saf,267,26

In this study, two-year-old seedlings of two cultivars (a normal cultivar, NC, and a super cultivar, SC) were grown in two types of soil (not planted (NP) soil; continuously planted (CP) soil) with three watering regimes, and the interactive effects on plant growth and physiological traits were investigated in a greenhouse experiment. The water contents of the soil in the control (CK) (normal water content), medium water content (MWC) and low water content (LWC) treatments reached 75-80 %, 45-50 % and 20-25 % of the field water capacity, respectively. RESULTS: The results indicated that the CP soil had a negative effect on growth and physiological traits and that the LWC treatment caused even more severe and comprehensive negative effects. In both cultivars, the CP soil significantly decreased the height increment (HI), basal diameter increment (DI), dry matter accumulation (DMA), net photosynthetic rate (Pn), total chlorophyll content (TChl), carotenoid content (Caro) and photosynthetic nitrogen use efficiency (PNUE). Compared to the NP soil, the CP soil also decreased the proline and soluble protein contents, nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) and phosphorus use efficiency (PUE) and increased the nitrogen:phosphorus ratio in roots, stems and leaves. The LWC treatment decreased growth and photosynthesis, changed ecological stoichiometry, induced oxidative stress, promoted water use efficiency and damaged chloroplast ultrastructure. Significant increases in ascorbate peroxidase (APX), peroxidase (POD), soluble protein and proline contents were found in the LWC treatment. Compared with the NC, the SC was more tolerant to the CP soil and water stress, as indicated by the higher levels of DMA, Pn, and WUE. After exposure to the CP soil and watering regimes, the decreases in biomass accumulation and gas exchange were more pronounced. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of drought and CP soil may have detrimental effects on C. lanceolata growth, and low water content enhances the impacts of CP soil stress on C. lanceolata seedlings. The superiority of the SC over the NC is significant in Chinese fir plantation soil. Therefore, continuously planted soil can be utilized to cultivate improved varieties of C. lanceolata and maintain water capacity. This can improve their growth and physiological performance to a certain extent.","Bian, Fangyuan; Wang, Yukui; Duan, Baoli; Wu, Zhizhuang; Zhang, Yuanbing; Bi, Yufang; Wang, Anke; Zhong, Hao; Du, Xuhua",BMC Plant Biol,267,1

AIMS: To assess the magnitude of the psychological status and associated risk factors among nurses in the pandemic center in Wuhan, China. METHODS: In this study, we enrolled nurses from Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University. The questionnaire was designed to obtain basic information of the participants, and included four psychological assessment scales. We issued the questionnaires at two different points of time. We conducted the first survey on January 29 to February 2 (outbreak period) with 709 eligible responses, and the second survey on February 26 to February 28 (stable period) with 621 eligible responses. The nurses from Wuchang Fangcang shelter hospital were also enrolled in the second survey. RESULTS: During the pandemic, over one-third of nurses suffered from depression, anxiety, and insomnia. In the outbreak period, the nurses showed significantly higher risks for depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms than those in the stable period (P < 0.01). Notably, the nurses from the Fangcang shelter hospitals were more likely to present psychological problems than those from other frontline or non-frontline (all P < 0.001) units, especially for insomnia (38.3% with severe insomnia). The nurses from the frontline, with worse physical condition and uncertain concerns about this pandemic as compared to the others, were more likely to bear psychological problems. Thus, online psychological information and sufficient protection conditions were effective interventions to help mitigate psychological distress. The nurses from Fangcang shelter hospitals suffered a significantly higher risk of psychological problems than those from other units. CONCLUSION: The psychological status of nurses needs more attention during the COVID-19 pandemic, especially for those who fought in the frontline during the peak of the outbreak.","Cai, Zhongxiang; Cui, Qin; Liu, Zhongchun; Li, Juanjuan; Gong, Xuan; Liu, Jingfang; Wan, Zhiying; Yuan, Xiaoping; Li, Xiaofen; Chen, Chuang; Wang, Gaohua",J Psychiatr Res,267,16

The recent developments in 3D acquisition and visualization technology has contributed to the rapid emergence of a large number of 3D collections, whose production is often justified as the democratization of data and knowledge production. Despite the fact that several 3D datasets are now available online, it is not always clear how the data – once stored – may be engaged by archaeology students, and the possible challenges the students may face in the learning process. The goal of the Dynamic Collections project at Lund University is to develop a novel 3D web infrastructure designed to support higher education and research in archaeology. At the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in the spring of 2020, all teaching at Lund University moved online, reinforcing the urgency for such an infrastructure. By letting a group of students test an early version of the system as part of their online teaching, we were able to study how they used and interacted with an archaeological collection in 3D and explore the intersection of digital methods and pedagogy in archaeology.

Because the disease is easily transmitted, face masks are a vital tool to slow the spread. The aim of this study is to investigate the impacts of face mask use on standard automated perimetry (SAP) results in glaucoma patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: All follow-up glaucoma patients who underwent SAP between May and October 2020 were enrolled in this study. In patients with low test reliability and/or visual field changes, SAP was repeated after repositioning and taping patients' face masks. RESULTS: A total of 127 patients (59 female and 68 male) with a mean age of 59.8±10.3 years were included in the study. While 101 patients (79.5%) wore surgical face masks, 26 patients (20.5%) wore cloth face masks. Low SAP reliability appeared in 23 patients (18.1%), and inferior visual field defects were present in 3 patients (2.4%). The main effects of poorly fitting face masks on SAP reliability were increased fixation losses and false-positive errors (for both, P=0.001). Low SAP reliability was significantly higher in patients wearing cloth face masks than in those wearing surgical face masks (47.8% vs. 9.9%; P=0.0001). The face mask-related fogging of eyeglasses before SAP is a strong predictor of fogging of the trial lenses-related low SAP reliability (odds ratio: 27, 95% confidence interval: 5.48-132.92, P=0.0001). In all repeated SAPs, the patients' reliability parameters improved, and inferior visual field artifacts disappeared. CONCLUSIONS: Unsuitable face masks can cause either visual field artifacts, which may be interpreted as glaucoma progression or low test reliability. Taping the face masks' upper edges is an effective technique to prevent visual field artifacts and obtain good test reliability.","Bayram, Nurettin; Gundogan, Medine; Ozsaygili, Cemal; Vural, Esra; Cicek, Ayse",J Glaucoma,267,9

Under general anesthesia, in the first group the right mandibular condyle was removed, in the second a surgical access was made, and in the third no procedure was made. The animals were sacrificed with three months of age, and submitted to axial and rostro-caudal radiographs of the fixed skulls. Thus, dissection was made, and axial projection of the dried skull and a lateral projection of the hemimandibles, were obtained. With these, cephalometric mensurations were made through a computer system. The statistical analyses showed a highly significant difference for the mandibular midline deviation and to the mandibular length in the experimental group, as well as significant difference for the mandibular ramus heigh and maxillary length. It was concluded that condylectomy in the growing period promoted a significant asymmetry in the mandible, also with significant alterations in the maxillary length.","Rodrigues, Lucimar; Gualberto de Cerqueira Luz, João",Acta cir. bras.,267,0

These measures, however, came at a cost for older adults who faced major mental health issues because of social isolation. The impact of social isolation remains well documented in the wake of the pandemic. This paper explored the lived experiences of older adults living in the community during the Covid-19 sanitary lockdown in the small-island state of Mauritius. As a small-island state with family structures that still skew towards extended or modified extended families, it was interesting to explore whether older adults would be reporting feelings of social isolation as was being reported elsewhere. This study utilized a qualitative approach using a lifeworld hermeneutical approach with 15 older adult participants, recruited through convenience and snowball sampling, in the community. Data were collected using a narrative approach supplemented by an interview guide. Thematic analysis was used to identify themes from transcribed and translated data. Six themes were discovered: Fears of the virus and fear of deprivation; Reliving and recreating bonds; Active contribution to family life; Being and feeling valued within the family; Rediscovering family time and family moments; and Fear of going back to 'normal'. The study revealed positive experiences of the lockdown period characterised by an increase bonding in the family, deepening of familial bond, and increased value despite an initial apprehension of the lockdown. A renewed sense of purpose as well as deepening of bonds was reported by older adults. Some limitations in relation to data trustworthiness and respondents bias, however, could not be avoided since the study was carried out during sanitary lockdown period. The feelings of social isolation and depression reported by older adults who lived alone were not seen in this study, suggesting that the family structure may have a role to play in mitigating these effects. There would also be a need to explore similar small-island states or similar cultures where the effects of sanitary lockdowns may be different from current literature.","Chemen, Sambaladevi; Gopalla, Youven Naiken",J Aging Stud,267,16

Yet studies of resilience suggest most individuals will successfully negotiate this challenge and some may even experience growth and positive change. Some evidence suggests that the capacity to enact positive change in the face of adversity may be shaped by early life experiences. METHODS: In a subset of 374 participants (57% female, mean age = 29 years) in the Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development (SECCYD), a longitudinal, birth cohort, prospective models were tested to determine whether early life adversities in family and neighborhood contexts predict positive change events in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Childhood family and neighborhood contexts were assessed using a combination of self-report questionnaires and US Census data. Adulthood positive change events (e.g., becoming more appreciative of things usually taken for granted) were assessed using the Epidemic-Pandemic Impacts Inventory (EPII). RESULTS: In regression analyses, neighborhood disadvantage in childhood, measured both by objective and subjective assessments, predicted a higher number of positive change events in response to the COVID-19 pandemic (ß = .18, p = .004 and ß = .15, p = .006, respectively). Examination of the positive change event subscales showed neighborhood disadvantage in childhood predicted increases in events related to 'perspective taking and charitable giving' (ß = .20, p = .022 and ß = .17, p = .002, respectively) and improved 'social relationships' (ß = .18, p = .004 and ß = .13, p = .020, respectively), but not to positive 'health behaviors' (ps > .05). All associations were independent of sociodemographic factors and childhood family dysfunction. CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest that neighborhood disadvantage in childhood may shape prosocial responses to stress in adulthood, potentially through early life adaptions to stress that are protective when facing adversity. There are several notable implications of the study findings. Although adversity in early life has clear negative impacts, it is possible that adversity experiences may also provide opportunities to develop adaptive strategies that foster resilience and growth when facing stress. Intervention efforts should consider leveraging such stress-adapted strengths to reduce the many negative impacts of early life adversity.","Bleil, Maria E; Appelhans, Bradley M; Thomas, Alexis S; Gregorich, Steven E; Marquez, Neal; Roisman, Glenn I; Booth-LaForce, Cathryn; Crowder, Kyle",BMC Psychol,267,29

Since children are less than 1% of reported cases, there is limited information to develop evidence-based practice recommendations. The objective of this study was to rapidly gather expert knowledge and experience to guide the care of children with chronic kidney disease during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A four-round multi-center Delphi exercise was conducted among 13 centers in 11 European countries of the European Pediatric Dialysis Working Group (EPDWG) between March, 16th and 20th 2020. Results were analyzed using a mixed methods qualitative approach and descriptive statistics. RESULTS: Thirteen COVID-19 specific topics of particular need for guidance were identified. Main themes encompassed testing strategies and results (n = 4), changes in use of current therapeutics (n = 3), preventive measurements of transmission and management of COVID-19 (n = 3), and changes in standard clinical care (n = 3). Patterns of center-specific responses varied according to regulations and to availability of guidelines. CONCLUSIONS: As limited quantitative evidence is available in real time during the rapid spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, qualitative expert knowledge and experience represent the best evidence available. This Delphi exercise demonstrates that use of mixed methodologies embedded in an established network of experts allowed prompt analysis of pediatric nephrologists' response to COVID-19 during this fast-emerging public health crisis.

The aim of this study was to develop such a multi-lncRNAs signature. Optimal multiple candidate signature lncRNAs associated with DRFS were firstly identified by a univariate Cox proportional hazard regression survival analysis and a robust likelihood-based survival analysis of the GEO dataset GSE25055. A nine-lncRNA prognostic risk score model Risk Score = 0.0289 × EXPLOC100507388 - 0.0814 × EXPLINC00094 - 0.2422 × EXPSMG7-AS1 - 0.2433 × EXPPP14571 + 0.4690 × EXPASAP1-IT1 - 0.2483 × EXPLOC103344931 - 0.2464 × EXPFAM182A + 0.3349 × EXPHCG26 - 0.0216 × EXPLINC00963 was built according to the coefficients of multivariate survival analysis of the association between the candidate lncRNAs and survival. EXPlncRNA was the standardized log2-transformed expression level of the gene. According to this model, higher scores predicted lower survival probability. The area under Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) was 0.777 to 0.823 from 1- to 7- year survival rate. The model and its individual lncRNAs differentiated survival probability between the higher scores (expression) and the lower scores (expression). The nine-lncRNA signature had the robust prognostic power compared with ER, PR, tumor size (T), lymph node invasion (N), TNM stage, pathologic response, chemosensitivity prediction and PAM50 signature. These results were consistent with those based on the GEO dataset GSE25065. The predictive nomograms integrating both the nine-lncRNA signature classifier and clinical-pathological risk factors were robust in predicting 1-, 3- and 5- year survival probabilities. These results supported that the nine-lncRNA signature was a robust and effective model in predicting DRFS of patients with HER2-negative breast cancer following taxane and anthracycline-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy.","Sun, Min; Liu, Xiaoxiao; Xia, Lingyun; Chen, Yuying; Kuang, Li; Gu, Xinsheng; Li, Tian",Biochem Pharmacol,267,6

The extent to which vertical programmes financially support health security has not been investigated. We, therefore, endeavoured to quantify the extent to which the budgets of this vertical programme support health security. We believe this is a crucial area of work as the global community works to combine resources for COVID-19 response and future pandemic preparedness. METHODS: We examined budgets for work in Kenya, Uganda, Vietnam, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Guatemala, Guinea, India, Indonesia, Nigeria, and Sierra Leone from January, 2014 to December, 2020. These ten countries were selected because of the robustness of investments and the availability of data. Using the International Health Regulations Joint External Evaluation (JEE) tool as a framework, we mapped budget line items to health security capacities. Two researchers independently reviewed each budget and mapped items to the JEE. Budgets were then jointly reviewed until a consensus was reached regarding if an item supported health security directly, indirectly, or not at all. The budgets for the study countries were inputted into a single Microsoft Excel spreadsheet and line items that mapped to JEE indicators were scaled up to their respective JEE capacity. Descriptive analyses were then done to determine the total amount of money budgeted for activities that support health security, how much was budgeted for each JEE capacity, and how much of the support was direct or indirect. FINDINGS: The research team reviewed 37 budgets. Budgets totalled US$6â927â284â966, and $2â562â063â054 (37·0%) of this mapped to JEE capacities. $1â330â942â712 (19·2%) mapped directly to JEE capacities and $1â231â120â342 (17·8%) mapped indirectly to JEE capacities. Laboratory systems, antimicrobial resistance, and the deployment of medical countermeasures and personnel received the most overall budgetary support; laboratory systems, antimicrobial resistance, and workforce development received the greatest amount of direct budgetary support. INTERPRETATION: Over one-third of the Global Fund's work also supports health security and the organisation has budgeted more than $2â500â000â000 for activities that support health security in ten countries since 2014. Although these funds were not budgeted specifically for health security purposes, recognising how vertical programmes can synergistically support other global health efforts has important implications for policy related to health systems strengthening.

Diurnal fluctuations in circulating cortisol concentrations in elephants have been demonstrated based on samples from urine and saliva. The aims of this study were to demonstrate diurnal cortisol fluctuations based on blood samples and compare concentrations between seasons, species, and changes in reproductive hormone concentrations. Nine African (Loxodonta africana) and three Asian (Elephas maximus) elephants at two facilities in the United States were included in this study. Blood samples were collected every 2-3 h at one location and every 1-6 h at another. Peak serum concentrations of cortisol averaged 28 ng/ml for both African and Asian elephants, and diurnal cycles included a fivefold decrease from morning peak to evening nadir concentrations. Diurnal cortisol profiles varied uniquely among individual elephants. During the winter, nadir concentrations of cortisol were slightly higher, and the timing of peak concentrations was less predictable. There was no correlation between diurnal serum concentrations of progesterone and cortisol; however, a significant correlation (p = .02) was identified between serum concentrations of testosterone and cortisol when a time lag of ~2-3 h was considered. The physiological significance of the positive correlations between diurnal serum concentrations of cortisol and testosterone in male elephants remains to be determined. If cortisol concentrations are being used to evaluate elephant health or welfare, samples should be obtained at the same time each day to minimize variation due to diurnal fluctuations, and ideally seasonal variations and individuality in diurnal profiles should also be considered.","Bechert, Ursula; Hixon, Sean; Schmitt, Dennis",Zoo biol,267,20

These regulations aimed to reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission among farmworkers, but made compromises that may fail to reduce the risk of further outbreaks among Oregon's agricultural workers, particularly those living in agricultural labor housing. Instead of considering the scientific literature that called for attention to space and length of time for social distancing among unrelated persons in indoor areas, the agency accepted the 6-foot social distancing rule of thumb and allowed even shorter distances between beds with the installation of plastic or plywood barriers. The 6-foot distance (or less with a barrier) between people sleeping next to each other in poorly ventilated housing has proved disastrous. Additionally, testing for migrant and seasonal farmworkers is neither uniform nor thorough, and little data have been collected to assess the success of existing testing efforts. New regulations must be adopted for farm labor housing that limit occupancy to at most two unrelated individuals for a room of 200 square feet; include expanded specification on the provision of fresh air in shared living spaces; and support increased access to testing, surveillance testing, and alternative safe housing at labor housing sites for identified cases.","Accorsi, Emma K; Samples, Julie; McCauley, Linda A; Shadbeh, Nargess",J Agromedicine,267,16

However, researchers are yet to establish whether SARS-CoV-2 can directly enter the salivary glands. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the presence of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)/transmembrane serine proteases 2 (TMPRSS2) expression in salivary glands using publicly available databases. The distribution of ACE2 and TMPRSSs family in salivary gland tissue and other tissues was analyzed. The Genotype-Tissue Expression dataset was employed to explore the ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression in various body organs and salivary glands in a healthy population. The single-cell sequencing data for salivary gland samples (including submandibular salivary gland and parotid gland) from mice were collected and analyzed. The components and proportions of salivary gland cells expressing the key protease TMPRSSs family were analyzed. Transcriptome data analysis showed that ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were expressed in salivary glands. The expression levels of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were marginal without significant differences in different age groups or between men and women. Single-cell RNA sequence analysis indicated that TMPRSS2 was mainly expressed in salivary gland epithelial cells. We speculate that SARS-CoV-2 may be entered in salivary glands.","Song, Jukun; Li, Yamei; Huang, Xiaolin; Chen, Zhihong; Li, Yongdi; Liu, Chong; Chen, Zhu; Duan, Xiaofeng",J. med. virol,267,1

The questionnaire centres around four areas of interest: satisfaction with ERT, comparison of face-to-face (F2F) vs. online learning experiences, perceived stress level during ERT, and acquisition of skills. The results show how students responded to the emergency procedures and which factors they considered essential in terms of satisfaction and stress. Furthermore, they reveal thought-provoking insights on aspects such as integrating elements of online teaching into F2F instruction, developing various skills in lockdown, and motivation for learning. Our findings are analysed in terms of aspects and factors which are viewed as efficient or inefficient by students in a time of crisis. Thus, this research may contribute not only to better preparedness should circumstances requiring ERT return, but also to a more complex re-evaluation of instructional approach at university level.","Dvoráková, Katerina Emmer Jaroslav Janktová Renata Klementová Katerina",Journal on Efficiency and Responsibility in Education and Science,267,21

Survey data were collected from a convenience sample of representatives from 427 SBHCs, representing approximately one sixth of SBHCs nationwide. When schools closed in spring 2020, 77% of SBHCs closed temporarily, 5% closed permanently, and 12% remained physically open. Telehealth was a crucial strategy used to continue delivering essential services. The percentage reporting any telehealth service offering before and after school closures increased by over 200%. Yet they also reported challenges, including financial and policy restraints. Many SBHCs that closed temporarily did so because their host schools closed, suggesting that making arrangements to remain open if a similar situation to the COVID-19 pandemic should arise might be beneficial. SBHCs are a proven cost-effective model to deliver health care in resource-limited communities.

Specifically, researchers sought to understand if pharmacy patients were comfortable with being immunized by a pharmacy technician, and also if knowing the technician personally, knowing that the technician was trained to immunize, the waiting time, or the patient age were factors that changed the patient comfort level. METHODS: Qualitative, semi-structured, key informant interviews were conducted using a 12-item interview script. Participants were walk-in patients from 3 chain community pharmacies in a state in which technicians have not started to administer immunizations, but in which the practice is not prohibited. RESULTS: A total of 46 pharmacy patients were interviewed and the following 4 themes emerged from the resulting transcripts: pharmacy patients support immunization by pharmacy technicians to increase the accessibility and decrease the waiting time, even for pediatric patients; patients value positive, trusting relationships with the pharmacy team, and knowing technicians had proper immunization technique training added to the patients' feelings of comfort; participants believed that allowing technicians to immunize would broaden the technician's responsibilities and balance the workload among the pharmacy team; and some patients still choose not to be vaccinated at a pharmacy. CONCLUSION: This study sought to gather pharmacy patient perspectives about receiving immunizations from pharmacy technicians. The results showed that pharmacy patients support the additional role of pharmacy technicians as immunizers in general.

268949,268949,268949,Post-Test Probability of COVID-19 Using CT,19.441736,8.550762,2021,"Background: On March 17, 2020, French authorities implemented a nationwide lockdown to respond to the COVID-19 epidemic and curb the surge of patients requiring critical care. Assessing the effect of lockdown on individual displacements is essential to quantify achievable mobility reductions and identify the factors driving the changes in social dynamics that affected viral diffusion. We aimed to use mobile phone data to study how mobility in France changed before and during lockdown, breaking down our findings by trip distance, user age and residency, and time of day, and analysing regional data and spatial heterogeneities. Methods: For this population-based study, we used temporally resolved travel flows among 1436 administrative areas of mainland France reconstructed from mobile phone trajectories. Data were stratified by age class (younger than 18 years, 18-64 years, and 65 years or older). We distinguished between residents and non-residents and used population data and regional socioeconomic indicators from the French National Statistical Institute. We measured mobility changes before and during lockdown at both local and country scales using a case-crossover framework. We analysed all trips combined and trips longer than 100 km (termed long trips), and separated trips by daytime or night-time, weekdays or weekends, and rush hours. Findings: Lockdown caused a 65% reduction in the countrywide number of displacements (from about 57 million to about 20 million trips per day) and was particularly effective in reducing work-related short-range mobility, especially during rush hour, and long trips. Geographical heterogeneities showed anomalous increases in long-range movements even before lockdown announcement that were tightly localised in space. During lockdown, mobility drops were unevenly distributed across regions (eg, Île-de-France, the region of Paris, went from 585â000 to 117â000 outgoing trips per day). They were strongly associated with active populations, workers employed in sectors highly affected by lockdown, and number of hospitalisations per region, and moderately associated with the socioeconomic level of the regions. Major cities largely shrank their pattern of connectivity, reducing it mainly to short-range commuting (95% of traffic leaving Paris was contained in a 201 km radius before lockdown, which was reduced to 29 km during lockdown). Interpretation: Lockdown was effective in reducing population mobility across scales. Caution should be taken in the timing of policy announcements and implementation, because anomalous mobility followed policy announcements, which might act as seeding events. Conversely, risk aversion might be beneficial in further decreasing mobility in highly affected regions. We also identified socioeconomic and demographic constraints to the efficacy of restrictions. The unveiled links between geography, demography, and timing of the response to mobility restrictions might help to design interventions that minimise invasiveness while contributing to the current epidemic response.

OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety of HCQ in the treatment of COVID-19 and other diseases by performing a systematic review and meta-analysis. METHODS: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) reporting the safety of HCQ in PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library were retrieved starting from the establishment of the database till June 5, 2020. Literature screening, data extraction, and assessment of risk bias were performed independently by two reviewers. RESULTS: We identified 53 eligible studies involving 5496 patients. The meta-analysis indicated that the risk of adverse effects (AEs) in the HCQ group was significantly increased compared with that in the control group (RD 0.05, 95%CI, 0.02 to 0.07, P = 0.0002), and the difference was also statistically significant in the COVID-19 subgroup (RD 0.15, 95%CI, 0.07 to 0.23, P = 0.0002) as well as in the subgroup for other diseases (RD 0.03, 95%CI, 0.01 to 0.04, P = 0.003). CONCLUSIONS: HCQ is associated with a high total risk of AEs compared with the placebo or no intervention in the overall population. Given the small number of COVID-19 participants included, we should be cautious regarding the conclusion stating that HCQ is linked with an increase incidence of AEs in patients with COVID-19, which we hope to confirm in the future through well-designed and larger sample size studies.","Chen, Can; Pan, Kunming; Wu, Bingjie; Li, Xiaoye; Chen, Zhangzhang; Xu, Qing; Li, Xiaoyu; Lv, Qianzhou",Eur. j. clin. pharmacol,267,16

Methods: This study employs social network analyses based on 2,864 Twitter users and 2,775 communications of Twitter. Results: This study finds that President Trump plays the most important role in social networks among the top 20 key players for both in-degree centrality and content in tweets. Second, Donald Trump and Barak Obama show the opposite result for the in-degree centrality and follower analysis. The result shows that the topic-based networks and the person-based networks play a different role in social networks. This study demonstrates that the presidents, the World Health Organization (WHO) and its regional offices, the Centers for Disease Control, and news channels play a crucial role in the news of COVID-19 for people. Key players, such as Donald Trump, Barack Obama, and BBC, are located in the central networks. In contrast, U.S. news channels and WHO and its regional offices have independent channels.

In order to avoid the serious losses caused by safety problems in ports under major emergencies due to the lack of necessary, forward-looking prevention in the increasingly complex system of ports, this paper introduced the theory of safety resilience into the field of ports for the first time and proposed a triangle model of safety resilience in ports, which included three elements: the disaster system, the disaster bearing system and the safety resilience management. Aiming at the quantitative evaluation demands of safety resilience in ports, the system evaluation indexes of safety resilience in ports were established, including 6 secondary indexes and 37 tertiary indexes. The theory of entropy weight based on normalization standard processing was used to calculate and analyze the importance of each index, and the influence weight value of each index on safety resilience and the prediction curve chart of safety resilience in ports were obtained. The research results can provide a reference for the capacity construction and application of safety resilience in ports, which will effectively solve the new challenges faced by port safety at this stage and help to improve the ability of the port not only in disaster prevention and mitigation but also in disaster recovery and continuous improvement. © 2021 The Authors, published by EDP Sciences.","Hu, Y.; Meng, G.; Lv, J.; Jin, H.; Lu, L.","5th International Workshop on Advances in Energy Science and Environment Engineering, AESEE 2021",267,16

METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted among 470 multinational seafarers working on two oil tanker international shipping companies. Psychosocial distress was assessed by using Depression-Anxiety-Stress Scale (DASS-21). General Health Questionnaire-12 (GHQ-12) and Zung Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) were used to assessed genral psychiatry disorders and self-rate anxiety. Perceived health status was assessed by a single-item question. Multivariate logistic regression was used to determine the association between demographic and work-related variables with mental health outcomes. RESULTS: Overall, 439 out of 470 invited seafarers with a mean age of 34.5 (SD: 8.05) participated in this study (participation rate: 93.4%). The prevalence (95% confidence interval) of depression, anxiety, stress, self-rated anxiety, general psychiatric disorders, and poor perceived health status was 12.3% (9.4-15.7), 11.6% (8.7-15.0), 5.9% (3.9-8.5), 2.1% (0.9-3.8), 42.6% (38.0-47.4), and 4.3% (2.6-6.6), respectively. In the multivariate model, by increasing the duration of stay (per month) on board, the odds of depression increased by 20% (OR: 1.20 (95% CI: 1.02-1.40)). Also, non-officer seafarers experienced significantly lower psychosocial distress such as anxiety and stress levels than officers. CONCLUSION: High prevalence of depression, anxiety, and general psychiatric disorders among seafarers during COVID-19 was observed. Our findings also highlight the factors that need to be considered to protect seafarers' mental well-being. Further studies to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on psychological health issues at sea are recommended.","Baygi, Fereshteh; Mohammadian Khonsari, Nami; Agoushi, Arash; Hassani Gelsefid, Saeed; Mahdavi Gorabi, Armita; Qorbani, Mostafa",BMC Psychiatry,267,16

However, worry, which is a key motivator of behavioral health changes, occurs less frequently for older than younger adults, and less frequently for men than women. Building on this, we tested whether older adults - and particularly older men -- would report the least amount of COVID-19 worry and also fewer COVID-19 behavior changes. METHODS: From March 23-31, 2020, we administered an online questionnaire assessing COVID-19 perceptions, worries, and behavior changes. Participants were a convenience sample of United States residents, who were community-dwelling younger adults (18-35) or older adults (65 to 81). Analyses included 146 younger adults (68 men, 78 women) and 156 older adults (82 men, 74 women). Participants was predominately White, living in suburban/urban areas, and had completed some college. RESULTS: During the early phase of the outbreak in the United States, older adults perceived the risks of COVID-19 to be higher than did younger adults. Despite this, older men were comparatively less worried about COVID-19 than their younger counterparts. Compared to the other participants, older men had also implemented the fewest behavior changes. DISCUSSION: Interventions are needed to increase COVID-19 behavior changes in older men. These results also highlight the importance of understanding emotional-responses to COVID-19, as these are predictive of their behavioral responses.","Barber, Sarah J; Kim, Hyunji",,267,24

Unlike other recent cross-country studies, we show that financial inclusion, particularly financial outreach, is a key driver of poverty reduction in these countries. This effect is not direct, but indirect, by mitigating the detrimental effect that inequality has on poverty. Our findings are consistent across all the different measures of poverty used and robust to instrumental variables. Our forecasts suggest that by 2021 the world's population living on less than $5.50 dollars a day would increase by 231 million people, of which nearly 107.8 million people would be pushed into extreme poverty living on less than $1.90 per day.

Few reports in Colombia have recorded this species in departments such as Meta, Tolima and Valle del Cauca. In this paper we describe this species using taxonomic, morphometric and molecular methods after collecting individuals parasitizing collared anteaters (Tamandua tetradactyla) in the departments of Cundinamarca and Tolima. Adult specimens were identified based on current taxonomic keys and different morphometric variables were documented in nonengorged individuals. Also, DNA was extracted for PCR amplification and sequencing of 16S rDNA, COI and ITS2 genes. Phylogenetic trees were built. One hundred and thirty-four adult ticks were collected and identified as Amblyomma nodosum, based on morphological, morphometric, molecular and phylogenetic analyses. This is the first study to report the presence of this tick species in the department of Cundinamarca, using multiple identification approaches, thus expanding its geographical records in Colombia.","Robayo-Sánchez, Laura Natalia; Ramírez-Hernández, Alejandro; Cortés-Vecino, Jesús Alfredo",Rev Bras Parasitol Vet,267,12

Targeting activated hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), the major extracellular matrix (ECM)-producing cells within the damaged liver, has been regarded as one of the main treatments for hepatic fibrosis. In the present study, we performed preliminary bioinformatics analysis attempting to identify possible factors related to hepatic fibrosis and found that lncRNA G protein-coupled receptor 137B (Gpr137b-ps) and C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 14 (CXCL14) showed to be markedly upregulated within carbon tetrachloride (CCl4)-caused hepatic fibrotic mice tissue samples and activated HSCs. CXCL14 The silencing of lncRNA Gpr137b-ps or CXCL14 alone could significantly improve CCl4-induced fibrotic changes in mice liver in vivo and collagen I and III release by HSCs and HSC proliferation in vitro. miR-200a-3p directly targeted lncRNA Gpr137b-ps and CXCL14, respectively. LncRNA Gpr137b-ps relieved miR-200a-3p-induced inhibition on CXCL14 expression via acting as a ceRNA. In HSCs, the effects of lncRNA Gpr137b-ps silencing on collagen I and III release by HSCs and HSC proliferation were significantly reversed by miR-200a-3p inhibition, and the effects of miR-200a-3p inhibition were reversed by CXCL14 silencing. In conclusion, we demonstrated a lncRNA Gpr137b-ps/miR-200a-3p/CXCL14 axis that modulates HSC activation and might exert an effect on the pathogenesis of liver fibrosis.","Liao, Jinmao; Zhang, Zheng; Yuan, Qi; Liu, Qiong; Kuang, Jia; Fang, Yuan; Hu, Xiaoxuan",Toxicol. lett,267,9

Background: COVID-19 has now spread throughout world. There is a serious need to find potential therapeutic agents. The 3C-like protease (Mpro/6LU7) is an attractive molecular target for rational anti-CoV drugs Methods: The tertiary structure of COVID-19 Mpro was obtained from a protein data bank repository, and molecular docking screening was performed by Molegro Virtual Docker, ver. 6, with a grid resolution of 0.30 A. Docking scores (DOS) are representative of calculated ligand-receptor (protein) interaction energy;therefore, more negative scores mean better binding tendency. Another docking study was then applied on each of the selected drugs with the best ligands separately and using a more accurate RMSD algorithm. Results The docking of COVID-19 major protease (6LU7) with 17 selected drugs resulted in four FDA approved viral antiprotease drugs (Temoporfin, Simeprevir, Cobicistat, Ritonavir) showing the best docking scores. Among these 4 compounds, Temoporfin exhibited the best DOS (-202.88) and the best screened ligand with COVID-19 Mpro, followed by Simeprevir (-201.66), Cobicistat (- 187.75), and Ritonavir (-186.66). As the best screened ligand, Temoporfin could target the Mpro with 20 different conformations, while Simeprevir, Cobicistat, and Ritonavir make 14, 10, and 10 potential conformations at the binding site, respectively.","Absalan, A.; Doroud, D.; Salehi-Vaziri, M.; Kaghazian, H.; Ahmadi, N.; Zali, F.; Pouriavali039,; s, M.

Expansion of the pandemic will be expedited by factors such as an abundance of at-risk populations, inadequate COVID-19 mitigation efforts, sheer inability to comply with community mitigation strategies, and constrained national preparedness. This situation will reduce the benefits achieved through decades of disease control and health promotion measures, and the economic progress made during periods of global development. Without interventions, and as soon as international travel and trade resume, reservoirs of COVID-19 and other vaccine-preventable diseases in LDFCAC will continue 'feeding' developed countries with repeated infection seeds. Assuring LDFCAC equity in access to medical countermeasures, funds to mitigate the pandemic, and a paradigm change in the global development agenda, similar to the post-World War II Marshall Plan for Europe, are urgently needed. We argue for a paradigm change in strategy, including a new global pandemic financing mechanism for COVID-19 and other future pandemics. This approach should assist LDFCAC in gaining access to and membership of a global interdisciplinary pandemic taskforce to enable in-country plans to train, leverage, and maintain essential functioning and also to utilize and enhance surveillance and early detection capabilities. Such a task force will be able to build on and expand research into the management of pandemics, protect vulnerable populations through international laws/treaties, and reinforce and align the development agenda to prevent and mitigate future pandemics.

Of all COVID-19 patients in Saudi Arabia,78%were male patients and 22% were female patients. This proportion of male COVID-19 patients was similar to that of male MERS patients, which also affected male patients more frequently than female patients. The number of COVID-19-positive Saudi cases was lower than that of non-Saudi cases, which were in contrast to that of MERS; COVID-19 appeared to be remarkably similar to MERS with respect to recovered cases. However, the numbers of critical and dead COVID-19 patients have been much lower than those of MERS patients. The largest proportion of COVID-19 and MERS cases (44.05% and 40.8%, respectively) were recorded in the Western region. MERS and COVID-19 exhibited similar threats to the lives of adults and the elderly, despite lower mortality rates during the COVID-19 epidemic.

Postinfectious neurological complications are the result of the activation of immune mechanisms and can explain the insurgence of immune-mediated diseases, including the Guillain-Barré syndrome and other diseases of the central and peripheral nervous system that in the past occurred as complications of viral infections and occasionally with vaccines. For these reasons, the present outbreak calls for the introduction of surveillance systems to monitor changes in the frequency of several immune-mediated neurological diseases. These changes will determine a reorganization of the measures apt to describe the interaction between the virus, the environment, and the host in areas of different dimensions, from local communities to regions with several millions of inhabitants. The public health system, mainly primary care, needs to be strengthened to ensure that research and development efforts are directed toward right needs and directions. To cope with the present pandemic, better collaboration is required between international organizations along with more research funding, and tools in order to detect, treat, and prevent future epidemics.","Beghi, Ettore; Feigin, Valery; Caso, Valeria; Santalucia, Paola; Logroscino, Giancarlo",Neuroepidemiology,267,16

The development of the concept of safety and security education in the context of sustainability is very important from both a scientific and practical point of view due to the fact that schools play a key role in society constituting the basic source of education for future generations of citizens, shaping awareness, competence and skills of future generations and thus creating a society that is able to analyse the opportunities and threats arising from the changing economic, social, environmental, technological, political and legal environment. The aim of the paper is to indicate the key factors for improving the security and safety education in the context of sustainability and to prepare the recommendations for preparing the security and safety courses. To complete that objective studies, Computer-AssistedWeb Interview either with students or with security and safety experts were used in the study. The survey was conducted among two representative samples of high school students in Poland-one sample 418 high school students from regular high schools, and 100 from solitaire classes. The results from the CAWI were discussed with 20 security and safety experts to indicate the learning methods and tools to improve safety and security education. The main finding from the study was that safety and security education must be improved because respondents saw gaps in their knowledge on several issues in the area of safety and security. Modern training methods should be included in safety education, e.g., e-learning platforms, Serious games, social media, virtual worlds, simulators, integrated systems using e.g., kinect, VR goggles, accessories, mobile technologies.","Wysokińska-Senkus, Aneta",Sustainability,267,6

A web-based survey of medical oncologists certified by the Japanese Society of Medical Oncology was conducted between November 1 and December 31, 2019. Of the 1369 medical oncologists who were invited to participate, 415 (30.3%) responded to our survey. The questionnaire comprised 4 sections: ""oncologist characteristics,"" ""oncologist attitude toward influenza vaccines and the current status of influenza vaccination for cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy,"" ""incidence of influenza infection and associated treatment complications,"" and ""treatment policy for influenza infection."" In total, 153 (36.9%) physicians replied that they did not actively encourage influenza vaccination for patients undergoing chemotherapy. The primary reasons given were lack of evidence (48/153, 31.4%) and uncertainty of appropriate timing (46/153, 30.1%). There was diverse variation in the timing of vaccination and in the levels of encouragement based on the cancer location and medication type. Two hundred eighty-three (68.2%) oncologists reported that their cancer patients had experienced influenza infection while undergoing chemotherapy, and 169 (40.7%) responded that their patients had experienced an administration delay or discontinuation of medication because of influenza infection. Our surveillance revealed some oncologists considered evidence regarding the administration of influenza vaccine to cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy (particularly the optimal timing and level of recommendation by cancer location and medication) to be lacking. It also exposed the adverse impact of influenza infection in cancer patients.","Maeda, Toshiki; Sasaki, Hidenori; Togawa, Atsushi; Tanaka, Toshihiro; Arima, Hisatomi; Takata, Tohru; Takamatsu, Yasushi",Cancer sci,267,6

During the COVID-19 pandemic, it is necessary to establish standardized out-patient protocols to provide safe and effective treatment for osteoporosis patients and medical staff. In an osteoporosis clinic, we advocate the following suggestions to prevent and control osteoporosis during the pandemic period: (1) specialized diagnosis and treatment techniques for osteoporosis patients in the outpatient care, including enhancing the prevention for outpatient medical staff, strengthening awareness of COVID-19 prevention, strictly screening outpatients with COVID-19 infection, and insistent administration of anti-osteoporosis drugs during outbreaks; (2) home prevention for osteoporosis patients including keeping windows open, exposing them to sunlight, supplementing them with enough protein, exercising regularly, and administrating calcium supplements; and (3) simplifying the follow-up and evaluation of osteoporosis using online platforms.","Zou, J; Song, D-W; Niu, J-J; Shi, J-W; Yang, H-L",Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,267,26

Follow-up scans every 3-5 days are often recommended for disease progression. It has been reported that bilateral and peripheral ground glass opacification (GGO) with or without consolidation are predominant CT findings in COVID-19 patients. However, due to lack of computerized quantification tools, only qualitative impression and rough description of infected areas are currently used in radiological reports. In this paper, a deep learning (DL)-based segmentation system is developed to automatically quantify infection regions of interest (ROIs) and their volumetric ratios w.r.t. the lung. The performance of the system was evaluated by comparing the automatically segmented infection regions with the manually-delineated ones on 300 chest CT scans of 300 COVID-19 patients. For fast manual delineation of training samples and possible manual intervention of automatic results, a human-in-the-loop (HITL) strategy has been adopted to assist radiologists for infection region segmentation, which dramatically reduced the total segmentation time to 4 minutes after 3 iterations of model updating. The average Dice simiarility coefficient showed 91.6% agreement between automatic and manual infaction segmentations, and the mean estimation error of percentage of infection (POI) was 0.3% for the whole lung. Finally, possible applications, including but not limited to analysis of follow-up CT scans and infection distributions in the lobes and segments correlated with clinical findings, were discussed.","Shan, Fei; Gao, Yaozong; Wang, Jun; Shi, Weiya; Shi, Nannan; Han, Miaofei; Xue, Zhong; Shen, Dinggang; Shi, Yuxin",,267,16

If infected, AI patients require prompt replacement tailoring. We assessed, in a cohort of AI patients: prevalence and clinical presentation of COVID-19; prevalence of AC and association with intercurrent COVID-19 or pandemic-related psychophysical stress; lockdown-induced emotional burden, and health-related QoL. METHODS: In this monocentric (Ancona University Hospital, Italy), cross-sectional study covering February-April 2020, 121 (40 primary, 81 secondary) AI patients (59 males, 55 ± 17 years) completed telematically three questionnaires: the purpose-built ""CORTI-COVID"", assessing medical history and concern for COVID-19-related global health, AI-specific personal health, occupational, economic, and social consequences; the AddiQoL-30; the Short-Form-36 (SF-36) Health Survey. RESULTS: COVID-19 occurred in one (0·8% prevalence) 48-year-old woman with primary AI, who promptly tailored her replacement. Dyspnea lasted three days, without requiring hospitalization. Secondary AI patients were not involved. No AC were experienced, but pandemic-related stress accounted for 6/14 glucocorticoid up-titrations. Mean CORTI-COVID was similar between groups, mainly depending on ""personal health"" in primary AI (&#961; = 0.888, p < 0.0001) and ""economy"" in secondary AI (&#961; = 0.854, p < 0.0001). Working restrictions increased occupational concern. CORTI-COVID correlated inversely with QoL. AddiQoL-30 and SF-36 correlated strongly. Comorbidities worsened patients' QoL. CONCLUSION: If educational efforts are made in preventing acute events, AI patients seem not particularly susceptible to COVID-19. The novel ""CORTI-COVID"" questionnaire reliably assesses the pandemic-related emotional burden in AI. Even under unconventional stress, educated AI patients preserve a good QoL.","Martino, M; Aboud, N; Cola, M F; Giancola, G; Ciarloni, A; Salvio, G; Arnaldi, G",J. endocrinol. invest,267,8

METHODS: A systematic review of studies published from inception to May 2020 using Embase, Google Scholar, Medline, PubMed and Scopus. Prospective studies, which pre-operatively assessed any imaging modality for the presence of bladder DE, and correlated with the gold standard surgical data as a reference were included. The QUADAS-2 tool was used to assess quality. This review was prospectively registered with PROSPERO (CRD42017059872). RESULTS: Of the 1,977 references identified, 8 studies (n = 1,052) were included in the analysis. The overall pooled sensitivity and specificity, from which the likelihood ratio of a positive test (LR+), likelihood ratio of a negative test (LR-) and diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) were calculated, for all transvaginal ultrasonography (TVS) techniques were 55 % (95 % CI 28-79%), 99 % (95 % CI 98-100%), 54.5 (95 % CI 18.9-157.4), 0.46 (95 % CI 0.25 - 0.85) and 119 (95 % CI 24-577), and for only two-dimensional (2D) TVS 53 % (95 % CI 23-82%), 99 % (96 % CI 97-100%), 48.8 (95 % CI 13.1-181.4), 0.47 (95 % CI 0.23 - 0.98), and 104 (95 % CI 15-711), respectively. Meta-analyses of the other modalities, namely magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and transrectal endoscopic sonography (RES), were not possible due to the limited number of studies. There was significant heterogeneity and the studies were considered poor methodologically according to the QUADAS-2 tool. CONCLUSIONS: Whilst the sensitivity of TVS was limited, the specificity was excellent. Given that there is a paucity of literature for other imaging modalities, until more studies are performed, TVS should be considered as the first-line tool given it is the only modality with sufficient evidence.","Gerges, B; Li, W; Leonardi, M; Mol, B W; Condous, G",Eur J Obstet Gynecol Reprod Biol,267,6

We consider particular impacts on noninferiority clinical trials, which aim to show that an investigational treatment is not markedly worse than an existing active control with known benefit. Because interpretation of noninferiority trials requires cross-trial validation involving untestable assumptions, it is vital that they be run to very high standards. The COVID-19 pandemic has introduced an unexpected impact on clinical trials, with subjects possibly missing treatment or assessments due to unforeseen intercurrent events. The resulting data must be carefully considered to ensure proper statistical inference. Missing data can often, but not always, be considered missing completely at random (MCAR). We discuss ways to ensure validity of the analyses through study conduct and data analysis, with focus on the hypothetical strategy for constructing estimands. We assess various analytic strategies of analyzing longitudinal binary data with dropouts where outcomes may be MCAR or missing at random (MAR). Simulations show that certain multiple imputation strategies control the Type I error rate and provide additional power over analysis of observed data when data are MCAR or MAR, with weaker assumptions about the missing data mechanism.","Wiens, Brian L.; Lipkovich, Ilya",Stat.

The objectives of this study can be highlighted through classifying the information sources for identifying protective practices, death probability, gender-death associations probability and education level. Methodology: This is a descriptive design study conducted among the Kurdistan Region/Iraq population via an online application between 1 March and 1 May 2020. Three hundred twenty people participated in this questionnaire study. The data were collected through an online form, relying upon a self-report questionnaire. The questionnaire had three main parts. The first part is related to the socio-demographic characteristics of the sample, including gender, age, family status, address status and education level. The second part involves the items related to precautionary measures using none, sometimes, and always. The last part contains items related to death probability owing to other causes and this includes five categories: extremely low, low, intermediate, high and extremely high. The validity and reliability of this questionnaire were revised by the panel of experts before the data collection. Results: The outcomes of the study revealed that the majority, ca. 73%, of the Kurdistan Region/Iraq population depended on TV to obtain information about COVID-19. Also, this investigation showed that there is a substantial association between participants with infection prevention and control practices relevant to COVID-19. Moreover, according to this study, there is a significant relationship between the death probability and COVID-19. Concurrently, there is not any significant association between other causes, namely cancer, heart diseases, diabetes and road traffic accidents, and the death probability. Conclusion: This study showed that for the majority of the Kurdistan Region/Iraq population the most reliable source of information for any COVID-19 related updates is the TV broadcast.

Five million people emigrated from Wuhan before lockdown, potentially representing a source of virus infection. Determining case distribution and its correlation with population emigration from Wuhan in the early stage of the epidemic is of great importance for early warning and for the prevention of future outbreaks. METHODS: The official case report on the COVID-19 epidemic was collected as of January 30, 2020. Time and location information on COVID-19 cases was extracted and analyzed using ArcGIS and WinBUGS software. Data on population migration from Wuhan city and Hubei province were extracted from Baidu Qianxi, and their correlation with the number of cases was analyzed. RESULTS: The COVID-19 confirmed and death cases in Hubei province accounted for 59.91% (5806/9692) and 95.77% (204/213) of the total cases in China, respectively. Hot spot provinces included Sichuan and Yunnan, which are adjacent to Hubei. The time risk of Hubei province on the following day was 1.960 times that on the previous day. The number of cases in some cities was relatively low, but the time risk appeared to be continuously rising. The correlation coefficient between the provincial number of cases and emigration from Wuhan was up to 0.943. The lockdown of 17 cities in Hubei province and the implementation of nationwide control measures efficiently prevented an exponential growth in the number of cases. CONCLUSIONS: The population that emigrated from Wuhan was the main infection source in other cities and provinces. Some cities with a low number of cases showed a rapid increase in case load. Owing to the upcoming Spring Festival return wave, understanding the risk trends in different regions is crucial to ensure preparedness at both the individual and organization levels and to prevent new outbreaks.","Chen, Ze-Liang; Zhang, Qi; Lu, Yi; Guo, Zhong-Min; Zhang, Xi; Zhang, Wen-Jun; Guo, Cheng; Liao, Cong-Hui; Li, Qian-Lin; Han, Xiao-Hu; Lu, Jia-Hai",Chin Med J (Engl),267,16

In addition, we examined the moderating role of a leader's behavioral integrity in strengthening the relationship between participative leadership, and employees' workplace thriving and helping behaviors. By using a two-wave time-lagged design and data collected from 244 healthcare workers, a moderated hierarchal regression was implemented to test the proposed hypotheses. As hypothesized, participative leadership predicted employees' workplace thriving and helping behaviors. The leader's behavioral integrity strengthened the relationship between participative leadership and employees' thriving and moderated the relationship between participative leadership helping behaviors.

The COVID-19 elderly population with hyper-tension, diabetes, cardiovascular, and cerebrovascular diseases are at risk. Mortality rates are highest in these individuals if infected with COVID-19. Although the lungs are the main organs involved in acute respiratory distress syndrome caused by COVID-19 infection, COVID-19 triggers inflammatory and immune mechanisms, inducing a “cytokine storm” that aggravates disease progression and may lead to death. Presently, effective drugs are lacking, although current studies have confirmed that drugs with therapeutic potential include redaciclovir, lopinavir/ritonavir combined with interferon-β, convalescent plasma, and mono-clonal antibodies. Currently, the most reasonable and effective way to prevent COVID-19 is to control the source of infection, terminate routes of transmission, and protect susceptible populations. With the rise of COVID-19 in China and worldwide, further prevention, diagnosis, and treatment measures are a critical unmet need. Cerebrovascular disease has high incidence, disability rate, and fatality rate. COVID-19 patient outcomes may also be complicated with acute stroke.

However, there have been higher-risk populations in which this infection has not been well studied nor documented. One of these populations includes the pregnant cohort. The purpose of this article is to describe the clinical manifestations of COVID-19 infection in the pregnant population and review the implications and sequelae of the infection throughout pregnancy and outcomes of live births. Also, we summarize the understanding and safety of current treatments and vaccination in pregnancy. This comprehensive review article comprises several case reports, case series, cohort studies, retrospective studies, and randomized clinical trials. Findings regarding maternal morbidity included an increased risk of acquiring severe COVID-19 infection requiring a higher level of inpatient hospital care along with an increased risk of preterm labor and cesarean delivery. Neonatal COVID-19 vertical transmission was shown to have conflicting data as there was a presence of transmission in certain retrospective studies and absence in others. There was also no evidence of teratogenicity from maternal COVID-19 infection. In conclusion, in part due to the unique physiologic state of pregnancy and part due to unknown factors, pregnant patients are at increased risk for negative outcomes of COVID-19 infection and must be classified as a high-risk population.","Hapshy, Vera; Aziz, Daniel; Kahar, Payal; Khanna, Deepesh; Johnson, Kenneth E; Parmar, Mayur S",SN Compr Clin Med,267,10

Patients implanted with DBS require life-long management of the medical device as well as medications. Patients are often challenged to frequently visit the specialized DBS centers and such challenges are aggravated depending on geography, socioeconomic factors, and support systems. We discuss the need for digital health solutions to overcome these barriers to better and safely take care of patients, especially in the current COVID-19 pandemic. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A review of the literature was conducted for technology and logistics necessary in forming a digital health program. RESULTS: Digital health encounters can take place in both a synchronous and asynchronous manner. Factors involving patients include cognitive capacity, physical safety, physical capacity, connectivity, and technological security. Physician factors include examining the patient, system diagnostics, and adjusting stimulation or medications. Technology is focused on bridging the gap between patient and physician through integrating the DBS lead, implantable pulse generator (IPG), programmer, novel devices/applications to grade motor function, and teleconference modalities. CONCLUSIONS: For patients with Parkinson's disease, digital health has the potential to drastically change the landscape after DBS surgery.

The aim of this study was to analyse the death process of patients who died from SARS-CoV-2 at the Hospital Costa del Sol. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Descriptive cross-sectional study of the period in which all patients who died of SARS-CoV-2 from February to April 2020 were analysed. Sociodemographic characteristics, sample characterization and a set of variables related to the death process were collected in the death event. RESULTS: A total of 16 deaths were recorded out of a total of 103 admissions positive for SARS-CoV-2. Limitation of therapeutic effort was decided in 68.8% of the patients, and admission to the intensive care unit was refused in 56.3%. Support devices had not been removed in any of the cases on the day of death, 43.8% had palliative sedation, and 18.8% were in induced coma. CONCLUSIONS: Quality standards were maintained in the death process in patients who died from SARS-CoV-2, although there were aspects that could be improved. Palliative care is an essential component of the response to SARS-CoV-2 that must be incorporated into all health care settings.","Sepúlveda-Sánchez, J M; Rivas-Ruiz, F; Moya Suárez, A B; Medina-López, R; Sánchez-Megolla, D",J. healthc. qual. res,267,27

Disease outbreaks that sweep through a single region can have massive impacts on food supply, while severe outbreaks of human pathogens can disrupt agricultural labor supply or demand for products perceived as ‘unsafe’. Market pressures have generally rewarded production of cash crops for fuel and energy dense, low nutrient processed foods over production of fruits and vegetables for local consumption. Climbing rates of food-related NCDs and pre-existing conditions leave the population increasingly susceptible to infectious diseases that are often driven by or arise from the food system. Therefore disease and diet from our food systems cause impacts on human health, and human health issues can impact on the functioning of the food system. The COVID-19 outbreak is the most recent example of food system driven disease emergence and of massive supply and demand shocks in the food system, experienced as a direct and indirect result of this disease. The effects of the food system on disease spread (and vice versa) must be addressed in future plans to prevent and mitigate large scale outbreaks. Health policies must acknowledge the food system as the base of our health system, as must agri-food policy recognize the pre-eminence of human health (directly and indirectly) in decision making.","Patterson, Grace T.; Thomas, Lian F.; Coyne, Lucy A.; Rushton, Jonathan",Global Food Secur.,267,33

Thus, measuring contact mixing patterns, often in the form of a contacts matrix, has been a key component of heterogeneous disease transmission modeling research. Several data collection techniques estimate or calculate a contacts matrix at different geographical scales and population mixes based on surveys and sensors. This paper presents a methodology for generating a contacts matrix by using high fidelity simulations which mimic actual workflow and movements of individuals in time and space. Results of this study show that such simulations can be a feasible, flexible, and reasonable alternative method for estimating social contacts and generating contacts mixing matrices for various settings under different conditions.","Najafabadi, Mahdi M.; Asgary, Ali; Tofighi, Mohammadali; Tofighi, Ghassem",,267,21

In this paper, we report data related to the reach, engagement, and visitor profile of Break Binge Eating, an online platform designed to provide evidence-based information and self-help strategies for people at all stages of an ED. METHOD: Two sources of data were presented: (a) usage data from platform visitors generated through Google Analytics; and (b) characteristics of a sample of platform visitors (n = 786). RESULTS: In 13 months, approximately 46,311 unique users worldwide have accessed this platform, with usage rates rapidly increasing each month. Most visitors came from organic searches (when ED-related information is directly searched in a browser). Self-help content was the most accessed material, and 81% of the sample stated that their reason for accessing the platform was to get help. Sample visitors were highly symptomatic; 52% met criteria resembling a threshold ED and 87% engaged in at least one ED behavior in the past month.

However, adhering to quarantine is difficult. Decisions on how to apply quarantine should be based on the best available evidence to increase the likelihood of people adhering to protocols. We conducted a rapid review to identify factors associated with adherence to quarantine during infectious disease outbreaks. STUDY DESIGN: The study design is a rapid evidence review. METHODS: We searched Medline, PsycINFO and Web of Science for published literature on the reasons for and factors associated with adherence to quarantine during an infectious disease outbreak. RESULTS: We found 3163 articles and included 14 in the review. Adherence to quarantine ranged from as little as 0 up to 92.8%. The main factors which influenced or were associated with adherence decisions were the knowledge people had about the disease and quarantine procedure, social norms, perceived benefits of quarantine and perceived risk of the disease, as well as practical issues such as running out of supplies or the financial consequences of being out of work. CONCLUSIONS: People vary in their adherence to quarantine during infectious disease outbreaks. To improve this, public health officials should provide a timely, clear rationale for quarantine and information about protocols; emphasise social norms to encourage this altruistic behaviour; increase the perceived benefit that engaging in quarantine will have on public health; and ensure that sufficient supplies of food, medication and other essentials are provided.","Webster, R K; Brooks, S K; Smith, L E; Woodland, L; Wessely, S; Rubin, G J",Public Health,267,4

Data concerning haemostatic complications in children hospitalised for COVID-19/MIS-C are scant. OBJECTIVES: To share our experience in managing SARS-CoV-2 associated pro-coagulant state in hospitalised children. METHODS: D-dimer values were recorded at diagnosis in children hospitalised for SARS-CoV-2 related manifestations. In moderately to critically ill patients and MIS-C cases, coagulation and inflammatory markers were checked at multiple time-points and median results were compared. Pro-thrombotic risk factors were appraised for each child and thromboprophylaxis was started in selected cases. RESULTS: 35 patients were prospectively enrolled. D-dimer values did not discriminate COVID-19 of differing severity, whereas were markedly different between the COVID-19 and the MIS-C cohorts. In both cohorts, D-dimer and C Reactive Protein levels increased upon clinical worsening but were not accompanied by decreased fibrinogen or platelet values, with all parameters returning to normal upon disease resolution. 6 patients had multiple thrombotic risk factors and were started on pharmacological thromboprophylaxis. No deaths, thrombotic or bleeding complications occurred. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 pediatric patients show mildly altered coagulation and inflammatory parameters; on the other hand, MIS-C cases show laboratory signs of an inflammatory driven pro-coagulant status. Universal anticoagulant prophylaxis in hospitalised children with SARS-CoV-2 related manifestations is not warranted, but may be offered to patients with other pro-thrombotic risk factors in the context of a multi-modal therapeutic approach.","Del Borrello, Giovanni; Giraudo, Isaac; Bondone, Claudia; Denina, Marco; Garazzino, Silvia; Linari, Claudia; Mignone, Federica; Pruccoli, Giulia; Scolfaro, Carlo; Spadea, Manuela; Pollio, Berardino; Saracco, Paola",J. thromb. haemost,267,20

Clinical data show that in addition to respiratory system damage, some male patients with COVID-19 are also accompanied by abnormal renal function and even renal damage. As the main receptor of syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is also found to be highly expressed not only in respiratory mucosa and alveolar epithelial cells, but also in renal tubule cells, testicular Leydig cells and seminiferous tubule cells. This suggests that SARS-CoV-2 has the possibility of infecting the male reproductive system, and the recent detection of SARS-CoV-2 in the patient's semen further confirms this theory. In previous studies, it has been found that ACE2 has the ability to regulate autophagy. Not only that, recent studies have also found that SARS-CoV-2 infection can also lead to a reduction in autophagy. All of these associate SARS-CoV-2 with autophagy. Furthermore, autophagy has been shown to have an effect on male reproduction in many studies. Based on these, we propose the hypothesis that SARS-CoV-2 affects male reproductive function by regulating autophagy. This hypothesis may provide a new idea for future treatment of COVID-19 male patients with reproductive function injury, and it can also prompt medical staff and patients to consciously check their reproductive function.","Sun, Jun",Med Hypotheses,267,16

Due to assumably high radiation doses of the complete protocol, the aim of this study is to examine radiation exposure and to establish diagnostic reference levels (DRLs). METHODS: In this retrospective study, dose data of 921 patients with initial CT imaging for suspected acute stroke and dose monitoring with a DICOM header-based tracking and monitoring software were analyzed. Between June 2017 and January 2020, 1655 CT scans were included, which were performed on three different modern multi-slice CT scanners, including 921 NCCT, 465 CTA, and 269 CTP scans. Radiation exposure was reported for CT dose index (CTDIvol) and dose-length product (DLP). DRLs were set at the 75th percentile of dose distribution. RESULTS: DRLs were assessed for each step (CTDIvol/DLP): NCCT 33.9 mGy/527.8 mGy cm and CTA 13.7 mGy/478.3 mGy cm. Radiation exposure of CTP was invariable and depended on CT device and its protocol settings with CTDIvol 124.9-258.2 mGy and DLP 1852.6-3044.3 mGy cm. CONCLUSION: Performing complementary CT techniques such as CTA and CTP for the assessment of acute stroke increases total radiation exposure. Hence, the revised DRLs for the complete protocol are required, where our local DRLs may help as benchmarks.","Zensen, Sebastian; Guberina, Nika; Opitz, Marcel; Köhrmann, Martin; Deuschl, Cornelius; Forsting, Michael; Wetter, Axel; Bos, Denise",Neuroradiology,267,16

We determine the model's basic reproduction number, study the stability of the existing equilibria analytically, and carry out a sensitivity analysis to confirm that the cautiousness level is one of the parameters upon which the basic reproduction number depends most sensitively. Fixing specific values for all other parameters, we study numerically the rich dynamics of the model as the cautiousness level varies over its domain, revealing backward transcritical, Hopf, and saddle-node bifurcations of equilibria, as well as homoclinic and fold bifurcations of limit cycles with the aid of AUTO. Finally, in view of some key events affecting the pandemic in Indonesia, we design a scenario in which the cautiousness level varies over time, and show that the model exhibits a hysteresis, whereby, a slight cautiousness decrease (e.g., from $0.17$ to $0.16$) could bring a disease-free equilibrium state to endemic, and this is subsequently reversible only by a drastic cautiousness increase (from $0.16$, not merely back to $0.17$, but to exceed $0.35$), thereby mathematically justifying the importance of a high cautiousness level for resolving the pandemic.","Yong, Benny; Owen, Livia; Hoseana, Jonathan",,267,33

Ace2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2), the gene encoding the host protein to which SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins bind, is expressed in the gut and therefore may be a target for preventing or reducing severity of COVID-19. Here we test the hypothesis that Ace2 expression in the gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts is modulated by the microbiome. We used quantitative PCR to profile Ace2 expression in germ-free mice, conventional raised specific pathogen-free mice, and gnotobiotic mice colonized with different microbiota. Intestinal Ace2 expression levels were significantly higher in germ-free mice compared to conventional mice. A similar trend was observed in the respiratory tract. Intriguingly, microbiota depletion via antibiotics partially recapitulated the germ-free phenotype, suggesting potential for microbiome-mediated regulation of Ace2 expression. Variability in intestinal Ace2 expression was observed in gnotobiotic mice colonized with different microbiota, partially attributable to differences in microbiome-encoded proteases and peptidases. Together, these data suggest that the microbiome may be one modifiable factor determining COVID-19 infection risk and disease severity.","Koester, Sean T; Li, Naisi; Lachance, Daniel M; Morella, Norma M; Dey, Neelendu",PLoS One,267,24

We aimed to assess the psychological impact of COVID-19 on HCWs in comparison to the stress brought on by the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) epidemic in Saudi Arabia. METHOD: Between February 5th and 16th, 2020, 811 health-care workers (HCWs) of a tertiary care teaching hospital were invited to fill a questionnaire regarding concerns and worries about the novel coronavirus pandemic, along with Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) Anxiety Severity screening tool. RESULTS: Out of 582 HCWs who completed the survey questionnaire (response rate of 71.8%), about 40% were exposed previously to MERS-CoV infected or suspected patients during a previous hospital outbreak. While there were no COVID-19 cases reported yet in Saudi Arabia at the time of data collection, still, the anxiety level from COVID-19 was significantly higher than that from MERS-CoV or seasonal influenza: 41.1% were more worried about COVID-19, 41.4% were similarly worried about both MERS-CoV and COVID-19, and 17.5% were more stressed by the previous MERS-CoV hospital outbreak. The most frequent concern was transmitting the infection to family and friends (2.71/5) than to themselves only (2.57/5). CONCLUSION: Pandemic and epidemic infectious diseases such as COVID-19 or MERS-CoV impose a significant level of anxiety and stress on healthcare workers who are caring of infected patients, with their main concern being the risk of transmitting the infection to their families or to acquire it themselves. Therefore, optimizing the compliance of healthcare workers with the proper infection prevention and control measures is paramount during the infectious disease outbreak, to ensure their safety, to decrease the likelihood of getting infected or transmitting the infection to others, and consequently to alleviate their psychological stress and anxiety.","Temsah, Mohamad-Hani; Al-Sohime, Fahad; Alamro, Nurah; Al-Eyadhy, Ayman; Al-Hasan, Khalid; Jamal, Amr; Al-Maglouth, Ibrahim; Aljamaan, Fadi; Al Amri, Maha; Barry, Mazin; Al-Subaie, Sarah; Somily, Ali Mohammed",J Infect Public Health,267,19

It is shown that almost from the first months of 2020, events in the world began to unfold according to unforeseen scenar-ios, and how, in accordance with the developing situation, the forecasts made earlier changed. The author analyzed the evolution of predictions for oil demand in 2020 made by EIA USA and the OPEC Secretariat in the period since December 2019 and January 2021, compared to the end of 2018-2019, and the expected outcome in 2020 (as in the whole world and its main regions and countries). The article gives the latest estimates of the expected results of development of the world economy and its oil sector in 2020, made by experts of the IMF, the OECD, the IEA, the OPEC Secretariat and other organi-zations, and their projections for 2021 It is shown that the IEA experts, way USA and the OPEC Secretariat almost equally understand the dynamics of expected global oil demand this year. Their adjustment of the forecast estimates for 2021 was generally consistent with the development of the situation on the world oil markets in 2020 and followed the refinement of the estimates for 2020. Accordingly, these estimates do not contain any funda-mental changes in the current trends. Their authors assume that in 2021, the world oil markets will continue to face significant uncertainty, both directly re-lated to the coronavirus pandemic and the unresolved problems accumulat-ed over the previous two years in the global economy.

However, it has often been invisible in the eyes of policy and policymaking. As soon as the spread of Covid-19 started impacting local and national economies across the globe, many industry and policy bodies rushed into researching the impact of Covid-19 on the creative and cultural industries (CCIs) and the workers in the sector. The paper offers an insight into the key concerns of these organizations through the meta-analysis of the survey and research projects that are currently being undertaken in the context of the UK. The results highlight common concerns in relation to visible and invisible issues that need addressing in the sector.

Accumulating evidence suggested that the progression of COVID-19 is associated with lymphopenia and excessive inflammation, and a subset of severe cases might exhibit cytokine storm triggered by secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (sHLH). Furthermore, secondary bacterial infection may contribute to the exacerbation of COVID-19. We recommend using both IL-10 and IL-6 as the indicators of cytokine storm, and monitoring the elevation of procalcitonin (PCT) as an alert for initiating antibacterial agents.

Spatial casual inference poses analytic challenges due to complex correlation structures and interference between the treatment at one location and the outcomes at others. In this paper, we review the current literature on spatial causal inference and identify areas of future work. We first discuss methods that exploit spatial structure to account for unmeasured confounding variables. We then discuss causal analysis in the presence of spatial interference including several common assumptions used to reduce the complexity of the interference patterns under consideration. These methods are extended to the spatiotemporal case where we compare and contrast the potential outcomes framework with Granger causality, and to geostatistical analyses involving spatial random fields of treatments and responses. The methods are introduced in the context of observational environmental and epidemiological studies, and are compared using both a simulation study and analysis of the effect of ambient air pollution on COVID-19 mortality rate.

The population to be tested is divided into divisions based on earlier observed detection rate of SARS-CoV-2 first. Samples collected are then grouped in appropriate pooled size. The number of tests per person in that population is expressed as a function of two variables: the observed detection rate and the pooled size or number of samples grouped. The minimum number of tests per person can be further shown to be a function of only one of these two variables, because these two parameters are found to be related at this minimum. A management scheme on grouping the samples is proposed in order to reduce the number of tests, to save time, which is of utmost importance in fighting an epidemic. The proposed testing scheme will be useful for supporting the government in making decisions to handle regular routine detection tests for identifying asymptomatic patients and implementing health code system in large population of millions of citizens. Another important point is to use smaller number of test kits, allowing more resources to speed up the mass screening tests, particularly in places not so rich.","Chow, W K; Chow, C L",Epidemiol Infect,267,3

Many of these devices are pressure-cycled pneumatic ventilators, which are easy to produce but often do not include the sensing or alarm features found on commercial ventilators. This work reports a low-cost, easy-to-produce electronic sensor and alarm system for pressure-cycled ventilators that estimates clinically useful metrics such as pressure and respiratory rate and sounds an alarm when the ventilator malfunctions. A low-complexity signal processing algorithm uses a pair of nonlinear recursive envelope trackers to monitor the signal from an electronic pressure sensor connected to the patient airway.

Collecting such datasets is time-consuming and expensive. Until now, very few annotated COVID-19 imaging datasets are available. Although self-supervised learning enables us to bootstrap the training by exploiting unlabeled data, the generic self-supervised methods for natural images do not sufficiently incorporate the context. For medical images, a desirable method should be sensitive enough to detect deviation from normal-appearing tissue of each anatomical region; here, anatomy is the context. We introduce a novel approach with two levels of self-supervised representation learning objectives: one on the regional anatomical level and another on the patient-level. We use graph neural networks to incorporate the relationship between different anatomical regions. The structure of the graph is informed by anatomical correspondences between each patient and an anatomical atlas. In addition, the graph representation has the advantage of handling any arbitrarily sized image in full resolution. Experiments on large-scale Computer Tomography (CT) datasets of lung images show that our approach compares favorably to baseline methods that do not account for the context. We use the learnt embedding to quantify the clinical progression of COVID-19 and show that our method generalizes well to COVID-19 patients from different hospitals. Qualitative results suggest that our model can identify clinically relevant regions in the images.","Sun, Li; Yu, Ke; Batmanghelich, Kayhan",,267,22

Reviewing the adequacy of medication safety practices during the COVID-19 pandemic is critical to informing responses to future pandemics. The purpose of this study was to evaluate medication safety practices at a height of both COVID-19 cases and hydroxychloroquine use. METHODS: This was a multicentre observational point prevalence study. Adult inpatients receiving hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19 between March 22 and 28, 2020 were included. The primary outcome was the percentage of patients receiving appropriate QTc monitoring. Secondary outcomes included QTc prolongation, early discontinuation of hydroxychloroquine and ventricular arrhythmias. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: A total of 59% (167/284) of patients treated with hydroxychloroquine received appropriate QTc monitoring. QTc prolongation occurred in 25%. Hydroxychloroquine was prematurely discontinued in 1.4% of patients, all due to QTc prolongation. Ventricular arrhythmia occurred in 1.1%. WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION: Medication safety practices were suboptimal with regard to hydroxychloroquine monitoring at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. Preparation for future pandemics should devote considerable attention to medication safety.","Smoke, Steven M; Leach, Henry; Leonida, Nicole; Raja, Karan; Shah, Monica; Patel, Vishal; Patel, Gargi; Daniel, Nicole M; Gerges, Jessica; Patel, Akshar",J. clin. pharm. ther,267,16

Nanotechnology is a powerful tool with the capability to produce nanomaterials with unique physicochemical and anti-pathogen properties. Here, we outline how to realize non-disposable and highly comfortable respirators with light-triggered self-disinfection ability by bridging bioactive nanofiber properties and stimuli-responsive nanomaterials. The visionary road highlighted in this Concept is based on the possibility to develop a new generation of masks based on multifunctional membranes where the presence of nanoclusters and plasmonic nanoparticles arranged in a hierarchical structure enables the realization of a chemically-driven and on-demand anti-pathogen activities. Multilayer electrospun membranes have the ability to dissipate humidity present within the mask, enhancing the wearability and usability.

The aim of this study was to outline the main issues that led tobacco smoking being discussed as a potential risk factor associated with COVID-19. METHODS: articles from MEDLINE and pre-prints published from January to April 2020 were identified. RESULTS: data from China showed that men had more severe outcomes of COVID-19 than women. Since smoking prevalence is very high among Chinese men in comparison to women, it was hypothesized that smoking could be a risk factor for poor prognosis. This was also supported by the higher prevalence of comorbidities, many of which are tobacco-related diseases, in patients with severe COVID-19, who were also more likely to have a smoking history. A meta-analysis confirmed these results reporting an OR=2.25 (95% CI: 1.49-3.39) for developing severe Covid-19 among patients with a smoking history. Some authors, noticing that reported smoking prevalence among hospitalized patients was substantially below smoking prevalence in the corresponding populations, speculated a protective role of nicotine. However, it is likely that low prevalence among hospitalized patients are partially due to many smokers misclassified as nonsmokers. Tobacco smoking seems to cause a dose-dependent upregulation of the angiotensin-converting- enzyme-2 (ACE2), the virus cellular entry receptor, which could explain the higher risk of severe COVID-19 in smokers. CONCLUSIONS: There is need for further independent studies to clarify the role of smoking on COVID-19 incidence, progression and mortality.","Cattaruzza, Maria Sofia; Zagà, Vincenzo; Gallus, Silvano; D039,; Argenio, Paolo; Gorini, Giuseppe",Acta Biomed,267,16

This review aims to systematically assess the associations between micronutrient supplementation or deficiency, with novel coronavirus incidence and disease severity. METHODS: Systematic literature searches conducted in five electronic databases identified 751 unique studies, of which 33 studies (five supplementation studies, one supplementation and deficiency study, and 27 deficiency studies) were eventually included in this review. Proportions of incidence and severity outcomes in each group, and adjusted summary statistics with their relevant 95% confidence intervaIs (CI) were extracted. Data from 19 studies were pooled in meta-analysis using the generic inverse variance method. FINDINGS: A total of 360,346 patients across 16 countries, with a mean age between 32 and 87.7 years, were involved across 33 studies. All studies were on COVID-19 infections. In individuals without micronutrient deficiency, there was a significant reduction on odds of COVID-19 incidence (pooled OR: 0.37, 95% CI: 0.18, 0.78), and ICU admissions or severe/critical disease onset when combined as a severity outcome (pooled OR: 0.26, 95% CI: 0.08, 0.89). Insignificant protective effects were observed on other outcome measures, namely mortality, ICU admission, progression to respiratory-related complications, severe/critical disease onset or requiring respiratory support and hospitalization rate. CONCLUSION: The absence of micronutrient deficiency significantly reduced COVID-19 incidence and clinical deterioration in hospitalized patients. Usage of micronutrients as prophylaxis and complementary supplement in therapeutic management of COVID-19 patients may be a promising and cost-effective approach warranting in-depth investigation.","Wang, Min Xian; Gwee, Sylvia Xiao Wei; Pang, Junxiong",Nutrients,267,20

METHODS: A retrospective cohort study using a nationally representative English primary care database comparing people aged >= 40 years who were recorded as being advised to shield using a fixed ratio of 1:1, matching to people with the same diagnoses not advised to shield (nâ¯=â¯77,360 per group). Time-to-death was compared using Cox regression, reporting the hazard ratio (HR) of mortality between groups. A sensitivity analysis compared exact matched cohorts (nâ¯=â¯24,752 shielded, nâ¯=â¯61,566 exact matches). RESULTS: We found a time-varying HR of mortality between groups. In the first 21 days, the mortality risk in people shielding was half those not (HRâ¯=â¯0.50, 95%CI:0.41-0.59. p < 0.0001). Over the remaining nine weeks, mortality risk was 54% higher in the shielded group (HR=1.54, 95%CI:1.41-1.70, p < 0.0001). Beyond the shielding period, mortality risk was over two-and-a-half times higher in the shielded group (HR=2.61, 95%CI:2.38-2.87, p < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Shielding halved the risk of mortality for 21 days. Mortality risk became higher across the remainder of the shielding period, rising to two-and-a-half times greater post-shielding.

METHOD: An online cross-sectional survey was carried out to assess the general population's psychological response during the initial state of the outbreak in Saudi Arabia. The study used brief screening tools PHQ-4 for anxiety-depression symptoms and IES-6 for posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms. RESULTS: Among the 584 respondents, 19.8% and 22.0% reported moderate to severe anxiety and depression symptoms respectively. According to the combined PHQ-4 score, 14.5% of participants showed moderate to severe anxiety or depression disorder. Overall, 64.8% met the level of clinical concern for posttraumatic stress disorder and 51.3% met the level of probable posttraumatic stress disorder diagnosis. Multivariate analyses showed that females, non-Saudi nationalities, and those who had a history of mental illness were more vulnerable to anxiety and depression disorders than their counterparts, whereas a higher prevalence of distress symptoms was reported among those who prefer Arabic over English for communication. It was found that people whose colleagues or family infected with the disease were more likely to report moderate to severe symptoms of anxiety or depression and distress. The study further showed that the higher the perceived threat, the higher the chances of exhibiting anxiety-depressive disorder symptoms and distress symptoms.

But how much did these lockdown measures improve air quality in large cities, and are there differences in how air quality was affected? Here, we analyse data from two megacities: London as an example for Europe and Delhi as an example for Asia. We consider data during and before the lockdown and compare these to a similar time period from 2019. Overall, we find a reduction in almost all air pollutants with intriguing differences between the two cities. In London, despite smaller average concentrations, we still observe high-pollutant states and an increased tendency towards extreme events (a higher kurtosis during lockdown). For Delhi, we observe a much stronger decrease of pollution concentrations, including high pollution states. These results could help to design rules to improve long-term air quality in megacities.","Schafer, Benjamin; Verma, Rulan; Giri, Aswin; He, Hankun; Nagendra, S. M.

As a result, methods and techniques for preventing environmental contagious, such as ventilation or air filtration have been proposed. Here, it is investigated the effect of moisturization on airborne COVID-19 transmission from a mechanical point of view in which comparatively large water droplets promote the growth -by collision and coalescence, of suspended airborne COVID-19 and then accelerating its gravitational settling. Utilizing a classical raindrop collisional model from cloud science and the available experimental data an expression for the removal time of suspended airborne COVID-19 as function of the relative humidity was derived. The mechanical model is in good agreement with the recent reported experimental research in which high temperature and high relative humidity reduce COVID-19 contagious and then is a point in favor of the mechanic model of the effect of moisture in the COVID-19 airborne transmission. The results encourage further research on the deliberate moisturization of room air (by using ceiling mounted humidifiers) as a potential technique for control of airborne COVID-19 transmission.","Arias, Francisco J; De Las Heras, Salvador",Environ Res,267,15

METHODS: Using multiplex-polymerase chain reaction (PCR), respiratory tract viruses were investigated in the respiratory tract specimens from patient and control groups followed in the Pediatric Clinic. RESULTS: The viruses detected in the patient and control groups (P=0.013) were as follows, respectively: Rhinoviruses A, B, C (25.6% and 36.7%), influenza virus A (21.1% and 0.0%), parainfluenza virus type 1 (7.8% and 1.7%), parainfluenza virus type 4 (5.6% and 0.0%), adenoviruses A, B, C, D, E (4.4% and 1.7%), parainfluenza virus type 3 (4.4% and 1.7%), coronaviruses 229E and NL63 (4.4% and 1.7%), coronavirus OC43 (3.3% and 0.0%), respiratory syncytial virus A (3.3% and 0.0%), parainfluenza virus type 2 (2.2% and 0.0%), influenza virus B (2.2% and 0.0%), and respiratory syncytial virus B (1.1% and 1.7%).

CONCLUSIONS: The advantage of our study compared with other studies is the inclusion of not only wheezing patients but also children with asthma without symptom. The higher detection of rhinoviruses both in patient and control groups give rise to thought that these viruses may be responsible for asthma exacerbations and may be related with long duration of virus shedding.","Dabaniyasti, Demet; Eksi, Fahriye; Keskin, Özlem; Özkars, Mehmet Y.; Karsligil, TekIn; Balci, Iclal",Minerva Pediatr.,267,33

It has been widely acknowledged that the most effective public policy to mitigate the pandemic is \emph{social and physical distancing}: keeping at least six feet away from people, working from home, closing non-essential businesses, etc. There have been a lot of anecdotal evidences suggesting that social distancing has a causal effect on disease mitigation; however, few studies have investigated the effect of social distancing on disease mitigation in a transparent and statistically-sound manner.

Although the observed illness does not directly measure COVID-19, it reflects a real-time aspect of the pandemic, and unlike confirmed cases, it is much less confounded by counties' testing capabilities. We also consider observed illness three weeks after the intervention period as a secondary outcome. We will test a proportional treatment effect using a randomization-based test with covariance adjustment and conduct a sensitivity analysis.","Zhang, Bo; Ye, Ting; Heng, Siyu; Levy, Michael Z.; Small, Dylan S.",,267,24

However, whether SARS-CoV-2 can infect the human testis directly and enter semen is controversial. Other adverse effects of SARS-CoV-2 on male reproduction are also of concern and require comprehensive evaluation. Here, we analyze the invasiveness of SARS-CoV-2 in the testis and examine reported mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 interferes with male reproduction. Long-term implications of SARS-CoV-2 infection on male reproduction are also discussed. It should be emphasized that although COVID-19 may induce testicular damage, a substantial decrease in male reproductive capacity awaits clinical evidence. We propose that there is an urgent need to track male COVID-19 patients during their recovery.

METHODS: The study design comprised 1) an objective assessment of mastoid drilling-induced droplet spread conducted during simulated cochlear implant (CI) surgery and its mitigation via the use of a protective drape tent and 2) an evaluation of three PPE configurations by otologists while performing mastoid drilling on ex vivo temporal bones. The various PPE solutions were assessed in terms of their impact on communication, vital physiological parameters, visual acuity and fields, and acceptability to surgeons using a systematic risk-based approach. RESULTS: Droplet spread during simulated CI surgery extended over 2 m, a distance greater than previously reported. A drape tent significantly reduced droplet spread. The ensemble of a half-face mask and safety spoggles (foam lined safety goggles) had consistently superior performance across all aspects of clinical usability. All other PPE options were found to substantially restrict the visual field, making them unsafe for microsurgery. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this preclinical study indicate that the most viable solution to enable the safe conduct of CI and other mastoid surgery is a combination of a filtering facepiece (FFP)3 mask or half-face respirator with safety spoggles as PPE. Prescription spoggles are an option for surgeons who need to wear corrective glasses to operate. A drape tent reduces droplet spread.

A significant challenge inthe repair these injuries is to resolve the restriction of prolapsed orbital soft tissue without inducing iatrogenic impingementat the time of implant placement. Forced duction testing, consisting of grasping the conjunctiva with forceps and manuallymanipulating the globe, is the current gold standard for assessing mechanical restriction of eye movement. However, forcedductions result in binary designations of positive or negative, as determined by an individual surgeon's subjectiveperception, which is highly variable and experience-dependent. Here, we present a device to determine quantitative and reproducible measurements of orbital compliance and orbital soft tissue restriction. Method: The device consists of stacked rotational and horizontal translational piezoelectric motor stages, attached to avertical translational motor stage via a load cell that senses vertical resistance ([ Fig. 1 ]). The horizontal translational stageis coupled to a load cell that senses horizontal resistance, with a custom 3D-printed rail and shuttle interface system thatcreates a curvilinear motion for appropriate globe manipulation. The ocular surface is engaged via vacuum-assisted suction([ Fig. 2 ]). The apparatus is mounted on a locking gooseneck arm that can be fastened to the operating table, allowing quickintraoperative positioning, neutralizing recoil force from motor motion, and eliminating user movement interference. Inaddition, we have devised a component for sensing resistance to cyclotorsion ([ Fig. 3 ]), to be affixed between the rotational and horizontal translational motor stages. We designed the device to automate scanning of resistance to translation alongeach orbit clock hour, of force applied normal to the ocular surface, and of globe torque;this enables rapid mapping of softtissue resistance and range of motion with respect to translation, cyclotorsion, and retropulsion. [ Fig. 4 ] depicts a proposedcolor-coded system for visualizing data on translational range of motion and resistance. Results: We had performed cadaveric testing of a previous handheld iteration of the device, consisting of stackedtranslational and rotational motor stages. We demonstrated the feasibility of manipulating the globe through the suctionmechanism and the ability of the load cell to measure resistance to translational force, distinguishing the entrapped state ina cadaveric fracture model. The need to gauge soft-tissue resistance across greater ranges of motion, and to remove usererror stemming from the handheld operation of the previous iteration, led to the creation of the present version. Though wehave constructed a fully functioning prototype, cadaveric and animal testing have not been performed due to COVID-19restrictions. Conclusion: Our device allows for the quantitative characterization of all extraocular muscles and resistance to retropulsion,which can assist in the evaluation not only of soft tissue entrapment secondary to orbital fractures, but also otherpathologies involving mechanical restriction of ocular motion including thyroid eye disease, orbital tumors, and iatrogenicinjury. We envision this device to be used for both preoperative and intraoperative assessment of these conditions and the irsurgical correction.","Bair, H.; Erickson, B.

Our results showed that both CQ and HCQ influenced the functionality of the envelope (E) protein, necessary in the maturation processes of the virus, due to interactions that modify the flexibility of the protein structure. Furthermore, CQ and HCQ also influenced the proofreading and capping of viral RNA in SARS-CoV-2, performed by nsp10/nsp14 and nsp10/nsp16. In particular, HCQ demonstrated a better energy binding with the examined targets compared to CQ, probably due to the hydrogen bonding of the hydroxyl group of HCQ with polar amino acid residues.","Gentile, Davide; Fuochi, Virginia; Rescifina, Antonio; Furneri, Pio Maria",,267,1

Therefore, assessing the relationship between confidence in knowledge and associated factors among HCWs is vital in the fight against COVID-19. This paper investigates factors associated with HCWs' confidence in their overall knowledge about COVID-19 in South Africa in the early stages of the epidemic. Methods: Data utilized in this paper were from an online survey conducted among HCWs using a structured questionnaire on a data free online platform. The study population were all the medical fraternity in South Africa including medical and nurse practitioners as well as other healthcare professionals. Bivariate and multivariate logistic regression models were performed to examine the factors associated with confidence in HCWs' overall knowledge about COVID-19. Results: Overall, just below half (47.4%) of respondents indicated that they had confidence in their overall knowledge about COVID-19. Increased odds of having confidence in the knowledge about COVID-19 were significantly associated with being male [aOR = 1.31 95% CI (1.03-1.65), p < 0.05], having a doctorate degree [aOR = 2.01 (1.23-3.28), p < 0.05], being satisfied with the information about COVID-19 guidelines [aOR = 6.01 (4.89-7.39), p < 0.001], having received training in 6-8 areas [aOR = 2.54 (1.89-3.43), p < 0.001] and having received training in 9-11 areas [aOR = 5.33 (3.81-7.47), p < 0.001], and having already treated COVID-19 patients [aOR = 1.43 (1.08-1.90), p < 0.001]. Those who were highly concerned with the levels of training of HCWs [aOR = 0.47 (0.24-0.92), p < 0.05] had decreased odds of having confidence in their overall knowledge about COVID-19. Conclusion: This study sheds light on the importance of capacitating HCWs with knowledge and adequate relevant training as part of infection prevention control measures during pandemics. Future training and information sharing should be sensitive to knowledge gaps by age, gender, qualifications, professional categories, and experience.","Manyaapelo, Thabang; Mokhele, Tholang; Sifunda, Sibusiso; Ndlovu, Philisiwe; Dukhi, Natisha; Sewpaul, Ronel; Naidoo, Inbarani; Jooste, Sean; Tlou, Boikhutso; Moshabela, Mosa; Mabaso, Musawenkosi; Zuma, Khangelani; Reddy, Priscilla",Front Public Health,267,26

An increase in temperature of 2.2 to 7 °C is predicted to occur within the next century in the worst-case scenario of climate change predictions, which will likely be associated with an increase in the prevalence and duration of reduced water oxygen levels (hypoxia). Furthermore, there is an increasing frequency of heat waves in the Amazon basin, which exacerbates issues related to temperature and hypoxia. Increases in temperature and hypoxia both constrain an organism's ability to supply oxygen to metabolizing tissues, thus the ability to cope with thermal and hypoxic stress may be correlated. Here, we reveal a positive correlation between acute thermal tolerance and acute hypoxia tolerance amongst 37 Amazonian fish species at the current river temperatures of 28-31 °C. The effects of long-term (10 days or 4 weeks) increases in temperature were investigated in a subset of 13 species and demonstrated that 2 species failed to acclimate and survive at 33 °C, 9 species failed at 35 °C, and only 2 species survived up to 35 °C. Of those that survived long-term exposure to 33 or 35 °C, the majority of the species demonstrated only an improvement in acute thermal tolerance. In contrast, hypoxia tolerance was reduced following acute- and long-term exposure to 33, 35 or 37 °C in all species investigated. The results of this study suggest that many of the fish species that inhabit the Amazon may be at risk during both short- and long-term temperature increases and these risks are exacerbated by the associated environmental hypoxia.","Jung, Ellen H; Brix, Kevin V; Richards, Jeffrey G; Val, Adalberto L; Brauner, Colin J",Sci Total Environ,267,9

Convalescent plasma can be a therapeutic option for these patients. Understanding the underlying mechanisms of convalescent plasma is crucial to optimize such therapeutic approach. Here, we describe a COVID-19 patient who was deeply immunosuppressed following rituximab (anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody) and concomitant chemotherapy for chronic lymphoid leukemia. His long-term severe T and B cell lymphopenia allowed to evaluate the treatment effects of convalescent plasma. Therapeutic outcome was monitored at the clinical, biological and radiological level. Moreover, anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody titers (IgM, IgG and IgA) and neutralizing activity were assessed over time before and after plasma transfusions, alongside to SARS-CoV-2 RNA quantification and virus isolation from the upper respiratory tract. Already after the first cycle of plasma transfusion, the patient experienced rapid improvement of pneumonia, inflammation and blood cell counts, which may be related to the immunomodulatory properties of plasma. Subsequently, the cumulative increase in anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies due to the three additional plasma transfusions was associated with progressive and finally complete viral clearance, resulting in full clinical recovery. In this case-report, administration of convalescent plasma revealed a stepwise effect with an initial and rapid anti-inflammatory activity followed by the progressive SARS-CoV-2 clearance. These data have potential implications for a more extended use of convalescent plasma and future monoclonal antibodies in the treatment of immunosuppressed COVID-19 patients.","Zimmerli, Aurelia; Monti, Matteo; Fenwick, Craig; Eckerle, Isabella; Beigelman-Aubry, Catherine; Pellaton, Céline; Jaton, Katia; Dumas, Dominique; Stamm, Gian-Marco; Infanti, Laura; Andreu-Ullrich, Heidrun; Germann, Daphné; Mean, Marie; Vollenweider, Peter; Stadelmann, Raphael; Prella, Maura; Comte, Denis; Guery, Benoit; Gachoud, David; Rufer, Nathalie",Front Immunol,267,13

Although free heme, proinflammatory cytokines, and cardiac hypertrophy are co-existing features of SCD, no mechanistic links between these features have been demonstrated. We now report significantly higher levels of IL-6 mRNA and protein in hearts of the Townes sickle cell disease (SS) mice (2.9-fold, p &#8804; 0.05) than control mice expressing normal human hemoglobin (AA). We find that experimental administration of heme 50 µmoles/kg body weight induces IL-6 expression directly in vivo and induces gene expression markers of cardiac hypertrophy in SS mice. We administered heme intravenously and found that within three hours plasma IL-6 protein significantly increased in SS mice compared to AA mice (3248 ± 275 vs. 2384 ± 255 pg/ml, p &#8804; 0.05). In the heart, heme induced a 15-fold increase in IL-6 transcript in SS mice heart compared to controls. Heme simultaneously induced other markers of cardiac stress and hypertrophy, including atrial natriuretic factor (Nppa; 14-fold, p &#8804; 0.05) and beta myosin heavy chain (Myh7; 8-fold, p &#8804; 0.05) in SS mice. Our experiments in Nrf2-deficient mice indicate that the cardiac IL-6 response to heme does not require Nrf2, the usual mediator of transcriptional response to heme for heme detoxification by heme oxygenase-1. These data are the first to show heme-induced IL-6 expression in vivo, suggesting that hemolysis may play a role in the elevated IL-6 and cardiac hypertrophy seen in patients and mice with SCD. Our results align with published evidence from rodents and humans without SCD that suggest a causal relationship between IL-6 and cardiac hypertrophy.","Gbotosho, Oluwabukola T; Kapetanaki, Maria G; Ghosh, Samit; Villanueva, Flordeliza S; Ofori-Acquah, Solomon F; Kato, Gregory J",Front Immunol,267,30

Six types of prosocial tendencies (altruism, dire, compliant, emotional, public, and anonymous) and selfishness as the antisocial tendency were included as personality factors, while fear related to the pandemic and empathy toward vulnerable groups (i.e., those in forced isolation) were context-related factors. Furthermore, mediation effect of empathy and moderation effect of fear were explored in relations between personality factors and protective behaviors. The sample included 581 participants (78.3% females). The data were collected from March 28 to April 6, 2020, during the emergency state and curfew in Serbia. The results showed that tendency to help anonymously had a positive effect and selfishness had a negative effect on protective behaviors, over and above demographic characteristics and context-related factors. Among context-related factors, only fear related to the pandemic had a significant unique positive effect on protective behaviors, but it had no moderator effect in the relationship between personality traits and protective behaviors. However, empathy acted as a mediator and partly accounted for the negative effect of selfishness and positive effect of tendency to help anonymously on protective behaviors. The results revealed that compliance with protective measures could be seen as prosocial and unselfish form of behavior. Furthermore, these findings have practical implications for shaping public messages and they can help effectively promote health-responsible behaviors.","Dinić, B.

Psychological strengths may help them to cope with emerging challenges and foster mental health and well-being. This study examined the associations between resilience, dispositional hope, preventive behaviours, subjective well-being, and psychological health among adults during early stage of COVID-19. A total of 220 participants from general public participated this study completing a battery of measures (134 men [M age = 42.36 years, SD = 8.99, range = 18 to 60] and 86 women [M age = 36.73 years, SD = 7.44, range = 18 to 51]). This cross-section study indicated that resilience mediated the relationship between hope and psychological health and subjective well-being. Results also showed that hope, and resilience had significant direct effects on psychological health, and subjective well-being while preventive behaviours did not manifest a significant effect on these two variables except on resilience. Preventive behaviours mediated the relationship between hope and resilience. The results suggest that we should more pay attention to hope and resilience for the development and improvement of well-being and psychological health during the times of crisis.","Yildirim, Murat; Arslan, Gökmen",Curr Psychol,267,20

However, the clinical efficacy is very limited due to its low oral bioavailability resulting from its poor aqueous solubility. In the present study, a new hybrid drug delivery system made of NIC, montmorillonite (MMT), and Tween 60 is proposed to overcome this obstacle. At first, NIC molecules were immobilized into the interlayer space of cationic clay, MMT, to form NIC-MMT hybrids, which could enhance the solubility of NIC, and then the polymer surfactant, Tween 60, was further coated on the external surface of NIC-MMT to improve the release rate and the solubility of NIC and eventually the bioavailability under gastrointestinal condition when orally administered. Finally, we have performed an in vivo pharmacokinetic study to compare the oral bioavailability of NIC for the Tween 60-coated NIC-MMT hybrid with Yomesan®, which is a commercially available NIC. Exceptionally, the Tween 60-coated NIC-MMT hybrid showed higher systemic exposure of NIC than Yomesan®. Therefore, the present NIC-MMT-Tween 60 hybrid can be a potent NIC drug formulation with enhanced solubility and bioavailability in vivo for treating Covid-19.","Yu, Seungjin; Piao, Huiyan; Rejinold, N Sanoj; Jin, Geunwoo; Choi, Goeun; Choy, Jin-Ho",,267,23

Given prior vaccine hesitancy in the US and the current high impact of COVID-19 on the population, it is imperative to understand and address factors that drive perceptions and intention to get vaccinated. OBJECTIVES: The objectives of the study were to 1) determine impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on influenza vaccine uptake, on patient perceptions of vaccinations, vaccine intention, and health behaviors and 2) determine vaccine intention through the Health Belief Model. METHODS: An IRB-approved prospective Qualtrics-based survey was administered online to eligible respondents: non-pregnant panel respondents 18 years or older within the United States who could independently complete the entire questionnaire in English. Data analyses included descriptive statistics, psychometric analyses of the 5C and CoBQ tools, one-way ANOVA to compare demographic groups and vaccine intention items with survey scores, and mapping and path analysis of the HBM with one added domain (Decision Making Determinant, DMD). RESULTS: 525 respondents completed the survey from October 23-29, 2020. Respondents aged 18-49, making less than $20,000 or an undisclosed income, and not having anyone close to them directly affected by COVID-19 showed a significant, negative impact of COVID-19 on health behavior and a significantly lower vaccine acceptance. The 5C and CoBQ showed moderately strong reliability. Mapping for the HBM revealed significant correlations between all modifying factors with Individual Perceptions except for Race/Ethnicity. Of the Individual Perceptions, Perceived Benefits (-.114) and Perceived Barriers (.307) significantly predicted DMD and directly impacted Vaccine Intention. DMD was not a significant mediator of Vaccination Intention. CONCLUSIONS: Vaccination messaging should focus on a simple yet balanced view of benefits and risks, targeting those under age 50 and living in low-income households, to motivate uptake of influenza and COVID-19 vaccines.","Mercadante, Amanda R; Law, Anandi V",Res. soc. adm. pharm,267,16

Data were from the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN), the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the United States Renal Data System. Based on 2019 OPTN reports, annualized reduction in kidney transplantation of 25%-100% could result in excess deaths of wait-listed (deceased donor) transplant candidates from 84 to 337 and living donor candidate excess deaths from 35 to 141 (total 119-478 potentially preventable deaths of transplant candidates). Changes in transplant activity due to COVID-19 varied with some centers shutting down while others simply heeded known or suspected pandemic risks. Understanding potential excess mortality for ESRD transplant candidates when circumstances compel curtailment of transplant activity may inform policy and procedural aspects of organ transplant systems allowing ways to best inform patients and families as to potential risks in shuttering organ transplant activity. Considering that more than 700 000 Americans have ESRD with 100 000 awaiting a kidney transplant, our highest annual estimate of 478 excess total deaths from postponing kidney transplantation seems modest.","Peters, Thomas G; Bragg-Gresham, Jennifer L; Klopstock, Annie C; Roberts, John P; Chertow, Glenn; McCormick, Frank; Held, Philip J",Clin Transplant,267,2

This knowledge can be extracted from a given corpus (KG generation process) or specified from an existing KG (KG specification process). Focusing on domain specific solutions, knowledge acquisition is a labor intensive task usually orchestrated and supervised by subject matter experts. Specifically, the domain of interest is usually manually defined and then the needed generation or extraction tools are utilized to produce the KG. Herein, we propose a supervised machine learning method, based on Transformers, for domain definition of a corpus. We argue why such automated definition of the domain's structure is beneficial both in terms of construction time and quality of the generated graph. The proposed method is extensively validated on three public datasets (WebNLG, NYT and DocRED) by comparing it with two reference methods based on CNNs and RNNs models. The evaluation shows the efficiency of our model in this task. Focusing on scientific document understanding, we present a new health domain dataset based on publications extracted from PubMed and we successfully utilize our method on this.

It has surprising transmissibility potential, since it could infect all ages, gender, and human sectors. It attacks respiratory, gastrointestinal, urinary, hepatic, and endovascular systems and can reach the peripheral nervous system (PNS) and central nervous system (CNS) through known and unknown mechanisms. The reports on the neurological manifestations and complications of the SARS-CoV-2 infection are increasing exponentially. Herein, we enumerate seven candidate routes, which the mature or immature SARS-CoV-2 components could use to reach the CNS and PNS, utilizing the within-body cross talk between organs. The majority of SARS-CoV-2-infected patients suffer from some neurological manifestations (e.g., confusion, anosmia, and ageusia). It seems that although the mature virus did not reach the CNS or PNS of the majority of patients, its unassembled components and/or the accompanying immune-mediated responses may be responsible for the observed neurological symptoms. The viral particles and/or its components have been specifically documented in endothelial cells of lung, kidney, skin, and CNS. This means that the blood-endothelial barrier may be considered as the main route for SARS-CoV-2 entry into the nervous system, with the barrier disruption being more logical than barrier permeability, as evidenced by postmortem analyses.","Uversky, Vladimir N; Elrashdy, Fatma; Aljadawi, Abdullah; Ali, Syed Moasfar; Khan, Rizwan Hasan; Redwan, Elrashdy M",J. neurosci. res,267,16

OBJECTIVE: In this brief communication we report four cases of Covid-19 who presented to our hospital with features suggestive of Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS). DISCUSSION: The mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 causes neurologic damage are multifaceted, including direct damage to specific receptors, cytokine-related injury, secondary hypoxia, and retrograde travel along nerve fibres. The pathogenesis of GBS secondary to Covid-19 is not well understood. It is hypothesised that viral illnesses related GBS could be due to autoantibodies or direct neurotoxic effects of viruses. CONCLUSION: Nervous system involvement in Covid-19 may have been grossly underestimated. In this era of pandemic, it is very important for the physicians to be aware of association of GBS with Covid-19, as early diagnosis and treatment of this complication could have gratifying results.

DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis. DATA SOURCES: Medline, bioRxiv, and medRxiv from 1 January to 30 April 2020, using subject headings or subheadings combined with text words for the concepts of covid-19 and serological tests for covid-19. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA AND DATA ANALYSIS: Eligible studies measured sensitivity or specificity, or both of a covid-19 serological test compared with a reference standard of viral culture or reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Studies were excluded with fewer than five participants or samples. Risk of bias was assessed using quality assessment of diagnostic accuracy studies 2 (QUADAS-2). Pooled sensitivity and specificity were estimated using random effects bivariate meta-analyses. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was overall sensitivity and specificity, stratified by method of serological testing (enzyme linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs), lateral flow immunoassays (LFIAs), or chemiluminescent immunoassays (CLIAs)) and immunoglobulin class (IgG, IgM, or both). Secondary outcomes were stratum specific sensitivity and specificity within subgroups defined by study or participant characteristics, including time since symptom onset. RESULTS: 5016 references were identified and 40 studies included. 49 risk of bias assessments were carried out (one for each population and method evaluated). High risk of patient selection bias was found in 98% (48/49) of assessments and high or unclear risk of bias from performance or interpretation of the serological test in 73% (36/49). Only 10% (4/40) of studies included outpatients. Only two studies evaluated tests at the point of care. For each method of testing, pooled sensitivity and specificity were not associated with the immunoglobulin class measured. The pooled sensitivity of ELISAs measuring IgG or IgM was 84.3% (95% confidence interval 75.6% to 90.9%), of LFIAs was 66.0% (49.3% to 79.3%), and of CLIAs was 97.8% (46.2% to 100%). In all analyses, pooled sensitivity was lower for LFIAs, the potential point-of-care method. Pooled specificities ranged from 96.6% to 99.7%. Of the samples used for estimating specificity, 83% (10 465/12 547) were from populations tested before the epidemic or not suspected of having covid-19. Among LFIAs, pooled sensitivity of commercial kits (65.0%, 49.0% to 78.2%) was lower than that of non-commercial tests (88.2%, 83.6% to 91.3%). Heterogeneity was seen in all analyses. Sensitivity was higher at least three weeks after symptom onset (ranging from 69.9% to 98.9%) compared with within the first week (from 13.4% to 50.3%). CONCLUSION: Higher quality clinical studies assessing the diagnostic accuracy of serological tests for covid-19 are urgently needed.

Although how carbon emission will change the world after the COVID-19 pandemic is unknown, it is urgent to learn from the past and avert or slow down the potential rebound effect. Therefore, this study is aimed to identify key drivers of carbon intensity changes of 55 sectors, applying the decomposition techniques and the world input-output data. Our results demonstrate that global carbon intensity fluctuations are drastically shocked by the global financial crisis, presenting an inversed-V shape for the period 2008-2011. Industrial carbon emission and gross output vary among different industries, the growth rate of industrial carbon intensity varies from -55.55% to 23.77%. The energy intensity effect and economic structure effect have opposite impacts on carbon intensity decrease, accelerating and hindering the decreasing carbon intensity, respectively. However, the energy mix effect has a minor impact on carbon intensity decrease. The industrial carbon intensity decomposition results show the impact of technological and structural factors are significantly different among industries. Moreover, the impact of energy intensity is slightly stronger than the energy mix. More measures targeting avoiding the rebound in carbon intensity should be developed.","Wang, Qiang Wang Shasha Jiang Xue-ting",Sustainable Production and Consumption,267,16

During a follow-up of 189 days (interquartile range (IQR) 172-195), 11 HCWs (29%) had an RT-PCR-positive test (n = 9) or seroconverted (n = 2). Median duration of symptoms was 2 days (IQR 0-7), and time to negative RT-PCR was 9 days (IQR 4-10). Notably, six incident infections (55%) occurred in HCWs with a pre-existing T-cell response (30% of those with a cellular response), who showed a significantly lower duration of symptoms (three were asymptomatic). Three of the six HCWs having a previous T-cell response continued to test seronegative. All the infected patients developed a robust T-cell response to different structural SARS-CoV-2 proteins, especially to protein S (91%). CONCLUSION: A pre-existing T-cell response does not seem to reduce incident SARS-CoV-2 infections, but it may contribute to asymptomatic or mild disease, rapid viral clearance and differences in seroconversion.","Casado, José L; Häemmerle, Johannes; Vizcarra, Pilar; Velasco, Hector; Velasco, Tamara; Fernandez-Escribano, Marina; Vallejo, Alejandro",Clin Microbiol Infect,267,29

Countries are seeing measures they would have never considered under democratic governance in an attempt to contain case numbers. The role of outside air temperatures have been implicated as a potential factor involved in disease transmission. However, to this date, there has been no clear evidence to suggest either way. Along with temperatures, infection control and protection measures as well as how well people adopt these measures are likely to play a role in disease transmission and case growth rates seen across countries. METHODS: The current study uses panel data estimation for the original EU-15 countries in an attempt to explain the role of outside air temperatures, health behavior and government-imposed containment measures on Covid-19 transmission rates. RESULTS: The preliminary evidence suggests that containment measures are highly effective in slowing down the spread of Covid-19. Years of education also appears to have a small but negative association with disease transmission rates suggesting that populations with higher educational attainments may be doing a better job of self-protection. Temperature appears to have a very small, but statistically significant impact on the viral transmission rate where a 1 °C increase in temperatures is estimated to reduce Covid-19 transmission by 0.9 percent. CONCLUSION: Results are robust and clear. Temperature plays a small but significant role on Covid-19 transmission rates. However, it is quite possible that we may not have yet reached temperatures which may exert more pronounced effects on viral activity. Further research is warranted when more data becomes available, especially covering the months of July and August.","Ozyigit, Ahmet",Infect Dis Health,267,29

The objective was to describe these patients' pulmonary function and establish an association with the severity of the disease (patients with severe or critical pneumonia), the presence of comorbidities, the tomographic involvement and the persistence of dyspnoea. Fifty-five patients were included, 40 (73%) male, media of age 54.9 (11.6) years old and body mass index (BMI) 33.1 (6.09) kg/ m2. Fifty (90%) had 1 comorbidity, obesity 67%, arterial hypertension 36%, and diabetes mellitus 35%. Twentyfive (45%) had critical pneumonia. Fifteen (27%) had a spirometric alteration that suggested restriction and 32 (58%) had gas exchange defect. The latter had forced volume capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV1) and carbon monoxide diffusion capacity (DLCO) values significantly lower. Ninety percent presented some degree of involvement in the chest CT scan, ground glass-opacities the most frequent finding. A moderate negative correlation was found between the severity of the tomographic involvement and the DLCO levels. Thirty patients (55%) referred some degree of dyspnoea. Patients with this symptom had DLCO and KCO values below those who did not have dyspnoea: 70.5 vs. 85.1 p = 0.02 and 88 vs. 104 p = 0.02. The presence of abnormal gas exchange is the main characteristic of patients with pulmonary sequelae due to COVID-19.

TIPS identifies key pathways which contribute to a process of interest, as well as the individual genes that best reflect these changes. TIPS also provides insight into the relative timing of pathway changes, as well as a suite of visualizations to enable simplified data interpretation of scRNAseq libraries generated using a wide range of techniques. The TIPS package can be run through either a web server or downloaded as a user-friendly GUI run in R, and may serve as a useful tool to help biologists perform deeper functional analyses and visualization of their single-cell data.","Zheng, Zihan; Qiu, Xin; Wu, Haiyang; Chang, Ling; Tang, Xiangyu; Zou, Liyun; Li, Jingyi; Wu, Yuzhang; Zhou, Jianzhi; Jiang, Shan; Wan, Ying; Ni, Qingshan",Brief. bioinform,267,1

It facilitates novel ways of protecting both population health and the natural environment on which human health and well-being depends. This paper focuses on the climate crisis as an example of the relationship between environmental change, healthcare, and education. We analyze how HPE can help decarbonize the healthcare sector to address both climate change and inequity in health outcomes. Based on the healthcare practitioner's mandate of beneficence, we propose simple learning objectives to equip HPE graduates with the knowledge, skills, and values to create a sustainable health system, using carbon emission reductions as an example. These learning objectives can be integrated into HPE without adding unduly to the curriculum load.","Barna, Stefi; Maric, Filip; Simons, Julia; Kumar, Shashank; Blankestijn, Peter J",Med Teach,267,1

However, this method is expensive, time-consuming, and not easily available in straitened regions. An interpretable and COVID-19 diagnosis AI framework is devised and developed based on the cough sounds features and symptoms metadata to overcome these limitations. The proposed framework's performance was evaluated using a medical dataset containing Symptoms and Demographic data of 30000 audio segments, 328 cough sounds from 150 patients with four cough classes (COVID-19, Asthma, Bronchitis, and Healthy). Experiments' results show that the model captures the better and robust feature embedding to distinguish between COVID-19 patient coughs and several types of non-COVID-19 coughs with higher specificity and accuracy of 95.04 ± 0.18% and 96.83 ± 0.18% respectively, all the while maintaining interpretability. © 2021 Owner/Author.","Pal, A.; Sankarasubbu, M.",Proc ACM Symp Appl Computing,267,2

Group testing could be a promising candidate for screening to save time and resources. However, due to the high false-negative rate (FNR) of the RT-PCR diagnostic test, we should be cautious about using group testing because a group's false-negative result identifies all the individuals in a group as uninfected. Repeating the test is the best solution to reduce the FNR, and repeats should be integrated with the group-testing method to increase the sensitivity of the test. The simplest way is to replicate the test twice for each group (the 2Rgt method). In this paper, we present a new method for group testing (the groupMix method), which integrates two repeats in the test. Then we introduce the 2-stage sequential version of both the groupMix and the 2Rgt methods. We compare these methods analytically regarding the sensitivity and the average number of tests. The tradeoff between the sensitivity and the average number of tests should be considered when choosing the best method for the screening strategy. We applied the groupMix method to screening 263 people and identified 2 infected individuals by performing 98 tests. This method achieved a 63% saving in the number of tests compared to individual testing. Our experimental results show that in COVID-19 screening, the viral load can be low, and the group size should not be more than 6;otherwise, the FNR increases significantly. A web interface of the groupMix method is publicly available for laboratories to implement this method.","Alizad-Rahvar, A. R.; Vafadar, S.; Totonchi, M.; Sadeghi, M.",Frontiers in Medicine,267,5

The evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic in several countries (China, Spain, Italy, France, UK, Iran, USA and Germany) shows a similar behavior in concord with the D-model trend, characterized by a rapid increase of death cases followed by a slow decline, which are affected by the earliness and efficiency of the lockdown effect.

It is responsible for significant morbidity and has had severe socioeconomic consequences. This study aims to assess the knowledge, preparedness and attitudes of medical students, physicians and faculty members in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) on COVID-19 and their perspective on the roles of educational and healthcare institution towards improving pandemic preparedness and enabling optimal care. METHODOLOGY: An exploratory, descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted with 444 participants, using a non-probability convenience sampling method. English-speaking participants from the medical field aged 18 and above were included in the study. The validated questionnaire was administered online and distributed across social media platforms from May-July 2020. T-test, ANOVA, Kruskal-Wallis test and Mann-Whitney-U test were used when appropriate. Responses were analysed and statistical tests applied using IBM SPSS, version 25. RESULTS: The knowledge scores were calculated amongst different ages and professional status, and the mean was 59.08% (SD = 12.848%). Almost half of the participants obtained poor knowledge scores (less than 60%). Most of the participants followed the latest updates on COVID-19 (86.7%). The majority opted to obtain information from the national health authorities (63.4%). The mean preparedness score among the participants was 68.65% (SD = 17.456%). Being in contact with patients significantly increased the preparedness score (p < 0.001). Only 27.9% of the participants believed their college education provided adequate knowledge to deal with epidemics or pandemics. Several barriers affect willingness to work in a pandemic, with 80.6% of participants worried about posing a risk to family members. CONCLUSION: This study highlights the importance of establishing tailored COVID-19 related education programs to improve knowledge levels, especially in medical students.

This article examines how the Goodling Institute for Research in Family Literacy at The Pennsylvania State University in the United States has responded to the pandemic by converting its face-to-face family literacy classes into emergency remote instruction using online platforms. Serving eight immigrant families in 2019-2020 who live in the State College area in central Pennsylvania, the Family Pathways programme includes adult education, parent education and interactive parent-child literacy activities. The article discusses how teachers created online learning opportunities for parents and children to learn together, the strategies and resources instructors used to teach remotely, how challenges such as discomfort with technology were addressed, and what has been learned from the experience. Although COVID-19 presents unprecedented challenges for educators and learners in family literacy programmes more broadly, it has also compelled instructors in this particular programme to use remote instruction creatively and has revealed the critical importance of family literacy programmes as an educational support system for low-income and immigrant families.","Kaiper-Marquez, Anna; Wolfe, Emily; Clymer, Carol; Lee, Jungeun; McLean, Elisabeth Grinder; Prins, Esther; Stickel, Tabitha",Int Rev Educ,267,24

In this short review, we discuss the evidence for remote healthcare delivery in the context of osteoporosis. INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 pandemic has undoubtedly had, and will continue to have, a significant impact on the lives of people living with, and at risk of, osteoporosis and those caring for them. With osteoporosis outpatient and Fracture Liaison Services on pause, healthcare organisations have already moved to delivering new and follow-up consultations remotely, where staffing permits, by telephone or video. METHODS: In this review, we consider different models of remote care delivery, the evidence for their use, and the possible implications of COVID-19 on osteoporosis services. RESULTS: Telemedicine is a global term used to describe any use of telecommunication systems to deliver healthcare from a distance and encompasses a range of different scenarios from remote clinical data transfer to remote clinician-patient interactions. Across a range of conditions and contexts, there remains unclear evidence on the acceptability of telemedicine and the effect on healthcare costs. Within the context of osteoporosis management, there is some limited evidence to suggest telemedicine approaches are acceptable to patients but unclear evidence on whether telemedicine approaches support informed drug adherence. Gaps in the evidence pertain to the acceptability and benefits of using telemedicine in populations with hearing, cognitive, or visual impairments and in those with limited health literacy. CONCLUSION: There is an urgent need for further health service evaluation and research to address the impact of remote healthcare delivery during COVID-19 outbreak on patient care, and in the longer term, to identify acceptability and cost- and clinical-effectiveness of remote care delivery on outcomes of relevance to people living with osteoporosis.","Paskins, Z; Crawford-Manning, F; Bullock, L; Jinks, C",Osteoporos Int,267,26

We conducted empirical analyses using linear regression, a time-varying effect model, and a regression discontinuity design to investigate the association of medical resources with the mortality rate of the COVID-19 patients in Hubei, China. The results showed that the numbers of hospital beds, healthcare system beds, and medical staff per confirmed cases all had significant negative effects on the coronavirus disease mortality rate. Furthermore, in the context of the severe pandemic currently being experienced worldwide, the present study summarized the experience and implications in pandemic prevention and control in Hubei province from the perspective of medical resource integration as follows: First, hospitals' internal medical resources were integrated, breaking interdepartmental barriers. Second, joint pandemic control was realized by integrating regional healthcare system resources. Finally, an external medical resource allocation system was developed.","Xie, Lin; Yang, Hualei; Zheng, Xiaodong; Wu, Yuanyang; Lin, Xueyu; Shen, Zheng",PLoS One,267,21

A breakthrough C-ITS technological solution was studied, designed, built and tested that is based on the implementation of custom low-cost on-road platforms (named “strips”) that embed micro/nano sensors, communication technologies and energy harvesting to shift intelligence from the vehicle to the road infrastructure. The strips, through a V2X and LTE communication gateway, transmit real-time, reliable and accurate information at lane level about the environmental and road condition, the traffic and the other road users’ position and speed. The exchanged information supports a series of C-ITS functions and services extending equipped vehicles capabilities and providing similar functions to non-equipped ones (including powered two wheelers).

We report here that ACE2 is highly expressed in adult bone marrow, adipose tissue or umbilical cord-derived MSC. On the other hand, placenta-derived MSC express low levels of ACE2 but only in early passages of cultures. MSC derived from human embryonic stem cell (hESC) or human induced pluripotent stem cells (hIPSC) express also very low levels of ACE2.

This paper aims to study and design a credit risk assessment system based on big data technology and machine learning algorithms. It is hoped that the system will enhance the bank's ability to identify the credit risks of small and medium-sized enterprises, so as to solve the problem of difficult and expensive financing for small and medium-sized enterprises. At the same time, it will reduce the bank's own bad loan ratio and increase profit margins. Achieving a win-win situation for small and medium-sized enterprises and banks, it's crucial to promote jointly the development of economy. © 2021 IEEE.","Wen, S.; Zeng, B.; Liao, W.; Wei, P.; Pan, Z.","6th IEEE International Conference on Big Data Analytics, ICBDA 2021",267,33

The accuracy and reliability of abnormal ECG (AECG) decision depend to a large extent on the feature extraction. However, it is often uneasy or even impossible to obtain accurate features, as the detection process of ECG is easily disturbed by the external environment. And AECG got many species and great variation. What’s more, the ECG result obtained after a long time past, which can not reach the purpose of early warning or real-time disease diagnosis. Therefore, developing an intelligent classification model with an accurate feature extraction method to identify AECG is of quite significance. This study aimed to explore an accurate feature extraction method of ECG and establish a suitable model for identifying AECG and the diagnosis of heart disease. METHODS: In this research, the wavelet combined with four operations and adaptive threshold methods were applied to filter the ECG and extract its feature waves first. Then, a BP neural network (BPNN) intelligent model and a particle swarm optimization (PSO) improved BPNN (PSO-BPNN) intelligent model based on MIT-BIH open database was established to identify ECG. To reduce the complexity of the model, the principal component analysis (PCA) was used to minimize the feature dimension. RESULTS: Wavelet transforms combined four operations and adaptive threshold methods were capable of ECG filtering and feature extraction. PCA can significantly deduce the modeling feature dimension to minimize the complexity and save classification time. The PSO-BPNN intelligent model was suitable for identifying five types of ECG and showed better effects while comparing it with the BPNN model. CONCLUSION: In summary, it was further concluded that the PSO-BPNN intelligent model would be a suitable way to identify AECG and provide a tool for the diagnosis of heart disease.","Li, Guixiang; Tan, Zhongwei; Xu, Weikang; Xu, Fei; Wang, Lei; Chen, Jun; Wu, Kai",BMC Med Inform Decis Mak,267,1

RESULTS: Twenty two (22%) out of the 100 NPA specimens of the patients with respiratory manifestations were positive for HBoV by qualitative PCR, while ELISA revealed positive HBoV IgM antibodies in 18 (18%) patients who were also positive by PCR. Non of the controls were positive by both techniques. The correlation study between ELISA and PCR revealed high significant association, (p < 0.001, X(2 )= 36 and agreement = 96%). Also PCR detected 4 (18.1%) NPA samples as HBoV positive cases among the patients that were not identified by ELISA. This could be due to high sensitivity and efficacy of PCR. ELISA being less sensitive than RT-PCR, sensitivity was (81.8% vs 100%), the efficacy was 97.7% in ELISA versus 99.7% for RT-PCR.

Early research has suggested that pre-existing fatty liver disease may be a significant risk factor for hospitalisation. Liver fat, in particular, is a modifiable parameter and can be a target for public health policy and individual patient plans. In this study we aimed to assess pre-existing liver disease as a risk factor for developing symptomatic COVID-19. Methods From 502,506 participants from the UK Biobank, 42,146 underwent MRI (aged 45-82), and had measures of liver fat, liver fibroinflammatory disease and liver iron. Patients were censored on May 28th to determine how many had tested for COVID-19 with symptomatic disease. UK testing was restricted to those with symptoms in hospital. COVID-19 symptoms included fever, dry cough, sore throat, diarrhoea and fatigue. Univariate analysis was performed on liver phenotypic biomarkers to determine if these variables increased risk of symptomatic COVID-19, and compared to previously described risk factors associated with severe COVID-19, including to age, ethnicity, gender and obesity, Findings Increased liver fat was associated with a higher risk for symptomatic confirmed COVID-19 in this population in univariate analysis(OR:1.85, p=0.03). In obese participants, only those with concomitant fatty liver([≥]10%) were at increased risk(OR:2.96, p=0.02), with those having normal liver fat (<5%) showing no increased risk(OR:0.36, p=0.09). Conclusions UK Biobank data demonstrated an association between pre-existing liver disease and obesity with severe COVID-19, with higher proportions of liver fat in obese individuals a likely risk factor for symptomatic disease and severity. Public policy measures to protect patients with liver disease who may have almost double the risk of the general population should be considered, especially as dietary and pharmacological strategies to reduce body weight and liver fat already exist.

The disease can cause life-threatening conditions and it presents challenges for medical education, as instructors must deliver lectures safely, while ensuring the integrity and continuity of the medical education process. It is therefore important to assess the usability of online learning methods, and to determine their feasibility and adequacy for medical students. We aimed to provide an overview of the situation experienced by medical students during the COVID-19 pandemic, and to determine the knowledge, attitudes, and practices of medical students regarding electronic medical education. A cross-sectional survey was conducted with medical students from more than 13 medical schools in Libya. A paper-based and online survey was conducted using email and social media. The survey requested demographic and socioeconomic information, as well as information related to medical online learning and electronic devices; medical education status during the COVID-19 pandemic; mental health assessments; and e-learning knowledge, attitudes, and practices. A total of 3,348 valid questionnaires were retrieved. Most respondents (64.7%) disagreed that e-learning could be implemented easily in Libya. While 54.1% of the respondents agreed that interactive discussion is achievable by means of e-learning. However, only 21.1% agreed that e-learning could be used for clinical aspects, as compared with 54.8% who disagreed with this statement and 24% who were neutral. Only 27.7% of the respondents had participated in online medical educational programs during the COVID-19 pandemic, while 65% reported using the internet for participating in study groups and discussions. There is no vaccine for COVID-19 yet. As such, the pandemic will undeniably continue to disrupt medical education and training. As we face the prospect of a second wave of virus transmission, we must take certain measures and make changes to minimize the effects of the COVID-19 outbreak on medical education and on the progression of training. The time for change is now, and there should be support and enthusiasm for providing valid solutions to reduce this disruption, such as online training and virtual clinical experience. These measures could then be followed by hands-on experience that is provided in a safe environment.","Alsoufi, Ahmed; Alsuyihili, Ali; Msherghi, Ahmed; Elhadi, Ahmed; Atiyah, Hana; Ashini, Aimen; Ashwieb, Arwa; Ghula, Mohamed; Ben Hasan, Hayat; Abudabuos, Salsabil; Alameen, Hind; Abokhdhir, Taqwa; Anaiba, Mohamed; Nagib, Taha; Shuwayyah, Anshirah; Benothman, Rema; Arrefae, Ghalea; Alkhwayildi, Abdulwajid; Alhadi, Abdulmueti; Zaid, Ahmed; Elhadi, Muhammed",PLoS One,267,29

Especially in university institutions as maximum care providers, a higher exposure to potentially infectious patients or actual COVID-19 patients is to be expected. In a short period of time, an operational concept had to be developed regarding the current hygiene recommendations of the Robert Koch Institute (RKI), the leading medical societies and the internal hospital hygiene plan. Here, patient safety and employee protection are equally important. In cooperation with the Institute for Medical Microbiology and Hospital Hygiene and the occupational medical service, interventions were defined to develop solutions to minimize the COVID-19 transmission risk for examiners and patients despite limited diagnostic and equipment resources. For this purpose, an operational concept was developed, consisting of various individual actions, e. g. the reduction of outpatient treatment to emergencies, life-threatening diseases and urgent aftercare, a double triage of patients and the introduction of treatment teams. The newly developed operational concept was successfully implemented within a few days. After the initial rollout and several “hygiene inspections” only minor improvements to the concept were necessary. All measures were documented in the internal quality handbook and are accessible to all employees.

Overt expression of PTX3 in CHIKV patients was associated with increased viral load and disease severity. PTX3-deficient (PTX3(-/-)) mice acutely infected with RRV exhibited delayed disease progression and rapid recovery through diminished inflammatory responses and viral replication.

On the other hand, a more constructive approach, is to capture and understand the work that was actually done.This would include normal activities, as well as positive adaptations to challenges and failures that may have occurred. Such an approach aimed at improving what worked, rather than blaming people for what went wrong, has the potential to contribute more successfully to controlling the consequences of the current crisis. Such an approach should thus be aimed at detecting and feeding back lessons from emerging and probably unexpected behaviours and helping to design the system to adapt better to counter the effects. The science and discipline of Human Factors (HF) promotes system resilience. This can be defined as an organisation's ability to adjust its functioning before, during or after significant disturbances (such as a pandemic), enabling adaptation and operation under both anticipated and unanticipated circumstances. A “functional” approach methodology enables the identification of where the system and its various interdependent functions (an activity or set of activities that are required to give a certain output), could be improved and strengthened; if not immediately, at least for the future. Along these lines, suggestions for adding key resilience functions are additionally identified and outlined. The application and insights gained from this functional approach to the 2015 MERS-Cov pandemic in South Korea has been seen as contributing substantially to the effective response to the current crisis in that country (Min, submitted for publication). In this paper, we present an overarching framework for a series of projects that are planned to carry out focussed systems-based analysis to generate learning from key aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic response in the United Kingdom.","Slater, David; Hollnagel, Erik; MacKinnon, Ralph; Sujan, Mark; Carson-Stevens, Andrew; Ross, Alistair; Bowie, Paul",Saf Sci,267,22

Since the 3a protein localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-Golgi compartment, its role in causing ER stress was investigated in transiently transfected cells. Cells expressing the 3a proteins showed ER stress based on activation of genes for the ER chaperones GRP78 and GRP94. Since ER stress can cause differential modulation of the unfolded protein response (UPR), which includes the inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE-1), activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6) and PKR-like ER kinase (PERK) pathways, these were individually tested in 3a-expressing cells. Only the PERK pathway was found to be activated in 3a-expressing cells based on (1) increased phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 alpha (eIF2α) and inhibitory effects of a dominant-negative form of eIF2α on GRP78 promoter activity, (2) increased translation of activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) mRNA, and (3) ATF4-dependent activation of the C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) gene promoter. Activation of PERK affects innate immunity by suppression of type 1 interferon (IFN) signaling. The 3a protein was found to induce serine phosphorylation within the IFN alpha-receptor subunit 1 (IFNAR1) degradation motif and to increase IFNAR1 ubiquitination. Confocal microscopic analysis showed increased translocation of IFNAR1 into the lysosomal compartment and flow cytometry showed reduced levels of IFNAR1 in 3a-expressing cells. These results provide further mechanistic details of the pro-apoptotic effects of the SARS-CoV 3a protein, and suggest a potential role for it in attenuating interferon responses and innate immunity.","Minakshi, Rinki; Padhan, Kartika; Rani, Manjusha; Khan, Nabab; Ahmad, Faizan; Jameel, Shahid",PLoS One,267,16

To achieve the economic and functional production of CVN, the CVN N-terminally fused with CL7(A mutant of the Colicin E7 Dnase) was utilized to improve the solubility and stability of CVN fusion protein (CL7-CVN). Additionally, to improve the detection limit of existing PRV diagnostic assays, CL7-CVN was used for Pseudorabies virus (PRV) enrichment from larger sample volumes. RESULTS: CVN fused with CL7 was efficiently expressed at a level of ~ 40% of the total soluble protein in E. coli by optimizing the induction conditions. Also, the stability of CVN fusion protein was enhanced, and 10 mg of CVN with a purity of ~ 99% were obtained from 1 g of cells by one-step affinity purification with the digestion of HRV 3C protease. Moreover, both purified CVN and CL7-CVN could effectively inhibit the infection of PRV to PK15 cells. Considering the bioactivity of CL7-CVN, we explored a strategy for PRV enrichment from larger samples. CONCLUSIONS: CL7 effectively promoted the soluble expression of CVN fusion protein and improved its stability, which was meaningful for its purification and application. The design of CVN fusion protein provides an efficient approach for the economical and functional production of CVN and a new strategy for PRV enrichment.

The dural compartment of the meninges, closest to the skull, is predominantly composed of fibroblasts, but also includes fenestrated blood vasculature, an elaborate lymphatic system, as well as immune cells which are distinct from the CNS. Segregating the outer and inner meningeal compartments is the epithelial-like arachnoid barrier cells, connected by tight and adherens junctions, which regulate the movement of pathogens, molecules, and cells into and out of the cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) and brain parenchyma. Most proximate to the brain is the collagen and basement membrane-rich pia matter that abuts the glial limitans and has recently be shown to have regional heterogeneity within the developing mouse brain. While the meninges were historically seen as a purely structural support for the CNS and protection from trauma, the emerging view of the meninges is as an essential interface between the CNS and the periphery, critical to brain development, required for brain homeostasis, and involved in a variety of diseases. In this review, we will summarize what is known regarding the development, specification, and maturation of the meninges during homeostatic conditions and discuss the rapidly emerging evidence that specific meningeal cell compartments play differential and important roles in the pathophysiology of a myriad of diseases including: multiple sclerosis, dementia, stroke, viral/bacterial meningitis, traumatic brain injury, and cancer. We will conclude with a list of major questions and mechanisms that remain unknown, the study of which represent new, future directions for the field of meninges biology.","Derk, Julia; Jones, Hannah E.; Como, Christina; Pawlikowski, Bradley; Siegenthaler, Julie A.",Front Cell Neurosci,267,20

DATA SOURCES: The search was carried out in June 2020 in the following databases: Biblioteca Virtual em Saúde (BVS), periódico da CAPES and U.S National Library of Medicine (PubMed). The combination of descriptors used was [(COVID-19 OR SARS-CoV-2) AND (Kawasaki disease)], and the inclusion criteria stipulated were studies published from January 2019 to June 2020, without restriction of language or location, and available online in full. News, editorials, comments, and letters, as well as duplicates and articles that did not answer the guiding question were excluded. DATA SYNTHESIS: A total of 97 articles were identified, of which seven comprised this review. The association of KD to the new coronavirus appears to trigger a severe clinical condition of vasculitis. Different from the usual, in this inflammatory syndrome, patients are older, and prevalence is higher in children from African or Caribbean ancestry; clinical and laboratory manifestations are also atypical, with a predominance of abdominal complaints and exaggerated elevation of inflammatory markers. In addition, there was a greater report of rare complications and greater resistance to the recommended treatment for KD. CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric COVID-19 and its potential association to severe KD, still unfamiliar to health professionals, reinforces the importance of testing patients with vasculitis for the new coronavirus and the need to wage high surveillance and preparation of the health system during the current pandemic.","dos Santos, Bruna Silva; dos Santos, Fernanda Silva; Ribeiro, Elaine Rossi",Rev Paul Pediatr,267,10

Millions of people are immune-suppressed and may not be able to mount a fully protective immune response after vaccination. There is also an increasingly critical need for a drug to cover emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants, against which existing vaccines may be less effective. Here, we describe the evolution of molnupiravir (EIDD-2801, MK-4482), a broad-spectrum antiviral agent originally designed for the treatment of Alphavirus infections, into a potential drug for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19. When the pandemic began, molnupiravir was in pre-clinical development for the treatment of seasonal influenza. As COVID-19 spread, the timeline for the development program was moved forward significantly, and focus shifted to treatment of coronavirus infections. Real time consultation with regulatory authorities aided in making the acceleration of the program possible.","Painter, George R; Natchus, Michael G; Cohen, Oren; Holman, Wendy; Painter, Wendy P",Curr Opin Virol,267,10

Although reopening K-12 schools for in-person schooling is desirable for many reasons, officials understand that risk reduction strategies and detection of cases are imperative in creating a safe return to school. Furthermore, consequences of reclosing recently opened schools are substantial and impact teachers, parents, and ultimately educational experiences in children. To address competing interests in meeting educational needs with public safety, we compare the impact of physical separation through school cohorts on SARS-CoV-2 infections against policies acting at the level of individual contacts within classrooms. Using an age-stratified Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Removed model, we explore influences of reduced class density, transmission mitigation, and viral detection on cumulative prevalence. We consider several scenarios over a 6-month period including (1) multiple rotating cohorts in which students cycle through in-person instruction on a weekly basis, (2) parallel cohorts with in-person and remote learning tracks, (3) the impact of a hypothetical testing program with ideal and imperfect detection, and (4) varying levels of aggregate transmission reduction. Our mathematical model predicts that reducing the number of contacts through cohorts produces a larger effect than diminishing transmission rates per contact. Specifically, the latter approach requires dramatic reduction in transmission rates in order to achieve a comparable effect in minimizing infections over time. Further, our model indicates that surveillance programs using less sensitive tests may be adequate in monitoring infections within a school community by both keeping infections low and allowing for a longer period of instruction. Lastly, we underscore the importance of factoring infection prevalence in deciding when a local outbreak of infection is serious enough to require reverting to remote learning.","Landeros, Alfonso; Ji, Xiang; Lange, Kenneth; Stutz, Timothy C.; Xu, Jason; Sehl, Mary E.; Sinsheimer, Janet S.",PLoS One,267,33

METHODS: All third‐ and fourth‐year undergraduate dental students within a dental geriatric module were asked to provide a written guided reflection on the question: “In your opinion, what factors make outbreaks (or pandemics) like COVID‐19 relevant to the practice of dental geriatrics?” Reflections were gathered from March 12 to May 8, 2020. Thematic analysis was conducted to identify and interpret patterns of meaning within the reflections by means of an interactive coding process. RESULTS: A total of 115 reflections, between 291 and 710 words each, were received from 56 third‐year (62.5% male) and 59 fourth‐year (42.6% male) students. Five main themes emerged: experiencing uncertainties, frailty as a moderator, constraints in accessing care, preparedness protocol, and redefining care. The frequency in which the same codes, categories, and themes were assigned varied from 16 to 140 times. CONCLUSIONS: Students’ reflections highlighted the effects of the pandemic, not only on their education but also on frail older adults themselves and the profession of dentistry in general. Further studies are warranted to explore how this curtailment might impact educators’ approaches to geriatric education, as well as the way graduating students will set up their practices and approach geriatric care in the future.","Brondani, Mario; Donnelly, Leeann",J Dent Educ,267,6

However, the prevalence of social isolation during the pandemic has not been well studied, particularly among Asian populations. This study investigated changes in the prevalence of social isolation caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and examined its association with mental health among the general Japanese population. Data were obtained from a large-scale, web-based nationwide survey conducted from August to September 2020 (n = 28,000; aged 15–79 years). Social isolation was defined as less frequent contact with people other than co-residing family members. We assessed the participants’ frequency of contact in January (before the pandemic) and August 2020 (during the pandemic). Mental health outcomes included psychological distress, suicidal ideation, loneliness, and fear of COVID-19. We analyzed the data of 25,482 respondents. The weighted prevalence (95% confidence interval) of social isolation was 21.2% (20.7–21.7%) and 27.9% (27.3–28.4%) before and during the pandemic, respectively. The prevalence of social isolation increased by 6.7 (6.3–7.0) percentage points during the pandemic. Older people and men had the greatest increase in the prevalence of social isolation. People who became socially isolated during the pandemic had greater loneliness and fear of COVID-19 than those who were consistently not socially isolated since before the pandemic. This study suggested that social isolation had increased during the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan. Our findings highlight the importance of developing immediate measures against social isolation to maintain good mental health.","Murayama, Hiroshi; Okubo, Ryo; Tabuchi, Takahiro",Int J Environ Res Public Health,267,28

Polyethylene glycol (PEG) has been suggested as the most probable culprit agent for allergic reactions. OBJECTIVE We describe the allergy work-up protocol implemented for the vaccination campaign in our Center, aiming to allow the greatest number of people to be vaccinated safely. METHODS the protocol included the self-report of a history of suspected drug or vaccine allergies, and subsequent teleconsultation and allergometric tests for PEG and Polysorbate 80 (PS80). A desensitizing protocol of vaccine administration was applied to patients sensitized only to PS80, and to those with a suspect allergic reaction after the first vaccine dose. RESULTS 10.2% (414 out of 4042) of the entire vaccine population have been screened: only one patient resulted allergic to PEG and therefore excluded from the vaccination. Another patient was sensitized to PS80 only and safely vaccinated applying the desensitizing protocol. Seven subjects without a previous history of allergic disease experienced suspect hypersensitivity reactions to the first administered dose: one of them resulted allergic to PEG and was excluded from the second dose, while the others safely completed the vaccination with the desensitizing protocol. CONCLUSION a careful allergological risk-assessment protocol significantly reduces the number of patients who would have avoided SARS-CoV-2 vaccination for their allergies and to effectively identify and manage those rare patients with sensitization to PEGs and/or PS80.","Paoletti, Giovanni; Racca, Francesca; Piona, Alessandra; Melone, Giulio; Merigo, Morena; Puggioni, Francesca; Ferri, Sebastian; Azzolini, Elena; Lagioia, Michele; Lamacchia, Donatella; Cataldo, Giuseppe; Cecconi, Maurizio; Canonica, Giorgio Walter; Heffler, Enrico",World Allergy Organ J,267,22

Methods: We conducted an explanatory sequential mixed methods study with integration at the design and methods level. Phase 1 was a cross-sectional analysis of general and specialty pediatric ambulatory encounters to profile the use of video visits by patient characteristics. We performed descriptive analyses for each variable of interest and estimated a multivariable logistic regression model to analyze factors associated with the odds of having a video visit. Phase 2 was a qualitative exploration using semi-structured interviews with healthcare team members to understand the contextual factors influencing video visit usage. We used an interview guide to solicit information related to general perceptions about ambulatory video visits, reactions to the quantitative phase data, and strategies for optimizing equitable reach of video visits. Data were analyzed using a combination of deductive and inductive analysis. Results: Among the 5,464 pediatric ambulatory encounters completed between March 11 and June 30, 2020, 2,127 were video visits. Patient factors associated with lower odds of having a video visit rather than an in-person visit included being Spanish-speaking (aOR 0.27, 95% CI 0.20–0.37) and other non-English-speaking (aOR 0.50, 95% CI 0.34–0.75) in comparison to English-speaking. Patients with public insurance also had a lower odds of having a video visit in comparison to privately insured patients (aOR 0.77, 95% CI 0.67–0.88). Qualitative interviews identified five solution-based themes: (1) Promoting video visits in a way that reaches all patient families; (2) Offering video visits to all patient families; (3) Mitigating digital literacy barriers; (4) Expanding health system resources to support families' specific needs; and (5) Engaging and empowering health system personnel to expand video visit access. Conclusion: We identified differences in pediatric ambulatory video visit use by patient characteristics, with lower odds of video visit use among non-English-speaking and publicly insured patients. The mixed-methods approach allowed for the perspectives of our interview participants to contextualize the finding and lead to suggestions for improvement. Both our findings and the approach can be used by other health systems to ensure that all patients and families receive equal video visit access.","Rosenthal, Jennifer L.; O'Neal, Christina; Sanders, April; Fernandez y Garcia, Erik",Front Pediatr,267,11

While coronaviruses typically have low rates of neurotropic effects, the massive transmission of SARS-CoV-2 suggests that a substantial population will suffer from potential SARS-CoV-2-related neurological disorders. The rapid and recent emergence of SARS-CoV-2 means little research exists on its potential neurological effects. Here we analyze the effects of similar viruses to provide insight into the potential effects of SARS-CoV-2 on the nervous system and beyond. Seven coronavirus strains (HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2) can infect humans. Many of these strains cause neurological effects, such as headaches, dizziness, strokes, seizures, and critical illness polyneuropathy/myopathy. Certain studies have also linked coronaviruses with multiple sclerosis and extensive central nervous system injuries. Reviewing these studies provides insight into the anticipated effects for patients with SARS-CoV-2. This review will first describe the effects of other coronaviruses that have caused severe disease (SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV) on the nervous system, as well as their proposed origins, non-neurological effects, and neurological infection mechanisms. It will then discuss what is known about SARS-CoV-2 in these areas with reference to the aforementioned viruses, with the goal of providing a holistic picture of SARS-CoV-2.","Day, Colin; Studders, Carson; Arklie, Kim; Kaur, Asees; Teetzen, Kyra; Kirsch, Rebecca; Abelseth, Laila; Fraser, Ian; Abelseth, Emily; Willerth, Stephanie M",Reviews in the neurosciences,267,16

METHODS: SARS-CoV-2 testing and sequencing combines TaqPath CE-IVD COVID-19 RT-PCR with Ion AmpliSeq SARS-CoV-2 Next Generation Sequencing Assay. Retrospective analysis of test trending data was performed from initiation of testing on the 11th March through to the 14th April 2021. FINDINGS: During this time interval, 203,065 SARS-CoV-2 PCR tests were performed, with 3,855 samples testing positive, giving a prevalence of 1.9%. In total 1,913 SARS-CoV-2 genomes were sequenced from positive cases with Ct values < 30 and 1,635 (85.5%) sequences passed quality metrics for lineage analysis. A high diversity of 49 different SARS-CoV-2 variants were identified, including the VOCs B.1.1.7 (Kent; 80.6%), B.1.351 (South Africa; 4.2%), B.1.617.2 (India; 1.7%), P.1 (Brazil; 0.4%) and B.1.1.7 with E484K (Bristol; 0.2%). Vaccine effectiveness was age-related and dose-dependent, ranging from 5% in > 60 with a single dose to 83% in <60 with both doses of a vaccine. Viral load was variant dependent with the B.1.617.2 showing a 21 fold increase in viral copy number compared to the other variants. INTERPRETATION: The unexpectedly high prevalence of COVID-19 infection in UK arrivals is associated with a rich diversity of SARS-CoV-2 high risk variants entering the UK including the VOC B.1.617.2. Vaccination does not preclude infection and its effectiveness is significantly age-dependent and impacted by variant type. The rapid high-throughput test and sequence workflow we have adopted is particularly suited to the monitoring of cross border transmission and enables immediate public health interventions.

While securing PPE is a complex logistical challenge facing many countries, it is vital to recognise the social and health systems issues that structure the differential degrees of risk faced by various subgroups of healthcare workers. As an illustrative case study, the author identifies two key social factors that are likely to face the degrees of risk faced by midwives in the Special Region of Yogyakarta, Indonesia, if and when COVID-19 takes hold in Indonesia. Healthcare workers in both high and low resource-settings globally are likely to face particular risks and vulnerabilities that are shaped by localized social and health systems factors.

This study assessed the extent to which the general population in Belgium adhered to these measures, and which determinants were associated with adherence. METHODS: We undertook an internet survey among a sample of the Belgian population, representative for sex, age, socio-economic status and province. The questionnaire included various demographic, socio-economic and health-related questions, and also drew upon the Protection Motivation Theory as a theoretical framework to measure levels of perceived severity, vulnerability, perceived usefulness of the measures (response efficacy), perceived personal capacity to adhere (self-efficacy), and past and future adherence. Data were collected in Dutch and French, the main languages of Belgium. RESULTS: Our study was carried out in September 2020, and the number of respondents was 2008. On average, respondents provided high scores for each of the measures in place in September in terms of response efficacy (range of 3.54–4.32 on 1 to 5 Likert-scale), self-efficacy (range of 3.00–4.00), past adherence (4.00–4.68) and future adherence (3.99–4.61). The measure that overall received the highest scores was wearing a face mask in public spaces, while ‘the social bubble of 5’ generally received the lowest scores. There was a statistically significant relationship between response efficacy and self-efficacy on the one hand and (past and future) adherence on the other hand, in a multivariate model corrected for confounders. Vulnerability and severity did not show statistical significance.

Since children are less than 1% of reported cases, there is limited information to develop evidence-based practice recommendations. The objective of this study was to rapidly gather expert knowledge and experience to guide the care of children with chronic kidney disease during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A four-round multi-center Delphi exercise was conducted among 13 centers in 11 European countries of the European Pediatric Dialysis Working Group (EPDWG) between March, 16th and 20th 2020. Results were analyzed using a mixed methods qualitative approach and descriptive statistics. RESULTS: Thirteen COVID-19 specific topics of particular need for guidance were identified. Main themes encompassed testing strategies and results (n = 4), changes in use of current therapeutics (n = 3), preventive measurements of transmission and management of COVID-19 (n = 3), and changes in standard clinical care (n = 3). Patterns of center-specific responses varied according to regulations and to availability of guidelines. CONCLUSIONS: As limited quantitative evidence is available in real time during the rapid spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, qualitative expert knowledge and experience represent the best evidence available. This Delphi exercise demonstrates that use of mixed methodologies embedded in an established network of experts allowed prompt analysis of pediatric nephrologists’ response to COVID-19 during this fast-emerging public health crisis.

Here, we model the molecular interactions and mechanical properties of ACE2 with both SARS-CoV and COVID-19 spike protein receptor-binding domains (RBD). We report that the COVID-19 spike RBD interacts with ACE2 more strongly and at only two protein residues, as compared to multi-residue interaction of the SARS-CoV. Although both coronaviruses stiffen the ACE2, the impact of COVID-19 is six times larger, which points towards differences in the severity of the reported respiratory distress.

With the current rate of the disease transmission in India, which is home to over 1.35 billion people, the infection spread is predicted to be worse than the USA in the upcoming months. To date, there is a major lack of understanding of the transmission dynamics and epidemiological characteristics of the disease in India, inhibiting effective measures to control the pandemic. We collected all the available data of the individual patients, cases and a range of parameters such as population distribution, testing and healthcare facilities, and weather, across all Indian states till May 2020. Numerical analysis was conducted to determine the effect of each parameter on the COVID-19 situation in India. A significant amount of local transmission in India initiated with travellers returning from abroad. Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and Delhi are currently the top three infected states in India with doubling time of 14.5 days. The average recovery rate across Indian states is 42%, with a mortality rate below 3%. The rest 55% are currently active cases. In total, 88% of the patients experienced symptoms of high fever, 68% suffered from dry cough and 7.1% patients were asymptomatic.

The present review was designed to timely summarize the existing frontline information about nursing scheduling mode with special focus on the length of shifts with the aim to contribute to improve the nurses’ job satisfaction and the quality of nursing services. METHODS: Articles from Jan 2020 to October 2020 were retrieved from China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang Data and Weipu Information, with the terms “COVID-19”, “designated hospital”, “Hubei-assisted”, “makeshift hospital”, “nursing”, “nursing shift”, “whole-system takeover” and variations of these, in the title and abstract fields and the Boolean combinations of these words as the retrieval strategy. RESULTS: Seventeen journal articles have been included in the target field, from the nurses in aiding Hubei Province, four kinds of shift length, 2-hour (h), 3-h, 4-h and 6-h shift have been considered, the main nursing scheduling mode adopted in designated hospitals for COVID-19 patients was dynamic scheduling based on workload, flexible scheduling based on working hours, workload and the number of critically ill patients admitted, humanized scheduling based on the daily reported health status of the nurses, and professional-integrated scheduling according to the professional distribution of nurses on the basis of four-hour shift length, and in makeshift hospitals for mild patients, the scheduling mode was 6-h based correspondingly. CONCLUSION: The descriptive results of the present systematic review shed light on the challenges and practical solutions of nursing scheduling mode in the context of cross-regional medical assistance. Additionally, the present systematic review could provide the academic community of nurses, nurse managers and administrators with baseline information and scientific productions from the content’s points of view in the target field.","Zhang, Xiaochun; Huang, De-Sheng; Guan, Peng",Risk Manag Healthc Policy,267,16

Healthcare professionals are struggling to treat their patients based on nonspecific therapies. Amidst this uncertainty, convalescent plasma therapy (CPT) has appeared to be an interim adjuvant therapy for severely ill patients of COVID-19 until long-term clinical trial treatment options are available. Considering the transfusion-related hazards, especially lung injuries and microbial transmission, where sensitivity is not ensured, rigorous trials should be conducted to determine this therapy’s efficacy. Moreover, the ratio of recovered cases to plasma donors is not satisfying, which questioning this therapy’s availability and accessibility. Although some countries are making the treatment free, the attributable cost mandates a justification for its suitability and sustainability. Our article aimed to review the published facts and findings of CPT’s effectiveness in lowering the mortality rate of COVID-19.

How ethnicity affects Indigenous peoples in Mexico is unclear. The aim of this cross-sectional study was to determine the mortality associated with ethnicity, particularly of Indigenous peoples, in a large sample of patients with COVID-19 in Mexico. METHODS: We used open access data from the Mexican Ministry of Health, which includes data of all confirmed COVID-19 cases in the country. We used descriptive statistics to compare differences among different groups of patients. Logistic regression was used to calculate odds ratios while adjusting for confounders. RESULTS: From February 28 to August 3, 2020, a total of 416546 adult patients were diagnosed with COVID-19. Among these, 4178 were Indigenous peoples. Among all patients with COVID-19, whether hospitalized or not, a higher proportion of Indigenous peoples died compared to non-Indigenous people (16.5% vs 11.1%, respectively). Among hospitalized patients, a higher proportion of Indigenous peoples died (37.1%) compared to non-Indigenous peoples (36.3%). Deaths outside the hospital were also higher among Indigenous peoples (3.7% vs 1.7%). A higher proportion of Indigenous peoples died in both the private and public health care sectors. The adjusted odds ratio for COVID-19 mortality among Indigenous peoples with COVID-19 was 1.13 (95% confidence interval 1.03 to 1.24). The adjusted odds ratio for COVID-19 mortality among Indigenous peoples with COVID-19 was higher among those who received only ambulatory care (1.55, 95% confidence interval 1.24 to 1.92). DISCUSSION: In this large sample of patients with COVID-19, the findings suggest that Indigenous peoples in Mexico have a higher risk of death from COVID-19, especially outside the hospital. These findings suggest Indigenous peoples lack access to care more so than non-Indigenous people during the COVID-19 pandemic in Mexico.","Ibarra-Nava, Ismael; Flores-Rodriguez, Kathia G.; Ruiz-Herrera, Violeta; Ochoa-Bayona, Hilda C.; Salinas-Zertuche, Alfonso; Padilla-Orozco, Magaly; Salazar-Montalvo, Raul G.",PLoS One,267,33

To better understand the molecular biology of the prototype HCV-229E strain, the complete nucleotide sequence of the membrane protein (M) gene was determined from cloned cDNA. The open reading frame is preceded by a consensus transcriptional initiation sequence UCUAAACU, identical to the one found upstream of the N gene. The M gene encodes a 225-amino acid polypeptide with a molecular weight (MW) of 25,822, slightly higher than the apparent MW of 19,000–22,000 observed for the unprocessed M protein obtained after in vitro translation and immunoprecipitation. The M amino acid sequence presents a significant degree of homology (38%) with its counterpart of transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV). The M protein of HCV-229E is highly hydrophobic and its hydropathicity profile shows a transmembranous region composed of three major hydrophobic domains characteristic of a typical coronavirus M protein. About 10% (20 amino acids) of the HCV-229E M protein constitutes a hydrophilic and probably external portion. One N-glycosylation and three potential O-glycosylation sites are found in this exposed domain.","Jouvenne, Patricia; Richardson, Christopher D.; Schreiber, Steven S.; Lai, Michael M.C.; Talbot, Pierre J.",Virology,267,32

As part of the innate immune response, these enzymes are activated by viral double stranded RNA or mRNAs with significant double stranded structure. The 2-5As in turn activate RNaseL that degrade single stranded RNAs. Three distinct forms of OAS exist in human cells (OAS1, 2 and 3) with each form having multiple spliced variants. The OAS enzymes and their spliced variants have different enzyme activities. OAS enzymes also play a significant role in regulating multiple cellular processes such as proliferation and apoptosis. Moreover, Single nucleotide polymorphisms that alter OAS activity are also associated with viral infection, diabetes and cancer. Thus detection of OAS enzyme activity with a simple spectrophotometric method in cells will be important in clinical research. RESULTS: Here we propose a modified coupled spectrophotometric assay to detect 2-5 oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS) enzyme activity in prostate cell lines as a model system. The OAS enzyme from prostate cancer cell lysates was purified using Polyinosinic: polycytidylic acid (poly I:C) bound activated sepharose beads. The activated OAS enzyme eluted from Sepharose beads showed expression of p46 isoform of OAS1, generally considered the most abundant OAS isoform in elutes from DU14 cell line but not in other prostate cell line. In this assay the phosphates generated by the OAS enzymatic reaction is coupled with conversion of the substrate 2-amino-6-mercapto-7-methylpurine ribonucleoside (methylthioguanosine, a guanosine analogue; MESG) to a purine base product, 2-amino-6-mercapto-7-methylpurine and ribose1-phosphate via a catalyst purine nucleoside phosphorylase (phosphorylase) using a commercially available pyrophosphate kit. The absorbance of the purine base product is measured at 360 nm. The higher levels of phosphates detected in DU145 cell line indicates more activity of OAS in this prostate cancer cell line. CONCLUSION: The modified simple method detected OAS enzyme activity with sensitivity and specificity, which could help in detection of OAS enzymes avoiding the laborious and radioactive methods.","Bhosle, Sushma M.; Hunt, Aisha; Chaudhary, Jaideep",Biol Proced Online,267,16

Predictors of adverse outcomes need to be investigated to properly manage COVID‐19 patients. The Braden Scale (BS), commonly used for the assessment of pressure ulcer risk, has recently been proposed to identify frailty. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the predictive utility of the BS for prediction of in‐hospital mortality in a cohort of COVID‐19 patients admitted to non‐ICU wards. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective single‐center cohort study evaluating all patients with SARS‐CoV‐2 infection consecutively admitted over a 2‐month period (from March 6 to May 7, 2020) to the COVID‐19 general wards of our institution. Demographic, clinical, and nursing assessment data, including admission BS, were extracted from electronic medical records. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression models were used to explore the association between the BS score and in‐hospital death. RESULTS: Braden Scale was assessed in 146 patients (mean age 74.7 years; 52% males). On admission, 46 had a BS ≤ 15, and 100 patients had a BS > 15. Mortality among patients with BS ≤ 15 was significantly higher than in patients with BS > 15 (45.7% vs. 16%; p < .001). On multivariable regression analysis, adjusting for potentials confounders (age, Barthel scale, chronic kidney disease, atrial fibrillation, and hypertension), the admission BS remained inversely associated with the risk of in‐hospital mortality (OR = 0.76; 95% CI [0.60, 0.96]; p = .020). LINKING EVIDENCE TO ACTION: Admission BS could be used as a simple bedside predictive tool able to early identify non‐ICU COVID‐19 patients with poor prognosis who might benefit from specific and timely interventions.","Lovicu, Elena; Faraone, Antonio; Fortini, Alberto",Worldviews Evid Based Nurs,267,1

Respiratory tract manifestations are the most common symptoms, such as gastrointestinal symptoms (GISs) like nausea or sickness, diarrhea, and anorexia, and psychological effects may be reported in affected individuals. However, similar symptoms may be observed in healthy people as a consequence of an anxiety state. Methods: We analyzed GISs and anxiety state during the COVID-19 lockdown period; from 9 March 2020 to 4 May 2020. A web-based survey consisting of 131 items was administered to 354 students affiliated with the School of Medicine of the University “Magna Graecia” of Catanzaro; Italy. A set of statistical analyses was performed to analyze the relationships among the answers to assess a correlation between the topics of interest. Results: The statistical analysis showed that 54.0% of interviewed reported at least one GISs, 36.16% of which reported a positive history for familial GISs (FGISs).

This is especially apparent during times of pandemics or other social unrest situations as currently seen during the COVID-19 crisis. It can manifest itself as violence (towards or from the mentally ill person), increased substance use, increased overcrowding of our prisons, tackling with comorbid medical conditions which have worsened due to lack of initial attention (a particularly big problem among the mentally ill), increased strain on tax payers, and overall affecting the quality of everyone’s life. Furthermore, mental health maladies can cause increase work absenteeism and poor work performance and decreased economic productivity. The stigma associated with mental health also leads to poor funding form policy makers, as there is a lack of forceful advocacy in dealing with these issues. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that the loss of productivity due to mental health disability accounts to close to 5% of the gross national product of the European Union (WHO 2019). One of the most crucial causes of lack of mental screening, recognition, and treatment is the limited availability of mental health trained providers. The physician assistant profession is in a unique role to fill this niche as they have been trained as generalists who specialize only when getting trained in their specific field during their employment. Additionally, the fact that PAs do have lateral mobility does lend this profession to meet the needs of society, especially in the psychiatric fields, in a prompt and competent manner. The need for physician assistants (PAs) in psychiatry and addiction medicine is a nationwide trend resulting in existing and emerging shortages of psychiatric and addiction medicine providers. They can provide relatively inexpensive, easily accessible, and good quality care to their clients.","Kuriakose, Shinu",SN Compr Clin Med,267,28

Occupational characteristics, such as interfacing with the public and being in close quarters with other workers, not only put workers at high risk for disease, but also make them a nexus of disease transmission to the community. This can further be exacerbated through presenteeism, the term used to describe the act of coming to work despite being symptomatic for disease. Quantifying the number of workers who are frequently exposed to infection and disease in the workplace, and understanding which occupational groups they represent, can help to prompt public health risk response and management for COVID-19 in the workplace, and subsequent infectious disease outbreaks. METHODS: To estimate the number of United States workers frequently exposed to infection and disease in the workplace, national employment data (by Standard Occupational Classification) maintained by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) was merged with a BLS O*NET survey measure reporting how frequently workers in each occupation are exposed to infection or disease at work. This allowed us to estimate the number of United States workers, across all occupations, exposed to disease or infection at work more than once a month. RESULTS: Based on our analyses, approximately 10% (14.4 M) of United States workers are employed in occupations where exposure to disease or infection occurs at least once per week. Approximately 18.4% (26.7 M) of all United States workers are employed in occupations where exposure to disease or infection occurs at least once per month. While the majority of exposed workers are employed in healthcare sectors, other occupational sectors also have high proportions of exposed workers. These include protective service occupations (e.g. police officers, correctional officers, firefighters), office and administrative support occupations (e.g. couriers and messengers, patient service representatives), education occupations (e.g. preschool and daycare teachers), community and social services occupations (community health workers, social workers, counselors), and even construction and extraction occupations (e.g. plumbers, septic tank installers, elevator repair). CONCLUSIONS: The large number of persons employed in occupations with frequent exposure to infection and disease underscore the importance of all workplaces developing risk response plans for COVID-19. Given the proportion of the United States workforce exposed to disease or infection at work, this analysis also serves as an important reminder that the workplace is a key locus for public health interventions, which could protect both workers and the communities they serve.","Baker, Marissa G.; Peckham, Trevor K.; Seixas, Noah S.",PLoS One,267,1

In this work we identified and traced over time 7 amino acid variants that are present with high frequency in Italy and Europe, but that were absent or present at very low frequencies during the first stages of the epidemic in China and the initial reports in Europe. The analysis of these variants helps defining 6 phylogenetic clades that are currently spreading throughout the world with changes in frequency that are sometimes very fast and dramatic.

Relevant databases in health and education will be systematically searched using key words and Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) and grey literature will be explored. Databases will include PubMed, Ovid for MEDLINE and PsycINFO, EBSCO for the Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), and the Education Resources Information Center (ERIC). Covidence© will be used to support abstract and full text screening, which will be completed by two main reviewers. Results will be tabulated, summarised and meta-analysed using a random-effects model, in any instance where concordant outcome measures have been applied. Results will be published and reported in line with PRISMA reporting guidelines. DISCUSSION Given little is known about effective support for families when children are awaiting diagnostic assessment for any medical, developmental or behavioural condition, the authors will synthesise existing evidence about parent-directed interventions in this period. It is hoped that by understanding the existing evidence interventions that are proven to be effective will be adopted and intervention innovation can occur.

The mean PM(2.5) concentration during the study period was 145 μg/m(3), and the 10 investigated toxic elements accounted for 0.31% of the PM(2.5) mass. The total non-cancer risk (HI) and total cancer risk (TCR) of the selected toxic elements exceed the US EPA limits for children and adults. The HI for children was 2.3 times that for adults for all periods, which is likely due to the high inhalation rate per unit body weight for children. While the TCR for adults was 1.7 times that of children, which is mainly attributed to potential longer exposure duration for adults. The HI and TCR of the toxic elements during full lockdown were reduced by 66% and 58%, respectively, compared to their pre-lockdown levels. The HI and TCR were primarily attributable to Mn and As, respectively. Health risks during haze episodes were significantly higher than the average levels during COVID-19 lockdowns, though the HI and TCR of the selected toxic elements during full-lockdown haze episodes were 68% and 17% lower, respectively, than were the levels during pre-lockdown haze episodes. During the study period, fugitive dust and steel-related smelting were the highest contributors to HI and TCR, respectively, and decreased in these emission sources contributed the most to the lower health risks observed during the full lockdown. There, the control of these sources is critical to effectively reduce public health risks.","Wang, Yanyang; Liu, Baoshuang; Zhang, Yufen; Dai, Qili; Song, Congbo; Duan, Liqin; Guo, Lili; Zhao, Jing; Xue, Zhigang; Bi, Xiaohui; Feng, Yinchang",Environ Pollut,267,24

However, older adults do not complete ACP at expected rates due to patient and clinician barriers. We present the original design, methods and rationale for a trial aimed at improving ACP for older patients with advanced cancer and the modified protocol in response to changes brought by the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The Advance Care Planning: Promoting Effective and Aligned Communication in the Elderly study is a pragmatic, stepped-wedge cluster randomised trial examining a Comprehensive ACP Program. The programme combines two complementary evidence-based interventions: clinician communication skills training (VitalTalk) and patient video decision aids (ACP Decisions). We will implement the programme at 36 oncology clinics across three unique US health systems. Our primary outcome is the proportion of eligible patients with ACP documentation completed in the electronic health record. Our secondary outcomes include resuscitation preferences, palliative care consultations, death, hospice use and final cancer-directed therapy. From a subset of our patient population, we will collect surveys and video-based declarations of goals and preferences. We estimate 11 000 patients from the three sites will be enrolled in the study. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Regulatory and ethical aspects of this trial include Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval via single IRB of record mechanism at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Data Use Agreements among partners and a Data Safety and Monitoring Board. We plan to present findings at national meetings and publish the results.

Data are just emerging about the practice and outcomes of tracheostomy in these patients. We reviewed our experience with tracheostomies for SARS-CoV-2 at our tertiary care, urban teaching hospital. Methods: We reviewed the demographics, comorbidities, timing of mechanical ventilation, tracheostomy, and ICU and hospital lengths of stay (LOS) in SARS-CoV-2 patients who received tracheostomies. Early tracheostomy was considered <14 days of ventilation. Medians with interquartile ranges (IQR) were calculated and compared with Wilcoxon rank sum, Spearman correlation, Kruskal-Wallis, and regression modeling. Results: From March 2020 to January 2021, our center had 370 patients intubated for SARS-CoV-2, and 59 (16%) had percutaneous bedside tracheostomy. Median time from intubation to tracheostomy was 19 (IQR 17 - 24) days. Demographics and comorbidities were similar between early and late tracheostomy, but early tracheostomy was associated with shorter ICU LOS and a trend towards shorter ventilation. To date, 34 (58%) of patients have been decannulated, 17 (29%) before hospital discharge; median time to decannulation was 24 (IQR 19-38) days. Decannulated patients were younger (56 vs 69 years), and in regression analysis, pneumothorax was associated was associated with lower decannulation rates (OR 0.05, 95CI 0.01 - 0.37). No providers developed symptoms or tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Conclusions: Tracheostomy is a safe and reasonable procedure for patients with prolonged SARS-CoV-2 respiratory failure. We feel that tracheostomy enhances care for SARS-CoV-2 since early tracheostomy appears associated with shorter duration of critical care, and decannulation rates appear high for survivors.","Arnold, J.

A web-based cross-sectional study was conducted among Nepalese adults from March 29 to April 07, 2020. A 13- and 15- items structured questionnaire assessed the COVID-19 related knowledge and perception of the universal safety measure. Kruskal–Wallis test and Mann–Whitney U test evaluated the differences in knowledge between the groups. Data analysis was performed using IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows Version 21.0 (IBM Corp. Armonk, NY, USA). Of the 884 surveys accessed, a total of 871 consented (electronically) and completed the online survey (response rate 98.52%). The median knowledge score of the participants was 10.0 (± 3.0 IQR). Although participants’ overall knowledge score was high, only about half of the participants knew about the concept of quarantine and the ideal distance to be maintained between individuals to prevent the transmission. Though the majority of the participants had positive perception towards universal safety measure of COVID-19, about 18% perceived that coronavirus infected only older people, 11% opined that the infection was highly fatal with no chances of survival and 70% considered that limiting consumptions of poultry and meat would prevent the spread of COVID-19. A statistically significant difference in knowledge was noted by participants’ age, educational status, occupational type, and household monthly income.

The problem with COVID-19 therapeutics is due to complexity of the mechanism of the pathogenesis of this virus. In this review, an extensive analysis of genome architecture and mode of pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 with an emphasis on therapeutic approaches is performed. SARS-CoV-2 genome consists of a single, ~29.9 kb long RNA having significant sequence similarity to BAT-CoV, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV genome. Two-third part of SARS-Cov-2 genome comprises of ORF (ORF1ab) resulting in the formation of 2 polyproteins, pp1a and pp1ab, later processed into 16 smaller non-structural proteins (NSPs). The four major structural proteins of SARS-CoV-2 are the spike surface glycoprotein (S), a small envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins. S protein helps in receptor binding and membrane fusion and hence plays the most important role in the transmission of CoVs. Priming of S protein is done by serine 2 transmembrane protease and thus plays a key role in virus and host cell fusion. This review highlights the possible mechanism of action of SARS-CoV-2 to search for possible therapeutic options.","Shamsi, Anas; Mohammad, Taj; Anwar, Saleha; Amani, Samreen; Khan, Mohd Shahnawaz; Husain, Fohad Mabood; Rehman, Md.

Pathway impact analysis identified 8 perturbed NI related pathways. Expression profile analysis found 15 experiments having similar whole-transcriptome profiles of DGE related to neuroinflammation and PIPN.

Several vaccines, conceived in 2020, that evoke protective spike antibody responses are being deployed in mass public health vaccination programs. Recent data suggests, however, that as sequence variation in the spike genome accumulates, some vaccines may lose efficacy. Methods: Using a macaque model of SARS-CoV-2 infection, we tested the efficacy of a peptide-based vaccine targeting MHC class I epitopes on the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein. We administered biodegradable microspheres with synthetic peptides and adjuvants to rhesus macaques. Unvaccinated control and vaccinated macaques were challenged with 1 × 10(8) TCID(50) units of SARS-CoV-2, followed by assessment of clinical symptoms and viral load, chest radiographs, and sampling of peripheral blood and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid for downstream analysis. Results: Vaccinated animals were free of pneumonia-like infiltrates characteristic of SARS-CoV-2 infection and presented with lower viral loads relative to controls. Gene expression in cells collected from BAL samples of vaccinated macaques revealed a unique signature associated with enhanced development of adaptive immune responses relative to control macaques. Conclusions: We demonstrate that a room temperature stable peptide vaccine based on known immunogenic HLA class I bound CTL epitopes from the nucleocapsid protein can provide protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection in nonhuman primates.","Harris, Paul E.; Brasel, Trevor; Massey, Christopher; Herst, C.

There is an urgent need to develop curative and preventive therapeutics to limit the current pandemic and to prevent the re-emergence of Covid-19. This study aimed to assess the in vitro activity of copper gluconate against SRAS-CoV-2. Methods Vero E6 cells were treated with copper gluconate 18 hours before infection. Cells were infected with a recombinant GFP expressing SARS-CoV-2. Infected cells were maintained in fresh medium containing copper gluconate for an additional 48-hour period. The infection level was measured by the confocal microscopy-based high content screening method. The cell viability in presence of copper gluconate was assessed by XTT assay. Results The viability of Vero E6 cells treated with copper gluconate up to 200 μM was found to be similar to that of untreated cells, but it dropped below 40% with 400 μM of this agent. The infection rate was 23.8%, 18.9%, 20.6%, 6.9%, 5.3%,5.2% in cells treated with 0, 2, 10, 25, 50 and 100 μM of copper gluconate respectively.

They have proven useful not only as supplements preventing diseases caused by oxidative stress and food additives preventing oxidation but also as system components for the production of metallic nanoparticles by the so-called green synthesis. This is important given the drastically increased demand for nanomaterials in biomedical fields. The source of ecological technology for producing nanoparticles can be plants or microorganisms (yeast, algae, cyanobacteria, fungi, and bacteria). This review presents recently published research on the green synthesis of nanoparticles. The conditions of biosynthesis and possible mechanisms of nanoparticle formation with the participation of bacteria are presented. The potential of natural extracts for biogenic synthesis depends on the content of reducing substances. The assessment of the antioxidant activity of extracts as multicomponent mixtures is still a challenge for analytical chemistry. There is still no universal test for measuring total antioxidant capacity (TAC). There are many in vitro chemical tests that quantify the antioxidant scavenging activity of free radicals and their ability to chelate metals and that reduce free radical damage. This paper presents the classification of antioxidants and non-enzymatic methods of testing antioxidant capacity in vitro, with particular emphasis on methods based on nanoparticles. Examples of recent studies on the antioxidant activity of natural extracts obtained from different species such as plants, fungi, bacteria, algae, lichens, actinomycetes were collected, giving evaluation methods, reference antioxidants, and details on the preparation of extracts.","Flieger, Jolanta; Flieger, Wojciech; Baj, Jacek; Maciejewski, Ryszard",Materials (Basel),267,16

The aim of this study was to assess the role of tocilizumab in reducing the risk of invasive mechanical ventilation and death in patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia who received standard of care treatment. METHODS: This retrospective, observational cohort study included adults (≥18 years) with severe COVID-19 pneumonia who were admitted to tertiary care centres in Bologna and Reggio Emilia, Italy, between Feb 21 and March 24, 2020, and a tertiary care centre in Modena, Italy, between Feb 21 and April 30, 2020. All patients were treated with the standard of care (ie, supplemental oxygen, hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, antiretrovirals, and low molecular weight heparin), and a non-randomly selected subset of patients also received tocilizumab. Tocilizumab was given either intravenously at 8 mg/kg bodyweight (up to a maximum of 800 mg) in two infusions, 12 h apart, or subcutaneously at 162 mg administered in two simultaneous doses, one in each thigh (ie, 324 mg in total), when the intravenous formulation was unavailable. The primary endpoint was a composite of invasive mechanical ventilation or death. Treatment groups were compared using Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox regression analysis after adjusting for sex, age, recruiting centre, duration of symptoms, and baseline Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score. FINDINGS: Of 1351 patients admitted, 544 (40%) had severe COVID-19 pneumonia and were included in the study. 57 (16%) of 365 patients in the standard care group needed mechanical ventilation, compared with 33 (18%) of 179 patients treated with tocilizumab (p=0·41; 16 [18%] of 88 patients treated intravenously and 17 [19%] of 91 patients treated subcutaneously). 73 (20%) patients in the standard care group died, compared with 13 (7%; p<0·0001) patients treated with tocilizumab (six [7%] treated intravenously and seven [8%] treated subcutaneously). After adjustment for sex, age, recruiting centre, duration of symptoms, and SOFA score, tocilizumab treatment was associated with a reduced risk of invasive mechanical ventilation or death (adjusted hazard ratio 0·61, 95% CI 0·40–0·92; p=0·020). 24 (13%) of 179 patients treated with tocilizumab were diagnosed with new infections, versus 14 (4%) of 365 patients treated with standard of care alone (p<0·0001). INTERPRETATION: Treatment with tocilizumab, whether administered intravenously or subcutaneously, might reduce the risk of invasive mechanical ventilation or death in patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia.

Here, we investigate whether the Duffy-null genotype is associated with the risk of infection using the UK Biobank sample and the iPSYCH Danish case-cohort study, two population-based samples from different countries and age ranges. We found that a high proportion of those with the Duffy-null genotype (21%) had a neutrophil count below the threshold often used as a cut-off for access to relevant treatments, compared with 1% of those with the TC/TT genotype. In addition we found that despite its strong association with lower average neutrophil counts, the Duffy-null genotype was not associated with an increased risk of infection, viral or bacterial. These results have widespread implications for the clinical treatment of individuals of African ancestry and indicate that neutrophil thresholds to access treatments could be lowered in individuals with the Duffy-null genotype without an increased risk of infection.","Legge, Sophie E; Christensen, Rune H; Petersen, Liselotte; Pardiñas, Antonio F; Bracher-Smith, Matthew; Knapper, Steven; Bybjerg-Grauholm, Jonas; Baekvad-Hansen, Marie; Hougaard, David M; Werge, Thomas; Nordentoft, Merete; Mortensen, Preben Bo; Owen, Michael J; O’Donovan, Michael C; Benros, Michael E; Walters, James T R",Hum Mol Genet,267,1

Whereas in most cases COVID-19 is asymptomatic or pauci-symptomatic, extremely severe clinical forms are observed. In this case, complex immune dysregulations and an excessive inflammatory response are reported and are the main cause of morbidity and mortality. Natural killer cells are key players in the control of viral infection, and their activity is regulated by a tight balance between activating and inhibitory receptors; an alteration of NK activity was suggested to be associated with the development of severe forms of COVID-19. In this study, we analyzed peripheral NK cell subpopulations and the expression of activating and inhibitory receptors in 30 patients suffering from neurological conditions who recovered from mild, moderate, or severe SARS-CoV-2 infection, comparing the results to those of 10 SARS-CoV-2-uninfected patients. Results showed that an expansion of NK subset with lower cytolytic activity and an augmented expression of the 2DL1 inhibitory receptor, particularly when in association with the C2 ligand (KIR2DL1-C2), characterized the immunological scenario of severe COVID-19 infection. An increase of NK expressing the ILT2 inhibitory receptor was instead seen in patients recovering from mild or moderate infection compared to controls. Results herein suggest that the KIR2DL1-C2 NK inhibitory complex is a risk factor toward the development of severe form of COVID-19. Our results confirm that a complex alteration of NK activity is present in COVID-19 infection and offer a molecular explanation for this observation.

Uganda hosts over 1.43 million refugees, and more than 83,000 live in Kampala, largely in informal settlements. There is limited information about HIV testing uptake and preferences among urban refugee and displaced youth. HIV self-testing is a promising method for increasing testing uptake. Further, mobile health (mHealth) interventions have been effective in increasing HIV testing uptake and could be particularly useful among youth. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of two HIV self-testing implementation strategies (HIV self-testing intervention alone and HIV self-testing combined with an mHealth intervention) in comparison with the HIV testing standard of care in terms of HIV testing outcomes among refugee/displaced youth aged 16 to 24 years in Kampala, Uganda. METHODS: A three-arm cluster randomized controlled trial will be implemented across five informal settlements grouped into three sites, based on proximity, and randomization will be performed with a 1:1:1 method. Approximately 450 adolescents (150 per cluster) will be enrolled and followed for 12 months. Data will be collected at the following three time points: baseline enrollment, 8 months after enrollment, and 12 months after enrollment. Primary outcomes (HIV testing frequency, HIV status knowledge, linkage to confirmatory testing, and linkage to HIV care) and secondary outcomes (depression, condom use efficacy, consistent condom use, sexual relationship power, HIV stigma, and adolescent sexual and reproductive health stigma) will be evaluated. RESULTS: The study has been conducted in accordance with CONSORT (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials) guidelines. The study has received ethical approval from the University of Toronto (June 14, 2019), Mildmay Uganda (November 11, 2019), and the Uganda National Council for Science and Technology (August 3, 2020). The Tushirikiane trial launched in February 2020, recruiting a total of 452 participants. Data collection was paused for 8 months due to COVID-19. Data collection for wave 2 resumed in November 2020, and as of December 10, 2020, a total of 295 participants have been followed-up. The third, and final, wave of data collection will be conducted between February and March 2021. CONCLUSIONS: This study will contribute to the knowledge of differentiated HIV testing implementation strategies for urban refugee and displaced youth living in informal settlements. We will share the findings in peer-reviewed manuscripts and conference presentations. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04504097; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04504097.

Although innovative “omic” technologies supported the application of personalised medicine in clinical, oncological, and pharmacological settings, its role in occupational health practice and research is still in a developing phase. Occupational personalised approaches have been currently applied in experimental settings and in conditions of unpredictable risks, e.g. war missions and space flights, where it is essential to avoid disease manifestations and therapy failure. However, a debate is necessary as to whether personalized medicine may be even more important to support a redefinition of the risk assessment processes taking into consideration the complex interaction between occupational and individual factors. Indeed, “omic” techniques can be helpful to understand the hazardous properties of the xenobiotics, dose-response relationships through a deeper elucidation of the exposure-disease pathways and internal doses of exposure. Overall, this may guide the adoption/implementation of primary preventive measures protective for the vast majority of the population, including most susceptible subgroups. However, the application of personalised medicine into occupational health requires overcoming some practical, ethical, legal, economical, and socio-political issues, particularly concerning the protection of privacy, and the risk of discrimination that the workers may experience. In this scenario, the concerted action of academic, industry, governmental, and stakeholder representatives should be encouraged to improve research aimed to guide effective and sustainable implementation of personalised medicine in occupational health fields.","Bollati, Valentina; Ferrari, Luca; Leso, Veruscka; Iavicoli, Ivo",Med Lav,267,1

Growing in popularity particularly among youth and young adults, the sending of images to current or potential romantic or sexual partners is increasingly becoming part of courting and relationship maintenance rituals. Yet this new domain of sexual agency has been met with a rise in the non-consensual dissemination of intimate or nude photographs to third parties, in some cases to humiliate or shame the creator of the image. METHODS: This paper uses a socio-narratological approach to understand the complex consequences that (largely female) victims of image-based sexual abuse (IBSA) experience. RESULTS: Individuals who experience IBSA may undergo perpetuated suffering due to an interwoven constellation of internal and external forces, much of which is rooted in the sexual regulation (if not subjugation) of women. Suffering is presented as originating from three domains: the self, the perpetrator, and society, which interact as a ""Dark Triad."" CONCLUSIONS: The use of socio-narratology to disentangle the suffering may provide victims and mental health professionals with experiential clarity. Further, it offers a way forward for individuals who have experienced this unique form of sexual violence.","Sparks, Brandon",Sex Res Social Policy,267,16

The concentration of air pollutants is considered a critical factor responsible for transmitting coronavirus disease among the masses. The photochemical process and coal combustions create respiratory disorders that lead to coronavirus disease. Based on the crucial fact, the study evaluated the impact of nitrous oxide (N(2)O) emissions, coal combustion, and traffic emissions on COVID-19 cases in a panel of 39 most affected countries of the world. These three air pollution factors are considered to form a lethal smog that negatively affects the patient’s respiratory system, leading to increased susceptibility to coronavirus worldwide. The study used the Markov two-step switching regime regression model for obtaining parameter estimates. In contrast, an innovation accounting matrix is used to assess smog factors’ intensity on possibly increasing coronavirus cases over time. The results show that N(2)O emissions, coal combustion, and traffic emissions increase COVID-19 cases in regime-1. On the other hand, N2O emissions significantly increase coronavirus cases in regime-2. The innovation accounting matrix shows that N2O emissions would likely have a more significant share of increasing coronavirus cases with a variance of 33.902%, followed by coal combustion (i.e., 6.643%) and traffic emissions (i.e., 2.008%) over the time horizon. The study concludes that air quality levels should be maintained through stringent environmental policies, such as carbon pricing, sustainable urban planning, green technology advancement, renewable fuels, and pollution less accessible vehicles. All these measures would likely decrease coronavirus cases worldwide.","Anser, Muhammad Khalid; Godil, Danish Iqbal; Khan, Muhammad Azhar; Nassani, Abdelmohsen A.; Zaman, Khalid; Abro, Muhammad Moinuddin Qazi",Environ Sci Pollut Res Int,267,31

Concerns were raised regarding the impact of resources’ reorganization on certain emergency pathology management. The aim of the present study was to assess the impact of the outbreak (in terms of reduction of neurosurgical emergencies) during lockdown in different regions of Spain. METHODS: We analyzed the impact of the outbreak in four different affected regions by descriptive statistics and univariate comparison with same period of two previous years. These regions differed in their incidence level (high/low) and in the time of excess mortality with respect to lockdown declaration. That allowed us to analyze their influence on the characteristics of neurosurgical emergencies registered for every region. RESULTS: 1185 patients from 18 neurosurgical centers were included. Neurosurgical emergencies that underwent surgery dropped 24.41% and 28.15% in 2020 when compared with 2019 and 2018, respectively. A higher reduction was reported for the most affected regions by COVID-19. Non-traumatic spine experienced the most significant decrease in number of cases. Life-threatening conditions did not suffer a reduction in any health care region. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 affected dramatically the neurosurgical emergency management. The most significant reduction in neurosurgical emergencies occurred on those regions that were hit unexpectedly by the pandemic, as resources were focused on fighting the virus. As a consequence, life-threating and non-life-threatening conditions’ mortality raised. Results in regions who had time to prepare for the hit were congruent with an organized and sensible neurosurgical decision-making.","Gandía-González, Maria L.; Viñuela-Prieto, Jose M.; Barrios, Laura; Alarcón, Carlos; Arikan, Fuat; Arráez, Cinta; Domínguez, Carlos J.; Alén, Jose F.; Gutiérrez-González, Raquel; Horcajadas, Angel; Muñoz Hernández, Fernando; Narváez, Alejandra; Paredes, Igor; Pérez-Alfayate, Rebeca; Rodríguez de Lope, Angel; Ruiz-Juretschke, Fernando; Salge Arrieta, Freddy J.; Tejada, Sonia; Tamarit, Martin; Topczewski, Thomaz; Lafuente, Jesus",Eur J Trauma Emerg Surg,267,26

However, animal immunization is inherently slow, has poor compatibility with certain antigens (e.g., integral membrane proteins), and suffers from self-tolerance and immunodominance, which limit the functional spectrum of antibodies that can be obtained. Here, we describe Autonomous Hypermutation yEast surfAce Display (AHEAD), a synthetic recombinant antibody generation technology that imitates somatic hypermutation inside engineered yeast. In AHEAD, antibody fragments are encoded on an error-prone orthogonal DNA replication system, resulting in Saccharomyces cerevisiae populations that continuously mutate surface-displayed antibody repertoires. Simple cycles of yeast culturing and enrichment for antigen binding drive the evolution of high-affinity antibody clones in a readily parallelizable process that takes as little as 2 weeks. We applied AHEAD to generate nanobodies against the SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein, a GPCR, and other targets. The SARS-CoV-2 nanobodies, concurrently evolved from an open-source naïve nanobody library in 8 independent experiments, reached subnanomolar affinities through the sequential fixation of multiple mutations over 3-8 AHEAD cycles that saw ∼580-fold and ∼925-fold improvements in binding affinities and pseudovirus neutralization potencies, respectively. These experiments highlight the defining speed, parallelizability, and effectiveness of AHEAD and provide a template for streamlined antibody generation at large with salient utility in rapid response to current and future viral outbreaks.","Wellner, Alon; McMahon, Conor; Gilman, Morgan S.

However, awareness, achievements, and advances in cardiac health care have enhanced the demands and expectations of the community, which lacks awareness about the social, economic, administrative, professional, and technical constraints or limitations of implementation. Being unfamiliar with medical ethics and legal aspects of care, and suboptimal virtues among physicians, have led to patients and the public utilizing legal remedies. In addition, sophistication of medical practice, increasing costs of health care, involvement of insurance systems, increased awareness and high expectations from the community and patients, and increased participation of the media have altered the attitude toward claiming compensation and acquisition of health care delivery among the public. In view of the changing trends of consumers and emerging areas in health care, providers must get accustomed to patient empowerment and come up to their expectations. Interactive programs on these aspects in medical education will help students understand not only the intricacies of medical ethics and the laws and shortcomings of health professionals and/or health systems, but also strengthen their knowledge of ethics and laws to improve their practice. Principles of ethics and legal issues have to be discussed at every stage of medical education. To improve the quality of the physician–patient encounter, we need to develop formal and informal curricula about effective communication skills.

METHODS: A bidirectional prospective study. Interviews investigated symptoms potentially associated with COVID-19 six months after the disease onset of all consecutive adult in- and out-patients with COVID-19 attending Udine Hospital (Italy) from March to May 2020. IgG antibodies against Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) were also evaluated six months after the onset of symptoms, at the time of the interview. RESULTS: A total of 599 individuals were included (320 female, 53.4%; mean age 53 years, SD 15.8) and interviewed 187 days (22 SD) after the onset. The prevalence of post-COVID-19 syndrome was 40.2% (241/599). The presence of IgG antibodies was significantly associated with the occurrence of post-COVID-19 syndrome (OR 2.56, 95% CI 1.48–4.38, p = 0.001) and median SARS-CoV-2 IgG titres were significantly higher in long-haulers than in patients without symptoms (42.1, IQR 17.1-78.4 vs. 29.1, IQR 12.1-54.2 kAU/L, p = 0.004).

METHODS: This was a single-center prospective study involving 29 patients (11 females, 18 males; median age 64 years, range: 43–85) with thyrotoxicosis diagnosed after hospitalization for COVID-19 and then followed-up for a median period of 90 days (range: 30–120) after hospital discharge. At follow-up, patients were evaluated for serum thyrotropin (TSH), free-thyroxine (FT4), free-triiodiothyronine (FT3), TSH receptor antibodies (TRAb), thyroglobulin antibodies (TgAb), thyroperoxidase antibodies (TPOAb) and ultrasonographic thyroid structure. RESULTS: After recovery of COVID-19, serum TSH values significantly increased (P < 0.001) and FT4 values significantly decreased (P = 0.001), without significant change in serum FT3 (P = 0.572). At follow-up, 28 subjects (96.6%) became euthyroid whereas overt hypothyroidism developed in one case. At the ultrasound evaluation of thyroid gland, hypoecogenicity was found in 10 patients (34.5%) and in these cases serum TSH values tended to be higher than those without thyroid hypoecogenity (P = 0.066). All subjects resulted to be negative for TgAb, TPOAb and TRAb. CONCLUSION: In a short-term follow-up, thyroid function spontaneously normalized in most subjects with SARS-CoV-2-related thyrotoxicosis. However, thyroid hypoecogenicity was found in a remarkable number of them and future longer-term studies are needed to clarify whether this ultrasonographic alteration may predispose to develop late-onset thyroid dysfunction.","Pizzocaro, Alessandro; Colombo, Paolo; Vena, Walter; Ariano, Salvatore; Magnoni, Paola; Reggiani, Francesco; Favacchio, Giuseppe; Mirani, Marco; Lavezzi, Elisabetta; Voza, Antonio; Calatroni, Marta; Mazziotti, Gherardo; Lania, Andrea",Endocrine,267,7

Several types of paper questionnaires have been developed to assess these conditions in early childhood; however, the psychometric equivalence between the web-based and the paper versions of these questionnaires is unknown. OBJECTIVE: This study examined the interformat reliability of the web-based parent-rated version of the Autism Spectrum Screening Questionnaire (ASSQ), Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder Rating Scale (ADHD-RS), Developmental Coordination Disorder Questionnaire 2007 (DCDQ), and Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) among Japanese preschoolers in a community developmental health check-up setting. METHODS: A set of paper-based questionnaires were distributed for voluntary completion to parents of children aged 5 years. The package of the paper format questionnaires included the ASSQ, ADHD-RS, DCDQ, parent-reported SDQ (P-SDQ), and several additional demographic questions. Responses were received from 508 parents of children who agreed to participate in the study. After 3 months, 300 parents, who were among the initial responders, were randomly selected and asked to complete the web-based versions of these questionnaires. A total of 140 parents replied to the web-based format and were included as a final sample in this study. RESULTS: We obtained the McDonald ω coefficients for both the web-based and paper formats of the ASSQ (web-based: ω=.90; paper: ω=.86), ADHD-RS total and subscales (web-based: ω=.88-.94; paper: ω=.87-.93), DCDQ total and subscales (web-based: ω=.82-.94; paper: ω=.74-.92), and P-SDQ total and subscales (web-based: ω=.55-.81; paper: ω=.52-.80). The intraclass correlation coefficients between the web-based and paper formats were all significant at the 99.9% confidence level: ASSQ (r=0.66, P<.001); ADHD-RS total and subscales (r=0.66-0.74, P<.001); DCDQ total and subscales (r=0.66-0.71, P<.001); P-SDQ Total Difficulties and subscales (r=0.55-0.73, P<.001). There were no significant differences between the web-based and paper formats for total mean score of the ASSQ (P=.76), total (P=.12) and subscale (P=.11-.47) mean scores of DCDQ, and the P-SDQ Total Difficulties mean score (P=.20) and mean subscale scores (P=.28-.79). Although significant differences were found between the web-based and paper formats for mean ADHD-RS scores (total: t(132)=2.83, P=.005; Inattention subscale: t(133)=2.15, P=.03; Hyperactivity/Impulsivity subscale: t(133)=3.21, P=.002), the effect sizes were small (Cohen d=0.18-0.22). CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the web-based versions of the ASSQ, ADHD-RS, DCDQ, and P-SDQ were equivalent, with the same level of internal consistency and intrarater reliability as the paper versions, indicating the applicability of the web-based versions of these questionnaires for assessing neurodevelopmental disorders.","Tanaka, Masanori; Saito, Manabu; Takahashi, Michio; Adachi, Masaki; Nakamura, Kazuhiko",JMIR Pediatr Parent,267,20

The mechanistic underpinnings of this association are not well-understood. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the mediating role of systemic inflammation in obesity-associated COVID-19 outcomes. METHODS: This hospital-based, observational study included 3828 SARS-CoV-2-infected patients who were hospitalized February to May 2020 at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) or Columbia University Irving Medical Center/New York Presbyterian Hospital (CUIMC/NYP). We use mediation analysis to evaluate whether peak inflammatory biomarkers (C-reactive protein [CRP], erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR], D-dimer, ferritin, white blood cell count and interleukin-6) are in the causal pathway between obesity (BMI ≥ 30) and mechanical ventilation or death within 28 days of presentation to care. RESULTS: In the MGH cohort (n = 1202), obesity was associated with greater likelihood of ventilation or death (OR = 1.73; 95% CI = [1.25, 2.41]; P = 0.001) and higher peak CRP (P < 0.001) compared with nonobese patients. The estimated proportion of the association between obesity and ventilation or death mediated by CRP was 0.49 (P < 0.001). Evidence of mediation was more pronounced in patients < 65 years (proportion mediated = 0.52 [P < 0.001] vs 0.44 [P = 0.180]). Findings were more moderate but consistent for peak ESR. Mediation by other inflammatory markers was not supported. Results were replicated in CUIMC/NYP cohort (n = 2626). CONCLUSION: Findings support systemic inflammatory pathways in obesity-associated severe COVID-19 disease, particularly in patients < 65 years, captured by CRP and ESR. Contextualized in clinical trial findings, these results reveal therapeutic opportunity to target systemic inflammatory pathways and monitor interventions in high-risk subgroups and particularly obese patients.","Foulkes, Andrea S; Selvaggi, Caitlin; Shinnick, Daniel; Lumish, Heidi; Kim, Eunyoung; Cao, Tingyi; Thaweethai, Tanayott; Qian, Jing; Lu, Frances; Yan, Joyce; Cheng, David; He, Wei; Clerkin, Kevin J; Madhavan, Mahesh V; Meigs, James B; Triant, Virginia A; Lubitz, Steven A; Gupta, Aakriti; Bassett, Ingrid V; Reilly, Muredach P",J Clin Endocrinol Metab,267,28

Though these experiences often co-occur, health outcomes associated with their overlap have not previously been reviewed. We synthesised existing evidence on mortality, morbidity, self-rated health and quality of life among people affected by more than one of these experiences. METHODS: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched Medline, Embase, and PsycINFO for peer-reviewed English-language observational studies from high-income countries published between 1 January 1998 and 11 June 2018. Two authors undertook independent screening, with risk of bias assessed using a modified Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Findings were summarised by narrative synthesis and random-effect meta-analysis. RESULTS: From 15 976 citations, 2517 studies underwent full-text screening, and 444 were included. The most common exposure combinations were imprisonment/substance use (31% of data points) and severe mental illness/substance use (27%); only 1% reported outcomes associated with more than two exposures. Infections were the most common outcomes studied, with blood-borne viruses accounting for 31% of all data points. Multiple exposures were associated with poorer outcomes in 80% of data points included (sign test for effect direction, p<0.001). Meta-analysis suggested increased all-cause mortality among people with multiple versus fewer exposures (HR: 1.57 and 95% CI: 1.38 to 1.77), though heterogeneity was high. CONCLUSION: People affected by multiple exclusionary processes experience profound health inequalities, though there are important gaps in the research landscape. Addressing the health needs of these populations is likely to require co-ordinated action across multiple sectors, such as healthcare, criminal justice, drug treatment, housing and social security.

The purpose of this study is to determine the dosimetric feasibility of delivering magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-guided adaptive SABR in a single fraction for abdominal and thoracic metastases. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Previously delivered MRI-guided radiation therapy plans for 20 patients with oligometastatic disease in the thorax or abdomen, with 70% (14/20) of the lesions within 8 mm from dose-limiting organs at risk (OARs), were used to simulate the delivery of 24 Gy in a single fraction. Planning objectives included planning target volume (PTV) V(95%) >90%, optimized PTV (PTVopt) V(95%) >90%, and PTVopt D(99%) >20 Gy with no OAR dose violations, where PTVopt removed overlap with nearby planning organ at risk volume (PRV). Single-fraction plans were simulated on the first 5 daily setup breath-hold MRI scans, and the plans were reoptimized to consider variations in setup position and anatomy. RESULTS: The mean PTV V(95%) for single-fraction SABR plans was lower compared with multifraction plans (mean 85.4% vs 92.6%, P = .02), but mean PTVopt V(95%) was not different (95.3% vs 98.2%, P = .62). After reoptimization of the single-fraction plan to the treatment day MRI, there was an increase in mean PTV V(95%) (85.0% vs 88.1%, P = .05), increase in mean PTVopt V(95%) (92.7% vs 96.3%, P = .02), increase in mean PTVopt D(99%) (19.7 Gy vs 23.8 Gy, P < .01), increase in mean frequency of meeting PTV D(99%) >20 Gy (52% vs 87%, P < .01), and increase in mean gross tumor volume minimum dose (17.5 Gy vs 19.3 Gy, P < .01). Reoptimization decreased mean frequency of OAR dose constraint violation (48% vs 0%, P < .01). CONCLUSIONS: Single-fraction MRI-guided SABR is a dosimetrically feasible treatment for oligometastases that allows for on-table adaptation to avoid OAR dose constraint violations, but this method requires clinical validation.","Lee, Sangjune; Yadav, Poonam; van der Kogel, Albert J.; Bayouth, John; Bassetti, Michael F.",Adv Radiat Oncol,267,20

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic occurred in a time of outstanding scientific progress and global digitalization. Young people had relevant adverse psychological and behavioral effects due to the COVID-19 pandemic, mainly related to infection control measures, which led them to spend more time at home and with major use of technological tools. The goal this study proposes is to evaluate health and social outcomes of smartphone overuse among Italian children and adolescents during the COVID-19 pandemic, analyzing patterns and aims of utilization, as well as the eventual presence and degree of addiction. METHODS: This study was based on a self-report and anonymous questionnaire, which was administered to 184 Italian school-age (6–18 years) children and adolescents during the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. The test was electronically (email, whatsapp) explained and sent by pediatricians either directly to older children (middle and high school), or indirectly, through the help of teachers, to younger ones (primary school). All participants spontaneously and voluntarily joined the present study. The survey was made by 4 sections, and designed to know and outline modalities (frequency, patterns and aims) of smartphone use, adverse outcomes, and related parental behaviors, also in order to reveal the eventual occurrence and degree of addiction. The same information, related to the pre-epidemic period, was also investigated and analyzed. RESULTS: The data obtained revealed a significantly greater adhesion to the questionnaire by females, likely reflecting higher attention and interest than boys to initiatives relating to health education. Our study showed more frequent smartphone use among Italian children and adolescents during the COVID-19 pandemic, compared to the pre-epidemic period. This may be related to the social distancing measures adopted during the months under investigation. The present survey also outlined the changing patterns and aims in the use of smartphones among young people, which allowed to limit some effects of the crisis. Indeed, they were used for human connection, learning and entertainment, providing psychological and social support. Finally, it was observed a significant increase of overuse and addiction. This led to many clinical (sleep, ocular and musculoskeletal disorders), psychological (distraction, mood modification, loss of interest) and social (superficial approach to learning, isolation) unfavorable outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Pediatricians and health care professionals should be aware of the potential risks related to inappropriate use of smartphones. They should monitor, in cooperation with parents, possible associated adverse effects, in order to early recognize signs and symptoms suggestive, or at high risk, for addiction. They must carry out, as well, the necessary interventions to prevent and/or lower the detrimental impact of smartphone overuse on children and adolescents’ health, oriented to sustain adequate physical and psychological development as well as social relationships.","Serra, Gregorio; Lo Scalzo, Lucia; Giuffrè, Mario; Ferrara, Pietro; Corsello, Giovanni",Ital J Pediatr,267,16

Thus, the identification of Australian bat lyssavirus (ABLV) in 1996 in a debilitated bat found by a member of the public precipitated both public health consternation and a revision of lyssavirus taxonomy. Subsequent observational studies sought to elaborate the occurrence and frequency of ABLV infection in Australian bats. This paper describes the taxonomic diversity of bat species showing evidence of ABLV infection to better inform public health considerations. Blood and/or brain samples were collected from two cohorts of bats (wild-caught and diagnostic submissions) from four Australian states or territories between April 1996 and October 2002. Fresh brain impression smears were tested for ABLV antigen using fluorescein-labelled anti-rabies monoclonal globulin (CENTOCOR) in a direct fluorescent antibody test; sera were tested for the presence of neutralising antibodies using a rapid fluorescent focus inhibition test. A total of 3,217 samples from 2,633 bats were collected and screened: brain samples from 1,461 wild-caught bats and 1086 submitted bats from at least 16 genera and seven families, and blood samples from 656 wild-caught bats and 14 submitted bats from 14 genera and seven families. Evidence of ABLV infection was found in five of the six families of bats occurring in Australia, and in three of the four Australian states/territories surveyed, supporting the historic presence of the virus in Australia. While the infection prevalence in the wild-caught cohort is evidently low, the significantly higher infection prevalence in rescued bats in urban settings represents a clear and present public health significance because of the higher risk of human exposure.","Field, Hume Ernest",Zoonoses and Public Health,267,1

Particular attention must be paid to ultrafine particles (UFPs) size range, generated for instance by electrosurgical instruments (ESTs). OT contamination is also affected by ventilation systems, medical staff and their gowning system, staff routines, instruments, etc. This comparative study is based on experimental measurements of airborne microbial contamination and UFPs carried out during real ongoing surgeries in two OTs equipped with upward displacement ventilation (UWD) and hybrid ventilation, with unidirectional airflow on the operating table and peripheral mixing (UDAF+Mixing) ventilation systems. Airborne contamination concentration at the exit grilles has been analyzed as function of four different surgical phases normally performed during an operation. Results highlight that airborne contamination is influenced by the activities carried out during the surgical phases. EST usage affects the contamination level more than staff size during operation observed. Colony forming unit (CFU) values in the protected area close to the patient’s wound are influenced more by the type of ventilation system than by surgical phases. CFU values decrease by 18 to 50 times from the UWD system to the hybrid one. The large airflow volumes supply together with high air velocities in OTs equipped with UDAF+Mixing systems guarantee a better and a safer airborne contamination control for patients and medical team in comparison with UWD systems.","Romano, Francesco; Milani, Samanta; Gustén, Jan; Joppolo, Cesare Maria",Int J Environ Res Public Health,267,20

The need for practices that “open doors” at home as a way to promote a quality education and to foster an environment of supportive relationships and a sense of community, has led to the in-depth analysis of successful educational actions, particularly the Dialogic Literary Gatherings (DLGs). The aim of this article is to show how the transference of DLGs to the home environment has had an impact on child subjective well-being in times of confinement, promoting a safe and supportive environment for learning, interacting, coexisting and on emotional development at different educational stages, especially for the most vulnerable children. Data collection consisted of a focus group of 10 teachers, 6 semi-structured interviews addressed to families and 6 life stories of students, from 4 primary education centers, 1 high school, and 1 Special Education School. Communicative methodology structured the two-level data analysis, for studying both the elements provided by online DLGs that favor and achieve child well-being, and the elements that may hinder those achievements. The results confirm that DLGs have had a notorious impact on children’s and their families’ well-being. Considering the findings in the development of educational public policies and the possibility of extending “open doors actions” as an option for future learning environments beyond the confinement situation is contemplated. Future research on how these spaces can have an impact on child well-being in upcoming contexts of the new normal in the education domain will be of interest.","Ruiz-Eugenio, Laura; Roca-Campos, Esther; León-Jiménez, Susana; Ramis-Salas, Mimar",Front Psychol,267,6

Daylight photodynamic therapy (dPDT) is an effective and patient preferred treatment that uses sunlight to clear AK. Currently, there is no standardised method for measuring the light received during treatment. METHODS: SmartPDT® is a smartphone-based application and web-portal, developed by siHealth Ltd, enabling remote delivery of dPDT. It uses satellite imagery and computational algorithms to provide real-time determination of exposure to PpIX-effective solar radiation (“light dose”). The application also provides forecast of expected radiant exposures for 24- and 48 -hs prior to the treatment period. Validation of the real-time and forecasted radiant exposure algorithms was performed against direct ground-based measurement under all weather conditions in Chilton, UK. RESULTS: Agreement between direct ground measurements and satellite-determined radiant exposure for 2 -h treatment was excellent at -0.1% ± 5.1% (mean ± standard deviation). There was also excellent agreement between weather forecasted radiant exposure and ground measurement, 1.8% ± 17.7% at 24 -hs and 1.6% ± 25.2% at 48 -hs. Relative Root Mean Square of the Error (RMSE(r)) demonstrated that agreement improved as time to treatment reduced (RMSE(r) = 22.5% (48 -hs), 11.2% (24 -hs), 5.2% (real-time)). CONCLUSION: Agreement between satellite-determined, weather-forecasted and ground-measured radiant exposure was better than any existing published literature for dPDT. The SmartPDT® application and web-portal has excellent potential to assist with remote delivery of dPDT, an important factor in reducing risk in an elderly patient population during the Covid-19 pandemic.","McLellan, Luke J.; Morelli, Marco; Simeone, Emilio; Khazova, Marina; Ibbotson, Sally H.; Eadie, Ewan",Photodiagnosis Photodyn Ther,267,33

METHODS: A total of 27 patients with unilateral stage 2 breast cancer–related lymphedema (BCRL) were included in the study. Bilateral circumferential measurements were taken with a tape measure at different levels. Based on these measurements, limb volumes were determined by summing segment volumes derived from the truncated cone formula. Circumferential measurements and ultrasonographic evaluations (epidermis, dermis, and subcutaneous fat thicknesses) were performed at 10 cm distal to the elbow crease. The Semmes–Weinstein monofilament (SWM), static and moving two-point discrimination, pressure pain threshold (PPT), and tactile localization tests were also applied at the same site. After an initial evaluation, all patients underwent CDP phase 1 program. All the evaluations were repeated at the end of the treatment period. RESULTS: Before CDP, affected sides had significantly higher values than the unaffected sides in terms of SWM (p < 0.001), static (p = 0.002) and moving (p = 0.011) two-point discrimination, PPT (p = 0.001), and tactile localization (p < 0.001) values. After CDP, SWM (p = 0.002), static (p = 0.009) and moving (p = 0.024) two-point discrimination, PPT (p = 0.014), and tactile localization (p < 0.001) values decreased significantly on the affected sides. CONCLUSION: BCRL seems to reduce light touch, static and moving two-point discrimination, PPT, and tactile localization sensations, whereas CDP seems to improve these sensory perceptions in women with BCRL. Ultrasonographic measurements also appear to be promising for prompt and convenient follow-up in the management of BCRL.

ROS and p53 play key roles in regulating many kinds of cell process during viral infection, however, the exact function in PEDV-induced apoptosis remains unclear. In this study, the pro-apoptotic effect of PEDV was examined in Vero cells and we observed that PEDV infection increased MDM2 and CBP, promoted p53 phosphorylation at serine 20 and, promoted p53 nuclear translocation, leading to p53 activation in Vero cells. Treatment with the p53 inhibitor PFT-α could significantly inhibit PEDV-induced apoptosis. We also observed PEDV infection induced time-dependent ROS accumulation. Treatment with antioxidants, such as pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC) or N-acetylcysteine (NAC), significantly inhibited PEDV-induced apoptosis. Moreover, further inhibition tests were established to prove that p53 was regulated by ROS in PEDV-induced apoptosis. In addition, we also found that p38 MAPK and SAPK/JNK were activated in PEDV-infected Vero cells. However, treatment with the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580, and the SAPK/JNK inhibitor SP600125 reversed PEDV-induced apoptosis. Taken together, the results of this study demonstrate that activated p53 and accumulated ROS participated in PEDV-induced apoptosis and p53 could be regulated by ROS during PEDV infection. Activated p38 MAPK and SAPK/JNK exerted no influence on PEDV-induced apoptosis. These findings provide new insights into the function of p53 and ROS in the interaction of PEDV with Vero cells.","Xu, Xingang; Xu, Ying; Zhang, Qi; Yang, Feng; Yin, Zheng; Wang, Lixiang; Li, Qinfan",Vet Microbiol,267,16

This creates their mental issues such as distress, depression and anxiety. Exploring healthcare staff's mental health during the pandemic contributes to improving their persistence in the growing challenges created by COVID-19 and enabling effective management of their mental health. Methods: An online survey of 280 healthcare staff in all the 31 provinces of Iran was conducted during April 5 to 20, 2020. The survey assessed staff's distress, depression and anxiety in the COVID-19 pandemic. Results: Nearly a third of healthcare staff suffered from distress, depression and anxiety. Females and more educated healthcare staff were more likely to experience distress. Compared to personnel who did not have COVID-19, those who were unsure whether they had COVID-19 were more likely to experience distress and depression. The number of COVID-19 cases among the staff's colleagues or friends positively predicted their anxiety. Compared to radio technologists, doctors were less likely to experience distress and anxiety. Technicians and obstetrics experienced less anxiety. Analysis the interaction between weekly working days and age of the staff indicated the chance of experiencing distress and depression varied greatly by working days among younger but not older healthcare staff. Conclusion: Exploring the potential predictors of mental health issues assists healthcare organizations to develop approaches to prevent and decrease the issues among staff and improve their task performance in sever crises such as COVID-19, so they can stay motivated in the COVID-19 pandemic. It is useful to identify more working characteristic predictors for healthcare staff at different ages.","Xu, X.; Zhang, S. X.; Afshar Jahanshahi, A.; Li, J.; Bagheri, A.; Nawaser, K.",,267,22

We intend to conduct this randomised clinical trial to focus on short-term outcomes and quality of life (QOL) in totally laparoscopic distal gastrectomy (TLDG) and totally robotic distal gastrectomy (TRDG) for patients with clinical stage I–III gastric cancer. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This study is a prospective, multi-institutional, open-label randomised clinical trial that will recruit 722 patients with a 1:1 ratio (361 patients in the TLDG group and 361 patients in the TRDG group) from eight large-scale gastrointestinal medical centres in China. The primary endpoint is 30-day postoperative morbidity. The secondary endpoints include QOL, 30-day severe postoperative morbidity and mortality, anastomotic-related complication rate, conversion to open surgery rate, intraoperative and postoperative indicators, operative and total costs during hospitalisation, 1-year overall survival and disease-free survival.

The ongoing second wave, which commenced on February 27, presented cases in several clusters, the biggest of which was the Sri Petaling Tabligh cluster with an infection rate of 6.5%, and making up 47% of all cases in Malaysia. Subsequently, other clusters appeared from local mass gatherings and imported cases of Malaysians returning from overseas. Healthcare workers carry high risks of infection due to the daily exposure and management of COVID-19 in the hospitals. However, 70% of them were infected through community transmission and not while handling patients. In vulnerable groups, the incidence of COVID-19 cases was highest among the age group 55 to 64 years. In terms of fatalities, 63% were reported to be aged above 60 years, and 81% had chronic comorbidities such as diabetes, hypertension, and heart diseases. The predominant COVID-19 strain in Malaysia is strain B, which is found exclusively in East Asia. However, strain A, which is mostly found in the USA and Australia, and strain C in Europe were also present. To contain the epidemic, Malaysia implemented a Movement Control Order (MCO) beginning on March 18 in 4 phases over 2 months, ending on May 12. In terms of economic impacts, Malaysia lost RM2.4 billion a day during the MCO period, with an accumulated loss of RM63 billion up to the end of April. Since May 4, Malaysia has relaxed the MCO and opened up its economic sector to relieve its economic burden. Currently, the best approach to achieving herd immunity to COVID-19 is through vaccination rather than by acquiring it naturally. There are at least two candidate vaccines which have reached the final stage of human clinical trials. Malaysia's COVID-19 case fatality rate is lower than what it is globally; this is due to the successful implementation of early preparedness and planning, the public health and hospital system, comprehensive contact tracing, active case detection, and a strict enhanced MCO.","Hashim, Jamal Hisham; Adman, Mohammad Adam; Hashim, Zailina; Mohd Radi, Mohd Firdaus; Kwan, Soo Chen",Front Public Health,267,16

In addition to aligning individual particles, accurate registration of sample motion and 3D deformation during exposures are crucial for achieving high resolution reconstructions. Here we describe M, a software tool that establishes a reference-based, multi-particle refinement framework for cryo-EM data and couples a comprehensive spatial deformation model to in silico correction of electron-optical aberrations. M provides a unified optimization framework for both frame-series and tomographic tilt-series data. We show that tilt-series data can provide the same resolution as frame-series on a purified protein specimen, indicating that the alignment step no longer limits the resolution obtainable from tomographic data. In combination with Warp and RELION, M resolves to residue-level a 70S ribosome bound to an antibiotic inside intact bacterial cells.

The molecular determinants underlying the neutralization of the virus remain, however, incompletely understood. Here, we show that the ability of antibodies to disrupt the binding of the viral spike protein to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor on the cell, the key molecular event initiating SARS-CoV-2 entry into host cells, is controlled by the affinity of these antibodies to the viral antigen. By using microfluidic antibody-affinity profiling, we were able to quantify the serum-antibody mediated inhibition of ACE2–spike binding in two SARS-CoV-2 seropositive individuals. Measurements to determine the affinity, concentration, and neutralization potential of antibodies were performed directly in human serum. Using this approach, we demonstrate that the level of inhibition in both samples can be quantitatively described using the dissociation constants (K(D)) of the binary interactions between the ACE2 receptor and the spike protein as well as the spike protein and the neutralizing antibody. These experiments represent a new type of in-solution receptor binding competition assay, which has further potential applications, ranging from decisions on donor selection for convalescent plasma therapy, to identification of lead candidates in therapeutic antibody development, and vaccine development.","Fiedler, Sebastian; Piziorska, Monika A.; Denninger, Viola; Morgunov, Alexey S.; Ilsley, Alison; Malik, Anisa Y.; Schneider, Matthias M.; Devenish, Sean R.

Measures restricted movements to one outing per day for exercise and shopping and otherwise most people were restricted to their dwelling except for key workers (e.g. medical, supermarkets, and transport). In this study, we quantified changes to air quality across the United Kingdom from 30(th) March to 3(rd) May 2020 (weeks 14-18), the period of most stringent travel restrictions. Daily pollutant measurements of NO(2), O(3) and PM(2.5) from the national network of monitoring sites during this period were compared with measurements over the same period during 2017-19. Comparisons were also made with predicted concentrations for the 2020 period from business-as-usual (BAU) modelling, where the contributions of normal anthropogenic activities were estimated under the observed meteorological conditions. During the lockdown study period there was a 69% reduction in traffic overall (74% reduction in light and 35% in heavy vehicles). Measurements from 129 monitoring stations, identified mean reductions in NO(2) of 38.3% (-8.8 μg/m(3)) and PM(2.5) of 16.5% (-2.2 μg/m(3)). Improvements in NO(2) and PM(2.5) were largest at urban traffic sites and more modest at background locations where a large proportion of the population live. In contrast, O(3) concentrations on average increased by 7.6% (+4.8 μg/m(3)) with the largest increases at roadside sites due to reductions in local emissions of NO. A lack of VOC monitoring limited our capacity to interpret changes in O(3) at urban background locations. BAU models predicted comparable NO(2) reductions and O(3) gains, although PM(2.5) episodes would have been more prominent without lockdown. Results demonstrate the relatively modest contribution of traffic to air quality, suggesting that sustained improvements in air quality require actions across various sectors, including working with international and European initiatives on long-range transport air pollutants, especially PM(2.5) and O(3).","Jephcote, Calvin; Hansell, Anna L.; Adams, Kathryn; Gulliver, John",Environ Pollut,267,5

One mechanism of aging is the progressive shortening of telomeres, which are protective structures at chromosome ends. Critically short telomeres impair the regenerative capacity of tissues and trigger loss of tissue homeostasis and disease. The SARS-CoV-2 virus infects many different cell types, forcing cell turn-over and regeneration to maintain tissue homeostasis. We hypothesize that presence of short telomeres in older patients limits the tissue response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. We measure telomere length in peripheral blood lymphocytes COVID-19 patients with ages between 29 and 85 years-old. We find that shorter telomeres are associated to increased severity of the disease. Individuals within the lower percentiles of telomere length and higher percentiles of short telomeres have higher risk of developing severe COVID-19 pathologies.","Sanchez-Vazquez, Raul; Guío-Carrión, Ana; Zapatero-Gaviria, Antonio; Martínez, Paula; Blasco, Maria A.",Aging (Albany NY),267,5

It is necessary to analyze and predict its epidemic situation to help formulate effective public health policies. Autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models were developed to predict the cumulative confirmed, dead, and recovered cases, respectively. R 3.6.2 software was used to fit the data from January 31 to May 20, 2020, and predict the data for the next 30 days. The COVID-19 epidemic in Russia was divided into two stages and reached its peak in May. The epidemic began to stabilize on May 19. The case fatality rate has been at an extremely low level. ARIMA (2,2,1), ARIMA (3,2,0), and ARIMA (0,2,1) were the models of cumulative confirmed, dead, and recovered cases, respectively. After testing, the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of three models were 0.6, 3.9, and 2.4, respectively.

The most compelling reasons to develop rVSV as a vaccine vector include a very low seroprevalence in humans, the ability to infect and robustly express foreign antigens in a broad range of cells, and vigorous growth in continuous cell lines used for vaccine manufacture. Numerous preclinical studies with rVSV vectors expressing antigens from a variety of human pathogens have demonstrated the versatility, flexibility, and potential efficacy of the rVSV vaccine platform. When administered to nonhuman primates (NHPs), rVSV vectors expressing HIV-1 Gag and Env elicited robust HIV-1-specific cellular and humoral immune responses, and animals immunized with rVSV vectors expressing simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) Gag and HIV Env were protected from AIDS after challenge with a pathogenic SIV/HIV recombinant. However, results from an exploratory neurovirulence study in NHPs indicated that these prototypic rVSV vectors might not be adequately attenuated for widespread use in human populations. To address this safety concern, a variety of different attenuation strategies, designed to produce a range of further attenuated rVSV vectors, are currently under investigation. Additional modifications of further attenuated rVSV vectors to upregulate expression of HIV-1 antigens and coexpress molecular adjuvants are also being developed in an effort to balance immunogenicity and attenuation.","Clarke, David K.; Cooper, David; Egan, Michael A.; Hendry, R.

There is a growing acceptance of the utility of PM in health care and the role medical imaging can play. In response, this article explored the views and opinions of diagnostic and therapeutic academics and the utilization of PM in education. METHODS: This study primarily adopted a quantitative approach using an online survey. However, participants were also encouraged to provide qualitative comments in response to open-ended questions. The survey was distributed to radiography and radiotherapy academic departments, which received a response rate of 29%. RESULTS: The findings identify some important considerations. On the one hand some participants reported teaching PM on their programmes (24%, n = 16), whereas 30% (n = 20) did not. Importantly, the remaining academics (46%) were either unsure or did not know what PM was. This finding, coincided with qualitative commentary, highlights some discrepancies linked to knowledge and understanding of PM within higher education and highlights areas where academics may need additional support. CONCLUSION: This article concludes by recognizing the challenges of delivering PM by some academics. It is noted that although the findings cannot be fully generalized, it does highlight fragmented understanding of PM among academic staff. This is important to reflect upon following the increasing requirements for radiography to become “more personalized.”","Atutornu, Jerome; Hayre, Christopher M.",J Med Imaging Radiat Sci,267,2

METHODS: Samples were tested between 1996 and 2011 by the Department of Clinical Virology at the University of Veterinary Medicine, Vienna, Austria. All samples were sent to the university as part of routine diagnostic procedures, either to determine infection in clinically symptomatic individuals or to rule out infection prior to vaccination. To allow for statistical comparison, samples analysed between 2008 and 2011 were pooled into one population (n = 444) and evaluated against samples tested in 1996 (n = 840). Furthermore, analyses of subgroups were undertaken to determine the effect of sex and age on the prevalence of FeLV antigenaemia. RESULTS: With respect to the samples tested at the University of Veterinary Medicine in Vienna, it was determined that the level of FeLV antigenaemia in eastern Austria between 1996 and 2011 was 5.6%. The proportion of FeLV antigenaemic cats was highly variable and has not fallen significantly over this period, despite advances in vaccination, and the education of pet owners and animal welfare charities. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study confirms the importance of continued and regular vaccination against FeLV among Austrian cats, particularly those allowed access to the outdoors. Within the remit of this retrospective study, it was not possible to follow-up results of repeat testing or of other assays (PCR) of individual cats. As a result of this, no conclusions can be drawn as to the possibility of transient antigenaemic cats or false-positive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay results.","Firth, Clair L; Möstl, Karin",JFMS Open Rep,267,2

The authors sought to determine the impact of COVID‐19 on cancer treatment, anxiety, and financial distress among low‐income patients with gynecologic cancer during the peak of the NYC pandemic. METHODS: Medicaid‐insured women who were receiving gynecologic oncology care at 2 affiliated centers were contacted by telephone interviews between March 15 and April 15, 2020. Demographics and clinical characteristics were obtained through self‐report and retrospective chart review. Financial toxicity, anxiety, and cancer worry were assessed using modified, validated surveys. RESULTS: In total, 100 patients completed the telephone interview. The median age was 60 years (range, 19‐86 years), and 71% had an annual income <$40,000. A change in employment status and early stage cancer (stage I and II) were associated with an increase in financial distress (P < .001 and P = .008, respectively). Early stage cancer and telehealth participation were significantly associated with increased worry about future finances (P = .017 and P = .04, respectively). Lower annual income (<$40,000) was associated with increased cancer worry and anxiety compared with higher annual income (>$40,000; P = .036 and P = .017, respectively). When controlling for telehealth participation, income, primary language, and residence in a high COVID‐19 prevalence area, a delay in medical care resulted in a 4‐fold increased rate of anxiety (P = .023, 95% CI, 1.278‐14.50). Race was not significantly associated with increased financial distress, cancer worry, or anxiety. CONCLUSIONS: Low socioeconomic status was the most common risk factor for increased financial distress, cancer worry, and anxiety.

For patients at risk for asthma, or with existing asthma, viral respiratory tract infections can have a profound effect on the expression of disease or loss of control. New evidence has shown that wheezing episodes early in life with the common cold virus, human rhinovirus, is a major risk factor for the later diagnosis of asthma at age six years. For those with existing asthma, exacerbations are a major cause of morbidity, need for acute care and, rarely, death. Viral respiratory tract infections, most frequently with rhinovirus, are the predominant microorganisms associated with asthma exacerbations. Evidence is also emerging that deficiencies in antiviral activity and the integrity of the airway epithelial barrier may make individuals with asthma more likely to have severe viral respiratory infections of the lower airway, and thus increase the risk of exacerbation. Given the influences of respiratory viruses on many aspects of asthma, efforts to understand the mechanisms and risk factors by which these airway infections cause changes in airway pathophysiology are a first step in improved treatment.","Busse, William W.; Lemanske, Robert F.; Gern, James E.",The Lancet,267,1

These subphenotypes may be important in broader critically ill patient populations with acute respiratory failure regardless of clinical diagnosis. We investigated subphenotyping with latent class analysis in an inclusive population of acute respiratory failure, derived a parsimonious model for subphenotypic predictions based on a small set of variables, and examined associations with clinical outcomes. DESIGN: Prospective, observational cohort study. SETTING: Single-center, academic medical ICU. PATIENTS: Mechanically ventilated patients with acute respiratory failure. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We included 498 patients with acute respiratory failure (acute respiratory distress syndrome: 143, at-risk for acute respiratory distress syndrome: 198, congestive heart failure: 37, acute on chronic respiratory failure: 23, airway protection: 61, and multifactorial: 35) in our derivation cohort and measured 10 baseline plasma biomarkers. Latent class analysis considering clinical variables and biomarkers determined that a two-class model offered optimal fit (23% hyperinflammatory subphenotype). Distribution of hyperinflammatory subphenotype varied among acute respiratory failure etiologies (acute respiratory distress syndrome: 31%, at-risk for acute respiratory distress syndrome: 27%, congestive heart failure: 22%, acute on chronic respiratory failure 0%, airway protection: 5%, and multifactorial: 14%). Hyperinflammatory patients had higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment scores, fewer ventilator-free days, and higher 30- and 90-day mortality (all p < 0.001). We derived a parsimonious model consisting of angiopoietin-2, soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor-1, procalcitonin, and bicarbonate and classified subphenotypes in a validation cohort (n = 139). Hyperinflammatory patients (19%) demonstrated higher levels of inflammatory biomarkers not included in the model (p < 0.01) and worse outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Host-response subphenotypes are observable in a heterogeneous population with acute respiratory failure and predict clinical outcomes. Simple, biomarker-based models can offer prognostic enrichment in patients with acute respiratory failure. The differential distribution of subphenotypes by specific etiologies of acute respiratory failure indicates that subphenotyping may be more relevant in patients with hypoxemic causes of acute respiratory failure and not in patients intubated for airway protection or acute on chronic decompensation.","Drohan, Callie M.; Nouraie, S.

RESULTS: 34% of the participants reported that they will definitely get vaccinated against Covid-19 and 39% that they would “probably”. Intended uptake was strongly associated with age, opinion on the government’s dealing with the Covid-19 pandemic, medical risk, spoken language, gender, and to a lesser extent with having known someone who was hospitalised because of Covid-19. Similar predictors were identified for attitudes to vaccination in general. Covid-19 vaccine hesitancy was more marked in age groups below 54 years old. We further analysed a sample of 17% (N=349) found favourable to vaccination in general but not willing to vaccinate against Covid-19. They were mainly female, young, French speaking, slightly less educated, working, and did not belong to a Covid-19 risk group. They were very dissatisfied with the government’s dealing with the pandemic, and did not know someone who was hospitalised because of Covid-19. CONCLUSIONS: Vaccine hesitancy is higher for Covid-19 vaccines than for other vaccines. The part of the population being convinced of the utility of vaccination in general but hesitant about the Covid-19 vaccine is a primary interest group for tailored communication campaigns in order to reach the vaccine coverage needed for herd immunity.","Kessels, Roselinde; Luyten, Jeroen; Tubeuf, Sandy",Vaccine,267,3

We developed a simple, MS-based method to specifically detect SARS-CoV-2 proteins from gargle solution samples of COVID-19 patients. Our protocol consists of an acetone precipitation and tryptic digestion of proteins contained within the gargle solution, followed by a targeted MS analysis. Our methodology identifies unique peptides originating from SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein. Building on these promising initial results, faster MS protocols can now be developed as routine diagnostic tools for COVID-19 patients.

HIV-1 gp120, the major envelope glycoprotein on viral particles, acts as a binding protein for viral entry and is known to be an agent of neuronal cell death. To determine the mechanism of HIV-1 gp120-induced memory dysfunction, we performed mouse intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) infusion with HIV-1 gp120 protein (300 ng per mouse) and investigated memory impairment and amyloidogenesis. Infusion of the HIV-1 gp120 protein induced memory dysfunction, which was evaluated using passive avoidance and water maze tests. Infusion of HIV-1 gp120 induced neuroinflammation, such as the release of iNOS and COX-2 and the activation of astrocytes and microglia and increased the mRNA and protein levels of IL-6, ICAM-1, M-CSF, TIM, and IL-2. In particular, we found that the infusion of HIV-1 gp120 induced the accumulation of amyloid plaques and signs of elevated amyloidogenesis, such as increased expression of amyloid precursor protein and BACE1 and increased β-secretase activity. Therefore, these studies suggest that HIV-1 gp120 may induce memory impairment through Aβ accumulation and neuroinflammation.","Lee, Young-Jung; Yeo, In Jun; Choi, Dong Young; Yun, Jaesuk; Son, Dong Ju; Han, Sang-Bae; Hong, Jin Tae",Arch Pharm Res,267,24

Yet, there is still a great debate about their efficacy in combating COVID-19. This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility of intranasal and/or pulmonary administration of CQ/HCQ for COVID-19 using Bio/chemoinformatics tools. We, hereby, hypothesize the success of the intranasal and the pulmonary routes through a gelatin matrix to overcome several challenges related to CQ and HCQ pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics properties and to increase their local concentrations at the sites of initial viral entry while minimizing the potential side effects. Molecular docking on the gelatin-simulated matrix demonstrated high loading values and a sustained release profile. Moreover, the docking on mucin as well as various receptors including Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2), heparin sulphate proteoglycan and Phosphatidylinositol binding clathrin assembly protein (PICALM), which are expressed in the lung and intranasal tissues and represent initial sites of attachment of the viral particles to the surface of respiratory cells, has shown good binding of CQ and HCQ to these receptors. The presented data provide an insight into the use of a novel drug formulation that needs to be tested in adequately powered randomized controlled clinical trials; aiming for a sustained prophylaxis effect and/or a treatment strategy against this pandemic viral infection.","Hathout, Rania M.; Abdelhamid, Sherihan G.; Metwally, AbdelKader A.",Inform Med Unlocked,267,21
