162291,"A Synthesis of Subjective Scales Which Assess Worker Fatigue: Building a Simple, Reliable, and Effective Evaluative Instrument",2022,"INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVE Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic had exhibited negative effects on patients with a nicotine use disorder because of social stress situations. The objective of this study is to investigate the changes that occurred in the smoking habits of the patients who applied to our smoking cessation clinic because of the COVID-19 outbreak's effect (coronaphobia) on their mental health. METHOD In this study, we included the patients who applied to our smoking cessation clinic between January 1 and June 30, 2020. We conducted telephonic and face-to-face interviews with the patients during the outbreak, and inquired about the changes in their smoking habits. RESULTS In total, 114 volunteers (mean age: 41.2 years [min-max: 18-82 years], M/F: 70/44 [61.4/38.6%]) who registered in the smoking cessation clinic of Chest Diseases Clinic were included in the study. The number of people with and without coronaphobia was 64 (56.1%) and 50 (43.9%), respectively. The analyses of the changes in smoking behaviors because of coronaphobia demonstrated that people with coronaphobia exhibited a significantly higher decrease or cessation of smoking as compared to no change in smoking behavior or increase in the number of cigarettes (p: .006). CONCLUSIONS Success in smoking cessation can be increased with the accurate analyses of the anxiety effects caused by coronaphobia after COVID-19 outbreak on the desire of smoking cessation. This resolution depends on the solution-oriented strategies that will increase the awareness of physicians and patients, a close follow-up of patients with tools such as telemedicine, and a quick determination of their needs.","Ozcelik, Neslihan; Yilmaz Kara, Bilge",Journal of addictive diseases,https://doi.org/10.1080/10550887.2020.1849950; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33283686/,927

164938,An Analysis of Usability Levels of Ventilators During Covid-19: A Case Study,2021,"The utilization of computational photography becomes increasingly essential in the medical field. Today, imaging techniques for dermatology range from two-dimensional (2D) color imagery with a mobile device to professional clinical imaging systems measuring additional detailed three-dimensional (3D) data. The latter are commonly expensive and not accessible to a broad audience. In this work, we propose a novel system and software framework that relies only on low-cost (and even mobile) commodity devices present in every household to measure detailed 3D information of the human skin with a 3D-gradient-illumination-based method. We believe that our system has great potential for early-stage diagnosis and monitoring of skin diseases, especially in vastly populated or underdeveloped areas.","Nau, Merlin A.; Schiffers, Florian; Li, Yunhao; Xu, Bingjie; Maier, Andreas; Tumblin, Jack; Walton, Marc; Katsaggelos, Aggelos K.; Willomitzer, Florian; Cossairt, Oliver",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.00508v1.pdf,927
166006,Detection of Deviations from a Calm State of Mind Using Respiratory Waveforms and HRV - Aiming to Grasp the Driver’s Condition Remotely,2021,"The new next-generation sequencing platforms by Oxford Nanopore Technologies for direct RNA sequencing (direct RNA-seq) allow for an in-depth and comprehensive study of the epitranscriptome by enabling direct base calling of RNA modifications. Non-coding RNAs constitute the most frequently documented targets for RNA modifications. However, the current standard direct RNA-seq approach is unable to detect many of these RNAs. Here we present NERD-seq, a sequencing approach which enables the detection of multiple classes of non-coding RNAs excluded by the current standard approach. Using total RNA from a tissue with high known transcriptional and non-coding RNA activity in mouse, the brain hippocampus, we show that, in addition to detecting polyadenylated coding and non-coding transcripts as the standard approach does, NERD-seq is able to significantly expand the representation for other classes of RNAs such as snoRNAs, snRNAs, scRNAs, srpRNAs, tRNAs, rRFs and non-coding RNAs originating from LINE L1 elements. Thus, NERD-seq presents a new comprehensive direct RNA-seq approach for the study of epitranscriptomes in brain tissues and beyond.","Saville, Luke; Cheng, Yubo; Gollen, Babita; Mitchell, Liam; Stuart-Edwards, Matthew; Haight, Travis; Mohajerani, Majid; Zovoilis, Athanasios",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.06.442990,927

Currently, there are no molecular clones for USUV, hence, hindering studies on the pathogenesis and transmission of USUV. In this report, we demonstrate the development and characterization of infectious clones for two modern strains of USUV isolated from Europe and Africa. We show that the infectious clone-derived viruses replicated similarly to the parental strains in both mammalian and insect cells. Additionally, we observed similar levels of replication and pathogenesis in two mouse models. This reverse genetics system will aid the scientific community in studying and developing USUV infection, transmission, diagnostics, and vaccines.","Bates, Tyler; Chuong, Christina; Hawks, Seth A.; Rai, Pallavi; Duggal, Nisha K.; Weger-Lucarelli, James",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.05.238543,927

The arrangement of the study process in a digital form and using remote education technologies turned out to be a serious challenge for teachers, students and university administrations, IT departments, and academic registries. With this increased onlinification, a risk arises that the quality of education may deteriorate. The quality of remote education depends on many factors. One of the most important of those is compliance with the didactic principles of this training format that set a benchmark for the best implementation of the study process. This article deals with the justification of the extension of general didactic principles of traditional education and complementing those with the principles addressing the features of remote education for master’s degree programs. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Osipov, V.

Studies reporting the effects of human disasters and confinement in young people are limited. This study identifies the tensions experienced by 1057 adolescents as they redefine their relationship to family life, learning and school: mediation tools to their learning activities, spatio-temporal redefinition of their activities, modification of relationships with significant adults for them. Two theoretical frameworks are combined: the overlapping spheres of influence model and cultural historical activity theory. A questionnaire was sent online on an opensource survey software. The results present the demographic characteristics of the adolescents' participants and their family, their general state of mind and daily routines adjustments at school and at home, and their perceptions with regards to their relations to their peers, teachers and their parents' support. Findings pinpoint the tensions related to loss in the activity systems of adolescents as their school activity is challenged by the pandemic and proposes avenues to put in place a boundary zone to support the adolescent.","Barma, S.; Deslandes, R.; Ste-Marie, N.",Kulturno-Istoricheskaya Psikhologiya-Cultural-Historical Psychology,https://doi.org/10.17759/chp.2021170213,927
168516,Translating HFE into Action – Lessons from the Frontline,2021,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is caused due to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV-2), can be complicated with coagulopathy through disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) in severe stages leading to profuse morbidity and mortality. The prothrombotic character of DIC can potentiate a higher risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE), whose incidence among COVID-19 patients in intensive care units appears to be a bit higher and severe. The prevalence of VTE was high in the COVID-19 patients due to inflammation and stasis of blood vessel endothelium resulting from viral infection. D-dimer monitoring can help in early recognition, proper treatment, and better prognosis in the high-risk COVID-19 patients. Recent studies show that anticoagulant therapy reduces the mortality in severe COVID-19 patients with sepsis-induced coagulopathy or markedly elevated d-dimer. Direct oral anticoagulants or low-molecular-weight-heparin can be administrated in hospitalized COVID-19 patients to minimize thrombosis risk. However, constant observation on anticoagulant therapy and post-discharge thromboprophylaxis in COVID-19 patients is recommended.","Suvvari, T. K.; Kuppili, S.; Simhachalam Kutikuppala, L.

175033,Usability Review of Mask Extenders and Ear Savers,2021,"Liberibacter pathogens are the causative agents of several severe crop diseases worldwide, including citrus Huanglongbing and potato Zebra Chip. These bacteria are endophytic and non-culturable, which makes experimental approaches challenging and highlights the need for bioinformatic analysis in advancing our understanding about Liberibacter pathogenesis. Here, we performed an in-depth comparative phylogenomic analysis of the Liberibacter pathogens and their free-living, nonpathogenic, ancestral species, aiming to identify the major genomic changes and determinants associated with their evolutionary transitions in living habitats and pathogenicity. We found that prophage loci represent the most variable regions among Liberibacter genomes. Using gene neighborhood analysis and phylogenetic classification, we systematically recovered, annotated, and classified all prophage loci into four types, including one previously unrecognized group. We showed that these prophages originated through independent gene transfers at different evolutionary stages of Liberibacter and only the SC-type prophage was associated with the emergence of the pathogens. Using ortholog clustering, we vigorously identified two additional sets of genomic genes, which were either lost or gained in the ancestor of the pathogens. Consistent with the habitat change, the lost genes were enriched for biosynthesis of cellular building blocks. Importantly, among the gained genes, we uncovered several previously unrecognized toxins, including a novel class of polymorphic toxins, a YdjM phospholipase toxin, and a secreted EEP protein. Our results substantially extend the knowledge on the evolutionary events and potential determinants leading to the emergence of endophytic, pathogenic Liberibacter species and will facilitate the design of functional experiments and the development of new detection and blockage methods of these pathogens. Importance Liberibacter pathogens are associated with several severe crop diseases, including citrus Huanglongbing, the most destructive disease to the citrus industry. Currently, no effective cure or treatments are available, and no resistant citrus variety has been found. The fact that these obligate endophytic pathogens are not culturable has made it extremely challenging to experimentally uncover from the whole genome the genes/proteins important to Liberibacter pathogenesis. Further, earlier bioinformatics studies failed to identify the key genomic determinants, such as toxins and effector proteins, that underlie the pathogenicity of the bacteria. In this study, an in-depth comparative genomic analysis of Liberibacter pathogens together with their ancestral non-pathogenic species identified the prophage loci and several novel toxins that are evolutionarily associated with the emergence of the pathogens. These results shed new lights on the disease mechanism of Liberibacter pathogens and will facilitate the development of new detection and blockage methods targeting the toxins.","Tan, Yongjun; Wang, Cindy; Schneider, Theresa; Li, Huan; de Souza, Robson Francisco; Tang, Xueming; Hsieh, Tzung-Fu; Wang, Xu; Li, Xu; Zhang, Dapeng",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.06.02.446850,927
175661,A Survey on the Effects of the Covid-19 in the Brazilian Population Lifestyle,2021,"Targeting MAIT cells holds promise for the treatment of different diseases and infections. We previously showed that treatment of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infected mice with 5-OP-RU, a major antigen for MAIT cells, expands MAIT cells and enhances bacterial control. Here we treated M. tuberculosis infected rhesus macaques with 5-OP-RU intratracheally but found no clinical or microbiological benefit in M. tuberculosis infected macaques. In fact, after 5-OP-RU treatment MAIT cells did not expand, but rather upregulated PD-1 and lost the ability to produce multiple cytokines, a phenotype resembling T cell exhaustion. Furthermore, we show that vaccination of uninfected macaques with 5-OP-RU+CpG instillation into the lungs also drives MAIT cell dysfunction, and PD-1 blockade during vaccination partly prevents the loss of MAIT cell function without facilitating their expansion. Thus, in rhesus macaques MAIT cells are prone to the loss of effector functions rather than expansion after TCR stimulation in vivo, representing a significant barrier to therapeutically targeting these cells.","Sakai, Shunsuke; Lora, Nickiana E.; Kauffman, Keith D.; Dorosky, Danielle E.; Oh, Sangmi; Namasivayam, Sivaranjani; Gomez, Felipe; Fleegle, Joel D.; Lindestam Arlehamn, Cecilia S.; Sette, Alessandro; Sher, Alan; Freeman, Gordon J.; Via, Laura E.; Barry, Clifton E.; Barber, Daniel L.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.29.428844,927

This event followed the 7th February 2021 Rishi Ganga (debris flow induced) flash flood within less than three months. This note analyses the plausible causes of the avalanche using pre-disaster field survey data, supported by the limited geological and remote sensing based geomorphological investigations as the site could not be investigated due to remoteness of the location and travel restrictions due to COVID pandemic. The present observations suggest that active and relict cirques to the north of the South Tibetan Detachment System (STDS) are the sites for potential snow and debris avalanches under the projected warming trends in the western Himalaya.

178679,Government Strategies in the Confrontation of Covid-19 in the Republic of Cuba,2021,"Lockdown measures and mobility restrictions implemented to combat the spread of the novel COVID-19 virus have impacted energy consumption patterns, particularly in the United States. A review of available data and literature on the impact of the pandemic on energy consumption is performed to understand the current knowledge on this topic. The overall decline of energy use during lockdown restrictions can best be identified through the analysis of energy consumption by source and enduser breakdown. Using monthly energy consumption data, the total 9-months use between January and September for the years 2015-2020 are calculated for each end-use. The cumulative consumption within these 9 months of the petroleum, natural gas, biomass, and electricity energy by the various end-use sectors are compared to identify a shift in use throughout time with the calculation of the percent change from 2019 to 2020. The analysis shows that the transportation sector experienced the most dramatic decline, having a subsequent impact on the primary energy it uses. A steep decline in the use of petroleum and natural gas by the transportation sector has had an inevitable impact on the emission of carbon dioxide and other air pollutants during the pandemic. Additionally, the most current data for the consumption of electricity by each state and each end-user in the times before and during the pandemic highlights the impact of specific lockdown procedures on energy use. The average total consumption for each state was found for the years 2015-2019. This result is used calculation of yearly growth rate and average annual growth rate in 2020 for each state and end-user. The total average annual growth rate for 2020 was used to find a correlation coefficient between COVID-19 case and death rates as well as population density and lockdown duration. To further examine the relationship a correlation coefficient was calculated between the 2020 average annual growth rate for all sectors and average annual growth rate for each individual end-user.

178953,The Lived Experience of Nurses Wearing Facemasks During COVID-19 Pandemic: An Ergonomic Study,2021,"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic was declared in the UK in February 2020, impacting significantly on healthcare. Delivery of systemic anti-cancer treatment (SACT) rapidly adapted to minimize patient exposure to SARS-CoV-2. The risks of SACT and concomitant COVID-19 infection are unknown. Here we report the patient/tumour characteristics of pts with any GYN cancer undergoing SACT during the first wave to understand risks of SACT and establish clinical guidelines for safe management in the ongoing SARS-CoV2 pandemic. Methods: Demographic and clinical characteristics of GYN cancer pts receiving at least one SACT between 1st March- 31st May 2020 (first wave COVID-19) were compared to the same three month timeframe in 2019. SARS-CoV2 infection was defined as a positive RT-PCR test for COVID-19. Pts with symptoms or radiological changes alone were not considered SARS-COV2 positive. As part of the Guy's Cancer Cohort we collected information on age, ethnicity, performance status (PS), cancer type, stage (Stg), treatment (SACT, surgery, radiotherapy) and COVID-19 infection. Results: There were no COVID-19 related deaths. 1 pt (0.5%) had SACT delay due to confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Overall mortality at 6 months in each timeframe was 6.9% in 2020 and 8.1% in 2019. In the comparative 3-month intervals, similar numbers of GYN cancer pts received SACT in 2020 compared to 2019: 170 patients (126 ovarian;44 non-ovarian) in 2020, 184 (131 ovarian;53 nonovarian) in 2019. Median age was 61y in both groups and BAME ethnicity was balanced. In 2020, more pts had Stg III/IV disease (93%) than 2019 (84%) and fewer had Stg I/II disease (7%) compared to 2019 (16%). PS was: 0-1 in 92% of patients in 2020 vs 85% in 2019. The average number of cycles of SACT delivered in each time frame was 3. In 2020 9% received neoadjuvant SACT of which 69% proceeded to planned surgery and 31% were deemed unfit. Comparatively, in 2019 7% received neoadjuvant SACT of whom 75% proceeded to surgery and 25% were deemed unfit. In 2020, 3 pt received chemoradiation compared to 8 in 2019. 40 of 170 pts (24%) had 1-5 week treatment delays in 2020 due to any aetiology with. In 2019 there were treatment delays in 63 of 184 pts (34%). The use of GCSF in support of all SACT regimens was 52% in 2020 vs 11% in 2019. Conclusions: There was no increase in mortality associated with SACT during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in GYN cancer pts. 0.5% of pts had confirmed SARS-COV2 infection. We were able to maintain full SACT delivery for all GYN cancer pts with average cycle number unchanged between 2019 and 2020. There was no significant reduction in surgical debulking rates. In contrast, there was a reduction in GYN cancer pts receiving chemoradiation. More pts presented with Stg III/IV disease in 2020. Increased use of GSCF may have contributed to the reduced chemotherapy delays in 2020. Further research will explore the impact of vaccination.","Michalarea, V.; Germanou, S.; Nevajda, A.

The problem of inconsistency was amplified by JOTPY?s model of shared authority and its status as a global curatorial consortium with dozens of partners. JOTPY was able to address this issue of metadata consistency by employing, training, and tasking hourly student curators called the Curation Crew. The Curation Crew underwent rigorous curatorial training and was, despite their lack of experience in archival curation, able to achieve an impressive level of curatorial consistency. They are now recognized as JOTPY?s greatest quality control assets and have even begun to, themselves, contribute to the development of best practices. In addition to their data-cleaning tasks, the Curation Crew also directs its labors toward recording their own thoughts and feelings by generating several submissions per week.

The focus is on primary education and on decisions to close schools, or not. Our research was informed by assemblage theory in order to analyse how different components interacted in developing societal responses to mitigate the pandemic. The research was designed as a comparative case study of practical reasoning in diverse contexts. Data sources were the mass media and statements from governments and authorities. Our analyses showed that decisions to close schools, or not, were based on two alternative discourses on schooling. Closing primary schools was a preventive measure underlined by discourses of schools as places for infection. Keeping primary schools open was underlined by a discourse in which schools were conceived of as a place for social supportive measures and caring. Furthermore, the closing alternative was often combined with attempts to replace school practices by distance learning or computerized instruction. Legal constitutions and lawmaking were of significant importance in selecting discourses and the relative impact of different components, mostly political or medical, in responding to the pandemic.","Lindblad, Sverker Wärvik Gun-Britt Berndtsson Inger Jodal Elsi-Brith Lindqvist Anders Messina Dahlberg Giulia Papadopoulos Dimitrios Runesdotter Caroline Samuelsson Katarina Udd Jonas Wyszynska Johansson Martina",European Educational Research Journal,https://doi.org/10.1177/14749041211041237,927

180245,The Virtual World: A Challenge for On-Site Action in Ergonomics,2021,"Our goals are to address challenges such as latency, scalability, throughput and heterogeneous data sources of streaming analytics and deep learning pipelines in science sensors and medical imaging applications. We present a prototype Intelligent Parallel Distributed Streaming Framework (IPDSF) that is capable of distributed streaming processing as well as performing distributed deep training in batch mode. IPDSF is designed to run streaming Artificial Intelligent (AI) analytic tasks using data parallelism including partitions of multiple streams of short time sensing data and high-resolution 3D medical images, and fine grain tasks distribution. We will show the implementation of IPDSF for two real world applications, (i) an Air Quality Index based on near real time streaming of aerosol Lidar backscatter and (ii) data generation of Covid-19 Computing Tomography (CT) scans using deep learning. We evaluate the latency, throughput, scalability, and quantitative evaluation of training and prediction compared against a baseline single instance. As the results, IPDSF scales to process thousands of streaming science sensors in parallel for Air Quality Index application. IPDSF uses novel 3D conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN) training using parallel distributed Graphic Processing Units (GPU) nodes to generate realistic 3D high resolution Computed Tomography scans of Covid-19 patient lungs. We will show that IPDSF can reduce cGAN training time linearly with the number of GPUs. © 2021 ACM.","Shivadekar, S.; Mangalagiri, J.; Nguyen, P.; Chapman, D.; Halem, M.; Gite, R.","50th International Conference on Parallel Processing Workshop, ICPP 2021",https://doi.org/10.1145/3458744.3474039,927
180298,It Takes Two to Tango: Communication at Work During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021,"Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) economies are facing a substantial increase in the information and communication technology (ICT) investments in the context of rapid spread of the Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-2019) pandemic and constraints of emissions reduction. However, the mechanism of the impact of ICT investments on carbon dioxide is still unclear. Therefore, by employing the decoupling-factor model and Generalized Divisia Index Method, we explore the decoupling states of ICT investments and emission intensity, and the driving factors of ICT investments’ scale, intensity, structure, and efficiency effects on carbon emissions in 20 OECD economies between 2000 and 2018. The results indicate that the number of economies with an ideal state of strong decoupling rose to nine between 2009 and 2018 compared to no economies between 2000 and 2009. The emission intensity of ICT investments contributes to a significant increase of carbon emissions, and the structure and efficiency of ICT investments always restrain the growth of carbon emissions. Significant emissions changes caused by the driving factors are shown in many economies before and after the crisis, reflecting the differences in the strategic choices of ICT investments and the impact on emissions due to the crisis such as the COVID-2019 pandemic. And policy implications for energy and carbon dioxide mitigation strategies in the post-COVID-2019 era are also provided.","Wang, Jianda Jiang Qingzhe Dong Xiucheng Dong Kangyin",Applied Energy,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2021.117618,927
180497,Digital Solutions for Workplace Mental Health Promotion During COVID-19 Pandemic: Taxonomy and Human Factors Issues,2021,"Abstract Background: A cytokine storm and lymphopenia are reported in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection associated with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Myeloid-derived suppressive cells (MDSCs) exist in two different forms, granulocyte (G-MDSCs) and monocytic (M-MDSCs) that both suppress T-cell function. Serum IL-6 and IL-8 levels seem to correlate with the number of blood MDSCs. Objective: To determine the frequency of MDSCs in severe COVID-19 patients from Iran and their correlations with serum IL-8 levels. Methods: 37 severe (8 on ventilation, 29 without ventilation) and 13 moderate COVID-19 patients together with 8 healthy subjects were enrolled at the Masih Daneshvari Hospital, Tehran-Iran between 10th April 2020- 9th March 2021. Clinical and biochemical features, serum and whole blood were obtained. CD14, CD15, CD11b and HLA-DR expression on MDSCs was measured by flow cytometry. Results: M-MDSCs (P[≤]0.0001) and G-MDSCs (P[≤]0.0001) frequency were higher in Iranian COVID-19 patients compared to healthy subjects. M-MDSC frequency was higher in non-ventilated compared to moderate COVID-19 subjects (P=0.004). Serum IL-8 levels were higher in patients with COVID-19 than in normal healthy subjects (P=0.03). IL8 level was significant difference in ventilated, non-ventilated and moderate patients (P=0.005). The frequency of G-MDSCs correlated negatively with INR (r=-0.39, P=0.02). Conclusion: Serum IL-8 levels did not correlate with the number of systemic MDSCs in COVID-19 patients. The highest levels of M-MDSCs were seen in the blood of severe non-ventilated patients. MDSC frequency in blood in the current study did not predict the survival and severity of COVID-19 patients.

We evaluated the utility of age-adjusted Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) as a predictor of outcomein COVID-19 patients treated with remdesivir. Materials and methods: This was a single-center, retrospective study on 126 COVID-19 patients treated with remdesivir. The age-adjusted CCI, length of hospital stay (LOS), need for invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), and survival were recorded. Results: The mean and standard deviation (SD) of age-adjusted CCI were 3.37 and 2.186, respectively. Eighty-six patients (70.5%) had ageadjusted CCI <= 4, and 36 (29.5%) had age-adjusted CCI >4. Among patients with age-adjusted CCI <= 4, 20 (23.3%) required IMV, whereas in thosewith age-adjusted CCI >4, 19 (52.8%) required IMV (p <0.05, Pearson's chi-square test). In those with age-adjusted CCI <= 4, the mortality was18.6%, whereas it was 41.7% in patients with age-adjusted CCI >4 (p <0.05, Pearson's chi-square test). The receiver operating curve (ROC) ofage-adjusted CCI for predicting the mortality had an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.709, p = 0.001, and sensitivity 68%, specificity 62%, and95% confidence interval (CI) [0.608, 0.810], for a cutoff score >4. The ROC for age-adjusted CCI for predicting the need for IMV had an AUC of0.696, p = 0.001, and sensitivity 67%, specificity 63%, and 95% CI [0.594, 0.797], for a cutoff score >4. ROC for age-adjusted CCI as a predictorof prolonged LOS (>= 14 days) was insignificant. Conclusion: In COVID-19 patients, the age-adjusted CCI is an independent predictor of the need for IMV (score >4) and mortality (score >4) but is not useful to predict LOS (CTRI/2020/11/029266).","Shanbhag, V.; Arjun, N.

As the CAF manages its own healthcare system for its members, it must consider the impact of COVID-19 not only on the operational effectiveness of its workforce but also on its healthcare operations. Furthermore, given that the CAF has deployed task forces in support of other government departments, including into long-term care facilities that are experiencing outbreaks, it is important for the CAF to maintain situational awareness of the outbreak in the Canadian population generally. In providing analytical support to the CAF on these questions, we focused on establishing the applicability of estimates of COVID-19 infection fatality rates (IFRs) from the literature to the CAF and to the Canadian public. This paper explores how the age-dependent effects of COVID-19 must be taken into account when comparing estimates based on countries with very different age profiles, such as China and Italy. Furthermore, it explores how varying age structures within a country (e.g., within a subnational jurisdiction, or within a given working population) should affect how analysts apply estimates of IFR to scenarios involving those specific populations.

Because of the location and high flow dynamics of these lesions, neurosurgeons may have a difficulty deciding between endovascular treatment and open surgical treatment. We report on a patient who underwent endovascular treatment with liquid embolic agent. A 50-year-old man with a decreased mental state and a tonic seizure event was brought to our hospital. Computed tomography (CT) of the brain showed a subcortical hematoma in the right temporoparietal lobe. On three-dimensional cerebral artery CT, there was no evidence of definite cerebrovascular abnormality. Cerebral angiography showed a pial AVF supplied by the right middle cerebral artery with early drainage into the right superior cerebral vein. The patient was treated with Onyx embolization for definitive closure of the fistula. The patient was transferred to the department of rehabilitation medicine two weeks later with grade 4 left hemiparesis.

207679,Exploring the Impact of COVID-19 on Nurse Workload and Quality of Care via Computerized Simulation,2021,"We model the impact of restricting socioeconomic activities (SA) on the transmission of COVID-19 globally. Countries initiate public health measures to slow virus transmission, ranging from stringent quarantines including city lockdown to simpler social distancing recommendations. We use satellite readings of NO2, a pollutant emitted from socioeconomic activities, as a proxy for the level of social-economic restrictions, and discuss the implications under the influences of weather. We found that restricting SA has a leading contribution to lowering the reproductive number of COVID-19 by 18.3% ± 3.5%, while air temperature, the highest contributor among all weather-related variables only contributes 8.0% ± 2.6%. The reduction effects by restricting SA becomes more pronounced (23% ± 3.0%) when we limited the data to China and developed countries where the indoor climate is mostly controlled. We computed the spared infectees by restricting SA until mid-April. Among all polities, China spared 40,964 (95% CI 31,463-51,470) infectees with 37,727 (95% CI, 28,925-47,488) in the Hubei Province, the epicenter of the outbreak. Europe spared 174,494 (95% CI 139,202-210,841) infectees, and the United States (US) spared 180,336 (95% CI 142,860-219,445) with 79,813 (95% CI 62,887-97,653) in New York State. In the same period, many regions except for China, Australia, and South Korea see a steep upward trend of spared infectees due to restricting SA with the US and Europe far steeper, signaling a greater risk of reopening the economy too soon. Latin America and Africa show less reduction of transmissivity through the region-by-time fixed effects than other regions, indicating a higher chance of becoming an epicenter soon.","Shen, Xinyi; Cai, Chenkai; Li, Hui",Sci Total Environ,,927

269144,Forensic Police’s Work Simulation to Support Product Development in Times of Pandemic,2021,"RATIONALE & OBJECTIVE: Patients with kidney failure who are receiving maintenance dialysis have a higher risk of infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and worse clinical outcomes after coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) than the general population. Therefore, immunization against SARS-CoV-2 with effective vaccines is an important component of health-maintenance strategies for these patients. This study evaluated the humoral and cellular responses to messenger RNA (mRNA) SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in this population. STUDY DESIGN: Observational prospective multicenter cohort study. SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: 205 patients treated at 3 dialysis units at the Hospital Clínic of Barcelona (Spain) were vaccinated from February 3 to April 4, 2021, and followed until April 23, 2021. EXPOSURE: Immunization with either the mRNA-1273 (Moderna) or BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine. OUTCOME: Seroconversion, defined as the detection of IgG antibodies to the receptor-binding domain of the S1 spike antigen of SARS-CoV-2 (anti-S1-RBD IgG), and the identification of activated CD4+T cells 3 weeks after completing vaccination. Anti-S1-RBD IgG levels were also analyzed as a secondary outcome. ANALYTICAL APPROACH: Univariate and multivariable logistic and multiple linear regression models were used to evaluate the associations between vaccination and study outcomes. RESULTS: We found that 97.7% of 175 vaccinated patients who were seronegative at baseline developed a response (humoral, cellular, or both); 95.4% of these patients seroconverted, while 62% of those tested for cellular immunity had a positive response. Greater age and immunosuppressive treatment were associated with lower antibody levels. LIMITATIONS: Mandatory vaccine administration by health authorities. Anti-S1-RBD IgG levels were reported up to 150U/mL and cellular immune responses were characterized qualitatively. Antibody assay and cellular response assessment may not be comparable with previously published laboratory approaches. CONCLUSIONS: Immunization with mRNA vaccines generated a humoral and cellular immune response in a high proportion of patients with kidney failure receiving maintenance dialysis. These findings as well as the high risk of infection and poor clinical outcomes among these patients make their vaccination a health priority.","Broseta, José Jesús; Rodríguez-Espinosa, Diana; Rodríguez, Néstor; Mosquera, María Del Mar; Marcos, María Ángeles; Egri, Natalia; Pascal, Mariona; Soruco, Erica; Bedini, José Luis; Bayés, Beatriu; Maduell, Francisco",Am. j. kidney dis,,927

The CDC, China, managed to track the source of infection to a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV; SARS-CoV-2) that shares approximately 79.6% of its genome with SARS-CoV. The World Health Organization (WHO) initially declared COVID-19 as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) and later characterized it as a global pandemic on March 11, 2020. Due to the novel nature of this virus, there is an urgent need for vaccines and therapeutics to control the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and its associated disease, COVID-19. Global efforts are underway to circumvent its further spread and treat COVID-19 patients through experimental vaccine formulations and therapeutic interventions, respectively. In the absence of any effective therapeutics, we have devised h bioinformatics-based approaches to accelerate global efforts in the fight against SARS-CoV-2 and to assist researchers in the initial phase of vaccine and therapeutics development. In this study, we have performed comprehensive meta-analyses and developed an integrative resource, “CoronaVR” (http://bioinfo.imtech.res.in/manojk/coronavr/). Predominantly, we identified potential epitope-based vaccine candidates, siRNA-based therapeutic regimens, and diagnostic primers. The resource is categorized into the main sections “Genomes,” “Epitopes,” “Therapeutics,” and Primers.” The genome section harbors different components, viz, genomes, a genome browser, phylogenetic analysis, codon usage, glycosylation sites, and structural analysis. Under the umbrella of epitopes, sub-divisions, namely cross-protective epitopes, B-cell (linear/discontinuous), T-cell (CD4 +/CD8 +), CTL, and MHC binders, are presented. The therapeutics section has different sub-sections like siRNA, miRNAs, and sgRNAs. Further, experimentally confirmed and designed diagnostic primers are earmarked in the primers section. Our study provided a set of shortlisted B-cell and T-cell (CD4 +and CD8 +) epitopes that can be experimentally tested for their incorporation in vaccine formulations. The list of selected primers can be used in testing kits to identify SARS-CoV-2, while the recommended siRNAs, sgRNAs, and miRNAs can be used in therapeutic regimens. We foresee that this resource will help in advancing the research against coronaviruses.","Gupta, Amit Kumar; Khan, Md.

OBJECTIVE: We studied phyto-compounds from Strychnos nux-vomica (a poisonous plant) against SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase by computational methods. METHOD: Molecular docking, molecular dynamics (MD) simulation and energetics calculations were employed to elucidate the role of the phyto-compounds. RESULTS: Ergotamine with a binding free energy of -14.39 kcal/mol showed a promising capability in terms of both the binding affinity and interacting to conserved motifs, especially the SDD signature sequence. The calculated dissociation constants for ATP, ergotamine, isosungucine and sungucine were 12 µM, 0.072 nM, 0.011 nM and 0.152 nM, respectively. The exhibited kd by these phyto-compounds reflected a tens of thousands fold potency as compared to ATP. The binding free energies of sungucine and isosungucine were much lower (-13.93 and -15.55 kcal/mol, respectively) compared to that of ATP (-6.98 kcal/mol). CONCLUSION: Sharing the same binding location as that of ATP and having high binding affinities, Ergotamine, Isosungucine, Sungucine and Strychnine N-oxide could be effective in controlling the SARS-CoV-2 virus replication by blocking the ATP and inhibiting the enzyme function.","Balkrishna, Acharya; Pokhrel, Subarna; Varshney, Anurag",Current molecular medicine (Online),,927

We aimed to establish whether infectious epidemics are associated with any changes in the incidence of suicide or the period prevalence of self-harm, or thoughts of suicide or self-harm, with a secondary objective of establishing the frequency of these outcomes. METHODS: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO and AMED were searched from inception to 9 September 2020. Studies of infectious epidemics reporting outcomes of (a) death by suicide, (b) self-harm or (c) thoughts of suicide or self-harm were identified. A random-effects model meta-analysis for the period prevalence of thoughts of suicide or self-harm was conducted. RESULTS: In total, 1354 studies were screened with 57 meeting eligibility criteria, of which 7 described death by suicide, 9 by self-harm, and 45 thoughts of suicide or self-harm. The observation period ranged from 1910 to 2020 and included epidemics of Spanish Flu, severe acute respiratory syndrome, human monkeypox, Ebola virus disease and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Regarding death by suicide, data with a clear longitudinal comparison group were available for only two epidemics: SARS in Hong Kong, finding an increase in suicides among the elderly, and COVID-19 in Japan, finding no change in suicides among children and adolescents. In terms of self-harm, five studies examined emergency department attendances in epidemic and non-epidemic periods, of which four found no difference and one showed a reduction during the epidemic. In studies of thoughts of suicide or self-harm, one large survey showed a substantial increase in period prevalence compared to non-epidemic periods, but smaller studies showed no difference. As a secondary objective, a meta-analysis of thoughts of suicide and self-harm found that the pooled prevalence was 8.0% overall (95% confidence interval (CI) 5.2-12.0%; 14 820 of 99 238 cases in 24 studies) over a time period of between seven days and six months. The quality assessment found 42 studies were of high quality, nine of moderate quality and six of high quality. CONCLUSIONS: There is little robust evidence on the association of infectious epidemics with suicide, self-harm and thoughts of suicide or self-harm. There was an increase in suicides among the elderly in Hong Kong during SARS and no change in suicides among young people in Japan during COVID-19, but it is unclear how far these findings may be generalised. The development of up-to-date self-harm and suicide statistics to monitor the effect of the current pandemic is an urgent priority.","Rogers, J P; Chesney, E; Oliver, D; Begum, N; Saini, A; Wang, S; McGuire, P; Fusar-Poli, P; Lewis, G; David, A S",Epidemiol Psychiatr Sci,,927

A Mixed Study",2021,"Chest X-ray is the first imaging technique that plays an important role in the diagnosis of COVID-19 disease. Due to the high availability of large-scale annotated image datasets, great success has been achieved using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image recognition and classification. However, due to the limited availability of annotated medical images, the classification of medical images remains the biggest challenge in medical diagnosis. Thanks to transfer learning, an effective mechanism that can provide a promising solution by transferring knowledge from generic object recognition tasks to domain-specific tasks. In this paper, we validate and adopt our previously developed CNN, called Decompose, Transfer, and Compose (DeTraC), for the classification of COVID-19 chest X-ray images. DeTraC can deal with any irregularities in the image dataset by investigating its class boundaries using a class decomposition mechanism. The experimental results showed the capability of DeTraC in the detection of COVID-19 cases from a comprehensive image dataset collected from several hospitals around the world. High accuracy of 95.12% (with a sensitivity of 97.91%, a specificity of 91.87%, and a precision of 93.36%) was achieved by DeTraC in the detection of COVID-19 X-ray images from normal, and severe acute respiratory syndrome cases.","Abbas, Asmaa; Abdelsamea, Mohammed M.; Gaber, Mohamed Medhat",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.13815v1.pdf,927
