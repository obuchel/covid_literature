74730,From health emergency preparedness to response action: a long journey in Lebanon.,2020-08-25,"Objective.We derive and demonstrate how residual voltage (RV) from a biphasic electrical stimulation pulse can be used to recognize degradation at the electrode-tissue interface.Approach.Using a first order model of the electrode-tissue interface and a rectangular biphasic stimulation current waveform, we derive the equations for RV as well as RV growth over several stimulation pulses. To demonstrate the use of RV for damage detection, we simulate accelerated damage on sputtered iridium oxide film (SIROF) electrodes using potential cycling. RV measurements of the degraded electrodes are compared against standard characterization methods of cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy.Main results.Our theoretical discussion illustrates how an intrinsic RV arises even from perfectly balanced biphasic pulses due to leakage via the charge-transfer resistance. Preliminary data inin-vivorat experiments follow the derived model of RV growth, thereby validating our hypothesis that RV is a characteristic of the electrode-tissue interface. RV can therefore be utilized for detecting damage at the electrode. Our experimental results for damage detection show that delamination of SIROF electrodes causes a reduction in charge storage capacity, which in turn reflects a measurable increase in RV.Significance.Chronically implanted electrical stimulation systems with multi-electrode arrays have been the focus of physiological engineering research for the last decade. Changes in RV over time can be a quick and effective method to identify and disconnect faulty electrodes in large arrays. Timely diagnoses of electrode status can ensure optimal long term operation, and prevent further damage to the tissue near these electrodes.","Krishnan, Ashwati; Forssell, Mats; Du, Zhanhong; Cui, X Tracy; Fedder, Gary K; Kelly, Shawn K",Journal of neural engineering,https://doi.org/10.1088/1741-2552/ac028a; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34400592/,894

The use of 5α-reductase inhibitor (5-ARI) is restricted to the patients with large prostate volumes, whose symptoms are refractory to antiandrogens or α- adrenergic blockers Out of the various synthesized5-reductase inhibitors with different substituents on steroidal nucleus, esters have been found to exhibited high anti-androgenic activity. METHODS In our attempt to find new, safer and potent 5-ARI and our continued interest in azasteorids, esters of 17a-Aza-Dhomo-5-androsten-3β-ol with synergistic effect were synthesized and characterized using different analytical techniques. The compounds were evaluated for their 5α-reductase inhibitory activity in-vivo by their effect on serum androgen level by ELISA assay procedure. The interaction with receptors was studied using advanced docking programme to predict the correlation of the synthesized compounds with actual biological activity. RESULTS The target compounds (6-12) showed increased anti-androgenic activity as compared to finasteride and control, which imply that the target compounds are effective in inhibiting 5α-reductase. Particularly, compound 6 showing highest inhibitory activity and greater affinity for 5-AR receptor with highest dock score. Results of these studies when compared with Finasteride showed increased solubility and dissolution of target compound 6. CONCLUSION Compound6 showed immense potential with improved efficacy and better bioavailability, thus makes it a suitable candidate for further studies and optimal formulation.","Rana, Priyanka; Dhingra, Neelima; Arora, Poonam; Dhingra, Richa; Chauhan, Monika; Gupta, Ankit",Current drug discovery technologies,https://doi.org/10.2174/1570163817666200922120406; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32962621/,894

METHODS Sagittal reconstructed computed tomography (CT) images of the lumbar spine in consecutive patients (n=581) undergoing CT scans of abdominal or lumbar regions for reasons other than low back disorders were obtained; lumbar lordosis (LL), L5-S1 angle, and sacral slope (SS) were measured. Lumbopelvic parameters in patients with or without spondylolysis were evaluated in three age groups (<50, 50-69, and ≥70). The influence of bilateral L5 spondylolysis (L5-lysis) and L5 vertebral slip on each lumbopelvic parameter, and correlation between cross-sectional area (CSA) of paraspinal muscles and the degree of vertebral slip were examined by multiple regression analysis. RESULTS Patients with bilateral spondylolysis showed greater LL and SS than patients without spondylolysis. When analyzing the influence of L5-lysis, only elderly patients (≥70) with L5-lysis showed significantly greater LL and SS than non-spondylolysis (non-lysis) patients. L5-lysis patients more frequently showed L5 vertebral slip than non-lysis patients and smaller L5-S1 angle was observed when L5 vertebral slip accompanied L5-lysis. The degree of vertebral slip was significantly correlated with CSA of psoas muscles, but not with CSA of paraspinal extensor muscles. CONCLUSIONS When patients have L5-lysis, lumbar lordosis and pelvic anteversion occurred age-dependently. In elderly patients with L5-lysis, L5 vertebral slip with decrease of L5-S1 angle frequently occurs. The progression of vertebral slip was correlated with atrophy of psoas muscles, but not that of paraspinal extensor muscles.","Aoki, Yasuchika; Kubota, Go; Inoue, Masahiro; Takahashi, Hiroshi; Watanabe, Atsuya; Nakajima, Takayuki; Sato, Yusuke; Nakajima, Arata; Saito, Junya; Eguchi, Yawara; Orita, Sumihisa; Fukuchi, Hiroyuki; Sakai, Takayuki; Ochi, Shigehiro; Yanagawa, Noriyuki; Nakagawa, Koichi; Ohtori, Seiji",World neurosurgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.wneu.2020.12.097; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33385597/,894

135675,"Knowledge, attitudes, and practices of Sudanese residents towards COVID-19.",2020-06-24,"BACKGROUND Operating rooms contribute between 20% to 70% of hospital waste. This study aimed to evaluate the waste burden of neurointerventional procedures performed in a radiology department, identify areas for waste reduction, and motivate new greening initiatives. METHODS We performed a waste audit of 17 neurointerventional procedures at a tertiary-referral center over a 3-month period. Waste was categorized into five streams: general waste, clinical waste, recyclable plastic, recyclable paper, and sharps. Our radiology department started recycling soft plastics from 13 December 2019. Hence, an additional recyclable soft plastic waste stream was added from this time point. The weight of each waste stream was measured using a digital weighing scale. RESULTS We measured the waste from seven cerebral digital subtraction angiograms (DSA), six mechanical thrombectomies (MT), two aneurysm-coiling procedures, one coiling with tumour embolization, and one dural arteriovenous fistula embolization procedure. In total, the 17 procedures generated 135.3 kg of waste: 85.5 kg (63.2%) clinical waste, 28.0 kg (20.7%) general waste, 14.7 kg (10.9%) recyclable paper, 3.5 kg (2.6%) recyclable plastic, 2.2 kg (1.6%) recyclable soft plastic, and 1.4 kg (1.0%) of sharps. An average of 8 kg of waste was generated per case. Coiling cases produced the greatest waste burden (13.1 kg), followed by embolization (10.3 kg), MT (8.8 kg), and DSA procedures (5.1 kg). CONCLUSION Neurointerventional procedures generate a substantial amount of waste, an average of 8 kg per case. Targeted initiatives such as engaging with suppliers to revise procedure packs and reduce packaging, digitizing paper instructions, opening devices only when necessary, implementing additional recycling programs, and appropriate waste segregation have the potential to reduce the environmental impact of our specialty.","Shum, Pey Ling; Kok, Hong Kuan; Maingard, Julian; Schembri, Mark; Bañez, Ramon Martin Francisco; Van Damme, Vivienne; Barras, Christen; Slater, Lee-Anne; Chong, Winston; Chandra, Ronil V; Jhamb, Ashu; Brooks, Mark; Asadi, Hamed",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,https://doi.org/10.1136/neurintsurg-2020-016380; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32680876/,894
140730,"[COVID-19 epidemic, a challenge successfully overcome by intensive care nurses].",2021,"Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) infects alveolar macrophages (AMϕ), causing dysregulated alpha interferon (IFN-α) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) production through a mechanism(s) yet to be resolved. Here, we show that AMϕ infected with PRRSV secreted a reduced quantity of IFN-α following exposure of the cell to synthetic double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). This reduction did not correlate with reduced IFNA1 gene transcription. Rather, it coincided with two events that occurred late during infection and that were indicative of translational attenuation, specifically, the activation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2α (eIF2α) and the appearance of stress granules. Notably, the typical rapid production of TNF-α by AMϕ exposed to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was suppressed or enhanced by PRRSV, depending on when the LPS exposure occurred after virus infection. If exposure was delayed until 6 h postinfection (hpi) so that the development of the cytokine response coincided with the time in which phosphorylation of eIF2α by the stress sensor PERK (protein kinase RNA [PKR]-like ER kinase) occurred, inhibition of TNF-α production was observed. However, if LPS exposure occurred at 2 hpi, prior to a detectable onset of eIF2α phosphorylation, a synergistic response was observed due to the earlier NF-κB activation via the stress sensor IRE1α (inositol-requiring kinase 1α). These results suggest that the asynchronous actions of two branches of the unfolded protein response (UPR), namely, IRE1α, and PERK, activated by ER stress resulting from the virus infection, are associated with enhancement or suppression of TNF-α production, respectively.IMPORTANCE The activation of AMϕ is controlled by the microenvironment to deter excessive proinflammatory cytokine responses to microbes that could impair lung function. However, viral pneumonias frequently become complicated by secondary bacterial infections, triggering severe inflammation, lung dysfunction, and death. Although dysregulated cytokine production is considered an integral component of the exacerbated inflammatory response in viral-bacterial coinfections, the mechanism responsible for this event is unknown. Here, we show that PRRSV replication in porcine AMϕ triggers activation of the IRE1α branch of the UPR, which causes a synergistic TNF-α response to LPS exposure. Thus, the severe pneumonias typically observed in pigs afflicted with PRRSV-bacterial coinfections could result from dysregulated, overly robust TNF-α production in response to opportunistic pathogens that is not commensurate with the typical restrained reaction by uninfected AMϕ. This notion could help in the design of therapies to mitigate the severity of viral and bacterial coinfections.","Chen, Wei-Yu; Schniztlein, William M; Calzada-Nova, Gabriela; Zuckermann, Federico A",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.01251-17; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29070690/,894

We report on a preliminary experience of a laparoscopic colpoplasty to restore a normal vaginal length. Patients with shortened vaginas after a laparoscopic colpohysterectomy were considered for a laparoscopic modified Davydov's procedure to create a new vaginal vault using the peritoneum of the rectum and bladder. From 2010 to 2014, 8 patients were offered this procedure, after informed preoperative consent. Indications were 2 extensive recurrent vaginal intraepithelial neoplasias grade 3 and 6 radical hysterectomies for cervical cancer. Mean vaginal length before surgery was 3.8 cm (standard deviation, 1.6). Median operative time was 50 minutes (range, 45-90). Blood loss was minimal (50-100 mL). No perioperative complications occurred. Median vaginal length at discharge was 11.3 cm (range, 9-13). Sexual intercourse could be resumed around 10 weeks after surgery. At a median follow-up of 33.8 months (range, 2.4-51.3), 6 patients remained sexually active but 2 had stopped. Although this experience is small, this laparoscopic modified Davydov's procedure seems to be an effective procedure, adaptable to each patient's anatomy. If the initial postoperative regular self-dilatation is carefully observed, vaginal patency is durably restored and enables normal sexual function.","Leblanc, Eric; Bresson, Lucie; Merlot, Benjamin; Puga, Marco; Kridelka, Frederic; Tsunoda, Audrey; Narducci, Fabrice",Journal of minimally invasive gynecology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmig.2015.08.877; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26299773/,894

For the purposes of the one-factor regression models of the relationship between the signs for the analyzed factors, volume of external cargo transportation, volume of internal cargo transportation and amount of investment in SCM software were built, and the correlation coefficients were also determined. The research was based on data of the Russian Federation, China and Germany.FindingsAccording to the results, for local cargo transportation for all three counties (Russian Federation: R² = 0.3679, China: R² = 0.441, Germany: 0.441), the correlation coefficients indicated no connection between the factors under study, while for external ones, they denoted a strong direct relationship: Russian Federation: R² = 0.906, China: R² = 0.8692, Germany: 0.926. It is statistically confirmed that external transportations are carried out by enterprises involved in GSCs, while the local ones are mainly performed by the domestic market-oriented companies.Originality/valueThe study presents a model for the formation of economic mechanisms of SCM from the perspective of a systemic approach. It allows for structural analysis of the SCM strategy’s impact on the functioning of participants within three management levels (corporate, business and functional). The study contributes to the practical domain of SCM: the results of the study can be applied by top managers of companies in developing SCM strategies, as well as by officials in developing and implementing governmental supply chain-related policies. In terms of scientific contribution, the research can also be of use: its methods and results can be applied by scientists in researching approaches to the economic mechanisms formation for managing supply chains on export and import volumes, as well as local cargo transportation in various countries and regions.","Saenko, Natalya Gakosso Chancelvie Nyanga Mezhlumyan Nelli Smirnov Artem Rogulin Rodion","Foresight : the Journal of Futures Studies, Strategic Thinking and Policy",https://doi.org/10.1108/fs-10-2020-0111,894

MATERIALS AND METHODS Twenty-three suspected patients and 64 patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-Cov-2 infection were admitted to a designated hospital. Epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and treatment data were collected and analyzed. RESULTS Of the 64 patients studied, 47 (73.4%) had been exposed to a confirmed source of COVID-19 transmission. On admission, the most common symptoms were fever (75%) and cough (76.6%). Twenty-eight (43.8%) COVID-19 patients showed leukopenia, 10 (15.6%) showed lymphopenia, 47 (73.4%) and 41 (64.1%) had elevated high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), respectively, and 30 (46.9%) had increased fibrinogen concentration. After the treatment, the counts of white blood cells and platelets, and the level of prealbumin increased significantly, while aspartate aminotransferase (AST), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and hsCRP decreased. COVID-19 patients with the hospital stay longer than 12 days had higher body mass index (BMI) and increased levels of AST, LDH, fibrinogen, hsCRP, and ESR. CONCLUSIONS Results of blood tests have potential clinical value in COVID-19 patients.","An, Xu-Sheng; Li, Xiang-Yu; Shang, Fu-Tai; Yang, Shu-Feng; Zhao, Jun-Yan; Yang, Xiao-Zhong; Wang, Hong-Gang",Annals of clinical and laboratory science,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32581016/,894
198703,Burden of acute respiratory disease of epidemic and pandemic potential in the WHO Eastern Mediterranean Region: A literature review.,2016,"In March 2003, the Institute of Medicine published an update to its 1992 landmark report on emerging infections. The new report, Microbial Threats to Health: Emergence, Detection, and Response, describes the current spectrum of global microbial threats, factors affecting their emergence or resurgence, and measures that should be undertaken to effectively address them. Coincident with this publication came increasing reports of severe atypical pneumonia of unknown etiology among persons in southeast Asia. This new disease, designated severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), spread globally in a matter of weeks, infecting primarily close contacts of index patients (e.g., household members and healthcare workers caring for index patients) but also resulting in community transmission in some areas. An unprecedented worldwide collaborative effort was undertaken to determine the cause of the illness and implement prevention measures. A previously unrecognized coronavirus was identified as the causative agent, and health officials throughout the world struggled to implement measures to contain its spread, including isolation of suspect SARS cases and quarantine of exposed persons. The emergence of SARS is a timely reminder of the need to expect the unexpected and to ensure strong national and global public health partnerships when preparing for and responding to infectious diseases. Effectively addressing the threat of SARS will require enhanced global infectious disease surveillance, the development of rapid diagnostics, new therapies, and vaccines, implementation of aggressive evidence-based infection control strategies, and effective communication.","Hughes, James M",Transactions of the American Clinical and Climatological Association,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17060979/,894

267496,[SARS-CoV-2: the experience of the Legouest armed forces teaching hospital],2020,"A deficient interferon (IFN) response to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection has been implicated as a determinant of severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). To identify the molecular effectors that govern IFN control of SARS-CoV-2 infection, we conducted a large-scale gain-of-function analysis that evaluated the impact of human IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) on viral replication. A limited subset of ISGs were found to control viral infection, including endosomal factors inhibiting viral entry, RNA binding proteins suppressing viral RNA synthesis, and a highly enriched cluster of endoplasmic reticulum (ER)/Golgi-resident ISGs inhibiting viral assembly/egress. These included broad-acting antiviral ISGs and eight ISGs that specifically inhibited SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1 replication. Among the broad-acting ISGs was BST2/tetherin, which impeded viral release and is antagonized by SARS-CoV-2 Orf7a protein. Overall, these data illuminate a set of ISGs that underlie innate immune control of SARS-CoV-2/SARS-CoV-1 infection, which will facilitate the understanding of host determinants that impact disease severity and offer potential therapeutic strategies for COVID-19.","Martin-Sancho, Laura; Lewinski, Mary K; Pache, Lars; Stoneham, Charlotte A; Yin, Xin; Becker, Mark E; Pratt, Dexter; Churas, Christopher; Rosenthal, Sara B; Liu, Sophie; Weston, Stuart; De Jesus, Paul D; O039,; Neill, Alan M; Gounder, Anshu P; Nguyen, Courtney; Pu, Yuan; Curry, Heather M; Oom, Aaron L; Miorin, Lisa; Rodriguez-Frandsen, Ariel; Zheng, Fan; Wu, Chunxiang; Xiong, Yong; Urbanowski, Matthew; Shaw, Megan L; Chang, Max W; Benner, Christopher; Hope, Thomas J; Frieman, Matthew B; García-Sastre, Adolfo; Ideker, Trey; Hultquist, Judd F; Guatelli, John; Chanda, Sumit K",Mol. cell,,894
664816,COVID-19 and family planning in the Eastern Mediterranean Region.,2021-09-21,"Population ageing is one of the most significant challenges facing the world in the twenty-first century. Furthermore, people aged over 65 typically have a level of income below the national average, but the homeownership rate among those in this age group tends to be high. Equity release schemes, specifically reverse mortgages, can help cover increased care costs and ensure a reasonable level of income, thus guaranteeing the well-being of older adults. However, this product has not been greatly developed by private entities. If the State were to implement this financial operation through public administrations, it could obtain homes that might then be included in public housing stocks. Thus, our paper aims to contribute to the literature on government-based reverse mortgage systems. Under our assumptions, the results showed that if 313,833 homes were reverse-mortgaged, the investment by the public administration would be around 0.73% GDP, with this being a feasible proposal. This work helps to create alternative methods to finance problems related with the ageing of societies from a public perspective.","Martinez-Lacoba, Roberto; Pardo-Garcia, Isabel; Escribano-Sotos, Francisco",J Hous Built Environ,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10901-020-09794-w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33223978/,894
