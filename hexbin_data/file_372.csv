2765,Th17 profile in COPD exacerbations,2017-06-22,"COPD is characterized by an ongoing inflammatory process of the airways that leads to obstruction or limitation of airflow. It is mainly associated with exposure to cigarette smoke. In addition, it is considered, at present, a serious public health problem, ranking fourth in mortality worldwide. Many cells participate in the pathophysiology of COPD, the most important are neutrophils, macrophages and CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Neutrophil migration to the inflammation area could be mediated largely by cytokines related to CD4+ Th17 lymphocytes, because it has been shown that IL-17A, IL-17F and IL-22 act as inducers for CXCL8, CXCL1, CXCL5, G-CSF, and GM-CSF secretion by epithelial cells of the airways. The aims of these molecules are differentiation, proliferation and recruitment of neutrophils. Furthermore, it is believed that CD4+ lymphocytes Th17 may be involved in protection against pathogens for which Th1 and Th2 are not prepared to fight. In COPD exacerbations, there is an increased cellularity in the lung region and respiratory tract. Therefore, the increase in the number of neutrophils and macrophages in the airways and the increase in proinflammatory cytokines are directly related to the severity of exacerbations and that is the importance of the functions of Th17 profile in this entity.","Ponce-Gallegos, Marco Antonio; Ramírez-Venegas, Alejandra; Falfán-Valencia, Ramcés",Int J Chron Obstruct Pulmon Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5491572/,372

7499,Emergency and Critical Care of Ferrets,2017-04-20,"We investigated whether pretransplantation immunosuppression with canine-specific rabbit antithymocyte globulin (ATG), combined with a suboptimal dose of 1 Gy of total body irradiation (TBI), would permit engraftment of canine dog leukocyte antigen-identical marrow. Cumulative ATG doses of 2 to 5 mg/kg produced a T-cell depletion of 1 log in the peripheral blood and 50% in the lymph nodes. Serum levels of ATG peaked on days 4 to 6 after initiation of therapy and became undetectable by day 13 as a result of canine antibody responses to ATG. ATG prolonged allogeneic skin graft survival to 14 days (n = 5), compared with 8 days in control dogs (P = .0003). Five dogs were given marrow transplants after ATG (3.5–5 mg/kg) and 1 Gy of TBI. Posttransplantation immunosuppression consisted of mycophenolate mofetil and cyclosporine. All dogs showed initial engraftment, with maximum donor chimerism levels of 25%. However, only 1 dog achieved sustained engraftment, and 4 rejected their grafts. The duration of engraftment ranged from 8 to ≥36 weeks (median, 11 weeks), and this is comparable to that in 6 historical controls not given ATG (range, 3–12 weeks; median, 10 weeks; P = .20). The total nucleated cell doses in the marrow grafts had the highest correlation coefficient with the duration of engraftment: 0.82 (P = .09). We concluded that administering ATG before an otherwise suboptimal conditioning dose of 1 Gy of TBI failed to secure uniform stable hematopoietic engraftment.","Diaconescu, Razvan; Little, Marie-Térèse; Leisenring, Wendy; Yunusov, Murad; Hogan, William J.; Sorror, Mohamed L.; Baron, Frédéric; Storb, Rainer",Biol Blood Marrow Transplant,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7110519/,372

7598,Adverse Reactions to Vaccination: From Anaphylaxis to Autoimmunity,2017-11-29,"BACKGROUND: Limited information is available regarding intraoperative ventilator settings and the incidence of postoperative pulmonary complications (PPCs) in patients undergoing neurosurgical procedures. The aim of this post-hoc analysis of the ‘Multicentre Local ASsessment of VEntilatory management during General Anaesthesia for Surgery’ (LAS VEGAS) study was to examine the ventilator settings of patients undergoing neurosurgical procedures, and to explore the association between perioperative variables and the development of PPCs in neurosurgical patients. METHODS: Post-hoc analysis of LAS VEGAS study, restricted to patients undergoing neurosurgery. Patients were stratified into groups based on the type of surgery (brain and spine), the occurrence of PPCs and the assess respiratory risk in surgical patients in Catalonia (ARISCAT) score risk for PPCs. RESULTS: Seven hundred eighty-four patients were included in the analysis; 408 patients (52%) underwent spine surgery and 376 patients (48%) brain surgery. Median tidal volume (V(T)) was 8 ml [Interquartile Range, IQR = 7.3–9] per predicted body weight; median positive end–expiratory pressure (PEEP) was 5 [3 to 5] cmH(2)0. Planned recruitment manoeuvres were used in the 6.9% of patients. No differences in ventilator settings were found among the sub-groups. PPCs occurred in 81 patients (10.3%). Duration of anaesthesia (odds ratio, 1.295 [95% confidence interval 1.067 to 1.572]; p = 0.009) and higher age for the brain group (odds ratio, 0.000 [0.000 to 0.189]; p = 0.031), but not intraoperative ventilator settings were independently associated with development of PPCs. CONCLUSIONS: Neurosurgical patients are ventilated with low V(T) and low PEEP, while recruitment manoeuvres are seldom applied. Intraoperative ventilator settings are not associated with PPCs.","Robba, Chiara; Hemmes, Sabrine N. T.; Serpa Neto, Ary; Bluth, Thomas; Canet, Jaume; Hiesmayr, Michael; Hollmann, M.

8985,Canine Vaccination,2015-01-13,"We have previously shown an age-associated increase in unique CD4+CD8+ intestinal intraepithelial lymphocytes (i-IEL) in rats. To elucidate the potential causes of the increase in CD4+CD8+ i-IEL with age, we analyzed the specificity of the CD4+CD8+ i-IEL and influence of intestinal microflora on the increase in this subset in aged rats. The purified CD4+CD8+ i-IEL proliferated in response to DnaK [Escherichia colt (E. coli) HSP70] in the presence of mitomycin-c (MMC)-treated syngeneic, spleen cells. The proportion of CD4+CD8+ T cells in whole i-IEL were significantly increased in aged rats fed commercial (CL-2) diet but not in those fed home-made (purified) diet under conventional condition. No CD4+CD8+ i-IEL were detected in aged rats under germfree condition, irrespective of diet feeding. A larger number of Enterobacteriaceae, especially E. coli, were detected in the intestinal contents and feces from aged rats with CD4+CD8+ i-IEL compared with those from aged rats fed without CD4+CD8+ i-IEL. The unique CD4+CD8+ i-IEL population specific for E. coli HSP may be associated with long term exposure to intestinal E. coli in aged rats.","Kimura, Yuki; Sakai, Tetsu; Takeuchi, Makoto; Matsumoto, Yoshihiro; Watanabe, Kouichi; Yuuki, Masakatsu; Takada, Toshihiko; Yoshikai, Yasunobu",Immunobiology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7134423/,372
9012,Possible Association of Thymus Dysfunction with Fading Syndromes in Puppies and Kittens,2015-01-20,"The possible role of interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) in the resistance of A/J mice to MHV3 infection was investigated. Monoclonal antibodies specific for IFN-γ, CD4 and CD8 molecules were administered in vivo to deplete selectively the IFN-y synthesized or the appropriate subset of T cells. The animals were then infected with MHV3 and the course of infection was followed by studying different parameters, such as, the mortality, the virus growth in the tissues and the IFN-γ synthesis in sera and peritoneal exudates. After MHV3 infection, a full resistance of control A/J mice was observed, in contrast to the high mortality rate observed among the depleted animals, where higher virus titers were found in different tissues. The IFN-γ synthesis in sera and peritoneal exudates of depleted mice, after MHV3 infection, drastically decreased when compared to that detected in control mice. The data presented are consistent with the hypothesis that IFN-γ plays an essential role in the resistance of A/J mice to MHV3 infection.","A. Lucchiari, Maria; Modolell, Manuel; Eichmann, Klaus; A.

9025,Diseases of Quail,2015-01-20,"In this paper, the impact of human migration on the dynamics of dengue epidemic has been discussed. The vector-host model considers two patches with different dengue serotype in each patch. The model considers the constant rate of migration in susceptible and recovered class from one patch to other. Recovered migrants from prior infection are exposed to secondary infection in the patch where different serotype is present. The basic reproduction number is computed and analyzed in terms of migration parameters. The model is analyzed for the existence and local stability of various equilibrium states in terms of migration parameters. The numerical simulations for the choice of relevant data from literature have been performed to verify analytical results and to further explore the dynamics of the system. The sensitivity analysis of basic reproduction number with respect to migration parameters is carried out. It is found that immigration in a patch increases the basic reproduction in respective patch and vice-versa. The basic reproduction number has been estimated for the two states of Brazil which verifies the occurrence of severe epidemic in one of the states of Brazil.","Mishra, Arti; Gakkhar, Sunita",Int J Appl Comput Math,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7134536/,372

19291,Step-Up and Step-Down Treatment Approaches for COPD: A Holistic View of Progressive Therapies,2021-07-12,"BACKGROUND: Meta-analyses typically consider multiple outcomes and report univariate effect sizes considered as independent. Multivariate meta-analysis (MVMA) incorporates outcome correlation and synthesises direct evidence and related outcome estimates within a single analysis. In a series of meta-analyses from the critically ill literature, the current study contrasts multiple univariate effect estimates and their precision with those derived from MVMA. METHODS: A previous meta-epidemiological study was used to identify meta-analyses with either one or two secondary outcomes providing sufficient detail to structure bivariate or tri-variate MVMA, with mortality as primary outcome. Analysis was performed using a random effects model for both odds ratio (OR) and risk ratio (RR); borrowing of strength (BoS) between multivariate outcome estimates was reported. Estimate comparisons, β coefficients, standard errors (SE) and confidence interval (CI) width, univariate versus multivariate, were performed using Lin’s concordance correlation coefficient (CCC). RESULTS: In bivariate meta-analyses, for OR (n = 49) and RR (n = 48), there was substantial concordance (≥ 0.69) between estimates; but this was less so for tri-variate meta-analyses for both OR (n = 25; ≥ 0.38) and RR (≥ -0.10; n = 22). A variable change in the multivariate precision of primary mortality outcome estimates compared with univariate was present for both bivariate and tri-variate meta-analyses and for metrics. For second outcomes, precision tended to decrease and CI width increase for bivariate meta-analyses, but was variable in the tri-variate. For third outcomes, precision increased and CI width decreased. In bivariate meta-analyses, OR coefficient significance reversal, univariate versus MVMA, occurred once for mortality and 6 cases for second outcomes. RR coefficient significance reversal occurred in 4 cases; 2 were discordant with OR. For tri-variate OR meta-analyses reversal of coefficient estimate significance occurred in two cases for mortality, nine cases for second and 7 cases for third outcomes. In RR meta-analyses significance reversals occurred for mortality in 2 cases, 6 cases for second and 3 cases for third; there were 7 discordances with OR. BoS was greater in trivariate MVMAs compared with bivariate and for OR versus RR. CONCLUSIONS: MVMA would appear to be the preferred solution to multiple univariate analyses; parameter significance changes may occur. Analytic metric appears to be a determinant.","Moran, John L.",BMC Med Res Methodol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8286437/,372
19728,Sputum Protein Biomarkers in Airway Diseases: A Pilot Study,2021-07-28,"PURPOSE: Home mechanical ventilation (HMV) use in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is becoming increasingly widespread. The aim of this study was to provide an accurate description of the current practices and clinical characteristics of COPD patients on HMV in Portugal. METHODS: The study was designed as a cross-sectional, multicenter real-life study of COPD patients established on HMV for at least 30 days. Data related to clinical characteristics, adaptation and ventilatory settings were collected. RESULTS: The study included 569 COPD patients on HMV from 15 centers. The majority were male, with a median age of 72 years and a high prevalence of obesity (43.2%) and sleep apnea (45.8%). A high treatment compliance was observed (median 8h/day), 48.7% with inspiratory positive airway pressure ≥20 cmH(2)O and oronasal masks were the preferred interface (91.7%). There was an equal distribution of patients starting HMV during chronic stable condition and following an exacerbation. Patients in stable condition were initiated in the outpatient setting in 92.3%. Despite the differences in criteria and setting of adaptation and a slightly lower BMI in patients starting HMV following an exacerbation, we found no significant differences regarding age, gender, ventilation pressures, time on HMV, usage, severity of airflow obstruction or current arterial blood gas analysis (ABGs) in relation to patients adapted in stable condition. CONCLUSION: Patients were highly compliant with the therapy. In agreement with most recent studies and recommendations, there seems to be a move towards higher ventilation pressures, increased use of oronasal masks and an intent to obtain normocapnia. This study shows that chronic hypercapnic and post exacerbation patients do not differ significantly regarding patient characteristics, physiological parameters or ventilatory settings with one exception: chronic hypercapnic patients are more often obese and, subsequently, more frequently present OSA.","Ribeiro, Carla; Vieira, Ana Luísa; Pamplona, Paula; Drummond, Marta; Seabra, Bárbara; Ferreira, Diva; Liberato, Hedi; Carreiro, Alexandra; Vicente, Inês; Castro, Luísa; Costa, Pedro; Carriço, Filipa; Martin, Teresa; Cravo, João; Teixeira, Nélson; Grafino, Mónica; Conde, Sara; Windisch, Wolfram; Nunes, Rui",Int J Chron Obstruct Pulmon Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8328383/,372

34850,ISMP issues safety warnings for drug shortage replacement products,2020-06-20,"BACKGROUND: Early warning scores (EWS) have been developed as clinical prognostication tools to identify acutely deteriorating patients. In the past few years, there has been a proliferation of studies that describe the development and validation of novel machine learning-based EWS. Systematic reviews of published studies which focus on evaluating performance of both well-established and novel EWS have shown conflicting conclusions. A possible reason is the heterogeneity in validation methods applied. In this review, we aim to examine the methodologies and metrics used in studies which perform EWS validation. METHODS: A systematic review of all eligible studies from the MEDLINE database and other sources, was performed. Studies were eligible if they performed validation on at least one EWS and reported associations between EWS scores and inpatient mortality, intensive care unit (ICU) transfers, or cardiac arrest (CA) of adults. Two reviewers independently did a full-text review and performed data abstraction by using standardized data-worksheet based on the TRIPOD (Transparent reporting of a multivariable prediction model for individual prognosis or diagnosis) checklist. Meta-analysis was not performed due to heterogeneity. RESULTS: The key differences in validation methodologies identified were (1) validation dataset used, (2) outcomes of interest, (3) case definition, time of EWS use and aggregation methods, and (4) handling of missing values. In terms of case definition, among the 48 eligible studies, 34 used the patient episode case definition while 12 used the observation set case definition, and 2 did the validation using both case definitions. Of those that used the patient episode case definition, 18 studies validated the EWS at a single point of time, mostly using the first recorded observation. The review also found more than 10 different performance metrics reported among the studies. CONCLUSIONS: Methodologies and performance metrics used in studies performing validation on EWS were heterogeneous hence making it difficult to interpret and compare EWS performance. Standardizing EWS validation methodology and reporting can potentially address this issue.","Fang, Andrew Hao Sen; Lim, Wan Tin; Balakrishnan, Tharmmambal",BMC Med Inform Decis Mak,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7301346/,372

We describe demographics, clinical features and outcomes of COVID-19 patients admitted to a public health hospital in a high population-density city with an early containment response. METHODS: We analyzed inpatients with COVID-19 admitted to San Francisco General Hospital (SFGH) from 3/5/2020–5/11/2020. SFGH serves a network of >63,000 patients (32% Latinx/24% Asian/19% African American/19% Caucasian). Demographic and clinical data through 5/18/2020 were abstracted from hospital records, along with ICU and ventilator utilization, lengths of stay, and in-hospital deaths. RESULTS: Of 157 admitted patients, 105/157 (67%) were male, median age was 49 (range 19-96y), and 127/157 (81%) of patients with COVID-19 were Latinx. Crowded living conditions were common: 60/157 (38%) lived in multi-family shared housing, 12/1578 (8%) with multigenerational families, and 8/157 (5%) were homeless living in shelters. Of 102 patients with ascertained occupations, most had frontline essential jobs: 23% food service, 14% construction/home maintenance, and 10% cleaning. Overall, 86/157 (55%) of patients lived in neighborhoods home to majority Latinx and African-American populations. Overall, 45/157 (29%) of patients needed ICU care, and 26/157 (17%) required mechanical ventilation; 20/26 (77%) of ventilated patients were successfully extubated, and 137/157 (87%) were discharged home. Median hospitalization duration was 4 days (IQR, 2–10), and only 6/157 (4%) patients died in hospital. CONCLUSION: In San Francisco, where early COVID-19 mitigation was enacted, we report a stark, disproportionate COVID-19 burden on Latinx patients, who accounted for 81% of hospitalizations despite making up only 32% of the patient base and 15% of San Francisco’s total population. Latinx inpatients frequently lived in high-density settings, increasing household risk, and frequently worked essential jobs, potentially limiting the opportunity to effectively distance from others. We also report here favorable clinical outcomes and low overall mortality. However, an effective COVID-19 response must urgently address racial and ethnic disparities.

Where in-person collaboration may not be possible, inclusion of online collaboration tools has become more prevalent. Previous studies have suggested that online collaboration is beneficial to overall learning outcomes; however, little research has investigated how differences in personality traits, such as extraversion and agreeableness, impact the benefits and effectiveness of collaborative learning, both through online (synchronous and asynchronous) and in-person platforms. In the present study, 360 (66.4% female) undergraduate students completed an online survey to assess perceptions of and beliefs about online synchronous, online asynchronous, and in-person collaboration in higher education with a focus on the impact of extraversion and agreeableness. Findings indicated that students had more experience and greater preference for online synchronous collaboration compared to online asynchronous collaboration; however, students believed that in-person collaboration was most effective. Both extraversion and agreeableness predicted positive beliefs about group work in both online and in-person settings but not uniformly. These findings support the use of online synchronous collaboration when in-person opportunities are limited; however, individual differences related to personality traits can differentially impact students’ perceptions toward and actions within collaboration contexts.","Borg, Meghan E.; Butterfield, Kaitlyn M.; Wood, Eileen; Zhang, Huan Huan; Pinto, Sabrina",SN Soc Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7847746/,372

56604,Cases of pancreatitis reported with tocilizumab,2021-08-07,"BACKGROUND: Since the beginning of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic, Germany never formulated an explicit strategy so far. Topics continuously become disconnected from their origin and the justification for the lockdown gets out of focus, i.e. the reduction of mortality in the vulnerable population and age-groups, and the risk of an increased case fatality when the healthcare system—primarily intensive care capacity—would become overwhelmed. METHODS: On the basis of knowledge which was already available before the current pandemic and knowledge which has been accumulated so far, refocusing and developing of an exit strategy for Germany is attempted. RESULTS: The central goal in pandemics is to overcome the primary infection of the population by wild type infection or vaccination as quickly as possible and to achieve the herd immunity threshold. Only in this way can the virus lose its dangerous potential and a new endemic equilibrium can be achieved. The Russian Flu Pandemic from 1889–1892 by CoV OC43, today a pandemic scar from that time, can function as a role model. The successful vaccine development in unprecedented speed is a grace of historic dimension. CONCLUSIONS: The Russian Flu Pandemic was the most recent and largest coronavirus pandemic. After offering vaccination to all vulnerable groups (target population), the lockdown has to be ended as soon as possible. Vaccinations should continue to be offered to adults without established risk factors and the remaining population should be primed by infection with the wild virus. In spite of the rapid, successful development of a vaccine, time to avoid further disruptions is running out.","Weigl, Josef",Pr&#x000e4;v Gesundheitsf,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8340590/,372

58326,CHMP meeting highlights September 2021: Vaxzevria-related TTS,2021-10-02,"The emergence of antibiotic resistance in bacteria is a major public-health issue. Synthesis of efficient antibiotic-free material is very important for fighting bacterial infection-related diseases. Herein, red-carbon dots (R-CDs) with a broad range of spectral absorption (350–700 nm) from organic bactericides or intermediates were synthesized through a solvothermal route. The prepared R-CDs not only had intrinsic antibacterial activities, but also could kill multidrug-resistant bacteria (multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (MRAB) and multidrug-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)) effectively by generating reactive oxygen species. Furthermore, R-CDs could eliminate and inhibit the formation of MRAB biofilms, while conferring few side effects on normal cells.

60103,Diagnosis and management of rare inferior vena cava leiomyosarcoma guided by a novel minimally invasive vascular biopsy technique.,2018,"BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES Certified nursing assistants (CNAs) who work in nursing homes (NHs) face significant work and personal stress. Self-compassion training has been shown to decrease stress postintervention in previous studies among healthcare providers and those in helping professions. This study examines the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary outcomes of self-compassion training to address CNA stress and well-being. DESIGN Pre-post intervention. SETTING Three mid-size, nonprofit NHs in North Carolina. PARTICIPANTS Thirty CNAs, with a mean age of 49, 96% of whom were female, and 83% black/African American. INTERVENTION In one NH, participants received an 8-week, 2.5-h/session (20 h total) group intervention. At the time of recruitment for NHs 2 and 3, a briefer format (6-week, 1-h/session; 6 h total) became available and was preferred by CNAs, thus both NHs 2 and 3 participants received a 6-h group intervention. All interventions occurred in meeting rooms within participating NHs during shift changes. MEASUREMENTS Intervention attendance, retention, and acceptability; self-compassion, stress, burnout, depression, and attitudes toward residents with dementia, and job satisfaction pre-, post-, 3-month post-, and 6-month postintervention were assessed. RESULTS Attendance and program satisfaction were high, and attrition was low for both training formats. Self-compassion was significantly improved at all time periods (p < 0.001), and stress and depression improved significantly through 3 months (p < 0.05), but not 6 months. No statistically significant change in job satisfaction was noted. CONCLUSION Self-compassion interventions are feasible and acceptable for CNAs working in NHs and show promise for managing stress and improving well-being and compassion toward residents. The briefer 6-h format may maximize participation, while still providing benefits.","Bluth, Karen; Lathren, Christine; Silbersack Hickey, Johanna V T; Zimmerman, Sheryl; Wretman, Christopher J; Sloane, Philip D",Journal of the American Geriatrics Society,https://doi.org/10.1111/jgs.17155; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33837539/,372
61615,Advancing Marksman into contralateral vertebral artery in the treatment of intradural vertebral artery dissecting aneurysm with Pipeline.,2017,"Rotaviruses are double-stranded RNA viruses which are among the most resistant waterborne enteric viruses to UV disinfection. An integrated cell culture and real-time RT-PCR (ICC real-time RT-PCR) assay was developed to detect the infectivity of rotaviruses in water, which uses real-time RT-PCR to detect RNA produced by infectious rotaviruses during replication in host cells. Detection of rotaviral RNA in host cells provides direct evidence of the presence of infectious rotavirus rather than just the presence of rotavirus RNA. Using this newly developed method, the inactivation and resistance of rotavirus to UV treatments at various doses was evaluated. With an initial concentration of 2 x 10(4)PFU/ml simian rotavirus (SA11), a first-order linear relationship was obtained at UV dose range of 0-120 mJ cm(-2), and the inactivation rate constant was estimated to be 0.0343 cm(2) mJ(-1) (R(2)=0.966). The dose-inactivation curve tailed off and reached plateau as the UV dose increased from 120 to 360 mJ cm(-2), indicating resistance phenomena of sub-populations of SA11 at very high UV doses. A maximal reduction of 4.8 log(10) was observed. Through parallel comparison with traditional culture assay, the ICC real-time RT-PCR method demonstrated more effective, sensitive and faster infectivity detection of rotavirus and, the results reveal that rotaviruses are more resistant to UV irradiation than previously reported with traditional cell culture assays.","Li, Dan; Gu, April Z; He, Miao; Shi, Han-Chang; Yang, Wan",Water research,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2009.03.044; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19501383/,372

Although no perfect methodologies currently exist for the high-throughput, unbiased isolation of pure plasma exosomes2,3, investigation of exosome-enriched plasma fractions of extracellular vesicles can confer a glimpse into the endocytic pathway on a systems level. Here we conduct high-coverage lipidomics with an emphasis on sterols and oxysterols, and proteomic analyses of exosome-enriched extracellular vesicles (EVs hereafter) from patients at different temporal stages of COVID-19, including the presymptomatic, hyperinflammatory, resolution and convalescent phases. Our study highlights dysregulated raft lipid metabolism that underlies changes in EV lipid membrane anisotropy that alter the exosomal localization of presenilin-1 (PS-1) in the hyperinflammatory phase. We also show in vitro that EVs from different temporal phases trigger distinct metabolic and transcriptional responses in recipient cells, including in alveolar epithelial cells, which denote the primary site of infection, and liver hepatocytes, which represent a distal secondary site. In comparison to the hyperinflammatory phase, EVs from the resolution phase induce opposing effects on eukaryotic translation and Notch signalling. Our results provide insights into cellular lipid metabolism and inter-tissue crosstalk at different stages of COVID-19 and are a resource to increase our understanding of metabolic dysregulation in COVID-19.","Lam, Sin Man; Zhang, Chao; Wang, Zehua; Ni, Zhen; Zhang, Shaohua; Yang, Siyuan; Huang, Xiahe; Mo, Lesong; Li, Jie; Lee, Bernett; Mei, Mei; Huang, Lei; Shi, Ming; Xu, Zhe; Meng, Fan-Ping; Cao, Wen-Jing; Zhou, Ming-Ju; Shi, Lei; Chua, Gek Huey; Li, Bowen; Cao, Jiabao; Wang, Jun; Bao, Shilai; Wang, Yingchun; Song, Jin-Wen; Zhang, Fujie; Wang, Fu-Sheng; Shui, Guanghou",Nature metabolism,https://doi.org/10.1038/s42255-021-00425-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34158670/,372

Physical distancing, travel restrictions, and emphasis on hygiene are likely to have affected the number of expected notifications, with the greatest reductions observed among disease spread via person-to-person contact such as influenza, and among overseas-acquired infections such as dengue virus and measles. However, quantifying the magnitude of the effect of COVID-19 public health measures on communicable diseases in Australia will be difficult, due to confounding factors such as: changes in testing priorities in laboratories; diversion of resources to the COVID-19 response; changes in health-seeking behaviours; greater utilisation of telehealth practices; and financial impacts such as income loss and ability to afford healthcare. It is considered likely that these other factors will have also impacted notification numbers.","Bright, Amy; Glynn-Robinson, Anna-Jane; Kane, Stacey; Wright, Rose; Saul, Nathan",Communicable diseases intelligence,https://doi.org/10.33321/cdi.2020.44.85; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33147428/,372

This article addresses the methodological issue of how we should theorize about justice in the genomic era. Invoking the methodology of non-ideal theory, I argue that theorizing about justice in the genomic era entails theorizing about (1) the new inequalities that the genetic revolution could exacerbate (e.g., genetic discrimination, disability-related injustices, and gender inequality), and (2) those inequalities that the genetic revolution could help us mitigate (e.g., the risks of disease in early and late life). By doing so, normative theorists can ensure that we develop an account of justice that takes seriously not only individual rights, equality of opportunity, the cultural and sociopolitical aspects of disability, and equality between the sexes, but also the potential health benefits (to both individuals and populations) of attending to the evolutionary causes of morbidity and disability.","Farrelly, Colin",Politics and the life sciences : the journal of the Association for Politics and the Life Sciences,https://doi.org/10.1017/pls.2021.3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33949837/,372

A new laparoscopic device is reported in this article that assists liver resection laparoscopically. METHODS From October 2006 to the present, patients suitable for liver resection were assessed carefully for laparoscopic resection with the laparoscopic Habib Sealer (LHS). Detailed data of patients resected laparoscopically with this device were collected prospectively and analyzed. RESULTS In all, 28 patients underwent attempted laparoscopic liver resection. Four cases had to be converted to an open approach because of extensive adhesions from previous colonic operations. Twenty-four patients completed the procedure comprising tumorectomy (n = 7), multiple tumoretcomies (n = 5), segmentectomy (n = 3), and bisegmentectomies (n = 9). Vascular clamping of portal triads was not used. The mean resection time was 60 +/- 23 min (mean +/- SD), and blood loss was 48 +/- 54 mL. None of the patients received any transfusion of blood or blood products perioperatively or postoperatively. Postoperatively, 1 patient developed severe exacerbation of asthma that required steroid therapy, and 1 other patient had a transient episode of liver failure that required supportive care. The mean duration of hospital stay was 5.6 +/- 2 days (mean +/- SD). At a short-term follow up, no recurrence was detected in patients with liver cancer. CONCLUSION Laparoscopic liver resection can be performed safely with this new laparoscopic liver resection device with a significantly low risk of intraoperative bleeding or postoperative complications.","Jiao, Long R; Ayav, Ahmet; Navarra, Giuseppe; Sommerville, Craig; Pai, Madhava; Damrah, Osama; Khorsandi, Shrin; Habib, Nagy A",Surgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.surg.2008.08.005; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19081019/,372

Alphavirus disease in humans can be severely debilitating, and depending on the particular viral species, infection may result in encephalitis and possibly death. In recent years, alphaviruses have received significant attention from public health authorities as a consequence of the dramatic emergence of chikungunya virus in the Indian Ocean islands and the Caribbean. Currently, no safe, approved or effective vaccine or antiviral intervention exists for human alphavirus infection. The molecular biology of alphavirus RNA synthesis has been well studied in a few species of the genus and represents a general target for antiviral drug development. This review describes what is currently understood about the regulation of alphavirus RNA synthesis, the roles of the viral non-structural proteins in this process and the functions of cis-acting RNA elements in replication, and points to open questions within the field.","Rupp, Jonathan C; Sokoloski, Kevin J; Gebhart, Natasha N; Hardy, Richard W",The Journal of general virology,https://doi.org/10.1099/jgv.0.000249; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26219641/,372

As part of a randomised controlled trial in rural Madhya Pradesh, India to assess the impact of Kilkari, a maternal messaging programme, we explored determinants of parental immunisation knowledge and immunisation practice (completeness and timeliness) for children 0-12 months of age from four districts in Madhya Pradesh. METHODS Data were drawn from a cross-sectional survey of women (n=4423) with access to a mobile phone and their spouses (n=3781). Parental knowledge about immunisation and their child's receipt of vaccines, including timeliness and completeness, was assessed using self-reports and vaccination cards. Ordered logistic regressions were used to analyse the factors associated with parental immunisation knowledge. A Heckman two-stage probit model was used to analyse completeness and timeliness of immunisation after correcting for selection bias from being able to produce the immunisation card. RESULTS One-third (33%) of women and men knew the timing for the start of vaccinations, diseases linked to immunisations and the benefits of Vitamin-A. Less than half of children had received the basic package of 8 vaccines (47%) and the comprehensive package of 19 vaccines (44%). Wealth was the most significant determinant of men's knowledge and of the child receiving complete and timely immunisation for both basic and comprehensive packages. Exposure to Kilkari content on immunisation was significantly associated with an increase in men's knowledge (but not women's) about child immunisation (OR: 1.23, 95% CI 1.02 to1.48) and an increase in the timeliness of the child receiving vaccination at birth (Probit coefficient: 0.08, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.24). CONCLUSION Gaps in complete and timely immunisation for infants persist in rural India. Mobile messaging programmes, supported by mass media messages, may provide one important source for bolstering awareness, uptake and timeliness of immunisation services.

75569,Analysis of biomarkers for risk of acute kidney injury after primary angioplasty for acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction: results of the HORIZONS-AMI trial.,2015,"OBJECTIVES This split-mouth study assessed the bleaching sensitivity (risk and intensity) and color change after in-office bleaching using a desensitizing-containing (5% potassium nitrate) and a desensitizing-free 35% hydrogen peroxide gel. The null hypothesis was that there would be no differences between study groups regarding bleaching sensitivity. METHOD AND MATERIALS Sixty patients participated in this split-mouth study. The subjects received desensitizing-containing hydrogen peroxide in half of the maxillary arch, and the other half received a desensitizing-free hydrogen peroxide, defined by random sequence, in two dental bleaching sessions. The bleaching sensitivity was evaluated during bleaching and from 1 h to 48 h after each bleaching session using a visual analog scale and numeric rating scale; the McNemar test, the Wilcoxon signed-rank test, and the Student-Newman-Keuls test were used for statistical analysis. The color was measured at baseline and 30 days post-bleaching, evaluated with paired t tests (P = .05). RESULTS Statistically similar risks of bleaching sensitivity were observed (P = 1.000), but the intensity of bleaching sensitivity was lower (P < .011) on average by 1.32 visual analog scale units in the group bleached with the desensitizer-containing gel during up to 24 h assessment times. No statistical difference in color change was observed between groups (P > .321). CONCLUSION The incorporation of 5% potassium nitrate into in-office bleaching gels does not reduce the risk of bleaching sensitivity, but it reduces its intensity slightly without jeopardizing color change.","Maran, Bianca Medeiros; Vochikovski, Laína; Hortkoff, Diego Rafael de Andrade; Stanislawczuk, Rodrigo; Loguercio, Alessandro D; Reis, Alessandra",Quintessence international,https://doi.org/10.3290/j.qi.a45173; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32901243/,372

82255,Treatment of an internal carotid artery aneurysm with a flow diverter through a double lumen balloon catheter.,2017,"The incidence of tick-borne diseases has increased in recent decades and accounts for the majority of vector-borne disease cases in temperate areas of Europe, North America, and Asia. This emergence has been attributed to multiple and interactive drivers including changes in climate, land use, abundance of key hosts, and people's behaviors affecting the probability of human exposure to infected ticks. In this forum paper, we focus on how land use changes have shaped the eco-epidemiology of Ixodes scapularis-borne pathogens, in particular the Lyme disease spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto in the eastern United States. We use this as a model system, addressing other tick-borne disease systems as needed to illustrate patterns or processes. We first examine how land use interacts with abiotic conditions (microclimate) and biotic factors (e.g., host community composition) to influence the enzootic hazard, measured as the density of host-seeking I. scapularis nymphs infected with B. burgdorferi s.s. We then review the evidence of how specific landscape configuration, in particular forest fragmentation, influences the enzootic hazard and disease risk across spatial scales and urbanization levels. We emphasize the need for a dynamic understanding of landscapes based on tick and pathogen host movement and habitat use in relation to human resource provisioning. We propose a coupled natural-human systems framework for tick-borne diseases that accounts for the multiple interactions, nonlinearities and feedbacks in the system and conclude with a call for standardization of methodology and terminology to help integrate studies conducted at multiple scales.","Diuk-Wasser, Maria A; VanAcker, Meredith C; Fernandez, Maria P",Journal of medical entomology,https://doi.org/10.1093/jme/tjaa209; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33095859/,372

Serum AMH levels were measured preoperatively (AMH0), and 7 days (AMH1), 2 months (AMH2), and 6 months (AMH3) after LH and LM in 79 premenopausal women (LH = 59; LM = 20). AMH0, AMH1, AMH2, and AMH3 were significantly higher in the LM group than in the LH group (p = 0.012, 0.001, 0.001, and 0.015, respectively). Since there are differences in indications between myomectomy and hysterectomy, logically, women who underwent myomectomy were younger and had higher AMH baseline levels. In addition, AMH changes at 7 days postoperatively from the baseline level were significantly decreased in the LH group compared to those in the LM group (p = 0.042). However, AMH changes at 2 months and 6 months postoperatively, compared to the baseline level, were not different between the two groups (p = 0.053 and 0.752, respectively). Moreover, the significant decrease in AMH (more than 60% decrease from the baseline level) was not different at 7 days, 2 months, and 6 months postoperatively between the two groups (p = 0.415, 487, and 0.364, respectively). Our data suggest that serum AMH levels were significantly decreased directly after LH, which suggests that LH may have adverse effects on ovarian reserve. However, mid-term follow-up showed that the damaged ovarian reserve in women who underwent LH may be partially restored in 6 months.","Cho, Hye-Yon; Kyung, Min Sun",Journal of clinical medicine,https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm10143077; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34300243/,372
82820,Spontaneous thrombosis of the main draining vein revealing an unruptured brain arteriovenous malformation.,2015,"Vaccines for 17 viral pathogens have been licensed for use in humans. Previously, two critical biological parameters of the pathogen and the host-pathogen interaction-incubation period and broadly protective, relative immunogenicity-were proposed to account for much of the past successes in vaccine development, and to be useful in estimating the ""certainty of success"" of developing an effective vaccine for viral pathogens for which a vaccine currently does not exist. In considering the ""certainty of success"" in development of human coronavirus vaccines, particularly SARS-CoV-2, a third, related critical parameter is proposed-infectious inoculum intensity, at an individual-level, and force of infection, at a population-level. Reducing the infectious inoculum intensity (and force of infection, at a population-level) is predicted to lengthen the incubation period, which in turn is predicted to reduce the severity of illness, and increase the opportunity for an anamnestic response upon exposure to the circulating virus. Similarly, successfully implementing individual- and population-based behaviors that reduce the infectious inoculum intensity and force of infection, respectively, while testing and deploying COVID-19 vaccines is predicted to increase the ""certainty of success"" of demonstrating vaccine efficacy and controlling SARS-CoV-2 infection, disease, death, and the pandemic itself.","Kaslow, David C",NPJ vaccines,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41541-020-0193-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32509338/,372

Yet, TTS and TTS-associated cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) remain poorly characterized. We aim to systematically evaluate the proportion of CVST among TTS cases and assess its characteristics and outcomes. METHODS We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of clinical trials, cohorts, case series and registry-based studies with the aim to assess (1) the pooled mortality rate of CVST, TTS-associated CVST, and TTS and (2) the pooled proportion of patients with CVST among patients with any thrombotic event and TTS. Secondary outcomes comprised clinical characteristics of patients with post-vaccination thrombotic event. This meta-analysis is reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines and was written according to the Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology proposal. RESULTS Sixty-nine studies were included in the qualitative analysis comprising 370 patients with CVST out of 4182 patients with any thrombotic event associated with SARS-CoV-2 vector-based vaccine administration. Twenty-three studies were further included in quantitative meta-analysis. Among TTS cases, the pooled proportion of CVST was 51% (95%CI:36-66%; I2=61%). TTS was independently associated with a higher likelihood of CVST, when compared to non-TTS patients with thrombotic events after vaccination (OR:13.8; 95%CI:2.0-97.3; I2=78%). The pooled mortality rates of TTS and TTS-associated CVST were 28% (95%CI:21-36%) and 38% (95%CI:27-49%), respectively. Thrombotic complications developed within 2 weeks of exposure to vector-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccines (mean interval:10 days; 95%CI:8-12) and affected predominantly women (69%, 95%CI:60-77%), under the age of 45, even in the absence of pro-thrombotic risk factors. DISCUSSION Approximately one half of TTS cases present with CVST, while almost one third of TTS patients do not survive.

The purpose of this review is to provide pediatricians with explanations of specific trends on streaming services, the popular new mobile application TikTok, recent widespread 'Internet Challenges' that include pediatric participants, and new technologies. These emerging trends can pose potential harms to the health and wellbeing of children and adolescents. RECENT FINDINGS Recent reports and news articles have discussed popular technological trends and the adverse effects that can occur. Although technology provides access to information and social connection for youth, it also creates platforms where children can be exposed to disturbing content, peer pressure, cyberbullying, and encouragement to participate in activities that could cause potential physical harm or even death. SUMMARY Pediatricians need to be aware of trends to best understand the implications of these technologies, especially in clinical practice. Pediatricians play an important role in educating parents and patients about the risks of these trends, in facilitating conversations about related topics including self-esteem, cyberbullying and peer pressure to promote healthy internet use, and providing necessary resources.","Kriegel, Elana R; Lazarevic, Bojan; Athanasian, Christian E; Milanaik, Ruth L",Current opinion in pediatrics,https://doi.org/10.1097/mop.0000000000000989; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33337608/,372
86523,Resistant in-stent restenosis in the drug eluting stent era.,2016,"INTRODUCTION In recent years, computational polypharmacology has gained significant attention to study the promiscuous nature of drugs. Despite tremendous challenges, community-wide efforts have led to a variety of novel approaches for predicting drug polypharmacology. In particular, some rapid advances using machine learning and artificial intelligence have been reported with great success. AREAS COVERED In this article, the authors provide a comprehensive update on the current state-of-the-art polypharmacology approaches and their applications, focusing on those reports published after our 2017 review article. The authors particularly discuss some novel, groundbreaking concepts, and methods that have been developed recently and applied to drug polypharmacology studies. EXPERT OPINION Polypharmacology is evolving and novel concepts are being introduced to counter the current challenges in the field. However, major hurdles remain including incompleteness of high-quality experimental data, lack of in vitro and in vivo assays to characterize multi-targeting agents, shortage of robust computational methods, and challenges to identify the best target combinations and design effective multi-targeting agents. Fortunately, numerous national/international efforts including multi-omics and artificial intelligence initiatives as well as most recent collaborations on addressing the COVID-19 pandemic have shown significant promise to propel the field of polypharmacology forward.","Chaudhari, Rajan; Fong, Long Wolf; Tan, Zhi; Huang, Beibei; Zhang, Shuxing",Expert opinion on drug discovery,https://doi.org/10.1080/17460441.2020.1767063; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32452701/,372

Emerging findings point to existing disparities in health systems and services being further exacerbated, with marginalized populations and low- and middle-income countries burdened disproportionately. More broadly, there is a need to further understand short- and long-term impacts of bypassed essential services, quality assurance of services, the role of primary health care in the frontline, and the need for additional mechanisms for effective vaccine messaging and uptake during epidemics. The review also highlights how trust-of institutions, of science, and between communities and health systems-remains central to a successful pandemic response. Finally, previous crises had repeatedly foreshadowed the inability of health systems to handle upcoming pandemics, yet the reactive nature of policies and practices compounded by lack of resources, infrastructure, and political will have resulted in the current failed response to COVID-19. There is therefore an urgent need for investments in implementation science and for strategies to bridge this persistent research-practice gap.","Baral, Prativa","International journal of health services : planning, administration, evaluation",https://doi.org/10.1177/0020731421997088; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33827309/,372

96298,Entry remnants in flow-diverted aneurysms: Does branch geometry influence aneurysm closure?,2018,"BACKGROUND Simulated surgical training offers a safe and accessible way of learning surgical procedures outside the operating room. Training programs have been developed using simulated laboratories to train surgical trainees to proficiency outside the operating room. Despite the global enthusiasm among educators to enhance training through simulation-based learning, it remains to be elucidated whether the skill set obtained is transferrable to the operating room. METHODS Using standardized search methods, the authors searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PubMed, Embase, and Web-Based Knowledge, as well as the reference lists of relevant articles, and retrieved all published randomized controlled trials. RESULTS Sixteen randomized controlled trials involving 309 participants were identified to be suitable for qualitative analysis using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. The mean Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials score was 16 (range, 12-22). The studies showed considerable clinical and methodologic diversity. Operative time improved consistently in all trials after training and was the only objective parameter measurable in the live setting. Studies that used the Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skills as their primary outcome showed improved scores in 80% of trials, and studies that used performance indicators to assess participants all showed improved scores after simulation training in all of the trials, with 88% showing statistical significance. CONCLUSIONS The current literature consistently demonstrates the positive impact of simulation on operative time and predefined performance scores. However, these reproducible measures alone are insufficient to demonstrate transferability of skills from the laboratory to the operating room. The authors advocate a multimodal assessment, including metrics, the Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skills, and critical step completion. This may provide a more complete assessment of operative performance. Only then can it be concluded that simulation skills are transferable to the live operative setting.","Buckley, Christina E; Kavanagh, Dara O; Traynor, Oscar; Neary, Paul C",American journal of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amjsurg.2013.06.017; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24238602/,372
97954,Aggressive change of a carotid-cavernous fistula in a patient with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type IV.,2015,"INTRODUCTION The authors compared the oncologic outcomes of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) with robotic-assisted partial nephrectomy (RPN) for the treatment of T1 stage renal cell carcinoma (RCC). MATERIALS AND METHODS This was a retrospective data analysis of a high-volume single tertiary centre. Patients were treated with RFA or RPN following multidisciplinary decision making. Only histologically proven RCCs were included. Baseline demographics were collected, and PADUA scores of tumour features were calculated to standardize baseline anatomy. Peri-operative complications, kidney function and oncological outcomes were compared. RESULTS Sixty-three cases were included in each group. Baseline renal function was poorer in RFA, and 16/63 RFA patients had tumours in single kidneys compared to 1/63 RPN cases (p < 0.001). Length of stay was shorter in RFA (1 vs. 3 days, p < 0.0001). Post-procedure renal function decline at 30 days was significantly less in RFA [(-0.8) ± 9.6 vs. (-16.1) ± 19.5 mls/min/1.73 m2; p < 0.0001]. More minor complications were recorded in RPN (10/63 vs. 4/63, p = 0.15), but local recurrence was numerically higher in RFA (6/63 vs. 1/63, p = 0.11). Disease-free survival (DFS) was not significantly different (adjusted HR = 0.6, 95 % Cl 0.1-3.7; p = 0.60). Increasing tumour size was an independent predictor of local recurrence (adjusted HR = 1.7; 95 % Cl 1.1-2.6 per cm; p = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS Both RPN and RFA offer very good oncological outcomes for the treatment of T1 RCC with low peri-operative morbidity and similar oncologic outcomes. RFA demonstrated fewer peri-operative complications and better preservation of renal function, whereas RPN had an insignificantly lower local recurrence rate. RFA should be offered alongside RPN for selected cases.","Pantelidou, Maria; Challacombe, Ben; McGrath, Andrew; Brown, Matthew; Ilyas, Shahzad; Katsanos, Konstantinos; Adam, Andreas",Cardiovascular and interventional radiology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00270-016-1417-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27435582/,372

The Kynurenine metabolites are identified as essential cofactors, antagonists, neurotoxins, immunomodulators, antioxidants as well as carcinogens. The catalytic active site of IDO1 enzyme consists of hydrophobic Pocket-A positioned in the distal heme site and remains connected to a second hydrophobic Pocket-B towards the entrance of the active site. IDO1 enzyme also relates directly to the modulation of the innate and adaptive immune system. Various studies proved that the over expression of IDO1 enzyme play a predominant role in the escape of immunity during cancer progression. Recently, there has been considerable interest in evaluating the potential of IDO1 inhibitors to mobilize the body's immune system against solid tumours. In the last two decades, enormous attempts to advance new IDO1 inhibitors are on-going both in pharmaceutical industries and in academia which resulted in the discovery of a diverse range of selective and potent IDO1 inhibitors. The IDO1 inhibitors have therapeutic utility in various diseases and in the near future, it may have utility in the treatment of COVID-19. Despite various reviews on IDO1 inhibitors in last five years, none of the reviews provide a complete overview of diverse chemical space including naturally occurring and synthetic IDO1 inhibitors with detailed structure activity relationship studies.

The investigation employed intratracheally, and intraperitoneally and intratracheally applied LPS three-hit regimen, compared with bleomycin-induced chronic pulmonary fibrosis. Inflammatory damage and fibrosis were evaluated, and the molecular mechanism was analyzed according to Th1/Th2 balance, Sma- and MAD-related proteins (Smads) and signal transducer and activator of transcriptions (STATs) expression. The results suggested that rapid pulmonary fibrosis could be induced by ALI via LPS three-hits. The period from 3-7 days in the LPS group was the first rapid pulmonary fibrosis stage, whereas the second fast fibrosis stage occurred on days 14-21. Th2 cell polarization, Smad4 and Smad7 should be the crucial molecular mechanism of ALI-induced rapid fibrosis. The investigation was not only performed to establish a new rapid pulmonary fibrosis model, but also to provide the elicitation for mechanism of ALI changed into the rapid pulmonary fibrosis.","Li, Hui; Du, Shaohui; Yang, Lina; Chen, Yangyan; Huang, Wei; Zhang, Rong; Cui, Yinghai; Yang, Jun; Chen, Dongfeng; Li, Yiwei; Zhang, Saixia; Zhou, Jianhong; Wei, Zhijun; Yao, Zhibin",Innate immunity,https://doi.org/10.1177/1753425908101509; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19474208/,372

Over a short span of time, the structures of therapeutic target proteins for SARS-CoV-2 were identified based on the homology modelled structure of similar virus, SARS-CoV that transmitted rapidly in 2003. Since the outset of the disease, the research community has been looking for a potential drug lead. Out of all the known resolved structures related to SARS-CoV-2; 3-chymotrypsin (3 C) like protease (3CLpro) is considered as an attractive anti-viral drug compound on the grounds of its role in viral replication and probable non-interactive competency to bind to any viral host protein. To the best of our knowledge, till date only one compound has been identified and tested in-vitro as a potent inhibitor of 3CLpro protein, addressed as N3 (PubChem Compound CID: 6323191) and is known to bind irreversibly to 3CLpro suppressing its activity. Using computational approach, we intend to identify a probable natural fungal metabolite to interact and inhibit 3CLpro. Here after performing docking and molecular dynamics of various small molecules derived as a secondary metabolite from fungi, we propose Flaviolin as potent inhibitor of 3CLpro of novel Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.

Up to 90% of individuals with dementia experience neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS). However, the limitations of current treatments for NPS have drivent he search for safer pharmacotherapies-including cannabinoids. AIM To assess the efficacy and acceptability of cannabinoids for the treatment of NPS in individuals with dementia. DESIGN Systematic review and meta-analysis of clinical trials. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS Of 6,902 papers, 9 were eligible (n = 205, 44% female, 78 ± 7 years, 85% Alzheimer disease). Trials were in North America and Europe and explored tetrahydrocannabinol (n = 3), dronabinol (n = 5), or nabilone (n = 1). MEASUREMENT Titles/abstracts were independently screened by one reviewer and reviewed by a second. Full-text screening was by two reviewers with discrepancies resolved via a third reviewer. We extracted data on the standardized mean difference (SMD) for several NPS instruments, trial completion, and adverse events. Data were pooled using random-effects models. FINDINGS Cannabinoids led to significant improvements across NPS instruments, including the Cohen Mansfield Agitation Inventory (SMD = -0.80; 95% confidence interval [CI], -1.45 to -0.16), the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (SMD = -0.61; CI, -1.07 to -0.15), and nocturnal actigraphy (SMD = -1.05; CI, -1.56 to -0.54h). Cannabinoids were well-tolerated, with an overall trial completion rate of 93% (193/205) and no serious treatment-related adverse events. Treatment efficacy was associated with baseline dementia severity and dose, but not dementia subtype, age, or sex. The overall study quality was rated as low. CONCLUSIONS There is preliminary evidence for the efficacy and tolerability of cannabinoids as treatments for NPS.

This study aimed to evaluate the relationship between the performance measurement of mean arterial pressure during cardiac surgery using cardiopulmonary bypass and postoperative mortality. A retrospective cohort study of patients who underwent cardiac surgery requiring cardiopulmonary bypass between 2013 and 2016 was conducted. The median performance error (MDPE) and median absolute performance error (MDAPE) were calculated using the preoperative mean arterial pressure as a reference, and intraoperative mean arterial pressures as measured values. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed using performance measurement variables to predict 30-day mortality. Overall survival according to performance measurement variables was evaluated using Cox proportional hazard models and Kaplan-Meier survival curves were generated to compare survival probability. Among 1203 patients, 110 (9.1%) died after surgery, and the 30-day mortality rate was 2.3% (28/1203). After adjusting for confounders, MDPE and MDAPE were significant mean arterial pressure derived predictors of 30-day mortality and overall survival. Intraoperative hypotension measured by performance measurement variables was independently associated with 30-day and overall mortality after cardiac surgery requiring cardiopulmonary bypass. Kaplan-Meier survival curves showed lower survival probability in patients with higher MDAPE during the pre- and post- cardiopulmonary bypass periods (P < 0.001 by log-rank test). Intraoperative hypotension measured by performance measurement variables was independently associated with 30-day and overall mortality after cardiac surgery requiring CPB. We propose that performance measurement variables are useful for quantifying the degree of intraoperative hypotension and predicting survival following cardiac surgery.Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov, identifier: NCT03785132.","Yoon, Susie; Park, Jung-Bin; Lee, Jaehun; Lee, Hyung-Chul; Bahk, Jae-Hyon; Cho, Youn Joung",Journal of clinical monitoring and computing,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10877-020-00631-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33389355/,372

METHODS PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane databases were searched for reports of musculoskeletal immune-related adverse events secondary to ICI treatment. Publications were included if they provided individual patient level data regarding the pattern of joint involvement. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize results. RESULTS A total of 4339 articles were screened, of which 67 were included, encompassing 372 patients. The majority of patients had metastatic melanoma (57%), and they were treated with anti-PD1 or anti-PDL1 therapy (78%). Median time to onset of arthritis was 4 months (range, 1 day to 53 months). Forty-nine percent had polyarthritis, 17% oligoarthritis, 3% monoarthritis, 10% arthralgia, and 21% polymyalgia rheumatica. More than half of patients were described as having a ""rheumatoid arthritis-like"" presentation. Nine percent tested positive for rheumatoid factor or anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies. Seventy-four percent required corticosteroids, and 45% required additional medications. Sixty-three percent achieved arthritis control, and 32% were ultimately able to discontinue antirheumatic treatments. Immune checkpoint inhibitors were continued in 49%, transiently withheld in 11%, and permanently discontinued due to musculoskeletal immune-related adverse events in 13%. CONCLUSIONS Half of reported immune checkpoint inhibitor-associated arthritis cases present with polyarthritis (often RA-like), but only 9% are seropositive. Polymyalgia rheumatica is also common.

109270,Manual aspiration thrombectomy using a Penumbra catheter in patients with acute migrated MCA occlusion.,2017,"AIM A moderate acute-phase response occurs 24-h following full-mouth non-surgical treatment (FM-SRP). The aim of this study was to compare acute-phase (24-h) and medium-term (3 months) inflammation after quadrant scaling (Q-SRP) versus FM-SRP. MATERIAL & METHODS Thirty-eight periodontitis-affected subjects were randomly allocated to FM-SRP or Q-SRP after a baseline visit. Periodontal and anthropometric parameters were collected at baseline and 3 months. Serum samples were drawn at baseline, 1, 7, and 90 days after treatment. High-sensitivity assays of inflammation and endothelial assays were performed. RESULTS FM-SRP produced a greater acute-phase response after 24 h [threefold increase in C-reactive protein (CRP), twofold increase in interleukin (IL-6), and a slight increase in tumour necrosis factor]. No differences in systemic biomarkers were noted between groups at any later follow-ups. Both periodontal treatments produced a comparable improvement in clinical periodontal parameters with no between-group differences. Treatment time was positively associated with the relative 24-h increase in CRP (R = 0.5, p < 0.001) and IL-6 (R = 0.5, p = 0.002), while the number of deeper (>6 mm) pockets predicted only the relative increase in IL-6 (R = 0.4, p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS FM-SRP triggers a moderate acute-phase response of 24 h duration compared to Q-SRP. Further research is needed to assess the eventual impact of such findings on the risk of vascular events is advocated.

114924,Mid-term outcomes following endovascular re-intervention for iliac artery in-stent restenosis.,2013,"BACKGROUND Injuries to the articular cartilage in the knee are common in jumping athletes, particularly high-level basketball players. Unfortunately, these are often diagnosed at a late stage of the disease process, after tissue loss has already occurred. PURPOSE/HYPOTHESIS To evaluate longitudinal changes in knee articular cartilage and knee function in National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) basketball players and their evolution over the competitive season and off-season. STUDY TYPE Longitudinal, multisite cohort study. POPULATION Thirty-two NCAA Division 1 athletes: 22 basketball players and 10 swimmers. FIELD STRENGTH/SEQUENCE Bilateral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) using a combined T1ρ and T2 magnetization-prepared angle-modulated portioned k-space spoiled gradient-echo snapshots (MAPSS) sequence at 3T. ASSESSMENT We calculated T2 and T1ρ relaxation times to compare compositional cartilage changes between three timepoints: preseason 1, postseason 1, and preseason 2. Knee Osteoarthritis Outcome Scores (KOOS) were used to assess knee health. STATISTICAL TESTS One-way variance model hypothesis test, general linear model, and chi-squared test. RESULTS In the femoral articular cartilage of all athletes, we saw a global decrease in T2 and T1ρ relaxation times during the competitive season (all P < 0.05) and an increase in T2 and T1ρ relaxation times during the off-season (all P < 0.05). In the basketball players' femoral cartilage, the anterior and central compartments respectively had the highest T2 and T1ρ relaxation times following the competitive season and off-season. The basketball players had significantly lower KOOS measures in every domain compared with the swimmers: Pain (P < 0.05), Symptoms (P < 0.05), Function in Daily Living (P < 0.05), Function in Sport/Recreation (P < 0.05), and Quality of Life (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION Our results indicate that T2 and T1ρ MRI can detect significant seasonal changes in the articular cartilage of basketball players and that there are regional differences in the articular cartilage that are indicative of basketball-specific stress on the femoral cartilage. This study demonstrates the potential of quantitative MRI to monitor global and regional cartilage health in athletes at risk of developing cartilage problems.

In developed countries they are predominantly the result of pelvic surgery or radiation therapy, whilst obstetric VVF are common in developing countries due to prolonged and complicated births. The majority of VVF require surgical therapy, thus a comprehensive diagnostic workup is needed. Depending on diagnostic characteristics fistula repair can be performed by a transvaginal, transabdominal or minimally invasive approach. Timing of surgery, appropriate interposition of vascularized grafts, optimized postoperative management and surgical expertise are determining factors for successful treatment.

117507,Impact of crossing technique on the incidence of periprocedural myocardial infarction during chronic total occlusion percutaneous coronary intervention.,2016,"INTRODUCTION COVID-19 has severely disrupted health professions training globally. This pandemic has been preceded by several other interferences on a smaller scale, setting the scene for crises in perpetuity. With a reactive stance adopted, these crises may result in rapid shifts to curricula, minimizing the opportunity for thorough planning and critical analyses. GUIDANCE FROM THE LITERATURE Recognizing the limited frameworks available to provide structure to such curricular crises responses, we drew on the literature to develop a crisis-curriculum analysis framework. The work of the SPICES model by Harden et al., the four-dimensional framework by Steketee et al., and Deverell's crisis-induced learning, was used to develop the framework. CRISIS-CURRICULUM ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK The framework provides a structured approach to curriculum analysis in the face of disruption. It is designed to meet the needs of the global health professions education community, currently in the midst of a crisis. Accompanied by a step-wise guideline, this framework is suitable for educators requiring a practically-orientated approach to curriculum analysis. CONCLUSION Recognizing that curriculum analysis is but one part of crisis-management, we argue that this crisis-curriculum analysis framework may align well with strengthening institutional readiness as educators seek to refine and entrench curricular practices adopted during COVID-19.","Govender, Lynelle; de Villiers, Marietjie R",Medical teacher,https://doi.org/10.1080/0142159x.2021.1887839; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33617408/,372

We report bench-scale experiments evaluating the extent and mechanisms of removal and/or inactivation of a coronavirus surrogate (ϕ6 bacteriophage) in water by conventional FeCl3 coagulation and Fe(0) electrocoagulation. Both coagulation methods achieved ∼5-log removal/inactivation of ϕ6 in 20 min. Enhanced removal was attributed to the high hydrophobicity of ϕ6 imparted by its characteristic phospholipid envelope. ϕ6 adhesion to freshly precipitated iron (hydr)oxide also led to envelope damage causing inactivation in both coagulation techniques. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy revealed oxidative damages to ϕ6 lipids only for electrocoagulation consistent with electro-Fenton reactions. Monitoring ϕ6 dsRNA by a novel reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) method quantified significantly lower viral removal/inactivation in water compared with the plaque assay demonstrating that relying solely on RT-qPCR assays may overstate human health risks arising from viruses. Transmission electron microscopy and computationally generated electron density maps of ϕ6 showed severe morphological damages to virus' envelope and loss of capsid volume accompanying coagulation. Both conventional and electro- coagulation appear to be highly effective in controlling enveloped viruses during surface water treatment.","Kim, Kyungho; Jothikumar, Narayanan; Sen, Anindito; Murphy, Jennifer L; Chellam, Shankararaman",Environmental science & technology,https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.0c07697; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33533250/,372
123069,Cardiac tamponade as a complication of laparoscopic hiatal hernia repair: case report and literature review.,2011,"PURPOSE Dual-energy CT imaging tends to suffer from much lower signal-to-noise ratio than single-energy CT. In this paper, we propose an improved anticorrelated noise reduction (ACNR) method without causing cross-contamination artifacts. METHODS The proposed algorithm diffuses both basis material density images (e.g., water and iodine) at the same time using a novel correlated diffusion algorithm. The algorithm has been compared to the original ACNR algorithm in a contrast-enhanced, IRB-approved patient study. Material density accuracy and noise reduction are quantitatively evaluated by the percent density error and the percent noise reduction. RESULTS Both algorithms have significantly reduced the noises of basis material density images in all cases. The average percent noise reduction is 69.3% and 66.5% with the ACNR algorithm and the proposed algorithm, respectively. However, the ACNR algorithm alters the original material density by an average of 13% (or 2.18 mg/cc) with a maximum of 58.7% (or 8.97 mg/cc) in this study. This is evident in the water density images as massive cross-contaminations are seen in all five clinical cases. On the contrary, the proposed algorithm only changes the mean density by 2.4% (or 0.69 mg/cc) with a maximum of 7.6% (or 1.31 mg/cc). The cross-contamination artifacts are significantly minimized or absent with the proposed algorithm. CONCLUSION The proposed algorithm can significantly reduce image noise present in basis material density images from dual-energy CT imaging, with minimized cross-contaminations compared to the ACNR algorithm.","Li, Baojun; Li, Baohong; Luo, Jack; Tang, Peng; Mao, Jiandong; Wu, Xiaoye",BioMed research international,https://doi.org/10.1155/2013/417278; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23862145/,372

Catheter-based renal denervation (RDN) was recently developed for the treatment of resistant HTN. AIM To assess the safety and efficacy of RDN for blood pressure (BP) reduction at six months in patients with resistant HTN. METHODS In this prospective registry of patients with essential resistant HTN who underwent RDN between July 2011 and May 2013, the efficacy of RDN was defined as ≥ 10 mm Hg reduction in office systolic blood pressure (SBP) six months after the intervention. RESULTS In a resistant HTN outpatient clinic, 177 consecutive patients were evaluated, of whom 34 underwent RDN (age 62.7 ± 7.6 years; 50.0% male). There were no vascular complications, either at the access site or in the renal arteries. Of the 22 patients with complete six-month follow-up, the response rate was 81.8% (n=18). The mean office SBP reduction was 22 mm Hg (174 ± 23 vs. 152 ± 22 mm Hg; p<0.001) and 9 mm Hg in diastolic BP (89 ± 16 vs. 80 ± 11 mm Hg; p=0.006). The number of antihypertensive drugs (5.5 ± 1.0 vs. 4.6 ± 1.1; p=0.010) and pharmacological classes (5.4 ± 0.7 vs. 4.6 ± 1.1; p=0.009) also decreased significantly. Of the 24-hour ambulatory BP monitoring and echocardiographic parameters analyzed, there were significant reductions in diastolic load (45 ± 29 vs. 27 ± 26%; p=0.049) and in left ventricular mass index (174 ± 56 vs. 158 ± 60 g/m(2); p=0.014).

136239,Evaluation of a novel mesh-covered stent for treatment of carotid stenosis in patients at high risk for endarterectomy: 1-year results of the SCAFFOLD trial.,2019-11-11,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE We performed a meta-analysis to assess whether leukoaraiosis on brain computed tomographic scans of acute ischemic stroke patients treated with intravenous thrombolysis is associated with an increased risk of symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage (sICH) or poor functional outcome at 3 to 6 months after stroke, or both. METHODS We searched PubMed and pooled relevant data in meta-analyses using random effects models. Using odds ratios (OR), we quantified the strength of association between the presence and severity of leukoaraiosis and post-thrombolysis sICH or 3- to 6-month modified Rankin Score >2. RESULTS Eleven eligible studies (n=7194) were pooled in meta-analysis. The risk of sICH was higher in patients with leukoaraiosis (OR, 1.55; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.17-2.06; P=0.002) and severe leukoaraiosis (OR, 2.53; 95% CI, 1.92-3.34; P<0.0001) compared with patients without leukoaraiosis. Leukoaraiosis was an independent predictor of sICH in 6 included studies (n=4976; adjusted OR, 1.75; 95% CI, 1.35-2.27; P<0.0001). OR for leukoaraiosis and poor 3- to 6-month outcome was 2.02 (95% CI, 1.54-2.65; P<0.0001), with significant statistical heterogeneity (I(2), 75.7%; P=0.002). In adjusted analyses, leukoaraiosis was an independent predictor of poor outcome (n=3688; adjusted OR, 1.61; 95% CI, 1.44-1.79; P<0.0001). In post hoc analyses, including only leukoaraiosis patients in randomized controlled trials (IST-3 [third International Stroke Trial], NINDS [National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke], ECASS-1-2 [European Cooperative Acute Stroke Study]; n=2234), tissue-type plasminogen activator versus control was associated with higher sICH risk (OR, 5.50; 95% CI, 2.49-12.13), but lower poor outcome risk (OR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.60-0.95). CONCLUSIONS Leukoaraiosis might increase post-intravenous thrombolysis sICH risk and poor outcome poststroke. Despite increased sICH risk, intravenous tissue-type plasminogen activator treatment has net clinical benefit in patients with leukoaraiosis. Given the risk of bias/confounding, these results should be considered hypothesis-generating and do not justify withholding intravenous thrombolysis.","Charidimou, Andreas; Pasi, Marco; Fiorelli, Marco; Shams, Sara; von Kummer, Rüdiger; Pantoni, Leonardo; Rost, Natalia",Stroke,https://doi.org/10.1161/strokeaha.116.014096; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27491738/,372
136629,Sizing of patent ductus arteriosus in adults for transcatheter closure using the balloon pull-through technique.,2018,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE In some patients, for unknown reasons pain persists after joint replacement, especially in the knee. We determined the prevalence of persistent pain following primary hip or knee replacement and its association with disorders of glucose metabolism, metabolic syndrome (MetS), and obesity. PATIENTS AND METHODS The incidence of pain in the operated joint was surveyed 1-2 years after primary hip replacement (74 patients (4 bilateral)) or primary knee replacement (119 patients (19 bilateral)) in 193 osteoarthritis patients who had participated in a prospective study on perioperative hyperglycemia. Of the 155 patients who completed the survey, 21 had undergone further joint replacement surgery during the follow-up and were excluded, leaving 134 patients for analysis. Persistent pain was defined as daily pain in the operated joint that had lasted over 3 months. Factors associated with persistent pain were evaluated using binary logistic regression with adjustment for age, sex, and operated joint. RESULTS 49 of the 134 patients (37%) had a painful joint and 18 of them (14%) had persistent pain. A greater proportion of knee patients than hip patients had a painful joint (46% vs. 24%; p = 0.01) and persistent pain (20% vs. 4%; p = 0.007). Previously diagnosed diabetes was strongly associated with persistent pain (5/19 vs. 13/115 in those without; adjusted OR = 8, 95% CI: 2-38) whereas MetS and obesity were not. However, severely obese patients (BMI ≥ 35) had a painful joint (but not persistent pain) more often than patients with BMI < 30 (14/21 vs. 18/71; adjusted OR = 5, 95% CI: 2-15).

OBJECTIVE To develop a ventilator bundle and care practices for nurses in critical care units to reduce the rate of ventilator-associated pneumonia. METHOD The ventilator bundle developed by the Institute for Healthcare Improvement was expanded to include protocols for mouth care and hand washing, head-of-bed alarms, subglottic suctioning, and use of an electronic compliance feedback tool. Compliance audits were used to provide immediate electronic feedback. RESULTS Adherence to practices included in the bundle increased. Compliance rates were greater than 98% for prophylaxis for peptic ulcer disease and deep-vein thrombosis, interruption of sedation, and elevation of the head of the bed. The compliance rate for the oral care protocol increased from 76% to 96.8%. Readiness for extubation reached at least 92.4%. Rates of ventilator-associated pneumonia decreased from 9.47 to 1.9 cases per 1000 ventilator days. The decrease in rates produced an estimated savings of approximately $1.5 million. CONCLUSION Strict adherence to bundled practices for preventing ventilator-associated pneumonia, enhanced accountability for initiating protocols, use of a feedback system, and interdisciplinary collaboration improved patients' outcomes and produced marked savings in costs.","Sedwick, Mary Beth; Lance-Smith, Mary; Reeder, Sara J; Nardi, Jessica",Critical care nurse,https://doi.org/10.4037/ccn2012964; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22855078/,372

There is increasing emphasis on the need for patient-reported outcomes (PROs) to evaluate fully the effectiveness and quality of surgical interventions. The objective of this study was to identify the outcomes reported in clinical studies published in high-impact surgical journals and the frequency with which PROs are used. METHODS Electronic versions of material published between 2008 and 2012 in the four highest-impact non-subspecialty surgical journals (Annals of Surgery, British Journal of Surgery (BJS), Journal of the American College of Surgeons (JACS), Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) Surgery) were hand-searched. Clinical studies of adult patients undergoing planned abdominal, thoracic or vascular surgery were included. Reported outcomes were classified into five categories using Wilson and Cleary's conceptual model. RESULTS A total of 893 articles were assessed, of which 770 were included in the analysis. Some 91·6 per cent of studies reported biological and physiological outcomes, 36·0 per cent symptoms, 13·4 per cent direct indicators of functional status, 10·6 per cent general health perception and 14·8 per cent overall quality of life (QoL). The proportion of studies with at least one PRO was 38·7 per cent overall and 73·4 per cent in BJS (P < 0·001). The proportion of studies using a formal measure of health-related QoL ranged from 8·9 per cent (JAMA Surgery) to 33·8 per cent (BJS). CONCLUSION The predominant reporting of clinical endpoints and the inconsistent use of PROs underscore the need for further research and education to enhance the applicability of these measures in specific surgical settings.","Antonescu, I; Mueller, C L; Fried, G M; Vassiliou, M C; Mayo, N E; Feldman, L S",The British journal of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1002/bjs.9450; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24615616/,372

137453,Significant reduction in systolic blood pressure following renal artery stenting in patients with uncontrolled hypertension: results from the HERCULES trial.,2012,"BACKGROUND Maternal obesity is associated with health risks for women and their babies and is exacerbated by excess gestational weight gain. The aim of this study was to describe women's experiences and perspectives in attending a Healthy Pregnancy Service designed to optimise healthy lifestyle and support recommended gestational weight gain for women with obesity. METHODS An explanatory sequential mixed methods study design utilised two questionnaires (completed in early and late pregnancy) to quantify feelings, motivation and satisfaction with the service, followed by semi-structured interviews that explored barriers and enablers of behaviour change. Data were analysed separately and then interpreted together. RESULTS Overall, 49 women attending the service completed either questionnaire 1, 2 or both and were included in the analysis. Fourteen women were interviewed. Prior to pregnancy, many women had gained weight and attempted to lose weight independently, and reported they were highly motivated to achieve a healthy lifestyle. During pregnancy, diet changes were reported as easier to make and sustain than exercise changes. Satisfaction with the service was high. Key factors identified in qualitative analysis were: service support enabled change; motivation to change behaviour, social support, barriers to making change (intrinsic, extrinsic and clinic-related), post-partum lifestyle and needs. On integration of data, qualitative and quantitative findings aligned. CONCLUSIONS The Healthy Pregnancy service was valued by women. Barriers and enablers to the delivery of an integrated model of maternity care that supported healthy lifestyle and recommended gestational weight gain were identified. These findings have informed and improved implementation and further scale up of this successful service model, integrating healthy lifestyle into routine antenatal care of women with obesity.

This study determined the effect of CHO MR on low-load resistance exercise capacity completed in a fed but glycogen-lowered state. Twelve resistance-trained men (age: 22±4 years; height: 1.79±0.05m; weight: 78.7±7.8kg; bench press 1-RM: 87±21kg; squat 1-RM: 123±19kg) completed two fed-state resistance exercise bouts consisting of 6 sets of bench press and 6 sets of squat to failure at 40% 1-RM. Each bout was preceded by glycogen-depleting cycling the evening before, with feeding controlled to create acute energy deficit and maintain low muscle glycogen. During resistance exercise, participants rinsed with either a 6% CHO MR solution or a taste-matched placebo (PLA) between sets. Total volume workload was greater with CHO MR (9354±2051kg vs. 8525±1911kg, p=0.010). Total number of repetitions of squat were greater with CHO MR (107±26 vs. 92±16, p=0.017); the number of repetitions of bench press were not significantly different (CHO MR: 120±24 vs. PLA: 115±22, p=0.146). This was independent of differences in feeling or arousal. CHO MR may be an effective ergogenic aid for athletes completing resistance exercise when in energy deficit and with low carbohydrate availability. Novelty • CHO MR can increase low-load resistance exercise capacity undertaken in a glycogen-lowered but fed state. • This effect was driven by a greater number of repetitions-to-failure in the squat - using muscles lowered in glycogen content with exhaustive cycling on the evening prior to resistance exercise - but not bench press.","Durkin, Matthew; Akeroyd, Harriet; Holliday, Adrian","Applied physiology, nutrition, and metabolism = Physiologie appliquee, nutrition et metabolisme",https://doi.org/10.1139/apnm-2020-0298; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32726566/,372

However, current nucleic acid amplification involves lengthy procedures in addition to discomfort of taking throat/nasal swabs. Here we describe potential breath-borne volatile organic compound (VOC) biomarkers together with machine learning that can be used for point-of-care screening of COVID-19. Using a commercial gas chromatograph-ion mobility spectrometer (GC-IMS), higher levels of propanol were detected in exhaled breath of COVID-19 patients (N=74) and non-COVID-19 respiratory infections (RI) (N=30) than those of non-COVID-19 controls (NC) / health care workers (HCW) (N=87), and backgrounds (N=87). In contrast, breath-borne acetone was found to be significantly lower for COVID-19 patients than other subjects. Twelve key endogenous VOC species using supervised machine learning models (Support Vector Machines (SVM), Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM) and Random Forests) were shown to exhibit strong capabilities in discriminating COVID-19 from (HCW+NC) and RI with a precision ranging from 91% to 100%. GBM and Random Forests models can also discriminate RI patients from healthy subjects with a precision of 100%. In addition, the developed models using breath-borne VOC could also detect a confirmed COVID-19 patient but with a false negative throat swab PCR test. It takes ten minutes to allow an entire breath test to finish, including analysis of the 12 key VOC species. The developed technology provides a novel concept for non-invasive rapid point-of-care-test (POCT) screening for COVID-19 in various scenarios.

METHODS Prospectively collected data of all patients treated for CRLM between 2004 and 2009 were reviewed retrospectively. The database was analysed for operative details, hospital stay, postoperative results and medium-term survival. RESULTS Over 5 years, 135 patients underwent liver surgery for CRLM. For laparoscopic procedures, the median duration of operation was 220 min and median blood loss was 363 ml; a mean tumour-free resection margin of 17.0 mm was achieved (more than 1 cm in 76 per cent), and no port-site metastasis or surgical-site recurrence was observed. The procedure was converted to open surgery in six patients (two for bleeding). Overall survival for the laparoscopic group approached 90 per cent with median follow-up of 22 months. CONCLUSION In this series totally laparoscopic CRLM resection had good short- and medium-term results in terms of mortality, morbidity, resection margins, local recurrence or port-site metastasis, and survival. Compared with contemporaneous open experience, the laparoscopic approach was safe and effective in a highly selected consecutive series.","Abu Hilal, M; Underwood, T; Zuccaro, M; Primrose, J; Pearce, N",The British journal of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1002/bjs.7034; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20474003/,372

Using an in vitro hypoxia model to mimic ischemia, we found that hypoxia stimulated Wnt3a expression. A mechanistic study showed that hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α) was directly recruited to the Wnt3a promoter. Wnt3a overexpression significantly decreased cell viability, promoted the generation of apoptotic cells, and enhanced hypoxia-induced injury in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes. This was partially through the upregulation of Caspase-3 mRNA levels and cleaved PARP-1 protein levels. In addition, we observed that Wnt3a exacerbated hypoxia-induced mitochondrial dysfunction and cytosolic release of cytochrome C. Furthermore, we found that Sirt3, a mitochondrial NAD+-dependent deacetylase that modulates mitochondrial metabolism and homeostasis, was negatively regulated by Wnt3a. Conversely, Sirt3 overexpression repressed Wnt3a expression and ameliorated the hypoxia-induced mitochondrial dysfunction. Overall, our findings suggest that the hypoxia-Wnt3a-Sirt3 regulatory axis might be a potential target for cell protection in cardiac ischemia and hypoxia.","Li, Yanming; Du, Luping; Cheng, Siya; Guo, Jingjing; Zhu, Shengnan; Wang, Yunlong; Gao, Hai",Cytokine,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cyto.2020.155237; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32818702/,372

The impact of Bt crops on bacterial communities has only been assessed under short-term, and results have been contradictory. Here, we analyzed the bacterial communities in three niches, rhizosphere soil (RS), root endosphere (RE) and leaf endosphere (LE), of three Bt rice and their non-Bt parental lines for three consecutive years by high-throughput sequencing. In principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) and PERMANOVA (Adonis) analysis, operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were clustered primarily by niche type and differed significantly in the RE and LE but not in the RS between each of three Bt lines compared with the non-Bt rice line, and not in each respective niche among the three Bt rice lines. The bacterial communities in the RS of different rice lines over the 3 years were clustered mainly by year rather than by lines. The differential bacterial taxa among the lines did not overlap between years, presumably because Cry proteins are rapidly degraded in the soil. A network analysis of RS bacterial communities showed that the network complexity and density for the three Bt rice lines did not decrease compared with those for the non-Bt line. In conclusion, our results demonstrated that bacterial communities differed significantly in RE and LE between Bt and non-Bt rice lines, but the differences were mild and transient, and had no adverse impact on RS over the 3 years. This study provides favorable evidence in support of the commercialization of Bt rice.","Wu, Nan; Shi, Wencong; Liu, Wenwen; Gao, Zheng; Han, Lanzhi; Wang, Xifeng",Ecotoxicology and environmental safety,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoenv.2021.112569; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34352582/,372

150042,A new one-step procedure for pulmonary valve implantation of the melody valve: Simultaneous prestenting and valve implantation.,2018,"Tessellated calcified cartilage (TCC) is a distinctive kind of biomineralized perichondral tissue found in many modern and extinct chondrichthyans (sharks, rays, chimaeroids and their extinct allies). Customarily, this feature has been treated somewhat superficially in phylogenetic analyses, often as a single 'defining' character of a chondrichthyan clade. TCC is actually a complex hard tissue with numerous distinctive attributes, but its utility as a character complex for phylogenetic analysis has not yet been optimized. In this paper, we attempt to improve this situation by presenting new terminology for certain aspects of tesseral architecture, including single-monolayered, multiple-monolayered, polylayered and voussoir tesserae; new histological data, including thin sections of TCC in several Paleozoic taxa; and new proposals for ways in which various characters and states (many of which are defined here for the first time) could be applied in future phylogenetic analyses of chondrichthyan fishes. We conclude that many, but not all of the unique attributes of modern TCC were evolved by the Early Devonian (ca 400 MY). The globular calcified cartilage reported in Silurian sinacanthids, and the so-called 'sub-tessellated' perichondral biomineralization (with irregular and ill-defined geometries of a layer or layers of calcified cartilage blocks) of certain extinct 'acanthodians' (e.g., Climatius, Ischnacanthus, Cheiracanthus) could represent evolutionary precursors of TCC, which seems to characterize only part of the chondrichthyan total group. We hypothesize that heavily biomineralized 'layer-cake' TCC in certain Paleozoic chondrichthyans perhaps served a dual physiological role, as a phosphate sink and in providing increased skeletal density in very large (7+ m) Devonian-Permian marine sharks such as ctenacanths, and as an adaptation to calcium-deficient environments among Permo-Carboniferous non-marine sharks such as xenacanths. By contrast, the equivalent tissue in modern elasmobranchs probably serves only to reinforce regions of cartilage (mostly in the jaws) subjected to high loading. We also note that much of the variation observed in tesseral architecture (including localized remodeling), ultrastructure and histology in modern and extinct chondrichthyans is confined to the perichondrally-facing cap zone (where Type-1 collagen matrix predominates in modern TCC), whereas the main body of the tessera (where Type-2 collagen matrix predominates) exhibits comparatively little evidence of remodeling and histological or structural variation.

150448,Angiographic assessment of the efficacy of flow diverter treatment for cerebral aneurysms.,2019,"The clinical signature of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the deposition of aggregated Aβ fibrils that are neurotoxic to the brain. It is the major form of dementia affecting older people worldwide, impeding their normal function. Finding and testing various natural compounds to target and disrupt stable Aβ fibrils seems to be a promising and attractive therapeutic approach. Four phenolic compounds from plant sources were taken into consideration for the present work, and were initially screened by docking. Ellagic acid (REF) came out to be the best binder of the Aβ oligomer from docking studies. To test the destabilization effect of REF on the Aβ oligomer, MD simulation was conducted. The simulation outcome obtained clearly indicates a drift of terminal chains from the Aβ oligomer, leading to the disorganization of the characteristically organized cross β structure of the Aβ fibrils. Increased values of RMSD, Rg, RMSF, and SASA are indicative of the destabilization of the Aβ fibril in the presence of REF. The disruption of salt bridges and a notable decline in the number of hydrogen bonds and β-sheet content explain the conformational changes in the Aβ fibril structure, ceasing their neurotoxicity. The MM-PBSA results revealed the binding of REF to chain A of the Aβ oligomer. The destabilization potential of ellagic acid, as explained by the MD simulation study, establishes it as a promising drug for curing AD. The molecular-level details about the destabilization mechanism of ellagic acid encourage the intensive mining of other natural compounds for therapeutic intervention for AD.","Gupta, Shivani; Dasmahapatra, Ashok Kumar",Physical chemistry chemical physics : PCCP,https://doi.org/10.1039/d0cp02459g; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32830209/,372
151159,"Hybrid, Y-configured, dual stent-assisted coil embolization in the treatment of wide-necked bifurcation aneurysms.",2015,"BACKGROUND Chronic bronchitis (CB) has been related to poor outcomes in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). From a clinical standpoint, we have shown that subjects with CB in a group with moderate to severe airflow obstruction were younger, more likely to be current smokers, male, Caucasian, had worse health related quality of life, more dyspnea, and increased exacerbation history compared to those without CB. We sought to further refine our clinical characterization of chronic bronchitics in a larger cohort and analyze the CT correlates of CB in COPD subjects. We hypothesized that COPD patients with CB would have thicker airways and a greater history of smoking, acute bronchitis, allergic rhinitis, and occupational exposures compared to those without CB. METHODS We divided 2703 GOLD 1-4 subjects in the Genetic Epidemiology of COPD (COPDGene®) Study into two groups based on symptoms: chronic bronchitis (CB+, n = 663, 24.5%) and no chronic bronchitis (CB-, n = 2040, 75.5%). Subjects underwent extensive clinical characterization, and quantitative CT analysis to calculate mean wall area percent (WA%) of 6 segmental airways was performed using VIDA PW2 (http://www.vidadiagnostics.com). Square roots of the wall areas of bronchi with internal perimeters 10 mm and 15 mm (Pi10 and Pi15, respectively), % emphysema, %gas trapping, were calculated using 3D Slicer (http://www.slicer.org). RESULTS There were no differences in % emphysema (11.4 ± 12.0 vs. 12.0 ± 12.6%, p = 0.347) or % gas trapping (35.3 ± 21.2 vs. 36.3 ± 20.6%, p = 0.272) between groups. Mean segmental WA% (63.0 ± 3.2 vs. 62.0 ± 3.1%, p < 0.0001), Pi10 (3.72 ± 0.15 vs. 3.69 ± 0.14 mm, p < 0.0001), and Pi15 (5.24 ± 0.22 vs. 5.17 ± 0.20, p < 0.0001) were greater in the CB + group. Greater percentages of gastroesophageal reflux, allergic rhinitis, histories of asthma and acute bronchitis, exposures to dusts and occupational exposures, and current smokers were seen in the CB + group. In multivariate binomial logistic regression, male gender, Caucasian race, a lower FEV1%, allergic rhinitis, history of acute bronchitis, current smoking, and increased airway wall thickness increased odds for having CB. CONCLUSIONS Histories of asthma, allergic rhinitis, acute bronchitis, current smoking, a lower FEV1%, Caucasian race, male gender, and increased airway wall thickness are associated with CB. These data provide clinical and radiologic correlations to the clinical phenotype of CB.","Kim, Victor; Davey, Adam; Comellas, Alejandro P; Han, Meilan K; Washko, George; Martinez, Carlos H; Lynch, David; Lee, Jin Hwa; Silverman, Edwin K; Crapo, James D; Make, Barry J; Criner, Gerard J",Respiratory research,https://doi.org/10.1186/1465-9921-15-52; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24766722/,372
153070,Mechanical thrombectomy in acute basilar artery occlusion: A safety and efficacy single centre study.,2016,"OBJECTIVE/BACKGROUND Several plaque and lesion characteristics have been associated with an increased risk for procedural stroke during or shortly after carotid artery stenting (CAS). While technical advancements in stent design and cerebral protection devices (CPD) may help reduce the procedural stroke risk, and anatomy remains important, tailoring stenting procedures according to plaque and lesion characteristics might be a useful strategy in reducing stroke associated with CAS. In this descriptive report of the ongoing Asymptomatic Carotid Surgery Trial-2 (ACST-2), it was assessed whether choice for stent and use or type of CPD was influenced by plaque and lesion characteristics. METHODS Trial patients who underwent CAS between 2008 and 2015 were included in this study. Chi-square statistics were used to study the effects of plaque echolucency, ipsilateral preocclusive disease (90-99%), and contralateral high-grade stenosis (>50%) or occlusion of the carotid artery on interventionalists' choice for stent and CPD. Differences in treatment preference between specialties were also analysed. RESULTS In this study, 831 patients from 88 ACST-2 centres were included. Almost all procedures were performed by either interventional radiologists (50%) or vascular surgeons (45%). Plaque echolucency, ipsilateral preocclusive disease (90-99%), and significant contralateral stenosis (>50%) or occlusion did not affect the choice of stent or either the use of cerebral protection and type of CPD employed (i.e., filter/flow reversal). Vascular surgeons used a CPD significantly more often than interventional radiologists (98.6% vs. 76.3%; p < .001), but this choice did not appear to be dependent on patient characteristics. CONCLUSION In ACST-2, plaque characteristics and severity of stenosis did not primarily determine interventionalists' choice of stent or use or type of CPD, suggesting that other factors, such as vascular anatomy or personal and centre preference, may be more important. Stent and CPD use was highly heterogeneous among participating European centres.","de Waard, D D; Halliday, A; de Borst, G J; Bulbulia, R; Huibers, A; Casana, R; Bonati, L H; Tolva, V",European journal of vascular and endovascular surgery : the official journal of the European Society for Vascular Surgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejvs.2016.12.034; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28291675/,372
153645,The transradial approach for carotid artery stenting.,2012,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW Autologous fat transfer (AFT) is gaining popularity in periorbital and facial rejuvenation as well as structural reconstruction because of the advantages of fat over other fillers and implants. RECENT FINDINGS As the technique and instruments were refined over the years, the incidence of AFT morbidity decreased; however, there is still no consensus on the standardization of the procedure. Several studies have failed to demonstrate superiority of any routine technique; however, various suggestions provided by these investigations have had significant impact on the outcome of surgery. New insights are mainly focused on improving the survival of the grafted tissue, mainly through enhancing cell differentiation and angiogenesis. Clinical applications of adipose-derived stem cell (ADSC) transfer with or without other enhancers were proven to be successful; however, there is not enough human research on this topic yet. Experts made a clear distinction between AFT and ADSC transfer, and the details can be found in this report. Management of hard-to-treat maxillofacial conditions including orbital disorders evolved from AFT techniques, the so-called structural fat grafting.

155109,Outcomes of preoperative bridging therapy for patients undergoing surgery after coronary stent implantation: a weighted meta-analysis of 280 patients from eight studies.,2015,"BACKGROUND Evidence from disease epidemics shows that healthcare workers are at risk of developing short- and long-term mental health problems. The World Health Organization (WHO) has warned about the potential negative impact of the COVID-19 crisis on the mental well-being of health and social care professionals. Symptoms of mental health problems commonly include depression, anxiety, stress, and additional cognitive and social problems; these can impact on function in the workplace. The mental health and resilience (ability to cope with the negative effects of stress) of frontline health and social care professionals ('frontline workers' in this review) could be supported during disease epidemics by workplace interventions, interventions to support basic daily needs, psychological support interventions, pharmacological interventions, or a combination of any or all of these. OBJECTIVES Objective 1: to assess the effects of interventions aimed at supporting the resilience and mental health of frontline health and social care professionals during and after a disease outbreak, epidemic or pandemic. Objective 2: to identify barriers and facilitators that may impact on the implementation of interventions aimed at supporting the resilience and mental health of frontline health and social care professionals during and after a disease outbreak, epidemic or pandemic. SEARCH METHODS On 28 May 2020 we searched the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Global Index Medicus databases and WHO Institutional Repository for Information Sharing. We also searched ongoing trials registers and Google Scholar. We ran all searches from the year 2002 onwards, with no language restrictions. SELECTION CRITERIA We included studies in which participants were health and social care professionals working at the front line during infectious disease outbreaks, categorised as epidemics or pandemics by WHO, from 2002 onwards. For objective 1 we included quantitative evidence from randomised trials, non-randomised trials, controlled before-after studies and interrupted time series studies, which investigated the effect of any intervention to support mental health or resilience, compared to no intervention, standard care, placebo or attention control intervention, or other active interventions. For objective 2 we included qualitative evidence from studies that described barriers and facilitators to the implementation of interventions. Outcomes critical to this review were general mental health and resilience. Additional outcomes included psychological symptoms of anxiety, depression or stress; burnout; other mental health disorders; workplace staffing; and adverse events arising from interventions. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Pairs of review authors independently applied selection criteria to abstracts and full papers, with disagreements resolved through discussion. One review author systematically extracted data, cross-checked by a second review author. For objective 1, we assessed risk of bias of studies of effectiveness using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool. For objective 2, we assessed methodological limitations using either the CASP (Critical Appraisal Skills Programme) qualitative study tool, for qualitative studies, or WEIRD (Ways of Evaluating Important and Relevant Data) tool, for descriptive studies. We planned meta-analyses of pairwise comparisons for outcomes if direct evidence were available. Two review authors extracted evidence relating to barriers and facilitators to implementation, organised these around the domains of the Consolidated Framework of Implementation Research, and used the GRADE-CERQual approach to assess confidence in each finding. We planned to produce an overarching synthesis, bringing quantitative and qualitative findings together. MAIN RESULTS We included 16 studies that reported implementation of an intervention aimed at supporting the resilience or mental health of frontline workers during disease outbreaks (severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS): 2; Ebola: 9; Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS): 1; COVID-19: 4). Interventions studied included workplace interventions, such as training, structure and communication (6 studies); psychological support interventions, such as counselling and psychology services (8 studies); and multifaceted interventions (2 studies). Objective 1: a mixed-methods study that incorporated a cluster-randomised trial, investigating the effect of a work-based intervention, provided very low-certainty evidence about the effect of training frontline healthcare workers to deliver psychological first aid on a measure of burnout. Objective 2: we included all 16 studies in our qualitative evidence synthesis; we classified seven as qualitative and nine as descriptive studies. We identified 17 key findings from multiple barriers and facilitators reported in studies. We did not have high confidence in any of the findings; we had moderate confidence in six findings and low to very low confidence in 11 findings. We are moderately confident that the following two factors were barriers to intervention implementation: frontline workers, or the organisations in which they worked, not being fully aware of what they needed to support their mental well-being; and a lack of equipment, staff time or skills needed for an intervention. We are moderately confident that the following three factors were facilitators of intervention implementation: interventions that could be adapted for local needs; having effective communication, both formally and socially; and having positive, safe and supportive learning environments for frontline workers. We are moderately confident that the knowledge or beliefs, or both, that people have about an intervention can act as either barriers or facilitators to implementation of the intervention. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS There is a lack of both quantitative and qualitative evidence from studies carried out during or after disease epidemics and pandemics that can inform the selection of interventions that are beneficial to the resilience and mental health of frontline workers. Alternative sources of evidence (e.g. from other healthcare crises, and general evidence about interventions that support mental well-being) could therefore be used to inform decision making. When selecting interventions aimed at supporting frontline workers' mental health, organisational, social, personal, and psychological factors may all be important. Research to determine the effectiveness of interventions is a high priority. The COVID-19 pandemic provides unique opportunities for robust evaluation of interventions. Future studies must be developed with appropriately rigorous planning, including development, peer review and transparent reporting of research protocols, following guidance and standards for best practice, and with appropriate length of follow-up. Factors that may act as barriers and facilitators to implementation of interventions should be considered during the planning of future research and when selecting interventions to deliver within local settings.","Pollock, Alex; Campbell, Pauline; Cheyne, Joshua; Cowie, Julie; Davis, Bridget; McCallum, Jacqueline; McGill, Kris; Elders, Andrew; Hagen, Suzanne; McClurg, Doreen; Torrens, Claire; Maxwell, Margaret",The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.cd013779; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33150970/,372
155291,Use of a flow-diverting stent for ruptured dissecting aneurysm treatment in a patient with sickle cell disease.,2016,"INTRODUCTION Pediatric pulmonary embolism (PE) is rare but associated with adverse outcomes. We aimed to characterize PE cases admitted in a tertiary hospital and to evaluate sensitivity of selected PE diagnostic prediction tools. METHODS Retrospective, descriptive study of PE cases admitted from 2008 to 2020 using data collected from hospital records. Patients were grouped according to PE severity and setting (outpatients vs. inpatients). Links and correlation with demographic characteristics, risk factors, clinical presentation, management, and outcomes were analyzed. PE diagnostic prediction tools were applied. RESULTS Twenty-nine PE episodes occurred in 27 patients, 62.9% female, mean age 14.1 years. Most PE were central and split between massive or submassive. One was diagnosed in autopsy. Twenty outpatients, all adolescents, were admitted for classic PE symptoms; in half of them the diagnosis had been previously missed. Risk factors included contraceptives (65%), thrombophilia (35%), obesity (20%) and auto-immunity (20%). Eight inpatients, diagnosed during cardiorespiratory deterioration (n = 5), or through incidental radiological findings (n = 3), were younger and had immobilization (87.5%), complex chronic diseases (75%), infections (75%) and central venous catheter (62.5%) as risk factors. Retrospectively, d-dimer testing and adult scores performed better than pediatric scores (sensitivity 92.9%-96% vs. 85.7%-92.9%). Both pediatric scores missed a case with a positive family history. DISCUSSION Pediatric PE diagnosis is often delayed or missed. Development of pediatric prediction tools from validated adult scores merits being explored. We argue clinical presentation and risk factors may be different in inpatients and outpatients and propose broader reliance on family history.","Lopes de Bragança, Raquel; Gorito, Vanessa; Cibele, Diana Gonçalves; Ricca Gonçalves, Luciana; Ribeiro, Augusto; Baptista, Maria João; Azevedo, Inês",Pediatric pulmonology,https://doi.org/10.1002/ppul.25527; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34133850/,372

It is therefore a prominent issue for psychiatric inpatient units. The COVID-19 pandemic has meant that many psychiatric inpatient units are no longer granting leave and outdoor smoking breaks, prompting the question of whether to allow tobacco smoking or enforce smoking bans in mental health services. There is currently mixed evidence that tobacco smoking is associated with a higher risk of developing COVID-19 and poorer outcomes for COVID-19 cases, potentially due to current small sample sizes. Considering the benefits of smoking cessation in this vulnerable population, the current pandemic should be used as an opportunity to further enforce smoking cessation in mental health facilities and encourage nicotine replacement therapy alongside cessation counseling.","Seiler, Natalie Kim; Swamy, Rajeev; Xiao, Junhua; Yun, Yang",Journal of addictive diseases,https://doi.org/10.1080/10550887.2020.1791379; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32657671/,372

This study aimed to analyze the changes of in-hospital mortality, medical costs, and other outcomes in ECMO therapy. We used 2004-2017 data from a nationwide healthcare administrative claims database in Korea. Overall, 14,775 ECMO procedures were performed in 14,689 patients at 112 hospitals. We found a 170-fold and a 334-fold increase in the number of ECMO procedures and related costs, respectively. For indications, the performance of ECMO for heart or lung transplantation and respiratory failure increased, whereas that for cardiovascular surgery decreased. The duration of ECMO increased from a median of 3 days (IQR, 2-5 days) in 2004 to 4 days (IQR, 2-9 days) in 2017. The overall in-hospital mortality rate was 68.6%, and this improved over time, especially for lung transplantation and respiratory failure patients. Bleeding-related complications and the transfusion amount also decreased. Hospitals with higher case volume showed better survival outcomes. The median cost per procedure and per day was 26,538 USD (IQR, 14,646-47,862 USD) and 1,560 USD (IQR, 903-2,929 USD), respectively, and increased with time. A trend toward greater resource use and better outcomes requires additional cost-effective analysis based on indications.","Jang, Eun Jin; Jung, Sun-Young; Lee, Hyun Joo; Kim, Myo-Song; Na, Kwon Joong; Park, Samina; Park, In Kyu; Kang, Chang Hyun; Kim, Young Tae",ASAIO journal,https://doi.org/10.1097/mat.0000000000001331; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33315655/,372

This research was designed to examine if technology-enacted abusive supervision has an impact on both the work and family domains. Based on conservation of resources theory, we theorize that technology-enacted abusive supervision enhances subordinate engagement in emotional labor surface acting, which contributes to emotional exhaustion, which in turn impacts both the work and family domains. Results demonstrate significant paths in both domains. Subordinate perceptions of technology-enacted abusive supervision are positively related to the engagement in technology-enacted incivility through the serial mediation of emotional labor surface acting and emotional exhaustion. Additionally, subordinate perceptions of technology-enacted abusive supervision are positively related to family undermining at home for the subordinate through the serial mediation of emotional labor surface acting, emotional exhaustion, and stress transmission.","Valle, Matthew; Carlson, Dawn S; Carlson, John R; Zivnuska, Suzanne; Harris, Kenneth J; Harris, Ranida B",The Journal of social psychology,https://doi.org/10.1080/00224545.2020.1816885; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32962561/,372

METHODS We did a retrospective, observational study of HCP at Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University for the management of COVID-19 (before person-to-person transmission was official confirmed, no additional protection was provided). A questionnaire was given to all staff listed on the roster in the clinical regions providing care for index patients with COVID-19. All participants were surveyed regarding hand-washing and use of surgical masks and gloves and were tested for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Data were analysed (Student's t test and Pearson χ2 test) for an association between infection and use of personal protective equipment. RESULTS Exposure of a total of 299 non-infected and 30 infected staff was confirmed. None of the 149 staff who reported use of all three preventative measures (hand-washing and use of gloves and masks) became infect-ed. In contrast, all 30 of the staff who became infected had omitted at least one of the measures. Fewer staff who wore surgical masks (P=0.000003) became infected compared with those who did not. Infections rates were significantly lower in HCP from the internal medicine departments, as these personnel generally wore masks. CONCLUSION An association was found between SARS-CoV-2 infection of HCP and the non-use of masks when working with index cases in clinical settings. We recommend that all HCP follow the strict instructions for prevention and treatment of nosocomial infection during intimate contact with COVID-19, especially staff from surgical departments.","Pan, Zhengqi; Zhang, Huijing; Yang, Jianming; Tang, Shengli; Cheng, Zhenshun; Wu, Kaisong; Liu, Bing",Clinical and investigative medicine.

159496,A protein complex in the brush-border membrane explains a Hartnup disorder allele.,2008,"Ultrasound molecular imaging has great potential to impact early disease diagnosis, evaluation of disease progression and the development of target-specific therapy. In this paper, two neuropilin-1 (NRP) targeted peptides, CRPPR and ATWLPPR, were conjugated onto the surface of lipid microbubbles (MBs) to evaluate molecular imaging of tumor angiogenesis in a breast cancer model. Development of a molecular imaging agent using CRPPR has particular importance due to the previously demonstrated internalizing capability of this and similar ligands. In vitro, CRPPR MBs bound to an NRP-expressing cell line 2.6 and 15.6 times more than ATWLPPR MBs and non-targeted (NT) MBs, respectively, and the binding was inhibited by pretreating the cells with an NRP antibody. In vivo, the backscattered intensity within the tumor, relative to nearby vasculature, increased over time during the ∼6 min circulation of the CRPPR-targeted contrast agents providing high contrast images of angiogenic tumors. Approximately 67% of the initial signal from CRPPR MBs remained bound after the majority of circulating MBs had cleared (8 min), 8 and 4.5 times greater than ATWLPPR and NT MBs, respectively. Finally, at 7-21 days after the first injection, we found that CRPPR MBs cleared faster from circulation and tumor accumulation was reduced likely due to a complement-mediated recognition of the targeted microbubble and a decrease in angiogenic vasculature, respectively. In summary, we find that CRPPR MBs specifically bind to NRP-expressing cells and provide an effective new agent for molecular imaging of angiogenesis.","Zhang, Hua; Tam, Sarah; Ingham, Elizabeth S; Mahakian, Lisa M; Lai, Chun-Yen; Tumbale, Spencer K; Teesalu, Tambet; Hubbard, Neil E; Borowsky, Alexander D; Ferrara, Katherine W",Biomaterials,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2015.03.043; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25934284/,372
159841,Short-versus long-term Dual Antiplatelet therapy after drug-eluting stent implantation in women versus men: A sex-specific patient-level pooled-analysis of six randomized trials.,2017,"BACKGROUND Health workers routinely carry out clinical behaviours, such as prescribing, test-ordering or hand-washing, which impact on patient diagnoses, care, treatment and recovery. Social norms are the implicit or explicit rules that a group uses to determine values, beliefs, attitudes and behaviours. A social norms intervention seeks to change the clinical behaviour of a target health worker by exposing them to the values, beliefs, attitudes or behaviours of a reference group or person. This study aims to find out whether or not social norms interventions are effective ways of encouraging health workers to carry out desired behaviours and to identify which types of social norms intervention, if any, are most effective. METHODS A systematic review will be conducted. The inclusion criteria are a population of health professionals, a social norms intervention that seeks to change a clinical behaviour, and randomised controlled trials. Searches will be undertaken in MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, British Nursing Index, ISI Web of Science, PsycINFO and Cochrane trials. Titles and abstracts will be reviewed against the inclusion criteria to exclude any that are clearly ineligible. Two reviewers will independently screen all the remaining full texts to identify relevant papers. For studies which meet our inclusion criteria, two reviewers will extract data independently, code for behaviour change techniques and assess quality using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. The primary outcome measure will be compliance with desired behaviour. To assess the effect of social norms on the behaviour of health workers, we will perform fixed effects meta-analysis and present forest plots, stratified by behaviour change technique. We will explore sources of variation using meta-regression and may use multi-component-based network meta-analysis to explore which forms of social norms are more likely to be effective, if our data meet the necessary requirements. DISCUSSION The study will provide evidence regarding the effectiveness of different methods of applying social norms to change the clinical behaviour of health professionals.

The sympathetic nervous system plays a significant pathophysiological role in hypertension. Surgical sympathectomy for blood pressure reduction is an old but extremely efficacious therapeutic concept, since abandoned, with the dawn of safer contemporary pharmacology era. Recently, clinical studies have revealed promising results for safe and sustained blood pressure reduction with percutaneous renal sympathetic denervation. This is a novel, minimally-invasive, device-based therapy, specifically targeting and ablating the renal artery nerves with radiofrequency waves, without permanent implantation. There are also reported additional benefits in related comorbidities, such as impaired glucose metabolism, renal impairment, left ventricular hypertrophy, heart failure, and others.

The objectives of this study were to identify possible correlations between the aetiology of effusion and clinical and laboratory findings. METHODS In this retrospective study of 306 cats diagnosed with pleural effusion of established aetiology, cats were divided into six major groups: cardiac disease (CD), feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), neoplasia, pyothorax, chylothorax and miscellaneous. Clinical, laboratory and radiographic parameters were compared between groups. RESULTS CD was the most common aetiology (35.3%), followed by neoplasia (30.7%), pyothorax (8.8%), FIP (8.5%), chylothorax (4.6%) and miscellaneous diseases (3.7%). In 26 (8.5%) cats, more than one underlying disease was diagnosed as a possible aetiology for pleural effusion. Cats with FIP were significantly younger than those with CD ( P <0.001) and neoplasia ( P <0.001). Cats with CD were presented with a significantly lower body temperature compared with cats with FIP ( P = 0.022). Cats with CD had significantly higher serum alanine aminotransferase activity compared with all other cats (FIP and pyothorax, P <0.001; neoplasia and chylothorax, P = 0.02) and serum alkaline phosphatase activity compared with the pyothorax ( P <0.001) and FIP groups ( P = 0.04), and significantly lower protein concentrations (FIP, pyothorax and neoplasia, P <0.001; chylothorax, P = 0.04 ) and nucleated cell counts in the effusion than all other groups (pyothorax and neoplasia, P <0.001; chylothorax, P = 0.02; FIP, P = 0.04).The glucose level in the effusion of cats with pyothorax was significantly lower than glucose levels in patients with CD, neoplasia and chylothorax ( P <0.001). Of 249 cats with a follow-up of at least 10 days, 55.8% died or were euthanased during that time. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE CD and neoplasia were the most common causes for feline pleural effusion. Age, liver enzymes, as well as cell count, protein and glucose levels in the effusion can aid in the investigation of underlying aetiologies.","König, Alla; Hartmann, Katrin; Mueller, Ralf S; Wess, Gerhard; Schulz, Bianka S",Journal of feline medicine and surgery,https://doi.org/10.1177/1098612x18816489; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30554552/,372

The term Incomplete Kawasaki disease is used in the presence of a minimum of two diagnostic criteria of clinical Kawasaki syndrome accompanied by at least 5 days of fever, the absence of any other reasons characterising the disease, and the presence of severe systemic inflammation findings. Gastrointestinal symptoms, notably diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and vomiting, frequently occur, and elevated serum aminotransferases, gallbladder hydrops, and rarely other forms of gastrointestinal involvement such as ischaemic colitis, intussusception, hepatic necrosis, splenic infarct, intestinal pseudo-obstruction, colitis, and colon oedema are also reported. In this paper, we present an incomplete and atypical Kawasaki case that explicitly shows gastrointestinal involvement. Progressive bowel oedema was detected in the patient presenting with severe abdominal pain and distension.

Understanding how infectious diseases establish themselves throughout vulnerable communities is crucial for minimising deaths and lowering the total stress on the National Health Service (NHS Scotland). We model the spread of COVID-19 in the health-of NHS Lothian, Scotland over the course of the first wave of the pandemic with a compartmental Susceptible - Exposed - Infected reported - Infected unreported - Recovered - Dead (SEIARD), metapopulation model. Care home residents, care home workers and the rest of the population are modelled as subpopulations, interacting on a network describing their mixing habits. We explicitly model the outbreak's reproduction rate and care home visitation level over time for each subpopulation, and execute a data fit and sensitivity analysis, focusing on parameters responsible for intra-subpopulation mixing: staff sharing, staff shift patterns and visitation. The results suggest that hospital discharges were not predominantly responsible for the early outbreak in care homes, and that only a few such cases led to infection seeding in care homes by the 6th of March Sensitivity analysis show the main mode of entry into care homes are infections by staff interacting with the general population. Visitation (before cancellation) and staff sharing were less significant in affecting outbreak size. Focusing on the protection and monitoring of staff, followed by reductions in staff sharing and quick cancellations of visitation can significantly reduce future infection attack rates of COVID-19 in care homes.","Baister, M.

A single center experience of 13 consecutive patients.,2013,"INTRODUCTION ARI occupying the first place in the structure of total human morbidity. The aim of the study was to investigate the species diversity of the viruses causing AR among residents of the Novosibirsk region during epidemic season (October to April). MATERIALS AND METHODS 164 nasopharyngeal swabs were collected and analyzed. Viral RNA/DNA, cDNA synthesis and PCR were carried out employing ""RIBO-prep"" ""eReverta-L"", ""AmpliSens Influenza virus A/B-FL"" and ""AmpliSens ARI-screen-FL"" kits (CRI of Epidemiology). RESULTS Etiological agent of the disease was found in 69(43%) samples. Monoinfection was found in 58 (35%). In 14 (9%) samples were detected serogroup I coronaviruses, in 13 (8%) rhinoviruses, in 7 (4%) respiratory syncytial virus, in 6 (4%) parainfluenza virus type 1, in 5 (3%) parainfluenza virus type 3. Adenoviruses and bocavirus were identified in 3 (2%) samples. Parainfluenza virus type 2 and 4, metapneumovirus, serogroup Il coronaviruses (HKU1 and OC43) were presented in 2 (1%) samples. In 11 (7%) samples was found mixed infection. CONCLUSION The majority of common colds were caused by serogroup I coronaviruses (NL63 and 229E), rhinoviruses and mixed infections. The peak of species variability of viruses caused acute respiratory infections was determined in age group of children 2-4 years old. In older age groups the species variability of analyzed viruses was decreased, rhinovirus infection becomes prevalent.","Sergeeva, E I; Ivanova, E V; Shvalov, A N; Ternovoĭ, V A; Mikheev, V N; Agafonov, A P; Ivanova, L K; Sergeev, A N",Vestnik Rossiiskoi akademii meditsinskikh nauk,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24340631/,372

In this study, the molecular organization of palmitic acid (PA) films on alkaline buffer solutions (pH 7.4) with and without divalent Ca2+ was measured at a constant surface area using Langmuir troughs coupled with microscopy and X-ray interfacial techniques. Without Ca2+, PA molecules remained a monolayer organization; however, with Ca2+, formation of the inverted bilayers of PA-Ca2+ superstructures caused a spontaneous 2D to 3D transformation under no compression due to the strong interaction between PA and the divalent cation. Self-assembly of this highly-organized inverted bilayer superstructure involved a two-step process of nucleation and nuclei growth. During nucleation, densely packed PA and Ca2+ monolayer firstly corrugated and some of PA and Ca2+ molecules ejected out from the monolayer; the ejected molecules then reorganized and formed the inverted bilayer nuclei. Nucleation was followed by nuclei growth, during which PA and Ca2+ in the monolayer kept integrating into the inverted bilayer structure through molecule migration and PA rotation around Ca2+.","Zhang, Pin; Pham, Tiep; Zheng, Xin; Liu, Chang; Plata, Paola Leon; Král, Petr; Bu, Wei; Lin, Binhua; Liu, Ying",Colloids Surf B Biointerfaces,,372

Understanding of cancer-relevant mechanisms engaged by the virus is essential for the evidence-based management of cancer. The network of SARS-CoV-2 regulatory mechanisms was used to study potential engagement of oncogenes, tumor suppressors, other regulators of tumorigenesis and clinical markers used in the management of cancer patients. Our network analysis confirms links between COVID-19 and tumorigenesis that were predicted in epidemiological reports. The COVID-19 network shows the involvement of tumorigenesis regulators and clinical markers. Regulators of cell proliferation, death, migration, and the immune system were retrieved. Examples are pathways initiated by EGF, VEGF, TGFß and FGF. The SARS-CoV-2 network engages markers for diagnosis, prognosis and selection of treatment. Intersection with cancer diagnostic signatures supports a potential impact of the virus on tumorigenesis. Clinical observations show the diversity of symptoms correlating with biological processes and types of cells engaged by the virus, e.g. epithelial, endothelial, smooth muscle, glial and immune system cells. Our results describe an extensive engagement of cancer-relevant mechanisms and clinical markers by COVID-19. Engagement by the virus of clinical markers provides a rationale for clinical decisions based on these markers.","Souchelnytskyi, Serhiy; Nera, Andriy; Souchelnytskyi, Nazariy",Sci Rep,,372

233203,Remote screening of retinal and optic disc diseases using handheld nonmydriatic cameras in programmed routine occupational health checkups onsite at work centers,2020,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has been a catastrophic burden to global healthcare systems. The fast spread of the etiologic agent, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), highlights the need to identify unknown coronaviruses rapidly for prompt clinical and public health decision making. Moreover, owing to the high mutation rate of RNA viruses, periodic surveillance on emerging variants of key virus components is essential for evaluating the efficacy of antiviral drugs, diagnostic assays and vaccines. These 2 knowledge gaps formed the basis of this study. In the first place, we evaluated the feasibility of characterizing coronaviruses directly from respiratory specimens. We amplified partial RdRP gene, a stable genetic marker of coronaviruses, from a collection of 57 clinical specimens positive for SARS-CoV-2 or other human coronaviruses, and sequenced the amplicons with Nanopore Flongle and MinION, the fastest and the most scalable massively-parallel sequencing platforms to-date. Partial RdRP sequences were successfully amplified and sequenced from 82.46% (47/57) of specimens, ranging from 75 to 100% by virus type, with consensus accuracy of 100% compared with Sanger sequences available (n = 40). In the second part, we further compared 19 SARS-CoV-2 RdRP sequences collected from the first to third waves of COVID-19 outbreak in Hong Kong with 22,173 genomes from GISAID EpiCoV&#8482; database. No single nucleotide variants (SNVs) were found in our sequences, and 125 SNVs were observed from global data, with 56.8% being low-frequency (n = 1-47) missense mutations affecting the rear part of RNA polymerase. Among the 9 SNVs found on 4 conserved domains, the frequency of 15438G > T was highest (n = 34) and was predominantly found in Europe. Our data provided a glimpse into the sequence diversity of a primary antiviral drug and diagnostic target. Further studies are warranted to investigate the significance of these mutations.","Chan, Wai Sing; Au, Chun Hang; Lam, Ho Yin; Wang, Candy Ling Na; Ho, Dona Ngar-Yin; Lam, Yuk Man; Chu, Daniel Ka Wing; Poon, Leo Lit Man; Chan, Tsun Leung; Zee, Jonpaul Sze-Tsing; Ma, Edmond Shiu Kwan; Tang, Bone Siu Fai",Virol J,,372
267073,May home confinement during the COVID-19 outbreak worsen the global burden of myopia?,2020,"In 2019, an aggressive coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has resulted in large-scale epidemic with its deadly outbreak in more than 190 countries and nearly 114 million confirmed cases as of February 2021, along with 2.52 million deaths worldwide. As no proper vaccinations are available, the only viable solution to fight this pandemic is physical distance or social distancing. Reducing the spread of COVID-19 in public areas, and to reduce the rate of losing helpless lives, social distancing is a primary and primitive proposed approach by the World Health Organization (WHO). In shopping malls, organizations, schools and other covered areas, the government and national healthcare authorities have set a 2-meter or 6-foot social distance in their surroundings as a required safety precaution. It is tough for authorities to manage people manually, whether the individuals maintain social distancing in public and crowded areas. Keeping this as our motivation, this research work proposes a simplified and optimized way to achieve social distancing detection between the individuals and notifying the higher officials if it is not maintained properly.

268734,Examination of the effects of COVID 19 on corneal endothelium,2021,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the urology providers' (through a range of training levels) experience utilizing telemedicine given the rapid nationwide implementation of telemedicine in urology practices due to COVID-19. Several studies focusing on the patient's perspective have illustrated that telemedicine is comparable to traditional office visits in terms of cost, communication, and overall satisfaction. However, there is sparse data on the provider's experience. METHODS: With IRB approval, we assessed provider satisfaction with telemedicine at Urology programs in the U.S. through an electronic survey. The 25-question survey was based on the Patient Assessment of Communication of Telehealth which is a validated 33 question instrument that has been utilized to assess the quality of patient-provider communication in telemedicine. Experience with telemedicine was assessed in 2 categories: technical aspects and communication with patients. Variables were rated using a 5-point Likert Scale. RESULTS: There were 144 responses to the survey. 50% of providers reported not receiving any formal training in using telemedicine. This differed significantly by training level with 55% of attendings having had received training vs 20% of residents. Providers felt they would most benefit from training in billing (52%) rather than equipment use (33%) or communication (28%). 87% of providers felt comfortable discussing sensitive topics while only 55% felt comfortable using telehealth to schedule surgery (P < .001). CONCLUSION: Urology providers are generally satisfied with their experience communicating with patients via telemedicine and the majority would opt to continue utilizing telemedicine. Nevertheless, many providers are hesitant to schedule surgery via telemedicine. Providers would benefit from formal training in telemedicine.","Connor, Jessica; Zheng, Yu; Houle, Katherine; Cox, Lindsey",Urology,,372

STUDY DESIGN: Cohort study. METHODS: A 3D printed facial flap simulator was designed from a computed tomography scan and manufactured out of silicone for low-cost, high-fidelity simulation. This simulator was tested by a group of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery trainees at a single institution. The simulator group was compared to a control group who completed an exercise on a traditional paper facial flap exercise. Both groups underwent didactic lectures prior to completing their respective exercises. Pre- and post-exercise Likert scale surveys measuring experience, understanding, effectiveness, and realism were completed by both groups. Central tendency, variability, and confidence intervals were measured to evaluate the outcomes. RESULTS: Trainees completing the facial flap simulator reported a statistically significant (p < 0.05) improvement in overall expertise in facial flap procedures, design of facial flaps, and excision of standing cutaneous deformities. No statistically significant improvement was seen in the control group. CONCLUSIONS: Trainees found the facial flap simulator to be an effective and useful training tool with a high level of realism in surgical education of facial reconstruction.

341299,"Reply to ocular manifestation, eye protection, and COVID-19",2020,"The United Nations deemed internet access to be of critical importance for human rights in 2016. In 2020, schools around the world closed during the COVID-19 pandemic. As schools were closed, inequities in internet access gained widespread public attention as many educational opportunities shifted online. Amidst this shift, this paper analyzes an Ontario provincial announcement to provide 21,000 iPads and free data for young people (ages 4-18), during the pandemic. The closure of schools in Ontario, Canada, meant that young people and families who faced technological challenges, such as a lack of devices, stable and affordable internet connections, or sufficient data allowances, could experience barriers to their right to an education. This paper revisits a community informatics (CI) model of internet access, the Access Rainbow, to analyze attempts to operationalize the right to an education through technology in Ontario. In parallel to rights, however, the field of CI faces the ongoing presence of profit-oriented corporations within universal access efforts. This paper argues that socio-technical infrastructural elements of access to the internet became visible through the breakdown of the pandemic. Furthermore, it considers the multi-stakeholder efforts required to implement useful and effective access, where school boards responded in varied ways locally. The paper contributes the concept of refraction to offer continued theorization of a distributive paradigm and a rights-informed approach in community informatics against the backdrop of the pandemic, which could also act as an opening for privatization and disaster capitalism.","Smith, Karen Louise",Studies in Social Justice,,372
341300,"Reply to ocular manifestation, eye protection, and COVID-19",2020,"The rapid spread of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has led to a global pandemic. The 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) presents with a spectrum of symptoms ranging from mild to critical illness requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission. Acute respiratory distress syndrome is a major complication in patients with severe COVID-19 disease. Currently, there are no recognized pharmacological therapies for COVID-19. However, a large number of COVID-19 patients require respiratory support, with a high percentage requiring invasive ventilation. The rapid spread of the infection has led to a surge in the rate of hospitalizations and ICU admissions, which created a challenge to public health, research, and medical communities. The high demand for several therapies, including sedatives, analgesics, and paralytics, that are often utilized in the care of COVID-19 patients requiring mechanical ventilation, has created pressure on the supply chain resulting in shortages in these critical medications. This has led clinicians to develop conservation strategies and explore alternative therapies for sedation, analgesia, and paralysis in COVID-19 patients. Several of these alternative approaches have demonstrated acceptable levels of sedation, analgesia, and paralysis in different settings but they are not commonly used in the ICU. Additionally, they have unique pharmaceutical properties, limitations, and adverse effects. This narrative review summarizes the literature on alternative drug therapies for the management of sedation, analgesia, and paralysis in COVID-19 patients. Also, this document serves as a resource for clinicians in current and future respiratory illness pandemics in the setting of drug shortages.","Ammar, Mahmoud A; Sacha, Gretchen L; Welch, Sarah C; Bass, Stephanie N; Kane-Gill, Sandra L; Duggal, Abhijit; Ammar, Abdalla A",J Intensive Care Med,,372

The virus affects the respiratory system and it is transmitted through close contact of individuals. Efficient screening of infected patients is a crucial step in standing up to COVID-19. As the virus affects the respiratory system, images of chest X-rays are analyzed using deep learning techniques for early detection of COVID-19. The existing deep learning models identify COVID-19 with an accuracy of 79%. The proposed model focuses on detecting COVID-19 in an effective manner, the model includes the following phases: Preprocessing the image using data augmentation and infusing the trained model with different Convolutional Neural Network architectures. The proposed model uses Residual Neural Network architecture (ResNet-152v2), NASNetLarge, and Visual Geometry Group architecture (VGG16), a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) which are faster when compared to the already existing systems and have an accuracy of 87.50%, 87.50% and 82% respectively.","Selvy, P.

With high transmission rates and increasing evidence of COVID-19 spread via bioaerosols. The current review was conducted to examine airborne pollens impact on COVID-19 transmission and to identify the major gaps for post-pandemic research. The study used all key terms to identify revenant literature and observation were collated for the current research. Based on the existing literature, there is a potential association between pollen bioaerosols and COVID-19. There are few studies focusing on the impact of airborne pollen on SARS-CoV-2, which could be useful to advance future research. Allergic rhinitis and asthma patients were found to have pre-modified immune activation, which could help to provide protection against COVID-19. However, does airborne pollen acts as a potent carrier for SARS-CoV-2 transport, dispersal and its proliferation still require further multidisciplinary research. Further, a clear conclusion cannot be drawn due to limited evidence and hence more research is needed to show how pollen bioaerosols could affect virus survivals. The small but growing literature review focuses on searching for every possible answer to provide additional security layers to overcome near future corona-like infectious diseases.","Khaiwal, Ravindra; Goyal, Akshi; Mor, Suman",Sustain Cities Soc,,372

As a response to the COVID-19 pandemic, many health care services have adopted new digital solutions, which rely on phone and internet connectivity. However, persons who are digitally inaccessible, such as those experiencing poverty or homelessness, are often unable to use these services. In response to this newly highlighted social disparity known as ""digital health inequity,"" emergency physicians at the University Health Network in Toronto, Canada, initiated a program called PHONE-CONNECT (Phones for Healthier Ontarians iN EDs - COvid NEeds met by Cellular Telephone). This novel approach attempts to improve patients' access to health care, information, and social services, as well as improve their ability to adhere to public health directives (social isolation and contact tracing). Although similar programs addressing the same emerging issues have been recently described in the media, this is the first time phones have been provided as a health care intervention in an emergency department. This innovative emergency department point-of-care intervention may have a significant impact on improving health outcomes for vulnerable people during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond.","Kazevman, Gill; Mercado, Marck; Hulme, Jennifer; Somers, Andrea",J Med Internet Res,,372

It mainly spreads via the respiratory route by means of aerosols. The objectives of our study were. To know the prevalence of ENT presentations in COVID 19 patients and to know the relationship between the symptoms and category of the disease as well as to know the relation between the blood group and recovery from the disease. The first 500 patients who were tested positive for COVID 19 and getting treated in our hospital were included in the study after taking written informed consent from the patients who were willing to participate in the study. A detailed history was taken from all the patients and more stress was given on the ENT symptoms with respect to its onset, duration and time taken for the relief of symptoms. The ENT symptoms were compared with the category of the disease as well as the blood group of the patients. Statistical analysis was done using Chi square test and Statistical Package for Social Sciences [SPSS] for Windows Version 22.0 Released 2013. Armonk, NY: IBM Corp., was used to perform statistical analyses. In our study 310 (62.0%) were males and 190 (38.0%) patients were females (38%), of age group ranging from 2 years to 87 years. In our study 367 (73.3%) patients were symptomatic and the rest 133 (26.6%) were asymptomatic. There were 335 (67.0%) patients in category A, 140 (28.0%) in category B and 25 (5.0%) in category C. The most common ENT presentation was headache and its prevelance was more in category C and it was of statistical significance. On comparing the blood group and the ENT symptoms occurrence of sore throat was of statistical significance and its prevelance was more among the O blood group patients. In terms of recovery from the disease the patients with blood group O had good recovery rate. Covid 19 pandemic is still an on going problem and newer strains of the virus are arising as well hence. In our study we found out that isolated ENT symptoms such as aguesia and anosmia were the only presentation of the disease. Thus they can be considered as early marker of the disease and it will be helpful in early detection and isolation of the patient as well as prevention of further spread of the disease.","Smitha, S G; Pillai, Nikitha; Nayak, Bindya; Raveendran, Jedhin",Indian J Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,,372

480747,Letter to the editor: Keeping an eye on the many symptoms of COVID-19,2021,"BACKGROUND: One hundred days after SARS-CoV-2 was first reported in Vietnam on January 23rd, 270 cases were confirmed, with no deaths. We describe the control measures used by the Government and their relationship with imported and domestically-acquired case numbers, with the aim of identifying the measures associated with successful SARS-CoV-2 control. METHODS: Clinical and demographic data on the first 270 SARS-CoV-2 infected cases and the timing and nature of Government control measures, including numbers of tests and quarantined individuals, were analysed. Apple and Google mobility data provided proxies for population movement. Serial intervals were calculated from 33 infector-infectee pairs and used to estimate the proportion of pre-symptomatic transmission events and time-varying reproduction numbers. RESULTS: A national lockdown was implemented between April 1st and 22nd. Around 200 000 people were quarantined and 266 122 RT-PCR tests conducted. Population mobility decreased progressively before lockdown. 60% (163/270) of cases were imported; 43% (89/208) of resolved infections remained asymptomatic for the duration of infection. The serial interval was 3·24 days, and 27·5% (95% confidence interval, 15·7%-40·0%) of transmissions occurred pre-symptomatically. Limited transmission amounted to a maximum reproduction number of 1·15 (95% confidence interval, 0·37-2·36). No community transmission has been detected since April 15th. CONCLUSIONS: Vietnam has controlled SARS-CoV-2 spread through the early introduction of mass communication, meticulous contact-tracing with strict quarantine, and international travel restrictions. The value of these interventions is supported by the high proportion of asymptomatic and imported cases, and evidence for substantial pre-symptomatic transmission.","Pham, Quang Thai; Rabaa, Maia A; Duong, Huy Luong; Dang, Quang Tan; Tran, Dai Quang; Quach, Ha-Linh; Hoang, Ngoc-Anh Thi; Phung, Cong Dinh; Ngu, Duy Nghia; Tran, Anh Tu; La, Ngoc Quang; Tran, My Phuc; Vinh, Chau; Nguyen, Cong Khanh; Dang, Duc Anh; Tran, Nhu Duong; Thwaites, Guy; van Doorn, H Rogier; Choisy, Marc",Clin Infect Dis,,372

Case Report Case 1: A 69-year-old male was admitted for hypoxia and altered mental status. He was diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia by abnormal CT findings and positive PCR result. After receiving a course of dexamethasone, convalescent plasma, remdesivir and broad-spectrum antibiotics, he remained to be profoundly hypoxic, requiring non-invasive ventilation. Following two negative PCR results, he underwent bilateral lung transplantation on day 57. He was discharged to rehab unit on postoperative day 26. No desaturation was observed with the 6-min walk test on 30-day follow-up. Case 2: A 63-year-old male was presented with cough, and dyspnea. He was hemodynamically stable, SpO2 was 94%, chest x-ray was normal and tested positive for COVID-19. He was discharged home with dexamethasone and bronchodilators. However, he presented back on day 6 with worsening dyspnea. He was admitted and received a course of dexamethasone, remdesivir, convalescent plasma and broad-spectrum antibiotics. Due to persistent hypoxic respiratory failure, the patient underwent bilateral orthotopic lung transplantation on day 68. His postoperative course was complicated by primary graft dysfunction stage 3 and required open tracheostomy. His condition gradually improved and decannulated.

Therefore, the aim of this systematic review was to identify and explore research which has defined and enumerated public health workforces. In particular, how were such workforces defined? Who was included in these workforces? And how did researchers make judgments about the size of a workforce? In this systematic review, we identified 82 publications which enumerated a public health workforce between 2000 and November 2018. Most workforce definitions were unique and study-specific and included workers based on their occupation or their place of work. Common occupations included public health nurses and physicians, epidemiologists, and community health workers. National workforces varied by size, with the United States and Switzerland having the largest public health workforces per-capita, although definitions used varied substantially. Normative assessments (e.g., assessments of ideal workforce size) were informed through opinion, benchmarks or “service-target” models. There are very few regular, consistent enumerations within countries, and fewer still which capture a substantial proportion of the public heath workforce. Assessing the size of the public health workforce is often overlooked and would be aided by fit-for-purpose data, alignment of occupations and functions to international standards, and transparency in normative methods.","Watts, Rory D.; Bowles, Devin C.; Ryan, Eli; Fisher, Colleen; Li, Ian W.",Front Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33330331/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2020.588092,372
592387,"The Isolation, Pathogenesis, Diagnosis, Transmission, and Control of Avian Bornavirus and Proventricular Dilatation Disease",2010-08-02,"Rationale: Many viral infections are known to activate the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway. However, the role of p38 activation in viral infection and the underlying mechanism remain unclear. The role of virus-hijacked p38 MAPK activation in viral infection was investigated in this study. Methods: The correlation of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and p38 activation was studied in patient tissues and primary human hepatocytes (PHHs) by immunohistochemistry and western blotting. Coimmunoprecipitation, GST pulldown and confocal microscopy were used to investigate the interaction of p38α and the HCV core protein. In vitro kinase assays and mass spectrometry were used to analyze the phosphorylation of the HCV core protein. Plaque assays, quantitative real time PCR (qRT-PCR), western blotting, siRNA and CRISPR/Cas9 were used to determine the effect of p38 activation on viral replication. Results: HCV infection was associated with p38 activation in clinical samples. HCV infection increased p38 phosphorylation by triggering the interaction of p38α and TGF-β activated kinase 1 (MAP3K7) binding protein 1 (TAB1). TAB1-mediated p38α activation facilitated HCV replication, and pharmaceutical inhibition of p38α activation by SB203580 suppressed HCV infection at the viral assembly step. Activated p38α interacted with the N-terminal region of the HCV core protein and subsequently phosphorylated the HCV core protein, which promoted HCV core protein oligomerization, an essential step for viral assembly. As expected, SB203580 or the HCV core protein N-terminal peptide (CN-peptide) disrupted the p38α-HCV core protein interaction, efficiently impaired HCV assembly and impeded normal HCV replication in both cultured cells and primary human hepatocytes. Similarly, severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus (SFTSV), herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) or severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection also activated p38 MAPK. Most importantly, pharmacological blockage of p38 activation by SB203580 effectively inhibited SFTSV, HSV-1 and SARS-CoV-2. Conclusion: Our study shows that virus-hijacked p38 activation is a key event for viral replication and that pharmacological blockage of p38 activation is an antiviral strategy.","Cheng, Yuting; Sun, Fang; Wang, Luyao; Gao, Minjun; Xie, Youli; Sun, Yu; Liu, Huan; Yuan, Yufeng; Yi, Wei; Huang, Zan; Yan, Huan; Peng, Ke; Wu, Yingliang; Cao, Zhijian",Theranostics,https://doi.org/10.7150/thno.50992; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33204339/,372
592417,Selected Emerging Diseases in Ferrets,2013-03-17,"Image classification is getting more attention in the area of computer vision. During the past few years, a lot of research has been done on image classification using classical machine learning and deep learning techniques. Presently, deep learning-based techniques have given stupendous results. The performance of a classification system depends on the quality of features extracted from an image. The better is the quality of extracted features, the more the accuracy will be. Although, numerous deep learning-based methods have shown enormous performance in image classification, still due to various challenges deep learning methods are not able to extract all the important information from the image. This results in a reduction in overall classification accuracy. The goal of the present research is to improve the image classification performance by combining the deep features extracted using popular deep convolutional neural network, VGG19, and various handcrafted feature extraction methods, i.e., SIFT, SURF, ORB, and Shi-Tomasi corner detector algorithm. Further, the extracted features from these methods are classified using various machine learning classification methods, i.e., Gaussian Naïve Bayes, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBClassifier) classifier. The experiment is carried out on a benchmark dataset Caltech-101. The experimental results indicate that Random Forest using the combined features give 93.73% accuracy and outperforms other classifiers and methods proposed by other authors. The paper concludes that a single feature extractor whether shallow or deep is not enough to achieve satisfactory results. So, a combined approach using deep learning features and traditional handcrafted features is better for image classification.","Bansal, Monika; Kumar, Munish; Sachdeva, Monika; Mittal, Ajay",J Ambient Intell Humaniz Comput,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34548886/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s12652-021-03488-z,372
594900,Validity of the Handheld Expiratory Flowmeter for COPD Screening in the Primary Care Setting of China,2021-07-08,"BACKGROUND: The national comprehensive cancer network defines adequate lymphadenectomy as evaluation of ≥ 15 lymph nodes in esophageal cancer. However, varying thresholds have been suggested following neoadjuvant therapy. OBJECTIVES: Our objectives were to (1) explore trends in adequate lymphadenectomy rates over time; (2) evaluate unadjusted lymphadenectomy yield by treatment characteristics; and (3) identify independent factors associated with adequate lymphadenectomy. METHODS: The National Cancer Data Base was used to identify patients who underwent esophagectomy for cancer from 2004 to 2015. Adequate lymphadenectomy trends over time were evaluated using the Cochrane–Armitage test, and lymph node yield by treatment approach was compared using the Mann–Whitney U and Kruskal–Wallis tests. Associations with treatment factors were assessed by multivariable logistic regression. RESULTS: Among 24,413 patients, 9919 (40.6%) had adequate lymphadenectomy. Meeting the nodal threshold increased over time (52.6% in 2015 vs. 26.0% in 2004; p < 0.01). Lymph node yield did not differ based on neoadjuvant therapy (median 12 [interquartile range 7–19] with and without neoadjuvant therapy; p = 0.44). Adequate lymphadenectomy was not associated with neoadjuvant therapy (40.5% vs. 40.8%, odds ratio [OR] 0.94, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.82–1.07), but was associated with surgical approach (52.7% of laparoscopic cases, OR 1.28, 95% CI 1.06–1.56; 61.2% of robotic cases, OR 1.71, 95% CI 1.34–2.19, vs. 43.5% of open cases), and increasing annual esophagectomy volume (55.6% in the fourth quartile vs. 32.6% in the first quartile; OR 3.57, 95% CI 2.35–5.43). CONCLUSIONS: Despite increases over time, only 50% of patients undergo adequate lymphadenectomy during esophageal cancer resection. Adequate lymphadenectomy was not associated with neoadjuvant therapy. Focusing on surgical approach and esophagectomy volume may further improve adequate lymphadenectomy rates.","Schlick, Cary Jo R.; Khorfan, Rhami; Odell, David D.; Merkow, Ryan P.; Bentrem, David J.",Ann Surg Oncol,https://doi.org/10.1245/s10434-020-08578-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32519142/,372

METHODS: The complete lockdown lasted 6 weeks (from March 16 to April 26, 2020), after which the hospital in Bludenz started day surgery again and in Feldkirch the capacity was slowly increased. We compared how oncological and acute operations differed during those 6 weeks to the 6 weeks before lockdown. RESULTS: Our findings show a clear increase in emergency operations for acute cholecystitis (+133%) and acute appendicitis (+157%). While the acute operations increased, some oncological operations decreased, which was especially apparent for oncological colorectal resections (−66%) and oncological lung resections (−43%). CONCLUSION: This survey shows that due to the increased catchment area, more acute operations were performed and also demonstrated that we were confronted with more advanced stages of those diseases. Furthermore, cancer operations which rely on short-term peripheral diagnostics decreased considerably.","Lechner, Daniel; Tschann, Peter; Girotti, Paolo C.

METHODS: We draw eight lessons from the first 8 months of the pandemic, describing how COVID-19 has intensified pre-existing gaps in the MCH support network and created new problems. For each lesson identified, we present supporting evidence and a call for specific actions that can be taken by MCH practitioners, researchers and advocates. RESULTS: LESSON #1: COVID-19 hits communities of color hardest, exposing and exacerbating health inequities caused by systemic racism. LESSON #2: Women experience the most devastating social, economic and mental health tolls during COVID-19. LESSON #3: Virulent pathogens find and exacerbate cracks in our public health and health care systems. LESSON #4: COVID-19 has become a pretext to limit access to sexual and reproductive health care. LESSON #5: COVID-19 has exposed and deepened fault lines in maternity care: over-medicalization, discrimination, lack of workforce diversity, underutilization of collaborative team approaches, and lack of post-delivery follow-up. LESSON #6: The pandemic adds impetus to much-needed Medicaid policy reforms that can have a lasting positive effect on maternal health. LESSON #7: Social and health policy changes, heretofore deemed infeasible, ARE possible under pandemic threat. LESSON #8: Finally, an overarching COVID-19 lesson: We are all inextricably connected.

602541,Gut Brain Axis and Its Microbiota Regulation in Mammals and Birds,2017-11-13,"RATIONALE: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is affecting mental health profoundly. Previous studies have reported pandemic-related anxiety. Anxiety disorder and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are common comorbidities. However, there has been no report of any patient with undiagnosed ASD who developed anxiety disorders caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. In this case report, we describe an 8-year-old Japanese boy with undiagnosed ASD who developed COVID-19 phobia, resulting in avoidant restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID). PATIENT CONCERNS: As COVID-19 was highly publicized in the mass media and the risk of droplet infection was emphasized upon, the patient began to fear viral contamination from food, culminating in a refusal to eat or even swallow his saliva. He was admitted to a pediatric medical center in Osaka with life-threatening dehydration and was then referred to our child psychiatry department. DIAGNOSIS: We diagnosed the patient with COVID-19 phobia resulting in ARFID. We identified ASD traits from his present social communication skills and developmental history. INTERVENTIONS: We provided psychoeducation of ASD for the parents and administered supportive psychotherapy. OUTCOMES: Shortly after our intervention to relieve his ASD-related anxiety, his dysphagia improved. LESSONS: Our findings suggest that children with undiagnosed ASD may develop COVID-19 phobia. In these cases, intervention for ASD may be more appropriate than starting treatment for anxiety disorders as the first-line option. COVID-19 is the biggest pandemic in the recent past, and more undiagnosed ASD patients who develop COVID-19 phobia may seek treatment. Clinicians should consider the underlying ASD in these patients and assess their developmental history and present social communication skills.","Sakamoto, Shoko; Miyawaki, Dai; Goto, Ayako; Harima, Yuji; Tokuhara, Daisuke; Inoue, Koki",Medicine (Baltimore),https://doi.org/10.1097/md.0000000000026233; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34087907/,372

Methods: Pregnant women with COVID-19 delivering between March 18, 2020 and May 5, 2020 were identified. Placentas were examined and compared to historical controls and women with placental evaluation for a history of melanoma. Results: 16 placentas from patients with SARS-CoV-2 were examined (15 with live birth in the 3rd trimester 1 delivered in the 2nd trimester after intrauterine fetal demise). Compared to controls, third trimester placentas were significantly more likely to show at least one feature of maternal vascular malperfusion (MVM), including abnormal or injured maternal vessels, as well as delayed villous maturation, chorangiosis, and intervillous thrombi. Rates of acute and chronic inflammation were not increased. The placenta from the patient with intrauterine fetal demise showed villous edema and a retroplacental hematoma. Conclusions: Relative to controls, COVID-19 placentas show increased prevalence of features of maternal vascular malperfusion (MVM), a pattern of placental injury reflecting abnormalities in oxygenation within the intervillous space associated with adverse perinatal outcomes. Only 1 COVID-19 patient was hypertensive despite the association of MVM with hypertensive disorders and preeclampsia. These changes may reflect a systemic inflammatory or hypercoagulable state influencing placental physiology.","Shanes, E. D.; Mithal, L. B.; Otero, S.; Azad, H. A.; Miller, E. S.; Goldstein, J.

AIMS: This study aimed to investigate the feasibility and effect of an individualized exercise intervention and secondary, oral nutrition intake counseling on Timed-Up-and-Go (TUG) and 30 s Chair Stand Test (CST) as well as body-composition and EuroQol (EQ)-5D-5L, in patients with chronic intestinal failure (IF) type III receiving HPN and/or fluid therapy. METHODS: A 12-week individualized exercise intervention consisting on three weekly home based sessions, and nutrition counselling focusing on protein intake and reducing high stoma output, was performed. Weekly follow-up by phone was done on motivation to exercise. RESULTS: The study invited 71 patients, 44 accepted the invitation (62%), 37(52%) were included, and 31 (84%) completed the intervention. The exercise intervention was well tolerated. TUG improved from 8.9(SD 5.5) to 7.7(SD 3.8) (p = 0.033). CST improved by four repetitions (<0.001∗). A statistical, however not clinically relevant improvement was seen in muscle mass. No improvement was seen in (EQ)-5D-5L total, but insignificantly (p = 0.055) for physical function only. Protein intake improved by 10.6 g/day (p = 0.008). CONCLUSIONS: A 12 weeks individualized exercise intervention showed very feasible and beneficial in HPN patients. Physical function improved statistically and clinically, and oral protein intake improved. QoL overall did not improve, however COVID-19 was an uninvited partner throughout the study period, which may have influenced general QoL. As only 62% accepted the invitation to participate, home based exercise intervention may not apply to all patients.","Graungaard, Signe; Geisler, Lea; Andersen, Jens R; Rasmussen, Henrik Højgaard; Vinter-Jensen, Lars; Holst, Mette",Clin Nutr ESPEN,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34620349/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clnesp.2021.07.008,372

Biases inherent in random PCR-amplification, cross-hybridization effects, and inadequate microarray analysis, however, limit detection sensitivity and specificity. Here, we have studied the relationships between viral amplification efficiency, hybridization signal, and target-probe annealing specificity using a customized microarray platform. Novel features of this platform include the development of a robust algorithm that accurately predicts PCR bias during DNA amplification and can be used to improve PCR primer design, as well as a powerful statistical concept for inferring pathogen identity from probe recognition signatures. Compared to real-time PCR, the microarray platform identified pathogens with 94% accuracy (76% sensitivity and 100% specificity) in a panel of 36 patient specimens. Our findings show that microarrays can be used for the robust and accurate diagnosis of pathogens, and further substantiate the use of microarray technology in clinical diagnostics.","Wong, Christopher W; Heng, Charlie Lee Wah; Wan Yee, Leong; Soh, Shirlena WL; Kartasasmita, Cissy B; Simoes, Eric AF; Hibberd, Martin L; Sung, Wing-Kin; Miller, Lance D",Genome Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17531104/,372
620316,Examination of the effects of COVID 19 on corneal endothelium,2021-06-07,"Host proteases have been suggested to be crucial for dissemination of MERS, SARS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 coronaviruses, but the relative contribution of membrane versus intracellular proteases remains controversial. Transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) is regarded as one of the main proteases implicated in the coronavirus S protein priming, an important step for binding of the S protein to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor before cell entry. The main cellular location where the SARS-CoV-2 S protein priming occurs remains debatable, therefore hampering the development of targeted treatments. Herein, we identified the human extracellular serine protease inhibitor (serpin) alpha 1 antitrypsin (A1AT) as a novel TMPRSS2 inhibitor. Structural modeling revealed that A1AT docked to an extracellular domain of TMPRSS2 in a conformation that is suitable for catalysis, resembling similar serine protease-inhibitor complexes. Inhibitory activity of A1AT was established in a SARS-CoV-2 viral load system. Notably, plasma A1AT levels were associated with COVID-19 disease severity. Our data support the key role of extracellular serine proteases in SARS-CoV-2 infections and indicate that treatment with serpins, particularly the FDA-approved drug A1AT, may be effective in limiting SARS-CoV-2 dissemination by affecting the surface of the host cells.","Azouz, Nurit P.; Klingler, Andrea M.; Callahan, Victoria; Akhrymuk, Ivan V.; Elez, Katarina; Raich, Lluís; Henry, Brandon M.; Benoit, Justin L.; Benoit, Stefanie W.; Noé, Frank; Kehn-Hall, Kylene; Rothenberg, Marc E.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.04.077826; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33052338/,372

Individuals self-collected 300 μl saliva in vials containing Darnell Rockefeller University Laboratory (DRUL) buffer and extracted RNA was assayed by RT-PCR (the DRUL saliva assay). The limit of detection was confirmed to be 1 viral copy/μl in 20 of 20 replicate extractions. Viral RNA was stable in DRUL buffer at room temperature up to seven days after sample collection, and safety studies demonstrated that DRUL buffer immediately inactivated virus at concentrations up to 2.75x10(6) PFU/ml. Results from SARS-CoV-2 positive nasopharyngeal (NP) swab samples collected in viral transport media and assayed with a standard FDA Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) test were highly correlated with samples placed in DRUL buffer. Direct comparison of results from 162 individuals tested by FDA EUA oropharyngeal (OP) or NP swabs with co-collected saliva samples identified four otherwise unidentified positive cases in DRUL buffer.

It was found that the contaminant source located in a vorticity-dominated region was more likely to be “locked” in the vortex, resulting in higher 62% higher average concentration and 14% longer residual time than that when the source was on a deformation dominated location. The contaminant concentrations also differed between the front and rear parts of the cabin because of different airflow structures. Contaminant released close to the heated manikin face was likely to be transported backward according to its distribution mean position. Based on these results, the air flow patterns inside aircraft cabins can potentially be improved to better control the spread of airborne contaminant.","Li, Fei; Liu, Junjie; Ren, Jianlin; Cao, Xiaodong; Zhu, Yifang",Int J Heat Mass Transf,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijheatmasstransfer.2016.01.004; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0017931015303458; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0017931015303458; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32226103/,372

Material e metodos: As informacoes para este trabalho foram obtidas por meio da pesquisa de artigos e relatos de caso publicados no ano de 2020, utilizando a base de dados Medline e a busca pelo Google Academico. As palavras-chaves utilizadas foram: COVID-19;Anemia hemolitica. Foram selecionados para leitura completa os artigos que continham o tema anemia hemolitica e COVID-19 no titulo e/ou no resumo. As diferentes formas de anemia hemolitica descritas foram comparadas entre si de maneira descritiva. Resultados: O aparecimento de anemia hemolitica autoimune (AHAI) foi descrita em 10 pacientes com diagnostico de COVID-19, sendo cinco deles por anticorpos quentes e os outros cinco, por frios. As comorbidades previas mais frequentes foram hipertensao arterial e doenca renal cronica, alem de dois casos de linfoma da zona marginal (LZM), dois de leucemia linfocitica cronica (LLC) e dois de purpura trombocitopenica imune (PTI). Em outro estudo, indicios laboratoriais de anemia hemolitica foram avaliadas, retrospectivamente, em 38 pacientes internados por COVID-19, encontrando niveis elevados de hemoglobina plasmatica em 31 deles. Alem disso, o surgimento da Sindrome de Evans foi identificada em tres pacientes. A AHAI foi, em geral, tratada com corticoides e transfusoes sanguineas, e em casos de doenca por crioaglutinacoes, o rituximabe foi usado como terapia inicial e como opcao para os casos de falha terapeutica de corticoides. Discussao: Diversas complicacoes hematologicas foram descritas na doenca pelo Sars-Cov-2 (COVID-19), especialmente os disturbios de coagulacao e hemostasia e leucopenia. Contudo, poucos casos de anemias, especialmente as hemoliticas autoimunes, foram descritos. A etiologia da AHAI pode ser idiopatica ou secundaria a drogas, doencas, especialmente lupus, LLC, Linfomas nao-Hodgkin, e infeccoes, como Mycoplasma pneumoniae evirus Epstein-Barr. A partir de alguns casos de AHIA descritos em pacientes com COVID-19, levantou-se a hipotese de o virus Sars-cov-2 ser capaz de desencadea-la. Os casos encontrados falam sobre pacientes que desenvolveram AHIA, com diferentes comorbidades previas, mas todos com marcadores de inflamacao sistemica em altas concentracoes: DHL, D-dimero e PCR. Apesar de a AHAI poder ser atribuida a LLC e LZM, os demais pacientes nao tinham outras doencas previas ou infeccoes que justificassem o aparecimento de anemia hemolitica. Alem disso, sabe-se que a COVID-19 e uma doenca de inflamacao sistemica, ambiente propicio para o desenvolvimento de autoimunidade e hemolise. Conclusao: A associacao entre a COVID-19 e o surgimento de anemias hemoliticas esta sendo melhor documentada conforme avanca a pandemia. A presenca de anemia aguda e indicadores laboratoriais de hemolise em pacientes infectados pelo novo coronavirus reforca o acometimento sistemico da doenca e ressalta a importancia da multidisciplinaridade medica, incluindo a hematologia, no combate a pandemia da COVID-19.

637061,"Selected veterinary concerns of geriatric rats, mice, hamsters and gerbils",2020-04-22,"INTRODUCTION: The coronavirus disease (COVID‐19) pandemic has continued to have a devastating impact on health worldwide. There has been a rapid evolution of evidence, establishing an increased risk of morbidity and mortality associated with diabetes and concurrent COVID‐19. The objective of this review is to explore the current evidence for inpatient assessment and management of diabetes during the COVID‐19 pandemic and highlight areas requiring further exploration. METHODS: A literature search of databases was conducted to November 2020 using variations on keywords SARS‐CoV‐2, COVID‐19, SARS, MERS and diabetes. Information relating to the impact of diabetes on severity of COVID‐19 infection, the impact of COVID‐19 infection on diabetes management and diabetes‐related complications was integrated to create a narrative review. DISCUSSION: People with diabetes and COVID‐19 are at an increased risk of morbidity and mortality. It is important that people with both known and previously unrecognised diabetes and COVID‐19 be promptly identified and assessed during acute illness, with close monitoring for clinical deterioration or complications. People with diabetes may require titration or alteration of their glycaemic management due to the potential for worse outcomes with hyperglycaemia and COVID‐19 infection. Comprehensive discharge planning is vital to optimise ongoing glycaemic management. CONCLUSION: Further understanding of the risk of adverse outcomes and optimisation of glycaemic management for people with diabetes during COVID‐19 is required to improve outcomes. Increased glucose and ketone monitoring, substitution of insulin for some oral anti‐hyperglycaemic medications and careful monitoring for complications of diabetes such as diabetic ketoacidosis should be considered.","Fleming, Nicola; Sacks, Lori J.; Pham, Cecilia T.; Neoh, Sandra L.; Ekinci, Elif I.",Diabet Med,https://doi.org/10.1111/dme.14509; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33377213/,372

Clinicians reported challenges related to technology, confidence, and inadequate resources. OBJECTIVES: To document global telepractice, identify current obstacles and measure the impact of a possible solution. The timing of this research facilitated tracking telepractice changes during the pandemic. METHODS: Two surveys measured practitioners’ experience and attitude towards telepractice. Survey 1 was completed in February-March 2020. Participants then received two specialized lesson kits to trial if desired. Survey 2 was a follow-up after 4–6 weeks. RESULTS: Between surveys, the proportion of participants providing telepractice increased from 47.6% to 91.7%. The lesson kits were trialled by 74.3%. Their use had a positive impact on three of the top five factors affecting the delivery of telepractice: parent coaching, clinician experience and accessing resources.

The specialized resources were helpful in overcoming some of the barriers to delivery.","Claridge, Rebecca; Kroll, Nicholas",International journal of telerehabilitation,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34345339/; https://doi.org/10.5195/ijt.2021.6362,372
642154,Environmental Cleaning and Disinfection,2014-12-30,"BACKGROUND: Adenoviral vectors emerged as important platforms for cancer immunotherapy. Vaccination with adenoviral vectors is promising in this respect, however, their specific mechanisms of action are not fully understood. Here, we assessed the development and maintenance of vaccine-induced tumor-specific CD8(+) T cells elicited upon immunization with adenoviral vectors. METHODS: Adenoviral vaccine vectors encoding the full-length E7 protein from human papilloma virus (HPV) or the immunodominant epitope from E7 were generated, and mice were immunized intravenously with different quantities (10(7), 10(8) or 10(9) infectious units). The magnitude, kinetics and tumor protection capacity of the induced vaccine-specific T cell responses were evaluated. RESULTS: The adenoviral vaccines elicited inflationary E7-specific memory CD8(+) T cell responses in a dose-dependent manner. The magnitude of these vaccine-specific CD8(+) T cells in the circulation related to the development of E7-specific CD8(+) tissue-resident memory T (T(RM)) cells, which were maintained for months in multiple tissues after vaccination. The vaccine-specific CD8(+) T cell responses conferred long-term protection against HPV-induced carcinomas in the skin and liver, and this protection required the induction and accumulation of CD8(+) T(RM) cells. Moreover, the formation of CD8(+) T(RM) cells could be enhanced by temporal targeting CD80/CD86 costimulatory interactions via CTLA-4 blockade early after immunization. CONCLUSIONS: Together, these data show that adenoviral vector-induced CD8(+) T cell inflation promotes protective T(RM) cell populations, and this can be enhanced by targeting CTLA-4.","van der Gracht, Esmé TI; Schoonderwoerd, Mark JA; van Duikeren, Suzanne; Yilmaz, Ayse N; Behr, Felix M; Colston, Julia M; Lee, Lian N; Yagita, Hideo; van Gisbergen, Klaas PJM; Hawinkels, Lukas JAC; Koning, Frits; Klenerman, Paul; Arens, Ramon",J Immunother Cancer,https://doi.org/10.1136/jitc-2020-001133; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33293355/,372
642781,Guidance for anti-VEGF intravitreal injections during the COVID-19 pandemic,2020-04-23,"TOPIC: Chest Infections TYPE: Medical Student/Resident Case Reports INTRODUCTION: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus, has emerged as a leading cause of death globally. The most reported initial symptoms are cough, fever, dyspnea, and fatigue. Hemoptysis is atypical in COVID-19. We report cases of COVID-19 pneumonia presenting with hemoptysis in two unrelated men. CASE PRESENTATION: Patient-I was a 60-year-old nonsmoker with no known comorbidities that tested positive for COVID-19 three days earlier. He presented with 10-day history of fever and cough with blood-streaked sputum that progressed to coughing frank blood. He was febrile (103.0°F) and saturating at 95% inspiring ambient air. Chest examination revealed crackles at the right lower lung field. Laboratory evaluation noted normal platelet count, elevated D-dimer (445 ng/mL) and elevated C-reactive protein (17.2 mg/dL). Chest x-ray showed patchy opacification at the right mid and lower lung zones. He was treated conservatively. The hemoptysis resolved by day 2 and he was discharged on day 5.Patient-II, a 56-year-old former smoker with hypertension and diabetes, was diagnosed with COVID-19 twelve days earlier and developed acute hypoxic respiratory failure requiring a 5-day hospitalization at a different hospital. He presented with 2-day history of worsening shortness of breath and cough with bloody sputum. He was afebrile (98.9°F) and saturating at 67% inspiring ambient air. Chest examination revealed bilateral crackles. Laboratory evaluation noted normal platelet count, elevated D-dimer (5,876 ng/mL) and elevated C-reactive protein (21.7 mg/dL). Chest x-ray showed patchy opacification in the mid and lower lung zones bilaterally. He was treated with high-flow oxygen, Tocilizumab, Remdesivir and Dexamethasone. The hemoptysis resolved by day 2. On day 14, he was discharged on 3 L/min of supplemental oxygen.In both patients, chest CT angiography showed no evidence of acute pulmonary embolism. DISCUSSION: The pathogenesis of hemoptysis in COVID-19 is attributed to pulmonary embolism and/or alveolar destruction – the former being more common. Only 1–5 % of COVID-19 patients on hospital admission develop hemoptysis, with incidence as high as 13% in COVID-19 patients with concurrent pulmonary emboli. SARS-CoV-2 induces a pro-inflammatory and hypercoagulable state, thus increasing risk of thromboembolic events. Both of our patients had elevated D-dimer levels, but imaging showed no evidence of pulmonary emboli, thus suggesting alveolar destruction as the more likely cause of hemoptysis. Studies indicate that presentation with hemoptysis in COVID-19 patients increases the odds of severe illness 1.8-4.0 times. Host factors, such as presence and absence of comorbidities, likely played a significant role in determining disease severity/outcome for these patients. CONCLUSIONS: These cases highlight the relevance of recognizing hemoptysis as part of the clinical symptomology of COVID-19 pneumonia. REFERENCE #1: Peys E, Stevens D, Weygaerde YV, et al.

645720,Care of the Geriatric Rabbit,2010-02-11,"The many variations on a graphic illustrating the impact of non-pharmaceutical measures to mitigate pandemic influenza that have appeared in recent news reports about COVID-19 suggest a need to better explain the mechanism by which social distancing reduces the spread of infectious diseases. And some reports understate one benefit of reducing the frequency or proximity of interpersonal encounters, a reduction in the total number of infections. In hopes that understanding will increase compliance, we describe how social distancing a) reduces the peak incidence of infections, b) delays the occurrence of this peak, and c) reduces the total number of infections during epidemics. In view of the extraordinary efforts underway to identify existing medications that are active against SARS-CoV-2 and to develop new antiviral drugs, vaccines and antibody therapies, any of which may have community-level effects, we also describe how pharmaceutical interventions affect transmission.","Feng, Zhilan; Glasser, John W.; Hill, Andrew N.",Math Biosci,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0025556420300729?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0025556420300729; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mbs.2020.108389; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32473161/,372

METHODS: Consecutive patients with diagnosis of neovascular AMD were consecutively enrolled between March 9, 2020, and June 12, 2020, (during and immediately after the Italian COVID-19 quarantine). During the inclusion (or pandemic) visit (V(0)), patients received a complete ophthalmologic evaluation, including optical coherence tomography (OCT). Best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and OCT findings from the two preceding visits (V(−1) and V(−2)) were compared with data at V(0). RESULTS: One-hundred patients (112 eyes) were enrolled in this study. The time interval between following visits was 110.7 ± 37.5 days within V(0) and V(−1) and 80.8 ± 39.7 days within V(−1) and V(−2), respectively (P < 0.0001). BCVA was statistically worse at the V(0) visit as compared with the immediately preceding (V(−1)) visit (0.50 ± 0.43 LogMAR and 0.45 ± 0.38 LogMAR at the V(0) and V(−1) visits, respectively; P = 0.046). On structural OCT, 91 out of 112 (81.2%) neovascular AMD eyes displayed the evidence of exudative disease activity at the V(0) visit, while 77 (68.7%) eyes exhibited signs of exudation at the V(−1) visit (P = 0.022). No differences in terms of BCVA and OCT findings were detected between the V(−1) and V(−2) visits. In multiple regression analysis, the difference in BCVA between V(0) and V(−1) visits was significantly associated with the interval time within these two visits (P = 0.026). CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic-related postponement in patient care proved to be significantly associated with worse short-term outcomes in these patients.

There is evidence of worldwide distribution of such devices, but some experts have warned of possible negative impacts of their use. The objective of this study was to measure the effect of an aerosol box on intubation performance across a variety of simulated difficult airway scenarios in the emergency department. METHODS: This was a randomized, crossover design study. Participants were randomized to intubate one of five airway scenarios with and without an aerosol box in place, with randomization of intubation sequence. The primary outcome was time to intubation. Secondary outcomes included number of intubation attempts, Cormack-Lehane view, percent of glottic opening, and resident physician perception of intubation difficulty. RESULTS: Forty-eight residents performed 96 intubations. Time to intubation was significantly longer with box use than without (mean 17 seconds [range 6–68 seconds] vs mean 10 seconds [range 5–40 seconds], p <0.001). Participants perceived intubation as being significantly more difficult with the aerosol box. There were no significant differences in the number of attempts or quality of view obtained. CONCLUSION: Use of an aerosol box during difficult endotracheal intubation increases the time to intubation and perceived difficulty across a range of simulated ED patients.","Turner, Joseph S.; Falvo, Lauren E.; Ahmed, Rami A.; Ellender, Timothy J.; Corson-Knowles, Dan; Bona, Anna M.; Sarmiento, Elisa J.; Cooper, Dylan D.",West J Emerg Med,https://doi.org/10.5811/westjem.2020.8.48901; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33052809/,372

651211,Possible prophylactic or preventive role of topical povidone iodine during accidental ocular exposure to 2019-nCoV,2020-05-20,"Background: The majority of U.S. reports of COVID-19 clinical characteristics, disease course, and treatments are from single health systems or focused on one domain. Here we report the creation of the National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C), a centralized, harmonized, high-granularity electronic health record repository that is the largest, most representative U.S. cohort of COVID-19 cases and controls to date. This multi-center dataset supports robust evidence-based development of predictive and diagnostic tools and informs critical care and policy. Methods and Findings: In a retrospective cohort study of 1,926,526 patients from 34 medical centers nationwide, we stratified patients using a World Health Organization COVID-19 severity scale and demographics; we then evaluated differences between groups over time using multivariable logistic regression. We established vital signs and laboratory values among COVID-19 patients with different severities, providing the foundation for predictive analytics. The cohort included 174,568 adults with severe acute respiratory syndrome associated with SARS-CoV-2 (PCR >99% or antigen <1%) as well as 1,133,848 adult patients that served as lab-negative controls. Among 32,472 hospitalized patients, mortality was 11.6% overall and decreased from 16.4% in March/April 2020 to 8.6% in September/October 2020 (p = 0.002 monthly trend). In a multivariable logistic regression model, age, male sex, liver disease, dementia, African-American and Asian race, and obesity were independently associated with higher clinical severity. To demonstrate the utility of the N3C cohort for analytics, we used machine learning to predict clinical severity and risk factors over time. Using 64 inputs available on the first hospital day, we predicted a severe clinical course (death, discharge to hospice, invasive ventilation, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation) using random forest and XGBoost models (AUROC 0.86 and 0.87 respectively) that were stable over time. The most powerful predictors in these models are patient age and widely available vital sign and laboratory values. The established expected trajectories for many vital signs and laboratory values among patients with different clinical severities validates observations from smaller studies, and provides comprehensive insight into COVID-19 characterization in U.S. patients. Conclusions: This is the first description of an ongoing longitudinal observational study of patients seen in diverse clinical settings and geographical regions and is the largest COVID-19 cohort in the United States. Such data are the foundation for machine learning (ML) models that can be the basis for generalizable clinical decision support tools. The N3C Data Enclave is unique in providing transparent, reproducible, easily shared, versioned, and fully auditable data and analytic provenance for national-scale patient-level EHR data. The N3C is built for intensive ML analyses by academic, industry, and citizen scientists internationally. Many observational correlations can inform trial designs and care guidelines for this new disease.","Bennett, T. D.; Moffitt, R. A.; Hajagos, J. G.; Amor, B.; Anand, A.; Bissell, M. M.; Bradwell, K.

The underlying mechanism remains unclear. METHODS: Immunohistochemical and flow cytometric analyses were used to compare the apoptotic rate of T cells from COVID-19 adults and children and apoptotic responses of adult and child T cells to COVID-19 pooled plasma. Biological properties of caspases and reactive oxygen species were assessed in T cells treated by COVID-19 pooled plasma. RESULTS: Mitochondria apoptosis of peripheral T cells were identified in COVID-19 adult patient samples, but not in the children. Furthermore, increased TNF-α and IL-6 in COVID-19 plasma induced mitochondria apoptosis and caused DNA damage by elevating reactive oxygen species levels of the adult T cells. However, the child T cells showed tolerance to mitochondrial apoptosis due to mitochondria autophagy. Activation of autophagy could decrease apoptotic sensitivity of the adult T cells to plasma from COVID-19 patients. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicated that the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway was activated in T cells of COVID-19 adult patients specifically, which may shed light on the pathophysiological difference between adults and children infected with SARS-CoV-2.","Yang, Yang; Liangjian, Kuang; Li, Linhai; Yongjian, Wu; Zhong, Bei; Huang, Xi",J. infect. dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34374752/; https://doi.org/10.1093/infdis/jiab400,372

Pyridoxylidenephloroglucinol is synthesized by Knoevenagel condensation of the vitamin B6 aldehyde pyridoxal with phloroglucinol. Pyridoxylidenephloroglucinol rearranges to light-yellow (4′RS)-1′,4′-dihydrobananin by refluxing in 5M hydrochloric acid. Air oxidation subsequently forms BN in the heat which immediately yields orange-yellow (4′RS)-4′-chloro-1′,4′-dihydrobananin by 1,4-addition of hydrogen chloride. This intermediate could be isolated but, interestingly, not a BN hydrochloride. Brown BN is finally achieved by base-catalyzed elimination of hydrogen chloride from (4′RS)-4′-chloro-1′,4′-dihydrobananin. Regarding possible biological activities, it was demonstrated that BN acts as zinc (Zn2+) chelator. Therefore, a target of interest could be the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) zinc finger HIV-1 RNA-binding nucleocapsid protein p7 (NCp7). Through suggested zinc ejection from HIV-1 genomic RNA ψ-element-binding and HIV-1–RNA-duplex packaging NCp7 by BN, thus rendering NCp7 functionally obsolete, it is deduced that HIV-1 replication and effective infectious virion encapsidation could be inhibited by BN. Furthermore, theoretical and structural considerations propose that BN is converted into bananin 5′-monophosphate (BNP) by the cell type-ubiquitous human enzyme pyridoxal kinase (EC 2.7.1.35). Together with the putative antilentiviral retinoid vitamin A–vitamin B6 conjugate analogue B6RA (Kesel, A. J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 2003, 300, 793), BNP is postulated to serve as effector in a system of protein target sequences RX(D/E) of RNA virus components. Human immunodeficiency Retroviridae (HIVs) could possibly be influenced by B6RA and BNP. In addition, candidate targets of B6RA and BNP could be adsorption, transcription and/or viral RNA replication of an interestingly wide RNA virus selection including Picornaviridae (poliovirus, human coxsackievirus, hepatitis A virus), Flaviviridae (yellow fever virus, Dengue virus, West Nile virus, Kunjin virus, St. Louis encephalitis virus, hepatitis C virus), Togaviridae (rubella virus), Coronaviridae (human coronavirus, human SARS-associated coronavirus), Rhabdoviridae (rabies virus), Paramyxoviridae (human parainfluenza virus, measles virus, human respiratory syncytial virus), Filoviridae (Marburg virus, Ebola virus), Bornaviridae (Borna disease virus), Bunyaviridae (Hantaan virus), Arenaviridae (Lassa virus), and Reoviridae (human rotavirus). The postulated scope of ‘metabolically trapped’ BNP might resemble the antiviral spectrum of the RNA-viral virustatic ribavirin.","Kesel, Andreas J",Bioorganic & Medicinal Chemistry,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14527557/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0968089603005005; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0968089603005005,372

Background: The aim is to provide a brief overview to facilitate a rapid comprehensive and practical approach to these new trends to promote research, interventions, education, and prevention. Methods: The rapid review includes an analysis of both health and education technologies studies on Internet use-related addiction problems included in the Special Issue “Internet and Smartphone Use-Related Addiction Health Problems: Treatment, Education and Research” to extract recent findings and a few reflections about the development of the field before and during the first wave of the COVID-19. Results: Main findings highlighted studies which tended to be empirical, with a relational type associating specific addictive problems with individual and a few contextual factors in adult populations. Psychometric studies about scales are prevalent, but predictive and mixed methods ones are starting to emerge, together with reviews about conceptualisation, measure, treatment, and prevention. Conclusions: From the arrival of Internet, our societies have converged in a global culture which has impacted health and educational domains. Internet use-related addiction problems have globally emerged and common knowledge, advances, and strategies exist to overcome challenges which are starting to be tested, and prevention interest has arisen in a pandemic situation with global health problems holistically tackled.","Lopez-Fernandez, Olatz",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33406806/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18010321,372

664950,Emergency Medicine of the Ferret,2007-06-15,"Introduction Several antigen tests for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have been developed worldwide, but their clinical utility has not been well established. In this study, we evaluated the analytical and clinical performance of QuickNavi-COVID19 Ag, a newly developed antigen test in Japan. Methods This prospective observational study was conducted at a PCR center between October 7 and December 5, 2020. The included patients were referred from a local public health center and 89 primary care facilities. We simultaneously obtained two nasopharyngeal samples with flocked swabs; one was used for the antigen test and the other for real-time reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR). Using the results of real-time RT-PCR as a reference, the performance of the antigen test was evaluated. Results A total of 1186 patients were included in this study, and the real-time RT-PCR detected SARS-CoV-2 in 105 (8.9%). Of these 105 patients, 33 (31.4%) were asymptomatic. The antigen test provided a 98.8% (95% confident interval [CI]: 98.0%-99.4%) concordance rate with real-time RT-PCR, along with a sensitivity of 86.7% (95% CI: 78.6%-92.5%) and a specificity of 100% (95% CI: 99.7%-100%). False-negatives were observed in 14 patients, 8 of whom were asymptomatic and had a low viral load (cycle threshold (Ct) >30). In symptomatic patients, the sensitivity was 91.7% (95% CI: 82.7%-96.9%). Conclusion QuickNavi-COVID19 Ag showed high specificity and sufficient sensitivity for the detection of SARS-CoV-2. This test is a promising potential diagnostic modality when access to molecular examinations is limited.","Takeuchi, Y.; Akashi, Y.; Kato, D.; Kuwahara, M.; Muramatsu, S.; Ueda, A.; Notake, S.; Nakamura, K.; Ishikawa, H.; Suzuki, H.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.27.20248876v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.12.27.20248876,372

680717,Ferret care and husbandry,2005-03-01,"Positioning patients in the prone position leads to reduced hospital mortality rates for those with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). What constitutes the optimal feeding strategy for prone patients with ARDS is controversial. We conducted a retrospective study that enrolled 110 prone patients with ARDS in two medical intensive care units (ICUs) from September 2015 to November 2018. Inclusion criteria were as follows: age ≥20 years, diagnosis of respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation, diagnosis of ARDS within 72 h of ICU admission, placement in a prone position within the first 7 days of ICU admission, and ICU stay of more than 7 days. Exclusion criteria were as follows: nil per os orders because of gastrointestinal bleeding or hemodynamic instability, and ventilator dependency because of chronic respiratory failure. The consecutive daily enteral nutrition(EN)/EN + parenteral nutrition(PN) ratio could predict hospital mortality rates within the first 7 days of admission when using generalized estimating equations (p = 0.013). A higher average EN/EN + PN ratio within the first 7 days predicted (hazard ratio: 0.97, confidence interval: 0.96–0.99) lower hospital mortality rates. To reduce hospital mortality rates, caloric intake with a higher EN ratio may be considered for patients in prone positions with ARDS.","Fu, Pin-Kuei; Chao, Wen-Cheng; Hsu, Chiann-Yi; Wang, Chih-Hung; Wang, Chen-Yu",Nutrients,https://doi.org/10.3390/nu13093259; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34579135/,372

Thirteen healthcare workers from Italian and Austrian hospitals specifically dealing with COVID-19 patients during the first phase of the pandemic were interviewed. Data was analysed using grounded theory methodology. Psychosocial effects on stress experience, stressors and resilience factors were identified. We generated three hypotheses. Hypothesis one is that moral distress and moral injury are main stressors experienced by healthcare workers. Hypothesis two states that organisational resilience plays an important part in how healthcare workers experience the crisis. Organisational justice and decentralized decision making are essential elements of staff wellbeing. Hypothesis three refers to effective psychosocial support: Basic on scene psychosocial support based on the Hobfoll principles given by trusted and well-known mental health professionals and peers in an integrated approach works best during the pandemic.","Kreh, Alexander; Brancaleoni, Rachele; Magalini, Sabina Chiara; Chieffo, Daniela Pia Rosaria; Flad, Barbara; Ellebrecht, Nils; Juen, Barbara",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.11.18.20232272; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.11.18.20232272v1?rss=1,372
683044,Letter to the editor: Keeping an eye on the many symptoms of COVID-19,2021-03-11,"The study aimed to examine for the first time the spectra of viral and bacterial pathogens along with the antibiotic susceptibility of the isolated bacteria in under-5 children with acute respiratory infections (ARIs) in hospital settings of Dhaka, Bangladesh. Nasal swabs were collected from 200 under-five children hospitalized with clinical signs of ARIs. Nasal swabs from 30 asymptomatic children were also collected. Screening of viral pathogens targeted ten respiratory viruses using RT-qPCR. Bacterial pathogens were identified by bacteriological culture methods and antimicrobial susceptibility of the isolates was determined following CLSI guidelines. About 82.5% (n = 165) of specimens were positive for pathogens. Of 165 infected cases, 3% (n = 6) had only single bacterial pathogens, whereas 43.5% (n = 87) cases had only single viral pathogens. The remaining 36% (n = 72) cases had coinfections. In symptomatic cases, human rhinovirus was detected as the predominant virus (31.5%), followed by RSV (31%), HMPV (13%), HBoV (11%), HPIV-3 (10.5%), and adenovirus (7%). Streptococcus pneumoniae was the most frequently isolated bacterial pathogen (9%), whereas Klebsiella pneumaniae, Streptococcus spp., Enterobacter agglomerans, and Haemophilus influenzae were 5.5%, 5%, 2%, and 1.5%, respectively. Of 15 multidrug-resistant bacteria, a Klebsiella pneumoniae isolate and an Enterobacter agglomerans isolate exhibited resistance against more than 10 different antibiotics. Both ARI incidence and predominant pathogen detection rates were higher during post-monsoon and winter, peaking in September. Pathogen detection rates and coinfection incidence in less than 1-year group were significantly higher (P = 0.0034 and 0.049, respectively) than in 1–5 years age group. Pathogen detection rate (43%) in asymptomatic cases was significantly lower compared to symptomatic group (P<0.0001). Human rhinovirus, HPIV-3, adenovirus, Streptococcus pneumonia, and Klebsiella pneumaniae had significant involvement in coinfections with P values of 0.0001, 0.009 and 0.0001, 0.0001 and 0.001 respectively. Further investigations are required to better understand the clinical roles of the isolated pathogens and their seasonality.","Bhuyan, Golam Sarower; Hossain, Mohammad Amir; Sarker, Suprovath Kumar; Rahat, Asifuzzaman; Islam, Md Tarikul; Haque, Tanjina Noor; Begum, Noorjahan; Qadri, Syeda Kashfi; Muraduzzaman, A.
