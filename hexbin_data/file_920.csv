218573,Acknowledging Systemic Discrimination in the Context of a Pandemic: Advancing an Anti-Racist and Anti-Ageist Movement,2021,"Therapeutic plans (TPs) were introduced in Italy in 2004 in order to ensure the continuity in the prescription of new drugs between specialist physicians and general practitioners (GPs). Over the years this prescription tool was updated several times: starting from a paper form without any template (""paper TP"") to a template defined by AIFA to collect specific clinical information, up to a web-based form to collect all information into a database. Over time-critical issues concerning its usefulness have been raised, especially when AIFA established several extensions for TP validity to ensure the social distancing required by the covid-19 pandemic. Therefore, after several years from their establishment, pending adoption of necessary implementing of Ministerial Decree of 25th March 2020, a check of the actual impact of TPs is required, in order to plan their review. This study provide a detailed overview of all TPs active in Italy at the 11th May 2020. From Farmadati database, all drugs reimbursed by the National Health Service (class A drugs) and requiring TP were selected. The consumption of these drugs has been derived from OsMed Reports that make available data of medicines consumption and expenditure in the general population in Italy. The analysis showed that TP is required for the prescription of 935 medicinal products (9.6% of class-A drugs) and 147 different active substances (belonging to 34 different Therapeutic Groups and 66 subgroups). Out of these, 67 (46%) required a paper TP without any template, 72 (49%) a paper TP on AIFA template, and 8 (5%) a web-based TP. The Therapeutic Group with the largest number of active ingredients with TP were antidiabetics (19.7%), followed by immunomodulating and immunosuppressants (9.5%) and medications for asthma and COPD (6.8%). Consumption analysis of drugs with TP showed that this prescription tool covers 943,899,598 DDD per year, equal to 2,586,026 DDD/day. This means that TPs have a very high impact in terms of the prevalence of patients treated on the entire care process. Of all annual DDDs prescribed on TP, 46.8% concerned drugs with TP on template AIFA, 34.5% drugs with web-based TP, while the remaining 18.7% drugs with paper TP without a template. This analysis may provide the basis for an analytical case-by-case review of TP maintenance needs, trying to maximize the benefits of this tool and to reduce its possible adverse effects. This review could be helpful to ensure the appropriateness in the drug uses, to enhance the role of general medicine, and to simplify the pathways of millions of patients ensuring the continuity of their care.","Piccinni, Carlo; Addesi, Alice; Pedrini, Antonella; Esposito, Immacolata; Rampazzo, Roberta; Mezzalira, Luigi; Trentin, Luca; Font, Maria; Trotta, Francesco; Pierantozzi, Andrea; Di Filippo, Aurora; Altamura, Gianluca; Da Cas, Roberto; Martini, Nello",Recenti Prog Med,,920

258301,Specific Considerations for Venovenous Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation During Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pandemic,2020,"The COVID-19 pandemic has posed several challenges to the Indian healthcare system. Here, we examine the situation in India considering the moral and ethical imperatives of decision making for public health. Currently, in the absence of proven therapies, empirical evidence is being used for treatment of Covid-19 disease. We find a dual standard of practice. Currently, only modern medicine therapies are used on an empirical basis, however, the same principle is not considered for the use of AYUSH systems. Appropriate use of evidence is required. In the ethics context and in the interest of the larger public good, we suggest the inclusion of simple and safe measures from AYUSH systems in the integrative protocols for prophylaxis and treatment of Covid-19.

289148,"Coronavirus Disease 2019: Understanding Immunopathogenesis Is the ""Holy Grail"" to Explain Why Children Have Less Severe Acute Disease",2020,"OBJECTIVES: To investigate the risk factors contributing to severity on admission. Additionally, risk factors of worst severity and fatality were studied. Moreover, factors were compared based on three points: early severity, worst severity and fatality. DESIGN: An observational cohort study using data entered in a Japan nationwide COVID-19 inpatient registry, COVIREGI-JP. SETTING: As of 28 September 2020, 10480 cases from 802 facilities have been registered. Participating facilities cover a wide range of hospitals where patients with COVID-19 are admitted in Japan. PARTICIPANTS: Participants who had a positive test result on any applicable SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic tests were admitted to participating healthcare facilities. A total of 3829 cases were identified from 16 January to 31 May 2020, of which 3376 cases were included in this study. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcome was severe or nonsevere on admission, determined by the requirement of mechanical ventilation or oxygen therapy, SpO2 or respiratory rate. Secondary outcome was the worst severity during hospitalisation, judged by the requirement of oxygen and/orinvasive mechanical ventilation/extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. RESULTS: Risk factors for severity on admission were older age, men, cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory disease, diabetes, obesity and hypertension. Cerebrovascular disease, liver disease, renal disease or dialysis, solid tumour and hyperlipidaemia did not influence severity on admission; however, it influenced worst severity. Fatality rates for obesity, hypertension and hyperlipidaemia were relatively lower. CONCLUSIONS: This study segregated the comorbidities influencing severity and death. It is possible that risk factors for severity on admission, worst severity and fatality are not consistent and may be propelled by different factors. Specifically, while hypertension, hyperlipidaemia and obesity had major effect on worst severity, their impact was mild on fatality in the Japanese population. Some studies contradict our results; therefore, detailed analyses, considering in-hospital treatments, are needed for validation.

310228,Utility of Coronavirus Disease 2019 Immune Profiling for the Clinician at the Bedside,2021,"Since 2016, social media companies and news providers have come under pressure to tackle the spread of political mis- and disinformation (MDI) online. However, despite evidence that online health MDI (on the web, on social media, and within mobile apps) also has negative real-world effects, there has been a lack of comparable action by either online service providers or state-sponsored public health bodies. We argue that this is problematic and seek to answer three questions: why has so little been done to control the flow of, and exposure to, health MDI online; how might more robust action be justified; and what specific, newly justified actions are needed to curb the flow of, and exposure to, online health MDI? In answering these questions, we show that four ethical concerns-related to paternalism, autonomy, freedom of speech, and pluralism-are partly responsible for the lack of intervention. We then suggest that these concerns can be overcome by relying on four arguments: (1) education is necessary but insufficient to curb the circulation of health MDI, (2) there is precedent for state control of internet content in other domains, (3) network dynamics adversely affect the spread of accurate health information, and (4) justice is best served by protecting those susceptible to inaccurate health information. These arguments provide a strong case for classifying the quality of the infosphere as a social determinant of health, thus making its protection a public health responsibility. In addition, they offer a strong justification for working to overcome the ethical concerns associated with state-led intervention in the infosphere to protect public health.","Morley, Jessica; Cowls, Josh; Taddeo, Mariarosaria; Floridi, Luciano",J Med Internet Res,,920
310229,Utility of Coronavirus Disease 2019 Immune Profiling for the Clinician at the Bedside,2021,"Background and Purpose:With the surge of critically ill COVID-19 patients, neurology and neurosurgery residents and advanced practice providers (APPs) were deployed to intensive care units (ICU). These providers lacked relevant critical care training. We investigated whether a focused video-based learning curriculum could effectively teach high priority intensive care topics in this unprecedented setting to these neurology providers.Methods:Neurocritical care clinicians led a multidisciplinary team in developing a 2.5-hour lecture series covering the critical care management of COVID-19 patients. We examined whether provider confidence, stress, and knowledge base improved after viewing the lectures.Results:A total of 88 residents and APPs participated across 2 academic institutions. 64 participants (73%) had not spent time as an ICU provider. After viewing the lecture series, the proportion of providers who felt moderately, quite, or extremely confident increased from 11% to 72% (60% difference, 95% CI 49-72%) and the proportion of providers who felt nervous/stressed, very nervous/stressed, or extremely nervous/stressed decreased from 78% to 48% (38% difference, 95% CI 26-49%). Scores on knowledge base questions increased an average of 2.5 out of 12 points (SD 2.1;p &lt; 0.001).Conclusion:A targeted, asynchronous curriculum on critical care COVID-19 management led to significantly increased confidence, decreased stress, and improved knowledge among resident trainees and APPs. This curriculum could serve as an effective didactic resource for neurology providers preparing for the COVID-19 ICU.","Châang, Judy H.; Ford, Jenna Cifrese Laura Woodward Elliott Mears Jennifer Lowrie Rachel Holland Chloe Kaplan Aaron Zhang Cenai Guterman Elan L.",The Neurohospitalist,,920
345220,The impact of COVID-19 pandemic on cardiac surgery in Israel,2020,"An outbreak of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) occurred in China. The causative agent of COVID-19 is Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The disease rapidly spreads from China to the world by trading and traveling. Until April 24, 2020, approximately 2,544,792 cases were confirmed with 175,694 deaths throughout the world. The highest number of cases were identified from the United States of America (USA) whereas the mortality rate is high in Portugal. The diagnosis of COVID-19 is based on Computed Tomography Scanning (CT Scan) and Real-Time Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (qRT-PCR). Assessing the extension of pathology, the exact location of the area involved, and assessment of the disease severity makes CT scan superior to other modalities. This review shows that real-time polymerase chain reaction and imaging technology both play an important role in the diagnosis of COVID-19. However, imaging modalities have more importance in diagnosis and screening than qRT-PCR. The qRT-PCR was positive in 81.3% whereas CT scan abnormality was observed in 89.8%. Bilateral lobe (51.4%) abnormality was found more than a single lobe (21.5%) in COVID-19 infected patients. The CT scan reports show a high-level abnormality in right lower lung lobe than others in COVID-19 infected patients. The CT scan evaluates different manifestations such as the presence of ground-glass opacities, consolidations, crazy paying linear, cavitation, discrete nodules, pleural effusion, and lymphadenopathy. It is concluded that imaging technology especially CT scan and X-rays play an important role in the screening and diagnosis of COVID-19 infected patients in limited access to qRT-PCR regions. The common radiological manifestation was also determined, which will be helpful for the radiologist to diagnosed COVID-19 infected patients in the early stages. Follow up studies required regarding the radiological examinations.","Shahzeb, Muhammad; Khan, Areena; Muhammad, Anees",J. Pure Appl. Microbiol.,,920

Because of significant disparity levels in Latin American countries with deficient health care access and significant poverty, their population may end up among the most severely impacted. Patients with chronic conditions such as rheumatic diseases are quite vulnerable because of their high flaring risks and subsequent poor outcomes. Additionally, an overuse of antimalarials for the treatment of COVID-19 could lead to shortages in our region. Telemedicine, personal protective equipment use by patients and providers, web conferences, and comprehensive care are tools that will contribute to reduce the risk of infections and other complications in rheumatic disease patients, as well as to improve the knowledge and experience of rheumatologists at a global level.","Elera-Fitzcarrald, Claudia; Ugarte-Gil, Manuel F; AlarcÃ³n, Graciela S",J Clin Rheumatol,,920
398233,Reply to Wengenmayer et al.: Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation for Critically Ill Patients with COVID-19-related Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome: Worth the Effort!,2020,"BACKGROUND: Asymptomatic individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection have viable viral loads and have been linked to several transmission cases. However, data on the viral loads in such individuals are lacking. We assessed the viral loads in asymptomatic individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection in comparison with those in symptomatic patients with COVID-19. METHODS: Study participants were recruited from a community facility designated for the isolation of patients with mild COVID-19 in South Korea. The presence of symptoms was evaluated with a questionnaire-based survey. Viral loads in the upper respiratory tract were measured with real-time reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) targeting the E, RdRp and N genes of SARS-CoV-2, with a cycle threshold (Ct) value of 40 for determining positivity. RESULTS: In 213 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, 41 (19%) had remained asymptomatic from potential exposure to laboratory confirmation and admission; of them, 39 (95%) underwent follow-up RT-PCR testing after a median 13 days. In 172 symptomatic patients, 144 (84%) underwent follow-up RT-PCR testing. Twenty-one (54%) asymptomatic individuals and 92 (64%) symptomatic patients tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 at follow-up. Asymptomatic individuals and symptomatic patients did not show any significant differences in the mean Ct values of the E (31.15 vs 31.43; p>0.99), RdRp (32.26 vs 32.93; p=0.92) and N (33.05 vs 33.28; p>0.99) genes. CONCLUSION: Approximately one-fifth of the individuals without severe symptoms were asymptomatic, and their viral loads were comparable to those in symptomatic patients. A large proportion of mildly symptomatic patients with COVID-19 or asymptomatic individuals with SARS-CoV-2 showed persistent positive upper respiratory RT-PCR results at follow-up.","Ra, Sang Hyun; Lim, Joon Seo; Kim, Gwang-Un; Kim, Min Jae; Jung, Jiwon; Kim, Sung-Han",Thorax,,920

504729,Live Tweeting the Discovery of a New Coronavirus Disease 2019-Related Syndrome in Children,2021,"BACKGROUND: The use of hyaluronic acid soft tissue fillers in aesthetic medicine exploded in recent years for many reasons, including being relatively safe. Incidence of delayed inflammatory reactions (DIRs) to hyaluronic acid soft tissue fillers range between 0.3% and 4.25%. These reactions are mediated by T-lymphocytes and can be triggered by flu-like illnesses, including SARS-CoV-2 infection. Vaccination may also induce hypersensitivity. AIM: In this case report, we present two cases of delayed reaction after hyaluronic acid soft tissue filler treatment of the tear trough area and following mRNA vaccination against SARS-Cov-2, also known as COVID-19, months later. PATIENTS: A 39-year old female who previously had her tear trough area treated with hyaluronic acid soft tissue filler developed swelling days after getting the mRNA Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. Another patient, a 61-year-olf female, developed intermittent facial swelling in areas previously treated with hyaluronic acid soft tissue fillers days after receiving her first dose of the mRNA Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. RESULTS: As demonstrated in our case report, vaccination against COVID-19 may induce DIRs in patients who previously had hyaluronic soft tissue fillers. CONCLUSION: Delayed inflammatory reactions to hyaluronic acid soft tissue fillers are uncommon and usually self-limited, with frequent spontaneous resolution. However, considering the ongoing pandemic and the worldwide demand for vaccines against COVID-19, the aesthetic providers should be conscious of the risks posed by the interaction of such vaccines in patients who previously had or seeking hyaluronic acid soft tissue filler injections.","Michon, Alain",J Cosmet Dermatol,,920
621064,Utility of Coronavirus Disease 2019 Immune Profiling for the Clinician at the Bedside*,2021-05-28,"BACKGROUND: The uncertainty surrounding the COVID-19 crisis and the different approaches taken to manage it have triggered scientific controversies among experts. This study seeks to examine how the fragile nature of Israeli democracy accommodated differences of opinion between experts during the COVID-19 crisis. OBJECTIVE: To map and analyze the discourse between experts surrounding issues that were the topic of scientific controversy. To examine the viewpoints of the public regarding the positions of the different experts. METHODS AND SAMPLE: A sequential mixed study design. The qualitative research was a discourse analysis of 435 items that entailed mapping the voices of different experts regarding controversial topics. In the quantitative study, a total of 924 participants answered a questionnaire examining topics that engendered differences of opinion between the experts. RESULTS: The results showed that there was no dialogue between opposition and coalition experts. Moreover, the coalition experts labeled the experts who criticized them as âcoronavirus deniersâ and âanti-vaxxers.â The coalition changed its opinion on one issue onlyâthe issue of lockdowns. When we asked the public how they see the scientific controversy between the coalition and the opposition experts, they expressed support for opposition policies on matters related to the implications of the lockdowns and to transparency, while supporting government policy mainly on topics related to vaccinations. The research findings also indicate that personal and socio-demographic variables can influence how the public responds to the debate between experts. The main differentiating variables were the personal attribute of conservatism, locus of control, age, and nationality. CONCLUSION: Controversy must be encouraged to prevent misconceptions. The internal discourse in the committees that advise the government must be transparent, and coalition experts must be consistently exposed to the views of opposition experts, who must be free to voice their views without fear.","Gesser-Edelsburg, Anat; Zemach, Mina; Hijazi, Rana",Risk Manag Healthc Policy,https://doi.org/10.2147/rmhp.s311334; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34188567/,920
623963,International Survey to Establish Prioritized Outcomes for Trials in People With Coronavirus Disease 2019,2020-08-25,"INTRODUCTION: Remdesivir (RDV) is an inhibitor of the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases that are active in some RNA viruses, including the Ebola virus and zoonotic coronaviruses. When severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was identified as the etiologic agent of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), several investigations have assessed the potential activity of RDV in inhibiting viral replication, giving rise to hope for an effective treatment. AREAS COVERED: In this review, the authors describe the main investigations leading to the discovery of RDV and its subsequent development as an antiviral agent, focusing on the main clinical trials investigating its efficacy in terms of symptom resolution and mortality reduction. EXPERT OPINION: RDV is the most widely investigated antiviral drug for the treatment of COVID-19. This attention on RDV activity against SARS-CoV-2 is justified by promising in vitro studies, which demonstrated that RDV was able to suppress viral replication without significant toxicity. Such activity was confirmed by an investigation in an animal model and by the results of preliminary clinical investigations. Nevertheless, the efficacy of RDV in reducing mortality has not been clearly demonstrated.","Pagliano, Pasquale; Sellitto, Carmine; Scarpati, Giuliana; Ascione, Tiziana; Conti, Valeria; Franci, Gianluigi; Piazza, Ornella; Filippelli, Amelia",Expert opinion on drug discovery,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34412564/; https://doi.org/10.1080/17460441.2021.1970743,920

634775,Safety and Feasibility of an Interdisciplinary Treatment Approach to Optimize Recovery From Critical Coronavirus Disease 2019,2021-08-19,"OBJECTIVES: Serologic testing for SARS-CoV-2 is an important element in the fight to slow the COVID-19 pandemic. This study aimed to validate two serologic tests for total (IgM, IgG, IgA) SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, (i) the Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Total Antibody assay for the Vitros 5600 analyzers and (ii) a manual laboratory developed ELISA (FDA EUA pending), for use in parallel orthogonal testing of asymptomatic healthcare workers and affiliates of the University of Maryland Medical System. Design and Methods Validation and verification of the two tests was performed using samples from hospitalized patients that were found to be PCR positive for SARS-CoV-2, samples pre-COVID-19, and samples from individuals with current/previous infections with other viruses. Healthcare workers and affiliates from across the University of Maryland Health System were provided testing free of charge and their results were reported as reactive or non-reactive if the two tests were concordance, or indeterminate if the results were discordant. RESULTS: Validation testing found the Ortho Vitros test to be 100% (73/73) sensitive, and 99.3% (152/153) specific, while the UMMC ELISA was found to be 97.6% (204/209) sensitive and 100% (288/288) specific. Real world testing among 8399 healthcare workers found that 2.9% (247/8399) of healthcare workers were positive for anti- SARS-CoV-2 antibodies by both tests. An indeterminate rate of 1.1% (91/8399), in which one test reported reactive results, and one as non-reactive was also seen. CONCLUSIONS: Parallel orthogonal testing improves the positive and negative predictive value of serologic testing in populations with low prevalence. The use of an indeterminate result from parallel orthogonal testing allows for the follow-up and re-testing, which helps resolve discrepancies between assays.","Mullins, Kristin E.; Merrill, VeRonika; Ward, Matthew; King, Brent; Rock, Peter; Caswell, Mary; Ahlman, Mark; Harris, Anthony D; Christenson, Robert",Clin Biochem,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0009912021000059; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0009912021000059?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clinbiochem.2021.01.004; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33472036/,920

There was a significant increase of psychological distress and symptoms of mental illness, and worsening of quality of sleep in the general population. METHODS: Participants completed an anonymous web-based survey that include questionnaires about sleep and anxiety and depression symptoms. Our sample included 400 subjects: 307 students (mean age 22.84 Â± 2.68) and 93 university administration staff workers (mean age 37.02 Â± 12.46). RESULTS: we found an increase in Bed Time hour, Sleep Latency, and Wake-Up time between before and during COVID-19 emergency and a worsening of sleep quality and of insomnia symptoms. In particular, during the lockdown, the impact of the delay in Bed Time and in Wake-Up was more pronounced in students. In workers, we observed a prevalence of maintenance insomnia before COVID-19 of 24% that significantly increase during COVID-19 reaching 40%, while workers with difficulties in sleep initiation were only 15% that increased to 42%. In our sample, 27.8% showed depressive symptoms, while 34.3% showed anxious symptoms, in particular in students. CONCLUSION: The impact of lockdown was greater in students than in workers, and in females than in males.

However, research about the impact of this pandemic on children from ethnical minorities is scarce. We tested the effects of COVID-19 outbreak on psychological aspects and daily routines among Arab Israeli Children. An online cross-sectional survey was conducted among Arab Israeli parents, including behavioral and emotional aspects questionnaire and questions addressing using of screens, sleep, and physical activities. The results showed that, during the COVID-19 outbreak, 55.8% of the children asked to sleep in their parentsâ bed and 45% expressed fears they did not have before. Most of the children showed increased irritability, constant mood swings and nervousness about limits and messages, and 41.4% showed sleep difficulties. Concerning adaptive behaviors, more than 50% of the parents reported that their child became wiser, lazier, and was able to adapt the limits and restriction of the COVID-19 outbreak. Moreover, the children tended to increase their use of screens, used to sleep more time, and were less active physically. The results suggest that children are vulnerable to the COVID-19 outbreak psychological effects and highlight the need to reduce the psychological burden of this pandemic and the necessity of immediate intervention.","Ghanamah, Rafat; Eghbaria-Ghanamah, Hazar",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33805644/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18062946,920
