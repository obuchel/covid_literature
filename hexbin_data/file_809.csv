44298,44298,44298,Decomposing Probabilistic Lambda-Calculi,7.9863153,2.0033376,2020-04-17,"BACKGROUND: Michigan was one of the severely impacted regions during the initial COVID-19 surge. An institutional protocol with early methylprednisolone (MP) to treat COVID-19 patients requiring supplemental oxygen was implemented. We sought to study characteristics of these patients who were readmitted with infectious and non-infectious diagnoses. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of 21 COVID-19 readmitted patients initially admitted between 3/10/2020 and 4/20/2020 (early 0–7, late 8–30 days) was done. Total of 455 COVID-19 patients, confirmed by a positive nasopharyngeal RT-PCR were admitted during this time period. Demographic data, clinical characteristics, laboratory and radiographic results and treatments were compared among the early and late readmission groups. Univariate and logistic regression analysis were performed to study the risk factors associated with early readmission and worsening of COVID-19 pneumonia. Secondary analyses were performed comparing worsening COVID-19 pneumonia with other readmission diagnoses. RESULTS: 4.6% (21/455) were readmitted, 14 early vs 7 late (median age 75 vs 65 yrs). Most early readmissions were COVID-19 related and 8 out of 14 had worsening COVID-19 pneumonia based on clinical picture, laboratory and imaging findings. Readmitted patients with worsening COVID-19 related pneumonia had significantly elevated CRP and lower ALC compared to last discharge value (Table 1). None of the late readmissions required MP. A total of 8 readmissions had bacterial coinfections (1/8 COVID-19 related) (Table 2). Bacterial infections unrelated to COVID-19 were aspiration pneumonia (2), urinary tract infection (2), enterococcal bacteremia from stercoral colitis (1), sacral osteomyelitis (1), and infected BKA stump (1). Each increasing day of MP duration during the first admission reduced the likelihood of early readmission by approximately 10% (OR 0.90, 95% CI 0.63–1.2, p=0.56) (Table 3). 1/14 and 0/7 patients died amongst early and late readmissions respectively. Table 1: Characteristics of early and late readmissions in COVID-19 patients [Image: see text] Table 2: Readmission Diagnosis [Image: see text] Table 3: Univariate and Multivariate Analysis of Readmissions [Image: see text] CONCLUSION: Early MP in COVID-19 pneumonia was not associated with increased risk of early secondary bacterial infections in the readmitted patients. Optimal duration of MP in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia needs to be defined.

44300,44300,44300,The Polynomial Complexity of Vector Addition Systems with States,7.939533,1.9776456,2020-04-17,"BACKGROUND: Fever and cough are frequently reported in COVID-19 infections, although little is known about the subgroup of symptomatic patients who do not manifest these classic symptoms. We aimed to compare clinical manifestations and outcomes for hospitalized COVID-19 patients with typical vs. atypical presentations and identify risk factors for atypical COVID-19 presentations. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort of all patients hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infections during 3/13- 5/13/2020 at UW Health, a network of 3 acute-care hospitals in Midwest. We defined atypical cases as patients hospitalized for COVID-19 related reasons presenting without fever and cough and compared them in univariate analysis with patients manifesting both symptoms (controls). We identified independent risk factors for atypical COVID-19 presentations by logistic regression. RESULTS: Among the 163 patients hospitalized during the 60-day study frame, 39 (24%) had atypical presentations. Table 1 shows demographic, clinical manifestations, and outcomes of atypical vs. typical cases. On univariate analysis, atypical cases were more likely to be older, reside in a long-term-care facility (LTCF), have underlying diabetes mellitus, stroke, cardiac disease, and deny myalgias or dyspnea, despite having no significant difference in the prevalence of hypoxia or radiological lung infiltrates. Atypical cases also had a significantly higher Beta-Natriuretic-Peptide and lower C-Reactive-Protein, although other inflammatory markers were not significantly different. They were less likely to be admitted to the ICU, and more likely to die within 30 days, as older patients with respiratory failure and multiple comorbidities opted for comfort measures and less aggressive care. On multivariate analysis, LTCF residence was the only independent predictor for atypical status (Table 2). [Image: see text] [Image: see text] CONCLUSION: LTCF residents are more likely to experience COVID-19 respiratory illness (hypoxia, pneumonia) without classic symptoms (fever, cough, myalgias, dyspnea). Given the excessive pandemic burden in the LTCF setting, timely recognition and diagnosis of these atypical, more subtle presentations is critical.

44302,44302,44302,Relative Full Completeness for Bicategorical Cartesian Closed Structure,8.0439415,2.016235,2020-04-17,"BACKGROUND: Proven/probable lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) caused by seasonal human coronaviruses (HCoVs) is associated with mortality after hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). However, risk factors for LRTI and the significance of virologic documentation of lower respiratory tract involvement by bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) on outcome are not well characterized. METHODS: Patients receiving allogeneic HCT between 4/2008 and 9/2018 with HCoV (OC43/NL63/HKU1/229E) detected in nasopharyngeal or BAL samples by PCR were retrospectively analyzed. Proven/probable LRTI was defined as having virus detected from a BAL sample with or without new pulmonary infiltrates by chest radiography, respectively. Possible LRTI was defined as having virus detected from an upper respiratory tract sample with new pulmonary infiltrates. We used logistic regression models to evaluate risk factors for LRTI in patients with first documented HCoV infection during pretransplant conditioning or post-HCT. Overall mortality following proven/probable and possible LRTI was compared by the log-rank test. RESULTS: A total of 297 patients (61 children and 236 adults) developed HCoV infection as follows: 254 had upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) alone, 18 presented with LRTI, and 25 progressed from URTI to LRTI [median 16 days (range, 2–62 days)]. Multivariable analyses showed that male gender, higher immunodeficiency scoring index, albumin < 3 g/dl, glucose > 150 mg/dl and presence of respiratory copathogen at HCoV diagnosis were associated with the occurrence of LRTI (Figure 1). Patients with proven/probable LRTI (N=16) had significantly worse survival than those with possible LRTI (N=37) (p=0.006, Figure 2). Figure 1. [Image: see text] Figure 2. [Image: see text] CONCLUSION: Our analyses identified risk factors (hypoalbuminemia, male gender, high glucose and presence of respiratory copathogen) uncommonly appreciated for LRTI due to other respiratory viruses in HCT recipients. Whether these factors are also relevant to LRTI due to SARS-CoV-2 after HCT requires further studies. The association of hyperglycemia with LRTI might provide an opportunity to reduce the risk of LRTI.

44304,44304,44304,Learning Weighted Automata over Principal Ideal Domains,7.941711,1.8614439,2020-04-17,"BACKGROUND: Detroit, Michigan has a poverty rate nearly three times the national average. Homeless shelters are at risk for infectious outbreaks due to reduced healthcare access for residents, compounded by overcrowding, hygienic challenges, lack of resources, and transient nature of residents. Prior to the first reported COVID-19 case in Michigan, the Detroit Health Department prioritized screening of both asymptomatic and symptomatic homeless residents residing in the city’s shelters. Early identification of COVID-19 positive cases allowed for implementation of strategies to halt further spread. METHODS: A surveillance strategy was implemented prior to the first confirmed COVID-19 case in Michigan. Surveillance involved temperature and symptom checks at each homeless shelter, three times weekly. 24 shelters were screened for symptoms, 13 shelters had universal testing performed. Two city-operated quarantine sites for COVID-positive and –suspected homeless individuals were organized. If a shelter resident tested positive, that shelter was placed in quarantine, and new referrals stopped for 14 days. Temperature and symptom check frequency increased to daily for 14 days. If a patient was positive for fever or symptoms, they were transferred to the quarantine center for testing and isolation. RESULTS: Over 23,000 temperature and symptom checks occurred in 24 shelters across Detroit since February 22. This identified 15 patients who were referred to the quarantine site. From April 11 to May 31, 721 residents from 13 homeless shelters were screened with universal testing for COVID-19, and 93 (12.9%) tested positive (Figure 1). Of 95 homeless residents who were referred through shelter surveillance, from the local hospital system and via unsheltered street outreach, and tested on-site at the quarantine and isolation shelter, 29 (31%) tested positive for COVID-19, and 66 (69%) tested negative. Figure 1. System-wide homeless shelter testing of COVID-19 [Image: see text] CONCLUSION: Homeless populations across the US are especially vulnerable to COVID-19, with high risk for rapid spread due to crowding and difficulty with physical distancing. The need for increased testing- and prevention-based strategies in this population is crucial. The process performed in Detroit’s homeless shelters can be a model for other communities at risk for COVID-19 outbreaks.

We conducted this study to identify individual’s factors at the population level which are associated with the risk of infection with SARS-CoV-2 in a middle-to-low income country. METHODS: A prospective case-control study was conducted to compare the demographics, socioeconomics, and individual’s behavior between patients with COVID-19 and randomly selected healthy controls from the same population referring to a general hospital in northwest Iran. RESULTS: Data of 250 patients with a positive RT-PCR test for COVID-19 was compared with 250 healthy controls between March 1(st) and May 15(th) (Table1). Higher education, better socioeconomic status, having access to the internet or following relevant news, having an obsession for cleanliness especially regular hands washing with alcohol-based disinfectants, wearing masks in public especially those with an N-95 filter, complying with stay-home orders, and receiving the flu shot over the past season were protective against contracting COVID-19. On the contrary, cigarette smoking or opium consumption, a history of recent travel, having an individual with infection with SARS-CoV-2 within the household, and recent hospitalization were associated with COVID-19. Table1. Comparison of individual’s factors between COVID-19 positive and negative patients [Image: see text] CONCLUSION: Individuals’ characteristics at a family or public level can guide healthcare authorities and lawmakers in their ongoing endeavors toward controlling the COVID-19 pandemics, especially in low-to-middle income regions.

44307,44307,44307,Exponential Automatic Amortized Resource Analysis,8.131817,1.9413409,2020-04-17,"BACKGROUND: The Coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) global health crisis caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has resulted in unprecedented mortality, impacted society, and strained healthcare systems, yet sufficient data regarding treatment options are lacking. Convalescent plasma, used since 1895 for infectious disease outbreaks, offers promise as a treatment option for COVID-19. METHODS: This is a retrospective study of patients diagnosed by a nasopharyngeal swab SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), who received convalescent plasma between April to June 2020 at two large hospitals in Miami, Florida, as part of the US FDA Expanded Access Program for COVID-19 convalescent plasma (CCP). RESULTS: A total of 23 patients received CCP, 13 (57%) had severe COVID-19 disease, while 8 (35%) had critical or critical with multiorgan dysfunction. Median time of follow up was 26 (range, 7–79) days. Overall, 11 (48%) survived to discharge, 6 (26%) died, while 6 (26%) are currently hospitalized. All deaths reported were due to septic shock from secondary infections. 15 (65%) showed improvement in oxygen requirements 7 days post CCP transfusion. Measured inflammatory markers, c-reactive protein, lactate dehydrogenase, ferritin and d-dimer improved 7 days post transfusion in 13 (57%) patients. No adverse events due to the transfusion were reported. 10 (43.4%) patients had a negative SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR at a median of 14.5 (range, 4–31) days after receiving convalescent plasma. CONCLUSION: Administration of convalescent plasma was found to be safe, with favorable outcomes in this small cohort of relatively high acuity patients. Larger studies including control arms are needed to establish the efficacy of convalescent plasma on clinical and virologic outcomes for patients with COVID-19.

Many patients receive antibiotics until a bacterial infection can be ruled out. To minimize aerosolization of SARS-CoV-2, non-invasive sampling, such as endotracheal aspiration (ETA), is preferred over invasive techniques. The purpose of this study is to determine the diagnostic yield of ETA and effect of ETA on antibiotic management in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: This retrospective analysis included patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) from March 1 to May 31, 2020 who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Patients who did not receive mechanical ventilation were excluded. Data were extracted from electronic medical records. When ETA was performed, records were manually reviewed to determine diagnostic yield and effect on antibiotic management. Diagnostic yield was defined as ETA result with a plausible respiratory pathogen in a quantity of moderate or many. Plausible respiratory pathogens exclude normal flora, yeast, coagulase-negative Staphylococcus sp and Enterococcus sp. The primary outcome is the frequency of initiation, change, no change, or discontinuation of antibiotics based on ETA results. RESULTS: 124 patients with COVID-19 were admitted to the ICU; 76 met inclusion criteria. The average age was 58 years and 75% were male. Hispanic or Latino ethnicity made up the majority of the patient population (63%). Antibiotics were administered to 97% of patients for a median of 11 days of therapy (IQR 7, 21). There were 100 ETAs performed on 55 patients for a diagnostic yield of 21%. ETA led to a change in antibiotic management 47% of the time it was performed. Antibiotic changes include de-escalation (29), discontinuation (7), escalation (6), and initiation (5). [Image: see text] [Image: see text] [Image: see text] CONCLUSION: The diagnostic yield of ETA in mechanically ventilated patients with COVID-19 was low. Furthermore, ETA results led to a change in antibiotics less than half of the time. The use of ETA to diagnose bacterial co-infection and guide antibiotic therapy in patients with COVID-19 should be weighed against the risk of using a more invasive sampling technique vs the benefit of potential for increased diagnostic yield. Another conclusion may be to forgo ETA if the result is unlikely to change management.

44310,44310,44310,Constructing Infinitary Quotient-Inductive Types,7.9886856,1.8882823,2020-04-17,"BACKGROUND: We studied the prevalence of positive SARS-CoV2 antibody and positive SARS-CoV2 antigen among high risk health care workers at Loma Linda University Health System (LLUHS) who voluntarily obtained SARS-CoV2 antibody testing, and if indicated, antigen testing. The study determined that there is a significant decrease in the prevalence of SARS-CoV2 antigen among employees at LLUH compared to the community. METHODS: Employee Health and Occupational Medicine offered antibody testing to employees who were considered high risk, primarily working in the Coronavirus Disease 19 (COVID-19) designated units. We tested 658 subjects’ serum for the presence of IgM and IgG antibodies via the Nirmidas Qualitative SARS-CoV2 test. 29 subjects with a positive antibody test were subsequently tested for the presence of serum SARS-CoV2 antigen via PCR. RESULTS: There were 31 subjects who tested positive for IgM or IgG antibodies. 11 subjects had positive IgM with negative IgG. 3 subjects had negative IgM with positive IgG. 15 patients had positive IgM and positive IgG. 2 subjects had positive IgM with negative IgG, were subsequently retested, and then found to have positive IgM and positive IgG. Of those 31 subjects with a positive antibody test, 2 were not tested for the COVID-19 antigen, 1 had an inconclusive test, 23 tested negative, and 5 tested positive. Of those 5 positive for the antigen, 2 had symptoms and 3 did not report symptoms or did not use the symptom questionnaire. The community prevalence of positive SARS-CoV2 antigen in San Bernardino is 0.37%, as of June 16. The prevalence of positive SARS-CoV2 antigen among LLUH employees is 0.03% and the prevalence of positive antibody is 0.18%. The value of z is -7.3206, p is < .00001. Thus, the result is significant at p < .01. CONCLUSION: The results of this testing supports the efficacy of the early protective measures that LLUHS implemented in preparation for the pandemic. Such protective measures include: mandated face masks, symptoms screening, testing for SARS-CoV2 antibody or antigen on patients admitted, a dedicated COVID-19 section of the emergency department as well as inpatient units, etc. Given the statistical significance of this study, the protective bundle can be used as a template for preventative measures for future pandemics.

We reviewed serological test results in a cohort of SNF residents who had been repetitively screened for SARS-CoV-2 infection by nasopharyngeal swab PCR. METHODS: In late March 2019, we identified symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 PCR positive residents at a SNF. In response, all remaining SNF patients were serially screened, and all SARS-CoV-2 PCR positive patients were transferred to the acute care hospital or cohorted in a separate COVID Recovery Unit (CRU) in the SNF. In early June, all SNF residents (SARS-CoV-2 PCR positive and negative) underwent serologic testing for SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S1/S2) IgG (DiaSorin). DiaSorin IgG-positive results for patients that were SARS-CoV-2 PCR-negative were reflexed to nucleocapsid IgG (Abbott). Antibody testing occurred a median of 69 days (63–70 IQR) after PCR positivity. RESULTS: Nineteen SARS-CoV-2 PCR positive residents were identified from the outbreak and an additional 9 were transferred from the acute care hospital to the CRU; 1 died and 1 received convalescent plasma leaving 26 SARS-CoV-2 PCR positive residents, including 6 who were asymptomatic, that were eligible for serologic testing. Twenty-four of the 26 were positive for IgG by the DiaSorin assay; one seronegative resident was one of the asymptomatic residents. There were an additional 121 residents in the SNF whose SARS-CoV-2 PCR was negative at least once. Among these 121 SNF residents with negative SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR, all but two were seronegative by the Diasorin assay. The two seropositive residents had no nucleocapsid antibodies when reflex tested by the Abbott assay. [Image: see text] CONCLUSION: In a limited sample of SNF residents with SARS-CoV-2 PCR positivity, the sensitivity of the Diasorin assay was 92% (24/26) and the specificity was 98% (119/121). None of the residents with negative SARS-CoV-2 PCR had confirmed positive antibody results using reflex testing (DiaSorin/Abbott). Despite high risk exposure in congregate living facilities, we found no evidence of additional SARS-CoV-2 exposure, reinforcing the importance of serial surveillance SARS-CoV-2 testing and early cohorting in SNF settings.

Here, we used unbiased metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) to assess the frequencies of 1) alternative viral infections in SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR negative PUIs and 2) viral co-infections in SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR positive PUIs. METHODS: A convenience sample set was selected from PUIs who were tested for SARS-CoV-2 in the Emory Healthcare system during the first 2 months of the pandemic from 02/26-04/23/20. Laboratory results were extracted by chart review; Flu/RSV and multiplex respiratory pathogen PCRs had been performed at the discretion of treating physicians. Excess nasopharyngeal swab samples were retrieved within 72 hours of collection and underwent RNA extraction and SARS-CoV-2 testing by triplex RT-PCR. mNGS was performed by DNAse treatment, random primer cDNA synthesis, Nextera XT tagmentation, and high-depth Illumina sequencing. Reads underwent taxonomic classification by KrakenUniq, as implemented in viral-ngs. RESULTS: 53 PUIs were included, 30 negative and 23 positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR. Among SARS-CoV-2 negative PUIs, 28 (93%) underwent clinical testing for alternative infections, and 8 (29%) tested positive for another respiratory virus. In all cases, mNGS identified the same virus (Table 1). In another 3 PUIs, mNGS identified two viruses that were not tested for and one that was missed by routine testing. No SARS-CoV-2 was detected by mNGS among RT-PCR negative PUIs. Among SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR positive PUIs, 18 (69%) underwent clinical testing for co-infections, and none were detected. mNGS did not identify any viral co-infections but did detect SARS-CoV-2 in all 23 PUIs. Table 1: Molecular and Metagenomic Testing of Persons Under Investigation [Image: see text] CONCLUSION: Unbiased mNGS offers the powerful opportunity to streamline testing for PUIs by assessing for SARS-CoV-2 and alternative infections simultaneously; this technique can also be used to identify co-infections, but none were observed in our study population. Interestingly, many PUIs had no infection identified on routine testing or mNGS, which may reflect inadequate sampling, rapid virus clearance, or a non-viral process.

44315,44315,44315,Contextual Equivalence for Signal Flow Graphs,7.9720387,1.8673296,2020-04-17,"BACKGROUND: Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a complication that has been described among severely ill patients with COVID-19 and may be more common in those with underlying chronic kidney disease (CKD). Some patients with AKI require renal replacement therapy (RRT), including continuous RRT (CRRT). During the COVID-19 pandemic, some US areas experienced CRRT supply shortages. We sought to describe the percent of hospitalized COVID-19 patients who developed AKI or needed RRT to inform patient care and resource planning. METHODS: We searched for studies in the literature and public health investigations that described CKD, AKI, and/or RRT in COVID-19 patients from January 2020 onward. Studies were excluded if no CKD, AKI, or RRT information was provided. We abstracted counts of hospitalized COVID-19 patients, including those admitted to intensive care units (ICU) who developed AKI, underwent RRT, and/or had CKD. Data were pooled across cohorts by geographic region with available data (US, China, or United Kingdom [UK]). We compared proportions using Chi-square tests. RESULTS: A total of 311 studies were identified; 23 studies (US n=11; China n=11; UK n=1) that described kidney disease and/or kidney-related outcomes in hospitalized COVID-19 patients were included. Underlying CKD prevalence was higher in US cohorts (10.3%) compared with China (2.5%) or UK (1.5%) (p< 0.0001). AKI was markedly higher among hospitalized (31.3% vs. 6.4%; p < 0 .001) and ICU patients (55.4% vs. 18.2%; p< 0.0001) in the US compared to China. The percent of ICU patients requiring RRT in the US (16.8%) was significantly different from that reported in China (12.5%) and the UK (23.9%) (p< 0.0001). Limitations include differences in CKD and RRT definitions across studies. [Image: see text] CONCLUSION: AKI is a frequent outcome among US COVID-19 patients, affecting almost one third of hospitalized and more than half of ICU patients. AKI was reported more frequently in the US than China. The percent of ICU patients who received RRT was higher in the US and UK than in China. Understanding the occurrence of kidney-related outcomes among patients with COVID-19 including the impact of underlying CKD and regional practice variations is essential for healthcare systems to successfully plan for RRT needs during the pandemic.

44316,44316,44316,A Duality Theoretic View on Limits of Finite Structures,8.303169,1.8378652,2020-04-17,"BACKGROUND: While the majority of illness due to COVID-19 does not require hospitalization, little has been described about the host inflammatory response in the ambulatory setting. Differences in the levels of inflammatory signaling proteins between outpatient and hospitalized populations could identify key maladaptive immune responses during COVID-19. METHODS: Samples were collected from 76 participants (41% female, mean 46.8 years of age) enrolled at five military treatment facilities between March 20, 2020 and June 17, 2020 in an ongoing prospective COVID-19 cohort. This analysis was restricted to those with positive SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome–coronavirus 2) RT-PCR testing and included hospitalized (N=29; 10 requiring an ICU stay) and non-hospitalized (N=43) participants. Severity markers (IL6, D-dimer, procalcitonin, ferritin, ICAM-1, IL5, lipocalin, RAGE, TNFR, VEGFA, IFNγ, IL1β) were measured in plasma (mg/dL) using the Ella immunoassay and natural log transformed. Univariate negative binomial regression was performed to determine relative risk of hospitalization. Using the full marker panel, we performed a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to determine directions of maximal variance in the data. Pearson’s correlation coefficient was determined between analytes and each axis. RESULTS: Participants requiring ambulatory-, hospital-, and ICU-level care had samples collected at 44.0 (IQR: 35.0–51.0), 40.0 (13.0–51.0), and 47.5 (21.0–54.0) days, respectively. Higher unadjusted levels of IL6, D-dimer, procalcitonin, or ferritin were each associated with hospitalization (Table 1). The PCA showed a separation along axes between level of care and duration of symptoms (Fig 1). While significant correlations were noted with a number of biomarkers, PC1 most correlated with TNFR1 (r=0.88) and PC2 most correlated with IL6Ra (r=0.95). PC1 axis variation accounted for 36.5% of variance and the PC2 axis accounted for 20.0% of variance. Figure 1. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) of biomarkers by level of care and symptom duration.

Antimicrobial Stewardship Programs (ASPs) provide continuous surveillance of blood cultures to secure appropriate choice and duration of therapy. Comparing to historic data, we characterize our ASP experience in bacteremic surveillance during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Consecutive blood cultures at the Washington DC VA Medical Center were captured in an ASP-driven decision support software system (TheraDoc, Premier/DSS Inc) between Jan 1(st) 2018-May 31st 2020. In the setting of an established ASP, the organism positive cultures were reviewed over the first five months (Jan-May) of each of the three years collected. Results of cultures were characterized as either pathogenic gram positive (MSSA/MRSA/Enterococci/PSSP/PRSP/Strep sp.), pathogenic aerobic and anaerobic gram negative organisms and a skin contaminant-category (GPRs/skin flora/CNS). RESULTS: Over 3 yrs, 528 patients had 1464 positive cultures from among 8727 admissions, 83638 inpatient-days. The proportion of pathogenic GP bacteria and pathogenic GN bacteria were not statistically significantly different 38% (2018) vs 37% (2019) vs 39% (2020) and 33%, 31%, 27% respectively. There was slight trend in the increase of pathogenic GP 9.6 vs 9.5 vs 11.7 per 1,000 inpatient days and skin contaminant-category with 12.0 vs 11.0 vs. 14.1 per 1,000 patient days from 2019 to 2020. We noted a dramatic shift in culture surveillance report during the peak COVID-infection rates (March-April), notable for several weeks of few to no culture positive results. When broken down by month, variability was noted (data not shown). COVID-19 infected patients represented 9.0% (7/78) of positive blood culture results in 2020 Jan-May, only 5.1% (4/78) were treated as non-contaminants and were related to indwelling catheters or urosepsis. CONCLUSION: Overall and adjusted rates of the blood cultures sent during the pandemic months in 2020 were comparable to the comparative years. Surveillance revealed short term changes in patterns which may have reflected the pandemic induced changes to admissions. COVID-19 infected patients rarely experienced line and hospital acquired bactermia/fungemia, most during the recovery period.

Therefore, therapeutic interventions targeting the mitigation of this complication would markedly improve outcomes and reduce healthcare utilization. METHODS: Patients with COVID-19 from two hospitals in San Diego, California were randomized at a 1:1 ratio to receive standard of care (SOC) plus intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) at 0.5 g/kg/day x 3 days with solumedrol 40 mg 30 minutes before infusion (IVIG group) versus SOC alone. The primary composite endpoint was receipt of mechanical ventilation or death before receiving ventilation. Patients were followed until discharge to home or up to 30 days from time of enrollment. RESULTS: Sixteen patients received IVIG plus SOC and 17 SOC alone. The median age was 54 years for SOC and 57 years for IVIG. Median time from hospital admission to study enrollment was 1 day (range 0–4) for SOC and 2 days (range 0–8) for IVIG. APACHE II scores and Charlson comorbidity indices were similar for IVIG and SOC (median 8 vs 7 and 2 for both, respectively). Seven SOC patients achieved the composite endpoint (6 ventilated, 1 death) versus 2 IVIG patients (2 ventilated), p=0.12, Fisher exact test. Among the subgroup with an estimated A-a gradient of >200 mm Hg at time of enrollment, the IVIG group showed a lower rate of progression to the composite endpoint (2/14 vs 7/12, p=0.04 Fisher exact test), shorter median hospital length (11 vs 24 days, p=0.001 Mann Whitney U), and shorter median intensive care unit (ICU) stay (3 vs 13 days, p=0.005 Mann Whitey U). CONCLUSION: This small, prospective, randomized, open-label study showed that when administered to hypoxic non-ventilated COVID-19 patients with an A-a gradient of >200 mm Hg (corresponding to a requirement of 6 liters O(2) via nasal cannula to achieve an SpO(2) of 92%), IVIG significantly decreased the rates of progression to mechanical ventilation, ICU length of stay, and total hospital length of stay.

Since the first case reported in Wuhan, China, COVID-19 has spread across the globe with more than 7.6 million individuals affected worldwide. Several studies have tried to investigate the risk factors for mortality but there has bot been a definitive study in patients with ESRD. Herein, we aimed to investigate whether ESRD is associated with mortality as compared to age, gender and comorbidities matched cohorts. METHODS: A retrospective case control study was performed on patients 18-year-old with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 admitted to our hospital during the study period (03/15/2020 to 05/15/2020). Demographic, characteristics and clinical outcome were retrieved and reviewed. We found 39 ESRD patients, we matched them for 5 variables: Age, gender, diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension (HTN), and body mass index (BMI). Age was stratified into 3 groups (< 30, 30 to 60, >60), history of DM and HTN were defined by reviewing the admission medications, and BMI was divided into 2 categories (< 30 and 30 kg/m2). The primary endpoint was percentage of inpatient mortality. RESULTS: We had 39 ESRD patients with COVID-19 out of the 400 patients admitted during the study period with known clinical outcome. Nineteen patients (49%) were between 30 to 60 years old while the rest (51%) were older than 60 years old. As for gender, 25 (64%) were males and 14 (36%) females. Additional comorbidities were present in 38 patients with hypertension (92%) being the most common, followed by DM (64%) and BMI >30 kg/m2 (49%). With the 5 variables, we were able to match with 177 controls. Nineteen individuals expired out of the 39 ESRD patients (49%), as compared to 46 patients from the 177 matched cohort (26%) (z-score 2.80, p=0.0051; odds ratio [OR], 2.71; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.28–5.41). CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that ESRD patients is an independent risk factor for increased mortality in patients with COVID 19 disease. Larger prospective studies will need to confirm this finding and try to find ways to mitigate this very high mortality in this vulnerable population.

As a consequence, the social structure of the various actors in educational organizations as well as the way in which they interact with each other may/will change as well.

The Coronavirus, an epidemic virus, outbroken from China, has been spreading all over the place of the world. The transformation of this virus from China to Europe and other parts of the world forced the people to continue in a social separation that affected social integration. The mode of human relations, interdependence, and interaction have been changed due to the emergence of epidemic conditions in social phenomena.

Numerous estimations are available on the capital loss and the world may face a monetary crisis, and the crisis of human development. If not accurately tackled through political strategy, the social disintegration produced by the COVID-19 disease may develop the discrimination, isolation, inequity, and unemployment in an extensive period. So, the economic strategy may take a policy of inclusiveness, and collective social protection schemes, which may strongly function in safeguarding the right to work and life of the people in society. Subsequently, they perform as automatic stabilizers in decreasing the occurrence of poverty.

To this end, a social welfare perspective has been used, combining sociological studies of welfare with welfare economics, and a psychological approach emphasizing the subjective dimension of the phenomenon (positive psychology). Such an approach aims to answer the main research question, namely how algorithms based on new technologies change the subjective perception of leisure time and the daily practices implemented within its framework (e.g. work and formal non-work regimes).","Baranowski, Mariusz; Mroczkowska, Dorota",Handbook of Sustainable Development and Leisure Services,809,7

This mechanisation has led to the deployment of robotics and 3D-printers on construction sites. Drones are now equipped with cameras that are used to measure the progress of construction works and monitor assets for structural defects. Simultaneously, our cities are increasingly filled with various sensors that extract data from our digital trails, accelerating the datafication of our urban environment. This chapter outlines the broad themes of the book, exploring the impact of technologies of automation on the city in three ways: the automation of the design process to provide optimised solutions to design problems. Second, the automation of construction processes and building maintenance programmes, including advances on how we collect and analyse sensor data. Third, how technologies of automation could potentially impact our way of life in cities, such as how we expand our cities, how we manufacture and fabricate what we need and want, how we utilise urban data to navigate around a city to transport people and goods, or use urban data to make trusted decisions about a city.","Wang, Brydon T.",Automating Cities,809,7

However, internationally, there are many examples of smart city developments that have attracted criticism, concerns, and community backlash over issues such as data ethics, privacy, mass surveillance, commodification, and social control. In response, this chapter presents DataCare—a model for cities to practically implement technological sovereignty as a way to renew and maintain the social licence to operate smart city technology. Grounded in a critical review of the literature, the chapter argues that data collection and automation in smart cities must be more citizen and community-oriented. Informed by smart city developments in Toronto and Barcelona, the chapter introduces DataCare—a model for a dedicated facility hosted by the city and offered to citizens, communities, and businesses. The envisaged DataCare space can be tailored to raise awareness of data ethics, to run data literacy training seminars, to engage in participatory data analytics, and to speculate about city data futures. DataCare aims to increase data transparency and autonomy, showcase new business opportunities, and empower citizens and community.","Foth, Marcus; Anastasiu, Irina; Mann, Monique; Mitchell, Peta",Automating Cities,809,7

Thus, health policies are meant to recognise the interdependence of community health and these social conditions. This paper aims to conceptualise leisure activities and recreation facilities as valid social determinants of health variables, being veritable factors for promoting community health. The effects of physical activities, social interactions and environmental factors on communal health indices are examined by exploring the physical, health and tourism science literature to generate relevant insights. Application and implications for Nigerian communities are also conducted. Leisure activities and recreation facilities are identified as two major variables that are relevant to the social determinants of health framework. This paper recognises that health equity in communities is enhanced by the engagement of people in fun, activities, pleasure and entertainment. It establishes the critical link between leisure activities, recreation facilities and built environment on one hand and community health on the other hand. It emphasises that investments in infrastructure are a sustainable way of promoting community health and addressing health inequities. A strong case is made for Nigerian communities.","Balogun, Babatunde Abiodun",Handbook of Sustainable Development and Leisure Services,809,7

The development of Fab Cities and Maker Cities intersects with the construction of smart cities. The local circular economy focus of Fab Cities and Maker Cities also has a resonance with the planning of climate-resilient cities. Fab Cities and Maker Cities are aslo a means of addressing the focus on sustainable cities and communities in the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals 2015, and the push to implement the right to adequate housing in terms of human rights. Fab Cities and Maker Cities have also been helpful in providing a networked response to the coronavirus COVID-19 crisis. Section 1 looks at the Fab City Global Initiative-which has emerged out of the Barcelona Fab Lab. It considers the concept of a global network of Fab Cities. Section 2 focuses upon the grwoth of Maker Cities in the United States. It considers some of the opportunities and challenges in respect of this model. Section 3 examines the ambitious project of the United Arb Emirates to integrate additive manufacturing into its construction industry. Section 4 explores future applications of 3D printing in the context of military logistics; disaster relief; and space missions to the moon and Mars.","Rimmer, Matthew",Automating Cities,809,7

This contribution, firstly, highlights the theme of the urban-rural continuum (an intermediate and contradictory place, which epitomizes on-going contemporary transformations) in order to demonstrate that the contrast between urban and rural—although it has been used, since ancient times, on both analytical and design level—has not only been superseded, but is also, theoretically, inadequate for identifying the rural built environment. The link between agricultural and construction activities confirms the overcoming of this contrast; a reading in technological terms is proposed, with reference to the spheres of the product and the process, whilst recollecting its remote and deeply rooted cultural origins. The possible dual and contradictory character (vernacular or scholarly) of the rural built environment is illustrated with reference to the specificity of the bioclimatic aspects recognized in traditional buildings (“ante litteram sustainability”), highlighting how the relationship with the site-factor (microclimatic characteristics and local construction culture) was almost annulled in the twentieth century, also creating the basis for a widespread emergency for the quality of the buildings employed in agricultural activities. Touching upon the question of whether the rural building can be a typology distinct from other production buildings, this paper highlights the importance of the relationships with the socio-economic aspects of the agricultural sector, underlining the fact that the main identity for rural buildings in every age, in addition to the role that they play in the landscape, should be a stronger bond with the environmental elements, showing the centrality of the bioclimatic approach in updating the primordial interactions between agriculture and construction. Furthermore, the distinction between vernacular or scholarly character of the rural buildings prompted a reflection on the contemporary epistemological bases of the bioclimatic approach to general architectural design, which risks being ineffective whether it remains on an empirical level or if it is confined to a hyper-specialized niche. Finally, the bioclimatic approach is indicated as a common analytical and design methodological basis, useful for addressing the contradictory nature of the urban-rural continuum, in the framework of contemporary challenges.","Germanà, Maria Luisa",Bioclimatic Approaches in Urban and Building Design,809,7
