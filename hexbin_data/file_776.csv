32605,BISp Informationen,2020-05-15,"On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak a pandemic. As the evolution and implications of the COVID-19 crisis are still unfolding, we posit that exploring the experiences and strategic responses of Asian countries may shed light on ways to combat COVID-19 for the rest of the world. In this paper, we first articulate the importance of resilience, strategic agility, and entrepreneurship in the context of the fight against COVID-19. Then, with the focus on China, South Korea, and Singapore, we discuss the impact COVID-19 is having on economies and businesses, governmental support for businesses and societies, and implications for global supply chain disruptions. We hope that the global health system will recover quickly, and that the world economy will be revitalized with the contributions and collaboration of science (including social science), industry, and governments.","Liu, Yipeng; Lee, Jong Min; Lee, Celia",Asian Bus Manage,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7216126/,776
32606,dvs Informationen,2020-05-15,"On 1 March 2020, the amendments to the German Protection Against Infection Act that were introduced by the act to protect against measles and strengthen vaccination prevention (Measles Protection Act) entered into force. The reason for the changes is that the number of individuals with measles has significantly increased in recent years. To protect public health, the Measles Protection Act has implemented regulations requiring that persons in certain institutions must either have adequate protection against measles or have immunity to measles. In this article the current legal situation with regard to health care facilities is presented.","Lissel, P. M.",Z Rheumatol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7216568/,776
42773,Shot distribution in the NBA: did we see when 3-point shots became popular?,2020-12-03,"We propose a denotational semantic framework for deterministic dataflow and stream processing that encompasses a variety of existing streaming models. Our proposal is based on the idea that data streams, stream transformations, and stream-processing programs should be classified using types. The type of a data stream is captured formally by a monoid, an algebraic structure with a distinguished binary operation and a unit. The elements of a monoid model the finite fragments of a stream, the binary operation represents the concatenation of stream fragments, and the unit is the empty fragment. Stream transformations are modeled using monotone functions on streams, which we call stream transductions. These functions can be implemented using abstract machines with a potentially infinite state space, which we call stream transducers. This abstract typed framework of stream transductions and transducers can be used to (1) verify the correctness of streaming computations, that is, that an implementation adheres to the desired behavior, (2) prove the soundness of optimizing transformations, e.g. for parallelization and distribution, and (3) inform the design of programming models and query languages for stream processing. In particular, we show that several useful combinators can be supported by the full class of stream transductions and transducers: serial composition, parallel composition, and feedback composition.","Mamouras, Konstantinos",Programming Languages and Systems,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7702246/,776
