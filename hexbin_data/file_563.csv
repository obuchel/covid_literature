METHODS: Stable preterm babies weighing between 1 and 2 kg, on partial or full enteral feeds via gavage were randomized into gravity and feed rail feeding group, respectively. Ten nurses and 4 babies were paired to form 40 nurse-baby pairs for the study. Forty feeding events in each groups were recorded. RESULTS: The median duration of feeding in the feed rail group was 18.5 min compared to 15 min in nurse-led feeding (p = 0.34). Feeding rate corrected for bodyweight ranged between 0.8 and 2.3 mL/kg/min in the feed rail group compared to 2.5 and 8.9 mL/kg/min in the control (manual gravity feed) group. This difference in the feed rate variation was statistically significant (p value of <0.0001). The median feed rate with feedrail was 1.3 mL/min as compared to 4.1 mL/min with manual gravity feeds. During the feed rail feeding, nurses were hands-free for 80% of the time. CONCLUSION: Feed rail feeding results in slow, sustained, and minimal variation in gravity feeding at a rate of 1 to 2 mL/kg/min without affecting the feeding duration compared to manual nurse-led feeding.

As we have all seen, health preparedness and global health emergency preparedness frameworks are essential, as highlighted by the advent of COVID-19. Events such as these may be rare but are a perfect example of why engaging in health preparedness and response planning is essential. These novel types of viruses are not the only cause for the need for health preparedness, which extends to more standard planning of health systems, pandemic influenza plans and other unexpected but serious events such as the deliberate release of biological or chemical agents. This discussion will therefore review health preparedness, using the example of COVID-19, as well as reviewing the gaps identified and what more must be done at EU, national, regional and global levels to ensure health preparedness is effective to protect our societies.

In this regard, the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) is a common virulence factor among pathogenic bacteria of the genera Listeria, Mycobacterium and Streptococcus. Their N-terminal 22 amino acid peptides, GAPDH-L1 (Listeria), GAPDH-M1 (Mycobacterium) and GAPDH-S1 (Streptococcus), share 95–98.55% sequence homology, biochemical and MHC binding abilities and, therefore, are good candidates for universal vaccine designs. Here, we used dendritic cells (DC) as vaccine platforms to test GAPDH epitopes that conferred protection against Listeria monocytogenes, Mycobacterium marinum or Streptococcus pneumoniae in our search of epitopes for universal vaccines. DC loaded with GAPDH-L1, GAPDH-M1 or GAPDH-S1 peptides show high immunogenicity measured by the cellular DTH responses in mice, lacked toxicity and were capable of cross-protection immunity against mice infections with each one of the pathogens. Vaccine efficiency correlated with high titers of anti-GAPDH-L1 antibodies in sera of vaccinated mice, a Th1 cytokine pattern and high frequencies of GAPDH-L1-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and IFN-γ producers in the spleens. We concluded that GAPDH-L1 peptide was the best epitope for universal vaccines in the Listeria, Mycobacterium or Streptococcus taxonomic groups, whose pathogenic strains caused relevant morbidities in adults and especially in the elderly.","Salcines-Cuevas, David; Terán-Navarro, Hector; Calderón-Gonzalez, Ricardo; Torres-Rodriguez, Paula; Tobes, Raquel; Fresno, Manuel; Calvo-Montes, Jorge; Molino-Bernal, I.

With these premises, the aims of this study were to know the incidence and characteristics of COVID-19 in the ENEIDA cohort during the first wave of the pandemic; the outcomes among those under immunosuppressants/biologics for IBD; the risk factors for contracting the infection and poor outcomes; and the impact of the infection after three-month follow-up. METHODS: Prospective observational cohort study of all IBD patients with COVID-19 included in the ENEIDA registry (with 60.512 patients in that period) between March and July 2020, with at least 3 months of follow-up. Any patient with a confirmed (by PCR or SARS-CoV-2 serology) or probable (suggestive clinical picture) infection was considered as a case. RESULTS: A total of 484 patients with COVID-19 from 63 centres were included: 247 Crohn’s disease, 223 ulcerative colitis and 14 unclassified colitis; median age 52 years (IQR: 42–61), 48% women and 44% ≥1 comorbidity. Diagnosis was made by PCR: 63% and serology: 35%. The most frequent symptoms: fever (69%), followed by cough (63%) and asthenia (38%). During lockdown 78% followed strict isolation. 35% required hospital admission (ICU: 2.7%) and 12% fulfilled criteria for SIRS upon admission. 16 patients died from COVID-19 (mortality:3.3%). 12% stop IBD medication during COVID-19. At 3 months, taken into account all included cases, 76% were in remission of IBD. Male gender (OR 1.56; 95%CI:1–2.4, p=0.05), ≥40 years of age (OR 2.55; 95% CI:1.4–4.8; p=0.004), Charlson score ≥1 (OR 2.1; 95% CI:1.3–3.5; p=0.004), and systemic steroids <3 months before infection (OR 1.8; 95%CI:1–1.6; p= 0.032), were risk factors for hospitalisation due to COVID-19, while occupation considered of risk was actually protective (OR 0.58; 95%CI:0.3–0.99; p=0.046). A Charlson score ≥ 1 (OR 5.5; 95%CI:1.5–20.3; p=0.001) and the use of aminosalicylates at COVID-19 diagnosis (OR 4.6;95%CI:1.2–17; p=0.023) were associated with ICU admission. Age ≥60 years (OR 6.5; 95%CI:1.7–25.5; p=0.007) was the only risk factor for COVID-19 related death. CONCLUSION: IBD does not seem to worsen the prognosis of COVID-19, even when immunosuppressants and biological drugs are used. Age and comorbidity are the most important prognostic factors for more severe COVID-19 in IBD patients. The use of aminosalicylates and the risk of a worse outcome deserves a deeper analysis.

So far, the most efficient strategy to align assemblies of nanoparticles consists in a bottom-up approach by decorating block copolymer lamellae with nanoobjects. This well accomplished procedure is nonetheless limited by the thermodynamic constraints that govern copolymer assembly, the entropy of mixing as described by the Flory-Huggins solution theory supplemented by the critical influence of the volume fraction of the block components. Here we show that a completely different approach can lead to tunable 2D lamellar organization of nanoparticles with homopolymers only, on condition that few elementary rules are respected: 1) the polymer spontaneously allows a structural preorganization, 2) the polymer owns functional groups that interact with the nanoparticle surface, 3) the nanoparticles show a surface accessible for coordination.","Manai, Ghada; Houimel, Hend; Rigoulet, Mathilde; Gillet, Angélique; Fazzini, Pier-Francesco; Ibarra, Alfonso; Balor, Stéphanie; Roblin, Pierre; Esvan, Jérôme; Coppel, Yannick; Chaudret, Bruno; Bonduelle, Colin; Tricard, Simon",Nature communications,563,33

Secondary outcomes included change in total examination score and completion time.Results. No significant reduction in examination scores was observed as a result of eliminating backward navigation. The average time that students spent on a question was significantly reduced on two of the six examinations.Conclusion.

We performed a systematic review of the literature to determine the coagulation effects of TPE in patients receiving systemic anticoagulation. We searched MEDLINE, CINAHL, EMBASE, and Web of Science until June 2018 for studies combining controlled vocabulary and keywords related to therapeutic plasma exchange, plasmapheresis, anticoagulants, and therapy. The primary outcome was the effect of TPE on anti-Xa activity, activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), or international normalized ratio (INR). The secondary outcome was reports of post-TPE bleeding or thrombosis. A total of 1830 references were screened and eight studies identified. Our selected studies (five case reports and three case series) involved 23 patients and evaluated the effects of seven anticoagulants. Six studies of unfractionated heparin, low-molecular-weight heparins, and direct oral anticoagulants demonstrated an anti-Xa level decline. Two studies of unfractionated heparin and low-molecular-weight heparins showed an aPTT increase. One study of warfarin showed a post-TPE INR increase. Reports of post-TPE bleeding occurred in two patients and thrombosis in one. In patients receiving therapeutic anticoagulation, TPE is associated with anti-Xa activity decline and aPTT and INR increase. These coagulation changes do not appear to significantly increase bleeding or thrombotic risk.

In the current study, we explored its downstream regulation in luminal A/B breast tumors. Materials and Methods Bioinformatic prediction was performed using data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)-breast cancer (BRCA). Cellular and molecular studies were conducted using luminal A/B representative MCF-7 and BT-474 cell lines. Results ENST00000355610.8 (encoding MORC4a isoform) was the dominant transcript in breast cancer. ChIP-qPCR and dual-luciferase assay confirmed two STAT3-binding sites in the MID2 promoter in both MCF-7 and BT-474 cells. Co-IP confirmed an interaction between MORC4 and STAT3. ChIP-qPCR data indicated that MORC4 inhibition led to remarkably decreased enrichment of the STAT3-binding MID2 promoter segments. MORC4 overexpression significantly elevated BCL-2 expression in MCF-7 cells and increased their resistance to adriamycin (ADM), 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), and cisplatin (DDP). MID2 inhibition largely abrogated MORC4-induced drug-resistance. However, the drug-resistant phenotype was rescued by overexpressing MID2-MT that was resistant to MID2 siRNA. Conclusion This study revealed a novel regulatory mechanism of MORC4 on MID2 expression via STAT3-mediated transcriptional activation. This regulatory axis might confer increased chemoresistance to breast cancer cells.","Luo, Jing; Zeng, Shiyan; Tian, Chao",OncoTargets and therapy,563,1

Few information, dated back to almost two decades ago, exist as to whether a gluten-free diet (GFD) could reduce the islet-specific autoimmunity detected in patients at CD diagnosis. Aim of the study was to evaluate the impact of GFD on 31 patients who presented islet-specific autoimmunity at CD diagnosis. METHODS CD patient sera collected at diagnosis and throughout the GFD were analyzed for the main humoral autoantibodies so far identified in T1D, directed against one or more among insulin, glutamic-acid decarboxylase, tyrosine-phosphatase 2 and zinc cation-efflux transporter autoantigens. RESULTS GFD (median duration 39 months) was associated to a decrease or disappearance of the islet-specific autoantibodies in 71% of CD patients. Almost 80% of the patients who became autoantibody-negative during the GFD were positive for only one of the islet-specific autoimmune markers at CD diagnosis, with none of them developing diabetes. Conversely, 80% of the CD patients positive at diagnosis for ≥2 islet-specific autoantibodies were still positive after more than two years of GFD, with 25% of them developing T1D. CONCLUSIONS Various factors appear to influence, individually or in combination, the effects of the GFD on pancreatic islet-specific autoimmune response detected at CD diagnosis. These factors include the number of diabetes autoantibodies found at CD diagnosis, the adherence to the GFD, its duration and an asymptomatic clinical presentation of CD.

METHODS For the control group (n = 16), silicone 2.7-Fr catheters were placed via the right external jugular vein with the cutdown method. For the treatment group (n = 16), a mixture of 0.65 mg of paclitaxel and 1 mL of fibrin glue was infiltrated around the exposed vein after cutdown. After scheduled intervals (1, 2, 4, and 8 weeks), the vein segment was harvested and morphometric analysis was performed on cross-sections. RESULTS Proliferation of smooth muscle cell (SMC) was strongly suppressed in the treatment group, and the ratio of neointima to vein wall was significantly reduced in the treatment group (8 weeks; 0.63 ± 0.08 vs. 0.2 ± 0.08, P < 0.05). Luminal patency was significantly more preserved in the treatment group, and the luminal area was significantly wider in the paclitaxel-treated group compared to the control group (8 weeks; 1.91 ± 0.43 mm2 vs. 5.1 ± 0.43 mm2, P < 0.05). Mean SMC counts measured at 1 and 2 weeks after cutdown were significantly lower in the treatment group (2 weeks; 115 ± 22 vs. 62 ± 22).

RECENT FINDINGS Patients with IBD are not at increased risk of COVID-19 but several risk factors for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2 infection) have been identified, such as active IBD, obesity, and corticosteroid use. COVID-19 outcomes are similar among patients with IBD and the overall population. Although biologics have not been shown to increase the risk of severe COVID-19 complications, several risk factors have been associated with negative COVID-19 outcomes in patients with IBD, including older age, obesity, the presence of comorbidities, active disease, and corticosteroid use. IBD therapy should, therefore, be continued with the aim of attaining or maintaining remission, except for corticosteroids, which should be held or reduced to the minimal effective dose. Although it has been recommended that immunosuppressive therapy be held during a case of COVID-19, the half-lives of these drugs and data on the timing of restarting therapy limit the strength of these recommendations. We recommend COVID-19 vaccination for IBD patients whenever available, as benefits to the individual and to society outweigh the risks. SUMMARY As our understanding of SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 continues to evolve, we are learning more about its impact in patients with IBD and how to better manage patients in this setting. Managing IBD during this pandemic has also highlighted the importance of restructuring services in order to adapt to current and potential future outbreaks. The COVID-19 pandemic has transformed IBD care through the expansion of telemedicine and development of novel approaches to remote monitoring.","El Ouali, Sara; Rubin, David T; Cohen, Benjamin L; Regueiro, Miguel D; Rieder, Florian",Current opinion in gastroenterology,563,1

Radical changes occurred in the Italian NHS and thus in GI departments, as only urgent endoscopies were guaranteed. The study aimed to report how the demand for urgent endoscopy changed during the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy and to evaluate the appropriateness of urgent referrals in the Endoscopy Unit.Material and methods: Nation-wide, cross-sectional survey study in 54 Italian GI Units. Data were collected regarding urgent endoscopies (EGD, CS, ERCP) in two different time periods: March 2019 and March 2020.Results: Thirty-five (64.8%) GI endoscopy Units responded to the survey. The entity of reduction of overall urgent EGDs and CSs performed in March 2020 versus March 2019 was statistically significant: 541 versus 974 (-80%), p < .001 for EGD and 171 versus 265 (-55%), p < .008, for CS, respectively. No statistically significant reduction of urgent ERCP performed in March 2020 versus March 2019 was found. The increase in overall diagnostic yield for urgent EGD in March 2020 versus March 2019 was 7.3% (CI [0.028-0.117], p = .001). No statistically significant difference in diagnostic yield for CS between 2019 and 2020 was found.Conclusion: The study showed a statistically significant reduction of urgent EGD and CS performed during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, in March 2020, compared to March 2019. The diagnostic yield of urgent EGD performed in March 2020 was significantly higher than that of March 2019. No statistically significant difference was found in terms of diagnostic yield of urgent CS between March 2020 and March 2019.","Salerno, Raffaele; Conti, Clara Benedetta; De Silvestri, Annalisa; Campbell Davies, Sophia Elizabeth; Mezzina, Nicolò; Ardizzone, Sandro",Scandinavian journal of gastroenterology,563,24

Methods Large-sample statistical methods and proprietary data from the National Agricultural Workers Survey from 2000 to 2018 were used to assess factors associated with exposure to COVID-19 and vulnerabilities associated with medical complications. Results An aging workforce and increased access to health care within the crop worker population has been associated with a higher reported incidence of diabetes, asthma, and heart disease among workers over time. These trends confirm a vulnerable, but essential, workforce with higher risks for COVID-19 complications than would have been true of U.S. farmworkers as a group in earlier years. Conclusions Increasing age and disease burden in the U.S. agricultural labor force puts workers at increased risk for developing COVID-19 complications. Limits to field sanitation and housing quality inflate the probability of the development of COVID-19 hotbeds in rural communities that could further compromise the physical health of workers, the economic health of farm establishments, the agricultural supply-chain, and rural health capacities. Additional and more targeted worker protections may minimize public health and economic costs in the long run.","Fan, Maoyong; Pena, Anita Alves",Journal of agromedicine,563,7

This study compared endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle biopsy (EUS-FNB) to fine-needle aspiration (FNA) in assessing PanNETs. Patients and methods All pancreatic histology for PanNET between January 2009 and June 2017 was included if EUS sampling was performed prior to surgical resection. Ki67 and grade from FNA and FNB samples was compared to surgical histology using correlation coefficient and kappa values. Subgroup analysis was performed for purely solid lesions, lesions < 2 cm and FNB needle type. Results One hundred sixity-four patients had PanNET of which 57 underwent surgical resection. Thirty-five lesions underwent FNA and 26 FNB (4 had both) confirming PanNET. 23/ of 35 FNA samples reported Ki67/grading compared to all 26 FNB samples ( P = 0.0006). Compared to surgical histology, Ki67 on FNA correlated poorly overall (r = -0.08), in solid lesions (r = -0.102) and lesions < 2 cm (r = -0.149) whereas FNB correlated moderately overall (r = 0.65), in solid lesions (r = 0.64) and lesions < 2 cm (r = 0.61). Tumor grade showed poor agreement (kappa) with FNA overall (0.026), in solid lesions (0.044) and lesions < 2 cm (0.00) whereas FNB showed moderate-good agreement overall (0.474), in solid lesions (0.58) and lesions < 2 cm (0.745). Fork-tip FNB needles Ki67 showed strong correlation with surgical histology (r = 0.788) compared to reverse bevel FNB needles (r = 0.521). Both FNB needles showed moderate agreement with tumor grade. Conclusion FNB samples were significantly more likely than FNA to provide adequate material for Ki67/grading and showed a closer match to surgical histology.

Texture analysis might be an additional tool for the evaluation of Chest X-ray in patients with clinical suspicion of Covid-19 related pneumonia. OBJECTIVE To evaluate the diagnostic performance of texture analysis and machine learning models for the diagnosis of Covid-19 interstitial pneumonia in Chest X-ray images. METHODS Chest X-ray images were accessed from a publicly available repository (https://www.kaggle.com/tawsifurrahman/covid19-radiography-database). Lung areas were manually segmented using a polygonal regions of interest covering both lung areas, using MaZda, a freely available software for texture analysis. A total of 308 features per ROI was extracted. One hundred-ten Covid-19 Chest X-ray images were selected for the final analysis. RESULTS Six models, namely NB, GLM, DL, GBT, ANN and PLS-DA were selected and ensembled. According to Youden's index, the Covid-19 Ensemble Machine Learning Score showing the highest Area Under the Curve (0.971±0.015) was 132.57. Assuming this cut-off the Ensemble model performance was estimated evaluating both true and false positive/negative, resulting in 91.8% accuracy with 93% sensitivity and 90% specificity. Moving the cut-off value to -100, although the accuracy resulted lower (90.6%), the Ensemble Machine Learning showed 100% sensitivity, with 80% specificity. CONCLUSION Texture analysis of Chest X-ray images and machine learning algorithms may help in differentiating patients with Covid-19 pneumonia.

All genotypes were grown at the same location under the same field conditions and were fed to growing castrated crossbred pigs (initial body weight: 31.1 ± 6.95 kg) using a series of duplicate 3 × 3 Latin square designs. A basal ration, which was deficient in P, and 32 experimental rations containing 400 g/kg DM of the basal ration and 600 g/kg DM of the corresponding cereal grain were mixed. Pigs were kept in metabolism crates and the total collection method was used for separate faeces and urine collections with 7-d adaptation and 7-d collection periods. The mean ATTD of P was greater (p < 0.05) for wheat than for triticale, rye or barley (59.4%, 50.4%, 44.9% and 44.4%, respectively, for the mean of each grain species). Within-grain species differences (p < 0.05) among genotypes were obtained for ATTD of P of barley and triticale. The concentrations of ME of triticale and wheat were higher (p < 0.05) than that of barley and rye (16.1 and 16.2 vs. 14.9 and 14.8 MJ ME/kg DM, respectively). Differences in ME concentration among genotypes within a grain species (p < 0.05) were found for barley, triticale and wheat. No differences were found for rye. Compared to literature data the present study showed, in part, considerable differences in ATTD of P and ME concentration. These results should be taken into account for accurate pig ration formulation with regard to minimised P output and efficient use of ME. No significant relationships were detected between ATTD of P and phytic acid concentration or phytase activity in the grain genotypes in this study.","Schemmer, Ralph; Spillner, Claudia; Südekum, Karl-Heinz",Archives of animal nutrition,563,12

METHOD Patients were randomly given topical application of EGCG on the assigned lesions, with pimecrolimus being used as the control for twice a day over a 6-month treatment period. Responses to treatment were assessed based on the changes in VASI score for percentage reduction in body surface area and the PGA scores. RESULTS According to our results, both drugs were discovered to be markedly effective on repigmentation. The VASI of lesion had diminished from 1.19 ± 0.42 to 0.63 ± 0.38, in the EGCG-treated lesions, while from 1.18 ± 0.43 to 0.61 ± 0.36 in the pimecrolimus-treated lesions, and there was no statistically significant difference in VASI score between the EGCG-treated lesions and pimecrolimus-treated lesions (P = 0.755). Meanwhile, the mean PGA score on the EGCG applied side was 4.39 ± 2.23, while that was 4.43 ± 2.02 on the pimecrolimus applied side (P = 0.886). Furthermore, difference in the improvement degree between pimecrolimus side and EGCG side was not statistically significant (P = 0.845). Notably, no serious side effects were observed throughout the study.

This study performed a survival analysis stratified by the patients' QOL to elucidate its impact on survival. METHODS Patients who underwent resection or bypass of the small intestine/colon or ileostomy/colostomy for bowel obstruction caused by peritoneal dissemination of gastric cancer were included. Validated instruments (EuroQoL-5 Dimensions) were used to assess QOL at baseline and 2 weeks, 1 month, and 3 months following surgical palliation. Postoperative improvement in oral intake was also evaluated using the Gastric Outlet Obstruction Scoring System (GOOSS). Univariate and multivariate survival analyses were performed using baseline characteristics and changes in QOL and GOOSS scores 2 weeks after surgery to determine prognostic factors. RESULTS We enrolled 60 patients with a median survival time of 6.64 (95% CI 4.76-10.28) months. Patients who received postoperative chemotherapy and had lower baseline C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, higher baseline albumin levels, better baseline EuroQoL-5 Dimensions (EQ-5D) scores, and improved oral intake after palliative surgery exhibited significantly better survival. Multivariate analysis identified postoperative chemotherapy, lower baseline CRP levels, and improved oral intake as independent prognostic factors. CONCLUSIONS The current study revealed that baseline QOL and postoperative QOL changes did not affect survival. Moreover, improved oral intake, lower baseline CRP levels, and postoperative chemotherapy were significant prognostic factors in patients who underwent palliative surgery for advanced gastric cancer with MBO.","Kawabata, Ryohei; Fujitani, Kazumasa; Sakamaki, Kentaro; Ando, Masahiko; Ito, Yuichi; Tanizawa, Yutaka; Yamada, Takanobu; Hirao, Motohiro; Yamada, Makoto; Hihara, Jun; Ryoji,; Fukushima,; Choda, Yasuhiro; Kodera, Yasuhiro; Teshima, Shin; Shinohara, Hisashi; Kondo, Masato; Yoshida, Kazuhiro",Gastric cancer : official journal of the International Gastric Cancer Association and the Japanese Gastric Cancer Association,563,29

In this study, we examined graft rejection in three mouse models: 1) mismatch of male-specific minor Ags, 2) mismatch of minor Ags distinct from male-specific minor Ags, and 3) skin transplant. This study demonstrates that in the absence of pathogen-associated molecular patterns, Batf3-dependent dendritic cells elicit the rejection of cells and grafts expressing mismatched minor Ags.

Particle image velocimetry was used to characterize and visualize the interaction between the cough-generated multiphase flow and PV-induced flow in the inhalation zone of the thermal breathing manikin. A dose-response model for unsteady imperfectly mixed environment was used to estimate the reduction in infection risk of two common diseases that can be transmitted by airborne mode. PV was able to both reduce the peak aerosol concentration levels and shorten the exposure time at all the examined injection distances. PV could reduce the infection risks of two diseases, influenza A and tuberculosis, by between 27 and 65 per cent. The protection offered by PV is less effective at a distance of 1.75 m than the other distances, as shown in the risk assessment results, as the PV-generated flow was blown off by the cough-generated flow for the longest time.

By performing comparative genome analysis of nidovirales that contain the family of coronaviruses, we traced the origin of proofreading, surprisingly to the eukaryotic antiviral component ZNFX1. This common recent ancestor contributes two zinc finger (ZnF) motifs that are unique to viral exonuclease, segregating them from DNA proof-readers. Phylogenetic analyses indicate that following acquisition, genomes of coronaviruses retained and further fine-tuned proofreading exonuclease, whereas related families harbor substitution of key residues in ZnF1 motif concomitant to a reduction in their genome sizes. Structural modelling followed by simulation suggests the role of ZnF in RNA binding. Key ZnF residues strongly coevolve with replicase, and the helicase involved in duplex RNA unwinding. Hence, fidelity of replication in coronaviruses is a result of convergent evolution, that enables maintenance of genome stability akin to cellular proofreading systems.","Aswin, Keerthic; Ramachandran, Srinivasan; Natarajan, Vivek T",bioRxiv,563,1

Yet, long turnaround times result from using massively parallel high-throughput technologies as the analysis can only be performed after sequencing has finished. The interpretation of results can further be challenged by contaminations, clinically irrelevant sequences, and the sheer amount and complexity of the data. Results We implemented PathoLive, a real-time diagnostics pipeline for the detection of pathogens from clinical samples hours before sequencing has finished. Based on real-time alignment with HiL-ive2, mappings are scored with respect to common contaminations, low-entropy areas, and sequences of widespread, non-pathogenic organisms. The results are visualized using an interactive taxonomic tree that provides an easily interpretable overview of the relevance of hits. For a human plasma sample that was spiked in vitro with six pathogenic viruses, all agents were clearly detected after only 40 of 200 sequencing cycles. For a real-world sample from Sudan the results correctly indicated the presence of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic Fever Virus. In a second real-world dataset from the 2019 SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in Wuhan, we found the presence of a SARS Coronavirus as the most relevant hit without the novel virus reference genome being included in the database. For all samples, clinically irrelevant hits were correctly de-emphasized. Our approach is valuable to obtain fast and accurate NGS-based pathogen identifications and correctly prioritize and visualize them based on their clinical significance.

However, a causal impact of the gut microbiome on COVID-19 patient health has not been established. Here we provide evidence that gut microbiome dysbiosis is associated with translocation of bacteria into the blood during COVID-19, causing life-threatening secondary infections. Antibiotics and other treatments during COVID-19 can potentially confound microbiome associations. We therefore first demonstrate that the gut microbiome is directly affected by SARS-CoV-2 infection in a dose-dependent manner in a mouse model, causally linking viral infection and gut microbiome dysbiosis. Comparison with stool samples collected from 101 COVID-19 patients at two different clinical sites also revealed substantial gut microbiome dysbiosis, paralleling our observations in the animal model. Specifically, we observed blooms of opportunistic pathogenic bacterial genera known to include antimicrobial-resistant species in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Analysis of blood culture results testing for secondary microbial bloodstream infections with paired microbiome data obtained from these patients suggest that bacteria translocate from the gut into the systemic circulation of COVID-19 patients. These results are consistent with a direct role for gut microbiome dysbiosis in enabling dangerous secondary infections during COVID-19.","Venzon, Mericien; Bernard, Lucie; Klein, Jon; Axelrad, Jordan E.; Hussey, Grant A.; Sullivan, Alexis P.; Casanovas-Massana, Arnau; Noval, Maria G.; Valero-Jimenez, Ana M.; Gago, Juan; Wilder, Evan; Thorpe, Lorna E.; Littman, Dan R.; Dittmann, Meike; Stapleford, Kenneth A.; Shopsin, Bo; Torres, Victor J.; Ko, Albert I.; Iwasaki, Akiko; Cadwell, Ken; Schluter, Jonas",bioRxiv,563,8

Whilst uncommon in the developed world, cases continue to rise in developing nations with up to 200,000 new cases reported annually. 1We report a case of lepromatous leprosy in a parturient residing in Scotland. Case Report: A 26-year-old primigravida presented in early pregnancy following a history of nosebleeds and widespread rash. The patient was a sickle-cell carrier but was otherwise well with no allergies. A diagnosis of lepromatous leprosy with erythema nodosum reaction was made and treatment commenced with prednisolone and combination therapy with rifampicin, clofazimine and dapsone. The pregnancy was complicated by anaemia and thrombocytopaenia with mild splenomegaly. Anaemia was thought to be secondary to Dapsone-related haemolysis, and thrombocytopaenia was thought most likely to be gestational. She developed neuropathic leg pain and hypoaesthesia but this resolved during the pregnancy. Renal and liver function remained normal and there were no symptoms or signs of autonomic dysfunction with normal postural blood pressure readings and normal ECG. After multi-disciplinary discussion, induction of labour was planned due to concerns over fetal growth. The patient was screened for SARS-CoV-2 and this was positive, though the patient remained asymptomatic. The patient was not considered to be infectious and standard infection control procedures were observed. Anaesthetic options for analgesia in labour and anaesthesia for potential operative delivery were discussed at several occasions during pregnancy and ”OAA Labour Pains” translated information sheets were given to the patient. Following induction of labour, the patient had a spontaneous vaginal delivery with no anaesthetic intervention required. Discussion: Leprosy is uncommon in developed nations but may occur in the UK as the population becomes more diverse. Leprosy raises many potential challenges for the anaesthetist including;cutaneous changes (which may be of particular significance if occurring over sites of intravenous access or lower lumbar region), neuropathies, myopathies, autonomic dysfunction, haematological derangements (including anaemia, thrombocytopaenia and agranulocytosis) and liver and renal impairment. Drug therapies for leprosy may in themselves be associated with blood dyscrasias, hepatitis, psychosis, and peripheral neuropathies. Anaesthetic management should be informed by the presence of any complications, most notable thrombocytopaenia or peripheral neuropathies. The possibility of autonomic dysfunction should be considered regardless of which anaesthetic modality is chosen and care taken to actively manage hypotension. The patient’s SARS-CoV-2 status was a further factor influencing the risk-benefit assessment of anaesthetic options in this case.","Andrews, H.; Lake, K.; Kearns, R.",International Journal of Obstetric Anesthesia,563,13

However, the fever judgement has been achieved with the experienced quarantine officer. Due to recent spread of COVID 19, installation of thermography is expanding not only to quarantine at airports and ports, but also to hospitals, schools, retail stores, various facilities, and sports/event venues. Automated fever screening system with high accuracy are needed. Generally, a thermometer that measures axillary or sublingual temperature is used for body temperature measurement accurately, but this method takes time and contacts the subject to measure. So it is not suitable for the screening. On the other hand, thermography, which can measure the temperature of several persons in real time in a non-contact manner, satisfies screening requirements, but the body surface temperature of the exposed part such as the face that can be measured, is strongly affected by the environmental temperature and fluctuates. Therefore, it has a problem that it is difficult to determine the presence or absence of fever by setting a constant threshold value only. In order to realize the automation of screening with high accuracy and efficiency and make it easy for general users to understand, we will increase the measurement accuracy of the body surface temperature of thermography, identify the face and each landmark position from the image, and measure the temperature (body surface) of that part. The effects of the environment and individual difference are corrected from the temperature of multiple specific parts, and the high-precise body temperature estimation is carried out, and the algorithm is further improved. © 2021 SPIE","Tamura, T.; Uda, Y.; Murakami, M.; Tanji, E.; Kimura, S.",Infrared Technology and Applications XLVII 2021,563,1

A year of lockdown has changed the way of life in the city and negated its principal function as a place of various meetings and social interactions. The danger of long-term isolation and being cut-off from an urban lifestyle is not only a challenge facing individuals, but it also creates threats on various collective levels. Hindered interpersonal relations, stress, and the fear of another person lower the quality of life and may contribute to the development of mental diseases. Out of fear against coronavirus, part of the society has sought safety by moving out of the densely populated city centres. The dangerous results of these phenomena are shown by research based on the newest literature regarding the influence of COVID-19 and the lockdown on mental health, urban planning, and the long-term spatial effects of the pandemic such as the urban sprawl. The breakdown of the spatial structure, the loosening of the urban tissue, and urban sprawl are going to increase anthropopressure, inhibit access to mental health treatment, and will even further contribute to the isolation of part of the society. In addition, research has shown that urban structure loosening as a kind of distancing is not an effective method in the fight against the SARS-COV pandemic. Creating dense and effective cities through the appropriate management of development during and after the pandemic may be a key element that will facilitate the prevention of mental health deterioration and wellbeing.

Deep learning approaches have shown promise in medicine by transforming collected data into clinically significant information. Objective The objective of this research is to assess the performance of a deep learning algorithm to detect murmurs and clinically significant valvular heart disease using recordings from a commercial digital stethoscope platform. Methods Using over 34 hours of previously acquired and annotated heart sound recordings, we trained a deep neural network to detect murmurs. To test the algorithm, we enrolled 373 patients in a clinical study and collected recordings at the four primary auscultation locations. Ground truth was established using patient echocardiograms and annotations by three expert cardiologists. Results Algorithm performance for detecting murmurs has sensitivity and specificity of 76.3% and 91.4%, respectively. By omitting softer murmurs, those with grade 1, sensitivity increases to 90.0%. The algorithm detects moderate-to-severe or greater aortic stenosis with sensitivity of 97.5% and specificity of 77.7% and detects moderate-to-severe or greater mitral regurgitation with sensitivity of 64.0% and specificity of 90.5%. Conclusion The deep learning algorithm ability to detect murmurs and clinically significant aortic stenosis and mitral regurgitation is comparable to expert cardiologists.

They may be at heightened risk of overdose due to increased isolation, worsened mental health, and changes to the illicit drug supply. The province of British Columbia (BC) in Canada is anticipated to experience a record-breaking year of overdose deaths as over 1,500 people (32.9 deaths per 100,000) have died from overdose in 2020. In response, BC released new clinical guidelines in March to allow the prescribing of pharmaceutical alternatives aiming to reduce PWUD’s risk of overdose and contracting Covid-19.ObjectivesWe examined the risk and protective factors for overdose during these dual crises.

METHODS Blood samples of 22 SARS patients were studied, and 4 healthy blood samples were observed as negative controls. The white blood cells were collected from whole blood. The ultrastructural characteristics were observed by transmission electron microscopy. CD45RO antibody was used for pre-embedding immunoelectron microscopy. The SARS viral sequence was detected with real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). RESULTS Coronavirus-like particles were founded in the leukocytes in 6 of the 22 blood samples. Five of them gave positive results in the real-time PCR. The number of granulocytes was increased (P < 0.05) and that of lymphocytes was decreased (P < 0.05) respectively. Immunoelectron microscopy showed that CD45RO positive T lymphocyte decreased to 6% - 7%. Circulating lymphocytes had the highest percentage of infection. The morphologic characteristics of coronavirus-like particles were spherical or oval in shape, about 80 - 120 nm in diameter, with a dense round core and a clear halo around the core. A distinct membrane and club-shaped surface projections were seen in the periphery. The particles were located in the cytoplasm, the cisternae of endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus and vesicles. Virus entered cells by endocytosis or membrane fusion and was released through a budding process. CONCLUSION Our data suggested that lymphocytes, particularly T cells, were probably the target cells of SARS CoV. The viruses may actively infected the immune cells during SARS CoV acute infection phase and the destruction of target cells may be one of the important reasons for the death of the circulating leukocytes in SARS.","Zhong, Yan-feng; Gao, Xiao-ming; Wang, Sheng-lan; Xie, Zhi-gang; Ma, Yue; Fang, Wei-gang; Zou, Wan-zhong; Li, Xiu-lan; Zhang, Qian-ying; Wang, Wei; Zhao, Zhen-dong; Gu, Jiang",Zhonghua yi xue za zhi,563,17

Notably, hydroxychloroquine has been associated with a heterogeneous range of cutaneous and extra-cutaneous adverse events. We carried out a narrative review of the literature up to November 1st, 2020, related to the safety of hydroxychloroquine. In particular, cutaneous and extra-cutaneous adverse events associated with hydroxychloroquine were reviewed. The following databases were consulted: PubMed, Embase, Google Scholar and ResearchGate. The research of articles was conducted by using the following search terms: ''hydroxychloroquine,"" ''adverse event/effect,'' ""cutaneous"", ""skin"", ""cardiotoxicity"", ""retinopathy"", gastrointestinal and neurological toxicity"". The main indication for which hydroxychloroquine was used in the reports was an immune mediated disorder. Adverse events were described mostly in females over 50 years of age. The most common cutaneous adverse effect was maculopapular and erythematous rash occurring within 4 weeks of initiating hydroxychloroquine and disappearing within few weeks of discontinuation. Gastrointestinal symptoms and headache were the most frequent extracutaneous manifestations. Rarer cutaneous manifestations include hyperpigmentation, psoriasiform dermatitis, photodermatitis, stomatitis, melanonychia and hair loss. More severe conditions were acute generalised exanthematous pustulosis, drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms, Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis, and among extra-cutaneous adverse events cardiotoxicity and retinopathy. Since hydroxychloroquine is widely prescribed in rheumatology, it is important for rheumatologists to be familiar with its safety profile.","Gisondi, Paolo; Piaserico, Stefano; Bordin, Chiara; Bellinato, Francesco; Tozzi, Francesca; Alaibac, Mauro; Girolomoni, Giampiero; Naldi, Luigi",Clinical and experimental rheumatology,563,24

A retrospective study was conducted on 60 patients who underwent LS. And patients were divided into two groups. 30 patients (group A) received splenic pedicle transection with Endo-GIA procedure and in the other 30 patients (group B) underwent secondary splenic pedicle transection for LS. Perioperative outcome measures of each group were recorded, including operation duration, intraoperative blood loss, postoperative flatus pass time, postoperative complications, drainage duration, hospital cost and length of hospital stay. Surgeries were successfully achieved in 60 patients. The operative duration of group A was significantly shorter than that of group B. However, group B was significantly superior over Endo-GIA group in terms of the intraoperative blood loss, postoperative flatus pass time, drainage duration, length of hospital stay and total cost of hospital stays. No significant differences were observed in postoperative fever, ascites and hyperamylasemia between two groups. Both of these two approaches for LS are safe and feasible.

RNA 3 is able to replicate in tobacco plants transformed with the AIMV replicase genes P1 and P2 (P12 plants). Frameshifts or deletions in the P3 gene have little effect on RNA 3 accumulation in P12 protoplasts whereas such mutations in the CP gene result in a 100-fold reduction of plus-strand RNA 3 accumulation. When P12 protoplasts were inoculated with a mixture of a RNA 3 mutant with a deletion in the P3 gene and a mutant with a deletion in the CP gene, CP expressed by the P3 mutant was unable to upregulate plus-strand RNA accumulation of the CP mutant. However, when a wild-type CP gene and subgenomic promoter were inserted in a RNA 3 mutant with a defective CP gene, the mutant accumulated at wild-type levels. It is concluded that the function of CP in plus-strand RNA 3 accumulation acts in cis and cannot be complemented in trans. In P12 plants, P3 and CP mutants were able to complement each other at low and variable levels. This complementation in plants appeared to be correlated with the occurrence of recombination to wild-type RNA 3.","van der Vossen, E A; Reusken, C B; Bol, J F",Virology,563,15

The impact of these measures on non-COVID-19 patients remains largely unexplored. Aim This study aimed to investigate diagnostic and treatment delays related to isolation precautions, the associated patient outcome, and the predisposing risk factors for delays. Methods This observational study was conducted in seven Helsinki region hospitals during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Finland. The study used data on all non-COVID-19 inpatients, who were initially isolated due to suspected COVID-19, to estimate whether isolation precautions resulted in diagnostic or treatment delays. Results Out of 683 non-COVID-19 patients, 33 (4.8%) had delays related to isolation precautions. Clinical condition deteriorated non-fatally in seven (1.0%) patients. The following events were associated with an increased risk of treatment or a diagnostic delay: more than three ward transfers (P = 0.025);referral to an incorrect speciality in the emergency department (P = 0.004);more than three SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR tests performed (P = 0.022);and where cancer was the final diagnosis (P = 0.018). In contrast, lower respiratory tract symptoms (P = 0.013) decreased the risk. Conclusions The use of isolation precautions for patients who did not have COVID-19 had minor negative effects on patient outcomes. The present study underlines the importance of targeting diagnostic efforts to patients with unspecified symptoms and to those with a negative SARS-CoV-2 test result. Thorough investigations to achieve an accurate diagnosis improves the prognosis of patients and facilitates appropriate targeting of hospital resources.","Paajanen, J.; Mäkinen, L.

For instance, for the access control to office buildings, subway, commercial malls, etc., where a high amount of users may be present simultaneously, and keeping a strict record on each individual may be challenging. GPS tracking may not be available in many indoor cases; video surveillance may require expensive deployment (mainly due to the high-quality cameras and face recognition algorithms) and can be restrictive in case of low budget applications; RFID systems can be cumbersome and limited in the detection range. This information can later be used in many different scenarios. For instance, in case of earthquakes, fires, and accidents in general, the administration of the buildings can have a clear record of the people inside for victim searching activities. However, in the pandemic derived from the COVID-19 outbreak, a tracking that allows detecting of pedestrians in close range (a few meters) can be particularly useful to control the virus propagation. Hence, we propose a mobile clustering scheme where only a selected number of pedestrians (Cluster Heads) collect the information of the people around them (Cluster Members) in their trajectory inside the area of interest. Hence, a small number of transmissions are made to a control post, effectively limiting the collision probability and increasing the successful registration of people in close contact. Our proposal shows an increased success packet transmission probability and a reduced collision and idle slot probability, effectively improving the performance of the system compared to the case of direct transmissions from each node.","Rivero-Angeles, Mario E; Barrera-Figueroa, Víctor; Malfavón-Talavera, José E; García-Tejeda, Yunia V; Orea-Flores, Izlian Y; Jiménez-Ramírez, Omar; Bermúdez-Sosa, José A",,563,1

In this study, we have analyzed a cohort of patients with mild, moderate and severe disease. We performed flow cytometric studies and correlated the data with the clinical characteristics and clinical laboratory values of the patients. Both conventional and unsupervised data analyses concluded that patients with severe disease are characterized, among others, by a higher state of activation in all T cell subsets (CD4, CD8, double negative and T follicular helper cells), higher expression of perforin and granzyme B in cytotoxic cells, expansion of adaptive NK cells and the accumulation of activated and immature dysfunctional monocytes which are identified by a low expression of HLA-DR and an intriguing shift in the expression pattern of CD300 receptors. More importantly, correlation analysis showed a strong association between the alterations in the immune cells and the clinical signs of severity. These results indicate that patients with severe COVID-19 have a broad perturbation of their immune system, and they will help to understand the immunopathogenesis of COVID-19.","Zenarruzabeitia, Olatz; Astarloa-Pando, Gabirel; Terrén, Iñigo; Orrantia, Ane; Pérez-Garay, Raquel; Seijas-Betolaza, Iratxe; Nieto-Arana, Javier; Imaz-Ayo, Natale; Pérez-Fernández, Silvia; Arana-Arri, Eunate; Borrego, Francisco",Front Immunol,563,6

Here, air traffic and contrail cirrus changes are quantified for a European domain for March to August 2020 and compared to the same period in 2019. Traffic data show a 72 % reduction in flight distance compared with 2019. This paper investigates the induced contrail changes in a model study. The contrail model results depend on various methodological details as discussed in parameter studies. In the reference case, the reduced traffic caused a reduction in contrail length. The reduction is slightly stronger than expected from the traffic change because the weather conditions in 2020 were less favorable for contrail formation than in 2019. Contrail coverage over Europe with an optical depth larger than 0.1 decreased from 4.6 % in 2019 to 1.4 % in 2020;the total cirrus cover amount changed by 28 % to 25 %. The reduced contrail coverage caused 70 % less longwave and 73 % less shortwave radiative forcing but, because of various nonlinearities, only 54 % less net forcing in this case. The methods include recently developed models for performance parameters and soot emissions. The overall propulsion efficiency of the aircraft is about 20 % smaller than estimated in earlier studies, resulting in 3 % fewer contrails. Considerable sensitivity to soot emissions is found, highlighting fuel and engine importance. The contrail model includes a new approximate method to account for water vapor exchange between contrails and background air and for radiative forcing changes due to contrail–contrail overlap. The water vapor exchange reduces available ice supersaturation in the atmosphere, which is critical for contrail formation. Contrail–contrail overlap changes the computed radiative forcing considerably. Comparisons to satellite observations are described and discussed in a parallel publication.","Schumann, Ulrich Poll Ian Teoh Roger Koelle Rainer Spinielli Enrico Molloy Jarlath Koudis George S.; Baumann, Robert Bugliaro Luca Stettler Marc Voigt Christiane",Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,563,16

In this retrospective study, we present the changes in the indications for cesarean delivery (CD) and the birth weights of newborns after the lockdown in Wuhan. METHODS: A total of 3,432 pregnant women in the third trimester of their pregnancies who gave birth in our hospital from 23 January 2019 to 24 March 2020 were selected as the observation group, while 7,159 pregnant women who gave birth from 1 January 2019 to 22 January 2020 were selected as the control group; control group was matched using propensity score matching (PSM). A comparative analysis of the two groups was performed with the chi-square test, t test and rank sum test. RESULTS: The difference in the overall rate of CD between the two groups was not statistically significant (p<0.05). Among the indications for CD, CD on maternal request (CDMR) and fetal distress were also significantly more common in the observation group (p<0.05) than the control group. Furthermore, we found that the weight of newborns was significantly heavier in the observation group than in the control group when considering full-term or close-to-full-term births (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The results may provide useful information to management practices regarding pregnancy and childbirth after lockdown in other cities or countries, enabling better control of the rate of CD due to CDMR, reducing fetal distress, and controlling newborn weight. We recommend that pregnant women pay more attention to controlling the weight of newborns through diet and exercise.","Li, Min; Yin, Heng; Jin, Zhichun; Zhang, Huan; Leng, Bingjie; Luo, Yan; Zhao, Yun",PLoS One,563,15

The global frameworks that exist to strengthen core public health capacities lack coverage of several preparedness domains and do not provide mechanisms to interface with local intelligence. We designed and piloted a process, in collaboration with three National Public Health Institutes (NPHIs) in Ethiopia, Nigeria and Pakistan, to identify potential preparedness indicators that exist in a myriad of frameworks and tools in varying local institutions. Following a desk-based systematic search and expert consultations, indicators were extracted from existing national and subnational health security-relevant frameworks and prioritised in a multi-stakeholder two-round Delphi process. Eighty-six indicators in Ethiopia, 87 indicators in Nigeria and 51 indicators in Pakistan were assessed to be valid, relevant and feasible. From these, 14-16 indicators were prioritised in each of the three countries for consideration in monitoring and evaluation tools. Priority indicators consistently included private sector metrics, subnational capacities, availability and capacity for electronic surveillance, measures of timeliness for routine reporting, data quality scores and data related to internally displaced persons and returnees.

Notably, a total of 42 circRNAs were significantly dysregulated, wherein 17 were up-regulated and 25 were down-regulated following infection at multiple phases. The gene ontology and KEGG enrichment analyses revealed that the parental genes of circRNAs were mainly involved in immune and inflammatory responses. Further, the RNA binding protein (RBP) prediction analysis indicated that the dysregulated circRNAs could regulate mRNA stability, immunity, cell death by binding specific proteins. Additionally, the circRNA-miRNA-gene network analysis showed that circRNAs indirectly regulated gene expression by absorbing their targeted miRNAs.

Global studies have indicated that the length of hospitalisation depends on different factors, such as the time elapsed from exposure to symptom onset, and from symptom onset to hospital admission, as well as specificities of the country under study. The goal of this paper is to identify factors associated with the median duration of hospital stays of COVID-19 patients during the second COVID-19 wave that hit Vietnam from 5 March to 8 April 2020. METHOD: We used retrospective data on 133 hospitalised patients with COVID-19 recorded over at least two weeks during the study period. The Cox proportional-hazards regression model was applied to determine the potential risk factors associated with length of hospital stay. RESULTS: There were 65 (48.9%) females, 98 (73.7%) patients 48 years old or younger, 15 (11.3%) persons with comorbidities, 21 (16.0%) severely ill patients and 5 (3.8%) individuals with life-threatening conditions. Eighty-two (61.7%) patients were discharged after testing negative for the SARS-CoV-2 virus, 51 were still in the hospital at the end of the study period and none died. The median duration of stay in a hospital was 21 (IQR: 16-34) days. The multivariable Cox regression model showed that age, residence and sources of contamination were significantly associated with longer duration of hospitalisation. CONCLUSION: A close look at how long COVID-19 patients stayed in the hospital could provide an overview of their treatment process in Vietnam, and support the country's National Steering Committee on COVID-19 Prevention and Control in the efficient allocation of resources over the next stages of the COVID-19 prevention period.","Thai, Pham Quang; Toan, Do Thi Thanh; Son, Dinh Thai; Van, Hoang Thi Hai; Minh, Luu Ngoc; Hung, Le Xuan; Toan, Ngo Van; Hoat, Luu Ngoc; Luong, Duong Huy; Khue, Luong Ngoc; Khoa, Nguyen Trong; Huong, Le Thi",Epidemiol Infect,563,29

High TGE yields are heavily dependent on efficient delivery of plasmid DNA across both the plasma and nuclear membranes. Here, we harness the protein nucleoside diphosphate kinase (NDPK-A) that contains a nuclear localisation signal (NLS) to enhance DNA delivery into the nucleus of CHO cells. We show that co-expression of NDPK-A during transient expression results in improved transfection efficiency in CHO cells, presumably due to enhanced transportation of plasmid DNA into the nucleus via the nuclear pore complex. Furthermore, introduction of the Epstein Barr Nuclear Antigen-1 (EBNA-1), a protein that is capable of inducing extrachromosomal maintenance, when coupled with complementary oriP elements on a transient plasmid, was utilised to reduce the effect of plasmid dilution. Whilst there was attenuated growth upon introduction of the EBNA-1 system into CHO cells, when both NDPK-A nuclear import and EBNA-1 mediated technologies were employed together this resulted in enhanced transient recombinant protein yields superior to those generated using either approach independently, including when expressing the complex SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) glycoprotein.","Budge, J.

This can have significant implications when cattle are exposed to pesticide residues in feed. Recent studies indicate that the fungicide prochloraz activates the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) pathway, increasing bovine ABCG2 (bABCG2) gene expression and efflux activity. This could enhance the accumulation of bABCG2 substrates in dairy milk, impacting pesticide risk assessment. We therefore investigated whether 13 commonly used pesticides in Europe are inducers of AhR and bABCG2 activity. MDCKII cells expressing mammary bABCG2 were incubated with pesticides for up to 72 h. To reflect an in vivo situation, applied pesticide concentrations corresponded to the maximum residue levels (MRLs) permitted in bovine fat or muscle. AhR activation was ascertained through CYP1A mRNA expression and enzyme activity, measured by qPCR and 7-ethoxyresorufin-&#927;-deethylase (EROD) assay, respectively. Pesticide-mediated increase of bABCG2 efflux activity was assessed using the Hoechst 33342 accumulation assay. For all assays, the known AhR-activating pesticide prochloraz served as a positive control, while the non-activating tolclofos-methyl provided the negative control. At 10-fold MRL concentrations, chlorpyrifos-methyl, diflufenican, ioxynil, rimsulfuron, and tebuconazole significantly increased CYP1A1 mRNA levels, CYP1A activity, and bABCG2 efflux activity compared to the vehicle control. In contrast, dimethoate, dimethomorph, glyphosate, iprodione, methiocarb and thiacloprid had no impact on AhR-mediated CYP1A1 mRNA levels, CYP1A activity or bABCG2 efflux. In conclusion, the MDCKII-bABCG2 cell model proved an appropriate tool for identifying AhR- and bABCG2-inducing pesticides. This provides an in vitro approach that could reduce the number of animals required in pesticide approval studies.","Kuhnert, Lydia; Giantin, Mery; Dacasto, Mauro; Halwachs, Sandra; Honscha, Walther",PLoS One,563,15

Data on clinical symptoms of pediatric inpatients with COVID-19 infection were unclear. The aim of study was to investigate the clinical features of pediatric inpatients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library were searched to seek for studies providing details on pediatric inpatients with SARS-CoV-2 infection which were published from 1st January to 21st April 2020. Studies with more than five pediatric inpatients were included in our meta-analysis.This study was registered in the PROSPERO database (CRD42020183550). As the results shown, fever (46%) and cough (42%) were the main clinical characters of pediatric inpatients with SARS-CoV-2 infection and the other clinical characters, such as diarrhea, vomiting, nasal congestion, and fatigue account for 10% in pediatric inpatients. The proportion of asymptomatic cases was 0.42 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.27-0.59) and severe cases was 0.03 (95% CI: 0.01-0.06). For the laboratory result, leukopenia (21%) and lymphocytosis (22%) were the mainly indicators for pediatric inpatients, followed by high aspartate aminotransferase (19%), lymphopenia (16%), high alanine aminotransferase (15%), high C-reactive protein (17%), leukocytosis (13%), high D-dimer (12%) and high creatine kinase-MB (5%). Regard to chest imaging features, unilateral and bilateral accounts for 22% in pediatric inpatients, respectively. In conclusion, compared with adult inpatients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, the pediatric inpatients had mild clinical characters, lab test indicators, and chest imaging features. More clinical studies focus on the pediatric patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection in other countries should be conducted.","Ma, Xuefeng; Liu, Shousheng; Chen, Lizhen; Zhuang, Likun; Zhang, Jie; Xin, Yongning",J Med Virol,563,26

Patients admitted to a general hospital with COVID-19 are at a higher risk for developing or exacerbating various psychiatric disorders, due to the virus brain tropism and associated psychosocial factors. However, there are still limited data regarding the psychiatric needs and mental health care of these patients. The present study seeks to evaluate the changes in liaison psychiatry, patients’ characteristics and outcomes, brought on by SARS-CoV-2.MethodWe retrospectively analyzed liaison psychiatry patients’ characteristics during the second wave of COVID-19 pandemic, between October and December 2020, in comparison with the same trimester pre-COVID-19 in 2019.ResultAt admission to hospital, we found no differences between liaison psychiatry pre-COVID-19 (n = 96) and COVID-19 period (n = 114) groups, for age (p = 0.35), gender (p = 0.96), or hospital resource utilization in the previous year : number of hospital admissions (p = .40), Accident and Emergency presentations (p = 0.61), outpatients clinics (p = 0.20). There was, however, a significant association between pre-COVID-19 vs COVID-19 period groups and psychiatric diagnosis during hospitalization (Χ2(5) = 11.56, p = 0.04), influencing overall respective rates of delirium/dementias (29.2 vs 42.1 %), mood disorders (18.8 vs 26.3 %), anxiety and stress related disorders (22.9 vs 14.0 %), psychoactive substance use disorders (12.5 Vs 9.6 %) and psychotic disorders (10.4 vs 2.6 %). Mortality rate in pre-COVID-19 Vs COVID-19 period increased from 5.2 % to 15.8 % (Χ2(1) = 5.98, p = 0.01), mostly due to increased mortality in COVID-19 patients (7.3 vs 30.3 %, p &lt; 0.001). Referrals to liaison psychiatry increased by 18.8 % during the COVID-19 period, 28.8 % of referred patients were positive for SARS-CoV-2 and time to referral was positively correlated with hospital length of stay (ρ = 0.60, p &lt; 0.001). In the COVID-19 period, fewer patients were referred to outpatient psychiatric follow-up after discharge from hospital (p &lt; 0.001), and delayed discharges for social reasons were of shorter duration (p = 0.001).ConclusionOur findings are consistent with emerging data on comorbid or superimposed mental illness in hospitalized patients with COVID-19, showing a strong impact in neuropsychiatric mani-festations, clinical prognosis and mortality, as well as clinical management. Consideration should also be given to adequate staffing of psychiatry liaison services during the pandemic, in order to attend and safely manage general hospital inpatients mental health needs.","Passos, Frederica Constante Miguel Delgado André Maria João Heitor",BJPsych Open,563,1

The external validation of their performance is needed before use in clinical routine practice. Our study aims at assessing the analytical and clinical performance of two enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay tests detecting antibodies directed against the virus nucleocapsid protein: The NovaLisa SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin G (IgG), immunoglobulin A (IgA), and immunoglobulin M (IgM) test (NovaTec) allowing a separate detection of each antibody and the Platelia SARS-CoV-2 Total Ab test (Bio-Rad) detecting total antibodies (IgM, IgA, and IgG). Two-hundred and eight coronavirus disease 2019 samples from 48 quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) confirmed patients were used to perform the sensitivity analysis. Non-SARS-CoV-2 sera (n = 79) with a potential cross-reaction to SARS-CoV-2 immunoassays were included in the specificity analysis. In addition, using receiver operator characteristic curves, adapted cut-off for improvement of the performances were proposed. The kinetics of these antibodies was also assessed over 8 weeks. Two weeks after the RT-qPCR positive detection, the NovaLisa test shows a sensitivity and specificity of 94.9% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 83.1%-98.6%) and 96.2% (95% CI: 89.4%-98.7%) for IgG, of 89.7% (95% CI: 76.4%-95.9%) and 98.7% (95% CI: 93.2%-98.8%) for IgA, and of 48.7% (95% CI: 33.9%-63.8%) and 98.7% (95% CI: 93.2%-99.8%) for IgM.

STARLINER aimed to characterise disease behaviour in patients with suspected ILD during the peri-diagnostic period using real-time home-based assessments. METHODS: STARLINER (NCT03261037) was an international, multicentre study. Patients &#8805; 50 years old with suspected ILD were followed throughout the peri-diagnostic period, consisting of a pre-diagnostic period (from enrolment to diagnosis) and a post-diagnostic period (from diagnosis to treatment initiation). Study length was variable (&#8804; 18 months). The primary endpoint was time-adjusted semi-annual forced vital capacity (FVC) change measured during the peri-diagnostic period using daily home spirometry in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Secondary outcomes included changes in FVC (home spirometry) in patients with non-IPF ILD, changes in FVC (site spirometry), changes in physical functional capacity measured by daily home accelerometry and site 6-min walk distance (6MWD), and changes in patient-reported outcomes (PROs) in IPF or non-IPF ILD. RESULTS: Of the 178 patients enrolled in the study, 68 patients were diagnosed with IPF, 62 patients were diagnosed with non-IPF ILD, 9 patients received a non-ILD diagnosis and 39 patients did not receive a diagnosis. Technical and analytical issues led to problems in applying the prespecified linear regression model to analyse the home FVC data. Time-adjusted median (quartile [Q]1, Q3) semi-annual FVC change during the peri-diagnostic period measured using home and site spirometry, respectively, was - 147.7 (- 723.8, 376.2) ml and - 149.0 (- 314.6, 163.9) ml for IPF and 19.1 (- 194.9, 519.0) ml and - 23.4 (- 117.9, 133.5) ml in non-IPF ILD. A greater decline in steps per day was observed for IPF versus non-IPF ILD, whereas an increase in 6MWD was observed for patients with IPF versus a decline in 6MWD for patients with non-IPF ILD. No clear patterns of disease behaviour were observed for IPF versus non-IPF ILD for PROs. CONCLUSIONS: Despite home spirometry being feasible for most patients and centres, technical and analytical challenges in the home-based assessments prevented firm conclusions regarding disease behaviour. This highlights that further optimisation of the technology and analysis methods is required before widespread implementation.

Three additional farms were recruited via a press release published in agricultural newsletters. Of 76 farms contacted, 37 chose to participate in this study from June to July 2020. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, dairies have implemented or increased biosecurity measures and COVID-19 precautions. Dairies reported adequate personal protective equipment for their workers, though face masks were not required on most dairies (n = 32, 86%). Producers were concerned about the safety of their families, maintaining a healthy workforce, and keeping their farms profitable. Access to healthcare was not perceived to be an issue for their workers. One-quarter of dairies reported COVID-19 infections on their farms. Even though the majority had an isolation protocol in place if someone on the farm were to become ill, less than half of respondents felt their farm was protected against COVID-19. Two-thirds of producers have not had to decrease production, and a majority of operations have not furloughed or terminated employees due to COVID-19. Our data suggest that dairy farms in Minnesota and Wisconsin have implemented biosecurity and safety measures in response to COVID-19. These measures can be improved. Farms would benefit from additional guidance and education on implementation of personal protective measures and disease prevention strategies to keep workers employed and safe.","Yung, Mung Ting; Vázquez, RosaI Chela; Liebman, Amy; Brihn, Auguste; Olson, Anna; Loken, Delaney; Contreras-Smith, Ana; Bender, Jeff; Kirsch, Jonathan D",J Agromedicine,563,24

In order to determine appropriate vaccine design and delivery systems, or to identify suitable immunostimulatory methods to combat these infections, a detailed understanding of the immune cell populations present at clinically relevant sites is key. Few studies have assessed the immune cell composition of the neonatal calf lung and comparisons with circulating immune cells in the blood are lacking. We describe immune cell populations present in the peripheral blood, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid and lung tissue of young disease-free calves. Flow cytometric analysis revealed significant differences in cell subset distribution between the peripheral blood and respiratory tract, and between compartments within the respiratory tract. Notably, whereas WC1+ Î³Î´ TCR + T lymphocytes dominate the peripheral blood, both the BAL fluid and lung tissue contained a high proportion of myeloid cells which expressed CD14 and CD172a (SIRP&#945;). Very low numbers of tissue myeloid cells expressed MHC Class II in comparison to circulating myeloid cells in the blood. Respiratory tract tissues had low frequencies of CD4+ and CD8 + T lymphocytes, which were significantly lower than in the blood. Differences in the proportion of NKp46+ natural killer cells were also observed between tissue compartments. In order to target vaccines or immunostimulatory therapeutics appropriately, these differences in immune cell populations in tissue compartments should be taken into consideration.","Kolar, Quinn K; Waddell, Lindsey A; Raper, Anna; Rocchi, Mara S; Shaw, Darren J; Corbishley, Alexander; Hope, Jayne C",Vet Immunol Immunopathol,563,18

This virus causes CoV disease-19 (COVID-19), which has been proven a global pandemic leading to a major outbreak. As of June 19, 2020, the data from the World Health Organization (WHO) showed more than 8.7 million confirmed cases in over 200 countries/regions. The WHO has declared COVID-19 as the sixth public health emergency of international concern on January 30, 2020. CoVs cause illnesses that range in severity from the common cold to severe respiratory illnesses and death. Nevertheless, with technological advances and imperative lessons gained from prior outbreaks, humankind is better outfitted to deal with the latest emerging group of CoVs.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Training courses on digital health consultation would be given to participating healthcare workers. The trainees would be trained on all aspects of dental hygiene including precautions, tooth brushing techniques, and oral care. During the 2-day-long course, lady health workers will be taught various tooth brushing techniques, as well as basic instructions about oral hygiene and how to address queries of people regarding oral health. They will also get guidance about the various multimedia softwares in the phone and how to use them. The study would also include teledentistry consultation as a real-time patient learning tool for patients, healthcare workers, and trainees. RESULTS: Results will be made available when the trial has been completed in 2021. The program will be evaluated by assessing its usability, acceptability, knowledge, and satisfaction of users. CONCLUSION: The protocol is designed to illustrate the underlying concept that a more reliable and robust model can be built through creating interactive communities of practice for consumers of telehealth in dental education. The Telehealth Skills Coaching and Delivery Initiative would incorporate and test a technically oriented paradigm of Internet-based medical education for vertically incorporated, community-based learning environments. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Teledentistry has the ability to expand access to oral health care, increase the provision of oral health care, and decrease costs. In view of the immense advances made in this field, teledentistry can continue to promote specialized health care in the remotest corners of the world. Many countries have already embraced virtual health care (telemedicine) in the face of an increase in cases of COVID-19;however, teledentistry has yet to play its role in this pandemic by enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of dental treatment. In the case of LMICs such as Pakistan, which lack advanced technologies such as teledentistry within their national healthcare network, the COVID-19 pandemic is a challenge to introduce the requisite legislative changes to promote the widespread use of teledentistry.","Mahdi, S.

Our hospital, which is located in the immediate vicinity, reacted very quickly in addition to adapting patient care by implementing an organizational structure for recording SARS-CoV-2-positive employees, patients and their contact persons. OBJECTIVES: The infections recorded in contact tracing were analysed and, based on an exemplary outbreak, infection chains and follow-up processes were evaluated. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Comprehensive data on contact types, oropharyngeal swab results for SARS-CoV­2 and quarantine days were documented and retrospectively evaluated using a self-developed database. RESULTS: Of the 568 employees recorded by in-house contact tracing, 32 employees (1.2%, nâ¯= 2567) were detected as SARS-CoV­2 positive. Of those, 50% (nâ¯= 16) tested positive due to contact tracing, 15.6% (nâ¯= 5) were recorded by routine smears and 34.4% (nâ¯= 11) were returning travellers. The variable PCR results of the control smears from these positive employees were noticeable. In 18.8% (nâ¯= 6) of the initially negative control smears, positive PCR results were found in the following control smear. The inhouse contact tracing team was able to detect infection clusters on non-COVID-19 wards at an early stage and, together with clinical hygiene and the public health department, initiated comprehensive measures to limit the spread of the virus. Infection chains could thus be interrupted. CONCLUSION: The work of the clinic's own contact tracing unit has proven to be an essential part of clinical pandemic management not least against the background of new waves of infection and is indispensable for the detection of local infection clusters.","Quacken, Florian; Greiffendorf, Ingo; Ropertz, Susanne; Peters, David; Bergrath, Sebastian; Aretz, Sabine; Lahm, Andreas; Pesch, Alexander; Wimmer-Dahmen, Marie-Luise; Graeven, Ullrich",Bundesgesundheitsblatt Gesundheitsforschung Gesundheitsschutz,563,24

Un análisis comparativo 2019-2020,17.045803,-0.3629992,2021,"BACKGROUND: Development and dissemination of public health (PH) guidance to healthcare organizations and the general public (e.g., businesses, schools, individuals) during emergencies like the COVID-19 pandemic is vital for policy, clinical, and public decision-making. Yet, the rapidly evolving nature of these events poses significant challenges for guidance development and dissemination strategies predicated on well-understood concepts and clearly defined access and distribution pathways. Taxonomies are an important but underutilized tool for guidance authoring, dissemination and updating in such dynamic scenarios. OBJECTIVE: To design a rapid, semi-automated method for sampling and developing a PH guidance taxonomy using widely available Web crawling tools and streamlined manual content analysis. METHODS: Iterative samples of guidance documents were taken from four state PH agency websites, the US Center for Disease Control and Prevention, and the World Health Organization. Documents were used to derive and refine a preliminary taxonomy of COVID-19 PH guidance via content analysis. RESULTS: Eight iterations of guidance document sampling and taxonomy revisions were performed, with a final corpus of 226 documents. The preliminary taxonomy contains 110 branches distributed between three major domains: stakeholders (24 branches), settings (25 branches) and topics (61 branches). Thematic saturation measures indicated rapid saturation (&#8804;5% change) for the domains of ""stakeholders"" and ""settings"", and ""topic""-related branches for clinical decision-making. Branches related to business reopening and economic consequences remained dynamic throughout sampling iterations. CONCLUSION: The PH guidance taxonomy can support public health agencies by aligning guidance development with curation and indexing strategies; supporting targeted dissemination; increasing the speed of updates; and enhancing public-facing guidance repositories and information retrieval tools. Taxonomies are essential to support knowledge management activities during rapidly evolving scenarios such as disease outbreaks and natural disasters.","Taber, Peter; Staes, Catherine J; Phengphoo, Saifon; Rocha, Elisa; Lam, Adria; Del Fiol, Guilherme; Maviglia, Saverio M; Rocha, Roberto A",J Biomed Inform,563,13

Comparison was made between individuals who were previously infected with the virus, those who received one dose of inoculation with the vaccine, and individuals that were neither infected or vaccinated. The study results indicate that those who were previously infected with the COVID-19 virus were less careful about mask wearing (18.8%) and social distancing (29.7%), as compared to the other examined groups (regarding mask wearing, 8.2% and 11.6% respectively, and with regard to social distancing 12.8% and 19.2%), and may require targeted risk communication campaigns to address this population.

However, there is still no consensus on which of these methods is superior to the other. Therefore, the present meta-analysis was designed to answer to the question whether CT scan can be used in diagnosis of COVID-19 or not. Methods: Searches were performed in Medline, Embase, Scopus, and Web of Science databases until the end of April 2020. Two researchers gathered the data of diagnostic accuracy studies that had attempted to evaluate sensitivity and specificity of CT scan in diagnosis of COVID-19. Results: Data of 9 studies were included. Area under the curve of ground glass opacity (GGO), consolidation, pleural effusion, other CT features, and simultaneous observation of GGO with other CT features was 0.64 (95% CI 0.60-0.69), 0.30 (95% CI 0.26-0.34), 0.60 (95% CI 0.56-0.64), 0.61 (95% CI 0.56-0.65), and 0.90 (95% CI 0.87-0.92), respectively. Sensitivity and specificity of simultaneous observation of GGO with other CT scan features was higher than all of the other signs. Sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic odds ratio of this sign was calculated to be 0.90, 0.89, and 20, respectively. Conclusion: Simultaneous observation of GGO and other features of viral pneumonia in CT scan had optimum performance in detection of COVID-19. However, it is suggested to make the final diagnosis based on both CT scan and RT-PCR, as none of the two diagnostic modalities are reliable alone.","Hossein, Hasti; Ali, Kosar Mohamed; Hosseini, Mostafa; Sarveazad, Arash; Safari, Saeed; Yousefifard, Mahmoud",Clin Transl Imaging,563,31

People with physical disabilities might be particularly likely to be negatively affected, but evidence is scarce. Our aim was to evaluate the emotional and social experience of older people with physical disabilities during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic in England. METHODS: In this longitudinal cohort study, we analysed data from the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing collected in 2018-19 and June-July, 2020, from participants aged 52 years and older and living in England. Physical disability was defined as impairment in basic and instrumental activities of daily living (ADL) and impaired mobility. Depression, anxiety, loneliness, quality of life, sleep quality, and amount of real-time and written social contact were assessed online or by computer-assisted telephone interviews. Comparisons of experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic of people with and without a physical disability were adjusted statistically for pre-pandemic outcome measures, age, sex, wealth, ethnicity, presence of a spouse or partner, number of people in the household, and chronic pain. All participants with full data available for both surveys were included in the analyses. FINDINGS: Between June 3 and July 26, 2020, 5820 participants responded, 4887 of whom had full data available for both the pre-pandemic measures and the COVID-19 survey and were included in the analysis. During the COVID-19 pandemic, significantly more people with ADL impairment had clinically significant symptoms of depression (odds ratio 1·78 [95% CI 1·44-2·19]; p<0·0001), anxiety (2·23 [1·72-2·89]; p<0·0001), and loneliness (1·52 [1·26-1·84]; p<0·0001) than people without ADL impairment. Significantly more people with ADL impairment also had impaired sleep quality (1·44 [1·20-1·72]; p<0·0001) and poor quality of life than people without ADL impairment. The results were similar when disability was defined by impaired mobility. People with ADL impairment had less frequent real-time contact (0·70 [0·55-0·89]; p=0·0037) and written social contact (0·54 [0·45-0·64]; p<0·0001) with family than people without ADL impairment. Results for social contact were similar when disability was defined by impaired mobility. INTERPRETATION: People with physical disability might be at particular risk for emotional distress, poor quality of life, and low wellbeing during the COVID-19 pandemic, highlighting the need for additional support and targeted mental health services.

Increases in incidence among adults aged &#8805;60 years, who might be more susceptible to severe COVID-19-related illness, have followed increases in younger adults (aged 20-39 years) by an average of 8.7 days (3). Institutions of higher education (colleges and universities) have been identified as settings where incidence among young adults increased during August (4,5). Understanding the extent to which these settings have affected county-level COVID-19 incidence can inform ongoing college and university operations and future planning. To evaluate the effect of large colleges or universities and school instructional format* (remote or in-person) on COVID-19 incidence, start dates and instructional formats for the fall 2020 semester were identified for all not-for-profit large U.S. colleges and universities (&#8805;20,000 total enrolled students). Among counties with large colleges and universities (university counties) included in the analysis, remote-instruction university counties (22) experienced a 17.9% decline in mean COVID-19 incidence during the 21 days before through 21 days after the start of classes (from 17.9 to 14.7 cases per 100,000), and in-person instruction university counties (79) experienced a 56.2% increase in COVID-19 incidence, from 15.3 to 23.9 cases per 100,000. Counties without large colleges and universities (nonuniversity counties) (3,009) experienced a 5.9% decline in COVID-19 incidence, from 15.3 to 14.4 cases per 100,000. Similar findings were observed for percentage of positive test results and hotspot status (i.e., increasing among in-person-instruction university counties). In-person instruction at colleges and universities was associated with increased county-level COVID-19 incidence and percentage test positivity. Implementation of increased mitigation efforts at colleges and universities could minimize on-campus COVID-19 transmission.","Leidner, Andrew J; Barry, Vaughn; Bowen, Virginia B; Silver, Rachel; Musial, Trieste; Kang, Gloria J; Ritchey, Matthew D; Fletcher, Kelly; Barrios, Lisa; Pevzner, Eric",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,563,15

METHODS: We included patients aged up to 18 years of age who were diagnosed with MIS-C or KD in a paediatric university hospital in Paris from 1 January 2018 to 15 July 2020. Clinical, laboratory and imaging characteristics were compared and new French COVID-19 cases were correlated with MIS-C cases in our hospital. RESULTS: There were seven children with MIS-C, from six months to 12 years of age, who were all positive for the virus that causes COVID-19, and 40 virus negative children with KD. Their respective characteristics were: under five years of age (14.3% versus 85.0%), paediatric intensive care unit admission (100% versus 10.0%), abdominal pain (71.4% versus 12.5%), myocardial dysfunction (85.7% versus 5.0%), shock syndrome (85.7% versus 2.5%) and mean and standard deviation C-reactive protein (339 ±131 versus 153 ±87). These was a strong lagged correlation between the rise and fall in MIS-C patients and COVID-19 cases. CONCLUSION: The rise and fall of COVID-19 first-wave mirrored the MIS-C cases.

METHODS: A mixed-methods online survey, assessing broader governance constraints to climate change adaptation (CCA) for public health, was distributed to representatives of national public health associations, and societies of 82 member countries under the World Federation of Public Health Associations. Specific questions relevant to disaster risk management capacities and barriers were analyzed as part of a narrowed focus on the CCA subdomain of emergency preparedness. RESULTS: Existence of some technology, infrastructure, and/ or human resources, necessary to develop early warning and other surveillance systems for climate-related health risks was reported by 9 out of 11 responding countries. However, 7 reported persistent limitations and/ or regional discrepancies. Most significant identified barriers to strengthening emergency preparedness at the national level included governance coordination challenges, and, in the case of many developing countries, technical, medical, and human resource shortages. CONCLUSIONS: The development of new frameworks for intersectoral governance and large-scale resource mobilization will prove crucial to ongoing efforts to strengthen national climate-health resiliency and prepare for disaster-associated health threats.","Marcus, Hannah; Hanna, Liz",Disaster Med Public Health Prep,563,1

We worked with a sample of 460 adults, pre- and post-test information, as well as 7,189 observations from the diary phase. RESULTS: Results showed that deterioration in mental health symptoms across the duration of the study was associated with (a) change towards less fortunate appraisals of the pandemic and (b), more negative affect and less mindfulness in daily life. Furthermore, appraisals of the pandemic at pretest predicted experiences in daily life, with more negative appraisals of the pandemic predicting more negative affect and stressor occurrence as well as less mindfulness. CONCLUSIONS: These findings speak to the dynamic nature of well-being and appraisals in times of threat, and highlight the role of experiences in daily life in changes in well-being.","Brose, Annette; Blanke, Elisabeth S; Schmiedek, Florian; Kramer, Andrea C; Schmidt, Andrea; Neubauer, Andreas B",J. personal,563,15

METHODS: We used 2020 monthly Medicare data from January 1-September 30, 2020, reported to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to compute hospitalization rates per 100 COVID-19 MBs with FFS claims who were hospitalized (ICD-10-CM codes: B97.29 before April 1, 2020; ICD-10-CM codes: U07.1 from April 1, 2020, onward) with or without selected chronic conditions. We used logistic regression to estimate adjusted odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals for association of person-level rate of being hospitalized with COVID-19 and each of 27 chronic conditions by race/ethnicity, controlling for age, sex, and urban-rural residence among MBs. RESULTS: COVID-19-related hospitalizations were associated with all selected chronic conditions, except osteoporosis and Alzheimer disease/dementia among COVID-19 MBs. The top five conditions with the highest odds for hospitalization among COVID-19 MBs were end-stage renal disease (adjusted odds ratios (aOR): 2.15; 95% CI: 2.10-2.21), chronic kidney disease (aOR: 1.54; 95% CI: 1.52-1.56), acute myocardial infarction (aOR: 1.45; 95% CI: 1.39-1.53), heart failure (aOR: 1.43; 95% CI: 1.41-1.44), and diabetes (aOR: 1.37; 95% CI: 1.36-1.39). CONCLUSIONS: Racial/ethnic disparities in hospitalization rate persist among MBs with COVID-19, and associations of COVID-19 hospitalization with chronic conditions differ among racial/ethnic groups in the USA.

Using the MCODE tool, we identified THEM4, STYX, VPS36, LCOR, KIAA1143, EEA1, RAPGEF6, LOC439994, ZBTB33, PTPN22, ESCO1, and KLF3 as hub genes positively associated with Plasmodium falciparum infection (ASPF). These hub genes were involved in the biological processes of endosomal transport, regulation of natural killer cell proliferation, and KEGG pathways of endocytosis and fatty acid elongation. For the purple module negatively correlated with ASPF, we identified 19 hub genes that were involved in the biological processes of positive regulation of cellular protein catabolic process and KEGG pathways of other glycan degradation. For the salmon module positively correlated with severe malaria anemia (SMA), we identified 17 hub genes that were among those driving the biological processes of positive regulation of erythrocyte differentiation. For the brown module positively correlated with cerebral malaria (CM), we identified eight hub genes and these genes participated in phagolysosome assembly and positive regulation of exosomal secretion, and animal mitophagy pathway. For the tan module negatively correlated with CM, we identified four hub genes that were involved in CD8-positive, alpha-beta T cell differentiation and notching signaling pathway.

Predictions that the LMR would be overwhelmed by a coming COVID-19 tsunami were felt well before the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic had been declared. And yet, the LMR, excepting Myanmar, has proved surprisingly resilient in keeping COVID-19 contained to mostly sporadic cases. Cumulative case rates (per one million population) for the LMR, including or excluding Myanmar, from January 1 to October 31 2020, are 1,184 and 237, respectively. More telling are the cumulative rates of COVID-19-attributable deaths for the same period of time, 28 per million with and six without Myanmar. Graphics demonstrate a flattening of pandemic curves in the LMR, minus Myanmar, after managing temporally and spatially isolated spikes in case counts, with negligible follow-on community spread. The comparable success of the LMR in averting pandemic disaster can likely be attributed to years of preparedness investments, triggered by avian influenza A (H5N1). Capacity building initiatives applied to COVID-19 containment included virological (influenza-driven) surveillance, laboratory diagnostics, field epidemiology training, and vaccine preparation.

Its effects on delivery of diagnostic care for cardiovascular disease, which remains the leading cause of death worldwide, have not been quantified. OBJECTIVES: The study sought to assess COVID-19's impact on global cardiovascular diagnostic procedural volumes and safety practices. METHODS: The International Atomic Energy Agency conducted a worldwide survey assessing alterations in cardiovascular procedure volumes and safety practices resulting from COVID-19. Noninvasive and invasive cardiac testing volumes were obtained from participating sites for March and April 2020 and compared with those from March 2019. Availability of personal protective equipment and pandemic-related testing practice changes were ascertained. RESULTS: Surveys were submitted from 909 inpatient and outpatient centers performing cardiac diagnostic procedures, in 108 countries. Procedure volumes decreased 42% from March 2019 to March 2020, and 64% from March 2019 to April 2020. Transthoracic echocardiography decreased by 59%, transesophageal echocardiography 76%, and stress tests 78%, which varied between stress modalities.

Chronic wound biofilms represent a significant treatment challenge by demonstrating recalcitrance towards antimicrobial agents. However, a ""window of opportunity"" may exist after wound debridement when biofilms are more susceptible to topical antiseptics. Here, we discuss the role of antiseptics in the management of chronic wounds and biofilm, focusing on povidone-iodine (PVP-I) in comparison with two commonly used antiseptics: polyhexanide (PHMB) and silver. This article is based on the literature reviewed during a focus group meeting on antiseptics in wound care and biofilm management, and on a PubMed search conducted in March 2020. Compared with PHMB and silver, PVP-I has a broader spectrum of antimicrobial activity, potent antibiofilm efficacy, no acquired bacterial resistance or cross-resistance, low cytotoxicity, good tolerability, and an ability to promote wound healing. PVP-I represents a viable therapeutic option in wound care and biofilm management, with the potential to treat biofilm-infiltrated, critically colonised wounds. We propose a practical algorithm to guide the management of chronic, non-healing wounds due to critical colonisation or biofilm, using PVP-I.","Alves, Paulo J; Barreto, Ruben T; Barrois, Brigitte M; Gryson, Luc G; Meaume, Sylvie; Monstrey, Stan J",Int Wound J,563,2

Methods: All consecutive CTPA with positive PE in COVID-19 patients from University Hospital Split, from March 23, 2020 to January 31, 2021 were analyzed. Baseline data were collected from patient's electronic records. CTPA scan analysis identified PE anatomical location (i.e., main, lobar, segmental, or subsegmental). Results: A total number of 78 positive CTPA in COVID-19 patients was mainly in elderly with several co-morbidities, high D-dimer levels, at median of 14 days. CTPAs showed involvement of the entire pulmonary artery tree, mainly of the small-to medium diameter pulmonary artery branches, unilaterally (n = 31, 39,74%), and bilaterally (n = 33, 42.31%). The large-diameter branches were the most rarely affected as a single location (n = 14, 17.95%). Conclusion: PE occurred in predominantly elderly people, having several comorbidities, and high D-dimer levels. Embolic involvement of pulmonary branches of all sizes were found, the most frequent of small to medium diameter branches. Further investigation is needed to better understand mechanisms and course of the COVID-19 related PE.","Budimir Mrsic, D.; Perkovic-Tabak, L.; Cavar, M.; Luetic, A.; Petricevic, M.; Dolic, K.",Gerontology &amp; Geriatric Medicine,563,1

Such emerging pathogens should be considered as a high threat to humans, animals, and environmental health. The year 2020 was welcomed by another significant virus from family Coronaviridae called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that caused the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The disease was first reported in the city of Wuhan, Hubei province, China. Within a short time, this disease attained the status of the Public Health Emergency of International Concern. Presently, COVID-19 has spread to more than 150 countries, therefore, the World Health Organization (WHO) called it a pandemic. The Chinese government, along with WHO, other health agencies, and many nations, are monitoring the current situation closely to analyze the impact of SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 on humans, animals, and environmental health. In the context of the current situation, biosafety and biosecurity measure that focus on One Health aspects of the disease outbreaks and the SARS-CoV-2 spread are of great importance to restrain this pathogen. Along with these efforts, standard precaution and control measures should also be taken at personal and community level to prevent the spreading of any contagion diseases, including COVID-19. Researchers are putting their very high efforts to develop suitable vaccines and therapeutics/drugs to combat COVID-19. This review aims to highlight the importance of biosafety, biosecurity, One Health approach, and focusing on recent developments and the ways forward to prevent and control COVID-19 in a useful way.","Ahmad, Tauseef; Haroon,; Dhama, Kuldeep; Sharun, Khan; Khan, Fazal Mehmood; Ahmed, Irfan; Tiwari, Ruchi; Musa, Taha Hussien; Khan, Muhammad; Bonilla-Aldana, D.

Dietary flaxseed has demonstrated a protective effect against an MI. The present study was carried out to test the hypothesis that dietary flaxseed supplementation before and after an MI regulates the expression of above-mentioned miRNAs to produce its cardioprotective effect. Animals were randomized after inducing MI by coronary artery ligation into: (a) sham MI with normal chow, (b) MI with normal chow, and (c-e) MI supplemented with either 10% milled flaxseed, or 4.4% flax oil enriched in alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), or 0.44% flax lignan secoisolariciresinol diglucoside. The feeding protocol consisted of 2 weeks before and 8 weeks after the surgery. Dietary flax oil supplementation selectively upregulated the cardiac expression of miR-133a, miR-135a, and miR-29b. The levels of collagen I expression were reduced in the flax oil group. We conclude that miR-133a, miR-135a, and miR-29b are sensitive to dietary flax oil, likely due to its rich ALA content. The cardioprotective effect of flaxseed in an MI could be due to modulation of these miRNAs.","Parikh, Mihir; Kura, Branislav; O039,; Hara, Kimberley A; Dibrov, Elena; Netticadan, Thomas; Slezak, Jan; Pierce, Grant N",Biomolecules,563,12

Several challenges exist in identifying effective compounds against viral infections: (1) at the initial stage of a new virus outbreak, little information, except for its genome information, may be available; (2) although the identified compounds may be effective, they may be toxic in vivo and (3) cytokine release syndrome (CRS) triggered by viral infections is the primary cause of mortality. Currently, an integrative tool that takes all those aspects into consideration for identifying effective compounds to prevent viral infections is absent. In this study, we developed iDMer, as an integrative and mechanism-driven response system for addressing these challenges during the sudden virus outbreaks. iDMer comprises three mechanism-driven compound identification modules, that is, a virus-host interaction-oriented module, an autophagy-oriented module and a CRS-oriented module. As a one-stop integrative platform, iDMer incorporates compound toxicity evaluation and compound combination identification for virus treatment with clear mechanisms. iDMer was successfully tested on five viruses, including the current severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Our results indicated that, for all five tested viruses, compounds that were reported in the literature or experimentally validated for virus treatment were enriched at the top, demonstrating the generalized effectiveness of iDMer. Finally, we demonstrated that combinations of the individual modules successfully identified combinations of compounds effective for virus intervention with clear mechanisms.","Wei, Zhiting; Gao, Yuli; Meng, Fangliangzi; Chen, Xin; Gong, Yukang; Zhu, Chenyu; Ju, Bin; Zhang, Chao; Liu, Zhongmin; Liu, Qi",Brief. bioinform,563,24

The purpose of this study was to examine the trajectories of frailty, physical function and physical activity levels due to interruption and resumption of outpatient cardiac rehabilitation by COVID-19 in elderly heart failure patients. Fifteen patients who did not attend outpatient cardiac rehabilitation during the state of emergency but resumed it after the state of emergency were included. Frailty, physical function and physical activity levels were assessed with the Kihon checklist (KCL), various tests including short physical performance battery (SPPB), and life space assessment (LSA), respectively. Objective parameters were measured at three points; before and after the nationwide state of emergency in Japan and 3 months after resuming outpatient cardiac rehabilitation. The post-state of emergency KCL score was significantly higher than the pre-state of emergency score (P = 0.03), whereas there was no significant difference in KCL between post-state of emergency and 3 months after cardiac rehabilitation resumption. SPPB and LSA scores did not change significantly between pre- and post-state of emergency. The changes in LSA from post-state of emergency to 3 months after cardiac rehabilitation resumption tended to correlate with changes in KCL (r = -0.71, P = 0.11). We demonstrated that frailty status deteriorated significantly in elderly heart failure patients whose outpatient cardiac rehabilitation was interrupted due to COVID-19. In addition, the frailty status showed no significant improvement after 3 months of resuming cardiac rehabilitation.","Kato, Michitaka; Ono, Shintaro; Seko, Hiromasa; Tsukamoto, Toshiya; Kurita, Yasunari; Kubo, Akira; Omote, Toshiya; Omote, Shingo",Int. j. rehabil. res,563,30

This feasibility study aimed to gather the essential data needed to design and power a large randomised controlled trial (RCT) to investigate the efficacy of a digital intervention in reducing the risk of CMV acquisition in pregnancy. In order to do this, we carried out a single-centre RCT, which explored the knowledge, attitudes and risk reduction behaviours in women in the intervention and treatment as usual groups, pre- and post-intervention. METHODS: CMV seronegative women living with a child less than four years old, receiving antenatal care at a single UK tertiary centre, were randomised to the digital intervention or 'treatment as usual' groups. Participants completed questionnaires before the digital intervention and after and at 34 gestational weeks, and responses within groups and between groups were compared using tailored randomisation tests. CMV serology was tested in the first trimester and at the end of pregnancy. RESULTS: Of the 878 women screened, 865 samples were analysed with 43% (n = 372) being CMV seronegative and therefore eligible to take part in the RCT; of these, 103 (27.7%) women were enrolled and 87 (84%) of these completed the study. Most participants (n = 66; 64%) were unfamiliar with CMV at enrolment, however at 34 gestational weeks, women in the intervention group (n = 51) were more knowledgeable about CMV compared to the treatment as usual group (n = 52) and reported engaging in activities that may increase the risk of CMV transmission less frequently. The digital intervention was highly acceptable to pregnant women. Overall, four participants seroconverted over the course of the study: two from each study group. CONCLUSIONS: A large multi-centre RCT investigating the efficacy of a CMV digital intervention is feasible in the United Kingdom; this study has generated essential data upon which to power such a study. This single-centre feasibility RCT demonstrates that a digital educational intervention is associated with increase in knowledge about CMV and can result in behaviour change which may reduce the risk of CMV acquisition in pregnancy.

However, there are limited data on the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on HIV treatment engagement outcomes among transgender (trans) and nonbinary people. This study addresses a pressing knowledge gap and is important in its global scope, its use of technology for recruitment, and focus on transgender people living with HIV. The objective of this study is to examine correlates of HIV infection and HIV treatment engagement outcomes (i.e., currently on ART, having an HIV provider, having access to HIV treatment without burden, and remote refills) since the COVID-19 pandemic began. METHODS: We utilized observational data from the Global COVID-19 Disparities Survey 2020, an online study that globally sampled trans and nonbinary people (n = 902) between April and August 2020. We conducted a series of multivariable logistic regressions with lasso selection to explore correlates of HIV treatment engagement outcomes in the context of COVID-19. RESULTS: Of the 120 (13.3%) trans and nonbinary people living with HIV in this survey, the majority (85.8%) were currently on HIV treatment. A smaller proportion (69.2%) reported having access to an HIV provider since COVID-19 control measures were implemented. Less than half reported being able to access treatment without burdens related to COVID-19 (48.3%) and having the ability to remotely refill HIV prescription (44.2%). After adjusting for gender in the multivariable models, younger age and anticipated job loss were significantly associated with not having access to HIV treatment without burden. Outcomes also significantly varied by geographic region, with respondents reporting less access to an HIV provider in nearly every region outside of South-East Asia. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that currently taking ART, having access to an HIV provider, and being able to access HIV treatment without burden and remotely refill HIV medication are suboptimal among trans and nonbinary people living with HIV across the world. Strengthening support for HIV programs that are well-connected to trans and nonbinary communities, increasing remote access to HIV providers and prescription refills, and providing socioeconomic support could significantly improve HIV engagement in trans and nonbinary communities.","Restar, Arjee Javellana; Garrison-Desany, Henri M; Adamson, Tyler; Childress, Chase; Millett, Gregorio; Jarrett, Brooke A; Howell, Sean; Glick, Jennifer L; Beckham, S Wilson; Baral, Stefan",BMC Public Health,563,20

In order to determine the duration of infectivity and its correlation with reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) results and time since initial positive PCR test in this population, we evaluated SARS-CoV-2 cell infectivity in nasopharyngeal samples longitudinally obtained from asymptomatic carriers who disembarked from a cruise ship during a COVID-19 outbreak. Of 166 nasopharyngeal samples collected from 39 asymptomatic carriers every 48 h until two consecutive negative PCR test results were obtained, SARS-CoV-2 was successfully isolated from 9 PCR-positive samples which were obtained from 7 persons (18%; 7/39). Viable viruses were isolated predominantly within 7 days after the initial positive PCR test, except for one person who shed viable virus until day 15. The median crossing point (Cp) value of RT-PCR of culture-positive samples was 24.6 (interquartile range [IQR], 20.4 to 25.8; range, 17.9 to 30.3), and Cp values were significantly associated with isolation of viable virus (odds ratio, 0.496; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.329 to 0.747; P value, 0.001), which was consistent with existing data for symptomatic patients. Genome sequence analysis of SARS-CoV-2 samples consecutively obtained from a person who shed viable virus for 15 days identified the emergence of two novel single nucleotide variants (C8626T transition and C18452T transition) in the sample collected on day 15, with the latter corresponding to an amino acid substitution in nonstructural protein 14. The impact of these mutations on prolonged viable-virus shedding is unclear. These findings underscore the potential role of asymptomatic carriers in transmission.IMPORTANCE A growing number of studies suggest the potential role of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 carriers as a major driver of the COVID-19 pandemic; however, virological assessment of asymptomatic infection has largely been limited to reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR), which can be persistently positive without necessarily indicating the presence of viable virus (e.g., replication-competent virus). Here, we evaluated the infectivity of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 carriers by detecting SARS-CoV-2-induced cytopathic effects on Vero cells using longitudinally obtained nasopharyngeal samples from asymptomatic carriers. We show that asymptomatic carriers can shed viable virus until 7 days after the initial positive PCR test, with one outlier shedding until day 15. The crossing point (Cp) value of RT-PCR was the leading predictive factor for virus viability. These findings provide additional insights into the role of asymptomatic carriers as a source of transmission and highlight the importance of universal source control measures, along with isolation policy for asymptomatic carriers.","Murata, Takayuki; Sakurai, Aki; Suzuki, Masahiro; Komoto, Satoshi; Ide, Tomihiko; Ishihara, Takuma; Doi, Yohei",MSphere,563,15

Cathelicidin-related antimicrobial peptide (CRAMP), the mouse analog of LL-37 peptide in humans, is a cationic antimicrobial peptide belonging to the cathelicidin family; however, its secretion by cancer cells and role in the tumor microenvironment (TME) remain unclear. In this study, we explored the possibility of an interaction between effector CD4+ T cells and CRAMP using in vitro-generated mouse Th17 cells. We found that CRAMP stimulates Th17 cells to express the ectonucleotidase CD73, while simultaneously inducing cell death. This finding suggested that CD73-expressing Th17 cells may function as immune suppressor cells instead of effector cells. In addition, treatment of pharmacological inhibitors of the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-ß) signaling pathway showed that induction of CD73 expression is mediated by the p38 signaling pathway. Overall, our findings suggest that tumor-derived LL-37 likely functions as an immune suppressor that induces immune tolerance against tumors through shaping effector Th17 cells into suppressor Th17 cells, suggesting a new intervention target to improve cancer immunotherapy.","Lee, Jeonghyun; Shin, Kyong-Oh; Kim, Yesol; Cho, Jaewon; Lim, Hyung W; Yoon, Sung-Il; Lee, Geun-Shik; Ko, Hyun-Jeong; Kim, Pyeung-Hyeun; Uchida, Yoshikazu; Park, Kyungho; Kang, Seung Goo",,563,24

Given the variability in COVID-19 testing and prevention capability, identifying factors associated with mortality in patients requiring mechanical ventilation is critical. This study aimed to identify which demographics, comorbidities, markers of disease progression, and interventions are associated with 30-day mortality in COVID-19 patients requiring mechanical ventilation. METHODS: Adult patients with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 admitted to one of the health system's intensive care units and requiring mechanical ventilation between March 9, 2020 and April 1, 2020, were included in this observational cohort study. We used Chi-Square and Mann-Whitney U tests to compare patient characteristics between deceased and living patients and multiple logistic regression to assess the association between independent variables and the likelihood of 30-day mortality. RESULTS: We included 85 patients, of which 20 died (23.5%) within 30 days of the first hospital admission. In the univariate analysis, deceased patients were more likely &#8805;60 years of age (p < 0.001), non-Hispanic (p = 0.026), and diagnosed with a solid malignant tumor (p = 0.003). Insurance status also differed between survivors and non-survivors (p = 0.019). Age &#8805;60 and malignancy had a 9.5-fold (95% confidence interval 1.4-62.3, p = 0.020) and 5.8-fold higher odds ratio (95% confidence interval 1.2-28.4, p = 0.032) for 30-day mortality after adjusted analysis using multivariable logistic regression, while other independent variables were no longer significant. CONCLUSIONS: In our observational cohort study of 85 mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients, age, and a diagnosis of a solid malignant tumor were associated with 30-day mortality. Our findings validate concerns for the survival of elderly and cancer patients in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States, where testing capabilities and preventative measures have been inconsistent. Preventative efforts geared to patients at risk for intensive care unit mortality from COVID-19 should be explored.","Krause, Martin; Douin, David J; Kim, Kevin K; Fernandez-Bustamante, Ana; Bartels, Karsten",J Intensive Care Med,563,22
297307,297307,297307,Andragogía y COVID-19,17.348843,-0.33500862,2020,"Previous studies suggested that erythropoietin (EPO) may protect against severe COVID-19-induced injuries, ultimately preventing mortality. This hypothesis is based on the fact that, in addition to promoting the increase in red blood cells, EPO is an anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic and protective factor in several non-erythropoietic tissues. Furthermore, EPO promotes nitric oxide production in the hypoxic lung and stimulates ventilation by interacting with the respiratory centers of the brainstem. Given that EPO in the blood is increased at high-altitude, we evaluated the serum levels of EPO in critical patients with COVID-19 at ""Hospital Agramont"" in the city of El Alto (4150 masl) in Bolivia. A total of 16 patients, 15 men, one woman, with a mean age of 55.8 ± 8.49 years, admitted to the Intensive Care Unit were studied. All patients were permanent residents of El Alto, with no travel history below 3000 masl for at least one year. Blood samples were collected upon admission to the ICU. Serum EPO concentration was assessed using an ELISA kit, and a standard technique determined hemoglobin concentration. Only half of the observed patients survived the disease. Remarkably, fatal cases showed 2.5 times lower serum EPO than survivors (2.78 ± 0.8643 mU/mL vs 7.06 ± 2.713 mU/mL; p = 0.0096), and 1.24 times lower hemoglobin levels (13.96 ± 2.56 g/dL vs 17.41 ± 1.61 g/dL; p = 0.0159). While the number of cases evaluated in this work is low, our findings strongly warrant further investigation of EPO levels in COVID-19 patients at high and low altitudes. Our results also support the hypothesis that exogenous EPO administration could help critically ill COVID-19 patients overcome the disease.","Viruez-Soto, Antonio; López-Dávalos, Mónica Marlene; Rada-Barrera, Gabriel; Merino-Luna, Alfredo; Molano-Franco, Daniel; Tinoco-Solorozano, Amílcar; Zubieta-DeUrioste, Natalia; Zubieta-Calleja, Gustavo; Arias-Reyes, Christian; Soliz, Jorge",Respir Physiol Neurobiol,563,23

In several studies, solid-organ transplant recipients were reported to have higher risk for COVID-19. Here, we aimed to determine the frequency of COVID-19 in our kidney and liver transplant patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Our study included 583 transplant patients who were admitted to our outpatient transplant clinics and emergency departments between March 1 and May 1, 2020. Seventy-four of them were liver transplant recipients (46 male, 28 female, of which 14 were pediatric and 60 were adult patients) and 509 of them were kidney transplant recipients (347 male, 162 female, of which 16 were pediatric and 493 were adult patients). We retrospectively evaluated demographic characteristics, currently used immunosuppressant treatment, present complaints, treatment and diagnosis of comorbid diseases, and results of COVID-19 tests. RESULTS: Of 583 transplant recipients, 538 were seen in our outpatient transplant clinics and 45 were seen in our emergency departments. Of these, 18 patients who had had cough and fever were evaluated by respiratory clinic doctors, and nasopharyngeal swab samples were taken. One kidney transplant recipient had a positive COVID-19 test; he was followed with home isolation. He received treatment with hydroxychloroquine (400 mg/day). The other 17 patients had negative tests. There were no mortalities due to COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Transplant patients also got affected during the COVID-19 pandemic. According to the data of our centers, this effect is not much more different from the normal population. We recommend that transplant recipients should be warned in terms of personal hygiene and should be closely monitored by organ transplant centers. If there is an indication for hospitalization, they should be followed in an isolated unit, with no aggressive changes made to immunosuppressive doses unless necessary.","Akdur, Aydincan; Karakaya, Emre; Ayvazoglu Soy, Ebru H; Alshalabi, Omar; Kirnap, Mahir; Arslan, Hande; Ulubay, Gaye; Hekimoglu, Koray; Moray, Gokhan; Haberal, Mehmet",Exp Clin Transplant,563,16

DESIGN: Qualitative study using semistructured telephone interviews and rapid analysis, interpreted using Baehr's sociological lens of 'communities of fate'. PARTICIPANTS: Forty NHS staff working in critical care, including 21 nurses, 10 doctors and advanced critical care practitioners, 4 allied health professionals, 3 operating department practitioners and 2 ward clerks. Participants were interviewed between August and October 2020; we purposefully sought the experiences of trained and experienced critical care staff and those who were redeployed. SETTING: Four hospitals in the UK. RESULTS: COVID-19 presented staff with a situation of extreme stress, duress and social emergency, leading to a shared set of experiences which we have characterised as a community of fate. This involved not only fear and dread of working in critical care, but also a collective sense of duty and vocation. Caring for patients and families involved changes to usual ways of working, revolving around: reorganisation of space and personnel, personal protective equipment, lack of evidence for treating COVID-19, inability for families to be physically present, and the trauma of witnessing extreme patient acuity and death on a large scale. The stress and isolation of working in critical care during COVID-19 was mitigated by strong teamwork, camaraderie, pride and fulfilment. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 has changed working practices in critical care and profoundly affected staff physically, mentally and emotionally. Attention needs to be paid to the social and organisational conditions in which individuals work, addressing both practical resourcing and the interpersonal dynamics of critical care provision.","Montgomery, Catherine M; Humphreys, Sally; McCulloch, Corrienne; Docherty, Annemarie B; Sturdy, Steve; Pattison, Natalie",BMJ Open,563,20

Animals bearing human MDSC-containing solid tumor xenografts received treatment with MDSC-targeting human natural killer (NK) cells and underwent nanoparticle contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) imaging. Whereas conventional CT-derived tumor metrics were unable to differentiate NK cell immunotherapy tumors from untreated tumors, nano-radiomics revealed texture-based features capable of differentiating treatment groups.

There is a growing body of evidence, obtained from clinical trials and case reports, demonstrating clinical and paraclinical improvement in patients following administration of baricitinib including rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, alopecia areata, interferon-mediated auto-inflammatory diseases, graft versus host disease, diabetic kidney disease, and recently, coronavirus disease-19. However, despite overall encouraging results, many adverse effects have been observed in baricitinib-treated patients ranging from simple infections to increased risk of malignancies, particularly in long-term use.

Here we characterise the outcomes of a cohort of patients with cancer and COVID-19 and identify potential prognostic factors for mortality and severe illness. METHODS: In this cohort study, we collected de-identified data on patients with active or previous malignancy, aged 18 years and older, with confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection from the USA, Canada, and Spain from the COVID-19 and Cancer Consortium (CCC19) database for whom baseline data were added between March 17 and April 16, 2020. We collected data on baseline clinical conditions, medications, cancer diagnosis and treatment, and COVID-19 disease course. The primary endpoint was all-cause mortality within 30 days of diagnosis of COVID-19. We assessed the association between the outcome and potential prognostic variables using logistic regression analyses, partially adjusted for age, sex, smoking status, and obesity. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04354701, and is ongoing. FINDINGS: Of 1035 records entered into the CCC19 database during the study period, 928 patients met inclusion criteria for our analysis. Median age was 66 years (IQR 57-76), 279 (30%) were aged 75 years or older, and 468 (50%) patients were male. The most prevalent malignancies were breast (191 [21%]) and prostate (152 [16%]). 366 (39%) patients were on active anticancer treatment, and 396 (43%) had active (measurable) cancer. At analysis (May 7, 2020), 121 (13%) patients had died. In logistic regression analysis, independent factors associated with increased 30-day mortality, after partial adjustment, were: increased age (per 10 years; partially adjusted odds ratio 1·84, 95% CI 1·53-2·21), male sex (1·63, 1·07-2·48), smoking status (former smoker vs never smoked: 1·60, 1·03-2·47), number of comorbidities (two vs none: 4·50, 1·33-15·28), Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 2 or higher (status of 2 vs 0 or 1: 3·89, 2·11-7·18), active cancer (progressing vs remission: 5·20, 2·77-9·77), and receipt of azithromycin plus hydroxychloroquine (vs treatment with neither: 2·93, 1·79-4·79; confounding by indication cannot be excluded). Compared with residence in the US-Northeast, residence in Canada (0·24, 0·07-0·84) or the US-Midwest (0·50, 0·28-0·90) were associated with decreased 30-day all-cause mortality. Race and ethnicity, obesity status, cancer type, type of anticancer therapy, and recent surgery were not associated with mortality. INTERPRETATION: Among patients with cancer and COVID-19, 30-day all-cause mortality was high and associated with general risk factors and risk factors unique to patients with cancer. Longer follow-up is needed to better understand the effect of COVID-19 on outcomes in patients with cancer, including the ability to continue specific cancer treatments.

We aimed to investigate the association of sleep quality with clinical outcomes among hospitalized patients with COVID-19. We conducted a prospective cohort study in 205 adult hospitalized patients with diagnosed moderate COVID-19, with follow-up until hospital discharge or death. Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) assessed sleep quality before and after infection. The primary outcome was the incidence of severe or critical pneumonia, and the secondary outcomes were duration of hospital stay and laboratory measurements during the follow up. Among the 205 included hospitalized patients, 185 (90.2 %) experienced poorer sleep quality after infection than before according to the PSQI score, and 25 (12.2 %) developed severe or critical pneumonia during follow-up. In Cox regression models, the adjusted hazard ratio of developing severe or critical pneumonia associated with each 1 score increment in the PSQI score before and after infection was 1.23 (95% CI: 1.09, 1.39) and 1.35 (95 % CI: 1.08, 1.67), respectively. Poorer sleep quality was also significantly associated with a prolonged hospital stay and more serious dysregulations in immune system indicated by several laboratory markers. Poorer sleep quality, either in the daily time or after infection with SARS-CoV-2, was associated with worse clinical outcomes.

While there are several reports on COVID-19's impact on inpatient palliative care, literature is limited about the impact on outpatient care which may be more relevant for these patients. AIM: To generate a person-centered description of the impact of COVID-19 from the perspectives of patients living with neurodegenerative disease and caregivers to improve outpatient palliative care delivery. DESIGN: This qualitative study used rapid analysis via matrix design to identify emergent themes related to participant perspectives on the challenges of COVID-19. Data sources included semi-structured interviews, open-ended survey responses, medical record documentation and participant-researcher communications. SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: Data was collected from 108 patients with Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease or related disorders and 90 caregivers enrolled in a multicenter, clinical trial of community-based, outpatient palliative care between March 20, 2020 and August 8, 2020 (NCT03076671). RESULTS: Four main themes emerged: (1) disruptions to delivery of healthcare and other supportive services; (2) increased symptomatic and psychosocial needs; (3) increased caregiver burden; (4) limitations of telecommunications when compared to in-person contact. We observed that these themes interacted and intersected. CONCLUSIONS: Patients and caregivers have unmet care needs because of the pandemic, exacerbated by social isolation. While telemedicine has helped improve access to healthcare, patients and caregivers perceive clear limitations compared to in-person services. Changes in society and healthcare delivery in response to COVID-19 highlight ongoing and novel gaps that must be addressed to optimize future outpatient palliative care for neurologic illness.","Macchi, Zachary A; Ayele, Roman; Dini, Megan; Lamira, Jensine; Katz, Maya; Pantilat, Steven Z; Jones, Jacqueline; Kluger, Benzi M",Palliat Med,563,10

Recent reports have estimated reduced VE with the emergence and dissemination of the B.1.617.2 variant (""Delta variant""). We assess VE in Multnomah County, Oregon during a delta variant related epidemic expansion. MethodsA test-negative design (TND) matched case-control analysis was performed to estimate the effectiveness of vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 infection during July 2021. Cases included a random sample of individuals that tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and were reported by electronic laboratory report, were >15 years of age, and had no prior known SARS-CoV-2 infections. Controls were age and postal code matched individuals that tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 during July 2021. Immunization status was assessed using the Oregon ALERT Immunization Information system. Results500 case-control pairs were matched (n=1000). 40.4% of cases were up-to-date on COVID-19 immunizations compared to 64.6% of controls. Effectiveness of any completed COVID-19 immunization was 73% (95% Confidence Interval [CI] 49-86%), 74% (95% CI 65-85%) for mRNA immunizations (BNT162b2, mRNA-1273), and 72% (95% CI 47-85%) for individuals partially immunized with mRNA immunizations. ConclusionsOur findings estimate high, yet reduced, VE during Delta variant dissemination. These results highlight the importance of COVID-19 immunizations for reducing SARS-CoV-2 infection while juxtaposing the need for additional non-pharmaceutical interventions. Importantly, the reduced VE identified here may predict future reductions in vaccine performance in the context of ongoing viral genetic drift.","Barlow, Russell S.; Larson, Lindsey; Jian, Kevin",,563,20

OBJECTIVE: To ascertain renal cell carcinoma (RCC) patients' perspectives on COVID-19 and understand the associated implications for treatment. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: An online survey of RCC patients was conducted from March 22 to March 25, 2020, disseminated through social media and patient networking platforms. The survey comprised 45 items, including baseline demographic, clinicopathologic, and treatment-related information. Patients were additionally queried regarding their anxiety level related to COVID-19 and associated implications for their cancer diagnosis. INTERVENTION: An online survey study. OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Descriptive statistics with graphical outputs were used to characterize survey results. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: A total of 539 patients (male:female 39%:58%) from 14 countries responded. Of them, 71% felt that their risk of COVID-19 infection was higher than the general population, and 27% contacted their physician to establish this. Among patients with localized disease (40%), most (42%) had scheduled surveillance scans within 6 wk-65% were unwilling to delay scans. Among patients with metastatic disease, 76% were receiving active therapy. While most patients preferred not to defer therapy (51%), patients receiving immune therapy regimens were less amenable to deferring therapy than those receiving targeted treatment (20% vs 47%). CONCLUSIONS: Despite high levels of anxiety surrounding COVID-19, many patients with RCC were inclined to adhere to existing schedules of surveillance (localized disease) and systemic treatment (metastatic disease). PATIENT SUMMARY: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has prompted many doctors to develop different treatment strategies for cancer and other chronic conditions. Given the importance of the patient voice in these strategies, we conducted a survey of patients with kidney cancer to determine their treatment preferences.

The objective of the study was to demonstrate that percutaneous dilational tracheostomy (PDT) with a period of apnea in patients requiring prolonged mechanical ventilation due to COVID-19 is safe and can be performed for the usual indications in the intensive care unit. METHODS: This study involves an observational case series at a single-center medical intensive care unit at a level-1 trauma center in patients diagnosed with COVID-19 who were assessed for tracheostomy. Success of a modified technique included direct visualization of tracheal access by bronchoscopy and a blind dilation and tracheostomy insertion during a period of patient apnea to reduce aerosolization.

The majority had failed extubation at least once (72.7%), and the median duration of intubation before tracheostomy was 15 d (interquartile range 13-24). The median positive end-expiratory pressure at time of tracheostomy was 10.8. The median partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2)/FiO2 ratio on the day of tracheostomy was 142.8 (interquartile range 104.5-224.4). Two patients had bleeding complications.

We conducted a cross-sectional study between March 24 and May 7, 2020, involving consecutive patients undergoing RT-PCR testing in two community-based laboratories in Lyon (France) for a suspicion of COVID-19. We examined the association between symptoms and a positive test using univariable and multivariable logistic regression, adjusted for clustering within laboratories, and calculated the diagnostic performance of these symptoms.

Our novel biosensor composed of the interdigitated platinum/titanium electrodes on the glass substrate can detect the hybridization of analyte DNA with probe DNA. The hybridization signals of specific DNA sequences were verified through exhaustive physicochemical analytical techniques such as Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectrometry, contact-angle analysis, and capacitance-frequency measurements. For a single-step hybridized reaction, the fabricated kit exhibited significant sensitivity (capacitance change, &#916;C = ~2 nF) in detecting the conserved region of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene with high sensitivity of 0.843 nF/nM. In addition to capacitive measurements, this selective detection was confirmed by the fluorescence image and intensity from a SARS-CoV-2 gene labeled with a fluorescent dye.

Early state mandated guidelines limited non-essential medical care to help curb transmission, preserve medical resources, and ease the burden on health care systems. Our study evaluates the impact on interventional radiology (IR) and surgical procedural volumes following a state mandate to halt non-essential care in March 2020. Materials and Methods: Total IR volume and procedural volume for other surgical specialties, including vascular surgery, urology, general surgery, gynecology, and GI surgery were compiled for March 2020 and April 2020 for a large health care system based in the Midwest. Procedural volumes were compared to monthly baseline volumes calculated as an average of 6 months (January 2019 through April 2019 as well as January and February 2020). Percent change in volume for each specialty was calculated. Results: A total of 919 and 708 procedures were performed by IR during March and April 2020, respectively. The aforementioned specialties performed a total of 2,467 and 1,041 procedures in March and April 2020. IR demonstrated a 3.5% decrease in volume during March and 25.7% decrease in volume during April 2020. Vascular surgery, general surgery, urology, gynecology and GI surgery demonstrated 11.2%, 20.2%, 25.4%, 30.6%, 38% decrease in March and 25.7%, 47.4%, 63.3%, 68.0%, 72.9% and 78.7% reduction in volume in April 2020, respectively. Conclusions: Procedural volumes during the initial phase of the COVID-19 health crisis were decreased compared to baseline values. Analysis following a state mandated halt on all non-essential care yielded large resultant reductions in volumes for multiple specialties. IR volumes were relatively less impacted, suggesting a larger proportion of essential procedures during this time frame.","Hashmi, A.; Al-Natour, M.; Sutter, C.; Azar, N.; Davidson, J.; Tavri, S.",Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology,563,25

During the COVID-19 outbreak, it has been reported a decrease in the incidence of acute coronary syndrome, but few data are available about pacemaker implantation rates. This study aimed to analyse patients referred to our centre with permanent cardiac pacing indication during the COVID-19 outbreak. METHODS: We compared the number, the characteristics and the outcomes of patients who underwent urgent pacemaker implantation between March and April 2019 (Group I) with those performed in the corresponding 2020 period (Group II). RESULTS: A total of 27 patients (Group I) were implanted in March-April 2019 and 34 patients (Group II) in the corresponding 2020 period. In both groups, about half of the patients received a dual-chamber pacemaker. No significant differences in baseline patients' characteristics were observed. The most frequent indication was advanced atrio-ventricular block with a prevalence of 78% and 62% in Group I and II, respectively. The rate of procedural complications, the in-hospital and 1-month mortality were also similar between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: In our regional referral center, we observed a routine activity in terms of urgent pacemaker implantations for the treatment of symptomatic bradyarrhythmia during the COVID-19 outbreak.","Marini, Massimiliano; Zilio, Filippo; Martin, Marta; Strazzanti, Mattia; Quintarelli, Silvia; Guarracini, Fabrizio; Coser, Alessio; Giacopelli, Daniele; Bonmassari, Roberto",Minerva cardioangiol,563,24

Disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) may modify the risk of developing a severe COVID-19 infection, beside identified risk factors such as age and comorbidities. Objective: To describe the clinical characteristics and outcomes in patients with MS and COVID-19 and identify factors associated with COVID-19 severity. Design, Setting, and Participants: The Covisep registry is a multicenter, retrospective, observational cohort study conducted in MS expert centers and general hospitals and with neurologists collaborating with MS expert centers and members of the Société Francophone de la Sclérose en Plaques. The study included patients with MS presenting with a confirmed or highly suspected diagnosis of COVID-19 between March 1, 2020, and May 21, 2020. Exposures: COVID-19 diagnosed with a polymerase chain reaction test on a nasopharyngeal swab, thoracic computed tomography, or typical symptoms. Main Outcomes and Measures: The main outcome was COVID-19 severity assessed on a 7-point ordinal scale (ranging from 1 [not hospitalized with no limitations on activities] to 7 [death]) with a cutoff at 3 (hospitalized and not requiring supplemental oxygen). We collected demographics, neurological history, Expanded Disability Severity Scale score (EDSS; ranging from 0 to 10, with cutoffs at 3 and 6), comorbidities, COVID-19 characteristics, and outcomes. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression models were used to estimate the association of collected variables with COVID-19 outcomes. Results: A total of 347 patients (mean [SD] age, 44.6 [12.8] years, 249 women; mean [SD] disease duration, 13.5 [10.0] years) were analyzed. Seventy-three patients (21.0%) had a COVID-19 severity score of 3 or more, and 12 patients (3.5%) died of COVID-19. The median EDSS was 2.0 (range, 0-9.5), and 284 patients (81.8%) were receiving DMT. There was a higher proportion of patients with a COVID-19 severity score of 3 or more among patients with no DMT relative to patients receiving DMTs (46.0% vs 15.5%; P < .001). Multivariate logistic regression models determined that age (odds ratio per 10 years: 1.9 [95% CI, 1.4-2.5]), EDSS (OR for EDSS &#8805;6, 6.3 [95% CI. 2.8-14.4]), and obesity (OR, 3.0 [95% CI, 1.0-8.7]) were independent risk factors for a COVID-19 severity score of 3 or more (indicating hospitalization or higher severity). The EDSS was associated with the highest variability of COVID-19 severe outcome (R2, 0.2), followed by age (R2, 0.06) and obesity (R2, 0.01). Conclusions and Relevance: In this registry-based cohort study of patients with MS, age, EDSS, and obesity were independent risk factors for severe COVID-19; there was no association found between DMTs exposure and COVID-19 severity. The identification of these risk factors should provide the rationale for an individual strategy regarding clinical management of patients with MS during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Louapre, Céline; Collongues, Nicolas; Stankoff, Bruno; Giannesini, Claire; Papeix, Caroline; Bensa, Caroline; Deschamps, Romain; Créange, Alain; Wahab, Abir; Pelletier, Jean; Heinzlef, Olivier; Labauge, Pierre; Guilloton, Laurent; Ahle, Guido; Goudot, Mathilde; Bigaut, Kevin; Laplaud, David-Axel; Vukusic, Sandra; Lubetzki, Catherine; De Sèze, Jérôme; Derouiche, Fayçal; Tourbah, Ayman; Mathey, Guillaume; Théaudin, Marie; Sellal, François; Dugay, Marie-Hélène; Zéphir, Helene; Vermersch, Patrick; Durand-Dubief, Françoise; Françoise, Romain; Androdias-Condemine, Géraldine; Pique, Julie; Codjia, Pékès; Tilikete, Caroline; Marcaud, Véronique; Lebrun-Frenay, Christine; Cohen, Mikael; Ungureanu, Aurelian; Maillart, Elisabeth; Beigneux, Ysoline; Roux, Thomas; Corvol, Jean-Christophe; Bordet, Amandine; Mathieu, Yanica; Le Breton, Frédérique; Boulos, Dalia Dimitri; Gout, Olivier; Guéguen, Antoine; Moulignier, Antoine; Boudot, Marine",JAMA Neurol,563,21

The mean duration of AIS from COVID-19 symptoms onset was 10 ± 8 days, and the mean NIHSS score was 19 ± 8. Laboratory investigations revealed an elevated mean D-dimer (9.2 ± 14.8 mg/L) and fibrinogen (5.8 ± 2.0 g/L). Antiphospholipid antibodies were detected in a significant number of cases. The majority of AIS neuroimaging patterns observed was large vessel thrombosis, embolism or stenosis (62.1%, 64/103), followed by multiple vascular territory (26.2%, 27/103). A high mortality rate was reported (38.0%, 49/129). We report the pooled incidence of AIS in COVID-19 patients to be 1.2%, with a high mortality rate. Elevated D-dimer, fibrinogen and the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies appear to be prominent in COVID-19 patients with concomitant AIS, but further mechanistic studies are required to elucidate their role in pathogenesis.","Tan, Ying-Kiat; Goh, Claire; Leow, Aloysius S T; Tambyah, Paul A; Ang, Alicia; Yap, Eng-Soo; Tu, Tian-Ming; Sharma, Vijay K; Yeo, Leonard L L; Chan, Bernard P L; Tan, Benjamin Y Q",J Thromb Thrombolysis,563,2

This study examines clinical characteristics and attitudes distinguishing those PR patients who decided to resume PR (RES) versus those who elected not to resume (DIS) when the program re-opened 16 weeks later. We hypothesized that those patients who chose not to resume would have more severe disease and/or higher Covid-19 related anxiety.Methods: The following demographic and clinical data were collected from the medical record on all subjects from the time of their initial PR entry evaluation: age, sex, pulmonary diagnosis, cardiac and psychiatric co-morbidities, pulmonary function studies (FVC, FEV1, FEV1/FVC), six-minute walk test distance, COPD Assessment Test score, use of home oxygen (yes or no), University of California San Diego Shortness of Breath Questionnaire, Public Health Questioanaire-9. A 6 question survey was administered to the RES subjects at the time of their first return visit. A 6 question survey was administered to DIS patients by mail.Results: Thirteen patients had interrupted PR;8 in the RES group, 5 in the DIS group. Mean age of the entire group was 66.6 + 11.6 years. 6/13 were male. Ten had COPD, 2 interstitial lung disease, 1 asthma. There was no statistically significant difference in any demographic or clinical parameter between the RES and DIS groups. All 5 patients in the DIS group indicated that anxiety about Covid-19 was the main reason they did not wish to resume PR;this appeared unrelated to any preexisting psychiatric/anxiety diagnosis. In the RES group, 4/8 indicated no anxiety about returning to the program, 1 mildly anxious, 1 moderately anxious, and 2 extremely anxious. All 5 patients in the DIS group indicated that wearing a face mask (which would be required for resumption of PR) during the pandemic made their breathing worse, whereas 4/7 in the RES group indicated a mask had no effect on their breathing.Conclusions: Thirty-eight percent of patients chose not to resume PR during the Covid-19 pandemic. In this small sample, no demographic or clinical parameter distinguished the RES and DIS groups. Survey results indicate anxiety related to possible Covid-19 exposure and/or the new requirement for mask wearing during exercise may have contributed to patient's decision to discontinue PR.","Sexauer, W.

The aim of this study was to see whether or not this may affect overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS). METHOD: A systematic review was carried out according to PRISMA guidelines (PROSPERO ID: CRD42020189158). Medline, EMBASE and Scopus were interrogated. Patients aged over 18 years with a diagnosis of colon or rectal cancer who received elective surgery as their primary treatment were included. Delay to elective surgery was defined as the period between CRC diagnosis and the day of surgery. Meta-analysis of the outcomes OS and DFS were conducted. Forest plots, funnel plots and tests of heterogeneity were produced. An estimated number needed to harm (NNH) was calculated for statistically significant pooled hazard ratios (HRs). RESULTS: Of 3753 articles identified, seven met the inclusion criteria. Encompassing 314 560 patients, three of the seven studies showed that a delay to elective resection is associated with poorer OS or DFS. OS was assessed at a 1 month delay, the HR for six datasets was 1.13 (95% CI 1.02-1.26, p = 0.020) and at 3 months the pooled HR for three datasets was 1.57 (95% CI 1.16-2.12, p = 0.004). The estimated NNH for a delay at 1 month and 3 months was 35 and 10 respectively. Delay was nonsignificantly negatively associated with DFS on meta-analysis. CONCLUSION: This review recommends that elective surgery for CRC patients is not postponed longer than 4 weeks, as available evidence suggests extended delays from diagnosis are associated with poorer outcomes. Focused research is essential so patient groups can be prioritized based on risk factors in future delays or pandemics.","Whittaker, Thomas M; Abdelrazek, Mohamed E G; Fitzpatrick, Aran J; Froud, Joseph L J; Kelly, Jack R; Williamson, Jeremy S; Williams, Gethin L",Colorectal dis,563,16

Thereby, COVID-19 can evoke a range of neurosensory conditions belonging to infectious, inflammatory, demyelinating, and degenerative classes. A broad range of non-specific options, including anti-viral agents and anti-inflammatory protocols, is available with varying therapeutic. Due to the high mortality and morbidity in COVID-19-related brain damage, some changes to these general protocols, however, are necessary for ensuring the delivery of therapeutic(s) to the specific components of the CNS to meet their specific requirements. The biomaterials approach permits crossing the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and drug delivery in a more accurate and sustained manner. Beyond the BBB, drugs can protect neural cells, stimulate endogenous stem cells, and induce plasticity more effectively. Biomaterials for cell delivery exist, providing an efficient tool to improve cell retention, survival, differentiation, and integration. This paper will review the potentials of the biomaterials approach for the damaged CNS in COVID-19. It mainly includes biomaterials for promoting synaptic plasticity and modulation of inflammation in the post-stroke brain, extracellular vesicles, exosomes, and conductive biomaterials to facilitate neural regeneration, and artificial nerve conduits for treatment of neuropathies. Also, biosensing surfaces applicable to the first sensory interface between the host and the virus that encourage the generation of accelerated anti-viral immunity theoretically offer hope in solving COVID-19.","Saghazadeh, Amene; Rezaei, Nima",Emergent Mater,563,24

During the patient's period of isolation (February 5th to February 29th, 2020), the author used Roy's adaptation model to perform first-level holistic physical, psychological, and social nursing assessments and collected health-problem information using face-to-face interviews, telephone interviews, and observations via a remote monitoring system. A second level of assessment confirmed that the problems faced by the patient included (1) existing infections related to COVID-19 and (2) anxiety related to uncertainties about disease prognosis, forgiveness from the family, and potential violations of personal privacy by the media. Due to the special nature of the isolation ward, the author used a remote physiological monitoring system to monitor the vital signs, fever, and shortness of breath status of the patient to quickly decrease her physical discomfort and to improve her self-care ability during hospitalization. Environmental cleanliness was strictly maintained to reduce the risk of cross-infection and ensure patient safety. To alleviate patient anxiety, the author established a good therapeutic interpersonal relationship with the patient by making 10-60 minutes of caring calls to her each day, by providing individual care measures, and by using the Internet to play audio and video to teach mindfulness meditation. Caring for COVID-19 cases is a completely new experience. The author hopes that this experience may be used as a reference for caregivers.","Hsu, Tsang-Ching; Wu, Chia-Chien; Lai, Pei-Yu; Syue, Ling-Shan; Lai, Yi-Yin; Ko, Nai-Ying",Hu Li Za Zhi,563,20

METHODS: 5299 voluntary health workers were enrolled from 28 April 2020 to 28 July 2020 to assess immunological response to SARS-CoV-2 infection throughout IgM, IgG and IgA serum levels titration by four laboratory tests. Association of antibody titre with several demographic variables, swab tests and performance tests (sensitivity, specificity, and agreement) were statistically analyzed. RESULTS: The overall seroprevalence was 6%, considering either IgG and IgM, and 4.8% considering IgG. Working in COVID-19 Units was not associated with a statistically significant increase in the number of infected workers. Cohen's kappa of agreement between MaglumiTM and VivaDiagTM was quite good when considering IgG only (Cohen's kappa = 78.1%, 95% CI 74.0-82.0%), but was lower considering IgM (Cohen's kappa = 13.3%, 95% CI 7.8-18.7%). CONCLUSION: The large sample size with high participation (84.7%), the biobank and the longitudinal design were significant achievements, offering a baseline dataset as the benchmark for risk assessment, health surveillance and management of SARS-CoV-2 infection for the hospital workforce, especially considering the ongoing vaccination campaign.

In Alberta, two novel approaches were created in Spring 2020 to remotely support patients with complex neurological conditions and rehabilitation needs. The first approach is a telehealth service that provides wayfinding and self-management advice to Albertans with physical concerns related to existing neurological or musculoskeletal conditions or post-COVID-19 recovery needs. The second approach is a webinar series aimed at supporting self-management and social connectedness of individuals living with spinal cord injury. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the short- and long- term impacts and sustainability of two virtual modalities aimed at advancing self-management, connectedness and rehabilitation needs during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond. METHODS: We will use a mixed-methods evaluation approach. Evaluation of both approaches will include one-on-one semi-structured interviews and surveys. The evaluation of the telehealth initiative will include secondary data analyses as well as analysis of call data using artificial intelligence. The evaluation of the webinar series will include analysis of poll questions collected during the webinars as well as YouTube analytics data. RESULTS: The proposed study describes unique pandemic virtual modalities and our approaches to evaluating them to ensure effectiveness and sustainability. Implementing and evaluating these virtual modalities synchronously allows for the building of knowledge on the complementarity of these methods. At the time of submission, we have completed qualitative and quantitative data collection for the telehealth evaluation. For the webinar series, so far we have distributed the evaluation survey following three webinars and have conducted five attendee interviews. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, understanding the impact and sustainability of the proposed telehealth modalities is important. The results of the evaluation will provide data that can be actioned and serve to improve other telehealth modalities in the future since health systems need this information to make decisions on resource allocation, especially in an uncertain pandemic climate. Evaluating the RAL and AB-SCILS to ensure their effectiveness demonstrates that Alberta Health Services and the health system cares about ensuring best practice even after a shift to primarily virtual care.","Brehon, K.; Carriere, J.; Churchill, K.; Loyola-Sanchez, A.; O039,; Connell, P.; Papathanasoglou, E.; MacIsaac, R.; Tavakoli, M.; Ho, C.; Pohar Manhas, K.",JMIR Res Protoc,563,15

METHODS: A single-center review of protocols and practices designed to limit COVID-19 transmission. RESULTS: All patients were tested within 72 hours prior to the procedure with a COVID-19 nasal swab to assess for active disease. A distance of 6 ft between each stretcher and the staff within the ASC was maintained when possible. Preoperative anesthetizing and dilating eye drops were administered from multiuse bottles without contact with surfaces. Surgical cases were restarted at a reduced capacity of a maximum of 7 per day to distance patient arrivals. Removal of waiting room chairs and the creation of new break areas allowed for social distancing. CONCLUSION: As recommendations change on the basis of an increased understanding of the COVID-19 virus, ophthalmologists and ASC staff need to tailor protocols and workflows to limit transmission of virus with resumption of ocular surgery.","Berkenstock, Meghan K; Ishii, Lisa; Giessler, Brian; Quaty, John; Biggs, Madalyn; Buck, Pamela; Ebrado, Alfred; Kalendek, Laurie; Lazoff, Karen; Martin, Michael; McCullough, Chanda; Jampel, Henry; Scott, Adrienne W",Qual Manag Health Care,563,16

As such, community pharmacists can play a vital role in a country's response to various preventative and public health measures amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Given the essential nature of community pharmacy as a health service, community pharmacies are unlikely to shut down in any foreseeable lockdown scenario. It is therefore important to assess the preventative measure directives for community pharmacies that are in place to safeguard community pharmacy personnel from SARS-CoV-2 in the various parts of the world. Upon reviewing the recommendations of 15 selected countries across five continents (Asia, Europe, Oceania, North America, and Africa) on social distancing and the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) in community pharmacies, we found inconsistencies in the recommended social distance to be practiced within the community pharmacies. There were also varying recommendations on the use of PPE by the pharmacy personnel. Despite the differences in the recommendations, maintaining recommended social distance and the wearing of appropriate PPE is of utmost importance for healthcare workers, including community pharmacy personnel dealing with day-to-day patient care activities, though full PPE should be worn when dealing with suspected COVID-19 patients.","Hasan, Syed Shahzad; Kow, Chia Siang; Zaidi, Syed Tabish Razi",Res. soc. adm. pharm,563,20

Here we share the donor presentations evaluated in a lung transplant center during the COVID-19 pandemic, the measures taken at every stage of transplant management, and the outcomes of our transplants. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data from 15 lung donors selected by the national coordination center pre - sented to our lung transplant center as of March 11, 2020, when the first COVID-19 case was reported in Turkey, and data of 5 lung transplant cases in this period were retrospectively analyzed. All donors were examined in detail for COVID-19 disease. Procurement processes for accepted donors, transplant surgeries of recipients, and postoperative follow-up and care processes of recipients were carried out with the least number of personnel, but all with appropriate personal protective equipment. RESULTS: There were 15 donor organs procured by our center during a 9-month period coincident with the COVID-19 pandemic. The number of donor pre - sentations to our center between the same dates in the previous year was 78. Five of the 15 donors were accepted, and of those accepted, 4 were male and 1 was female. There was no statistically significant difference between the accepted and rejected donors in terms of the ratio of Pao2 to fraction of inspired oxygen, age, duration of endotracheal intubation (days), and smoking (pack-years).

Based on an online survey performed in March and April 2020 the study provides first insights into Slovenian tourists’ perceived threats of covid-19 on two dimensions: severity and susceptibility;how this depends on their demography and past travel experience and what, in this specific point in time, they think about future travel avoidance. The results have shown that age affects the two measured dimensions of perceived threat and future travel avoidance, but only with women. Furthermore, people who have travelled the most in the past express the least likelihood of avoidance to travel due to the covid -19 pandemic. Those who are more educated, on the other hand, perceive higher risk, yet education has no role in their expressed future travel avoidance. The results, moreover, show that the moral obligation towards taking care of others might be a highly important element in the success factor of covid-19 measures and thus future appeals by the tourism industry. Finally, the results show that we cannot easily predict how the general population will behave regarding their future travel avoidance since the opinions are not polarised in the extremes. This does indicate, however, that tourists will be susceptible to the context-specific factors of future travel decisions, such as assurances of health safety provided by the tourism industry.","Turnšek, Maja Brumen Boštjan Rangus Marjetka Gorenak Mitja Mekinc Janez Štuhec Tanja Lešnik",Academica Turistica,563,1

For differential expression analysis of markers between conditions, only few tools exist. These tools either reduce the data distribution to medians, discarding valuable information, or have underlying assumptions that may not hold for all expression patterns. Here, we systematically evaluated existing and novel approaches for differential expression analysis on real and simulated CyTOF data. We found that methods using median marker expressions compute fast and reliable results when the data is not strongly zero-inflated. Methods using all data detect changes in strongly zero-inflated markers, but partially suffer from overprediction or cannot handle big datasets. We present a new method, CyEMD, based on calculating the Earth Movers Distance between expression distributions that can handle strong zero-inflation without being too sensitive.

Under nutrition is the result of insufficient intake of food, poor utilization of nutrients due to illnesses, or a combination of these factors. The purpose of this study was to identify associated risk factors and assess the variation of underweight among under-five children of different regions in Ethiopia. Methods: Ethiopian Demography and Health Survey (EDHS-2016) weight-to-age data for under-five children is used. In order to achieve the objective of this study; descriptive, single level and multilevel ordinal logistic regression analysis were used. Results: From a total of 8935 children about 8.1% were severely underweight, 17.1% were moderately underweight and 74.8% were normal. The test of heterogeneity suggested that underweight varies among region and multilevel ordinal model fit data better than single level ordinal model. Conclusion: Educational level of mother, religion, birth order, type of birth, sex of child, mother body mass index, birth size of child, existence of diarrhea for last two weeks before survey, existence of fever for last two weeks before survey, duration of breast feeding, age child and wealth index had significant effect on underweight among under-five children in Ethiopia. The finding revealed that among the fitted multilevel partial proportional odds model, the random intercept model with fixed coefficients is appropriate to assess the risk factors of underweight among under-five children in Ethiopia. The findings of this study have important policy implications. The government should work closely with both the private sector and civil society to teach women to have sufficient knowledge, awareness and mechanisms of improving under-five underweight for children's wellbeing.","Birhan, Nigussie Adam; Belay, Denekew Bitew",Afr Health Sci,563,29

To support call center companies, the Korean Ministry of Employment and Labor has proposed covering the costs of installing partitions and air purifiers, providing hand sanitizers, and supplying masks to prevent droplet and aerosol infections. Air purifiers are expected to be installed on the floor with the exhaust outlets at a higher level, such as the level of the desks or breathing zones of workers. When a worker coughs or releases droplets near a colleague's respiratory system, the droplets may spread throughout the call center via air flow from air purifier. In this fashion, a single infected person can give rise to an infection cluster. Attempts to prevent infection must not lead to new infections, and the installation of air purifiers may cause new problems. Therefore, using air purifiers to control the spread of COVID-19 should be approached with caution.","Ham, Seunghon",Epidemiol Health,563,16

Further, colistin has been also used to prevent and treat Enterobacteriaceae infections in food animals. However, chromosomal mutations and mobile colistin resistance (mcr) genes, which confer resistance to colistin, have been detected in bacterial isolates from food animals and humans worldwide; thus, limiting the use of colistin. Therefore, strategies that could aid in ameliorating colistin resistance are critically needed. Objective: Investigate the adjuvant potential of novel small molecules (SMs) on colistin. Materials and Methods: Previously, we identified 11 membrane-affecting SMs with bactericidal activity against avian pathogenic Escherichia coli (APEC). Here, we investigated the potentiation effect of those SMs on colistin using checkerboard assays and wax moth (Galleria mellonella) larval model. The impact of the SM combination on colistin resistance evolution was also investigated by analyzing whole genome sequences of APEC isolates passaged with colistin alone or in combination with SMs followed by quantitating pmrCAB and pmrH expression in those isolates. Results: The SM combination synergistically reduced the minimum bactericidal concentration of colistin by at least 10-fold. In larvae, the SM combination increased the efficacy of colistin by two-fold with enhanced (>50%) survival and reduced (>4 logs) APEC load. Further, the SM combination decreased the frequency (5/6 to 1/6) of colistin resistance evolution and downregulated the pmrCAB and pmrH expression. Previously unknown mutations in pmrB (L14Q, T92P) and pmrA (A80V), which were predicted deleterious, were identified in the colistin-resistant (ColR) APEC isolates when passaged with colistin alone but not in combination with SMs. Our study also identified mutations in hypothetical and several phage-related proteins in ColR APEC isolates in concurrent with pmrAB mutations. Conclusion: Our study identified two SMs (SM2 and SM3) that potentiated the colistin activity and attenuated the development of colistin resistance in APEC. These SMs can be developed as anti-evolution drugs that can slow down colistin resistance development.","Kathayat, Dipak; Antony, Linto; Deblais, Loic; Helmy, Yosra A; Scaria, Joy; Rajashekara, Gireesh",Infect Drug Resist,563,1

The main protease of SARS-CoV-2 plays a key role in the replication and propagation of the virus in the host cells. Inhibiting the protease blocks the replication of the virus; therefore it is considered as an attractive therapeutic target. Here we describe the screening of the DrugBank database, a public repository for small molecule therapeutics, to identify approved or experimental phase drugs that can be repurposed against the main protease of SARS-CoV-2. The initial screening was performed on more than 13,000 drug entries in the target database using an energy optimised pharmacophore hypothesis AARRR. A sub-set of the molecules selected based on the fitness score was further screened using molecular docking by sequentially filtering the molecules through the high throughput virtual screening, extra precision and standard precision docking modalities. The best hits were subjected to binding free energy estimation using the MM-GBSA method. Approved drugs viz, Cobicistat, Larotrectinib and Simeprevir were identified as potential candidates for repurposing. Drugs in the discovery phase identified as inhibitors include the known cysteine protease inhibitors, Calpain inhibitor IV and an experimental cathepsin F inhibitor. In order to analyse the stability of the binding interactions, the known cysteine protease inhibitors viz, Simeprevir, calpain inhibitor IV and the cathepsin F inhibitor in complex Mpro were subjected to molecular dynamics simulations at 100 ns. Based on the results Simeprevir was found to be a strong inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

This contrasts with the preceding epidemics of the closely related SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, both of which evolved adaptively. It is possible that the SARS-CoV-2 exhibits a unique or adaptive feature which deviates from other coronaviruses. Alternatively, the virus may have been cryptically circulating in humans for a sufficient time to have acquired adaptive changes for efficient transmission before the onset of the current pandemic. In order to test the above scenarios, we analyzed the SARS-CoV-2 sequences from minks (Neovision vision) and parenteral human strains. In the early phase of the mink epidemic (April to May 2020), nonsynonymous to synonymous mutation ratios per site within the spike protein was 2.93, indicating a selection process favoring adaptive amino acid changes. In addition, mutations within this protein concentrated within its receptor binding domain and receptor binding motif. Positive selection also left a trace on linked neutral variation. An excess of high frequency derived variants produced by genetic hitchhiking was found during middle (June to July 2020) and early late (August to September 2020) phases of the mink epidemic, but quickly diminished in October and November 2020. Strong positive selection found in SARS-CoV-2 from minks implies that the virus may be not unique in super-adapting to a wide range of new hosts. The mink study suggests that SARS-CoV-2 already went through adaptive evolution in humans, and likely been circulating in humans at least six months before the first case found in Wuhan, China. We also discuss circumstances under which the virus can be well-adapted to its host but fail to induce an outbreak.","Tai, Jui-Hung; Chaw, Shu-Miaw; Sun, Hsiao-Yu; Tseng, Yi-Cheng; Li, Guanghao; Chang, Sui-Yuan; Yeh, Shiou-Hwei; Chen, Pei-Jer; Wang, Hurng-Yi",,563,16

This study reflects clinical data on South African children with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). METHODS: We collected clinical data of children aged younger than 13 years with laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 presenting to Tygerberg Hospital, Cape Town between 17th of April and 24th of July 2020. RESULTS: Hundred and fifty-nine children (median age 48·0 months (interquartile range, IQR 12·0-106·0)) were included. Hospitalized children (n=62), median age of 13·5 months (IQR 1·8-43·5) were younger than children not admitted (n=97), median age 81·0 months (IQR 34·5-120·5, p< 0·01). Thirty-three of 159 (20·8%) children had pre-existing medical conditions. Fifty-one of 62 (82·3%) hospitalized children were symptomatic; lower respiratory tract infection was diagnosed in 21/51 (41·2%) and 11/16 (68·8%) children younger than 3 months of age. Respiratory support was required in 25/51 (49·0%) children; 13/25 (52·0%) children were younger than 3 months. One child was HIV infected and 11/51 (21·2%) were HIV exposed uninfected and 7/51 (13·7%) children had a recent or new diagnosis of tuberculosis. CONCLUSION: Children less than 1 year of age hospitalized with SARS-CoV-2 in Cape Town frequently required respiratory support, the access to oxygen may be limited in some LMICs which could potentially drive morbidity and mortality. HIV infection was uncommon but a relationship between HIV exposure, tuberculosis and SARS-CoV-2 should be explored.","van der Zalm, Marieke M; Lishman, Juanita; Verhagen, Lilly M; Redfern, Andrew; Smit, Liezl; Barday, Mikhail; Ruttens, Dries; da Costa, A039; ishah,; van Jaarsveld, Sandra; Itana, Justina; Schrueder, Neshaad; Van Schalkwyk, Marije; Parker, Noor; Appel, Ilse; Fourie, Barend; Claassen, Mathilda; Workman, Jessica J; Goussard, Pierre; Van Zyl, Gert; Rabie, Helena",Clin. infect. dis,563,16

Within a very short time, our knowledge regarding basic physiologic pathways that participate in SARS CoV-2 invasion and subsequent organ damage have been dramatically expanded. In particular, we now better understand the complexity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) and the important role of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)-2 in viral binding. Furthermore, the critical role of its major product, angiotensin (Ang) 1-7, in maintaining microcirculatory balance and in the control of activated pro-inflammatory and pro-coagulant pathways, generated in this disease, have been clarified. The kalikrein-bradykinin (BK) system and chymase are intensively interwoven with RAAS through many pathways with complex reciprocal interactions. Yet, so far, very little attention has been paid to a possible role of these physiologic pathways in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 disease, even though BK and chymase exert many physiologic changes characteristic to this disorder. Herein we outline the current knowledge regarding the reciprocal interactions of RAAS, BK and chymase that are probably turned-on in COVID-19 disease and participate in its clinical features. Interventions affecting these systems, such as the inhibition of chymase or blocking BKB1R/BKB2R might be explored as potential novel therapeutic strategies in this devastating disorder.","Abassi, Zaid; Skorecki, Karl; Hamo-Giladi, Dalit Ben; Kruzel-Davila, Etty; Heyman, Samuel N","Am. j. physiol., lung cell. mol. physiol",563,1

This study aimed to examine differences in rates and types of pharmacist interventions related to COVID-19 and medication dispensing errors (MDEs) across community pharmacies with and without telepharmacy services. METHODS: This was a prospective, disguised, observational study conducted over four months (from March 2020 to July 2020) in 52 community pharmacies (26 with and 26 without telepharmacy) across all seven states of the United Arab Emirates using proportionate random sampling. A standardised data-collection form was developed to include information about patient status, pharmacist interventions and MDEs. RESULTS: The test (telepharmacy) group pharmacies provided pharmaceutical care to 19,974 patients, of whom 6371 (31.90%) and 1213 (6.07%) were probable and confirmed cases of COVID-19, respectively. The control group pharmacies provided care to 9151 patients, of whom 1074 (11.74%) and 33 (0.36%) were probable and confirmed cases of COVID-19, respectively. Rates of MDEs and their subcategories, prescription-related errors and pharmacist counselling errors across pharmacies with telepharmacy versus those without remote services were 15.81% versus 19.43% (p < 0.05), 5.38% versus 10.08% (p < 0.05) and 10.42% versus 9.35% (p > 0.05), respectively.

Here we introduce a metapopulation susceptible-exposed-infectious-removed (SEIR) model that integrates fine-grained, dynamic mobility networks to simulate the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in ten of the largest US metropolitan areas. Our mobility networks are derived from mobile phone data and map the hourly movements of 98 million people from neighbourhoods (or census block groups) to points of interest such as restaurants and religious establishments, connecting 56,945 census block groups to 552,758 points of interest with 5.4 billion hourly edges. We show that by integrating these networks, a relatively simple SEIR model can accurately fit the real case trajectory, despite substantial changes in the behaviour of the population over time. Our model predicts that a small minority of 'superspreader' points of interest account for a large majority of the infections, and that restricting the maximum occupancy at each point of interest is more effective than uniformly reducing mobility. Our model also correctly predicts higher infection rates among disadvantaged racial and socioeconomic groups2-8 solely as the result of differences in mobility: we find that disadvantaged groups have not been able to reduce their mobility as sharply, and that the points of interest that they visit are more crowded and are therefore associated with higher risk. By capturing who is infected at which locations, our model supports detailed analyses that can inform more-effective and equitable policy responses to COVID-19.","Chang, Serina; Pierson, Emma; Koh, Pang Wei; Gerardin, Jaline; Redbird, Beth; Grusky, David; Leskovec, Jure",Nature,563,1

To this end, we collaborate with one of the main cellular network providers in Brazil, and collect and analyze cellular network connections from 1400 antennas for all users in the city of Rio de Janeiro and its suburbs from March 1, 2020 to July 1, 2020. Our analysis reveals that the total number of cellular connections decreases to 78% during the lockdown phase and then increases to 85% of the pre-COVID era as the lockdown eases. We observe that as more people work remotely, there is a shift in the antennas incurring top 10% of the total traffic, with the number of connections made to antennas in downtown Rio reducing drastically and antennas at other locations taking their place. We also observe that while nearly 40-45% users connected to only 1 antenna each day during the lockdown phase indicating no mobility, there are around 4% users (i.e., 80K users) who connected to more than 10 antennas, indicating very high mobility. Finally, we design an interactive tool that showcases mobility patterns in different granularities that can potentially help people and government officials understand the mobility of individuals and the number of COVID cases in a particular neighborhood. Our analysis, inferences, and interactive showcasing of mobility patterns based on large-scale data can be extrapolated to other cities of the world and has the potential to help in designing more effective pandemic management measures in the future.","Ayan, Necati A.; Damasceno, Nilson L.; Chaskar, Sushil; Sousa, Peron R. de; Ramesh, Arti; Seetharam, Anand; Rocha, Antonio A. de A.",,563,16

Our oncology service (at an Irish national cancer centre) rapidly transitioned to the use of telemedicine or virtual clinics (VC) to minimise potential risk of exposure to COVID-19 amongst an immunosuppressed, high-risk population. Our study aimed to evaluate the use of VC in this setting. METHODS: An 18-point questionnaire was designed to investigate the patient experience of VC during the COVID-19 pandemic in Ireland and compliance with guidelines developed in Ireland to conduct VC and the role of VC in the future. Questionnaires were distributed following the receipt of verbal consent from patients during the VC. Descriptive statistics were utilised for data analysis using SPSS®. RESULTS: One hundred and four patients returned completed surveys (n = 104/164, 63% response rate). Overall satisfaction levels were high with most patients (n = 58/100, 58%; no answer provided (NAP), n = 4) equally satisfied or nearly equally satisfied with VC in comparison to a usual clinic encounter.

The aims of this study were to describe the diet and its nutritional quality in Spanish households during the first COVID-19 epidemic wave and to compare them with the same period in 2019. Data on monthly foods and beverages household purchases in 2019 and 2020 were obtained from the nationwide Food Consumption Surveys. In April, there was an average increase, compared with 2019, of more than 40% for all food groups, with significant peaks in: alcoholic beverages (75%), appetizers (60%), eggs (59%), sugar and sweets (52%), and vegetables (50%). In March, the greatest peak was for pulses, with a 63% increment. The mean energy value of purchased foods in April was 2801 kcal/person/day, corresponding to an increase of 771 kcal/person/day (+38%), compared to the same month of 2019 (March and May: +520 kcal (+26%), June: +343 kcal (+18%)). Regarding nutrient density, there was a reduction in calcium, iodine, zinc, selenium, riboflavin, vitamins B12, D, A, especially retinol, and an increase in fibre, sodium, folic acid, carotenes and vitamin E. Alcohol content per 1000 kcal increased by more than 20% from April to July. Food purchase patterns in Spanish households changed during lockdown and after it, with no appreciable improvement in the quality of the diet.","Del Pozo de la Calle, Susana; Alonso Ledesma, Isabel; Nuñez, Olivier; Castelló Pastor, Adela; Lope Carvajal, Virginia; Fernández de Larrea Baz, Nerea; Pérez-Gómez, Beatriz; Pollán, Marina; Ruiz Moreno, Emma",Nutrients,563,1

In medicine, murine models are, and will be indispensable for long, thanks to their reasonable cost and huge choice of transgenic strains and molecular tools. On the other side, non-human primates remain the best animal models although their use is limited because of financial and obvious ethical reasons. In the field of respiratory diseases, specific clinical models such as sheep and cotton rat for bronchiolitis, or ferret and Syrian hamster for influenza and Covid-19, have been successfully developed, however, in these species, the toolbox for biological analysis remains scarce. In this view the porcine medical model is appearing as the third, intermediate, choice, between murine and primate. Herein we would like to present the pros and cons of pig as a model for acquired respiratory conditions, through an immunological point of view. Indeed, important progresses have been made in pig immunology during the last decade that allowed the precise description of immune molecules and cell phenotypes and functions. These progresses might allow the use of pig as clinical model of human respiratory diseases but also as a species of interest to perform basic research explorations.","Bertho, Nicolas; Meurens, François",Mol Immunol,563,10

Fear of death and suffering are acutely elevated in Black communities; yet, African Americans have been facing, coping with, and overcoming American societal racism and subsequent detriments to our mental health for centuries. Predominately African American churches (hereafter referred to as the ""Black Church"") have always served a historical, cultural, contextual, and scientifically validated role in the mental health well-being of African American communities coping with American racism. Nonetheless, buildings of worship closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic in mid-March 2020. This article is a first-hand perspective of five Black internists/psychiatrists who are deeply involved in both academic medicine and leadership positions within the Black Church. It will explore how the physical closure of Black Churches during this period of increased mental stress, as caused by healthcare inequities revealed by the COVID-19 epidemic, is likely to be uniquely taxing to the mental health of African Americans, particularly older African Americans, who must cope with American racism without physical access to the Black Church for the first time in history.","DeSouza, Flavia; Parker, Carmen Black; Spearman-McCarthy, E Vanessa; Duncan, Gina Newsome; Black, Reverend Maria Myers",J. racial ethnic health disparities (Internet),563,15

For such issues, a common thread of research uses adversarial reactions, e.g., replies pointing out factual inaccuracies in rumors. Though adversarial reactions are prevalent in online conversations, inferring those adverse views (or stance) from the text in replies is difficult and requires complex natural language processing (NLP) models. Moreover, conventional NLP models for stance mining need labeled data for supervised learning. Getting labeled conversations can itself be challenging as conversations can be on any topic, and topics change over time. These challenges make learning the stance a difficult NLP problem. In this research, we first create a new stance dataset comprised of three different topics by labeling both users' opinions on the topics (as in pro/con) and users' stance while replying to others' posts (as in favor/oppose). As we find limitations with supervised approaches, we propose a weakly-supervised approach to predict the stance in Twitter replies. Our novel method allows using a smaller number of hashtags to generate weak labels for Twitter replies. Compared to supervised learning, our method improves the mean F1-macro by 8\% on the hand-labeled dataset without using any hand-labeled examples in the training set. We further show the applicability of our proposed method on COVID 19 related conversations on Twitter.","Kumar, Sumeet; Cox, Ramon Villa; Babcock, Matthew; Carley, Kathleen M.",,563,29

Apart from the anti-viral strategy, the supports of immune effectors and modulation of immunosuppressive mechanisms is the rationale immunomodulation approach in COVID-19 management. Diet and nutrition are essential for healthy immunity. However, a group of micronutrients plays a dominant role in immunomodulation. The deficiency of most nutrients increases the individual susceptibility to virus infection with a tendency for severe clinical presentation. Despite a shred of evidence, the supplementation of a single nutrient is not promising in the general population. Individuals at high-risk for specific nutrient deficiencies likely benefit from supplementation.

We aimed to share our strategy in handling neurosurgical emergencies at a remote center in Borneo island. Our objectives included discussing the logistic and geographic challenges faced during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Miri General Hospital is a remote center in Sarawak, Malaysia, serving a population with difficult access to neurosurgical services. Two neurosurgeons were stationed here on a rotational basis every fortnight during the pandemic to handle neurosurgical cases. Patients were triaged depending on their urgent needs for surgery or transfer to a neurosurgical center and managed accordingly. All patients were screened for potential risk of contracting COVID-19 prior to the surgery. Based on this, the level of personal protective equipment required for the health care workers involved was determined. RESULTS: During the initial 6 weeks of the Movement Control Order in Malaysia, there were 50 urgent neurosurgical consultations. Twenty patients (40%) required emergency surgery or intervention. There were 9 vascular (45%), 5 trauma (25%), 4 tumor (20%), and 2 hydrocephalus cases (10%). Eighteen patients were operated at Miri General Hospital, among whom 17 (94.4%) survived. Ninety percent of anticipated transfers were avoided. None of the medical staff acquired COVID-19.

Health Care Workers (HCWs) with sound knowledge and practices can help curb the pandemic. This study aimed to assess the knowledge, attitude and practices of HCWs about COVID-19 and compare physicians and non-physicians in Saudi Arabia. METHODS: An online survey was conducted among HCWs in Saudi Arabia in March and April 2020. Data were collected using a structured questionnaire having four sections including; socio-demographic and professional profile, knowledge, attitude and practices regarding COVID-19. Questionnaire link was sent through social media. Descriptive analysis was used for assessment of knowledge, attitude and practice and Chi-square test was used for comparing physicians and non-physicians. Data were analyzed using SPSS version 21.0. RESULTS: A total of 398 HCWs completed the questionnaire. Only 45% of the participants had correct knowledge about the agent while about 97% knew that close contact with infected person is the most important risk factor. Only 63% had correct knowledge about the role of antibiotics in COVID-19 treatment. Majority of the HCWs were worried and most frequently reported worry was risk to family. Carrying infection to home was most commonly reported fear, 92%. Cleaning hands often or always was 11.5% and 87% respectively. About 71% wore mask during work. Knowledge was better among physicians compared to non-physicians while attitude and practices were comparable between the two groups. CONCLUSION: We found that there was poor knowledge about causative agent and role of antibiotics for COVID-19 but for mode of transmission and prevention there was good knowledge. There were widely prevalent worries and fears among the participants. Overall, there were good infection control practices among the HCWs.

These processes occur over considerably different length and time scales; consequently, linking them to the biomechanical properties of the lungs, and quantifying how they together control the spatiotemporal features of inhalation, remains a challenge. We address this challenge by developing a computational model of the lungs as a hierarchical, branched network of connected liquid-lined flexible cylinders coupled to a viscoelastic thoracic cavity. Each branch opens at a rate and a pressure that is determined by input biomechanical parameters, enabling us to test the influence of changes in the mechanical properties of lung tissues and secretions on inhalation dynamics. By summing the dynamics of all the branches, we quantify the evolution of overall lung pressure and volume during inhalation, reproducing the shape of measured breathing curves. Using this model, we demonstrate how changes in lung muscle contraction, mucus viscosity and surface tension, and airway wall stiffness---characteristic of many respiratory diseases, including those arising from COVID-19, cystic fibrosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, and emphysema---drastically alter inhaled lung capacity and breathing duration. Our work therefore helps to identify the key factors that control breathing dynamics, and provides a way to quantify how disease-induced changes in these factors lead to respiratory distress.","Louf, Jean-Franccois; Kratz, Felix; Datta, Sujit S.",,563,33

Aims This study screened for psychopathology and evaluated the efficacy of a brief, social contact-based video intervention in increasing treatment-seeking intentions among healthcare workers (trial registration: NCT04497415). We anticipated finding high rates of psychopathology and greater treatment-seeking intentions post-intervention. Method Healthcare workers (n = 350) were randomised to (a) a brief video-based intervention at day 1, coupled with a booster video at day 14;(b) the video at day 1 only;or (c) a non-intervention control. In the 3 min video, a female nurse described difficulty coping with stress, her anxieties and depression, barriers to care and how therapy helped her. Assessments were conducted pre- and post-intervention and at 14- and 30-day follow-ups. Results Of the 350 healthcare workers, 281 (80%) reported probable anxiety, depression and/or PTSD. Participants were principally nurses (n = 237;68%), physicians (n = 52;15%) and emergency medical technicians (n = 30;9%). The brief video-based intervention yielded greater increases in treatment-seeking intentions than the control condition, particularly among participants in the repeat-video group. Exploratory analysis revealed that in both video groups, we found greater effect among nurses than non-nurses. Conclusions A brief video-based intervention increased treatment-seeking intention, possibly through identification and emotional engagement with the video protagonist. A booster video magnified that effect. This easily disseminated intervention could increase the likelihood of seeking care and offer employers a proactive approach to encourage employees to search for help if needed.

Pregnant women are known to be disproportionately affected by respiratory illnesses, which are associated with increased infectious morbidity and high maternal mortality rates. Aim: To study the management of COVID-19 in pregnancy and its perinatal outcome. Materials and Methods: This prospective observational study was conducted in the Obstetrics and Gynaecology Department from March 2020 to September 2020. To evaluate the effects of COVID-19 in pregnancy and to determine the maternal and fetal outcomes in COVID-19 positive patients. In order to evaluate the pattern of caesarean and vaginal deliveries in COVID-19 and non COVID-19 patients, chi-square test was done. Results: A total of 150 COVID-19 positive patients were admitted to the COVID-19 labour room and out of them 142 (94.67%) were antenatal and 8 (5.33%) were postnatal. Total number of the deliveries in this period was 80 (53.33%) and out of them vaginal deliveries were 35 (23.33%) and caesarean section were 45 (30%). A 6 (7.50%) babies with poor Appearance, Pulse, Grimace, Activity, Respiration (APGAR) score were admitted to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) and 70 (87.50%) had good APGAR after delivery, four had Intrauterine Death (IUD). Conclusion: The pregnant women with suspected COVID-19 who need medical care should be transferred to a hospital equipped with sufficient health facilities and fully trained clinicians to take proper care of critically ill obstetric patients for effective management.","Sibia, P.; Kaur, N.; Sibia, R.

Afterward, these formulations were evaluated (in vitro and in vivo) for their potential against CRC.Methods: The SLNs were synthesized by employing the solvent diffusion technique, and then they were entrapped in the MBs. The prepared uncoupled and coupled SLNs (SLN-OP and FA-SLN-OP, respectively) were examined for in vitro cytotoxicity effect against COLO-205. Gamma-scintigraphy study was used for determining biodistribution (in vivo) of drug in different organs through MBs.Results: Outcomes for FA-SLN-OP revealed more cytotoxicity (IC50 = 6.8 µg/ml) against COLO-205 cells (in vitro) than OP solution (50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) = 8.0 µg/ml) and SLN-OP (IC50 = 7.5 µg/ml). MBs were also investigated in vivo using Gamma-scintigraphy study. After 48 h study, 99mTc-EuB-FA-SLN-OP confirmed an elevated level of drug in the colonic tumor, which was found significantly (p < 0.0001) higher than that of 99mTc-EuB-SLN-OP.Conclusions: In conclusion, developed MBs formulation (99mTc-EuB-FA-SLN-OP) suggested promising results against therapy of CRC using dual targeting (i.e., ligand-directed and pH-awakened) approach.","Rajpoot, Kuldeep; Jain, Sunil K",J Microencapsul,563,29

A multistep project was undertaken with the intent to develop, validate, and implement an acute care clinical pharmacist productivity model. The initial step of the project was designed to identify, define, prioritize, and weight a comprehensive list of daily pharmacist responsibilities stratified by relative time spent on each function via consensus. METHODS: Delphi methodology applied by a panel of experts was used to identify a comprehensive list of acute care pharmacist responsibilities ranked in order of time intensity. Twenty-three acute care clinical pharmacists participated in the process. The consensus list was validated by time observation studies. Each responsibility was assigned a weight and corresponding work outputs by a consensus panel. Weighting of each responsibility was assigned according to the relative time intensity and complexity of each task. RESULTS: The results of the Delphi consensus process included the top 20 time-intensive responsibilities identified by the acute care clinical pharmacists. Timed observations of acute care clinical pharmacists yielded results similar to those of the consensus process. Selection of corresponding work outputs and weights for each responsibility provided the final requirements for the productivity model. CONCLUSION: The development of an acute care clinical pharmacist productivity model first requires the selection of appropriate work outputs and weighting. The consensus process provided a newly identified comprehensive list of pharmacist responsibilities that will serve as the foundation of the clinical productivity model. Validated consensus methodology can be useful for engaging clinical pharmacists in decision-making and the development of a clinical productivity model.","Vest, Tyler A; Simmons, Adrienne; Morbitzer, Kathryn A; McLaughlin, Jacqueline E; Cicci, Jonathan; Clarke, Megan; Valgus, John M; Falato, Chris; Waldron, Kayla M",Am J Health Syst Pharm,563,16

In the second case, it is a question of adequately combining theory with observations and subsequently optimizing the mixture. In this work, we proposes the design of time-continuous models of dynamical systems as solutions of differential equations, from non-uniform sampled or noisy observations, using machine learning techniques.

Delays to treatment are particularly prevalent when patients require a transfer from hospitals without EVT capability onsite. A novel computer aided triage system, Viz LVO, has the potential to streamline workflows. This platform includes an image viewer, communication system, and an artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm that automatically identifies suspected LVO strokes on CTA imaging and rapidly triggers alerts. We hypothesize that the Viz application will decrease timeto- treatment. Methods: A prospective database was assessed for patients who presented to a stroke center utilizing Viz LVO in the Mount Sinai Health System in New York and underwent EVT following transfer for LVO stroke between July 2018 and March 2020. This time period was chosen due to the COVID-19 pandemic affecting stroke workflow after March 2020. Time intervals were compared for 55 patients divided into Pre- and Post-Viz cohorts. Results: The median initial door-to-neuroendovascular team (NT) notification time interval was significantly faster (25.0 minutes [IQR=12.0] vs 40.0 minutes [IQR=61.0];p=0.01) with significantly less variation (p&lt;0.05). The median initial door-to-skin puncture time interval was 25 minutes shorter in the Post-Viz cohort, although not statistically significant (p=0.15). Post Viz LVO implementation, the Viz notification was the first NT notification 38% (10/26) of the time. Conclusions: Our preliminary results have shown that Viz LVO implementation is associated with earlier, more consistent NT notification times and potentially treatment times. This platform presents a novel application of AI that can serve as an early warning system and a failsafe to ensure that no LVO is left behind. Further studies are warranted.(Figure Presented).","Morey, J.; Zhang, X.; Yaeger, K.; Fiano, E.; Marayati, N. F.; Kellner, C. P.; De Leacy, R. A.; Doshi, A.; Tuhrim, S.; Fifi, J.",Stroke,563,4

During the study, we observed a 68 kDa protein with fibrinolytic activity. In this study, we cloned the gene (vprSJ4) encoding the 68 kDa protein, a mature Vpr, a minor protease secreted by Bacillus species. vprSJ4 encodes a preproenzyme consisting of 810 amino acids (aa) including signal sequence (28 aa) and prosequence (132 aa). The mature enzyme (650 aa) has a predicted molecular weight of 68,467.35. Unlike Vprs from other B. subtilis strains, VprSJ4 has 4 additional amino acids (DEFA) at the C-terminus. vprSJ4 was overexpressed in Escherichia coli. PreproVprSJ4 was localized in inclusion bodies, and subjected to in vitro renaturation and purification by an affinity column. SDS-PAGE and western blot showed that autoprocessing of preproVprSJ4 occurred and 68 kDa and smaller proteins were produced. The optimum pH and temperature of the recombinant VprSJ4 was pH 7.0 and 40°C, respectively. Kinetic parameters of recombinant VprSJ4 were measured by using an artificial substrate, N-succinyl-ala-ala-pro-phe-p-nitroanilide. Coexpression of vprSJ4 and aprESJ4 using pHY300PLK increased the fibrinolytic activity further (117%) when compared with aprESJ4 single expression using the same vector in B. subtilis WB600.","Yao, Zhuang; Meng, Yu; Le, Huong Giang; Lee, Se Jin; Jeon, Hye Sung; Yoo, Ji Yeon; Kim, Hyun-Jin; Kim, Jeong Hwan",,563,6

Major international conservation groups now comprehensively center larger human-nature imbalances not only as problems of global public health but as a core challenge of the conservation movement, alongside habitat destruction, biodiversity loss and climate change. There is, however, little consideration of how new biosecurity concerns might alter conservation practice with unexpected and potential harmful impacts on human communities, particularly in developing nations with significant human-wildlife interfaces. Reviewing emerging policy positions from key conservation organizations, this article argues that the proposed responses to the COVID-19 pandemic hold the potential to (a) amplify existing people-park conflicts, and (b) generate new tensions by integrating global systems of viral surveillance into biodiversity conservation.

Home healthcare reflects a group of people especially vulnerable to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We aimed to evaluate the pattern of comorbidity and frailty in a group of individuals having fatal outcomes in home healthcare during the COVID-19 pandemic March to September 2020, and to assess the contribution of COVID-19 in the fatal outcomes. METHODS: A cohort of adults with confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis that deceased in home healthcare between March and September 2020 were analysed in a retrospective study comprising home healthcare in 136 facilities in one Swedish county. Main outcome measures were comorbidity and frailty. RESULTS: One hundred fifty-five individuals (88 women, 67 men) aged 57-106 (median 88) years were included in the analysis. Nine had considerable frailty (ability to perform various activities of daily living but confined to bed or chair on occasion) and the remaining 146 had severe frailty (unable to perform activities of daily living and/or confined to bed or chair; dementia necessitating care). Three or more diagnoses besides COVID-19 were present in 142 individuals and another eight had two diagnoses in addition to COVID-19. In 20 (13%) individuals, COVID-19 was assessed as the principal cause of death, in 100 (64.5%) a contributing cause, and for the remaining 35 (22.5%) death was probably caused by another comorbidity. This seemed to change over the course of the COVID - 19 pandemic, with its contributing role decreasing from the middle of the summer. CONCLUSIONS: Death in home healthcare during the first wave of the pandemic mostly affected individuals with severe frailty and comorbidity at very advanced ages. One fifth of the individuals who died in home health care had another cause than Covid-19.

In this paper, we aim to identify the immunity threshold that, if exceeded, would lead to a relatively safe on-campus experience for the university population. With relaxed non-pharmaceutical interventions, we estimated that immunity in at least 60% of the university population is needed for safe university reopening. Still, attention needs to be paid to extreme events that could lead to huge infection size spikes. At an immune level of 60%, continuing non-pharmaceutical interventions, such as wearing masks, could lead to an 89% reduction in the maximum cumulative infection, which reflects the possible non-negligible infection size from extreme events.","Yang, Qihui; Gruenbacher, Don M.; Scoglio, Caterina M.",,563,16

For hourly workers at both small and large businesses, nearly all of the decline in employment occurred between March 14 and 28. It was driven by low-wage services, particularly the retail and leisure and hospitality sectors. A large share of the job losses in small businesses reflected firms that closed entirely, though many subsequently reopened. Firms that were already unhealthy were more likely to close and less likely to reopen, and disadvantaged workers were more likely to be laid off and less likely to return. Most laid-off workers expected to be recalled, and this was predictive of rehiring. Shelter-in-place orders drove only a small share of job losses. Last, states that received more small business loans from the Paycheck Protection Program and states with more generous unemployment insurance benefits had milder declines and faster recoveries.

CONCLUSIÓN: El trasplante hepático no se asocia de manera independiente a una mayor mortalidad. Otros factores, además del trasplante, deben tomarse en cuenta al momento de establecer la gravedad. BACKGROUND: In December 2019, a new beta coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, was identified in the city of Wuhan, China, as a causative agent of severe pneumonia, known as COVID-19, which has led to strict isolation measures, closure of liver transplantation programs and the need to modify treatment protocols. OBJECTIVE: Document the information published so far on the impact of COVID-19 in the population with a history of liver transplantation and establish a treatment protocol. METHOD: MeSH terms were searched for ""SARS-CoV-2"", ""COVID-19"", ""liver transplantation"" and ""treatment"". RESULTS: Up to now, a greater ease in acquiring the virus has been shown in the liver transplant population, without a difference in mortality when compared to the general population. Immunosuppression should continue at the minimum tolerated levels, without suspending calcineurin inhibitors. Of the specific treatment, steroids are those that have shown the greatest clinical benefit and decreased mortality. CONCLUSION: Liver transplantation is not independently associated with higher mortality. Factors other than transplantation must be taken into account when considering the risk of severity.","Pérez-González, Bernardo; Thomas-Lora, Freyris C; Hoyo, Irma; Flores-García, Nayelli C; Rodríguez-Aguilar, Erika F; Páez-Zayas, Víctor M; Márquez-Guillén, Ernesto; Visag-Castillo, Víctor; García-Juárez, Ignacio; Contreras, Alan G",Cir Cir,563,24

However, this article argues that an attendance to things, and to the relational-material entanglements we find ourselves in, might guide us toward a reconsideration of how particular ideals and concepts are (and ought to be) represented in social studies curriculum, teaching, and learning. This article models how social studies analyses of material things in past and current events might take shape, exploring how natural things like Hurricane Maria and COVID-19, as well as human-made things like statues, parks, and textbooks, are both agentic and capable of impacting—diminishing or enhancing—the agency of human beings. We discuss how social studies teachers and teacher educators might enact such a focus in their classrooms, offering examples of how natural and human-made things might be integrated into social studies curriculum and teaching. © 2021 College and University Faculty Assembly of National Council for the Social Studies.","Nelson, P.

The therapeutic effect of dexamethasone may be related to its ability to improve cortical function. Recent study showed that dexamethasone can reduce COVID-19 deaths by up to one third in critically ill patients. The aim of this article is to investigate whether SARS-CoV-2 can attack the adrenal cortex to aggravate the relative adrenal insufficiency. Methods: We summarized the clinical features of COVID-19 reported in currently available observational studies. ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression was examined in human adrenal glands by immunohistochemical staining. We retrospectively analyzed serum cortisol levels in critically ill patients with or without COVID-19. Results: High percentage of critically ill patients with SARS-COV-2 infection in the study were treated with vasopressors. ACE2 receptor and TMPRSS2 serine protease were colocalized in adrenocortical cells in zona fasciculata and zona reticularis. We collected plasma cortisol concentrations in nine critically ill patients with COVID-19. The cortisol levels of critically ill patients with COVID-19 were lower than those in non-COVID-19 critically ill group. Six of the nine COVID-19 critically ill patients had random plasma cortisol concentrations below 10 µg/dl, which met the criteria for the diagnosis of CIRCI. Conclusion: We demonstrate that ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are colocalized in adrenocortical cells, and that the cortisol levels are lower in critically ill patients with COVID-19 as compared to those of non-COVID-19 critically ill patients. Based on our findings, we recommend measuring plasma cortisol level to guide hormonal therapy.","Mao, Yanfei; Xu, Bo; Guan, Wenbin; Xu, Dunfeng; Li, Feng; Ren, Rongrong; Zhu, Xiaoyan; Gao, Yuan; Jiang, Lai",Front Endocrinol (Lausanne),563,13

Among the OR nurses/ technicians 41.9% reported that causes of their stress included inadequate teamwork, ineffective communication, and especially surgeons' negative attitudes. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The stuudie has been held in Clinical Hospital Centre Split, the sample consists of a total of 62 out of 109 possible respondents participated in the study. A total of 23 (37%) anesthesiology technicians and 39 (63%) ICU nurses / technicians participated in the survey. In the empirical part of this research, the importance of selected stressors was tested using quantitative methods in biomedicine. The existence of stress was tested by the Wilcoxon test. Stress level in the ICU was tested by T-test The analysis was elaborated in the statistical software STATISTICA 12. Conclusions were made at a significance level of 5%. The research was conducted through the questionnaire taken from the paper Milan Milosevic entitled: ""Development of a measuring instrument of stress in the workplace hospital health professionals and an assessment of its use value"" (2010). RESULTS: Based on the empirical t value of 3.42 at 59 degrees of freedom the conclusion is that there was found a statistically significant difference in the level of stressors in the workplace between nurses / technicians in the ICU and anesthesiology technicians. The conclusion was reached at an empirical level of significance <0.001. CONCLUSION: The highest level of stress among medical staff is caused by the factor of insufficient number of employees, followed by work overload, inadequate material resources for work (financial constraints), poor organization at work, and the factor of poor communication with superiors.","Russo, Andrea; Pastar, Andela; Sliskovic, Ana; Urlic, Ivan; Skare, Zorana; Mulic, Rosanda",Psychiatr Danub,563,16

AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the working conditions and habits of dermatologists in Turkey during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: This is a survey study with seventeen questions in which two hundred fifteen dermatologists working in Turkey participated. RESULTS: Our results revealed that 53.5% of the participants worked in the areas related to COVID-19 during the pandemic. The average number of dermatology outpatient days in a week was five among the 48.8% of dermatologists, 21.4% of those had three working days, and 18.1% of those had four days. During the pandemic, the most common reasons for referral to outpatient clinics were acne and acneiform eruptions (88.8%), dermatitis (73.5%), and hair loss (71.2%). Participants hesitated to use the following treatments: long-term systemic steroid (77.7%), cyclosporine (69.8%), and methotrexate (60%).

This paper quantitatively assesses the potential of government investments in eco-friendly construction projects to boost the economy and simultaneously realise environmental gains through reduced energy consumption and related greenhouse gas emissions. The analysis uses a Computable General Equilibrium model that examines the macroeconomic impact of the COVID-19 crisis in a small open economy (Belgium). Subsequently, the impact of the proposed policy is assessed through comparative analysis for macroeconomic parameters as well as CO2 equivalent emissions for four scenarios. Our findings demonstrate that the COVID-19 pandemic damages economies considerably, however, the reduction in emissions is less than proportionate. Still, well-designed public policies can reverse this trend, achieving both economic growth and a disproportionally large decrease in emissions. Moreover, the positive effect of such a decoupling policy on GDP is even stronger during the pandemic than compared to the pre-COVID-19 period. This is the result of a targeted, investment-induced green transition towards low energy-intensive economic activities. Finally, this paper describes how the net effect on the government budget is positive through the indirect gains of the economic uptake.","Lahcen, B; Brusselaers, J; Vrancken, K; Dams, Y; Da Silva Paes, C; Eyckmans, J; Rousseau, S",Environ Resour Econ (Dordr),563,24

To address and counterbalance unwanted effects of elastase-related proteases, chemical inhibitors of CatC are being evaluated in preclinical and clinical trials. Neutrophils may contribute to the diffuse alveolar inflammation seen in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) which is currently a growing challenge for intensive care units due to the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic.

There is an urgent need for new drugs for both COVID-19 patients and those with other forms of the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). ARDS in influenza-infected mice is associated with reduced levels of liponucleotides (essential precursors for de novo phospholipid synthesis) in alveolar type II epithelial cells. We found previously that early or late post-infection treatment of influenza A virus-infected mice with the liponucleotide CDP-choline decreased hypoxemia, pulmonary edema, lung dysfunction, and inflammation without altering viral replication. Because it is a truism that mice with ARDS are far easier to cure than people, we wished to show that parenteral liponucleotide administration could likewise attenuate ARDS in a more clinically-relevant real-world situation. METHODS. Client-owned pet dogs admitted to the Small Animal ICU at The Ohio State University Veterinary Medical Center for aspiration pneumonia were enrolled in a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial of treatment with vehicle (0.1 ml/kg sterile 0.9% saline, i.v.;n=8 dogs) or CDP-choline (5 mg/kg in 0.1 ml/kg 0.9% saline, i.v.;n=9 dogs) every 12 hours over the first 48 hours after admission. Dogs received standard of care supportive therapy and supplemental O2 (in an O2 tent or via nasal cannula) as deemed necessary by the attending clinician. Vital signs, blood pressure, and peripheral O2 saturations were recorded every 8 hours. Arterial blood gases were measured every 12 hours. Venous blood was collected on admission and at 48 hours for clinical chemistry and CBC/differential counts. Written consent was obtained from all owners, who received a $400 financial incentive (in the form of a contribution to hospital expenses) to participate. RESULTS. Dogs in the treatment arm were significantly younger, but there were no other significant differences between placebo- and CDP-choline-treated dogs on admission. All dogs exhibited tachycardia, tachypnea, hypertension, hypoxemia, hypocapnia, lymphopenia, and neutrophilia. Administration of CDP-choline resulted in rapid, progressive, and clinically significant increases in PaO2:FiO2 values and declines in alveolar-arterial (A-a) gradients that did not occur in placebo (saline)-treated animals. CDP-choline treatment also prevented platelet consumption over the first 48 hours after admission but had no detectable detrimental effects in sick dogs. CONCLUSIONS. CDP-choline acts rapidly to promote gas exchange in dogs with spontaneous aspiration pneumonia. Because CDP-choline has been shown to be very safe in human subjects, it should be considered as a potential adjunct therapy in ARDS and/or COVID-19 patients.","Davis, I. C.; Young, A. A.; Rosas, L.

Positive stool samples for Salmonella, Shigella and Campylobacter are reported on a monthly basis to the Israel Center for Disease Control from sentinel laboratories, within the framework of a surveillance network of bacterial culture-proven enteric diseases. Age-adjusted incidence rates per 100,000 of shigellosis, salmonellosis and campylobacteriosis were calculated. Mean rates before and after the local onset of COVID-19 pandemic in Israel were compared and Relative Risk Reduction (RRR) was calculated. Joinpoint was used to evaluate secular trends.

Using Joinpoint we have shown that the decrease observed for shigellosis was significantly sharper (Annual Percent Change (APC) = -77.7) between February 2020 and May 2020 than for salmonellosis (APC = -14.0) between July 2019 and April 2020 and for campylobacteriosis (APC = -1.1) between January 2018 and July 2020. The preventive measures applied to reduce transmission of COVID-19, including social distancing and hand washing, were ecologically associated with a decreased risk of bacterial enteric diseases in Israel. The association was strongest for shigellosis, a disease that is mostly person-to-person transmitted, as compared to salmonellosis and campylobacteriosis which are mostly foodborne transmitted.","Bassal, Ravit; Keinan-Boker, Lital; Cohen, Dani",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),563,15

Diagnostic testing remained one of the limiting factors for early identification and isolation of infected patients. This study aimed to evaluate posterior oropharyngeal saliva (POPS) for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) detection among patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19. METHODS: The laboratory information system was searched retrospectively for all respiratory specimens and POPS requested for SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection between Feb 1, 2020 and Apr 15, 2020. The agreement and diagnostic performance of POPS against NPsp were evaluated. RESULTS: A total of 13772 specimens were identified during the study period, including 2130 POPS and 8438 NPsp. Two hundred and twenty-nine same-day POPS-NPsp paired were identified with POPS and NPsp positivity of 61.5% (95% CI [55.1-67.6%]) and 53.3% (95% CI [46.8-59.6%]). The overall, negative and positive percent agreement were 76.0% (95% CI [70.2-80.9%]), 65.4% (95% CI [55.5-74.2%]), 85.2% (95% CI [77.4-90.8%]). Better positive percent agreement was observed in POPS-NPsp obtained within seven days (96.6%, 95% CI [87.3-99.4%]) compared with after seven days of symptom onset (75.0%, 95% CI [61.4-85.2%)). Among the 104 positive pairs, the mean difference in Cp value was 0.26 (range: 12.63 to -14.74), with an overall higher Cp value in NPsp (Pearson coefficient 0.579). No significant temporal variation was noted between the two specimen types.

Participants completed pre- and post-simulation questionnaires. RESULTS: Fifty-six staff participated and they reported being significantly less prepared to respond to an emergency in a patient with suspected COVID-19 than in one in whom it is not suspected. The simulations significantly improved the participants' confidence in responding to emergencies in patients with suspected COVID-19. Numerous challenges were identified along the themes of equipment, personnel, communication and procedures. CONCLUSIONS: Low-fidelity simulation can provide relevant and timely information on how prepared health systems and their workforce are to respond to emergencies.

Strategies are needed to identify and characterize animal viruses that pose the greatest risk of spillover and spread in humans and inform public health interventions. Using expert opinion and scientific evidence, we identified host, viral, and environmental risk factors contributing to zoonotic virus spillover and spread in humans. We then developed a risk ranking framework and interactive web tool, SpillOver, that estimates a risk score for wildlife-origin viruses, creating a comparative risk assessment of viruses with uncharacterized zoonotic spillover potential alongside those already known to be zoonotic. Using data from testing 509,721 samples from 74,635 animals as part of a virus discovery project and public records of virus detections around the world, we ranked the spillover potential of 887 wildlife viruses. Validating the risk assessment, the top 12 were known zoonotic viruses, including SARS-CoV-2. Several newly detected wildlife viruses ranked higher than known zoonotic viruses. Using a scientifically informed process, we capitalized on the recent wealth of virus discovery data to systematically identify and prioritize targets for investigation. The publicly accessible SpillOver platform can be used by policy makers and health scientists to inform research and public health interventions for prevention and rapid control of disease outbreaks. SpillOver is a living, interactive database that can be refined over time to continue to improve the quality and public availability of information on viral threats to human health.","Grange, Zoë L; Goldstein, Tracey; Johnson, Christine K; Anthony, Simon; Gilardi, Kirsten; Daszak, Peter; Olival, Kevin J; O039,; Rourke, Tammie; Murray, Suzan; Olson, Sarah H; Togami, Eri; Vidal, Gema; Mazet, Jonna A K",Proc.

Here we estimate the real-time delay-adjusted case fatality rate across nine age groups by gender in Chile, the country with the highest testing rate for COVID-19 in Latin America. METHODS: We used a publicly available real-time daily series of age-stratified COVID-19 cases and deaths reported by the Ministry of Health in Chile from the beginning of the epidemic in March through August 31, 2020. We used a robust likelihood function and a delay distribution to estimate real-time delay-adjusted case-fatality risk and estimate model parameters using a Monte Carlo Markov Chain in a Bayesian framework. RESULTS: As of August 31, 2020, our estimates of the time-delay adjusted case fatality rate (CFR) for men and women are 4.16% [95% Credible Interval (CrI): 4.09-4.24%] and 3.26% (95% CrI: 3.19-3.34%), respectively, while the overall estimate is 3.72% (95% CrI: 3.67-3.78%). Seniors aged 80 years and over have an adjusted CFR of 56.82% (95% CrI: 55.25-58.34%) for men and 41.10% (95% CrI: 40.02-42.26%) for women. Results showed a peak in estimated CFR during the June peak of the epidemic. The peak possibly reflects insufficient laboratory capacity, as illustrated by high test positivity rates (33% positive 7-day average nationally in June), which may have resulted in lower reporting rates. CONCLUSIONS: Severity estimates from COVID-19 in Chile suggest that male seniors, especially among those aged &#8805; 70 years, are being disproportionately affected by the pandemic, a finding consistent with other regions. The ongoing pandemic is imposing a high death toll in South America, and Chile has one of the highest reported mortality rates globally thus far. These real-time estimates may help inform public health officials' decisions in the region and underscore the need to implement more effective measures to ameliorate fatality.","Undurraga, Eduardo A; Chowell, Gerardo; Mizumoto, Kenji",Infect Dis Poverty,563,15

We aimed to evaluate a novel, one-step method, permitting simultaneous stent removal and guidewire passage using a self-constructed suture snare via standard cystoscopy. This method should be used prior to ureteroscopy, in cases of minimal stent encrustation and peri-ureteral mucosal oedema, where identification and subsequent cannulation of the ureteral orifice may be a challenge. METHODS: A self-constructed suture snare is constructed using an open-ended ureteral catheter to facilitate this novel 'Switch' technique. Operative duration, cost feasibility and potential complications with this novel method were assessed in patients with an indwelling stent duration above 100 days. RESULTS: Age inclusion in this study ranged from 21 to 35 years, with kidney, ureter and bladder scores below 6, in the five patients assessed. Previous ureteral stent indwelling time ranged from 106 to 315 days. Reasons for (pre-stented) ureteroscopy were mostly stone related. The overall recorded procedure time for the Switch technique was successfully performed in less than 96 s (range 68-95 s) in all cases within this series. No procedure-related complications were reported. CONCLUSION: Utilizing the suture snare, the novel Switch technique was successfully performed in all cases assessed. This method is both time and cost feasible and could be easily utilized in resource-limited areas, regional centres or in cases where a stent grasper is not available, may have malfunctioned or cannot adequately approximate due to distal ureteral stent encrustation.","Adam, Ahmed; Bhattu, Amit S; Lawrentschuk, Nathan",ANZ j.

We sought to develop guidance for procurement and use of CCP, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) for which data are lacking. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A multidisciplinary, geographically representative group of individuals with expertise spanning transfusion medicine, infectious diseases and haematology was tasked with the development of a guidance document for CCP, drawing on expert opinion, survey of group members and review of available evidence. Three subgroups (i.e. donor, product and patient) were established based on self-identified expertise and interest. Here, the donor and product-related challenges are summarized and contrasted between HICs and LMICs with a view to guide related practices. RESULTS: The challenges to advance CCP therapy are different between HICs and LMICs. Early challenges in HICs related to recruitment and qualification of sufficient donors to meet the growing demand. Antibody testing also posed a specific obstacle given lack of standardization, variable performance of the assays in use and uncertain interpretation of results. In LMICs, an extant transfusion deficit, suboptimal models of donor recruitment (e.g. reliance on replacement and paid donors), limited laboratory capacity for pre-donation qualification and operational considerations could impede wide adoption. CONCLUSION: There has been wide-scale adoption of CCP in many HICs, which could increase if clinical trials show efficacy of use. By contrast, LMICs, having received little attention, require locally applicable strategies for adoption of CCP.","Bloch, Evan M; Goel, Ruchika; Wendel, Silvano; Burnouf, Thierry; Al-Riyami, Arwa Z; Ang, Ai Leen; DeAngelis, Vincenzo; Dumont, Larry J; Land, Kevin; Lee, Cheuk-Kwong; Oreh, Adaeze; Patidar, Gopal; Spitalnik, Steven L; Vermeulen, Marion; Hindawi, Salwa; Van den Berg, Karin; Tiberghien, Pierre; Vrielink, Hans; Young, Pampee; Devine, Dana; So-Osman, Cynthia",Vox sang,563,1

Differences in adverse clinical outcomes following coronary artery bypass graft between these groups are poorly established. Therefore, a propensity matched comparison of short and longer term mortality and morbidity in insulin-controlled diabetes, tablet-controlled diabetes and non-diabetic patients was undertaken. METHODS: Isolated first-time coronary artery bypass graft surgeries between April 1999 and April 2017 were propensity score matched by pre- and intra-operative variables. RESULTS: 8241 patients; 23.5% diabetics and 76.5% non-diabetics. The groups' demographical and clinical characteristics were comparable after matching. Insulin-controlled diabetes patients had significantly higher in-hospital mortality (3.8% vs. 1.7%, p < 0.05), multisystem failure (2.6% vs. 1.8%, p < 0.05), sternal wound infections requiring debridement (3.6% vs. 1.3%, p < 0.05), respiratory complications (25.6% vs. 21.9%, p < 0.05), new dialysis (4.7% vs. 0.9%, p < 0.05) and longer hospital stays (13.5 ± 13.3 vs. 10.6 ± 8.0, p < 0.05) compared to non-diabetic patients.Tablet-controlled diabetes patients had significantly higher strokes (2.9% vs. 1.2, p < 0.05), superficial sternal wound infections (6.7% vs. 5.4%, p < 0.05), respiratory complications (25.7% vs. 22.7%, p < 0.05), new dialysis (1.7% vs. 0.6%, p < 0.05), post-operative atrial fibrillation (37.1% vs. 33.9%, p < 0.05) and readmission with myocardial infarction (22.4% vs. 19.6%, p < 0.05) compared to non-diabetic patients. CONCLUSION: Diabetic treatment sub-groups are an independent risk factor for sternal wound infection, new dialysis requirement, multisystem failure and readmission with myocardial infarction after isolated first coronary artery bypass graft surgery. The findings suggest the need for better risk stratification of diabetic groups prior to cardiac surgery and for improved cardiovascular risk management post-surgery in tablet-controlled diabetes patients.","Haqzad, Yama; Hobkirk, James; Ariyaratnam, Priyadharshanan; Chaudhry, Mubarak; Carroll, Sean; Loubani, And Mahmoud",Asian Cardiovasc Thorac Ann,563,13

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) removed age restrictions on levonorgestrel EC and made it available over-the-counter to everyone in 2013. Despite improved availability and accessibility since the change in FDA regulations, community pharmacies have not uniformly embraced the policy. West Virginia is a rural state with high rates of poverty and teen pregnancy. DESIGN: The investigators called community pharmacies in West Virginia to assess the availability and accessibility of levonorgestrel EC in addition to the pharmacy staff's knowledge of effectiveness for this cross-sectional study. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: The study sample consisted of 509 community pharmacies throughout the state. OUTCOME MEASURES: A structured script was employed to conduct phone calls to community pharmacies with items assessing availability, accessibility, and knowledge of effectiveness. RESULTS: At the time of the phone calls, levonorgestrel EC was reported to be available in 48.9% of the community pharmacies in West Virginia. Chain pharmacies were more likely to report EC as being in stock (0.76) than independent pharmacies (0.15.). Other measures of accessibility also favored chain pharmacies versus independent pharmacies. The overall accessibility of EC at West Virginia community pharmacies was derived from a binary composite variable of ""completely accessible"" or ""not completely accessible"" by combining 5 predetermined items. Overall, EC was completely accessible to callers in 0.27 of all pharmacies with significant differences by pharmacy type (0.47 of chain pharmacies as compared with 0.03 of independent pharmacies). CONCLUSION: Accessible EC could reduce unintended pregnancy and help break the state's generational cycle of poverty and poor educational, social, and health outcomes. Pharmacists will be instrumental in expanding access to EC.","Ashcraft, Amie M; Farjo, Sara; Ponte, Charles D; Dotson, Sarah; Sambamoorthi, Usha; Murray, Pamela J",,563,23

Interactions between IL-8 and its receptor CXC receptor 1/2 (CXCR1/2) are known to promote chemotaxis and phagocytosis in many immune responses. In this study, we report the molecular characteristics and pharmacological activity of CXCR1 (MsCXCR1) in largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) and evaluated the functional involvement of MsCXCR1 in individuals infected with the pathogen Nocardia seriolae. MsCXCR1 was cloned into the pEGFP-N1 plasmid and the subcellular localization of MsCXCR1 on the cell membrane was verified in MsCXCR1-EGFP-expressing HEK293 cells. Following observation of receptor internalization and intracellular signaling detection, we further determined the functional interaction of secreted interleukin-8 (LcIL-8, the ligand for CXCR1 in large yellow croaker) and MsCXCR1 was further determined, and the ERK phosphorylation signal activation mediated by MsCXCR1 was demonstrated. Quantitative real-time PCR assays were conducted to analyze the transcriptional distribution of MsCXCR1 in various tissues of healthy and diseased largemouth bass.

Data sources covering the last decade on overdose deaths, drug treatment entrants and drug-related emergencies suggest that the health burden associated with opioid use is mostly related to the consumption of heroin - and to a lesser extent diverted opioid substitution treatment medications - and that it is primarily affecting an ageing cohort of vulnerable users, with little evidence of an increase in initiation. While opioid-related deaths are currently at much lower levels than in the United States, they still represent a large preventable health burden with differences across EU countries. There is also increasing concern related to the high availability of heroin, illicitly produced synthetic opioids and diverted opioid pain medications on the European drugs market. Trends in the latter categories are poorly monitored and we may miss signs of emerging problems. Moreover, the economic recession following the COVID-19 pandemic has a potential to lead to resurgence in opioid use and harms.

Data sources covering the last decade on overdose deaths, drug treatment entrants and drug-related emergencies suggest that the health burden associated with opioid use is mostly related to the consumption of heroin - and to a lesser extent diverted opioid substitution treatment medications - and that it is primarily affecting an ageing cohort of vulnerable users, with little evidence of an increase in initiation. While opioid-related deaths are currently at much lower levels than in the United States, they still represent a large preventable health burden with differences across EU countries. There is also increasing concern related to the high availability of heroin, illicitly produced synthetic opioids and diverted opioid pain medications on the European drugs market. Trends in the latter categories are poorly monitored and we may miss signs of emerging problems. Moreover, the economic recession following the COVID-19 pandemic has a potential to lead to resurgence in opioid use and harms.

Acute myocardial injury is common in this population and is associated with higher rates of morbidity and mortality. The focus of this review centers on the recent applications of multimodality imaging in the diagnosis and management of COVID-19-related cardiovascular conditions. RECENT FINDINGS: In addition to standard cardiac imaging techniques such as transthoracic echocardiography, other modalities including computed tomography and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging have emerged as useful adjuncts in select patients with COVID-19 infection, particularly those with suspected ischemic and nonischemic myocardial injury. Data have also emerged suggesting lasting COVID-19 subclinical cardiac effects, which may have long-term prognostic implications. With the spectrum of COVID-19 cardiovascular manifestations observed thus far, it is important for clinicians to recognize the role, strengths, and limitations of multimodality imaging techniques in this patient population.","Goerlich, Erin; Minhas, Anum S; Mukherjee, Monica; Sheikh, Farooq H; Gilotra, Nisha A; Sharma, Garima; Michos, Erin D; Hays, Allison G",Curr Cardiol Rep,563,16

Nevertheless, massive utilization of PPE encounters significant challenges in recycling and sterilizing the used masks. To tackle the associated plastic pollution of used masks, in this work, we designed a reusable, biodegradable, and antibacterial mask. The mask was fabricated by the electrospinning of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO), and cellulose nanofiber (CNF), followed by esterification and the deposition of a nitrogen-doped TiO2 (N-TiO2) and TiO2 mixture. The fabricated mask containing photocatalytic N-TiO2/TiO2 reached 100% bacteria disinfection under either 0.1 sun simulation (200-2500 nm, 106 W m-2) or natural sunlight for only 10 min. Thus, the used mask can be rejuvenated through light irradiation and reused, which represents one of the handiest technologies for handling used masks. Furthermore, intermolecular interactions between PVA, PEO, and CNF enhanced the electrospinnability and mechanical performance of the resultant mask, which possesses a 10-fold elastic modulus and 2-fold tensile strength higher than a commercial single-use mask. The porous structures of electrospun nanofibers along with strong electrostatic attraction enabled breathability (83.4 L min-1 of air flow rate) and superior particle filterability (98.7%). The prepared mask also had excellent cycling performance, wearability, and stable filtration efficiency even after 120 min wearing. Therefore, this mask could be a great alternative to current masks to address the urgent need for a sustainable, reusable, environmentally friendly, and efficient PPE under the ongoing COVID-19 contagion.","Li, Qiang; Yin, Yongchao; Cao, Daxian; Wang, Ying; Luan, Pengcheng; Sun, Xiao; Liang, Wentao; Zhu, Hongli",ACS nano,563,33

Herein we report a case of reinfection where the patient was tested positive again after being tested negative two subsequent times. Case DescriptionA 31-year-old Hispanic female with a past medical history of asthma, gastric sleeve surgery, and pulmonary embolism during pregnancy presented in March 2020 with subjective fever, dry cough, headache, and fatigue for 5 days. Vitals were significant for oxygen saturation of 96% on room air and BMI 44.4 kg/m2. Physical examination was normal. Labs and chest radiograph were normal. SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR was positive. The patient was discharged and was advised to quarantine herself and monitor her oxygen saturation. She was re-tested again in July 2020 and September 2020 and SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR was negative both times. The patient came to the hospital again in November 2020 with subjective fevers, chills, shortness of breath, body ache, and malaise for 1 week. Vitals were significant for a heart rate of 112/min, temperature 99.6 °F, respiratory rate of 20/min, hypoxia requiring 5L nasal cannula to maintain an oxygen saturation of 95%, and BMI 44.7 kg/m2. Physical exam revealed decreased air entry in the lungs bilaterally. Complete blood count and basic metabolic profile were within normal limits. Inflammatory markers were elevated. Computed tomography (CT) thorax showed bilateral, predominantly peripheral, and subpleural ill-defined ground-glass opacities consistent with pneumonia. SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR was positive. The patient was treated with intravenous remdesivir for 5 days and oral dexamethasone 6mg for 10 days. She improved clinically and was discharged on home oxygen. DiscussionAlthough the risk of COVID reinfection is low, cases of possible reinfection have been reported. Our patient was not immunocompromised, tested negative after 4 months and 6 months but presented again after 8 months with severe symptoms as compared to the first time. There have been case reports where the reinfection was more severe, however, there is not sufficient data to support that. There is not enough data demonstrating degree and duration of protection after the primary infection either. Reinfection could be due to infection with a more virulent strain or evolution of the previous viral strain in the body. The absence of genomic sequencing limits our ability to diagnose that. More research in this field and genomic sequencing can help us with an accurate diagnosis.","Chandna, S.; Shah, M. V.; Aftab, G.; Agrawal, A.; Frenia, D.

We sequenced SARS-CoV-2 genomes for patients and healthcare workers (HCWs) across multiple geographically distinct UK hospitals, obtaining 173 high-quality SARS-CoV-2 genomes. We integrated patient movement and staff location data into the analysis of viral genome data to understand spatial and temporal dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. We identified eight patient contact clusters (PCC) with significantly increased similarity in genomic variants compared to non-clustered samples. Incorporation of HCW location further increased the number of individuals within PCCs and identified additional links in SARS-CoV-2 transmission pathways. Patients within PCCs carried viruses more genetically identical to HCWs in the same ward location. SARS-CoV-2 genome sequencing integrated with patient and HCW movement data increases identification of outbreak clusters. This dynamic approach can support infection control management strategies within the healthcare setting.","Ellingford, Jamie M; George, Ryan; McDermott, John H; Ahmad, Shazaad; Edgerley, Jonathan J; Gokhale, David; Newman, William G; Ball, Stephen; Machin, Nicholas; Black, Graeme Cm",eLife (Cambridge),563,24

Such simulations need to support continuous updating in response to rapid advances in understanding of infection mechanisms, and parallel development of components by multiple groups. We present an open-source platform for multiscale spatiotemporal simulation of an epithelial tissue, viral infection, cellular immune response and tissue damage, specifically designed to be modular and extensible to support continuous updating and parallel development. The base simulation of a simplified patch of epithelial tissue and immune response exhibits distinct patterns of infection dynamics from widespread infection, to recurrence, to clearance. Slower viral internalization and faster immune-cell recruitment slow infection and promote containment. Because antiviral drugs can have side effects and show reduced clinical effectiveness when given later during infection, we studied the effects on progression of treatment potency and time-of-first treatment after infection. In simulations, even a low potency therapy with a drug which reduces the replication rate of viral RNA greatly decreases the total tissue damage and virus burden when given near the beginning of infection. Many combinations of dosage and treatment time lead to stochastic outcomes, with some simulation replicas showing clearance or control (treatment success), while others show rapid infection of all epithelial cells (treatment failure). Thus, while a high potency therapy usually is less effective when given later, treatments at late times are occasionally effective. We illustrate how to extend the platform to model specific virus types (e.g., hepatitis C) and add additional cellular mechanisms (tissue recovery and variable cell susceptibility to infection), using our software modules and publicly-available software repository.","Sego, T J; Aponte-Serrano, Josua O; Ferrari Gianlupi, Juliano; Heaps, Samuel R; Breithaupt, Kira; Brusch, Lutz; Crawshaw, Jessica; Osborne, James M; Quardokus, Ellen M; Plemper, Richard K; Glazier, James A",PLoS Comput Biol,563,1

AREAS COVERED: Herein, we discuss the available evidence on the efficacy and safety of antiviral agents employed over the past months for the treatment of COVID-19, and the reasons to be considered for antiviral selection. EXPERT OPINION: The available evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCT) currently discourages the use of lopinavir/ritonavir, hydroxychloroquine, and interferons, which did not show improved efficacy compared to standard care or placebo. Regarding remdesivir, the current body of evidence may conditionally support its use in COVID-19 patients requiring oxygen supplementation but still not requiring invasive mechanical ventilation. Finally, neutralizing monoclonal antibodies have been proven efficacious in reducing the risk of severe disease development if administered early in the course of the disease to patients at risk of progression. The results of the ongoing RCT will certainly be crucial to further improve our understanding of the optimal place in therapy of antiviral agents for COVID-19.","Bassetti, Matteo; Corcione, Silvia; Dettori, Silvia; Lombardi, Andrea; Lupia, Tommaso; Vena, Antonio; De Rosa, Francesco Giuseppe; Gori, Andrea; Giacobbe, Daniele Roberto",Expert Rev Respir Med,563,6

The purpose of this report was to present a case of ethanol-induced hand sanitizer intoxication after spine surgery in a patient with a postoperative delirious state. Presentation of case: A 63-year-old man was admitted to the spine department with intractable back pain as the main symptom and diagnosed with infectious spondylitis with discitis. The patient suddenly showed mental changes, resulting in a semi-comatose mental state the first day after surgery, without seizure-like activity and asphyxia. We subsequently discovered the patient had consumed half of an ethanol hand sanitizer bottle (about 300-400 ml) which was placed at the foot of the bed to prevent infection transmission during the COVID-19 pandemic. The patient did not tend to depend on alcohol or psychiatric medication in the past, and had no addiction. After seven months, the patient had complete bone union and independent ambulation. Discussion: Acute ethanol intoxication can result in life-threatening clinical effects. One of the major problems after orthopedic surgery is delirium, with the largest number appearing after spine surgery. Conclusion: Hand sanitizer, mainly composed of ethanol, did not cause abnormal findings or interfere with the course of treatment of infectious spondylitis. However, it is expected that such accidents will increase, due to the increase in the use of hand sanitizers caused by COVID-19. It is, therefore, necessary to avoid potential patient abuse, especially after spinal surgery in patients at risk of delirium.","Lim, Dong-Ju",,563,10

The aim of this commentary is to analyse the dangerous role of fake news and misinformation while the world is in thrall to COVID-19.

The use of fake products and medicines results in a major risk to the health and safety of patients and need to be taken seriously. Political polarisation and online misinformation are also threatening vaccination programmes worldwide, with public trust best described as fickle, volatile and varying widely between countries.

However, the impact of the pandemic on telemedicine use at a population level in rural and remote settings remains unclear. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate changes in the rate of telemedicine use among rural populations and identify patient characteristics associated with telemedicine use prior to and during the pandemic. METHODS: We conducted a repeated cross-sectional study on all monthly and quarterly rural telemedicine visits from January 2012 to June 2020, using administrative data from Ontario, Canada. We compared the changes in telemedicine use among residents of rural and urban regions of Ontario prior to and during the pandemic. RESULTS: Before the pandemic, telemedicine use was steadily low in 2012-2019 for both rural and urban populations but slightly higher overall for rural patients (11 visits per 1000 patients vs 7 visits per 1000 patients in December 2019, P<.001). The rate of telemedicine visits among rural patients significantly increased to 147 visits per 1000 patients in June 2020.

Telemedicine use increased across all age groups, with the highest rates reported among older adults aged &#8805;65 years (77 visits per 100 patients in 2020). The proportions of patients with at least 1 telemedicine visit were similar across the adult age groups (n=82,246/290,401, 28.3% for patients aged 18-49 years, n=79,339/290,401, 27.3% for patients aged 50-64 years, and n=80,833/290,401, 27.8% for patients aged 65-79 years), but lower among younger patients <18 years (n=23,699/290,401, 8.2%) and older patients &#8805;80 years (n=24,284/290,401, 8.4%) in 2020 (P<.001). There were more female users than male users of telemedicine (n=158,643/290,401, 54.6% vs n=131,758/290,401, 45.4%, respectively, in 2020; P<.001). There was a significantly higher proportion of telemedicine users residing in relatively less rural than in more rural regions (n=261,814/290,401, 90.2% vs n=28,587/290,401, 9.8%, respectively, in 2020; P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: Telemedicine adoption increased in rural and remote areas during the COVID-19 pandemic, but its use increased in urban and less rural populations. Future studies should investigate the potential barriers to telemedicine use among rural patients and the impact of rural telemedicine on patient health care utilization and outcomes.","Chu, Cherry; Cram, Peter; Pang, Andrea; Stamenova, Vess; Tadrous, Mina; Bhatia, R Sacha",J Med Internet Res,563,1

METHODS: A cross-sectional study design with nonrandom sampling was used. The sample consisted of a total of 1148 pregnant women in various trimesters. They were recruited via social media and completed an online study questionnaire in April-May 2020. RESULTS: The results of the present research indicate satisfactory psychometric properties of the Polish version of the PREPS. Our findings confirm the factor structure found by the authors of the original English version of the PREPS. The scale consists of two stress subscales: perinatal infection stress and preparedness stress and one additional positive appraisal scale. Pandemic-related pregnancy stress is significantly associated with fear of childbirth and with non-pandemic pregnancy-specific stress, which bolsters its convergent validity. Higher levels of pandemic-related pregnancy stress are experienced by primiparas, those in their second or third trimester, women who received infertility treatment, and those with a high-risk pregnancy. CONCLUSIONS: The Polish version of the PREPS has sound psychometric properties and replicates the structure of the original English PREPS. This stress scale can be used to investigate additional impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and to identify women at risk of high stress and those who need intervention.","Ilska, Michalina; Kolodziej-Zaleska, Anna; Brandt-Salmeri, Anna; Preis, Heidi; Lobel, Marci",Midwifery,563,16

We extended a previous successful model to describe the geographical spread of the AH1N1 influenza epidemic of 2009 in two essential ways: we added a stochastic local mobility mechanism, and we introduced a new compartment in order to take into account the isolation of infected asymptomatic detected people. Two fundamental parameters drive the dynamics: the time elapsed between contagious and isolation of infected individuals ([Formula: see text]) and the ratio of people isolated over the total infected ones (p). The evolution is more sensitive to the [Formula: see text]parameter. The model not only reproduces the real data but also predicts the second wave before the former vanishes.

We hypothesize that chest compression and defibrillation generate aerosols that could contain the SARS-CoV-2 virus in a swine CA model. METHODS: To simulate witnessed CA with bystander-initiated cardiopulmonary resuscitation, 3 female non-intubated swine underwent 4â¯min of ventricular fibrillation without chest compression or defibrillation (no-flow) followed by ten 2-min cycles of mechanical chest compression and defibrillation without ventilation. The diameter (0.3-10â¯µm) and quantity of aerosols generated during 45-s intervals of no-flow and chest compression before and after defibrillation were analyzed by a particle analyzer. Aerosols generated from the coughs of 4 healthy human subjects were also compared to aerosols generated by swine. RESULTS: There was no significant difference between the total aerosols generated during chest compression before defibrillation compared to no-flow. In contrast, chest compression after defibrillation generated significantly more aerosols than chest compression before defibrillation or no-flow (72.4â¯±â¯41.6â¯×â¯104 vs 12.3â¯±â¯8.3â¯×â¯104 vs 10.5â¯±â¯11.2â¯×â¯104; pâ¯<â¯0.05), with a shift in particle size toward larger aerosols. Two consecutive human coughs generated 54.7â¯±â¯33.9â¯×â¯104 aerosols with a size distribution smaller than post-defibrillation chest compression. CONCLUSIONS: Chest compressions alone did not cause significant aerosol generation in this swine model. However, increased aerosol generation was detected during chest compression immediately following defibrillation. Additional research is needed to elucidate the clinical significance and mechanisms by which aerosol generation during chest compression is modified by defibrillation.","Hsu, Cindy H; Tiba, Mohamad H; Boehman, André L; McCracken, Brendan M; Leander, Danielle C; Francalancia, Stephanie C; Pickell, Zachary; Sanderson, Thomas H; Ward, Kevin R; Neumar, Robert W",Resuscitation,563,1

DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: We conducted a population-based mobile phone survey between 1 February and 10 February 2020 via random digit dialling. A total of 1011 adult residents in Wuhan (n=510), the epicentre and quarantined city, and Shanghai (n=501) were interviewed. Proportional quota sampling and poststratification weighting were used. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to investigate perception factors associated with the public responses. PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES: We measured anxiety levels using the 7-item Generalised Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7) and asked respondents to report their precautionary behaviours before and during the outbreak. RESULTS: The prevalence of moderate or severe anxiety was significantly higher (p<0.001) in Wuhan (32.8%) than Shanghai (20.5%). Around 79.6%-88.2% residents reported always wearing a face mask when they went out and washing hands immediately when they returned home, with no discernible difference across cities. Only 35.5%-37.0% of residents reported a handwashing duration above 40 s as recommended by the WHO. The strongest predictor of moderate or severe anxiety was perceived harm of the disease (OR 1.8, 95% CI 1.5 to 2.1), followed by confusion about information reliability (OR 1.7, 95% CI 1.5 to 1.9). None of the examined perception factors were associated with odds of handwashing duration above 40 s. CONCLUSIONS: Prevalence of moderate or severe anxiety and strict personal precautionary behaviours was generally high, regardless of the quarantine status. Our results support efforts for handwashing education programmes with a focus on hygiene procedures in China and timely dissemination of reliable information.","Qian, Mengcen; Wu, Qianhui; Wu, Peng; Hou, Zhiyuan; Liang, Yuxia; Cowling, Benjamin J; Yu, Hongjie",BMJ Open,563,15

METHODS: Between mid-June to mid-July 2020, educational institutions from 12 countries were invited to participate in an online survey designed to gain student radiographer opinion from a wide geographical spread and countries with varying levels of COVID-19 cases. RESULTS: 1277 respondents participated, of these 592 had completed clinical placements during January to June 2020. Accommodation and cohabiting risks were identified as challenging, as was isolation from family, travel to clinical placements, and to a lesser extent childcare. Students stated they had been affected by the feeling of isolation and concerns about the virus whilst on placement. Overall 35.4% of all respondents were 'Not at all worried' about being a radiographer, however, 64.6% expressed varying levels of concern and individual domestic or health situations significantly impacted responses (p &#8804; 0.05). Year 4 students and recent graduates were significantly more likely to be 'Not worried at all' compared to Year 2 and 3 students (p &#8804; 0.05). The need for improved communication regarding clinical placements scheduling was identified as almost 50% of students on clinical placements between January to June 2020 identified the completion of assessments as challenging. Furthermore, only 66% of respondents with COVID-19 imaging experience stated being confident with personal protective equipment (PPE) use. CONCLUSION: Student radiographers identified key challenges which require consideration to ensure appropriate measures are in place to support their ongoing needs. Importantly PPE training is required before placement regardless of prior COVID-19 imaging experience. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: As the next academic year commences, the study findings identify important matters to be considered by education institutions with responsibility for Radiography training and as students commence clinical placements during the on-going global COVID-19 pandemic.","Rainford, L A; Zanardo, M; Buissink, C; Decoster, R; Hennessy, W; Knapp, K; Kraus, B; Lanca, L; Lewis, S; Mahlaola, T B; McEntee, M; O039,; Leary, D; Precht, H; Starc, T; McNulty, J P",,563,16

By adopting the steps and other components of organizational learning, healthcare institutions can convert themselves into learning organizations and ultimately strengthen the overall healthcare system of the country. The present study aimed to examine the influence of several organizational learning dimensions on organization culture in healthcare settings during the COVID-19 outbreak. METHODS: During COVID-19 crisis in 2020, an online cross-sectional study was performed. Data were collected via official emails sent to 1500 healthcare professionals working in front line at four sets of hospitals in Saudi Arabia. Basic descriptive analysis was constructed to identify the variation between the four healthcare organizations. A multiple regression was employed to explore how hospitals can adopt learning process during pandemics, incorporating several Dimensions of Learning Organizations Questionnaire (DLOQ) developed by Marsick and Watkins (2003) and Leufvén and others (2015). RESULTS: Organizational learning including system connections (M = 3.745), embedded systems (M = 3.732), and team work and collaborations (M = 3.724) tended to have major significant relationships with building effective learning organization culture. Staff empowerment, dialogues and inquiry, internal learning culture, and continuous learning had the lowest effect on building health organization culture (M = 3.680, M = 3.3.679, M = 3.673, M = 3.663, respectively). A multiple linear regression was run to predict learning organization based on the several variables. These variables statistically significantly predicted learning organization, F (6, 1124) = 168.730, p < .0005, R2 = 0.471, (p < .05). DISCUSSION: The findings concluded that although intrinsic factors like staff empowerment, dialogues and inquiry, and internal learning culture, revealed central roles, still the most crucial factors toward the development of learning organization culture were extrinsic ones including connections, embed system and collaborations. CONCLUSIONS: Until knowledge-sharing is embedded in health organizational systems; organizations may not maintain a high level of learning during crisis.","Alonazi, Wadi B",BMC Health Serv Res,563,6

AIMS: To assess the prevalence of APE in patients hospitalized for non-critical COVID-19 who presented clinical deterioration, and to investigate the association of clinical and biochemical variables with a confirmed diagnosis of APE in these subjects. METHODS: All consecutive patients admitted to the internal medicine department of a general hospital with a diagnosis of non-critical COVID-19, who performed a Computer Tomography Pulmonary Angiography (CTPA) for respiratory deterioration in April 2020, were included in this retrospective cohort study. RESULTS: Study populations: 41 subjects, median(IRQ)age:71.7(63-76)years, CPTA confirmed APE=8(19.51%,CI95%:8.82%-34.87%). Among patients with and without APE, no significant differences were found with regards symptoms, comorbidities, treatment, Wells score and outcomes. The optimal cut-off value of D-dimer for predicting APE was 2454 ng/mL, sensitivity(CI95%):63(24-91), specificity:73(54-87), Positive Predictive Value:36(13-65), Negative Predictive Value: 89(71-98) and AUC:0.62(0.38-0.85). The standard and age-adjusted D-dimer cut-offs, and the Wells score >2 did not associate with confirmed APE, albeit a cut-off value of D-dimer=2454 ng/mL showed an RR:3.21;CI95%:0.92-13.97;p=0.073. Heparin at anticoagulant doses was used in 70.73% of patients before performing CTPA. CONCLUSION: Among patients presenting pulmonary deterioration after hospitalization for non-critical COVID-19, the prevalence of APE is high. Traditional diagnostic tools to identify high APE pre-test probability patients do not seem to be clinically useful. These results support the use of a high index of suspicion for performing CTPA to exclude or confirm APE as the most appropriate diagnostic approach in this clinical setting.

The ease of its dispersion, coupled with its tremendous capability for ailment and death in infected people, makes it a risk to society. The chest X-ray is conventional but hard to interpret radiographic test for initial diagnosis of coronavirus from other related infections. It bears a considerable amount of information on physiological and anatomical features. To extract relevant information from it can occasionally become challenging even for a professional radiologist. In this regard, deep-learning models can help in swift, accurate and reliable outcomes. Existing datasets are small and suffer from the balance issue. In this paper, we prepare a relatively larger and well-balanced dataset as compared to the available datasets. Furthermore, we analyze deep learning models, namely, AlexNet, SqueezeNet, DenseNet201, MobileNetV2 and InceptionV3 with numerous variations such as training the models from scratch, fine-tuning without pre-trained weights, fine-tuning along with updating pre-trained weights of all layers, and fine-tuning with pre-trained weights along with applying augmentation. Our results show that fine-tuning with augmentation generates best results in pre-trained models. Finally, we have made architectural adjustments in MobileNetV2 and InceptionV3 models to learn more intricate features, which are then merged in our proposed ensemble model. The performance of our model is statistically analyzed against other models using four different performance metrics with paired two-sided t-test on 5 different splits of training and test sets of our dataset. We find that it is statistically better than its competing methods for the four metrics. Thus, the computer-aided classification based on the proposed model can assist radiologists in identifying coronavirus from other related infections in chest X-rays with higher accuracy. This can help in a reliable and speedy diagnosis, thereby saving valuable lives and mitigating the adverse impact on the socioeconomics of our community.","Ahmad, Fareed; Ghani Khan, Muhammad Usman; Javed, Kashif",Comput Biol Med,563,3

However, different manufacturing methods have produced several HAW products with various pH values. Here, we compared the SARS-CoV-2-inactivating activities of various HAW products. At sufficiently high volume and residual chlorine concentration (RCC), the HAW products inactivated SARS-CoV-2 efficiently regardless of pH or manufacturing method. However, although HAW products at pH 5.0-6.4 maintained high RCC and sustained virucidal activity for 21 days, the RCC rapidly decreased in HAW products at pH &#8804; 3.0.

Precise estimates of adverse outcomes from COVID-19 could have led to better allocation of healthcare resources and more efficient targeted preventive measures, including insight into prioritizing how to best distribute a vaccination. We developed MLHO (pronounced as melo), an end-to-end Machine Learning framework that leverages iterative feature and algorithm selection to predict Health Outcomes. MLHO implements iterative sequential representation mining, and feature and model selection, for predicting patient-level risk of hospitalization, ICU admission, need for mechanical ventilation, and death. It bases this prediction on data from patients' past medical records (before their COVID-19 infection). MLHO's architecture enables a parallel and outcome-oriented model calibration, in which different statistical learning algorithms and vectors of features are simultaneously tested to improve prediction of health outcomes. Using clinical and demographic data from a large cohort of over 13,000 COVID-19-positive patients, we modeled the four adverse outcomes utilizing about 600 features representing patients' pre-COVID health records and demographics. The mean AUC ROC for mortality prediction was 0.91, while the prediction performance ranged between 0.80 and 0.81 for the ICU, hospitalization, and ventilation. We broadly describe the clusters of features that were utilized in modeling and their relative influence for predicting each outcome. Our results demonstrated that while demographic variables (namely age) are important predictors of adverse outcomes after a COVID-19 infection, the incorporation of the past clinical records are vital for a reliable prediction model. As the COVID-19 pandemic unfolds around the world, adaptable and interpretable machine learning frameworks (like MLHO) are crucial to improve our readiness for confronting the potential future waves of COVID-19, as well as other novel infectious diseases that may emerge.","Estiri, Hossein; Strasser, Zachary H; Murphy, Shawn N",Sci Rep,563,20

Besides the respiratory involvement, COVID 19 patients frequently develop a pro-coagulative state caused by virus-induced endothelial dysfunction, cytokine storm and complement cascade hyperactivation. It is common to observe diffuse microvascular thrombi in multiple organs, mostly in pulmonary microvessels. Thrombotic risk seems to be directly related to disease severity and worsens patients' prognosis. Therefore, the correct understanding of the mechanisms underlying COVID-19 induced prothrombotic state can lead to a thorough assessment of the possible management strategies. Hence, we review the pathogenesis and therapy of COVID 19-related thrombosis disease, focusing on the available evidence on the possible treatment strategies and proposing an algorithm for the anticoagulation strategy based on disease severity.","Carfora, Vincenzo; Spiniello, Giorgio; Ricciolino, Riccardo; Di Mauro, Marco; Migliaccio, Marco Giuseppe; Mottola, Filiberto Fausto; Verde, Nicoletta; Coppola, Nicola",J. thromb. thrombolysis,563,18

METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, from March 7 to March 11, 2020, all heads of ED departments in France were contacted to answer an electronic survey, including 23 questions. Quality, Organization, Training, Resources, Management, Interoperability, and Responsiveness were evaluated by calculating scores (10 points). Multivariate analysis of variance was used to compare scores. Spearman's correlation coefficient and multifaceted regression analysis were performed between Responsiveness and dimensions scores. RESULTS: A total of 287 of 636 French EDs were included (45.1%). Calculated scores showed (median): Quality 5.38; Organization 6.4; Training 4.6; Resources 4.13; Management 2.38; Interoperability 4.0; Responsiveness 6.25; seasonal influenza score was 5. Significant differences between scores as a function of hospital and ED main characteristics were found.

To address this gap, the Italian Society of Internal Medicine has conducted a nationwide cohort multicentre study on death outcome in adult COVID-19 patients admitted and managed in IMU. This study assessed 3044 COVID-19 patients at 41 referral hospitals across Italy from February 3rd to May 8th 2020. Demographics, comorbidities, organ dysfunction, treatment, and outcomes including death were assessed. During the study period, 697 patients (22.9%) were transferred to intensive care units, and 351 died in IMU (death rate 14.9%). At admission, factors independently associated with in-hospital mortality were age (OR 2.46, p = 0.000), productive cough (OR 2.04, p = 0.000), pre-existing chronic heart failure (OR 1.58, p = 0.017) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (OR 1.17, p = 0.048), the number of comorbidities (OR 1.34, p = 0.000) and polypharmacy (OR 1.20, p = 0.000). Of note, up to 40% of elderly patients did not report fever at admission. Decreasing PaO2/FiO2 ratio at admission was strongly inversely associated with survival. The use of conventional oxygen supplementation increased with the number of pre-existing comorbidities, but it did not associate with better survival in patients with PaO2/FiO2 ratio < 100.

Hence, in order to prevent ARDS, the pulmonary function maintenance has been the target of several pharmacological approaches. However, there is a lack of reports regarding the use of effective pharmaceutical active natural products (PANPs) for early treatment and prevention of COVID-19-related ARDS. Therefore, the aim of this work was to conduct a systematic review regarding the PANPs that could be further studied as alternatives to prevent ARDS. Consequently, this work can pave the way to spread the use of PANPs on the prevention of ARDS in COVID-19-confirmed or -suspected patients. METHODS: The search strategy included scientific studies published in English from 2015 to 2020 that promoted the elucidation of anti-inflammatory pathways targeting ARDS by in vitro and/or in vivo experiments using PANPs. Then, 74 studies regarding PANPs, able to maintain or improve the pulmonary function, were reported. CONCLUSIONS: The PANPs may present different pulmonary anti-inflammatory pathways, wherein (i) reduction/attenuation of pro-inflammatory cytokines, (ii) increase of the anti-inflammatory mediators' levels, (iii) pulmonary edema inhibition and (iv) attenuation of lung injury were the most observed biological effects of such products in in vitro experiments or in clinical studies. Finally, this work highlighted the PANPs with promising potential to be used on respiratory syndromes, allowing their possible use as alternative treatment at the prevention of ARDS in COVID-19-infected or -suspected patients.","Amaral-Machado, Lucas; Oliveira, Wógenes N; Rodrigues, Victor M; Albuquerque, Nathan A; Alencar, Éverton N; Egito, Eryvaldo S T",Biomed Pharmacother,563,20

We aimed to evaluate the effect of combining chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine (CQ/HCQ) and zinc in the treatment of COVID-19 patients. This was a randomized clinical trial conducted at three major University hospitals in Egypt. One hundred ninety-one patients with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 infection were randomized into two groups: group I (96) patients received both HCQ and zinc, and group II (95) received HCQ only. The primary endpoints were the recovery within 28 days, the need for mechanical ventilation, and death. The two groups were matched for age and gender. They had no significant difference regarding any of the baseline laboratory parameters or clinical severity grading. Clinical recovery after 28 days was achieved by 79.2% in the zinc group and 77.9% in zinc-free treatment group, without any significant difference (p = 0.969). The need for mechanical ventilation and the overall mortality rates did not show any significant difference between the 2 groups either (p = 0.537 and 0.986, respectively). The age of the patient and the need for mechanical ventilation were the only risk factors associated with the patients' mortality by the univariate regression analysis (p = 0.001 and < 0.001, respectively).

They simulate potential scenarios by manipulating model parameters that control processes of disease transmission and recovery. However, the validity of these parameters is challenged by the uncertainty of the impact of public health interventions on disease transmission, and the forecasting accuracy of these models is rarely investigated during an outbreak. We fitted a stochastic transmission model on reported cases, recoveries and deaths associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection across 101 countries. The dynamics of disease transmission was represented in terms of the daily effective reproduction number ([Formula: see text]). The relationship between public health interventions and [Formula: see text] was explored, firstly using a hierarchical clustering algorithm on initial [Formula: see text] patterns, and secondly computing the time-lagged cross correlation among the daily number of policies implemented, [Formula: see text], and daily incidence counts in subsequent months. The impact of updating [Formula: see text] every time a prediction is made on the forecasting accuracy of the model was investigated. We identified 5 groups of countries with distinct transmission patterns during the first 6 months of the pandemic. Early adoption of social distancing measures and a shorter gap between interventions were associated with a reduction on the duration of outbreaks. The lagged correlation analysis revealed that increased policy volume was associated with lower future [Formula: see text] (75 days lag), while a lower [Formula: see text] was associated with lower future policy volume (102 days lag). Lastly, the outbreak prediction accuracy of the model using dynamically updated [Formula: see text] produced an average AUROC of 0.72 (0.708, 0.723) compared to 0.56 (0.555, 0.568) when [Formula: see text] was kept constant. Monitoring the evolution of [Formula: see text] during an epidemic is an important complementary piece of information to reported daily counts, recoveries and deaths, since it provides an early signal of the efficacy of containment measures. Using updated [Formula: see text] values produces significantly better predictions of future outbreaks. Our results found variation in the effect of early public health interventions on the evolution of [Formula: see text] over time and across countries, which could not be explained solely by the timing and number of the adopted interventions.","Zhu, Jie; Gallego, Blanca",Sci Rep,563,16

Pregnant women are particularly affected by this disease. OBJECTIVE: The aims of this study are to assess the levels of perceived threat (susceptibility, severity, impact), negative emotions (fear, worry), and self-efficacy of pregnant women in China related to COVID-19 and to examine their associations with mental health (depression and anxiety) and personal protective behavior (wearing a face mask). METHODS: A total of 4087 pregnant women from China completed a cross-sectional web-based survey between March 3 and 10, 2020. RESULTS: The prevalence of probable depression and anxiety was 48.7% (1989/4087) and 33.0% (1347/4087), respectively; 23.8% participants (974/4087) reported always wearing a face mask when going out. Of the 4087 participants, 32.1% (1313) and 36.4% (1490) perceived themselves or their family members to be susceptible to COVID-19 infection, respectively; 3216-3518 (78.7%-86.1%) agreed the disease would have various severe consequences. Additionally, 2275 of the 4087 participants (55.7%) showed self-efficacy in protecting themselves from contracting COVID-19, and 2232 (54.6%) showed efficacy in protecting their family members; 1303 (31.9%) reported a high level of fear of the disease, and 2780-3056 (68.0%-74.8%) expressed worry about various aspects of COVID-19. The results of the multivariate multinominal logistic regression analyses showed that perceived severity, perceived impact, fear, and worry were risk factors for probable depression and anxiety, while self-efficacy was a protective factor. The results of the multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that perceived susceptibility was associated with always wearing a face mask. CONCLUSIONS: Chinese pregnant women showed high levels of mental distress but low levels of personal protective behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic. Interventions are needed to promote the mental health and health behavior of pregnant women during the pandemic.","Mo, Phoenix Kit Han; Fong, Vivian Wai In; Song, Bo; Di, Jiangli; Wang, Qian; Wang, Linhong",J Med Internet Res,563,5

Three of the essays are clearly ""journalistic"" as a literary genre: one by a hospital chaplain, one by a medical student in her pre-clinical years, and one by a fourth-year medical student who reports her experience as she completed her undergraduate clerkships and applied for positions in graduate medical education. Other essays explore the pandemic from historical, sociological, and economic perspectives, particularly how triage policies have been found to be largely blind to structural healthcare disparities, while simultaneously unable to appropriately address those disparities. Central issues that need to be addressed in triage are not just whether a utilitarian response is the most just response, but what exactly is the greatest good for the greatest number? Together, the essays in this special issue of HEC Forum create a call for a more anthropological approach to understanding health and healthcare. The narrow approach of viewing health as resulting primarily from healthcare will continue to hinder advances and perpetuate disparities. Health outcomes result from a complex interaction of various social, economic, cultural, historical, and political factors. Advancing healthcare requires contextualizing the health of populations amongst these factors. The COVID-19 pandemic has made us keenly aware of how interdependent our health as a society can be.","Childs, Brian H; Vearrier, Laura",HEC Forum,563,24

Compared with adults, children with SARS-CoV-2 infection may have fewer and less severe symptoms. Gastrointestinal symptoms are commonly reported in children, sometimes as the only manifestation of the disease, and most often manifest as anorexia, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting, or abdominal pain. Although most children have asymptomatic or mild disease, 10 % of those infected may experience serious or critical disease, or even death. Multisystem inflammatory syndrome is a rare but serious condition recently reported in children with COVID-19. Studies indicate that children with obesity are at higher risk of developing severe COVID-19, and inflammation associated with obesity could be one of the factors that worsens COVID-19 symptoms due to an increased inflammatory response involving molecules such as interleukin 6, tumor necrosis factor alpha, and monocyte chemoattractant protein. On the other hand, evidence has been reported of a higher protein expression of ACE2 in the visceral adipose tissue of obese and malnourished humans, and this could be associated with complications and severity of COVID-19. Therefore, regulation of the intake of macronutrients or micronutrients could be used as a strategy to reduce the consequences of COVID-19. Diet in general and bioactive compounds could play an important role in the prevention of the inflammatory cascade.

Routine annual influenza vaccination is recommended for all persons aged &#8805;6 months who do not have contraindications. For each recipient, a licensed and age-appropriate vaccine should be used. Inactivated influenza vaccines (IIVs), recombinant influenza vaccine (RIV4), and live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV4) are expected to be available. Most influenza vaccines available for the 2020-21 season will be quadrivalent, with the exception of MF59-adjuvanted IIV, which is expected to be available in both quadrivalent and trivalent formulations.Updates to the recommendations described in this report reflect discussions during public meetings of ACIP held on October 23, 2019; February 26, 2020; and June 24, 2020. Primary updates to this report include the following two items. First, the composition of 2020-21 U.S. influenza vaccines includes updates to the influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, influenza A(H3N2), and influenza B/Victoria lineage components. Second, recent licensures of two new influenza vaccines, Fluzone High-Dose Quadrivalent and Fluad Quadrivalent, are discussed. Both new vaccines are licensed for persons aged &#8805;65 years. Additional changes include updated discussion of contraindications and precautions to influenza vaccination and the accompanying Table, updated discussion concerning use of LAIV4 in the setting of influenza antiviral medication use, and updated recommendations concerning vaccination of persons with egg allergy who receive either cell culture-based IIV4 (ccIIV4) or RIV4.The 2020-21 influenza season will coincide with the continued or recurrent circulation of SARS-CoV-2 (the novel coronavirus associated with coronavirus disease 2019 [COVID-19]). Influenza vaccination of persons aged &#8805;6 months to reduce prevalence of illness caused by influenza will reduce symptoms that might be confused with those of COVID-19. Prevention of and reduction in the severity of influenza illness and reduction of outpatient illnesses, hospitalizations, and intensive care unit admissions through influenza vaccination also could alleviate stress on the U.S. health care system.

Therefore, indications of nebulizer use during the pandemic should be evaluated on an individual basis in case of a severe asthma attack, and infection control recommendations should be followed by clinicians while using nebulizers. In this article, we aimed to assess the safety in addition to the ""pro"" and ""con"" sides of nebulizer treatment in asthma exacerbation during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Ozturk, A.

The following article discusses currently known features of these pulmonary manifestations from a pathophysiological, symptomatological, and radiological perspective. With regard to pathophysiology, the complex nature of the acute pulmonary disease involving severe injury to the alveolar epithelium and pulmonary vascular endothelium resulting in severe respiratory failure in a proportion of patients is discussed. The differences from ""classic"" acute respiratory distress syndrome and the major effects these have on the treatment of COVID-19 are elucidated. Following a brief description of PCR-based pathogen identification and information on typical laboratory findings, imaging of COVID-19 pneumonia is described in greater details (typical findings, differential diagnoses, grading of the likelihood of COVID-19 pneumonia). This is followed by a description of symptoms, which develop in three phases. With regard to treatment, supportive and intensive care approaches are discussed, including O2 administration and (non-)invasive ventilation.

Nevertheless, although independent events of Nos duplication have been observed in several taxa, only few studies described the regulatory mechanisms responsible for their activation in non-vertebrate animals. To shed light on the mechanisms underlying neuronal-type Nos expression, we focused on two non-vertebrate chordates: the cephalochordate Branchiostoma lanceolatum and the tunicate Ciona robusta. Here, throughout transphyletic and transgenic approaches, we identified genomic regions in both species acting as Nos functional enhancers during development. In vivo analyses of Nos genomic fragments revealed their ability to recapitulate the endogenous expression territories. Therefore, our results suggest the existence of evolutionary conserved mechanisms responsible for neuronal-type Nos regulation in non-vertebrate chordates. In conclusion, this study paves the way for future characterization of conserved transcriptional logic underlying the expression of neuronal-type Nos genes in chordates.","Caccavale, Filomena; Coppola, Ugo; Vassalli, Quirino A; La Vecchia, Claudia; Palumbo, Anna; D039,; Aniello, Enrico; Locascio, Annamaria; Ristoratore, Filomena; Aniello, Salvatore",Dev. genes evol.

The aim of the study was to characterize the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 and Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) functional networks with a focus on CVD. METHODS: Using the network medicine approach and publicly available datasets, we investigated ACE2 tissue expression and described ACE2 interaction networks that could be affected by SARS-CoV-2 infection in the heart, lungs and nervous system. We compared them with changes in ACE-2 networks following SARS-CoV-2 infection by analyzing public data of human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs). This analysis was performed using the Network by Relative Importance (NERI) algorithm, which integrates protein-protein interaction with co-expression networks. We also performed miRNA-target predictions to identify which miRNAs regulate ACE2-related networks and could play a role in the COVID19 outcome. Finally, we performed enrichment analysis for identifying the main COVID-19 risk groups. RESULTS: We found similar ACE2 expression confidence levels in respiratory and cardiovascular systems, supporting that heart tissue is a potential target of SARS-CoV-2. Analysis of ACE2 interaction networks in infected hiPSC-CMs identified multiple hub genes with corrupted signaling which can be responsible for cardiovascular symptoms. The most affected genes were EGFR (Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor), FN1 (Fibronectin 1), TP53, HSP90AA1, and APP (Amyloid Beta Precursor Protein), while the most affected interactions were associated with MAST2 and CALM1 (Calmodulin 1). Enrichment analysis revealed multiple diseases associated with the interaction networks of ACE2, especially cancerous diseases, obesity, hypertensive disease, Alzheimer's disease, non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, and congestive heart failure. Among affected ACE2-network components connected with the SARS-Cov-2 interactome, we identified AGT (Angiotensinogen), CAT (Catalase), DPP4 (Dipeptidyl Peptidase 4), CCL2 (C-C Motif Chemokine Ligand 2), TFRC (Transferrin Receptor) and CAV1 (Caveolin-1), associated with cardiovascular risk factors. We described for the first time miRNAs which were common regulators of ACE2 networks and virus-related proteins in all analyzed datasets. The top miRNAs regulating ACE2 networks were miR-27a-3p, miR-26b-5p, miR-10b-5p, miR-302c-5p, hsa-miR-587, hsa-miR-1305, hsa-miR-200b-3p, hsa-miR-124-3p, and hsa-miR-16-5p. CONCLUSION: Our study provides a complete mechanistic framework for investigating the ACE2 network which was validated by expression data. This framework predicted risk groups, including the established ones, thus providing reliable novel information regarding the complexity of signaling pathways affected by SARS-CoV-2. It also identified miRNAs that could be used in personalized diagnosis in COVID-19.","Wicik, Zofia; Eyileten, Ceren; Jakubik, Daniel; Simões, Sérgio N; Martins, David C; Pavão, Rodrigo; Siller-Matula, Jolanta M; Postula, Marek",,563,5

Meiobenthic nematodes were exposed to three ivermectin doses (1.8 ng.g-1, 9 ng.g-1, and 18 ng.g-1) for 10 days. Ivermectin caused a great reduction in abundance. However, the diversity indices decreased only at high doses. Ivermectin disadvantaged the 1B-Cr-Id functional type (non-selective deposit feeders and nematodes with circular or indistinct amphids) and benefited the 2A-REL-Sp type (epistrate feeders and nematodes with rounded or elongated loop amphids). Thus, Trophic Diversity and Amphideal Diversity index values increased with sedimentary ivermectin enrichment. Large amphideal foveas were more efficient for 2A-REL-Sp nematodes to avoid ivermectin.

METHODS: The study was planned prospectively. The study included 63 male patients over 40 years of age diagnosed with COVID-19. The patients were diagnosed with COVID-19 based on the results of reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction tests of oropharyngeal and nasopharyngeal swabs obtained as per the World Health Organization guidelines. The presence of LUTS was assessed by the International Prostate Symptom Score (I-PSS), a subjective assessment, and the I-PSS was filled for the patients included in the study. The patients were divided into three groups based on their scores in the I-PSS survey: group 1: mild (0–7), group 2: moderate (8–19), and group 3: severe (20–35). The data of all three groups were statistically analyzed. RESULTS: In the assessment performed between the groups, it was identified that for patients in group 3, the length of hospital stay was longer, intensive care requirement was more frequent, and their mortality rates were numerically higher. In the evaluation made regarding the time to intensive care admittance, this was identified to be the shortest in group 3. CONCLUSION: As a result of our study, we think that in patients with COVID-19, BPH-related LUTS can guide clinicians in predicting prognosis.","Karabulut, Ibrahim; Cinislioglu, Ahmet Emre; Cinislioglu, Nazan; Yilmazel, Fatih Kursat; Utlu, Mustafa; Alay, Handan; Celik, Erkan Cem; Adanur, Senol",Urol Int,563,17

MATERIAL/METHODS: This retrospective, single-center observational study included 69 hospitalized patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 from a tertiary hospital in Wuhan, China, between January 14, 2020, and February 26, 2020. Epidemiological, demographic, clinical, and laboratory data, as well as treatments, complications, and outcomes were extracted from electronic medical records and compared between elderly patients (aged ≥60 years) and younger patients (aged <60 years). Patients were followed until March 19, 2020. RESULTS: Elderly patients had more complications than younger patients, including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS; 9/25, 36% vs. 5/44, 11.4%) and cardiac injury (7/25, 28% vs. 1/44, 2.3%), and they were more likely to be admitted to the intensive care unit (6/25, 24% vs. 2/44, 4.5%). As of March 19, 2020, 60/69 (87%) of the patients had been discharged, 6/69 (8.7%) had died, and 3/69 (4.3%) remained in the hospital. Of those who were discharged or died, the median duration of hospitalization was 13.5 days (interquartile range, 10–18 days). CONCLUSIONS: Elderly patients with confirmed COVID-19 were more likely to develop ARDS and cardiac injury than younger patients and were more likely to be admitted to the intensive care unit. In addition to routine monitoring and respiratory support, cardiac monitoring and supportive care should be a focus in elderly patients with COVID-19.","Song, Jia; Hu, Weihang; Yu, Yihua; Shen, Xin; Wang, Yueben; Yan, Jing; Yang, Xianghong; Gong, Shijin; Wang, Minjia",Med Sci Monit,563,24

Methods Twenty consecutive patients from a Long-term COVID-19 Clinic referred to electrophysiological examination with the suspicion of mono- or polyneuropathy were included. Examinations were performed from 77 to 255 (median: 216) days after acute COVID-19. None of the patients had received treatment at the intensive care unit. Of these, 10 patients were not even hospitalized. Conventional nerve conduction studies (NCS) and quantitative electromyography (qEMG) findings from three muscles were compared with 20 age- and sex-matched healthy controls. Results qEMG showed myopathic changes in one or more muscles in 11 patients (55%). Motor unit potential duration was shorter in patients compared to healthy controls in biceps brachii (10.02±0.28 vs 11.75 ± 0.21), vastus medialis (10.86±0.37 vs 12.52±0.19) and anterior tibial (11.76±0.31 vs 13.26±0.21) muscles. All patients with myopathic qEMG reported about physical fatigue and 8 patients about myalgia while 3 patients without myopathic changes complained about physical fatigue. Conclusions Long-term COVID-19 does not cause large fibre neuropathy, but myopathic changes are seen. Significance Myopathy may be an important cause of physical fatigue in long-term COVID-19 even in non-hospitalized patients.","J, Agergaard; S, Leth; TH, Pedersen; T, Harbo; JU, Blicher; P, Karlsson; L, Østergaard; H, Andersen; H, Tankisi",Clin Neurophysiol,563,24

Living labs are collaborative knowledge sharing systems that use multimethod, user-centred approaches that hold potential to catalyse these aims. However, their use in healthcare is limited, and no living lab has been developed in paediatric rehabilitation. In response to this gap and to propel innovative knowledge exchange, we propose a mixed methods study to co-develop a living lab prototype (ie, preliminary infrastructure with opportunity for scale up) in paediatric rehabilitation, with relevance to other healthcare contexts. METHODS: An exploratory sequential mixed methods study will be undertaken to determine research and knowledge exchange priorities and to inform the development of the living lab prototype. Stage 1: we will use a multipronged approach to sample 18–21 youth with developmental differences or rehabilitation needs, their youth siblings and parents/guardians from a provincial paediatric rehabilitation centre, to participate in qualitative and arts-based data collection. Data will provide insight into desirable features of the living lab. Stage 2: E-surveys to youth, siblings, parents/guardians and clinicians who receive or provide services at this same centre will expand on priorities and living lab features. Stage 3: integrated analysis will inform the living lab prototype development. ANALYSIS: Inductive thematic analysis using interpretive description, integrated analysis of visual data and descriptive and content analysis of e-survey data will be undertaken. Joint displays will facilitate data integration. Priorities will be identified using a modified rank-order method for each key living lab domain. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Institutional ethics and site approval have been granted. A parent advisory group and rehabilitation engineering partners will confer on data and inform the development of the living lab prototype. User engagement with the prototype will occur during an online or in-person event, and findings shared through non-technical research summaries, journal articles and academic presentations.","Archibald, Mandy M; Wittmeier, Kristy; Gale, Matthew; Ricci, Florencia; Russell, Kelly; Woodgate, Roberta L",BMJ Open,563,3

It leverages the establishment of Animal Health Ireland for control of animal diseases not regulated by the European Union. The IJCP has four objectives: facilitate protection against spread of JD to uninfected farms; reduce the level of infection when present; assure markets of JD control in Ireland; and improve calf health and farm biosecurity. Key IJCP elements are an annual veterinary risk assessment and management plan (VRAMP), annual whole herd test (WHT) by ELISA on blood or milk samples with ancillary faecal PCR testing of ELISA reactors, and Targeted Advisory Service on Animal Health (TASAH) investigations of infected herds. There are pathways for assurance of herds with continuing negative tests and for management of test-positive herds. Herdowners are responsible for on-farm activities, and specifically-trained (approved) veterinary practitioners have a pivotal role as technical advisors and service providers. The programme is supported by training of veterinarians, performance of testing in designated laboratories, documentation of policies and procedures, innovative data management for herd and test activities and for programme administration, training, and broad communication and awareness activities. Tools and systems are refined to address emerging issues and enhance the value of the programme. An Implementation Group comprising industry, government and technical leaders sets strategic direction and policy, advised by a Technical Working Group. Shared funding responsibilities are agreed by key stakeholders until 2022 to support herds in the programme to complete requirements. Herd registrations have increased steadily to exceed 1,800. National bulk tank milk surveillance is also being deployed to identify and recruit test-positive herds with the expectation that they have a relatively high proportion of seropositive animals. The programme will continue to innovate and improve to meet farmer and industry needs.","Gavey, Lawrence; Citer, Lorna; More, Simon J.; Graham, David",Front Vet Sci,563,12

Whenever a novel virus emerges, reproductive risk assessments should be performed after infection. In this review, we show that male fertility might be damaged by coronavirus associated with (i) direct cytopathic effects derived from viral replication and viral dissemination in the testis; and (ii) indirect damage to male fertility derived from immunopathology. In this review, we briefly describe the impaired fertility of humans and animals infected with coronaviruses to deduce the impact of the new coronavirus on male fertility. Together with information related to other coronaviruses, we extrapolate this knowledge to the new coronavirus SARS‐CoV‐2, which may have a significant impact on our understanding of the pathophysiology of this new virus.","Huang, Chuan; Ji, Xiren; Zhou, Wenjun; Huang, Zhenghui; Peng, Xiangjie; Fan, Liqing; Lin, Ge; Zhu, Wenbing",Andrology,563,29

The murine antisera induced were fully-neutralising in vitro for two separate clinical strains of the MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV). To test the neutralising capacity of these antisera in vivo, susceptibility to MERS-CoV was induced in naive recipient Balb/c mice by the administration of an adenovirus vector expressing the human DPP4 receptor (Ad5-hDPP4) for MERS-CoV, prior to the passive transfer of the RBD-specific murine antisera to the transduced mice. Subsequent challenge of the recipient transduced mice by the intra-nasal route with a clinical isolate of the MERS-CoV resulted in a significantly reduced viral load in their lungs, compared with transduced mice receiving a negative control antibody. The murine antisera used were derived from mice which had been primed sub-cutaneously with a recombinant fusion of RBD with a human IgG Fc tag (RBD-Fc), adsorbed to calcium phosphate microcrystals and then boosted by the oral route with the same fusion protein in reverse micelles.

OBJECTIVE: In times of a shortage of surgeons it makes sense to examine these relationships in order to evaluate future-oriented adjustments to increase the attractiveness of the profession of “surgeon”. MATERIAL AND METHODS: An online questionnaire was sent to the registered members of the German Society for General and Visceral Surgery (DGAV) in October 2016. The members were asked about the application of occupational safety measures, individual living conditions, working conditions and the subjective health burden depending on the level of training and type of hospital (basic, standard, maximum care). RESULTS: The response rate was 21% (1065/5011). Occupational safety measures were not strictly implemented: routine use of dosimeters, thyroid radiation protection, smoke extraction and protective goggles only took place in 40% (427/1065), 39% (411/1065), 10% (104/1065) and 5% (55/1065), respectively. The majority of surgeons (51%, 548/1065) rated their lifestyle as unhealthy. The majority of them are senior physicians, 46% (250/548) consider their job to be a health hazard. The proportion of chief physicians and assistant physicians is only 21% (115/548) and 18% (98/548). CONCLUSION: Guidelines for standardizing the perioperative protection of German surgeons are desirable. Health-promoting behavior could have a positive effect on the occupational safety of surgeons and ultimately also on patient safety.

When coupled with the chest radiographic score, serum biochemical parameters may be utilized to assess serum biochemical changes in individuals with different degrees of MERS-CoV infection and to predict death. The purpose of this study was to examine the association between increased LDH levels and severe MERS-CoV outcomes utilizing ventilation days and an elevated chest radiographic score. RESULTS: Fifty-seven patients were included in the retrospective cohort. The mean age was 44.9 ± 13.5 years, while the range was between 12 and 73 years. With an average age of 53.3 ± 16.5 years, 18 of 57 (31.6%) patients were classified as deceased. The deceased group showed a substantially greater amount of LDH than the recovery group (280.18 ± 150.79 vs. 1241.72 ± 1327.77, p = 0.007). A cut-off value of > 512 LDH was established with a C-statistic of 0.96 (95% CI 0.92–1.00) and was 94% sensitive and 93% specific for mortality. Multivariate cox regression analysis revealed that log(e) (LDH) (adjusted HR: 9.91, 95% CI: 2.44–40.3, p = 0.001) and chest radiographic score (adjusted HR: 1.24, 95% CI: 1.05–1.47, p = 0.01) were risk factors for mortality, whereas ventilation days were a protective factor (adjusted HR: 0.84, 95% CI: 0.76–0.93, p = 0.001). CONCLUSION: According to our results, blood LDH levels of > 512 had a 94% sensitivity and 93% specificity for predicting in-hospital mortality in patients infected with MERS-CoV. The chest radiographic score of 11.34 ± 5.4 was the risk factor for the mortality (adjusted Hazard ratio HR: 1.24, 95% CI: 1.05–1.47, p = 0.01). Thus, threshold may aid in the identification of individuals with MERS-CoV infection who die in hospital.","Das, Karuna M.; Singh, Rajvir; Al Dossari, Khalid; Subramanya, Sandeep; Ojha, Shreesh Kumar; AlMansoori, Taleb; Alkoteesh, Jamal Aldeen",Egypt J Radiol Nucl Med,563,26

These self-generated signals may not be deliberate lies, but they may not bear any relationship with the truth, either. Following the philosopher Harry G. Frankfurt, we refer to such self-generated signals as bullshit. We present an information diffusion model that allows nodes which hold no value to spread information, capturing the diffusion of bullshit information. The presence of self-generated signals (i.e., bullshit) increases the amount of information available for transmission in the network. However, participants in the spread process respond to the existence of such self-generated information by receiving data from internal sources with caution. These two contradictory forces—the increase in information transmission on the one hand, and in suspicion on the other—result in a two-sided effect of bullshit on the total spread time. We first take a numerical approach, simulating our model on Watts–Strogatz networks and building a decision tree to characterize the effects of bullshit given different network structures. We find that increasing the rate of self-generated information may have either a monotonic or non-monotonic effect on the rumor spread time, depending on the network structure and rate of non-self-generated internal communications. Then, taking an analytical approach, we analyze the spread behavior for cliques, and identify the conditions for monotonic behavior in a 2-clique network.","Tuchner, Tomer; Gilboa-Freedman, Gail",Soc Netw Anal Min,563,24

The public’s knowledge and practices play an important role in curbing the spreading of the virus by following the health guidelines. This study aimed to assess the socio-demographic correlate of knowledge and practices of Iraqi living in Mosul-Iraq towards COVID-19 during its rapid rise. A cross-sectional online survey of 909 participants was conducted among a sample of the Mosul-Iraq population between 20(th) June to 1(st) July 2020. The survey included three parts: 1) socio-demographic characteristics, 2) participants’ knowledge, 3) participants’ practices. T-test, ANOVA, chi-square, and binary logistic regression were used. A p-value less than 0.05 (p < 0.05) was considered statistically significant. The results showed a knowledge and practice mean score of (12.91±1.67) and (21.56± 2.92) with cumulative knowledge and practice of 86% and 76% respectively towards COVID-19. Socio-demographic characteristics such as age, marital status, gender, level of education and employment were statistically related with a higher mean score of knowledge and practice towards the virus as P<0.05. We concluded that the majority of the respondents demonstrate a high level of knowledge and practices towards COVID-19 except for respondents with socio-demographic characteristics such as those who were younger, male respondents, those with lower education and those unemployed as such campaigns that will increase the knowledge and encourage adequate preventive practice towards COVID-19 should be targeted towards this group.","Saeed, Balsam Qubais; Al-Shahrabi, Rula; Bolarinwa, Obasanjo Afolabi",PLoS One,563,23

To date, to our knowledge, no studies have investigated the longer-term effects of COVID-19 on vascular function. Herein, we hypothesized that young, otherwise healthy adults who are past the acute phase of COVID-19 would exhibit blunted peripheral [brachial artery flow-mediated dilation (FMD) and reactive hyperemia] and cerebral vasodilator function (cerebral vasomotor reactivity to hypercapnia; CVMR) and increased central arterial stiffness. Sixteen young adults who were at least 4 wk past a COVID-19 diagnosis and 12 controls who never had COVID-19 were studied. Eight subjects with COVID-19 were symptomatic (SYM) and eight were asymptomatic (ASYM) at the time of testing. FMD and reactive hyperemia were not different between COVID and control groups. However, FMD was lower in SYM (3.8 ± 0.6%) compared with ASYM (6.8 ± 0.9%; P = 0.007) and control (6.8 ± 0.6%; P = 0.003) with no difference between ASYM and control. Similarly, peak blood velocity following cuff release was lower in SYM (47 ± 8 cm/s) compared with ASYM (64 ± 19 cm/s; P = 0.025) and control (61 ± 14 cm/s; P = 0.036). CVMR and arterial stiffness were not different between any groups. In summary, peripheral macrovascular and microvascular function, but not cerebral vascular function or central arterial stiffness were blunted in young adults symptomatic beyond the acute phase of COVID-19. In contrast, those who were asymptomatic had similar vascular function compared with controls who never had COVID-19. NEW & NOTEWORTHY This study was the first to investigate the persistent effects of COVID-19 on vascular function in otherwise healthy young adults. We demonstrated that peripheral macrovascular and microvascular vasodilation was significantly blunted in young adults still symptomatic from COVID-19 beyond the acute phase (>4 wk from diagnosis), whereas those who become asymptomatic have similar vascular function compared with controls who never had COVID-19. In contrast, cerebral vascular function and central arterial stiffness were unaffected irrespective of COVID-19 symptomology.","Nandadeva, Damsara; Young, Benjamin E.; Stephens, Brandi Y.; Grotle, Ann-Katrin; Skow, Rachel J.; Middleton, Angela J.; Haseltine, Florence P.; Fadel, Paul J.",Am J Physiol Heart Circ Physiol,563,22

Each student’s instructional format was categorized as: (i) in-person; (ii) hybrid [≥1 day/week in-person]; (iii) online/synchronous (scheduled classes); (iv) online/asynchronous (unscheduled classes); (v) online-mixed; or (vi) no-school. Sleep disturbances (i.e., difficulty falling/staying asleep) were measured with validated PROMIS t-scores. A bootstrapped structural equation model examined how instructional format and sleep disturbances predict school/learning success (SLS), a latent variable loading onto 3 outcomes: (i) school engagement (ii) likert-rated school stress; and (iii) cognitive function (PROMIS t-scores). The model covaried for gender, race-ethnicity, and school-level RESULTS: Our model fit well (RMSEA=.041). Examining total effects (direct + indirect), online and hybrid instruction were associated with lower SLS (b’s:-.06 to -.26; p’s<.01). The three online groups had the strongest effects (synchronous: b=-.15; 95%CI: [-.20, -.11]; asynchronous: b=-.17; [-.23, -.11]; mixed: b=-.14; [-.19, -.098]; p’s<.001). Sleep disturbance was also negatively associated with SLS (b=-.02; [-.02, -.02], p<.001). Monte-carlo simulations confirmed sleep disturbance mediated online instruction’s influence on SLS. The strongest effect was found for asynchronous instruction, with sleep disturbance mediating 24% of its effect (b = -.042; [-0.065, -.019]; p<.001). This sleep-mediated influence of asynchronous instruction propagated down to each SLS measure (p’s<.001), including a near 3-point difference on PROMIS cognitive scores (b = -2.86; [-3.73, -2.00]). CONCLUSION: These analyses from the NESTED study indicate that sleep disruption may be one mechanism through which online instruction impacted learning during the pandemic. Sleep disturbances were unexpectedly influential for unscheduled instruction (i.e., asynchronous). Future analyses will examine specific sleep parameters (e.g., timing) and whether sleep’s influence differs in teens who self-report learning/behavior problems (e.g., ADHD). These nationwide data further underscore the importance of considering sleep as educators and policy makers determine school schedules.

Therefore, assessment of seroprevalence may detect the real burden of disease. We aimed at determining and characterizing the rate of SARS-CoV-2 infections and the resulting seroprevalence in a defined population. The primary objective of the study was to assess SARS-CoV-2 antibody seroprevalence using six different IgG detecting immunoassays. Secondary objectives of the study were: i.) to determine potential risk factors for symptomatic vs. asymptomatic Covid19 courses; ii.) to investigate the rate of virus RNA-persistence. METHODS: CoNAN is a population-based cohort study performed in the community Neustadt am Rennsteig, Germany that was quarantined from March 22(nd) to April 5(th) after six SARS-CoV-2 cases were detected in the villages’ population. The SARS-CoV-2 outbreak compromised 51 cases and 3 deaths. The CoNAN study was performed from May 13th to May 22nd 2020 six weeks after a SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. RESULTS: We enrolled a total of 626 participants (71% of the community population) for PCR- and antibody testing in the study. All actual SARS-CoV-2 PCR tests were negative. Fifty-two out of 620 (8.4%) participants had antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in at least two different assays. There were 38 participants with previously PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Of those, only 19 (50%) displayed anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. We also show that antibody positive participants with symptoms compatible with a respiratory tract infection had significantly higher antibody levels then asymptomatic participants (EU-assay: Median 2.9 vs. 7.2 IgG-index, p=0.002; DS-assay: Median 45.2 vs. 143 AU/mL, p=0.002). Persisting viral replication was not detected. CONCLUSIONS: Our data question the relevance and reliability of IgG antibody testing to detect past SARS-CoV-2 infections six weeks after an outbreak. We conclude that assessing immunity for SARS-CoV-2 infection should not only rely on antibody tests.","Weis, Sebastian; Scherag, André; Baier, Michael; Kiehntopf, Michael; Kamradt, Thomas; Kolanos, Steffi; Ankert, Juliane; Glöckner, Stefan; Makarewicz, Oliwia; Hagel, Stefan; Bahrs, Christina; Kimmig, Aurelia; Proquitté, Hans; Guerra, Joel; Rimek, Dagmar; Löffler, Bettina; Pletz, Mathias W.",Clin Microbiol Infect,563,26

This study aimed to explore experiences and challenges associated with combining clinical academic careers with family life. METHODS: Qualitative data were gathered from participants from 4 NHS Trusts and 2 universities in the East Midlands of England using online surveys and semi-structured interviews. RESULTS: The survey was completed by 67 nurses, midwives and allied health professionals, and 73 medical clinical academic trainees. Interviews were conducted with 16 participants from each group including equal numbers of men and women. Caring responsibilities differed between the two study populations. Medical clinical academic trainees were younger and either had young children or were yet to start a family. In contrast, nurses, midwives and allied health professionals tended to be older when they embarked on a clinical academic career and often waited until their children were school-age or older. Similar concerns were raised regarding working part-time and childcare, and how their career prospects might be affected in terms of fulfilling promotion criteria and being able to relocate for work purposes. The occupation of their partners also featured in participants’ experiences; those who shared childcare with someone who worked ‘regular’ hours, appeared to be better supported to combine a clinical academic career with family life. Gender stereotyping was identified in some reported experiences highlighting a need for appropriate mentorship and for positive role models who were able to demonstrate that it is possible to survive and thrive as a clinical academic with family responsibilities. CONCLUSIONS: Although people manage to find ways to successfully combine clinical academic roles with family life, findings highlight a need to identify ways of supporting and encouraging trainees with caring responsibilities to ensure that they remain on the clinical academic pathway.","Trusson, Diane; Rowley, Emma",BMC Med Educ,563,16

Both FVIR and ACVR were well separated and resolved on the C18 column using the mobile phase blend of methanol:acetonitrile:20 mM phosphate buffer (pH 3.1) in an isocratic mode flow rate of 1 mL/min with a proportion of 30:10:60 %, v/v/v. The detector wavelength was set at 242 nm. Maximum recovery of FVIR and ACVR from plasma was obtained with dichloromethane (DCM) as extracting solvent. The calibration curve was found to be linear in the range of 3.1–60.0 µg/mL with regression coefficient (r(2)) = 0.9976. However, with acceptable r(2), the calibration data’s heteroscedasticity was observed, which was further reduced using weighted linear regression with weighting factor 1/x.

In this article, the authors use the ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) model and autoregressive–moving-average (ARMA) model to improve the prediction results of GPCP. In addition, the authors also conduct direct predictions for those countries with a small number of confirmed cases or are in the early stage of the disease, whose development trends of the pandemic do not fully comply with the law of infectious diseases and cannot be predicted by the GPCP model. Judging from the results, the absolute values of the relative errors of predictions in countries such as Cuba have been reduced significantly and their prediction trends are closer to the real situations through the method mentioned above to revise the prediction results out of GPCP. For countries such as El Salvador with a small number of cases, the absolute values of the relative errors of prediction become smaller.

We propose that researchers should foreground inclusion when designing online qualitative research, and suggest ethical, technological and social adaptations required to move data collection online. Existing research shows that this move can aid in meeting recruitment targets, but can also reduce the richness of the data generated, as well as how much participants enjoy participating, and the ability to achieve consensus in groups. Mindful and consultative choices are required to prevent these problems. To adapt to ethical challenges, researchers should especially consider participant privacy, and ways to build rapport and show appropriate care for participants, including protocols for dealing with distress or disengagement, managing data, and supporting consent. To adapt to technological challenges, research plans should choose between online modalities and platforms based on a clear understanding of their particular affordances and the implications of these. Finally, successful research in virtual social environments requires new protocols for engagement before data collection, attention to group numbers and dynamics, altered moderator teams and roles, and new logistical tasks for researchers. The increasing centrality of online environments to everyday life is driving traditional qualitative research methods to online environments and generating new qualitative research methods that respond to the particularities of online worlds. With strong design principles and attention to ethical, technical and social challenges, online methods can make a significant contribution to qualitative research in health.","Carter, Stacy M.; Shih, Patti; Williams, Jane; Degeling, Chris; Mooney-Somers, Julie",Patient,563,24

METHODS: Whole-blood from 56 COVID-19 and 23 “NO-COVID-19” individuals were overnight stimulated with different concentrations (0.1 or 1 µg/mL) of SARS-CoV-2 PepTivator® Peptide Pools, including spike (pool S), nucleocapsid (pool N), membrane (pool M), and a MegaPool (MP) of these three peptide pools. ELISA was used to analyse IFN-γ levels. RESULTS: IFN-γ-response to every SARS-CoV-2 peptide pool was significantly increased in COVID-19 patients compared with “NO-COVID-19” individuals. Pool S and MegaPool were the most potent immunogenic stimuli (median: 0.51, IQR: 0.14-2.17; and median: 1.18, IQR: 0.27-4.72, respectively) compared to pools N and M (median: 0.22, IQR: 0.032-1.26; and median: 0.22, IQR: 0.01-0.71, respectively).

MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this retrospective single-center study, we enrolled consecutive patients from February 15, 2020, to March 15, 2020, with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 hospitalized in Valduce Hospital (Como, Italy). Multi-modality imaging findings were evaluated and compared. Literature research was conducted through a methodical search on Pubmed and Embase databases. RESULTS: Fifty-eight patients (36 men, 22 women; age range, 18–98 years) were included in the study. Among these, chest US, CXR, and CT were performed respectively in twenty-two, thirty-two and forty-two patients. Lung US findings were consistent with diffuse B lines (100%) and subpleural consolidations (27.3%). CXR showed prevalent manifestations of consolidations (46.9%) and hazy increased opacities (37.5%). Typical CT features included bilateral and multilobar ground-glass opacities (GGO) with (59.5%) and without (35.7%) consolidations having a predominantly peripheral distribution (64.3%). Other imaging features included crazy paving pattern (57.1%), fibrous stripes (50%), subpleural lines (35.7%), architectural distortion (28.6%), air bronchogram sign (26.2%), vascular thickening (23.8%) and nodules (2.4%). Also, enlarged lymph nodes (14.3 %) and pleural effusion (7.1%) were observed. The literature review identified twenty-six original studies supporting our imaging chest findings. CONCLUSION: The spectrum of chest imaging manifestations of COVID-19 pneumonia upon admission includes B-lines and consolidations on US, consolidations and hazy increased opacities on CXR, and multifocal GGO with consolidations on CT.","Lomoro, Pascal; Verde, Francesco; Zerboni, Filippo; Simonetti, Igino; Borghi, Claudia; Fachinetti, Camilla; Natalizi, Anna; Martegani, Alberto",Eur J Radiol Open,563,28

Viral infections of cultivated shellfish, crustacea, and finfish have been frequently recognized in the past few years. In the Asian regions, penaeid shrimp and several teleost fish underwent epizootics associated with heavy losses in aquaculture. Baculoviruses are particularly harmful to shrimp and prawns. Herpes-, irido-, reo-, or rhabdovirus-like agents can cause outbreaks in fish farms. Viral diseases are important limiting factors in the expansion of aquaculture. However, studies on viral infections of aquatic animals have been focused primarily on economically important farmed fish. Therfore, certain viral diseases of teleost fish are relatively well understood. In contrast, our knowledge of viral infections of farmed aquatic invertebrates is still very spare. Although a great number of viruses have been detected in farmed molluscs and crustaceans, the pathogenicity and epizootiology of most of the agents is not known.","Ahne, W.",Annual Review of Fish Diseases,563,8

Similar to other animal coronaviruses, SARS‐CoV‐2 contains a functional furin cleavage site in its spike protein, which may broaden the SARS‐CoV‐2 host range and affect pathogenesis. Whether ongoing zoonotic infections are possible in addition to efficient human‐to‐human transmission remains unclear. In contrast, human‐to‐animal transmission can occur based on evidence provided from natural and experimental settings. Carnivores, including domestic cats, ferrets and minks, appear to be particularly susceptible to SARS‐CoV‐2 in contrast to poultry and other animals reared as livestock such as cattle and swine. Epidemiologic evidence supported by genomic sequencing corroborated mink‐to‐human transmission events in farm settings. Airborne transmission of SARS‐CoV‐2 between experimentally infected cats additionally substantiates the possibility of cat‐to‐human transmission. To evaluate the COVID‐19 risk represented by domestic and farmed carnivores, experimental assessments should include surveillance and health assessment of domestic and farmed carnivores, characterization of the immune interplay between SARS‐CoV‐2 and carnivore coronaviruses, determination of the SARS‐CoV‐2 host range beyond carnivores and identification of human risk groups such as veterinarians and farm workers. Strategies to mitigate the risk of zoonotic SARS‐CoV‐2 infections may have to be developed in a One Health framework and non‐pharmaceutical interventions may have to consider free‐roaming animals and the animal farming industry.","Jo, Wendy K.; de Oliveira‐Filho, Edmilson Ferreira; Rasche, Andrea; Greenwood, Alex D.; Osterrieder, Klaus; Drexler, Jan Felix",Transbound Emerg Dis,563,26

Some disinfectants, like sanitizers, contain genotoxic chemicals that damage microbial DNA, like phenol and hydrogen peroxide. This damage activates error-prone DNA repair enzymes, which can lead to mutations that induce antimicrobial resistance. Public health priority programs that have faced drug-resistance challenges associated with diseases, such as tuberculosis, HIV, and malaria, have given less attention to risks attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic. Pathogen-specific programs, like the directly observed treatment strategy, which were designed to fight resistance against anti-tuberculosis drugs, have currently become impractical, because COVID-19 restrictions have limited in-person visits to health institutions.

We want to assess the role of targeted synthetic or biologic disease modifying antirheumatic drugs (ts/bDMARDs) and other variables in the development of moderate-severe COVID-19 disease in IRD. Methods: An observational longitudinal study was conducted (1stMar to 15thApr 2020). All patients from the rheumatology outpatient clinic from a hospital in Madrid with a medical diagnosis of IRD were included. Main outcome: hospital admission related to COVID-19. Independent variable: ts/bDMARDs. Covariates: sociodemographic, comorbidities, type of IRD diagnosis, glucocorticoids, NSAIDs and conventional synthetic DMARDs (csDMARDs). Incidence rate (IR) of hospital admission related to COVID-19, was expressed per 1,000 patients-month. Cox multivariate regression analysis was run to examine the influence of ts/bDMARDs and other covariates on IR. Results: 3,591 IRD patients were included (5,896 patients-month). Concerning csDMARDs, methotrexate was the most used followed by antimalarials. 802 patients were on ts/bDMARDs, mainly anti-TNF agents, and rituximab. Hospital admissions related to COVID-19 occurred in 54 patients (1.36%) with an IR of 9.15 [95%CI: 7-11.9]. In the multivariate analysis, older, male gender, presence of comorbidities and specific systemic autoimmune conditions (Sjoegren, polychondritis, Raynaud and mixed connective tissue disease) had more risk of hospital admissions regardless other factors.

Experiences from the previous epidemic suggest that community perceptions, social norms and cultural practices can impede COVID-19 containment. To understand social responses towards COVID-19, the study aims to explore the understanding of COVID-19 and the acceptance of control measures among community members. METHODS: We conducted an exploratory qualitative study using a purposive sampling approach, at two communities of Karachi, Pakistan. In-depth interviews were conducted with community members including, young, middle-aged and older adults of both genders. Study data were analysed manually using the conventional content analysis technique. RESULTS: A total of 27 in-depth virtual interviews were conducted, between May and June 2020. Six overarching themes were identified: (1) community knowledge and perceptions around COVID-19; (2) trusted and preferred sources of health information; (3) initial thoughts and feeling towards COVID-19 pandemic; (4) community practices to prevent exposure from COVID-19; (5) perceived risks associated with poor adherence to infection control practices; and (6) future preparedness of community to avoid the second wave of the outbreak. Generally, community members had good knowledge about COVID-19, and positive behaviour and attitude towards using standard precautions. The knowledge is mainly acquired through electronic, print and social media platforms, which have pros and cons. However, some community members including younger individuals had poor adherence to safety measures. This may necessitate concentrated efforts to raise awareness through community mobilisation and sensitisation activities. CONCLUSION: This study provides an initial evidence base of communities’ perceptions, and attitudes towards COVID-19 in an early stage of pandemic. The study emphasises that sufficient knowledge and awareness about COVID-19, adequate training and drills, and adherence to safety measures, are necessary to better prepare for the second wave of COVID-19.","Shahil Feroz, Anam; Ali, Naureen Akber; Feroz, Ridah; Akber, Noshaba; Nazim Meghani, Salima",BMJ Open,563,16

Outcomes (death or recovery) were assessed at the end of the discharge period or at the end of the follow-up (August 2020). During hospitalization, 59 patients died, while 6 died after discharge. The following variables were demonstrated to be associated with a worse prognosis: Radiologic Brixia score higher than 8, presence at baseline of hypertension, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, heart disease, cancer, previous treatment with ACE-inhibitors or anti-platelet drugs. Anticoagulant treatment during hospital admission with enoxaparin at a dose higher than 4000 U once daily was associated with a better prognosis. In conclusion, our study demonstrates that some co-morbidities and cardiovascular risk factors may affect prognosis. The radiologic Brixia score may be a useful tool to stratify the risk of death at baseline. Anticoagulant treatment with enoxaparin might be associated to a clinical benefit in terms of survival in patients with COVID-19.","Boari, Gianluca E.M.; Chiarini, Giulia; Bonetti, Silvia; Malerba, Paolo; Bianco, Gianluca; Faustini, Cristina; Braglia-Orlandini, Federico; Turini, Daniele; Guarinoni, Vittoria; Saottini, Michele; Viola, Sara; Ferrari-Toninelli, Giulia; Pasini, Giancarlo; Mascadri, Cristina; Bonzi, Bianca; Desenzani, Paolo; Tusi, Claudia; Zanotti, Eros; Nardin, Matteo; Rizzoni, Damiano",Biosci Rep,563,14

The pandemic-related impacts on the health outcomes of people with dermatological conditions are unknown. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this paper was to study the association of COVID-19 pandemic–related impacts with health-related quality of life in patients with skin diseases. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study among Chinese patients with skin diseases. A self-administered web-based questionnaire was distributed through social media. Demographic and clinical data and pandemic-related impacts (isolation status, income changes, and employment status) were collected. The main outcomes included perceived stress (Visual Analog Scale), symptoms of anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7) and depression (9-Item Patient Health Questionnaire), quality of life (Dermatology Life Quality Index), and health utility mapping based on the EQ-5D-3L descriptive system. Multivariable logistic regression was used to investigate the associations. RESULTS: A total of 506 patients with skin diseases completed the survey. The mean age of the patients was 33.5 years (SD 14.0), and 217/506 patients (42.9%) were male. Among the 506 respondents, 128 (25.3%) were quarantined, 102 (20.2%) reported unemployment, and 317 (62.6%) reported decrease or loss of income since the pandemic. The pandemic-related impacts were significantly associated with impaired mental well-being and quality of life with different effects. Unemployment and complete loss of income were associated with the highest risks of adverse outcomes, with increases of 110% to 162% in the prevalence of anxiety, depression, and impaired quality of life. CONCLUSIONS: Isolation, income loss, and unemployment are associated with impaired health-related quality of life in patients with skin diseases during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Guo, Yeye; Shen, Minxue; Zhang, Xu; Xiao, Yi; Zhao, Shuang; Yin, Mingzhu; Bu, Wenbo; Wang, Yan; Chen, Xiang; Su, Juan",J Med Internet Res,563,29

Samples microscopically positive for Cryptosporidium were further tested by PCR/sequencing for species assessment. The most frequently detected parasite was Balantidium coli, a facultative pathogenic ciliate with zoonotic potential, in 5.1, 36.7 and 50.0% of suckling, weaners and fatteners and 43.2% of farms; however, no association with disease was observed. Isospora (syn. Cystoisospora) suis infections were detected in 13.3 and 11.1% of suckling piglets with and without diarrhoea, and in 10.0 and 13.3% of weaners and fatteners with diarrhoea, respectively, and were significant associated with emaciation. Cryptosporidium infections were detected in 10.3, 15.0 and 19.2% of sucklings, weaners and fatteners, respectively, and in 18.9% of the farms. Interestingly, two age-related species were identified: C. suis in younger piglets (2 to 6 weeks) and C. scrofarum in older ones (6 to 17 weeks). None of the pigs infected with C. scrofarum (n = 8), but 3 of 4 piglets infected with C. suis (co-infection with I. suis in 2 cases) had diarrhoea. The zoonotic species C. parvum was not detected, nevertheless, sporadic cases of human infection with the porcine-adapted species have been reported. Ascaris suum, Trichuris suis and Strongylida were rarely detected (< 4%) in all age categories.","Schubnell, Fabienne; von Ah, Sereina; Graage, Robert; Sydler, Titus; Sidler, Xaver; Hadorn, Daniela; Basso, Walter",Parasitol Int,563,5

SUMMARY ANSWER: Our results suggest that medically assisted reproduction (MAR) pregnancies are not differentially affected by SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to spontaneous pregnancies. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Information on the effects of COVID-19 on pregnancy after MAR is scarce when women get infected during MAR or early pregnancy, even though such information is vital for informing women seeking pregnancy. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: Data from SARS-CoV-2 affected MAR pregnancies were collected between May 2020 and June 2021 through a voluntary data collection, organised by the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology (ESHRE). PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: All ESHRE members were invited to participate to an online data collection for SARS-CoV-2-infected MAR pregnancies. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: The dataset includes 80 cases from 32 countries, including 67 live births, 10 miscarriages, 2 stillbirths and 1 maternal death. An additional 25pregnancies were ongoing at the time of writing. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: An international data registry based on voluntary contribution can be subject to selective reporting with possible risks of over- or under-estimation.

Stem cell-based regenerative medicine is considered a solution. Years of research point to two important aspects: (1) the use of cellular imaging to achieve sufficient precision of therapeutic intervention, and the fact that (2) many therapeutic actions are executed through extracellular vesicles (EV), released by stem cells. Therefore, there is an urgent need to interrogate cellular labels in the context of EV release. We studied clinically applicable cellular labels: superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPION), and radionuclide detectable by two main imaging modalities: MRI and PET. We have demonstrated effective stem cell labeling using both labels. Then, we obtained EVs from cell cultures and tested for the presence of cellular labels. We did not find either magnetic or radioactive labels in EVs. Therefore, we report that stem cells do not lose labels in released EVs, which indicates the reliability of stem cell magnetic and radioactive labeling, and that there is no interference of labels with EV content. In conclusion, we observed that direct cellular labeling seems to be an attractive approach to monitoring stem cell delivery, and that, importantly, labels neither locate in EVs nor affect their basic properties.","Gao, Yue; Jablonska, Anna; Chu, Chengyan; Walczak, Piotr; Janowski, Miroslaw",Membranes (Basel),563,14

It is unclear if these benefits extend to patients with mild (NYHA functional class II) or severe (NYHA functional class IV) symptoms of heart failure or to patients with elevated natriuretic peptides without a recent heart failure hospitalisation. This trial was designed to evaluate whether haemodynamic-guided management using remote pulmonary artery pressure monitoring could reduce heart failure events and mortality in patients with heart failure across the spectrum of symptom severity (NYHA funational class II-IV), including those with elevated natriuretic peptides but without a recent heart failure hospitalisation. METHODS The randomised arm of the haemodynamic-GUIDEed management of Heart Failure (GUIDE-HF) trial was a multicentre, single-blind study at 118 centres in the USA and Canada. Following successful implantation of a pulmonary artery pressure monitor, patients with all ejection fractions, NYHA functional class II-IV chronic heart failure, and either a recent heart failure hospitalisation or elevated natriuretic peptides (based on a-priori thresholds) were randomly assigned (1:1) to either haemodynamic-guided heart failure management based on pulmonary artery pressure or a usual care control group. Patients were masked to their study group assignment. Investigators were aware of treatment assignment but did not have access to pulmonary artery pressure data for control patients. The primary endpoint was a composite of all-cause mortality and total heart failure events (heart failure hospitalisations and urgent heart failure hospital visits) at 12 months assessed in all randomly assigned patients. Safety was assessed in all patients. A pre-COVID-19 impact analysis for the primary and secondary outcomes was prespecified. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03387813. FINDINGS Between March 15, 2018, and Dec 20, 2019, 1022 patients were enrolled, with 1000 patients implanted successfully, and follow-up was completed on Jan 8, 2021. There were 253 primary endpoint events (0·563 per patient-year) among 497 patients in the haemodynamic-guided management group (treatment group) and 289 (0·640 per patient-year) in 503 patients in the control group (hazard ratio [HR] 0·88, 95% CI 0·74-1·05; p=0·16). A prespecified COVID-19 sensitivity analysis using a time-dependent variable to compare events before COVID-19 and during the pandemic suggested a treatment interaction (pinteraction=0·11) due to a change in the primary endpoint event rate during the pandemic phase of the trial, warranting a pre-COVID-19 impact analysis. In the pre-COVID-19 impact analysis, there were 177 primary events (0·553 per patient-year) in the intervention group and 224 events (0·682 per patient-year) in the control group (HR 0·81, 95% CI 0·66-1·00; p=0·049). This difference in primary events almost disappeared during COVID-19, with a 21% decrease in the control group (0·536 per patient-year) relative to pre-COVID-19, virtually no change in the treatment group (0·597 per patient-year), and no difference between groups (HR 1·11, 95% CI 0·80-1·55; p=0·53). The cumulative incidence of heart failure events was not reduced by haemodynamic-guided management (0·85, 0·70-1·03; p=0·096) in the overall study analysis but was significantly decreased in the pre-COVID-19 impact analysis (0·76, 0·61-0·95; p=0·014). 1014 (99%) of 1022 patients had freedom from device or system-related complications. INTERPRETATION Haemodynamic-guided management of heart failure did not result in a lower composite endpoint rate of mortality and total heart failure events compared with the control group in the overall study analysis. However, a pre-COVID-19 impact analysis indicated a possible benefit of haemodynamic-guided management on the primary outcome in the pre-COVID-19 period, primarily driven by a lower heart failure hospitalisation rate compared with the control group.

Design: This was not a study or clinical trial, but rather a retrospective interim audit (Newcastle-upon-Tyne Hospitals Registration No. 10075) of a local clinical care pathway for hospitalized patients with COVID-19-related illness. The Information (Caldicott) Guardian permitted these data to be shared beyond the confines of our institution. Setting: A large tertiary academic NHS Foundation Trust in the North East of England, UK, providing care to COVID-19 patients. Participants: One hundred thirty-four hospitalized patients with documented COVID-19 infection. Main outcome measures: Adherence to local investigation and treatment protocol; prevalence of VDD, and relationship of baseline serum 25(OH)D with markers of COVID-19 severity and inpatient fatality versus recovery. Results: 55.8% of eligible patients received Colecalciferol replacement, albeit not always loaded as rapidly as our protocol suggested, and no cases of new hypercalcaemia occurred following treatment. Patients admitted to ITU were younger than those managed on medical wards (61.1 years +/- 11.8 vs. 76.4 years +/- 14.9, p<0.001), with greater prevalence of hypertension, and higher baseline respiratory rate, National Early Warning Score-2 and C-reactive protein level. While mean serum 25(OH)D levels were comparable [i.e. ITU: 33.5 nmol/L +/- 16.8 vs. Non-ITU: 48.1 nmol/L +/- 38.2, mean difference for Ln-transformed-25(OH)D: 0.14, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) (-0.15, 0.41), p=0.3], only 19% of ITU patients had 25(OH)D levels greater than 50 nmol/L vs. 39.1% of non-ITU patients (p=0.02). However, we found no association with fatality, potentially due to small sample size, limitations of no-trial data and, potentially, the prompt diagnosis and treatment of VDD. Conclusions: Subject to the inherent limitations of observational (non-trial) audit data, analysed retrospectively, we found that patients requiring ITU admission were more frequently vitamin D deficient than those managed on medical wards, despite being significantly younger. Larger prospective studies and/or clinical trials are needed to elucidate the role of vitamin D as a preventive and/or therapeutic strategy for mitigating the effects of COVID-19 infection in patients with VDD.","Panagiotou, Grigorios; Tee, Su Ann; Ihsan, Yasir; Athar, Waseem; Marchitelli, Gabriella; Kelly, Donna; Boot, Christopher S.; Stock, Nadia; Macfarlane, Jim; Martineau, Adrian R.; Burns, Graham Paul; Quinton, Richard",,563,16

As part of the second lockdown, in many states schools and day care centers were also closed or reduced to a minimum. In this context the effect of room air filters has already been discussed multiple times; however, mobile devices for air filtration are currently not recommended by the German Federal Environment Agency. The following investigation shows the real effects of mobile air filters on aerosol concentrations when used in lecture theaters, canteens or school learning centers. METHODS: The effects of a mobile air purifier (DEMA-airtech, Stuttgart, Germany) were measured in three large rooms (a lecture theater, a company canteen and a learning center of a grammar school). Aerosol and carbon dioxide concentrations were determined with devices from the company Palas (Karlsruhe, Germany). RESULTS: All three scenarios showed a relevant and permanent decrease in aerosol concentrations through the use of air filters. The effect partly even surpassed the effectiveness of simple ventilation by opening the windows. CONCLUSION: In addition to social distancing and wearing highly efficient face masks, the use air filters is recommended. This measure could enable classroom teaching to be resumed.","Oberst, M.; Klar, T.; Heinrich, A.",Zentralbl Arbeitsmed Arbeitsschutz Ergon,563,30

Although usually given in the subcutaneous form, previous anecdotal reports have emphasized its utility when given intravenously. Our aim is to report our experience on the beneficial effects of intravenous anakinra in patients with SARS-CoV-2 and evidence of hyperinflammation. METHODS: We report 4 patients with severe COVID-19 infection requiring intensive care admission and ventilatory support. RESULTS: All four patients showed evidence of deterioration with hyperferritinaemia, and increasing oxygen requirements, with supra-added bacterial infections. Upon commencement of intravenous anakinra, there was subsequent improvement in the patients clinically with reducing ventilatory support and inotropic support, and biochemically, with rapid improvement in inflammatory markers. CONCLUSION: Intravenous anakinra is safe to use in patients with COVID-19 and evidence of supra-added bacterial infection. Although its utility has not been confirmed in a randomized trial, current research in the COVID-19 pandemic aims to establish the utility of immunosuppression, including IL-1 blockade on the outcomes of patients with moderate to severe disease. Our case series support its use in patients with severe-life threatening COVID-19 and evidence of hyperinflammation.","Clark, Kristina E N; Collas, Oliver; Lachmann, Helen; Singh, Animesh; Buckley, Jim; Bhagani, Sanjay",Rheumatol Adv Pract,563,3

As on 22nd of October 2020, US FDA fully approved drug Remdesivir for the treatment of COVID-19 patients who requires hospitalisation. Many clinical studies reported the derangement in hepatic and renal function tests which is alarming considering the health conditions of the COVID-19 patients. In view of these results, the present study was envisaged to review the safety of Remdesivir in COVID-19 patients. The PubMed, Embase and Cochrane databases was searched using 'Remdesivir', 'veklury', 'SARS' and 'COVID' till 1st of December 2020. The studies included in this meta-analysis were either randomised or non-randomised studies that evaluated Remdesivir for the treatment of COVID-19 against Placebo [standard of care]. The Adverse events [AEs], Serious adverse events [SAEs] and Treatment Discontinuation due to Adverse Events (TDAE) was used as primary outcome measures. The quality of studies was evaluated by using the Cochrane Collaboration's tool for assessment of RoB. Data analysis was performed by two authors (MK & DB) using statistical software Review manager [Revman] version 5.3. The pooled Risk Ratios (RR) and 95% Confidence Intervals (CI) were calculated by using a random-effects model for both primary and secondary outcomes. A total of four RCTs were included for the meta-analysis. Out of the four included clinical trials accepted for its methodological quality, three were of excellent quality and one study was of moderate quality. The pooled estimates of the three studies showed that Remdesivir had 24% lower risk of SAEs compared to placebo arm. However, the pooled estimates of two studies showed that 10 days of Remdesivir had 56% higher risk of SAEs compared to 5 days of Remdesivir regimen. Similarly, the 10 days of Remdesivir had two times higher risk of TDAEs compared to 5 days Remdesivir regimen. In conclusion, our meta-analysis demonstrated that Remdesivir is a safe therapeutic option. Our metanalysis revealed 5 days' regimen have better safety profile than 10 days' regimen of drug Remdesivir with respect to SAEs and TDAEs. For hospitalized patients, a 5-day course could be preferable with fewer safety concerns and lower drug costs.","Konwar, Mahanjit; Maurya, Miteshkumar; Bose, Debdipta",Current drug safety,563,14

METHODS: Patients with ESRD (ESRD group; n = 52) and healthy controls (HC group; n = 44) were recruited. Clinical periodontal parameters were recorded. The differential metabolites in the GCF and serum were identified by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS). Inflammatory markers including interleukin-1β (IL-1β), interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-8 (IL-8), and C-reactive protein (CRP) were also assessed. RESULTS: In the ESRD group, IL-8 and CRP were significantly higher in GCF, whereas IL-6 and CRP were significantly higher in serum, compared with HC group (all P < 0.05). In the case of GCF, taurine levels were positively correlated with IL-8 levels in both groups (all P < 0.05). In the case of serum, l-phenylalanine and p-hydroxyphenylacetic acid levels were positively correlated with CRP levels in both groups (all P < 0.05). Significant positive correlations were observed between metabolites (including pseudouridine, l-phenylalanine, and p-hydroxyphenylacetic acid) and IL-6 levels only in ESRD group. CONCLUSIONS: IL-8 and CRP are potential inflammatory makers that reflect the periodontal health of ESRD individual, which may be considered the valuable predictive diagnostics in the agreement with PPPM philosophy. Besides, metabolites of taurine in GCF as well as l-phenylalanine and p-hydroxyphenylacetic acid in serum are possible biomarkers correlated with inflammatory markers. All these biomarkers may also be highly recommended as a novel predictive/diagnostic tool for the assessment of inflammatory status from the perspectives of PPPM in view of susceptible population and individual screening.","Ma, Xiaoxin; Wang, Yongli; Wu, Hongyu; Li, Fei; Feng, Xiping; Xie, Yingxin; Xie, Danshu; Wang, Wenji; Lo, Edward Chin Man; Lu, Haixia",EPMA J,563,21

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We prospectively evaluated the admission CXR of 327 patients accessed to our institute during the Italian pandemic descending phase (April 2020). For each CXR were searched ground glass opacification (GGO), consolidation (CO), reticular-nodular opacities (RNO), nodules, excavations, pneumothorax, pleural effusion, vascular congestion and cardiac enlargement. For lung alterations was defined the predominance (upper or basal, focal or diffuse, central or peripheric, etc.). Then radiologists assessed whether CXRs were suggestive or not for COVID-19 infection. For COVID-19 patients, a prognostic score was applied and correlated with the patients’ outcome. RESULTS: CXR showed 83% of specificity and 60% of sensitivity. GGO, CO, RNO and a peripheric, diffuse and basal prevalence showed good correlation with COVID-19 diagnosis. A logistic regression analysis pointed out GGO and a basal or diffuse distribution as independent predictors of COVID-19 diagnosis. The prognostic score showed good correlation with the patients’ outcome. CONCLUSION: In our study, admission CXR showed a fair specificity and a good correlation with patients’ outcome. GGO and others CXR findings showed a good correlation with COVID-19 diagnosis; besides GGO a diffuse or bibasal distribution resulted in independent variables highly suggestive for COVID-19 infection thus enabling radiologists to signal to clinicians radiologically suspect patients during the pandemic descending phase.","Moroni, Chiara; Cozzi, Diletta; Albanesi, Marco; Cavigli, Edoardo; Bindi, Alessandra; Luvarà, Silvia; Busoni, Simone; Mazzoni, Lorenzo Nicola; Grifoni, Stefano; Nazerian, Peiman; Miele, Vittorio",Radiol Med,563,16

EXPERIENCIA DE DOS CENTROS,17.05732,-0.44534248,2020-05-31,"Introduction Thromboembolic outcomes have emerged as an important issue in sick hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Multiple pathogenetic mechanisms for thrombosis have been implicated, including endothelial dysfunction, increased von Willebrand factor (vWF), interleukin-6 release, and activation of/interaction between macrophages, monocytes, endothelial cells, platelets and lymphocytes. The actual rate of arterial and venous thromboembolic events (ATE and VTE) in hospitalized patients with COVID-19, especially in the immediate post-hospital discharge period, has not been fully elucidated, with most of the data derived from retrospective studies with small sample sizes. Methods Against this background, we have designed and implemented an ongoing prospective registry (CORE-19) consisting of 11,249 consecutive hospitalized patients with COVID-19 from March 1st 2020 through May 31st 2020 using data derived from the Northwell Health System and the COVID-19 Research Consortium to study through 90-days post-discharge the rate of VTE and ATE, major bleeding, all-cause mortality, and other complications. We are capturing data of interest including demographic characteristics, co-morbidities, relevant medications, hospital setting, in-hospital treatment, thromboprophylaxis usage, key laboratory parameters, and 90-day thromboembolic and other key outcomes. A unified data repository (datamart) of hospitalized COVID-19 patients across multiple datasets from electronic health records, health informatics exchange, a dedicated radiology database, and a standardized data collection tool in REDCap, that includes telephonic calls up to 90 days post-discharge, is being implemented. A common data model (CDM) is utilized to ensure semantic interoperability between data originating from disparate sources. Northwell Health protocols stipulate the use of post-discharge low-molecular weight heparin, direct oral anticoagulants, or baby aspirin in hospitalized COVID-19 patients with high thrombotic risk features. Results Our cohort as of August 7, 2020 consists of complete follow up in 4,100 patients with a mean age of 61.0 years (SD: 17.0) with 54.7% males (Table 1). Preliminary data show an all-cause mortality rate of 4.29%, an overall thromboembolic rate of 3.51% (2.41% VTE and 1.10% ATE), a major bleeding rate of 1.61%, and a rehospitalization rate of 12.85%. Of patients with either DVT or PE post-discharge, 13.43% (9/67) died. The full dataset, including risk factors, comorbidities, key in-hospital and post-discharge medications including anticoagulant and antiplatelet agents, will be available at the time of presentation to the ASH congress. Conclusion Our ongoing registry is a large prospective study evaluating the rate of overall thromboembolic complications and all-cause mortality in hospitalized COVID-19 patients through 90 days post discharge. Current rates of thromboembolic events signify the importance of post-discharge surveillance and, potentially, post-discharge extended thromboprophylaxis, in this acutely ill medical population.

Specifically, the study analyzed: (a) if different conditions were associated with different levels of distress, different levels of worry, and different emotion regulation strategies (i.e., cognitive reappraisal, expressive suppression); and (b) if distress levels were associated with levels of worry about COVID-19, emotion regulation strategies, and changes to medical treatment due to the pandemic. METHOD: This cross-sectional study involved 124 individuals (79.8% female; mean age = 48.88 years; SD = 14.95) with a diagnosis of chronic disease. The questionnaires, administered during the peak of the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy (April-May 2020), comprised the Perceived Stress Scale, the Emotion Regulation Questionnaire, a COVID-19 worry questionnaire, and a questionnaire designed to collect anamnestic and sociodemographic data. RESULTS: Higher levels of expressive suppression and worries related to COVID-19, and changes to medical treatment due to the pandemic, were associated with higher perceived stress in patients with a preexisting chronic disease. No differences emerged in the study variables according to the type of chronic disease. CONCLUSIONS: The results highlight the importance of considering expressive suppression, levels of worry about COVID-19, and changes to scheduled medical treatment. Screening procedures based on these factors may be useful for identifying individuals with a preexisting medical condition at higher risk of distress, in order to offer them specific and remotely delivered psychological support.

The aim of the present research is to identify variability and efficiency opportunities in cataract surgical practices globally. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: 9 global cataract surgical facilities used the Eyefficiency tool to collect facility-level data (staffing, pathway steps, costs of supplies and energy use), and live time-and-motion data. A point person from each site gathered and reported data on 1 week or 30 consecutive cataract surgeries. Environmental life cycle assessment and descriptive statistics were used to quantify productivity, costs and carbon footprint. The main outcomes were estimates of productivity, costs, greenhouse gas emissions, and solid waste generation per-case at each site. RESULTS: Nine participating sites recorded 475 cataract extractions (a mix of phacoemulsification and manual small incision). Cases per hour ranged from 1.7 to 4.48 at single-bed sites and 1.47 to 4.25 at dual-bed sites. Average per-case expenditures ranged between £31.55 and £399.34, with a majority of costs attributable to medical equipment and supplies. Average solid waste ranged between 0.19 kg and 4.27 kg per phacoemulsification, and greenhouse gases ranged from 41 kg carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2e) to 130 kg CO2e per phacoemulsification. CONCLUSION: Results demonstrate the global diversity of cataract surgical services and non-clinical metrics. Eyefficiency supports local decision-making for resource efficiency and could help identify regional or global best practices for optimising productivity, costs and environmental impact of cataract surgery.","Goel, Hena; Wemyss, Thomas Alan; Harris, Tanya; Steinbach, Ingeborg; Stancliffe, Rachel; Cassels-Brown, Andrew; Thomas, Peter Benjamin Michael; Thiel, Cassandra L",BMJ Open Ophthalmol,563,16

NDV-HXP-S is an inactivated egg-based Newcastle disease virus vaccine expressing the spike protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). It is being developed in Thailand, Vietnam, and Brazil; herein are initial results from Thailand. This phase 1 stage of a randomised, dose-escalation, observer-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 1/2 trial was conducted at the Vaccine Trial Centre, Mahidol University (Bangkok). Healthy adults aged 18-59 years, non-pregnant and negative for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were eligible. Participants were block randomised to receive one of six treatments by intramuscular injection twice, 28 days apart: 1 microgram (mcg) +/- CpG1018 (a toll-like receptor 9 agonist), 3 mcg +/- CpG1018, 10 mcg, or placebo. Participants and personnel assessing outcomes were masked to treatment. The primary outcomes were solicited and spontaneously reported adverse events (AEs) during 7 and 28 days after each vaccination, respectively. Secondary outcomes were immunogenicity measures (anti-S IgG and pseudotyped virus neutralisation). An interim analysis assessed safety at day 57 in treatment-exposed individuals and immunogenicity through day 43 per protocol. ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04764422). Between March 20 and April 23, 2021, 377 individuals were screened and 210 were enrolled (35 per group); all received dose one; five missed dose two. The most common solicited AEs among vaccinees, all predominantly mild, were injection site pain (<63%), fatigue (<35%), headache (<32%), and myalgia (<32%). The proportion reporting a vaccine-related AE ranged from 5.7% to 17.1% among vaccine groups and was 2.9% in controls; there was no vaccine-related serious adverse event. The immunogenicity of the 10 mcg formulation ranked best, followed by 3 mcg+CpG1018, 3 mcg, 1 mcg+CpG1018, and 1 mcg formulations. On day 43, the geometric mean concentrations of 50% neutralising antibody ranged from 122.23 IU/mL (1 mcg, 95% CI 86.40-172.91) to 474.35 IU/mL (10 mcg, 95% CI 320.90-701.19), with 93.9% to 100% of vaccine groups attaining a => 4-fold increase over baseline. NDV-HXP-S had an acceptable safety profile and potent immunogenicity. The 3 mcg and 3 mcg+CpG1018 formulations advanced to phase 2.","Innis, B. L.; Mercer, L. D.; White, J.

STUDY DESIGN: All 90 patients hospitalized between March 16 and April 30, 2003, were included. Epidemiological and clinical data were shared with the French National Institute for Health. Cases were classified according to both the official definition (“possible”, “probable”, “excluded”) and a local one, adapted from the official definition but including an additional level of suspicion (“equivocal”), intermediate between “possible” and “excluded”. RESULTS: The initial assessment was different in 39% of the cases (n = 35), according to epidemiological (n = 24) or clinical (n = 11) elements. The final assessment diverged in 54% of the cases (n = 47). All patients were officially considered as ""excluded"" for epidemiologists, while 47 remained as ""possible"" or ""equivocal"" cases of SARS according to the clinicians. CONCLUSION: The risk assessment was different in almost 40% of the cases, with no impact on epidemic diffusion or hospital-borne exposure as no probable case of SARS was diagnosed among these patients or their households. The confrontation of these different but complementary points of view will thus enrich the interdisciplinary management of eventual future outbreaks.","Cibrelus, L.; Nöel, V.; Emmanuelli, J.; Breton, G.; Longuet, P.; Rigolli, B.; Leport, C.; Vildé, J.-L.",Med Mal Infect,563,16

Currently, the USA, India, Brazil, and other parts of the world are experiencing a secondary wave of COVID-19. However, the medical, mathematical, and pharmaceutical aspects of its transmission, incubation, and recovery processes are still unclear. The classical susceptible–infected–recovered model has limitations in describing the dynamic behavior of COVID-19. Hence, it is necessary to introduce a recursive, latent model to predict the number of future COVID-19 infection cases in the USA. In this article, a dynamic recursive and latent infection model (RLIM) based on the classical SEIR model is proposed to predict the number of COVID-19 infections. Given COVID-19 infection and recovery data for a certain period, the RLIM is able to fit current values and produce an optimal set of parameters with a minimum error rate according to actual reported numbers. With these optimal parameters assigned, the RLIM model then becomes able to produce predictions of infection numbers within a certain period. To locate the turning point of COVID-19 transmission, an initial value for the secondary infection rate is given to the RLIM algorithm for calculation. RLIM will then calculate the secondary infection rates of a continuous time series with an iterative search strategy to speed up the convergence of the prediction outcomes and minimize the maximum square errors. Compared with other forecast algorithms, RLIM is able to adapt the COVID-19 infection curve faster and more accurately and, more importantly, provides a way to identify the turning point in virus transmission by searching for the equilibrium between recoveries and new infections. Simulations of four US states show that with the secondary infection rate [Formula: see text] initially set to 0.5 within the selected latent period of 14 days, RLIM is able to minimize this value at 0.07 and reach an equilibrium condition. A successful forecast is generated using New York state’s COVID-19 transmission, in which a turning point is predicted to emerge on January 31, 2021.

Especially in hematological malignancies, including lymphoma, the demands by this novel virus disease are further enhanced during sophisticated treatments, such as chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy. Here, we present the first case of a patient with refractory diffuse-large B-cell lymphoma, who underwent CAR T-cell treatment in the context of SARS-CoV-2. Irrespective of prolonged and active SARS-CoV-2 infection, T cells were successfully isolated by apheresis and processed to anti-CD19 CAR T cells (axicabtagene-ciloleucel). In light of the aggressive lymphoma course, lymphodepleting chemotherapy and CAR-T cells were administered in early recovery after oxygen-dependent CoVID-19 pneumonia. Except for moderate cytokine release, this cellular immunotherapy was well tolerated. Notably, there is no deterioration of the SARS-CoV-2 infection; however, complete lymphoma response and full clinical recovery were observed. In conclusion, CAR T-cell treatment in aggressive lymphoma in the setting of SARS-CoV-2 infection is feasible and may offer significant therapeutic activity in refractory disease.","Nilius-Eliliwi, Verena; Mika, Thomas; Baraniskin, Alexander; Wünnenberg, Max; Maslova, Marina; Boy, Christian; Klein-Scory, Susanne; Schroers, Roland; Vangala, Deepak",Front Oncol,563,1

It argues that women have to navigate moral blame when they have children with the condition. At the same time women refashion moral boundaries so that gendered norms around childhood and parenting for such children become suspended, in favour of creation of careful spaces. Parental fears of physical and sexual violence mean that gendered sexual norms are enforced for teenage boys as they are encouraged into early adulthood. In contrast, girls are kept in enforced ignorance about the consequences of sickle cell for reproduction and are encouraged to delay motherhood. This is because, as women relate, relationships and giving birth are fraught with embodied dangers and risks of violence.","Berghs, M.; Dyson, S.; Gabba, A.; Nyandemo, S.E.; Roberts, G.; Deen, G.",Soc Sci Med,563,1

We conducted a retrospective cohort study (PRECOVID Study) on all 4412 individuals with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in Aragon, Spain, and followed them for at least 30 days from cohort entry. We described the socio-demographic and clinical characteristics of all patients of the cohort. Age-adjusted logistic regressions models were performed to analyze the likelihood of mortality based on demographic and clinical variables. All analyses were stratified by sex. Old age, specific diseases such as diabetes, acute myocardial infarction, or congestive heart failure, and dispensation of drugs like vasodilators, antipsychotics, and potassium-sparing agents were associated with an increased likelihood of mortality. Our findings suggest that specific comorbidities, mainly of cardiovascular nature, and medications at the time of infection could explain around one quarter of the mortality in COVID-19 disease, and that women and men probably share similar but not identical risk factors. Nonetheless, the great part of mortality seems to be explained by other patient- and/or health-system-related factors.

All cases exhibited a rapidly penetrating “jet phase” followed by a slow “puff phase.” Immediate dilution of aerosols was prevented by vortex ring flow structures that concentrated particles toward the plume-front.

However, the mechanisms by which the rate of membrane synthesis is coupled with the rate of cell growth remain unresolved. By comparing substrate and enzyme concentrations of the fatty acid and phospholipid synthesis pathways of Escherichia coli across a 3-fold range of carbon-limited growth rates, we show that the rate of membrane phospholipid synthesis during steady-state growth is determined principally through allosteric control of a single enzyme, PlsB. Due to feedback regulation of the fatty acid pathway, PlsB activity also indirectly controls synthesis of lipopolysaccharide, a major component of the outer membrane synthesized from a fatty acid synthesis intermediate. Surprisingly, concentrations of the enzyme that catalyzes the committed step of lipopolysaccharide synthesis (LpxC) do not differ across steady-state growth conditions, suggesting that steady-state lipopolysaccharide synthesis is modulated primarily via indirect control by PlsB. In contrast to steady-state regulation, we found that responses to environmental perturbations are triggered directly via changes in acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA) concentrations, which enable rapid adaptation. Adaptations are further modulated by ppGpp, which regulates PlsB activity during slow growth and growth arrest. The strong reliance of the membrane synthesis pathway upon posttranslational regulation ensures both the reliability and the responsiveness of membrane synthesis.","Noga, Marek J.; Büke, Ferhat; van den Broek, Niels J.

To determine the accuracy of CXR diagnosis of COVID-19 compared with PCR in patients presenting with a clinical suspicion of COVID-19. METHODS AND MATERIALS: The CXR reports of 569 consecutive patients with a clinical suspicion of COVID-19 were reviewed, blinded to the PCR result and classified into the following categories: normal, indeterminate for COVID-19, classic/probable COVID-19, non-COVID-19 pathology, and not specified. Severity reporting and reporter expertise were documented. The subset of this cohort that had CXR and PCR within 3 days of each other were included for further analysis for diagnostic accuracy. RESULTS: Classic/probable COVID-19 was reported in 29% (166/569) of the initial cohort. 67% (382/569) had PCR tests. 344 patients had CXR and PCR within 3 days of each other.

There were also no differences in strength of turnover intentions. However, among the non-consumer providers emotional exhaustion was correlated with both types of turnover intention assessed in this study (intent to change job setting within the mental health field and intent to leave the mental health workforce), whereas among the peer providers emotional exhaustion was correlated only with intent to leave the mental health field.

The study eCoCo aims to gain insight into changes in interprofessional collaboration and clinical workflows resulting from introducing electronic patient records. METHODS: eCoCo is a multi-center case study integrating mixed methods from qualitative and quantitative social research. The case studies include three hospitals that undergo the process of introducing electronic patient records. Data are collected before and after the introduction of electronic patient records using participant observation, interviews, focus groups, time measurement, patient and employee questionnaires and a questionnaire to measure the level of digitalization. Furthermore, documents (patient records) as well as structural and administrative data are gathered. To analyze the interprofessional collaboration qualitative network analyses, reconstructive-hermeneutic analyses and document analyses are conducted. The workflow analyses, patient and employee assessment analyses and classification within the clinical adoption meta-model are conducted to provide insights into clinical workflows. DISCUSSION: This study will be the first to investigate the effects of introducing electronic patient records on interprofessional collaboration and clinical workflows from the perspective of healthcare professionals. Thereby, it will consider patients’ safety, legal and ethical concerns and quality of care. The results will help to understand the organization and thereby improve the performance of health services working with electronic patient records. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The study was registered at the German clinical trials register (DRKS00023343, Pre-Results) on November 17, 2020.","Beckmann, Marina; Dittmer, Kerstin; Jaschke, Julia; Karbach, Ute; Köberlein-Neu, Juliane; Nocon, Maya; Rusniok, Carsten; Wurster, Florian; Pfaff, Holger",BMC health services research,563,26

The gastrointestinal tract (GIT) is often the primary site of infection due to the faecal-oral route of transmission and the high risk of exposure to contaminated water, food or soil when travelling to these regions. Whilst current microbiologic techniques are far more sensitive than histology in detecting infectious pathogens, the histopathologist nonetheless retains a pivotal role in diagnosing tropical GIT disease. This role entails evaluating endoscopic biopsies for any characteristic inflammatory pattern, identifying pathogens which may be present and excluding other look-alike pathologies. Recent advances in commercially available diagnostic modalities, including molecular techniques, have further broadened the scope of the histopathologist’s armamentarium. This review outlines a practical pattern-based approach to diagnosing tropical GIT infections in endoscopic material, so as to assist pathologists less familiar with this spectrum of pathology.","Slavik, Tomas; Lauwers, Gregory Y.",Virchows Arch,563,1

There is a paucity of information about the attitudes of cancer patients towards vaccinations and the role of clinical oncologists in influencing vaccination acceptance. (2) Methods: Cancer patients and caregivers were invited to participate in a webinar and two surveys (pre- and post-webinar) assessing intention and thought processes associated with receiving COVID-19 vaccines. (3) Results: Two hundred and sixty-four participants participated in the webinar and registered to take at least one survey. Participants reported receiving most of their COVID-19 vaccine information from their doctor, clinic, or hospital. Before the webinar, 71% of participants reported the intention to receive a COVID-19 vaccine, 24% were unsure, and 5% had no intention of receiving a vaccine. The strongest predictors of vaccine enthusiasm were (a) planning to encourage the vaccination of family, friends, co-workers, and community, and (b) physician recommendation. The chief reason for vaccine hesitancy was a fear of side effects. After the webinar, 82.5% reported the intention to receive a vaccine, 15.4% were still unsure, and 2% stated that they had no intention of receiving a vaccine. The webinar shifted the attitude towards vaccine enthusiasm, despite an already vaccine-enthusiastic population. Communicating about vaccines using positive framing is associated with greater vaccine enthusiasm. (4) Conclusions: Patient education programs co-hosted by multiple stakeholders and delivered by oncologists can increase cancer patient enthusiasm for COVID-19 vaccination.","Kelkar, Amar H.; Blake, Jodian A.; Cherabuddi, Kartikeya; Cornett, Hailee; McKee, Bobbie L.; Cogle, Christopher R.",Healthcare (Basel),563,1

This study aimed to longitudinally explore whether mothers’ self‐compassion was associated with mother–infant bonding and whether this relationship was mediated by mindful parenting and parenting stress. A total of 125 Portuguese mothers of infants aged between 0 and 12 months completed an online survey at two assessment points during the first wave of the COVID‐19 pandemic (T1: April–May 2020; T2: June–July 2020). The survey included several questionnaires assessing sociodemographic, clinical, and COVID‐19 information; self‐compassion; mindful parenting; parenting stress; and mother–infant bonding. Mothers presented significantly higher levels of self‐compassion, less impaired mother–infant bonding, and lower levels of depressive symptoms at T2 than T1. Higher levels of self‐compassion at T1 predicted less impaired mother–infant bonding at T2, and this relationship was mediated by higher levels of mindful parenting and lower levels of parenting stress (both assessed at T1). These results highlight the relevance of mothers’ self‐compassion to establishing mother–infant bonding in the postpartum period, particularly during the COVID‐19 pandemic, and the important role of mindful parenting and parenting stress in determining this relationship.","Fernandes, Daniela V.; Canavarro, Maria C.; Moreira, Helena",Infant Ment Health J,563,33

During highly infectious outbreaks, acute resuscitation scenarios may also increase the risk of insufficient personal protective equipment (PPE) use by health care workers (HCWs). Simulation was used as an educational tool to measure adherence with PPE use and pediatric resuscitation guidelines during simulated cardiopulmonary arrests of 2009 influenza A patients. METHODS: A retrospective, observational study was performed of 84 HCWs participating in 11 in situ simulations in June 2009. Assessment included (1) PPE adherence, (2) confidence in PPE use, (3) elapsed time to specific resuscitation maneuvers, and (4) deviation from AHA guidelines. RESULTS: Observed adherence with PPE use was 61% for eye shields, 81% for filtering facepiece respirators or powered air-purifying respirators, and 87% for gown/gloves. Use of a “gatekeeper” to control access and facilitate donning of PPE was associated with 100% adherence with gown and respirator precautions and improved respirator adherence. All simulations showed deviation from pediatric basic life support protocols. The median time to bag-valve-mask ventilation improved from 4.3 to 2.7 minutes with a gatekeeper present. Rapid isolation carts appeared to improve access to necessary PPE. Confidence in PPE use improved from 64% to 85% after the mock code and structured debriefing. CONCLUSIONS: Large gaps exist in the use of PPE and self-protective behaviors, as well as adherence to resuscitation guidelines, during simulated resuscitation events. Intervention opportunities include use of rapid isolation measures, use of gatekeepers, reinforcement of first responder roles, and further simulation training with PPE.","Watson, Christopher M.; Duval-Arnould, Jordan M.; McCrory, Michael C.; Froz, Stephan; Connors, Cheryl; Perl, Trish M.; Hunt, Elizabeth A.",Jt Comm J Qual Patient Saf,563,24

These molecules must have low toxicity, specific activity and high bioavailability. The most suitable compounds for this task are usually derived from natural sources (animal, plant or even microbial). In this review article, the latest and most promising natural compounds used to combat bacteria, filamentous fungi and viruses are presented and evaluated. These include plant extracts, essential oils, small antimicrobial peptides of animal origin, bacteriocins and various groups of plant compounds (triterpenoids; alkaloids; phenols; flavonoids) with antimicrobial and antiviral activity. Data are presented on the inhibitory activity of each natural antimicrobial substance and on the putative mechanism of action against bacterial and fungal strains. The results show that among the bioactive compounds studied, triterpenoids have significant inhibitory activity against coronaviruses, but flavonoids have also been shown to inhibit SARS-COV-2. The last chapter is devoted to nanocarriers used to improve stability, bioavailability, cellular uptake/internalization, pharmacokinetic profile and reduce toxicity of natural compunds. There are a number of nanocarriers such as liposomes, drug delivery microemulsion systems, nanocapsules, solid lipid nanoparticles, polymeric micelles, dendrimers, etc. However, some of the recent studies have focused on the incorporation of natural substances with antimicrobial/antiviral activity into polymeric nanoparticles, niosomes and silver nanoparticles (which have been shown to have intrinsic antimicrobial activity). The natural antimicrobials isolated from animals and microorganisms have been shown to have good inhibitory effect on a range of pathogens, however the plants remain the most prolific source. Even if the majority of the studies for the biological activity evaluation are in silico or in vitro, their internalization in the optimum nanocarriers represents the future of “green therapeutics” as shown by some of the recent work in the field.","Stan, Diana; Enciu, Ana-Maria; Mateescu, Andreea Lorena; Ion, Andreea Cristina; Brezeanu, Ariana Cristina; Stan, Dana; Tanase, Cristiana",Front Pharmacol,563,13

Bacterial co-infection and secondary infection rarely affected patients with COVID-19 in Japan, and the isolated pathogens were not specific to these patients. Moreover, the anti-inflammatory effects of macrolides for COVID-19 were not observed in several studies.

SEMs typically represent counts of individuals in discrete infection states using Markov jump processes (MJPs), but are computationally challenging as imperfect surveillance, lack of subject-level information, and temporal coarseness of the data obscure the true epidemic. Analytic integration over the latent epidemic process is impossible, and integration via Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) is cumbersome due to the dimensionality and discreteness of the latent state space. Simulation-based computational approaches can address the intractability of the MJP likelihood, but are numerically fragile and prohibitively expensive for complex models. A linear noise approximation (LNA) that approximates the MJP transition density with a Gaussian density has been explored for analyzing prevalence data in large-population settings, but requires modification for analyzing incidence counts without assuming that the data are normally distributed. We demonstrate how to reparameterize SEMs to appropriately analyze incidence data, and fold the LNA into a data augmentation MCMC framework that outperforms deterministic methods, statistically, and simulation-based methods, computationally. Our framework is computationally robust when the model dynamics are complex and applies to a broad class of SEMs. We evaluate our method in simulations that reflect Ebola, influenza, and SARS-CoV-2 dynamics, and apply our method to national surveillance counts from the 2013-2015 West Africa Ebola outbreak.","Fintzi, Jonathan; Wakefield, Jon; Minin, Vladimir N",Biometrics,563,20
