In study, there are used methods of data bases constructing, web-technologies and virtual reality tools. Also, there are used Foresight technologies, theory of decision making under uncertainties and risk management. As digital tools, there is proposed to use digital online platforms, which integrate heterogeneous hardware and software resources with the use of web-technologies in distributed networks and wide application of cloud services. In study, there are used data bases and tools of geo-information digital online platform EOS, including its Land Viewer product. As study result, there is demonstrated usage of geo-information support system for Russian seaport Ust-Luga. The research results presented in this article has significant scientific novelty and can be useful for private investors, public environmental organizations of the civil sector and state environmental control bodies. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2021.","Abramov, V.; Lukyanov, S.; Korinets, E.; Bolshakov, V.; Vekshina, T.","2021 Ural Environmental Science Forum on Sustainable Development of Industrial Region, UESF 2021",908,29

This immunity can be due to vaccination or to the recovery post-disease. Effective herd immunity in SARS-CoV-2 infection has several hurdles upon achievement. Herd immunity cannot be obtained concomitantly in many geographical areas because the areas have different population density and the societal measures to contain the spreading are different. A proportion of 50-66% of the population needs to be immunized naturally or artificially in this SARS-Cov2 pandemic and this percentage is not easily achievable. The duration of herd immunity is another issue while information on the long-term immune response against SARS-CoV2 is yet scarce. Epitope stability, another issue to be solved when achieving herd immunity, is important. Mutation in the viral structure will call upon other sets of neutralizing antibodies and hence for other herd immunity type installment. The societal tactics to achieve the much-needed herd immunity should be developed keeping in mind the welfare of the population. Without being exhaustive, throughout our paper we will elaborate on each of the hurdles encountered in developing herd immunity to SARS-Cov2 infection.","Neagu, Monica",J Immunoassay Immunochem,908,5
