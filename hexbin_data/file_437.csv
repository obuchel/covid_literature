4321,4321,4321,CApecitabine plus Radium-223 (Xofigo™) in breast cancer patients with BONe metastases (CARBON): study protocol for a phase IB/IIA randomised controlled trial,20.820591,9.85212,2020-01-15,"BACKGROUND: A substantial proportion of breast cancer patients develop metastatic disease, with over 450,000 deaths globally per year. Bone is the most common first site of metastatic disease accounting for 40% of all first recurrence and 70% of patients with advanced disease develop skeletal involvement. Treatment of bone metastases currently focusses on symptom relief and prevention and treatment of skeletal complications. However, there remains a need for further treatment options for patients with bone metastases. Combining systemic therapy with a bone-targeted agent, such as radium-223, may provide an effective treatment with minimal additional side effects. METHODS/DESIGN: CARBON is a UK-based, open-label, multi-centre study which comprises an initial safety phase to establish the feasibility and safety of combining radium-223 given on a 6-weekly schedule in combination with orally administered capecitabine followed by a randomised extension phase to further characterise the safety profile and provide preliminary estimation of efficacy. DISCUSSION: The CARBON study is important as the results will be the first to assess radium-223 with chemotherapy in advanced breast cancer. If the results find acceptable rates of toxicity with a decrease in bone turnover markers, further work will be necessary in a phase II/III setting to assess the efficacy and clinical benefit.

In such a problem, a company constantly uses one vehicle to fulfill demand over a scheduling period of several work shifts. In our case, a crew executes maintenance jobs in different sites. The working team runs during different work shifts, but recurrently returns to the depot by the end of the shift (overtime avoidance). The goal consists in minimizing the number of work shifts (makespan). We observe the impact of uncertainty in travel and maintenance processing time on the overtime avoidance constraint. We realize an Artificial Immune Heuristic to get optimal solutions considering both makespan and overtime avoidance. First, we present a Pareto-based framework to evaluate the uncertainty influence. Then, we show a numerical real case study to survey the problem. In particular, a case study scenario has been created on the basis of the environmental changes in travel and processing times observed in Italy during the Covid-19 lockdown period (started on March 9, 2020).

Given the availability of various screening modalities, there is critical need for culturally relevant interventions addressing multiple socioecological levels to reduce the regional CRC burden. In this report, we describe the development and baseline findings from year 1 of ""Accelerating Colorectal Cancer Screening through Implementation Science (ACCSIS) in Appalachia,"" a 5-year, National Cancer Institute Cancer MoonshotSM-funded multilevel intervention (MLI) project to increase screening in Appalachian Kentucky and Ohio primary care clinics. METHODS Project development was theory-driven and included the establishment of both an external Scientific Advisory Board and a Community Advisory Board to provide guidance in conducting formative activities in two Appalachian counties: one in Kentucky and one in Ohio. Activities included identifying and describing the study communities and primary care clinics, selecting appropriate evidence-based interventions (EBIs), and conducting a pilot test of MLI strategies addressing patient, provider, clinic, and community needs. RESULTS Key informant interviews identified multiple barriers to CRC screening, including fear of screening, test results, and financial concerns (patient level); lack of time and competing priorities (provider level); lack of reminder or tracking systems and staff burden (clinic level); and cultural issues, societal norms, and transportation (community level). With this information, investigators then offered clinics a menu of EBIs and strategies to address barriers at each level. Clinics selected individually tailored MLIs, including improvement of patient education materials, provision of provider education (resulting in increased knowledge, p = .003), enhancement of electronic health record (EHR) systems and development of clinic screening protocols, and implementation of community CRC awareness events, all of which promoted stool-based screening (i.e., FIT or FIT-DNA). Variability among clinics, including differences in EHR systems, was the most salient barrier to EBI implementation, particularly in terms of tracking follow-up of positive screening results, whereas the development of clinic-wide screening protocols was found to promote fidelity to EBI components. CONCLUSIONS Lessons learned from year 1 included increased recognition of variability among the clinics and how they function, appreciation for clinic staff and provider workload, and development of strategies to utilize EHR systems. These findings necessitated a modification of study design for subsequent years.

We have introduced the technique using a Penrose drain to suspend the liver with the performance of laparoscopic gastrectomy for gastric adenocarcinoma. METHODS 111 patients with gastric adenocarcinoma underwent laparoscopic gastrectomy using either a Penrose drain (n = 47) or a Nathanson's retractor (n = 64) for displacement of the liver. Serum levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), total bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and albumin were compared among the groups at baseline, immediately after operation, and on postoperative days (POD) 1, 2, 3, 5, and 7. RESULTS The levels of ALT on POD 2, 3, and 5 were significant higher in the Nathanson's retractor group than in the Penrose drain group. Levels of AST on POD 2 and 3 were also higher in the Nathanson's retractor group than in the Penrose drain group. There was no significant difference in total bilirubin, ALP, and serum albumin levels between groups. CONCLUSIONS The use of the Penrose drain for retraction of the liver appears to attenuate postoperative liver dysfunction during laparoscopic gastrectomy for gastric adenocarcinoma.","Shinohara, Toshihiko; Kanaya, Seiichiro; Yoshimura, Fumihiro; Hiramatsu, Yoshihiro; Haruta, Shusuke; Kawamura, Yuichiro; Giacopuzzi, Simone; Fujita, Tetsuji; Uyama, Ichiro",Journal of gastrointestinal surgery : official journal of the Society for Surgery of the Alimentary Tract,437,28

PROCEDURE Nine focus groups (21 mothers; 11 fathers) were performed across Sweden in 2015 and 2019. A deductive content analysis approach was used. A preconstructed matrix consisting of 12 codes based on previous literature was used to organize the data. The codes were grouped into subcategories, which were abstracted to four generic categories. RESULTS Facilitators for a return to work were covered in the category ""Flexibility and understanding from employers and social services,"" and barriers in the category ""Pressure to return without consideration of the consequences."" Facilitators to meeting financial needs were covered in the category ""Available public, private, and employer support,"" and barriers in the category ""Lack of organized and efficient support from employers and social services."" CONCLUSIONS The identified barriers suggest that there is room for improvement in the provision of psychosocial support, which relates to a perceived lack of organized support regarding practical, financial, and occupational matters. The results show a need for a coordinated support system that includes major stakeholders, such as the health care, welfare agencies, and employers. Moreover, employers should consider how to implement more workplace flexibility and involvement of occupational health services. Importantly, to be able to return to work and achieve a sustainable financial situation, it is necessary for all stakeholders to recognize the long-term impact of parenting a child with cancer.","Hjelmstedt, Sofia; Forinder, Ulla; Montgomery, Scott; Lindahl Norberg, Annika; Hovén, Emma",Pediatric blood & cancer,437,8

The impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on VAE rates and characteristics is unknown. OBJECTIVES To compare the incidence, causes, and outcomes of VAE during the Covid-19 pandemic year vs pre-pandemic years and amongst ventilated patients with and without Covid-19. METHODS In this retrospective cohort study of mechanically ventilated adults at four academic and community hospitals in Massachusetts, we compared VAE incidence rates between March 1-August 31 for each of 2017-2020 (corresponding to the timeframe of the pandemic first wave in 2020) and among Covid-19 positive and negative patients in 2020. The medical records of 200 randomly selected patients with VAEs in 2020 (100 with Covid-19, 100 without) were analyzed to compare conditions precipitating VAEs in patients with vs without Covid-19. RESULTS VAEs per 100 episodes of mechanical ventilation were more common in 2020 vs prior years (11.2 vs 6.7, p<.01) but the rate of VAEs per 1000 ventilator-days was similar (14.2 vs 12.7, p=.08). VAEs were more frequent in Covid-19 positive vs negative patients within 2020 (29.0 vs. 7.1 per 100 ventilator episodes, p<.01 and 17.2 vs 12.2 per 1000 ventilator days, p<.01). Compared to non-Covid-19 patients with VAEs, Covid-19 patients with VAEs had similar rates of infection-related ventilator-associated complications, longer median duration of mechanical ventilation (22 vs 14 days, p<.01), and similar in-hospital mortality (30% vs 38%, p=.15). Progressive ARDS accounted for 53% of VAEs in Covid-19 patients versus 14% amongst non-Covid-19 patients. CONCLUSIONS VAE rates per 100 episodes of mechanical ventilation and per 1000 ventilator days were higher amongst Covid-19 positive versus negative patients. Over 50% of VAEs in Covid-19 patients were caused by progressive ARDS versus less than 15% in patients without Covid-19. These findings provide insight into the natural history of Covid-19 in ventilated patients and may inform targeted strategies to mitigate complications in this population.","Weinberger, Jeremy; Rhee, Chanu; Klompas, Michael",Annals of the American Thoracic Society,437,2

MATERIALS AND METHODS Between May 2013 and October 2015, five patients underwent percutaneous retrieval of five iatrogenic FBs, including a biopsy needle tip in the femoral head following osteoblastoma biopsy and radiofrequency ablation (RFA); a co-axial needle shaft within a giant desmoid tumour following cryoablation; and three post-vertebroplasty cement tails within paraspinal muscles. All FBs were retrieved immediately following original procedures under local or general anaesthesia, using combined computed tomography (CT) and fluoroscopic guidance. The basic technique involved positioning a 6G trocar sleeve around the FB long axis and co-axially advancing an 8G biopsy needle to retrieve the FB within the biopsy core. Retrospective chart review facilitated analysis of procedures, FBs, technical success, and complications. RESULTS Mean FB size was 23 mm (range 8-74 mm). Four FBs were located within 10 mm of non-vascular significant anatomic structures. The basic technique was successful in 3 cases; 2 cases required technical modifications including using a stiff guide-wire to facilitate retrieval in the case of the post-cryoablation FB; and using the central mandrin of the 6G trocar to push a cement tract back into an augmented vertebra when initial retrieval failed. Overall technical success (FB retrieval or removal to non-hazardous location) was 100 %, with no complications. CONCLUSION Percutaneous image-guided retrieval of iatrogenic FBs using a large-bore biopsy system is a feasible, safe, effective, and versatile technique, with potential advantages over existing methods.","Cazzato, Roberto Luigi; Garnon, Julien; Ramamurthy, Nitin; Tsoumakidou, Georgia; Caudrelier, Jean; Thénint, Marie-Aude; Rao, Pramod; Koch, Guillaume; Gangi, Afshin",Cardiovascular and interventional radiology,437,24

To assess the impact of the dissection room experience on one's willingness to become a whole body and organ donor, the attitudes of 1,350 students and professionals from the medical, health, and non-health related disciplines to body and organ donation were studied. The participants were broken into categories according to degree of exposure to human dissection. Participants who were never exposed to the dissection experience showed more willingness to donate their bodies than those who were exposed. With the exception of the physiotherapy department, the students and professionals from the health science departments who were exposed to the dissection room but never engaged in dissection showed the most unwillingness to donate their bodies (P < 0.001). An unwillingness to donate oneself was noted as one of the negative impacts associated with exposure to the dissection room. Willingness to donate an organ correlated positively with the level of exposure to the dissection room (P < 0.001). Most of the reasons for unwillingness were traceable to negative perceptions of the dissection room as a result of poor and disrespectful management of the human cadavers.","Anyanwu, Emeka G; Obikili, Emmanuel N; Agu, Augustine U",Anatomical sciences education,437,28

The disease usually manifests with ataxia, but previous reports suggested PRKCG variants in retinal pathology. To systematically investigate for the first time visual function and retinal morphology in patients with SCA-PRKCG. Seventeen patients with PRKCG variants and 17 healthy controls were prospectively recruited, of which 12 genetically confirmed SCA-PRKCG patients and 14 matched controls were analyzed. We enquired a structured history for visual symptoms. Vision-related quality of life was obtained with the National Eye Institute Visual Function Questionnaire (NEI-VFQ) including the Neuro-Ophthalmic Supplement (NOS). Participants underwent testing of visual acuity, contrast sensitivity, visual fields, and retinal morphology with optical coherence tomography (OCT). Measurements of the SCA-PRKCG group were analyzed for their association with clinical parameters (ataxia rating and disease duration). SCA-PRKCG patients rate their vision-related quality of life in NEI-VFQ significantly worse than controls. Furthermore, binocular visual acuity and contrast sensitivity were worse in SCA-PRKCG patients compared with controls. Despite this, none of the OCT measurements differed between groups. NEI-VFQ and NOS composite scores were related to ataxia severity. Additionally, we describe one patient with a genetic variant of uncertain significance in the catalytic domain of PKCγ who, unlike all confirmed SCA-PRKCG, presented with a clinically silent epitheliopathy.

Recommendations for treatment of patients with symptoms due to severe valvular disease are based on a foundation of solid evidence. However, when to intervene in asymptomatic patients remains controversial and decision requires careful individual weighing of the potential benefits against the risk of intervention and its long-term consequences. The primary rationale for earlier intervention is prevention of irreversible left ventricular (LV) myocardial changes that might result in later clinical symptoms and adverse cardiac events. A number of outcome predictors have been identified that facilitate decision-making. This review summarizes current recommendations and discusses recently published data that challenge them suggesting even earlier intervention. In adults with asymptomatic aortic stenosis (AS), emerging risk markers include very severe valve obstruction, elevated serum natriuretic peptide levels, and imaging evidence of myocardial fibrosis or increased extracellular myocardial volume. Currently, transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is not recommended for treatment of asymptomatic severe AS although this may change in the future. In patients with aortic regurgitation (AR), the potential benefit of early intervention in preventing LV dilation and dysfunction must be balanced against the long-term risk of a prosthetic valve, a particular concern because severe AR often occurs in younger patients with a congenital bicuspid valve. In patients with mitral stenosis, the option of transcatheter mitral balloon valvotomy tilts the balance towards earlier intervention to prevent atrial fibrillation, embolic events, and pulmonary hypertension. When chronic severe mitral regurgitation is due to mitral valve prolapse, anatomic features consistent with a high likelihood of a successful and durable valve repair favour early intervention. The optimal timing of intervention in adults with VHD is a constantly changing threshold that depends not only on the severity of valve disease but also on the safety, efficacy, and long-term durability of our treatment options.","Baumgartner, Helmut; Iung, Bernard; Otto, Catherine M",European heart journal,437,16

Because of high mutation and recombination rates, genome replication by viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases leads to populations of closely related viruses, so-called ""quasispecies."" Standard (short-read) sequencing technologies are ill-suited to reconstruct large numbers of full-length haplotypes of (1) RNA virus genomes and (2) subgenome-length (sg) RNAs composed of noncontiguous genome regions. Here, we used a full-length, direct RNA sequencing (DRS) approach based on nanopores to characterize viral RNAs produced in cells infected with a human coronavirus. By using DRS, we were able to map the longest (∼26-kb) contiguous read to the viral reference genome. By combining Illumina and Oxford Nanopore sequencing, we reconstructed a highly accurate consensus sequence of the human coronavirus (HCoV)-229E genome (27.3 kb). Furthermore, by using long reads that did not require an assembly step, we were able to identify, in infected cells, diverse and novel HCoV-229E sg RNAs that remain to be characterized. Also, the DRS approach, which circumvents reverse transcription and amplification of RNA, allowed us to detect methylation sites in viral RNAs. Our work paves the way for haplotype-based analyses of viral quasispecies by showing the feasibility of intra-sample haplotype separation. Even though several technical challenges remain to be addressed to exploit the potential of the nanopore technology fully, our work illustrates that DRS may significantly advance genomic studies of complex virus populations, including predictions on long-range interactions in individual full-length viral RNA haplotypes.","Viehweger, Adrian; Krautwurst, Sebastian; Lamkiewicz, Kevin; Madhugiri, Ramakanth; Ziebuhr, John; Hölzer, Martin; Marz, Manja",Genome research,437,20

We tested residual donor plasma minipools (MPs) to determine SARS-CoV-2 RNAemia prevalence in six United States areas. STUDY DESIGN/METHODS Blood donations collected from 7 March 2020 to 25 September 2020 were tested for SARS-CoV-2 RNA (vRNA) in MP of 6 or 16 donations using the Grifols Procleix SARS-CoV-2 research-use only (RUO) transcription-mediated amplification (TMA) assay. Reactive results were confirmed using an alternate target region TMA assay. Reactive MPs were tested by TMA after serial dilution to estimate viral load. Testing for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and infectivity was performed. RESULTS A total of 17,995 MPs corresponding to approximately 258,000 donations were tested for vRNA. Three confirmed reactive MP16 were identified. The estimated prevalence of vRNA reactive donations was 1.16/100,000 (95% CI 0.40, 3.42). The vRNA-reactive samples were non-reactive for antibody, and the estimated viral loads of the (presumed single) positive donations within each MP ranged from <1000 to <4000 copies/ml. When tested, no infectivity was observed in inoculated permissive cell cultures. DISCUSSION Blood donation MP-nucleic acid testing (NAT) indicated that SARS-CoV-2 RNAemia is infrequent and, when detected, the vRNA was at low concentrations. Only one RNA-reactive MP could be tested for infectivity for operational reasons and was not infectious in cell culture.

Using an array of horizontally oriented cylinders, one of which was equipped with force sensors, and a motion capture system, we found snakes generated substantial propulsive force and propulsive impulse with minimal contribution from lateral undulation. Additional tests showed that snakes could propel themselves via vertical undulations from a single suitable contact point, and this mechanism was replicated in a robotic model.

In this paper, we present a new study on risk and resilience on adolescents during COVID-19, bookended - in introductory and concluding discussions - by descriptions of programmatic work anchored in lessons learned from Zigler. The new study was conducted during the first two months of the pandemic, using a mixed-methods approach with a sample of over 2,000 students across five high schools. Overall, rates of clinically significant symptoms were generally lower as compared to norms documented in 2019. Multivariate regressions showed that the most robust, unique associations with teens' distress were with feelings of stress around parents and support received from them. Open ended responses to three questions highlighted concerns about schoolwork and college, but equally, emphasized worries about families' well-being, and positive outreach from school adults. The findings have recurred across subsequent school assessments, and strongly resonate with contemporary perspectives on resilience in science and policy. If serious distress is to be averted among youth under high stress, interventions must attend not just to the children's mental health but that of salient caregiving adults at home and school. The article concludes with some specific recommendations for community-based initiatives to address mental health through continued uncertainties of the pandemic.","Luthar, Suniya S; Ebbert, Ashley M; Kumar, Nina L",Development and psychopathology,437,16

However, disparities exist between evidence-based recommendations and clinical practice. Research that quantifies the real-world effect of COPD regimen alignment with the GOLD recommendations on clinical and economic outcomes is needed. OBJECTIVE: To compare COPD-related health care resource utilization (HRU) and costs, as well as exacerbation rates, among patients with COPD on maintenance therapy based on 2017 GOLD treatment recommendation compliance status per GOLD ABCD risk group classification in a U.S. commercially insured/Medicare Advantage population. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study utilized administrative claims data in the HealthCore Integrated Research Database. The COPD population was identified using a previously validated claims-based predictive model. Among this population, patients with ≥ 1 claim for a COPD maintenance medication (earliest maintenance fill-date = index date) between January 1, 2014, and March 31, 2017, were identified. Patients were required to be aged ≥ 40 years, have ≥ 12 months of pre-index and ≥ 30 days of post-index health plan enrollment, with no diagnosis for asthma, cystic fibrosis, and/or lung cancer at any time from January 1, 2013, to March 31, 2018. Patients were categorized into exacerbation risk/symptomatology groups according to the 2017 GOLD ABCD assessment recommendations and were then classified into treatment-compliance status based on their maintenance therapy. Multivariable analyses were conducted to examine post-index COPD-related HRU, costs, and exacerbations by compliance status. RESULTS: The primary analytical study sample included 38,382 patients in the GOLD A/B group and 6,525 in the GOLD C/D group. Patients were further categorized into GOLD A (n = 19,345), B (n = 19,037), C (n = 1,865), and D (n = 4,670). GOLD-compliant regimens were observed in 32.9% of patients in the GOLD A/B group and in 58.9% of patients in the GOLD C/D group. Inhaled corticosteroid-containing regimens were the most commonly observed noncompliant regimen. Patients on compliant regimens had significantly fewer COPD-related inpatient and emergency department visits and therefore had significantly lower COPD-related medical costs in both the GOLD A/B and C/D cohorts. Similar results were observed for individual GOLD cohorts B, C, and D. These savings were offset by increased pharmacy expenditures. Being on GOLD guideline-compliant regimens significantly reduced the risk of exacerbation by 8% (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.92; P < 0.0001) in the GOLD A/B cohort and by 12% (HR = 0.88; P = 0.0005) in the GOLD C/D cohort, and was also associated with a significantly reduced exacerbation rate in the GOLD A/B (rate ratio [RR] = 0.93; P < 0.0001) and GOLD C/D (RR = 0.93; P = 0.0129) groups. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests a continuing trend of high prevalence of suboptimal prescriber compliance to GOLD treatment recommendations. Treatment regimens compliant with GOLD recommendations were associated with improvement in exacerbations, reduced COPD-related HRU, and COPD-related medical cost offsets.

A large proportion of patients with COVID-19 requiring hospitalization and/or succumbing to the disease have had diabetes and other chronic conditions as underlying risk factors. In particular, individuals belonging to racial/ethnic minorities in the U.S. and other countries have been significantly and disproportionately impacted. Multiple and complex socioeconomic factors have long played a role in increasing the risk for diabetes and now for COVID-19. Since the pandemic began, the global healthcare community has accumulated invaluable clinical experience on providing diabetes care in the setting of COVID-19. In addition, understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms that link these two diseases is being developed. The current clinical management of diabetes is a work in progress, requiring a shift in patient-provider interaction beyond the walls of clinics and hospitals: the use of tele-medicine when feasible, innovative patient education programs, strategies to ensure medication and glucose testing availability and affordability, as well as numerous ideas on how to improve meal plans and physical activity.

In this work, we propose the use of pattern recognition and machine learning techniques to evaluate if a given animal EGC image was obtained from a healthy individual or one affect by a chronic degenerative disease. In the proposed approach, we have performed the classification task with handcrafted features and deep learning based techniques, also known as non-handcrafted features. The handcrafted features were obtained from the textural content of the ECG images using texture descriptors, such as the Local Binary Pattern (LBP). Moreover, the representation learning techniques employed in the approach are based on different Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures, such as AlexNet and VGG16, with and without transfer learning. The complementarity between the handcrafted and non-handcrafted features was also evaluated with late fusion techniques. The datasets of EGC images used in the experiments, which are also contributions of this paper, are composed of three different chronic degenerative diseases: Cancer, Diabetes Mellitus, and Rheumatoid Arthritis.

Design Parametric and non-parametric correlation coefficients are calculated to quantify the relationship between humidity and influenza, using five years of weekly data. Bayesian spatio-temporal models—with a Poisson and a Gaussian likelihood—are estimated to find the relationship between regional humidity and the daily cases of SARS-CoV-2 in the municipalities and provinces of the Netherlands. Results An inverse (negative) relationship is observed between specific humidity and the incidence of influenza between 2015 and 2019. The space-time analysis indicates that an increase of specific humidity of one gram of water vapor per kilogram of air (1 g/kg) is related to a reduction of approximately 5% in the risk of COVID-19 infections. Conclusions The increase in humidity during the outbreak of the SARS-CoV-2 in the Netherlands may have helped to reduce the risk of regional COVID-19 infections.

The virus knowledge is limited and especially about COVID-2019 pathogenesis. The Open Reading Frame 1ab (ORF1ab) of COVID-2019 has been analyzed to evidence the presence of mutation caused by selective pressure on the virus. For selective pressure analysis fast-unconstrained Bayesian approximation (FUBAR) was used. Homology modelling has been performed by SwissModel and HHPred servers. The presence of transmembrane helical segments in Coronavirus ORF1ab non structural protein 2 (nsp2) and nsp3 was tested by TMHMM, MEMSAT, and MEMPACK tools. Three-dimensional structures have been analyzed and displayed using PyMOL. FUBAR analysis revealed the presence of potential sites under positive selective pressure (P < .05). Position 723 in the COVID-2019 has a serine instead a glycine residue, while at aminoacidic position 1010 a proline instead an isoleucine. Significant (P < .05) pervasive negative selection in 2416 sites (55%) was found. The positive selective pressure could account for some clinical features of this virus compared with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Bat SARS-like CoV. The stabilizing mutation falling in the endosome-associated-protein-like domain of the nsp2 protein could account for COVID-2019 high ability of contagious, while the destabilizing mutation in nsp3 proteins could suggest a potential mechanism differentiating COVID-2019 from SARS. These data could be helpful for further investigation aimed to identify potential therapeutic targets or vaccine strategy, especially in the actual moment when the epidemic is ongoing and the scientific community is trying to enrich knowledge about this new viral pathogen.","Angeletti, Silvia; Benvenuto, Domenico; Bianchi, Martina; Giovanetti, Marta; Pascarella, Stefano; Ciccozzi, Massimo",J Med Virol,437,24

Humans evolved by losing the capacity to synthesize the glycan Gal&#945;1-3Galß1-(3)4GlcNAc-R (&#945;-Gal), which resulted in the development of a protective response against pathogenic viruses and other microorganisms containing this modification on membrane proteins mediated by anti-&#945;-Gal immunoglobulin M (IgM)/IgG antibodies produced in response to bacterial microbiota.

One specific application is to monitor compliance of website and social media activity with respect to jurisdictional regulations. These data may then identify breaches of compliance and inform disciplinary actions. Our study aimed to evaluate the novel use of internet analytics by a Canadian chiropractic regulator to determine their registrants compliance with three regulations related to specific health conditions, pregnancy conditions and most recently, claims of improved immunity during the COVID-19 crisis. METHODS: A customized internet search tool (Market Review Tool, MRT) was used by the College of Chiropractors of British Columbia (CCBC), Canada to audit registrants websites and social media activity. The audits extracted words whose use within specific contexts is not permitted under CCBC guidelines. The MRT was first used in October of 2018 to identify words related to specific health conditions. The MRT was again used in December 2019 for words related to pregnancy and most recently in March 2020 for words related to COVID-19. In these three MRT applications, potential cases of word misuse were evaluated by the regulator who then notified the practitioner to comply with existing regulations by a specific date. The MRT was then used on that date to determine compliance. Those found to be non-compliant were referred to the regulator's inquiry committee. We mapped this process and reported the outcomes with permission of the regulator. RESULTS: In September 2018, 250 inappropriate mentions of specific health conditions were detected from approximately 1250 registrants with 2 failing to comply. The second scan for pregnancy related terms of approximately1350 practitioners revealed 83 inappropriate mentions. Following notification, all 83 cases were compliant within the specified timeframe. Regarding COVID-19 related words, 97 inappropriate mentions of the word ""immune"" were detected from 1350 registrants with 7 cases of non-compliance. CONCLUSION: Internet analytics are an effective way for regulators to monitor internet activity to protect the public from misleading statements. The processes described were effective at bringing about rapid practitioner compliance. Given the increasing volume of internet activity by healthcare professionals, internet analytics are an important addition for health care regulators to protect the public they serve.","Kawchuk, Greg; Hartvigsen, Jan; Innes, Stan; Simpson, J Keith; Gushaty, Brian",Chiropr Man Therap,437,1

From healthcare decision making to social media censoring, these agents face problems and make decisions that have ethical and societal implications. Hence, ethical behaviour is a critical characteristic of a human-centric AI. A common observation in human-centric industries, like the service industry and healthcare, is that their professionals tend to break rules, if necessary, for pro-social reasons. To make AI agents more human-centric, we argue that there is a need for a mechanism that helps AI agents to identify when and how to break rules set by their designers. In this paper, we examine the when, i.e., conditions under which humans break rules for pro-social reasons. In the presented study, we introduce a 'vaccination strategy dilemma' where one needs to decide whether they would distribute Covid-19 vaccines only to members of a high-risk group (follow the rule) or, in selected cases, administer the vaccine to a few social influencers (break the rule), which might yield an overall greater benefit to society. Results of the empirical study suggest a relationship between stakeholder utilities and pro-social rule breaking (PSRB), which either deontological or utilitarian ethics cannot completely explain. Finally, the paper discusses the design characteristics of an ethical agent capable of PSRB and the future research directions on PSRB in the AI realm.","Ramanayake, Rajitha; Wicke, Philipp; Nallur, Vivek",,437,16

We will use GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence. STATISTICAL ANALYSES: Trial investigators will provide data on the numbers of participants who did and did not experience each outcome according to intervention group, overall and in specified subgroups. We will conduct fixed-effect (primary analysis) and random-effects (Paule-Mandel estimate of heterogeneity and Hartung-Knapp adjustment) meta-analyses. We will quantify inconsistency in effects between trials using I2 statistics. Evidence for subgroup effects will be quantified by ratios of odds ratios comparing effects in the subgroups, and corresponding interaction p-values. Comparisons between subgroups defined by trial characteristics will be made using random-effects meta-regression. Comparisons between subgroups defined by patient characteristics will be made by estimating trial-specific ratios of odds ratios comparing intervention effects between subgroups then combining these using random-effects meta-analysis. Steroid interventions will be classified as high or low dose according to whether the dose is greater or less than or equal to 400 mg hydrocortisone per day or equivalent. We will use network meta-analysis methods to make comparisons between the effects of high and low dose steroid interventions (because one trial randomized participants to both low and high dose steroid arms).

Compared to its predecessor SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 is more infective for being highly contagious and exhibiting tighter binding with host angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE-2). The entry of the virus into host cells is mediated by the interaction of its spike protein with hACE-2. Thus, a peptide that has a resemblance to hACE-2 but can overpower the spike protein-hACE-2 interaction will be a potential therapeutic to contain this virus. The non-interacting residues in the receptor-binding domain of hACE-2 have been mutated to generate a library of 136 new peptides. Out of this library, docking and virtual screening discover seven peptides that can exert a stronger interaction with the spike protein than hACE-2. A peptide derived from simultaneous mutation of all the non-interacting residues of hACE-2 yields almost three-fold stronger interaction than hACE-2 and thus turns out here to be the best peptide inhibitor of the novel coronavirus. The binding of the best peptide inhibitor with the spike protein is explored further by molecular dynamics, free energy, and principal component analysis, which demonstrate its efficacy compared to hACE-2. The delivery of the screened inhibitors with nanocarriers like metal-organic frameworks will be worthy of further consideration to boost their efficacy.","Panda, Saroj Kumar; Sen Gupta, Parth Sarthi; Biswal, Satyaranjan; Ray, Abhik Kumar; Rana, Malay Kumar",J Proteome Res,437,26

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Materials and methods: Data collection was carried out by anonymous survey using the survio.com online survey service. The study involved 273 students of Kharkiv National Medical University: 47 men (17,2%) and 226 women (82,8%) aged 17 to 20. Age of 85% of respondents is 18-20 years old. 38 (13,9%) students are from 21 to 25 years old and 3 students (1,1%) - over 25 years old. RESULTS: Results: A comparative analysis revealed the characteristic changes in the students' lifestyle. If under normal conditions the majority of students (63.7%) use their free time for walks outdoors, and 46.5% spend it at the computer, then during quarantine most respondents spend leisure time in front of a computer monitor (64.8%) or watching TV (71.4%). These indices were the result of a direct restriction on the interaction of students with the environment and the prohibition of their stay outside the zone of residence. CONCLUSION: Conclusions: The most common negative changes of the students' health were sleep disturbances and headaches. The second most common symptoms are changes in the musculoskeletal system, associated mainly with physical inactivity. The third ones are deterioration of vision and psycho-emotional state of students.","Korobchansky, V. O.; Oliinyk, Y. O.; Nesterenko, V. G.; Sarkis-Ivanova, V. V.; Hryhorian, O.

Validation was performed on nasopharyngeal and sputum specimens (n=174) using newly designed dual-target rRT-PCR (altona RealStar SARS-CoV-2 Reagent) for detecting SARS-CoV-2 in upper respiratory (URT) and lower respiratory tract (LRT) specimens. Accuracy testing demonstrated excellent assay agreement between expected and observed values and comparable diagnostic performance to reference tests. The limit of detection (LOD) was 2.7 and 23.0 gene copies/reaction for nasopharyngeal and sputum specimens, respectively. Retrospective analysis of 1,694 URT specimens from 1,571 patients revealed increased positivity in older patients and males compared to females, and an increasing positivity rate from approximately 20% at the start of testing to 50% at the end of testing three weeks later.

METHODS: A prospective quality-improvement study was performed. RESULTS: The first step consisted in the design of a prototype within a multidisciplinary living lab approach using computer assisted design (CAD). Multiple trials of the device in various simulated clinical situations enabled us to further improve the prototype. The second step allowed for improvement of the prototype via in situ simulated sessions of patient transport, non-invasive ventilation, and intubations. Simulated training sessions were then organized for medical teams from the various departments involved. Reports were produced throughout and following each session to further refine the SplashGuard-CG design (figure). Finally, dissemination to larger audiences were done by video and in writing. The entire process was completed within a month. CONCLUSIONS: Thanks to a dynamic and interdisciplinary collaboration between healthcare professionals and engineers, the use of CAD, and in-situ simulations, the rapid and secure implementation of a new healthcare device, the SplashGuard-CG, was made possible in times of crisis.","Tabone, L.; François, T.; Lévy, A.; Alix-Seguin, L.; Toure, T.; Aubin, C.

A predominant theory is that the pathogenic FIPV arises from a mutation, so that it could replicate not only in enterocytes of the intestines but also in monocytes, subsequently systemically transporting the virus. The immune status and genetics of affected cats certainly play an important role in the pathogenesis. Considering the importance of genetics and host immune responses in viral infections, the goal of this study was to elucidate host gene expression in macrophages using RNA sequencing. Macrophages from healthy male cats infected with FIPV 79-1146 ex vivo displayed a differential host gene expression. Despite the virus uptake, aligned viral reads did not increase from 2 to 17 h. The overlap of host gene expression among macrophages from different cats was limited, even though viral transcripts were detected in the cells. Interestingly, some of the downregulated genes in all macrophages were involved in immune signaling, while some upregulated genes common for all cats were found to be inhibiting immune activation. Our results highlight individual host responses playing an important role, consistent with the fact that few cats develop feline infectious peritonitis despite a common presence of enteric FCoV.","Drechsler, Yvonne; Vasconcelos, Elton J R; Griggs, Lisa M; Diniz, Pedro P P V; Collisson, Ellen",,437,1

Although many DR approaches have been introduced for treating different diseases, only structure-based DR (SBDR) methods can be employed as the first therapeutic option against the COVID-19 pandemic because they rely on the rudimentary information about the diseases such as the sequence of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 genome. Hence, to try out new treatments for the disease, the first attempts have been made based on the SBDR methods which seem to be among the proper choices for discovering the potential medications against the emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases.

The fast progression of COVID-19 has been mainly related to the high contagion rate of the virus and the worldwide mobility of humans. In the absence of pharmacological therapies, governments from different countries have introduced several non-pharmaceutical interventions to reduce human mobility and social contact. Several studies based on Anonymised Mobile Phone Data have been published analysing the relationship between human mobility and the spread of coronavirus. However, to our knowledge, none of these data-sets integrates cross-referenced geo-localised data on human mobility and COVID-19 cases into one all-inclusive open resource.

The infection is caused by a coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 and clinically characterized by common symptoms including fever, dry cough, loss of taste/smell, myalgia and pneumonia in severe cases. With overwhelming spikes in infection and death, its pathogenesis yet remains elusive. Since the infection spread rapidly, its healthcare demands are overwhelming with uncontrollable emergencies. Although laboratory testing and analysis are developing at an enormous pace, the high momentum of severe cases demand more rapid strategies for initial screening and patient stratification. Several molecular biomarkers like C-reactive protein, interleukin-6 (IL6), eosinophils and cytokines, and artificial intelligence (AI) based screening approaches have been developed by various studies to assist this vast medical demand. This review is an attempt to collate the outcomes of such studies, thus highlighting the utility of AI in rapid screening of molecular markers along with chest X-rays and other COVID-19 symptoms to enable faster diagnosis and patient stratification. By doing so, we also found that molecular markers such as C-reactive protein, IL-6 eosinophils, etc. showed significant differences between severe and non-severe cases of COVID-19 patients. CT findings in the lungs also showed different patterns like lung consolidation significantly higher in patients with poor recovery and lung lesions and fibrosis being higher in patients with good recovery. Thus, from these evidences we perceive that an initial rapid screening using integrated AI approach could be a way forward in efficient patient stratification.","Shafi, Gowhar; Desai, Shruti; Srinivasan, Krithika; Ramesh, Aarthi; Chaturvedi, Rupesh; Uttarwar, Mohan",Mol Genet Genomics,437,1

In particular, we study how the COVID-19 epidemics evolves and how it is contained by different vaccination scenarios by taking into account data showing that older people, as well as individuals with comorbidities and poor metabolic health, and people coming from economically depressed areas with lower quality of life in general, are more likely to develop severe COVID-19 symptoms, and quicker loss of immunity and are therefore more prone to reinfection. Our results reveal that the structure and the spatial arrangement of subpopulations are important epidemiological determinants. In a healthier society the disease spreads more rapidly but the consequences are less disastrous as in a society with more prevalent chronic comorbidities. If individuals with poor health are segregated within one community, the epidemic outcome is less favorable. Moreover, we show that, contrary to currently widely adopted vaccination policies, prioritizing elderly and other higher-risk groups is beneficial only if the supply of vaccine is high. If, however, the vaccination availability is limited, and if the demographic distribution across the social network is homogeneous, better epidemic outcomes are achieved if healthy people are vaccinated first. Only when higher-risk groups are segregated, like in elderly homes, their prioritization will lead to lower COVID-19 related deaths. Accordingly, young and healthy individuals should view vaccine uptake as not only protecting them, but perhaps even more so protecting the more vulnerable socio-demographic groups.","Markovic, Rene; Sterk, Marko; Marhl, Marko; Perc, Matjaz; Gosak, Marko",Results Phys,437,16

DESIGN: A qualitative phenomenological design was used. METHODS: We enrolled 15 nurses who provided care for patients infected by COVID-19 purposively and through snowballing, using a phenomenological approach in critical care units of Iran's public hospitals between May and June 2020. The semi-structured interviews were carried out either via face-to-face or telephone and were analyzed using the 7-step method of Colaizzi. RESULTS: The experiences of nurses caring for patients infected with COVID-19 were categorized into four challenges, including psychological (eight subthemes), organizational (six subthemes), social (six subthemes), and professional (five subthemes). In general, based on the current classification, there seems to be a mixture of positive and negative effects on the psychological, social, and professional challenges and the negative effect only on the organizational challenges. CONCLUSIONS: Positive and negative emotions and experiences have coexisted for the critical care nurses since the COVID-19 outbreak. Emotional support and psychological counseling play an important role in maintaining nurses' optimal mental health during the COVID-19 crisis. Adequate protective equipment, financial and nonfinancial supports, effective communication, training and hiring of staff, and appropriate work shifts are also required to reduce nurses' negative experiences when providing care for the affected individuals.","Chegini, Zahra; Arab-Zozani, Morteza; Rajabi, Mohammad Reza; Kakemam, Edris",Nurs. forum,437,16

The current coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused widespread disease and death. Rapid increases in patient volumes have exposed weaknesses in health care systems and challenged our ability to provide optimal patient care and adequate safety measures to health care workers (HCWs). METHODS: A 36-item survey was distributed to neurologists around the United States through various media platforms. RESULTS: Over a 1-week period, 567 responses were received. Of these, 56% practiced in academia. A total of 87% had access to PPE, with 45% being asked to reuse PPE due to shortages. The pandemic caused rapid changes in practice, most notably a shift toward providing care by teleneurology, although a third experienced challenges in transitioning to this model. Wide variations were noted both in testing and in the guidance provided for the exposed, sick, or vulnerable HCWs. Notably, 59% of respondents felt that their practices were doing what they could, although 56% did not feel safe taking care of patients. CONCLUSIONS: Results from our survey demonstrate significant variability in preparedness and responsiveness to the COVID-19 pandemic in neurology, affected by region, health care setting, and practice model. Practice guidelines from professional societies and other national entities are needed to improve protection for physicians and their patients, promote recommended practice changes during a pandemic, and optimize future preparedness for public health emergencies.","Sharma, Akanksha; Maxwell, Christina R; Farmer, Jill; Greene-Chandos, Diana; LaFaver, Kathrin; Benameur, Karima",Neurology,437,22

Appropriate HF management extensively relies upon patient-reported symptoms. With the growing attention towards patient-centered care, our team recognized an invaluable opportunity to solicit patient-reported subjective experiences regarding telehealth. Methods: In total, 127 patients with a known diagnosis of HF were contacted by phone for participation in an online questionnaire. The tool consisted of questions generated by the investigators and from prior validated patient-reported experience measures. The intention was to assess the quality of care in our HF clinic and to solicit feedback regarding telehealth. Results: Thirty-five patients provided a response. Questions with the most favorable outcomes were in line with our predetermined themes of interpersonal matter, communication, and perceived quality of care. The worst performing questions exhibited a lack of satisfaction with and perceived quality of telehealth. Only 9% (n = 3) preferred follow-up via telehealth, 69% (n = 22) preferred in-person, and 22% (n = 7) were indifferent. Conclusions: Given the multitude of benefits of telehealth, especially appropriate social distancing, telehealth is quite likely here to stay. In sum, with the rapid change in care delivery, patients currently perceive the care delivered via telehealth to be of inferior quality. This lack of quality can be largely attributed to the lack of physical examination, depersonalization of healthcare, and likely, a lack of familiarity with the platform. We urge our colleagues to solicit similar feedback from their patients to improve their own telehealth efforts.","Raman, K. S.; Vyselaar, J. R.",Cardiology Research,437,16

Mining of the responding TFH T cell receptor repertoire revealed a strikingly immunodominant HLADPB1* 04-restricted response to S167-180 in individuals with this allele, which is among the most common HLA alleles in humans. Paired blood and lymph node specimens show that while circulating S-specific TFH cells peak one week after the second immunization, S-specific TFH persist at nearly constant frequencies for at least six months. Collectively, our results underscore the key role that robust TFH cell responses play in establishing long-term immunity by this efficacious human vaccine.","Mudd, Philip A; Turner, Jackson S; Kim, Wooseob; Kalaidina, Elizaveta; Petersen, Jan; Schmitz, Aaron J; Lei, Tingting; Haile, Alem; Nguyen, Thi H.O; Rowntree, Louise C; Rosati, Elisa; Klebert, Michael K; Suessen, Teresa; Middleton, William D; Team, - the SJTRC Study; Teefey, Sharlene A; Presti, Rachel M; Kedzierska, Katherine; Rossjohn, Jamie; Ellebedy, Ali",,437,12

Coronaviruses are RNA single-stranded viruses that have an envelope. In addition, coronaviruses are classified into four subfamilies: alpha, beta, gamma and delta coronaviruses. The first of them, cause mildly symptomatic or asymptomatic infections, while beta-coronaviruses are responsible for severe diseases. SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the group of beta-coronaviruses. Current available therapies use corticosteroids to reduce inflammation, non-specific antiviral drugs or antibiotics in the treatment of secondary bacterial infections. In addition, therapies based on the use of hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, remdesvir, ribavirin, interferon or lopinavir-ritonavir were also initially used. Mesenchemical stem cells (MSCs) are widely used in cell therapies, which include both basic research and clinical trials. Their exceptional effectiveness and safety have been confirmed and documented in many clinical studies, which include a number of inflammatory diseases involving the immune system - one of them is systemic lupus erythematosus. Available data indicate the ability to differentiate MSCs and their immunomodulatory effects. In addition, through interactions with immune cells, which include, but are not limited to, macrophages and dendritic cells, or paracrine secretion, MSCs are able to secrete a number of types of cytokines. MSCs are also characterized by tissue regeneration and regulation of inflammation. Due to their properties, researchers turned to determine whether MSC transplantation is able to improve the outcome of patients with COVID-19 viral pneumonia. The presented review provides not only new knowledge in the field of molecular mechanisms of pro-regenerative action of stem cells, but also have the potential to open up new prospects of action to improve lung tissue regeneration in COVID-19 patients.

Many hospitals reduced their ordinary activity by up to 80%, to leave healthcare staff, wards, and intensive care unit (ICU) beds available for the significant number of Covid-19 patients. All this resulted in a prolonged wait for hospitalization of all other patients, including those with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) eligible for surgery. The majority of thoracic surgery departments changed the clinical-therapeutic path of patients, re-adapting procedures based on the needs dictated by the pandemic while not delaying the necessary treatment. The establishment of Covid-19-free hub centers allowed some elective surgery in NSCLC patients but most of the operations were delayed. The technology has partly facilitated patients' visits through telemedicine when security protocols have prevented face-to-face assessments. Multidisciplinary consultations had to deal also with the priority of the NSCLC cases discussed. Interpretation of radiologic exams had to take into account the differential diagnosis with Covid-19 infection. All the knowledge and experience of the past months reveal that the Covid-19 pandemic has not substantially changed the indications and type of surgical treatment in NSCLC.

Physical health is not the only aspect of humans that is at risk. Globally, the rates and severity of mental illness are being significantly impacted by this pandemic. Two scales have been validated to measure the impact of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on the levels of anxiety and obsessional thinking in clinical and non-clinical populations. The present study was designed to investigate the levels of anxiety and obsessions related to COVID-19 in the general public of Lahore, Pakistan. Materials and Methods: Data were collected via snowball sampling from May 9 to May 19. An online survey consisting of a demographic profile and two scales, Coronavirus Anxiety Scale (CAS) and Obsession with COVID-19 Scale (OCS), was sent through email, WhatsApp, and Facebook groups to adults (18 years and above) of Lahore, Pakistan. Results: A total of 240 individuals (20% men and 80% women) recorded their responses. The majority belonged to a nuclear family system (60%), and their education level ranged from high school to Ph.D. The cut-off score for probable dysfunctional coronavirus anxiety and obsession levels was not met within this sample (CAS, M = 3.24, SD = 4.21; OCS, M = 4.14, SD = 3.15), suggesting that the general population of Lahore, Pakistan is not suffering from dysfunctional anxiety or obsessions related to COVID-19. Forty-seven participants' score on OCS and 35 participants' scores on CAS were above the cut-off, i.e., &#8805;7 and &#8805;9, respectively. The results of the correlation analysis showed a significant positive relationship (** p < 0.619) between anxiety and obsessions related to COVID-19. Conclusion: One important, yet surprising, conclusion of this study is that the average adult in Lahore does not show much anxiety or obsessions related to COVID-19. Other studies around the world using these measurement tools have indicated significantly high levels of both anxiety and obsessions related to COVID-19. These findings may demonstrate the resilience of Pakistanis or perhaps the lack of understanding of the seriousness of the situation.","Majeed, Saima; Schwaiger, Elizabeth Maria; Nazim, Abia; Samuel, Ivan Suneel",Front Public Health,437,20

However, existing studies rarely employed longitudinal designs, precluding the determination of the directionality between endorsement of conspiracy theories and its societal consequences. Also, relatively little research examined whether the association between protective health behaviour and the endorsement of conspiracy theories is affected by the content of a given theory. METHODS: A four-wave longitudinal panel survey on the association between belief in a wide range of conspiracy theories about COVID-19 and protective behaviour was carried out on a representative sample of Polish citizens (T1 = 1130, T2 = 971, T3 = 818, T4 = 688). Analyses were performed using Random Intercept Cross-Lagged Panel Models. RESULTS: The results showed a reciprocal, bidirectional association between conspiracy mentality and protective behaviour. The same effect was also observed between protective behaviour and threat of authoritarianism. We did not find evidence that specific COVID-19 related conspiracy theories directly (and differently) predict within-person changes in protective behaviour over time. CONCLUSIONS: Our results showed that the association between various conspiracy-related variables and anti-pandemic COVID-19 variables differs at within- and between-person levels. Changes in the adherence to pro-health measures were negatively predicted by conspiracy mentality and a feeling of threat that the solutions introduced by the government may limit civil rights. Specific conspiracy beliefs were significantly related to protective behaviour only at the between-person level.","Oleksy, Tomasz; Wnuk, Anna; Gambin, Malgorzata; Lys, Agnieszka",Soc Sci Med,437,24

Several uncertainty-aware models, such as Bayesian Neural Network (BNNs) and Deep Ensembles have been proposed in the literature for quantifying predictive uncertainty. However, research in this area has been largely confined to the big data regime. In this work, we show that the uncertainty estimation capability of state-of-the-art BNNs and Deep Ensemble models degrades significantly when the amount of training data is small. To address the issue of accurate uncertainty estimation in the small-data regime, we propose a probabilistic generalization of the popular sample-efficient non-parametric kNN approach. Our approach enables deep kNN classifier to accurately quantify underlying uncertainties in its prediction. We demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed approach by achieving superior uncertainty quantification as compared to state-of-the-art on a real-world application of COVID-19 diagnosis from chest X-Rays.

However, how the media reports affect the development of COVID-19 epidemic is a key public health issue. Here the Pearson correlation and cross-correlation analyses are conducted to find the statistically significant correlations between the number of new hospital notifications for COVID-19 and the number of daily news items for twelve major websites in China from January 11th to February 6th 2020. To examine the implication for transmission dynamics of these correlations, we proposed a novel model, which embeds the function of individual behaviour change (media impact) into the intensity of infection. The nonlinear least squares estimation is used to identify the best-fit parameter values in the model from the observed data. To determine impact of key parameters with media impact and control measures for the later outcome of the outbreak, we also carried out the uncertainty and sensitivity analyses. These findings confirm the importance of the responses of individuals to the media reports, and the crucial role of experts and governments in promoting the public under self-quarantine. Therefore, for mitigating epidemic COVID-19, the media publicity should be focused on how to guide people's behavioral changes by experts, and the management departments and designated hospitals of the COVID-19 should take effective quarantined measures, which are critical for the control of the disease.","Yan, Qinling; Tang, Yingling; Yan, Dingding; Wang, Jiaying; Yang, Linqian; Yang, Xinpei; Tang, Sanyi",J Theor Biol,437,2

Severe cutaneous adverse reactions are an issue,20.896307,9.997334,2020,"In its more severe forms, COVID-19 progresses towards an excessive immune response, leading to the systemic overexpression of proinflammatory cytokines like IL6, mostly from the infected lungs. This cytokine storm can cause multiple organ damage and death. Consequently, there is a pressing need to identify therapies to treat and prevent severe symptoms during COVID-19. Based on previous clinical evidence, we hypothesized that inhibiting T cell co-stimulation by blocking CD80/86 could be an effective therapeutic strategy against progression to severe proinflammatory states. To support this hypothesis, we performed an analysis integrating blood transcriptional data we generated from rheumatoid arthritis patients treated with abatacept -- a CD80/86 co-stimulation inhibitor -- with the pathological features associated with COVID-19, particularly in its more severe forms. We have found that many of the biological processes that have been consistently associated with COVID-19 pathology are reversed by CD80/86 co-stimulation inhibition, including the downregulation of IL6 production. Also, analysis of previous transcriptional data from blood of SARS-CoV-infected patients showed that the response to abatacept has a very high level of antagonism to that elicited by COVID-19. Finally, analyzing a recent single cell RNA-seq dataset from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid cells from COVID-19 patients, we found a significant correlation along the main elements of the C80/86 axis: CD86+/80+ antigen presenting cells, activated CD4+ T cells and IL6 production. Our in-silico study provides additional support to the hypothesis that blocking of the CD80/CD86 signaling axis may be protective of the excessive proinflammatory state associated with COVID-19 in the lungs.","Julia, Antonio; Bonafonte, Irene; G'omez, Antonio; L'opez-Lasanta, Mar'ia; L'opez-Corbeto, Mireia; Mart'inez-Mateu, Sergio H.; Llad'os, Jordi; Rodr'iguez-Nunez, Iv'an; Myers, Richard M.; Marsal, Sara",,437,29

Lockdowns, though an effective policy for containment, imposes a heavy cost on the economy as it enforces extreme social distancing measures on the whole population. The objective of this note is to study alternatives to Lockdown which are either more targeted or allows partial opening of the economy. Cities are often spatially organized into wards. We introduce Multi-lattice small world (MLSW) network as a model of a city where each ward is represented by a 2D lattice and each vertex in the latex represents an agent endowed with SEIR dynamics. Through simulation studies on MLSW, we examine a variety of candidate suppression policies and find that restricting Lockdowns to infected wards can indeed out-perform global Lockdowns in both reducing the attack rate and also shortening the duration of the epidemic. Even policies such as partial opening of the economy, such as Two-Day Work Week, can be competitive if augmented with extensive Contact Tracing.","Bhattacharyya, Chiranjib; Vinay, V",J Indian Inst Sci,437,3

One path to such rapid diagnosis may rely on identifying volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted by the infected body, or in other words, identifying the smell of the infection. Consistent with this rationale, dogs can use their nose to identify Covid-19 patients. Given the scale of the pandemic, however, animal deployment is a challenging solution. In contrast, electronic noses (eNoses) are machines aimed at mimicking animal olfaction, and these can be deployed at scale. To test the hypothesis that SARS CoV-2 infection is associated with a body-odor detectable by an eNose, we placed a generic eNose in-line at a drive-through testing station. We applied a deep learning classifier to the eNose measurements, and achieved real-time detection of SARS CoV-2 infection at a level significantly better than chance, for both symptomatic and non-symptomatic participants. This proof of concept with a generic eNose implies that an optimized eNose may allow effective real-time diagnosis, which would provide for extensive relief in the Covid-19 pandemic.","Snitz, Kobi; Andelman-Gur, Michal; Pinchover, Liron; Weissgross, Reut; Weissbrod, Aharon; Mishor, Eva; Zoller, Roni; Linetsky, Vera; Medhanie, Abebe; Shushan, Sagit; Jaffe, Eli; Sobel, Noam",PLoS One,437,29

OBJECTIVE: To explore factors such as demographic, social, family, abuse, risk of depression, habits and health conditions, which influence suicidal ideation in the elderly people in the cities of Medellín, Barranquilla, and Pasto (Colombia), with the intention to identify those associated factors that can be used in public health programs focused on this population. METHODS: Cross-sectional analytical study was conducted using a secondary source, demographic, social, clinical variables, social support, discrimination, abuse, happiness, depression, functional capacity, and as a dependent variable were asked the question: ""Have you ever thought about committing suicide?"" A descriptive, bivariate and multivariate analysis was performed. RESULTS: The median age was &#8804; 69 [interquartile range, 11] years, and 58.2% were women. The prevalence of suicidal ideation was 6.4%, and of these, 28.7% had made plans to end their lives, and 66.7% had tried at least once. A statistical association was found with informal employment, cigarette consumption, alcohol and psychoactive substances, risk of depression, having a disability, dissatisfaction with their quality of life, with their health, with their economic situation, as well as feeling unhappy, bad treatment and bad relationships among family members, poor social support, sexual and economic abuse, and finally, discrimination.

Patients with systemic vasculitis have an increased risk of serious infections and so may be at risk of severe outcomes following COVID-19. It is important to establish the risk factors for severe COVID-19 outcomes in these patients, including the impact of immunosuppressive therapies. METHODS: A multi-centre cohort was developed through the participation of centres affiliated with national UK and Ireland vasculitis registries. Clinical characteristics and outcomes were described. Logistic regression was used to evaluate associations between potential risk factors and severe COVID-19 outcome, defined as a requirement for advanced oxygen therapy, invasive ventilation, or death. RESULTS: Sixty-five cases of patients with systemic vasculitis who developed COVID-19 were reported (median age 70 years, 49% female) of whom 25 (38%) experienced a severe outcome. Most cases (55/65, 85%) had ANCA-associated vasculitis (AAV). Almost all patients required hospitalization (59/65, 91%), 7 patients (11%) were admitted to intensive care and 18 patients (28%) died.

Vasculitis disease activity and non-glucocorticoid immunosuppression were not associated with severe outcome. CONCLUSION: In patients with systemic vasculitis, glucocorticoid use at presentation and comorbid respiratory disease were associated with severe outcomes in COVID-19.

Isothermal nucleic acid amplification technologies eliminate the need for thermal cycling; however, fluorescence-based detection of products is still required for real-time, quantitative results. Several portable isothermal heaters with integrated fluorescence detection are now commercially available; however, the cost of these devices remains a significant barrier to widespread adoption in resource-limited settings. Described here is a protocol for the design and assembly of a modular, low-cost fluorimeter constructed from off-the-shelf components. Enclosed in a compact 3D printed housing, the fluorimeter is designed to be placed atop a commercially available heat block holding a PCR tube. The fluorimeter described here was optimized to detect fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) dye, but the system can be modified for use with dyes commonly used as reporters in real-time nucleic acid amplification reactions. Clinical applicability of the system is demonstrated by performing real-time nucleic acid detection with two isothermal amplification technologies: recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) for detection of positive control DNA provided in a commercial kit and reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) for detection of clinically meaningful levels of SARS-CoV-2 RNA.","Coole, Jackson; Kortum, Alex; Tang, Yubo; Vohra, Imran; Maker, Yajur; Kundrod, Kathryn; Natoli, Mary; Richards-Kortum, Rebecca",J. vis. exp,437,32

Rapid, Living Practice Points From the American College of Physicians (Version 1)",20.724457,10.09684,2021,"BACKGROUND: During the COVID-19 pandemic, the number of individuals needing hospital admission has sometimes exceeded the availability of hospital beds. Since hospitalization can have detrimental effects on older individuals, preference has been given to younger patients. The aim of this study was to assess the utility of hospitalization for elderly affected by COVID-19. We hypothesized that their mortality decreases when there is greater access to hospitals. METHODS: This study examined 1902 COVID-19 patients consecutively admitted to three large hospitals in Milan, Italy. Overall mortality data for Milan from the same period was retrieved. Based on emergency department (ED) data, both peak and off-peak phases were identified. The percentage of elderly patients admitted to EDs during these two phases were compared by calculating the standardized mortality ratio (SMR) of the individuals younger than, versus older than, 80 years. RESULTS: The median age of the patients hospitalized during the peak phase was lower than the median age during the off-peak phase (64 vs. 75 years, respectively; p <0.001). However, while the SMR for the younger patients was lower during the off-peak phase (1.98, 95% CI: 1.72-2.29 versus 1.40, 95% CI: 1.25-1.58, respectively), the SMR was similar between both phases for the elderly patients (2.28, 95% CI: 2.07-2.52 versus 2.48, 95% CI: 2.32-2.65, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Greater access to hospitals during an off-peak phase did not affect the mortality rate of COVID-19-positive elderly patients in Milan. This finding, if confirmed in other settings, should influence future decisions regarding resource management of health care organizations.","Costantino, Giorgio; Solbiati, Monica; Elli, Silvia; Paganuzzi, Marco; Massabò, Didi; Montano, Nicola; Mancarella, Marta; Cortellaro, Francesca; Cataudella, Emanuela; Bellone, Andrea; Capsoni, Nicolò; Bertolini, Guido; Nattino, Giovanni; Casazza, Giovanni",PLoS One,437,22

Prevalence of liver injury and associated clinical characteristics are not well-defined. We aim to identify the prevalence of and risk factors for development of COVID-19 associated acute liver injury in a large cohort in the United States. APPROACH & RESULTS: In this retrospective cohort study, all patients who underwent SARS-CoV-2 testing at three hospitals in the NewYork-Presbyterian network were assessed. Of 3381 patients, 2273 tested positive and had higher initial and peak ALT than those who tested negative. Acute liver injury was categorized as mild if alanine aminotransferase (ALT) was > upper limit of normal (ULN) but < two times ULN, moderate if ALT was between two and five times ULN, and severe if ALT was > five times ULN. Among patients who tested positive, 45% had mild, 21% moderate, and 6.4% severe liver injury. In multivariable analysis, severe acute liver injury was significantly associated with elevated inflammatory markers including ferritin (OR 2.40, p<0.001) and IL-6 (OR 1.45, p=0.009). Patients with severe liver injury had a more severe clinical course, including higher rates of ICU admission (69%), intubation (65%), renal replacement therapy (33%), and mortality (42%). In multivariable analysis, peak ALT was significantly associated with death or discharge to hospice (OR 1.14, p=0.044), controlling for age, body mass index, diabetes, hypertension, intubation, and renal replacement therapy. CONCLUSION: Acute liver injury is common in patients who test positive for SARS-CoV-2, but is most often mild. However, among the 6.4% of patients with severe liver injury, a severe disease course should be anticipated.","Phipps, Meaghan M; Barraza, Luis H; LaSota, Elijah D; Sobieszczyk, Magdalena E; Pereira, Marcus R; Zheng, Elizabeth X; Fox, Alyson N; Zucker, Jason; Verna, Elizabeth C",Hepatology (Baltim.),437,1

Methods: Using the Baidu Index Platform (http://index.baidu.com) and the website of Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention as data resources to obtain the search volume (SV) of keywords for symptoms associated with COVID-19 from January 1 to February 20 in each year from 2017 to 2020 and the epidemic data in Hubei province and the other top 9 impacted provinces in China. Data of 2020 were compared with those of the previous three years. Data of Hubei province were compared with those of the other 9 provinces. The differences and characteristics of the SV of COVID-19-related symptoms, and the correlations between the SV of COVID-19 and the number of newly confirmed/suspected cases were analyzed. The lag effects were discussed. Results: Comparing the SV from January 1, 2020 to February 20, 2020 with those for the same period of the previous three years, Hubei's SV for cough, fever, diarrhea, chest tightness, dyspnea, and other symptoms were significantly increased. The total SV of lower respiratory symptoms was significantly higher than that of upper respiratory symptoms (Pï¼0.001). The SV of COVID-19 in Hubei province was significantly correlated with the number of newly confirmed/suspected cases (r confirmed = 0.723, r suspected = 0.863, both p < 0.001). The results of the distributed lag model suggested that the patients who searched relevant symptoms on the Internet may begin to see doctors in 2-3 days later and be confirmed in 3-4 days later. Conclusion: The total SV of lower respiratory symptoms was higher than that of upper respiratory symptoms, and the SV of diarrhea also increased significantly. It warned us to pay attention to not only the symptoms of the lower respiratory tract but also the gastrointestinal symptoms, especially diarrhea in patients with COVID-19. Internet search behavior had a positive correlation with the number of newly confirmed/suspected cases, suggesting that big data has an important role in the early warning of infectious diseases.","Qiu, Hui-Jun; Yuan, Lian-Xiong; Wu, Qing-Wu; Zhou, Yu-Qi; Zheng, Rui; Huang, Xue-Kun; Yang, Qin-Tai",,437,16

Military studies have investigated the association with vitamin D status, and subsequent supplementation, with the risk of stress fractures particularly during recruit training. The expression of nuclear vitamin D receptors and vitamin D metabolic enzymes in immune cells additionally provides a rationale for the potential role of vitamin D in maintaining immune homeostasis. One particular area of interest has been in the prevention of acute respiratory tract infections (ARTIs). The aims of this review were to consider the evidence of vitamin D supplementation in military populations in the prevention of ARTIs, including SARS-CoV-2 infection and consequent COVID-19 illness. The occupational/organisational importance of reducing transmission of SARS-CoV-2, especially where infected young adults may be asymptomatic, presymptomatic or paucisymptomatic, is also discussed.","Parsons, Iain T; Gifford, R M; Stacey, M J; Lamb, L E; O039,; Shea, M K; Woods, D R",,437,15

We assessed the level of fear of COVID-19 in Hong Kong adults and its associations with sociodemographic factors and perceived benefits and harms of COVID-19. In a 6-day population-based cross-sectional online survey in May 2020, 4,890 adults provided data on fear and perceived benefits and harms, personal happiness and family well-being, and sociodemographic characteristics. Linear regression was used to analyze associations. The level of fear was moderate (mean score 6.3/10). Fewer respondents reported perceived benefits (10.6%-21.7%) than harms (13.4%-43.5%). Females, younger age groups, and respondents with lower education or more cohabitants had greater fear. Fear was associated with perceived personal (increased knowledge of personal epidemic prevention) and family benefits (improved family hygiene), both with a very small effect size (Cohen's d = 0.03). Fear was also associated with lower personal happiness and perceived personal (increased negative emotions, feeling depressed and anxious, decreased income, and decreased work efficiency) and family harms (increased conflicts and negative emotions among family members), with small effect sizes (0.08-0.37). We have first shown sociodemographic differences in the fear of COVID-19 and such fear was associated with both perceived personal and family benefits and harms of COVID-19. Our findings may guide the management of fear to reduce sociodemographic differences, and maximize benefits and minimize harms.","Sit, Shirley Man-Man; Lam, Tai-Hing; Lai, Agnes Yuen-Kwan; Wong, Bonny Yee-Man; Wang, Man-Ping; Ho, Sai-Yin",Transl Behav Med,437,10

In a large multi-center cohort of COVID-19-infected patients, we aim to analyze (1) the outcomes of patients with underlying CLD [with and without cirrhosis] and (2) the development and impact of ACLF on in-hospital mortality. DESIGN: We identified 192 adults with CLD from among 10,859 patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection (admitted to any of 12 hospitals in a New York health care system between March 1, 2020 and April 27, 2020). ACLF was defined using the EASL-CLIF Consortium definition. Patient follow-up was through April 30, 2020, or until the date of discharge, transfer, or death. RESULTS: Of the 84 patients with cirrhosis, 32 [38%] developed ACLF, with respiratory failure [39%] and renal failure [26%] being the most common. Hispanic/Latino ethnicity was particularly at higher risk of in-hospital mortality [adjusted HR 4.92, 95% 1.27-19.09, p < 0.02] in cirrhosis despite having lower risk of development of ACLF [HR 0.26, 95% CI 0.08-0.89, p = 0.03]. Hypertension on admission predicted development of ACLF [HR 3.46, 95% CI 1.12-10.75, p = 0.03]. In-hospital mortality was not different between CLD patients with or without cirrhosis [p = 0.24] but was higher in those with cirrhosis who developed ACLF [adjusted HR 9.06, 95% CI 2.63-31.12, p < 0.001] with a trend for increased mortality by grade of ACLF [p = 0.002]. There was no difference in in-hospital mortality between the CLD cohort compared to matched control without CLD (log rank, p = 0.98) and between the cirrhosis cohort compared to matched control without cirrhosis (log rank, p = 0.51). CONCLUSION: Development of ACLF is the main driver of increased in-hospital mortality in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 infection and cirrhosis.","Satapathy, Sanjaya K; Roth, Nitzan C; Kvasnovsky, Charlotte; Hirsch, Jamie S; Trindade, Arvind J; Molmenti, Ernesto; Barish, Matthew; Hirschwerk, David; Da, Ben L; Bernstein, David",Hepatol Int,437,8

The role of blood groups in susceptibility/resistance to various infectious diseases has been reported. However, the association of blood groups with susceptibility to COVID-19 infections or related death are limited. In the present report, we performed an epidemiological investigation in the Indian population to decipher the importance of blood groups concerning susceptibility or mortality in COVID-19 infection. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data on COVID-19 infection and mortality was obtained from the website of the Government of India. Prevalence of ABO blood groups in different states and union territories of India were searched using different databases such as PubMed and Google Scholar. Relevant articles were downloaded, and data were extracted. Spearman's rank coefficient analysis was employed to study the correlation between blood group frequencies and COVID-19 infection or mortality rate. RESULTS: A significant inverse correlation was observed between the frequency of O blood group and the COVID-19 mortality rate (Spearman r=-0.36, P=0.03), indicating a possible protective role of O blood group against COVID-19 related death. In contrast, the prevalence of blood group B was positively correlated with COVID-19 death/million (Spearman r=0.67, P<0.0001), suggesting B blood type as a deleterious factor in COVID-19 infection. CONCLUSIONS: ABO blood group system is associated with poor prognosis of COVID-19 infection. Blood group O may protects, and subjects with blood type B could be susceptible to COVID-19 mortality. However, further studies on COVID-19 infected patients in different population are required to validate our findings.","Padhi, Sunali; Suvankar, Subham; Dash, Debabrata; Panda, Venketesh K; Pati, Abhijit; Panigrahi, Jogeswar; Panda, Aditya K",Transfus Clin Biol,437,16

To meet the increased demand for hand sanitizer during the pandemic, the US FDA issued an Emergency Use Authorization allowing new manufacturers and importers to enter the market. Some of the newly introduced hand sanitizer products contained methanol in lieu of ethanol or isopropanol. We describe five patients with fatal methanol poisoning resulting from hand sanitizers improperly containing methanol. CASE SUMMARY: Comparing a 5-month period from 2019 to the same time frame in 2020, the Arizona Poison and Drug Information Center has seen an increase of 124% in exposures to hand sanitizer. Of these cases, 28% involved methanol-contaminated hand sanitizer. Five of these patients died from methanol poisoning. All five cases had similar clinical features with severe high anion gap metabolic acidosis and, in four patients, elevated osmolal gap. Methanol concentrations were consistently very elevated, but these results were not available before the patients succumbed. Four of the patients received fomepizole and adjunctive care. Two patients received emergency extracorporeal therapy. All five died despite maximal treatment efforts. CONCLUSION: During the pandemic in 2020, there was a proliferation of alcohol-based hand sanitizers which contained methanol. Exposure to these products, which failed to meet regulatory standards, led to increased harm and death. Challenges to treatment of methanol poisoning, especially in rural areas, include lack of access to timely laboratory measurement of methanol concentrations and lack of available emergency hemodialysis without transfer of the patient.","Holzman, Sarah Denise; Larsen, Jaiva; Kaur, Ramandeep; Smelski, Geoffrey; Dudley, Steven; Shirazi, Farshad Mazda",Clin Toxicol (Phila),437,16

METHODS: This single-center study included data concerning 658 COVID-19 patients, who were hospitalized in our institute, between April 20th, 2020 and July 30th, 2020. Demographic data, findings of the imaging studies, and laboratory test results were retrieved from the institutional digital database. RESULTS: New onset AF (NOAF) was identified in 33 patients (5%). Patients who developed AF were older (72.42 ± 6.10 vs 53.78 ± 13.80, p < 0.001) and had higher frequencies of hypertension and heart failure compared to patients without NOAF (p < 0.001, for both). The CHA2DS2-VASc score was higher in patients, who developed NOAF, compared to those who did not during hospitalization for COVID-19 (p < 0.001). Subjects, who developed NOAF during hospitalization, had a higher leukocyte count, neutrophil / lymphocyte ratio (NLR), C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and procalcitonin levels compared to those without NOAF (p < 0.001 for all comparisons). Diffuse lung infiltration was also more frequent in COVID-19 patients, who developed NOAF, during hospitalization (p = 0.015). Multivariate logistic regression analysis demonstrated that age, CHA2DS2-VASc score, CRP, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and presence of diffuse lung infiltration on thorax CT were predictive for NOAF. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of NOAF in hospitalized COVID-19 patients is higher than the general population. Age, CHA2DS2-VASc score, C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and presence of diffuse lung infiltration on thorax CT may be used to identify patients at high risk for development of NOAF. Especially among these parameters, the presence of diffuse lung infiltration on thorax CT it was the most powerful independent predictor of NOAF development.","Kelesoglu, Saban; Yilmaz, Yucel; Ozkan, Eyup; Calapkorur, Bekir; Gok, Mustafa; Dursun, Zehra Bestepe; Kilic, Aysegul Ulu; Demirelli, Selami; Simsek, Ziya; Elcik, Deniz",J Electrocardiol,437,24

Although most often used in the laboratory it has seen increasing application under field conditions. Air is drawn or pushed through a metabolic chamber or the nest with the animal, and the O2 depletion and/or CO2 accumulation in the air is analysed to calculate metabolic rate and energy expenditure. Under field conditions, animals are often measured within the microclimate of their nest and in contrast to laboratory work, the temperature of the air entering the nest cannot be controlled. Thus, the aim of our study was to determine the explanatory power of respirometry in a set-up mimicking field conditions. We measured O2 consumption of 14 laboratory mice (Mus musculus) using three different flow rates [50 L*h-1 (834 mL*min-1), 60 L*h-1 (1000 mL*min-1) and 70 L*h-1 (1167 mL*min-1)] and two different temperatures of the inflowing air; either the same as the temperature inside the metabolic chamber (no temperature differential; 20 °C), or cooler (temperature differential of 10 °C). Our results show that the energy expenditure of the mice did not change significantly in relation to a cooler airflow, nor was it affected by different flow rates, despite a slight, but significant decrease of about 1.5 °C in chamber temperature with the cooler airflow. Our study emphasises the validity of the results obtained by open-flow respirometry when investigating energy budgets and physiological responses of animals to ambient conditions. Nevertheless, subtle changes in chamber temperature in response to changes in the temperature and flow rate of the air pulled or pushed through the system were detectable. Thus, constant airflow during open-flow respirometry and consequent changes in nest/chamber temperature should be measured.","Nowack, Julia; Dill, Veronika; Dausmann, Kathrin H",J Therm Biol,437,16

The unexpected large number of COVID-19 cases has disrupted the healthcare system in many countries and resulted in a shortage of bed spaces in the hospitals. Consequently, predicting the number of COVID-19 cases is imperative for governments to take appropriate actions. The number of COVID-19 cases can be accurately predicted by considering historical data of reported cases alongside some external factors that affect the spread of the virus. In the literature, most of the existing prediction methods focus only on the historical data and overlook most of the external factors. Hence, the number of COVID-19 cases is inaccurately predicted. Therefore, the main objective of this study is to simultaneously consider historical data and the external factors. This can be accomplished by adopting data analytics, which include developing a nonlinear autoregressive exogenous input (NARX) neural network-based algorithm. The viability and superiority of the developed algorithm are demonstrated by conducting experiments using data collected for top five affected countries in each continent. The results show an improved accuracy when compared with existing methods. Moreover, the experiments are extended to make future prediction for the number of patients afflicted with COVID-19 during the period from August 2020 until September 2020. By using such predictions, both the government and people in the affected countries can take appropriate measures to resume pre-epidemic activities.","Eltoukhy, Abdelrahman E.

This “mini-exon” sequence is derived from the 5′ end of a 137 nucleotide RNA (medRNA). The remainder of each mRNA is derived from a protein-coding exon that is not linked to the mini-exon. We propose that medRNA is spliced in trans to de-novo-initiated transcripts of protein-coding genes. This trans splicing model predicts that the downstream portion of medRNA will be part of a branched structure and then be released as a free product (minRNA). We demonstrate that significant levels of minRNA exist in trypanosome RNA. Furthermore, minRNA can be released from high molecular weight RNA by a HeLa cell S100 “debranching” extract. We conclude that trnas splicing is the physiological process by which mature mRNA molecules are synthesized in trypanosomes.","Sutton, Richard E.; Boothroyd, John C.",Cell,437,2

Our objective was to develop a decision model that supports prioritization of care from a utilitarian perspective, which is to minimize population health loss. Methods A cohort state-transition model was developed and applied to 43 semi-elective non-paediatric surgeries commonly performed in academic hospitals. Scenarios of delaying surgery from two weeks were compared with delaying up to one year, and no surgery at all. Model parameters were based on registries, scientific literature, and the World Health Organization global burden of disease study. For each surgery, the urgency was estimated as the average expected loss of Quality-Adjusted Life-Years (QALYs) per month. Results Given the best available evidence, the two most urgent surgeries were bypass surgery for Fontaine III/IV peripheral arterial disease (0.23 QALY loss/month, 95%-CI: 0.09-0.24) and transaortic valve implantation (0.15 QALY loss/month, 95%-CI: 0.09-0.24). The two least urgent surgeries were placing a shunt for dialysis (0.01, 95%-CI: 0.005-0.01) and thyroid carcinoma resection (0.01, 95%-CI: 0.01-0.02): these surgeries were associated with a limited amount of health lost on the waiting list. Conclusion Expected health loss due to surgical delay can be objectively calculated with our decision model based on best available evidence, which can guide prioritization of surgeries to minimize population health loss in times of scarcity. This tool should yet be placed in the context of different ethical perspectives and combined with capacity management tools to facilitate large-scale implementation.","Gravesteijn, Benjamin; Krijkamp, Eline; Busschbach, Jan; Geleijnse, Geert; Helmrich, Isabel Retel; Bruinsma, Sophie; Lint, Celine van; Veen, Ernest van; Steyerberg, Ewout; Verhoef, Cornelis; Saase, Jan van; Lingsma, Hester; Jong, Robert Baatenburg de; collaborators, - Value Based Operation Room Triage team",,437,28

METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of all children presenting to the Texas Children’s Hospital system with testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) from March 10, 2020 through June 28, 2020.Demographics were recorded for all patients undergoing testing and clinical characteristics and outcomes were recorded for children with positive tests. RESULTS: Of 16,554 unique patients ≤ 21 years of age who were tested for SARS-CoV-2, 1215 (7.3%) patients tested positive. Infants under 1 year of age and patients aged 18-21 years had the highest percent of positive tests at 9.9% (230/2329) and 10.7% (79/739), respectively. Hispanic children accounted for 66% (802/1215) of positive tests, though they only represented 42.1% (6972/16554) of all children tested for SARS-CoV-2. Of the 1215 children with a positive test, 55.7% had fever, 40.9% had cough, 39.8% had congestion or rhinorrhea, 21.9% had gastrointestinal complaints, and 15.9% were asymptomatic. Only 97 (8%) patients were hospitalized (of which 68% were Hispanic). Most hospitalized patients had underlying medical conditions (62/97, 63.9%), including obesity. Thirty-one hospitalized patients (31/97, 32%) required respiratory support and nine patients (9/97, 9.3%) received SARS-CoV-2 antiviral therapy. Two patients died. CONCLUSIONS: A relatively high percentage of Hispanic children tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and were hospitalized. Most children with detection of SARS-CoV-2 had uncomplicated illness courses, some children were critically ill, and two patients died.","Foster, Catherine E; Marquez, Lucila; Davis, Andrea L; Tocco, Elizabeth; Koy, Tjin H; Dunn, James; Revell, Paula A; Arrington, Amy S; Campbell, Judith R",J Pediatric Infect Dis Soc,437,17

Methods: We use daily data at the county level. The COVID-19 cases and fatalities data are from the New York Times. Social distancing measures are from SafeGraph. Both data are retrieved from the Unfolded Studio website. The county-level COVID-related policy responses are from the National Association of Counties. We use an event-study design and regression analysis to estimate the effect of the state-wide shelter-in-place order on social distancing and the number of cases and deaths. Results: We find that the growth rate of cases and deaths is significantly lower during the policy period when the percentage of the population that stays at home is highest. The crucial question is whether the policy has a causal impact on the sheltering percentages. The fact that some counties in Texas adopted local restrictive policies well before the state-wide policy helps us address this question. We do not find evidence that this top-down restrictive policy increased the percentage of the population that exercised social distancing. Discussion: Shelter-in-place policies are more effective at the local level and should go along with efforts to inform and update the public about the potential consequences of the disease and its current state in their localities.,"Castaneda, Marco A.; Saygili, Meryem",Front Public Health,437,9

In our model, people may be infectious while incubating or during their prodrome or acute illness. We derived an expression for [Formula: see text] , the reproduction number, took its partial derivatives with respect to control parameters, and encoded these analytical results in a user-friendly Mathematica™ notebook. With biological parameters for SARS estimated from the initial case series in Hong Kong and infection rates from hospitalizations in Singapore, we determined [Formula: see text] 's sensitivity to control parameters. RESULTS: Stage-specific infection rate estimates from cases hospitalized before quarantine began exceed those from the entire outbreak, but are qualitatively similar: infectiousness was negligible until symptom onset, and increased 10-fold from prodrome to acute illness. Given such information, authorities might instead have emphasized a strategy whose efficiency more than compensates for any possible reduction in efficacy. CONCLUSIONS: In future outbreaks of new human diseases transmitted via close interpersonal contact, it should be possible to identify the optimal intervention early enough to facilitate effective decision-making.","Feng, Zhilan; Yang, Yiding; Xu, Dashun; Zhang, Pei; McCauley, Mary Mason; Glasser, John W.",J Theor Biol,437,29

INTERVENTIONS: This study analyzed the anticoagulation management and monitoring strategies, bleeding complications, and thrombotic events during ECMO support. RESULTS: Eight of 667 confirmed COVID-19 patients received venovenous ECMO and had an elevated D-dimer before and during ECMO support. An ECMO circuit pack (oxygenator and tubing) was replaced a total of 13 times in all eight patients and coagulation related complications included oxygenator thrombosis (7/8), tracheal hemorrhage (5/8), oronasal hemorrhage (3/8), thoracic hemorrhage (3/8), bleeding at puncture sites (4/8), and cannulation site hemorrhage (2/8). CONCLUSIONS: Hypercoagulability and secondary hyperfibrinolysis during ECMO support in COVID-19 patients are common and possibly increase the propensity for thrombotic events and failure of the oxygenator.

Optimising patients’ surgical pathways to reduce the length of stay and complications is an area of particular importance, both for maximal utilisation of available resources and for reduction of the exposure of inpatient and elective patients to an increased risk of infection within healthcare facilities. The aim of this review was to investigate the possible implications of using low-pressure laparoscopic gynaecological surgery versus standard- or high-pressure pneumoperitoneum surgeries. The primary outcome was postoperative pain, with secondary outcomes including duration of surgery, length of inpatient stay and rate of complications. MEDLINE, Embase and Cochrane CENTRAL were searched from inception to December 2020. We searched for published randomised control trials comparing low-pressure laparoscopic surgery (≤8 mmHg) to at least one additional standardised pneumoperitoneum pressure (≥12 mmHg and/or ≥15 mmHg). A total of 203 studies were reviewed, five of which were included in this analysis. Studies comparing low-pressure laparoscopic surgery against gasless abdominal cavities were excluded. The meta-analysis of the results was pooled and calculated within RevMan 5.0 software (Cochrane, London, England). Studies using a visual analogue scale (1-10) to compare low versus standard pneumoperitoneum pressures did not display a significant diminution of postoperative pain at ≤ 6 or 24 hours: -0.30 [95% CI -0.63, 0.03] and -0.66 [95% CI -1.35, 0.02], respectively. Studies additionally demonstrated worse visualisation of the surgical field within the low-pressure group (risk ratio 10.31; 95% CI, 1.29-82.38 I(2) = 0%). Studies measuring postoperative pain using a numerical rating scale displayed significant pain reduction at all hours measured (p ≤ 0.01). The rate of intraoperative complications was 1% for all groups measured. Cumulative analysis of the duration of surgery did not differ significantly between groups (p = 0.99). The pandemic has revealed new issues that must be addressed by clinicians to promote the safety of patients and the efficiency of inpatient stay. This review has paved the way for new possibilities and innovative approaches to address the issue of optimising patient surgical pathways; however, at present, we cannot give a firm justification for the use of low-pressure gynaecological laparoscopy. Reasons for this include the minimal reduction in pain scores between low, standard and high pneumoperitoneum pressures, leading to a mixture of statistically significant results, as well as a reduction in the visualisation of the surgical field and the small population sizes in the reviewed papers. Additional research is required to further explore the potential clinical benefits of gynaecological laparoscopy to ensure its effective ambulatory use within mainstream surgical operations.","Hamer, Jack; Jones, Edward; Chan, Amy; Tahmasebi, Farshad",Cureus,437,15

Aims: To assess the humoral response to mRNA vaccine against SARS CoV2, in AIRD patients treated with immunomodulating drugs and the impact on AIRD activity. Methods: Consecutive patients treated at the rheumatology institute who received their first SARS-CoV-2 (Pfizer) vaccine were recruited to the study, at their routine visit. The patients were invited for serology test 4-6 weeks after receiving the second dose of vaccine. IgG Antibodies (Ab) against SARS COV2 virus were detected using the SARS-Cov-2 IgG II Quant (Abbott) assay Results: One hundred fifty-six consecutive patients (76% females) treated at a single rheumatology center (mean age (range) 59.1 (21-83) years), mean (range) disease duration 10.8 (1-55) years), were recruited to the study. Thirty-five percents of patients received conventional synthetic (cs)DMARDs only, 64% biological/targeted synthetic (b/ts) DMARDs, 34% received combined treatment with csDMARDs and b/tsDMARDs and 32% corticosteroids (mean dose(range) 5.8mg(2.5-20mg) prednisone). One hundred thirty-seven patients (88%) were seropositive for IgG Ab against SARS CoV2 virus (median 2832.5 AU/ml, range 58-29499). Nineteen (12%) patients had negative tests, 11/19 were treated with B cell depleting agents. The reported side effects of the vaccine were minor (muscle sore, headache, low grade fever). The rheumatic disease remained stable in all patients. Conclusions: The vast majority of AIRD patients developed a significant humoral response following the administration of the second dose of the Pfeizer mRNA vaccine against SARS CoV2 virus.

Although child malnutrition rates have rapidly declined since 1962, today Jamaica experiences a double burden of malnutrition: the coexistence of pockets of high child malnutrition with rising levels of childhood obesity. Based on a wide range of sources, including public documents, newspaper reports, scientific studies and reports by international agencies, this article examines a gradual decline in child malnutrition and the rise of the double burden of malnutrition in Jamaica from independence to the present. It will first of all show that changes in the global economy and overseas loans and aid both aided and limited the ability of the Jamaican government to lower child malnutrition levels and also contributed to a rise in childhood obesity. Second, it will illustrate that a traditional deficit-led approach to child malnutrition was followed in post-independent Jamaica, focussing on the public and individuals as targets for intervention and using quantitative measures to trace progress. And third, it will question whether the double burden of child malnutrition will give rise to ‘healthy publics’—‘dynamic collectives of people, ideas and environments that can enable health and well-being’.","Altink, Henrice",Humanit Soc Sci Commun,437,16

One promising approach is the development of recombinant viral vaccines that are transmissible, and thus capable of self-dissemination through hard to reach populations of wild animals. Indeed, mathematical models demonstrate that transmissible vaccines can greatly reduce the effort required to control the spread of zoonotic pathogens in their animal reservoirs, thereby limiting the chances of human infection. A key challenge facing these new vaccines, however, is the inevitability of evolutionary change resulting from their ability to self-replicate and generate extended chains of transmission. Further, carrying immunogenic transgenes is often costly, in terms of metabolic burden, increased competition with the pathogen, or due to unintended interactions with the viral host regulatory network. As a result, natural selection is expected to favor vaccine strains that down-regulate or delete these transgenes resulting in increased rates of transmission and reduced efficacy against the target pathogen. In addition, efficacy and evolutionary stability will often be at odds; as when longer, more efficacious antigens experience faster rates of evolutionary decay. Here, we ask how such trade-offs influence the overall performance of transmissible vaccines. We find that evolutionary instability can substantially reduce performance, even for vaccine candidates with the ideal combination of efficacy and transmission. However, we find that, at least in some cases, vaccine stability and overall performance can be improved by the inclusion of a second, redundant antigen. Overall, our results suggest that the successful application of recombinant transmissible vaccines will require consideration of evolutionary dynamics and epistatic effects, as well as basic measurements of epidemiological features.","Layman, Nathan C; Tuschhoff, Beth M; Nuismer, Scott L",Virus Evol,437,8

Similarly, bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV) is causing severe, sometimes fatal, respiratory disease in calves. Both viruses are pneumovirus and the infections with human respiratory syncytial virus and BRSV have similar clinical, pathological, and epidemiological characteristics. In this study we used experimental BRSV infection in calves as a model of respiratory syncytial virus infection to demonstrate important aspects of viral replication and clearance in a natural target animal. Replication of BRSV was demonstrated in the luminal part of the respiratory epithelial cells and replication in the upper respiratory tract preceded the replication in the lower respiratory tract. Virus excreted to the lumen of the respiratory tract was cleared by neutrophils whereas apoptosis was an important way of clearance of BRSV-infected epithelial cells. Neighboring cells, which probably were epithelial cells, phagocytized the BRSV-infected apoptotic cells. The number of both CD4(+) and CD8+ T cells increased during the course of infection, but the T cells were not found between the epithelial cells of the bronchi up until apoptosis was no longer detected, thus in the bronchi there was no indication of direct contact-dependent T-cell-mediated cytotoxicity in the primary infection.","Viuff, Birgitte; Tjørnehøj, Kirsten; Larsen, Lars E.; Røntved, Christine M.; Uttenthal, Åse; Rønsholt, Leif; Alexandersen, Soren",The American journal of pathology,437,18

However, little is known about the physical and functional relationships between these proteins and the translation machinery. We describe a previously unknown type of diauxic shift-dependent modulation of the intracellular locations of Dhh1 and Pat1. Like the formation of P bodies, this phenomenon changes the spatial relationship between components involved in translation and mRNA degradation. We report significant spatial separation of Dhh1 and Pat1 from ribosomes in exponentially growing cells. Moreover, biochemical analyses reveal that these proteins are excluded from polysomal complexes in exponentially growing cells, indicating that they may not be associated with active states of the translation machinery. In contrast, under diauxic growth shift conditions, Dhh1 and Pat1 are found to co-localize with polysomal complexes. This work suggests that Dhh1 and Pat1 functions are modulated by a re-localization mechanism that involves eIF4A. Pull-down experiments reveal that the intracellular binding partners of Dhh1 and Pat1 change as cells undergo the diauxic growth shift. This reveals a new dimension to the relationship between translation activity and interactions between mRNA, the translation machinery and decapping activator proteins.","Drummond, Sheona P.; Hildyard, John; Firczuk, Helena; Reamtong, Onrapak; Li, Ning; Kannambath, Shichina; Claydon, Amy J.; Beynon, Robert J.; Eyers, Claire E.; McCarthy, John E.

Recombinant replication-defective adenovirus vectors (rADVs) infect mucosa surface and therefore can serve as a mucosal antigen delivery vehicle. In this study we examined whether s.l. immunization with rADV encoding spike protein (S) (rADV-S) of severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) induces protective immunity against SARS-CoV and could serve as a safe mucosal route for delivery of rADV. RESULTS: Here, we show that s.l. administration of rADV-S induced serum SARS-CoV neutralizing and airway IgA antibodies in mice. These antibody responses are comparable to those induced by intranasal (i.n.) administration. In addition, s.l. immunization induced antigen-specific CD8(+) T cell responses in the lungs that are superior to those induced by intramuscular immunization. Importantly, unlike i.n. administration, s.l. immunization with rADV did not redirect the rADV vector to the olfactory bulb. CONCLUSION: Our study indicates that s.l. immunization with rADV-S is safe and effective in induction of a broad spectrum of immune responses and presumably protection against infection with SARS-CoV.","Shim, Byoung-Shik; Stadler, Konrad; Nguyen, Huan Huu; Yun, Cheol-Heui; Kim, Dong Wook; Chang, Jun; Czerkinsky, Cecil; Song, Man Ki",Virol J,437,16

Here, we aim to identify a new panel of biomarkers including IgG subclasses, Rheumatoid Factor (RF), and Free Light Chains (FLC) that may result useful and reliable for clinical evaluation of HBV-related cryoglobulinemia. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed clinical data from 44 HBV positive patients. Patients were stratified on the presence/absence of mixed cryoglobulinemia in two group: 22 with cryoglobulins (CGs) and 22 without CGs. Samples from 20 healthy blood donors (HD) were used as negative controls. Serum samples were tested for IgG subclasses, RF (IgM, IgG, and IgA type), and FLC. RESULTS: We detected a strikingly different serum IgG subclasses distribution between HD and HBV positive patients together with different RF isotypes; FLC were significantly increased in HBV-patients if compared with HD while no significant difference was shown between HBV with/without MC.

Here we investigated the challenges faced by polypeptide segments of a non-vectorial β-barrel fold. Besides the biological interest behind the SARS coronavirus non-structural protein 1 (nsp1, 117 amino acids), this study model has two structural features that motivated its use in this work: 1- its recombinant production is dependent on the temperature, with greater solubility when expressed at low temperatures. This is an indication of the cotranslational guidance to the native protein conformation. 2- Conversely, nsp1 has a six-stranded, mixed parallel/antiparallel β-barrel with intricate long-range interactions, indicating it will need the full-length protein to fold properly. We used non-denaturing purification conditions that allowed the characterization of polypeptide chains of different lengths, mimicking the landscape of the cotranslational fold of a β-barrel, and avoiding the major technical hindrances of working with the nascent polypeptide bound to the ribosome. Our results showed partially folded states formed as soon as the amino acids of the second β-strand were present (55 amino acids). These partially folded states are different based on the length of polypeptide chain. The native α-helix (amino acids 24–37) was identified as a transient structure (~20–30% propensity). We identified the presence of regular secondary structure after the fourth native β-strand is present (89 amino acids), in parallel to the collapse to a non-native 3D structure. Interestingly the polypeptide sequences of the native strands β2, β3 and β4 have characteristics of α-helices. Our comprehensive analyses support the idea that incomplete polypeptide chains, such as the ones of nascent proteins much earlier than the end of the translation, adopt an abundance of specific transient folds, instead of disordered conformations.","Vazquez, Leonardo; e Lima, Luis Mauricio Trambaioli da Rocha; Almeida, Marcius da Silva",PLoS One,437,8

The main constituents in the terpene formulation used for the experiment were beta caryophyllene, eucalyptol, and citral. The tested formulation exhibited an antiviral effect when it was pre-incubated with the host cells prior to virus infection. The combination of NT-VRL-1 with CBD potentiated the antiviral effect better than the positive controls pyrazofurin and glycyrrhizin. There was a strong correlation between the quantitative results from a cell-viability assay and the cytopathic effect seen under the microscope after 72 h. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of activity of a combination of terpenes and CBD against a coronavirus.","Chatow, Lior; Nudel, Adi; Nesher, Iris; Hayo Hemo, David; Rozenberg, Perri; Voropaev, Hanna; Winkler, Ilan; Levy, Ronnie; Kerem, Zohar; Yaniv, Zohara; Eyal, Nadav",Life (Basel),437,7

Because coronavirus potentially diversifies by mutation, broadly neutralizing Abs are especially sought. Here, we report a possibly novel approach to rapid generation of potent broadly neutralizing human anti–SARS-CoV-2 Abs. We isolated SARS-CoV-2 spike protein–specific memory B cells by panning from the blood of convalescent subjects after infection with SARS-CoV-2 and sequenced and expressed Ig genes from individual B cells as human mAbs. All of 43 human mAbs generated in this way neutralized SARS-CoV-2. Eighteen of the forty-three human mAbs exhibited half-maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC(50)) of 6.7 × 10(–12) M to 6.7 × 10(–15) M for spike-pseudotyped virus. Seven of the human mAbs also neutralized (with IC(50) < 6.7 × 10(–12) M) viruses pseudotyped with mutant spike proteins (including receptor-binding domain mutants and the S1 C-terminal D614G mutant). Neutralization of the Wuhan Hu-1 founder strain and of some variants decreased when coding sequences were reverted to germline, suggesting that potency of neutralization was acquired by somatic hypermutation and selection of B cells. These results indicate that infection with SARS-CoV-2 evokes high-affinity B cell responses, some products of which are broadly neutralizing and others highly strain specific. We also identify variants that would potentially resist immunity evoked by infection with the Wuhan Hu-1 founder strain or by vaccines developed with products of that strain, suggesting evolutionary courses that SARS-CoV-2 could take.","de Mattos Barbosa, Mayara Garcia; Liu, Hui; Huynh, Daniel; Shelley, Greg; Keller, Evan T.; Emmer, Brian T.; Sherman, Emily; Ginsburg, David; Kennedy, Andrew A.; Tai, Andrew W.; Wobus, Christiane; Mirabeli, Carmen; Lanigan, Thomas M.; Samaniego, Milagros; Meng, Wenzhao; Rosenfeld, Aaron M.; Prak, Eline T.

In the period following, this infection spread all over the world. In March 2020 the World Health Organization announced the existence of a pandemic. The aim of this manuscript is to investigate skin diseases associated with COVID-19 under three main headings: skin problems related to personal protective equipment and personal hygiene measures, skin findings observed in SARS-CoV-2 virus infections, and skin findings due to COVID-19 treatment agents. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In PubMed, Google Scholar databases, skin lesions related to personal protective equipment and personal hygiene measures, skin findings observed in SARS-CoV-2 virus infections and skin findings due to COVID-19 treatment agents subjects are searched in detail. RESULTS: Pressure injury, contact dermatitis, itching, pressure urticaria, exacerbation of preexisting skin diseases, and new skin lesion occurrence/new skin disease occurrence may be due to personal protective equipment. Skin problems related to personal hygiene measures could include itching, dryness, and contact dermatitis. Skin findings may also be observed in SARS-CoV-2 virus infections. The incidence of skin lesions due to COVID-19 was reported to be between 0.2% and 29%. Many skin lesions including maculopapular, urticarial, vesicular, chilblain-like, thrombotic/ischemic, etc. are observed in COVID-19 patients. Some authors have stated that there is an absence of SARS-CoV-2 virus infection-specific skin findings. However, in asymptomatic or presymptomatic COVID-19 patients in particular, skin lesions can lead to the diagnosis of COVID-19. In addition, skin lesions may occur due to COVID-19 treatment agents. CONCLUSION: Many skin lesions may appear as a result of COVID-19. Even in the absence of a COVID-19 diagnosis, skin findings should be evaluated carefully in this pandemic period.","GÜL, Ülker",Turk J Med Sci,437,22

Méthode : Il s‘agit d’une enquête en ligne anonyme avec méthodologie associant des analyses quantitatives et qualitatives. Les questions ciblaient plusieurs thèmes tels que le contexte de vie, le vécu émotionnel et les répercussions sur les habitudes quotidiennes chez les enfants et adolescents, tels que perçus par les parents. Résultats : Au total, 439 parents ont répondu au questionnaire. Les familles sont globalement restées dans leur lieu de vie habituel et ont réussi à bien s’adapter. En moyenne, le niveau d’inquiétude des enfants (estimé par les parents) était moins élevé que celui que les parents s’attribuent. L’état psychologique des enfants et adolescents était globalement stable mais pour ceux qui ont vécu davantage d’émotions négatives que d’habitude, il s’agissait d’une augmentation de l’ennui, de l’irritabilité et de la colère. Une baisse de la qualité de sommeil a aussi été constatée par un tiers des répondants. En revanche, une progression de l’autonomie a été soulignée. Les parents ont aussi rapporté une amélioration des relations familiales, mais aux dépens des liens sociaux habituels induisant un sentiment de privation. Conclusion : Malgré des émotions négatives ressenties chez certains enfants, le confinement a permis de développer de nouvelles ressources dans la plupart des familles. Certains facteurs rapportés, tels que le renforcement des liens, pourraient être des facteurs protecteurs et constituent de bonnes pistes dans les interventions à proposer aux enfants et leur famille. Objectives: The aim of this study is to understand the changes within families during confinement motivated by the COVID-19 pandemic and to explore the psycho-emotional experiences of children and their parents in this new situation. Confinement necessarily induced significant changes in daily family routines, particularly for work, education, leisure and social activities. In the more vulnerable pediatric population, several authors have warned of the need to consider the impact of lockdown measures during COVID-19 on the psychological impact and well-being. Method: This is an anonymous online survey with methodology combining quantitative and qualitative analyses. The questions targeted several themes such as life context, emotional experience and the impact on daily habits in children and adolescents, as perceived by parents. Participants are adults and parents of at least one child. They were recruited through social media and email. Results: A total of 439 parents responded to the questionnaire. The families generally stayed in their usual place of residence and managed to adapt well. On average, the children's level of worry (as estimated by parents) was lower than the level of worry parents attributed to themselves. For the majority, the parents did not observe any change, the psychological state of the children and adolescents was generally stable, but for those who experienced more negative emotions than usual, it was an increase in boredom, irritability and anger. A decrease in the quality of sleep was also observed by a third of the respondents. On the other hand, an increase in autonomy was noted. Regarding the quality of family cohabitation, an important result showed that confinement had improved family relationships for 41 % parents but at the expense of usual social ties inducing a feeling of deprivation. Indeed, the participants evoke a lack of ""social link"" and ""social contact with friends"". Lack became synonymous with absence, a feeling of loneliness and separation. Conclusion: Our results confirm European and international data collected in children in countries where strict lockdown measures have been applied. Despite the negative emotions felt in some children, confinement has helped develop new resources in most families. Families seem to have been successful in maintaining a stable and secure routine which has certainly been a protective factor against anxiety. Some reported factors, such as bonding, could be protective factors and constitute good leads in interventions to be offered to children and their families.","Zebdi, Rafika; Plateau, Eve; Delalandre, Alicia; Vanwalleghem, Stéphanie; Chahed, Myriam; Hentati, Yassamine; Chaudoye, Guillemine; Moreau, Elodie; Lignier, Baptiste",Encephale,437,1

Importantly, social inequities have not been adequately addressed and current public policies are not reflective of the needs of diverse populations. Public participation in decision-making is crucial and there is, therefore, a pressing need to increase diversity of representation in patient partnerships in order to prevent the further exclusion of socially marginalized groups from research and policy making. Deliberate effort and affirmative action are needed to meaningfully engage and nurture diverse patient partnerships by broadening the scope of the patient community to include excluded or underrepresented individuals or groups. This will help us co-develop ways to enhance access and equity in healthcare and prevent the systematic reproduction of structural inequalities that have already been heightened by the COVID-19 pandemic.","Sayani, Ambreen; Maybee, Alies; Manthorne, Jackie; Nicholson, Erika; Bloch, Gary; Parsons, Janet A.; Hwang, Stephen W.; Lofters, Aisha",Healthc Policy,437,1

AIM: The present study aimed to investigate the predictive value of C-reactive protein/albumin ratio (CAR) for in-hospital mortality in patients with COVID-19. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This retrospective study included the data of 275 consecutive COVID-19 patients who were hospitalized in a referral pandemic center. The CAR ratio was obtained by dividing the CRP level with albumin level. The study population was divided into tertiles (T1, T2, and T3) according to their admission CAR values. The endpoint of the study was a composite outcome of in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: During the in-hospital course, 33 (12%) patients died. The patients classified into T3 group had significantly higher CAR compared those classified into T2 and T1 groups. After the adjustment for the confounders, T3 group had 8.2 (95% CI: 4.2–48.1) times higher rates of in-hospital mortality compared to T1 group (the reference group) in a logistic regression model using CAR values. CONCLUSION: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate the predictive value of CAR for in-hospital mortality in COVID-19 patients.","Güney, Başak Çakır; Taştan, Yeşim Önal; Doğantekin, Betül; Serindağ, Zeliha; Yeniçeri, Murat; Çiçek, Vedat; Kılıç, Şahhan; Şeker, Mehmet; Çınar, Tufan; Hayiroglu, Mert İlker; Kaplan, Mustafa",Arch Med Res,437,22

These centers quickly became overcrowded, leading to high parasitism environmental contamination, to the easy spread of parasitic infections and to increased risks to public health. The prevalence of intestinal parasites was evaluated by examination of dog faecal sample, in the municipal control animal centre of Guimarães (north Portugal), identifying risk factors and transmission to man. The overall prevalence of gastrointestinal helminths was 57.2% (95% confidence interval 41.3–71.9%) and observed helminths of the gastrointestinal tract were recorded: Ancylostoma caninum (33%), Toxocara canis (29%), Dipylidium caninum (6%), Capillaria spp. (3%), Trichuris vulpis (1.66%). It is important to point out that young dogs were significantly infected more frequently (p ≤ 0.1) than non-sterilized females and the higher occurrence of nematode infection occurred at the new arrival of stray dogs, in the third collection. With impact on public health, the higher prevalence (p ≤ 0.1) of T. canis in young dogs suggests the existence of real risk for human infection and demonstrate the necessity for a parasite control programme reinforcement at the municipal dog shelter.","Silva, Vanessa; Silva, Joana; Gonçalves, Margarida; Brandão, Carlos; Vieira e Brito, Nuno",J Parasit Dis,437,1
