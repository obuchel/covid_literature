485,485,485,Pathological and ultrastructural analysis of surgical lung biopsies in patients with swine‐origin influenza type A/H1N1 and acute respiratory failure,17.44517,10.276186,2010-12-11,"BACKGROUND: Cases of H1N1 and other pulmonary infections evolve to acute respiratory failure and death when co‐infections or lung injury predominate over the immune response, thus requiring early diagnosis to improve treatment. OBJECTIVE: To perform a detailed histopathological analysis of the open lung biopsy specimens from five patients with ARDS with confirmed H1N1. METHODS: Lung specimens underwent microbiologic analysis, and examination by optical and electron microscopy. Immunophenotyping was used to characterize macrophages, natural killer, T and B cells, and expression of cytokines and iNOS. RESULTS: The pathological features observed were necrotizing bronchiolitis, diffuse alveolar damage, alveolar hemorrhage and abnormal immune response. Ultrastructural analysis showed viral‐like particles in all cases. CONCLUSIONS: Viral‐like particles can be successfully demonstrated in lung tissue by ultrastructural examination, without confirmation of the virus by RT‐PCR on nasopharyngeal aspirates. Bronchioles and epithelium, rather than endothelium, are probably the primary target of infection, and diffuse alveolar damage the consequence of the effect of airways obliteration and dysfunction on innate immunity, suggesting that treatment should be focused on epithelial repair.","Capelozzi, Vera Luiza; Parra, Edwin Roger; Ximenes, Manoel; Bammann, Ricardo Helbert; Barbas, Carmen Silvia Valente; Duarte, Marid Irmd Seixas",Clinics (Sao Paulo),195,1
1065,1065,1065,Risk factors for the development of acute lung injury in patients with infectious pneumonia,17.346182,10.300185,2012-03-14,"INTRODUCTION: Although pneumonia has been identified as the single most common risk factor for acute lung injury (ALI), we have a limited knowledge as to why ALI develops in some patients with pneumonia and not in others. The objective of this study was to determine frequency, risk factors, and outcome of ALI in patients with infectious pneumonia. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study of adult patients with microbiologically positive pneumonia, hospitalized at two Mayo Clinic Rochester hospitals between January 1, 2005, and December 31, 2007. In a subsequent nested case-control analysis, we evaluated the differences in prehospital and intrahospital exposures between patients with and without ALI/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) matched by specific pathogen, isolation site, gender, and closest age in a 1:1 manner. RESULTS: The study included 596 patients; 365 (61.2%) were men. The median age was 65 (IQR, 53 to 75) years. In total, 171 patients (28.7%) were diagnosed with ALI. The occurrence of ALI was less frequent in bacterial (n = 99 of 412, 24%) compared with viral (n = 19 of 55, 35%), fungal (n = 39 of 95, 41%), and mixed isolates pneumonias (n = 14 of 34, 41%; P = 0.002). After adjusting for baseline severity of illness and comorbidities, patients in whom ALI developed had a markedly increased risk of hospital death (OR(adj )9.7; 95% CI, 6.0 to 15.9). In a nested case-control study, presence of shock (OR, 8.9; 95% CI, 2.8 to 45.9), inappropriate initial antimicrobial treatment (OR, 3.2; 95% CI, 1.3 to 8.5), and transfusions (OR, 4.8; 95% CI, 1.5 to 19.6) independently predicted ALI development. CONCLUSIONS: The development of ALI among patients hospitalized with infectious pneumonia varied among pulmonary pathogens and was associated with increased mortality. Inappropriate initial antimicrobial treatment and transfusion predict the development of ALI independent of pathogen.","Kojicic, Marija; Li, Guangxi; Hanson, Andrew C; Lee, Kun-Moo; Thakur, Lokendra; Vedre, Jayanth; Ahmed, Adil; Baddour, Larry M; Ryu, Jay H; Gajic, Ognjen",Crit Care,195,12
2365,2365,2365,Lower serum uric acid level predicts mortality in dialysis patients,17.094671,9.945832,2016-06-17,"We evaluated the impact of serum uric acid (SUA) on mortality in patients with chronic dialysis. A total of 4132 adult patients on dialysis were enrolled prospectively between August 2008 and September 2014. Among them, we included 1738 patients who maintained dialysis for at least 3 months and had available SUA in the database. We categorized the time averaged-SUA (TA-SUA) into 5 groups: <5.5, 5.5–6.4, 6.5–7.4, 7.5–8.4, and ≥8.5 mg/dL. Cox regression analysis was used to calculate the hazard ratio (HR) of all-cause mortality according to SUA group. The mean TA-SUA level was slightly higher in men than in women. Patients with lower TA-SUA level tended to have lower body mass index (BMI), phosphorus, serum albumin level, higher proportion of diabetes mellitus (DM), and higher proportion of malnourishment on the subjective global assessment (SGA). During a median follow-up of 43.9 months, 206 patients died. Patients with the highest SUA had a similar risk to the middle 3 TA-SUA groups, but the lowest TA-SUA group had a significantly elevated HR for mortality. The lowest TA-SUA group was significantly associated with increased all-cause mortality (adjusted HR, 1.720; 95% confidence interval, 1.007–2.937; P = 0.047) even after adjusting for demographic, comorbid, nutritional covariables, and medication use that could affect SUA levels. This association was prominent in patients with well nourishment on the SGA, a preserved serum albumin level, a higher BMI, and concomitant DM although these parameters had no significant interaction in the TA-SUA-mortality relationship except DM. In conclusion, a lower TA-SUA level <5.5 mg/dL predicted all-cause mortality in patients with chronic dialysis.","Bae, Eunjin; Cho, Hyun-Jeong; Shin, Nara; Kim, Sun Moon; Yang, Seung Hee; Kim, Dong Ki; Kim, Yong-Lim; Kang, Shin-Wook; Yang, Chul Woo; Kim, Nam Ho; Kim, Yon Su; Lee, Hajeong",Medicine (Baltimore),195,19
2592,2592,2592,Surfactant protein-D (SP-D) gene polymorphisms and serum level as predictors of susceptibility and prognosis of acute kidney injury in the Chinese population,17.101406,10.19123,2017-02-17,"BACKGROUND: Injury to the kidney epithelial barrier is a characteristic feature of acute kidney injury (AKI). Serum surfactant protein-D (SP-D), a known biomarker of damaged alveolar epithelium, is also secreted by renal tubular epithelial cells. Therefore, the aim of this study was to examine the possible association of SP-D with AKI susceptibility and prognosis. METHODS: In this study, 159 AKI patients and 120 healthy individuals were included. SP-D polymorphisms Thr11Met and Thr160Ala, AKI patient serum SP-D levels at days 1, 3 and 7 and urine KIM-1 levels in both AKI patients and controls were examined. The obtained results were correlated with the AKI stage, duration of renal replacement therapy (RRT) and prognosis. RESULTS: Serum SP-D level in AKI patients was higher than controls (p < 0.01). SP-D 11Thr/Thr genotype was more frequent in AKI patients than in controls (p < 0.01). Furthermore, AKI patients with SP-D 11Thr/Thr genotype had significantly higher serum SP-D levels (p < 0.05) compared to other genotypes. Serum SP-D levels corrected to the progression of AKI with a peak at day 3. Furthermore, the SP-D 11Thr/Thr genotype frequency and baseline serum SP-D level were higher in patients who subsequently died. Baseline serum SP-D levels positively correlated with the urine KIM-1 levels, AKI stage and RRT duration. CONCLUSION: In our study, elevated serum SP-D was associated with worse AKI clinical outcomes and patients with SP-D 11Thr/Thr genotype were more susceptible to AKI. Collectively, these findings suggest that SP-D may be useful as a biomarker of AKI susceptibility and prognosis.","Liu, Jiao; Li, Guang; Li, Lianghai; Liu, Zhiyong; Zhou, Qingshan; Wang, Guirong; Chen, Dechang",BMC Nephrol,195,1
2998,2998,2998,Role of microRNAs in doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity: an overview of preclinical models and cancer patients,17.19642,10.040884,2017-09-25,"Cardiotoxicity is a well-known side effect of doxorubicin (DOX), but the mechanisms leading to this phenomenon are still not completely clear. Prediction of drug-induced dysfunction onset is difficult and is still largely based on detection of cardiac troponin (cTn), a circulating marker of heart damage. In the last years, several investigations focused on the possible involvement of microRNAs (miRNAs) in DOX-induced toxicity in vitro, with contrasting results. Recently, several groups employed animal models to mimic patient’s condition, investigate the biological pathways perturbed by DOX, and identify diagnostic markers of cardiotoxicity. We reviewed the results from several studies investigating cardiac miRNAs expression in rodent models of DOX-treatment. We also discussed the data from two publications indicating the possible use of circulating miRNA as biomarkers of DOX-induced cardiotoxicity. Unfortunately, limited information was derived from these studies, as selection methods of candidate-miRNAs and heterogeneity in cardiotoxicity assessment greatly hampered the novelty and robustness of the findings. Nevertheless, at least one circulating miRNA, miR-1, showed a good potential as early biomarker of drug-mediated cardiac dysfunction onset. The use of animal models to investigate DOX-induced cardiotoxicity surely helps narrowing the gap between basic research and clinical practice. Despite this, several issues, including selection of relevant miRNAs and less-than-optimal assessment of cardiotoxicity, greatly limited the results obtained so far. Nonetheless, the association of patients-based studies with the use of preclinical models may be the key to address the many unanswered questions regarding the pathophysiology and early detection of cardiotoxicity.","Ruggeri, Clarissa; Gioffré, Sonia; Achilli, Felice; Colombo, Gualtiero I.; D’Alessandra, Yuri",Heart Fail Rev,195,1
3130,3130,3130,Ventilator Dependence Risk Score for the Prediction of Prolonged Mechanical Ventilation in Patients Who Survive Sepsis/Septic Shock with Respiratory Failure,17.379143,10.079446,2018-04-04,"We intended to develop a scoring system to predict mechanical ventilator dependence in patients who survive sepsis/septic shock with respiratory failure. This study evaluated 251 adult patients in medical intensive care units (ICUs) between August 2013 to October 2015, who had survived for over 21 days and received aggressive treatment. The risk factors for ventilator dependence were determined. We then constructed a ventilator dependence (VD) risk score using the identified risk factors. The ventilator dependence risk score was calculated as the sum of the following four variables after being adjusted by proportion to the beta coefficient. We assigned a history of previous stroke, a score of one point, platelet count less than 150,000/μL a score of one point, pH value less than 7.35 a score of two points, and the fraction of inspired oxygen on admission day 7 over 39% as two points. The area under the curve in the derivation group was 0.725 (p < 0.001). We then applied the VD risk score for validation on 175 patients. The area under the curve in the validation group was 0.658 (p = 0.001). VD risk score could be applied to predict prolonged mechanical ventilation in patients who survive sepsis/septic shock.","Chang, Ya-Chun; Huang, Kuo-Tung; Chen, Yu-Mu; Wang, Chin-Chou; Wang, Yi-Hsi; Tseng, Chia-Cheng; Lin, Meng-Chih; Fang, Wen-Feng",Sci Rep,195,1
3227,3227,3227,Risk factors for infectious complications of ANCA-associated vasculitis: a cohort study,17.17017,9.828677,2018-06-14,"BACKGROUND: Severe infections are common complications of immunosuppressive treatment for antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis (AAV) with renal involvement. We investigated the clinical characteristics and risk factors of severe infection in Chinese patients with AAV after immunosuppressive therapy. METHODS: A total of 248 patients with a new diagnosis of ANCA-associated vasculitis were included in this study. The incidence, time, site, and risk factors of severe infection by the induction therapies were analysed. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards models were used to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). RESULTS: A total of 103 episodes of severe infection were identified in 86 (34.7%, 86/248) patients during a median follow-up of 15 months. The incidence of infection during induction therapy was 38.5% for corticosteroids (CS), 39.0% for CS+ intravenous cyclophosphamide (IV-CYC), 33.8% for CS+ mycophenolate mofetil and 22.5% for CS + tripterygium glycosides, 76 (73.8%) infection episodes occurred within 6 months, while 66 (64.1%) occurred within 3 months. Pneumonia (71.8%, 74/103) was the most frequent type of infection, and the main pathogenic spectrum included bacteria (78.6%), fungi (12.6%), and viruses (8.7%). The risk factors associated with infection were age at the time of diagnosis (HR = 1.003, 95% CI = 1.000–1.006), smoking (HR = 2.338, 95% CI = 1.236–4.424), baseline secrum creatinine (SCr) ≥5.74 mg/dl (HR = 2.153, 95% CI = 1.323–3.502), CD4(+) T cell< 281 μl (HR = 1.813, 95% CI = 1.133–2.900), and intravenous cyclophosphamide regimen (HR = 1.951, 95% CI =1.520–2.740). Twelve (13.9%) patients died of severe pneumonia. CONCLUSION: The infection rate during induction therapy was high in patients with AAV. Bacterial pneumonia was the main type of infection encountered. Age at the time of diagnosis, smoking, baseline SCr ≥5.74 mg/dl, CD4(+) T cell< 281 μl, and IV-CYC therapy were identified as risk factors for infection.","Yang, Liu; Xie, Honglang; Liu, Zhengzhao; Chen, Yinghua; Wang, Jinquan; Zhang, Haitao; Ge, Yongchun; Hu, Weixin",BMC Nephrol,195,1
3651,3651,3651,Invasive and non-invasive diagnostic approaches for microbiological diagnosis of hospital-acquired pneumonia,16.954977,10.144886,2019-02-18,"BACKGROUND: Data on the methods used for microbiological diagnosis of hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) are mainly extrapolated from ventilator-associated pneumonia. HAP poses additional challenges for respiratory sampling, and the utility of sputum or distal sampling in HAP has not been comprehensively evaluated, particularly in HAP admitted to the ICU. METHODS: We analyzed 200 patients with HAP from six ICUs in a teaching hospital in Barcelona, Spain. The respiratory sampling methods used were divided into non-invasive [sputum and endotracheal aspirate (EAT)] and invasive [fiberoptic-bronchoscopy aspirate (FBAS), and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL)]. RESULTS: A median of three diagnostic methods were applied [range 2–4]. At least one respiratory sampling method was applied in 93% of patients, and two or more were applied in 40%. Microbiological diagnosis was achieved in 99 (50%) patients, 69 (70%) by only one method (42% FBAS, 23% EAT, 15% sputum, 9% BAL, 7% blood culture, and 4% urinary antigen). Seventy-eight (39%) patients underwent a fiberoptic-bronchoscopy when not receiving mechanical ventilation. Higher rates of microbiological diagnosis were observed in the invasive group (56 vs. 39%, p = 0.018). Patients with microbiological diagnosis more frequently presented changes in their empirical antibiotic scheme, mainly de-escalation. CONCLUSIONS: A comprehensive approach might be undertaken for microbiological diagnosis in critically ill nonventilated HAP. Sputum sampling determined one third of microbiological diagnosis in HAP patients who were not subsequently intubated. Invasive methods were associated with higher rates of microbiological diagnosis.

4259,4259,4259,Multi-level transcriptome sequencing identifies COL1A1 as a candidate marker in human heart failure progression,17.20913,10.356041,2020-01-06,"BACKGROUND: Heart failure (HF) has been recognized as a global pandemic with a high rate of hospitalization, morbidity, and mortality. Although numerous advances have been made, its representative molecular signatures remain largely unknown, especially the role of genes in HF progression. The aim of the present prospective follow-up study was to reveal potential biomarkers associated with the progression of heart failure. METHODS: We generated multi-level transcriptomic data from a cohort of left ventricular heart tissue collected from 21 HF patients and 9 healthy donors. By using Masson staining to calculate the fibrosis percentage for each sample, we applied lasso regression model to identify the genes associated with fibrosis as well as progression. The genes were further validated by immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining in the same cohort and qRT-PCR using another independent cohort (20 HF and 9 healthy donors). Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to measure the plasma level in a validation cohort (139 HF patients) for predicting HF progression. RESULTS: Based on the multi-level transcriptomic data, we examined differentially expressed genes [mRNAs, microRNAs, and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs)] in the study cohort. The follow-up functional annotation and regulatory network analyses revealed their potential roles in regulating extracellular matrix. We further identified several genes that were associated with fibrosis. By using the survival time before transplantation, COL1A1 was identified as a potential biomarker for HF progression and its upregulation was confirmed by both IHC and qRT-PCR. Furthermore, COL1A1 content ≥ 256.5 ng/ml in plasma was found to be associated with poor survival within 1 year of heart transplantation from heart failure [hazard ratio (HR) 7.4, 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.5 to 15.8, Log-rank p value < 1.0 × 10(− 4)]. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggested that COL1A1 might be a plasma biomarker of HF and associated with HF progression, especially to predict the 1-year survival from HF onset to transplantation.","Hua, Xiumeng; Wang, Yin-Ying; Jia, Peilin; Xiong, Qing; Hu, Yiqing; Chang, Yuan; Lai, Songqing; Xu, Yong; Zhao, Zhongming; Song, Jiangping",BMC Med,195,11

This paper reviews the state of America’s children and families, highlighting the influence of stressful contextual and social conditions on child and family well-being and the concentration of disadvantage in numerous neighborhoods and communities throughout the nation. It then briefly reviews the progress that has been made in pinpointing policies that can reduce stressful contextual conditions such as poverty, discrimination, and the marketing of unhealthful foods and substances. It also describes numerous family and school interventions that have proven benefit in preventing psychological and behavioral problems as diverse as tobacco, alcohol, and other drug use; depression; antisocial behavior; academic failure; obesity prevention; and early childbearing. We argue that progress in translating existing knowledge into widespread benefit will require a nationwide effort to intervene comprehensively in neighborhoods and communities of concentrated disadvantage. We present a strategic plan for how such an effort could be organized. The first step in this organizing would be the creation of a broad and diverse coalition of organizations concerned with advancing public health and well-being. Such a coalition could increase public support both for the policies needed to focus on these disadvantaged areas and the research needed to incrementally improve our ability to help these areas.","Biglan, Anthony; Elfner, Karen; Garbacz, S.

I searched various papers and books related to the in silico prediction of chemical toxicity and carcinogenicity. The intention was to utilize the most recent reports after 2015 regarding in silico prediction. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The application of in silico methods is increasing with the prediction of toxic risks to human and the environment. The various toxic effects of industrial chemicals have triggered the recognition of the importance of using a combination of in silico models in the risk assessments. In silico occupational exposure models, industrial accidents, and occupational cancers are effectively managed and chemicals evaluated.

The continued use of corticosteroids, in addition to the rise of combination immunosuppressive therapy, has contributed to the ongoing concern for infection. Perhaps the most feared infection in IIM patients is Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP) given its infrequent occurrence yet high mortality. The field has been, and continues to be, without evidence-based guidelines to help clinicians determine which patients with IIM to prescribe prophylaxis. Herein, we review this literature to provide the clinician with an up-to-date view of infections in IIM. RECENT FINDINGS: In the past 5 years, a number of studies have been reported highlighting various infectious complications, which help us better understand their frequency and associated risk factors. In addition, data has been published on the potential harms of PJP prophylaxis, to better inform the risk/benefit of our decision-making. SUMMARY: Infection remains a major contributor to morbidity and mortality in IIM. A better understanding of which patient subgroups are at risk for particular infections will inform optimal management strategies.","Mecoli, Christopher A.; Danoff, Sonye K.",Curr Rheumatol Rep,195,31

DESIGN: In this retrospective pre–post analysis, outcomes were compared in two preterm infant groups (≤32 weeks gestation). Infants in Group 1 were orally fed while on NCPAP, while infants in Group 2 were only allowed oral feedings after ceasing NCPAP. RESULTS: Although infants in Group 2 started feeds at a later postmenstrual age (PMA), they reached full oral feeding at a similar PMA compared with Group 1. Interestingly, there was a positive correlation between the duration of oral feeding while on NCPAP and the time spent on respiratory support in Group 1. CONCLUSIONS: Delayed oral feeding until ceasing NCPAP did not contribute to feeding-related morbidities. We recommend caution when initiating oral feedings in preterm infants on NCPAP without evaluating the safety of the infants and their readiness for oral feedings.","Dumpa, Vikramaditya; Kamity, Ranjith; Ferrara, Louisa; Akerman, Meredith; Hanna, Nazeeh",J Perinatol,195,1

TRIAL DESIGN: The study is designed as a multi-center, interventional, parallel-group, randomized (1:1 ratio), investigator-sponsored, two-arm study. PARTICIPANTS: Patients and inpatients will be recruited from 8 Japanese academic and non-academic hospitals. The inclusion and exclusion criteria are as follows: Inclusion criteria 1. Diagnosed as positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). 2. Clinical stages of mild-to-moderate COVID-19. 3. Symptomatic; 4. ≥ 20 years of age. 5. Male or female. 6. Ability to communicate in Japanese. 7. Outpatients and inpatients. 8. Provided informed consent. Exclusion criteria 1. Difficulty in providing informed consent due to dementia, psychosis, or psychiatric symptoms. 2. Allergic to Kampo or Western medicines used in this study. 3. Pregnant and lactating. 4. Unable to follow up. 5. Participating in another clinical trial or interventional study. 6. Hypokalemic or taking oral furosemide or steroids. 7. Determined unsuitable for this study by the physician. INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: Patients in the control group will receive conventional treatment with antipyretics, painkillers, or antitussives for symptoms that occurred after they contracted the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Patients in the Kampo group will receive 2.5 g of KT (TJ-1@TSUMURA and Co.) and 2.5 g of SSKKS (TJ-109@TSUMURA and Co.) 3 times a day, orally, for 14 days in addition to the conventional treatment as mentioned above. MAIN OUTCOMES: The number of days till at least one of the symptoms (fever, cough, sputum, malaise, shortness of breath) improves in the first 14 days of treatment. To assess the cough, sputum, malaise, and shortness of breath, a numeric rating scale will be used to define improvement in terms of a 2-point decrease in the number of days from the start of treatment for at least 2 days. Fever will be defined as an improvement when the temperature is less than 37 °C. RANDOMIZATION: Patients are randomized (1:1 ratio) to each group using the minimization method, with balancing of the arms with severity of disease stage and patient age (< 65, 65 to < 75, or ≥ 75 years). Computer-generated random numbers will be used for the minimization method. BLINDING (MASKING): Open-label with no blinding NUMBERS TO BE RANDOMIZED (SAMPLE SIZE): The main research hypothesis of this study is that the combination of Kampo medicine and conventional treatment will significantly improve the patients’ symptoms (fever, fatigue, cough, sputum, and shortness of breath) during the first 14 days of treatment as compared with conventional treatment alone. Concerning the analysis of the primary endpoint, the duration of time before improvement of at least one of the common cold-like symptoms (fever, malaise, cough, sputum, and shortness of breath) will be estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method, and the survival curves will be compared between groups using the log-rank test. Assuming this method of analysis and based on previous studies reporting the efficacy of Kampo medicine for COVID-19 and H1N1 influenza patients, the median survival time in the Kampo medicine group is estimated as 3 days; this time will be 1.5 times longer in the control group. Assuming a one-sided significance level of 5%, a power of 70%, and an allocation ratio of 1:1, the required sample size is calculated as 126 cases. To compensate for a loss in follow-up, we plan to include 150 cases in both groups (Kampo group = 75, control group = 75).

In order to develop novel consumer-liked dry aged sheepmeat products, an innovation process aligned with design thinking principles was initiated. The objective was to understand optimal dry aged sheepmeat product formats from chef, butcher, producer and consumer perspectives, and use these findings to develop “highly liked” and “premium” dry aged cull ewe meat dishes. The methodology used and the results of stakeholder engagement, perceptual mapping, and quantitative consumer assessments are reported. Stakeholder engagement showed the importance of how novel products are introduced to the consumer and to the chef. Perceptual mapping highlighted that chef-perceived product “premiumness” was driven by eating quality and complexity of the dish. Consumer assessment validated these findings with increases in dish liking associated with increased premiumness and complexity in dish presentation. Overall, the described approach was successful; eight highly liked dry aged cull ewe meat dishes were developed (all scored > 7.69 on a 9-point hedonic scale for liking), and four of the eight dishes were rated “at the level of a very premium food”.","Hastie, Melindee; Ashman, Hollis; Lyman, Dale; Lockstone-Binney, Leonie; Jacob, Robin; Ha, Minh; Torrico, Damir; Warner, Robyn",Foods,195,1

T cells are key players in viral clearance, and these cells migrate from peripheral blood into the central nervous system upon infection. Several factors contribute to T cell migration, including the expression of chemokines in the inflamed tissue that attract T cells through their expression of chemokine receptors. Here we investigated CD8(+) T cell profile in the spinal cord in a mouse model of herpes simplex virus type 2 neuroinflammation. Mice were infected with HSV-2 and sacrificed when showing signs of neuroinflammation. Cells and/or tissue from spinal cord, spleen, and blood were analyzed for expression of activation markers, chemokine receptors, and chemokines. High numbers of CD8(+) T cells were present in the spinal cord following genital HSV-2-infection. CD8(+) T cells were highly activated and HSV-2 glycoprotein B -specific effector cells, some of which showed signs of recent degranulation. They also expressed high levels of many chemokine receptors, in particular CCR2, CCR4, CCR5, and CXCR3. Investigating corresponding receptor ligands in spinal cord tissue revealed markedly increased expression of the cognate ligands CCL2, CCL5, CCL8, CCL12, and CXCL10. This study shows that during herpesvirus neuroinflammation anti-viral CD8(+) T cells accumulate in the CNS. CD8(+) T cells in the CNS also express chemotactic receptors cognate to the chemotactic gradients in the spinal cord. This indicates that anti-viral CD8(+) T cells may migrate to infected areas in the spinal cord during herpesvirus neuroinflammation in response to chemotactic gradients.","Lind, Liza; Svensson, Alexandra; Thörn, Karolina; Krzyzowska, Malgorzata; Eriksson, Kristina",J Neurovirol,195,1

Moench) is a popular native North American herbal plant. Its major bioactive compound, chicoric acid, is reported to have various potential physiological functions, but little is known about its biosynthesis. Here, taking an activity-guided approach, we identify two cytosolic BAHD acyltransferases that form two intermediates, caftaric acid and chlorogenic acid. Surprisingly, a unique serine carboxypeptidase-like acyltransferase uses chlorogenic acid as its acyl donor and caftaric acid as its acyl acceptor to produce chicoric acid in vacuoles, which has evolved its acyl donor specificity from the better-known 1-O-β-D-glucose esters typical for this specific type of acyltransferase to chlorogenic acid. This unusual pathway seems unique to Echinacea species suggesting convergent evolution of chicoric acid biosynthesis. Using these identified acyltransferases, we have reconstituted chicoric acid biosynthesis in tobacco. Our results emphasize the flexibility of acyltransferases and their roles in the evolution of specialized metabolism in plants.","Fu, Rao; Zhang, Pingyu; Jin, Ge; Wang, Lianglei; Qi, Shiqian; Cao, Yang; Martin, Cathie; Zhang, Yang",Nat Commun,195,1

Gardnerella spp. belonging to cpn60 subgroup D, are detected at low levels in vaginal microbiomes and are nutritional generalists relative to other more abundant Gardnerella spp., making them good candidates for negative frequency-dependent selection. The vaginal microbiome is a dynamic environment, and the resulting changes in density of the microbiota may explain why subgroup D never gains dominance. To test this, we co-cultured subgroup D isolates with isolates from the more common and abundant subgroup C. Deep amplicon sequencing of rpoB was used to determine proportional abundance of each isolate at 0 h and 72 h in 152 co-cultures and to calculate change in proportion. D isolates had a positive change in proportional abundance in most co-cultures regardless of initial proportion. Initial density affected the change in proportion of subgroup D isolates either positively or negatively depending on the particular isolates combined, suggesting that growth rate, population density and other intrinsic features of the isolates influenced the outcome. Our results demonstrate that population density is an important factor influencing the outcome of competition between Gardnerella spp. isolated from the human vaginal microbiome.

Due to veterinary and public health significance, these HPAIVs, as well as low pathogenicity (LP) H5-subtype AIVs having a propensity to mutate into HP viruses, are under epidemiologic surveillance and must be reported to the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE). Our previous work provided a unique panel of 6 different monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against H5 hemagglutinin (HA), which meets the demand for high-specificity tools for monitoring AIV infection and vaccination in poultry. In this study, we selected one of these mAbs to develop an epitope-blocking (EB) ELISA for detecting H5 subtype-specific antibodies in chicken sera (H5 EB-ELISA). METHODS: In the H5 EB-ELISA, H5 HA protein produced in a baculovirus-expression vector system was employed as a coating antigen, and the G-7-27-18 mAb was employed as a blocking antibody. The performance characteristics of the assay were evaluated by testing 358 sera from nonimmunized chickens and chickens immunized with AIVs of the H1–H16 subtypes or recombinant H5 HA antigen to obtain the reference and experimental antisera, respectively. The samples were classified as anti-H5 HA positive or negative based on the results of the hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay, the gold standard in subtype-specific serodiagnosis. RESULTS: The H5 EB-ELISA correctly discriminated between the anti-H5 HA negative sera, including those against the non-H5 subtype AIVs, and sera positive for antibodies against the various-origin H5 HAs. Preliminary validation showed 100% analytical and 97.6% diagnostic specificities of the assay and 98.0% and 99.1% diagnostic sensitivities when applied to detect the anti-H5 HA antibodies in the reference and experimental antisera, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The H5 EB-ELISA performed well in terms of diagnostic estimates. Thus, further optimization and validation work using a larger set of chicken sera and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis are warranted. Moreover, the present assay provides a valuable basis for developing multispecies screening tests for birds or diagnostic tests for humans.

The extra-articular infection is typically an infection of the gastrointestinal tract or genitourinary tract. Infection-related arthritis is a sterile arthritis associated with streptococcal tonsillitis, extra-articular tuberculosis, or intravesical instillation of bacillus Calmette–Guérin (iBCG) therapy for bladder cancer. These infection-related arthritis diagnoses are often grouped with ReA based on the pathogenic mechanism. However, the unique characteristics of these entities may be masked by a group classification. Therefore, we reviewed the clinical characteristics of classic ReA, poststreptococcal ReA, Poncet’s disease, and iBCG-induced ReA. Considering the diversity in triggering microbes, infection sites, and frequency of HLA-B27, these are different disorders. However, the clinical symptoms and intracellular parasitism pathogenic mechanism among classic ReA and infection-related arthritis entities are similar. Therefore, poststreptococcal ReA, Poncet’s disease, and iBCG-induced ReA could be included in the expanding spectrum of ReA, especially based on the pathogenic mechanism.","Taniguchi, Yoshinori; Nishikawa, Hirofumi; Yoshida, Takeshi; Terada, Yoshio; Tada, Kurisu; Tamura, Naoto; Kobayashi, Shigeto",Rheumatol Int,195,31

Innate immune-mediated programmed cell death (pyroptosis, apoptosis, necroptosis) is an integral part of host defense against pathogens. Inflammasomes, which are canonically formed upstream of pyroptosis, have been characterized as key mediators of fungal sensing and drivers of proinflammatory responses. However, the specific cell death pathways and key upstream sensors activated in the context of Candida and Aspergillus infections are unknown. Here, we report that C. albicans and A. fumigatus infection induced inflammatory programmed cell death in the form of pyroptosis, apoptosis, and necroptosis (PANoptosis). Further, we identified the innate immune sensor Z-DNA binding protein 1 (ZBP1) as the apical sensor of fungal infection responsible for activating the inflammasome/pyroptosis, apoptosis, and necroptosis. The Zα2 domain of ZBP1 was required to promote this inflammasome activation and PANoptosis. Overall, our results demonstrate that C. albicans and A. fumigatus induce PANoptosis and that ZBP1 plays a vital role in inflammasome activation and PANoptosis in response to fungal pathogens.","Banoth, Balaji; Tuladhar, Shraddha; Karki, Rajendra; Sharma, Bhesh Raj; Briard, Benoit; Kesavardhana, Sannula; Burton, Amanda; Kanneganti, Thirumala-Devi",J Biol Chem,195,1

Viruses may play an important role in the disease, as they seem to activate the 2′-5′-linked oligoadenylate (2′-5′A) pathway of the innate antiviral immune system. Our aim was to investigate this possibility. METHODS: Innate antiviral immune pathways were searched for type 1 diabetes-associated polymorphisms using genome-wide association study data. SNPs within ±250kb flanking regions of the transcription start site of 64 genes were examined. These pathways were also investigated for type 1 diabetes-associated RNA expression profiles using laser-dissected islets from two to five tissue sections per donor from the Diabetes Virus Detection (DiViD) study and the network of Pancreatic Organ Donors (nPOD). RESULTS: We found 27 novel SNPs in genes nominally associated with type 1 diabetes. Three of those SNPs were located upstream of the 2′-5′A pathway, namely SNP rs4767000 (p = 1.03 × 10(−9), OR 1.123), rs1034687 (p = 2.16 × 10(−7), OR 0.869) and rs739744 (p = 1.03 × 10(−9), OR 1.123). We also identified a large group of dysregulated islet genes in relation to type 1 diabetes, of which two were novel. The most aberrant genes were a group of IFN-stimulated genes. Of those, the following distinct pathways were targeted by the dysregulation (compared with the non-diabetic control group): OAS1 increased by 111% (p < 1.00 × 10(−4), 95% CI −0.43, −0.15); MX1 increased by 142% (p < 1.00 × 10(−4), 95% CI −0.52, −0.22); and ISG15 increased by 197% (p = 2.00 × 10(−4), 95% CI −0.68, −0.18). CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: We identified a genetic predisposition in the 2′-5′A pathway that potentially contributes to dysregulation of the innate antiviral immune system in type 1 diabetes. This study describes a potential role for the 2′-5′A pathway and other components of the innate antiviral immune system in beta cell autoimmunity.

It has been roughly described that a PLP serves as a link between the infection prevention team and the respective clinical departments. No detailed evidence about the contribution made by PLPs to the decrease of infection rates is available in Germany. The “HygArzt” project aims to demonstrate the medical and economic benefits of the implementation of hygiene measures by PLP in trauma surgery/orthopedics. METHODS: A multicenter interventional pre/post cohort study design was chosen. The study will run for a three-year period, including a pre-, post-, and an intervention phase, in four different hospitals, one of which will serve as pilot. A complex intervention containing evidence-based infection control measures will be developed and implemented by a PLP to proof efficacy. After the successful implementation of the preventive measures in the pilot hospital, the concept will be transposed to the three remaining trauma and orthopedic departments to confirm the transferability and generalizability. To enable the PLPs of the non-pilot departments, a subject-specific training program will be developed based on the study results of the pilot hospital and offered to the PLPs. DISCUSSION: Data are intended to provide evidence that and, if so, to which extent the implementation of specific preventive measures by a medical department-specific PLP is possible and results in a reduction of nosocomial infections in orthopedic surgery and traumatology. CONTRIBUTION TO THE LITERATURE: The present study describes a novel complex study design to prove the effectiveness of intervention measures for infection prevention. The study design and newly developed methodological approach could serve as a model for similar studies on infection prevention in the future. For the first time, the presented research project “HygArzt” focuses on the implementation of hygiene measures by an infection prevention link physician (PLP) and investigates whether nosocomial infections, especially surgical site infections, can be reduced by the measures implemented.

Both countries have a long history of scientific collaboration that dates to the 1800s. Both scientific communities also share geographical proximity and common scientific research interests mainly in Biotechnology, Meteorology, and Public Health research. Despite these facts, scientists from both nations face serious barriers to cooperation raised by the U.S. embargo established in 1961 that prohibits exchanges with Cuba. The study aims to analyze the effects of U.S. policy on scientific collaboration with Cuban scientific institutions. The results of the bibliometric analysis of Cuba-U.S. joint publications in the Web of Science, and Scopus databases between 1980 to 2020 indicate sustained growth of scientific collaboration between scientists of both nations over the past forty years. The results also show that after the 1980 Smithsonian Institution and the Cuba’s Academy of Sciences agreement significantly increased scientific collaboration between U.S. scientists with their Cuban peers. President Barack Obama’s approach to normalizing the U.S. Cuba relations in 2015 enhanced Cuban scientific production with U.S. scientists by exceeding the number of collaborative papers published during any preceding U.S. Presidential administration. By 2020, Cuba had expanded its scientific links to 80% of the countries in the world. Cuban and U.S. scientists converted from adversaries into partners, showing that science is an effective diplomatic channel.

Lebanon has taken in more Syrian refugees per capita than any other nation. We aimed to study the burden of surgical disease and access to surgical care among Syrian refugees in Lebanon. METHODS: This study was designed as a convenient cross-sectional cluster-based population survey of all refugee camps throughout the Bekaa region of Lebanon. We used a modified version of the Surgeons OverSeas Assessment of Surgical Need to identify surgical conditions and barriers to care access. The head of household of each informal tented settlement provided demographic information after which two household members were randomly chosen and administered the survey. RESULTS: A total of 1,500 individuals from 750 households representing 21 camps were surveyed. Respondents had a mean age of 36.6 (15.0) years, 54.6% were female, and 59% were illiterate. Nearly 25% of respondents reported at least one surgical condition within the past year, most commonly involving the face, head, and neck region (32%) and extremities (22%). Less than 20% of patients with a surgical condition reported seeing any healthcare provider, > 75% due to financial hardship. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of surgical disease among Syrian refugees is very high with a fourth of refugees suffering from one or more surgical conditions over the past year. The surgical needs of this vulnerable population are largely unmet as financial reasons prevent patients from seeking care. Local and humanitarian efforts need to include increased access to surgical care.","Moustafa, Moustafa K.; Al-Hajj, Samar; El-Hechi, Majed; El Moheb, Mohamad; Chamseddine, Zahraa; Kaafarani, Haytham M.

Extracellular volume (ECV) to guide late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) analysis may achieve a robust scar assessment. METHODS: Three cohorts of 80 non-ischemic-training, 20 non-ischemic-validation, and 10 ischemic-validation were prospectively enrolled and underwent 3.0 Tesla cardiac MRI. An ECV cutoff to differentiate LGE scar from non-scar was identified in the training cohort from the receiver-operating characteristic curve analysis, by comparing the ECV value against the visually-determined presence/absence of the LGE scar at the highest signal intensity (SI) area of the mid-left ventricle (LV) LGE. Based on the ECV cutoff, an LGE semi-automatic threshold of n-times of standard-deviation (n-SD) above the remote-myocardium SI was optimized in the individual cases ensuring correspondence between LGE and ECV images. The inter-method agreement of scar amount in comparison with manual (for non-ischemic) or full-width half-maximum (FWHM, for ischemic) was assessed. Intra- and inter-observer reproducibility were investigated in a randomly chosen subset of 40 non-ischemic and 10 ischemic cases. RESULTS: The non-ischemic groups were all female with the HIV positive rate of 73.8% (training) and 80% (validation). The ischemic group was all male with reduced LV function. An ECV cutoff of 31.5% achieved optimum performance (sensitivity: 90%, specificity: 86.7% in training; sensitivity: 100%, specificity: 81.8% in validation dataset). The identified n-SD threshold varied widely (range 3 SD–18 SD), and was independent of scar amount (β = −0.01, p = 0.92). In the non-ischemic cohorts, results suggested that the manual LGE assessment overestimated scar (%) in comparison to ECV-guided analysis [training: 4.5 (3.2–6.4) vs. 0.92 (0.1–2.1); validation: 2.5 (1.2–3.7) vs. 0.2 (0–1.6); P < 0.01 for both]. Intra- and inter-observer analyses of global scar (%) showed higher reproducibility in ECV-guided than manual analysis with CCC = 0.94 and 0.78 versus CCC = 0.86 and 0.73, respectively (P < 0.01 for all). In ischemic validation, the ECV-guided LGE analysis showed a comparable scar amount and reproducibility with the FWHM. CONCLUSIONS: ECV-guided LGE analysis is a robust scar quantification method for a non-ischemic cohort.

Eight-week-old male intact or orchidectomized cPLA(2)α(+/+)/Cyp1b1(+/+) and cPLA(2)α(–/–)/Cyp1b1(+/+) and intact cPLA(2)α(+/+)/Cyp1b1(–/–) mice were infused with angiotensin II (700 ng/kg/min, subcutaneous) for 2 weeks and injected with 6β-hydroxytestosterone (15 μg/g/every third day, intraperitoneal). Systolic blood pressure was measured by tail-cuff and confirmed by radiotelemetry. Angiotensin II-induced increase in systolic blood pressure, cardiac and renal collagen deposition, and reactive oxygen species production were reduced by disruption of the cPLA(2)α or Cyp1b1 genes or by administration of the arachidonic acid metabolism inhibitor 5,8,11,14-eicosatetraynoic acid to cPLA(2)α(+/+)/Cyp1b1(+/+) mice. 6β-hydroxytestosterone treatment restored these effects of angiotensin II in cPLA(2)α(+/+)/Cyp1b1(–/–) mice but not in orchidectomized cPLA(2)α(–/–)/Cyp1b1(+/+) mice, which were lowered by 5,8,11,14-eicosatetraynoic acid in cPLA(2)α(+/+)/Cyp1b1(–/–) mice. Antagonists of prostaglandin E(2)-EP1/EP3 receptors and thromboxane A(2)-TP receptors decreased the effect of 6β-hydroxytestosterone in restoring the angiotensin II-induced increase in systolic blood pressure, cardiac and renal collagen deposition, and reactive oxygen species production in cPLA(2)α(+/+)/Cyp1b1(–/–) mice. These data suggest that 6β-hydroxytestosterone promotes angiotensin II-induced increase in systolic blood pressure and associated pathogenesis via cPLA(2)α activation and generation of eicosanoids, most likely prostaglandin E(2) and thromboxane A(2) that exerts prohypertensive effects by stimulating EP1/EP3 and TP receptors, respectively. Therefore, agents that selectively block these receptors could be useful in treating testosterone exacerbated angiotensin II-induced hypertension and its pathogenesis.","Singh, Purnima; Song, Chi Young; Dutta, Shubha R.; Pingili, Ajeeth; Shin, Ji Soo; Gonzalez, Frank J.; Bonventre, Joseph V.; Malik, Kafait U.",Hypertension,195,12

Due to the long-term co-evolution between fungal endophytes and host plants, endophytes have evolved special biotransformation abilities, which can have critical consequences on plant metabolic processes and their composition. Biotransformation or bioconversion can impact the synthesis and decomposition of hormones, sugars, amino acids, vitamins, lipids, proteins, and various secondary metabolites, including flavonoids, polysaccharides, and terpenes. Endophytic fungi produce enzymes and various bioactive secondary metabolites with industrial value and can degrade or sequester inorganic and organic small molecules and macromolecules (e.g., toxins, pollutants, heavy metals). These fungi also have the ability to cause highly selective catalytic conversion of high-value compounds in an environmentally friendly manner, which can be important for the production/innovation of bioactive molecules, food and nutrition, agriculture, and environment. This work mainly summarized recent research progress in this field, providing a reference for further research and application of fungal endophytes. KEY POINTS: •The industrial value of degradation of endophytes was summarized. • The commercial value for the pharmaceutical industry is reviewed.

Endophytes are extremely diverse and range from fungi, bacteria and actinomycetes. Development of drug resistance to pathogenic forms of bacteria, fungi and other microbes, emergence of lethal viruses, the perpetuating epidemics in developing and under developing countries, and multifold fungal infection, enhancement in human population globally, all shows our inability to overcome these biomedical problems. In addition to this, we are also unable to assure people towards enough food security in specific regions of the earth due to infestation of different plant diseases. Since the fungal endophytes are relatively less studied group of microbial flora, but are responsible for several prospects such as biodiversity, ecology, bioactive metabolites (metabolomics) and nanotechnology, may enable us to overcome the above mentioned problems. Fungal endophytes represent a dependable source of specific secondary metabolites and can be manipulated both physicochemically and genetically to increase yield of desired compounds and to produce novel analogues of active metabolites. In this chapter, we have discussed several bioactive compounds and classified them in to different classes as per their properties such as antifungal, antibacterial, antiviral, antimalarial, anticancer, antioxidants, antidiabetic and immunosuppressive agents derived from fungal endophytes with their hosts and made the chemical structures for 73 compounds using chemdraw 3D ultra version 7.0. These bioactive products are related to human health with MIC/EC/IC(50) values less that 50 μg/mL. This article also discusses nematicidal, some antimicrobial volatile compounds (VOCs) that are related to plant protection and faecal disposal. Therefore, this chapter is not very specific and covers almost prospects of fungal endophytes which could be useful in biodiversity, agrochemicals, biotechnology, biomedical and nanotechnology in ecofriendly manner.","Mishra, Ashish; Gond, Surendra K.; Kumar, Anuj; Sharma, Vijay K.; Verma, Satish K.; Kharwar, R.

Immunodeficiency is the key risk factor and results from interplay between the underlying disease and its therapy. Various defects in the immune system coexist in HSCT recipients. In the early post-transplant period, neutropenia, oral and gastrointestinal mucositis, and the presence of central venous catheters are the main risk factors. Bacterial infections predominate, and the agents and antibiotic susceptibility profiles vary widely in different regions. Invasive candidiasis is infrequent with fluconazole use, but the incidence of invasive aspergillosis is on the rise, mainly in patients receiving purine analogues or intensive chemotherapy before transplant. In the post-engraftment period, infections are less frequent, but may contribute to significant non-relapse mortality. The dynamics of immune reconstitution drives the risk for infection in this period. The most frequent infections are varicella-zoster virus disease and respiratory tract infections. Assessment of the risk of infection in each period and the identification of patients at higher risk of specific infections are critical to the appropriate management of infectious complications after autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.","Nucci, Marcio; Anaissie, Elias",Infections in Hematology,195,1

Indeed the very word “dis-ease” implies a state lacking “ease” or well-being. We feel it is important to consider disease holistically: that is to consider the animal’s ability to resist stress and the environmental challenges it faces. Whereas the outcome of poor welfare is expressed as disease, the relative contributions of various stressors will vary with each individual. The other chapters consider genetics, nutrition and environment in terms of the welfare of poultry. However, given the same housing, air, feed and water, some birds may become diseased and some remain healthy. Intrinsic biological variation results in a range of nutrient reserves and immune status at hatching, plus differences in genetic make up, social status and behaviour that interact with each other and further factors to provide different outcomes for the individual. In the pragmatic world of farming, flock health status may be frequently chosen as the index of welfare, but it is important not to lose sight of the health and well-being of each individual, even in flocks numbering tens of thousands of birds.","Butterworth, Andrew; Weeks, Claire",The Welfare of Domestic Fowl and Other Captive Birds,195,17

The analysis is based primarily on children’s drawings, interviews with children and observations on them, and literature review. The subjects of this study were 16 children from incomplete families, who participated in weekly drawing activities. In addition to the drawings by the children, data in the form of verbal descriptions and non-verbal expressions were collected throughout the drawing sessions via notes-taking, audio-taping, and photo-taking. The data were analysed to provide an understanding of the children’s definitions of the family, the functions of the family, the roles of the parents, what constitutes a “family member” in the minds of the children, the relationships and affection among family members, and the children’s expectations of the family. With such an analysis, it is hoped to explore the children’s perception of their family life, their feelings and emotions, and their outlook for the future. The children had many expectations and hopes concerning their family, home, family members including themselves, and society at large. They also had many dissatisfactions, even complaints. While the children had not discussed much about the functions of the family, they placed much importance on its emotional aspects, and they had expressed emotional needs for parents. In the eyes of the children from incomplete families, “Children’s Home” is a place that satisfies their daily living needs, but it is not family as it lacks affection. In sum, by letting the children speak their minds through their own drawings and interpretations, this study provides a fresh perspective from children on their views of family, family members, as well as the reality and fantasy of life.","Man-ching, Ada Lee",International Handbook of Chinese Families,195,1

This chapter argues that to put health high on local social and political agendas necessarily means to transcend project-based work, and move into lasting programme and policy development. The conditions for such approaches are favourable in Healthy Cities, as a number of glocal (global and local) developments invest and sustain longer term perspectives. These conditions include emphases on policy diffusion, social justice, a better understanding of complex systems, and global commitments to the development and implementation of Health in All Policies. These efforts, in turn, are grounded in renewed and tangible support from Universal Health Coverage and Primary Health Care, asset-based community health development, and better insights into what drives (health) equity and economic development. In describing these elements of policy development for value-based Healthy Cities the chapter also gives a firm argument for a broad range of stakeholders to engage successfully in longer term policy change.","de Leeuw, Evelyne",Healthy Cities,195,1

It is observed that the efficiency of SymSum against ZeroSum drops from 4 to 2 for any number of rounds linearized. This is supported by theoretical proofs. SymSum augmented with linearization can penetrate up to two more rounds as against the classical version. In addition to that, one more round is extended by inversion technique on the final hash values. The combined approach leads to distinguishers up to 9 rounds of SHA3 variants with a complexity of only [Formula: see text] which is better than the equivalent ZeroSum distinguisher by the factor of 2.

Patients with rheumatic diseases and those receiving immunosuppressive treatment are felt to be at greater risk of complications from this illness, though registry and trial data should help refine our understanding of these risks. We hereby describe a case of COVID-19 complicating an unusual rheumatic illness, resulting in severe multi-system disease and premature death. CASE REPORT - CASE DESCRIPTION: A 69 year-old male presented to rheumatology and haematology with symmetrical polyarthritis, thrombocytopenia (18 x 10(9)/L), eosinophilia (25.4 x 10(9)/L), raised C-reactive protein (CRP, 43 mg/L), positive rheumatoid factor (>200), antinuclear antibody (ANA) and anti-Ro. Bone marrow biopsy did not demonstrate evidence of haematological malignancy. Seropositive rheumatoid arthritis and connective tissue disease overlap were diagnosed, and treatment with Prednisolone 60mg daily was initiated. Despite rituximab and intravenous immunoglobulins, thrombocytopenia deteriorated on reducing corticosteroids, however the addition of mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) allowed gradual prednisolone tapering to 3mg daily. Hydroxychloroquine was briefly added but discontinued due to headaches. MMF was discontinued after he developed fungal pneumonia followed by jaundice. Liver biopsy was consistent with drug-induced cholestasis, attributed to co-amoxiclav, and his liver function tests (LFTs) improved on ursodeoxycholic acid. Following a further deterioration in thrombocytopenia, hyperferritinaemia and new onset erythema nodosum, he had a repeat bone marrow examination. This demonstrated large areas of fibrosis and granulomatous inflammation with a dense, pleomorphic T-cell infiltrate, but no haemophagocytosis. Haematologists felt this was reactive and prednisolone dose was increased to 10mg daily. Six months later he developed cholangitis. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) demonstrated a tight 4cm stricture of the distal common bile duct (CBD) within the head of pancreas, which was diffusely swollen without any clear focal mass. Serum amylase was mildly elevated (316 units/L). Concurrent CT thorax, abdomen and pelvis demonstrated bilateral ground-glass changes within the lungs, and a SARS-CoV-2 nasopharyngeal PCR test was positive, though he had no respiratory symptoms or oxygen requirement at that stage. Sadly, four days after the CT scan and before a planned endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) could be performed, he became markedly hypoxic with plain chest x-ray features suggestive of COVID-19 pneumonia. Despite medical management, including doubling of his prednisolone dose, he rapidly deteriorated and died. CASE REPORT - DISCUSSION: This case highlights an unusual presentation of COVID-19 in a patient with a complex background of inflammatory arthritis with immune-mediated thrombocytopenia. At the time of his final illness, these conditions were managed with steroid monotherapy. Based on the COVID-19 risk matrix recommended by the British Society for Rheumatology, he was not identified as a patient requiring shielding. Cholangitis was the major problem precipitating his final admission to hospital, and at the time of admission he had no respiratory symptoms. One week prior to this admission, his father-in-law had died of COVID-19 pneumonia, though they had not been in recent direct contact. Interstitial lung changes were incidentally noted on a CT performed to identify the cause of cholangitis, which prompted the nasopharyngeal PCR that detected SARS-CoV-2. This occurred prior to widespread routine testing of hospital inpatients for SARS-CoV-2 by PCR. Unfortunately he then rapidly developed COVID-19 pneumonia and died before the underlying cause of cholangitis could be definitively identified, though an MRCP demonstrated an obstructed CBD within a diffusely swollen pancreas, where a differential diagnosis of pancreatic malignancy or autoimmune pancreatitis was suggested by the reporting radiologist. There are emerging case reports of COVID-19 resulting in significant pancreatic injuryand a further recent laboratory analysis has suggested that ACE2 receptors, which are utilised by SARS-CoV-2 to gain entry to host cells, are highly expressed on cholangiocytes at a comparable level to type II alveolar cells. Whilst the ultimate cause of cholangitis will remain unknown in this patient, this case highlights the potential for atypical presentations and extra-pulmonary manifestations of COVID-19. Case report - Key learning points: 1. COVID-19 is a multi-system illness which can cause significant extra-pulmonary as well as pulmonary pathology, with emerging reports that the biliary tract and pancreas are frequently affected. 2. Evidence to inform accurate prediction of which patients with rheumatic diseases are at highest risk of acquiring severe COVID-19 disease remains insufficient, with current shielding guidelines based on expert consensus. 3. This case highlights the importance of widespread testing for COVID-19 in hospital patients, as not all patients carrying the SARS-CoV-2 virus will demonstrate classical respiratory features of the disease at the point of admission.","Williams, Thomas; Price, Elizabeth; Ahmed, Azeem",Rheumatol Adv Pract,195,1

Sparsity of the authentic information and up surging of the misinformation in the social media and rapidly evolving different reference testing laboratories were creating confusions and challenges among our clinic providers and nursing staffs. With periodic incorporation of updates on standardized protocol and guidelines, we formulated a plan and delivered that in a coordinated manner in educating the clinical and nursing staffs regarding the COVID -19 specimen collection and processing for testing to overcome that. METHODS: We gathered all the communications for COVID -19 from the federal, state and city health authorities and our corporate management about the testing methods, collection and processing requirements and specimen pickups. We verified and customized that information, prepared and circulated them in detailed PowerPoint presentation and then updated that periodically with any addition or changes in the testing reference labs and/or their specimen requirements. RESULTS: With periodic, standardized and updated guidelines and detailed verified information and instructions for sample processing, a uniform and much coordinated specimen collection and processing could be achieved and all of our five-borough spanning multisite municipal ambulatory clinics could collect and process the COVID-19 specimens properly. CONCLUSION: Centralized, Planned and concerted education planning and timely delivering that to the clinical and nursing staffs could tremendously help in answering many relevant queries and curtailing confusion and properly collecting and handling the specimens in emerging infection like COVID-19 in a large city municipal ambulatory care health system.","Huq Ronny, F M",Am J Clin Pathol,195,6

This serological assay detects and titrates the presence of circulating antibodies to COVID-19. Other platforms have aimed to achieve the credentials of the ELISA instrument, including the multiplex assays of Luminex. The platform is known to have a greater throughput (384 wells vs. 96 wells per microplate) and faster processing speed (8 hours vs. 17 hours). METHODS: Luminex utilizes beads that couple to the same COVID-19 antigens (mRBD and mSpike) which were utilized for the ELISA assay. The beads are read determining the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI). In order to compare the two methods, our study included 61 patients with COVID-19 at Mount Sinai Hospital, to screen and titrate their sera using Luminex, and to correspond the MFI values with the ELISA titers. RESULTS: The Luminex assay has achieved the same level of confidence as ELISA. The 61 patients, representing 30 negatives and 31 positives, are consistently identified as such on both platforms. Our data highlights 32% of patients with a low titer (<1:160), 42% of patients with a high titer (1:160 ~ 1:320), and 26% of patients with a very high titer level (>1:320). These titers correlated well with the MFI values. Based on a cutoff of 80,000 MFI, the sensitivity and specificity of the assay is 98% and 85%, respectively, with no overlapping of MFI between positive and negative results. CONCLUSION: Overall, the study has demonstrated that the Luminex is a strong alternative for the ELISA platform. The Luminex highlights the broad dynamic range with no overlapping between positives and negatives. Migration from ELISA to Luminex, a platform with faster and greater throughput, is therefore, highly desirable.","Shapiro, M S; Wang, X; Mendu, D R; Firpo, A",Am J Clin Pathol,195,1

The paper highlights violations at different levels—discursive, ethical, and everyday—and shows how they are underpinned by ageism and disablism which stereotype older people and people with disabilities with prejudicial messaging and actions by states and societal actors. At the same time, the paper also highlights the value of human rights discourses and instruments which are mobilized by the disability movement and groups upholding the rights of older people, to question these rights infringements in the context of COVID-19. The politics of these groups which call for principled equality and inclusion of older people and people with disabilities in times of COVID-19 exhibit a much-needed disruption of our social order, an undertaking that needs to be continued in COVID-19 times and after.","Akerkar, Supriya",J Hum Rights Pract,195,1

Currently, no vaccine is commercially available for prevention, and the epidemic is still spreading. Here, we constructed a recombinant pseudorabies virus (PRV) (PRV-ΔgE/ΔgI/ΔTK-(CD2v)) that expresses the CD2v protein of ASFV and evaluated its effectiveness and safety as a vaccine candidate in mice. METHODS: A homologous recombination fragment containing ASFV CD2v was synthesized and co-transfected into HEK 293 T cells, a knockout vector targeting the PRV TK gene. The transfected cells were infected with PRV-ΔgE/ΔgI, and the recombinant strain (PRV-ΔgE/ΔgI/ΔTK-(CD2v)) was obtained by plaque purification in Vero cells. The expression of ASFV CD2v in the recombinant virus was confirmed by sequencing, Western blotting, and immunofluorescence analysis, and the genetic stability was tested in Vero cells over 20 passages. The virulence, immunogenicity and protective ability of the recombinant virus were further tested in a mouse model. RESULTS: The PRV-ΔgE/ΔgI/ΔTK-(CD2v) recombinant strain is stable in Vero cells, and the processing of CD2v does not depend on ASFV infection. The vaccination of PRV-ΔgE/ΔgI/ΔTK-(CD2v) causes neither pruritus, not a systemic infection and inflammation (with the high expression of interleukin-6 (IL6)). Besides, the virus vaccination can produce anti-CD2v specific antibody and activate a specific cellular immune response, and 100% protect mice from the challenge of the virulent strain (PRV-Fa). The detoxification occurs much earlier upon the recombinant virus vaccination and the amount of detoxification is much lower as well. CONCLUSIONS: The PRV-ΔgE/ΔgI/ΔTK-(CD2v) recombinant strain has strong immunogenicity, is safe and effective, and maybe a potential vaccine candidate for the prevention of ASF and Pseudorabies.","Feng, Zhihua; Chen, Jianghua; Liang, Wangwang; Chen, Wenzhi; Li, Zhaolong; Chen, Qi; Cai, Shaoli",Virol J,195,16

Due to their congregate nature and participants’ compromised health, many ADCs have been forced to temporarily shutter during the COVID-19 pandemic. It is unknown how closures have impacted service delivery at ADCs. Guided by the Resiliency Framework, we (1) explore methods employed by ADCs during the pandemic to meet participant/caregiver needs and (2) determine how/whether these methods have mitigated the negative effects of ADC closures on participants and their caregivers. Both virtual focus groups and one-on-one semi-structured qualitative interviews were conducted with ADC staff members (n=20) across the United States. Preliminary results showed precipitous declines in physical, cognitive, and mental health of participants, as well as increased caregiver strain, particularly among dementia caregivers. However, ADCs found creative solutions to care for participants despite restrictions, creating, in their words, “centers without walls.” Staff developed virtual programs (e.g. support groups, music and exercise therapy) and conducted “door-step” visits to support productive engagement and combat loneliness. Telehealth supported care coordination and identification of emergent clinical problems. Results suggest that despite innumerable COVID-19-related challenges, ADCs demonstrated resilience and creativity in managing participants’ needs, fostered a sense of purpose, and provided caregiver respite. Further research on the effectiveness of remote programming and advocacy for sustainable reimbursement by payers is needed to ensure that ADCs can continue to provide older adults and their families with meaningful support as the pandemic wears on.","Vora, Paayal; Missaelides, Lydia; Trinh-Shevrin, Chau; Sadarangani, Tina",Innov Aging,195,1

As of June 2020, there are over 20,000 confirmed cases and nearly 700 deaths due to COVID-19 in Wisconsin, with the majority of COVID-19 related deaths occurring within Milwaukee County. COVID-19 infections are disproportionately affecting minority communities across the United States. Presentation and outcomes vary, with the elderly and those with underlying diseases having poorer outcomes. METHODS: This retrospective chart review of patients tested for COVID-19 infection from March 2020-May 2020 at the Zablocki VA Medical Center, Milwaukee, WI evaluated demographics, comorbidities, presenting symptoms, and duration of symptoms. The primary outcomes analyzed were whether there were significant differences in demographic data, comorbidities, and presentation between patients testing positive or not positive for COVID-19. RESULTS: A total of 173 patients tested for COVID-19 were included during the study period, 82 positive and 91 otherwise. Univariate analysis of patient demographics and presenting symptoms are summarized in Table 1. A multivariable logistic regression using stepwise selection (AUC=0.7188) determined patients that tested positive for COVID-19, when controlling for demographics and comorbidities, were more likely to be African-American than White (OR 3.455, CI 1.733–6.887), and more likely to have a diagnosis of diabetes (OR 2.698, CI 1.36–5.353). However, race and diabetes were not informative when symptoms were included in a subsequent model (AUC=0.8458); patients testing positive for COVID-19 were more likely to present with diarrhea (OR 6.926, CI 1.760–6.926) and a higher temperature (OR 2.651, CI 1.533–4.584), but less likely to present with vomiting (OR 0.007, CI < .001-0.161) when compared to patients testing otherwise for COVID-19. Table 1: Univariate Analysis of Variables Associated with Testing Positive for COVID-19 at Zablocki VA Medical Center 3/2020–5/2020 [Image: see text] CONCLUSION: Patients testing positive in Milwaukee County are more likely to be African-American and/or diabetic; further highlighting racial disparities in COVID-19. Symptomology at presentation is more related to positive COVID-19 test results than demographics and comorbidities.

Currently, lack of exposure to the technology poses a barrier for adoption. We offer an accessible, low-cost guide to producing vascular anatomical models using routine CT angiography, open source software packages and a variety of 3D printing technologies. Methods: Although applicable to all vascular territories, we illustrate our methodology using Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms (AAAs) due to the strong interest in this area. CT aortograms acquired as part of routine care were converted to representative patient-specific 3D models, and then printed using a variety of 3D printing technologies to assess their material suitability as aortic phantoms. Depending on the technology, phantoms cost $20–$1,000 and were produced in 12–48 h. This technique was used to generate hollow 3D printed thoracoabdominal aortas visible under fluoroscopy. Results: 3D printed AAA phantoms were a valuable addition to standard CT angiogram reconstructions in the simulation of complex cases, such as short or very angulated necks, or for positioning fenestrations in juxtarenal aneurysms. Hollow flexible models were particularly useful for device selection and in planning of fenestrated EVAR. In addition, these models have demonstrated utility other settings, such as patient education and engagement, and trainee and anatomical education. Further study is required to establish a material with optimal cost, haptic and fluoroscopic fidelity. Conclusion: We share our experiences and methodology for developing inexpensive 3D printed vascular phantoms which despite material limitations, successfully mimic the procedural challenges encountered during live endovascular surgery. As the technology continues to improve, 3D printed vascular phantoms have the potential to disrupt how endovascular procedures are planned and taught.","Coles-Black, Jasamine; Bolton, Damien; Chuen, Jason",Front Surg,195,12

Recent work, however, suggests that this might be overrated in standard CNNs. In this paper, we are pushing the envelope and aim to investigate the reliance on spatial information further. We propose to discard spatial information via shuffling locations or average pooling during both training and testing phases to investigate the impact on individual layers. Interestingly, we observe that spatial information can be deleted from later layers with small accuracy drops, which indicates spatial information at later layers is not necessary for good test accuracy. For example, the test accuracy of VGG-16 only drops by 0.03% and 2.66% with spatial information completely removed from the last 30% and 53% layers on CIFAR-100, respectively.

Since its inception in 2008 the US shale oil industry has never been a profitable industry. If it were judged by the strict commercial criteria by which other successful companies are judged, it would have been declared bankrupt years ago. US shale drillers have been encouraged by easy liquidity provided by Wall Street and other investors to continue production even at a loss to pay some of their debts. In so doing, their outstanding debts have mushroomed to almost $1 trillion leading to large number of bankruptcies among them. Oil demand was corrupted or rather destroyed before novel coronavirus. Oil demand would have been damaged even without the spread of deadly virus. It was already fragile and nearly down to its knees. Coronavirus was a deadly blow to oil demand. It has seen two major oil collapses back in 1985–86 and 2002–03. The two sharp oil price falls took about two years each to recover. Current market volatility is uncertain. The two past market collapses were a combination of oil market fundamentals plus geopolitically motivated circumstances. In case current situation proved worst and US economy entered a depression mode, duration of low oil prices could be even longer. US oil exports will always be challenged by the international price climate. The COVID-19 pandemic could go into history as the largest destructive event that has hit the global economy since the Great Depression of the 1930s. There are indications that its adverse impact could be even bigger than the Great Depression of the 1930s. Many ideas are being considered for bailing it out including an import tax or tariff on all foreign oil imports to the US. But this will not work since major crude oil exporters to the United States will shift their exports to the bigger market of the Asia-Pacific region rather than pay the tax.","Shokri Kalehsar, Omid",US Energy Diplomacy in the Caspian Sea Basin,195,13

Thus, this study aimed to assess health care worker’s practice of using personal protective equipment and psychological preparedness against the COVID-19 pandemic in Eastern Ethiopia. METHODS: A facility-based cross-sectional study design was used. The health care workers (HCW) who were working in the selected health facilities were randomly selected. Variables that had p-value of < 0.15 were transformed to multivariable logistic regression model. Finally, the significance level was declared at the p-value < 0.05 with a 95% confidence interval (CI). RESULTS: A total of 418 HCWs were randomly selected and included in this study. The study participants mean age was 27.96 years with a ±5.6SD. HCWs who were male (adjusted odds ratio(AOR) = 2.21, 95% CI: 1.29–3.79), regularly using sanitizer, accessing COVID-19 management guideline (AOR = 2.83, 95% CI: 1.46–5.47), trained on COVID-19 prevention methods (AOR = 2.6, 95% CI: 1.4–4.7), hopeless of eventually getting COVID-19 at workplace (AOR = 1.9, 95% CI: 1.13–3.28), and feeling unsafe at work when using standard precautions (AOR = 0.46, 95% CI: 0.27–0.79) were associated with good PPE using compared to their counterparts. Moreover, nursing/midwifery professionals practiced good personal protective equipment compared to physicians (AOR = 3.7, 95% CI: 1.8–7.7). CONCLUSION: The study demonstrated that being a male, being a nurse/midwifery, regularly sanitizing hands/medical equipment, having COVID-19 management guidelines, trained on COVID-19, and feeling of eventually getting COVID-19 at workplace had a positive association with PPE utilization. Besides, the study revealed that not feeling safe at work when using standard precautions was negatively associated with PPE utilization of HCWs. Therefore, the prevention priorities should be given to frontline HCWs by providing all possible support and strictly implementing the prevention and control guidelines of COVID-19 to prevent the health system from collapse.","Birhanu, Abdi; Balis, Bikila; Assebe Yadeta, Tesfaye; Bayu, Miesso",SAGE Open Med,195,13

Prognosis systematic reviews are needed to collate and synthesise these research findings, especially to help inform effective clinical decision-making and healthcare policy. A detailed, comprehensive search strategy is central to any systematic review. However, within prognosis research, this is challenging due to poor reporting and inconsistent use of available indexing terms in electronic databases. Whilst many published search filters exist for finding clinical trials, this is not the case for prognosis studies. This systematic review aims to identify and compare existing methodological filters developed and evaluated to identify prognosis studies of any of the three main types: overall prognosis, prognostic factors, and prognostic [risk prediction] models. METHODS Primary studies reporting the development and/or evaluation of methodological search filters to retrieve any type of prognosis study will be included in this systematic review. Multiple electronic bibliographic databases will be searched, grey literature will be sought from relevant organisations and websites, experts will be contacted, and citation tracking of key papers and reference list checking of all included papers will be undertaken. Titles will be screened by one person, and abstracts and full articles will be reviewed for inclusion independently by two reviewers. Data extraction and quality assessment will also be undertaken independently by two reviewers with disagreements resolved by discussion or by a third reviewer if necessary. Filters' characteristics and performance metrics reported in the included studies will be extracted and tabulated. To enable comparisons, filters will be grouped according to database, platform, type of prognosis study, and type of filter for which it was intended. DISCUSSION This systematic review will identify all existing validated prognosis search filters and synthesise evidence about their applicability and performance. These findings will identify if current filters provide a proficient means of searching electronic bibliographic databases or if further prognosis filters are needed and can feasibly be developed for systematic searches of prognosis studies.","Corp, Nadia; Jordan, Joanne L; Hayden, Jill A; Irvin, Emma; Parker, Robin; Smith, Andrea; van der Windt, Danielle A",Systematic reviews,195,16

A key consideration in FCB is to balance the density of dye barcodes, the complexity of cells in the sample, and the desired accuracy of the debarcoding. Unfortunately, barcoding bench and computational methods have not benefited from the high dimensional revolution in cytometry due to a lack of automated computational tools that effectively balance these common cytometry needs. DebarcodeR addresses these unmet needs by providing a framework for computational debarcoding augmented by improvements to experimental methods. Adaptive regression modeling accounted for differential dye uptake between different cell types and Gaussian mixture modeling provided a robust method to probabilistically assign cells to samples. Assignment tolerance parameters are available to allow users to balance high cell recovery with accurate assignments. Improvements to experimental methods include: 1) inclusion of an 'external standard' control where a pool of all cells was stained a single level of each barcoding dyes, and 2) an 'internal standard' where each cell is stained with a single level of a separate dye. DebarcodeR significantly improved speed, accuracy, and reproducibility of FCB while avoiding selective loss of unusual cell subsets when debarcoding microtiter plates of cell lines and heterogenous mixtures of primary cells.

The maximal analgesic effect was achieved when the AAVs expressing all three genes were administered to rats with neuropathic pain. The combination of two virus constructs expressing the three genes was named KLS-2031 and evaluated as a potential novel therapeutic for neuropathic pain. Single transforaminal epidural injections of KLS-2031 into the intervertebral foramen to target the appropriate dorsal root ganglion produced notable long-term analgesic effects in female and male rats. Furthermore, KLS-2031 mitigated the neuroinflammation, neuronal cell death, and dorsal root ganglion hyperexcitability induced by the spared nerve injury.

METHODS PROM women at term with singleton pregnancies and Bishop scores ≤4 who needed labor induction were enrolled in this retrospective study. They received either the dinoprostone pessary followed by oxytocin infusion if necessary (n = 102, PGE2 group) or oxytocin infusion alone (n = 103, oxytocin group). RESULTS Compared with oxytocin infusion alone, vaginal delivery within 12 h and total vaginal delivery were higher in the PGE2 group (28.4% vs 7.8%, p = 0.0001; 79.4% vs 62.1%, p = 0.009, respectively). There were no statistical differences between the two groups in terms of maternal and neonatal outcomes, such as postpartum hemorrhage, endometritis, third- and fourth-degree vaginal lacerations and neonatal weight, 1- and 5-min Apgar score ≤7, neonatal jaundice, and neonatal unit admission (p > 0.05). However, there was a higher rate of uterine hyperstimulation in the PGE2 group (20.6% vs 3.9%, p < 0.0001). The effective rate of cervical ripening increased in the PGE2 group at 8 and 12 h of labor induction (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS Despite higher rates of uterine hyperstimulation, the use of dinoprostone was associated with higher rates of vaginal deliveries in Chinese nulliparous women with term PROM and Bishop scores ≤4, compared with use of oxytocin only.","Liu, Haiyan; Yin, Huifen; Zhang, Huan; Zhu, Hao; Hu, Rong; Gu, Weirong",The journal of obstetrics and gynaecology research,195,10

Kv7.1-KCNE1 channels produce the slow-delayed rectifying K+ current, IKs, which is important during the repolarization phase of the cardiac action potential. Kv7.2-7.5 are predominantly neuronally expressed and constitute the muscarinic M-current and control the resting membrane potential in neurons. Kv7.1 produces drastically different currents as a result of modulation by KCNE subunits. This flexibility allows the Kv7.1 channel to have many roles depending on location and assembly partners. The pharmacological sensitivity of Kv7.1 channels differs from that of Kv7.2-7.5 and is largely dependent upon the number of β-subunits present in the channel complex. As a result, the development of pharmaceuticals targeting Kv7.1 is problematic. This review discusses the roles and the mechanisms by which different signaling pathways affect Kv7.1 and KCNE channels and could potentially provide different ways of targeting the channel.

OBJECTIVE EWOLUTION was designed to provide data in routine practice from a prospective multicenter registry. METHODS A total of 1025 patients scheduled for a WATCHMAN implant were prospectively and sequentially enrolled at 47 centers. Indication for LAA closure was based on European Society of Cardiology guidelines. Follow-up and transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) were performed per local practice. RESULTS The baseline CHA2DS2-VASc score was 4.5 ± 1.6; the mean age was 73.4 ± 9 years; previous transient ischemic attack/ischemic stroke was present in 312 (30.5%), 155 (15.1%) had previous hemorrhagic stroke, and 320 (31.3%) had a history of major bleeding; and 750 (73%) were deemed unsuitable for oral anticoagulation therapy. WATCHMAN implant succeeded in 1005 (98.5%) of patients, without leaks >5 mm in 1002 (99.7%) with at least 1 TEE follow-up in 875 patients (87%). Antiplatelet therapy was used in 784 (83%), while vitamin K antagonists were used in only 75 (8%). At 1 year, mortality was 98 (9.8%), reflecting the advanced age and comorbidities in this population. Device thrombus was observed in 28 patients at routine TEE (3.7%) and was not correlated with the drug regimen (P = .14). Ischemic stroke rate was 1.1% (relative risk 84% vs estimated historical data); the major bleeding rate was 2.6% and was predominantly (2.3%) nonprocedure/device related. CONCLUSION LAA closure with the WATCHMAN device has a high implant and sealing success. This method of stroke risk reduction appears to be safe and effective with an ischemic stroke rate as low as 1.1%, even though 73% of patients had a contraindication to and were not using oral anticoagulation.","Boersma, Lucas V; Ince, Hueseyin; Kische, Stephan; Pokushalov, Evgeny; Schmitz, Thomas; Schmidt, Boris; Gori, Tommaso; Meincke, Felix; Protopopov, Alexey Vladimir; Betts, Timothy; Foley, David; Sievert, Horst; Mazzone, Patrizio; De Potter, Tom; Vireca, Elisa; Stein, Kenneth; Bergmann, Martin W",Heart rhythm,195,31

OBJECTIVES The goal of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the intervention program for immobile patients with stroke in China. DESIGN A cost-effectiveness analysis alongside a pre-test/post-test (before and after) study was undertaken from a health care perspective. SETTINGS Participants were recruited from 25 hospitals among six provinces or municipal cities in eastern (Guangdong province, Zhejiang province, and Beijing municipal city), western (Sichuan province), and central (Henan province and Hubei province) China. PARTICIPANTS A total of 7,653 immobile stroke patients were included in our sample. Patients in routine care settings were recruited from November 2015 to June 2016, and the recruitment of the intervention group patients was from November 2016 to July 2017. METHODS To adjust for potential bias from confounding variables, the 1:1 propensity score matching yielded matched pairs of 2,966 patients in the routine care group and 2,966 patients in the intervention group, with no significant differences in sociodemographic or clinical characteristics between two groups. All patients were followed-up 3 months after enrolment in the study. Total healthcare costs were extracted from the hospital information system, with the health outcome effectiveness of the intervention program measured using the EuroQol five-dimensional questionnaire (EQ-5D) instrument and the cost-effectiveness of the intervention measured by the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio with a time horizon of 3 months. RESULTS Compared to routine care, the intervention program decreased the total costs of stroke patients by CN¥4,600 (95% confidence interval [CI]: [-7050, -2151]), while increasing quality-adjusted life year 0.009 (95% CI: [0.005, 0.013]). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios over 3 months was CN¥-517,011 per quality-adjusted life year (95% CI: [-1,111,442, -203,912]). Subgroup analysis reveals that both the health-related quality of life and cost effectiveness improved significantly for ischemic patients and tertiary hospitals patients while for hemorrhagic patients and non-tertiary hospital patients only the health-related quality of life improved significantly. CONCLUSIONS Findings from this first cost-effectiveness analysis in immobile stroke patients provide evidence that an intervention program provided significant cost saving, but mainly in ischemic patients and tertiary hospital patients. Wider adoption of such programs may be a sensible approach to reducing the burden of stroke and for immobile patients more generally.","Liu, Hongpeng; Zhu, Dawei; Song, Baoyun; Jin, Jingfen; Liu, Yilan; Wen, Xianxiu; Cheng, Shouzhen; Nicholas, Stephen; Wu, Xinjuan",International journal of nursing studies,195,31

In this study, we aimed to investigate if these specific VCs in chest CT correlate with clinical severity of the disease. METHODS CT images of 102 patients who underwent low-dose noncontrast chest CT due to COVID-19 between 11 March 2020 and 11 April 2020 were evaluated retrospectively. The patients were divided into two groups based on the presence of VCs in CT images. VCs in chest CT of patients with COVID-19 were defined using the following descriptors: decreased lumen caliber, vascular wall irregularity, angulation in the course of the vessel, vascular disruption, and/or interruption. The relationship of these VCs with disease symptoms (fever, cough, shortness of breath), comorbid conditions (diabetes, hypertension, asthma), smoking habit, disease-specific laboratory changes (white blood cell-lymphocyte count, neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio, C-reactive protein [CRP], D-dimer, lactate dehydrogenase [LDH], ferritin, procalcitonin), lung parenchymal infiltration pattern (ground-glass opacity, crazy-paving pattern, consolidation) and its distribution (peripheral, central, mixed, upper lobes, lower lobes, right middle lobe) on CT were investigated by comparison of these variables between patients with and without VCs in chest CT. RESULTS VCs were observed in 18 out of 102 patients (18%) with typical parenchymal involvement for COVID-19. There was no significant difference in terms of age and sex. We found an irregularity in the wall of the vascular structures in the distal branches and decreased lumen caliber of the vessels related to ground-glass opacities in 15 patients, concentric luminal narrowing in annular form in 4 patients, angulation/traction or springiness in the vascular structures towards the active lesions in 3 patients, and interruptions along the vascular course in 1 patient. VCs were significantly correlated with fever (12/18, 66.7%) and shortness of breath (7/18, 39%). These changes were significantly more remarkable in common disease involving both upper and lower lobes (10/18, 56%). In these cases, there was a substantial increase in CRP (15/18, 83%; mean, 5.7±6.3 mg/dL) and LDH (8/18, 44%) values compared to those who did not have any VCs. CONCLUSION The results of this study suggest that specific VCs observed in chest CT may predict the disease severity in cases of COVID-19 pneumonia. These changes may be related to respiratory distress in the disease.","Tekcan Şanlı, Deniz Esin; Yıldırım, Düzgün",Diagnostic and interventional radiology,195,31

To date, no effective biomarkers exist to predict which premature infants will develop NEC, limiting targeted prevention strategies. Multiple observational studies have reported an association between the exposure to red blood cell (RBC) transfusion and/or anemia and the subsequent development of NEC; however, the underlying physiologic mechanisms of how these factors are independently associated with NEC remain unknown. METHODS In this paper, we outline our prospective, multicenter observational cohort study of infants with a birth weight ≤ 1250 g to investigate the associations between RBC transfusion, anemia, intestinal oxygenation and injury that lead to NEC. Our overarching hypothesis is that irradiation of RBC units followed by longer storage perturbs donor RBC metabolism and function, and these derangements are associated with paradoxical microvascular vasoconstriction and intestinal tissue hypoxia increasing the risk for injury and/or NEC in transfused premature infants with already impaired intestinal oxygenation due to significant anemia. To evaluate these associations, we are examining the relationship between prolonged irradiation storage time (pIST), RBC metabolomic profiles, and anemia on intestinal oxygenation non-invasively measured by near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), and the development of NEC in transfused premature infants. DISCUSSION Our study will address a critical scientific gap as to whether transfused RBC characteristics, such as irradiation and metabolism, impair intestinal function and/or microvascular circulation. Given the multifactorial etiology of NEC, preventative efforts will be more successful if clinicians understand the underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms and modifiable risk factors influencing the disease.

METHODS We reviewed the medical records of 300 patients who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy, mastectomy with breast reconstruction and PMRT at our institution from 2000 to 2017. Reconstruction types included autologous flaps (AR), single-stage-direct-to-implant and two-stages expander/implant (TE/I). The primary endpoint was the rate of reconstruction complications including infection, skin and fat necrosis. Subgroup analysis compared rates of capsular contracture, implant rupture, implant exposure and overall implant failure in single-stage-direct-to-implant to TE/I. The secondary endpoint was identifying the time interval between surgery with immediate implant-based reconstruction and PMRT associated with lower probability of implant failure. Logistic regression models, Kaplan-Meier estimates and Polynomial regression were used to assess endpoints. RESULTS The median follow-up was 43.5 months. 29.3%, 28.3% and 42.4% of the cohort had AR, TE/I and single-stage-direct-to-implant D, respectively. The 5-year cumulative incidence rate of complications was 14.0%, 29.7% and 19.4% for AR, TE/I and single-stage-direct-to-implant, respectively (Log rank p = 0.02). Multivariate analysis showed significant association between TE/I and higher risk of infection (OR 8.1, p = 0.009) compared to AR, while single-stage-direct-to-implant and AR were comparable (OR 3.2, p = 0.2). On subgroup analysis, TE/I was significantly associated with higher rates of implant failure. The mean wait time to deliver PMRT after immediate reconstruction with no adjuvant chemotherapy was 8.4 and 10.7 weeks in single-stage-direct-to-implant and TE/I, respectively (p < 0.005). Delivering PMRT after 8 weeks of surgery yielded 10% probability of reconstruction failure in single-stage-direct-to-implant versus 40% in TE/I. CONCLUSION In comparison to two stages reconstruction, single-stage-direct-to-implant following neoadjuvant chemotherapy has lower complications and offers timely delivery of PMRT.","Naoum, George E; Oladeru, Oluwadamilola T; Niemierko, Andrzej; Salama, Laura; Winograd, Jonathan; Colwell, Amy; Arafat, Waleed O; Smith, Barbara; Ho, Alice; Taghian, Alphonse G",Breast cancer research and treatment,195,16

This study aimed to assess the health and performance of two pig lines divergently selected for residual feed intake (RFI) (low RFI (LRFI) v. high RFI (HRFI)) and housed in two contrasted hygiene conditions (poor v. good) using a 2×2 factorial design (n=40/group). The challenge period (Period 1), started on week zero (W0) when 12-week-old pigs were transferred to good or poor housing conditions. At week 6 (W6), half of the pigs in each group were slaughtered. During a recovery period (Period 2) from W6 to W13 to W14, the remaining pigs (n=20/group) were transferred in good hygiene conditions before being slaughtered. Blood was collected every three (Period 1) or 2 weeks (Period 2) to assess blood indicators of immune and inflammatory responses. Pulmonary lesions at slaughter and performance traits were evaluated. At W6, pneumonia prevalence was greater for pigs housed in poor than in good conditions (51% v. 8%, respectively, P<0.001). Irrespective of hygiene conditions, lung lesion scores were lower for LRFI pigs than for HRFI pigs (P=0.03). At W3, LRFI in poor conditions had the highest number of blood granulocytes (hygiene×line, P=0.03) and at W6, HRFI pigs in poor conditions had the greatest plasma haptoglobin concentrations (hygiene×line, P=0.02). During Period 1, growth rate and growth-to-feed ratio were less affected by poor hygiene in LRFI pigs than in HRFI pigs (hygiene×line, P=0.001 and P=0.02, respectively). Low residual feed intake pigs in poor conditions ate more than the other groups (hygiene×line, P=0.002). Irrespective of the line, fasting plasma glucose concentrations were higher in poor conditions, whereas fasting free fatty acids concentrations were lower than in good conditions. At the end of Period 2, pneumonia prevalence was similar for both housing conditions (39% v. 38%, respectively). During Period 2, plasma protein concentrations were greater for pigs previously housed in poor than in good conditions during Period 1. Immune traits, gain-to-feed ratio, BW gain and feed consumption did not differ during Period 2. Nevertheless, at W12, BW of HRFI previously housed in poor conditions was 13.4 kg lower than BW of HRFI pigs (P<0.001) previously housed in good conditions. In conclusion, health of the most feed efficient LRFI pigs was less impaired by poor hygiene conditions. This line was able to preserve its health, growth performance and its feed ingestion to a greater extent than the less efficient HRFI line.","Chatelet, A; Gondret, F; Merlot, E; Gilbert, H; Friggens, N C; Le Floc'h, N",Animal : an international journal of animal bioscience,195,31

The effect of Coronavirus disease on the lifestyle and economic status of humans is undeniable, and all of the researchers (biologists, pharmacists, physicians, and chemists) can help decrease its destructive effects. The molecular docking approach can provide a fast prediction of the positive influence the targets on the COVID-19 outbreak. In this work, we choose resveratrol (RV) derivatives (22 cases) and two newly released coordinate structures for COVID-19 as receptors [Papain-like Protease of SARS CoV-2 (PBD ID: 6W9C) and 2019-nCoV RNA-dependent RNA Polymerase (PBD ID: 6M71)]. The results show that conformational isomerism is significant and useful parameter for docking results. A wide spectrum of interactions such as Van der Waals, conventional hydrogen bond, Pi-donor hydrogen bond, Pi-Cation, Pi-sigma, Pi-Pi stacked, Amide-Pi stacked and Pi-Alkyl is detected via docking of RV derivatives and COVID-19 receptors.

The task force formulated specific issues regarding fat grafting and then compiled them to focus on five broad-based questions: 1. What are the current and potential applications of fat grafting (specifically breast indications, and if data are available, other cosmetic and reconstructive applications)? 2. What risks and complications are associated with fat grafting? 3. How does technique affect outcomes, including safety and efficacy, of fat grafting? 4. What risk factors need to be considered for patient selection at this level of invasiveness? 5. What advancements in bench research/molecular biology potentially impact current or future methods of fat grafting? To answer these questions, the task force reviewed the scientific literature, critically appraised the information available, and developed evidence-based practice recommendations.

Therefore, we aimed to determine the presence of any cardiac abnormalities in these patients. METHODS We conducted a cross-sectional study of children and adolescents with SMA types 2 and 3 between July 2018 and July 2019. All patients underwent a comprehensive cardiac evaluation, including history taking, physical examination, electrocardiography, echocardiography, measurement of cardiac biomarkers (cardiac troponin T (cTnT) and N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP)), and 24-hour Holter monitoring. RESULTS In total, 42 patients were enrolled (27 and 15 with SMA type 2 and 3, respectively). No patient had structural heart disease except for one with mitral valve prolapse. None had signs of ventricular dysfunction on echocardiography. Both cTnT and NT-proBNP levels were normal in all patients. ECG showed sinus tachycardia in 7 patients (16.7%), and prolonged PR interval in one (2.4%). Holter monitoring detected benign ventricular arrhythmias in 2 patients (4.8%), and rare supraventricular premature beats in one. The mean 24-hour heart rate was elevated in 6 patients (14.3%), while both the minimum 24-hour heart rate and the maximum RR interval were increased in 23 (54.8%). DISCUSSION The prevalence of cardiac disease in pediatric patients with SMA types 2 and 3 is low; however, these patients might have increased resting heart rates.

The contribution of local anesthetic with deep sedation is unknown. The objective was to evaluate EMLA (eutectic mixture of local anesthetics) cream as a pain reliever in conjunction with propofol in the setting of routine lumbar punctures. PROCEDURE We included patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia aged 3-21 years requiring at least two routine lumbar punctures. Patients were randomly assigned to receive EMLA or placebo cream and the alternate treatment with the second procedure. Patients, personnel and outcome assessors were blinded to allocation. The primary outcome included three indirect measures of pain: total median propofol doses, patient movement and heart rate changes at the time of skin puncture in both treatment groups. RESULTS Twenty-six patients were enrolled and 25 were analyzed. With EMLA cream, 4 mg/kg (median) of propofol was required (95% CI 3.5-4.4). With placebo, 4.9 mg/kg of propofol was needed (95% CI 4.3-5.6; P = 0.008). When EMLA cream was applied, 8% of patients moved, whereas 84% moved with placebo cream (P < 0.0001). There was a lower average heart rate by seven beats in the EMLA treatment compared to placebo (95% CI -2.3-4.3; 4.1-12.4; P = 0.009). There were no adverse events in either treatment group. CONCLUSIONS This study demonstrated that the combination of EMLA cream with propofol is beneficial. Topical analgesics are at the discretion of the oncologist, allowing us to advocate for patients by providing safe and efficacious pain management for lumbar punctures.","Whitlow, Puja G; Saboda, Kathylynn; Roe, Denise J; Bazzell, Susan; Wilson, Cera",Pediatric blood & cancer,195,17

Here, we show that FAs trigger caveolae-dependent CD36 internalization, which in turn delivers FAs into adipocytes. During the process, binding of FAs to CD36 activates its downstream kinase LYN, which phosphorylates DHHC5, the palmitoyl acyltransferase of CD36, at Tyr91 and inactivates it. CD36 then gets depalmitoylated by APT1 and recruits another tyrosine kinase SYK to phosphorylate JNK and VAVs to initiate endocytic uptake of FAs. Blocking CD36 internalization by inhibiting APT1, LYN or SYK abolishes CD36-dependent FA uptake. Restricting CD36 at either palmitoylated or depalmitoylated state eliminates its FA uptake activity, indicating an essential role of dynamic palmitoylation of CD36. Furthermore, blocking endocytosis by targeting LYN or SYK inhibits CD36-dependent lipid droplet growth in adipocytes and high-fat-diet induced weight gain in mice. Our study has uncovered a dynamic palmitoylation-regulated endocytic pathway to take up FAs.","Hao, Jian-Wei; Wang, Juan; Guo, Huiling; Zhao, Yin-Yue; Sun, Hui-Hui; Li, Yi-Fan; Lai, Xiao-Ying; Zhao, Ning; Wang, Xu; Xie, Changchuan; Hong, Lixin; Huang, Xi; Wang, Hong-Rui; Li, Cheng-Bin; Liang, Bin; Chen, Shuai; Zhao, Tong-Jin",Nature communications,195,16

AIMS Examine (1) the association between ADRD and severe pain in Medicare HH patients; and (2) the impact of severe pain and ADRD on unplanned facility admissions in this population. DESIGN Analysis of the Outcome and Assessment Information Set (OASIS) and Medicare claims data. SETTINGS/PARTICIPANTS 6,153 patients ≥65 years receiving care from a nonprofit HH agency in 2017. METHODS Study outcomes included presence of severe pain and time-to-event measures of unplanned facility admissions (hospital, nursing home, or rehabilitation facilities). ADRD was identified using ICD-10 diagnosis codes and cognitive impairment symptoms. Logistic regression and Cox proportional hazard models were used to examine, respectively, the association between ADRD and severe pain, and the independent and interaction effects of severe pain and ADRD on unplanned facility admission. RESULTS Patients with ADRD (n = 1,525, 24.8%) were less likely to have recorded severe pain than others (16.4% vs. 23.6%, p < .001). Adjusting for demographics, comorbidities, mental and physical functional status, and use of HH services, having severe pain was related to a 35% increase (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.35, p = .002) in the risk of unplanned facility admission, but the increase in such risk was the same whether or not the patient had ADRD.

John Hunter (1728-1793), in a letter to Edward Jenner. August 2nd, 1775. When Galen of Pergamum (2nd c. A.D.), physician, philosopher and experimentalist, sought to ascertain the therapeutic properties of Theriac, an antidote of repute against poisons, he resorted to an experiment. Theriac or Theriaca was a compound drug, containing in some versions used in antiquity numerous components; Galen's own composition included over 70 ingredients! One of its uses was as an antidote against snakebites, a frequent peril for the Roman armies marching on in sandals. Galen spent most of his life in Rome and was elevated to Imperial Physician at the court of Marcus Aurelius, who apparently took daily doses of Theriac, which among other components included opium. Describing the experiment to his friend Pison, Galen wrote, ""as I could not possibly conduct a trial on humans, I experimented on roosters"" For his experiment, Galen, studied two groups of roosters, but he doesn't tell us how many animals he included in each category. Both groups were exposed to poisonous snakebites. All roosters who were fed with theriac prior to exposure to viper bites survived, whereas in the second group that had not received prophylactic Theriac, all roosters died. Not only is Galen's methodology remarkable, preceding the modern randomised trial by eighteen centuries, but more importantly, it is notable for his ethical stance at a time when sensitivities about human rights, prevalent in our times, were largely absent in societies of widespread slavery. For example, Mithridates VI (132-63 BC), the King of Pontus who is credited with the first use of Theriac, tested its efficacy on criminals and slaves. For his experiment Galen used the random allocation of treatment, today's prospective randomised clinical trial, implemented in the evaluation of novel therapies, widely used internationally, particularly in cancer research! This experimental method used for ascertaining the efficacy of new drugs became established after the second half of the 20th century and is now firmly entrenched as a research tool. On the other hand, the retrieval of information from observational studies or non-randomised series is considered scientifically inferior and is often dismissed or ignored as irrelevant or anecdotal. Such is the compulsion for the randomised study that in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, respected physicians and scientists appeared in the media hesitant to recommend the use of protective facial masks, as there was no evidence of benefit for their use from prospective randomised studies in the general population! Logic had no place in the argument! COVID-19, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 new corona virus, brought to the fore the randomised trial, as well as, the ethical dilemmas that surround the allocation of treatment at random, in the face of a devastating pandemic. Anthony Fauci, distinguished infectious diseases expert and an adviser to the President of the USA, at a recent briefing from the Situation Room of the White House, endorsed categorically and unreservedly the randomised trial for the evaluation of drugs potentially effective against SARS-CoV-2, in patients afflicted with COVID-19. A few days later on April 8th, 2020, Professor Sotiris Tsiodras, scientific advisor to the Greek Government for COVID-19 and an expert on infectious diseases, when asked by a journalist about chloroquine, he responded, ""Antony Fauci is correct. Nevertheless, we give the drug to everyone, that is, not half of the patients will receive it, and the other half will not"". If we accept that the randomised trial represents the unique, impregnable method of evaluating new treatments-several clinicians dispute this dogma. -the question arises how will treatments be allocated to patients? According to the Declaration of Helsinki participation of a subject in a clinical trial requires their explicit written consent. Will, a potentially hypoxic patient rapidly deteriorating, be able to understand what is being asked of them, and will that patient be in a position to provide consent? And if that patient refuses to be randomised, what are the options? Is it his/her right to request the active treatment that a fellow patient is receiving in the next bed? Although the Declaration of Helsinki allows the option of no treatment or even placebo, where no known treatment is available for a certain condition, such as COVID-19, it also emphasizes that ""while the primary purpose of medical research is to generate new knowledge, this goal can never take precedence over the rights and interests of individual research subjects"". Consider now the physicians and nurses on the first line of the battle against the pandemic; to the enormous pressures and risks that they experience daily, they may have to endure the added psychological burden of the randomised trial, knowing that half of their patients are receiving the promising drug, whilst the other half are denied the chance of potential benefit. When during the Medical Research Council's randomized trial of streptomycin, one senior physician contracted tuberculosis, the Medical Research Council obtained supplies for him outside the trial. In this brief instance of medical history, the equipoise, the scientific imperative, all arguments and other justifications for providing treatment at random, were thrown out of the window in favour of the human factor! Why is randomization necessary? Because-it is presumed-the process of randomising subjects, protects the study from the selective inclusion of patients with favourable characteristics, thus inadvertently allowing or facilitating a falsely favourable result for the drug or treatment under investigation. However, the process of randomising patients does not necessarily result in the randomisation of the characteristics of their disease. Exactly because of this, at the end of a randomised study, even if the prognostic variables are evenly represented and balanced in the strata, further confirmation of the result is sought with a statistical multifactorial analysis. Such multifactorial analyses can also be applied to a non-randomised group of patients engaged in the trial of a new drug. Since the middle of the 20th century a generation of physicians have been trained to dismiss, or are incapable of evaluating the validity of a treatment beyond the established etiquette of the randomised study. This, some have argued, constitutes intellectual indolence, it is not scientific robustness. Pandits foresee that the world will be different after the end of this pandemic. Perhaps human ingenuity will seek new investigative methods that will render the randomised clinical trial obsolete, both, on methodological and ethical grounds. Until then and even if we have to accept the scientific supremacy of the randomised study in the evaluation of novel therapies, the ethical considerations in the unprecedented circumstances of a relentless pandemic demand a more humane approach, befitting the beneficent precepts of the Hippocratic tradition.","Retsas, Spyros",Hellenic journal of nuclear medicine,195,1

Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis: JTH 2018 Jul; 16(7): 1288-95.,17.302261,9.865386,2021-09-01,"The 44-year-old female was admitted to the hospital due to the severe pain in the right arm. Doppler ultrasonography revealed occlusion of the right brachial and right common carotid artery. Subsequently, computed tomography (CT) scan confirmed the occlusion of the right brachial and common carotid artery, and revealed pedunculated floating ascending aortic mass. The floating thrombus in ascending aorta is a rare and potentially very dangerous pathological condition. Although aetiology is still unclear, ascending aorta atherosclerosis and coagulation disorder are probably the most common reasons. Hypercoagulable state, high level of antiphospholipid antibody and factor VIII are closely relating with vascular thrombosis. Since the outbreak of the coronavirus-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, increasing evidence suggests that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) might produce hypercoagulable state with subsequent thrombosis and thromboembolism. The infection elevated the level of factor VIII in the blood and, consequently, increased the risk of adverse thrombotic and embolic events. Additionally, endothelial inflammation and injury mediated by coronavirus represent an additional risk factor. According to literature, this is the first case of the floating ascending aorta thrombus in the patient with SARS-CoV-2 infection. The thrombus' fragile structure and high blood velocity through the ascending aorta significantly increases cerebral and peripheral embolization incidence, with potentially fatal outcome. Due to frequent adverse events, urgent surgical extirpation is the best therapy option. We presented successfully surgically treated giant floating thrombus in the ascending aorta and aortic arch in a patient with recent SARS-CoV-2 infection with acute right arm ischemia due to embolic complication.","Zivkovic, Igor; Milacic, Petar; Mihajlovic, Vladimir; Krasic, Stasa; Lesanovic, Jelena; Peric, Miodrag; Zdravkovic, Djordje",Cardiovascular diagnosis and therapy,195,1

Dexmedetomidine, an α(2)-agonist available for ICU sedation, may reduce the duration of mechanical ventilation and enhance patient comfort. OBJECTIVE To determine the efficacy of dexmedetomidine vs midazolam or propofol (preferred usual care) in maintaining sedation; reducing duration of mechanical ventilation; and improving patients' interaction with nursing care. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS Two phase 3 multicenter, randomized, double-blind trials carried out from 2007 to 2010. The MIDEX trial compared midazolam with dexmedetomidine in ICUs of 44 centers in 9 European countries; the PRODEX trial compared propofol with dexmedetomidine in 31 centers in 6 European countries and 2 centers in Russia. Included were adult ICU patients receiving mechanical ventilation who needed light to moderate sedation for more than 24 hours (midazolam, n = 251, vs dexmedetomidine, n = 249; propofol, n = 247, vs dexmedetomidine, n = 251). INTERVENTIONS Sedation with dexmedetomidine, midazolam, or propofol; daily sedation stops; and spontaneous breathing trials. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES For each trial, we tested whether dexmedetomidine was noninferior to control with respect to proportion of time at target sedation level (measured by Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale) and superior to control with respect to duration of mechanical ventilation. Secondary end points were patients' ability to communicate pain (measured using a visual analogue scale [VAS]) and length of ICU stay. Time at target sedation was analyzed in per-protocol population (midazolam, n = 233, vs dexmedetomidine, n = 227; propofol, n = 214, vs dexmedetomidine, n = 223). RESULTS Dexmedetomidine/midazolam ratio in time at target sedation was 1.07 (95% CI, 0.97-1.18) and dexmedetomidine/propofol, 1.00 (95% CI, 0.92-1.08). Median duration of mechanical ventilation appeared shorter with dexmedetomidine (123 hours [IQR, 67-337]) vs midazolam (164 hours [IQR, 92-380]; P = .03) but not with dexmedetomidine (97 hours [IQR, 45-257]) vs propofol (118 hours [IQR, 48-327]; P = .24). Patients' interaction (measured using VAS) was improved with dexmedetomidine (estimated score difference vs midazolam, 19.7 [95% CI, 15.2-24.2]; P < .001; and vs propofol, 11.2 [95% CI, 6.4-15.9]; P < .001). Length of ICU and hospital stay and mortality were similar. Dexmedetomidine vs midazolam patients had more hypotension (51/247 [20.6%] vs 29/250 [11.6%]; P = .007) and bradycardia (35/247 [14.2%] vs 13/250 [5.2%]; P < .001). CONCLUSIONS Among ICU patients receiving prolonged mechanical ventilation, dexmedetomidine was not inferior to midazolam and propofol in maintaining light to moderate sedation. Dexmedetomidine reduced duration of mechanical ventilation compared with midazolam and improved patients' ability to communicate pain compared with midazolam and propofol. More adverse effects were associated with dexmedetomidine.

GBF1 is a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Arf family members. Recently, we identified Arf4 and Arf5 (class II Arfs) as host factors required for the replication of hepatitis C virus (HCV), a GBF1-dependent virus. To assess whether a GBF1/class II Arf pathway is conserved among positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses, we investigated yellow fever virus (YFV), Sindbis virus (SINV), coxsackievirus B4 (CVB4) and human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E). We found that GBF1 is involved in the replication of these viruses. However, using siRNA or CRISPR-Cas9 technologies, it was seen that the depletion of Arf1, Arf3, Arf4 or Arf5 had no impact on viral replication. In contrast, the depletion of Arf pairs suggested that class II Arfs could be involved in HCoV-229E, YFV and SINV infection, as for HCV, but not in CVB4 infection. In addition, another Arf pair, Arf1 and Arf4, appears to be essential for YFV and SINV infection, but not for infection by other viruses. Finally, CVB4 infection was not inhibited by any combination of Arf depletion.

METHODS The prospective cohort study included patients suffering from midline hernias equal to or bigger than 2 cm size and associated diastasis recti, from April 2011 to October 2012. Full endoscopic subcutaneous approach is used to perform the surgery. An ultrasound scan was carried out to identify inter-rectus distances and recurrences in xiphoid, 3 cm supraumbilical and 2 cm subumbilical locations. RESULTS A total of 21 patients were included in the study, with a mean follow-up of 20 months. The main complication was seroma. A significant reduction in the average distance between the rectus muscles was shown before surgery and at 1 month postoperative measures in all three locations (p < 0.001). No significant differences between the measured distances to the first and second year. A significant improvement at first postoperative year in cosmetic outcome compared with preoperative cosmetic condition (p < 0.001) was confirmed. Back pain improves significantly when diastasis recti is surgically corrected. CONCLUSIONS Totally endoscopic approach to diastasis recti associated with midline hernias is a feasible and reproducible method. It brings considerable esthetic advantages. Diastasis or hernia recurrences in medium term follow-up have not been observed. Diastasis greater than 6-7 cm or associated with severe musculoaponeurotic laxity of the abdominal wall could benefit from the use of reinforced prosthesis.","Bellido Luque, Juan; Bellido Luque, A; Valdivia, J; Suarez Gráu, J M; Gomez Menchero, J; García Moreno, J; Guadalajara Jurado, J",Hernia : the journal of hernias and abdominal wall surgery,195,17

A substantial part of this variation is due to the presence of transposable elements (TEs). They contribute significantly to a cell's mass of DNA and have the potential to become involved in host gene control. We argue that the suppression of their activities by methylation of the C-phosphate-G (CpG) dinucleotide in DNA is essential for their long-term accommodation in the host genome and, therefore, to its expansion. An inevitable consequence of cytosine methylation is an increase in C-to-T transition mutations via deamination, which causes CpG loss. Cytosine deamination is often needed for TEs to take on regulatory functions in the host genome. Our study of the whole-genome sequences of 53 organisms showed a positive correlation between the size of a genome and the percentage of TEs it contains, as well as a negative correlation between size and the CpG observed/expected (O/E) ratio in both TEs and the host DNA. TEs are seldom found at promoters and transcription start sites, but they are found more at enhancers, particularly after they have accumulated C-to-T and other mutations. Therefore, the methylation of TE DNA allows for genome expansion and also leads to new opportunities for gene control by TE-based regulatory sites.","Zhou, Wanding; Liang, Gangning; Molloy, Peter L; Jones, Peter A",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,195,1

However, the gradual ease of these measures may initiate a second epidemic wave, the length and intensity of which are difficult to anticipate. In this context, hospitals must prepare for a potential increase in intensive care unit (ICU) admissions of patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome. Here, we introduce icumonitoring.ch, a platform providing hospital-level projections for ICU occupancy. We combined current data on the number of beds and ventilators with canton-level projections of COVID-19 cases from two S-E-I-R models. We disaggregated epidemic projection in each hospital in Switzerland for the number of COVID-19 cases, hospitalisations, hospitalisations in ICU, and ventilators in use. The platform is updated every 3-4 days and can incorporate projections from other modelling teams to inform decision makers with a range of epidemic scenarios for future hospital occupancy.","Zhao, Cheng; Tepekule, Burcu; Criscuolo, Nicola G; Wendel Garcia, Pedro D; Hilty, Matthias P; Risc-Icu Consortium Investigators In Switzerland,; Fumeaux, Thierry; Van Boeckel, Thomas",Swiss medical weekly,195,1

Despite the widespread use of DES in patients who undergo percutaneous coronary intervention, the optimal treatment for DES restenosis remains poorly defined. A systematic search of electronic resources was performed. The primary end point was diameter stenosis at follow-up angiography. Seven trials were included, enrolling a total of 1,586 patients with 1,728 restenotic lesions. The following treatment options were found: balloon angioplasty (BA) in 343 patients (19.3%), iopromide-based paclitaxel-eluting balloons (PEB) in 343 (21.6%), sirolimus-eluting stents in 441 (27.8%), paclitaxel-eluting stents in 462 (29.1%), and everolimus-eluting stents in 34 (2.2%). Compared with BA, PEB (-17.74%, 95% credible interval [CI] -25.17% to -11.31%), everolimus-eluting stents (-14.93%, 95% CI -33.47% to 1.16%), paclitaxel-eluting stents (-15.3%, 95% CI -22.96% to -8.35%), and sirolimus-eluting stents (-11.08%, 95% CI -17.89% to -3.4%) had similar reductions in diameter stenosis at follow-up angiography. PEB (85%) and everolimus-eluting stents (68%) had the greatest probabilities for being the best treatment option. Furthermore, PEB were the best treatment in terms of late luminal loss (85%) and binary restenosis (85%). BA had the lowest efficacy with respect to all study end points. In conclusion, in patients with DES restenosis, repeat DES implantation and iopromide-based PEB are valid alternatives. However, PEB had greater angiographic efficacy and therefore should be considered the new benchmark comparator in the treatment of DES restenosis. The use of BA should be discouraged in patients with DES restenosis.","Piccolo, Raffaele; Galasso, Gennaro; Piscione, Federico; Esposito, Giovanni; Trimarco, Bruno; Dangas, George D; Mehran, Roxana",The American journal of cardiology,195,31

Methods: A systematic review comprising an extensive literature search conducted in PubMed, Embase, Google Scholar, and PsycINFO in August 2020 with monthly updates until November 1st, 2020. In addition, we performed a citation search and scanned reference lists. Clinical trials that performed an EEG-based examination on an adult patient group diagnosed with melancholic unipolar depression and compared with a control group of non-melancholic unipolar depression and/or healthy controls were eligible. Risk of bias was assessed by the Strengthening of Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) checklist. Results: A total of 24 studies, all case-control design, met the inclusion criteria and could be divided into three subgroups: Resting state studies (n = 5), sleep EEG studies (n = 10), and event-related potentials (ERP) studies (n = 9). Within each subgroup, studies were characterized by marked variability on almost all levels, preventing pooling of data, and many studies were subject to weighty methodological problems. However, the main part of the studies identified one or several EEG parameters that differentiated the groups. Conclusions: Multiple EEG modalities showed an ability to distinguish melancholic patients from non-melancholic patients and/or healthy controls. The considerable heterogeneity across studies and the frequent methodological difficulties at the individual study level were the main limitations to this work. Also, the underlying premise of shifting diagnostic paradigms may have resulted in an inhomogeneous patient population.

High-copy DNA repeats can serve as building blocks of complex DNA structures, but the in vitro synthesis of DNA repeats has been challenging due to complicated procedures and the high cost. Here, a new, simple method is developed using the strategy of blocking polymerase chain reaction for highly efficient DNA repeat expansion (BPRE). With BPRE, dsDNA fragments composed of more than 40 copies of the repeat sequence can be quickly produced, while the cost is reduced by at least 90%. As a typical application, reannealing of the dsDNA repeats generates elastic hydrogels, which shows a high capacity for doxycycline absorption and prolonged release.","Wang, Xin; Yang, Xuerui",Small,195,1

DESIGN Prospective observational study. SETTING Delivery room. PATIENTS Newborn infants requiring respiratory stabilisation after birth. INTERVENTIONS In addition to pulse oximetry (PO) and ECG, dEMG was measured with skin electrodes for 30 min after birth. OUTCOME MEASURES We assessed signal quality of dEMG and ECG recording, agreement between heart rate (HR) measured by dEMG and ECG or PO, time between sensor application and first HR read-out and agreement between respiratory rate (RR) measured with dEMG and ECG, compared with airway flow. Furthermore, we analysed peak, tonic and amplitude diaphragmatic activity from the dEMG-based respiratory waveform. RESULTS Thirty-three infants (gestational age: 31.7±2.8 weeks, birth weight: 1525±661 g) were included.18%±14% and 22%±21% of dEMG and ECG data showed poor quality, respectively. Monitoring HR with dEMG was fast (median 10 (IQR 10-11) s) and accurate (intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) 0.92 and 0.82 compared with ECG and PO, respectively). RR monitoring with dEMG showed moderate (ICC 0.49) and ECG low (ICC 0.25) agreement with airway flow. Diaphragm activity started high with a decreasing trend in the first 15 min and subsequent stabilisation. CONCLUSION Monitoring vital signs with dEMG in the DR is feasible and fast. Diaphragm activity can be detected and described with dEMG, making dEMG promising for future DR studies.","van Leuteren, Ruud W; Kho, Eline; de Waal, Cornelia G; Te Pas, Arjan B; Salverda, Hylke H; de Jongh, Frans H; van Kaam, Anton H; Hutten, Gerard J",Archives of disease in childhood.

Recent systematic reviews of early childhood obesity prevention interventions have not adequately reported on the way interventions are delivered and the experiences/perceptions of stakeholders. We aimed to summarise the literature in early childhood obesity prevention interventions delivered via telephone or text messages for evidence of application of process evaluation primarily to evaluate stakeholders' acceptability of interventions. METHODS A systematic search of major electronic databases was carried out using the Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcomes framework. Studies were included if interventions were delivered via telephone/text messages; aimed at changing caregivers' behaviours to prevent early childhood obesity; with one or more outcomes related to early obesity risk factors such as breastfeeding, solid feeding, tummy time, sleep and settling, physical activity and screen time; published from inception to May 2020. All eligible studies were independently assessed by two reviewers using the Cochrane Collaboration tool for assessing risk of bias. Qualitative studies were assessed using the Consolidated Criteria for Reporting Qualitative Research and Standards for Reporting Qualitative Research tools. RESULTS Twenty-four studies were eligible, and the overall risk of bias was low. Eight studies (33%) had evidence of process evaluation that examined participants' perceptions of interventions. Participants appreciated the convenience of receiving interventions via telephone or text messages. 63% of all studies in this review showed improvement in one or more behaviours related to childhood obesity prevention. Participants were likely to modify behaviours if they received information from a credible source such as from health professionals. CONCLUSION There is limited reporting of stakeholders' experiences in early obesity prevention studies delivered by telephone or text messages. Only one-third of studies examined participants' acceptability and the potential for delivery of childhood obesity prevention interventions conveniently using this mode of delivery. Interventions delivered remotely via telephone or text messages have the potential to reach equal or a greater number of participants than those delivered via face-to-face methods. Future research should build in process evaluation alongside effectiveness measurements to provide important insight into intervention reach, acceptability and to inform scale up.

We conducted a telephone survey of Beijing residents to evaluate potential behavioural changes in the general public in the event of an influenza pandemic occurring. We used a two-stage Mitofsky-Waksberg telephone survey of Beijing residents aged 15 years. The sample was weighted to reflect the 2000 census. We asked the respondents about their current healthcare-seeking behaviours for influenza-like illness (ILI), protective measures (personal hygiene, social distancing), and compliance with health authorities. We then asked what they would do during a hypothetical pandemic. We interviewed 256 Beijing participants in our study (response rate 56%). The percent of participants consulting a doctor for ILI rose from the current 41% [95% confidence interval (CI) 35-47] to 74% (95% CI 68-79) during a pandemic. Fifty-five percent (95% CI 48-62) of the participants would seek care from a more specialized hospital during a pandemic than currently. More than 90% of the participants reported already practising hand-washing or covering their coughs or sneezes during a non-pandemic period; this percentage changed little under a pandemic scenario. Compared to the current social distancing practices, more people would avoid crowded places (77% vs. 92%, P<0.01), use a mask outside the home (10% vs. 58%, P<0.01), and take time off from work or school (17% vs. 38%, P<0.01) during a pandemic. Moreover, 26% of the participants (95% CI 21-32) would stockpile food or water, and 55% (95% CI 49-61) would stockpile medicines. Some of the behavioural changes reported by Beijing participants might help to alleviate the damage caused by a potential pandemic. However, increased use of medical care at referral hospitals will further strain the healthcare system during a pandemic.","Yuan, J; Zhang, L; Xu, W; Shen, J; Zhang, P; Ma, H",Epidemiology and infection,195,16

Currently, only Infrared Thermography (IRT) is used for screening and measuring facial skin temperature, which is one of clinical indicators of potential infection. Aiming at higher accuracy in screening, our group adopted heart rate (HR) and respiration rate (RR) for the first time as the new screening parameters. In our previous study, we proposed a screening system based on dual image sensors, which include IRT and a charged-coupled devices (CCD) camera. The sensors can measure three vital signs simultaneously, namely HR, RR, and facial skin temperature. For the measurement of RR in this system, stability and swiftness must be applied for application in airports. In this study, we introduce feature matching and multiple signal classification (MUSIC) algorithm in this system. Feature matching between thermal images and RGB images captured by a CCD camera and IRT, respectively, is used to detect the nose and mouth in IRT, which helps extract respiration signals corresponding to airflow from breathing. In addition, the MUSIC algorithm improves the accuracy of RR frequency estimations in limited time respiration signal and achieves swiftness. The proposed method improves stability by simultaneously detecting the nose and mouth in thermal images, and enhances the accuracy of estimated RR using the MUSIC algorithm. By using this system, we evaluate the accuracy of the estimated vital signs. The performance of this screening system was evaluated using data obtained from 12 influenza patients and 13 healthy subjects at a clinical facility in Fukushima, Japan.","Negishi, Toshiaki; Sun, Guanghao; Sato, Shohei; Liu, He; Matsui, Takemi; Abe, Shigeto; Nishimura, Hidekazu; Kirimoto, Tetsuo",Conference proceedings : ...

One reason for this lack of clarity is that most studies employ a single neural recording modality-each with strengths and weaknesses-with few examples of integrating results across modalities. To address this gap, we conducted a secondary analysis that combined data from an overlapping set of subjects in previously published electroencephalographic and functional magnetic resonance imaging studies that used nearly identical working memory tasks (visual change detection). The prior studies found similar patterns of results for both posterior parietal BOLD activation and suppression of the alpha frequency band within the EEG. Specifically, both signals exhibited abnormally shallow modulation as a function of the amount of information being stored in WM in PSZ. In the present study, both alpha suppression and posterior parietal BOLD activity increased as the number of items stored in WM increased. The magnitude of alpha suppression modulation was correlated with the magnitude of BOLD signal modulation in PSZ, but not in HCS. This finding suggests that the same illness-related biological processes constrain both alpha suppression and BOLD signal modulation as a function of WM storage in PSZ. The complementary strengths of these two techniques may thus combine to advance the identification of the processes underlying WM deficits in PSZ.","Erickson, Molly A; Hahn, Britta; Kiat, John E; Alliende, Luz Maria; Luck, Steven J; Gold, James M",Schizophrenia research,195,12

METHODS Tendon repairs were performed on 16 cadaver flexor digitorum profundus tendons using either a 4-strand double Kessler repair or a similar but knotless 4-strand repair with a unidirectional barbed suture. Work of flexion, gap resistance during cyclical loading, and ultimate strength of both techniques were determined and their means compared. RESULTS There was no difference in mean maximum load and gap formation between the 2 techniques. Work of flexion was higher for the barbed-suture repair group compared with the traditional repair group (39 N·mm vs 31 N·mm). CONCLUSIONS The higher work of flexion in the barbed-suture group suggests that barbed suture may negatively affect tendon gliding within the flexor tendon sheath.

The opacification of the superficial middle cerebral vein (SMCV) on computed tomography perfusion (CTP) has been associated with poor functional outcomes after stroke, while its association with PH has not been verified for acute stroke patients undergoing thrombectomy. Methods Consecutive patients with acute anterior large artery occlusion (LAO) who received thrombectomy were retrospectively enrolled between May 2018 and May 2019. Absent filing of the SMCV (SMCV-) on CTP-derived CT angiography was defined as no contrast filling of the SMCV across the whole venous phase in the ischemic hemisphere, while SMCV+ was defined as the presence of contrast filling of the SMCV at any time point of the venous phase. Results A total of 52 patients were enrolled in the study, and 15 patients (28.8%) developed a PH within 48 hours after thrombectomy. SMCV- was not associated with PH in both the univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses (all P>0.05), but was an independent risk factor for reperfusion [modified thrombolysis in cerebral infarction score of 2b-3; odds ratio (OR) =0.172, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.031-0.960, P=0.045]. Reperfusion was associated with a reduced risk of PH (OR =0.110, 95% CI: 0.013-0.913, P=0.041). However, in a subgroup analysis of patients who had reperfusion, the SMCV- group had a higher rate of PH than the SMCV+ group (40.0% vs. 13.8%, P=0.049). Conclusions In patients who received thrombectomy, SMCV- did not predict PH, but was a risk factor for reperfusion. Although reperfusion was a protective factor for PH, the SMCV- group was still at a higher risk of PH compared with the SMCV+ group when reperfusion was successfully achieved.","Zhang, Sheng; Zhang, Ruiting; Jin, Bo; Shi, Zongjie; Li, Chenguang; Yu, Yannan; Wang, Zhen",Annals of translational medicine,195,16

However, there is a need to strengthen health research governance and create a conducive environment that can promote ethics and research integrity and increase public trust in research. OBJECTIVE To assess whether the necessary structures are in place to ensure health research governance. METHODS Employing a cross-sectional survey, we collected data on research governance components from 35 Member States of the World Health Organization (WHO) African Region. Data were analysed using basic descriptive and comparative analysis. RESULTS Eighteen out of 35 countries had legislation to regulate the conduct of health research, while this was lacking in 12 countries. Some legislation was either grossly outdated or too limiting in scope, while some countries had multiple laws. Health research policies and strategies were in place in 16 and 15 countries, respectively, while research priority lists were available in 25 countries. Overlapping mandates of institutions responsible for health research partly explained the lack of strategic documents in some countries. The majority of countries had ethical committees performing a dual role of ethical and scientific review. Research partnership frameworks were available to varying degrees to govern both in-country and north-south research collaboration. Twenty-five countries had a focal point and unit within the ministries of health (MoH) to coordinate research. CONCLUSION Governance structures must be adaptive to embrace new developments in science. Further, strong coordination is key to ensuring comprehensiveness and complementarity in both research development and generation of evidence. The majority of committees perform a dual role of ethics and scientific review, and these need to ensure representation of relevant expertise. Opportunities that accrue from collaborative research need to be seized through strong MoH leadership and clear partnership frameworks that guide negotiations.","Nabyonga-Orem, Juliet; Asamani, James Avoka; Makanga, Micheal",Health research policy and systems,195,16

We examined disability, quality of life, survival and acute care costs in the EXTEND-IA trial, which used CT-perfusion imaging selection. Methods Large vessel ischemic stroke patients with favorable CT-perfusion were randomized to endovascular thrombectomy after alteplase versus alteplase-only. Clinical outcome was prospectively measured using 90-day modified Rankin scale (mRS). Individual patient expected survival and net difference in Disability/Quality-adjusted life years (DALY/QALY) up to 15 years from stroke were modeled using age, sex, 90-day mRS, and utility scores. Level of care within the first 90 days was prospectively measured and used to estimate procedure and inpatient care costs (US$ reference year 2014). Results There were 70 patients, 35 in each arm, mean age 69, median NIHSS 15 (IQR 12-19). The median (IQR) disability-weighted utility score at 90 days was 0.65 (0.00-0.91) in the alteplase-only versus 0.91 (0.65-1.00) in the endovascular group (p = 0.005). Modeled life expectancy was greater in the endovascular versus alteplase-only group (median 15.6 versus 11.2 years, p = 0.02). The endovascular thrombectomy group had fewer simulated DALYs lost over 15 years [median (IQR) 5.5 (3.2-8.7) versus 8.9 (4.7-13.8), p = 0.02] and more QALY gained [median (IQR) 9.3 (4.2-13.1) versus 4.9 (0.3-8.5), p = 0.03]. Endovascular patients spent less time in hospital [median (IQR) 5 (3-11) days versus 8 (5-14) days, p = 0.04] and rehabilitation [median (IQR) 0 (0-28) versus 27 (0-65) days, p = 0.03]. The estimated inpatient costs in the first 90 days were less in the thrombectomy group (average US$15,689 versus US$30,569, p = 0.008) offsetting the costs of interhospital transport and the thrombectomy procedure (average US$10,515). The average saving per patient treated with thrombectomy was US$4,365. Conclusion Thrombectomy patients with large vessel occlusion and salvageable tissue on CT-perfusion had reduced length of stay and overall costs to 90 days. There was evidence of clinically relevant improvement in long-term survival and quality of life.

DESIGN Multicenter, randomized, double-blind, crossover study (NCT00617461). SETTING Thirty-five outpatient centers in Germany and the United States. SUBJECTS Subjects aged ≥18 years with a diagnosis of PHN. METHODS During a 2-week baseline period, subjects received open-label treatment with 1,800 mg/day gabapentin. Subjects who had a mean 24-hour average pain intensity score ≥4 during the last 7 days of the baseline period were randomized to receive GEn (1,200 or 3,600 mg/day) for treatment period 1 (28 days), followed by GEn 2,400 mg/day (4 days), and the alternate GEn dose for treatment period 2 (28 days). RESULTS There was a modest but significant improvement in pain intensity scores with GEn 3,600 mg vs 1,200 mg (adjusted mean [90% confidence interval] treatment difference, -0.29 [-0.48 to -0.10]; P = 0.013). The difference in efficacy between doses was observed primarily in subjects who received the higher dose during treatment period 2; certain aspects of the study design may have contributed to this outcome. Plasma steady-state gabapentin exposure during GEn treatment was as expected and consistent between treatment periods. No new safety signals or adverse event trends relating to GEn exposure were identified. CONCLUSIONS While the overall results demonstrated efficacy in a PHN population, the differences between treatment periods confound the interpretation. These findings could provide insight into future trial designs.","Harden, R Norman; Freeman, Roy; Rainka, Michelle; Zhang, Lixin; Bell, Chris; Berges, Alienor; Chen, Chao; Graff, Ole; Harding, Kathleen; Hunter, Setrina; Kavanagh, Sarah; Schwartzbach, Caryl; Warren, Samantha; McClung, Carrie",Pain medicine,195,13

DESIGN Online survey open from 2nd June 2020 to 15th July 2020. SETTING United Kingdom. PARTICIPANTS Lead Midwives for Education (LMEs). FINDINGS A total of 38 of 55 LMEs responded (response rate 69%). The majority of Approved Education Institutions (AEIs) offered an extended placement to students, but with some variation in the choices offered, unrelated to geographical location or size of student cohort. AEIs appeared to provide the majority of decisional support for students. Many practice learning environments became unavailable, particularly community, gynaecology/medical wards and neonatal units. LMEs experienced both internal and external pressures to instigate rapid change. KEY CONCLUSIONS The impact of COVID-19 on midwifery education is significant and will need continual scrutiny to minimise future detriment. The pressures of providing midwifery education throughout the early phase of COVID-19 were substantial, but it is important that we learn from the immediate changes made, value and pursue the changes that have been beneficial, and learn from those that were not. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE/RESEARCH Student learning experiences have undergone significant change during the pandemic. It is essential to assess what effect the extended placement has had on student readiness for practice, their confidence, resilience, mental health, and attrition and retention. Educators transitioned to remote working, and rapidly assimilated new skills for online education; exploration of the impact of this is recommended.","Cooke, Alison; Hancock, Angela; White, Helen; Clark, Nicky; Gibb, Fiona; McNeill, Jenny; Thomas, Grace; Lloyd, Carmel; Furber, Christine",Midwifery,195,16

OBJECTIVES To evaluate the effectiveness of exercise-based muscle injury prevention strategies in adult elite football. METHODS A systematic search was conducted in PubMed (MEDLINE), Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and SPORTDiscuss (EBSCO). We considered only elite adult (> 16 year-old) football players with no distinction for gender; the intervention to be any exercise/s performed with the target to prevent lower-limb muscle injuries; the comparison to be no injury prevention exercise undertaken; the outcome to be the number of injuries, injury incidence, and severity. We searched systematic reviews, randomized-controlled trials (RCTs), and non-randomized-controlled trials (NRCTs), limited for English language. Risk of bias was assessed using the Risk of Bias in Systematic Reviews tool, the Cochrane Collaboration's Tool for assessing risk of bias in RCTs, and the Risk of Bias in NRCTs of Interventions tool. RESULTS 15 studies were included. Three systematic reviews showed inconsistent results, with one supporting (high risk of bias) and two showing insufficient evidence (low risk of bias) to support exercise-based strategies to prevent muscle injuries in elite players. Five RCTs and seven NRCTs support eccentric exercise, proprioception exercises, and a multi-dimensional component to an injury prevention program; however, all were deemed to be at high/critical risk of bias. Only one RCT was found at low risk of bias and supported eccentric exercise for preventing groin problems. CONCLUSION We found limited scientific evidence to support exercise-based strategies to prevent muscle injury in elite footballers.

We previously showed that progesterone (P4) inhibited lung cancer tumorigenesis and progression. Here, we investigated the effects of P4 on expression of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) and target mRNAs in lung cancer cells. METHODS We performed high-throughput microarray and bioinformatics analysis to identify differentially expressed lncRNAs and mRNAs in the untreated and the P4-treated A549 human lung cancer cells. RESULTS A total of 692 lncRNAs and 268 mRNAs were significantly differentially expressed in the P4-treated A549 cells compared to the untreated A549 cells (>2-fold change, P < 0.05). Of the lncRNAs, 82 and 610 were upregulated and downregulated, respectively. Gene ontology, pathway, and network analyses showed that many of the mRNAs were involved in the regulation of classical pathways, including Notch signaling. Differential expression of a lncRNA signature composed of NONHSAT000264, FR075921, FR324124, linc-TRIM58, RP1-93H18.7, RP11-120K9.2, RP11-134F2.2, and NONHSAG024980 was validated by RT-qPCR analysis. CONCLUSION This is the first report of differentially expressed lncRNAs in the P4-treated lung cancer cells.

METHODS This prospective multicentre pilot study was conducted at three sites in Germany. It compared claudicants undergoing predilatation with a bare percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) balloon before DCB (predilatation group) with patients undergoing direct DCB (direct DCB group). Patients were followed for 2 years. Outcomes included late lumen loss at 6 months, and ankle brachial index (ABI), major adverse events, and primary patency at 2 years. A Clinical Events Committee and core laboratories analysed adverse events and angiographic/duplex images, respectively. RESULTS Between December 2011 and November 2012, 50 patients were enrolled to the predilatation group (12% total occlusions) and 28 to the direct DCB group (5% total occlusions). Follow-up compliance at the 2 year visit was 88% (n = 44) and 86% (n = 24), respectively. Late lumen loss at 6 months was lower in the direct DCB group (0.03 ± 0.68 mm vs. 0.54 ± 0.97 mm; p = .01). Major adverse events over 2 years occurred in seven (15%) patients who underwent predilatation and in five (19%) after direct DCB. Mean ABI at 2 years was 0.94 ± 0.15 after predilatation and 1.0 ± 0.12 after direct DCB. Over 2 years, primary patency (80.3% vs. 78.2%; p = .55) was not statistically different between the groups. After propensity score adjustments, 2 year findings remained unchanged. CONCLUSION Paclitaxel coated PTA, with or without bare predilatation, is effective over 2 years in symptomatic patients with femoropopliteal stenotic lesions. Adequately powered randomised controlled comparisons are required to confirm these preliminary results.","Schroeder, H; Meyer, D-R; Lux, B; Ruecker, F; Martorana, M; Miller, L E; Duda, S",European journal of vascular and endovascular surgery : the official journal of the European Society for Vascular Surgery,195,24

Real-time data is noisy and very often hampered by systematic errors in reporting. Detailed epidemic models may contain a large number of empirical parameters, which cannot be determined with sufficient accuracy. In this paper, we show that the cumulative number of deaths can be regarded as a master variable, and the parameters of the epidemic such as the basic reproduction number, the size of the susceptible population, and the infection rate can be determined. In the SIR model, we derive an explicit single variable differential equation for the evolution of the cumulative number of fatalities. We show that the epidemic in Spain, Italy, and Hubei Province, China follows this master equation closely. We discuss the relationship with the logistic growth model, and we show that it is a good approximation when the basic reproduction number is less than $2.3$. This condition is valid for the outbreak in Hubei, but not for the outbreaks in Spain, Italy, and New York. The difference is in the shorter infectious period in China, probably due to the separation policy of the infected. For more complex models, with more internal variables, such as the SEIR model, the equations derived from the SIR model remain valid approximately, due to the separation of timescales.","Vattay, Gabor",Physical biology,195,1

Construct design and acute penetration angle may alter mesh-tissue fixation strength. We compared acute fixation strengths of absorbable fixation devices at various deployment angles, directions of loading, and construct orientations. METHODS Porcine abdominal walls were sectioned. Constructs were deployed at 30°, 45°, 60°, and 90° angles to fix mesh to the tissue specimens. Lap-shear testing was performed in upward, downward, and lateral directions in relation to the abdominal wall cranial-caudal axis to evaluate fixation. Absorbatack™ (AT), SorbaFix™ (SF), and SecureStrap™ in vertical (SSV) and horizontal (SSH) orientations in relation to the abdominal wall cranial-caudal axis were tested. Ten tests were performed for each combination of device, angle, and loading direction. Failure types and strength data were recorded. ANOVA with Tukey-Kramer adjustments for multiple comparisons and χ (2) tests were performed as appropriate (p < 0.05 considered significant). RESULTS At 30°, SSH and SSV had greater fixation strengths (12.95, 12.98 N, respectively) than SF (5.70 N; p = 0.0057, p = 0.0053, respectively). At 45°, mean fixation strength of SSH was significantly greater than SF (18.14, 11.40 N; p = 0.0002). No differences in strength were identified at 60° or 90°. No differences in strength were noted between SSV and SSH with different directions of loading. No differences were noted between SS and AT at any angle. Immediate failure was associated with SF (p < 0.0001) and the 30° tacking angle (p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS Mesh-tissue fixation was stronger at acute deployment angles with SS compared to SF constructs. The 30° angle and the SF device were associated with increased immediate failures. Varying construct and loading direction did not generate statistically significant differences in the fixation strength of absorbable fixation devices in this study.","Zihni, Ahmed M; Cavallo, Jaime A; Thompson, Dominic M; Chowdhury, Nabeel H; Frisella, Margaret M; Matthews, Brent D; Deeken, Corey R",Surgical endoscopy,195,27

Among them, severe oxygen desaturation, usually defined as a drop of pulse oxymetry (SpO2) below 80%, is the most common. Preoxygenation enables delaying oxygen desaturation occurring during apnea induced by anaesthetic drugs. Data suggest that non-invasive ventilation (NIV) or high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) oxygen therapy could further increase PaO2 before intubation procedure and prevent oxygen desaturation episodes as compared with standard oxygen. However, no recommendation favours one technique rather than the other, since they have never been compared. Hence, whether a strategy of preoxygenation with NIV or HFNC is more effective than the other in patients with acute hypoxaemic respiratory failure remains to be established. METHODS AND ANALYSIS The FLORALI-2 study is a multicentre randomised controlled trial comparing a preoxygenation strategy with either NIV or HFNC in patients with acute hypoxaemic respiratory failure needing intubation in ICU. The 320 patients will be randomised with a ratio 1:1 in two groups according to the strategy of preoxygenation. The primary outcome is the occurrence of an episode of severe oxygen desaturation defined by a drop of SpO2 below 80% during the intubation procedure. Secondary outcomes include feasibility of the two strategies, immediate and late complications related to intubation. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION The study has been approved by the central ethics committee (Ethics Committee Ouest-III, Poitiers, France) and patients will be included after informed consent.

They are purported to be observed, however, with increased incidence after Hunterian ligation; particularly in cases of carotid artery occlusion for giant or complex aneurysms deemed unclippable. CASE DESCRIPTION We report a case of right-sided de novo giant A2 aneurysm 6 years after an anterior communicating artery (ACoA) aneurysm clipping. We believe this de novo aneurysm developed in part due to patient-specific risk factors but also a significant change in cerebral hemodynamics. The ACoA became occluded after surgery that likely altered the cerebral hemodynamics and contributed to the de novo aneurysm. We believe this to be the first reported case of a giant de novo aneurysm in this location. Following parent vessel occlusion (mostly of the carotid artery), there are no reports of any de novo aneurysms in the pericallosal arteries let alone a giant one. The patient had a dominant right A1 and the sudden increase in A2 blood flow likely resulted in increased wall shear stress, particularly in the medial wall of the A2 where the aneurysm occurred 2 mm distal to the A1-2 junction. CONCLUSION ACoA preservation is a key element of aneurysm surgery in this location. Suspected occlusion of this vessel may warrant closer radiographic follow-up in patients with other risk factors for aneurysm development.","Ibrahim, Tarik F; Hafez, Ahmad; Andrade-Barazarte, Hugo; Raj, Rahul; Niemela, Mika; Lehto, Hanna; Numminen, Jussi; Jarvelainen, Juha; Hernesniemi, Juha",Surgical neurology international,195,19

We recently demonstrated that innate defense mechanisms of the lung are highly inducible against pneumococcal pneumonia. To determine the breadth of protection conferred by stimulation of lung mucosal innate immunity, and to identify cells and signaling pathways activated by this treatment, mice were treated with an aerosolized bacterial lysate, then challenged with lethal doses of bacterial and fungal pathogens. Mice were highly protected against a broad array of Gram-positive, Gram-negative, and class A bioterror bacterial pathogens, and the fungal pathogen, Aspergillus fumigatus. Protection was associated with rapid pathogen killing within the lungs, and this effect was recapitulated in vitro using a respiratory epithelial cell line. Gene expression analysis of lung tissue showed marked activation of NF-kappaB, type I and II IFN, and antifungal Card9-Bcl10-Malt1 pathways. Cytokines were the most strongly induced genes, but the inflammatory cytokines TNF and IL-6 were not required for protection. Lung-expressed antimicrobial peptides were also highly up-regulated. Taken together, stimulated innate resistance appears to occur through the activation of multiple host defense signaling pathways in lung epithelial cells, inducing rapid pathogen killing, and conferring broad protection against virulent bacterial and fungal pathogens. Augmentation of innate antimicrobial defenses of the lungs might have therapeutic value for protection of patients with neutropenia or impaired adaptive immunity against opportunistic pneumonia, and for defense of immunocompetent subjects against a bioterror threat or epidemic respiratory infection.","Evans, Scott E; Scott, Brenton L; Clement, Cecilia G; Larson, Derek T; Kontoyiannis, Dimitrios; Lewis, Russell E; Lasala, P Rocco; Pawlik, Jennifer; Peterson, Johnny W; Chopra, Ashok K; Klimpel, Gary; Bowden, Gabriela; Höök, Magnus; Xu, Yi; Tuvim, Michael J; Dickey, Burton F",American journal of respiratory cell and molecular biology,195,31

We undertook a review of published literature comparing health facility-based care (HFBC) with non-health facility based care (nHFBC) models of ART delivery in terms of health outcomes; viral suppression, loss to follow-up, retention and mortality. METHODS We conducted a systematic search of Medline, Embase and Global Health databases from 2010 onwards. UNAIDS reports, WHO guidelines and abstracts from conferences were reviewed. All studies measuring at least one of the following outcomes, viral load suppression, loss-to-follow-up (LTFU) and mortality were included. Data were extracted, and a descriptive analysis was performed. Risk of bias assessment was done for all studies. Pooled estimates of the risk difference (for viral suppression) and hazard ratio (for mortality) were made using random-effects meta-analysis. RESULTS Of 3082 non-duplicate records, 193 were eligible for full text screening of which 21 published papers met the criteria for inclusion. The pooled risk difference of viral load suppression amongst 4 RCTs showed no evidence of a difference in viral suppression (VS) between nHFBC and HFBC with an overall estimated risk difference of 1% [95% CI -1, 4%]. The pooled hazard ratio of mortality amongst 2 RCTs and 4 observational cohort studies showed no evidence of a difference in mortality between nHFBC and HFBC with an overall estimated hazard ratio of 1.01 [95% CI 0.88, 1.16]. Fifteen studies contained data on LTFU and 13 studies on retention. Although no formal quantitative analysis was performed on these outcomes due to the very different definitions between papers, it was observed that the outcomes appeared similar between HFBC and nHFBC. CONCLUSIONS Review of current literature demonstrates comparable outcomes for nHFBC compared to HFBC ART delivery programmes in terms of viral suppression, retention and mortality.

METHODS A retrospective review was performed of patients presenting to the emergency room from December 2017 to February 2019 who underwent upper urinary tract decompression due to concern for infection in the setting of obstructing urolithiasis. Over 30 clinical parameters were assessed and a composite risk score was created. Univariate and multivariate forward stepwise regression were performed to identify predictors of true UTI. RESULTS 98 patients met inclusion criteria, of which a true UTI was identified in 50 (51%). The standard model of serum WBC>15 or temperature>38°C had an AUC of only 0.67 to predict UTI. A multivariable regression-based 4-point risk score (1-point for each of the following: positive urinary gram stain, perinephric fat stranding on CT, serum C-reactive protein >21.95, and serum procalcitonin >0.36) had an AUC of 0.91 to predict UTI. Individually, these components had AUC of 0.68, 0.68, 0.80, and 0.77, respectively. The chances of confirmed UTI were 8%, 11%, 68%, and 100% for risk scores of 0, 1, 2, and 3-4 respectively (p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS Only 50% of patients with a suspected UTI and an obstructing stone were ultimately confirmed to have a UTI. A risk score consisting of gram stain, perinephric fat stranding, CRP, and PCT can improve UTI prediction and warrants further study.","Wymer, Kevin M; Sharma, Vidit; Manka, Madeleine; Agarwal, Deepak K; Dodge, Nicole; Gettman, Matthew; Rivera, Marcelino E",Journal of endourology,195,24

Despite their importance, molecular switches, which define growth transitions, are largely unknown. Apical hook development in dark grown Arabidopsis thaliana (A. thaliana) seedlings serves as a suitable model for differential growth transition in plants. Here, we show that the phytohormone auxin counteracts the light-induced growth transition during apical hook opening. We, subsequently, identified genes which are inversely regulated by light and auxin. We used in silico analysis of the regulatory elements in this set of genes and subsequently used natural variation in gene expression to uncover correlations between underlying transcription factors and the in silico predicted target genes. This approach uncovered that MADS box transcription factor AGAMOUS-LIKE 8 (AGL8)/FRUITFULL (FUL) modulates apical hook opening. Our data shows that transient FUL expression represses the expression of growth stimulating genes during early phases of apical hook development and therewith guards the transition to growth promotion for apical hook opening. Here, we propose a role for FUL in setting tissue identity, thereby regulating differential growth during apical hook development.","Führer, Miriam; Gaidora, Angelika; Venhuizen, Peter; Dobrogojski, Jedrzej; Béziat, Chloé; Feraru, Mugurel I; Kleine-Vehn, Jürgen; Kalyna, Maria; Barbez, Elke",International journal of molecular sciences,195,1

Although end-of-life and palliative care are considered essential components of disaster planning and response, there are gaps in understandings about their real-life application, and how natural disasters impact end-of-life care. OBJECTIVE To synthesise existing evidence of the impacts of natural disasters (eg, bushfires, communicable pandemics, etc) on end-of-life care. METHODS A systematic review with a narrative synthesis was undertaken. The review was registered on PROSPERO (registration: CRD42020176319). PubMed, Scopus, PsycINFO, Science Direct and Web of Science were searched for studies published in English between 2003 and 2020, with findings explicitly mentioning end-of-life care impacts in relation to a natural disaster. Articles were appraised for quality using a JBI-QARI tool. RESULTS Thirty-six empirical studies met the inclusion criteria and quality assessment. Findings were synthesised into three key themes: impacts on service provision, impacts on service providers and impacts on service users. This review demonstrates that natural disasters impact profoundly on end-of-life care, representing a stark departure from a palliative care approach. CONCLUSIONS Clinical practitioners, policy makers and researchers must continue to collaborate for viable solutions to achieve universal access to compassionate and respectful end-of-life care, during natural disasters. Using models, policies and practices already developed in palliative care, involving those most impacted in disaster planning and anticipating barriers, such as resource shortages, enables development of end-of-life care policies and practices that can be rapidly implemented during natural disasters.","Kelly, Marguerite; Mitchell, Imogen; Walker, Iain; Mears, Jane; Scholz, Brett",BMJ supportive & palliative care,195,1

METHODS From January 2008 to December 2013 patients treated with posterior ICBG and a minimum follow-up of 5 years were included. Clinical outcome of patients operated with a posterior ICBG was analyzed with multiple patient-reported outcome measures included Constant (CS), American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES), Walch-Duplay, and Rowe score, shoulder subjective value (SSV) and pain visual analog score (VAS). Patient satisfaction was assessed by asking the patients their overall level of satisfaction at last follow-up on a 1 to 10 scale. RESULTS 18 patients (19 shoulders) were included. At a mean follow-up of 7.3 years (range, 5 to 10), patients had significant improvements in their mean CS from 63 (SD 18) to 80 (SD 18; p = 0.005), ASES from 57 (SD 18) to 81 (SD 18; p = 0.003), Walch-Duplay from 34 (SD 31) to 79 (SD 22; p < 0.001) and Rowe score from 37 (SD 23) to 79 (SD 24; p < 0.001). Pain level decreased from 5.6 (SD 2.5) preoperative to 2.3 (SD 2.3; p < 0.001) and SSV improved 58 (SD 20) to 76 (SD 24; p = 0.002). Global satisfaction with the procedure was 8.4 (SD 2.1). Clinical significance was met or exceeded by 84% for CS and 89% of the patients for ASES and 95% met or exceeded satisfaction threshold for CS. There were 7 shoulders (37%) re-operated for symptomatic screw irritation. CONCLUSION This series reporting on the long-term follow-up after arthroscopic posterior ICBG for recurrent posterior shoulder instability demonstrates despite a high number of reoperation for symptomatic screw irritation its effectiveness with acceptable clinical outcomes and satisfied patients.

OBJECTIVE To evaluate our experience with these patients by comparing best medical therapy with thrombectomy in an intention-to-treat analysis. METHODS Analysis of prospectively collected data of all consecutive patients with National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score ≤5, LVO on CT angiography, and baseline modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score 0-2 from November 2014 to May 2016. After careful discussion with patients/family, a decision to pursue medical or interventional therapy was made. Deterioration (development of aphasia, neglect, and/or significant weakness) triggered reconsideration of thrombectomy. The primary outcome measure was NIHSS shift (discharge NIHSS score minus admission NIHSS score). RESULTS Of the 32 patients qualifying for the study, 22 (69%) were primarily treated with medical therapy and 10 (31%) intervention. Baseline characteristics were comparable. Nine (41%) medically treated patients had subsequent deterioration requiring thrombectomy. Median time from arrival to deterioration was 5.2 hours (2.0-25.0). Successful reperfusion (modified Treatment in Cerebral Infarction 2b-3) was achieved in all 19 thrombectomy patients. The NIHSS shift significantly favored thrombectomy (-2.5 vs 0; p<0.01). The median NIHSS score at discharge was low with both thrombectomy (1 (0-3)) and medical therapy (2 (0.5-4.5)). 90-Day mRS 0-2 rates were 100% and 77%, respectively (p=0.15). Multivariable linear regression indicated that thrombectomy was independently associated with a beneficial NIHSS shift (unstandardized β -4.2 (95% CI -8.2 to -0.1); p=0.04). CONCLUSIONS Thrombectomy led to a shift towards a lower NIHSS in patients with LVO presenting with minimal stroke symptoms. Despite the overall perception that this condition is benign, nearly a quarter of patients primarily treated with medical therapy did not achieve independence at 90 days.","Haussen, Diogo C; Bouslama, Mehdi; Grossberg, Jonathan A; Anderson, Aaron; Belagage, Samir; Frankel, Michael; Bianchi, Nicolas; Rebello, Leticia C; Nogueira, Raul G",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,195,8

Eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) is a psychological method to alleviate the distress from unpleasant memories and related events and can be used for other conditions such as anxiety, depression, and chronic pain. This protocol was designed to investigate the effect of EMDR therapy on pain intensity in patients with dysmenorrhea. METHODS/DESIGN A randomized clinical trial was designed in compliance with the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT). Female students who have moderate to severe primary dysmenorrhea (based on a visual analogue scale [VAS] score of at least 4 for two consecutive months) and who live in dormitories at Qazvin University of Medical Sciences in Qazvin, Iran will be invited to participate in the study. The total sample size will be 88 girls, who will be randomly assigned to intervention (N = 44) and control (N = 44) groups. EMDR therapy will be performed for the intervention group, while the control group can use sedative or other pain relife methods as their routin... There will be six treatment sessions, which will be held twice a week. The duration of each session is 30-90 min, according to the convenience of each participant. The data will be collected using the demographic characteristics questionnaire, the VAS, the Subjective Units of Anxiety or Distress Scale (SUD), and the Validity of Cognition Scale (VOC). The data on pain intensity due to primary dysmenorrhea in both groups will be collected at 1 and 2 months before the intervention (to identify eligible participants) and 1 and 2 months after the intervention (follow-ups). Data will be analyzed by using SPSS version 25 software and analysis of variance (ANOVA) with repeated measures with appropriate post hoc tests. A P value of less than 0.05 will be considered significant.

We investigated the distribution of these effects across the connectome and their relationship with age-related differences in dopamine (DA) D1 receptor availability and gray matter density (GMD). With this aim, we determined aging effects on mean and interindividual variance of FC using fMRI in 30 younger and 30 older healthy subjects and mapped the contribution of each connection to the patterns of age-related similarity loss. Aging effects on mean FC accounted mainly for the dissimilarity between connectomes of younger and older adults, and were related, across brain regions, to aging effects on DA D1 receptor availability. Aging effects on the variance of FC indicated a global increase in variance with advancing age, explained connectome dissimilarity among older subjects and were related to aging effects on variance of GMD. The relationship between aging and the similarity of connectomes can thus be partly explained by age differences in DA modulation and gray matter structure.","Garzón, Benjamín; Lövdén, Martin; de Boer, Lieke; Axelsson, Jan; Riklund, Katrine; Bäckman, Lars; Nyberg, Lars; Guitart-Masip, Marc",Brain structure & function,195,27

Integrins are heterodimeric transmembrane proteins that link the extracellular matrix (ECM) to the cytoskeleton and control intracellular signaling events. A great deal is known about the structural and functional properties for most integrins; however, the adhesion and signaling pathways controlled by αvβ8 integrin, which was discovered nearly 30 years ago, have only recently been characterized. αvβ8 integrin is a receptor for ECM-bound forms of latent transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) proteins and promotes the activation of TGFβ signaling pathways. Studies of the brain, lung and immune system reveal that the αvβ8 integrin-TGFβ axis mediates cell-cell contact and communication within complex multicellular structures. Perturbing components of this axis results in aberrant cell-cell adhesion and signaling leading to the initiation of various pathologies, including neurodegeneration, fibrosis and cancer. As discussed in this Review, understanding the functions for αvβ8 integrin, its ECM ligands and intracellular effector proteins is not only an important topic in cell biology, but may lead to new therapeutic strategies to treat human pathologies related to integrin dysfunction.","McCarty, Joseph H",Journal of cell science,195,24

Although various cultural isolation methods have been proposed, the current procedures are unable to fully suppress growth of background microbiota present in food samples which inhibits Arcobacter isolation. The purpose of this study was to develop a selective enrichment broth and chromogenic plating medium to detect three Arcobacter species that have been recognized as emerging foodborne pathogens: Arcobacter butzleri , Arcobacter cryaerophilus and Arcobacter skirrowii . The developed Nguyen-Restaino-Juárez Arcobacter detection system consists of a selective enrichment broth (NRJ-B) and a selective/differential plating media (NRJ-M). The protocol of the detection method was determined by evaluating growth of A. butzleri , A. cryaerophilus and A. skirrowii under various temperature (30, 35 and 42ᴼC) and incubation (aerobic, microaerophilic and anaerobic) conditions. Additionally, 47 Arcobacter strains and 39 non- Arcobacter strains were tested in the inclusivity and exclusivity evaluations of NRJ-B and NRJ-M. Overall, the study determined the optimal growth conditions of Arcobacter species using the NRJ- Arcobacter detection system was aerobic incubation at 30ᴼC. NRJ-B supported good growth of A. butzleri , A. cryaerophilus , and A. skirrowii while effectively suppressing growth of non- Arcobacter strains after 48 h. Furthermore, NRJ-M yielded 97.8% inclusivity and 100.0% exclusivity using the tested strains and resulted in salmon-pigmented Arcobacter colonies (1.0 to 1.5 mm in diameter) after 72 h. The novel protocol is the first to develop a chromogenic plating media for the isolation of Arcobacter species. This simple and reliable test method would greatly contribute to understanding the distribution of pathogenic Arcobacter species in food samples.","Nguyen, Paul; Juárez, Oscar; Restaino, Lawrence",Journal of food protection,195,31

Since there is clear mortality benefit to receiving a transplant regardless of comorbidities and age, the gold standard of care should focus on attaining kidney transplantation and minimizing, or better yet eliminating, time on dialysis. Unfortunately, only a small percentage of patients with ESKD receive a kidney transplant. Several barriers to kidney transplantation have been identified. Barriers can largely be grouped into three categories: patient-related, physician/provider-related, and system-related. Several barriers fall into multiple categories and play a role at various levels within the healthcare system. Acknowledging and understanding these barriers will allow transplant centers and dialysis facilities to make the necessary interventions to mitigate these disparities, optimize the transplant evaluation process, and improve patient outcomes.

The objective of this study was to identify specific serum miRNAs as potential biomarkers for screening lung adenocarcinoma. The study was divided into a screening phase, training phase, and validation phase. The expression of 46 serum miRNAs from lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) patients and healthy controls (HCs) were examined in the screening phase. The expression of the most dysregulated miRNAs was further verified in training (30 LUAD vs. 30 HCs) and validation (82 LUAD vs. 90 HCs) phases. Seven serum miRNAs (miR-142-5p, miR-203a-5p, miR-409-3p, miR-223-3p, miR-150-5p, miR-486-5p and miR-146a-5p) in LUAD patients were significantly dysregulated compared to those in HCs. Their ability to diagnose lung cancer was also significant, with miR-142-5p (AUC = 0.743), miR-409-3p (AUC = 0.755), miR-223-3p (AUC = 0.828) and miR-146a-5p (AUC = 0.745) being more prominent. The combined use of these four could enhance diagnostic value (AUC = 0.933). Our findings define a distinct miRNA expression profile in the serum of LUAD patients. The four-miRNA panel (miR-142-5p, miR-409-3p, miR-223-3p and 146a-5p) may be considered as a novel, non-invasive biomarker for LUAD early detection.","Wang, Jingyao; Zhang, Chunduo; Peng, Xiqi; Liu, Kaihao; Zhao, Liwen; Chen, Xuan; Yu, Hongjian; Lai, Yongqing",Human cell,195,1

METHODS Sixty-five patients (36 women; mean age, 51.3 +/- 15.6; range, 13 to 76 years) underwent a needlescopic procedure to obtain lung biopsy specimens. Forty had indeterminate pulmonary nodules, and 25 had interstitial lung disease. A 2-mm needlescope and a 2-mm MiniSite Endo Grasp (Covidien, Norwalk, CT) were inserted at the sixth intercostal space along the middle and the posterior axillary line, respectively. Biopsy specimens were obtained using endostaplers. RESULTS The average number of biopsy specimens was 1.7 +/- 0.6 (range, 1 to 4). For 9 patients, a frozen specimen was sent twice to pathology. Complete resection was continued after intraoperative pathology confirmation in 13 patients (lobectomy, 7; segmentectomy, 3; mass removal, 1; metastasectomy, 2). The volume of lung tissue was 8.7 +/- 11.8 cm3 (range, 0.15 to 55.44 cm3). The operation time was 58.7 +/- 37.5 minutes (range, 15 to 160 minutes). The final pathologic results were confirmed in all patients. No thoracoscopic procedure was converted to an open thoracotomy. Three patients (4.3%) had prolonged air leakage (> 5 days), and the chest tube remained in the pleural space for 2.3 +/- 2.4 days (range, 1 to 8 days).

A pleasure of being an editor of this journal is the sheer breadth and diversity of papers that we receive. The best papers not only share the achievements and successes of new research and innovation but also shed light on the complex struggles and challenges involved in helping children and young people overcome the emotional, behavioural and other mental health difficulties they endure. Child and Adolescent Mental Health aims to publish high quality health services research that informs, influences and transforms the quality and effectiveness of the mental health care available to children, young people, their parents and families. When placed in the global context outlined by Patel and Rahman (2015) in this issue, the scale of this task is daunting. Nearly half of the world's population are under the age of 18 and only a small fraction of the global mental health resources currently available are invested in child and adolescent mental health care across low, medium and high income countries. Patel and Rahman (2015) argue that the step change needed to transform global child mental health requires a bold agenda that mobilises community assets, such as lay health workers, harnesses the use of mobile and electronic health technologies alongside more conventional improvement in access and effectiveness of both universal and specialist services from early life onwards. This agenda resonates for children and young people in high income countries as much as it does for those living in low and middle income countries. Child and Adolescent Mental Health needs to reflect the global challenge of children and young people's mental health.

METHODS This is a cross-sectional study conducted with a sample of 372 children in August 2015. Socioeconomic, demographic, maternal and child information were collected. The anthropometry followed the one proposed by the World Health Organization. Height-for-age and weight-for-height rates were calculated using Anthro software version 3.2.2. Poisson regression was performed with a robust variance for the association of malnutrition with the studied variables, using Stata software version 14.0. RESULTS Child malnutrition was high for height-for-age (15.1%) and weight-for-height (7%). Children whose mothers had a short height (< 1.497 m) were more likely to have height-for-age deficits (p < 0.05). No variables were statistically associated with low weight-for-height. CONCLUSION Child malnutrition persists as a public health problem in vulnerable regions, and maternal factors such as low maternal height may explain the short stature of the children.

The current study aims to evaluate the prognostic impact of TDLN metastasis in esophageal cancer patients subdivided by its location and comparing the patients' survival with those with extra-regional LN metastasis. Methods Patients who underwent TTE with TD resection for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) were reviewed. Patients were classified into those with or without TDLN metastasis, and clinicopathological factors were compared between groups. TDLN was further divided into TDLN-Ut/Mt/Lt based on the location in the mediastinum. The relapse-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) were compared between groups. Results Of 232 patients, TDLN metastasis was observed in 17 (7%). RFS and OS were significantly worse in the TDLN metastasis group. TDLN metastasis was shown to be an independent prognostic factor for RFS and OS in the multivariate analysis. The negative prognostic impact of TDLN metastasis was evident in TDLN-Mt/Lt. The RFS and OS of patients with TDLN metastasis were almost identical to those with positive LN metastasis in extra-regional LNs. Conclusion TDLN metastasis was proven to be a strong prognostic indicator. Although the TDLN has been included in the classification of regional LN in the current staging systems, it could be independently classified from the current regional LNs. Given that neoadjuvant therapy has been a standard, we might need to introduce adjuvant therapy when TDLN metastasis is observed.","Matsuda, Satoru; Kawakubo, Hirofumi; Takeuchi, Hiroya; Mayanagi, Shuhei; Irino, Tomoyuki; Fukuda, Kazumasa; Nakamura, Rieko; Wada, Norihito; Kitagawa, Yuko",Annals of gastroenterological surgery,195,1

As revealed in crystal structures, most of these residues (e.g., 452 and 484 in RBDs) are not in direct contact with interfacial residues in the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). This suggests that albeit there are some possibly nonlocal effects, these mutations might not significantly affect RBD's binding with ACE2, which is an important step for viral entry into host cells. Thus, without knowing the molecular mechanism, these successful mutations (from the point of view of SARS-CoV-2) may be hypothesized to evade human antibodies. Using all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulation, here, we show that the E484Q/L452R mutations significantly reduce the binding affinity between the RBD of the Kappa variant and the antibody LY-CoV555 (also named as Bamlanivimab), which was efficacious for neutralizing the wild-type SARS-CoV-2. To verify simulation results, we further carried out experiments with both pseudovirions- and live virus-based neutralization assays and demonstrated that LY-CoV555 completely lost neutralizing activity against the L452R/E484Q mutant. Similarly, we show that mutations in the Delta and Lambda variants can also destabilize the RBD's binding with LY-CoV555. With the revealed molecular mechanism on how these variants evade LY-CoV555, we expect that more specific therapeutic antibodies can be accordingly designed and/or a precise mixing of antibodies can be achieved as a cocktail treatment for patients infected with these variants.","Liu, Shufeng; Huynh, Tien; Stauft, Charles B; Wang, Tony T; Luan, Binquan",Journal of chemical information and modeling,195,1

Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels of subjects with severe COVID-19 pneumonia were measured at hospital admission, between March 17th, 2020, and March 1st, 2021. Results . Out of 2,908 patients, 571 (19.6%) had vitamin D deficiency (defined as a serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level <12.5 ng/mL [<31.25 nmol/L]), and 1069 (36.7%) had levels between 12.5 ng/mL (31.25 nmol/L) and 20 ng/mL 850 nmol/L). Compared to subjects without vitamin D deficiency, those with 25-hydroxyvitamin D level <12.5 ng/mL had higher rates of in-hospital mortality at 30 d (28.0 vs. 17.3%; p <0.001), global mortality (31.9 vs. 20.8%; p <0.001), mechanical ventilation requirement (23.8 vs. 17.2%; p <0.001), and significantly longer hospital stay (median [interquartile range] of 9 [6–17 d] vs. 7 [5–12 d], p <0.001). In the unadjusted analysis, the risk of in-hospital death was greater for patients with vitamin D deficiency (HR 1.43; 95% CI, 1.20–1.70; p <0.001). After adjusting for confounders, the risk of in-hospital death within 30 d remained significantly greater in patients with vitamin D deficiency (HR 1.46; 95% CI, 1.21–1.76; p <0.001).

With an increase in more wired and wireless connections and devices on SME networks, unpredictable malicious activities and interruptions have risen. Finding the harmony between the advancement of technology and costs has always been a balancing act particularly in convincing the finance directors of these SMEs to invest in capital towards their IT infrastructure. This paper looks at various devices that currently are in the market to detect intrusions and look at how these devices handle prevention strategies for SMEs in their working environment both at home and in the office, in terms of their credibility in handling zero-day attacks against the costs of achieving so. The experiment was set up during the 2020 pandemic referred to as COVID-19 when the world experienced an unprecedented event of large scale. The operational working environment of SMEs reflected the context when the UK went into lockdown. Pre-pandemic would have seen this experiment take full control within an operational office environment;however, COVID-19 times has pushed us into a corner to evaluate every aspect of cybersecurity from the office and keeping the data safe within the home environment. The devices chosen for this experiment were OpenSource such as SNORT and pfSense to detect activities within the home environment, and Cisco, a commercial device, set up within an SME network. All three devices operated in a live environment within the SME network structure with employees being both at home and in the office. All three devices were observed from the rules they displayed, their costs and machine learning techniques integrated within them. The results revealed these aspects to be important in how they identified zero-day attacks. The findings showed that OpenSource devices whilst free to download, required a high level of expertise in personnel to implement and embed machine learning rules into the business solution even for staff working from home. However, when using Cisco, the price reflected the buy-in into this expertise and Cisco’s mainframe network, to give up-to-date information on cyber-attacks. The requirements of the UK General Data Protection Regulations Act (GDPR) were also acknowledged as part of the broader framework of the study. Machine learning techniques such as anomaly-based intrusions did show better detection through a commercially subscription-based model for support from Cisco compared to that of the OpenSource model which required internal expertise in machine learning. A cost model was used to compare the outcome of SMEs’ decision making, in getting the right framework in place in securing their data. In conclusion, finding a balance between IT expertise and costs of products that are able to help SMEs protect and secure their data will benefit the SMEs from using a more intelligent controlled environment with applied machine learning techniques, and not compromising on costs. © 2021 by the authors.","Rawindaran, N.; Jayal, A.; Prakash, E.; Hewage, C.",Future Internet,195,1

A recent structural analysis reported the presence of two hotspots in hACE2 where the receptor-binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2 virus attached, namely hotspot-31 and hotspot-353. Our work studied the molecular interaction of diterpenoid lactones of Andrographis paniculata and the hydroxybenzylidene derivates of andrographolide with these hotspots in the peptidase domain of hACE2. The X-ray crystal structure of hACE2 was downloaded from RCSB Protein Data Bank (https://www.rcsb.org/). The ligands were built using MarvinSketch of ChemAxon and were subjected to energy minimization using the MMFF94 forcefield partial charges in the LigandScout software. The energy-minimized ligands were docked to both hotspots of hACE2. The results indicated that of all test ligands, only andrographolide could occupy hotspot-353 by building hydrogen bonds with Lys353, Glu37, and Asp38, and possesses the best docking score (-6.20 kcal/mol). Thus, andrographolide might be able to prevent the fusion of SARS-CoV-2 to hACE2 by occupying the site where the viruses attach to.","Megantara, S.; Levita, J.; Ibrahim, S.; Nguyen, B.

Secondly, it examines what effect the growth in homeworking during the pandemic has had on employees' self-reported levels of productivity. Thirdly, it assesses whether the spike in homeworking is a flash in the pan or a permanent feature of the post-pandemic world. Design/methodology/approach: The paper uses cross-sectional and longitudinal data taken from three nationally representative surveys of workers: (1) the Labour Force Survey (LFS), an official government survey carried out between 1981 and 2019;(2) a special module of the Opinions and Lifestyle Survey (OPN), also an official government survey, which has been run every week since the pandemic began in March 2020;and (3) the Understanding Society Covid-19 Study, an online survey of the same people interviewed on six occasions during 2020. Findings: The recent surge in homeworking in the UK during the pandemic has been dramatic. Before 2020, it had taken almost 40 years for homeworking to grow by three percentage points, but its prevalence grew eight-fold virtually overnight as people were instructed to work at home if they can because of the pandemic. Despite theories and predictions to the contrary, employees reported that their productivity was not adversely affected. Seven out of ten employees said that they were able to get as much done while working at home in June 2020 as they were able to do six months earlier. By September 2020, this proportion had risen to 85%. However, around one in six homeworkers reported that their productivity had fallen. Research limitations/implications: While there are solid theoretical reasons for the paper's findings, these data do not allow us to test all of the mechanisms involved. In addition, our outcome measure relies on employees' self-reports of how their hourly productivity changed when working at home and is not based on a direct measure of changes to output per hour. However, surveys of employers also suggest that, on average, productivity has not been reduced by the pandemic-induced surge in homeworking. Social implications: This paper argues that a higher level of homeworking is here to stay. Nine out of ten employees who worked at home during the pandemic said that they would like to continue working at home when they did not have to. Furthermore, those keenest to continue working at home were the most productive, hence providing a business case for a sustained increase in the prevalence of homeworking after the pandemic has passed. Nevertheless, the experience of homeworking varies with those with higher domestic commitments reporting significantly lower levels of productivity. Originality/value: There is an urgent need to investigate what effect enforced, as opposed to voluntary, homeworking has had on employee productivity. In addition, in order to decide whether continued homeworking should be encouraged or discouraged, policymakers and employers need to know what effect continuing with these arrangements is likely to have on employee productivity. This paper answers these questions using robust survey data collected in the UK throughout 2020, complemented by evidence taken from a variety of employer surveys. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Felstead, A.; Reuschke, D.",Information Technology and People,195,16

Transmission risks and patient fears of visiting oncology practices during its onset resulted in rapid adoption of telehealth services. We hypothesized that the pandemic would widen disparities in oncology practice visits between Medicaid and commercially insured patients, resulting higher rates of emergency department (ED) visits during initial treatment. Methods: Linking Washington State SEER records with Medicaid and commercial insurance enrollment and claims records, we compared adults age <65 with new solid tumor malignancies who received systemic treatment at academic and community oncology practices. Persons starting therapy March - June 2020 (COVID) were compared with those starting therapy March-June 2017-2019 (Pre-COVID). Poisson regressions were used to evaluate differences in oncology practice office visits and telehealth visits. Logistic regressions were used to evaluate the likelihood of at least one ED admission among patients starting systemic therapy pre- and post-COVID. Results: Among patients who met inclusion criteria (652 Commercial, 349 Medicaid), Medicaid enrollees had more advanced disease and more comorbidity versus commercial enrollees. In unadjusted analysis of E&M and telehealth service visit codes, office-based visits fell for both insurance groups (Table) while telehealth service visits (negligible pre-COVID) were higher for commercial versus Medicaid enrollees postCOVID. The proportion of persons with ≥ 1 ED visit during therapy fell for both insurance groups. In Poisson models, Medicaid enrollees had significantly fewer total visits (P=0.001) and fewer telehealth visits (p<0.001) compared commercial enrollees during the COVID period. In the logit models, ED visits trended lower for both groups after COVID (OR 0.53 95% CI 0.279 to 1.008). Among Medicaid enrollees, persons ages 40-49 and breast cancer patients were more likely to visit the ED. Among the commercially insured, persons with 2 or more comorbidities were more likely to visit the ED. The pre-post COVID change in likelihood of an ED visit was not significantly different between insurance groups (p=0.355). Conclusions: In Washington State, the COVID-19 pandemic created a substantial disparity in access to office-based and telehealth care for low-income patients receiving systemic therapy for new cancers. Reduced oncology practice visits among Medicaid patients did not widen existing disparities in utilization of emergency care.","Ramsey, S. D.; Panattoni, L. E.; Li, L.; Sun, Q.; Fedorenko, C.

We estimated additional CHWs needed to maximize geographical accessibility of the population beyond the reach of existing front-line health facilities and CHWs. We assessed the efficiency of geographical targeting of the existing CHW network compared to modelled CHW networks designed to optimize geographical targeting of the estimated population, under-five deaths, and plasmodium falciparum malaria cases. Results The percent of the population within 60 minutes walking to the nearest CHW increased from 0{middle dot}0% to 17{middle dot}5% between 2000-2013, with 15{middle dot}5% within 60 minutes walking to the nearest CHW trained on integrated community case management (iCCM) -- making PHC services and iCCM, specifically, geographically accessible for an estimated 2{middle dot}3 million and 2{middle dot}0 million additional people, respectively.

Methods: We collected nasal swabs from the patients and their accompanying persons. We also recorded the levels (None, Mild, High, and Severe) of their symptoms (Fever, Chill, Muscle Pain, Watery Eye, Runny Nose, Sneezing, Sore throat and Cough). The collected swabs were tested for the presence of common viruses infecting the respiratory tract. Results: Human Rhinovirus was the most common virus among the patients, followed Influenza and Respiratory Syncytial Virus. Human Rhinovirus was most common in summer, autumn and spring. In contrast, influenza was more common in winter. Further, Influenza A virus was more likely to co-occur with Corona Virus 229E. In comparison, Influenza was less likely to co-occur with Human Rhinovirus. Moreover, Influenza, Parainfluenza and Corona virus were associated with more severe symptoms, while Human Rhinovirus was associated with less severe symptoms. In addition, we observed that Influenza and Respiratory Syncytial Virus were more likely to infect a patient when these viruses also infected the accompanying person. We also found that it was difficult to distinguish among viruses based on the symptoms. The inability to distinguish among different virus types and subtypes is explained by the fact that multiple viruses lead to similar symptoms.

Using primers with a degenerated 3' end, the isolated nucleic acids are amplified and the randomly amplified PCR products are cloned and sequenced. As proof of the concept, the PAN-PCR approach was applied to supernatants of coxsackievirus B3 and murine adenovirus type 1-infected cells. Enterovirus and adenovirus sequences were obtained, demonstrating that the random PCR approach allows detection of RNA and DNA viruses. As a first application of this PAN-PCR approach, we characterized a virus isolate from mouth-washing material of a patient with chronic fatigue syndrome and high antibody titers to coxsackievirus B2. The virus isolate had tested negative for enteroviruses and respiratory viruses (influenza viruses A and B, parainfluenza virus types 1 to 3, respiratory syncytial virus, and adenovirus) by immunofluorescence and PCR. Particle-associated, nuclease-resistant RNA and DNA were prepared from the supernatant of infected cells. The DNA and the reverse-transcribed RNA were randomly amplified, and PCR products were cloned and sequenced. Of 25 sequences obtained from the DNA preparation, 24 contained herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) sequences from 14 different loci spread over the HSV-1 genome. This result was confirmed by using a standard diagnostic HSV-PCR, demonstrating that the PAN-PCR correctly identified the virus isolate. Although the identification of HSV-1 in mouth-washing material is not surprising in retrospect, it clearly demonstrates the applicability of the PAN-PCR approach. This method should be particularly useful for characterizing virus isolates that have tested negative for all expected viruses and for identifying unknown viruses.","Stang, Alexander; Korn, Klaus; Wildner, Oliver; Uberla, Klaus",Journal of clinical microbiology,195,1

Patients with an aggressive course are the bottleneck of COVID-19 pandemic management, and there is urgent need of understanding the underlying mechanisms to guide clinical decisions. Myeloid cell activation is likely a key player in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods: Here, we longitudinally evaluated COVID-19 patients with respiratory insufficiency admitted to Hospital Santa Maria (Lisbon, Portugal), comparing those that did not require intensive care admission (NO-ICU) with those requiring high flux oxygen and/or mechanical ventilation (ICU). At each time point, an ex-vivo immune-phenotype by flow cytometry was analysed with both supervised and unsupervised approaches and clustering analysis of circulating cell subsets of monocytes (Mo) and dendritic cells (DCs), in parallel with specific antibody responses and a wide array of inflammatory mediators. Results: Contrarily to other systemic viral infections, we found that COVID-19 patients with respiratory insufficiency featured systemic immune-suppressive/ regulatory myeloid cell responses. Specifically, we observed a global reduction of CD14lowCD16+ Mo, and reduced expression of CD80, CD86, and SLAN. Contemporaneously, both Mo and DC showed increased expression of CD163, CD204, CD206 and PD-L1 immune-regulatory markers. Moreover, cDC2s, pDCs and basophils were significantly reduced. Inflammatory cytokines and chemokines associated with myeloid cell chemotaxis correlated with the phenotype changes. In NO-ICU patients (n=9) we observed a peak of these alterations at admission and a progressive regression to healthy phenotype at hospital discharge (as compared to age-matched controls, n=11). On the other hand, in ICU patients (n=11), the expression of immuno-suppressive markers progressively increased until discharge. Notably, they featured significant reduction of HLA-DRhighPD-L1- and expansion of CD80-CD86- classical Mo and an increase of HLA-DRhighPD-L1+ cells in Mo and in all DC subsets at recovery. Conclusion: Altogether, these data favour an alternative view of a beneficial role of suppressive/regulatory myeloid responses in coping with COVID-19 pathogenesis. To further support our hypothesis, we are currently collecting data on lung injury and SARS-CoV-2 viremia to correlate with the kinetics of myeloid responses.","Trombetta, A. C.; Farias, G.

Objective: To determine if chilblains are associated with COVID-19. Design, Setting, and Participants: This monocentric case series was conducted at the Department of Dermatology at Cliniques universitaires Saint-Luc, a tertiary care hospital in Brussels, Belgium, between April 10 and April 17, 2020. We evaluated a total of 31 referred patients who had recently developed chilblains. Main Outcomes and Measures: Real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to detect severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA on nasopharyngeal swabs for all patients and in skin biopsy specimens for 22 patients. Blood samples from all patients were tested for specific anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin (Ig) M and IgG antibodies. All patients had extended blood analyses. Histologic (22 patients) and immunofluorescence examinations (15 patients) were performed on the skin biopsy specimens. Results: The 31 patients were generally in good health; most were teenagers or young adults, and 19 were women. Histopathologic analysis of skin biopsy specimens (22 patients) confirmed the diagnosis of chilblains and showed occasional lymphocytic or microthrombotic phenomena. Immunofluorescence analyses showed vasculitis of small-diameter vessels in 7 patients. In all patients, SARS-CoV-2 RNA remained undetected by RT-PCR on nasopharyngeal swabs and in biopsy samples of the skin lesions. The IgM and IgG antibody titers were negative for SARS-CoV-2 in all patients (<1.0 arbitrary unit/mL). No significant abnormalities in blood test results were suggestive of systemic disease. Antinuclear antibody titers were low in 7 patients and higher in 1 patient. Conclusions and Relevance: Chilblains appeared not to be directly associated with COVID-19 in this case series. Lifestyle changes associated with community containment and lockdown measures are a possible explanation for these lesions.","Herman, Anne; Peeters, Caroline; Verroken, Alexia; Tromme, Isabelle; Tennstedt, Dominique; Marot, Liliane; Dachelet, Claire; Gruson, Damien; Hermans, Cedric; Baeck, Marie","JAMA dermatol.

Octagam significantly prolonged median survival time (68 versus 18 days, p = 0.014) and significantly reduced plasma levels of C-reactive protein (median change from baseline -71.5 versus -0.3 mg/L, p = 0.049). Conclusion: Clinically relevant benefits through adjunct Octagam treatment in COVID-19 need to be confirmed in a randomized, controlled trial.","Esen, Figen; Özcan, Perihan E; Orhun, Günseli; Polat, Özlem; Anakli, Ilkay; Alay, Gülçin; Tuna, Verda; Çeliksoy, Emre; Kiliç, Mehmet; Mercan, Mutlu; Tukek, Tufan",Curr Med Res Opin,195,24

To this end, a mixed-method design in which quantitative and qualitative approaches were used for collecting and analyzing the data of the study;a questionnaire was developed and sent online to the participants for the purpose of data collection. The sample of the study consisted of 120 students from selected Yemeni universities. The obtained data were analyzed via SPSS software in which the frequencies and percentages of the obtained responses were calculated. The analysis of the data revealed that English language teaching underwent an abrupt change because of the unexpected circumstances that were caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, and several changes were also made to the curriculum, students’ performance evaluation, and pedagogy. Besides, the findings showed that Yemeni students faced several challenges including poor Wi-Fi connection, lack of access to some learning websites, and the absence of some equipment necessary for online learning. Regardless of these challenges, most of the participants reported that they can manage to do their final evaluation online which indicates that if the online teaching methods are implemented properly, the online learning of the English Language during the pandemic period will be successful in the Yemeni universities. The present study provides recommendations which can be useful for EFL learners and teachers, decisionmakers, teaching English and perhaps the entire teaching process in Yemen. © 2021.

Characteristic RNA sequences within RNA virus genomes or RNAs transcribed from DNA virus genomes contribute toward this inhibition. In this study, we developed a method called ""Fate-seq"" to comprehensively identify the RNA sequences derived from RNA and DNA viruses, contributing RNA stability in the cells. We examined the stabilization activity of 5,924 RNA fragments derived from 26 different viruses (16 RNA viruses and 10 DNA viruses) using next-generation sequencing of these RNAs fused 3' downstream of GFP reporter RNA. With the Fate-seq approach, we detected multiple virus-derived RNA sequences that stabilized GFP reporter RNA, including sequences derived from severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Comparative genomic analysis revealed that these RNA sequences and their predicted secondary structures are highly conserved between SARS-CoV and the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, which is responsible for the global outbreak of the coronavirus-associated disease that emerged in December 2019 (COVID-19). These sequences have the potential to enhance the stability of viral RNA genomes, thereby augmenting viral replication efficiency and virulence.","Wakida, Hiroyasu; Kawata, Kentaro; Yamaji, Yuta; Hattori, Emi; Tsuchiya, Takaho; Wada, Youichiro; Ozaki, Haruka; Akimitsu, Nobuyoshi",Biochem Biophys Res Commun,195,1

It is necessary to gain a better understanding of nurses' experiences to develop interventions supportive of their emotional well-being. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study is to explore how nurses are emotionally affected working in COVID-19 acute care hospital environments. The research question is: What is the emotional experience of nurses working in COVID-19 acute care hospital environments? METHODS: We employed a narrative methodology that focused on participants' stories. Twenty registered nurses, who worked in six hospitals in the Greater Toronto Area in Canada, participated in interviews. A narrative analysis was conducted with a focus on content and form of stories. RESULTS: We identified three themes about working in COVID-19 acute care hospital environments: the emotional experience, the agency of emotions, and how emotions shape nursing and practice. CONCLUSION: In moving forth with pandemic preparations, healthcare leaders and governments need to make sure that a nurse's sacrifice is not all-encompassing. Supporting nurses' emotional well-being and resilience is necessary to counterbalance the loss and trauma nurses go through.","Lapum, Jennifer; Nguyen, Megan; Fredericks, Suzanne; Lai, Sannie; McShane, Julie",Can J Nurs Res,195,13

Here we describe the presence and biodiversity of bats associated with intensive pig farms devoted to the production of heavy pigs in northern Italy. Since chiropters or signs of their presence were not found within animal shelters in our study area, we suggest that fecal viruses with high environmental resistance have the highest likelihood for spillover through indirect transmission. In turn, we investigated the circulation of mammalian orthoreoviruses (MRVs), coronaviruses (CoVs) and astroviruses (AstVs) in pigs and bats sharing the same environment. Results of our preliminary study did not show any bat virus in pigs suggesting that spillover from these animals is rare. However, several AstVs, CoVs and MRVs circulated undetected in pigs. Among those, one MRV was a reassortant strain carrying viral genes likely acquired from bats. On the other hand, we found a swine AstV and a MRV strain carrying swine genes in bat guano, indicating that viral exchange at the bat-pig interface might occur more frequently from pigs to bats rather than the other way around. Considering the indoor farming system as the most common system in the European Union (EU), preventive measures should focus on biosecurity rather than displacement of bats, which are protected throughout the EU and provide critical ecosystem services for rural settings.","Leopardi, Stefania; Priori, Pamela; Zecchin, Barbara; Zamperin, Gianpiero; Milani, Adelaide; Tonon, Francesco; Giorgiutti, Mirco; Beato, Maria Serena; De Benedictis, Paola",Viruses,195,20

We suggest performing PET/CT at least two weeks after vaccination in patients with a cancer for which interpretation is anticipated to be potentially impacted by the vaccination, though optimally 4-6 weeks after vaccination given increased immunogenicity of mRNA vaccines and potentially longer time for resolution than lymphadenopathy after other vaccines. PET/CT should not be delayed when clinically indicated to be performed sooner. Details regarding vaccination should be collected at the time of PET/CT to facilitate interpretation. Follow-up recommendations for post-vaccination lymphadenopathy are provided, considering the lymph node's morphology and likely clinical relevance. Consideration should also be given to administering the vaccine in the arm contralateral to a unilateral cancer to avoid potentially confounding FDG uptake on the side of cancer.

The aim of the present study is to undertake a joint evaluation of hs-Troponin and natriuretic peptides (NP) in patients hospitalized for COVID-19 pneumonia. METHODS: In this multicenter observational study, we analyzed data from n = 111 patients. Cardiac biomarkers subgroups were identified according to values beyond reference range. RESULTS: Increased hs-Troponin and NP were found in 38 and 56% of the cases, respectively. As compared to those with normal cardiac biomarkers, these patients were older, had higher prevalence of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and had more severe COVID-19 pneumonia by higher CRP and D-dimer and lower PaO2/FIO2. Two-dimensional echocardiography performed in a subset of patients (n = 24) showed significantly reduced left ventricular ejection fraction in patients with elevated NP (p = 0.02), whereas right ventricular systolic function (tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion) was significantly reduced both in patients with high hs-Troponin and NP (p = 0.022 and p = 0.03, respectively). Both hs-Troponin and NP were higher in patients with in-hospital mortality (p = 0.001 and p = 0.002, respectively).

Scoring high on resilience (OR = 0.93; 0.92-0.95, P < .001), reporting higher emotional social support (OR = 0.75; 0.70-0.79, P < .001), and reporting higher levels of instrumental social support (OR = 0.69, 0.62-0.76, P < .001) were significantly associated with lower suicide risk. CONCLUSIONS: Students attending tribal colleges who experience hearing impairment, sight impairment, or a physical/emotional/mental condition have a greater risk of suicidality. Students experiencing critical appraisal and critical isolation may benefit from behavioral health interventions to reframe these experiences and develop resiliency skills. Developing avenues of emotional and instrumental social support within TCU settings offers key protective factors to buffer the risk of suicidality. Examining additional ways to build resiliency may also offer protection from suicide risk in this population.","Parker, Myra; Duran, Bonnie; Rhew, Isaac; Magarati, Maya; Larimer, Mary; Donovan, Dennis",J. rural health,195,6

Internet of Things (IoT) technologies can play a crucial role during the time of crisis and they can provide a more holistic view of the reasons that govern the outbreak of a contagious disease. The understanding of COVID-19 will be enriched by the analysis of data related to the phenomena, and this data can be collected using IoT sensors. In this paper, we show an integrated solution based on IoT technologies that can serve as opportunistic health data acquisition agents for combating the pandemic of COVID-19, named CIoTVID. The platform is composed of four layers-data acquisition, data aggregation, machine intelligence and services, within the solution. To demonstrate its validity, the solution has been tested with a use case based on creating a classifier of medical conditions using real data of voice, performing successfully. The layer of data aggregation is particularly relevant in this kind of solution as the data coming from medical devices has a very different nature to that coming from electronic sensors. Due to the adaptability of the platform to heterogeneous data and volumes of data; individuals, policymakers, and clinics could benefit from it to fight the propagation of the pandemic.","Ramallo-González, Alfonso P; González-Vidal, Aurora; Skarmeta, Antonio F",Sensors (Basel),195,26

The COVID-19 pandemic indeed had a huge impact on the educational system in Nigeria. It brought about the cessation of all learning activities in Nigeria except for private universities and secondary schools that swiftly switched to virtual learning platforms. It also illuminated the digital divide between the Nigerian student and his counterparts in other climes. COVID-19 pandemic outbreak also offered an opportunity for the nation to realise the poor status of its educational system. Some of the major problems that have confronted the Nigerian education system, as revealed by this paper, include poor funding, inadequate and dilapidating infrastructure, inadequate teaching facilities, poor teachers’ welfare, poor research funding, poor quality of teachers, unconducive learning environment, and the like.

As the pandemic continues to affect these services an evaluation was conducted to determine whether telephone consultations implemented during the pandemic should be maintained long term. The objective was to evaluate this new service and to understand patient experience. METHODS: This study was conducted via a telephone survey. Staff working in the Macmillan centres across the Trust called patients to survey them about their experience of telephone consultations. Data were collected 23/06/20 - 17/07/20. A mix of eight open and closed questions were asked. Data were collected on an Excel spreadsheet and patient identifiable information was anonymised. RESULTS: 55 patients accepted to participate in this study. Out of 55, 39 patients rated the phone consultation they had as either 4 or 5 out of 5. When asked if they would like to continue with phone clinics 33 said they would. The majority of consultations were conducted by doctors (43/55). Patients commented they had received great support from their healthcare professionals and they felt that phone consultations were safer in the current climate. Three of the patients felt the calls were rushed and others found it difficult to discuss pain management, sides effects and post-surgery issues. CONCLUSIONS: This evaluation provides a brief snapshot of the experience cancer patients are having with phone clinics. A re-evaluation will take place once video consultations are implemented.","Dalby, Melanie; Hill, Alison; Nabhani-Gebara, Shereen",J Oncol Pharm Pract,195,26

This position has also been endorsed in a statement by a working group for the WHO. The papers generally argue that controlled human infection (CHI) is ethically acceptable if (1) the risks to participants are low and therefore acceptable, (2) the scientific quality of the research is high, (3) the research has high social value, (4) participants give full informed consent, and (5) there is fair selection of participants. All five conditions are necessary premises in the overall argument that such research is ethically acceptable. The arguments concerning risk and informed consent have already been critically discussed in the literature. This paper therefore looks specifically at the arguments relating to condition 3 'high social value' and condition 5 'fair selection of participants' and shows that whereas they may be valid, they are not sound. It is highly unlikely that the conditions that are necessary for ethical CHI trials to take place will be fulfilled.

To highlight this issue, we spokewith patients about their experiences with antibiotics as treatment for COVID-19 and their understanding of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). We found that there is a general lack of awareness of the risks of AMR, and even when patients are knowledgeable, fear of COVID-19 and pressure from healthcare providers often override considerations for appropriate use. We present case examples of three patients' experiences and provide recommendations for health systems, healthcare providers, and patients or caregivers on actions they can each take to reduce the risk of AMR during and beyond the COVID-19 pandemic. We also share ways that the patient community can be empowered to provide their voices to decision-making on both COVID-19 treatment protocols and prescriptions of antibiotics.","Dahal, D.; Sundar, S.; Kullar, R.; Milevska-Kostova, N.; Dindial, K.",JAC-Antimicrobial Resistance,195,16

Believers in conspiracy theories promote misinformation that the virus is not contagious, is the result of laboratory manipulation or is created to gain profit by distributing new vaccines. The most dangerous effect of this widely disseminated misinformation is it will negatively influence the attitudes and behaviours for preventive measures to contain the outbreak.

The aim of this study was to assess the possible roles of Jordanian pharmacists in minimizing the stage of community transmission. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey using Google forms targeting Jordanian pharmacists was conducted during March 2020 and distributed electronically by means of social media. Using the survey tool, we measured the pharmacists' knowledge, the educative activities they perform, and their perceptions regarding undertaking traditional and untraditional roles during the COVID-19 outbreak, as specified by the International Pharmaceutical Federation (FIP). Collected data were analyzed using SPSS version-19. RESULTS: Jordanian pharmacists (n = 449) reported performing various educative activities, and in general, they were knowledgeable about various aspects of the COVID-19 disease (median knowledge score: 20 [range, 13-25]), but certain gaps in knowledge were detected that must be addressed. Pharmacists had positive perceptions about both their traditional and untraditional roles specified by the FIP, the median perceptions score was 4 (range, 1-5). CONCLUSIONS: Jordanian pharmacists can be used to reduce community transmission of the outbreak. However, more actions are required to keep pharmacists knowledgeable with recent disease updates to enable them to perform their tasks effectively during times of crisis.","Abdel Jalil, Mariam; Alsous, Mervat M; Abu Hammour, Khawla; Saleh, Mais M; Mousa, Rimal; Hammad, Eman A",Disaster Med Public Health Prep,195,26

We found consistent support for configural and metric invariance across all constructs, but scalar invariance was unsupported for depression and IU. Thus, it is necessary to interpret pandemic-associated mean-level changes in depression and IU cautiously. In contrast, mean-level comparisons of panic, generalized, and social anxiety symptoms were not compromised. These findings are limited to the specific measures examined and the developmental period of the sample.

This research aims to develop the Spanish version of the Sniffin' Sticks Olfactory Identification Test and obtain normative values for the Spanish population. The parameters are free recall and subjective intensity of odorants are included. The influence of possible demographic covariates such as sex, age, smoking, or educational level are analyzed, and the items that best discriminate are studied. In addition, the internal structure validity of the blue and purple versions is studied as a parallel measure, and a cultural adaptation of the purple version is carried out. For this, three independent samples of normosmic healthy volunteers were studied. To obtain normative values, the sample was of 417 participants (18-89 years). For the internal structure validity study of both versions, the sample was 226 (18-70 years), and for familiarity of the purple version, the sample was 75 participants (21-79 years). Results indicated that men and women and smokers and non-smokers perform equally. However, differences were found as age progresses, being more pronounced after 60 years old in all three measurements of the identification test. This research also provides the items that best discriminate in the blue version and a cultural adaptation for the purple version. In conclusion, the Sniffin' Sticks Odor Identification Test is a suitable tool for olfactory assessment in the Spanish population. The instrument has been expanded with two new scores, and normative data as a function of age are provided. Its parallel version also seems appropriate for testing, as items have been culturally adapted and evidence of internal structure validity for both versions is reported.","Delgado-Losada, María Luisa; Bouhaben, Jaime; Delgado-Lima, Alice Helena",,195,25

Drugs with quinoline scaffolds have been studied to repurpose their useful broad-spectrum properties into treating various diseases, including viruses. Preliminary studies on the quinoline medications, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, against SARS-CoV-2, have shown to be a potential area of interest for drug development due to their ability to prevent viral entry, act as anti-inflammatory modulators, and inhibit key enzymes allowing reduced viral infectivity. In addition to Chloroquine and Hydroxychloroquine, we discussed analogs of the drugs to understand the quinoline scaffold's potential antiviral mechanisms. The heterocyclic scaffold of quinoline can be modified in many ways, primarily through the modification of its substituents. We studied these different synthetic derivatives to understand properties that could enhance its antiviral specificity thoroughly. Chloroquine and its analogs can act on various stages of the viral life cycle, pre and post entry. In this study, we reviewed chloroquine and its synthetic and natural analogs for their antiviral properties in a variety of viruses. Furthermore, we reviewed the compound's potential abilities to attenuate symptoms associated with viral infections. Natural compounds that share scaffolding to chloroquine can act as antivirals or attenuate symptoms through the stimulation of the host immune system or reduction of oxidative stress. Furthermore, we discuss perspectives of the drug's repurposing due to its ability to inhibit the beta-hematin formation and to be a Zinc Ionophore.","Pallaval, Veera B; Kanithi, Manasa; Meenakshisundaram, Sangeetha; Jagadeesh, Achanta; Alavala, Mattareddy; Pillaiyar, Thanigaimalai; Manickam, Manoj; Chidipi, Bojjibabu",Curr Pharm Des,195,26

MPI was calculated using different domains explored by a standard comprehensive geriatric assessment and categorized into tertiles (MPI-1 ≤ 0.20, MPI-2 0.20–0.34, MPI-3 &gt; 0.34). A Cox’s regression analysis, taking mortality as the outcome, was used, reporting the results as hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). In total, 653 older patients were enrolled (mean age: 82 years, 59.1% females). Patients in MPI-2 (HR = 3.66;95%CI: 2.45–5.47) and MPI-3 (HR = 6.22;95%CI: 4.22–9.16) experienced a higher risk of mortality, compared to MPI-1.

Although much is known about its different clinical symptoms, there are significant knowledge gaps about its pathology and cellular responses to the virus. Copper plays an essential role in respiration, immune function and free-radical defense. Despite its important action in physiochemical properties, only small amount of copper is presented in biological fluid, none of which presents as free ion form that readily affirms its depletion in critically ill patients. Recent studies confirmed its anti-viral capacity. Closer understanding of copper signaling, its vulnerability, method of assessment and interpretation, administration rout and dosage opens up new perspectives regarding therapeutic copper administration against critically ill COVID-19 patients. So, it seems that physicians should consider copper insufficiency in their critically ill COVID-19 patients. However, an attention should be paid to copper toxicity and estimating the adverse responses depending on copper dose or severity of copper limitation, as well as the duration of copper misbalance.","Fooladi, Shahnaz; Matin, Somaieh; Mahmoodpoor, Ata",Clin Nutr ESPEN,195,5

OBJECTIVE: The aim was to investigate whether vitamin D deficiency is associated with COVID-19 incidence and disease severity in Chinese people. METHODS: In a cross-sectional study we retrospectively analyzed 335 COVID-19 patients (median: 56.0; IQR: 43.0-64.0 y) who were admitted to the Wuhan Tongji Hospital between 27 February and 21 March 2020. We also included an age- and sex-matched population of 560 individuals (median: 55; IQR: 49.0-60.0 y) who underwent the physical examination program. Their serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentrations were measured during the same period from 2018-2019. Serum 25(OH)D concentrations were measured for all COVID-19 patients on admission. Severity of COVID-19 was determined based on the level of respiratory involvement. A general linear model with adjustment for covariates was used to compare 25(OH)D concentrations between the COVID-19 and 2018-2019 control groups. Adjusted ORs with 95% CIs for associations between vitamin D status and COVID-19 severity were estimated via multivariable logistic regression. RESULTS: In the general linear model adjusted for age, sex, comorbidities, and BMI, serum 25(OH)D concentrations were significantly lower among COVID-19 patients than the 2018-2019 controls [ln transformed values of 3.32 ± 0.04 vs. 3.46 ± 0.022 ln (nmol/L), P = 0.014].

RECENT FINDINGS: The outbreak of the COVID-19 has had effect of unprecedented magnitude on the social, economic and personal aspects around the globe. Healthcare providers were forced to expand capacity to provide care to the surging number of symptomatic COVID-19 patients, while maintaining a fully operating service for all non-COVID patients. The recent literature suggesting an overall decrease in acute ischemic stroke admissions as well as total number of endovascular treatments will be reviewed. Although the underlying reasons therefore remain the matter of debate, it seems that the imposed restrictions, requiring social distancing, and stopping all nonessential services, have led to a higher threshold for patients to seek medical attention, in particular in those with less severe symptoms. Thus, raising public awareness on the importance of strokes and transient ischemic attacks is even more important in the light of the current situation to avoid serious healthcare, economic consequences, and limit long term morbidity. SUMMARY: The priority remains maintaining a fast and efficient pre and in-hospital work-flow while mitigating nosocomial transmission and protecting the patient and the healthcare workers with appropriate personal protective equipment.","Dobrocky, Tomas; Kaesmacher, Johannes; Pereira, Vitor Mendes; Gralla, Jan; Fischer, Urs",Curr. opin. neurol,195,1

METHODS: In this unmatched 1:1 case-control study, blood samples from 46 real-time RT-PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 hospitalized cases and 45 healthy donors (negative controls) were studied. Diagnostic accuracy of the IgG RDT was assessed against both an in-house recombinant spike-expressing immunofluorescence assay (rIFA), as an established reference method (primary endpoint), and the Euroimmun SARS-CoV-2 IgG enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) (secondary endpoint). RESULTS: COVID-19 patients were more likely to be male (61% vs 20%; P = .0001) and older (median 66 vs 47 years old; P < .001) than controls. Whole blood IgG-RDT results showed 86% and 93% overall Kendall concordance with rIFA and IgG ELISA, respectively. IgG RDT performances were similar between plasma and whole blood. Overall, RDT sensitivity was 88% (95% confidence interval [95%CI]: 70-96), specificity 98% (95%CI: 90-100), PPV 97% (95%CI: 80-100) and NPV 94% (95%CI: 84-98).

Experimental data shows that solid mammary tumors depend on aerobic glycolysis during the day but likely revert to mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation at night for ATP production. This conversion of diseased cells during the day to a healthier phenotype at night occurs under control of the circulating melatonin rhythm. When the nocturnal melatonin rise is inhibited by light exposure at night, cancer cells function in the diseased state 24/7. The ability of melatonin to switch cancer cells as well as other diseased cells, e.g., Alzheimer disease, fibrosis, hyperactivation of macrophages, etc., from aerobic glycolysis to mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation may be a basic protective mechanism to reduce pathologies.","Reiter, Russel J; Sharma, Ramaswamy; Ma, Qiang",J Pineal Res,195,24

As such, Japanese macaques (Macaca fuscata) have contributed to the advancement of primatology in both field and laboratory settings. Specifically, Japanese macaques serve as an excellent model for investigating postnatal development and seasonal breeding in primates because of their relatively prolonged juvenile period and distinct seasonal breeding activity in adulthood. Pioneering histological studies have examined the developmental associations between their reproductive states and spermatogenesis by morphological observation. However, a molecular histological atlas of Japanese macaque spermatogenesis is only in its infancy, limiting our understanding of spermatogenesis ontogeny related to their reproductive changes. Here, we performed immunofluorescence analyses of spermatogenesis in Japanese macaque testes to determine the expression of a subset of marker proteins. The present molecular histological analyses readily specified major spermatogonial subtypes as SALL4+ A spermatogonia and Ki67+/C-KIT+ B spermatogonia. The expression of DAZL, SCP1, Î³H2AX, VASA, and calmegin further showed sequential changes regarding the protein expression profile and chromosomal structures during spermatogenesis in a differentiation stage-specific manner. Accordingly, comparative analyses between subadults and adults identified spermatogenic deficits in differentiation and synchronization in subadult testes.

However, little is known regarding the risk for those not admitted to hospital. We therefore examined prescription drug and health-care use after SARS-CoV-2 infection not requiring hospital admission. METHODS: This was a population-based cohort study using the Danish prescription, patient, and health insurance registries. All individuals with a positive or negative RT-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 in Denmark between Feb 27 and May 31, 2020, were eligible for inclusion. Outcomes of interest were delayed acute complications, chronic disease, hospital visits due to persisting symptoms, and prescription drug use. We used data from non-hospitalised SARS-CoV-2-positive and matched SARS-CoV-2-negative individuals from 2 weeks to 6 months after a SARS-CoV-2 test to obtain propensity score-weighted risk differences (RDs) and risk ratios (RRs) for initiation of 14 drug groups and 27 hospital diagnoses indicative of potential post-acute effects. We also calculated prior event rate ratio-adjusted rate ratios of overall health-care use. This study is registered in the EU Electronic Register of Post-Authorisation Studies (EUPAS37658). FINDINGS: 10 498 eligible individuals tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in Denmark from Feb 27 to May 31, 2020, of whom 8983 (85·6%) were alive and not admitted to hospital 2 weeks after their positive test. The matched SARS-CoV-2-negative reference population not admitted to hospital consisted of 80 894 individuals. Compared with SARS-CoV-2-negative individuals, SARS-CoV-2-positive individuals were not at an increased risk of initiating new drugs (RD <0·1%) except bronchodilating agents, specifically short-acting ß2-agonists (117 [1·7%] of 6935 positive individuals vs 743 [1·3%] of 57 206 negative individuals; RD +0·4% [95% CI 0·1-0·7]; RR 1·32 [1·09-1·60]) and triptans (33 [0·4%] of 8292 vs 198 [0·3%] of 72 828; RD +0·1% [0·0-0·3]; RR 1·55 [1·07-2·25]). There was an increased risk of receiving hospital diagnoses of dyspnoea (103 [1·2%] of 8676 vs 499 [0·7%] of 76 728; RD +0·6% [0·4-0·8]; RR 2·00 [1·62-2·48]) and venous thromboembolism (20 [0·2%] of 8785 vs 110 [0·1%] of 78 872; RD +0·1% [0·0-0·2]; RR 1·77 [1·09-2·86]) for SARS-CoV-2-positive individuals compared with negative individuals, but no increased risk of other diagnoses. Prior event rate ratio-adjusted rate ratios of overall general practitioner visits (1·18 [95% CI 1·15-1·22]) and outpatient hospital visits (1·10 [1·05-1·16]), but not hospital admission, showed increases among SARS-CoV-2-positive individuals compared with SARS-CoV-2-negative individuals.

The injectable recombinant IFN-ß preparations are the first approved disease-modifying treatments for MS. They have moderate efficacy in reducing the frequency of relapses, but good long-term cost-efficacy and safety profiles, so are still widely used. They have some tolerability and adherence issues, partly mitigated in recent years by the introduction of a PEGylated formulation and use of 'smart' autoinjector devices. Their general impact on long-term disability is modest but could be further improved by developing accurate tools for identifying the patient profile of best responders to IFN-ß.

BACKGROUND: Although as a profession nursing generally requires high levels of performance, the disruption arising from an infectious disease outbreak increases the work stress and decreases the performance of front-line nurses. How this situation can be improved has yet to be thoroughly examined. METHOD: We used a snowball sampling technique to recruit 339 nurses who were originally from outside Hubei but volunteered to join medical teams going to Hubei to tackle COVID-19. RESULTS: Drawing on the theory of work as a calling, we found that living a calling had a positive effect on front-line nurses' performance through the clinical and relational care they provided. Perceived supervisor support strengthened these mediated relationships. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that despite the constraints associated with pandemics, front-line nurses who are living a calling are able to provide better clinical and relational care to infected patients, which in turn improves their performance. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING MANAGEMENT: The findings of this study suggest that hospitals can introduce career educational interventions to enhance nurses' ability to discern and live out their calling to improve their performance.","Zhou, Yan; Asante, Eric Adom; Zhuang, Yiyu; Wang, Jie; Zhu, Yue; Shen, Lihua",J. nurs. manag,195,9

There are very few indications for performing bronchoscopy in a patient with confirmed COVID-19. These include atelectasis, foreign body aspiration, and suspected superinfection in immunocompromised patients. Proper use of standard personal protective equipment is mandatory to reduce the risk of transmission to health care workers.

Symptoms of this viral infection, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), include mild infections of the upper respiratory tract, viral pneumonia, respiratory failure, multiple organ failure and death. Till date, no drugs have been discovered to treat COVID-19 patients, and therefore, a considerable amount of interest has been shown in repurposing the existing drugs. Recent Findings: Out of these drugs, chloroquine (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) have demonstrated positive results indicating a potential antiviral role against SARS-CoV-2. Its mechanism of action (MOA) includes the interference in the endocytic pathway, blockade of sialic acid receptors, restriction of pH mediated spike (S) protein cleavage at the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) binding site and prevention of cytokine storm. Unfortunately, its adverse effects like gastrointestinal complications, retinopathy and QT interval prolongation are evident in treated COVID-19 patients. Yet, multiple clinical trials have been employed in several countries to evaluate its ability in turning into a needed drug in this pandemic. Summary: This review attempts to summarize the MOA of CQ/HCQ and its side effects. The existing literature hints that till date, the role of CQ/HCQ in COVID-19 may be sceptical, and further studies are warranted for obtaining a therapeutic option that could be effectively used across the world to rise out from this pandemic.","Satarker, Sairaj; Ahuja, Tejas; Banerjee, Madhuparna; E, Vignesh Balaji; Dogra, Shagun; Agarwal, Tushar; Nampoothiri, Madhavan",Curr Pharmacol Rep,195,1

This affected all sorts of daily activities and the possibility for physical activity (PA), which represents a major coping strategy against stress. The objective of this study was to analyse PA in German adults during a total lockdown phase including school closures in April 2020 in certain subgroups and in relation to other coping strategies. Data from the COVID-19 Snapshot Monitoring (COSMO) survey, an online cross-sectional study with 1034 participants between 18 and 74 years, were utilised (14/15 April 2020). In addition to descriptive analyses, the odds of performing PA according to the World Health Organization (WHO) recommendations for adults (at least 2.5 h/week of at least moderate intensity) were analysed by univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses. In total, 440 (42.6%) participants fulfilled this criterion. Participants with children <6 years were less likely to meet the WHO recommendation (OR = 0.51; 95% CI: 0.33-0.78), while those with a higher level of education, good coping behaviour, regular alcohol consumption, and being satisfied with life were more likely to meet the WHO recommendation. In conclusion, PA intervention strategies tailored to specific vulnerable subgroups such as individuals with low educational background and parents with young children are needed in future pandemic response.","Maertl, Theresa; De Bock, Freia; Huebl, Lena; Oberhauser, Cornelia; Coenen, Michaela; Jung-Sievers, Caroline",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),195,16

The pandemic itself has created further cascading economic, financial, and social crises. To date, approximately 114,000 Americans have died and approximately 2,000,000 (as of this writing) have become infected. American emergency planning and response, including for pandemics, begins at the local (city, town, and county) level, close to the individuals and communities most impacted. During crises like COVID-19, natural and other disasters, best practices include “whole of government” and “whole community” approaches, involving all parts of the government, community organizations, institutions, and businesses, with representation from diverse individual community stakeholders. Local emergency management and public health agencies are at the heart of emergency planning and response and thus warrant further examination. While collaboration between the two is recognized as a best practice, in reality there appear to be silos and gaps. This Commentary describes the American emergency planning system and the roles of local emergency management and public health departments. Closer examination illuminates similarities and differences in practitioner demographics, professional competencies, organizational goals, and culture. The Commentary reviews the limited research and observations of collaboration efforts and suggests areas for integrating the two practice areas in future research, education, professional training, and practice. Breaking down the silos will strengthen local emergency and public health preparedness planning and response, ultimately leading to stronger community health, well-being, resilience, and more efficient local administration.","Wolf-Fordham, Susan",Am.

One of many negative impacts may be on animal reproduction. Elevated ambient temperature unfavourably influences reproductive processes in mammals. High temperature can affect reproductive processes such as follicle development and may alter follicular fluid concentrations of amino acids, fatty acids, minerals, enzymes, antioxidants defence and growth factors. These impacts may lead to inferior oocyte competence and abnormal granulosa cell (GCs) function. Mammalian oocytes are enclosed by GCs that secret hormones and signalling molecules to promote oocyte competence. GCs are essential for proper follicular development, oocyte maturation, ovulation, and luteinization. Many environmental stressors, including thermal stress, affect GC function and alter oocyte development and growth. Several studies documented a link between elevated ambient temperature and increased generation of cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS can damage DNA, reduce cell proliferation, and induce apoptosis in GCs, thus altering oocyte development. Additionally, thermal stress induces upregulation of thermal shock proteins, such as HSP70 and HSP90. This review provides an update on the influence of thermal stress on GCs of mammals. Discussions include impacts to steroidogenesis (estradiol and progesterone), proliferation and cell cycle transition, apoptosis, oxidative stress (ROS), antioxidants related genes, heat shock proteins (HSPs) and endoplasmic reticulum responses.","Abdelnour, Sameh A; Swelum, Ayman A; Abd El-Hack, Mohamed E; Khafaga, Asmaa F; Taha, Ayman E; Abdo, Mohamed",J Therm Biol,195,16

Design: Retrospective study. Participants: All patients 18 years or older presenting for ophthalmic consultation to the Kresge Eye Institute Emergency Walk-in Clinic between March 23rd and April 17th, 2020 were included in the study. Methods: All patients who met the inclusion criteria were indexed based on their initial encounter date and patients were stratified by urgent and non-urgent ophthalmic reasons for evaluation. Patient demographics, medical history, chief complaint, diagnosis, and need for surgical intervention and procedures were obtained from the electronic medical records. Results: The most common diagnoses were corneal disease (31.4%), followed by vitreoretinal disease (25.3%), orbit-eyelid pathology (8.8%), and glaucoma-related issues (8.8%). The most common office procedure was intravitreal injections (37.5%) followed by foreign body removal (21.9%), and pan-retinal photocoagulation laser (21.9%).

Our objective was to evaluate the early effects of the pandemic on the emotional well-being of oncology providers across the United States and explore factors associated with anxiety and depression symptoms. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was administered to United States cancer-care physicians recruited over a two-week period (3/27/2020-4/10/2020) using snowball-convenience sampling through social media. Symptoms of anxiety and depression were measured using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-4). RESULTS: Of 486 participants, 374 (77.0%) completed the PHQ-4: median age was 43 years; 63.2% female; all oncologic specialties were represented. The rates of anxiety and depression symptoms were 62.0% and 23.5%, respectively. Demographic factors associated with anxiety included female sex, younger age, and less time in clinical practice. Perception of inadequate personal protective equipment (68.6% vs. 57.4%, p = 0.03) and practicing in a state with more COVID-19 cases (65.8% vs. 51.1%, p = 0.01) were associated with anxiety symptoms. Factors significantly associated with both anxiety and depression included the degree to which COVID-19 has interfered with the ability to provide treatment to cancer patients and concern that patients will not receive the level of care needed for non-COVID-19 illness (all p-values <0.01). CONCLUSION: The perceived degree of interference with clinical practice along with personal concerns about COVID-19 were significantly associated with both anxiety and depression among oncology physicians in the United States during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our findings highlight factors associated with and sources of psychological distress to be addressed to protect the well-being of oncology physicians.","Thomaier, Lauren; Teoh, Deanna; Jewett, Patricia; Beckwith, Heather; Parsons, Helen; Yuan, Jianling; Blaes, Anne H; Lou, Emil; Hui, Jane Yuet Ching; Vogel, Rachel I",PLoS One,195,16

RECENT FINDINGS: Ophthalmology has been leading in artificial intelligence and technology applications. With medical imaging analysis, pixel-annotated distinguishable features on COVID-19 patients may help with noninvasive diagnosis and severity outcome predictions. Using natural language processing (NLP) and data integration methods, topic modeling on more than 200 ophthalmology-related articles on COVID-19 can summarize ocular manifestations, viral transmission, treatment strategies, and patient care and practice management. Artificial intelligence for telemedicine applications can address the high demand, prioritize and triage patients, as well as improve at home-monitoring devices and secure data transfers. SUMMARY: COVID-19 is significantly impacting the way we are delivering healthcare. Given the already successful implementation of artificial intelligence applications and telemedicine in ophthalmology, we expect that these systems will be embraced more as tools for research, education, and patient care.","Hallak, Joelle A; Scanzera, Angelica C; Azar, Dimitri T; Chan, R V Paul",Curr Opin Ophthalmol,195,1

METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 9452 HF admissions were studied using claims data of 65 Helios hospitals; 1979 in the study period (13 March 30 April 2020) and 4691 and 2782 in two control periods (13 March to 30 April 2019 and 1 January to 12 March 2020). HF admissions declined compared with both control periods by 29-38%. Cardiac resynchronization therapy was implanted in 0.55% during the study period, 0.32% [odds ratio (OR) 1.66, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.68-4.04, P = 0.27] in the previous year and 0.43% (OR 1.35, 95% CI 0.64-2.84, P = 0.43) in the same year control. Intensive care treatment was 6.22% during the study period, 4.49% in the previous year (OR 1.46, 95% CI 1.13-1.89, P < 0.01), and 5.27% in the same year control (OR 1.19, 95% CI 0.96-1.49, P = 0.12).

A total of 191 patients with COVID-19 were recruited at the Third Hospital of Wuhan from 21 January 2020 to 20 February 2020. Fifty healthy volunteers were randomly selected as the control group. Age, gender, white blood cell count (WBC), CRP, lymphocyte percentage, and NLR were extracted. Quantitative clinical characteristics and laboratory values were compared between groups. Risk factors and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves for COVID-19 were analyzed. We found that the NLR and CRP were higher, while the lymphocyte percentage was lower in patients with COVID-19 than in healthy controls. Among patients confirmed to have COVID-19, the NLR and CRP of the moderate group were lower than those of severely ill patients (severe, critical and death groups), and the lymphocyte percentage of the moderate group was higher than that of the critical and death group. There were no significant differences in WBC among all groups. Logistic regression analysis showed that the NLR, CRP, and lymphocyte percentage were independent risk factors for COVID-19. The AUC of the combined determination of NLR and CRP was 0.863, which was higher than that of NLR, CRP, WBC, and lymphocyte percentage (AUC: 0.835, 0.775, 0.416, and 0.749, respectively). Our results showed that the NLR and CRP were independent risk factors for COVID-19, and the combined detection of the NLR and CRP showed improved diagnostic performance for COVID-19.","Yufei, Yan; Mingli, Liu; Xuejiao, Li; Xuemei, Deng; Yiming, Jin; Qin, Qin; Hui, Shen; Jie, Guo",Scand J Clin Lab Invest,195,1

We first investigate the reasons why geographic questions are difficult to answer by analyzing challenges of geographic questions. We discuss the uniqueness of geographic questions compared to general QA. Then we review existing work on GeoQA and classify them by the types of questions they can address. Based on this survey, we provide a generic classification framework for geographic questions.

We explore associations between the change in new COVID-19 registered cases per million population and various macroeconomic and well-being indicators in 38 European countries over a 2-month period (1st April-31st May 2020). A statistically significant (p = 0.002) negative association was estimated between the change in new COVID-19 cases and GDP per capita, after controlling for key health determinants including public expenditure on health, life expectancy, smoking tobacco and sanitation. The country with the highest GDP per capita in Europe (i.e., Luxemburg) was found to experience the lowest change in new COVID-19 cases within the time period whilst the opposite was found for countries with lower GDP per capita (i.e., Ukraine, Bulgaria, and Romania). The outcomes of this study indicate that, in the first wave of the pandemic in Europe, a country's GDP per capita might be associated with a lower rate of new COVID-19 cases. The study concludes by suggesting that in European regions a country's economic performance should be a critical health priority for policy makers.","Pardhan, Shahina; Drydakis, Nick",Front Public Health,195,1

Given this context, some commentators have argued that new Covid vaccine trials should be able to use placebo controls, and that existing studies should be able to continue with blinded participants in order to collect high quality, unbiased data. Using international ethics guidance documents, this paper argues against placebo controls, given the existence of proven effective interventions, and against protracted blinding once safety and efficacy milestones have been met.

Importantly, the effect is found to be more pronounced for females in comparison to the males highlighting the gendered nature of the impact. On exploring possible pathways, we find that the direct time substitution on account of solid fuel collection and preparation can explain the detrimental educational outcomes that include learning outcomes as well, even though we are unable to reject the health channel.

The aim of this review is to suggest the future challenges midwives are going to face in the upcoming decade of this Century. COVID-19 and other infections will reasonably impact healthcare workers all over the world. Midwives are frontline healthcare professionals who are constantly at risk of contagion as their job implies close contact with women, physical support and hand touch. Also, menstruation waste plays a large role in the pollution of waters, severely impacting hygiene in the developing countries and fueling climate change. Appropriate disposal of used menstrual material is still insufficient in many countries of the world especially because of lack of sanitary education on girls. As educators, midwives will be more involved into preventing inappropriate disposal of menstrual hygiene devices by educating girls around the world about the green alternatives to the commercial ones. Despite the evidences about the fertility decrement that occurs with aging, women keep postponing reproduction and increasing their chance being childless or suffering complications related to the advanced maternal age. Teen pregnancies are as well an important issue for midwives who will be called to face more age-related issues and use a tailored case to case approach, enhancing their family planning skills. Another crucial role of midwifery regards the information about the risk of drinking alcohol during gestation. Alcohol assumption during pregnancy is responsible for serious damage to the fetus causing a wide range of pathological conditions related to Fetal Alcoholic Spectrum Disorder, leading cause of mental retardation in children of western countries. On the whole, midwives have demonstrated their willingness to expand their practice through continuing professional development, and through specialist and advanced roles especially in preventive and educational positions.","D039,; Angelo, A; Ferraguti, G; Petrella, C; Greco, A; Ralli, M; Vitali, M; Framarino Dei Malatesta, M; Fiore, M; Ceccanti, M; Messina, M P",Clin Ter,195,24

We use a staggered difference-in-difference model to explore whether state policies lead to preventive behaviors. We further examine heterogeneity in individual responses to state mandates by including interaction terms with health risk, economic insecurity, and media consumption. The study finds that state policies lead to increased adoption of these behaviors. Our findings also suggest that old age and living with the elderly are key predictors of preventive behavior adoption in the presence or even absence of state mandates. However, the economically insecure, such as the unemployed, those with low incomes and net worth, or without health insurance, are less likely to adopt preventive behaviors regardless of the mandates.

Through single cell RNA-seq and cytokine analyses of CSF and blood from COVID-19 patients with neurological symptoms, we find compartmentalized, CNS specific T cell activation and B cell responses. All COVID-19 cases had CSF anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies whose target epitopes diverged from serum antibodies. In an animal model, we find that intrathecal SARS-CoV-2 antibodies are found only during brain infection, and are not elicited by pulmonary infection. We produced CSF-derived monoclonal antibodies from a COVID-19 patient, and find that these mAbs target both anti-viral and anti-neural antigens-including one mAb that reacted to both spike protein and neural tissue.

We are still grappling with the implications in various areas of our everyday lives. The impulsive buying habits of consumers, the supply chain, and the whole industry are not exceptions. Consumers and supply chains were both unprepared during the early stages of the novel coronavirus pandemic. The procurement of utilitarian products was referred to as panic buying. The study examined using exploratory studies on several individuals in the eight selected Islamic countries who have been panic buying in coronavirus-affected areas and have faced regional constraints. The data apply on exploratory factor analysis (EFA) in eight selected Islamic countries, three hundred sample finally selected, and a good number of volunteers supported in this study.

The healthcare sector is under a tremendous burden, thus necessitating the prognosis of COVID-19 severity. This in-depth study of plasma proteome alteration provides insights into the host physiological response towards the infection and also reveals the potential prognostic markers of the disease. Using label-free quantitative proteomics, we performed deep plasma proteome analysis in a cohort of 71 patients (20 COVID-19 negative, 18 COVID-19 non-severe, and 33 severe) to understand the disease dynamics. Of the 1200 proteins detected in the patient plasma, 38 proteins were identified to be differentially expressed between non-severe and severe groups. The altered plasma proteome revealed significant dysregulation in the pathways related to peptidase activity, regulated exocytosis, blood coagulation, complement activation, leukocyte activation involved in immune response, and response to glucocorticoid biological processes in severe cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Furthermore, we employed supervised machine learning (ML) approaches using a linear support vector machine model to identify the classifiers of patients with non-severe and severe COVID-19. The model used a selected panel of 20 proteins and classified the samples based on the severity with a classification accuracy of 0.84. Putative biomarkers such as angiotensinogen and SERPING1 and ML-derived classifiers including the apolipoprotein B, SERPINA3, and fibrinogen gamma chain were validated by targeted mass spectrometry-based multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) assays. We also employed an in silico screening approach against the identified target proteins for the therapeutic management of COVID-19. We shortlisted two FDA-approved drugs, namely, selinexor and ponatinib, which showed the potential of being repurposed for COVID-19 therapeutics. Overall, this is the first most comprehensive plasma proteome investigation of COVID-19 patients from the Indian population, and provides a set of potential biomarkers for the disease severity progression and targets for therapeutic interventions.","Suvarna, K.; Biswas, D.; Pai, M.

Therefore, it is advantageous for human performance laboratories to continue operating during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. All institutions should adhere to general COVID-19 guidelines provided by the Centers for Disease Control. Because of the testing environment, CPX laboratories must consider additional precautionary safety measures. This article provides recommendations for modifying the CPX protocol to ensure safety for all stakeholders during the pandemic. These modifications are universal across all populations, types of institutions and testing modalities. Preliminary measures include careful review of federal, local, and institutional mandates. The description outlines how to evaluate a testing environment and alter workflow. Guidelines are provided on what specific personal protective equipment should be acquired; as well as necessary actions before, during, and after the CPX test. These precautions will limit the possibility of both clients and staff from contracting or spreading the disease while maintaining testing volume in the laboratory.","Duscha, Brian D; Johnson, Johanna L; Bennett, William C; Ball, Kelsey N; Mae Fos, Liezl B; Reaves, Megan A; Kraus, William E",Curr Sports Med Rep,195,24

OBJECTIVE: The aim was to explore healthcare workers' stress and influencing factors when caring for COVID-19 patients from an altruistic perspective. METHODS: A cross-sectional, descriptive study was conducted in a tertiary hospital during the outbreak of COVID-19 between February and March 2020 in Wuhan, the capital city of Hubei province in China. Data were collected from 1208 healthcare workers. Descriptive statistics and multiple linear regression were used to analyze the data. ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS: Research ethics approval (with the code of TJ-IRB20200379) was obtained from Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College of Huazhong University of Science and Technology. Written informed consent was also received from participants. RESULTS: Less than 60% of participants chose moderate or severe stress on all stressors, indicating a low stress level among healthcare workers. The main source of stress among frontline healthcare workers caring for COVID-19 patients came from the fear of being infected, the fear of family members being infected, and the discomfort caused by protective equipment. Frontline staff who were nurses, were married, and had worked more than 20 days suffered higher stress, whereas rescue staff showed lower stress. CONCLUSION: The healthcare workers caring for patients with COVID-19 had low stress level, although they still had the fear of being infected or uncomfortable feeling caused by personal protective equipment. A low stress level among healthcare workers indicated their professional devotion and altruism during COVID-19 epidemic. Medical institutions and the government should continue to strengthen infection prevention measures and provide more comprehensive care involving families of frontline healthcare workers, especially nurses and married staff. It will be a lesson to other countries that awaking healthcare workers' inside motivation and providing necessary support from government and society were significant.","Wang, Hui; Liu, Yu; Hu, Kaili; Zhang, Meng; Du, Meichen; Huang, Haishan; Yue, Xiao",Nurs Ethics,195,1

The aim of the present study was to explore the association of the prognostic nutritional index (PNI) score with the severity of COVID-19 and its predictive value of the severe form of COVID-19. METHODS: Clinical data were collected from 122 patients infected with COVID-19 and hospitalized at the Sixth People's Hospital of Wenzhou, China, a specialized infectious hospital affiliated with the Wenzhou Central Hospital. PNI score was calculated as serum albumin (g/L) + 5 × total lymphocyte count (/nL). RESULTS: The study population consisted of 105 patients (86.1%) with a common form and 17 patients (13.9%) with a severe form of COVID-19. PNI score significantly decreased from patients with common to severe forms of COVID-19 (P = .029) regardless of sex, age range, and body mass index (BMI). After adjustment for sex, age, indexes of liver and renal function, C-reactive protein, and current smoking status, PNI scores remained independently and inversely associated with the severity of COVID-19 (odd ratio: 0.797; P = .030). A receiver operating characteristic analysis showed that PNI scores had a similar accuracy to predict severe forms of COVID-19 compared with its combination with sex, age, and BMI (P = .402). PNI < 49 was defined as the cutoff value to predict the severe form of COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Poorer nutritional status predisposed patients infected with COVID-19 to its severe form. Independently associated with the severity of COVID-19, PNI score could serve as a simple, fast, and effective predictor among patients with different sex, age, and BMI.","Hu, Xiang; Deng, Huihui; Wang, Yuxia; Chen, Lingqiao; Gu, Xuemei; Wang, Xiaobo",Nutrition,195,29

Associations between PTSD and COVID-19 outcomes may affect Veterans Health Administration (VA) services, as PTSD occurs at higher rates among veterans than the general population. While previous research has identified the potential for increased PTSD prevalence resulting from COVID-19 as a public health concern, no known research examines the effect of pre-existing PTSD on COVID-19 test-seeking behavior or infection. This study aimed to evaluate pre-existing PTSD as a predictor of COVID-19 testing and test positivity. The sample consisted of 6,721,407 veterans who sought VA care between March 1, 2018 and February 29, 2020. Veterans with a previous PTSD clinical diagnosis were more likely to receive COVID-19 testing than veterans without PTSD. However, among those with available COVID-19 test results (n = 168,032), veterans with a previous PTSD clinical diagnosis were less likely to test positive than veterans without PTSD. Elevated COVID-19 testing rates among veterans with PTSD may reflect increased COVID-19 health concerns and/or hypervigilance. Lower rates of COVID-19 test positivity among veterans with PTSD may reflect increased social isolation, or overrepresentation in the tested population due to higher overall use of VA services. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues, the identification of patient-level psychiatric predictors of testing and test positivity can facilitate the targeted provision of medical and mental health services to individuals in need.","Haderlein, Taona P; Wong, Michelle S; Yuan, Anita; Llorente, Maria D; Washington, Donna L",J. psychiatr. res,195,16

A successful match into an ophthalmology residency was achieved by 144 (83.7%) applicants. Applicants applied to (mean ± SD) 79.7 ± 22.8 ophthalmology residency programs, received 13.1 ± 8.9 invitations to interview, and attended 11.1 ± 5.8 interviews. Most applicants (N = 126; 71.2%) and PDs (N = 22; 78.6%) expressed a preference for in-person interviews over virtual interviews. If given a choice regarding the future direction for interviews, most applicants were unsure (N = 68; 38.4%) or would prefer to hold interviews virtually (N = 62; 35.0%); PDs felt that interviews should go back to being in-person (39.3%) or were unsure (28.6%). Most PDs (N = 21; 72.4%) reported an increased number of applications received by their respective programs this year compared to previous years. While applicants (N = 108; 61.0%) mostly felt that there should not be a cap on the number of applications, 19 (67.9%) PDs supported a limit on application numbers. Applicants spent an average (SD) of $2320.96 ($1172.86) on the application process this year, which is significantly less than 2018-2019 data.Conclusions: The ophthalmology residency application process was especially complex during the COVID-19 pandemic. Although many applicants and PDs were glad that interviews were held virtually this year, they were less certain regarding future years. The virtual format led to a significantly lower financial burden for applicants and may lead some to prefer this format in the future; if a hybrid model is offered for virtual/in-person interviews, these two interview modes should be compared equally.","Venincasa, Michael J; Steren, Benjamin; Young, Benjamin K; Parikh, Ankur; Ahmed, Bilal; Sridhar, Jayanth; Kombo, Ninani",Semin Ophthalmol,195,1

Plasma HMGB1 and IL-6 levels at ICU admission also correlated with other prognostic markers, including the maximum neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio, D-dimer levels, and C-reactive protein levels. Plasma HMGB1 and IL-6 levels at ICU admission predicted ICU mortality with comparable accuracy to the SOFA score and the COVID-GRAM risk score. Higher HMGB1 and IL-6 were not independently associated with ICU mortality after adjustment for age, gender, and comorbidities in multivariate analysis models. In conclusion, plasma HMGB1 and IL6 at ICU admission may serve as prognostic biomarkers in critically ill COVID-19 patients.","Sivakorn, Chaisith; Dechsanga, Jutamas; Jamjumrus, Lawan; Boonnak, Kobporn; Schultz, Marcus J; Dorndorp, Arjen M; Phumratanaprapin, Weerapong; Ratanarat, Ranistha; Naorungroj, Thummaporn; Wattanawinitchai, Patchrapa; Siripoon, Tanaya; Duangdee, Chatnapa; Techarang, Tachpon",Am. j. trop. med. hyg,195,16

The COVID-19 outbreak has highlighted that hospital preparedness for biological events, such as a pandemic, are often inadequate and dependent on leadership investment in biopreparedness. This article discusses the proactive decision, before COVID-19, that a Phoenix-based hospital system made to invest in high-consequence disease (HCD) preparedness. Within these efforts, a gap analysis was performed, which led to creation of an HCD subcommittee and corresponding efforts to address vulnerabilities and opportunities for improvement. From establishing enhanced personal protective equipment (PPE) and infectious disease training for frontline staff, to building an outbreak tracking mechanism for travel alerts within the electronic medical record, the HCD efforts of this hospital system created a stronger foundation to respond to biological events like the COVID-19 pandemic.","Popescu, Saskia; Leach, Rebecca; Robinson, Krystal",Disaster Med Public Health Prep,195,24

The Robert Hollman Foundation decided not to interrupt its service to all the visually impaired children and initiated a Distance Support Project. It was an online process covering all aspects of support for the children and involving audio-video calls, videos and tailored-made multisensory material created specifically for each child. A questionnaire, carried out after the 5-month project duration, was created to collect feedback from parents and professionals to understand the impact this project had on everyone involved. Overall both parents and professionals indicated high levels of satisfaction, but in a significant number of questions parents reported consistently higher levels of satisfaction (p-value <0.001). It was shown that parents felt reassured at this otherwise very difficult time because their children were able to continue their treatment, even if in a very different way. This fact encourages us to consider enriching our existing programmes of support and care, integrating this online approach when necessary. At the same time, it seems clear that the responses of the professionals indicate their belief that the benefits of the traditional ways of working remain of unquestionable importance for children with sight deprivation.","Battistin, Tiziana; Mercuriali, Elena; Zanardo, Vincenzo; Gregori, Dario; Lorenzoni, Giulia; Nasato, Laura; Reffo, Maria Eleonora",Res Dev Disabil,195,16

With Germany's lockdown as one of the more severe governmentally imposed epidemic-control-decisions, we tested to what extent the frequency of outdoor cycling activities changed from March to June 2020. METHODS: User behaviour and frequency in 15 urban and 7 rural German public green spaces was quantified using cycling data from the fitness application Strava. Changes in cycling activities were analysed with four different generalised linear models, correcting for factors like weather conditions and temporal changes in the user base of the fitness application. RESULTS: We found a clear increase in outdoor cycling sport activities in urban public green spaces in response to epidemic-control decisions (e.g. increase by 81% in April relative to the expected value (95% CI [48%, 110%])). In contrast, biking in rural areas showed no significant change with epidemic-control-decisions in place. CONCLUSION: Fitness App data, e.g. from Strava, can be used to monitor visitor behaviour and frequency. The increase in outdoor cycling activities during epidemic control decisions likely reflects a shift of sport activities from indoor and team sports to outdoor and individual sports. This highlights the importance of accessible green space for maintaining physical fitness and health. Beyond this shift, it is likely that outdoor activities may be of particularly importance for stress relief in times of crisis such as the current COVID-19 pandemic.","Schweizer, Anne-Maria; Leiderer, Anna; Mitterwallner, Veronika; Walentowitz, Anna; Mathes, Gregor Hans; Steinbauer, Manuel Jonas",PLoS One,195,16

Knee osteoarthritis is considered to be a chronic disease that affects the joints by causing pain, joint stiffness and decreased functional capacity. Regular physical activity can keep and increase functional capacity, it can reduce pain by improving movement behavior. The disruption of the sedentary behavior of the elderly patients with knee osteoarthritis can lead to improved physical function and general health. The purpose of this paper is to point out the role of physical activity in the elderly people diagnosed with knee osteoarthritis during the COVID-19 pandemic. Material and method. A total of 155 patients diagnosed (clinical and imaging) with knee ostoarthritis, who were treated on an outpatient basis, from May to September 2020, were studied. The parameters assessed in the study were pain, joint stiffness, the ability to carry out daily activities, anxiety and quality of life. Results and discussion.The studied group of patients was homogeneous in terms of the weight by age group and gender. Higher values were recorded in the study group in the evaluation of patients based on scales, the results being statistically significant, with value for p&lt;0.05, which means that the hypothesis was validated. Conclusions. Patients of the study group recorded improvementin of functional capacity, joint stability and static and dynamic balance, which allowed a faster reintegration into the family and society.","Silisteanu, S.

Children are susceptible to infection, and some studies reported that they actively transmit the virus even when asymptomatic, thus affecting the community. Methods to easily test infected children and track the virus they carry are in demand. OBJECTIVETo determine if saliva is an effective sample for detecting SARS-CoV-2 RNA and antibodies in children aged 10 years and under, and associate viral RNA levels to infectivity. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTSIn this cross-sectional study, saliva SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR tests, with and without RNA extraction, were validated in 49 hospitalized adults. The test was then applied to 85 children, aged 10 years and under, admitted to the hospital regardless of COVID-19 symptomatology. Amongst 85 children, 29 (63.0%) presented at least one COVID-19 symptom, 46 (54.1%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection, 28 (32.9%) were under the age of 1 and the mean (SD) age was 3.8 (3.4) years. Saliva samples were collected up to 48 h after a positive test by nasopharyngeal (NP) swab-RT-qPCR. EXPOSUREInfection by SARS-COV-2 in adults up to 8 days post-symptom onset. Children admitted to hospital for any reason and therefore with unclear onset of SARS-CoV-2 infection. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURESSaliva RT-qPCR up to CT<37 accurately identifies SARS-CoV-2 infected children, with viral infectivity in tissue culture restricted to CT<26. RESULTSIn adults, the accuracy of the saliva SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR test was 98.0% (95% confidence intervals [CI]: 89.3%-100%) as compared to NP-RT-qPCR. In children, the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of saliva-RT-qPCR tests compared to NP swab-RT-qPCR were, respectively, 84.8% (71.8%-92.4%), 100% (91.0%-100%), and 91.8% (84.0%- 96.6%) with RNA extraction and 81.8% (68.0%-90.5%), 100% (91.0%-100%), and 90.4% (82.1%-95.0%) without RNA extraction. The threshold for rescuing infectious particles from saliva was CT<26. There were significant IgM positive responses to the spike protein and its receptor-binding domain (RBD) among children positive for SARS-CoV-2 by NP swab and negative by saliva compared to other groups, indicating late infection onset (>7-10 days). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCESaliva-molecular testing is suitable in children aged 10 years and under, including infants aged <1 year, even bypassing RNA extraction methods. Importantly, the detected viral RNA levels were significantly above the infectivity threshold in several samples. Further investigation is required to understand how SARS-CoV-2 RNA levels correlate with viral transmission. Key PointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSIs saliva reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) testing (with and without RNA extraction) suitable to identify SARS-CoV-2 infected young children and can the cycle threshold (CT) be associated with infectivity in a heterogeneous population admitted to hospital for COVID-19-related and unrelated reasonsa FindingsIn this cross-sectional study of 85 children aged 10 years and under, RT-qPCR in saliva samples subjected or not to RNA extraction accurately detected SARS-CoV-2 RNA and infectious viruses could be recovered from CTs below 26. MeaningSaliva sampling coupled to RT-qPCR and specific antibody detection efficiently identifies infants and children infected with SARS-CoV-2. This approach is suitable for surveillance in kindergarten and school settings.","Alenquer, Marta; Silva, Tiago Milheiro; Akpogheneta, Onome; Ferreira, Filipe; Vale-Costa, Silvia; Medina-Lopes, Monica; Batista, Frederico; Garcia, Ana Margarida; Barreto, Vasco M; Paulino, Cathy; Costa, Joao; Sobral, Joao; Diniz-da-Costa, Maria; Ladeiro, Susana; Alves, Jose Delgado; Leite, Ricardo B; Demengeot, Jocelyne; Brito, Maria Joao Rocha; Amorim, Maria Joao",,195,1

Control of the spread of COVID-19 in emergency situations across the world is a challenge and therefore the aim of this study is to propose a q-linear Diophantine fuzzy decision-making model for the control and diagnose COVID19. Basically, the paper includes three main parts for the achievement of appropriate and accurate measures to address the situation of emergency decision-making. First, we propose a novel generalization of Pythagorean fuzzy set, q-rung orthopair fuzzy set and linear Diophantine fuzzy set, called q-linear Diophantine fuzzy set (q-LDFS) and also discussed their important properties. In addition, aggregation operators play an effective role in aggregating uncertainty in decision-making problems. Therefore, algebraic norms based on certain operating laws for q-LDFSs are established. In the second part of the paper, we propose series of averaging and geometric aggregation operators based on defined operating laws under q-LDFS. The final part of the paper consists of two ranking algorithms based on proposed aggregation operators to address the emergency situation of COVID-19 under q-linear Diophantine fuzzy information. In addition, the numerical case study of the novel carnivorous (COVID-19) situation is provided as an application for emergency decision-making based on the proposed algorithms. Results explore the effectiveness of our proposed methodologies and provide accurate emergency measures to address the global uncertainty of COVID-19.","Almagrabi, Alaa O; Abdullah, Saleem; Shams, Maria; Al-Otaibi, Yasser D; Ashraf, Shahzaib",J Ambient Intell Humaniz Comput,195,29

Few large studies on this issue have been conducted and most of them have been performed as part of penicillin hypersensitivity studies. OBJECTIVE: We described our 26-year experience exploring cephalosporin drug hypersensitivity, from which we identified epidemiological and cross-reactivity data. METHODS: We included 476 patients who reported Drug Hypersensitivity Reaction (DHR) to cephalosporin and underwent an allergy workup between January 1992 and July 2018 in the Allergy Unit of the University Hospital of Montpellier (France). According to their structural side chain R1 homology we worked with four classes of cephalosporins. Logistic regression analysis was used to search for risk factors for hypersensitivity to cephalosporin (positive skin test or provocation test results). RESULTS: Cephalosporin hypersensitivity was proven in 22.3% of the patients referred in our Unit, according to positive ST (51.9%) or DPT to the culprit drug (48.1%). One in five patients were children and cephalosporin hypersensitivity was confirmed in 15% (47.6% of them by means of ST). In the cephalosporin hypersensitive population, initial reactions were mostly immediate (68.9%) and anaphylactic (72.7%). Cross-reactivity with aminopenicillins was the most frequent pattern of cross-reactivity. In multivariate analysis, immediate reactions (OR=3 (95%CI [1.6-5.5]), p<0.001)), anaphylactic shock (OR=6.5 (95%CI [3.3-13.1], p<0.001)) and anaphylaxis (OR=3.1 (95%CI [1.6-6.1], p<0.001)) and multiple reactions to the same or several cephalosporins (OR=2.0 (95% CI [1-3.5], p=0.04)) were statistically associated with confirmed DHR. DPT was generally safe, but elicited anaphylaxis in 20% of patients. Systemic reactions during skin testing occurred in 9.1% of positive patients, almost always related to anaphylactic index reactions. Non-immediate confirmed DHR to cephalosporins were rare and occurred in less than 10% of the positive patients. CONCLUSION: Almost a quarter of the tested patients were confirmed as hypersensitive to cephalosporins; sensitivity of skin testing was 51.9%, thus, half of the positive patients needed a DPT in order to prove the diagnosis.","Touati, Nidhal; Cardoso, Barbara; Delpuech, Marie; Bazire, Raphaelle; El Kara, Nathalie; Ouali, Djamila; Demoly, Pascal; Anca-Mirela, C H I R I A C",J.

Therapeutic knowledge and drug mechanism play a crucial role in determining the strategy and defining the estimand for clinical trial designs. Clinical trials in patients with hematological malignancies often present unique challenges for trial design due to complexity of treatment options and existence of potential curative but highly risky procedures, e.g. stem cell transplant or treatment sequence across different phases (induction, consolidation, maintenance). Here, we illustrate how to apply the estimand framework in hematological clinical trials and how the estimand framework can address potential difficulties in trial result interpretation. This paper is a result of a cross-industry collaboration to connect the International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) E9 addendum concepts to applications. Three randomized phase 3 trials will be used to consider common challenges including intercurrent events in hematologic oncology trials to illustrate different scientific questions and the consequences of the estimand choice for trial design, data collection, analysis, and interpretation. Template language for describing estimand in both study protocols and statistical analysis plans is suggested for statisticians' reference.","Sun, Steven; Weber, Hans-Jochen; Butler, Emily; Rufibach, Kaspar; Roychoudhury, Satrajit",,195,2

Teachers always judge students attentiveness in class by their facial expressions which shows their interest in the class. But when we look at present, due to COVID-19, students are learning totally on online platform. During these classes, teachers can see students only through their video cameras and it is difficult to know level of understanding of students, therefore they can be judged by their various emotions such as happy, sad, disinterested, frustration, neutral, confusion, anger, disgust, surprise and learning. It becomes compulsory for educators to identify the state of mind of students during online class by their emotion recognition. This paper presents a review for different facial expressions, body parts and gestures through which identification can be done. With the help of Computer vision and deep learning techniques this is identified by tool in which student's image is captured by video camera and further applying feature extraction and classification techniques. This results in benefitting to both students and faculty for easy execution of online classes. Implementation results shows that emotions recognized through image classification can make better learning outcomes for students. © 2021 Bharati Vidyapeeth, New Delhi.

However, in cases of upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB), priority should be given to an early endoscopy. OBJECTIVE: The main objective was to compare the time since arrival at the hospital and the performance of the endoscopy between both groups. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective study. Data contains information of patients who attended to the hospital with UGIB and underwent an endoscopy between October 19th, 2019 and June 6th, 2020. Patients were divided into 2 phases: pre-pandemic and pandemic. The time between arrival at the hospital and the performance of the endoscopy in both phases were compared as well as other indicators such hospital stay and in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: With information from 219 patients, the median age was 69 years. 154 and 65 endoscopies were performed in pre-pandemic and pandemic phase, respectively. The time between arrival at the hospital and the performance of the endoscopy was significantly longer during the pandemic (10.00 vs. 13.08 hours, p-value = 0.019). Nevertheless, there were no significant differences in hospital stay or mortality. CONCLUSION: The management of patients with UGIB during the COVID-19 pandemic is complex and requires the application of clinical judgment to decide the best timing to perform an endoscopy without affecting patient care.","Benites-Goñi, Harold; Pascacio-Fiori, Martín; Monge-Del Valle, Fiorella; Plácido-Damián, Zuly; Gonzales-Carazas, Evelyn; Padilla-Espinoza, Miguel; Prado-Bustamante, José; Llatas-Pérez, Juan; Dávalos-Moscol, Milagros",Rev Gastroenterol Peru,195,16

Clinical teams at Hackensack Meridian Health (HMH) needed resources for identifying and assimilating the medical literature regarding COVID-19, which was expanding and evolving daily. HMH leaders reached out to HMSOM leaders for assistance. The HMSOM leadership and faculty quickly organized a literature review elective. APPROACH: Eight second-year medical students participated in a literature review elective course to research and synthesize the COVID-19 clinical literature to provide synopses of best practices for various clinical teams. By March 23, students were searching the literature and writing reports independently, mentored by a senior dean (an infectious diseases specialist) and supported by the associate dean of libraries and library team. The library team updated and categorized student reports daily on a website dedicated to the elective. OUTCOMES: During the 6-week elective, 8 students produced 70 reports synthesizing the emerging COVID-19 literature to help answer practitioners' clinical questions in real time. One student report was posted on the American Academy of Ophthalmology website. All 70 were published online in Elsevier's health education faculty hub. On course evaluations, students expressed regret about not being directly involved in patient care, but articulated their gratitude to be able to contribute to the clinical teams. NEXT STEPS: In June 2020, the students returned to their clinical clerkships as COVID-19 clinical volumes declined and PPE became more available. Students continued to be available to the clinical teams to assist with COVID-19 questions. This literature review elective can serve as a model for other medical schools to use to deploy students to help synthesize the evolving literature on COVID-19 or other rapidly emerging research topics.","Boscamp, Jeffrey R; Duffy, Christopher P; Barsky, Carol; Stanton, Bonita F",Acad. med,195,6

During the COVID-19 pandemic, patients may delay emergency care due to stay-at-home orders and concern of COVID-19 exposure. OBJECTIVE: To assess whether emergency presentation for testicular torsion was delayed during the COVID-19 pandemic, and whether the rate of orchiectomy increased compared to a retrospective period. STUDY DESIGN: Patients were prospectively enrolled in a multicenter study from seven institutions in the United States and Canada. Inclusion criteria were patients two months to 18 years of age with acute testicular torsion from March through July 2020. The retrospective group included patients from January 2019 through February 2020. Statistical analysis was performed using Kruskal-Wallis tests, Chi-square tests, and logistic regression. RESULTS: A total of 221 patients were included: 84 patients in the COVID-19 cohort and 137 in the retrospective cohort. Median times from symptom onset to emergency department presentation during COVID-19 compared to the retrospective period were 17.9 h (IQR 5.5-48.0) and 7.5 h (IQR 4.0-28.0) respectively (p = 0.04).

This viral disease, which is reported to originate from a seafood market where wild animals are illegally sold, has been transmitted among humans worldwide through close contact. Given the growing number of infected people worldwide and the disastrous consequences in all aspects of life, COVID-19 is a serious public health issue that requires special attention. In some countries, the epidemic curve of infection which was in the plateau phase or decreasing phase during the lockdown period increases day by day since the reopening, indicating the second phase of contamination. Therefore, the preventive measures recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) must be respected to stop the spread of the disease. The international crisis due to the COVID-19 pandemic negatively affects many sectors, including animal production and its related industries. Indeed, with the cessation of imports and exports between countries, it is not possible to provide feeds that are considered as basic raw materials in livestock raising. This situation impairs animal movements, decreases production inputs availability, and negatively affects the economy. The sustainability of animal production is also affected by a shortage of workers due to the lockdown/curfew, the strong decrease in the purchasing power of the consumer, and the intensification of health care tasks. To prevent contamination of animal products and the spread of the disease with food, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends frequent disinfection of food and human contact surfaces at production sites using an appropriate antiseptic. The purpose of this review article is to describe the current status of COVID-19 and investigate its effects on animal production. We propose potential approaches to keep animal products processing units and staff safe from SARS-CoV-2 infection and some strategies to improve animal production quantity and economy.","Defo Deeh, Patrick Brice; Kayri, Veysi; Orhan, Cemal; Sahin, Kazim",Front Vet Sci,195,12

Within a few days, COVID-19 became a pandemic disease. This review aimed to investigate the possible implications of COVID-19 for human reproductive systems, as in previous studies ACE2 was highly expressed in some organs of these systems, such as the testicles. A total of 41 publications were found in the specialized databases and, after selection, 7 articles were used to build this study. Our results showed that the fever caused by COVID-19 has a negative effect on spermatogenesis, there is high expression of ACE2 in the testicles and in the uterine tubes and there is a higher level of transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2), which is also responsible for the entry of the virus into the cell. Moreover, it was noted that there was viral genetic material in the semen and an increase in the serum concentration of luteinizing hormone (LH) in men and women, which could cause hypogonadism. Thus, we conclude that there is the possibility of infection and malfunction in the reproductive organs as well as the plausibility of sexual transmission of this disease.

Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust provides 1412 inpatient beds staffed by 1200 junior doctors and faced a large burden of COVID-19 admissions. LOCAL PROBLEM: A survey of doctors revealed only 20% felt confident that they would know to whom they could raise concerns and that most were getting information from a combination of informal work discussions, trust emails, social media and medical literature. METHODS: This quality improvement project was undertaken aligning with Standards for Quality Improvement Reporting Excellence 2.0 guidelines. Through an iterative process, a digital network (Imperial Covid cOmmunications Network; ICON) using existing smartphone technologies was developed. Concerns were collated from the junior body and conveyed to the leadership team (vertical-bottom-up using Google Form) and responses were conveyed from leadership to the junior body (vertical-top-down using WhatsApp and Zoom). Quantitative analysis on engagement with the network (members of the group and number of issues raised) and qualitative assessment (thematic analysis on issues) were undertaken. RESULTS: Membership of the ICON WhatsApp group peaked at 780 on 17 May 2020. 197 concerns were recorded via the Google Form system between 20 March and 14 June 2020. There were five overarching themes: organisational and logistics; clinical strategy concerns; staff safety and well-being; clinical (COVID-19) and patient care; and facilities. 94.4% of members agreed ICON was helpful in receiving updates and 88.9% agreed ICON improved collaboration. CONCLUSIONS: This work demonstrates that a coordinated network using existing smartphone technologies and a novel communications structure can improve collaboration between senior leadership and junior doctors.

Interestingly, Vitamin D deficiency has been often associated with altered immune responses and infections. In the present study, we evaluated Vitamin D plasma levels in patients affected with different lung involvement during COVID-19 infection. METHODS: Lymphocyte phenotypes were assessed by flow cytometry. Thoracic CT scan involvement was obtained by an image analysis program. RESULTS: Vitamin D levels were deficient in (80%) of patients, insufficient in (6.5%) and normal in (13.5%). Patients with very low Vitamin D plasma levels had more elevated D-Dimer values, a more elevated B lymphocyte cell count, a reduction of CD8 + T lymphocytes with a low CD4/CD8 ratio, more compromised clinical findings (measured by LIPI and SOFA scores) and thoracic CT scan involvement. CONCLUSIONS: Vitamin D deficiency is associated with compromised inflammatory responses and higher pulmonary involvement in COVID-19 affected patients.

DESIGN: Repeated cross-sectional survey. Between July 17 and September 10, 2020, mother-child pairs who were enrolled in a population-based survey in 2017 were re-contacted by telephone for consent and to complete a telephonic COVID-19 survey. We used the Brazilian Food Insecurity Scale to assess food security and the Self Reporting Questionnaire (SRQ-20) to assess maternal mental disorders. McNemar's test for paired data that also accounted for clustering was used. Logistic regression was used to assess the relationship of unemployment and receipt of government assistance with food insecurity and MMD in 2020. SETTING: Ceará, Brazil. PARTICIPANTS: 577 mother-child pairs who completed the 2017 and 2020 surveys. At the time of the 2020 interview, the child cohort was 36-108 months of age. RESULTS: The proportion of mothers reporting food insecurity was 15.5% higher (95% CI: (5.9 - 25.1), p-value < 0.001) during the pandemic in July-August 2020 as compared to November 2017, while the prevalence of MMD was 40.2% higher during the pandemic (95% CI: 32.6 - 47.8, p-value < 0.001). Loss of formal employment was associated with increased risk of food insecurity, but not with the risk of MMD. CONCLUSIONS: The risk of food insecurity and MMD in Ceará increased during the COVID-19 pandemic.

We here report the crystal structure of the aggregation-prone region of Staphylococcus aureus Bap which adopts a dumbbell-shaped fold. The middle module (MM) connecting the N-terminal and C-terminal lobes consists of a tandem of novel double-Ca2+ -binding motifs involved in cooperative interaction networks, which undergoes Ca2+ -dependent order-disorder conformational switches. The N-terminal lobe is sufficient to mediate amyloid aggregation through liquid-liquid phase separation and maturation, and subsequent biofilm formation under acidic conditions. Such processes are promoted by disordered MM at low [Ca2+ ] but inhibited by ordered MM stabilized by Ca2+ binding, with inhibition efficiency depending on structural integrity of the interaction networks. These studies illustrate a novel protein switch in pathogenic bacteria and provide insights into the mechanistic understanding of Bap proteins in modulation of functional amyloid and biofilm formation, which could be implemented in the anti-biofilm drug design.","Ma, Junfeng; Cheng, Xiang; Xu, Zhonghe; Zhang, Yikan; Valle, Jaione; Fan, Shilong; Zuo, Xiaobing; Lasa, Iñigo; Fang, Xianyang",EMBO J,195,26

METHODS: A total of 132 patients with confirmed COVID-19 who were admitted to a designated COVID-19 hospital in Wuhan, China from January 18, 2020 to February 26, 2020 were collected. The dynamic changes of blood SAA, CRP, PCT, WBC, Lymphocyte (L), PLT, CT imaging, and disease progression were studied. All patients completed at least twice laboratory data collection and clinical condition assessment at three time points indicated for this study; The length of hospital stay was longer than 14 days prior to February 26, 2020. RESULTS: COVID-19 patients had significantly increased SAA and CRP levels, while L count decreased, and PCT, WBC, and PLT were in the normal range. As disease progressed from mild to critically severe, SAA and CRP gradually increased, while L decreased, and PLT, WBC, and PCT had no significant changes; ROC curve analysis suggests that SAA/L, CRP, SAA, and L count are valuable in evaluating the severity of COVID-19 and distinguishing critically ill patients from mild ones; Patients with SAA consistently trending down during the course of disease have better prognosis, compared with the patients with SAA continuously rising; The initial SAA level is positively correlated with the dynamic changes of the serial CT scans. Patient with higher initial SAA level are more likely to have poor CT imaging. CONCLUSIONS: SAA and L are sensitive indicators in evaluating the severity and prognosis of COVID-19. Monitoring dynamic changes of SAA, combined with CT imaging could be valuable in diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19.","Li, Huan; Xiang, Xiaochen; Ren, Hongwei; Xu, Lingli; Zhao, Lisha; Chen, Xiaoqiong; Long, Hui; Wang, Qiang; Wu, Qingming",J Infect,195,16

Midseason, transmission was observed in persons who had cumulative interactions of <15 minutes' duration, leading to a revised definition of high-risk contacts that required consideration of mask use, setting and room ventilation in addition to proximity and duration of interaction. The NFL also developed an intensive protocol that imposed stricter infection prevention precautions when a case was identified at an NFL club. The intensive protocol effectively prevented the occurrence of high-risk interactions, with no high-risk contacts identified for 71% of traced cases at clubs under the intensive protocol. The incorporation of the nature and location of the interaction, including mask use, indoor versus outdoor setting, and ventilation, in addition to proximity and duration, likely improved identification of exposed persons at higher risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection.

METHODS: We performed a systematic review of Medline and Embase to identify publications that described at least one patient with COVID-19 who had altered olfactory/gustatory function and had CSF testing performed. The search ranged from December 1, 2019 to November 18, 2020. RESULTS: We identified 51 publications that described 70 patients who met inclusion criteria. Of 51 patients who had CSF SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing, 3 (6%) patients had positive results and 1 (2%) patient had indeterminate results. Cycle threshold (Ct; the number of amplification cycles required for the target gene to exceed the threshold, which is inversely related to viral load) was not provided for the patients with a positive PCR. The patient with indeterminate results had a Ct of 37 initially, then no evidence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA on repeat testing. Of 6 patients who had CSF SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing, 3 (50%) were positive. Testing to distinguish intrathecal antibody synthesis from transudation of antibodies to the CSF via breakdown of the blood-brain barrier was performed in 1/3 (33%) patients; this demonstrated antibody transmission to the CSF via transudation. CONCLUSION: Detection of SARS-CoV-2 in CSF via PCR or evaluation for intrathecal antibody synthesis appears to be rare in patients with altered olfactory/gustatory function.

Besides, diabetic patients are more prone to various infectious diseases as well as COVID-19 sporadic infection which are highly risk for diabetes mellitus patients. To combat this infections and comorbid situations, an integrated balanced nutritional supportive could help in maintaining sound health and increase immunity for prevention and management of such type of viral infections. OBJECTIVES: While information regarding nutritional supports in COVID-19 pandemic in diabetic patients are not available, this review aimed to accumulate the evidence from previous publications where studied about nutrition-based supports or interventions for viral diseases with special emphasis on respiratory infections. METHODS: For reviewing, searches are done for getting journal articles into Google Scholar, Pub Med/Medline, Database of Open Access Journal and Science Direct for relevant data and information. RESULTS: Integrated nutritional supports of both macronutrients and micronutrients guidelines including home-based physical exercise schedule is summarizes in this comprehensive review for possible prevention and management of diabetic patients in COVID-19 infections. The immune boosting benefits of some vitamins, trace elements, nutraceuticals and probiotics in viral infections of diabetic patients are also included.

Methods: ARIMA modeling was used to compute 6-month-ahead forecasts of rates for common assault, serious assault, sexual offenses, and breaches of domestic violence orders. These forecasts (and their 95% confidence intervals) are compared to the observed data for March and April 2020. Results: By the end of April, 2020, rates of common, serious, and sexual assault had declined to their lowest level in a number of years. For serious assault and sexual assault, the decline was beyond statistical expectations. The rate at which domestic violence orders were breached remained unchanged. Conclusions: Social distancing regulations are temporally correlated with reductions in some violent crimes. Social distancing is likely to have significantly limited interpersonal interaction, especially in locations and at times when violence is usually prevalent.","Payne, Jason L; Morgan, Anthony; Piquero, Alex R",J Exp Criminol,195,22

The aim of this study was to explore potential inequalities in care pathways for people with young-onset and late on-set dementia (YOD/LOD), including their family carers, with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) occurring throughout the course of the study and enabling a comparison between pre-pandemic and COVID-19 times. METHODS: People with YOD and LOD with their family carers were recruited via local support groups in the North West Coast region of England. Semi-structured interviews explored the experiences of people with YOD and LOD and family carers on their access to both health and social care services and community-based services. Transcripts were coded by two researchers and analysed using thematic analysis. Fifteen interviews were conducted with seven people with YOD or LOD and 14 family carers between January and March 2020. Some interviews were conducted only with the person with dementia, because they did not have a family carer, and others were conducted only with the family carer, because the person with dementia was in the severe stages of the condition. RESULTS: Four themes emerged from the interviews: (1) Getting the ball rolling: the process of diagnosis; (2) Balancing the support needs of people with dementia and carers; (3) Barriers to accessing support; and (4) Facilitators to accessing support. Inequities existed for both YOD and LOD, with emerging evidence of unequal experiences in accessing care at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. DISCUSSION: People with YOD and LOD and their carers require better support in accessing services after a diagnosis. Greater understanding of the pathways through which inequalities materialise are needed, especially those that might have been disrupted or exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic.","Giebel, Clarissa; Sutcliffe, Caroline; Darlington-Pollock, Frances; Green, Mark A; Akpan, Asan; Dickinson, Julie; Watson, James; Gabbay, Mark",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),195,20

This study was performed to estimate the number of COVID-19 deaths and population-level exposure per province using seasonal all-cause mortality data. METHODS: Time-series data were collected from the National Organization for Civil Registration on the seasonal all-cause mortality from spring 2015 to summer 2020 (from March 21, 2015 to September 21, 2020), in accordance with the Solar Hijri (SH) calendar, to estimate the expected number of seasonal deaths for each province using a piecewise linear regression model. A population-weighted infection fatality ratio was then applied to estimate the level of exposure per province during this period. RESULTS: From the start of winter to the end of summer (from December 22, 2019 to September 21, 2020), there were a total of 58 900 (95% confidence interval 46 900-69 500) excess deaths across all 31 provinces, with 27% (95% confidence interval 20-34%) estimated nationwide exposure to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). In particular, Qom and Golestan were among the hardest-hit provinces, with nearly 57% exposure, while another 27 provinces showed significant levels of excess mortality in at least one season with >20% population-level exposure to the virus. Unexpectedly high levels of excess mortality were also detected during fall 2019 (from September 23 to December 21, 2019) across 18 provinces, unrelated and prior to the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Quite appropriately, the pandemic has been declared a non-traditional security (NTS) threat in many countries in Europe and Asia. Beyond its detrimental effect on public health, COVID-19 is testing the international resolve to cooperate and represents a particularly tricky challenge to regionalism. Due to the nature of pandemics, regional pandemic management is imperative. However, the two most successful regional organisations, the European Union (EU) and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), have not been able to match the resolve of their individual member states, and there is a substantial gap between timely and robust national pandemic management and inadequacy at the regional level. This is a paradox that merits further investigation. To what extent and why diverged early national and early regional responses to COVID-19? This article identifies a causal relationship between robust national pandemic management as a result of early securitisation and ensuing paralysis on regional level, a process which I call the 'selffulfilling prophecy of realism'-a vicious cycle of national self-help responses paralysing regional cooperation. This article contributes early to the impact of COVID-19 on regionalism by analysing EU and ASEAN pandemic management efforts, investigating what has hindered or facilitated successful regional cooperation and identifying room for meaningful interregionalism.","Kliem, Frederick",Asia Eur J,195,2

Whether the use of disinfectants affect the results of viral nucleic acid amplification is unknown. We examined the impact of different hypochlorous acid (HOCl) concentrations on the quantitative results of SARS-CoV-2 by real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). We also explored the mechanisms and models of action of chlorine-containing disinfectants that affected the detection of SARS-CoV-2. The results showed that different HOCl concentrations and different action times had an impact on the SARS-CoV-2 results. High concentrations of ambient HOCl have a greater impact than low concentrations, and this effect will increase with the extension of the action time and with the increase in ambient humidity. Compared with the enzymes or the extracted RNA required for RT-PCR, the impact of HOCl on the SARS-CoV-2 detection is more likely to be caused by damage to primers and probes in the PCR system. The false negative result still existed after changing the ambient disinfectant to ethanol but not peracetic acid. The use of HOCl in the environment will have an unpredictable impact on the nucleic acid test results of SARS-CoV-2. In order to reduce the possibility of false negative of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid test and prevent the spread of epidemic disease, environmental disinfectants should be used at the beginning and end of the experiment rather than during the experimental operation.","Duan, Xiuzhi; Wang, Xuchu; Xie, Yiyi; Yu, Pan; Zhuang, Tingting; Zhang, Yingzhi; Fang, Liuyu; Ping, Ying; Liu, Weiwei; Tao, Zhihua",Electrophoresis,195,16

The primary outcome measure was willingness to use immunity certificates across three different domestic settings (1. Visiting the GP for a non urgent health issue, 2. Dining in a restaurant, and 2. Attending a performance in a theatre). For each setting two options, one prioritising convenience (option A) and the other privacy (option B), were offered. Our secondary outcome measures were computed indices from items adapted from the Health Belief Model, Attitudes towards sharing immunity status with service providers, Prior to COVID- 19 lifestyle. In addition, we recorded data about respondents socio- demographic characteristics. Respondents were more willing to use immunity certificates that prioritised convenience, rather than privacy, when visiting their GP (92%). However, privacy was more favourable (84%) in the other two settings (dining in a restaurant and going to a theatre) compared to convenience (39%). Personal beliefs about COVID-19 and immunity certificates were associated with variations in willingness to use these across all scenarios. No variations were observed across socio-demographics and lifestyle. The findings of this survey suggest that there is not one size fits all solution for designing immunity certificates. Immunity certificates are complex socio-technical systems, any attempt to implement these for domestic use should be tailored to different settings and user needs. The design of certification services requires a more evidence-based approach and further research is needed to understand how different settings, design elements (like convenience or privacy) and personal beliefs about the pandemic should inform their design.","Niculaescu, Corina-Elena; Sassoon, Isabel; Avila, Irma Cecilia-Landa; Colak, Ozlem; Jun, Gyuchan Thomas; Balatsoukas, Panagiotis",,195,17

In many cases these patients will require mechanical ventilation; but in others the severity of disease is significantly less and may not need invasive support. High flow nasal cannula (HFNC) is a widely used modality of delivering high concentrations of oxygen and airflow to patients with hypoxemic respiratory failure, but its use in patients with SARS-CoV-2 is poorly described. Concerns with use of HFNC have arisen including aerosolization of viral particles to healthcare workers (HCW) to delaying intubation and potentially worsening of outcomes. However, use of HFNC in other coronavirus pandemics and previous experimental evidence suggest HFNC is low risk and may be effective in select patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. With the significant increase in resource utilization in care of patients with SARS-CoV-2, identification of those that may benefit from HFNC allowing allocation of ventilators to those more critically ill is of significant importance. In this manuscript, we review pertinent literature regarding the use of HFNC in the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and address many concerns regarding its use.","Suffredini, Dante A; Allison, Michael G",J Intensive Care Med,195,20

METHODS: All patients with PCR-positive SARS-CoV-2 admitted from February to April 2020 were divided into: i) imported cases, ii) locally-transmitted cases outside migrant worker dormitories and iii) migrant worker dormitory cases, and were examined for underlying comorbidities, clinical progress and outcomes. RESULTS: Imported cases (n = 29) peaked in mid-March 2020, followed by local cases (n = 100) in mid-April 2020; migrant worker cases (n = 425) continued to increase in late April 2020. Migrant worker cases were younger, with few medical comorbidities, and had less severe disease. As the migrant worker cases increased, the proportion of patients with pneumonia decreased, whilst patients presenting earlier in their illness and asymptomatic disease became more common. CONCLUSION: Singapore experienced a substantial shift in the population at risk of severe COVID-19. Successful control in the community protected an aging population. Large migrant worker dormitory outbreaks occurred, but the disease incurred was less severe, resulting in Singapore having one of the lowest case fatality rates in the world.","Ngiam, Jinghao Nicholas; Chew, Nicholas; Tham, Sai Meng; Beh, Darius Lian-Lian; Lim, Zhen Yu; Li, Tony Y W; Cen, Shuyun; Tambyah, Paul Anantharajah; Santosa, Amelia; Sia, Ching-Hui; Cross, Gail Brenda",Int. j. infect. dis,195,1

We adapt the principle idea of regularization from linear regression to covariance estimation in a continuous-time high-frequency setting. We show that under a nuclear norm penalization, the PRV is computed by soft-thresholding the eigenvalues of realized variance (RV). It therefore encourages sparsity of singular values or, equivalently, low rank of the solution. We prove our estimator is minimax optimal up to a logarithmic factor. We derive a concentration inequality, which reveals that the rank of PRV is -- with a high probability -- the number of non-negligible eigenvalues of the QV. Moreover, we also provide the associated non-asymptotic analysis for the spot variance. We suggest an intuitive data-driven bootstrap procedure to select the shrinkage parameter. Our theory is supplemented by a simulation study and an empirical application. The PRV detects about three-five factors in the equity market, with a notable rank decrease during times of distress in financial markets. This is consistent with most standard asset pricing models, where a limited amount of systematic factors driving the cross-section of stock returns are perturbed by idiosyncratic errors, rendering the QV -- and also RV -- of full rank.","Christensen, Kim; Nielsen, Mikkel Slot; Podolskij, Mark",,195,1

However, there are few antiviral drugs that can effectively treat these infections. The standard approach in the development of antiviral drugs involves the identification of a unique viral target, followed by the design of an agent that addresses that target. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) represent a novel source of potential antiviral drugs. AMPs have been shown to inactivate numerous different enveloped viruses through the disruption of their viral envelopes. However, the clinical development of AMPs as antimicrobial therapeutics has been hampered by a number of factors, especially their enzymatically labile structure as peptides. We have examined the antiviral potential of peptoid mimics of AMPs (sequence-specific N-substituted glycine oligomers). These peptoids have the distinct advantage of being insensitive to proteases, and also exhibit increased bioavailability and stability. Our results demonstrate that several peptoids exhibit potent in vitro antiviral activity against both HSV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 when incubated prior to infection. In other words, they have a direct effect on the viral structure, which appears to render the viral particles non-infective. Visualization by cryo-EM shows viral envelope disruption similar to what has been observed with AMP activity against other viruses. Furthermore, we observed no cytotoxicity against primary cultures of oral epithelial cells. These results suggest a common or biomimetic mechanism, possibly due to the differences between the phospholipid head group makeup of viral envelopes and host cell membranes, thus underscoring the potential of this class of molecules as safe and effective broad-spectrum antiviral agents. We discuss how and why differing molecular features between 10 peptoid candidates may affect both antiviral activity and selectivity.","Diamond, Gill; Molchanova, Natalia; Herlan, Claudine; Fortkort, John A; Lin, Jennifer S; Figgins, Erika; Bopp, Nathen; Ryan, Lisa K; Chung, Donghoon; Adcock, Robert Scott; Sherman, Michael; Barron, Annelise E",,195,14

Viral infections may predispose pregnant women to a higher rate of pregnancy complications, including preterm births, miscarriage, and stillbirth. Despite reports of neonatal COVID-19, definitive proof of vertical transmission is still lacking. In this review, we summarize studies regarding the potential evidence for transplacental transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), characterize the expression of its receptors and proteases, describe the placental pathology and analyze virus-host interactions at the maternal-fetal interface. We focus on the syncytium, the barrier between mother and fetus, and describe in detail its physical and structural defense against viral infections. We further discuss the potential molecular mechanisms, whereby the placenta serves as a defense front against pathogens by regulating the interferon type III signaling, microRNA-triggered autophagy and the nuclear factor-&#954;B pathway. Based on these data, we conclude that vertical transmission may occur but rare, ascribed to the potent physical barrier, the fine-regulated placental immune defense and modulation strategies. Particularly, immunomodulatory mechanisms employed by the placenta may mitigate violent immune response, maybe soften cytokine storm tightly associated with severely ill COVID-19 patients, possibly minimizing cell and tissue damages, and potentially reducing SARS-CoV-2 transmission.","Kreis, Nina-Naomi; Ritter, Andreas; Louwen, Frank; Yuan, Juping",,195,24

This paper focuses on how to enhance target identification in a Boltzmann ensemble of structures via chemical probing data. We employ an information-theoretic approach to solve the problem, via considering a variant of the R\'{e}nyi-Ulam game. Our framework is centered around the ensemble tree, a hierarchical bi-partition of the input ensemble, that is constructed by recursively querying about whether or not a base pair of maximum information entropy is contained in the target. These queries are answered via relating local with global probing data, employing the modularity in RNA secondary structures. We present that leaves of the tree are comprised of sub-samples exhibiting a distinguished structure with high probability. In particular, for a Boltzmann ensemble incorporating probing data, which is well established in the literature, the probability of our framework correctly identifying the target in the leaf is greater than $90\%$.","Li, Thomas J.

Furthermore, minority communities are more likely to experience living and working conditions that predispose them to worse outcomes.

Primary AI (PAI) is rare and is caused by direct adrenal failure. Secondary AI (SAI) is more frequent and is caused by diseases affecting the pituitary, whereas in tertiary AI (TAI), the hypothalamus is affected. The most prevalent form is TAI owing to exogenous glucocorticoid use. Symptoms of AI are non-specific, often overlooked or misdiagnosed, and are related to the lack of cortisol, adrenal androgen precursors and aldosterone (especially in PAI). Diagnosis is based on measurement of the adrenal corticosteroid hormones, their regulatory peptide hormones and stimulation tests. The goal of therapy is to establish a hormone replacement regimen that closely mimics the physiological diurnal cortisol secretion pattern, tailored to the patient's daily needs. This Primer provides insights into the epidemiology, mechanisms and management of AI during pregnancy as well as challenges of long-term management. In addition, the importance of identifying life-threatening adrenal emergencies (acute AI and adrenal crisis) is highlighted and strategies for prevention, which include patient education, glucocorticoid emergency cards and injection kits, are described.","Hahner, Stefanie; Ross, Richard J; Arlt, Wiebke; Bancos, Irina; Burger-Stritt, Stephanie; Torpy, David J; Husebye, Eystein S; Quinkler, Marcus",Nat Rev Dis Primers,195,17

Several SARS-CoV-2 strains have been identified. Genetic variation is fundamental to virus evolution and, in response to selection pressure, is manifested as the emergence of new strains and species adapted to different hosts or with novel pathogenicity. The combination of variation and selection forms a genetic footprint on the genome, consisting of the preferential accumulation of mutations in particular areas. Properties of betacoronaviruses contributing to variation and the emergence of new strains and species are beginning to be elucidated. To better understand their variation, we profiled the accumulation of mutations in all species in the genus Betacoronavirus, including SARS-CoV-2 and two other species that infect humans: SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Variation profiles identified both genetically stable and variable areas at homologous locations across species within the genus Betacoronavirus. The S glycoprotein is the most variable part of the genome and is structurally disordered. Other variable parts include proteins 3 and 7 and ORF8, which participate in replication and suppression of antiviral defense. In contrast, replication proteins in ORF1b are the least variable. Collectively, our results show that variation and structural disorder in the S glycoprotein is a general feature of all members of the genus Betacoronavirus, including SARS-CoV-2. These findings highlight the potential for the continual emergence of new species and strains with novel biological properties and indicate that the S glycoprotein has a critical role in host adaptation. IMPORTANCE Natural infection with SARS-CoV-2 and vaccines triggers the formation of antibodies against the S glycoprotein, which are detected by antibody-based diagnostic tests. Our analysis showed that variation in the S glycoprotein is a general feature of all species in the genus Betacoronavirus, including three species that infect humans: SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, and MERS-CoV. The variable nature of the S glycoprotein provides an explanation for the emergence of SARS-CoV-2, the differentiation of SARS-CoV-2 into strains, and the probability of SARS-CoV-2 repeated infections in people. Variation of the S glycoprotein also has important implications for the reliability of SARS-CoV-2 antibody-based diagnostic tests and the design and deployment of vaccines and antiviral drugs. These findings indicate that adjustments to vaccine design and deployment and to antibody-based diagnostic tests are necessary to account for S glycoprotein variation.","LaTourrette, Katherine; Holste, Natalie M; Rodriguez-Peña, Rosalba; Leme, Raquel Arruda; Garcia-Ruiz, Hernan",J Virol,195,5

Safe, effective vaccines are needed to protect this population, facilitate in-person learning and socialization, and contribute to herd immunity. METHODS: In this ongoing multinational, placebo-controlled, observer-blinded trial, we randomly assigned participants in a 1:1 ratio to receive two injections, 21 days apart, of 30 µg of BNT162b2 or placebo. Noninferiority of the immune response to BNT162b2 in 12-to-15-year-old participants as compared with that in 16-to-25-year-old participants was an immunogenicity objective. Safety (reactogenicity and adverse events) and efficacy against confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19; onset, &#8805;7 days after dose 2) in the 12-to-15-year-old cohort were assessed. RESULTS: Overall, 2260 adolescents 12 to 15 years of age received injections; 1131 received BNT162b2, and 1129 received placebo. As has been found in other age groups, BNT162b2 had a favorable safety and side-effect profile, with mainly transient mild-to-moderate reactogenicity (predominantly injection-site pain [in 79 to 86% of participants], fatigue [in 60 to 66%], and headache [in 55 to 65%]); there were no vaccine-related serious adverse events and few overall severe adverse events. The geometric mean ratio of SARS-CoV-2 50% neutralizing titers after dose 2 in 12-to-15-year-old participants relative to 16-to-25-year-old participants was 1.76 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.47 to 2.10), which met the noninferiority criterion of a lower boundary of the two-sided 95% confidence interval greater than 0.67 and indicated a greater response in the 12-to-15-year-old cohort. Among participants without evidence of previous SARS-CoV-2 infection, no Covid-19 cases with an onset of 7 or more days after dose 2 were noted among BNT162b2 recipients, and 16 cases occurred among placebo recipients. The observed vaccine efficacy was 100% (95% CI, 75.3 to 100). CONCLUSIONS: The BNT162b2 vaccine in 12-to-15-year-old recipients had a favorable safety profile, produced a greater immune response than in young adults, and was highly effective against Covid-19.

We compared the volume of procedures performed in April 2020 (the strict lockdown month) to the corresponding period of prior year (April 2019) and to volumes performed prior to the lockdown in January-February 2020. There was a 64% decline in CA and PCI volumes in April 2020 compared to April 2019. Comparing number of procedures performed in April 2020 to those in January-February 2020, there was 59% decline in CA and a 60% decline in PCI volumes. Following partial lifting of lockdown in May-June 2020, procedural volumes increased gradually. Conclusion: Strict COVID-19-related lockdown in Jordan was associated with drastic declines in cardiac catheterization procedural volumes.","Alhaddad, I.

It follows the philosophy of combining the advantages of model-based and data-driven approaches within compact, insightful, and mathematically well-founded models with improved performance. We explore trained results of scale-adaptive weighting and contrast parameters to obtain an explicit modelling by smooth functions. This leads to a transparent model with only three parameters, without significantly decreasing its denoising performance. Experiments demonstrate that it outperforms its diffusion-based predecessors.

Several infection control strategies have been implemented. Evidence shows that universal masking can mitigate COVID-19 infection, though existing research is limited by secular trend bias. AIMS: To investigate the effect of hospital universal masking on COVID-19 incidence among HCWs compared to the general population. METHODS: We compared the 7-day average incidence rates between a Massachusetts (USA) healthcare system and Massachusetts residents statewide. The study period was from 17 March (the date of first incident case in the healthcare system) to 6 May (the date Massachusetts implemented public masking). The healthcare system implemented universal masking on 26 March, we allotted a 5-day lag for effect onset and peak COVID-19 incidence in Massachusetts was 20 April. Thus, we categorized 17-31 March as the pre-intervention phase, 1-20 April the intervention phase and 21 April to 6 May the epidemic decline phase. Temporal incidence trends (i.e. 7-day average slopes) were compared using standardized coefficients from linear regression models. RESULTS: The standardized coefficients were similar between the healthcare system and the state in both the pre-intervention and epidemic decline phases. During the intervention phase, the healthcare system's epidemic slope became negative (standardized ß: -0.68, 95% CI: -1.06 to -0.31), while Massachusetts' slope remained positive (standardized ß: 0.99, 95% CI: 0.94 to 1.05). CONCLUSIONS: Universal masking was associated with a decreasing COVID-19 incidence trend among HCWs, while the infection rate continued to rise in the surrounding community.","Lan, F-Y; Christophi, C A; Buley, J; Iliaki, E; Bruno-Murtha, L A; Sayah, A J; Kales, S N",Occup Med (Lond),195,1

A qualitative open-ended study was conducted with a heterogeneous sample of 100 Nigerians with an age range of 18-52 years. Participants were members of the general Nigerian population, recruited from social media. Data were analyzed using thematic analysis. Eighty-eight participants were willing to utilize e-therapy services in Nigeria. Their willingness was driven by factors such as their experiences during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, ""perceived comfort in pouring out one's heart to a therapist that is guaranteed in e-therapy,"" and curiosity to explore what e-therapy entails. On the other hand, nine participants were unwilling, and their unwillingness was mostly driven by the perception that the Nigerian environment was disenabling for e-therapy (for instance, poor electricity supply in Nigeria). While three participants were neutral about their willingness. Twelve barriers to utilizing e-therapy services in Nigeria were identified, they were;""poor internet service"", ""high internet service charge"", ""limited communication"", ""lack of trust in the efficacy of e-therapy services"", ""preference for face-to-face therapy"", ""concerns about confidentiality"", ""anticipated stigmatization"", ""technological illiteracy"", ""ignorance of existing e-therapy services in Nigeria"", ""absence of e-therapy services in Nigeria"", ""uncertainty about what to expect from e-therapy service"", and ""perceived distraction during e-therapy session."" While our findings contribute to strengthening the utility of e-therapy services in Nigeria, future studies should replicate the current study with the digitally excluded Nigerian general population.

Early implementation of prone positioning ventilation improves survival in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome, but studies examining the effect of proning on survival in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 are lacking. Our objective was to estimate the effect of early proning initiation on survival in patients with coronavirus disease 2019-associated respiratory failure. DESIGN: Data were derived from the Study of the Treatment and Outcomes in Critically Ill Patients with coronavirus disease 2019, a multicenter cohort study of critically ill adults with coronavirus disease 2019 admitted to 68 U.S. hospitals. Using these data, we emulated a target trial of prone positioning ventilation by categorizing mechanically ventilated hypoxemic (ratio of PaO2 over the corresponding FIO2 &#8804; 200 mm Hg) patients as having been initiated on proning or not within 2 days of ICU admission. We fit an inverse probability-weighted Cox model to estimate the mortality hazard ratio for early proning versus no early proning. Patients were followed until death, hospital discharge, or end of follow-up. SETTING: ICUs at 68 U.S. sites. PATIENTS: Critically ill adults with laboratory-confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 receiving invasive mechanical ventilation with ratio of PaO2 over the corresponding FIO2 less than or equal to 200 mm Hg. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Among 2,338 eligible patients, 702 (30.0%) were proned within the first 2 days of ICU admission. After inverse probability weighting, baseline and severity of illness characteristics were well-balanced between groups. A total of 1,017 (43.5%) of the 2,338 patients were discharged alive, 1,101 (47.1%) died, and 220 (9.4%) were still hospitalized at last follow-up. Patients proned within the first 2 days of ICU admission had a lower adjusted risk of death compared with nonproned patients (hazard ratio, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.73-0.97). CONCLUSIONS: In-hospital mortality was lower in mechanically ventilated hypoxemic patients with coronavirus disease 2019 treated with early proning compared with patients whose treatment did not include early proning.","Mathews, Kusum S; Soh, Howard; Shaefi, Shahzad; Wang, Wei; Bose, Sonali; Coca, Steven; Gupta, Shruti; Hayek, Salim S; Srivastava, Anand; Brenner, Samantha K; Radbel, Jared; Green, Adam; Sutherland, Anne; Leonberg-Yoo, Amanda; Shehata, Alexandre; Schenck, Edward J; Short, Samuel A P; Hernán, Miguel A; Chan, Lili; Leaf, David E",Crit. care med,195,24

METHODS: We describe a clinical case of TN during COVID-19 and we discuss the differential diagnosis and the potential pathogenic mechanism according to the literature. RESULTS: A 65-year-old man with general malaise and typical respiratory symptoms of COVID-19, who presented with paroxysmal lancinating pain in the right V1 trigeminal territory without other neurological symptoms. General blood test and neuroimaging study were normal. A rapid test showed positive IgG and IgM serologies for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The patient was diagnosed with TN secondary to a viral infection by SARS-CoV-2. Facial pain resolved with the improvement of COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: The new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is a possible etiology of secondary TN. Nevertheless, more studies are needed to elucidate the neuropathology of this viral infection.","Molina-Gil, Javier; González-Fernández, Lucía; García-Cabo, Carmen",Headache,195,16

A stepwise frontal analysis (SFA) method was developed based on frontal analysis (FA). A high expression alpha 1A adrenergic receptor (&#945;1A AR) cell membrane chromatography (CMC) method was then developed and combined with SFA to investigate the affinity of three model &#945;1A AR-binding drugs towards &#945;1A AR. Equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) values for drug-receptor interactions were determined by FA and SFA; results showed that these methods were highly consistent. The results demonstrate that the CMC/SFA method is a time-saving and less wasteful method than traditional method for the evaluation of drug-receptor binding characteristics, and could be used to study the interactions between drugs and membrane receptors.","He, Xiaoshuang; Sui, Yue; Wang, Sicen",J Chromatogr B Analyt Technol Biomed Life Sci,195,1

MATERIAL AND METHODS The records of 1206 eligible patients were reviewed. Age groups were divided according to their quarantine status. We recorded the reasons for patient presentation to the ED, the average number of patients in age groups according to quarantine days, and the problems reported by patients who presented to the ED according to quarantine days. RESULTS We enrolled 3016 of 3123 patients. The mean age was 36.4±17.3 years in 2019 and 37.8±16.4 years during the pandemic period (P=0.031). While 73.1% of the ED presentations were due to ocular trauma in 2019, it decreased to 70.7% in 2020. The proportion of those who presented to the ED during the weekend was 30.6% in 2019, but decreased to 23.9% in 2020 (<0.001). While 84.8% of trauma patients were ages 19-64 years in 2019, this rate increased to 88.9% during the pandemic (P=0.067). Non-trauma emergencies were more common than trauma emergencies in both periods in those over the age of 65 years. During the pandemic period, admissions to the ED were decreased in the quarantined age groups (P=0.001). CONCLUSIONS The changes in the number and characteristic of admissions for ophthalmic emergencies during the pandemic period may help planning allocation of healthcare personnel and resources in outpatient and emergency clinics.","Akova, Berna; Kivanç, Sertaç Argun",Med Sci Monit,195,11

Furthermore, we hypothesize that early treatment with hydroxychloroquine sulphate is associated with more rapid resolve of clinical symptoms as assessed by the National Early Warning Score 2 (NEWS2), decreased admission rate to intensive care units and mortality, and improvement in protein biomarker profiles (C-reactive protein, markers of renal and hepatic injury, and established cardiac biomarkers like cardiac troponin and B-type natriuretic peptide). TRIAL DESIGN: The study is a two-arm, open label, pragmatic randomised controlled group sequential adaptive trial designed to assess the effect on viral loads and clinical outcome of hydroxychloroquine sulphate therapy in addition to standard care compared to standard care alone in patients with established Covid-19. By utilizing resources already paid for by the hospitals (physicians and nurses in daily clinical practice), this pragmatic trial can include a larger number of patients over a short period of time and at a lower cost than studies utilizing traditional randomized controlled trial designs with an external study organization. The pragmatic approach will enable swift initiation of randomisation and allocation to treatment. PARTICIPANTS: Patients will be recruited from all inpatients at Akershus University Hospital, Lørenskog, Norway. Electronic real-time surveillance of laboratory reports from the Department of Microbiology will be examined regularly for SARS-CoV-2 positive subjects. All of the following conditions must apply to the prospective patient at screening prior to inclusion: (1) Hospitalisation; (2) Adults 18 years or older; (3) Moderately severe Covid-19 disease (NEWS2 of 6 or less); (4) SARS-CoV-2 positive nasopharyngeal swab; (5) Expected time of hospitalisation > 48 hours; and (6) Signed informed consent must be obtained and documented according to Good Clinical Practice guidelines of the International Conference on Harmonization, and national/local regulations. Patients will be excluded from participation in the study if they meet any of the following criteria: (1) Requiring intensive care unit admission at screening; (2) History of psoriasis; (3) Known adverse reaction to hydroxychloroquine sulphate; (4) Pregnancy; or (5) Prolonged corrected QT interval (>450 ms). Clinical data, including standard hospital biochemistry, medical therapy, vital signs, NEWS2, and microbiology results (including blood culture results and reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction [RT-PCR] for other upper airway viruses), will be automatically extracted from the hospital electronic records and merged with the study specific database. INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: Included patients will be randomised in a 1:1 ratio to (1) standard care with the addition of 400 mg hydroxychloroquine sulphate (PlaquenilTM) twice daily for seven days or (2) standard care alone. MAIN OUTCOMES: The primary endpoint of the study is the rate of decline in SARS-CoV-2 viral load in oropharyngeal samples as assessed by RT-PCR in samples collected at baseline, 48 and 96 hours after randomization and administration of drug for the intervention arm. Secondary endpoints include change in NEWS2 at 96 hours after randomisation, admission to intensive care unit, mortality (in-hospital, and at 30 and 90 days), duration of hospital admission, clinical status on a 7-point ordinal scale 14 days after randomization ([1] Death [2] Hospitalised, on invasive mechanical ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation [3] Hospitalised, on non-invasive ventilation or high flow oxygen devices [4] Hospitalized, requiring supplemental oxygen [5] Hospitalised, not requiring supplemental oxygen [6] Not hospitalized, but unable to resume normal activities [7] Not hospitalised, with resumption of normal activities), and improvement in protein biomarker profiles (C-reactive protein, markers of renal and hepatic injury, and established cardiac biomarkers like cardiac troponin and B-type natriuretic peptide) at 96 hours after randomization. RANDOMISATION: Eligible patients will be allocated in a 1:1 ratio, using a computer randomisation procedure. The allocation sequence has been prepared by an independent statistician. BLINDING (MASKING): Open label randomised controlled pragmatic trial without blinding, no active or placebo control. The virologist assessing viral load in the oropharyngeal samples and the statistician responsible for analysis of the data will be blinded to the treatment allocation for the statistical analyses. NUMBERS TO BE RANDOMIZED (SAMPLE SIZE): This is a group sequential adaptive trial where analyses are planned after 51, 101, 151 and 202 completed patients, with a maximum sample size of 202 patients (101 patients allocated to intervention and standard care and 101 patients allocated to standard care alone).

The focus was mainly on high-quality studies and on patient flow and safety of health workers during outpatient and elective surgery practices. The scattered information and limited number of literature in the above-mentioned sites, the information and personal experiences obtained from the studies were presented as a strategic algorithm. In the covid-19 crisis, there is a serious elective surgery burden, as elective surgery operations in both the outpatient clinic and the operating room have abruptly ceased. Since it is not possible to remove this load at once, a phased start scenario needs to be planned. The exact timing depends largely on factors beyond our control. Once the restrictions are terminated, clinical and surgical volume will gradually increase. Therefore, it will be necessary to prioritize cases by categorizing them.","Kamer, Erdinc; Çolak, Tahsin",Turk. J. Colorectal Dis,195,24

A major question during the last decades has centred on understanding whether new advances in developmental biology are compatible with the standard view or whether they compel a new theory. Here, I argue that the answer to this question depends on which concept of morphogenesis is held. Morphogenesis can be conceived as (1) a chemically driven or (2) a mechanically driven process. According to the first option, genetic regulatory networks drive morphogenesis. According to the second, morphogenesis results from an invariant tendency of embryonic tissues to restore changes in mechanical stress. While chemically driven morphogenesis allows an extension of the standard view, mechanically driven morphogenesis would deeply transform it. Which of these hypotheses has wider explanatory power is unknown. At present, the problem of biological form remains unsolved.","Linde-Medina, Marta",,195,17

Here, one-dimensional cobalt selenide (CoSe2) NMs with different vacancies were synthesized through the same precursor while calcined at different temperatures (P-CoSe2 which calcined at 200 °C and N-CoSe2 which calcined at 230 °C). According to the positron annihilation spectrum, the VSeSe vacancy associate in P-CoSe2 was endowed with two positive charges, while the VCoCoCoSeSe vacancy associate in N-CoSe2 possessed four negative charges. Cell viability assays revealed that N-CoSe2 had higher toxicity to macrophages than P-CoSe2, which was attributed to higher levels of intracellular reactive oxygen species induced by N-CoSe2. Further investigation showed that N-CoSe2 had higher affinity to the mitochondrion-targeting peptide, leading to its preferential distribution in the mitochondria and consequent induction of mitochondrial superoxide production. In contrast, P-CoSe2 exhibited higher affinity to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-targeting peptide, facilitating its preferential distribution in the ER and the nuclei and causing higher damage to both organelles as compared to N-CoSe2. These results demonstrated that type of surface vacancies significantly affected biodistribution of NMs in subcellular organelles, which contributed to differential biological behaviors of the NMs.","Wu, Guizhu; Chen, Xue; Zhang, Ze; Zhu, Nali; Yu, Qilin; Liu, Huajie; Liu, Lu",Nanotoxicology,195,16

The study aimed to screen the most useful predictive factor for critical illness caused by COVID-19. METHODS: The study prospectively involved 61 patients with COVID-19 infection as a derivation cohort, and 54 patients as a validation cohort. The predictive factor for critical illness was selected using LASSO regression analysis. A nomogram based on non-specific laboratory indicators was built to predict the probability of critical illness. RESULTS: The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) was identified as an independent risk factor for critical illness in patients with COVID-19 infection. The NLR had an area under receiver operating characteristic of 0.849 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.707 to 0.991) in the derivation cohort and 0.867 (95% CI 0.747 to 0.944) in the validation cohort, the calibration curves fitted well, and the decision and clinical impact curves showed that the NLR had high standardized net benefit. In addition, the incidence of critical illness was 9.1% (1/11) for patients aged &#8805; 50 and having an NLR < 3.13, and 50% (7/14) patients with age &#8805; 50 and NLR &#8805; 3.13 were predicted to develop critical illness. Based on the risk stratification of NLR according to age, this study has developed a COVID-19 pneumonia management process. CONCLUSIONS: We found that NLR is a predictive factor for early-stage prediction of patients infected with COVID-19 who are likely to develop critical illness.

Understanding the mechanisms underlying the link between obesity and disease severity as a result of SARS-CoV-2 infection is crucial for the development of new therapeutic interventions and preventive measures in this high-risk group. We propose that multiple features of obesity contribute to the prevalence of severe COVID-19 and complications. First, viral entry can be facilitated by the upregulation of viral entry receptors, like angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), among others. Second, obesity-induced chronic inflammation and disruptions of insulin and leptin signaling can result in impaired viral clearance and a disproportionate or hyper-inflammatory response, which together with elevated ferritin levels can be a direct cause for ARDS and cytokine storm. Third, the negative consequences of obesity on blood coagulation can contribute to the progression of thrombus formation and hemorrhage. In this review we first summarize clinical findings on the relationship between obesity and COVID-19 disease severity and then further discuss potential mechanisms that could explain the risk for major complications in patients suffering from obesity.","Demeulemeester, Fien; de Punder, Karin; van Heijningen, Marloes; van Doesburg, Femke",,195,21

Our goal is to find a fair allocation - one that is simultaneously Pareto-efficient and envy-free. When all utilities are known upfront, the above desiderata are simultaneously achievable (and efficiently computable) for a large class of utility functions. In a sequential setting, however, no policy can guarantee these desiderata simultaneously for all possible utility realizations. A natural online fair allocation objective is to minimize the deviation of each agent's final allocation from their fair allocation in hindsight. This translates into simultaneous guarantees for both Pareto-efficiency and envy-freeness. However, the resulting dynamic program has state-space which is exponential in the number of agents. We propose a simple policy, HopeOnline, that instead aims to `match' the ex-post fair allocation vector using the current available resources and `predicted' histogram of future utilities. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our policy compared to other heurstics on a dataset inspired by mobile food-bank allocations.","Sinclair, Sean R.; Jain, Gauri; Banerjee, Siddhartha; Yu, Christina Lee",,195,3

Through this overview, it is evident there is great potential for asynchronous email interviews in the broad field of health, particularly for studies drawing on expertise from participants in academia or professional settings, those across varied geographical settings (i.e. potential for global public health research), and/or in circumstances when face-to-face interactions are not possible (e.g. COVID-19). RESULTS: Benefits of asynchronous email interviewing and additional considerations for researchers are discussed around: (i) access transcending geographic location and during restricted face-to-face communications; (ii) feasibility and cost; (iii) sampling and inclusion of diverse participants; (iv) facilitating snowball sampling and increased transparency; (v) data collection with working professionals; (vi) anonymity; (vii) verification of participants; (viii) data quality and enhanced data accuracy; and (ix) overcoming language barriers. Similarly, potential drawbacks of asynchronous email interviews are also discussed with suggested remedies, which centre around: (i) time; (ii) participant verification and confidentiality; (iii) technology and sampling concerns; (iv) data quality and availability; and (v) need for enhanced clarity and precision.","Amri, Michelle; Angelakis, Christina; Logan, Dilani",BMC Res Notes,195,22

Objective: The aim of this study was to characterize possible histological changes induced by PRP and ADSC therapies in photoaged skin. Methods: A prospective randomized study involving 20 healthy individuals, showing skin aging. They underwent two therapeutic protocols (protocol 1: PRP; protocol 2: ADSCs). Biopsies were obtained before and after treatment (4 months). Results: PRP protocol showed unwanted changes in the reticular dermis, mainly due to the deposition of a horizontal layer of collagen (fibrosis) and elastic fibers tightly linked. Structural analyses revealed infiltration of mononuclear cells and depot of fibrotic material in the reticular dermis. The ADSC protocol leads to neoelastogenesis with increase of tropoelastin and fibrillin. There was an improvement of solar elastosis inducing an increment of macrophage polarization and matrix proteinases. These last effects are probably related to the increase of elastinolysis and the remodeling of the dermis. Conclusions: The PRP promoted an inflammatory process with an increase of reticular dermis thickness with a fibrotic aspect. On the other hand, ADSC therapy is a promising modality with an important antiaging effect on photoaged human skin.","Charles-de-Sá, Luiz; Gontijo-de-Amorim, Natale; Sbarbati, Andrea; Benati, Donatella; Bernardi, Paolo; Borojevic, Radovan; Carias, Rosana Bizon Vieira; Rigotti, Gino",Stem Cells Int,195,26

A way to handle such spreads is through a containment strategy, where the population in the affected area is isolated until the spread has been stopped. Under such circumstances, it is important to monitor whether the mutated virus is extinct via massive testing for the virus sub-type. If successful, the strategy will lead to lower and lower numbers of the sub-type, and it will eventually die out. An important question is, for how long time one should wait to be sure the sub-type is extinct? We use a hidden Markov model for infection spread and an approximation of a two stage sampling scheme to infer the probability of extinction. The potential of the method is illustrated via a simulation study. Finally, the model is used to assess the Danish containment strategy when SARS-CoV-2 spread from mink to man during the summer of 2020, including the Cluster-5 sub-type. In order to avoid further spread and mink being a large animal virus reservoir, this situation led to the isolation of seven municipalities in the Northern part of the country, the culling of the entire Danish 17 million large mink population, and a bill to interim ban Danish mink production until the end of 2021.","Schiøler, Henrik; Knudsen, Torben; Brøndum, Rasmus Froberg; Stoustrup, Jakob; Bøgsted, Martin",,195,1

Worries during pregnancy can affect women's well-being. We investigated worry and well-being and associated factors among pregnant women during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: This descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted on 484 pregnant women using an online questionnaire. Sampling was performed in a period between May 5 and Aug 5, 2020. Inclusion criteria were having a single healthy fetus and having no significant psychological disorder. We collected the data using the Persian versions of the World Health Organization's Well-Being Index (WHO-5 Well-Being Index) and the Cambridge Worry Scale. We used univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses to identify predictors of women's worry and well-being. RESULTS: The mean total scores of the WHO-5 Well-Being Index and the percentage of WHO-5 score < 50 were 64.9 ± 29.0 and 24.4%, respectively. Predictors of women's worry are the increased level of fear of COVID-19 (OR = 6.40, p < 0.001), a low family income (OR = 3.41, p < 0.001), employment status (OR = 1.86, p = 0.019), nulliparity (OR = 1.68, p = 0.024), having a COVID-19 infected person among relatives (OR = 2.45, p = 0.036), having a history of abortion (OR = 1.86, p = 0.012), having participated in the study after the first wave of COVID-19 outbreak (OR = 2.328, p = 0.003), and women's age < 30 year (OR = 2.11, p = 0.002). Predictors of low level of well-being in pregnant women are worry about their own health and relationships (OR = 1.789, p = .017), worry about fetus health (OR = 1.946, p = 0.009), and having at least one infected person with COVID-19 among relatives (OR = 2.135, p = 0.036). CONCLUSIONS: The percentage of women experiencing a low well-being state was relatively high. This result is worthy of attention by health care providers and policy makers.

K18 hACE2 transgenic mice succumbed to SARS-CoV-2 infection by day 6, with virus detected in lung airway epithelium and brain. K18 ACE2 transgenic mice produced a modest TH1/2/17 cytokine storm in the lung and spleen that peaked by day 2, and an extended chemokine storm that was detected in both lungs and brain.

The key embodiment of traditional medicines is the holistic system of approach in the management of human diseases. SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) infection is an ongoing pandemic, which has emerged as the major health threat worldwide and is causing significant stress, morbidity and mortality. Studies from the individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection has shown significant immune dysregulation and cytokine overproduction. Neutrophilia and neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio has been correlated to poor outcome due to the disease. Neutrophils, component of innate immune system, upon stimulation expel DNA along with histones and granular proteins to form extracellular traps (NETs). Although, these DNA lattices possess beneficial activity in trapping and eliminating pathogens, NETs may also cause adverse effects by inducing immunothrombosis and tissue damage in diseases including Type 2 Diabetes and atherosclerosis. Tissues of SARS-CoV-2 infected subjects showed microthrombi with neutrophil-platelet infiltration and serum showed elevated NETs components, suggesting large involvement and uncontrolled activation of neutrophils leading to pathogenesis and associated organ damage. Hence, traditional Ayurvedic herbs exhibiting anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties may act in a manner that might prove beneficial in targeting over-functioning of neutrophils and there by promoting normal immune homeostasis. In the present manuscript, we have reviewed and discussed pathological importance of NETs formation in SARS-CoV-2 infections and discuss how various Ayurvedic herbs can be explored to modulate neutrophil function and inhibit NETs formation in the context of a) anti-microbial activity to enhance neutrophil function, b) immunomodulatory effects to maintain neutrophil mediated immune homeostasis and c) to inhibit NETs mediated thrombosis.","Joshi, Manjunath B; Kamath, Archana; Nair, Aswathy; Yt, Pooja; Sriranjini, Sitaram J; Gangadharan, G G; Satyamoorthy, Kapaettu",,195,21

Arguably, if we had enough previous experience with telemedicine or sufficient preparation for its application, telemedicine could be more smoothly and flexibly adopted in the medical field. As it is still not possible to predict when the COVID-19 pandemic will end, phone consultation and prescription are likely to continue for some time. Hence, it is expected that telemedicine will naturally settle in the medical field in the near future.

The planned roll-out in the UK will involve vaccinating people in high-risk categories with their first dose immediately, and delivering the second dose 12 weeks later. Here, we provide both a further prespecified pooled analysis of trials of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 and exploratory analyses of the impact on immunogenicity and efficacy of extending the interval between priming and booster doses. In addition, we show the immunogenicity and protection afforded by the first dose, before a booster dose has been offered. METHODS: We present data from three single-blind randomised controlled trials-one phase 1/2 study in the UK (COV001), one phase 2/3 study in the UK (COV002), and a phase 3 study in Brazil (COV003)-and one double-blind phase 1/2 study in South Africa (COV005). As previously described, individuals 18 years and older were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive two standard doses of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (5â×â1010 viral particles) or a control vaccine or saline placebo. In the UK trial, a subset of participants received a lower dose (2·2â×â1010 viral particles) of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 for the first dose. The primary outcome was virologically confirmed symptomatic COVID-19 disease, defined as a nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT)-positive swab combined with at least one qualifying symptom (fever &#8805;37·8°C, cough, shortness of breath, or anosmia or ageusia) more than 14 days after the second dose. Secondary efficacy analyses included cases occuring at least 22 days after the first dose. Antibody responses measured by immunoassay and by pseudovirus neutralisation were exploratory outcomes. All cases of COVID-19 with a NAAT-positive swab were adjudicated for inclusion in the analysis by a masked independent endpoint review committee. The primary analysis included all participants who were SARS-CoV-2 N protein seronegative at baseline, had had at least 14 days of follow-up after the second dose, and had no evidence of previous SARS-CoV-2 infection from NAAT swabs. Safety was assessed in all participants who received at least one dose. The four trials are registered at ISRCTN89951424 (COV003) and ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04324606 (COV001), NCT04400838 (COV002), and NCT04444674 (COV005). FINDINGS: Between April 23 and Dec 6, 2020, 24â422 participants were recruited and vaccinated across the four studies, of whom 17â178 were included in the primary analysis (8597 receiving ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 and 8581 receiving control vaccine). The data cutoff for these analyses was Dec 7, 2020. 332 NAAT-positive infections met the primary endpoint of symptomatic infection more than 14 days after the second dose. Overall vaccine efficacy more than 14 days after the second dose was 66·7% (95% CI 57·4-74·0), with 84 (1·0%) cases in the 8597 participants in the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 group and 248 (2·9%) in the 8581 participants in the control group. There were no hospital admissions for COVID-19 in the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 group after the initial 21-day exclusion period, and 15 in the control group. 108 (0·9%) of 12â282 participants in the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 group and 127 (1·1%) of 11â962 participants in the control group had serious adverse events. There were seven deaths considered unrelated to vaccination (two in the ChAdOx1 nCov-19 group and five in the control group), including one COVID-19-related death in one participant in the control group. Exploratory analyses showed that vaccine efficacy after a single standard dose of vaccine from day 22 to day 90 after vaccination was 76·0% (59·3-85·9). Our modelling analysis indicated that protection did not wane during this initial 3-month period. Similarly, antibody levels were maintained during this period with minimal waning by day 90 (geometric mean ratio [GMR] 0·66 [95% CI 0·59-0·74]). In the participants who received two standard doses, after the second dose, efficacy was higher in those with a longer prime-boost interval (vaccine efficacy 81·3% [95% CI 60·3-91·2] at &#8805;12 weeks) than in those with a short interval (vaccine efficacy 55·1% [33·0-69·9] at <6 weeks). These observations are supported by immunogenicity data that showed binding antibody responses more than two-fold higher after an interval of 12 or more weeks compared with an interval of less than 6 weeks in those who were aged 18-55 years (GMR 2·32 [2·01-2·68]). INTERPRETATION: The results of this primary analysis of two doses of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 were consistent with those seen in the interim analysis of the trials and confirm that the vaccine is efficacious, with results varying by dose interval in exploratory analyses. A 3-month dose interval might have advantages over a programme with a short dose interval for roll-out of a pandemic vaccine to protect the largest number of individuals in the population as early as possible when supplies are scarce, while also improving protection after receiving a second dose.

Composite Monte-Carlo (CMC) simulation is a forecasting method which extrapolates available data which are broken down from multiple correlated/casual micro-data sources into many possible future outcomes by drawing random samples from some probability distributions. For instance, the overall trend and propagation of the infested cases in China are influenced by the temporal-spatial data of the nearby cities around the Wuhan city (where the virus is originated from), in terms of the population density, travel mobility, medical resources such as hospital beds and the timeliness of quarantine control in each city etc. Hence a CMC is reliable only up to the closeness of the underlying statistical distribution of a CMC, that is supposed to represent the behaviour of the future events, and the correctness of the composite data relationships. In this paper, a case study of using CMC that is enhanced by deep learning network and fuzzy rule induction for gaining better stochastic insights about the epidemic development is experimented. Instead of applying simplistic and uniform assumptions for a MC which is a common practice, a deep learning-based CMC is used in conjunction of fuzzy rule induction techniques. As a result, decision makers are benefited from a better fitted MC outputs complemented by min-max rules that foretell about the extreme ranges of future possibilities with respect to the epidemic.","Fong, Simon James; Li, Gloria; Dey, Nilanjan; Crespo, Ruben Gonzalez; Herrera-Viedma, Enrique",,195,1

Reverse-transcription real-time PCR (RT-rtPCR) assays based on various segments of SBV have been developed for molecular detection. We developed alternative RT-rtPCR assays for SBV detection to avoid earlier reported mutations and hypervariable regions of the S and M segments of the viral genome. For SYBR Green-based detection of the S segment, the R2 value and efficiency of the developed assay were 0.99 and 99%, respectively. For probe-based S segment detection, 2 assays were developed; the first had an R2 value of 0.99 and 102% efficiency, and the second had a R2 value of 0.98 and 86% efficiency. The probe-based M segment assay had an R2 value of 1.00 and 103% efficiency. Detection limits of the RT-rtPCR assays with new primer sets were 102 and 101 copies/µL for the S and M segments, respectively. Field samples from cattle and sheep were also used for primary validation of the developed assays. Our assays should be suitable for SBV detection in ruminants and for in vitro studies of various SBV strains.","Azkur, Ahmet Kursat; van der Poel, Wim H M; Aksoy, Emel; Hakze-van der Honing, Renate; Yildirim, Murat; Yildiz, Kader",J Vet Diagn Invest,195,16

Its use has expanded for investigation of upper and lower gastrointestinal diseases with similar prototypes. AREAS COVERED: This review covers the role and recent advances of CE, as a non-invasive investigative tool. EXPERT OPINION: The use of upper gastrointestinal CE is useful in patients who require surveillance for varices particularly in the current era of the COVID-19 pandemic. It has also shown high accuracy in the detection of upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage in patients presenting with a suspicion of hemorrhage. Findings on CE help to guide further management by device-assisted enteroscopy. The data on colon CE suggest comparable diagnostic accuracy to colonoscopy for polyp detection; however, more evidence is required in the high-risk group. Crohn's CE has become an integral part of the management of patients with Crohn's disease offering a comparative assessment tool post escalation of therapy. Artificial intelligence within CE has demonstrated similar if not better diagnostic yield compared to the human with a significantly shorter reading time. Artificial intelligence is likely to be in-built within CE reading platforms over the next few years minimizing reporting time and human error.","Chetcuti Zammit, Stefania; Sidhu, Reena",Expert Rev Gastroenterol Hepatol,195,26

The main manifestations of MIS-C (also known as pediatric MIS (PMIS)) in the setting of a severe inflammatory state include fever, diarrhea, shock, and variable presence of rash, conjunctivitis, extremity edema, and mucous membrane changes. In some cases, these symptoms progressed to multi-organ failure. The low percentage of children with asymptomatic cases compared with mild illness and moderate illness could be correlated with the rare cases of MIS-C. One potential explanation for the progression to severe MIS-C disease despite the presence of readily detectable anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies could be due to the potential role of antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE). We reason that the incidence of the ADE phenomenon whereby the pathogen-specific antibodies can promote pathology should be considered in vaccine development against SARS-CoV-2.","Rothan, Hussin A; Byrareddy, Siddappa N",Pediatr. allergy immunol,195,29

Since then, there has been a reorganization of health services, changing the normal approach for the different cases of public health. Excess deaths recorded without a COVID-19 diagnosis are called excess mortality without COVID-19 (EM non-COVID-19). This study aims to estimate the EM non-COVID in the 7-month period after the first registered Covid-19 death. Methods: The following 2 methods were used to estimate the excess mortality in this period: The daily historical average of reported deaths and an adapted auto regressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model, considering the previous 5 years of records until October 16. For this model, after March 16, data was replaced with the daily historical average deaths from the previous 5 years, simulating the closest scenario possible as there was no pandemic. Only deaths from natural causes were selected for these estimations. For EM non-COVID-19 estimation, we subtracted the COVID-19 deaths from the overall excess mortality. Results: Between March 16, 2020, and October 16, 2020, there was an excess of 6,330 deaths from natural causes, i.e., nearly 12% more than expected. Both methods estimated an EM non-COVID-19 of around 66-67% in this period, with a greater relevance in mid-July and mid-September. Conclusions: Excess mortality was present almost every day during the study period. EM non-COVID-19 seemed to vary over time, showing some inadequacy of healthcare services in management of other patients free of COVID-19 in Portugal during periods with a greater patient volume. It is necessary to take care and monitor COVID-19 cases but also non-COVID-19 cases.","Vieira, A.; Ricoca Peixoto, V.; Aguiar, P.; Sousa, P.; Abrantes, A.",Portuguese Journal of Public Health,195,1

MethodsClinical performance of two isothermal amplification-based tests (Atila Biosystems iAMP COVID-19 detection test and OptiGene COVID-19 Direct Plus RT-LAMP test) was compared to clinical RT-PCR assays using different sampling strategies. A total of 1378 participants were tested across four study sites. ResultsCompared to standard of care RT-PCR testing, the overall sensitivity and specificity of the Atila iAMP test for detection of SARS-CoV-2 were 76.2% and 94.9%, respectively, and increased to 88.8% and 89.5%, respectively, after exclusion of an outlier study site. Sensitivity varied based on the anatomic collected site. Sensitivity for nasopharyngeal was 65.4% (range across study sites:52.8%-79.8%), mid-turbinate 88.2%, saliva 55.1% (range across study sites:42.9%-77.8%) and anterior nares 66.7% (range across study sites:63.6%-76.5%).

Though extracorporeal shockwave therapy (ESWT) provides a noninvasive treatment option, controversial subjects still exist about its effectiveness, indications, and mechanism of action. METHODS: An electronic databases search was performed using PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane library to collect clinical trials, case reports, and cases series on this topic and then useful data were extracted and appraised by experienced clinicians. We evaluated the quality of included evidences by using the Oxford Centre for evidence-based medicine (EBM) Levels of Evidence. RESULTS: A total of 17 articles including 2 case reports, 9 open label trials, 2 cohorts, and 6 randomized controlled trials were considered to be eligible for this systematic review. Visual analog scale (VAS), Harris hip scores, and the imaging results were the frequently-used outcome estimates of included studies. CONCLUSION: By systematically analyzing these evidences, we could conclude that ESWT could act as a safe and effective method to improve the motor function and relieve the pain of patients with osteonecrosis of femoral hip, especially those at early stage. Imaging revealed that bone marrow edema was significantly relieved, but the necrotic bone could not be reversed after ESWT. This technique could slow or even block the progression of ONFH and therefore reduce the demand for surgery. Collaboration with other conservative modalities would not improve the curative benefits of ESWT. Meanwhile, ONFH with various risk factors showed similar reaction to this noninvasive treatment method. However, these conclusions should be interpreted carefully for the low-quality of included publications and further studies are requisite to validate the effect of ESWT in ONFH.","Zhang, Qingyu; Liu, Lihua; Sun, Wei; Gao, Fuqiang; Cheng, Liming; Li, Zirong",Medicine (Baltimore),195,2

RESULTS: Lactobacillus casei expressing the major protective antigen VP4 of porcine rotavirus (pPG612.1-VP4) or VP4-LTB (heat-labile toxin B subunit from Echerichia coli) (pPG612.1-VP4-LTB) fusion protein was used to immunize mice orally. The expression of recombinant pPG612.1-VP4 and pPG612.1-VP4-LTB was confirmed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis and surface-displayed expression on L. casei was verified by immunofluorescence. Mice orally immunized with recombinant protein-expressing L. casei produced high levels of serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) and mucosal IgA. The IgA titters from mice immunized with pPG612.1-VP4-LTB were higher than titters from pPG612.1-VP4-immunized mice. The induced antibodies demonstrated neutralizing effects on RV infection. CONCLUSION: These results demonstrated that VP4 administered in the context of an L. casei expression system is an effective method for stimulating mucosal immunity and that LTB served to further stimulate mucosal immunity suggesting that this strategy can be adapted for use in pigs.,"Qiao, Xinyuan; Li, Guiwei; Wang, Xiangqing; Li, Xiaojing; Liu, Min; Li, Yijing",BMC Microbiol,195,1

The drug also affects other kinases, including Src, Flt-3, LCK, LYN. Nintedanib is used in the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, chronic fibrosing interstitial lung diseases and lung cancer. The mechanism of action suggests that nintedanib should be considered one of the potential agents for inhibiting and revising the fibrosis process related to COVID-19 infections. Due to the known induction of coagulation pathways during COVID-19 infections, possible interaction between nintedanib and anticoagulant seems to be an extremely important issue. In theory, nintedanib could increase the bleeding risk, thrombosis and lead to thrombocytopenia. The data from clinical trials on the concomitant use of nintedanib and antithrombotic agents is very limited as this patient group was within the standard exclusion criteria. Nintedanib is an important therapeutic option, despite its interaction with anticoagulants. If anticoagulant therapy is necessary, the more effective and safer option is the concomitant administration of DOACs and nintedanib, especially when drug-monitored therapy will be used in patients at high risk of bleeding complications.","Grześk, Grzegorz; Woźniak-Wiśniewska, Anita; Błażejewski, Jan; Górny, Bartosz; Wołowiec, Łukasz; Rogowicz, Daniel; Nowaczyk, Alicja",Int J Mol Sci,195,11

There has been lack of clarity on the meaning of reported rates of false positives and false negatives. For risk assessment and clinical decision making, the rates of interest are the positive and negative predictive values of a test. Positive predictive value (PPV) is the chance that a person who tests positive has been infected. Negative predictive value (NPV) is the chance that someone who tests negative has not been infected. The medical literature regularly reports different statistics, sensitivity and specificity. Sensitivity is the chance that an infected person receives a positive test result. Specificity is the chance that a non-infected person receives a negative result. Knowledge of sensitivity and specificity permits one to predict the test result given a person's true infection status. These predictions are not directly relevant to risk assessment or clinical decisions, where one knows a test result and wants to predict whether a person has been infected. Given estimates of sensitivity and specificity, PPV and NPV can be derived if one knows the prevalence of the disease, the rate of illness in the population. There is considerable uncertainty about the prevalence of COVID-19. This paper addresses the problem of inference on the PPV and NPV of COVID-19 antibody tests given estimates of sensitivity and specificity and credible bounds on prevalence. I explain the methodological problem, show how to estimate bounds on PPV and NPV, and apply the findings to some tests authorized by the FDA.","Manski, C. F.",,195,20

Design: Prospective evaluation of initial three weeks of a daily Monday to Friday pilot SARS-CoV-2 serology service for patients. Setting: Early post 'first-wave' SARS-CoV-2 transmission period at single centre London teaching hospital that provides care to the local community, as well as regional and national referral pathways for specialist services. Participants: 110 (72 adults, 38 children, age range 0-83 years, 52.7% female (n=58)). Interventions: Patient serum from vetted referrals tested on CE marked and internally validated lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) (SureScreen Diagnostics) detecting antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins, with result and clinical interpretation provided to the direct care team. Main outcome measures: Performance characteristics, source and nature of referrals, feasibility and clinical utility of the service, particularly the benefit for clinical decision-making. Results: The LFIA was deemed suitable for clinical advice and decision making following evaluation with 310 serum samples from SARS-CoV-2 PCR positive patients and 300 pre-pandemic samples, giving a sensitivity and specificity of 96.1% and 99.3% respectively. For the pilot, 115 referrals were received leading to 113 tests performed on 108 participants (sample not available for two participants); paediatrics (n=35), medicine (n=69), surgery (n=2) and general practice (n=2). 43.4% participants (n=49) had detectable antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. There were three main indications for serology; new acute presentations potentially triggered by recent COVID-19 infection e.g. PIMS-TS (n=26) and pulmonary embolism (n=5), potential missed diagnoses in context of a recent compatible illness (n=40), and making infection control and immunosuppression treatment decisions in persistently SARS-CoV-2 RNA PCR positive individuals (n=6). Conclusions: This study shows acceptable performance characteristics, feasibility and clinical utility of a SARS-CoV-2 serology service using a rapid, inexpensive and portable assay for adults and children presenting with a range of clinical indications. Results correlated closely with a confirmatory in-house ELISA. The study showed the benefit of introducing a serology service where there is a reasonable pre-test probability, and the result can be linked with clinical advice or intervention. Experience thus far is that the volume of requests from hospital referral routes are manageable within existing clinical and laboratory services; however, the demand from community referrals has not yet been assessed. Given recent evidence for a rapid decline in antibodies, particularly following mild infection, there is likely a limited window of opportunity to realise the benefit of serology testing for individuals infected during the 'first-wave' before they potentially fall below a measurable threshold. Rapidly expanding availability of serology services for NHS patients will also help understand the long-term implications of serostatus and prior infection in different patient groups, particularly before emergence of any 'second-wave' outbreak or introduction of a vaccination programme.","Sweeney, N.; Merrick, B.; Pickering, S.; Pedro Galao, R.; Botgros, A.; Wilson, H.

This study aims to investigate the effects and mode-of-action of 6-TG on rotavirus replication. Human intestinal Caco2 cell line, 3D model of human primary intestinal organoids, laboratory rotavirus strain (SA11) and patient-derived rotavirus isolates were used. We have demonstrated that 6-TG significantly inhibits rotavirus replication in these intestinal epithelium models. Importantly, gene knockdown or knockout of Rac1, the cellular target of 6-TG, significantly inhibited rotavirus replication, indicating the supportive role of Rac1 for rotavirus infection. We have further demonstrated that 6-TG can effectively inhibit the active form of Rac1 (GTP-Rac1), which essentially mediates the anti-rotavirus effect of 6-TG. Consistently, ectopic over-expression of GTP-Rac1 facilitates but an inactive Rac1 (N17) or a specific Rac1 inhibitor (NSC23766) inhibits rotavirus replication. In conclusion, we have identified 6-TG as an effective inhibitor of rotavirus replication via the inhibition of Rac1 activation. Thus, for transplantation patients or IBD patients infected with rotavirus or at risk of rotavirus infection, the choice of 6-TG as a treatment appears rational.","Yin, Yuebang; Chen, Sunrui; Hakim, Mohamad S.; Wang, Wenshi; Xu, Lei; Dang, Wen; Qu, Changbo; Verhaar, Auke P.; Su, Junhong; Fuhler, Gwenny M.; Peppelenbosch, Maikel P.; Pan, Qiuwei",Antiviral Res,195,16

METHODS: This multicenter, retrospective, observational, cross-sectional study was conducted on 240,474 patients with confirmed COVID-19 in Saudi Arabia. Data was collected retrospectively through the Health Electronic Surveillance Network at the Ministry of Health. Patients were classified based on their outcome as recovered, dead, or active with no definite outcome. We must specify the date period. RESULTS: As of 20th of June 2020, 79.7% of COVID-19 cases were young and middle-aged, ranging between 20–59 years. There was evidently a difference in the sex ratio, where males constituted 71.7% of cases. The majority were non-Saudi nationals, representing 54.7% of cases. Furthermore, the contraction of COVID-19 was travel-related in 45.1% of cases. Signs and symptoms were reported in 63% of cases, the most common of which were fever; 85.2%, and cough; 85%. Deaths occurred more frequently in patients 40−49 years, 50−59 years, and 60−69 years, representing 19.2%, 27.9%, and 21.3% of deaths, respectively. Additionally, the case fatality rate (CFR) was higher in older age-groups, reaching 10.1% in those ≥80 years. Moreover, the CFR of males was higher than that of females, with 0.95% and 0.62%, respectively. As for nationality, Saudis had a CFR of 0.46% versus 1.19% in non-Saudis. CONCLUSION: The total number of positive COVID-19 cases detected constitute 0.7% of the Saudi population to date. Older age, non-Saudi nationalities, being male, travelling outside Saudi Arabia, and the presence of symptoms, as opposed to being asymptomatic were considered risk factors and found to be significantly more associated with death in patients with COVID-19.","Alahmari, Ahmed A.; Khan, Anas A.; Elganainy, Ahmed; Almohammadi, Emad L.; Hakawi, Ahmed M.; Assiri, Abdullah M.; Jokhdar, Hani A.",J Infect Public Health,195,20

This is an encouraging development; however, what constitutes best practice for nonpharmacologic management of low back pain (LBP) is largely unknown. DESIGN: The Improving Veteran Access to Integrated Management of Back Pain (AIM-Back) trial is an embedded pragmatic cluster-randomized trial that will examine the effectiveness of two different care pathways for LBP. Sixteen primary care clinics will be randomized 1:1 to receive training in delivery of 1) an integrated sequenced-care pathway or 2) a coordinated pain navigator pathway.

A subset of veteran participants (n=848) have consented to complete additional surveys at baseline and at 3, 6, and 12 months for supplementary pain and other measures. SUMMARY: AIM-Back care pathways will be tested for effectiveness, and treatment heterogeneity will be investigated to identify which veterans may respond best to a given pathway. Health care utilization patterns (including opioid use) will also be compared between care pathways. Therefore, the AIM-Back trial will provide important information that can inform the future delivery of nonpharmacologic treatment of LBP.","George, Steven Z; Coffman, Cynthia J; Allen, Kelli D; Lentz, Trevor A; Choate, Ashley; Goode, Adam P; Simon, Corey B; Grubber, Janet M; King, Heather; Cook, Chad E; Keefe, Francis J; Ballengee, Lindsay A; Naylor, Jennifer; Brothers, Joseph Leo; Stanwyck, Catherine; Alkon, Aviel; Hastings, Susan N",Pain Med,195,1

Approach: To help health-care workers prioritize treatment for patients with more severe disease and to decrease the burden on health systems caused by COVID-19, the government established a system to classify disease severity. Health-care staff in city- and provincial-level patient management teams classified the patients into the different categories according to the patients' pulse, systolic blood pressure, respiratory rate, body temperature and level of consciousness. Patients categorized as having moderate, severe and very severe disease were promptly assigned to beds or negative-pressure isolation rooms for hospital treatment, while patients with mild symptoms were monitored in 16 designated facilities across the country. Local setting: The case fatality rate was higher in the city of Daegu and the Gyeongsangbuk-do province (1.6%; 124/7756) than the rest of the country (0.5%; 7/1485). Relevant changes: From 25 February to 26 March 2020, the ratio of negative-pressure isolation rooms per COVID-19 patient was below 0.15 in the city of Daegu and the Gyeongsangbuk-do province. In the rest of the country, this ratio decreased from 5.56 to 0.63 during the same period. Before the classification system was in place, eight (15.7%) out of the 51 deaths occurred at home or during transfer from home to health-care institutions.

Method: Three different protocols (pre‐, simultaneous and post‐treatments) were used to verify the effect of addition time of the variables on PV1 replication by crystal violet method and relative viral RNA quantification by real‐time PCR for analysing in which step of virus replication the variables could interfere. Conclusions: Data revealed that the B. dracunculifolia showed the best antiviral activity percentage in the simultaneous treatment, as well as lower relative viral quantification by real‐time PCR. Variables might block partially the viral entry within cells, affect the steps of viral cycle replication into cells, or lead to RNA degradation before the virus entry into cells or after their release to the supernatant. Significance and Impact of the Study: Baccharis dracunculifolia is the most important botanical source of the south‐eastern Brazilian propolis, and its potential for the development of new phytotherapeutic medicines has been investigated. Propolis is commonly used for its antimicrobial and immunomodulatory activities.

Moreover, age-associated kidney failure has been widely accepted. However, efforts to demonstrate aging-dependent renal metabolic rewiring have been limited. In the present study, we investigated aging-related renal metabolic determinants by integrating metabolomic and transcriptomic data sets from kidneys of young (3 months, n = 7 and 3 for respectively) and old (24 months, n = 8 and 3 for respectively) naive C57BL/6 male mice. Metabolite profiling analysis was conducted, followed by data processing via network and pathway analyses, to identify differential metabolites. In the aged group, the levels of glutathione and oxidized glutathione were significantly increased, but the levels of gamma-glutamyl amino acids, amino acids combined with the gamma-glutamyl moiety from glutathione by membrane transpeptidases, and circulating glutathione levels were decreased. In transcriptomic analysis, differential expression of metabolic enzymes is consistent with the hypothesis of aging-dependent rewiring in renal glutathione metabolism; pathway and network analyses further revealed the increased expression of immune-related genes in the aged group. Collectively, our integrative analysis results revealed that defective renal glutathione metabolism is a signature of renal aging.

SARS-CoV-2 is a new strain that has not been previously identified in humans, however there have been previous outbreaks of different versions of the beta coronavirus including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV1) from 2002 to 2003 and the most recent Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) which was first identified in 2012. All of the above have been recognised as major pathogens that are a great threat to public health and global economies. Currently, no specific treatment for SARS-CoV-2 infection has been identified; however, certain drugs have shown apparent efficacy in viral inhibition of the disease. Natural substances such as herbs and mushrooms have previously demonstrated both great antiviral and anti-inflammatory activity. Thus, the possibilities of natural substances as effective treatments against COVID-19 may seem promising. One of the potential candidates against the SARS-CoV-2 virus may be Inonotus obliquus (IO), also known as chaga mushroom. IO commonly grows in Asia, Europe and North America and is widely used as a raw material in various medical conditions.

In this study, we describe the clinical presentation and demographics of eight patients who were coinfected with SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a case series of hospitalized patients admitted to intensive care units (ICUs). We collected demographics, underlying conditions, presenting symptoms and clinical outcome from the patients’ medical records. RESULTS: During the study period from March 14, 2020 to October 19, 2020, there was a total of 67 SARS-CoV-2 ICU admitted patients who underwent simultaneous SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV testing by PCR. Of those patients, 8 (12%) tested positive for both SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV. There were 6 (75%) males, the mean age ± SD was 44.4 ± 11.8 years, and 7 (87.5%) were obese. Of the patients, 7 (87.5%) were non-smokers, 1 (12.5%) had diabetes mellitus, 1 (12.5%) had heart failure, and 1 (12.5%) had been on anti-platelet therapy. The mean hospital length of stay (LOS) was 21.1 ± 11.6 days and the average ICU LOS was 10.9 ± 6.03 days. All patients received supportive therapy and all were treated with corticosteroid.

Presently, the standard molecular testing method (reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, RT-PCR) is restricted to the laboratory, time-consuming, and costly. This increases the turnaround time for getting test results. This study sought to develop a rapid, near-patient saliva-based test for COVID-19 (Saliva-Dry LAMP) with similar accuracy to that of standard RT-PCR tests. A lyophilized dual-target reverse transcription-loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) test with fluorometric detection by the naked eye was developed. The assay relies on dry reagents that are room temperature stable. A device containing a centrifuge, heat block, and blue LED light system was manufactured to reduce the cost of performing the assay. This test has a limit of detection of 1 copy/µL and achieved a positive percent agreement of 100% [95% CI 88.43% to 100.0%] and a negative percent agreement of 96.7% [95% CI 82.78–99.92%] relative to a reference standard test. Saliva-Dry LAMP can be completed in 105 min. Precision, cross-reactivity, and interfering substances analysis met international regulatory standards. The combination of ease of sample collection, dry reagents, visual detection, low capital equipment cost, and excellent analytical sensitivity make Saliva-Dry LAMP particularly useful for resource-limited settings.","Toppings, Noah B.; Mohon, Abu Naser; Lee, Yoonjung; Kumar, Hitendra; Lee, Daniel; Kapoor, Ratik; Singh, Gurmukh; Oberding, Lisa; Abdullah, Omar; Kim, Keekyoung; Berenger, Byron M.; Pillai, Dylan R.",Sci Rep,195,26

We conducted a systematic review of the electronic database (PubMed, Google Scholar, Scopus, Medline, EMBASE, and Cochrane library) using different MeSH terms from November 2019 to June 2020. A total of 39 patients with stroke from 6 studies were included. The mean age of our included patients was 61.4 ± 14.2 years.

In this emergency background, research on the preschool teachers’ technology acceptance provides clues to improve preschool teachers’ intention to use educational technology. The Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) is widely used to examine the process of individuals’ technology acceptance in the previous literature. Therefore, this study seeks to examine preschool teachers’ technology acceptance with the adapted TAM and their determinant factors. The proposed model was empirically validated by using survey data from 1,568 preschool teachers during the COVID-19. Results indicate that preschool teachers’ behavioral intention was moderate to high level. Perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use are direct significant predictors of preschool teachers’ behavioral intention. Perceived usefulness is affected by perceived ease of use and job relevance. Computer self-efficacy and perceptions of external control are the positive factors toward perceived ease of use. Our findings present powerful evidence for the applicability of the adapted TAM in a sample of Chinese preschool teachers under emergency circumstances.

When the virus encounters the host cell, it binds to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, then the S protein of the virus is broken down by the transmembrane protease serine 2 with the help of furin, allowing the virus to enter the cell. The elevated inflammatory cytokines suggest that a cytokine storm, also known as cytokine release syndrome, may play a major role in the pathology of COVID-19. Therefore, the aim of this study is to investigate the relationship between circulating furin levels, disease severity, and inflammation in patients with SARS-CoV-2. A total of 52 SARS-CoV-2 patients and 36 healthy control participants were included in this study. SARS- CoV-2 patients were scored by the disease activity score.

South Asia has become a major epicentre of the COVID-19 pandemic. Understanding South Asians awareness, attitudes and experiences of early measures for the prevention of COVID-19 is key to improving the effectiveness and mitigating the social and economic impacts of pandemic responses at a critical time for the Region. Methods. We assessed the knowledge, behaviours, health and socio-economic circumstances of 29,809 adult men and women, at 93 locations across four South Asian countries. Data were collected during the national lockdowns implemented from March to July 2020, and compared with data collected prior to the pandemic as part of an ongoing prospective surveillance initiative. Results. Participants were 61% female, mean age 45.1 years. Almost half had one or more chronic disease, including diabetes (16%), hypertension (23%) or obesity (16%). Knowledge of the primary COVID-19 symptoms and transmission routes was high, but access to hygiene and personal protection resources was low (running water 63%, hand sanitisers 53%, paper tissues 48%). Key preventive measures were not widely adopted. Knowledge, access to, and uptake of COVID-19 prevention measures were low amongst people from disadvantaged socio-economic groups. Fifteen percent of people receiving treatment for chronic diseases reported loss of access to long-term medications; 40% reported symptoms suggestive of anxiety or depression. The prevalence of unemployment rose from 9.3% to 39.4% (P<0.001), and household income fell by 52% (P<0.001) during the lockdown. Younger people and those from less affluent socio-economic groups were most severely impacted. Sedentary time increased by 32% and inadequate fruit and vegetable intake increased by 10% (P<0.001 for both), while tobacco and alcohol consumption dropped by 41% and 80%, respectively (P<0.001), during the lockdown. Conclusions. Our results identified important knowledge, access and uptake barriers to the prevention of COVID-19 in South Asia, and demonstrated major adverse impacts of the pandemic on chronic disease treatment, mental health, health-related behaviours, employment and household finances. We found important sociodemographic differences for impact, suggesting a widening of existing inequalities. Our findings underscore the need for immediate large-scale action to close gaps in knowledge and access to essential resources for prevention, along with measures to safeguard economic production and mitigate socio-economic impacts on the young and the poor.","Kusuma, D.; Pradeepa, R.; Khawaja, K.

AIM: To determine the effect of MERS-CoV on the immune response in infected patients and investigate cytokine production in the A549 epithelial cell line in response to a recombinant MERS-CoV spike protein (rSP) in the presence or absence of anti-dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) antibody (3 independent experiments). Cytokine levels were measured using a cytokine ELISA array. METHODS: A Bio-Plex multiplex assay and cytokine ELISA were used in our study to measure the cytokine levels. RESULTS: Comparative analysis of MERS-CoV-infected patients (4 samples) and noninfected healthy controls (HCs) (5 samples) showed that serum levels of the following cytokines and chemokines were significantly higher in MERS-CoV patients than in the HCs (*p < 0.05): interferon (IFN)-α2 (43.4 vs 5.4), IFN-β (17.7 vs 6.2), IFN-γ (43.4 vs 9.7), interleukin (IL)-8 (13.7 vs 0), IL-2 (11.2 vs 3), IL-27p28 (57.8 vs 13.8), and IL-35 (167.5 vs 87.5). DISCUSSION: Our results revealed that MERS-CoV infection induced a slight increase in IFN levels but triggered a more pronounced increase in expression of the regulatory cytokines IL-27 and IL-35. A recombinant version of the full-length MERS-CoV spike protein increased the expression of IL-8 (160 pg/mL), IL-2 (100 pg/mL) and IL-12 (65 pg/mL) in A549 lung epithelial cells compared to that in the unstimulated control cells. The presence of anti-DPP4 antibody did not affect cytokine suppression or induction in A549 cells in vitro but decreased the level of IL-8 from 160 pg/mL to 65 pg/mL. CONCLUSION: MERS-CoV can decrease IFN levels to interfere with the IFN pathway and enhance the production of regulatory cytokines. Inhibition of the increases in IL-27 and IL-35 may contribute to halting MERS-CoV in the early stage of infection.","Mubarak, Ayman; Alrfaei, Bahauddeen; Aljurayyan, Abdullah; Alqafil, Mahfoudh M; Farrag, Mohamed A; Hamed, Maaweya E; Alosaimi, Bandar; Almajhdi, Fahad; Alturaiki, Wael",J Inflamm Res,195,1

Comparative analyses of the BYD1 genome with those of three prototype mammalian reovirus strains demonstrated that BYD1 is a novel reassortant virus, with its S1 gene segment coming from a previously unidentified serotype 2 isolate and other nine segments coming from ancestors of homologous T1L and T3D segments, which supports the hypothesis that mammalian reovirus gene segments reassort in nature. Further analyses of the S1 segments of the six isolates showed that all the isolates are novel serotype 2 MRVs based on their S1 gene sequences, which are markedly different from those of all previously reported, and the S1 genes of the four new isolates share more than 99% identity with each other, proving that they diverged from a common ancestor most recently, and the S1 genes of the four new isolates share about 65% identity with those of the two strains isolated in 1982.","Song, Lihua; Zhou, Yusen; He, Jun; Zhu, Hong; Huang, Rutong; Mao, Panyong; Duan, Qing",Virus Genes,195,20

However, GBSs in the setting of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) remains poorly characterized, whilst GBSs prevalence amongst COVID‐19 patients has not been previously systematically evaluated using a meta‐analytical approach. METHODS: A systematic review and meta‐analysis of observational cohort and case series studies reporting on the occurrence, clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients with COVID‐19‐associated GBSs was performed. A random‐effects model was used to calculate pooled estimates and odds ratios (ORs) with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs), compared to non‐COVID‐19, contemporary or historical GBSs patients. RESULTS: Eighteen eligible studies (11 cohorts, seven case series) were identified including a total of 136,746 COVID‐19 patients. Amongst COVID‐19 patients, including hospitalized and non‐hospitalized cases, the pooled GBSs prevalence was 0.15‰ (95% CI 0%–0.49‰; I (2) = 96%). Compared with non‐infected contemporary or historical controls, patients with SARS‐CoV‐2 infection had increased odds for demyelinating GBSs subtypes (OR 3.27, 95% CI 1.32%–8.09%; I (2) = 0%). In SARS‐CoV‐2‐infected patients, olfactory or concomitant cranial nerve involvement was noted in 41.4% (95% CI 3.5%–60.4%; I (2) = 46%) and 42.8% (95% CI 32.8%–53%; I (2) = 0%) of the patients, respectively. Clinical outcomes including in‐hospital mortality were comparable between COVID‐19 GBSs patients and non‐infected contemporary or historical GBSs controls. CONCLUSION: GBSs prevalence was estimated at 15 cases per 100,000 SARS‐CoV‐2 infections. COVID‐19 appears to be associated with an increased likelihood of GBSs and with demyelinating GBSs variants in particular.","Palaiodimou, Lina; Stefanou, Maria‐Ioanna; Katsanos, Aristeidis H.; Fragkou, Paraskevi C.; Papadopoulou, Marianna; Moschovos, Christos; Michopoulos, Ioannis; Kokotis, Panagiotis; Bakirtzis, Christos; Naska, Androniki; Vassilakopoulos, Theodoros I.; Chroni, Elisabeth; Tsiodras, Sotirios; Tsivgoulis, Georgios",Eur J Neurol,195,27

In this paper, a blockchain-based privacy-preserving scheme is proposed, which realizes secure sharing of medical data between several entities involved patients, research institutions and semi-trusted cloud servers. And meanwhile, it achieves the data availability and consistency between patients and research institutions, where zero-knowledge proof is employed to verify whether the patient's medical data meets the specific requirements proposed by research institutions without revealing patients’ privacy, and then the proxy re-encryption technology is adopted to ensure that research institutions can decrypt the intermediary ciphertext. In addition, this proposal can execute distributed consensus based on PBFT algorithm for transactions between patients and research institutions according to the prearranged terms. Theoretical analysis shows the proposed scheme can satisfy security and privacy requirements such as confidentiality, integrity and availability, as well as performance evaluation demonstrates it is feasible and efficient in contrast with other typical schemes.","Huang, Haiping; Zhu, Peng; Xiao, Fu; Sun, Xiang; Huang, Qinglong",Comput Secur,195,5

Based on conserved regions in the genomes of these three viruses, the VP2 gene of CPV-2, the endoribonuclease nsp15 gene of CCoV, and the 52K gene of CAV were selected for primer design. The specificity of the mPCR results showed no amplification of canine distemper virus (CDV), canine parainfluenza virus (CPIV), or pseudorabies virus (PRV), indicating that the method had good specificity. A sensitivity test showed that the detection limit of the mPCR method was 1 × 10(4) viral copies. A total of 63 rectal swabs from dogs with diarrheal symptoms were evaluated using mPCR and routine PCR. The ratio of positive samples to total samples for CPV-2, CCoV, and CAV was 55.6% (35/63) for mPCR and 55.6% (35/63) for routine PCR. Thirty-five positive samples were detected by both methods, for a coincidence ratio of 100%. This mPCR method can simultaneously detect CCoV (CCoV-II), CAV (CAV-1, CAV-2) and CPV-2 (CPV-2a, CPV-2b, CPV-2c), which are associated with viral enteritis, thereby providing an efficient, inexpensive, specific, and accurate new tool for clinical diagnosis and laboratory epidemiological investigations.","Deng, Xiaoyu; Zhang, Jiali; Su, Jiazi; Liu, Hao; Cong, Yanlong; Zhang, Lei; Zhang, Kemeng; Shi, Ning; Lu, Rongguang; Yan, Xijun",Arch Virol,195,32

As such, the identification of inhibitory drugs against its etiological agent, SARS-CoV-2, is of utmost importance, and in particular, repurposing may provide the fastest route to curb the disease. As the first step in this route, we sought to identify an attractive and viable target in the virus for pharmaceutical inhibition. Using three bacteria-based assays that were tested on known viroporins, we demonstrate that one of its essential components, the E protein, is a potential ion channel and, therefore, is an excellent drug target. Channel activity was demonstrated for E proteins in other coronaviruses, providing further emphasis on the importance of this functionally to the virus’ pathogenicity. The results of a screening effort involving a repurposing drug library of ion channel blockers yielded two compounds that inhibit the E protein: Gliclazide and Memantine. In conclusion, as a route to curb viral virulence and abate COVID-19, we point to the E protein of SARS-CoV-2 as an attractive drug target and identify off-label compounds that inhibit it.","Singh Tomar, Prabhat Pratap; Arkin, Isaiah T.",Biochem Biophys Res Commun,195,20

Since the mechanism is immunomodulatory and not antibiotical, the mushrooms should be active against multi‐drug resistant microbes as well. Moreover, since these Basidiomycota also have anti‐inflammatory properties, they may be suited for treatment of the severe lung inflammation that often follows COVID‐19 infection. An AbM‐based mushroom extract (Andosan™), also containing HE and GF, has been shown to significantly reduce bacteraemia and increase survival in mice with pneumococcal sepsis, and to improve symptoms and quality of life in IBD patients via an anti‐inflammatory effect.

Innovative tests have been developed to diagnose and characterize the spread of COVID-19. Only a few studies have reported the diagnostic value of currently available tests. The diagnostic performance of the tests is a major concern after the recent resurgence in COVID-19. Methods: Published papers and FDA data on the currently available tests were used for analysis. Likelihood ratios, and predictive values of tests were computed. Only FDA approved tests were included. RT-PCR performance among different specimen types were also explored. Main results: All the published reports on the COVID-19 tests reported RT-PCR as the validation tool for their results. Not all available COVID-19 tests reported their sensitivity and specificity. Among the publications which reported, the positive likelihood ratio ranged between 0.15 to 0.88 and tests had high negative likelihood ratio (0.99). Conclusion: Although most recent publications showed high positive and negative likelihood ratios and high predictive values, the publications on test accuracy and validity have limited scope primarily due to their small sample size and insufficiencies in methodology and published data. Although most lab tests reported high sensitivity and specificity, false omission and false discovery rates were found notable in several COVID-19 lab tests.

The project is conducted in collaboration with the Montreal festival district (Quartier des Spectacles) as part of the Sounds in the City partnership. The analyses rely on continuous acoustic monitoring of three sites. The comparisons are presented in terms of (1) energetic acoustic indicators over different periods of time (L(den), L(d), L(e), L(n)), (2) statistical acoustic indicators (L(10), L(90)), and (3) hourly, daily, and weekly profiles of sound levels throughout the day. Preliminary analyses reveal sound level reductions on the order of 6–7 dB(A) during lockdown, with differences more or less marked across sites and times of the day. After lockdown, sound levels gradually increased following an incremental relaxation of confinement. Within four weeks, sound levels measurements nearly reached the pre-COVID-19 levels despite a reduced number of pedestrian activities. Long-term measurements suggest a ‘new normal’ that is not quite as loud without festival activities, but that is also not characterizable as quiet.

Following a PED outbreak that occurred in China in 2010, the disease was identified for the first time in the United States in April 2013, and was reported in many other countries worldwide from 2013 to 2014. As a novel approach to elucidate the epidemiological relationship between PEDV strains, we explored their genome sequences to identify the motifs that were shared within related strains. Of PED outbreaks reported in many countries during 2013–2014, 119 PEDV strains in Japan, USA, Canada, Mexico, Germany, and Korea were selected and used in this study. We developed a motif mining program, which aimed to identify a specific region of the genome that was exclusively shared by a group of PEDV strains. Eight motifs were identified (M1–M8) and they were observed in 41, 9, 18, 6, 10, 14, 2, and 2 strains, respectively. Motifs M1–M6 were shared by strains from more than two countries, and seemed to originate from one PEDV strain, Indiana12.83/USA/2013, among the 119 strains studied. BLAST search for motifs M1–M6 revealed that M3–M5 were almost identical to the strain ZMDZY identified in 2011 in China, while M1 and M2 were similar to other Chinese strains isolated in 2011–2012. Consequently, the PED outbreaks in these six countries may be closely related, and multiple transmissions of PEDV strains between these countries may have occurred during 2013–2014. Although tools such as phylogenetic tree analysis with whole genome sequences are increasingly applied to reveal the connection between isolates, its interpretation is sometimes inconclusive. Application of motifs as a tool to examine the whole genome sequences of causative agents will be more objective and will be an explicit indicator of their relationship.","Yamamoto, Takehisa; Suzuki, Tohru; Ohashi, Seiichi; Miyazaki, Ayako; Tsutsui, Toshiyuki",PLoS One,195,22

Consistent with the Lucas paradox, the present work establishes that financial integration can reduce the speed of capital accumulation and increase savings in a developing country still in the process of convergence toward the steady state and with domestic capital market distortions. The level of capital accumulation at the time of integration crucially affects agents’ welfare. The closer the economy is to its steady state, the lower are agents’ welfare gains in the financially less advanced economy, while they are always negative in the more developed country. Two forces drive these results: precautionary saving and the propensity to move resources from risky capital to safe assets until the risk-adjusted return on capital equalizes the risk-free interest rate.

To date, only two transduction modalities, colorimetric lateral flow immunoassays (LFIs) and electrochemical assays, fully meet these requirements and have been widely adopted at the point-of-need. These modalities are either non-quantitative (LFIs) or highly analyte-specific (electrochemical glucose meters), therefore requiring considerable modification if they are to be co-opted for measuring other biomarkers. Förster Resonance Energy Transfer (RET)-based biosensors incorporate a quantitative and highly versatile transduction modality that has been extensively used in biomedical research laboratories. RET-biosensors have not yet been applied at the point-of-need despite its advantages over other established techniques. In this review, we explore and discuss recent developments in the translation of RET-biosensors for PON diagnoses, including their potential benefits and drawbacks.","Weihs, Felix; Anderson, Alisha; Trowell, Stephen; Caron, Karine",Sensors (Basel),195,6

The rapid growth of data collection and linking capabilities combined with the increasing diversity of the data-driven AI techniques, including machine learning (ML), has brought both ubiquitous opportunities for data analytics projects and increased demands for the regulation and accountability of the outcomes of these projects. As a result, the area of interpretability and explainability of ML is gaining significant research momentum. While there has been some progress in the development of ML methods, the methodological side has shown limited progress. This limits the practicality of using ML in the health domain: the issues with explaining the outcomes of ML algorithms to medical practitioners and policy makers in public health has been a recognized obstacle to the broader adoption of data science approaches in this domain. This study builds on the earlier work which introduced CRISP-ML, a methodology that determines the interpretability level required by stakeholders for a successful real-world solution and then helps in achieving it. CRISP-ML was built on the strengths of CRISP-DM, addressing the gaps in handling interpretability. Its application in the Public Healthcare sector follows its successful deployment in a number of recent real-world projects across several industries and fields, including credit risk, insurance, utilities, and sport. This study elaborates on the CRISP-ML methodology on the determination, measurement, and achievement of the necessary level of interpretability of ML solutions in the Public Healthcare sector. It demonstrates how CRISP-ML addressed the problems with data diversity, the unstructured nature of data, and relatively low linkage between diverse data sets in the healthcare domain. The characteristics of the case study, used in the study, are typical for healthcare data, and CRISP-ML managed to deliver on these issues, ensuring the required level of interpretability of the ML solutions discussed in the project. The approach used ensured that interpretability requirements were met, taking into account public healthcare specifics, regulatory requirements, project stakeholders, project objectives, and data characteristics. The study concludes with the three main directions for the development of the presented cross-industry standard process.","Kolyshkina, Inna; Simoff, Simeon",Front Big Data,195,1

On October 30, the number of new cases reported in the United States in a single day exceeded 100,000 for the first time, and by December 2 had reached a daily high of 196,227.* With colder weather, more time spent indoors, the ongoing U.S. holiday season, and silent spread of disease, with approximately 50% of transmission from asymptomatic persons (2), the United States has entered a phase of high-level transmission where a multipronged approach to implementing all evidence-based public health strategies at both the individual and community levels is essential. This summary guidance highlights critical evidence-based CDC recommendations and sustainable strategies to reduce COVID-19 transmission. These strategies include 1) universal face mask use, 2) maintaining physical distance from other persons and limiting in-person contacts, 3) avoiding nonessential indoor spaces and crowded outdoor spaces, 4) increasing testing to rapidly identify and isolate infected persons, 5) promptly identifying, quarantining, and testing close contacts of persons with known COVID-19, 6) safeguarding persons most at risk for severe illness or death from infection with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, 7) protecting essential workers with provision of adequate personal protective equipment and safe work practices, 8) postponing travel, 9) increasing room air ventilation and enhancing hand hygiene and environmental disinfection, and 10) achieving widespread availability and high community coverage with effective COVID-19 vaccines. In combination, these strategies can reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission, long-term sequelae or disability, and death, and mitigate the pandemic's economic impact. Consistent implementation of these strategies improves health equity, preserves health care capacity, maintains the function of essential businesses, and supports the availability of in-person instruction for kindergarten through grade 12 schools and preschool. Individual persons, households, and communities should take these actions now to reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission from its current high level. These actions will provide a bridge to a future with wide availability and high community coverage of effective vaccines, when safe return to more everyday activities in a range of settings will be possible.","Honein, Margaret A.; Christie, Athalia; Rose, Dale A.; Brooks, John T.; Meaney-Delman, Dana; Cohn, Amanda; Sauber-Schatz, Erin K.; Walker, Allison; McDonald, L.

Potential therapeutics include repurposed drugs, some with cardiac liabilities. We report on a chronic preclinical drug screening platform, a cardiac microphysiological system (MPS), to assess cardiotoxicity associated with repurposed hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and azithromycin (AZM) polytherapy in a mock phase I safety clinical trial. The MPS contained human heart muscle derived from induced pluripotent stem cells. The effect of drug response was measured using outputs that correlate with clinical measurements, such as QT interval (action potential duration) and drug‐biomarker pairing. Chronic exposure (10 days) of heart muscle to HCQ alone elicited early afterdepolarizations and increased QT interval past 5 days. AZM alone elicited an increase in QT interval from day 7 onward, and arrhythmias were observed at days 8 and 10. Monotherapy results mimicked clinical trial outcomes. Upon chronic exposure to HCQ and AZM polytherapy, we observed an increase in QT interval on days 4–8. Interestingly, a decrease in arrhythmias and instabilities was observed in polytherapy relative to monotherapy, in concordance with published clinical trials. Biomarkers, most of them measurable in patients’ serum, were identified for negative effects of monotherapy or polytherapy on tissue contractile function, morphology, and antioxidant protection. The cardiac MPS correctly predicted clinical arrhythmias associated with QT prolongation and rhythm instabilities.

This is related to the parasite's neurotropism, high prevalence of chronic infection, as well as specific and non-specific behavioral alterations in rodents that lead to increased risk taking, which are recapitulated in humans by T. gondii's associations with suicidal behavior, as well as trait impulsivity and aggression, mental illness and traffic accidents. This paper is a detailed review of the associations between T. gondii serology and suicidal behavior, a field of study that started 15 years ago with our publication of associations between T. gondii IgG serology and suicidal behavior in persons with mood disorders. This “legacy” article presents, chronologically, our primary studies in individuals with mood disorders and schizophrenia in Germany, recent attempters in Sweden, and in a large cohort of mothers in Denmark. Then, it reviews findings from all three meta-analyses published to date, confirming our reported associations and overall consistent in effect size [ranging between 39 and 57% elevation of odds of suicide attempt in T. gondii immunoglobulin (IgG) positives]. Finally, the article introduces certain links between T. gondii and biomarkers previously associated with suicidal behavior (kynurenines, phenylalanine/tyrosine), intermediate phenotypes of suicidal behavior (impulsivity, aggression) and state-dependent suicide risk factors (hopelessness/dysphoria, sleep impairment). In sum, an abundance of evidence supports a positive link between suicide attempts (but not suicidal ideation) and T. gondii IgG (but not IgM) seropositivity and serointensity. Trait impulsivity and aggression, endophenotypes of suicidal behavior have also been positively associated with T. gondii seropositivity in both the psychiatrically healthy as well as in patients with Intermittent Explosive Disorder. Yet, causality has not been demonstrated. Thus, randomized interventional studies are necessary to advance causal inferences and, if causality is confirmed, to provide hope that an etiological treatment for a distinct subgroup of individuals at an increased risk for suicide could emerge.","Postolache, Teodor T.; Wadhawan, Abhishek; Rujescu, Dan; Hoisington, Andrew J.; Dagdag, Aline; Baca-Garcia, Enrique; Lowry, Christopher A.; Okusaga, Olaoluwa O.; Brenner, Lisa A.",Front Psychiatry,195,33

Thus, identifying the host pathways essential for the virus replication may lead to potential targets for therapeutic intervention. The mechanisms and pathways explored by SARS-CoV-2 to support its replication within host cells are not fully known. Lipid droplets (LD) are organelles with major functions in lipid metabolism, energy homeostasis and intracellular transport, and have multiple roles in infections and inflammation. Here we described that monocytes from COVID-19 patients have an increased LD accumulation compared to SARS-CoV-2 negative donors. In vitro, SARS-CoV-2 infection were seen to modulate pathways of lipid synthesis and uptake as monitored by testing for CD36, SREBP-1, PPARγ, and DGAT-1 expression in monocytes and triggered LD formation in different human cell lines. LDs were found in close apposition with SARS-CoV-2 proteins and double-stranded (ds)-RNA in infected Vero cells. Electron microscopy (EM) analysis of SARS-CoV-2 infected Vero cells show viral particles colocalizing with LDs, suggestive that LDs might serve as an assembly platform. Pharmacological modulation of LD formation by inhibition of DGAT-1 with A922500 significantly inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication as well as reduced production of mediators pro-inflammatory response.

To understand how patient characteristics impact clinician decisions and service models, this study examines practice patterns within a lifespan outpatient neuropsychology center before, during and post-pandemic. METHODS Patient volume, demographics, and characteristics were compared across four, 3-month time intervals in 2019-2020. Two baseline intervals when the center was physically open (PO) were compared to one interval when the center was physically closed (PC) (all evaluations were conducted via direct-to-home TNP) and a fourth interval when the center was physically reopened (RO) and evaluations were conducted in one of the three modalities: in-person, virtual only or hybrid (both virtual/in-person). RESULTS A total of 1,459 total neuropsychological evaluations were conducted with a 64.6% reduction during PC. At RO, the number of evaluations returned to pre-COVID baseline during which in-person (72.4%) evaluations were conducted at a higher rate than hybrid (7.1%) or virtual only (20.4%). Across the lifespan, mean number of appointments to complete evaluations was significantly greater during PC (p< .001) than at other time intervals, and during RO, hybrid evaluations required significantly more appointments (p < .001) than in-person and virtual. The majority of evaluations were conducted with adult patients (71.4%). For adult patients, neurodegenerative/memory disorders received TNP evaluations at a higher rate during PC and RO. Pediatric patients were significantly older during PC (p < .001); neurodevelopmental referrals received more hybrid and virtual evaluations. CONCLUSIONS Results indicate that patient characteristics, especially age and referral categories, impact the feasibility of TNP. Data from the RO period suggest that in-person evaluations not surprisingly remain the mainstay; however, for adult patients, and especially older adults with neurodegenerative/memory disorders, TNP may provide an important option for delivery of neuropsychological evaluations.","Pulsifer, Margaret B; Grieco, Julie A; Burstein, Sarah M; Parsons, Michael W; Gardner, Melissa M; Sherman, Janet C",Journal of clinical and experimental neuropsychology,195,30

Generalized linear mixed models, path analysis structural equation, and conditional interference classification tree were performed to further understand how sociodemographic factors impact k’ and to establish a predictive model for the risk behavior of leaving home during the pandemic.

In this paper, we present a system that helps blind people to maintain physical distance to other persons using a combination of RGB and depth cameras. We use a real-time semantic segmentation algorithm on the RGB camera to detect where persons are and use the depth camera to assess the distance to them; then, we provide audio feedback through bone-conducting headphones if a person is closer than 1.5 m. Our system warns the user only if persons are nearby but does not react to non-person objects such as walls, trees or doors; thus, it is not intrusive, and it is possible to use it in combination with other assistive devices. We have tested our prototype system on one blind and four blindfolded persons, and found that the system is precise, easy to use, and amounts to low cognitive load.","Martinez, Manuel; Yang, Kailun; Constantinescu, Angela; Stiefelhagen, Rainer",Sensors (Basel),195,16

This pandemic has led, mainly due to conditions related to confinement, to major changes in consumer habits and behaviors. Although there have been several studies on the analysis of customers’ satisfaction through survey-based and online customers’ reviews, the impact of COVID-19 on customers' satisfaction has not been investigated so far. It is important to investigate dimensions of satisfaction from the online customers’ reviews to reveal their preferences on the hotels' services during the COVID-19 outbreak. This study aims to reveal the travelers’ satisfaction in Malaysian hotels during the COVID-19 outbreak through online customers’ reviews. In addition, this study investigates whether service quality during COVID-19 has an impact on hotel performance criteria and consequently customers' satisfaction. Accordingly, we develop a new method through machine learning approaches. The method is developed using text mining, clustering, and prediction learning techniques. We use Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for big data analysis to identify the voice-of-the-customer, Expectation-Maximization (EM) for clustering, and ANFIS for satisfaction level prediction. In addition, we use Higher-Order Singular Value Decomposition (HOSVD) for missing value imputation. The data was collected from TripAdvisor regarding the travelers’ concerns in the form of online reviews on the COVID-19 outbreak and numerical ratings on hotel services from different perspectives. The results from the analysis of online customers’ reviews revealed that service quality during COVID-19 has an impact on hotel performance criteria and consequently customers' satisfaction. In addition, the results showed that although the customers are always seeking hotels with better performance, they are also concerned with the quality of related services in the COVID-19 outbreak.","Nilashi, Mehrbakhsh; Abumalloh, Rabab Ali; Alghamdi, Abdullah; Minaei-Bidgoli, Behrouz; Alsulami, Abdulaziz A.; Thanoon, Mohammed; Asadi, Shahla; Samad, Sarminah",Telematics and Informatics,195,1

It is, however, so far unclear how patients with a history of pulmonary embolism (PE) perceive their individual COVID-19 risk. Moreover, their worries and preventive behaviors and their associations with risk perception are unknown. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A postal survey was conducted in April 2020, including participants with previous PE from the German “Lungenembolie Augsburg” (LEA) cohort study. The questionnaire contained items on COVID-19 knowledge, risk perception (infection likelihood, susceptibility, dangerousness), information sources and satisfaction with information, individual assignment to a high risk group due to pre-existing conditions, worries, infection likelihood, and implementation of preventive behaviors. RESULTS: From the 185 respondents, 71.7% assigned themselves to a high risk group in terms of developing a severe case of COVID-19. The likelihood of being infected was rated as verylow/low by 82.3% and the susceptability by 37.8%. A considerable percentage of patients expected a very high/high infection risk in a hospital (48.3%) or at a doctor's practice (37.9%). Major sources of information were the patients' general practitioners (48.9%) and the internet (31.5%). Assignment to a high risk group (β = 1.04) and uncertainty in terms of assignment (β = 1.26) were significantly (p = 0.01) associated with a higher level of health-related worries. CONCLUSIONS: Most patients with previous PE feel that they belong to a high risk group in terms of severe illness from COVID-19. Support in coping with their individual COVID-19 risk is warranted.","Kirchberger, Inge; Berghaus, Thomas M.; von Scheidt, Wolfgang; Linseisen, Jakob; Meisinger, Christine",Thromb Res,195,20

PURPOSE: This review provides an overview of the proceedings of the symposium “Tackling the Challenges of Nanomedicines: Are We ready?” organized by the International Pharmaceutical Federation (FIP) Hospital Pharmacy Section and Non-Biological Complex Drugs (NBCDs) Working Group at the 2019 FIP World Congress of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences. Debate centered on reasons underlying the current complex regulatory landscape for nanomedicines and their follow-on products (referred to as nanosimilars) and the pivotal role of hospital pharmacists in selecting, handling, and guiding usage of nanomedicines and nanosimilars. SUMMARY: The evaluation and use of nanomedicines are recognized among scientific, pharmaceutical, and regulatory bodies as complex. Interchangeability and substitutability of nanomedicines and nanosimilars are confounded by a lack of pharmaceutical and pharmacological equivalence, reflecting the inherent complex nature of these drug products and manufacturing processes. Consequences include implications for clinical safety and efficacy and, ultimately, comparability. Local regulatory approvals of some nanomedicines have occurred, but there is no standard to ensure streamlined evaluation and use of consistent measures of therapeutic equivalence of reference products and their nanosimilars. Hospital pharmacists are expected to be experts in the selection, handling, and substitution of nanomedicines and familiarize themselves with the limitations of current methods of assessing pharmaceutical and clinical equivalence of nanosimilars in order to ensure informed formulary decision-making and eventual patient benefit. CONCLUSION: Supportive guidance for pharmacists focusing on the substitutability and/or interchangeability of nanomedicines and their nanosimilars is needed. Current FIP guidance for pharmacists on therapeutic interchange and substitution should be extended to include nanomedicines and nanosimilars.","Hertig, John B; Shah, Vinod P; Flühmann, Beat; Mühlebach, Stefan; Stemer, Gunar; Surugue, Jacqueline; Moss, Rob; Di Francesco, Tiziana",Am J Health Syst Pharm,195,1

The field of oncology has not been spared, as prepandemic training schedules have not been available for residents. We conducted an online survey to understand the effect of the pandemic and the effect of online teaching schedules as a measure to help residents of oncology in their training. METHODS AND MATERIALS: An online survey consisting of 31 questions was sent through various social media platforms based on the training pattern before the onset of COVID-19, effect of the pandemic on educational activities, and the effect of online academic activities on residency training and learning. The survey addressed the need for online academics as an alternate mode of teaching. The survey was left open for a period of 4 weeks with participation requests from the various branches of oncology, including radiation, surgical and medical oncology, onco-anesthesia, palliative oncology, neuro-oncology, and so forth. The frequencies obtained in the survey were analyzed using descriptive statistical analyses. RESULTS: After a 4-week period, there were 255 responses received from students of oncology from various specialties. Around 69.8.1% of respondents (n = 178) were junior residents, followed by senior residents (n = 72; 28.2%). The majority of the respondents were radiation oncologists (n = 204; 80%). Around 70.9% had an ongoing structured teaching program related to oncology training, with the majority (40.3%) of them having more than 3 hours every week of oncology-based training. Another 31.3% reported having 1 to 2 hours of such training every week, and 60.8% of participants agreed their training was affected by pandemic and related safety regulations. Most students (90.9%) found the online teaching sessions helped maintain training qualities as they were in the pre-COVID times. About 69.1% of the students felt that the quality of these online sessions was better compared with the institute-based onsite classroom teaching. However, as is expected, 77.6% of them agreed that their hands-on training was affected in the pandemic. When asked if online teaching can replace every aspect of classroom teaching, 66.7% of respondents did not agree. The majority (83.9%) felt that students should be given the opportunity to present a given topic under the supervision of a senior faculty member experienced and expert in that topic. The students pointed out the lack of practical exposure as the most common deficiency, followed by the lack of direct interaction with the teaching faculty. CONCLUSIONS: The pandemic has limited the access to essential training in the branches of oncology, and though online sessions cannot replace the hands-on training and clinical exposure needed for the students, online academics and webinars have proven to be an effective tool to minimize that effect and can lead to a positive outcome, as shown by the survey. A combination of online and onsite training modules may be the future of teaching and training in our country.","Mondal, Dodul; Barthwal, Mansi; Singh, Neelam; Pareek, Vibhay",Adv Radiat Oncol,195,1

The central nervous system (CNS) GJs are important for maintenance of myelin sheath and neuronal activity. Connexin (Cx) proteins are building blocks of GJs. Recent cell-biological investigations show that amongst the CNS specific Cxs, the most abundant Cx protein, Cx43 and its oligodendrocytic coupling partner Cx47 primarily important for maintenance of CNS myelin. Recent investigations elucidate that the expression of Cx43 and Cx47 is very important to maintain K+ buffering and nutrient homeostasis in oligodendrocytes, CNS myelin and oligodendrocyte function. The investigations on Multiple Sclerosis (MS) patient samples and EAE hypothesized that the functional loss of Cx43/Cx47 could be associated with spread of chronic MS lesions. Exploring the mechanism of initial GJ alteration and its effect on demyelination in this model of MS might play a primary role to understand the basis of altered CNS homeostasis, observed during MS. In this review, we mainly discuss the role of CNS GJs, specifically the Cx43/Cx47 axis in the perspective of demyelination.","Basu, Rahul; Das Sarma, Jayasri",J Biosci,195,16

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 1,402 outpatients with diabetes at a clinic in Osaka, Japan, who responded to an interview sheet regarding lifestyle changes during the COVID‐19 pandemic between 28 March and 30 May 2020. The association of lifestyle changes with hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and weight changes from February to May 2020 was investigated using the linear regression model. We also investigated the association with clinically important change of HbA1c (by ≥0.3%) and bodyweight (by ≥3%), using the cumulative link model. RESULTS: Leisure time and other outside physical activities were decreased in one‐quarter of patients during the COVID‐19 pandemic, whereas the amount of meals and snacks was decreased and increased in approximately 10%, respectively. The change in leisure time physical activities was inversely associated with HbA1c and weight changes, whereas the quantitative change of meals with the decline in eating out and that of snacks were positively associated with HbA1c and weight changes (all P < 0.05). The quantitative change of meals without the decline in eating out was also positively associated with weight change (P = 0.012). The cumulative link model for clinically important HbA1c and weight change showed broadly similar associations, except for that between snacks and bodyweight (P = 0.15).

While the risks and benefits of noninvasive techniques versus early invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) are intensely debated, actual evidence is lacking. We sought to assess the risks and benefits of different respiratory support strategies, employed in intensive care units during the first months of the COVID-19 pandemic on intubation and intensive care unit (ICU) mortality rates. METHODS: Subanalysis of a prospective, multinational registry of critically ill COVID-19 patients. Patients were subclassified into standard oxygen therapy ≥10 L/min (SOT), high-flow oxygen therapy (HFNC), noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation (NIV), and early IMV, according to the respiratory support strategy employed at the day of admission to ICU. Propensity score matching was performed to ensure comparability between groups. RESULTS: Initially, 1421 patients were assessed for possible study inclusion. Of these, 351 patients (85 SOT, 87 HFNC, 87 NIV, and 92 IMV) remained eligible for full analysis after propensity score matching. 55% of patients initially receiving noninvasive respiratory support required IMV. The intubation rate was lower in patients initially ventilated with HFNC and NIV compared to those who received SOT (SOT: 64%, HFNC: 52%, NIV: 49%, p = 0.025). Compared to the other respiratory support strategies, NIV was associated with a higher overall ICU mortality (SOT: 18%, HFNC: 20%, NIV: 37%, IMV: 25%, p = 0.016). CONCLUSION: In this cohort of critically ill patients with COVID-19, a trial of HFNC appeared to be the most balanced initial respiratory support strategy, given the reduced intubation rate and comparable ICU mortality rate. Nonetheless, considering the uncertainty and stress associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, SOT and early IMV represented safe initial respiratory support strategies. The presented findings, in agreement with classic ARDS literature, suggest that NIV should be avoided whenever possible due to the elevated ICU mortality risk.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A single-center retrospective study of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 from January 1 through August 31, 2020 to evaluate whether outpatient insulin use, HbA1c, glucose on admission, or average glucose during admission was associated with intensive care unit (ICU) admission, mechanical ventilation (ventilator) requirement, or mortality. RESULTS: Among 111 patients with DM, 48 (43.2%) were on outpatient insulin and the average HbA1c was 8.1% (65 mmol/mol). The average glucose on admission was 187.0±102.94 mg/dL and the average glucose during hospitalization was 173.4±39.8 mg/dL. Use of outpatient insulin, level of HbA1c, glucose on admission, or average glucose during hospitalization was not associated with ICU admission, ventilator requirement, or mortality among patients with COVID-19 and DM.

Climate change-related reductions in land productivity and habitability and in food and water security can also interact with demographic, economic and social factors to increase migration. In addition to migration, climate change has also implications for travel and the risk of disease. This article discusses the impact of climate change on migration and travel with implications for public health practice. Methods: Literature review. Results: Migrants may be at increased risk of communicable and non-communicable diseases, due to factors in their country of origin and their country of destination or conditions that they experience during migration. Although migration has not been a significant driver of communicable disease outbreaks to date, public health authorities need to ensure that effective screening and vaccination programmes for priority communicable diseases are in place. Population growth coupled with socio-economic development is increasing travel and tourism, and advances in technology have increased global connectivity and reduced the time required to cover long distances. At the same time, as a result of climate change, many temperate regions, including high-income countries, are now suitable for vector-borne disease transmission. This is providing opportunities for importation of vectors and pathogens from endemic areas that can lead to cases or outbreaks of communicable diseases with which health professionals may be unfamiliar. Conclusion: Health systems need to be prepared for the potential population health consequences of migration, travel and tourism and the impact of climate change on these. Integrated surveillance, early detection of cases and other public health interventions are critical to protect population health and prevent and control communicabledisease outbreaks.","Semenza, Jan C; Ebi, Kristie L",J Travel Med,195,24

For the treatment of flu disease, both antivirals and vaccines are available with vaccines the most effective and safest approach. In order to overcome limitations in egg-based vaccine manufacturing, cell culture–based processes have been established. While this production method avoids egg-associated risks in face of pandemics, process intensification using animal suspension cells in high cell density perfusion cultures should allow to further increase manufacturing capacities worldwide. In this work, we demonstrate the development of a perfusion process using Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) suspension cells for influenza A (H1N1) virus production from scale-down shake flask cultivations to laboratory scale stirred tank bioreactors. Shake flask cultivations using semi-perfusion mode enabled high-yield virus harvests (4.25 log(10)(HAU/100 μL)) from MDCK cells grown up to 41 × 10(6) cells/mL. Scale-up to bioreactors with an alternating tangential flow (ATF) perfusion system required optimization of pH control and implementation of a temperature shift during the infection phase. Use of a capacitance probe for on-line perfusion control allowed to minimize medium consumption. This contributed to a better process control and a more economical performance while maintaining a maximum virus titer of 4.37 log(10)(HAU/100 μL) and an infectious virus titer of 1.83 × 10(10) virions/mL. Overall, this study clearly demonstrates recent advances in cell culture–based perfusion processes for next-generation high-yield influenza vaccine manufacturing for pandemic preparedness. KEY POINTS: • First MDCK suspension cell–based perfusion process for IAV produciton was established. • “Cell density effect” was overcome and process was intensified by reduction of medium use and automated process control. • The process achieved cell density over 40 × 10(6) cells/mL and virus yield over 4.37 log(10)(HAU/100 μL).

This virus has challenged civilization and modern science in ways that few infectious diseases and natural disasters have previously, causing globally significant human morbidity and mortality and triggering economic downturns across financial markets that will be dealt with for generations. Despite this, the pandemic has also brought an opportunity for humanity to come together and participate in a shared scientific investigation. Clinically, SARS-CoV-2 is associated with lower mortality rates than other recently emerged coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). However, SARS-CoV-2 exhibits efficient human-to-human spread, with transmission often occurring before symptom recognition; this feature averts containment strategies that had worked previously for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Severe COVID-19 disease is characterized by dysregulated inflammatory responses associated with pulmonary congestion and intravascular coagulopathy leading to pneumonia, vascular insults, and multiorgan disease. Approaches to treatment have combined supportive care with antivirals, such as remdesivir, with immunomodulatory medications, including corticosteroids and cytokine-blocking antibody therapies; these treatments have advanced rapidly through clinical trials. Innovative approaches to vaccine development have facilitated rapid advances in design, testing, and distribution. Much remains to be learned about SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19, and further biomedical research is necessary, including comparative medicine studies in animal models. This overview of COVID-19 in humans will highlight important aspects of disease, relevant pathophysiology, underlying immunology, and therapeutics that have been developed to date.","Watson, Michael E; Inagaki, Kengo; Weinberg, Jason B",Comparative medicine,195,24

METHOD: We utilized search terms relating to facemasks, infection, and community settings on PubMed, the Cochrane Library Database, and Google Scholar. A meta-analysis was conducted utilizing a random-effects model. RESULTS: The review included 12 primary studies on the effectiveness of medical facemask use to prevent influenza, influenza-like illness, SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Our meta-analysis demonstrates that facemask use significantly reduces the risk of transmitting these respiratory infections (pooled OR = 0.66, 95% confidence interval: 0.54-0.81). Of the 12 studies, ten clinical trials suggest that respiratory infection incidence is lower with high medical facemask compliance, early use, and use in combination with intensive hand hygiene. One cohort study conducted during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, demonstrated facemasks are effective in reducing SARS-CoV-2 transmission when used before those infected develop symptoms. One case-control study reported that controls used medical facemasks more often than cases infected with SARS-CoV (p-value<0.05). No primary study on cloth facemask effectiveness to prevent respiratory infection transmission was found. CONCLUSION: Based on the available evidence, we recommend medical facemask use by healthy and sick individuals for preventing respiratory infection transmission in community settings. Medical facemask effectiveness is dependent on compliance and utilization in combination with preventive measures such as intensive hand hygiene. Currently, no direct evidence is available in humans supporting the recommendation of cloth facemask use to prevent respiratory infection transmission.","Chaabna, Karima; Doraiswamy, Sathyanarayanan; Mamtani, Ravinder; Cheema, Sohaila",Int J Infect Dis,195,16

Subsequently, data from various countries have revealed obesity as an independent and significant factor, with people who are overweight/have obesity significantly more likely to be hospitalized, require ICU treatment, and to die. Notably, this additional risk applies to younger people relative to the general COVID-19 risk profile. This paper sets out the evidence of greater risk of poor COVID outcomes for people who are overweight/have obesity, indication of reduced treatment and support for obesity self-management where it existed prior to COVID-19, and highlights the dearth of specific guidance and measures to mitigate the impacts of COVID-19 upon people with obesity. We identify the health, social and economic impacts that this specific vulnerability creates relative to COVID-19 outcomes. Reduced national and global pandemic resilience due to high obesity prevalence should spur governments and funders to provide urgent specific protection and support for people with overweight/obesity, and to commission rapid research to identify effective prevention and reduction measures. We set out priorities for action on obesity to begin compensating for years of underfunding and inadequate policy attention in the face of escalating obesity across countries of all income groups and world regions.","Jackson-Morris, Angela M.; Nugent, Rachel; Ralston, Johanna; Barata Cavalcanti, Olivia; Wilding, John",Global health action,195,10

Aims and Objectives : To evaluate the change in Day Care Chemotherapy (DCC) and Out Patient Department (OPD) patient numbers before and after COVID-19 national lockdown. Material and Methods: Demographic data, diagnosis, type and frequency of chemotherapy delivered in Day Care between 1st February 2020 to 31st July 2020 were retrieved. Out Patient Department daily patient numbers were collected during above period. Descriptive statistics, Odds ratio, Chi-square and Student T test were used to measure change in pattern of DDC and OPD patient numbers before and after 24th March 2020 (day of Lockdown). Pearson correlation coefficient was used to measure the strength of correlation between rise in COVID-19 cases and patient numbers. Results: 3192 DCC and 8209 OPD visits were recorded in 126 working days. Median age was 47 years( SD + 19.06). Breast (17%) and Gall bladder( 15%) were the most common cancers receiving chemotherapy. There was a significant decrease in number of DCC delivered in post COVID lockdown [ mean 21.97 ( + 9.7)] compared to pre COVID lockdown [mean 33.30 (+11.4)], t=4.11, p = 0.001.Similarly, there was a significant decrease in number of OPD visits in post COVID lockdown [ mean 47.13 ( + 18.8)] compared to pre COVID lockdown [mean 89.91 (+30.0)], t=7.09, p = 0.001.

Our knowledge about the general surgery trauma patients being affected by the restrictions is very limited. Objective To examine the association of the lockdown measurements during the COVID-19 pandemic with general surgical trauma patients' volume and severity at a university teaching hospital. Methods All patients admitted to the emergency department because of trauma and evaluated by the general surgery team were examined in two groups. The COVID-19 restrictions period (17 March 2020 - 31 May 2020) and the corresponding time last year (17 March 2019 - 31 May 2019). Demographic properties, injury mechanisms, emergency trauma scores (ETS), hospital length of stays (HLOS), intensive care unit (ICU) admission rates, surgical interventions, and mortality were compared. Results The number of patients in the restrictions period is 30% lower than the before COVID-19 cohort. ETS was significantly higher in the restrictions period compared to the previous year, whereas no significant difference was detected in terms of injury mechanisms between the groups (p=0.001 vs p=0.493, respectively). HLOS was found to be higher in the restrictions period (p=0.038). Conclusions Although there was a decrease in the number of general surgical trauma admissions, a significant increase in the severity of trauma was observed during COVID-19 restrictions.

We recently determined the crystal structure of MHV NTD complexed with its protein receptor murine carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 1 (CEACAM1), which surprisingly revealed a human galectin (galactose-binding lectin) fold in MHV NTD. Here, we have determined at 1.55 Å resolution the crystal structure of BCoV NTD, which also has the human galectin fold. Using mutagenesis, we have located the sugar-binding site in BCoV NTD, which overlaps with the galactose-binding site in human galectins. Using a glycan array screen, we have identified 5-N-acetyl-9-O-acetylneuraminic acid as the preferred sugar substrate for BCoV NTD. Subtle structural differences between BCoV and MHV NTDs, primarily involving different conformations of receptor-binding loops, explain why BCoV NTD does not bind CEACAM1 and why MHV NTD does not bind sugar. These results suggest a successful viral evolution strategy in which coronaviruses stole a galectin from hosts, incorporated it into their spike protein, and evolved it into viral receptor-binding domains with altered sugar specificity in contemporary BCoV or novel protein specificity in contemporary MHV.","Peng, Guiqing; Xu, Liqing; Lin, Yi-Lun; Chen, Lang; Pasquarella, Joseph R.; Holmes, Kathryn V.; Li, Fang",J Biol Chem,195,1

Many countries have postponed vaccination campaigns out of concern about infection risks to staff delivering vaccination, the children being vaccinated and their families. The World Health Organization recommends considering both the benefit of preventive campaigns and the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission when making decisions about campaigns during COVID-19 outbreaks, but there has been little quantification of the risks. METHODS: We modelled excess SARS-CoV-2 infection risk to vaccinators, vaccinees and their caregivers resulting from vaccination campaigns delivered during a COVID-19 epidemic. Our model used population age-structure and contact patterns from three exemplar countries (Burkina Faso, Ethiopia, and Chile). It combined an existing compartmental transmission model of an underlying COVID-19 epidemic with a Reed-Frost model of SARS-CoV-2 infection risk to vaccinators and vaccinees. We explored how excess risk depends on key parameters governing SARS-CoV-2 transmissibility, and aspects of campaign delivery such as campaign duration, number of vaccinations, and effectiveness of personal protective equipment (PPE) and symptomatic screening. RESULTS: Infection risks differ considerably depending on the circumstances in which vaccination campaigns are conducted. A campaign conducted at the peak of a SARS-CoV-2 epidemic with high prevalence and without special infection mitigation measures could increase absolute infection risk by 32% to 58% for vaccinators, and 0.3% to 0.9% for vaccinees and caregivers. However, these risks could be reduced to 3.6% to 8.0% and 0.1% to 0.4% respectively by use of PPE that reduces transmission by 90% (as might be achieved with N95 respirators or high-quality surgical masks) and symptomatic screening. CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 infection risks to vaccinators, vaccinees and caregivers during vaccination campaigns can be greatly reduced by adequate PPE, symptomatic screening, and appropriate campaign timing. Our results support the use of adequate risk mitigation measures for vaccination campaigns held during SARS-CoV-2 epidemics, rather than cancelling them entirely.","Procter, Simon R; Abbas, Kaja; Flasche, Stefan; Griffiths, Ulla; Hagedorn, Brittany; O’Reilly, Kathleen M; Jit, Mark",medRxiv,195,16

Methods A cross-sectional analytic study was conducted among 532 adults inhabiting the Makkah region of Saudi Arabia over a period of one month, from June 15 to July 15, 2020. A predesigned, self-administered questionnaire, including assessments of fear of COVID-19 and stress-relieving practices, was used for data collection. Results The mean Fear of COVID-19 Scale score was 17.3±5.21 out of 35. Individuals aged 30-49 years and married individuals had higher mean scores (18.4±5.20 and 18.4±5.29, respectively) compared to other groups (p<0.05). Additionally, individuals with histories of anxiety and depression, individuals suffering from chronic diseases, and those who did not exercise regularly had higher levels of fear compared to other groups (p<0.05).

Similarly, the U.S. also experienced a shortage of healthcare resources, which led to a reduction in the efficiency of the whole healthcare system. In order to evaluate this from a transportation perspective, it is critical to understand the extent to which healthcare facilities with intensive care unit (ICU) beds are available in both urban and rural areas. As such, this study aims to assess the spatial accessibility of COVID-19 patients to healthcare facilities in the State of Florida. For this purpose, two methods were used: the two-step floating catchment area (2SFCA) and the enhanced two-step floating catchment area (E2SFCA). These methods were applied to identify the high and low access areas in the entire state. Furthermore, a metric, namely the Accessibility Ratio Difference (ARD), was developed to evaluate the spatial access difference between the models. Results revealed that many areas in the northwest and southern Florida have lower access compared to other locations. The residents in central Florida (e.g., Tampa and Orlando cities) had the highest level of accessibility given their higher access ratios. We also observed that the 2SFCA method overestimates the accessibility in the areas with a lower number of ICU beds due to the “equal access” assumption of the population within the catchment area. The findings of this study can provide valuable insights and information for state officials and decision makers in the field of public health.","Ghorbanzadeh, Mahyar; Kim, Kyusik; Erman Ozguven, Eren; Horner, Mark W",Travel Behav Soc,195,10

Widespread vaccine rollout and continued transmission are creating a population that has antibody responses of varying potency to Wu-Hu-1. Against this background, it is critical to assess the outcomes of subsequent immunization with variant antigens. It is not yet known whether heterotypic vaccine boosts would be compromised by original antigenic sin, where pre-existing responses to a prior variant dampen responses to a new one, or whether the primed memory B cell repertoire would bridge the gap between Wu-Hu-1 and VOCs. Here, we show that a single adjuvanted dose of receptor binding domain (RBD) protein from VOC 501Y.V2 (B.1.351) drives an extremely potent neutralizing antibody response capable of cross-neutralizing both Wu-Hu-1 and 501Y.V2 in rhesus macaques previously immunized with Wu-Hu-1 spike protein. Passive immunization with plasma sampled following this boost protected K18-hACE2 mice from lethal challenge with a 501Y.V2 clinical isolate, whereas only partial protection was afforded by plasma sampled after two Wu-Hu-1 spike immunizations.","Sheward, Daniel J.; Mandolesi, Marco; Urgard, Egon; Kim, Changil; Hanke, Leo; Vidakovics, Laura Perez; Pankow, Alec; Smith, Natalie L.; Dopico, Xaquin Castro; McInerney, Gerald; Coquet, Jonathan M.; Hedestam, Gunilla B.

Sources of animal samples and molecular methods for the identification of novel viral pathogens and steps to determine their pathogenicity are listed. The difficulties for predicting future cross-species transmissions are highlighted by the wide diversity of known viral zoonoses. Recent surveys of viruses in wild and domesticated animals have characterized numerous viruses including some closely related to those infecting humans. The detection of multiple genetic lineages within viral families infecting a single host species, phylogenetically interspersed with viruses found in other host species, reflects frequent past cross-species transmissions. Numerous opportunities for the generation of novel vaccines will arise from a better understanding of animal viromes.","Delwart, Eric",Current Opinion in Virology,195,3

Changes of lopinavir pharmacokinetics in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) are a perfect illustration. Indeed, several studies described that total lopinavir plasma concentrations were considerably higher in patients with severe COVID‐19 than those reported in patients with HIV. These findings have led to a reduction of the dose of lopinavir in some patients, hypothesizing an inhibitory effect of inflammation on lopinavir metabolism. Unfortunately, changes in plasma protein binding were never investigated. We performed a retrospective cohort study. Data were collected from the medical records of patients hospitalized for COVID‐19 treated with lopinavir/ritonavir in intensive care units or infectious disease departments of Toulouse University Hospital (France). Total and unbound concentrations of lopinavir, C reactive protein, albumin, and alpha‐1‐acid glycoprotein (AAG) levels were measured during routine care on the same samples. In patients with COVID‐19, increased total lopinavir concentration is the result of an increased AAG‐bound lopinavir concentration, whereas the unbound concentration remains constant, and insufficient to reduce the severe acute respiratory syndrome‐coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) viral load. Although international guidelines have recently recommended against using lopinavir/ritonavir to treat severe COVID‐19, the description of lopinavir pharmacokinetics changes in COVID‐19 is a textbook case of the high risk of misinterpretation of a total drug exposure when changes in protein binding are not taken into consideration.","Stanke‐Labesque, Francoise; Concordet, Didier; Djerada, Zoubir; Bouchet, Stéphane; Solas, Caroline; Mériglier, Etienne; Bonnet, Fabrice; Mourvillier, Bruno; Ruiz, Stéphanie; Martin‐Blondel, Guillaume; Epaulard, Olivier; Schwebel, Carole; Gautier‐Veyret, Elodie; Gandia, Peggy",Clin Pharmacol Ther,195,0

Although the layout is an important design factor that affects interface aesthetics, whether it can trigger customer's aesthetic preferences in mobile marketing remains unexplored. To address this issue, we employ an empirical methodology of event-related potentials (EPR) in this study from the perspective of cognitive neuroscience and psychology. Subjects are presented with a series of mobile marketing interface images of different layouts with identical marketing content. Their EEG waves were recorded as they were required to distinguish a target stimulus from the others. After the experiment, each of the subjects chose five stimuli interfaces they like and five they dislike. By analyzing the ERP data derived from the EEG data and the behavioral data, we find significant differences between the disliked interfaces and the other interfaces in the ERP component of P2 from the frontal-central area in the 200–400 ms post-stimulus onset time window and LPP from both the frontal-central and parietal-occipital area in the 400–600 ms time window. The results support the hypothesis that humans do make rapid implicit aesthetic preferences for interface layouts and suggest that even under a free browsing context like the mobile marketing context, interface layouts that raise high emotional arousal can still attract more user attention and induce users' implicit aesthetic preference.","Wang, Shu; Xu, Chonghuan; Xiao, Liang; Ding, Austin Shijun",Front Hum Neurosci,195,30

We assessed: knowledge, attitudes, perceptions, and practices towards COVID-19 and face-mask use among 644 high risk-individuals in Kampala, Uganda. In data analysis, descriptive, bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses, with a 95% confidence interval were considered. Adjusted-odds ratios were used to determine the magnitude of associations. P-values < 0.05 were considered statistically-significant. Majority: 99.7% and 87.3% of the participants respectively had heard and believed that face-masks were protective against COVID-19, while 67.9% reported having received information on face-mask use. Males, food market vendors, those with no formal education, and those aged 24-33, 44-53 and 54-63 years were 0.58, 0.47, 0.25, 1.9, 2.12, and 3.39 times less likely to have received information about face-mask use respectively. Majority, 67.8% owned locally-made, non-medical face-masks, while 77.0% of face-mask owners believed that they knew the right procedure of wearing them. Those who had received information on face-mask use were 2.85 and 1.83 times more likely to own face-masks and to perceive them as protective. Food market vendors were 3.92 times more likely to re-use their face-masks.

AIM: To assess the impact of SARS‐CoV‐2 on workload and the perceptions of ID physicians regarding the national response in Australia and New Zealand in the pre‐pandemic. METHODS: A survey of ID physicians in Australia and New Zealand was undertaken from 3 to 10 March 2020. Respondents were asked to estimate time spent on SARS‐CoV‐2‐related activities in February and report their agreement with statements on a 5‐point Likert scale ranging from ‘strongly agree’ to ‘strongly disagree’. We also asked about the intended use of investigational agents. RESULTS: There were 214 respondents (36% of 600 eligible participants). The median workload due to SARS‐CoV‐2‐related activities was 34% of one full‐time equivalent (interquartile range 18–68%). Less than a quarter (50, 23%) of respondents had experience managing cases, while 33% (70) had experience preparing during similar pandemics. Nevertheless, 88% (188/213) believed they were well informed when giving testing and management advice, and 45% (95/212) believed their national response was well coordinated. Additionally, 41% (88/214) were worried about becoming infected through occupational exposure. Over half (116, 54%) the respondents intended to use lopinavir/ritonavir in confirmed cases of COVID‐19 with severe disease. CONCLUSIONS: ID physicians spent a large proportion of time on SARS‐CoV‐2‐related activities. Increased staffing is required to avoid burnout. Importantly, ID physicians feel well informed when giving advice. A national body should be established to co‐ordinate response. Treatment efficacy trials are needed to clarify the utility of unproven treatments.","Foley, David A.; Chew, Rusheng; Raby, Edward; Tong, Steven Y. C.; Davis, Joshua S.",Intern Med J,195,23

In this work, we investigate the dependency between a social isolation index and epidemiological metrics for several Brazilian cities. Classic statistical methods are employed to support the findings. As a first, initially surprising, result, we illustrate how there seems to be no apparent functional relationship between social isolation data and later effects on disease incidence. However, further investigations identified two regimes of successful employment of social isolation: as a preventive measure or as a remedy, albeit remedy measures require greater social isolation and bring higher burden to health systems.

According to National Cholesterol Education Program's Adult Treatment Panel III (NCEP-ATP III) criteria, MetS has six main components, which are obesity, dyslipidemia, raised blood pressure (BP), insulin resistance (IR) or glucose intolerance, pro-inflammatory state, and prothrombotic state. Vitamin D (Vit D) regulates the absorption of calcium and phosphorus and thus, is universally accepted as an essential vitamin for bone strength as well as a facilitator of immune system function. Vit D was also shown to reduce the risks of CVD, multiple sclerosis, and developing seasonal flu. We conducted a systematic review to identify the general association between Vit D level and MetS, to highlight specific associations between Vit D level and individual components of MetS, and finally, to explore the effects of Vit D supplementation on each component of MetS. In this paper, we reviewed 14 recent studies investigating the relationships between Vit D, MetS, and components of MetS. From the review of seven studies, we confirmed a significant association between Vit D and MetS as a whole. Four out of the five observational studies we reviewed support that Vit D level is significantly associated with the following components of MetS: obesity and BMI, dyslipidemia, BP, and insulin and glucose metabolism. We did not discover any significant relationship between Vit D level and other MetS components. The review of seven additional randomized clinical trials (RCT)-based studies suggest that Vit D supplementation has significant effects on BP, abdominal obesity, and insulin and glucose metabolism.","Theik, Nyein Wint Yee; Raji, Oluwatimilehin E; Shenwai, Priya; Shah, Rutul; Kalluri, Sahithi Reddy; Bhutta, Tinaz H; Hannoodee, Hanan; Al Khalili, Mahmoud; Khan, Safeera",Cureus,195,16

In the present study, the existence of 39 non-antimicrobial PACs and six of their metabolites in wastewater from hospitals and adjacent surface waters in Sri Lanka was investigated from 2016-2018. The highest amount of the measured chemicals, including the highest concentrations of atorvastatin (14,620 ng/L) and two metabolites, mefenamic acid (12,120 ng/L) and o-desmethyl tramadol (8,700 ng/L), were detected in wastewater from the largest facility. Mefenamic acid, gemfibrozil, losartan, cetirizine, carbamazepine, and phenytoin were detected in all the samples. The removal rates in wastewater treatment were 100% for zolpidem, norsertaline, quetiapine, chlorpromazine, and alprazolam. There was substantial variation in removal rates of PACs among facilities, and the overall data suggest that treatment processes in facilities were ineffective and that some PAC concentrations in the effluents were increased. The estimated risk quotients revealed that 14 PACs detected in water samples could pose low to high ecological risk to various aquatic organisms. Compounds such as ibuprofen, tramadol, and chlorpromazine detected in untreated and treated wastewater at these facilities pose a high risk to several aquatic organisms. This study provides novel monitoring data for non-antimicrobial PAC abundance and the associated potential ecological risk related to hospitals and urban surface waters in Sri Lanka and further offers invaluable information on pre-COVID-19 era PAC distribution in the country.
