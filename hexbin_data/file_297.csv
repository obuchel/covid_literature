1472,1472,1472,Is boosting the immune system in sepsis appropriate?,19.623045,11.598783,2014-03-24,"A relative immunosuppression is observed in patients after sepsis, trauma, burns, or any severe insults. It is currently proposed that selected patients will benefit from treatment aimed at boosting their immune systems. However, the host immune response needs to be considered in context with pathogen-type, timing, and mainly tissue specificity. Indeed, the immune status of leukocytes is not universally decreased and their activated status in tissues contributes to organ failure. Accordingly, any new immune-stimulatory therapeutic intervention should take into consideration potentially deleterious effects in some situations.","Cavaillon, Jean-Marc; Eisen, Damon; Annane, Djilalli",Crit Care,297,12

This study analyzed the association between medical outcomes related to the use of assist-control (A/C) and SIMV + PSV in an intensive care unit. In this observational and retrospective study, modes of ventilation and medical data were collected from electronic medical records for three consecutive years and were related to medical outcomes (mortality), duration of mechanical ventilation, length of hospital stay and the need for tracheostomy. Participants were divided into groups according to the modes of ventilation: A/C and SIMV + PSV. Statistical analyses were performed in the R environment. Alpha = 0.05. The using chi-square, Fisher’s exact, Mann–Whitney and Kruskal–Wallis tests were used. 345 adult participants were included; 211/345 (61.16%) were males. Of the participants, 151/345 (43.77%) were on SIMV + PSV and 194/345 (56.23%) were on A/C. The comparative analysis between the modes of ventilation showed no significant differences in length of hospital stay (p = 0.675), duration of mechanical ventilation (p = 0.952), mortality (p = 0.241), failed extubation (p = 0.411) and the need for tracheostomy (p = 0.301).

Rethinking the Inflammatory Model?,19.77853,11.771119,2021-03-15,"Chronic graft rejection remains a significant barrier to solid organ transplantation as a treatment for end-organ failure. Patients receiving organ transplants typically require systemic immunosuppression in the form of pharmacological immunosuppressants for the duration of their lives, leaving these patients vulnerable to opportunistic infections, malignancies, and other use-restricting side-effects. In recent years, a substantial amount of research has focused on the use of cell-based therapies for the induction of graft tolerance. Inducing or adoptively transferring regulatory cell types, including regulatory T cells, myeloid-derived suppressor cells, and IL-10 secreting B cells, has the potential to produce graft-specific tolerance in transplant recipients. Significant progress has been made in the optimization of these cell-based therapeutic strategies as our understanding of their underlying mechanisms increases and new immunoengineering technologies become more widely available. Still, many questions remain to be answered regarding optimal cell types to use, appropriate dosage and timing, and adjuvant therapies. In this review, we summarize what is known about the cellular mechanisms that underly the current cell-based therapies being developed for the prevention of allograft rejection, the different strategies being explored to optimize these therapies, and all of the completed and ongoing clinical trials involving these therapies.","Oberholtzer, Nathaniel; Atkinson, Carl; Nadig, Satish N.",Front Immunol,297,12
16650,16650,16650,Mechanical ventilation preserves diaphragm mitochondrial function in a rat sepsis model,19.55381,11.4259,2021-04-07,"BACKGROUND: Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is one of the most relevant viruses affecting the poultry industry, and several studies have investigated the factors involved in its biological cycle and evolution. However, very few of those studies focused on the effect of genome composition and the codon bias of different IBV proteins, despite the remarkable increase in available complete genomes. In the present study, all IBV complete genomes were downloaded (n = 383), and several statistics representative of genome composition and codon bias were calculated for each protein-coding sequence, including but not limited to, the nucleotide odds ratio, relative synonymous codon usage and effective number of codons. Additionally, viral codon usage was compared to host codon usage based on a collection of highly expressed genes in IBV target and nontarget tissues. RESULTS: The results obtained demonstrated a significant difference among structural, non-structural and accessory proteins, especially regarding dinucleotide composition, which appears under strong selective forces. In particular, some dinucleotide pairs, such as CpG, a probable target of the host innate immune response, are underrepresented in genes coding for pp1a, pp1ab, S and N. Although genome composition and dinucleotide bias appear to affect codon usage, additional selective forces may act directly on codon bias. Variability in relative synonymous codon usage and effective number of codons was found for different proteins, with structural proteins and polyproteins being more adapted to the codon bias of host target tissues. In contrast, accessory proteins had a more biased codon usage (i.e., lower number of preferred codons), which might contribute to the regulation of their expression level and timing throughout the cell cycle. CONCLUSIONS: The present study confirms the existence of selective forces acting directly on the genome and not only indirectly through phenotype selection. This evidence might help understanding IBV biology and in developing attenuated strains without affecting the protein phenotype and therefore immunogenicity.

Pre-B-cell leukemia homeobox (Pbx)-regulating protein-1 (PREP1) is a ubiquitous homeodomain transcription factor involved in the adipogenic differentiation and insulin-sensitivity processes. Leptin, as pleiotropic adipokine, and TGF-β, known to be expressed by primary pre-adipocytes [adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs)] and mature differentiated adipocytes, modulate inflammatory responses. We aimed to assess for the first time if leptin and TGF-β interfere with PREP1 expression in both ASCs and mature differentiated adipocytes. Human ASCs were isolated from subcutaneous adipose liposuction and, after expansion, fully differentiated to mature adipocytes. In both ASCs and adipocytes, leptin and TGF-β1 significantly decreased the expression of PREP1, alone and following concurrent Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) activation. Moreover, in adipocytes, but not in ASCs, leptin increased TLR4 and IL-33 expression, whereas TGF-β1 enhanced TLR4 and IL-6 expression. Taken together, we provide evidence for a direct regulation of PREP1 by leptin and TGF-β1 in ASCs and mature adipocytes. The effects of leptin and TGF-β1 on immune receptors and cytokines, however, are limited to mature adipocytes, suggesting that modulating immune responses depends on the differentiation of ASCs. Further studies are needed to fully understand the regulation of PREP1 expression and its potential for the development of new therapeutic approaches in obesity-related diseases.","Bruno, Andreina; Di Sano, Caterina; Simon, Hans-Uwe; Chanez, Pascal; Patti, Angelo Maria; Di Vincenzo, Serena; Dino, Paola; D’Esposito, Vittoria; Formisano, Pietro; Beguinot, Francesco; Pace, Elisabetta",Front Cell Dev Biol,297,12

In line with international trends, science education in Hong Kong has undergone considerable changes in the last decade since the implementation of the revised junior secondary science curriculum (grades 7–9) (Curriculum Development Council [CDC], 1998). The new curriculum encourages teachers to conduct scientific investigations in their classes, advocates scientific investigation as a desired means of learning scientific knowledge, and highlights the development of inquiry practices and generic skills such as collaboration and communication. Most importantly, it was the first local science curriculum that embraced understanding of nature of science (NOS), for example, being “able to appreciate and understand the evolutionary nature of scientific knowledge” (CDC, 1998, p. 3) was stated as one of its broad curriculum aims. In the first topic, “What is science?”, teachers are expected to discuss with students some features about science, for example, its scope and limitations, some typical features about scientific investigations, for example, fair testing, control of variables, predictions, hypothesis, inferences, and conclusions. Such an emphasis on NOS was further supported in the revised secondary 4 and 5 (grade 10 and 11) physics, chemistry, and biology curricula (CDC, 2002). Scientific investigation continued to be an important component while the scope of NOS was slightly extended to include recognition of the usefulness and limitations of science as well as the interactions between science, technology, and society (STS).","Wong, Siu Ling; Wan, Zhihong; Cheng, Maurice Man Wai",Socio-scientific Issues in the Classroom,297,12

In the same year, 47 neonates out of 1000 live births were not surviving in the first 28 days of age in the Amhara region, Ethiopia. Despite the highest burden of neonatal death in the region, specific or the proximate determinants of neonatal death in the neonatal intensive care unit were not well identified. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to identify the determinants of neonatal mortality at neonatal intensive care unit in Dessie Referral Hospital, Northeast Ethiopia. METHODS: An institution-based unmatched case-control study was conducted on neonates admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit of Dessie Referral Hospital, from January 1, 2016, to December 30, 2017. A total of 390 charts (130 cases and 260 controls) were selected by simple random sampling technique. The data were abstracted from the facility-based data abstraction form. A binary logistic regression analysis was fitted to identify the determinants of neonatal mortality. RESULTS: Pregnancy-induced hypertension (AOR = 4.57; 95% CI 1.45–14.43), prolonged rupture of membrane (AOR = 2.04; 95% CI 1.13–3.68), very low birth weight (AOR = 7.00; 95% CI 2.10–23.35), and low birth weight (AOR = 2.12; 95% CI 1.10–4.20) were identified factors. Moreover, respiratory distress syndrome (AOR = 3.61; 95% CI 1.10–12.04), perinatal asphyxia (AOR = 2.27; 95% CI 1.18–4.39), meconium aspiration syndrome (AOR = 2.35; 95% CI 1.12–4.97), and infection (AOR = 2.26; 95% CI 1.34–3.82) were also significantly associated with neonatal death. CONCLUSIONS: Pregnancy-induced hypertension, prolonged rupture of membrane, low birth weight, respiratory distress syndrome, perinatal asphyxia, meconium aspiration syndrome, and infections were the major determinants of neonatal mortality. Therefore, special attention will be given to small and sick babies. Moreover, early anticipation of complications and management of mothers who had pregnancy-induced hypertension and prolonged rupture of the membrane would save neonates.","Alemu, Abebaw Yeshambel; Belay, Getaneh Mulualem; Berhanu, Mengistu; Minuye, Biniam",Trop Med Health,297,12

We have attempted to reconstruct the biogeographical structure according to functional traits and the evolutionary lineage of B. amyloliquefaciens using comparative genomics analysis. All the available 96 genomes of B. amyloliquefaciens strains were curated from the NCBI genome database, having a variety of important functionalities in all sectors keeping a high focus on agricultural aspects. In-depth analysis was carried out to deduce the orthologous gene groups and whole-genome similarity. Pan genome analysis revealed that shell genes, soft core genes, core genes, and cloud genes comprise 17.09, 5.48, 8.96, and 68.47%, respectively, which demonstrates that genomes are very different in the gene content. It also indicates that the strains may have flexible environmental adaptability or versatile functions. Phylogenetic analysis showed that B. amyloliquefaciens is divided into two clades, and clade 2 is further dived into two different clusters. This reflects the difference in the sequence similarity and diversification that happened in the B. amyloliquefaciens genome. The majority of plant-associated strains of B. amyloliquefaciens were grouped in clade 2 (73 strains), while food-associated strains were in clade 1 (23 strains). Genome mining has been adopted to deduce antimicrobial resistance and virulence genes and their prevalence among all strains. The genes tmrB and yuaB codes for tunicamycin resistance protein and hydrophobic coat forming protein only exist in clade 2, while clpP, which codes for serine proteases, is only in clade 1. Genome plasticity of all strains of B. amyloliquefaciens reflects their adaption to different niches.","Liu, Hualin; Prajapati, Vimalkumar; Prajapati, Shobha; Bais, Harsh; Lu, Jianguo",Front Genet,297,5

Our objective was to determine the risk factors for breakthrough SARS-CoV-2 infection among HCWs at a national healthcare system in Qatar. METHODS We identified all HCWs at Hamad Medical Corporation in Qatar between December 20, 2020 and May 18, 2021 with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR infection >14 days after the second vaccine dose. For each case thus identified, we identified one control with a negative test after December 20, 2020, matched on age, sex, nationality, job family and date of SARS-CoV-2 testing. We excluded those with a prior positive test and temporary workers. We used Cox regression analysis to determine factors associated with breakthrough infection. RESULTS Among 22,247 fully vaccinated HCW, we identified 164 HCW who had breakthrough infection and matched them to 164 controls to determine the factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 breakthrough infection. In the breakthrough infection group the nursing and midwifery job family constituted the largest group, spouse was identified as the most common positive contact followed by a patient. Exposure to a confirmed case, presence of symptoms and all other job families except Allied Health Professionals when compared with nursing and Midwifery staff independently predicted infection. CONCLUSION Presence of symptoms and contact with a confirmed case are major risk factors for breakthrough SARS-CoV-2 infection after vaccination, and these groups should be prioritized for screening even after full vaccination.","Alishaq, Moza; Nafady-Hego, Hanaa; Jeremijenko, Andrew; Al Ajmi, Jameela Ali; Elgendy, Mohamed; Vinoy, Suni; Fareh, Sameera Bihi; Veronica Plaatjies, Justine; Nooh, Mariam; Alanzi, Nadya; Kaleeckal, Anvar H; Latif, Ali Nizar; Coyle, Peter; Elgendy, Hamed; Abou-Samra, Abdul-Badi; Butt, Adeel Ajwad",PloS one,297,24

To our knowledge, there are no studies exploring experiences after second-degree tear. Therefore, our study aimed to investigate the experiences of a second-degree vaginal tear regarding aspects of the recovery and need for healthcare and rehabilitation. METHODS Individual semi-structured interviews were performed and analysed with a qualitative, inductive descriptive approach. RESULTS A group of 18 women with a second-degree vaginal tear after delivery were included. Four main categories with associated subcategories were found: (1) feeling uncertainty, with subcategories: not knowing what is normal, concern, confusion and uncertainty regarding pelvic floor muscle training; (2) feeling of security, with subcategories: I have no/I can handle the symptoms, trust in the healthcare system and I have sufficient knowledge; (3) not prioritizing myself, with the subcategories: I cannot find time and others have bigger problems; (4) lack of trust in healthcare providers, with the subcategories: feeling forgotten, not being taken seriously, distrust of the competence of the healthcare providers and resignation. CONCLUSION Women who suffer from a second-degree vaginal tear after pregnancy can feel safe when needs are met but uncertainty is also common when available healthcare and information are perceived as insufficient. The women also feel uncertainty about what is normal after the tear and how to perform pelvic floor exercises.

However, confirmatory in-vitro phantom studies have thus far been lacking. PURPOSE To evaluate the difference in signal intensity achieved with the high-relaxivity MR contrast agent gadobenate dimeglumine (MultiHance) relative to that achieved with the standard-relaxivity non-specific agent gadopentetate dimeglumine (Magnevist) at different concentrations using an in-vitro phantom study design. MATERIAL AND METHODS Test tubes with whole human blood were prepared with concentrations of gadobenate dimeglumine or gadopentetate dimeglumine ranging from 0 to 12 mM. A three-dimensional (3D) T1-weighted gradient echo sequence normally used for CE-MRA of the renal arteries was performed at flip angles of 25° and 35°. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) was calculated for all concentrations of both contrast agents. Furthermore a Look-Locker sequence was used and quantitative T1 mapping was performed for all the test tubes. The contrast agent concentration in the aorta was simulated using previously published data on T1 in the aorta during the first pass of a contrast agent. The differences between gadobenate dimeglumine and gadopentetate dimeglumine were compared at the simulated concentrations. RESULTS The SNR achieved with gadobenate dimeglumine was consistently greater than that achieved with gadopentetate dimeglumine at all concentrations. An improvement of 15-25% in SNR was obtained when increasing the flip angle from 25° to 35°. The relative improvement in SNR with gadobenate dimeglumine relative to gadopentetate dimeglumine ranged from 25-72% and was markedly greater at lower concentrations with a flip angle of 35°. CONCLUSION Our findings suggest that the relative benefit of gadobenate dimeglumine over gadopentetate dimeglumine for CE-MRA applications is greater at lower concentrations.","Johansson, Lars; Kirchin, Miles A; Ahlström, Håkan",Acta radiologica,297,1

Methods We retrospectively reviewed the charts of patients who between July 2012 and September 2015, were diagnosed as having benign uterine disease such as uterine myoma, endometriosis, or adenomyosis and managed via NAVH or LAVH in a single-center (Eulji University Hospital). Data such as age, body weight, height, parity, operation time, intra/post-operative complications, and uterus weight were obtained from the clinical charts. NAVH and LAVH recipients were matched 1:3 in terms of baseline characteristics, and the 2 groups were compared regarding surgical outcomes. Results Of the 160 patients with benign uterine disease included in the present study. Forty received NAVH and remaining 120 received LAVH. There were significant differences between the groups regarding operation time and hemoglobin change. Notably, although the operation time was shorter for LAVH, hemoglobin change was lower for NAVH. Additionally, although maximum hospitalization duration was shorter for LAVH, the average length of hospitalization was similar between NAVH and LAVH. There were no significant differences between the groups in terms of other variables. Conclusion NAVH may become a new alternative surgical method of choice for hysterectomy, as it represents a clinically feasible and safe approach; moreover is superior to LAVH in terms of bleeding loss.","Kim, Seong Hee; Jin, Chan Hee; Hwang, In Taek; Park, Jun Sook; Shin, Jung Hwan; Kim, Dae Woon; Seo, Yong Soo; Sohn, Jee Nah; Yang, Yun Seok",Obstetrics & gynecology science,297,27

The infection requires lifelong clinical management and is a leading risk factor for liver cancer and liver cirrhosis. Limited studies currently exist on the social impacts of living with chronic hepatitis B, especially for people from Sub-Saharan Africa. The current study explored the experiences of South Sudanese people living with chronic hepatitis B in Australia. Methods: A qualitative inquiry using face-to-face interviews with fifteen South Sudanese people with chronic hepatitis B in Australia explored the social impacts of living with chronic hepatitis B. The study purposively sampled participants who self-identified as South Sudanese with hepatitis B and over 18 years of age. Interviews were coded and analysed using thematic analysis. Results: The study identified three themes relating to the experiences of living with chronic hepatitis B, and were grouped into psychological, interpersonal and healthcare system levels. Psychological level experiences related to the uncertainty of living with chronic hepatitis B and liver cancer risk, where participants expressed persistent fear of disease progression and anxiety around death related to the disease. Interpersonal level experiences involved the disclosure of hepatitis B and its social impacts including stigma, social distancing and isolation. Healthcare system level experiences included receiving mixed messages about hepatitis B, challenges with regular testing and difficulty receiving hepatitis B treatment. Conclusion: The findings provide valuable insights into the social impacts of hepatitis B. It underlines the importance of integrated public health interventions at the community level to improve knowledge and awareness of hepatitis B which address stigma in the South Sudanese community in Australia.","Mude, William W; Fisher, Christopher M; Richmond, Jacqui; Gautier, Roslyn Le; Wallace, Jack",Ethnicity & health,297,1

Both guidelines recommend adapting management for older patients with complex health conditions, without however clear indications on how to adapt. Our aims were to assess the impact of lowering BP thresholds on the prevalence of elevated BP and BP control, as well as the proportion of participants with a complex health condition across these BP categories. We used data from 3210 participants in the Lausanne cohort Lc65+ aged between 67 and 80 years. Hypertension diagnosis and antihypertensive medication use were self-reported. BP was measured three times at one visit. Some 51% of participants reported having hypertension and 44% reported taking antihypertensive medication. Compared with ESC/ESH thresholds, the prevalence of measured elevated BP was 24% percentage points higher and BP control was 24% percentage points lower using ACC/AHA thresholds. About one out of two participants with elevated BP and four out of five participants with uncontrolled BP had a complex health condition, i.e., frailty, multimorbidity, or polypharmacy. To comply with ACC/AHA guidelines, considerable effort would be required to reach BP control. This is a serious challenge because a large share of hypertensive older adults has complex health conditions, a type of patients for whom there is no strong evidence on how to manage hypertension.","Anker, Daniela; Santos-Eggimann, Brigitte; Zwahlen, Marcel; Santschi, Valérie; Rodondi, Nicolas; Wolfson, Christina; Chiolero, Arnaud",Journal of human hypertension,297,12

Infection of transgenic IL-10/green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter mice revealed that CNS-infiltrating T cells were the major source of IL-10, with minimal IL-10 production by macrophages and resident microglia. The proportions of IL-10-producing cells were initially similar in CD8(+) and CD4(+) T cells but diminished rapidly in CD8(+) T cells as the virus was controlled. Overall, the majority of IL-10-producing CD8(+) T cells were specific for the immunodominant major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I epitope. Unlike CD8(+) T cells, a large proportion of CD4(+) T cells within the CNS retained IL-10 production throughout persistence. Furthermore, elevated frequencies of IL-10-producing CD4(+) T cells in the spinal cord supported preferential maintenance of IL-10 production at the site of viral persistence and tissue damage. IL-10 was produced primarily by the CD25(+) CD4(+) T cell subset during acute infection but prevailed in CD25(-) CD4(+) T cells during the transition to persistent infection and thereafter. Overall, these data demonstrate significant fluidity in the T-cell-mediated IL-10 response during viral encephalitis and persistence. While IL-10 production by CD8(+) T cells was limited primarily to the time of acute effector function, CD4(+) T cells continued to produce IL-10 throughout infection. Moreover, a shift from predominant IL-10 production by CD25(+) CD4(+) T cells to CD25(-) CD4(+) T cells suggests that a transition to nonclassical regulatory T cells precedes and is retained during CNS viral persistence.","Puntambekar, Shweta S; Bergmann, Cornelia C; Savarin, Carine; Karp, Christopher L; Phares, Timothy W; Parra, Gabriel I; Hinton, David R; Stohlman, Stephen A",Journal of virology,297,20

More recently, the strain of the global COVID-19 pandemic on hospital resources has forced many units to alter the timing of interval surgery and extend the number of neoadjuvant chemotherapy cycles. In order to support this paradigm shift and provide more accurate counseling during these unprecedented times, we investigated the survival outcomes in advanced epithelial ovarian cancer patients with the intent of maximal cytoreduction following neoadjuvant chemotherapy with respect to timing of surgery and degree of cytoreduction. METHODS A retrospective review of all patients aged 18 years and above with FIGO (2014) stage III/IV epithelial ovarian cancer treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy and the intention of interval cytoreduction surgery between January 2008 and December 2017 was conducted. Overall and progression-free survival outcomes were analyzed and compared with patients who only received chemotherapy. Outcome measures were correlated with the number of neoadjuvant chemotherapy cycles and amount of residual disease following surgery. RESULTS Six hundred and seventy-one patients (median age 67 (range 20-91) years) were included in the study with 572 patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy and surgery and 99 patients with chemotherapy only. There was no difference in the proportion of patients in whom complete cytoreduction was achieved based on number of cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (2-4 cycles: 67.7%, n=337/498); ≥5 cycles: 62.2%, n=46/74). Patients undergoing cytoreduction surgery after neoadjuvant chemotherapy had a median 5-year progression-free and overall survival of 24 and 38 months, respectively. No significant difference in overall survival between surgical groups was observed (interval cytoreduction: 41 months vs delayed cytoreduction: 43 months, p=0.52). Those who achieved complete cytoreduction to R0 (no macroscopic disease) had a significant median overall survival advantage compared with those with any macroscopic residual disease (R0: 49-51 months vs R<1: 22-39 months, p<0.001 vs R≥1: 23-26 months, p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS Survival outcomes do not appear to be worse for patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy if cytoreduction surgery is delayed beyond three cycles. In advanced epithelial ovarian cancer patients the imperative to achieve complete surgical cytoreduction remains gold standard, irrespective of surgical timing, for best survival benefit.","Yao, Shih-Ern; Tripcony, Lee; Sanday, Karen; Robertson, Jessica; Perrin, Lewis; Chetty, Naven; Land, Russell; Garrett, Andrea; Obermair, Andreas; Nascimento, Marcelo; Tang, Amy; Jagasia, Nisha; Singh, Piksi; Nicklin, Jim",International journal of gynecological cancer : official journal of the International Gynecological Cancer Society,297,28

CHB-related serology has been extensively studied, but reports on immune-cell profiles of anti-Ro/La-exposed neonates are lacking. In the current study, we characterised circulating immune-cell populations in anti-Ro/La+mothers and newborns, and explored potential downstream effects of skewed neonatal cell populations. METHODS In total, blood from mothers (n=43) and neonates (n=66) was sampled at birth from anti-Ro/La+ (n=36) and control (n=30) pregnancies with or without rheumatic disease and CHB. Flow cytometry, microarrays and ELISA were used for characterising cells and plasma. RESULTS Similar to non-pregnant systemic lupus erythematosus and Sjögren-patients, anti-Ro/La+mothers had altered B-cell subset frequencies, relative T-cell lymphopenia and lower natural killer (NK)-cell frequencies. Surprisingly, their anti-Ro/La exposed neonates presented higher frequencies of CD56dimCD16hi NK cells (p<0.01), but no other cell frequency differences compared with controls. Type I and II interferon (IFN) gene-signatures were revealed in neonates of anti-Ro/La+ pregnancy, and exposure of fetal cardiomyocytes to type I IFN induced upregulation of several NK-cell chemoattractants and activating ligands. Intracellular flow cytometry revealed IFNγ production by NK cells, CD8+ and CD4+ T cells in anti-Ro/La exposed neonates. IFNγ was also detectable in their plasma. CONCLUSION Our study demonstrates an increased frequency of NK cells in anti-Ro/La exposed neonates, footprints of type I and II IFN and an upregulation of ligands activating NK cells in fetal cardiac cells after type I IFN exposure. These novel observations demonstrate innate immune activation in neonates of anti-Ro/La+pregnancy, which could contribute to the risk of CHB.","Ivanchenko, Margarita; Thorlacius, Gudny Ella; Hedlund, Malin; Ottosson, Vijole; Meneghel, Lauro; Björkander, Sophia; Ossoinak, Amina; Tingström, Joanna; Bremme, Katarina; Sverremark-Ekström, Eva; Gemzell-Danielsson, Kristina; Sonesson, Sven-Erik; Chemin, Karine; Wahren-Herlenius, Marie",Annals of the rheumatic diseases,297,1

The extent to which repeated doses of ketamine (versus placebo) reduce depression in the short and long term among outpatients with TRD and chronic, current suicidal ideation remains unknown. METHODS Twenty-six medicated outpatients with severe major depressive disorder with current, chronic suicidal ideation were randomized in a double-blind fashion to six ketamine infusions (0.5 mg/kg over 45 minutes) or saline placebo over three weeks. Depression and suicidal ideation were assessed at baseline, 240 min post-infusion, and during a three-month follow-up phase. RESULTS During the infusion phase, there was no differences in depression severity or suicidal ideation between placebo and ketamine (p = 0.47 and p = 0.32, respectively). At the end of the infusion phase, two patients in the ketamine group and one in the placebo group met criteria for remission of depression. At three-month follow-up, two patients in each group met criteria for remission from depression. LIMITATIONS Limitations include the small sample size, uncontrolled outpatient medication regimens, and restriction to outpatients, which may have resulted in lower levels of suicidal ideation than would be seen in emergency or inpatient settings. CONCLUSIONS Repeated, non-escalating doses of ketamine did not outperform placebo in this double-blind, placebo controlled study of patients with severe TRD and current, chronic suicidal ideation. This result may support our previously published open-label data that, in this severely and chronically ill outpatient population, the commonly used dose of 0.5 mg/kg is not sufficient.","Ionescu, Dawn F; Bentley, Kate H; Eikermann, Matthias; Taylor, Norman; Akeju, Oluwaseun; Swee, Michaela B; Pavone, Kara J; Petrie, Samuel R; Dording, Christina; Mischoulon, David; Alpert, Jonathan E; Brown, Emery N; Baer, Lee; Nock, Matthew K; Fava, Maurizio; Cusin, Cristina",Journal of affective disorders,297,24

Overdose of monensin can cause animal poisoning or even death. Monensin poisoning is rare in humans, and there is no effective detoxification protocol in clinical treatment. OBJECTIVE We report here two cases of monensin-induced rhabdomyolysis and hepatotoxicity by oral ingestion. The two patients were a couple and both were admitted to the hospital due to oral ingestion of monensin 5 days prior. Patient 1, with a past history of chronic bronchitis and hypertension, presented with severe rhabdomyolysis, hepatotoxicity, and hypoxemia. After treatment with fluid replacement and alkalinization of urine, his condition deteriorated the next day and irreversible cardiopulmonary arrest occurred. Patient 2 was diabetic and using oral hypoglycemic drugs and had obvious rhabdomyolysis from the fifth day of admission. After treatment with fluid replacement, urine alkalization, and continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT), the patient recovered and was discharged 1 month later. DISCUSSION The ingestion of monensin can lead to life-threatening toxicity, with rhabdomyolysis and hepatotoxicity as the main manifestations. Comprehensive treatment including CRRT in the early stage of rhabdomyolysis may improve the condition and prognosis.","Zhang, Zhiqiang; Cui, Shuqing; Zhang, Jinying",Toxicology and industrial health,297,0

Whilst the recent successes of chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapies for haematological malignancies are widely known, they have yet to show great success in solid cancers. However, immune cells transduced with T-cell receptors have been shown to traffic to and exert anti-cancer effects on solid tumour cells with some great successes. In this review, we explore the field of transgenic T-cell receptor immunotherapy, highlighting some of the key clinical trials which have paved the way for this type of cellular immunotherapy. Some trials have shown amazing clinical results, including long-term remissions and minimal toxicity, and can be looked at as an exemplar for this adoptive cell therapy. There have also been key trials where unexpected, fatal, off-tumour toxicity has occurred, and these trials have also been instrumental in shaping safer clinical trials, particularly regarding preclinical testing. In addition to previous trials, we analysed the current clinical trial space for T-cell receptor T-cell therapy, showing which trials are dominating in the clinic and which targets are being prioritised by researchers around the world. By looking at both past and current trials, we have been able to identify key drivers in developing transgenic T-cell receptor immunotherapy for the future.","Oppermans, Natasha; Kueberuwa, Gray; Hawkins, Robert E; Bridgeman, John S",Therapeutic advances in vaccines and immunotherapy,297,19

This study aimed to clarify whether the research evidence on the efficacy of telehealth-delivered substance use disorder treatment and the experience of providers using telehealth during the pandemic support continued use of telehealth after the pandemic and, if so, under what circumstances. METHODS Data sources included a literature review on the efficacy of telehealth for substance use disorder treatment, responses to a 2020 online survey from 100 California addiction treatment providers, and interviews with 30 California treatment providers and other stakeholders. RESULTS Eight published studies were identified that compared addiction treatment via telehealth with in-person treatment. Seven found telehealth treatment as effective but not more effective than in-person treatment in terms of retention, therapeutic alliance, and substance use. One Canadian study found that telehealth facilitated methadone prescribing and improved retention. In the survey results reported here, California addiction treatment providers said that more than 50% of their patients were being treated via telehealth for intensive outpatient treatment, individual counseling, group counseling, and intake assessment. They were most confident that individual counseling via telehealth was as effective as in-person individual counseling and less sure about the relative effectiveness of telehealth-delivered medication management, group counseling, and intake assessments.

METHODS Thresholds of hypoxia were determined from mean values of TOI using sequential Χ2 tests and used alongside thresholds from existing literature to calculate percentage of time in hypoxia and burden of hypoxia below each threshold. These indices were then compared between IVH groups. RESULTS 44 infants were studied for a median of 18.5 (range 6-21) hours in the first 24 hours of life.

We also search Literature in order to identify the main CV manifestations in patients occurring virus infection and their management by cardiologists. EXPERT OPINION Specific treatments for CV involvement associated with COVID-19 are still debated. Results from ongoing trials are needed to further clarify issues about the therapeutic approach, which is constantly changing according the continuous flow of published evidences. Finally, it seems necessary to sensitize all population to raise awareness on CV diseases in COVID era, to hinder underestimation of both new-onset acute CV diseases and consequences of chronic mistreated CV diseases.","Capone, Valentina; Cuomo, Vittoria; Esposito, Roberta; Canonico, Mario Enrico; Ilardi, Federica; Prastaro, Maria; Esposito, Giovanni; Santoro, Ciro",Expert review of cardiovascular therapy,297,16

Influenza virus, despite causing approximately one billion annual infections globally, has only a few cases of confirmed or suspected intrauterine fetal infections reported. RSV is in an unusual cause of illness among pregnant women, and with the exception of one premature infant with congenital pneumonia, no other cases of maternal-fetal infection are described. Parainfluenza virus and human metapneumovirus can produce symptomatic maternal infections but do not cause intrauterine fetal infection. In summary, it appears that the absence thus far of maternal-fetal transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus during the COVID-19 pandemic is similar to other coronaviruses, and is also consistent with the extreme rarity of suggested or confirmed cases of intrauterine transmission of other respiratory RNA viruses. This observation has important consequences for pregnant women as it appears that if intrauterine transmission of SARSCoV-2 does eventually occur, it will be a rare event. Potential mechanisms of fetal protection from maternal viral infections are also discussed.","Schwartz, David A; Dhaliwal, Amareen",Archives of pathology & laboratory medicine,297,19

Sepsis accounts for mortality for almost 50% of global children under 5 years of age.Over the past 50 years, there have been many advances in the diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of neonatal infections. The diagnostic advances include better culture techniques that permit more rapid confirmation of the diagnosis, advent of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to rapidly diagnose viral infections, use of biologic markers indicating evidence of infection, and a better understanding of immunoglobulin markers of infection. From a therapeutic stand point, there have been a variety of antibiotics, antifungals, and antiviral agents, better approaches to prevent sepsis, specific immunotherapy, for example, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV); bundled approach to prevention of deep-line infection and better antibiotic stewardship, leading to earlier discontinuation of antibiotic therapy.Hand hygiene remains the benchmark and gold standard for late-onset sepsis prevention. The challenge has been that each decade, newer resistant bacteria dominate as the cause of sepsis and newer viruses emerge, for example, human immunodeficiency virus, zika virus, and novel coronavirus disease 2019.Future treatment options might include stem cell therapy, other antimicrobial protein and peptides, and targeting of pattern recognition receptors in an effort to prevent and/or treat sepsis in this vulnerable population. Also, the microbiome of premature infants has a smaller proportion of beneficial bacteria and higher numbers of pathogenic bacteria compared with term infants, likely owing to higher frequencies of cesarean sections, antibiotic use, exposure to the hospital environment, and feeding nonhuman milk products. Modifying the microbiome with more mother's milk and shorter duration of antibiotics in noninfected babies should be a goal. KEY POINTS: · Neonatal sepsis remains a leading cause of mortality.. · Challenges include bacterial resistance and newer viruses.. · Future treatments may include newer antibiotics/antivirals and stem cell therapy..","Fanaroff, Avroy A; Fanaroff, Jonathan M",American journal of perinatology,297,17

Little is known about the relationship between circadian rhythm and sepsis in humans. We aimed to investigate circadian variations in the host response in a human endotoxaemia model. DESIGN AND METHODS A cross-over study, where 12 healthy young men received E. coli endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide, LPS) 0.3 ng/kg at 12 noon and, on another day, at 12 midnight. Blood samples were analysed for pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines: tumour-necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, soluble TNF receptors (sTNF-R)-1 and -2, interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra), IL-6, and IL-10 as well as YKL-40 and the oxidative stress markers malondialdehyde (MDA), ascorbic acid (AA) and dehydroascorbic acid (DHA) before and at 2, 4, 6 and 8 hours after LPS administration. RESULTS The levels of MDA and IL-10 where significantly higher during the day time (P<0.05) whereas levels of TNF-alpha, sTNF-RI, sTNF-RII, IL-1Ra, IL-6, and YKL-40 were higher (P<0.01 for all comparisons) during the night time. No significant differences were seen in the levels of AA and DHA. CONCLUSION A day-night difference in the acute phase response to endotoxaemia exists in healthy volunteers with a more pronounced inflammatory response during the night time. This circadian difference in the response to endotoxaemia may play an important role in the clinical setting and should be investigated further.","Alamili, Mahdi; Bendtzen, Klaus; Lykkesfeldt, Jens; Rosenberg, Jacob; Gögenur, Ismail",PloS one,297,8

Currently available polysaccharide-protein conjugate vaccines are mainly T cell dependent and are usually ineffective in weakened immune systems. In this study, laminarin, a well-characterized β-1,3-glucan, was conjugated with a prokaryotically expressed recombinant fragment (amino acids [aa] 39 to 272) of calreticulin (rCRT/39-272), which exhibits extraordinarily potent immunogenicity and adjuvanticity in experimental animals. The resultant conjugate reserves the immunostimulatory effect of rCRT/39-272 on naïve murine B cells and is capable of eliciting anti-β-glucan IgG (mostly IgG1) responses in not only BALB/c mice but also athymic nude mice. Laminarin-CRT-induced mouse antibodies (Abs) are able to bind with Candida albicans and inhibit its growth in vitro. In addition, vaccination with laminarin-CRT partially protects mice from lethal C. albicans challenge. These results imply that rCRT/39-272 could be used as an ideal carrier or adjuvant for carbohydrate vaccines aimed at inducing or boosting IgG responses to fungal infections in immunodeficient hosts.","Li, Wei-Ji; Long, Kai; Dong, Hong-Liang; Gao, Xiao-Ming",Clinical and vaccine immunology : CVI,297,1

While the implementation of these new curricula has been described, an understanding of the impact on student learning outcomes is lacking. In 2020, the authors followed Kern's 6-step approach to curricular development to create and evaluate a novel COVID-19 curriculum for medical students at the University of California San Francisco School of Medicine and evaluate its learning outcomes. The primary goal of the curriculum was to provide third- and fourth-year medical students an opportunity for workplace learning in the absence of clinical clerkships, specifically for students to develop clerkship-level milestones in the competency domains of practice-based learning and improvement, professionalism, and systems-based practice. The curriculum was designed to match students with faculty-mentored projects occurring primarily in virtual formats. A total of 126 students enrolled in the curriculum and completed a survey about their learning outcomes (100% response rate). Of 35 possible clerkship-level milestones, there were 12 milestones for which over half of students reported development, in competency domains including practice-based learning and improvement, professionalism, and interpersonal and communication skills. Thematic analysis of students' qualitative survey responses demonstrated 2 central motivations for participating in the curriculum: identity as physicians-in-training, and patient engagement. Six central learning areas were developed during the curriculum: interprofessional teamwork, community resources, technology in medicine, skill-building, quality improvement, and specialty-specific learning. This analysis demonstrates that students can develop competencies and achieve rich workplace learning through project-based experiential learning, even in virtual clinical workplaces. Furthermore, knowledge of community resources, technology in medicine, and quality improvement were developed through the curriculum more readily than in traditional clerkships, and could be considered as integral learning objectives in future curricular design.","Castro, Maria R H; Calthorpe, Lucia M; Fogh, Shannon E; McAllister, Sophie; Johnson, Christopher L; Isaacs, Eric D; Ishizaki, Allison; Kozas, Anna; Lo, Daphne; Rennke, Stephanie; Davis, John; Chang, Anna",Academic medicine : journal of the Association of American Medical Colleges,297,7

She underwent uneventful trans umbilical, single site laparoscopic cholecystectomy, sleeve gastrectomy and paraumbilical hernia repair. DISCUSSION This article is being published as it is the first reported from the Middle East. Recent development of laparoscopy was represented with introduction of the concept of scarless surgery using Natural Orifice Transluminal Endoscopic Surgery (NOTES), or its Transumbilical counterpart (NOTUS). Unfortunately,these two approaches have not been widely reported, probably due to the need for specialized instruments, learning curve, and prolonged surgery time [2].

It is not known whether seasonality of viruses differs between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal children of varying ages. METHODS We extracted data on respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza viruses A and B, parainfluenza virus types 1, 2, and 3 and adenovirus identified through cell culture or direct immunofluorescence between 1997 and 2005 from nasopharyngeal or throat specimens at Western Australia's only pediatric hospital. We used harmonic analysis in generalized linear models to examine the variations in seasonality of these viruses with Aboriginality and age. RESULTS A respiratory virus was identified in 32% of 32 741 specimens. RSV (18.6%), influenza virus A (5.1%), and parainfluenza virus 3 (4.0%) were most common. The median age at time of identification was lower in Aboriginal children than non-Aboriginal for all viruses except RSV. Seasonality differed between all viruses and varied with age for RSV, influenza viruses and adenovirus. Influenza viruses A and B activity peaked earlier in Aboriginal than non-Aboriginal children during 1997, 1998, and 2002. CONCLUSIONS All viruses showed distinct seasonality. Variability with age and different seasonal patterns for influenza viruses in Aboriginal children compared with non-Aboriginal children has to be taken into account when identifying target groups and timing for vaccination and other interventions.","Moore, Hannah C; de Klerk, Nicholas; Richmond, Peter; Keil, Anthony D; Lindsay, Katie; Plant, Aileen; Lehmann, Deborah",The Pediatric infectious disease journal,297,20

Thus, optimal surveillance of the patient during different stages of sedation, as well as the detection of seizure activity during brain surgery, remains difficult, as skin electrodes for electroencephalographic (EEG) analysis are not applicable in most cases. We assessed the applicability of ECoG to monitor different stages of sedation, as well as the influence of different patient characteristics, such as tumour volume, size, entity, and age or gender on permutation entropy (PeEn). We conducted retrospective analysis of the ECoG data of 16 patients, who underwent awake craniotomies because of left-sided brain tumours at our centre between 2014 and 2016. PeEn could be easily calculated and compared using frontal and parietal cortical electrodes. A comparison of PeEn scores showed significantly higher values in awake patients than in patients under anaesthesia (p ≤ 0.004) and significantly higher ones in the state of transition than under general anaesthesia (p = 0.023). PeEn scores in frontal and parietal leads did not differ significantly, making them both applicable for continuous surveillance during brain surgery. None of the following clinical characteristics showed significant correlation with PeEn scores: tumour volume, WHO grade, first or recurrent tumour, gender, and sex. Being 50 years or older led to significantly lower values in parietal leads but not in frontal leads. ECoG and a consecutive analysis of PeEn are feasible and suitable for the continuous surveillance of patients during awake craniotomies. Hence, the analysis is not influenced by patients' clinical characteristics.","Lange, Nicole; Schleifer, Sophia; Berndt, Maria; Jörger, Ann-Kathrin; Wagner, Arthur; Krieg, Sandro M; Jordan, Denis; Bretschneider, Martin; Ryang, Yu-Mi; Meyer, Bernhard; Gempt, Jens",Scientific reports,297,1

This sequencing is used to select targeted therapy and monitor nonresponding or progressive tumors to identify mechanisms of therapeutic resistance. Our study objective was to review available coverage policies for cancer ctDNA-based testing panels to examine trends from 2015 to 2019. METHODS We analyzed publicly available private payer policies and Medicare national coverage determinations and local coverage determinations (LCDs) for ctDNA-based panel tests for cancer. We coded variables for each year representing policy existence, covered clinical scenario, and specific ctDNA test covered. Descriptive analyses were performed. RESULTS We found that 38% of private payer coverage policies provided coverage of ctDNA-based panel testing as of July 2019. Most private payer policy coverage was highly specific: 87% for non-small cell lung cancer, 47% for EGFR gene testing, and 79% for specific brand-name tests. There were 8 final, 2 draft, and 2 future effective final LCDs (February 3 and March 15, 2020) that covered non-FDA-approved ctDNA-based tests. The draft and future effective LCDs were the first policies to cover pan-cancer use. CONCLUSIONS Coverage of ctDNA-based panel testing for cancer indications increased from 2015 to 2019. The trend in private payer and Medicare coverage is an increasing number of coverage policies, number of positive policies, and scope of coverage. We found that Medicare coverage policies are evolving to pan-cancer uses, signifying a significant shift in coverage frameworks. Given that genomic medicine is rapidly changing, payers and policymakers (eg, guideline developers) will need to continue to evolve policies to keep pace with emerging science and standards in clinical care.","Douglas, Michael P; Gray, Stacy W; Phillips, Kathryn A",Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network : JNCCN,297,24

Crucially, scientific reasoning was a stronger independent predictor of unfounded beliefs (including anti-vaccination attitudes) than general analytic thinking was; however, it had a more modest role in health-related behaviors.","Čavojová, Vladimíra; Šrol, Jakub; Ballová Mikušková, Eva",Journal of health psychology,297,1

Five electronic databases were searched in August 2019. Studies were eligible for inclusion if they were peer-reviewed, examined community-dwelling adults, and used compositional data analysis to examine the associations between the composition of time spent in movement behaviours and health outcomes. Eight studies (7 cross-sectional, 1 prospective cohort) of >12 000 unique participants were included. Findings indicated that the 24-h movement behaviour composition was associated with all-cause mortality (1 of 1 analyses), adiposity (4 of 4 analyses), and cardiometabolic biomarkers (8 of 15 analyses). Reallocating time into MVPA from other movement behaviours was associated with favourable changes to most health outcomes and taking time out of SED and reallocating it into other movement behaviours was associated with favourable changes to all-cause mortality. The quality of evidence was very low for all health outcomes. In conclusion, these findings support the notion that the composition of movement across the entire 24-h day matters, and that recommendations for sleep, SED, and physical activity should be combined into a single public health guideline. (PROSPERO registration no.: CRD42019121641.) Novelty The 24-h movement behaviour composition is associated with a variety of health outcomes. Reallocating time into MVPA is favourably associated with health. Reallocating time out of SED is associated with favourable changes to mortality risk.","Janssen, Ian; Clarke, Anna E; Carson, Valerie; Chaput, Jean-Philippe; Giangregorio, Lora M; Kho, Michelle E; Poitras, Veronica J; Ross, Robert; Saunders, Travis J; Ross-White, Amanda; Chastin, Sebastien F M","Applied physiology, nutrition, and metabolism = Physiologie appliquee, nutrition et metabolisme",297,1

We examined the role of CpG oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN) in triggering the liver inflammatory reaction and allograft rejection. Bioluminescence imaging quantified the activation of nuclear transcriptional factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) at different time points post-transplantation. Intrahepatic lymphocyte subsets were analyzed by immunofluorescence assay and flow cytometry. The results showed that liver allografts survived for more than 100 days without a requirement for any immunosuppressive therapy. Donor-matched cardiac allografts were permanently accepted, whereas third-party cardiac grafts were rejected with delayed kinetics; this confirmed donor-specific tolerance. NF-kappaB activation in the liver allografts was transiently increased on day 1 and diminished by day 4; in comparison, it was elevated up to 10 days post-transplantation in the cardiac allografts. When CpG ODN was administered at a high dose (50 microg per mouse x 1) to the recipients on day 7 post-transplantation, it induced an acute liver inflammatory reaction with elevated NF-kappaB activation in both allogeneic and syngeneic liver grafts. Multiple doses of CpG ODN (10 microg per mouse x 3) elicited acute rejection of the liver allografts with significant T cell infiltration in the liver allografts, reduced T regulatory cells, and enhanced interferon gamma-producing cells in the intrahepatic infiltrating lymphocytes. These data demonstrate that CpG ODN initiates an inflammatory reaction and abrogates spontaneous tolerance in the liver transplantation mouse model. Liver Transpl 15:915-923, 2009.

Electrical cardiometry (EC) can be utilized to measure cardiac output (CO) and cardiac index (CI) non-invasively. Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) measuring cerebral (rCO₂) and splanchnic regional (rSO₂) mixed venous oxygenation non-invasively has been utilized for monitoring children with SCD. We studied the value and correlation of NIRS and EC in monitoring hemodynamic status in children with SCD during pain crisis. We monitored EC and NIRS continuously for 2 h after presentation and during management. Forty-five children participated in the study. CO (D = 1.72), CI (D = 1.31), rSO₂ (D = 11.6), and rCO₂ (D = 9.3), all increased over time. CO max and CI max were achieved 1 h after starting resuscitation. rCO₂ max attainment was quicker than rSO₂, as monitored by NIRS. CI max correlated with rCO₂ max (r = -0.350) and rSO₂ max (r = -0.359). In adjustment models, initial CI significantly impacted initial rCO₂ (p = 0.045) and rCO₂ max (p = 0.043), while initial CO impacted rCO₂ max (p = 0.030). Cardiac output monitoring and NIRS monitoring for cerebral and splanchnic oxygenation were feasible and improved the monitoring of therapeutic interventions for children with SCD during pain crisis.","Padmanabhan, Pradeep; Oragwu, Chikelue; Das, Bibhuti; Myers, John A; Raj, Ashok",Children,297,17

Autopsies of patients confirm the presence of the coronaviruses in the CNS, especially in the brain. The invasion and transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in the CNS is not clearly defined, but, because the endocytic pathway has become an important target for the development of therapeutic strategies for COVID-19, it is necessary to understand endocytic processes in the CNS. In addition, mitochondria and mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathways play a critical role in the antiviral immune response, and may also be critical for endocytic activity. Furthermore, dysfunctions of mitochondria and mTOR signaling pathways have been associated with some high-risk conditions such as diabetes and immunodeficiency for developing severe complications observed in COVID-19 patients. However, the role of these pathways in SARS-CoV-2 infection and spread are largely unknown. In this review, we discuss the potential mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 entry into the CNS and how mitochondria and mTOR pathways might regulate endocytic vesicle-mitochondria interactions and dynamics during SARS-CoV-2 infection. The mechanisms that plausibly account for severe neurologic complications with COVID-19 and potential treatments with Food and Drug Administration-approved drugs targeting mitochondria and the mTOR pathways are also addressed.","Swain, Olivia; Romano, Sofia K; Miryala, Ritika; Tsai, Jocelyn; Parikh, Vinnie; Umanah, George K E",The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience,297,1

The full flow regime in the micromixer was systematically studied to understand the flow impact on nanogel size, drug encapsulation efficiency and drug loading efficiency. Ibuprofen was chosen as a model drug to demonstrate encapsulation capability. The study showed that the nanogel size, drug encapsulation efficiency and drug loading efficiency did not alter significantly as long as the flow rates were in transition and turbulent regimes. The driving force behind the folding of peptides within the microenvironment is kinetic mixing with high flow rates, which dominates in comparison to molecular diffusion, nucleation, and growth. Moreover, the hydrophilic-lipophilic balance of the soy peptides determined the drug encapsulation efficiency and the drug loading efficiency, which did not vary much under different manufacturing parameters. Both characteristics are beneficial to mass production of drug-entrapped peptide. In a 50% water-ethanol mixture, the encapsulation efficiency achieved 70% and the drug loading efficiency was up to 25% in transition and turbulent flow regimes.

Cytoskeleton rearrangement plays an important role in the interconversion. Previously, we reported that HAb18G/CD147 and annexin II are interacting proteins involved in cytoskeleton rearrangement, yet the role of their interaction is unclear. In this study we found that the depletion of HAb18G/CD147 produced a rounded morphology, which is associated with amoeboid movement, whereas the depletion of annexin II resulted in an elongated morphology, which is associated with mesenchymal movement. The extracellular portion of HAb18G/CD147 can interact with a phosphorylation-inactive mutant of annexin II and inhibit its phosphorylation. HAb18G/CD147 inhibits Rho signaling pathways and amoeboid movement by inhibiting annexin II phosphorylation, promotes membrane localization of WAVE2 and Rac1 activation by way of the integrin-FAK-PI3K/PIP3 signaling pathway, and promotes the formation of lamellipodia and mesenchymal movement. CONCLUSION These results suggest that the interaction of HAb18G/CD147 with annexin II is involved in the interconversion between mesenchymal and amoeboid movement of hepatocellular carcinoma cells.","Zhao, Pu; Zhang, Wei; Wang, Shi-Jie; Yu, Xiao-Ling; Tang, Juan; Huang, Wan; Li, Yong; Cui, Hong-Yong; Guo, Yun-Shan; Tavernier, Jan; Zhang, Si-He; Jiang, Jian-Li; Chen, Zhi-Nan",Hepatology,297,1

Little is known about this relationship in patients with lupus nephritis. METHODS A cross-sectional, quantitative study. Data collected included demographics, current medication, systemic lupus erythematosus disease activity index, medication adherence, beliefs about medicines, shared decision-making, patient-doctor depth of relationship, patient-doctor quality of relationship, interpersonal trust in a physician and illness perceptions. RESULTS Ninety-eight patients with lupus nephritis completed the questionnaires. Logistic regression indicated that medication adherence was significantly predicted by (a) interpersonal trust in a physician (B = 0.85, Wald 3.94, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.01, 5.44; P = 0.05); (b) timeline cyclical (B = -0.89, Wald 4.95, 95% CI 0.19, 0.90; P < 0.05) and beliefs about the necessity of medicines (B = 0.75, Wald 4.14, 95% CI 1.03, 4.38; P < 0.05). Mediation analysis showed that beliefs about the necessity of medicines significantly mediated the relationship between trust and medication adherence when adjusted for age (B = 0.48, 95% CI 0.06, 1.08; P < 0.01). A further mediation analysis showed that patient-doctor depth of relationship (B = 0.05, 95% CI 0.01, 0.09; P < 0.001), shared decision-making (B = 0.07, 95% CI 0.01, 0.13; P < 0.001) and patient-doctor quality of relationship (B = 0.08, 95% CI 0.01, 0.16; P < 0.001) significantly mediated the relationship between illness coherence and interpersonal trust in a physician. CONCLUSION The findings highlighted two key elements: (a) the importance of trust in relation to medication adherence; and (b) a good understanding of patients' illness is linked to a better relationship with their doctor and greater participation in shared decision-making which is associated with increased trust. Tailored psycho-educational interventions could contribute to improving the patient-doctor relationship quality, trust and increased shared decision-making, which, in turn, might improve medication adherence in patients with lupus nephritis.","Georgopoulou, Sofia; Nel, Louise; Sangle, Shirish R; D'Cruz, David P",Lupus,297,0

METHODS We conducted a retrospective cohort study of percutaneous LAAO performed in the USA between January and June of 2016-2018 using the Nationwide Readmissions Database. RESULTS Overall, 12 446 patients who underwent LAAO were included in the analyses and 3477 patients (28%) were readmitted within 6 months following the interventions. Readmitted patients were more often women (p=0.001). The index hospitalisation was characterised by longer duration of hospital stay (p<0.001) and complicated with acute kidney injury (p<0.001) among readmitted patients compared with those without readmissions. Readmissions within 6 months following the index intervention were mainly due to heart failure (13%) and gastrointestinal bleeding (12%). Characteristics associated with readmissions due to heart failure included previously known heart failure (HR 2.39; 95% CI 1.70 to 3.37), valvular heart disease (HR 1.39; 95% CI 1.05 to 1.84) and chronic kidney disease (HR 1.42; 95% CI 1.03 to 1.94).

Current preclinical models do not reproduce clinical characteristics of shunt-related pulmonary hypertension. Aorto-caval shunt was firstly described as a model of right ventricle volume overload. The pathophysiology and the possible determination of pulmonary arterial hypertension of different periods of shunt exposure are still undefined. A method to create standardized, reproducible aorto-caval shunt was developed in growing rats (260±40 g). Three groups of animals were considered: shunt exposure for 10 weeks, shunt exposure for 20 weeks and control (sham laparotomy). Echocardiography and magnetic resonance revealed increased right ventricular end diastolic area in shunt at 10 weeks compared to control. Hemodynamic analysis demonstrated increased right ventricular afterload and increased effective pulmonary arterial elastance (Ea) in shunt at 20 weeks compared to control (1.29±0.20 vs. 0.14±0.06 mmHg/μl, p=0.004). At the same time point, the maximal slope of end-systolic pressure-volume relationship (Ees) decreased (0.5±0.2 mmHg/ml vs. 1.2±0.3, p<0.001). Consequently, right ventricular-arterial coupling was markedly deteriorated with a ≈50% decrease in the ratio of end-systolic to pulmonary artery elastance (Ees/Ea). Finally, left ventricular preload diminished (≈30% decrease in left ventricular end-diastolic volume). Histology demonstrated medial hypertrophy and small artery luminal narrowing. Chronic exposure to aorto-caval shunt is a reliable model to produce right ventricular volume overload and secondary pulmonary arterial hypertension. This model could be an alternative with low mortality and high reproducibility for investigators on the underlying mechanisms of shunt-related pulmonary hypertension.","Rungatscher, Alessio; Linardi, Daniele; Milani, Elisabetta; Ucci, Grazia; Nicolato, Elena; Merigo, Flavia; Salvetti, Beatrice; Mazzucco, Alessandro; Luciani, Giovanni Battista; Faggian, Giuseppe",Microvascular research,297,16

METHODS Thirty male professional basketball players (age = 26.1 ± 6.2 years) were randomly assigned to three counterbalanced groups: two MI training groups, who completed imagery training by mentally rehearsing upper and lower limbs resistance training exercises loaded with either 85% of one maximum repetition (85%1RM) or optimum power loads (OPL), or a control group. For six consecutive weeks, while all groups completed two weekly sessions of high-intensity running, only the MI groups performed three additional MI sessions a week. Maximal strength and power outpus were measured through 1RM and OPL assessments in the back squat and bench press exercises with a linear positioning transducer. Vertical jump and throwing capabilities were assessed with the countermovement jump and the seated medicine ball throw tests, respectively. Kinesthetic and visual imagery questionnaires, chronometry and rating of perceived effort scores were collected to evaluate MI vividness, MI ability, and perceived effort. RESULTS Physical performances improved significantly following both MI protocols (range: ~2% to ~9%), but were reduced in the control group, compared to pre-intervention (P ≤ 0.016). Moreover, interactions (time × protocol) were identified between the two MI groups (P ≤ 0.001). While the 85%1RM led to greater effects on maximal strength measures than the OPL, the latter induced superior responses on measures of lower limbs power.

This study uses electronic health record data to quantify the extent of changes to visit volume in 36 FQHCs across 19 states as well as changes in quality metrics. We found a steep decline in in-person visits in March 2020 accompanied by a sharp increase in telehealth visits; however, combined volume remained 23% below pre-pandemic levels. The implications for public health are significant, as preventive and chronic care deferral could lead to exacerbations of health disparities. Our examination of the impact on quality measures suggests that gaps in care are already emerging. Services that cannot be readily performed virtually are most affected. As FQHC visit numbers recover, concerted efforts are needed to encourage access and re-engage at-risk groups that fell out of care.","Simon, Jodi; Mohanty, Nivedita; Masinter, Lisa; Hamilton, Andrew; Jain, Arjit",Journal of health care for the poor and underserved,297,1

After the outbreak of COVID-19, a lot of highly emotional texts were flooded on the Internet. In the task of entity-level sentiment analysis for major public health events, there is often a lack of large-scale labeled corpus and a mature model that can effectively deal with medical and health texts. A multi-task sentiment analysis model based on BERT was proposed, which combined sentiment analysis and entity recognition. This model is used to extract sentiment information of Weibo comments related to COVID-19 and judge whether the entities in the text are targeted by emotions. The composition layer was constructed by combining the emotional information and entity information, and the loss function was designed to integrate the multi-task into the same model. More than 5000 Weibo text data about COVID-19 were preprocessed and annotated to form an entity-level corpus. Finally, several common methods were used to compare with the proposed method. Several comparison indexes were used to evaluate the model. The experimental results showed that the proposed model had better overall performance than other models. © 2021 IEEE.","Zhang, X.; Xu, Z.","2nd International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Electromechanical Automation, AIEA 2021",297,20

However, samples should be removed under general anaesthesia to avoid post-mortem artefacts. These include the separation of epithelium from the villous lamina propria and denudation of villous tips within a few minutes of death, and occur more rapidly in challenged animals. Pathological changes consist of blunting and fusion of the villi with a reduction of the columnar epithelium to cuboidal and occasionally squamous epithelium. A surface inflammatory exudate may be present, especially within 24 hours of challenge with enteropathogenic E. coli. Examination of several sites from the small intestine indicates a variable distribution for enteropathogens. Rotavirus is seen by immunofluorescence microscopy in epithelial cells principally in the proximal half of the small intestine, although they may occasionally be found in the distal half. By contrast, E. coli organisms adhere to enterocytes in the distal half of the small intestine. Cryptosporidia inhabit the brush border of the enterocytes enclosed within host cell microvillous membranes, principally in the distal half of the small intestine.

This article outlines some key issues that travel medicine specialists and other clinicians should revisit when providing services to travelers. We discuss obstacles to promoting sexual health, including the diversity of the target group, unanticipated opportunities for sexual risk, ambivalent cooperation by the travel and tourism industries, poorly developed travel health sectors, illegal migration and sex tourism, and lack of research about the association between travel and STDs. We also outlined some programmatic aspects of public health that should be identified and addressed for the promotion of sexual health among travelers.","Abdullah, Abu Saleh M; Ebrahim, Shahul H; Fielding, Richard; Morisky, Donald E",Clinical infectious diseases : an official publication of the Infectious Diseases Society of America,297,33

This study explores the experiences of New Zealand general practice teams in their use of telehealth during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic in New Zealand. METHOD We qualitatively analysed a subtheme on telehealth of the General Practice Pandemic Experience New Zealand (GPPENZ) study, where general practice team members across the country were invited to participate in five surveys between 8 May 2020 to 27 August 2020. RESULTS 164 participants enrolled in the study during survey one, with 78 (48%) completing all surveys. Five telehealth themes were identified: benefits, limitations, paying for consults, changes over time and plans for future use. Benefits included rapid triage, convenience and efficiency, and limitations included financial and technical barriers for practices and patients and concerns about clinical risk. Respondents rapidly returned to in-person consultations and wanted clarification of conditions suited to telehealth, better infrastructure and funding. CONCLUSION To equitably sustain telehealth use, the following are required: adequate funding, training, processes communicated to patients, improved patient access to technology and technological literacy, virtual physical examination methods and integration with existing primary health care services.","Wilson, Geraldine; Currie, Olivia; Bidwell, Susan; Saeed, Baraah; Dowell, Anthony; Halim, Andrew Adiguna; Toop, Les; Richardson, Ann; Savage, Ruth; Hudson, Ben",The New Zealand medical journal,297,28

To examine the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 in infected patients out of Wuhan, from China. METHODS: Thirteen patients were confirmed to be infected with novel coronavirus-2019 (2019-nCoV) between January 27 and February 8, 2020, in Baoji city, Shannxi, northwestern China. Epidemiological and clinical information, and computed to morphology imaging data from all COVID-19 patients were collected; cases were divided into two groups according to the severity of infection (mild or severe). RESULTS: Nine (9/13) COVID-19 patients exhibited mild disease severity, and defined as second-generation human-to-human transmission cases. Most patients (11/13) had a history of travel to or from Wuhan. There were no differences in sex and age between the mild and severe cases (all P > 0.05). A moderate degree of fever (11/13), cough (13/13), and fatigue (8/13) were common symptoms; however, there was no statistical difference between mild and severe cases in this regard (all P > 0.05). Oxyhemoglobin saturation and oxygenation index decreased, and C-reactive protein (CRP) and serum amyloid A (SAA) levels were elevated in all patients with COVID-19 infection, with statistically significant differences between those with severe disease and mild infection (all P < 0.05). Twelve of 13 COVID-19 patients exhibited changes in chest CT imaging features, and time course changes were different between mild and severe cases (all P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Most cases of COVID-19 infection were second-generation human-to-human transmissions from Wuhan and were mild in severity. The clinical characteristics of COVID-19 varied. Oxyhemoglobin saturation, oxygenation index, CRP and SAA levels, and CT features were reliable parameters to evaluate the severity of COVID-19 infection.

OBJECTIVE: To explore published literature in relation to training and education for viral epidemics as well as the effect of these interventions to inform training of HCW. DATA SOURCES: Systematic searches in five databases performed between 1 January 2000 and 24 April 2020 for studies reporting on educational interventions in response to major viral epidemics. STUDY ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: All studies on educational interventions developed, implemented and evaluated in response to major global viral outbreaks from 2000 to 2020. PARTICIPANTS: Healthcare workers. INTERVENTIONS: Educational or training interventions. STUDY APPRAISAL AND SYNTHESIS METHODS: Descriptive information were extracted and synthesised according to content, competency category, educational methodology, educational effects and level of educational outcome. Quality appraisal was performed using a criterion-based checklist. RESULTS: A total of 15 676 records were identified and 46 studies were included. Most studies were motivated by the Ebola virus outbreak with doctors and nurses as primary learners. Traditional didactic methods were commonly used to teach theoretical knowledge. Simulation-based training was used mainly for training of technical skills, such as donning and doffing of personal protective equipment. Evaluation of the interventions consisted mostly of surveys on learner satisfaction and confidence or tests of knowledge and skills. Only three studies investigated transfer to the clinical setting or effect on patient outcomes.

There are concerns that stroke patients have not sought medical attention and in the months after the lockdown suffer recurrent severe strokes. The aims of this study were to investigate how stroke admission rates and distributions of severity varied before, during and after the lockdown in a representative Norwegian hospital population. METHODS: All patients discharged from Akershus University Hospital with a diagnosis of transient ischemic attack (TIA) or acute stroke from January to September 2020 were identified by hospital chart review. RESULTS: We observed a transient decrease in weekly stroke admissions during lockdown from an average of 21.4 (SD 4.7) before to 15.0 (SD 4.2) during and 17.2 (SD 3.3) after (p < 0.011). The proportion of mild ischemic and haemorrhagic strokes was also lower during lockdown with 66% before, 57% during and 68% after (p = 0.011). CONCLUSION: The period of COVID-19 lockdown was associated with a temporary reduction in total admissions of strokes. In particular, there were fewer with TIA and mild stroke. Given the need to prevent the worsening of symptoms and risk of recurrence, it is necessary to emphasise the importance to seek medical care even in states of emergency.","Kristoffersen, Espen Saxhaug; Jahr, Silje Holt; Faiz, Kashif Waqar; Thommessen, Bente; Rønning, Ole Morten",Neurol Sci,297,26

While the best option in terms of non-invasive systems of oxygen delivery is still a matter of debate, it also remains unclear as to whether or not the optimal in-bed positioning of patients might also help to improve their oxygen saturation levels. On the basis of three representative cases, it is possible to propose the following hypotheses: (i) how patients are positioned has a strong influence on their oxygen saturation levels; (ii) saturation-optimalised positions are patient-specific; (iii) prone positions require ergonomic devices; and (iv) saturation-optimalised positions should aim to place the most affected part(s) of the lung(s) on top. Considered together, these hypotheses have led us to recommend that COVID-19 patients should undergo a specific assessment at admission to determine their saturation-optimalised in-bed position. However, further studies are still needed to assess the benefits of such a strategy on clinical outcomes.","Froelich, S; Mandonnet, E; Julla, J-B; Touchard, C; Laloi-Michelin, M; Kevorkian, J-P; Gautier, J-F",Diabetes metab,297,12

Virtual management (telemedicine) has been shown to reduce health costs and improve access to care. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this survey is to understand oncologists' awareness of and views on virtual management, challenges, and preferences, as well as their priorities regarding the prescribing of anticancer treatments during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We created a self-administrated electronic survey about the virtual management of patients with cancer during the COVID-19 pandemic. We evaluated its clinical sensibility and pilot tested the instrument. We surveyed practicing oncologists in Gulf and Arab countries using snowball sampling via emails and social media networks. Reminders were sent 1 and 2 weeks later using SurveyMonkey. RESULTS: We received 222 responses from validated oncologists from April 2-22, 2020. An awareness of virtual clinics, virtual multidisciplinary teams, and virtual prescriptions was reported by 182 (82%), 175 (79%), and 166 (75%) respondents, respectively. Reported challenges associated with virtual management were the lack of physical exam (n=134, 60%), patients' awareness and access (n=131, 59%), the lack of physical attendance of patients (n=93, 42%), information technology (IT) support (n=82, 37%), and the safety of virtual management (n=78, 35%). Overall, 111 (50%) and 107 (48%) oncologists did not prefer the virtual prescription of chemotherapy and novel immunotherapy, respectively. However, 188 (85%), 165 (74%), and 127 (57%) oncologists preferred the virtual prescription of hormonal therapy, bone modifying agents, and targeted therapy, respectively. In total, 184 (83%), 183 (83%), and 176 (80%) oncologists preferred to continue neoadjuvant, adjuvant, and perioperative treatments, respectively. Overall, 118 (53%) respondents preferred to continue first-line palliative treatment, in contrast to 68 (30%) and 47 (21%) respondents indicating a preference to interrupt second- and third-line palliative treatment, respectively. For administration of virtual prescriptions, all respondents preferred the oral route and 118 (53%) preferred the subcutaneous route. In contrast, 193 (87%) did not prefer the intravenous route for virtual prescriptions. Overall, 102 (46%) oncologists responded that they would ""definitely"" prefer to manage patients with cancer virtually. CONCLUSIONS: Oncologists have a high level of awareness of virtual management. Although their survey responses indicated that second- and third-line palliative treatments should be interrupted, they stated that neoadjuvant, adjuvant, perioperative, and first-line palliative treatments should continue. Our results confirm that oncologists' views on the priority of anticancer treatments are consistent with the evolving literature during the COVID-19 pandemic. Challenges to virtual management should be addressed to improve the care of patients with cancer.","Tashkandi, Emad; Zeeneldin, Ahmed; AlAbdulwahab, Amal; Elemam, Omima; Elsamany, Shereef; Jastaniah, Wasil; Abdullah, Shaker; Alfayez, Mohammad; Jazieh, Abdul Rahman; Al-Shamsi, Humaid O",J Med Internet Res,297,16

We reviewed the charts of 261 PWH who initiated care at an academic HIV clinic between January 1, 2016 and December 21, 2018. Analysis included one-sided binomial exact tests and multiple linear, Poisson, and Beta regression models. The most common abnormality was a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) <60 mL/min (10%).

An increased AST and ALT &#8805;2 × upper limit of normal (ULN) was found in 5% and 3%, respectively. Hepatitis C and use of darunavir and lopinavir were associated with increased AST or ALT. When a GFR was <60 mL/min or an AST or ALT was &#8805;2 × ULN, no action was taken in 53% of cases. In 18% of cases the only intervention was repeat testing. The most common interventions after lipid results were calculation of a 10-year cardiovascular risk score (31%) and addition of a statin (18%). Taking action after lipid results was strongly associated with age &#8805;40 (rr 7.37, 95% CI 3.0 to 18.3).

When close others misbehave, it generates a powerful conflict between observers' moral values and their cherished relationships. Previous research has almost exclusively studied moral perception in a social vacuum by investigating responses to the transgressions of strangers; therefore, little is known about how these responses unfold in the context of intimate bonds. Here we systematically examine the impact of having a close relationship with a transgressor on perceptions of that transgressor, the relationship, and the self. We predicted less negative emotional and evaluative responses to transgressors and smaller consequences for the relationship, yet more negative emotional and evaluative responses to the self when close others, compared with strangers or acquaintances, transgress. Participants read hypothetical wrongdoings (Study 1), recalled unethical events (Study 2), reported daily transgressions (Study 3; preregistered), and learned of novel immoral behavior (Study 4) committed by close others or comparison groups. Participants reported less other-critical emotions, more lenient moral evaluations, a reduced desire to punish/criticize, and a smaller impact on the relationship (compared with acquaintances) when close others versus strangers or acquaintances transgressed. Simultaneously, participants reported more self-conscious emotions and showed some evidence of harsher moral self-evaluations when close others transgressed. Underlying mechanisms of this process were examined. Our findings demonstrate the deep ambivalence in reacting to close others' unethical behaviors, revealing a surprising irony-in protecting close others, the self may bear some of the burden of their misbehavior.

A risk-stratification model that could be used to identify high-risk pediatric patients with HLH who should be considered for second-line therapies, including salvage regimens and allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), was developed. METHODS: The medical records of 88 pediatric patients (median age 1.4 years, range 0.2-15 years) with non-malignancy associated secondary HLH were retrospectively reviewed. Treatment strategies included dexamethasone, etoposide, and cyclosporine. RESULTS: Survival analysis showed HLH patients with infections other than Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and unknown causes experienced better 5-year overall survival (OS) than patients with HLH due to autoimmune disease, EBV or immunodeficiency (76% vs. 65, 33.3, 11%, p < 0.001). On multivariate analysis, among all patients, non-response at 8 weeks was the most powerful predictor of poor OS. When treatment response was excluded, hemoglobin < 60 g/L and albumin < 25 g/L at diagnosis were associated with poor OS. In patients with EBV-HLH, hemoglobin < 60 g/L at diagnosis was associated with poor OS. A prognostic risk score was established and weighted based on hazard ratios calculated for three parameters measured at diagnosis: hemoglobin < 60 g/L (2 points), platelets < 30 × 109/L (1 point), albumin < 25 g/L (2 points). Five-year OS of low-risk (score 0-1), intermediate-risk (score 2), and poor-risk (score &#8805; 3) patients were 88, 38, and 22%, respectively (p < 0.001).

NADPH and NADH are known to interact with HRP and generate significant quantities of superoxide anion, a radical that spontaneously dismutates to form H2O2 which interferes with the AR/HRP assay. Microsomal enzymes generate H2O2 as a consequence of electron transfer from NADPH to cytochrome P450 hemoproteins with subsequent oxygen activation. We found that superoxide anion formation via the interaction of NADPH with HRP was inhibited by superoxide dismutase (SOD) without affecting H2O2 generation by microsomal enzymes. Using SOD in enzyme assays, we consistently detected rates of H2O2 production using microgram quantities of microsomal proteins (2.62 ± 0.20 picomol/min/µg protein for liver microsomes from naïve female rats, 12.27 ± 1.29 for liver microsomes from dexamethasone induced male rats, and 2.17 ± 0.25 picomol/min/µg protein for human liver microsomes). This method can also be applied to quantify rates of H2O2 production by oxidases where superoxide anion generation by NADH or NADPH and HRP can interfere with enzyme assays.","Mishin, Vladimir; Heck, Diane E; Laskin, Debra L; Laskin, Jeffrey D",Free Radic Res,297,26

252839,252839,252839,Treatment of COVID-19 by Inhaled NO to Reduce Shunt?,19.51799,11.570333,2020,"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has been identified as the cause of an outbreak of respiratory illness in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China beginning in December 2019. As of 31 January 2020, this epidemic had spread to 19 countries with 11 791 confirmed cases, including 213 deaths. The World Health Organization has declared it a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. METHODS: A scoping review was conducted following the methodological framework suggested by Arksey and O'Malley. In this scoping review, 65 research articles published before 31 January 2020 were analyzed and discussed to better understand the epidemiology, causes, clinical diagnosis, prevention and control of this virus. The research domains, dates of publication, journal language, authors' affiliations, and methodological characteristics were included in the analysis. All the findings and statements in this review regarding the outbreak are based on published information as listed in the references. RESULTS: Most of the publications were written using the English language (89.2%). The largest proportion of published articles were related to causes (38.5%) and a majority (67.7%) were published by Chinese scholars. Research articles initially focused on causes, but over time there was an increase of the articles related to prevention and control. Studies thus far have shown that the virus' origination is in connection to a seafood market in Wuhan, but specific animal associations have not been confirmed. Reported symptoms include fever, cough, fatigue, pneumonia, headache, diarrhea, hemoptysis, and dyspnea. Preventive measures such as masks, hand hygiene practices, avoidance of public contact, case detection, contact tracing, and quarantines have been discussed as ways to reduce transmission. To date, no specific antiviral treatment has proven effective; hence, infected people primarily rely on symptomatic treatment and supportive care. CONCLUSIONS: There has been a rapid surge in research in response to the outbreak of COVID-19. During this early period, published research primarily explored the epidemiology, causes, clinical manifestation and diagnosis, as well as prevention and control of the novel coronavirus. Although these studies are relevant to control the current public emergency, more high-quality research is needed to provide valid and reliable ways to manage this kind of public health emergency in both the short- and long-term.","Adhikari, Sasmita Poudel; Meng, Sha; Wu, Yu-Ju; Mao, Yu-Ping; Ye, Rui-Xue; Wang, Qing-Zhi; Sun, Chang; Sylvia, Sean; Rozelle, Scott; Raat, Hein; Zhou, Huan",Infect Dis Poverty,297,20

Specifically, we are concerned about the re-start of the Spanish national football league, La Liga, which is currently –May 2020– stopped with 11 fixtures remaining. Our model includes two additional states of an individual, confined and quarantined, which are reached when an individual presents COVID-19 symptoms or has undergone a virus test with a positive result. The model also accounts for the interaction dynamics of players, considering three different sources of infection: the player social circle, the contact with his/her team colleagues during training sessions, and the interaction with rivals during a match. Our results highlight the influence of the days between matches, the frequency of virus tests and their sensitivity on the number of players infected at the end of the season. Following our findings, we finally propose a variety of strategies to minimise the probability that COVID-19 propagates in case the season of La Liga was re-started after the current lockdown.","Buldú, Javier M.; Antequera, Daniel R.; Aguirre, Jacobo",Chaos Solitons Fractals,297,21

METHOD: This was a prospective telephone follow-up observational study of 243 participants who completed an online survey that started on 12 March 2020. RESULTS: After a mean of 5.5 months from the loss of smell onset, 98.3 per cent of participants reported improvement with a 71.2 per cent complete recovery rate after a median of 21 days. The chance of complete recovery significantly decreased after 131 days from the onset of loss of smell (100 per cent sensitive and 97.7 per cent specific). Younger age and isolated smell loss were associated with a rapid recovery, whereas accompanying rhinological and gastrointestinal symptoms were associated with longer loss of smell duration. CONCLUSION: Smell loss, occurring as a prominent symptom during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, showed a favourable outcome. However, after 5.5 months from the onset, around 10 per cent of participants still complained of moderate or severe hyposmia.","Jalessi, M; Bagheri, S H; Azad, Z; Firouzabadi, F D; Amini, E; Alizadeh, R; Chaibakhsh, S; Ghalehbaghi, B; Hopkins, C; Farhadi, M",J Laryngol Otol,297,1

In the current research, four isolated constitutes namely lapacho (1), peshawaraquinone (2), indanone derivatives (3), &#945;-lapachone (4) of H. adenophyllum were tested for anti-inflammatory effect using the carrageenan- and histamine-induced paw edema paradigm. The tested compounds (1-4) were evaluated for anti-inflammatory effect during the early and late phase of edema induction. In the early phase, all tested compounds (0.5 2.5 mg/kg each i.p.) demonstrated less than 50% effect, while in the later phase, compounds (2 and 3) demonstrated 85.66 and 89.87% attenuation. In addition, compounds (1-4) were subjected to histamine-induced inflammation, where compounds 2 and 3 exhibited excellent effects 86.87 and 89.98%, respectively at 5 mg/kg after the 2nd hour of administration, whereas compounds 1 and 4 did not exhibit any significant effect as compared with the negative control. Molecular docking results revealed a very high potency of compound based on the protein-ligand interaction (PLI) profile, which was further evaluated through a molecular dynamic simulation study. Therefore, the anti-inflammatory effect of H. adenophyllum attributed to the presence of these bioactive compounds (1-4) strongly supports the traditional uses of H. adenophyllum for treatment of inflammation. However, compounds 2 and 3 which exerted anti-inflammatory effect must be subjected for further mechanistic studies.","Abu-Izneid, Tareq; Shah, Zafar Ali; Rauf, Abdur; Wadood, Abdul; Bawazeer, Saud; Muhammad, Naveed; El-Esawi, Mohamed A; Alhumaydhi, Fahad A; Aljohani, Abdullah S M; El-Sharkawy, Eman; Mubarak, Mohammad S; Isayeva, Kuralay; Shariati, Mohammad Ali",Inflammation,297,20

METHODS: An integrative review was performed by two independent researchers, based on the literature available in the MEDLINE (via PubMed) and LILACS databases, using the descriptors ""pregnancy"" AND ""COVID-19"" AND ""vertical transmission"". This search included case reports or case series published up until 17th June 2020 in English or Portuguese. After reading the articles available in their entirety, those related specifically to the potential risks of vertical transmission of COVID-19 during pregnancy were selected. We initially found a total of 57 articles; 26 were carefully screened and 15 were finally selected. RESULTS: Pregnancy can make women more susceptible to infections, especially by viral pathogens, given the various physiological and immunological changes that occur to maintain maternal-fetal balance. It is speculated that the fetus may be a possible target for COVID-19. Few studies (3 out of 15) in our analysis have found positive results for SARS-CoV-2 in fetal membranes, placenta, and in newborns right after birth. Additionally, no difference was noticed when comparing different modes of delivery, and seems reasonable to assume that pregnant women with stable clinical conditions can be encouraged for vaginal delivery. CONCLUSION: Further studies with a great number of cases are warranted to elucidate whether the virus may be vertically transmitted to the fetus and if any maternal conditions can influence that. Our findings seem to demonstrate that vertical transmission is possible but quite unusual.","Oliveira, Lisiane Vital de; Silva, Camila Radelley Azevedo Costa da; Lopes, Lorenna Peixoto; Agra, Isabela Karine Rodrigues",Rev Assoc Med Bras (1992),297,20

RESULTS: Two patients required intubation for hypoxemic respiratory failure, whereas one required significant supplemental oxygen. One patient with previously stable MG had myasthenic exacerbation. One patient treated with tocilizumab for COVID-19 was successfully extubated. Two patients were treated for MG with intravenous immunoglobulin without thromboembolic complications. DISCUSSION: Our findings suggest that the clinical course and outcomes in patients with MG and COVID-19 are highly variable.

Since then, the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has spread to become a worldwide pandemic. Beyond the risks strictly related to the infection, concerns have been expressed for the endocrinological impact that COVID-19 may have, especially in vulnerable individuals with pre-existing endocrinological health conditions. To date new information is emerging regarding severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in children but the literature is still scarce concerning this infection in patients with intracranial malignant neoplasms. We report a 9-year-old child infected with SARS-CoV-2 and recent diagnosis of suprasellar non-germinomatous germ cell tumor also suffering from diabetes insipidus and hypothalamic-pituitary failure (hypothyroidism, adrenal insufficiency, hypothalamic obesity and growth hormone deficiency) and its clinical course. The patient remained asymptomatic for the duration of the infection without requiring any change in the replacement therapeutic dosages taken before the infection. We then discuss the proposed approach to treat a pediatric patient with SARS-CoV-2 infection and hypothalamic-pituitary failure and we include a review of the literature.

It aims to assess the changes on the Armenian labour market by means of a deductive analysis of historical data and observation of changes in the structure of resources based on generally available macroeconomic data. The authors evaluate these processes against the background of demographic and economic changes, by presenting and describing statistical data. Variables such as data on the economic situation of the country (income capita, inflation rate and unemployment), demographic data (employment structure, population structure, migration) are used for the analysis. The analysis demonstrates that the COVID-19 pandemic and the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict led to an economic downturn in Armenia, with GDP per capita falling, and inflation rising. A more rapid decrease in employment could be observed in 2020, manifesting itself in a declining number of employees, self-employed and entrepreneurs. A much more significant drop in employment was observed in urban areas than in the countryside, although the total number of agricultural workers in Armenia decreased compared to the 1990s. The governmental measures and programmes aimed at protecting jobs and businesses and mitigating the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic proved to be insufficient. In 2020, fewer citizens emigrated from Armenia as a result of the state of the emergency maintained from March to June 2020 and the closing of state borders. © Institute of Society Transformation, 2020","Gomółka, K.; Flisikowski, K.",Economic Annals-XXI,297,32

As we still have few therapies and nil vaccines yet available, the void of a clear framework for research and practice is increasingly clear. We describe a framework that has been used to prioritise therapeutic research in previous pandemics which could be used to progress clinical pharmacology and therapeutics research in COVID-19. This is particularly relevant as discussion has already moved on from antiviral therapeutics to delineating the treatment of the host from treatment and elimination of the infective agent. Focussing on the host brings together three concepts: host treatment, the damage response framework and therapeutic repurposing. The integration of these three areas plays to the traditional strength of pharmaceuticals in providing a period of stabilization to permit time for the development of novel antiviral drugs and vaccines. In integrating approaches to repurposing, host treatment and damage response we identified three key properties that a potentially effective repurposed drug must possess by way of a framework. There must be homology, i.e., the same or similar relation with the pathogenesis of the disease, ideally targeted to the conserved pathophysiological outcomes of the viral attack; there must be a defined locus within the spectrum to prevention to severe disease and the framework must draw upon the historical dose and safety experience of the repurposed drug. To illustrate, we have mapped therapeutics that impact upon a key dysregulated pathway in COVID-19 - the renin angiotensin system - using this approach. Collectively this type of analysis reveals the importance of existing data (repurposed information and administrative observational data) and the importance of the details of the known pathophysiological response to viruses in approaches to treating the host.","Martin, Jennifer H; Head, Richard",,297,7

METHODS: This is a matched case-control (1:2) study with 41 cases of GIB (31 upper and 10 lower) in patients with COVID-19 and 82 matched controls of patients with COVID-19 without GIB. The primary objective was to characterize bleeding etiologies, and our secondary aim was to discuss outcomes and therapeutic approaches. RESULTS: There was no difference in the presenting symptoms of the cases and controls, and no difference in severity of COVID-19 manifestations (P > 0.05) was observed. Ten (32%) patients with upper GIB underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy and 5 (50%) patients with lower GIBs underwent flexible sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy. The most common upper and lower GIB etiologies were gastric or duodenal ulcers (80%) and rectal ulcers related to rectal tubes (60%), respectively. Four of the esophagogastroduodenoscopies resulted in therapeutic interventions, and the 3 patients with rectal ulcers were referred to colorectal surgery for rectal packing. Successful hemostasis was achieved in all 7 cases that required interventions. Transfusion requirements between patients who underwent endoscopic therapy and those who were conservatively managed were not significantly different. Anticoagulation and rectal tube usage trended toward being a risk factor for GIB, although it did not reach statistical significance. DISCUSSION: In COVID-19 patients with GIB, compared with matched controls of COVID-19 patients without GIB, there seemed to be no difference in initial presenting symptoms. Of those with upper and lower GIB, the most common etiology was peptic ulcer disease and rectal ulcers from rectal tubes, respectively. Conservative management seems to be a reasonable initial approach in managing these complex cases, but larger studies are needed to guide management.","Martin, Tracey A; Wan, David W; Hajifathalian, Kaveh; Tewani, Sunena; Shah, Shawn L; Mehta, Amit; Kaplan, Alyson; Ghosh, Gaurav; Choi, Anthony J; Krisko, Tibor I; Fortune, Brett E; Crawford, Carl V; Sharaiha, Reem Z",Am J Gastroenterol,297,21

Students were forced to study online, with limited access to facilities and less contact with peers and teachers, while at the same time being exposed to more autonomy. This study examined how students adapted to emergency remote learning, specifically focusing on students' resource-management strategies using an individual differences approach. One thousand eight hundred university students completed a questionnaire on their resource-management strategies and indicators of (un)successful adaptation to emergency remote learning. On average, students reported being less able to regulate their attention, effort, and time and less motivated compared to the situation before the crisis started;they also reported investing more time and effort in their self-study. Using a k-means cluster analysis, we identified four adaptation profiles and labeled them according to the reported changes in their resource-management strategies: the overwhelmed, the surrenderers, the maintainers, and the adapters. Both the overwhelmed and surrenderers appeared to be less able to regulate their effort, attention, and time and reported to be less motivated to study than before the crisis. In contrast, the adapters appreciated the increased level of autonomy and were better able to self-regulate their learning. The resource-management strategies of the maintainers remained relatively stable. Students' responses to open-answer questions on their educational experience, coded using a thematic analysis, were consistent with the quantitative profiles. Implications about how to support students in adapting to online learning are discussed.","Biwer, F.; Wiradhany, W.; Oude Egbrink, M.; Hospers, H.; Wasenitz, S.; Jansen, W.; de Bruin, A.",Frontiers in Psychology,297,13

Goals of implementation were to consolidate in-person prenatal screening, surveillance, and examinations into fewer in-person visits while maintaining patient access to ongoing antenatal care and subspecialty consultations via telehealth virtual visits. The rationale for this change was to minimize patient travel and thus risk for COVID-19 exposure. Because a large portion of obstetric patients had underlying medical or fetal conditions placing them at increased risk for adverse outcomes, prenatal care telehealth regimens were tailored for increased surveillance and/or counseling. Based on the incorporation of telehealth into prenatal care for high-risk patients, specific recommendations are made for the following conditions, clinical scenarios, and services: (1) hypertensive disorders of pregnancy including preeclampsia, gestational hypertension, and chronic hypertension; (2) pregestational and gestational diabetes mellitus; (3) maternal cardiovascular disease; (4) maternal neurologic conditions; (5) history of preterm birth and poor obstetrical history including prior stillbirth; (6) fetal conditions such as intrauterine growth restriction, congenital anomalies, and multiple gestations including monochorionic placentation; (7) genetic counseling; (8) mental health services; (9) obstetric anesthesia consultations; and (10) postpartum care. While telehealth virtual visits do not fully replace in-person encounters during prenatal care, they do offer a means of reducing potential patient and provider exposure to COVID-19 while providing consolidated in-person testing and services.

C_LI What this adds to what is known?O_LIThere have been very few qualitative studies on the impact of the COVID 19 pandemic on the mental health and wellbeing of unpaid carers, this review has synthesised their findings and will contribute to future research. C_LIO_LIUnpaid carers are known to be at risk of poor mental health and wellbeing outcomes, this review demonstrates that they are even more at risk due to the increased reliance on them during the pandemic. C_LI What is this implication and what should change?O_LIThere is limited qualitative data available from a range of different groups of carers for example, spouse carers, parent carers, carers of people who have specific needs or conditions. Therefore, purposeful sample research to determine the needs of groups of carers during the COVID 19 pandemic could be valuable. C_LIO_LIUnpaid carers who do not have appropriate support are more at risk of poor mental health and wellbeing outcomes. During the pandemic services have had to adapt to the various rules implemented. Digital adaptations to the provision of support to both carers and the people they care for could be beneficial both during and after the pandemic.

Accurate and fast test results may permit more efficient use of protective and isolation resources and allow rapid therapeutic interventions. We evaluated the analytical and clinical performance characteristics of the Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 (Xpert) test, a rapid, automated molecular test for SARS-CoV-2. Analytical sensitivity and specificity/interference were assessed with infectious SARS-CoV-2; other infectious coronavirus species, including SARS-CoV; and 85 nasopharyngeal swab specimens positive for other respiratory viruses, including endemic human coronaviruses (hCoVs). Clinical performance was assessed using 483 remnant upper- and lower-respiratory-tract specimens previously analyzed by standard-of-care (SOC) NAATs. The limit of detection of the Xpert test was 0.01 PFU/ml. Other hCoVs, including Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, were not detected by the Xpert test. SARS-CoV, a closely related species in the subgenus Sarbecovirus, was detected by a broad-range target (E) but was distinguished from SARS-CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2-specific N2 target). Compared to SOC NAATs, the positive agreement of the Xpert test was 219/220 (99.5%), and the negative agreement was 250/261 (95.8%). A third tie-breaker NAAT resolved all but three of the discordant results in favor the Xpert test. The Xpert test provided sensitive and accurate detection of SARS-CoV-2 in a variety of upper- and lower-respiratory-tract specimens.

These measures comprised, among others, social distancing, the temporary closure of shops and schools, and a ban of large public gatherings and meetings with people not living in the same household. OBJECTIVE: It is fair to assume that the issued NPIs have heavily affected social life and psychological functioning. We therefore aimed to examine possible effects of this lockdown in conjunction with daily new infections and the state of the national economy on people's interests, motives, and other psychological states. METHODS: We derived 249 keywords from the Google Trends database, tapping into 27 empirically and rationally selected psychological domains. To overcome issues with reliability and specificity of individual indicator variables, broad factors were derived by means of time series factor analysis. All domains were subjected to a change point analysis and time series regression analysis with infection rates, NPIs, and the state of the economy as predictors. All keywords and analyses were preregistered prior to analysis. RESULTS: With the pandemic arriving in Germany, significant increases in people's search interests were observed in virtually all domains. Although most of the changes were short-lasting, each had a distinguishable onset during the lockdown period. Regression analysis of the Google Trends data confirmed pronounced autoregressive effects for the investigated variables, while forecasting by means of the tested predictors (ie, daily new infections, NPIs, and the state of economy) was moderate at best. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that people's interests, motives, and psychological states are heavily affected in times of crisis and lockdown. Specifically, disease- and virus-related domains (eg, pandemic disease, symptoms) peaked early, whereas personal health strategies (eg, masks, homeschooling) peaked later during the lockdown. Domains addressing social life and psychosocial functioning showed long-term increases in public interest. Renovation was the only domain to show a decrease in search interest with the onset of the lockdown. As changes in search behavior are consistent over multiple domains, a Google Trends analysis may provide information for policy makers on how to adapt and develop intervention, information, and prevention strategies, especially when NPIs are in effect.","Rotter, Dominik; Doebler, Philipp; Schmitz, Florian",J Med Internet Res,297,24

Recently, the cardiological effects of the virus have also been striking. To the best of our knowledge, there are no SARS CoV-2 positive paediatric cases reported with sinus bradycardia in the literature. CASE PRESENTATION: A 14-year-old male patient presented with complaints of abdominal pain and fatigue. The heart rate of the patient, whose grandmother was found to be positive for SARS CoV-2 test, ranged between 43 and 60/min, the heart sounds were normal. There was no known history of cardiological disorder in the patient and his family. His laboratory findings were; normal Troponin I, elevated C Reactive protein, normal Haemoglobin, normal CK-MB, mildly elevated D-Dimer. Electrocardiography of the patient was evaluated as sinus bradycardia. There was no pathological finding in his echocardiography. The SARS CoV-2 PCR test was positive. In his follow-up, the heart rate decreased to 50 beats per minute while awake and 43 beats per minute while sleeping. The patient had a bradycardic course until the 4th day of hospitalisation. Control SARS CoV-2 PCR test was negative. He was discharged on the 8th day. CONCLUSION: It's understood that SARS-CoV-2 is responsible for multiple cardiac manifestations. The most common bradyarrhythmia associated with SARS CoV-2 reported worldwide is sinus bradycardia and complete heart block. In order to contribute to the literature, we present a 14-year-old paediatric patient with positive SARS CoV-2 PCR test who has normal cardiac tests and sinus bradycardia.","Kilicaslan, Onder; Isancli, Didem Kizmaz; Ulutas, Omer Yilmaz; Ergin, Selma Oktay; Karbuz, Adem",Infect Dis (Lond),297,16

METHODS: We studied 4510 UK Biobank participants tested for COVID-19 (positive, n = 1326). Multivariate logistic regression models including age, sex and ethnicity were used to test whether addition of (1) cardiometabolic factors [diabetes, hypertension, high cholesterol, prior myocardial infarction, smoking and body mass index (BMI)]; (2) 25(OH)-vitamin D; (3) poor diet; (4) Townsend deprivation score; (5) housing (home type, overcrowding) or (6) behavioural factors (sociability, risk taking) attenuated sex/ethnicity associations with COVID-19 status. RESULTS: There was over-representation of men and BAME ethnicities in the COVID-19 positive group. BAME individuals had, on average, poorer cardiometabolic profile, lower 25(OH)-vitamin D, greater material deprivation, and were more likely to live in larger households and in flats/apartments. Male sex, BAME ethnicity, higher BMI, higher Townsend deprivation score and household overcrowding were independently associated with significantly greater odds of COVID-19. The pattern of association was consistent for men and women; cardiometabolic, socio-demographic and behavioural factors did not attenuate sex/ethnicity associations. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, sex and ethnicity differential pattern of COVID-19 was not adequately explained by variations in cardiometabolic factors, 25(OH)-vitamin D levels or socio-economic factors. Factors which underlie ethnic differences in COVID-19 may not be easily captured, and so investigation of alternative biological and genetic susceptibilities as well as more comprehensive assessment of the complex economic, social and behavioural differences should be prioritised.","Raisi-Estabragh, Zahra; McCracken, Celeste; Bethell, Mae S; Cooper, Jackie; Cooper, Cyrus; Caulfield, Mark J; Munroe, Patricia B; Harvey, Nicholas C; Petersen, Steffen E",J Public Health (Oxf),297,1

Through our experience and data from managing COVID-19 exposures and outbreaks in LTCFs in the Fraser Health region in British Columbia, Canada, we identified risk factors associated with outbreak severity to inform current outbreak management strategies and future pandemic preparedness planning efforts. MethodsWe used a retrospective cohort study design to evaluate the association between non-modifiable factors (facility building, organization level, and resident population characteristics), modifiable factors (assessments for infection prevention and control (IPC) and public health measures), and severity of COVID-19 outbreaks (attack rate) in LTCFs. We modelled the COVID-19 attack rates in LTCF outbreaks using negative binomial regression models. ResultsFrom March 1, 2020 to January 10, 2021, a total of 145 exposures to at least one confirmed case of COVID-19 in 82 LTCFs occurred. For every item not met in the assessment tool, a 22% increase in the attack rate was observed (rate ratio 1.2 [95% CI 1.1 - 1.4]) after adjusting for other risk factors such as age of the facility, index case type (resident vs. staff) and proportion of single bed rooms. ConclusionOur findings highlight the importance of assessing IPC and public health measures for outbreak management. They also demonstrate the important modifiable and non-modifiable risk factors associated with COVID-19 outbreaks in our jurisdiction.

These include a heavy impact on mental health due to fast changing lockdown and quarantine measures, uncertainty about health and safety and the prospect of new waves of infections. To provide crisis mental health support during the pandemic, Eötvös Loránd University in Hungary launched a specialist online counselling programme, consisting of one to three sessions. The programme was available to all university members between 4th March and 25th May 2020. Overall, 47 clients received support. In this paper we discuss challenges reported by clients, key features of providing a brief mental health intervention online, reflect on counsellor experiences and give recommendations on how mental health services could be developed in the time of crisis. Most clients had challenges with developing a daily routine under quarantine;and many had hardship related to finances, housing, and distance learning. Common mental health consequences included fear from the virus and stress, anxiety, and fatigue due to the interruption to everyday life. In some cases, more complex conditions were triggered by the pandemic. Examples include addictive behaviours and symptoms of depression or psychosis. However, referring cases beyond the competency of counselling proved to be a challenge due to the closure of specialist services. Counsellors observed three key features to the online delivery of a brief crisis mental health intervention: [1] an explicit problem-oriented approach to counselling;[2] challenges of building rapport online;and [3] frames of online counselling. Counsellor experiences often overlapped with those of clients and included challenges of working from home and adjusting to online counselling methods. The possibility of online counselling allowed that mental health care could take place at all during the pandemic. Client experiences reflect findings from previous literature. Like other mental health initiatives launched to tackle COVID-19, the intervention's effectiveness was not measured given the unexpected context and short time frame for programme development. We recommend the use of impact measurement tools to develop mental health services in crises. Meanwhile, the pandemic brought to attention the need to better understand online delivery models. Counsellors should have access to training opportunities on online counselling and managing work-life balance in a remote setting. The COVID-19 counselling programme in Eötvös Loránd University, Hungary is an example of providing online mental health counselling in the time of crisis. Clearly, more studies are needed discussing delivery models and effectiveness of mental health interventions during the pandemic. Experience and knowledge sharing across practitioners should be encouraged to improve how the field reacts to unexpected, high risk events and crises.","Szlamka, Z.; Kiss, M.; Bernáth, S.; Kámán, P.; Lubani, A.; Karner, O.; Demetrovics, Z.",Frontiers in Psychiatry,297,25

A sleep deprived society faces the increased burden of COVID-related economic disruption, psychosocial problems, substance abuse, and suicide. Disordered sleep is not expected to disappear with control of infection, making interventions acutely necessary. The question becomes how to manage the sleep dysfunction during and after the pandemic. Depression and anxiety are prominent complaints during pandemic restrictions. Insomnia symptoms and fatigue continue even as mood improves in those who are in recovery from COVID-19 infection. Management of disturbed sleep and mental health is particularly needed in frontline health care workers. This overview describes 53 publications, as of February 2021, on disturbed sleep during the pandemic, treatment studies on COVID-related sleep disturbance, and need to rely on current treatment guidelines for common sleep disorders. The available research during the first year of COVID-19 has generally described symptoms of poor sleep rather than addressing treatment strategies. It covers digital cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-i) for the public and frontline workers, recognizing the need of greater acceptance and efficacy of controlled trials of CBT for affected groups. Recommendations based on a tiered public health model are discussed.","Becker, Philip M",Sleep medicine,297,24

We retrospectively reviewed the medical charts of patients diagnosed with Moraxella spp. keratitis at the Quinze-Vingts National Ophthalmology Hospital, Paris, France, between January 2016 and December 2018. Definitive microbiological identification was performed on archival strains using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight coupled to mass spectrometry. One hundred one culture-proven cases of Moraxella keratitis were identified. The most common isolates were Moraxella lacunata (50%) and Moraxella nonliquefasciens (38%). Systemic predisposing factors, principally diabetes mellitus (13%) were identified in 28% of patients, and 87% of patients had ocular surface conditions, including blepharitis (25%), prior ocular surgery (21%), glaucoma (17%), exposure keratopathy (16%), and trauma (16%). Severely affected inpatients were treated empirically with fortified antibiotics including vancomycin, piperacillin, and gentamicin. The presence of hypopyon and being over the age of 60 years were associated with a poorer final visual acuity (p < 0.05). Adjuvant treatment, mostly amniotic membrane transplantation, was required for 31 eyes. The prognostic factors significantly associated with the need for adjuvant treatment were a larger infiltrate and hypoesthesia. The clinical features including ulcer healing, treatment duration, and infiltrate size were not different between Moraxella species. Keratitis caused by Moraxella spp. are rare in France but may threaten sight. The early identification of patients with a poor ocular surface, particularly those with neurotrophic keratopathy and anesthetic cornea, is crucial to prevent delayed healing of ulcers and the need for adjuvant treatment.","Hoarau, Gautier; Merabet, Lilia; Brignole-Baudouin, Françoise; Mizrahi, Assaf; Borderie, Vincent; Bouheraoua, Nacim",Eur. j. clin. microbiol. infect. dis,297,20

Researchers are continuously searching for any possible cure and/or vaccine, but no conclusive report is available till date. Like many others, we realize that a rapid, immediate, and elaborate strategy must be adopted to protect mankind. To avoid the time-loss due to clinical trials, we have performed in silico analyses on some FDA-approved drugs to combat COVID-19. We accessed information from public databases and publications, and studied the mechanism of infection of SARS-CoV-2 and the interactions of various drugs with SARS-CoV-2 proteins in silico. We found a few antivirals and antiparasitic drugs to show significant interactions with important SARS-CoV-2 proteins. Particularly Galidesivir, Remdesivir, and Pirodavir have been chosen as suggested antiviral drugs; and Proguanil, Mefloquine, and Artesunate have been chosen as suggested antiparasitic drugs based on such predicted interactions. In addition, inhibitors to prevent host-cell entry and a few supportive immune-boosters can be used in different combinations. Our study proposes a four-way attack to this fatal virus for the possible management of COVID-19 armed up with an antiviral, an antiparasitic drug, a cell-entry inhibitor, and a few supportive immune-boosters, which can be used in different combinations in different groups of people.","Roy Chattopadhyay, Nabanita; Chatterjee, Koustav; Banerjee, Antara; Choudhuri, Tathagata",Virusdisease,297,20

We used Ohlson (1995) model to estimate financial market reaction and sensitivity to earnings manipulation fluctuations and accounting information. The results show that companies practice earnings manipulation to maintain earnings over a time series, which means a negative impact of earnings manipulation on all earnings measures' value relevance (EPS, BVS, and CFS). Accordingly, earnings manipulation negatively influences investor behavior in the financial market, based mainly on financial reporting. The value relevance of financial reports has also decreased because of the COVID-19 outbreak and related economic Lockdown. These results reflect a long-term adverse impact of earnings manipulation on investor behavior and financial statements reliability.","Aljawaheri, B. A. W.; Ojah, H. K.; Machi, A. H.; Almagtome, A.

Objectives: To evaluate adverse outcomes associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in pregnancy and to describe clinical management, disease progression, hospital admission, placental abnormalities, and neonatal outcomes. Design, Setting, and Participants: This observational cohort study of maternal and neonatal outcomes among delivered women with and without SARS-CoV-2 during pregnancy was conducted from March 18 through August 22, 2020, at Parkland Health and Hospital System (Dallas, Texas), a high-volume prenatal clinic system and public maternity hospital with widespread access to SARS-CoV-2 testing in outpatient, emergency department, and inpatient settings. Women were included if they were tested for SARS-CoV-2 during pregnancy and delivered. For placental analysis, the pathologist was blinded to illness severity. Exposures: SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was a composite of preterm birth, preeclampsia with severe features, or cesarean delivery for abnormal fetal heart rate among women delivered after 20 weeks of gestation. Maternal illness severity, neonatal infection, and placental abnormalities were described. Results: From March 18 through August 22, 2020, 3374 pregnant women (mean [SD] age, 27.6 [6] years) tested for SARS-CoV-2 were delivered, including 252 who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and 3122 who tested negative. The cohort included 2520 Hispanic (75%), 619 Black (18%), and 125 White (4%) women. There were no differences in age, parity, body mass index, or diabetes among women with or without SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 positivity was more common among Hispanic women (230 [91%] positive vs 2290 [73%] negative; difference, 17.9%; 95% CI, 12.3%-23.5%; P < .001). There was no difference in the composite primary outcome (52 women [21%] vs 684 women [23%]; relative risk, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.73-1.21; P = .64). Early neonatal SARS-CoV-2 infection occurred in 6 of 188 tested infants (3%), primarily born to asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic women. There were no placental pathologic differences by illness severity. Maternal illness at initial presentation was asymptomatic or mild in 239 women (95%), and 6 of those women (3%) developed severe or critical illness. Fourteen women (6%) were hospitalized for the indication of COVID-19. Conclusions and Relevance: In a large, single-institution cohort study, SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy was not associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes. Neonatal infection may be as high as 3% and may occur predominantly among asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic women. Placental abnormalities were not associated with disease severity, and hospitalization frequency was similar to rates among nonpregnant women.","Adhikari, Emily H; Moreno, Wilmer; Zofkie, Amanda C; MacDonald, Lorre; McIntire, Donald D; Collins, Rebecca R J; Spong, Catherine Y",JAMA Netw Open,297,20

METHODS: All citizens above ten years of age resident in 5 municipalities of the Autonomous Province of Trento, with the highest incidence of COVID-19 cases, were invited to participate in the study. Overall, among 6098 participants, 6075 sera and a standardized questionnaire administered face-to-face were collected between May 5 and 15, 2020 and examined. Symptomatic individuals and their family contacts were tested by RT-PCR. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were detected using an Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay which was performed on the Abbott Architect i2000SR automated analyzer. Seroprevalence was calculated as the proportion of positive people on the total number of tested. A multivariable logistic regression model was performed to assess the relationship between seropositive versus seronegative individuals for a set of explanatory variables. RESULTS: A total of 1402 participants were positives for IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, with a prevalence of 23.1% (1402/6075). The highest prevalence was found in the age class 40-49 years. Overall, 34.4% (2096/6098) of the participants reported at least 1 symptom. The ratio between reported cases identified by molecular test and those resulting seropositive was 1:3, with a maximum ratio of about 1:7 in the age group <20 years and a minimum around 1:1 in those >70 years old. The infection fatality rate was 2.5% (35/1402). Among the symptoms, anosmia and ageusia were strongly associated with seropositivity. CONCLUSIONS: The estimated seroprevalence of 23% was 3-fold higher than the number of cases reported in the COVID-19 Integrated Surveillance data in the study area.

It remains, however, controversial whether COVID-19-induced endothelial injury is caused directly by the infection of ECs with SARS-CoV-2 or via indirect mechanisms. One of the major concerns is raised by the contradictory data supporting or denying the presence of ACE2, the SARS-CoV-2 binding receptor, on the EC surface. Here, we show that primary human pulmonary artery ECs possess ACE2 capable of interaction with the viral Spike protein (S-protein) and demonstrate the crucial role of the endothelial glycocalyx in the regulation of the S-protein binding to ACE2 on ECs. Using force spectroscopy method, we directly measured ACE2- and glycocalyx-dependent adhesive forces between S-protein and ECs and characterized the nanomechanical parameters of the cells exposed to S-protein. We revealed that the intact glycocalyx strongly binds S-protein but screens its interaction with ACE2. Reduction of glycocalyx layer exposes ACE2 receptors and promotes their interaction with S-protein. These results indicate that the susceptibility of ECs to COVID-19 infection may depend on the glycocalyx condition.","Targosz-Korecka, Marta; Kubisiak, Agata; Kloska, Damian; Kopacz, Aleksandra; Grochot-Przeczek, Anna; Szymonski, Marek",Sci Rep,297,5

All experiments were based on crown preparation of an artificial maxillary central incisor using a high-speed air turbine over a ten-minute period. Fluorescein dye was introduced into the irrigation system of the handpiece (model 1) and the mannequin's mouth was used to simulate salivary flow (model 2) under varying experimental conditions (suction flow rate, cross ventilation and exposure time). Six experiments were conducted in the open plan clinic while three experiments were undertaken in the clinical laboratory. Customised rigs with collection platforms consisting of filter papers were placed in open plan bays and adjacent walkways. Samples were also collected from a 400 cm2 area in each of the eight adjacent bays. Time course experiments repeated the same procedures on three occasions in a clinical laboratory and utilised a rig with eight four-metre rods supporting collection platforms around a dental mannequin. The distribution of fluorescein dye was analysed by fluoroscopy and spectrofluorometry.Results Contamination levels showed variations under different experimental conditions. In the absence of suction and cross ventilation, contamination was observed at large distances. Use of suction reduced contamination in the operating bay by 53% and 81.83%, while cross ventilation reduced contamination in adjacent and distant areas by 80-89%. Minimal contamination was detected at a distance of >5 m from the operating bay, with the use of medium-volume suction demonstrating that 1.5-metre-high partitions with open fronts limit 99.99% of splatter from aerosol generating procedures (AGPs) to the operating bay. Minimal additional aerosol contamination was detected ten minutes after the procedure.Conclusions Contamination from dental AGPS has the potential to contaminate distant sites in open plan clinics. Risk of cross infection is small if the bays are >5 m apart and contamination can be minimised with the use of suction and cross ventilation.","Ali, Kamran; Raja, Mahwish",Evid Based Dent,297,14

Here we present SARSeq, saliva analysis by RNA sequencing, a method to detect SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses on tens of thousands of samples in parallel. SARSeq relies on next generation sequencing of multiple amplicons generated in a multiplexed RT-PCR reaction. Two-dimensional, unique dual indexing, using four indices per sample, enables unambiguous and scalable assignment of reads to individual samples. We calibrate SARSeq on SARS-CoV-2 synthetic RNA, virions, and hundreds of human samples of various types. Robustness and sensitivity were virtually identical to quantitative RT-PCR. Double-blinded benchmarking to gold standard quantitative-RT-PCR performed by human diagnostics laboratories confirms this high sensitivity. SARSeq can be used to detect Influenza A and B viruses and human rhinovirus in parallel, and can be expanded for detection of other pathogens. Thus, SARSeq is ideally suited for differential diagnostic of infections during a pandemic.","Yelagandula, Ramesh; Bykov, Aleksandr; Vogt, Alexander; Heinen, Robert; Özkan, Ezgi; Strobl, Marcus Martin; Baar, Juliane Christina; Uzunova, Kristina; Hajdusits, Bence; Kordic, Darja; Suljic, Erna; Kurtovic-Kozaric, Amina; Izetbegovic, Sebija; Schaeffer, Justine; Hufnagl, Peter; Zoufaly, Alexander; Seitz, Tamara; Födinger, Manuela; Allerberger, Franz; Stark, Alexander; Cochella, Luisa; Elling, Ulrich",Nat Commun,297,33

Commodities trade volumes across BRI countries have boomed in the last few years. However, the waste and scrap (WaS) trade, an important aspect of global waste management, has received little attention. In recent years, frequent trade frictions and restrictive import policies due to increasing environmental protection awareness have sent massive shocks through the international WaS trade system. Exploring the impacts of shocks on BRI-WaS trade is an important but unexamined research topic that can help ensure the steady operation of WaS recycling. To address this research gap, this study first provides a panoramic view of the BRI-WaS trade network and analyzes its structural relation to the global WaS trade network. Second, the hidden risks in the BRI-WaS trade are revealed by proposed shock propagation models in three real-life scenarios, namely, a unilateral trade disruption, a bilateral trade crash and an import ban. Third, the global circulations conceptual framework is mathematically examined in the BRI regional context. The findings reveal that BRI countries are increasingly important to global WaS trade and that BRI-WaS trade presents a heterogeneous structure with evenly distributed trade channels. The “most at-risk” sources in the BRI-WaS trade network are uncovered. The BRI circulation system is mathematically feasible but eco-ethically infeasible. Discussions are provided to support authorities in developing effective strategies to manage BRI-WaS trade and responses to future extreme disturbances as well as address the global WaS crisis.","Hu, Xiaoqian Wang Chao Lim Ming K.; Bai, Xiao Yao Cuiyou","Resources, Conservation and Recycling",297,1

Crowd level data on mobile phone usage can be used as a proxy for actual population mobility patterns and provide a way of quantifying the impact of social distancing measures on changes in mobility. Methods: Here, we use two mobile phone-based datasets (anonymised and aggregated crowd level data from O2 and from the Facebook app on mobile phones) to assess changes in average mobility, both overall and broken down into high and low population density areas, and changes in the distribution of journey lengths. Results: We show that there was a substantial overall reduction in mobility, with the most rapid decline on the 24th March 2020, the day after the Prime Minister's announcement of an enforced lockdown. The reduction in mobility was highly synchronized across the UK. Although mobility has remained low since 26th March 2020, we detect a gradual increase since that time. We also show that the two different datasets produce similar trends, albeit with some location-specific differences. We see slightly larger reductions in average mobility in high-density areas than in low-density areas, with greater variation in mobility in the high-density areas: some high-density areas eliminated almost all mobility. Conclusions: These analyses form a baseline from which to observe changes in behaviour in the UK as social distancing is eased and inform policy towards the future control of SARS-CoV-2 in the UK.","Jeffrey, Benjamin; Walters, Caroline E; Ainslie, Kylie E C; Eales, Oliver; Ciavarella, Constanze; Bhatia, Sangeeta; Hayes, Sarah; Baguelin, Marc; Boonyasiri, Adhiratha; Brazeau, Nicholas F; Cuomo-Dannenburg, Gina; FitzJohn, Richard G; Gaythorpe, Katy; Green, William; Imai, Natsuko; Mellan, Thomas A; Mishra, Swapnil; Nouvellet, Pierre; Unwin, H Juliette T; Verity, Robert; Vollmer, Michaela; Whittaker, Charles; Ferguson, Neil M; Donnelly, Christl A; Riley, Steven",Wellcome Open Res,297,14

This paper presents an epidemiological analysis of the first phase of the COVID-19 epidemic in Poland. MATERIAL AND METHODS This cross-sectional study was carried out between 3 and 27 March 2020 on a sample of 1389 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases in Poland. Data were obtained from epidemiological reports collected by the Chief Sanitary Inspectorate. Analysis includes the number of COVID-19 cases, number of deaths, number of hospitalizations, number of people quarantined, and number of laboratory tests performed. RESULTS The first case was confirmed on 4 March 2020. Over 24 days after the first case, the total number of confirmed infections rose to 1389 (34,000 laboratory tests were performed). The highest incidence rates (over 5 per 100,000) were observed in the 2 central administrative regions (Mazowieckie and Lódzkie) and in the south-western region of Dolnoslaskie, which borders the Czech Republic and Germany. Based on available data about age and sex, a clearly higher incidence was observed in the 20-29 years (4.0 per 100,000), 40-49 years (4.1 per 100,000), and 50-59 years (4.3 per 100,000) age groups. In the period analyzed (24 days), there were 16 confirmed deaths (average age 65.5 years; 81.2% males). CONCLUSIONS The proportion of women and men with confirmed COVID-19 infection was similar to the sex ratio in the general population. Infections were relatively less common in those aged under 20 years. The largest numbers of confirmed cases were detected in 3 of the 4 largest cities, each of which has an international airport.","Gujski, Mariusz; Raciborski, Filip; Jankowski, Mateusz; Nowicka, Paulina Maria; Rakocy, Kamil; Pinkas, Jaroslaw",Med Sci Monit,297,24

The yield of BAL for the diagnosis of suspected or confirmed pulmonary SARS-CoV-2 infection is still unknown. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to evaluate the diagnostic ratio of BAL in detecting SARS-CoV-2 pulmonary infection in patients undergoing bronchoscopy for different indications as well as describe the clinical, radiological, and endoscopic characteristics of patients with SARS-CoV-2 on BAL. METHOD: We conducted a multicenter retrospective study including all patients who underwent bronchoscopy for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 on BAL. Clinical, computed tomography (CT), endoscopic, and microbiologic data were gathered from March 16th to May 27th, 2020. RESULTS: 131 patients were included. Bronchoscopy was performed for suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection (65.5%), alternative diagnosis (12.9%), suspected superinfections (19.8%), and lung atelectasis (1.5%). SARS-CoV-2 was isolated on BAL 43 times (32.8%) and the highest isolation rate was in patients with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection (74.4%); 76% of positive patients had a double-negative nasopharyngeal swab. Peripheral, posterior and multilobar CT opacities were more frequent in SARS-CoV-2 patients, and the number of CT findings was higher in positive patients, particularly those with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection. We recorded a progressive reduction of SARS-CoV-2 isolation during the observation period. CONCLUSIONS: In our centers, the rate of detection of SARS-CoV-2 on BAL in patients with suspected infection was 37.2%. The agreement of BAL with nasopharyngeal swabs was high; CT alterations could predict the pretest probability of SARS-CoV-2 infection, but suspicion of viral infection should be always considered.","Patrucco, Filippo; Albera, Carlo; Bellocchia, Michela; Foci, Valentina; Gavelli, Francesco; Castello, Luigi Mario; Bellan, Mattia; Sainaghi, Pier Paolo; Airoldi, Chiara; Balbo, Piero Emilio; Solidoro, Paolo",Respiration,297,1

Exploration of trends within the existing COVID-19 data may guide directions for further study and novel treatment development. As the world faces COVID-19 disease, it is essential to study its epidemiological and clinical characteristics further to better understand and aid in its detection and containment. METHODS: We aimed to study the clinical characteristics of patients infected with COVID-19 in Dubai, a multi-national Society. RESULTS: Our findings demonstrate that during the first wave of the COVID-19 epidemic, age, gender, and country of origin were associated with more severe cases of COVID-19, higher risk for hospitalization and death. Male individuals between 41 and 60 years of age from India had the most significant hospitalization and death predictor (p=.0001). The predictors for COVID-19 related deaths were slightly less than UAE Nationals by individuals from GCC (p=.02) that were followed closely behind by Pilipino (p=.02) and Arabs (p=.001). CONCLUSION: The vulnerability of individuals to infection and in the spectrum of COVID-19 symptoms remains to be understood.

With Germany's lockdown as one of the more severe governmentally imposed epidemic-control-decisions, we tested to what extent the frequency of outdoor cycling activities changed from March to June 2020. METHODS: User behaviour and frequency in 15 urban and 7 rural German public green spaces was quantified using cycling data from the fitness application Strava. Changes in cycling activities were analysed with four different generalised linear models, correcting for factors like weather conditions and temporal changes in the user base of the fitness application. RESULTS: We found a clear increase in outdoor cycling sport activities in urban public green spaces in response to epidemic-control decisions (e.g. increase by 81% in April relative to the expected value (95% CI [48%, 110%])). In contrast, biking in rural areas showed no significant change with epidemic-control-decisions in place. CONCLUSION: Fitness App data, e.g. from Strava, can be used to monitor visitor behaviour and frequency. The increase in outdoor cycling activities during epidemic control decisions likely reflects a shift of sport activities from indoor and team sports to outdoor and individual sports. This highlights the importance of accessible green space for maintaining physical fitness and health. Beyond this shift, it is likely that outdoor activities may be of particularly importance for stress relief in times of crisis such as the current COVID-19 pandemic.","Schweizer, Anne-Maria; Leiderer, Anna; Mitterwallner, Veronika; Walentowitz, Anna; Mathes, Gregor Hans; Steinbauer, Manuel Jonas",PLoS One,297,16

We examined the pandemic's impact on an established longitudinal cohort of TGNB individuals (N = 208) by administering an online survey between March-June 2020. We used multivariable linear regression to examine reduced LGBTQ/TGNB community support and disruptions in gender-affirming health care as predictors of psychological distress during the pandemic. We found that the pandemic exacerbated ongoing mental health disparities for TGNB individuals. Furthermore, reduced LGBTQ/TGNB support was associated with increased psychological distress during the pandemic. Interruption and/or delay in gender-affirming health care was not associated with increased psychological distress during the pandemic. Special attention is needed to address the unique ways in which TGNB individuals were affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. This includes increasing access to LGBTQ/TGNB community support and addressing long-standing health disparities.","Kidd, Jeremy D; Jackman, Kasey B; Barucco, Renato; Dworkin, Jordan D; Dolezal, Curtis; Navalta, Theresa V; Belloir, Joseph; Bockting, Walter O",J Homosex,297,16

METHODS: A single-center, retrospective cohort study was conducted from a random sample of 733 adult patients (age &#8805; 18 years) obtained from a total of 4356 laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases who presented to the Emergency Department of Montefiore Medical Center between March-June 2020. The primary outcome was a composite endpoint of in-hospital severe outcomes of COVID-19. A secondary outcome was in-hospital all-cause mortality. RESULTS: Among the 733 patients included in our final analysis, 438 patients (59.8%) presented with anemia. 105 patients (14.3%) had mild, and 333 patients (45.5%) had moderate-severe anemia. Overall, 437 patients (59.6%) had a composite endpoint of severe outcomes. On-admission anemia was an independent risk factor for all-cause mortality, (Odds Ratio 1.52, 95% CI [1.01-2.30], p = 0.046) but not for composite severe outcomes. However, moderate-severe anemia (Hb < 11 g/dL) on admission was independently associated with both severe outcomes (OR1.53, 95% CI [1.05-2.23], p = 0.028) and mortality (OR 1.67, 95% CI [1.09-2.56], p = 0.019) during hospitalization. CONCLUSION: Anemia on admission was independently associated with increased odds of all-cause mortality in patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Furthermore, moderate-severe anemia (Hb <11 g/dL) was an independent risk factor for severe COVID-19 outcomes. Moving forward, COVID-19 patient management and risk stratification may benefit from addressing anemia on admission.","Oh, Seung Mi; Skendelas, John P; Macdonald, Eric; Bergamini, Michael; Goel, Swati; Choi, Jaeun; Segal, Kathryn R; Vivek, Kumar; Nair, Singh; Leff, Jonathan",Am J Emerg Med,297,25

STUDY DESIGN: National cross-sectional community survey. SETTING: Australian general public. PARTICIPANTS: Adults aged over 18 years (N = 4362). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Knowledge, attitudes and behaviours related to COVID-19; health literacy and sociodemographic factors. RESULTS: People with inadequate health literacy had poorer understanding of COVID-19 symptoms (49% vs 68%; p < 0.001), were less able to identify behaviours to prevent infection (59%% vs 72% p < 0.001), and experienced more difficulty finding information and understanding government messaging about COVID-19 than people with adequate health literacy. People with inadequate health literacy were less likely to rate social distancing as important (6.1 vs 6.5; p < 0.001) and reported more difficulty with remembering and accessing medicines since lockdown (3.6 vs 2.7; p < 0.001). People with lower health literacy were also more likely to endorse misinformed beliefs about COVID-19 and vaccinations (in general) than those with adequate health literacy. The same pattern of results was observed among people who primarily speak a language other than English at home. CONCLUSION: Our findings show that there are important disparities in COVID-19-related knowledge, attitudes and behaviours according to people's health literacy and language. These have the potential to undermine efforts to reduce viral transmission and may lead to social inequalities in health outcomes in Australia. People with the greatest burden of chronic disease are most disadvantaged, and are also most likely to experience severe disease and die from COVID-19.

Most of them are undetected, because of a large number of asymptomatic cases. We provide an efficient, easy to compute and robust lower bound estimator for the number of undetected cases. METHODS: A modified version of the Chao estimator is proposed, based on the cumulative time-series distributions of cases and deaths. Heterogeneity has been addressed by assuming a geometrical distribution underlying the data generation process. An (approximated) analytical variance of the estimator has been derived to compute reliable confidence intervals at 95% level. RESULTS: A motivating application to the Austrian situation is provided and compared with an independent and representative study on prevalence of Covid-19 infection. Our estimates match well with the results from the independent prevalence study, but the capture-recapture estimate has less uncertainty involved as it is based on a larger sample size. Results from other European countries are mentioned in the discussion. The estimated ratio of the total estimated cases to the observed cases is around the value of 2.3 for all the analyzed countries. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed method answers to a fundamental open question: ""How many undetected cases are going around?"". CR methods provide a straightforward solution to shed light on undetected cases, incorporating heterogeneity that may arise in the probability of being detected.","Böhning, Dankmar; Rocchetti, Irene; Maruotti, Antonello; Holling, Heinz",Int J Infect Dis,297,18

Smartphone-connected spirometers, like the Air Next spirometer, have been developed to aid in the home monitoring of patients with pulmonary disease. The aim of this study was to investigate the technical validity and usability of the Air Next spirometer in pediatric patients. METHODS: Device variability was tested with a calibrated syringe. About 90 subjects, aged 6 to 16, were included in a prospective cohort study. Fifty-eight subjects performed conventional spirometry and subsequent Air Next spirometry. The bias and the limits of agreement between the measurements were calculated. Furthermore, subjects used the device for 28 days at home and completed a subject-satisfaction questionnaire at the end of the study period. RESULTS: Interdevice variability was 2.8% and intradevice variability was 0.9%. The average difference between the Air Next and conventional spirometry was 40 mL for forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) and 3 mL for forced vital capacity (FVC). The limits of agreement were -270 mL and +352 mL for FEV1 and -403 mL and +397 mL for FVC. About 45% of FEV1 measurements and 41% of FVC measurements at home were acceptable and reproducible according to American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society criteria. Parents scored difficulty, usefulness, and reliability of the device 1.9, 3.5, and 3.8 out of 5, respectively.

The interest in anti-coronavirus drug development has been limited so far and effective methods to prevent or treat coronavirus infections in humans are still lacking. Urgent action is needed to fight this fatal coronavirus infection by reducing the number of infected people along with the infection contagiousness and severity. Since the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak several weeks ago, we observe in GHU PARIS Psychiatrie & Neurosciences (Sainte-Anne hospital, Paris, France) a lower prevalence of symptomatic and severe forms of COVID-19 infections in psychiatric patients (â¼4%) compared to health care professionals (â¼14%). Similar observations have been noted in other psychiatric units in France and abroad. Our hypothesis is that psychiatric patients could be protected from severe forms of COVID-19 by their psychotropic treatments. Chlorpromazine (CPZ) is a phenothiazine derivative widely used in clinical routine in the treatment of acute and chronic psychoses. This first antipsychotic medication has been discovered in 1952 by Jean Delay and Pierre Deniker at Sainte-Anne hospital. In addition, to its antipsychotic effects, several in vitro studies have also demonstrated a CPZ antiviral activity via the inhibition of clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Recently, independent studies revealed that CPZ is an anti-MERS-CoV and an anti-SARS-CoV-1 drug. In comparison to other antiviral drugs, the main advantages of CPZ lie in its biodistribution: (i) preclinical and clinical studies have reported a high CPZ concentration in the lungs (20-200 times higher than in plasma), which is critical because of the respiratory tropism of SARS-CoV-2; (ii) CPZ is highly concentrated in saliva (30-100 times higher than in plasma) and could therefore reduce the contagiousness of COVID-19; (iii) CPZ can cross the blood-brain barrier and could therefore prevent the neurological forms of COVID-19. METHODS: Our hypothesis is that CPZ could decrease the unfavorable evolution of COVID-19 infection in oxygen-requiring patients without the need for intensive care, but also reduce the contagiousness of SARS-CoV-2. At this end, we designed a pilot, phase III, multicenter, single blind, randomized controlled clinical trial. Efficacy of CPZ will be assessed according to clinical, biological and radiological criteria. The main objective is to demonstrate a shorter time to response (TTR) to treatment in the CPZ+standard-of-care (CPZ+SOC) group, compared to the SOC group. Response to treatment is defined by a reduction of at least one level of severity on the WHO-Ordinal Scale for Clinical Improvement (WHO-OSCI). The secondary objectives are to demonstrate in the CPZ+SOC group, compared to the SOC group: (A) superior clinical improvement; (B) a greater decrease in the biological markers of viral attack by SARS-CoV-2 (PCR, viral load); (C) a greater decrease in inflammatory markers (e.g. CRP and lymphopenia); (D) a greater decrease in parenchymal involvement (chest CT) on the seventh day post-randomization; (E) to define the optimal dosage of CPZ and its tolerance; (F) to evaluate the biological parameters of response to treatment, in particular the involvement of inflammatory cytokines. Patient recruitment along with the main and secondary objectives are in line with WHO 2020 COVID-19 guidelines. CONCLUSION: This repositioning of CPZ as an anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug offers an alternative and rapid strategy to alleviate the virus propagation and the infection severity and lethality. This CPZ repositioning strategy also avoids numerous developmental and experimental steps and can save precious time to rapidly establish an anti-COVID-19 therapy with well-known, limited and easy to manage side effects. Indeed, CPZ is an FDA-approved drug with an excellent tolerance profile, prescribed for around 70 years in psychiatry but also in clinical routine in nausea and vomiting of pregnancy, in advanced cancer and also to treat headaches in various neurological conditions. The broad spectrum of CPZ treatment - including antipsychotic, anxiolytic, antiemetic, antiviral, immunomodulatory effects along with inhibition of clathrin-mediated endocytosis and modulation of blood-brain barrier - is in line with the historical French commercial name for CPZ, i.e. LARGACTIL, chosen as a reference to its ""LARGe ACTion"" properties. The discovery of those CPZ properties, as for many other molecules in psychiatry, is both the result of serendipity and careful clinical observations. Using this approach, the field of mental illness could provide innovative therapeutic approaches to fight SARS-CoV-2.","Plaze, M; Attali, D; Petit, A-C; Blatzer, M; Simon-Loriere, E; Vinckier, F; Cachia, A; Chrétien, F; Gaillard, R",Encephale,297,16

One of the most concerning aspects of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemics is that it disproportionately affects people from Black and African American backgrounds creating an unexpected infection gap. Interestingly, the abnormal impact on these ethnic groups seem to be almost uncorrelated with other risk factors, including co-morbidity, poverty, level of education, access to healthcare, residential segregation, and response to cures. A proposed explanation for the observed incidence gap is that people from African American backgrounds are more often employed in low-income service jobs, and are thus more exposed to infection through face-to-face contacts, but the lack of direct data has not allowed to draw strong conclusions in this sense so far. Here we introduce the concept of dynamic segregation, that is the extent to which a given group of people is internally clustered or exposed to other groups, as a result of mobility and commuting habits. By analysing census and mobility data on more than 120 major US cities, we found that the dynamic segregation of African American communities is significantly associated with the weekly excess COVID-19 incidence and mortality in those communities. The results confirm that knowing where people commute to, rather than where they live, is much more relevant for disease modelling.","Bassolas, Aleix; Sousa, Sandro; Nicosia, Vincenzo",,297,16

METHODS: Individuals living in Marion County with no symptoms of coronavirus 2019 disease (COVID-19) within seven days of enrollment were eligible for this cross-sectional household study. Study kits were delivered to the participant's residence for self-swabbing, picked up by the study team, and tested by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for SAR-CoV-2 infection. RESULTS: Five hundred eleven nasal swabs were collected from 119 children and 392 adults &#8805;18 years of age. One participant (seven years of age) tested positive, for an overall study prevalence of 0.2% (95% CI 0, 0.6%).

Risk of severe infection and mortality increases with age, male sex, and comorbidities including cardiovascular disease, hypertension, obesity, diabetes, and chronic pulmonary disease. We review clinical and neuroradiological findings in five patients with COVID-19 who suffered severe neurological disease and illustrate the pathological findings in a 7-year-old boy with COVID-19-induced encephalopathy whose brain tissue sample showed angiocentric mixed mononuclear inflammatory infiltrate. We summarize the structural and functional properties of the virus including the molecular processes that govern the binding to its membrane receptors and cellular entry. In addition, we review clinical and experimental evidence in patients and animal models that suggests coronaviruses enter into the central nervous system (CNS), either via the olfactory bulb or through hematogenous spread. We discuss suspected pathophysiological mechanisms including direct cellular infection and associated recruitment of immune cells and neurovirulence, at least in part, mediated by cytokine secretion. Moreover, contributing to the vascular and neurological injury, coagulopathic disorders play an important pathogenic role. We survey the molecular events that contribute to the thrombotic microangiopathy. We describe the neurological complications associated with COVID-19 with a focus on the potential mechanisms of neurovascular injury. Our thesis is that following infection, three main pathophysiological processes-inflammation, thrombosis, and vascular injury-are responsible for the neurological damage and diverse pathology seen in COVID-19 patients.","Gutierrez Amezcua, Jose Manuel; Jain, Rajan; Kleinman, George; Muh, Carrie R; Guzzetta, Melissa; Folkerth, Rebecca; Snuderl, Matija; Placantonakis, Dimitris G; Galetta, Steven L; Hochman, Sarah; Zagzag, David",SN Compr Clin Med,297,16

By comparing the distributions of various parameters of synthetic pulsars detectable by the Parkes Multibeam Pulsar Survey, the Pulsar Arecibo L-band Feed Array Survey, and two Swinburne Multibeam surveys with those of the real pulsars detected by the same surveys, we find that a good and physically realistic model can be obtained by using a uniform distribution of the braking index in the range of 2.5 to 3.0, a uniform distribution of the cosine of the angle between the spin and the magnetic axis in the range of 0 to 1, a log-normal birth distribution of the surface magnetic field with the mean and the standard deviation as 12.85 and 0.55 respectively while keeping the distributions of other parameters unchanged from the ones most commonly used in the literature. We have also replaced the universal 'death-line' by a `death-condition' specific to each individual pulsar. We find that our model is better than the most popular model. With our improved model, we predict that an all-sky pulsar survey with phase-I SKA-MID will detect about nine thousand normal pulsars in the Galactic field. Among these pulsars, a considerable number will produce continuous gravitational waves in the operational range of the future ground-based gravitational waves detectors like LIGO A$+$, and in certain cases, the spin-down limit of the gravitational wave strains will be well below the detection sensitivity limit. We also provide a fit for the present-day distributions of the spin periods and 1400 MHz luminosities of the whole normal pulsar population in the Galactic field (which are potentially observable) and those can be used in future population studies under the snapshot approach.","Chakraborty, Anirban; Bagchi, Manjari",,297,15

However, the underlying mechanisms of the inactivated COVID-19 vaccine-induced immune response remain unclear, and little is known about its features compared to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Here, we implemented single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to profile longitudinally collected PBMCs (peripheral blood mononuclear cells) in six individuals immunized with CoronaVac and compared these to the profiles of COVID-19 infected patients from a Single Cell Consortium. Both inactivated vaccines and SARS-CoV-2 infection drove changes in immune cell type proportions, caused B cell activation and differentiation, and induced the expression of genes associated with antibody production in the plasma. The inactivated vaccine and SARS-COV-2 infection also caused alterations in peripheral immune activity such as interferon response, inflammatory cytokine expression, innate immune cell apoptosis and migration, effector T cell exhaustion and cytotoxicity, however, the magnitude of change was greater in COVID-19 patients, especially those with severe disease, than in immunized individuals. Further analyses revealed a distinct peripheral immune cell phenotype associated with CoronaVac immunization (HLA class II upregulation and IL21R upregulation in naive B cells) versus SARS-CoV-2 infection (HLA class II downregulation and IL21R downregulation in naive B cells severe disease). There were also differences in the expression of important genes associated with proinflammatory cytokines and thrombosis. In conclusion, this study provides a single-cell atlas of the systemic immune response to CoronaVac immunization and reveals distinct immune responses between inactivated vaccines and SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Wang, Yi; Wang, Xiaoxia; Luu, Laurence Don Wai; Li, Jieqiong; Cui, Xiaodai; Yao, Hailan; Zhang, Xin; Chen, Shaojin; Fu, Jin; Wang, Licheng; Wang, Chongzhen; Yuan, Rui; Cai, Qinguo; Huang, Xiaolan; Huang, Junfei; Xu, Wenjian; Li, Shijun; Zhu, Xiong; Tai, Jun",,297,10

PURPOSE: Medication reconciliation (MR) is a complicated and tedious process but is crucial to prevent errors when ordering patients' discharge medications during a hospital admission. Our institution currently uses a variety of methods to gather a patient's medication history, including review of the medical records and electronic pharmaceutical claims data (EPCD) from a commercial health information exchange organization, as well as a patient or caregiver interview. Occasionally, more information is needed to obtain the most accurate history. To augment current methods, EPCD can also be accessed for patients with Medicaid insurance using a state Medicaid Web portal. We aimed to evaluate the utility of the Medicaid Web portal for reducing medication errors during the MR process at hospital admission. SUMMARY: A single-center, prospective, quality improvement initiative was conducted to evaluate 100 patient medication lists for all nonobstetric Medicaid patients admitted to our institution to identify discrepancies in medication lists when the state Medicaid Web portal was used in addition to standard MR methods. We found that, when EPCD from commercial organizations were available, they matched the patient's current medication list 64% of the time. One in 4 patients had at least 1 discrepancy on their verified medication list that was identified using the Medicaid Web portal. The discrepancies identified were addressed and corrected in real time to improve patient care. CONCLUSION: EPCD from the state Medicaid Web portal could supplement the use of current methods to obtain a more accurate medication history and reduce the number of erroneously ordered discharge medications during hospital admission.","Parks, Lauren K; McGrane, Ian R; Hartzell, Jayme L",Am. j. health system pharm,297,29

COVID-19 test results must be documented before performing procedures. If procedures are to be performed without a COVID-19 test, full PPE use is recommended, along with all social distancing and infection control measures. Because patients with suspected motility disorders may require multiple procedures, sequential scheduling of procedures should be considered to minimize need for repeat COVID-19 testing.

During that time, memory B cells express increasingly broad and potent antibodies that are resistant to mutations found in variants of concern1. As a result, vaccination of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) convalescent individuals with currently available mRNA vaccines produces high levels of plasma neutralizing activity against all variants tested1, 2. Here, we examine memory B cell evolution 5 months after vaccination with either Moderna (mRNA-1273) or Pfizer- BioNTech (BNT162b2) mRNA vaccines in a cohort of SARS-CoV-2 naive individuals. Between prime and boost, memory B cells produce antibodies that evolve increased neutralizing activity, but there is no further increase in potency or breadth thereafter. Instead, memory B cells that emerge 5 months after vaccination of naive individuals express antibodies that are similar to those that dominate the initial response. While individual memory antibodies selected over time by natural infection have greater potency and breadth than antibodies elicited by vaccination, the overall neutralizing potency of plasma is greater following vaccination. These results suggest that boosting vaccinated individuals with currently available mRNA vaccines will increase plasma neutralizing activity but may not produce antibodies with breadth equivalent to those obtained by vaccinating convalescent individuals.","Cho, Alice; Muecksch, Frauke; Schaefer-Babajew, Dennis; Wang, Zijun; Finkin, Shlomo; Gaebler, Christian; Ramos, Victor; Cipolla, Melissa; Mendoza, Pilar; Agudelo, Marianna; Bednarski, Eva; DaSilva, Justin; Shimeliovich, Irina; Dizon, Juan; Daga, Mridushi; Millard, Katrina; Turroja, Martina; Schmidt, Fabian; Zhang, Fengwen; Tanfous, Tarek Ben; Jankovic, Mila; Oliveira, Thiago; Gazumyan, Anna; Caskey, Marina; Bieniasz, Paul D; Hatziioannou, Theodora; Nussenzweig, Michel C.",,297,16

DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Inpatient units at The Mount Sinai Hospital. PATIENTS: Adults age &#8805;18 admitted between March 1, 2020 and April 9, 2020 with confirmed COVID-19 infection with at least 28 days follow-up. MEASUREMENTS: We captured baseline demographic, pre-hospitalization antiplatelet medication use, and clinical encounter data for all patients who met inclusion criteria. The primary endpoint was peak score on a 6-point modified ordinal scale (MOS), which is based on World Health Organization blueprint R&S groups, used to grade severity of illness through clinical outcomes of interest. Scores indicate the following: 1 - COVID-19 infection not requiring hospitalization, 2 - requiring hospitalization but not supplemental oxygen, 3 - hospitalization requiring supplemental oxygen, 4 - hospitalization requiring high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) or non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV), 5 - hospitalization requiring intubation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), 6 - death. Multivariable adjusted partial proportional odds model (PPOM) was performed to examine the association between pre-hospitalization antiplatelet medication use and likelihood of each MOS score. MAIN RESULTS: Of 762 people admitted with COVID-19, 239 (31.4%) used antiplatelet medications pre-hospitalization while 523 (68.6%) did not. Antiplatelet users were older and had more co-morbidities at baseline. Before adjusting for covariates, patients who used antiplatelet medications pre-hospitalization were more likely than non-users to have peak MOS score 6 (death, OR 1.75, 95% CI 1.21-2.52), peak MOS score &#8805;5 (intubation/ECMO or death, OR 1.4, 95% CI 1.00-1.98) and peak MOS score &#8805;4 (HFNC, NIPPV, intubation/ECMO or death, OR 1.40, 95% CI 1.01-1.94). On multivariable adjusted PPOM analysis controlling for 13 covariates, there were no longer any significant differences in peak MOS scores between users and non-users. CONCLUSIONS: After adjusting for covariates, pre-hospital antiplatelet use was not associated with COVID-19 severity in hospitalized patients.","Pan, Darren; Ip, Ada; Zhan, Serena; Wasserman, Isaac; Snyder, Daniel J; Agathis, Alexandra Z; Shamapant, Nikhil; Yang, Jeong Yun; Pai, Akila; Mazumdar, Madhu; Poor, Hooman",Heart Lung,297,16

The Optimal Steps Model (OSM) is a pedestrian locomotion model that operationalizes an individual's need for personal space. We present new parameter values for personal space in the Optimal Steps Model to simulate social distancing in the pedestrian dynamics simulator Vadere. Our approach is pragmatic. We consider two use cases: in the first we demand that a set social distance must never be violated. In the second the social distance must be kept only on average. For each use case we conduct simulation studies in a typical bottleneck scenario and measure contact times, that is, violations of the social distance rule. We derive rules of thumb for suitable parameter choices in dependency of the desired social distance. We test the rules of thumb for the social distances 1.5m and 2.0m and observe that the new parameter values indeed lead to the desired social distancing. Thus, the rules of thumb will quickly enable Vadere users to conduct their own studies without understanding the intricacies of the OSM implementation and without extensive parameter adjustment.","Mayr, Christina Maria; Koster, Gerta",,297,33

Many drugs without established efficacy are being used to treat COVID-19 patients either as an offlabel/compassionate use or as a clinical trial. Although drug repurposing is an attractive approach with reduced time and cost, there is a need to make predictions on success before the start of therapy. For the optimum use of these repurposed drugs, many factors should be considered such as drug-gene or dug-drug interactions, drug toxicity, and patient co-morbidity. There is limited data on the pharmacogenomics of these agents and this may constitute an obstacle for successful COVID-19 therapy.

Patient-reported anxiety, depression and sleep quality might have changed due to these special circumstances. Therefore, we analyzed the symptom burden of patients treated with palliative radiotherapy at our center. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective study was performed of 50 consecutive patients and the results were compared to those obtained in a previous pre-COVID study. The Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale was employed to assess the preradiotherapy symptoms. RESULTS: The highest mean scores were reported for pain in activity (3.2) and dry mouth (3.1). Regarding anxiety, sadness/depression and sleep, the corresponding scores were 1.5, 1.2 and 2.7, respectively. Compared to the previous study, no significant increases were found. Most items had numerically lower mean values, e.g. anxiety (1.5 vs. 2.7). Both study populations had comparable median age (70.5 vs. 70 years), gender distribution and proportion of patients with bone metastases. However, there were two significant imbalances, namely a lower proportion of patients with prostate cancer (12 vs. 30%, p=0.02) and breast cancer (0 vs. 12%, p=0.02). CONCLUSION: In patients who showed up for radiation treatment planning, the suspected increase in anxiety, sadness/depression and sleep disturbance was not demonstrable. It is not known whether or not patients with substantial worries chose to decline referral to palliative radiotherapy. Therefore, comprehensive large-scale studies of patterns of care are needed to fully understand the impact of COVID-19-related measures.","Nieder, Carsten; Johnsen, Silje K; Winther, Annette M",Anticancer Res,297,20

This provides a real-world opportunity to study the problems due to hidden-node scenarios between LAA and Wi-Fi. The hidden node problem has been well studied in the context of overlapping Wi-Fi APs. However, when Wi-Fi coexists with LAA, the hidden node problem is exacerbated since LAA cannot use the well-known Request-to-Send (RTS)/Clear to-Send (CTS) mechanism to resolve contentions, resulting in throughput degradation for Wi-Fi. In this paper, we describe detailed measurements and conclusions from experiments on the campus of the University of Chicago which presents a perfect hidden node scenario where Wi-Fi access points (APs) controlled by us and an LAA base-station (BS) deployed by AT&T are hidden from each other, but the clients are not. We performed careful experiments in three different regions of the coexistence area: (i) clients midway between LAA&Wi-Fi; (ii) clients close to the Wi-Fi AP; and (iii) clients close to the LAA BS. Our results show that in a situation where LAA uses an aggregate of three unlicensed channels (60 MHz bandwidth) which overlap with an 80 MHz Wi-Fi transmission, the Wi-Fi throughput at client devices suffers considerably. Overall, Wi-Fi performance is impacted by the hidden node problem more severely than LAA. In the best outdoor conditions, the throughput of LAA and Wi-Fi is reduced by 35% and 97% respectively when coexisting with each other as compared when the other system is not present. Furthermore, we conclude that when both LAA and Wi-Fi use multiple 20 MHz channels and there are multiple Wi-Fi APs coexisting with LAA on the same set of channels, the choice of Wi-Fi primary channels can have a significant impact on LAA throughput.","Sathya, Vanlin; Rochman, Muhammad Iqbal; Ghosh, Monisha",,297,16

Some who had an apparently 'mild' COVID-19 infection continue to suffer from persistent symptoms, including chest pain, breathlessness, fatigue, cognitive impairment, paraesthesia, muscle and joint pains. This has been labelled 'long COVID'. This paper reports the experiences of doctors with long COVID. METHODS: A qualitative study; interviews with doctors experiencing persistent symptoms were conducted by telephone or video call. Interviews were transcribed and analysis conducted using an inductive and thematic approach. RESULTS: Thirteen doctors participated. The following themes are reported: making sense of symptoms, feeling let down, using medical knowledge and connections, wanting to help and be helped, combining patient and professional identity. Experiencing long COVID can be transformative: many expressed hope that good would come of their experiences. Distress related to feelings of being 'let down' and the hard work of trying to access care. Participants highlighted that they felt better able to care for, and empathize with, patients with chronic conditions, particularly where symptoms are unexplained. CONCLUSIONS: The study adds to the literature on the experiences of doctors as patients, in particular where evidence is emerging and the patient has to take the lead in finding solutions to their problems and accessing their own care.

Some who had an apparently 'mild' COVID-19 infection continue to suffer from persistent symptoms, including chest pain, breathlessness, fatigue, cognitive impairment, paraesthesia, muscle and joint pains. This has been labelled 'long COVID'. This paper reports the experiences of doctors with long COVID. METHODS: A qualitative study; interviews with doctors experiencing persistent symptoms were conducted by telephone or video call. Interviews were transcribed and analysis conducted using an inductive and thematic approach. RESULTS: Thirteen doctors participated. The following themes are reported: making sense of symptoms, feeling let down, using medical knowledge and connections, wanting to help and be helped, combining patient and professional identity. Experiencing long COVID can be transformative: many expressed hope that good would come of their experiences. Distress related to feelings of being 'let down' and the hard work of trying to access care. Participants highlighted that they felt better able to care for, and empathize with, patients with chronic conditions, particularly where symptoms are unexplained. CONCLUSIONS: The study adds to the literature on the experiences of doctors as patients, in particular where evidence is emerging and the patient has to take the lead in finding solutions to their problems and accessing their own care. PATIENT AND PUBLIC CONTRIBUTION: The study was developed with experts by experience (including co-authors HA and TAB) who contributed to the protocol and ethics application, and commented on analysis and implications. All participants were given the opportunity to comment on findings.","Taylor, Anna K; Kingstone, Tom; Briggs, Tracy A; O039,; Donnell, Catherine A; Atherton, Helen; Blane, David N; Chew-Graham, Carolyn A",Health expect,297,12

A few authors have investigated scores based on the ultrasonographic interstitial syndrome for this purpose, but none have compared them with the gold standard computed tomography in children. METHODS: Children < 10 kilograms undergoing a chest computed tomography for clinical purposes at a tertiary hospital Pediatric Intensive Care Unit were enrolled in the study. An ultrasound scan was performed shortly after computed tomography. Each hemithorax was divided in 6 zones, and each zone was scored: 1 = no B lines; 2 = < 3 B lines; 3 > 3 well separated B lines; 4 = crowded, coalescent B lines; 5 = white lung; 6 = consolidation. The pediatric Lung Ultrasound Score was obtained by adding all zones. Interobserver variation for two separate operators was calculated. RESULTS: Ten children, median age 95 days (range 23 - 721), were enrolled. Mean pediatric Lung Ultrasound Score had a significant correlation with lung density (&#961; = 0.68) and percentage of hypoaerated lung (&#961; = 0.51). Median density and percentage of hypoaerated lung increased along the ultrasound patterns values (p < 0.05) although not all patterns were significantly different from adjacent ones in the pairwise comparison. Interobserver variability in scoring of ultrasonographic patterns was moderate. CONCLUSIONS: The pediatric Lung Ultrasound Score correlates with lung density and percentage of hypoaerated lung measured with computed tomography.","Fochi, Oliviero; Bronco, Alfio; Nacoti, Mirco; Signori, Davide; Gatti, Stefano; Sala, Francesco; Rozen, Thomas; Bonanomi, Ezio; Bellani, Giacomo",Minerva anestesiol,297,26

While socioeconomic background has been studied extensively, little is known about the genetic variation underlying this phenomenon. This study is aimed at examining the genetic basis behind the great discrepancies among diverse ethnic groups in terms of COVID-19 susceptibility for viral infection, disease prognosis, and mortality. To this end, in silico analysis of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within regulatory sequences of the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2)-the virus's gateway to host cells-and their plausible implications on expression levels was conducted. We provide indication that the variation in the human ACE2 and TMPRSS2 regulatory sequences is likely to be involved in and contribute to this phenomenon. SNPs that are abundant in the more susceptible populations introduce binding sites (BSs) for transcription factors or they may invalidate BSs for transcription repressor-both may enhance target gene (ACE2 or TMPRSS2) expression in the relevant target tissues. SNPs that are abundant in the more resistant populations may invalidate BSs for a transcriptional repressor or they may introduce BSs for a transcriptional repressor or initiator of mRNA degradation, which may reduce target gene expression levels. This aspect, when added to the socioeconomic factors, can be a cause for the divergent prevalence of the disease and the different mortality rates within diverse populations. This demonstration may call for a shift in the paradigm of searching for COVID-19 biomarkers, such that SNPs within regulatory sequences should be of high importance.","Barash, Ayelet; Machluf, Yossy; Ariel, Ilana; Dekel, Yaron",Front Med (Lausanne),297,10

This study provides a brief and precise review of the current knowledge regarding COVID-19 including disease transmission and clinical characteristics. This article aims to review the otolaryngologist experience treating patients in the cities where COVID 19 impact is most, and to propose appropriate protective measures while managing ENT patients. This is a retrospective study conducted in the Department of Otorhinolaryngology, Hind Institute of Medical Sciences, Ataria, Sitapur from 10 March 2020 to 4 May 2020. The most common otolaryngological symptoms of COVID-19 were cough, sore throat, and dyspnea. Rhinorrhea, nasal congestion and dizziness also seen in some of the patients. COVID-19 could also manifest as an isolated sudden hyposmia/anosmia. Upper respiratory tract (URT) symptoms were commonly observed in younger patients and usually appeared initially. They could be present even before the molecular confirmation of SARS-CoV-2. Otolaryngologists are at higher risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection as they cope with URT symptoms in OPD and while performing surgery in COVID-19 positive patients. Patients with cough, sore throat, dyspnea, hyposmia/anosmia and a history of travel to the region with confirmed COVID-19 patients, should be considered as potential COVID-19 cases. An otolaryngologist should wear FFP3/N95 mask, glasses, disposable and fluid resistant gloves and gown while examining such individuals.

The optimal selection of interventions targeting the virus is unknown. Therefore, evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to support specific treatment against COVID-19 is urgently needed. The use of Chinese herbal medicines (CHMs) might have a role in the treatment and symptomatic management of patients with COVID-19. It was aimed at providing an overview of the available evidence and ongoing trials concerning the effects of CHMs for the treatment of COVID-19. Methods: This is a narrative review of relevant studies. Searches were conducted to identify documents published till April 22, 2020. Electronic databases, evidence-based collections, websites of relevant organizations, and trial registries were consulted. Results: A total of 25 guidelines on the treatment of patients with COVID-19 were identified. Four guidelines provided recommendations on the use of CHMs; these guidelines were developed in China and South Korea and were based on the consensus of experts exclusively. The remaining 21 guidelines provided no guidance on CHMs. No finished RCTs of CHMs for the treatment of patients with COVID-19 was found. According to the evidence evaluated in this review, a Cochrane review of CHMs for severe acute respiratory syndrome and five uncontrolled observational studies of the effects of CHMs in patients with COVID-19, the effects of CHMs for COVID-19 are unknown. A total of 52 ongoing clinical trials of CHM interventions for the treatment of COVID-19 were found. These trials will be carried out mostly in China (n = 51). Forty (77%) of the ongoing trials will be randomized, whereas 12 (23%) have an unclear sequence generation procedure. Forty-seven trials (90%) will have a sample size <400 participants. Conclusions: To the authors' knowledge, only the Chinese and the South Korean guidelines recommend CHMs as a treatment option for patients with COVID-19. These guidelines base their recommendations on the consensus of experts. Clinical guidelines or health authorities from other countries do not provide advice on CHMs. Due to the absence of RCT, there is currently no reliable evidence on the effects of any specific CHM intervention for the treatment of patients with COVID-19. A high number of clinical trials of different herbal products are being currently conducted in China.","López-Alcalde, Jesús; Yan, Yuqian; Witt, Claudia M; Barth, Jürgen",J. altern. complement. med,297,21

Filtering for rare variants and altered expression in proband iPSCs prioritized 10 candidates. siRNA/RNAi-mediated knockdown in healthy human iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CM) and in developing Drosophila and zebrafish hearts revealed that LDL receptor-related protein LRP2 is required for cardiomyocyte proliferation and differentiation.

However, there is limited information on the performance of national immunization programs (NIPs) in WHO Africa countries that experience PHEs. This study assessed PHEs (armed conflicts, disasters, and disease outbreaks) and the performance of NIPs using global and regional immunization targets outlined for the Decade of Vaccines. Thirteen beneficiary countries of PHE mitigation funds from the African Public Health Emergency Fund were used as case studies. Data on PHEs and immunization indicators between 2010 and 2019 in selected countries were extracted from different PHE databases and the WHO/UNICEF immunization database, respectively. The data were stratified by country and summarized using descriptive statistics. Mann-Whitney U test was done to determine the association between the frequency of PHEs and the performance of NIPs. There were 175 disease outbreaks, 288 armed conflicts, and 318 disasters in the examined countries between 2010 and 2019. The Democratic Republic of Congo had the highest total PHE count (n = 208), while Liberia had the lowest (n = 20). Only three of the 13 countries had a median coverage value for the third dose of the combined Diphtheria, Tetanus, and Pertussis vaccine (DTP3) that had attained the target for ≥90% immunization coverage. Higher counts of armed conflict and total PHEs were associated with not meeting immunization targets for national DTP3 coverage of ≥90% and Maternal and Neonatal Tetanus elimination, p < 0.01. It was clear that in the WHO Africa region, PHEs are prevalent, irrespective of a country’s level of immunization maturity, and have the potential to derail the progress of NIPs in the absence of effective interventions. As we transition toward the Immunization Agenda 2030, we recommend that the WHO Africa region prioritizes interventions to mitigate the impacts of PHEs on NIPs.","Chepkurui, Viola; Amponsah-Dacosta, Edina; Haddison, Eposi Christiana; Kagina, Benjamin Mugo",Front Public Health,297,26

Here, an integrative analysis of available epidemiological transcriptomic data related to BCG vaccination and respiratory tract viral infections as well as of reported transcriptomic alterations in COVID-19 is presented toward addressing this gap. Results suggest that the vaccine induces very long-lasting transcriptomic changes that mimic viral infections by, consistent with the present concept of trained immunity, upregulation of antiviral defense response, and oppose viral infections by, inconsistent with the concept, downregulation of myeloid cell activation.

Therefore, reducing the viral load of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) shed via respiratory droplets is potentially an ideal strategy to prevent the spread of the pandemic. The in vitro virucidal activity of intranasal Povidone-Iodine (PVP-I) has been demonstrated recently to reduce SARS-CoV-2 viral titres. This study evaluated the virucidal activity of the aqueous solution of Iodine-V (a clathrate complex formed by elemental iodine and fulvic acid) as in Essential Iodine Drops (EID) with 200 μg elemental iodine/ml content against SARS-CoV-2 to ascertain whether it is a better alternative to PVP-I. METHODS: SARS-CoV-2 (USAWA1/2020 strain) virus stock was prepared by infecting Vero 76 cells (ATCC CRL-1587) until cytopathic effect (CPE). The virucidal activity of EID against SARS-CoV-2 was tested in three dilutions (1:1; 2:1 and 3:1) in triplicates by incubating at room temperature (22 ± 2°C) for either 60 or 90 seconds. The surviving viruses from each sample were quantified by a standard end-point dilution assay. RESULTS: EID (200 μg iodine/ml) after exposure for 60 and 90 seconds was compared to controls. In both cases, the viral titre was reduced by 99% (LRV 2.0). The 1:1 dilution of EID with virus reduced SARS-CoV-2 virus from 31,623 cell culture infectious dose 50% (CCID(50)) to 316 CCID(50) within 90 seconds. CONCLUSION: Substantial reductions in LRV by Iodine-V in EID confirmed the activity of EID against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro, demonstrating that Iodine-V in EID is effective at inactivating the virus in vitro and therefore suggesting its potential application intranasally to reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission from known or suspected COVID-19 patients.","Köntös, Zoltán",PLoS One,297,10

As people around the world through government directive or independent choice moved into protective isolation, immunosuppressed children who routinely require medical management were challenged with necessary public ventures to health care facilities. Medical centers adapted by developing new approaches to care for immunocompromised children such as expanding telemedicine services and conversion to at home immune therapies to reduce infectious exposure. Testing for SARS-CoV-2 of asymptomatic patients prior to medical therapies became routine in most modern health care units and development of highly sensitive assays was critical to avoid patient and staff exposure as well as initiation of new immunosuppressive treatment in positive patients. As the prevalence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) amplified and infected immunocompromised patients became more common, questions quickly arose including how aggressively to treat the infection with most agents still in clinical trials. Additionally how should chronic immunosuppressant drugs that may interfere with the ability to clear the virus be adjusted? Finally, what if the infection leads to excessive immune responses or flares of the underlying disorder? In this review, we explore the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on immunocompromised children during the first year, summarizing what is known and yet to be discovered, approaches to testing and treatment of SARS-CoV-2, considerations in management of underlying immune suppressive medications, outcomes published to date, and strategies for vaccinating this unique population.","Connelly, James A.; Chong, Hey; Esbenshade, Adam J.; Frame, David; Failing, Christopher; Secord, Elizabeth; Walkovich, Kelly",Pediatr Clin North Am,297,22

Twenty-two contaminated surfaces were positioned in different areas in a patient room with adjacent bathroom and anteroom. Following the decontamination process bacteria were recovered and reduction factors were calculated after performing quantitative culture. Following the manufactures instructions, the ozone-based device displayed a bactericidal effect (log(10) > 5), whereas the aHP system failed for a high bacterial burden and achieves only a complete elimination of a realistic bioburden (log(10) 2). After increasing the exposure time to 30 min, the aHP device also reached a bactericidal effect.

The spike (S) protein on the viral envelope mediates human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 binding and thus is the target of a variety of neutralizing antibodies. In this work, we built various S trimer–antibody complex structures on the basis of the fully glycosylated S protein models described in our previous work and performed all-atom molecular dynamics simulations to gain insight into the structural dynamics and interactions between S protein and antibodies. Investigation of the residues critical for S–antibody binding allows us to predict the potential influence of mutations in SARS-CoV-2 variants. Comparison of the glycan conformations between S-only and S–antibody systems reveals the roles of glycans in S–antibody binding. In addition, we explored the antibody binding modes and the influences of antibody on the motion of S protein receptor binding domains. Overall, our analyses provide a better understanding of S–antibody interactions, and the simulation-based S–antibody interaction maps could be used to predict the influences of S mutation on S–antibody interactions, which will be useful for the development of vaccine and antibody-based therapy.","Cao, Yiwei; Choi, Yeol Kyo; Frank, Martin; Woo, Hyeonuk; Park, Sang-Jun; Yeom, Min Sun; Seok, Chaok; Im, Wonpil",J Chem Theory Comput,297,24

Handwashing is a key component of guidance to reduce transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic. Prior systematic reviews have indicated the effectiveness of handwashing to reduce transmission of respiratory viruses. In low-income countries, reduction of transmission is of paramount importance but social distancing is challenged by high population densities and handwashing access is limited. ObjectivesTo estimate global access to handwashing with soap and water to inform use of handwashing in the prevention of COVID-19 transmission. MethodsWe utilized observational surveys and spatiotemporal gaussian process regression modeling in the context of the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study, to estimate access to a handwashing station with available soap and water for 1062 locations from 1990 to 2019. ResultsDespite overall improvements from 1990 (34.7% [95% uncertainty interval 32.5-36.7] without access) to 2019 globally, in 2019, 2.01 (1.89-2.13) billion people--26.0% (24.4-27.6) of the global population lacked access to handwashing. More than 50% of the population in sub-Saharan Africa were without access to handwashing in 2019, while in eight countries, more than 50 million persons lacked access. DiscussionFor populations without handwashing access, immediate improvements in access or alternative strategies are urgently needed, while disparities in handwashing access should be incorporated into COVID-19 forecasting models when applied to low-income countries.","Brauer, Michael; Zhao, Jeff T; Bennitt, Fiona B; Stanaway, Jeffrey D",,297,18

Our hospital successfully restarted elective orthopaedic surgery during the pandemic to help improve the quality of life of patients with chronic disabilities. This study describes the development of local protocols and pathways to allow for a safe restart of elective orthopaedic surgery in a COVID-19-free ‘green’ site. It includes the morbidity and mortality outcomes of those patients who underwent non-emergency orthopaedic operations during this time. Methods This is a prospective cohort study over an eight-week period evaluating 104 patients undergoing non-emergency orthopaedic procedures through a COVID-19-free surgical pathway. The primary outcome measure was 14-day postoperative mortality. The main secondary outcome measures were the development of a COVID-19 infection in the hospital and 14 days postoperatively as well as the need for intensive care unit admissions. Results No patients developed a COVID-19 infection. There were no intensive care unit admissions or postoperative deaths during our study time frame. There was no statistical difference seen for age (< 70 or > 70), gender, body mass index, or American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) grades in the development of postoperative complications. Conclusions This study describes a roadmap to setting up a protocolised elective operating service for orthopaedic surgery. It has shown that standardised protocols in a COVID-19-free ‘green’ site, preoperative COVID-19 testing, and adherence to national guidelines on self-isolation can help prevent developing COVID-19 infection postoperatively and reduce the risk of postoperative mortality.","Vusirikala, Anuhya; Saleh, Marwan; Laurent, Edward; del Castillo, Tessa; Kuzhupilly, Ranjith R; Fahmy, Amr; Tsekes, Dimitrios",Cureus,297,5

The multifaceted nature of COVID-19 demands a multidisciplinary approach, but the urgency of the crisis combined with the need for social distancing measures present unique challenges to collaborative science. We applied a massive online open publishing approach to this problem using Manubot. Through GitHub, collaborators summarized and critiqued COVID-19 literature, creating a review manuscript. Manubot automatically compiled citation information for referenced preprints, journal publications, websites, and clinical trials. Continuous integration workflows retrieved up-to-date data from online sources nightly, regenerating some of the manuscript’s figures and statistics. Manubot rendered the manuscript into PDF, HTML, LaTeX, and DOCX outputs, immediately updating the version available online upon the integration of new content. Through this effort, we organized over 50 scientists from a range of backgrounds who evaluated over 1,500 sources and developed seven literature reviews. While many efforts from the computational community have focused on mining COVID-19 literature, our project illustrates the power of open publishing to organize both technical and non-technical scientists to aggregate and disseminate information in response to an evolving crisis.","Rando, Halie M.; Boca, Simina M.; McGowan, Lucy D’Agostino; Himmelstein, Daniel S.; Robson, Michael P.; Rubinetti, Vincent; Velazquez, Ryan; Greene, Casey S.; Gitter, Anthony",ArXiv,297,16

However, these methods do not allow for the absolute quantification of virus particles, which could reduce the inter-lab variability and accelerate the virus research. Although there is a digital PCR-based method that has been used for absolute virus quantification, its reaction time (4 hours) is too long for widespread application. Here, we report a rapid digital CRISPR method developed for the absolute quantification of SARS-CoV-2 DNA and Epstein-Barr virus DNA in human samples that yields results within 1 hour. We validated this method using synthetic SARS-CoV-2 DNA and Epstein-Barr viral DNA and compared results with those obtained with digital PCR. Digital CRISPR allows absolute quantification of DNA with a dynamic range from 0.6 to 2027 copies/{micro}L (R2 value > 0.98), without cross reactivity on similar virus and human background DNA. Thus, our digital CRISPR can accurately detect and quantify nucleic acid in 1h without thermal cycling, which provides a 4-fold faster alternative to digital PCR-based virus detection.","Wu, X.; Chan, C.; Lee, Y.

However, the effects of neoviruses on infected pregnant women and especially on their fetuses and newborns are not well understood. Most up‐to‐date evidences about how SARS‐CoV‐2 affected patients especially in pregnancy were collected by conducting a comprehensive search of medical literature electronic databases. Immune‐related data of pregnant women, fetuses and newborns were further analysis. According to the limited literature, SARS‐CoV‐2 utilizes angiotensin converting enzyme 2 as its receptor and causes severe hypoxemia. Insufficiency of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 in pregnant women and the effects of hypoxia on the placental oxygen supply will cause severe perinatal complications. In addition, SARS‐CoV‐2 infection may disrupt maternal‐fetal immune tolerance and cause immunological damage to embryos. Because of these reasons, pregnancy complications such as fetal demise or premature birth, preeclampsia, intrauterine growth restriction, respiratory dyspnea, nervous system dysplasia and immune system defects are likely to occur in pregnant women with COVID‐19 or their newborns. Pregnant women infected with SARS‐CoV‐2 should be treated as a special group and given special attention. Fetuses and newborns of SARS‐CoV‐2‐infected pregnant women should be given more protection to reduce the occurrence of adverse events. In this review, we intend to provide an overview of the physiological and immunological changes that induce the pregnancy complications.

Their inhibitory properties against two important alanine aminopeptidases, of human (hAPN, CD13) and porcine (pAPN) origin, were evaluated. Enzymatic studies and comparison with literature data indicated the higher inhibitory potential of the homophenylalanine over phenylalanine derivatives towards both enzymes. Their inhibition constants were in the submicromolar range for hAPN and the micromolar range for pAPN, with 1-amino-3-(3-fluorophenyl) propylphosphonic acid (compound 15c) being one of the best low-molecular inhibitors of both enzymes. To the best of our knowledge, P1 homophenylalanine analogues are the most active inhibitors of the APN among phosphonic and phosphinic derivatives described in the literature. Therefore, they constitute interesting building blocks for the further design of chemically more complex inhibitors. Based on molecular modeling simulations and SAR (structure-activity relationship) analysis, the optimal architecture of enzyme-inhibitor complexes for hAPN and pAPN were determined.","Wanat, Weronika; Talma, Michał; Dziuk, Błażej; Kafarski, Paweł",Biomolecules,297,20

Given that naturally occurring glycolipids are composed of only one hydrophilic sugar head-group and two hydrophobic lipid tails embedded in the lipid bilayers of the cell membranes, they usually require extraneous lipids (phosphatidylcholine, cholesterol) to confer their stability. In order to obviate the necessity for these additional stabilizing ingredients, recent investigations have merged dendrimer chemistry with that of neoglycolipid syntheses. This singular approach has provided novel glycoarchitectures allowing reconsidering the necessity for the traditional one to two hydrophilic/hydrophobic ratio.

Rapidly escalated into a worldwide pandemic, it has caused an unprecedented and devastating situation on the global public health and society economy. The severity of recent coronavirus disease, abbreviated to COVID-19, seems to be mostly associated with the patients’ immune response. In this vein, mesenchymal stromal/stem cells (MSCs) have been suggested as a worth-considering option against COVID-19 as their therapeutic properties are mainly displayed in immunomodulation and anti-inflammatory effects. Indeed, administration of MSCs can attenuate cytokine storm and enhance alveolar fluid clearance, endothelial recovery, and anti-fibrotic regeneration. Despite advantages attributed to MSCs application in lung injuries, there are still several issues (__)foremost probability of malignant transformation and incidence of MSCs-related coagulopathy(__) which should be resolved for the successful application of MSC therapy in COVID-19. In the present study, we review the historical evidence of successful use of MSCs and MSC-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) in the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

Strong associations have been demonstrated by epidemiological and toxicological studies between increases in PM(2.5) concentrations and premature mortality, cardiopulmonary diseases, asthma and allergic sensitization, and lung cancer. The mechanisms of PM-induced toxicological effects are related to their size, chemical composition, lung clearance and retention, cellular oxidative stress responses and pro-inflammatory effects locally and systemically. Particles in the ultrafine range (<100 nm), although they have the highest number counts, surface area and organic chemical content, are often overlooked due to insufficient monitoring and risk assessment.
