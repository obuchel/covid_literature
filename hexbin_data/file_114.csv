223,Malignant mesothelioma,2008-12-19,"Malignant mesothelioma is a fatal asbestos-associated malignancy originating from the lining cells (mesothelium) of the pleural and peritoneal cavities, as well as the pericardium and the tunica vaginalis. The exact prevalence is unknown but it is estimated that mesotheliomas represent less than 1% of all cancers. Its incidence is increasing, with an expected peak in the next 10–20 years. Pleural malignant mesothelioma is the most common form of mesothelioma. Typical presenting features are those of chest pain and dyspnoea. Breathlessness due to a pleural effusion without chest pain is reported in about 30% of patients. A chest wall mass, weight loss, sweating, abdominal pain and ascites (due to peritoneal involvement) are less common presentations. Mesothelioma is directly attributable to occupational asbestos exposure with a history of exposure in over 90% of cases. There is also evidence that mesothelioma may result from both para-occupational exposure and non-occupational ""environmental"" exposure. Idiopathic or spontaneous mesothelioma can also occur in the absence of any exposure to asbestos, with a spontaneous rate in humans of around one per million. A combination of accurate exposure history, along with examination radiology and pathology are essential to make the diagnosis. Distinguishing malignant from benign pleural disease can be challenging. The most helpful CT findings suggesting malignant pleural disease are 1) a circumferential pleural rind, 2) nodular pleural thickening, 3) pleural thickening of > 1 cm and 4) mediastinal pleural involvement. Involvement of a multidisciplinary team is recommended to ensure prompt and appropriate management, using a framework of radiotherapy, chemotherapy, surgery and symptom palliation with end of life care. Compensation issues must also be considered. Life expectancy in malignant mesothelioma is poor, with a median survival of about one year following diagnosis.","Moore, Alastair J; Parker, Robert J; Wiggins, John",Orphanet J Rare Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2652430/,114
1723,Effects of Storage Time on Total Protein and Globulin Concentrations in Bovine Fresh Frozen Plasma Obtained for Transfusion,2015-02-12,"To evaluate the effects of storage conditions on total protein (TP) and globulin fractions in fresh frozen bovine plasma units prepared and stored for transfusion, TP and globulin fractions were evaluated in fresh plasma and at 1 month and 6 and 12 months after blood collection in plasma stored at −20°C. Significant differences in concentrations were found in the median concentration of total protein (P = 0.0336), between 0 months and 1 month (P = 0.0108), 0 and 6 months (P = 0.0023), and 0 and 12 months (P = 0.0027), in mean concentration (g/dL) of albumin (P = 0.0394), between 0 months and 1 month (P = 0.0131), 0 and 6 months (P = 0.0035), and 0 and 12 months (P = 0.0038), and beta-2 fraction (P = 0.0401), between 0 and 6 months (P = 0.0401) and 0 and 12 months (P = 0.0230). This study suggests that total gamma globulin concentration in bovine frozen plasma is stable for 12 months at −20°C. Total protein, ALB, and beta-2 fraction have significantly different concentrations (g/dL) when compared to prestorage. This study has shown IgG protein fraction stability in bovine fresh frozen plasma collected for transfusion; therefore, bovine fresh frozen plasma seems to be suitable for the treatment of hypogammaglobulinemia (failure of passive transfer) in calves when stored for 12 months at −20°C.","Proverbio, D.; Spada, E.; Baggiani, L.; Bagnagatti De Giorgi, G.; Roggero, N.; Belloli, A.; Pravettoni, D.; Perego, R.",ScientificWorldJournal,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4342078/,114
3766,Performance and workflow assessment of six nucleic acid extraction technologies for use in resource limited settings,2019-04-18,"Infectious disease nucleic acid amplification technologies (NAAT) have superior sensitivity, specificity, and rapid time to result compared to traditional microbiological methods. Recovery of concentrated, high quality pathogen nucleic acid (NA) from complex specimen matrices is required for optimal performance of several NA amplification/detection technologies such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Fully integrated NAAT platforms that enable rapid sample-to-result workflows with minimal user input are generally restricted to larger reference lab settings, and their complexity and cost are prohibitive to widespread implementation in resource limited settings (RLS). Identification of component technologies for incorporation of reliable and affordable sample preparation with pathogen NA amplification/detection into an integrated platform suitable for RLS, is a necessary first step toward achieving the overarching goal of reducing infectious disease-associated morbidity and mortality globally. In the current study, we evaluate the performance of six novel NA extraction technologies from different developers using blinded panels of stool, sputum and blood spiked with variable amounts of quality-controlled DNA- and/or RNA-based microbes. The extraction efficiencies were semi-quantitatively assessed using validated real-time reverse transcription (RT)-PCR assays specific for each microbe and comparing target-specific RT-PCR results to those obtained with reference NA extraction methods. The technologies were ranked based on overall diagnostic accuracy (analytical sensitivity and specificity). Sample input and output volumes, total processing time, user-required manual steps and cost estimates were also examined for suitability in RLS. Together with the performance analysis, these metrics were used to select the more suitable candidate technologies for further optimization of integrated NA amplification and detection technologies for RLS.","Beall, Shivani G.; Cantera, Jason; Diaz, Maureen H.; Winchell, Jonas M.; Lillis, Lorraine; White, Heather; Kalnoky, Michael; Gallarda, James; Boyle, David S.",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6472818/,114
3990,A Systematic Review of Social Contact Surveys to Inform Transmission Models of Close-contact Infections,2019-07-30,"BACKGROUND: Researchers increasingly use social contact data to inform models for infectious disease spread with the aim of guiding effective policies about disease prevention and control. In this article, we undertake a systematic review of the study design, statistical analyses, and outcomes of the many social contact surveys that have been published. METHODS: We systematically searched PubMed and Web of Science for articles regarding social contact surveys. We followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines as closely as possible. RESULTS: In total, we identified 64 social contact surveys, with more than 80% of the surveys conducted in high-income countries. Study settings included general population (58%), schools or universities (37%), and health care/conference/research institutes (5%). The largest number of studies did not focus on a specific age group (38%), whereas others focused on adults (32%) or children (19%). Retrospective (45%) and prospective (41%) designs were used most often with 6% using both for comparison purposes. The definition of a contact varied among surveys, e.g., a nonphysical contact may require conversation, close proximity, or both. We identified age, time schedule (e.g., weekday/weekend), and household size as relevant determinants of contact patterns across a large number of studies. CONCLUSIONS: We found that the overall features of the contact patterns were remarkably robust across several countries, and irrespective of the study details. By considering the most common approach in each aspect of design (e.g., sampling schemes, data collection, definition of contact), we could identify recommendations for future contact data surveys that may be used to facilitate comparison between studies.","Hoang, Thang; Coletti, Pietro; Melegaro, Alessia; Wallinga, Jacco; Grijalva, Carlos G.; Edmunds, John W.; Beutels, Philippe; Hens, Niel",Epidemiology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6684224/,114

6352,Perioperative haemotherapy: II. Risks and complications of blood transfusion,1992,"Challenges arising from epidemic infectious disease outbreaks can be more effectively met if traditional public health is enhanced by sociology. The focus is normally on biomedical aspects, the surveillance and sentinel systems for infectious diseases, and what needs to be done to bring outbreaks under control quickly. Social factors associated with infectious disease outbreaks are often neglected and the aftermath is ignored. These factors can affect outbreak severity, its rate and extent of spread, influencing the welfare of victims, their families, and their communities. We propose an agenda for research to meet the challenges of infectious disease outbreaks. What social factors led to the outbreak? What social factors affected its severity and rate and extent of spread? How did individuals, social groups, and the state react to it? What are the short- and long-term effects on individuals, social groups, and the larger society? What programs can be put in place to help victims, their families, and affected communities to cope with the consequences – impaired mental and physical health, economic losses, and disrupted communities? Although current research on infectious disease outbreaks pays attention to social factors related to causation, severity, rate and extent of spread, those dealing with the “social chaos” arising from outbreaks are usually neglected. Inclusion, by combining traditional public health with sociological analysis, will enrich public health theory and understanding of infectious disease outbreaks. Our approach will help develop better programs to combat outbreaks and equally important, to help survivors, their families, and their communities cope better with the aftermath.","Phua, Kai-Lit; Lee, Lai Kah",J Public Health Policy,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7100141/,114
6552,Influence of hilar deposition in the evaluation of the alveolar epithelial permeability on (99m)Tc-DTPA aerosol inhaled scintigraphy,2009-02-08,"Steroid-resistant acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) of the gastrointestinal tract associates with important morbidity and mortality. While high-dose steroids are the established first-line therapy in GVHD, no second-line therapy is generally accepted. In this analysis of 65 consecutive patients with severe, steroid-resistant, intestinal GVHD (92% stage 4), additional ileostomy surgery significantly reduced overall mortality (hazard ratio 0.54; 95% confidence interval, 0.36–0.81; p = 0.003) compared to conventional GVHD therapy. Median overall survival was 16 months in the ileostomy cohort compared to 4 months in the conventional therapy cohort. In the ileostomy cohort, both infectious- and GVHD-associated mortality were reduced (40% versus 77%). Significantly declined fecal volumes (p = 0.001) after surgery provide evidence of intestinal adaptation following ileostomy. Correlative studies indicated ileostomy-induced immune-modulation with a > 50% decrease of activated T cells (p = 0.04) and an increase in regulatory T cells. The observed alterations of the patients’ gut microbiota may also contribute to ileostomy’s therapeutic effect. These data show that ileostomy induced significant clinical responses in patients with steroid-resistant GVHD along with a reduction of pro-inflammatory immune cells and changes of the intestinal microbiota. Ileostomy is a treatment option for steroid-resistant acute GVHD of the gastrointestinal tract that needs further validation in a prospective clinical trial.

6603,Anemia and Transfusions in Patients Undergoing Surgery for Cancer,2007-10-18,"Background: The purpose of this article is to describe our experience using laparoscopy in the management of emergent and acute abdominal conditions. Methods: Between March 1997 and November 2001, 277 consecutive minimally invasive procedures were performed for various nontrauma surgical emergencies. The indications for operation were nonspecific abdominal pain in 129 cases (46%), peritonitis in 64 cases (23%), small bowel obstruction in 52 cases (19%), complications after previous surgery or invasive procedures in 24 cases (9%), and sepsis of unknown origin in 8 cases (3%). Results: Laparoscopy obtained a correct diagnosis in 98.6% of the cases. In 207 patients (75%), the procedure was completed laparoscopically. An additional 35 patients (12.5%) required a target incision. The remaining 35 patients (12.5%) underwent formal laparotomy. The morbidity rate was 5.8%. No laparoscopy-related mortality was observed. Conclusions: For patients with abdominal emergencies, the laparoscopic approach provides diagnostic accuracy and therapeutic options, avoids extensive preoperative studies, averts delays in operative intervention, and appears to reduce morbidity.","Kirshtein, B.; Roy-Shapira, A.; Lantsberg, L.; Mandel, S.; Avinoach, E.; Mizrahi, S.",Surg Endosc,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7101823/,114
6760,What’s new in surfactant?: A clinical view on recent developments in neonatology and paediatrics,2007-05-22,"The detection of specific antibodies against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) was tested by dot blot enzyme immunoassay in 95 urine samples from 72 individuals infected with HIV and 23 seronegative individuals. Western blot of paired serum samples from these same individuals was used as the gold standard. The dot blot tested had a sensitivity of 97.2% and a specificity of 100%; only two samples from HIV-infected individuals at Centers for Disease Control (CDC) stages II and IV were non-reactive. Reactive and discrepant samples (serum/urine) were confirmed by Western blot, which had a sensitivity of 98.6% and a specificity of 100%. The most commonly observed Western blot reactivity pattern in urine samples included bands against three groups of HIV structural proteins (ENV, POL, and GAG). The results indicate that urine can be used in screening for HIV antibodies in epidemiological studies of high-prevalence populations, though it is not recommended for individualized diagnostic purposes.","Martínez, P.; de Lejarazu, R.

Although the unique DNA-demethylating capacity of decitabine is known for a long time, its application is under continuing investigation. The use of decitabine in MDS, AML, CML, stem cell transplant, sickle cell anemia and thalassemia looks promising. The epigenetic dose seems lower than the cytotoxic dose. Whereas most drugs have matured after 40 years, decitabine is only at the beginning of a new development phase in epigenesis.","de Vos, Dick; van Overveld, Wendy",Ann Hematol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7103145/,114
6990,ECR 2000 Book of Abstracts - Pt. 3 - Author’s Index,2015-08-31,"In vitro assembly of alphavirus nucleocapsid cores, called core-like particles (CLPs), requires a polyanionic cargo. There are no sequence or structure requirements to encapsidate single-stranded nucleic acid cargo. In this work, we wanted to determine how the length of the cargo impacts the stability and structure of the assembled CLPs. We hypothesized that cargo neutralizes the basic region of the alphavirus capsid protein and if the cargo is long enough, it will also act to scaffold the CP monomers together. Experimentally we found that CLPs encapsidating short 27mer oligonucleotides were less stable than CLPs encapsidating 48mer or 90mer oligonucleotides under different chemical and thermal conditions. Furthermore, cryo-EM studies showed there were structural differences between CLPs assembled with 27mer and 48mer cargo. To mimic the role of the cargo in CLP assembly we made a mutant (4D) where we substituted a cluster of four Lys residues in the CP with four Asp residues. We found that these few amino acid substitutions were enough to initiate CLP assembly in the absence of cargo. The cargo-free 4D CLPs show higher resistance to ionic strength and increased temperature compared to wild-type cargo containing CLPs suggesting their CLP assembly mechanism might also be different.","Rayaprolu, Vamseedhar; Moore, Alan; Wang, Joseph Che-Yen; Goh, Boon Chong; Perilla, Juan R; Zlotnick, Adam; Mukhopadhyay, Suchetana",J Phys Condens Matter,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7103146/,114

7434,Prophylaxis and treatment of rhinovirus colds with zinc gluconate lozenges,1987-12-11,"The synthesis of heterologous proteins in lactobacilli is strongly influenced by the promoter selected for the expression. In addition, the activity of the promoters themselves may vary among different bacterial hosts. Three different promoters were investigated for their capability to drive enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) expression in Lactococcus lactis spp. cremoris MG1363, in Lactobacillus reuteri DSM 20016(T) and in five L. reuteri strains isolated from chicken crops. The promoters of the Lactobacillus acidophilus surface layer protein gene (slp), L. acidophilus lactate dehydrogenase gene (ldhL) and enterococcal rRNA adenine N-6-methyltransferase gene (ermB) were fused to the coding sequence of EGFP and inserted into the backbone of the pTRKH3 shuttle vector (pTRKH3-slpGFP, pTRKH3-ldhGFP, pTRKH3-ermGFP). Besides conventional analytical methods, a new quick fluorimetric approach was set up to quantify the EGFP fluorescence in transformed clones using the Qubit(™) fluorometer. ermB proved to be the most effective promoter in L. reuteri isolates, producing 3.90 × 10(−7) g of fluorescent EGFP (mL OD(stationary culture))(−1). Under the same conditions, the ldhL promoter produced 2.66 × 10(−7) g of fluorescent EGFP (mL OD(stationary culture))(−1). Even though the slp promoter was efficient in L. lactis spp. cremoris MG1363, it was nearly inactive both in L. reuteri DSM 20016(T) and in L. reuteri isolates.","Lizier, Michela; Sarra, Pier G.; Cauda, Roberto; Lucchini, Franco",FEMS Microbiol Lett,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7110086/,114

8746,Pneumonia in pediatric outpatients: Cause and clinical manifestations,2006-09-27,"This chapter focuses strictly on the HLA MHC class II genes and molecules with regard to how they contribute to better delineation of the genetic associations and how the current knowledge of their structure, expression, and functions can be used to speculate on their role in the pathogenesis of disease. Because of the strong linkage disequilibrium between loci and alleles, the chapter restricts the description of the genetic associations to only the most recent data, mainly generated by molecular means, and because they supercede in precision and accuracy the previous data obtained by serological methods. Because the HLA system displays the unusual feature of strong linkage disequilibrium between loci and alleles, the genetic traits found to be associated with disease do not emerge at random. The pattern of genetic associations follow an almost constant trend. The associations gain strength each time an additional locus centromeric to the precedent is individualized. The advances made in this respect almost parallel the introduction of progressively more refined typing procedures, which allow the division of former genetic entities (loci and alleles) into additional subtypes. Among the HLA-associated diseases, or at least for those diseases in which an autoimmune process is suspected to be directly relevant to the pathogenesis, the associations are with genes and molecules of the HLA-D region (HLA class II genes and products). The most recent data assigns the disease susceptibility to common amino acid sequences present on an HLA class II molecule within its “active” site.","Charron, Dominique",Adv Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7131746/,114

The central role of the blood and lymphatic vasculatures and specifically their endothelial lining in many facets of the immune response is reviewed. Evidence is presented that both alcohol and HIV (as well as other coinfecting viruses in AIDS) target and alter endothelial cells and the angiogenic process. These concepts are further illustrated by a serendipitous viral epidemic among rats on continuous long-term alcoholic and control nonalcoholic diets, where synergism between alcohol and virus appeared to underlie multiple vascular proliferative lesions in the liver. In AIDS and alcoholism/alcoholic liver disease (ALD), the prominent features of dysregulated angiogenesis point to the endothelium as a key player in pathogenesis of these seemingly disparate disorders and potentially in immunomodulation.","Witte, M.H.; Borgs, P.; Way, D.L.; Ramirez, G.; Witte, C.L.; Bernas, M.J.",Alcohol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7135223/,114

11130,Hypersensitivity reactions to biologics (part I): allergy as an important differential diagnosis in complex immune-derived adverse events,2020-05-12,"Influenza affects approximately 1 billion individuals each year resulting in between 290,000 and 650,000 deaths. Young children and immunocompromised individuals are at a particularly high risk of severe illness attributable to influenza and these are also the groups of individuals in which reduced susceptibility to neuraminidase inhibitors is most frequently seen. High levels of resistance emerged with previous adamantane therapy for influenza A and despite no longer being used to treat influenza and therefore lack of selection pressure, high levels of adamantane resistance continue to persist in currently circulating influenza A strains. Resistance to neuraminidase inhibitors has remained at low levels to date and the majority of resistance is seen in influenza A H1N1 pdm09 infected immunocompromised individuals receiving oseltamivir but is also seen less frequently with influenza A H3N2 and B. Rarely, resistance is also seen in the immunocompetent. There is evidence to suggest that these resistant strains (particularly H1N1 pdm09) are able to maintain their replicative fitness and transmissibility, although there is no clear evidence that being infected with a resistant strain is associated with a worse clinical outcome. Should neuraminidase inhibitor resistance become more problematic in the future, there are a small number of alternative novel agents within the anti-influenza armoury with different mechanisms of action to neuraminidase inhibitors and therefore potentially effective against neuraminidase inhibitor resistant strains. Limited data from use of novel agents such as baloxavir marboxil and favipiravir, does however show that resistance variants can also emerge in the presence of these drugs.","Lampejo, Temi",Eur J Clin Microbiol Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7223162/,114

In this communication, we describe that the antibodies raised against purified dextransucrase effectively inhibited the growth of S. mutans. The purified enzyme showed 58-fold enrichment, 17.5% yield and a specific activity of 3.96 units/mg protein. Purified IgG fraction of the antibody showed significant affinity with the antigenic protein. Immunotritation of the enzyme with dextransucrase antibody showed a gradual increase in inhibition of dextransucrase activity. The growth of S. mutans was also inhibited by 85% in the presence of 28 μg of IgG fraction of the antibody. Antibodies also impaired glucosyltransferase activity (72.8%) and biofilm formation by 92.6% in S. mutans. Western blot analysis revealed no cross reactivity with the various tissues of mice, rat, rabbit and humans. Dot blot analysis showed little reactivity with Lactobacillus acidophilus and Staphylococcus aureus and there was no reactivity with other bacterial strains like Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium. These findings suggest that antibody raised against dextransucrase exhibit inhibitory effects on the growth of S. mutans and biofilm formation with no reactivity with various mammalian tissues, thus it could be an effective anticariogenic agent.","Rather, Shabeer Ahmad; Sharma, Sukesh Chander; Mahmood, Akhtar",Appl Microbiol Biotechnol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7223241/,114

Brucella spp., which is an intracellular facultative and stealthy pathogen, is able to evade the bactericidal activities of professional phagocytes. Several studies have demonstrated that Brucella can survive and replicate intracellularly, thereby provoking impaired maturation of DCs. Therefore, the interaction between DCs and Brucella becomes an interesting model to study the immune response. In this review, we first will describe the most common techniques for DCs differentiation in vitro as well as general features of brucellosis. Then, the interaction of DCs and Brucella, including pathogen recognition, molecular mechanisms of bacterial pathogenesis, and intracellular trafficking of Brucella to subvert innate response, will be reviewed.

Burn injuries, particularly severe burns, are accompanied by an immune and inflammatory response, metabolic changes and distributive shock that can be challenging to manage and can lead to multiple organ failure. Of great importance is that the injury affects not only the physical health, but also the mental health and quality of life of the patient. Accordingly, patients with burn injury cannot be considered recovered when the wounds have healed; instead, burn injury leads to long-term profound alterations that must be addressed to optimize quality of life. Burn care providers are, therefore, faced with a plethora of challenges including acute and critical care management, long-term care and rehabilitation. The aim of this Primer is not only to give an overview and update about burn care, but also to raise awareness of the ongoing challenges and stigmata associated with burn injuries.","Jeschke, Marc G.; van Baar, Margriet E.; Choudhry, Mashkoor A.; Chung, Kevin K.; Gibran, Nicole S.; Logsetty, Sarvesh",Nat Rev Dis Primers,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7224101/,114
11973,Human Parvoviruses May Affect the Development and Clinical Course of Meningitis and Meningoencephalitis,2020-06-03,"Classical swine fever (CSF) caused by the CSF virus (CSFV) is one of the most important swine diseases, resulting in huge economic losses to the pig industry worldwide. Systematic vaccination is one of the most effective strategies for the prevention and control of this disease. Two main CSFV vaccines, the modified live vaccine (MLV) and the subunit E2 vaccine, are recommended. In Taiwan, CSF cases have not been reported since 2006, although systemic vaccination has been practiced for 70 years. Here, we examined the sero-dynamics of the piglets born from sows that received either the CSFV MLV or the E2 vaccine and investigated in the field the correlation between the porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) loads and levels of CSFV antibody. A total of 1398 serum samples from 42 PRRSV-positive farms were evaluated to determine the PRRSV loads by real-time PCR and to detect CSFV antibody levels by commercial ELISA. Upon comparing the two sow vaccination protocols (CSFV MLV vaccination at 4 weeks post-farrowing versus E2 vaccination at 4–5 weeks pre-farrowing), the lowest levels of CSFV antibody were found in piglets at 5–8 and 9–12 weeks of age for the MLV and E2 groups, respectively. Meanwhile, the appropriate time window for CSFV vaccination of offspring was at 5–8 and 9–12 weeks of age in the MLV and E2 groups, respectively. There was a very highly significant negative correlation between the PRRSV load and the level of CSFV antibody in the CSFV MLV vaccination group (P < 0.0001). The PRRSV detection rate in the pigs from the MLV group (27.78%) was significantly higher than that in pigs from the E2 group (21.32%) (P = 0.011). In addition, there was a significant difference (P = 0.019) in the PRRSV detection rate at 5–8 weeks of age between the MLV (42.15%) and E2 groups (29.79%). Our findings indicate that the vaccination of CSFV MLV in piglets during the PRRSV susceptibility period at 5–8 weeks of age may be overloading the piglet’s immune system and should be a critical concern for industrial pork production in the field.","Li, Yi-Chia; Chiou, Ming-Tang; Lin, Chao-Nan",Pathogens,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7350299/,114

13539,Clinical Impact of Small Bowel Capsule Endoscopy in Obscure Gastrointestinal Bleeding,2020-10-19,"Treatment in hospitals differs from treatment in rehabilitation centers from a legal perspective because German law mandates that in hospitals physicians and other qualified personnel must be on duty at all times. This is not required for inpatient rehabilitation centers. Since this Act was passed more than 30 years ago, more acute medical interventions are now carried out and the number of older people in the population has increased. As a result patients are nowadays older, more multimorbid and therefore have a greater risk for medical complications. This is especially true for postacute neurological care. For this reason, the original legal framework for neurological rehabilitation treatment has become questionable. Therefore, we prospectively tested how often patients in inpatient neurorehabilitation suffer from complications that require immediate attention by qualified personnel. In 759 patients observed over a period of 6 months we found 602 complications requiring immediate interventions by physicians (e.g. falls, urinary tract infections, other forms of fever, diarrhea associated with Clostridium difficile, pneumonia, respiratory insufficiency, sepsis, epileptic seizures and arrhythmia). On average at least three acute care interventions occurred per day at the facility examined.

A large number of these enzymes are important virulence factors of pathogenic bacteria and therefore potential drug targets. Whereas some enzymes have potential for biotechnological applications, the M4 family of metalloproteases is known almost exclusively from bacteria. The aim of the study was to identify the structure and properties of M4 metalloprotease proteins. RESULTS: A total of 31 protein sequences of M4 metalloprotease retrieved from UniProt representing different species of bacteria have been characterized for various physiochemical properties. They were thermostable, hydrophillic protein of a molecular mass ranging from 38 to 66 KDa. Correlation on the basis of both enzymes and respective genes has also been studied by phylogenetic tree. B. cereus M4 metalloprotease (PDB ID: 1NPC) was selected as a representative species for secondary and tertiary structures among the M4 metalloprotease proteins. The secondary structure displaying 11 helices (H1-H11) is involved in 15 helix-helix interactions, while 4 β-sheet motifs composed of 15 β-strands in PDBsum. Possible disulfide bridges were absent in most of the cases. The tertiary structure of B. cereus M4 metalloprotease was validated by QMEAN4 and SAVES server (Ramachandran plot, verify 3D, and ERRAT) which proved the stability, reliability, and consistency of the tertiary structure of the protein. Functional analysis was done in terms of membrane protein topology, disease-causing region prediction, proteolytic cleavage sites prediction, and network generation. Transmembrane helix prediction showed absence of transmembrane helix in protein. Protein-protein interaction networks demonstrated that bacillolysin of B. cereus interacted with ten other proteins in a high confidence score. Five disorder regions were identified. Active sites analysis showed the zinc-binding residues—His-143, His-147, and Glu-167, with Glu-144 acting as the catalytic residues. CONCLUSION: Moreover, this theoretical overview will help researchers to get a details idea about the protein structure and it may also help to design enzymes with desirable characteristics for exploiting them at industrial level or potential drug targets.

Open‐heart surgery is a form of acute stress that decreases circulating 25(OH)D concentrations and exacerbates the preponderance of low vitamin D in a patient population already characterized by low levels. Although supplemental vitamin D increases 25(OH)D, it is unknown if supplemental vitamin D can overcome the decreases in circulating 25(OH)D induced by open‐heart surgery. We sought to identify if supplemental vitamin D protects against the acute decrease in plasma 25(OH)D propagated by open‐heart surgery during perioperative care. Participants undergoing open‐heart surgery were randomly assigned (double‐blind) to one of two groups: (a) vitamin D (n = 75; cholecalciferol, 50,000 IU/dose) or (b) placebo (n = 75). Participants received supplements on three separate occasions: orally the evening before surgery and either orally or per nasogastric tube on postoperative days 1 and 2. Plasma 25(OH)D concentrations were measured at baseline (the day before surgery and before the first supplement bolus), after surgery on postoperative days 1, 2, 3, and 4, at hospital discharge (5–8 days after surgery), and at an elective outpatient follow‐up visit at 6 months. Supplemental vitamin D abolished the acute decrease in 25(OH)D induced by open‐heart surgery during postoperative care. Moreover, plasma 25(OH)D gradually increased from baseline to day 3 and remained significantly increased thereafter but plateaued to discharge with supplemental vitamin D. We conclude that perioperative vitamin D supplementation protects against the immediate decrease in plasma 25(OH)D induced by open‐heart surgery.

METHODS: The purpose of this microbiological study was data analysis of device associated- healthcare associated infections (DA-HAIs) in an ICU in terms of the incidents of P.aeruginosa strain infections and its susceptibility within an 8.5-year observation. RESULTS: Among 919 isolated strains responsible for 799 DA-HAIs (17,62 ± 1,98/1000 patient-days) in 4010 ICU patients P.aeruginosa was the pathogen in 108/799 (13.52%) cases. Incidence rate (density) of: VAP/1000 MV- days, UTI /1000 UC- days and CLA-BSI/1000 CL- days were 11,15 ± 2.5, 6.82 ± 0.81, 2.35 ± 1.54.respectivelly. P.aeruginosa was the pathogen most frequently responsible for VAP 69/108 (63.88%). Mean frequency of VAP, UTI and CLA-BSI with P.aeruginosa etiology was 69/493 (14.28%), 32/299 (11.1%) and 7/127 (5.77%) respectively. The mean density of P.aeruginosa infection amounted to 2.43/1000 patient-days. The decrease was observed in the total number of DA-HAIs caused by the P.aeruginosa from 15.75% and 3.23/1000 patient-days in 2011 to 5.0% and 1.17/1000 in 2016 (p = 0.0104, p = 0.0348). Starting from 2016 to 2019 incidence and density of P.aeruginosa DA-HAIs increased to 12.33% and 2.63/1000 (p = 0.1388, p = 0.0818). P.aeruginosa was susceptible to ceftazidime, cefepime, amikacin, meropenem, ciprofloxacin, colistin, in 55.55, 58.33, 70.37, 53.73, 50, and 100% respectively. MDR characterised it in 40% in 2011 and 66.7% in 2019, (p = 0.177). CONCLUSIONS: The study revealed a changeable prevalence of P. aeruginosa strain infections; however their frequency was never highest in our ICU patients as it presented in the last years in Europe. The study showed a significant decrease in 2016 and increase in 2019, a nearly 3-fold increase of P.aeruginosa infections among Gram-negative strain infections, and a 2-fold increase of the P.aeruginosa DA-HAIs frequency between 2016 and 2019 as well as an increased resistance. Microbiological analysis of DA-HAIs in each hospital should be a standard method used in hospital infection control and antibiotic policy. In the case of P.aeruginosa, in order to minimize transmission, preventive infection methods should be assessed mainly in case of VAP.","Litwin, Agnieszka; Rojek, Stanislaw; Gozdzik, Waldemar; Duszynska, Wieslawa",BMC Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7885137/,114

16916,Neuropathic Pain in the Elderly,2021-03-30,"Manipulating fungal genomes is an important tool to understand the function of target genes, pathobiology of fungal infections, virulence potential, and pathogenicity of medically important fungi, and to develop novel diagnostics and therapeutic targets. Here, we provide an overview of recent advances in genetic manipulation techniques used in the field of medical mycology. Fungi use several strategies to cope with stress and adapt themselves against environmental effectors. For instance, mutations in the 14 alpha-demethylase gene may result in azole resistance in Aspergillus fumigatus strains and shield them against fungicide’s effects. Over the past few decades, several genome editing methods have been introduced for genetic manipulations in pathogenic fungi. Application of restriction enzymes to target and cut a double-stranded DNA in a pre-defined sequence was the first technique used for cloning in Aspergillus and Candida. Genome editing technologies, including zinc-finger nucleases (ZFNs) and transcriptional activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs), have been also used to engineer a double-stranded DNA molecule. As a result, TALENs were considered more practical to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms. Recently, Class 2 type II Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeat (CRISPR)/Cas9 technology has emerged as a more useful tool for genome manipulation in fungal research.","Nargesi, Sanaz; Kaboli, Saeed; Thekkiniath, Jose; Heidari, Somayeh; Keramati, Fatemeh; Seyedmousavi, Seyedmojtaba; Hedayati, Mohammad Taghi",J Fungi (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8067129/,114

In this work, we evaluated the responses of splenic and blood cDCs, with DEC205(+)CADM1(+)CD172a(+/−) phenotype, as well as those of CD163(+) cells against PRRSV and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV). Both populations were incubated in the presence of PRRSV or PEDV with and without naïve CD3(+) T cells, and cytokine responses were evaluated by qPCR and ELISA. Our results showed that cDCs, but not CD163(+) cells, produced IL-12 in response to PRRSV. PEDV did not induce IL-12 production. Cocultures of cDCs and autologous naïve CD3(+) cells resulted in decreased IL-12 production and low expression of IFN-γ transcripts in response to PRRSV. Interestingly, cDCs increased the proliferation of naïve T cells in the presence of PRRSV compared with that achieved with monocytes and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Cocultures of CD163(+) cells induced IL-10 and IL-4 expression in the presence of PRRSV and PEDV, respectively. In conclusion, cDCs can selectively produce IL-12 in response to PRRSV but poorly participate in the activation of naïve T cells.","Parra-Sánchez, Héctor; Bustamante-Córdova, Lorena; Reséndiz, Mónica; Mata-Haro, Verónica; Pinelli-Saavedra, Araceli; Hernández, Jesús",Viruses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6893809/,114
16964,Drift and termination of spiral waves in optogenetically modified cardiac tissue at sub-threshold illumination,2021-01-27,"BACKGROUND: Pregnancy is a state characterized by physiological, hematological, and immunological changes. However, the reference intervals (RI) being used in clinical practice in Ethiopia are derived from non-local general populations. Therefore; this study was aimed to determine the reference interval of hematological and immunological profiles among healthy pregnant mothers attending Hawassa University Hospital. METHODS: A cross-sectional study in a total of 360 healthy pregnant women was enrolled from January to April 2019, at Hawassa University hospital. Sociodemographic and obstetric data were collected using a structured questionnaire. Blood samples collected from each participant were used to define the hematological parameters. The median and 95% intervals were calculated for the immunological and hematological profiles. P-value 0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULT: A total of 360 healthy pregnant women were enrolled in this study. The age range of the participants was 18–45 years. 342(95%) were married and 270 (75%) of the participants were multigravida. The overall median CD4+ T-cell and total WBC counts (cells/mm3) were 602 and 7.58 respectively. The overall median value for lymphocytes, neutrophils, monocytes, eosinophils, and basophil count was (cells/mm3) was 2.21, 6.74, .63, .53, and 0.09 respectively. Whereas the median RBC and platelet count was 4.48×10(6)/μLand 212×10(6)/μL. The median value of hematological profiles in the first, second, and third trimesters was TWBC (10(3)/μL) (7.90, 8.30, 8.65), RBC (10(6)/μL) (4.5, 4.6, 4.62), and PLT (10(3)/μL) (210, 209,161) respectively. The CD4 T cell count median value was (600, 598, and 591) in the first, second, and third trimesters. Significant changes were observed in hematological and immunological parameters between trimesters (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Significant changes were observed in hematological and immunological parameters between trimesters (P < 0.05). Considerable differences were also seen between the values in this study and other studies from Ethiopia and other countries, indicated the need for the development of local reference intervals for pregnant women.","Gebere, Yidnekachew Fiseha; Bimerew, Lealem Gedefaw; Malko, Wondimagegn Adissu; Fenta, Demissie Assegu",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8031454/,114

17188,"Survival analysis of patients with tuberculosis and risk factors for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in Monrovia, Liberia",2021-04-23,"BACKGROUND: Digital mental health interventions (DMHIs), which deliver mental health support via technologies such as mobile apps, can increase access to mental health support, and many studies have demonstrated their effectiveness in improving symptoms. However, user engagement varies, with regard to a user’s uptake and sustained interactions with these interventions. OBJECTIVE: This systematic review aims to identify common barriers and facilitators that influence user engagement with DMHIs. METHODS: A systematic search was conducted in the SCOPUS, PubMed, PsycINFO, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library databases. Empirical studies that report qualitative and/or quantitative data were included. RESULTS: A total of 208 articles met the inclusion criteria. The included articles used a variety of methodologies, including interviews, surveys, focus groups, workshops, field studies, and analysis of user reviews. Factors extracted for coding were related to the end user, the program or content offered by the intervention, and the technology and implementation environment. Common barriers included severe mental health issues that hampered engagement, technical issues, and a lack of personalization. Common facilitators were social connectedness facilitated by the intervention, increased insight into health, and a feeling of being in control of one’s own health. CONCLUSIONS: Although previous research suggests that DMHIs can be useful in supporting mental health, contextual factors are important determinants of whether users actually engage with these interventions. The factors identified in this review can provide guidance when evaluating DMHIs to help explain and understand user engagement and can inform the design and development of new digital interventions.","Borghouts, Judith; Eikey, Elizabeth; Mark, Gloria; De Leon, Cinthia; Schueller, Stephen M; Schneider, Margaret; Stadnick, Nicole; Zheng, Kai; Mukamel, Dana; Sorkin, Dara H",J Med Internet Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8074985/,114
17361,Patterns of grey and white matter changes differ between bulbar and limb onset amyotrophic lateral sclerosis,2021-04-15,"Dengue (DEN) is the most prevalent arbovirus among humans, and four billion people live at risk of infection. The clinical manifestations of DEN are variable, and the disease may present subclinically or asymptomatically. A quarter of patients develop classical dengue (CD) or severe dengue (SD), which is potentially lethal and involves vascular permeability changes, severe hemorrhage and organ damage. The involvement of the liver is a fairly common feature in DEN, and alterations range from asymptomatic elevation of transaminases to acute liver failure. Since its introduction in Brazil in 1990, two strains of Dengue virus (DENV) serotype 2 (DENV-2) have been detected: Lineage I, which is responsible for an outbreak in 1991, and Lineage II, which caused an epidemic greater than the previous one and had a different epidemiological profile. To date, studies on different strains of the same serotype/genotype and their association with disease severity are scarce. In addition, one of the greatest challenges regarding the study of DEN pathogenesis and the development of drug and vaccine therapies is the absence of an animal model that reproduces the disease as it occurs in humans. The main goals of this study were to assess BALB/c mouse susceptibility experimentally infected by two distinct DENV-2 strains and characterize possible differences in the clinical signs and alterations induced in the liver resulting from those infections. Mice infected by the two DENV-2 lineages gained less weight than uninfected mice; however, their livers were slightly heavier. Increased AST and AST levels were observed in infected mice, and the number of platelets increased in the first 72 h of infection and subsequently decreased. Mice infected with both lineages presented leukocytosis but at different times of infection. The histopathological changes induced by both lineages were similar and comparable to the changes observed in DEN fatal cases. The viral genome was detected in two liver samples. The results demonstrate the susceptibility of BALB/c mice to both DENV-2 lineages and suggest that the changes induced by those strains are similar, although for some parameters, they are manifested at different times of infection.","Jácome, Fernanda Cunha; Caldas, Gabriela Cardoso; Rasinhas, Arthur da Costa; de Almeida, Ana Luisa Teixeira; de Souza, Daniel Dias Coutinho; Paulino, Amanda Carlos; Leonardo, Raphael; Barth, Ortrud Monika; dos Santos, Flavia Barreto; Barreto-Vieira, Débora Ferreira",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8102549/,114

We obtained time course data on multiple inflammatory mediators in the blood of blunt trauma patients. Using dynamic network analyses, we inferred a novel control architecture for systemic inflammation: a three-way switch comprising the chemokines MCP-1/CCL2, MIG/CXCL9, and IP-10/CXCL10. To test this hypothesis, we created a logical model comprising this putative architecture. This model predicted key qualitative features of systemic inflammation in patient sub-groups, as well as the different patterns of hospital discharge of moderately vs. severely injured patients. Thus, a rational transition from data to data-driven models to mechanistic models suggests a novel, chemokine-based mechanism for control of acute inflammation in humans and points to the potential utility of this workflow in defining novel features in other complex diseases.","Azhar, Nabil; Namas, Rami A.; Almahmoud, Khalid; Zaaqoq, Akram; Malak, Othman A.; Barclay, Derek; Yin, Jinling; El-Dehaibi, Fayten; Abboud, Andrew; Simmons, Richard L.; Zamora, Ruben; Billiar, Timothy R.; Vodovotz, Yoram",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8102583/,114

The most potent antiviral compound proved to be a quaternary ammonium salt based on (-)-borneol, 10a. In in vitro experiments, compound 10a inhibited influenza A viruses (H1, H1pdm09, and H3 subtypes), with an IC(50) value of 2.4-16.8 µM (depending on the virus), and demonstrated low toxicity (CC(50) = 1311 µM). Mechanism-of-action studies for compound 10a revealed it to be most effective when added at the early stages of the viral life cycle. In direct haemolysis inhibition tests, compound 10a was shown to decrease the membrane-disrupting activity of influenza A virus strain A/Puerto Rico/8/34.

17506,"A phase 1 clinical trial of SP16, a first-in-class anti-inflammatory LRP1 agonist, in healthy volunteers",2021-05-06,"Within the classical eye-blink conditioning, Purkinje cells within the cerebellum are known to suppress their tonic firing rates for a well defined time period in response to the conditional stimulus after training. The temporal profile of the drop in tonic firing rate, i.e., the onset and the duration, depend upon the time interval between the onsets of the conditional and unconditional training stimuli. Direct stimulation of parallel fibers and climbing fiber by electrodes was found to be sufficient to reproduce the same characteristic drop in the firing rate of the Purkinje cell. In addition, the specific metabotropic glutamate-based receptor type 7 (mGluR(7)) was found responsible for the initiation of the response, suggesting an intrinsic mechanism within the Purkinje cell for the temporal learning. In an attempt to look for a mechanism for time-encoding memory formation within individual Purkinje cells, we propose a biochemical mechanism based on recent experimental findings. The proposed mechanism tries to answer key aspects of the “Coding problem” of Neuroscience by focusing on the Purkinje cell’s ability to encode time intervals through training. According to the proposed mechanism, the time memory is encoded within the dynamics of a set of proteins—mGluR(7), G-protein, G-protein coupled Inward Rectifier Potassium ion channel, Protein Kinase A, Protein Phosphatase 1 and other associated biomolecules—which self-organize themselves into a protein complex. The intrinsic dynamics of these protein complexes can differ and thus can encode different time durations. Based on their amount and their collective dynamics within individual synapses, the Purkinje cell is able to suppress its own tonic firing rate for a specific time interval. The time memory is encoded within the effective dynamics of the biochemical reactions and altering these dynamics means storing a different time memory. The proposed mechanism is verified by both a minimal and a more comprehensive mathematical model of the conditional response behavior of the Purkinje cell and corresponding dynamical simulations of the involved biomolecules, yielding testable experimental predictions.","Mandwal, Ayush; Orlandi, Javier G.; Simon, Christoph; Davidsen, Jörn",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8104431/,114

The teaching-learning processes may contribute toward the perpetuation of this inequality. This research analyzes a literacy event that takes place in a low-income school in Southern Spain. The new literacy studies have come to examine how power relationships and affective bonds work in such literacy practices. An ethnographic method was followed to facilitate a deeper understanding of multimodal literacy. Further, a social semiotics multimodal approach was adopted to analyze the meaning-making social process that takes place in the classroom. The participants comprised two teachers and 17 children, whose ages range from 5 to 7 years. Data were collected in the form of reports, audio recordings, video recordings, and photographs over a two-years period. The results obtained have revealed that the children have been taught writing and reading through a dominant orthodox model that fails to consider the community’s and families’ cultural capitals. They also show that the literacy process does not grant any affective quality. Neither is there an authentic dialogic space created between the school and the community. This lack of dialogue generates an inequality in the actual acquisition of comprehensive reading and writing skills at school, with instances of groups exclusion, owing to the anti-hegemonic practices of knowledge acquisition.","Guichot-Muñoz, Elena; Balbás-Ortega, María Jesús; García-Jiménez, Eduardo",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8177657/,114
18503,Genetic Counseling in Direct-to-Consumer Exome Sequencing: A Case Report,2014-10-01,"BACKGROUND: Each year, influenza affects 3 to 5 million people and causes 290,000 to 650,000 fatalities worldwide. To reduce the fatalities caused by influenza, several countries have established influenza surveillance systems to collect early warning data. However, proper and timely warnings are hindered by a 1- to 2-week delay between the actual disease outbreaks and the publication of surveillance data. To address the issue, novel methods for influenza surveillance and prediction using real-time internet data (such as search queries, microblogging, and news) have been proposed. Some of the currently popular approaches extract online data and use machine learning to predict influenza occurrences in a classification mode. However, many of these methods extract training data subjectively, and it is difficult to capture the latent characteristics of the data correctly. There is a critical need to devise new approaches that focus on extracting training data by reflecting the latent characteristics of the data. OBJECTIVE: In this paper, we propose an effective method to extract training data in a manner that reflects the hidden features and improves the performance by filtering and selecting only the keywords related to influenza before the prediction. METHODS: Although word embedding provides a distributed representation of words by encoding the hidden relationships between various tokens, we enhanced the word embeddings by selecting keywords related to the influenza outbreak and sorting the extracted keywords using the Pearson correlation coefficient in order to solely keep the tokens with high correlation with the actual influenza outbreak. The keyword extraction process was followed by a predictive model based on long short-term memory that predicts the influenza outbreak. To assess the performance of the proposed predictive model, we used and compared a variety of word embedding techniques. RESULTS: Word embedding without our proposed sorting process showed 0.8705 prediction accuracy when 50.2 keywords were selected on average. Conversely, word embedding using our proposed sorting process showed 0.8868 prediction accuracy and an improvement in prediction accuracy of 12.6%, although smaller amounts of training data were selected, with only 20.6 keywords on average. CONCLUSIONS: The sorting stage empowers the embedding process, which improves the feature extraction process because it acts as a knowledge base for the prediction component. The model outperformed other current approaches that use flat extraction before prediction.","Jang, Beakcheol; Kim, Inhwan; Kim, Jong Wook",JMIR Med Inform,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8188311/,114

The burden of CMDs amongst ART-experienced patients in sub-Saharan Africa was unknown. OBJECTIVE: We quantified the burden of CMDs and identified the associated risk factors in a large treatment cohort on ART at a high-volume facility in Lesotho. METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, we extracted data from the daily dispensing electronic system and routine clinical records of 785 adults on ART between 2011 and 2015 in Maseru, Lesotho. CMD was defined as a diagnosis of hypertension, diabetes mellitus or dyslipidaemia (singly or collectively). Descriptive statistics were used to describe the disease burden; Kaplan–Meier curves and cause-specific Cox proportional hazards models were fitted to examine the impact of the ART regimen and identify the risk factors associated with the occurrence of CMD. RESULTS: Of the 785 participants, 473 (60%) were women. The median age of the group was 42 years, interquartile range (IQR), 36–51 years. The overall incidence of CMD was 5.6 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 4.4–7.1) per 100 person-months of follow-up. The median time to onset of CMD was 16.6 months (IQR = 7.4–23.4). ART was not associated with the occurrence of CMD (cause-specific hazard ratio [CHR] = 1.55; 95% CI = 0.14–16.85; P = 0.72). Higher body mass index (BMI) was associated with the occurrence of diabetes mellitus (CHR = 1.19; 95% CI = 1.14–1.38; P = 0.026). CONCLUSION: The incidence of CMD in this relatively young patient population is low yet noteworthy. We recommend that patients living with HIV and AIDS should be routinely screened for CMD. Higher BMI is generally associated with the occurrence of CMD.","Sebilo, Motlalepula; Ledibane, Neo R.T.; Takuva, Simbarashe",South Afr J HIV Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8252144/,114

The diagnosis was assisted by metagenomic next-generation sequencing of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. CASE PRESENTATION: A 44-year-old Han Chinese inmate was transferred to the emergency department because of dry cough, chest tightness, and shortness of breath. The patient’s body temperature rose to 39.3 °C following empirical cephalosporin treatment for 1 week. The blood CD4+/CD8+ ratio was 0.7, suggesting immunodeficiency. Routine microbiological tests were performed, and tuberculosis interferon gamma release assays were positive. Mycobacterium tuberculosis polymerase chain reaction was also positive. Chest computed tomography scan revealed miliary nodules and ground-glass opacifications, which were in accordance with tuberculosis. To fully examine the etiology, we performed routine laboratory tests and metagenomic sequencing, the results of which indicated the presence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Tropheryma whipplei. We administered anti-tuberculosis regimen in combination with trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. The patient recovered, with chest computed tomography scan showing absorption of lesions. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with traditional diagnostic methods such as culture and serology, metagenomic next-generation sequencing has the advantage of detecting a wide array of microorganisms in a single test and therefore can be used for clinical diagnosis of rare pathogens and microbial coinfections. It is particularly useful for immunocompromised patients as they are more prone to infection by opportunistic microorganisms.","Zhu, Binghua; Tang, Jing; Fang, Rong; Fei, Xuejie; Wang, Qing; Wang, Wenqing; Wu, Xueqin; Liu, Chao; Wang, Qian",J Med Case Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8269402/,114

Thus, combating VH, requires adequate and updated training to the HCWs. With this objective, Project PRAKASH designed a meticulously planned training program, aimed to assess the effect of a one-day training on VH among in-service nurses. METHODS AND MATERIAL: The content and schedule of scientific sessions of the training program were decided by subject experts to improve knowledge, attitude and practice(KAP) related to VH among in-service nurses. A 54-item questionnaire divided into four domains: Transmission and Risk Factors; Prevention; Treatment; Pathophysiology and Disease Progression were used to assess the KAP related to VH. The questionnaire consisted of four sections: demographic details, knowledge(30-items), attitude(12-items) and practice(12-itmes) with a total score of 30, 60 and 24 respectively in each section. The pre-post knowledge assessment was done and impact assessment survey was undertaken among the participants who completed six months post-training period. Paired-t-test was used to assess the effect of training on knowledge using SPSSv-22. RESULTS: A total of 5253 HCWs were trained through 32 one-day trainings, however data for 4474 HCWs was included in final pre-post knowledge analysis after removing the missing/incomplete data. Mean age of participants was 33.7±8.4 with median experience of 8(IQR: 3–13). Mean improvement in knowledge score was found to be significant (p<0.001) with mean knowledge score of 19.3±4.4 in pre-test and 25.7±3.9 in the post-test out of 30.

Pazopanib is an oral multi-kinase angiogenesis inhibitor with promise to treat bleeding in HHT. We analyzed outcomes of HHT patients with the most severe bleeding causing RBC transfusion dependence treated on a predefined institutional pazopanib treatment pathway (with data collected retrospectively). The primary endpoint was achievement of transfusion independence. Secondary endpoints included hemoglobin, epistaxis severity score, RBC transfusion and iron infusion requirements, number of local hemostatic procedures, ferritin and transferrin saturation, compared using paired and repeated measures mean tests. Thirteen transfusion-dependent HHT patients received pazopanib [median (range) dose 150 (25–300) mg daily)] for a median of 22 months. All patients achieved transfusion independence. Compared with pretreatment, pazopanib increased mean hemoglobin by 4.8 (95% CI, 3.6–5.9) g/dL (7.8 vs. 12.7 g/dL, P < 0.0001) and decreased mean epistaxis severity score by 4.77 (3.11–6.44) points (7.20 vs. 2.43 points, P < 0.0001) after 12 months of treatment. Compared with 3 months of pretreatment, RBC transfusions decreased by 93% (median of 16.0 vs. 0.0 units, P < 0.0001) and elemental iron infusion decreased by 92% (median of 4500 vs. 0 mg, P = 0.005) during the first 3 months of treatment; improvements were maintained over time. Pazopanib was well-tolerated: hypertension, lymphocytopenia, and fatigue were the most common TEAEs. In conclusion, pazopanib was safe and effective to manage severe bleeding in HHT, liberating all patients from transfusion dependence and normalizing hematologic parameters at doses lower than used to treat malignancies.

Yet few studies have investigated the impact of a ”vegetables first” approach to complementary feeding, especially in New Zealand. The purpose of this randomised control trial is to investigate the effect of starting complementary feeding with vegetables only on infants’ later intake and liking of vegetables, compared to those starting with fruit and vegetables. METHODS/DESIGN: One-hundred and twenty mother-infant pairs living in Auckland, New Zealand, will be randomised to receive either vegetables only (intervention) or fruit and vegetables (control) for 28 days, starting from the first day of complementary feeding at around 4–6 months of age. Infants will be presented with a brassica (broccoli), followed by a green leafy vegetable (spinach) and sweet fruit (pear) at 9 months of age. The primary outcome measures of intake of each food will be assessed using a weighed food diary. Secondary outcome measures of overall intake, liking and wanting of vegetables will be assessed using a food frequency questionnaire, liking tool and video coding tool, respectively, at 9, 12, and 24 months of age. Infant growth and iron status will be assessed as part of health screening and monitoring at baseline, post intervention and 9 months of age. Other biological samples to be collected include infant stool samples, vitamin D (mother and infant), iron status (mother), and mothers’ diet. DISCUSSION: This randomised, controlled trial will be the first to our knowledge to investigate a “vegetables first” approach to complementary feeding on infants’ liking and intake of vegetables in New Zealand. Comparison against standard practice (fruit and vegetables as first foods) should complement other trials underway, such as the Baby’s First Bites and Nordic OTIS trial.

OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to develop a support model for nurses caring for people living with HIV and AIDS (PLWH). METHOD: The study employed concept analysis and the identified concept of interest within the caring context of HIV and AIDS was conceptualised using six elements of practice-oriented theory, namely, the context, agent, recipient, dynamic, procedure and purpose. RESULTS: The framework consisted of six components: health service and legislative (context); nursing service managers (agents); nurses (recipients); decreasing power imbalance, participative and transformational leadership and trust (dynamics); initiation of support process through teamwork and mutual goal-setting, implementation and sustenance through reflections, monitoring and evaluation (process) and empowered nurses (outcome). CONCLUSION: Poor organisational support deteriorates the quality of nurses’ lives on a personal level and imposes a direct economic cost on the employer by decreasing overall nursing workforce productivity. The conceptual framework could be a guide to support nurses in healthcare services regarding the management of HIV and AIDS in the workplace.","Ramathuba, Dorah U.; Makhado, Lufuno",Curationis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8335774/,114
20353,Topsy-Turvy Heart with Aortopulmonary Window and Severe Airway Malacia: Prenatal Diagnosis and Review of the Literature,2021-08-27,"The Australian and Canadian 24-hour movement guidelines for children and youth synthesized studies in English and French or other languages (if able to be translated with Google translate) and found very few studies published in English from Arabic countries that examined the relationship between objectively measured sedentary behaviour (SB), sleep and physical activity (PA) and health indicators in children aged 5–12 years. The purpose of this systematic review was to investigate the relationships between 24-hour movement behaviours and health indicators in school-aged children from Arab-speaking countries. Online databases MEDLINE, EMBASE, SPORTdiscus, CINAHL, PsycINFO and Scopus were searched for English, French and Arabic studies (written in English), while Saudi Digital Library, ArabBase, HumanIndex, KSUP, Pan-Arab Academic Journal, e-Marefa, Al Manhal eLibrary and Google Scholar were searched for Arabic studies. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation framework was used to assess the risk of bias and the quality of evidence for each health indicator. A total of 16 studies, comprising 15,346 participants from nine countries were included. These studies were conducted between 2000 and 2019. In general, low levels of PA and sleep and high SB were unfavourably associated with adiposity outcomes, behavioural problems, depression and low self-esteem. Favourable associations were reported between sleep duration and adiposity outcomes. SB was favourably associated with adiposity outcomes, withdrawn behaviour, attention and externalizing problems. PA was favourably associated with improved self-esteem and adiposity outcomes. Further studies to address the inequality in the literature in the Arab-speaking countries to understand the role of 24-hour movement behaviours and its positive influence on health outcomes across childhood are urgently needed.","Alanazi, Yazeed A.; Sousa-Sá, Eduarda; Chong, Kar Hau; Parrish, Anne-Maree; Okely, Anthony D.",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8391650/,114
20866,GLP-1 Receptor Agonists: Beyond Their Pancreatic Effects,2021-08-23,"Monomeric autotransporters have been used extensively to transport recombinant proteins or protein domains to the cell surface of Gram-negative bacteria amongst others for antigen display. Genetic fusion of such antigens into autotransporters has yielded chimeras that can be used for vaccination purposes. However, not every fusion construct is transported efficiently across the cell envelope. Problems occur in particular when the fused antigen attains a relatively complex structure in the periplasm, prior to its translocation across the outer membrane. The latter step requires the interaction with periplasmic chaperones and the BAM (β-barrel assembly machinery) complex in the outer membrane. This complex catalyzes insertion and folding of β-barrel outer membrane proteins, including the β-barrel domain of autotransporters. Here, we investigated whether the availability of periplasmic chaperones or the BAM complex is a limiting factor for the surface localization of difficult-to-secrete chimeric autotransporter constructs. Indeed, we found that overproduction of in particular the BAM complex, increases surface display of difficult-to-secrete chimeras. Importantly, this beneficial effect appeared to be generic not only for a number of monomeric autotransporter fusions but also for fusions to trimeric autotransporters. Therefore, overproduction of BAM might be an attractive strategy to improve the production of recombinant autotransporter constructs.

The bread industry is usually looking for ways to improve its formulations. Therefore, other ingredients such as dough conditioners, crumb softeners, emulsifiers, and surfactants can be added to enhance bread quality. These ingredients perform functions such as helping standardize processes in the industry, reducing dough-mixing time, increasing water absorption, improving bread quality, and extending its shelf life. Consumers are concerned about the effect of these ingredients on their health, and this has increased the popularity of clean-label bread formulations. A clean label generally indicates that a product is free of chemical additives, has an ingredient list that is easy to understand, has undergone natural or limited processing, and/or is organic and free of additives or preservatives. However, there is no scientific definition of the term “clean label.” Researchers have focused on these clean-label initiatives to replace dough strengtheners and preservatives in bread formulations and give consumers what they perceive as a healthier product.","Vargas, Maite Cristina Alava; Simsek, Senay",Foods,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8466822/,114

We investigated the impact of hospitalizations on outcomes in patients with IPF. METHODS: The IPF-PRO Registry is an observational US registry that enrolled patients with IPF that was diagnosed or confirmed at the enrolling center in the previous 6 months. Associations between patient characteristics and hospitalization, and between hospitalization and mortality, were analyzed using Cox regression models. RESULTS: A total of 1002 patients with IPF were enrolled into the IPF-PRO Registry. Over a median follow-up time of 23.7 months (maximum: 67.0 months), 568 patients (56.7%) had at least one hospitalization. Of these patients, 319 (56.2%) had at least one respiratory-related hospitalization and 120 (21.1%) had at least one hospitalization with ventilatory support. Younger age (HR 0.68 [95% CI 0.55, 0.84] per 5-year increase for patients < 62 years), lower BMI (0.96 [0.93, 0.98] per 1-point increase), lower FVC % predicted (0.90 [0.83, 0.97] per 10% increase), oxygen use at rest (2.85 [2.18, 3.72]) and history of pulmonary hypertension (2.02 [1.37, 2.96]) at enrollment were associated with an increased risk of respiratory-related hospitalization during follow-up. In a multivariable model, there was an eightfold increase in the risk of mortality during hospitalization or within 90 days of discharge compared with outside of this period. The risk of mortality associated with a respiratory hospitalization or a hospitalization with ventilatory support was even greater. CONCLUSIONS: Data from the IPF-PRO Registry demonstrate that hospitalizations are common among patients with IPF. The risk of mortality during hospitalization or within 90 days of discharge was high, particularly among patients who were hospitalized for a respiratory cause or received ventilatory support.

In recent years, attempts to image affected cells have also been part of these efforts. Many studies have proceeded to the preclinical stage and a fair number to early clinical testing with some showing encouraging results. However, real impact on patient survival remains to be seen. One major problem still to be overcome is the quantitative delivery of the vector into the tumor mass.

26223,Myocarditis,2007,"Models of epidemic spreading are widely used to predict the evolution of an outbreak, test specific intervention scenarios, and steer interventions in the field. Compartmental models are the most common class of models. They are very effective for qualitative analysis, but they rely on simplifying assumptions, such as homogeneous mixing and time scale separation. On the other end of the spectrum, detailed agent-based models, based on realistic mobility pattern models, provide extremely accurate predictions. However, these models require significant computing power and are not suitable for analytical treatment. Our research aims at bridging the gap between these two approaches, toward time-varying network models that are sufficiently accurate to make predictions for real-world applications, while being computationally affordable and amenable to analytical treatment. We leverage the novel paradigm of activity driven networks (ADNs), a particular type of time-varying network that accounts for inherent inhomogeinities within a population. Starting from the basic incarnation of ADNs, we expand on the framework to include behavioral factors triggered by health status and spreading awareness. The enriched paradigm is then utilized to model the 2014–2015 Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) spreading in Liberia, and perform a what-if analysis on the timely application of sanitary interventions in the field. Finally, we propose a new formulation, which is amenable to analytical treatment, beyond the mere computation of the epidemic threshold.","Rizzo, Alessandro; Porfiri, Maurizio",Temporal Network Epidemiology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123080/,114

32675,Contents in Brief,2020-05-19,"This chapter discusses and illustrates descriptive statistics. The purpose of the procedures and fundamental concepts reviewed in this chapter is quite straightforward: to facilitate the description and summarisation of data. By ‘describe’ we generally mean either the use of some pictorial or graphical representation of the data (e.g. a histogram, box plot, radar plot, stem-and-leaf display, icon plot or line graph) or the computation of an index or number designed to summarise a specific characteristic of a variable or measurement (e.g., frequency counts, measures of central tendency, variability, standard scores). Along the way, we explore the fundamental concepts of probability and the normal distribution. We seldom interpret individual data points or observations primarily because it is too difficult for the human brain to extract or identify the essential nature, patterns, or trends evident in the data, particularly if the sample is large. Rather we utilise procedures and measures which provide a general depiction of how the data are behaving. These statistical procedures are designed to identify or display specific patterns or trends in the data. What remains after their application is simply for us to interpret and tell the story.","Cooksey, Ray W.",Illustrating Statistical Procedures: Finding Meaning in Quantitative Data,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7221239/,114

Informative missingness can be incorporated in a clinical prediction model, for example by including a separate category of a predictor variable that has missing values. The predictive performance of such a model depends on the transportability of the missing data mechanism, which may be compromised once the model is deployed in practice and the predictive value of certain variables becomes known.

The primary findings suggest that while the technical instrumental discourses were dominant within the university bureaucracy, managers (particularly front line managers) drew upon practical relational and emancipatory critical transformative discourses to justify the considerable discretion they exercised in managing sick leave. Far from being incidental, these humanistic elements are as much a part of the bureaucracy as the rational elements and are fundamental to the system’s equilibrium.","Jaye, Chrystal; Richard, Lauralie; Amos, Claire; Noller, Geoff",Humanist Manag J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7402544/,114

ML in pediatrics is distinctly unique with clinical, technical, and ethical nuances limiting the direct translation of ML tools developed for adults to pediatric populations. To our knowledge, no work has yet focused on outlining the unique considerations that need to be taken into account when designing and implementing ML in pediatrics. RECENT FINDINGS: The nature of varying developmental stages and the prominence of family-centered care lead to vastly different data-generating processes in pediatrics. Data heterogeneity and a lack of high-quality pediatric databases further complicate ML research. In order to address some of these nuances, we provide a common pipeline for clinicians and computer scientists to use as a foundation for structuring ML projects, and a framework for the translation of a developed model into clinical practice in pediatrics. Throughout these pathways, we also highlight ethical and legal considerations that must be taken into account when working with pediatric populations and data. SUMMARY: Here, we describe a comprehensive outline of special considerations required of ML in pediatrics from project ideation to implementation. We hope this review can serve as a high-level guideline for ML scientists and clinicians alike to identify applications in the pediatric setting, generate effective ML solutions, and subsequently deliver them to patients, families, and providers.","Nagaraj, Sujay; Harish, Vinyas; McCoy, Liam G.; Morgado, Felipe; Stedman, Ian; Lu, Stephen; Drysdale, Erik; Brudno, Michael; Singh, Devin",Curr Treat Options Peds,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7490206/,114

While statistics collected and distributed by national and local governments are perhaps the most prevalent, some communities in both Canada and the United States have found great advantages to commissioning or administering their own surveys of local community members in order to enhance the insights that government-curated data can provide. In this paper we examine two organizations engaged with indicator projects that have opted to do so from the perspectives of their primary CI project supporters: the Vancouver Foundation in Canada and the Central New York Community Foundation in the United States. Among the advantages explored are increased capacity in key community leadership elements of: engaging residents, working across sectors, commissioning and disseminating local data and research, shaping public policy, and marshaling resources. We conclude by reflecting on the many synergies between the CI and community foundation (CF) movements, paying attention to their shared interests in community well-being through better conversations and coordination among the organizations in the communities they serve.","Ridzi, Frank; Prior, Trina",Int,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7640537/,114

The patients with pulmonary ENKL always presented unspecific symptoms of the respiratory system, such as cough with sputum and varying degrees of fever, while developing into acute respiratory distress (ARDS) was seldomly reported, especially promoted by the surgical procedure. CASE PRESENTATION: Here we describe a patient with nasal ENKL and most likely lung dissemination that was regarded as an infection at first. After nonresponse to a period of anti-infective therapy, this patient received surgical debridement. While the histopathology did not show the evidence of infection, but consistent with ENKL. The patient got refractory hypoxemia rapidly after surgery, with the LDH surging to a much higher level than before surgery. The ARDS was diagnosed, and he died on the 5th day after surgery.

It is observed that, the carbonates developed in the coal balls contain Fe, Mg and Mn which corresponds to the concentration of dolomite and indicates a relatively high salinity in the sedimentary environment or of the formation water. Raman spectrum of silica indicates the presence of hydroxylated nanometre sized α quartz- chalcedony in the coal balls. We construe the incorporation of electrolyte rich solution in the coal swamps near sea shore took place due to repeated influx of sea water in lagoonal condition facilitating precipitation of chalcedony in a restricted alkaline environment thus created.","Mahanta, Bashab N.; Sekhose, K.; Goswami, Tapos Kr.; Vitso, V.; Sarmah, Ranjan Kr.; Kumar, Amit; Kumar, Raman",J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7811150/,114

These forces are typically simulated using added masses, a method that uses mass to compensate for not computing these forces directly. In this paper we propose simple mathematical model to compute diffraction force. The model is based on Lagrangian description of the flow and uses law of reflection to include diffraction term in the solution. The solution satisfies continuity equation and equation of motion, but is restricted to the boundary of the ship hull. The solution was implemented in velocity potential solver in Virtual testbed—a programme for workstations that simulates ship motions in extreme conditions. Performance benchmarks of the solver showed that it is particularly efficient on graphical accelerators.","Petriakov, Ivan; Degtyarev, Alexander; Egorov, Denis; Gankevich, Ivan; Gavrikov, Anton; Grigorev, Artemii; Khramushin, Vasily",Computational Science and Its Applications - ICCSA 2020,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7974967/,114

This chapter will address problems on which there is scientific consensus, notably expressed in the IPCC’s Assessment Reports, while the next one will deal more broadly with the uncertainties about these ongoing processes’ possible outcomes. Both chapters present a unitary and articulated view of the current climate emergency and should, therefore, be considered together. There is clear evidence that the current atmospheric concentration of CO(2) is unprecedented, considering the past three million years. As a result, average global warming reached 1 °C in 2015 and 1.2 °C in 2019 above the pre-industrial period. It is now accelerating toward 1.5 °C, a very dangerous level of warming, considered imminent by the majority of climate scientists. Furthermore, given society’s weak political resistance and the current power of corporations to impose their worldviews and business plans on humanity, a global average warming below 2 °C is increasingly considered a social–physical impossibility. With the absence of drastic and immediate reductions in GHG emissions, the most likely scenarios lead to an average global warming between 3.1 °C and 4.8 °C by 2100. It is difficult to imagine the terribly inhospitable world that would be created by this catastrophic warming, but there are many attempts to highlight at least some of its most likely features.","Marques, Luiz",Capitalism and Environmental Collapse,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7978722/,114

While I agree that an individual and institutional mind shift is our secret weapon toward systemic transformation, I opt for a much more differentiated analysis of what that means. Why? Because a simple mind shift from an infantile, and linearly thinking, egocentric mindset to an ethnocentric mindset, à la “make America great again,” is not sufficient, whether it occurs in individuals or in institutions. We need a world-centric shift in mindsets because our problems are global and, like tech, growing exponentially. In this chapter, I dig deeper into the concept of mind shift by highlighting the hidden determinants and patterns of human evolution and share the results of my own 15 years of research that was triggered by my personal experiences. Moreover, I hypothesize that the great mind shift toward world-centric levels of consciousness I saw emerging in my research could represent an encouraging trend. I draw on established models and theories of consciousness evolution by Abraham Maslow, Clare Graves, Susanne Cook-Greuter, and Ken Wilber, among others, to lay the theoretical foundation of Integral Investing. I go deeper into human psychology in an attempt to show the way to personal liberation from scarcity thinking and our dependency on money and material things and use Joseph Campbell’s Hero’s Journey to demonstrate how it is possible to achieve that.","Bozesan, Mariana",Integral Investing,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7978734/,114

This paper focuses on the Caribbean region’s contradictory integration into the globalization phase of world capitalism. As dominant groups facilitate new accumulation networks, workers have been compelled to incorporate their labor power into transnational value chains. Markets once segmented by national economies are fragmenting and becoming functionally integrated across borders. In this paper, I outline five strategic traits unfolding across the region: (1) the rise of a transnational financial system into which Caribbean society has become integrated, (2) the envelopment of the region by transnational production networks, (3) the marginalization, flexibilization and precarization of negatively racialized and gendered workers in relation to capitalist globalization, (4) the emergence of transnationally oriented state elites across the Caribbean alongside the restructuring of U.S. domination, and (5) new subcontractor networks through which local business groups deepen their transnational integration.

This requires the analysis of levels of reality, complexity and approaches to scientific method. In this regard, scientific processes can be procedures and methods. The procedures contribute to the initial stages of the inquiry and can complement the rigorous methods. Meanwhile, the methods enlarge our knowledge according to well-established ways or follow research processes whose reliability has been tested. Scientific research needs methods that deal with objects and problems, whose diversity offers reasons for the unfeasibility of a universal method for science and poses problems for methodological imperialism. The existence of levels of reality (micro, meso, and macro) and the features of complexity, structural and dynamic complexity, pave the way for methodological diversity. Thus, empirical sciences show different approaches to scientific method, such as the differences between natural sciences and social sciences, and also the novelty of the sciences of the artificial in comparison with the social sciences. Consequently, the relations of the scientific methods with the levels of reality and complexity require a deeper view than the conceptions already available.","Gonzalez, Wenceslao J.",Methodological Prospects for Scientific Research,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7991509/,114

51598,AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine: thrombosis with thrombocytopenia,2021-04-17,"OBJECTIVES: How general practice is delivered in many countries has drastically changed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This study aimed to answer the question of how general practice has changed in Ireland in response to COVID-19. DESIGN: The Irish College of General Practitioners surveyed its membership before and after the global pandemic hit Ireland using a cross-sectional online survey instrument. SETTING: This study focuses on primary care, specifically general practice, in Ireland. PARTICIPANTS: In February 2020 before the global pandemic, 526 general practices across Ireland submitted responses to the survey; 538 general practices responded to the second survey during the pandemic in June 2020. This covers 32% and 33% of practices in Ireland, respectively. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The type of consultations by general practitioners (GPs) and practice nurses in both surveys is the main outcome measure reported in this paper. Other changes such as the perceived change in attendance by certain patient groups and practice income are also reported. RESULTS: Face-to-face consultations significantly (p<0.001) decreased from a median of 26 (IQR 21.3–30) to a median of 8 (IQR 6–13). GP telemedicine consultations increased (p<0.001) from a median of 2.4 (IQR 0–5.3) to a median of 11.3 (IQR 6–19). The majority of practices (80.0%) reported reduced practice profit. Respondents reported a decline in non-COVID-19-related consultations among certain patient cohorts—92.0% for children under 6 years old; 79.5% for patients over 70 years. CONCLUSIONS: It is likely that the way general practice is delivered will not return to as it was before the COVID-19 pandemic and increased telemedicine can be expected. However, it is necessary to assess the impact of this shift on patient health and to assess healthcare provider and patient experience to ensure continued high-quality care and patient safety.","Homeniuk, Robyn; Collins, Claire",BMJ Open,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8039245/,114
51783,Suicidality Associated With Deep Brain Stimulation in Extrapyramidal Diseases: A Critical Review and Hypotheses on Neuroanatomical and Neuroimmune Mechanisms,2021-04-08,"BACKGROUND: Following COVID-19 pandemic, clinical description focused on the clinical presentation of patients in the acute stage of the disease. More recently, data have emerged that some patients continue to experience symptoms related to COVID-19 after the acute phase of infection has subsided (post-COVID syndrome). Although characteristics of post-COVID syndrome have been well described, less is known about the possible invitations during acute illnesses that can predict such syndrome. Our study is a prospective study aiming at assessment of CT severity scoring in the acute phase of COVID-19 pneumonia as a predictor for development of post-COVID syndrome in recovering patients. RESULTS: A total of 192 symptomatic COVID-19 patients between April 2020 and October 2020 were enrolled in this single-center study, and high-resolution chest CT examinations were evaluated for CT severity scoring. Data were matched with the long-term clinical outcome. CT severity score was significantly higher in patients who developed post-COVID symptoms (p < 0.001). A CT score of > 7 was associated with an increased risk and was found to be predictive of condition development with sensitivity (95.9%), specificity (96%), positive predictive value (95.92%), negative predictive value (96%), and accuracy (95.96%). CONCLUSIONS: CT severity scoring can help in predicting the long-term outcome of COVID-19 patients with cutoff value of CT-SSS > 7 showing highest sensitivity and specificity for predicting development of post-COVID syndrome.","Saad, Mohammad A.; El Khateeb, Ahmed F.; Ahmed, Mona I.; Magdy, Ahmed M.",Egypt J Radiol Nucl Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8050512/,114

The first outbreak of the bubonic plague in Norwich was in 1349 when Julian was only six years old and continued for another twenty-one years of sporadic outbreaks in East Anglia. Despite this formative experience, scholarly treatments of the plague’s impact on Julian’s writing focus primarily on her use of maternal imagery as a pre-existing general trend in mystic texts which developed a new significance in post-plague religious writing. The divine mother figure was now not only a creator but a source of protection and comfort. While this is certainly true, this is also perhaps a bit myopic. A holistic view of her book of “Showings” reveals that the plague and its aftermath are actually central to her theosophical project. By evoking imagery of the Black Death in her explanation of the Passion and the existence of suffering, Julian of Norwich sought to restore unity to medieval English society through a re-envisioning of the Holy Trinity as Earthly authority figures: family/household, Holy Mother Church, and feudal lord.","Fulloon, J.

Pennine Acute Hospitals NHS Trust serves over a million patients with a significant number of face-to-face fracture clinics. Introduction of a Virtual Fracture Clinic (VFC) reduces hospital return rates and improves patient experience. The referral data can be used to give immediate monthly feedback to the referring department to further improving patient flow. METHOD: Prospective data was collected for all referrals to VFC during March 2020. Data included referral diagnosis, actual diagnosis, referrers grade, and final outcome. RESULTS: 630 referrals were made to VFC. 347 (55%) of those referrals were directly discharged without the need for physical consultation. Of these 114 (32%) were injuries which can be discharged by the Emergency Department with an advice leaflet using existing pathways. Of the remaining discharges 102 (29%) were query fractures or sprains; and 135 (39%) were minor fractures; which needed only advice via a letter and no face to face follow up. CONCLUSIONS: Implementation of VFC leads to a decrease in physical appointments by 55% saving 347 face to face appointments. The new system has also facilitated effective audit of referrals in order to further improve patient flow from the Emergency Department via feedback mechanisms and education.","Havenhand, T; Hoggett, L; Bhutta, A",Br J Surg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8135833/,114

In response to this demand, the present study aimed to identify the meanings attributed to the new coronavirus by Brazilians at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. We had access to a non-probabilistic sample of 2400 Brazilians, who answered a biodemographic questionnaire, using the technique of free word association, with the induced stimulus “coronavirus,” respectively interpreted through descriptive statistics using the SPSS software and textual analysis using IRaMuTeQ. The results were organized into three classes: (1) “characterization of the disease,” evoking responses about the treatment, risks, prevention strategies, and expectations of cure; (2) “negative repercussions,” reflecting harmful aspects of the disease on mental health, such as fear, uncertainty, and despair; and (3) “positive repercussions,” revealing initiatives of solidarity, empathy, and collective care as coping strategies. Differences in evocations also arose depending on the region of the country, employment status, adherence to social isolation measures, agreement with social isolation, agreement with the current president, experience of infection, and level of stress. It was concluded that identifying the meanings that Brazilians attribute to the new coronavirus is important for the formulation of effective intervention strategies.

54384,Status of Vitamin D Receptor Gene Polymorphism and 25-Hydroxy Vitamin D Deficiency with Essential Hypertension,2021-06-15,"BACKGROUND: Budesonide MMX (Cortiment) is superior to placebo for mild to moderate UC flares and has a favourable side effect profile. However, no head-to-head data with Prednisolone exist. During the COVID-19 pandemic many IBD units chose Cortiment as first line treatment for outpatients’ flares of UC. The aim of this retrospective study was to compare outcomes of Cortiment vs Prednisolone treatment for UC. METHODS: Hospital based prescriptions from of 3 UK IBD units were extracted from computerized pharmacy records for the time periods between 1/3/2019 – 30/6/2019 and 1/3/2020 – 30/6/2020. All adult outpatients treated with oral steroids for a flare of UC were included. Baseline data included age, sex, phenotype, IBD medications, symptoms and changes to medication at time of steroid prescription. Follow up data included need for hospital admission for acute severe ulcerative colitis, symptoms at 4 weeks and end of treatment, need for rescue Prednisolone (Cortiment group only). Primary outcome was symptomatic improvement at 4 weeks. RESULTS: The 2019 (94 patients) and 2020 (127 patients) cohorts did not differ significantly with regards to age, sex, phenotype and baseline characteristics. The proportion of Cortiment prescriptions rose significantly from 24.5% in 2019 to 70.1% in 2020 (p<0.001). At week 4 of treatment there were statistically significant differences in mean bowel frequency (3.49 in 2019 vs 5.85 in 2020, p=0.001), rectal bleeding <50% (89.7% of patients in 2019 vs 73.1% in 2020, p=0.039) and physician global assessment (39.2% of patients in remission in 2019 compared to 19.8% in 2020, p=0.045).There was no significant difference in hospital admissions, rectal bleeding and physician global assessment at end of treatment. Patients prescribed Cortiment in 2019 had similar baseline characteristics to those prescribed Cortiment in 2020. Mean bowel frequency at four weeks was significantly higher in 2020 (6.18) compared to 2019 (3.69, p=0.034), but rectal bleeding (p=0.388) and physician global assessment at week four did not differ between 2019 and 2020 (p=0.422). Rescue Prednisolone was required in 10% of Cortiment patients in 2019 vs 31.3% in 2020 (p=0.058). CONCLUSION: Cortiment was used as the main first line steroid for UC during the pandemic to reduce the risk of adverse COVID-19 outcomes. This change in treatment was, however, associated with worse UC outcomes at 4 weeks and 31% needed rescue Prednisolone. As active IBD is associated with worse COVID-19 outcomes clinicians should carefully evaluate the choice of steroid to achieve optimal disease control and COVID-19 risk minimization.","Rosiou, K; Ong Ming San, E; Kumar, A; Esquivel, K; Almas, S; Stokes, D; Ng, T; Jayasooriya, N; Ranasinghe, I; Pollok, R; Brookes, M; Selinger, C P",J Crohns Colitis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8194714/,114

We carried out a rapid survey to estimate the proportion of HCWs who are serologically positive for SARS-CoV-2 in the Lokmanya Tilak Municipal General Hospital, Mumbai, India. MATERIAL AND METHODS: After the consent of the hospital authorities, volunteers were asked to report at a special booth set up in the hospital between May 1, 2020, and May 16, 2020. After consent, each worker was administered a questionnaire using a handheld computer which had questions on symptoms in the past 30 days, place of posting (COVID designated area or other), work category (doctor/nurse/others), use of personal protective equipment, smoking, comorbidity, and exposure followed by a test for COVID-19 using the STANDARD Q COVID-19 IgM/ IgG Duo Test of SD Biosensor. We estimated weighted seroprevalence with 95% confidence limits after adjusting for the work category. We calculated the adjusted odds ratio (aOR) using logistic regression with seropositivity as an outcome variable and others as independent variables. RESULTS: The final sample included 501 and 1051 subjects working in the COVID area and non-COVID area, respectively, covering 35% of the total staff of the hospital. Overall, 6.9% (95% CI of 5.7–8.2) of the hospital staff was serologically positive for SARS-Cov-2, similar in the COVID area –5.7 (3.8–8.1) and non-COVID area –7.2 (5.7–9.0). Age more than 50 years (aOR 2.65; 1.45–4.85) and being in others work category 2.84 (1.34–6.02) were identified as significant predictors of being seropositive. Only 10% of the subjects reported COVID-like illness in the past 1 month. CONCLUSION: The overall modest prevalence of infection among the health care workers, especially non-doctors and nurses, and similarity of prevalence in COVID and non-COVID area staff indicate the possibility of non-hospital source of infection.","Baveja, Sujata; Karnik, Nitin; Natraj, Gita; Natkar, Milind; Bakshi, Asha; Krishnan, Anand",Indian J Med Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8219003/,114

It is a major public health issue in underdeveloped and developing countries. The aim of the study is to find out the prevalence of enteric fever pathogens in blood culture of patients attending a tertiary care centre. METHODS: A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted in 3483 blood samples of patients attending a tertiary care centre, with the history and symptoms suspicious of enteric fever during one year period from mid-September 2019 to mid-September 2020 after ethical approval from the institutional review committee. Isolates were identified by standard microbiological methods and tested for in vitro antibiotic susceptibility by modified kirby-bauer disc diffusion method. The obtained data was entered and analyzed in WHONET 5.6 program, point estimate at 95% was calculated along with frequency and proportion for binary data. RESULTS: In our study, enteric fever pathogens were isolated from 18 (0.51%) blood samples. Out of which, Salmonella Paratyphi A was isolated from 10 (8.19%) and Salmonella Typhi was isolated from 8 (6.55%) blood samples. Other serotypes were not isolated. Antimicrobial susceptibility test showed that salmonella species that was isolated were sensitive to most of the drugs. CONCLUSIONS: Prevalence of enteric fever pathogens was lesser compared to other studies. Varying degrees of antibiotic resistance among isolated enteric fever pathogens necessitates continuous surveillance of the susceptibility patterns. Prudent use of antimicrobials, active infection control practices and stringent antibiotic policy should be implemented to prevent emergence of antibiotic resistance and future outbreaks.","Manandhar, Ruchee; Raghubanshi, Bijendra Raj; Neupane, Sweekrity; Lama, Rajni",JNMA J Nepal Med Assoc,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8369545/,114

This paper evaluates the recorded ground motions, summarizes the performance of structures affected from the earthquake with emphasis on the reasons of damage. A detailed damage assessment was carried out by the Earthquake Engineering Research Center of Middle East Technical University to compile data on the damage of RC and masonry buildings. It was observed that majority of the damage was concentrated in the Bayraklı district due to its peculiar soil properties where many 7–10 story mid-rise RC buildings suffered heavy damage and collapse. The level of amplified ground motions combined with deficiencies of apparently non-code compliant buildings exacerbated the damage. The main reasons of damage were mainly attributed to the presence of soft stories, lack of proper detailing, poor construction quality, presence of heavy overhangs, and hence significant lack of code-compliance in essence. The influence of infill walls on seismic performance of deficient and inadequate buildings was clearly seen in this earthquake. This paper also discusses seismic code requirements in effect and their influence on the observed building performance. The recorded ground motions were compared with the code spectra to evaluate the performance of the buildings. The code response spectra were found to be well above the recorded ground motion spectra at the sites where significant damage was observed.","Yakut, Ahmet; Sucuoğlu, Halûk; Binici, Baris; Canbay, Erdem; Donmez, Cemalettin; İlki, Alper; Caner, Alp; Celik, Ozan Cem; Ay, Bekir Özer",Bull Earthquake Eng,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8435758/,114

All 12 schools had significant numbers of Indigenous Māori students whose iwi (tribal) ancestry connected to the region over centuries. Using a mixed methods approach, the study investigated the specific ‘across and within’ school interventions that positively impacted Māori student engagement in learning. Evidence was collected by seeking the views and opinions of students, teachers and whānau (family). Interventions and strategies included collaboration between Māori teachers and across-school leaders, positive school culture focused on the health and well-being of students, localised curricula, and substantial use of te reo Māori and tikanga in most schools. School principals reported limited collaboration with each other due to perceived competition between schools for student enrollments, which is counter to the policy drivers for the Kāhui Ako initiative. Results indicated that culturally inclusive leaders and teachers must deliberately focus on motivating students for their positive futures. This is key to improving the academic and social outcomes for Māori students.","Highfield, Camilla; Webber, Melinda",NZ J Educ Stud,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8480114/,114

Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a useful model to study questions regarding cell aggregation, heterogeneity and cooperation. In this review, we discuss scenarios of group formation and how this promotes facultative multicellularity in S. cerevisiae. We first describe proximate mechanisms leading to aggregation. These mechanisms include staying together and coming together, and can lead to group heterogeneity. Heterogeneity is promoted by nutrient limitation, structured environments and aging. We then characterize the evolutionary benefits and costs of facultative multicellularity in yeast. We summarize current knowledge and focus on the newest state-of-the-art discoveries that will fuel future research programmes aiming to understand facultative microbial multicellularity.","Opalek, Monika; Wloch-Salamon, Dominika",Genes,https://doi.org/10.3390/genes11060690; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32599749/,114
59742,Tools for predicting patient-reported outcomes in prostate cancer patients undergoing radical prostatectomy: a systematic review of prognostic accuracy and validity.,2017,"Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) is a mosquito-borne RNA virus that causes low mortality but high morbidity rates in humans. In addition to natural outbreaks, there is the potential for exposure to VEEV via aerosolized virus particles. There are currently no FDA-licensed vaccines or antiviral therapies for VEEV. Passive immunotherapy is an approved method used to protect individuals against several pathogens and toxins. Human polyclonal antibodies (PAbs) are ideal, but this is dependent upon serum from convalescent human donors, which is in limited supply. Non-human-derived PAbs can have serious immunoreactivity complications, and when ""humanized,"" these antibodies may exhibit reduced neutralization efficiency. To address these issues, transchromosomic (Tc) bovines have been created, which can produce potent neutralizing human antibodies in response to hyperimmunization. In these studies, we have immunized these bovines with different VEEV immunogens and evaluated the protective efficacy of purified preparations of the resultant human polyclonal antisera against low- and high-dose VEEV challenges. These studies demonstrate that prophylactic or therapeutic administration of the polyclonal antibody preparations (TcPAbs) can protect mice against lethal subcutaneous or aerosol challenge with VEEV. Furthermore, significant protection against unrelated coinfecting viral pathogens can be conferred by combining individual virus-specific TcPAb preparations.IMPORTANCE With the globalization and spread or potential aerosol release of emerging infectious diseases, it will be critical to develop platforms that are able to produce therapeutics in a short time frame. By using a transchromosomic (Tc) bovine platform, it is theoretically possible to produce antigen-specific highly neutralizing therapeutic polyclonal human antibody (TcPAb) preparations in 6 months or less. In this study, we demonstrate that Tc bovine-derived Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV)-specific TcPAbs are highly effective against VEEV infection that mimics not only the natural route of infection but also infection via aerosol exposure. Additionally, we show that combinatorial TcPAb preparations can be used to treat coinfections with divergent pathogens, demonstrating that the Tc bovine platform could be beneficial in areas where multiple infectious diseases occur contemporaneously or in the case of multipathogen release.","Gardner, Christina L; Sun, Chengqun; Luke, Thomas; Raviprakash, Kanakatte; Wu, Hua; Jiao, Jin-An; Sullivan, Eddie; Reed, Douglas S; Ryman, Kate D; Klimstra, William B",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00226-17; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28468884/,114

60288,Update on Current Technologies for Deep Brain Stimulation in Parkinson's Disease.,2020-08-31,"BACKGROUND To date, the prevalence and severity of the COVID-19 disease in children is lower than in adults. There are controversies regarding the dynamics of transmission and the role they play in the spread of the disease. AIM To describe the clinical characteristics and transmission dynamics of patients under 15 years of age reported for suspicion and/or contact for COVID-19 in the period March 13 - November 20, 2020, in a private comprehensive health provider (Médica Uruguaya Medical Assistance Corporation, MUCAM). METHODS Descriptive, retrospective study, in which clinical manifestations, epidemiological notion, secondary cases, severity and evolution are described. The risk and rate of secondary intradomiciliary attack were estimated. RESULTS 539 patients met the inclusion criteria. The diagnosis was confirmed in 29 (5.3%): 13 (7.0%) of the 351 symptomatic children and 16 (4.5%) of the 188 asymptomatic. 100% of the confirmed cases and 85% of the unconfirmed cases had the notion of contact (p < 0.05). The OR for infection from an indoor contact was 26.5 (9.8-71.7) and the rate of secondary indoor attack 23% ± 4.1. CONCLUSIONS In this series, mild and asymptomatic forms predominated in patients under 15 years of age. One in five exposed indoors contracted the disease, this notion of contact being decisive to indicate confirmatory studies. Most of the children did not continue the chain of transmission.","Giachetto, Gustavo; Mauvezin, Joaquín; Babio, Silvina; Dabezies, Camila; Calvo, Laura; Mara, Pamela",Revista chilena de infectologia : organo oficial de la Sociedad Chilena de Infectologia,https://doi.org/10.4067/s0716-10182021000400500; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34652395/,114

61584,Challenging the Status Quo of Scientific Presentations.,2020-11-05,"BACKGROUND Platelet function testing is controversial and not well studied in patients with neurovascular disease. OBJECTIVE To evaluate the performance of thromboelastography (TEG) as a platelet function test in neurovascular patients treated with the Pipeline embolization device (PED). METHODS A prospective protocol was instituted for platelet function testing in patients undergoing repair of intracranial aneurysms with the PED. All patients received dual antiplatelet therapy (DAT) and their response to both P2Y12 inhibitors and aspirin was quantified with TEG. Each patient's DAT induction strategy was tailored based on the percentage ADP-induced and percentage arachidonic acid-induced platelet inhibition reported by TEG. Data collected included clinical presentation, aneurysm characteristics, treatment details, and periprocedural events. Patients were followed up clinically and/or angiographically at 30 days, 6 months, and 1 year. RESULTS Thirty-four PED procedures were performed on 31 patients. TEG results altered the DAT strategy in 35% of patients. Technical success with the Pipeline placement was 100%. Two patients had minor strokes and five had transient ischemic attacks (TIAs). There have been no hemorrhagic complications. No patient had permanent neurologic deficits. Six of eight (75%) of patients with thromboembolic/TIA events were ADP-induced hyporesponders by TEG. Our 6- and 12-month angiographic occlusion rates were 78.9% and 89.5%, respectively. The 19 major branches covered by the PED that were assessed by follow-up imaging have all remained patent. CONCLUSIONS Platelet function testing with TEG altered our DAT induction strategy in a significant number of cases. No hemorrhagic or disabling thromboembolic complications were seen in this series. Future studies should compare methods of platelet function testing and, possibly, no platelet function testing in neurovascular patients undergoing flow diversion and/or stent-assisted treatment of intracranial aneurysms.","McTaggart, Ryan A; Choudhri, Omar A; Marcellus, Mary L; Brennan, Tom; Steinberg, Gary K; Dodd, Robert L; Do, Huy M; Marks, Michael P",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,https://doi.org/10.1136/neurintsurg-2013-011089; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24739599/,114

62111,Inhibitory concentration of propofol in combination with dexmedetomidine during microelectrode recording for deep brain stimulator insertion surgeries under general anesthesia.,2020-01-14,"BACKGROUND Gynecological Teaching Associates (GTAs) and Male Urogenital Teaching Associates (MUTAs) are individuals trained to instruct health professional learners with their own body to conduct accurate, patient-centered breast, pelvic, urogenital, rectal, and/or prostate examinations. Evidence indicates that this results in improvements in technical competence and communication skills, but there is wide variability to how such programs are implemented and engaged within the curriculum. In this scoping review, we mapped evidence regarding (1) how GTA/MUTA programs are utilized with health professional learners, (2) how GTA/MUTA programs are implemented using the Association of Standardized Patient Educators (ASPE) Standards of Best Practice (SOBP) as a framework, and (3) what broad outcomes are addressed in publications. METHODS PubMed, ERIC, PsychINFO, CINAHL, and Sociological Abstracts were searched for all publications addressing instruction of physical examinations with a GTA/MUTA and/or administration of GTA/MUTA programs. Studies were charted in tandem until consensus was identified and then charted individually, using an iterative process. The scoping review protocol was registered prospectively. RESULTS One hundred and one articles were identified, and nearly all highlighted positive results regarding GTA/MUTA programs. Most studies addressed medical students within the USA and Europe. During instructional sessions, three (SD=1.4) learners worked with each GTA/MUTA and an average of 32 min (SD=17) was allocated per learner. GTAs/MUTA instructed both independently (n=33) and in pairs (n=51). Thirty-eight articles provided detailed information consistent with one or more of the Domains of the ASPE SOBP, with six providing specific information regarding safe work environments. CONCLUSIONS While studies demonstrate consistently positive outcomes for learners, there is wide variability in implementation patterns. This variability may impact learning outcomes and impact both physical and psychological safety for GTAs/MUTAs and learners. Terminology used to refer to GTAs/MUTAs is inconsistent and may obscure relevant publications. Additional research is indicated to explore the pedagogical variables that result in positive learning outcomes and examine methods to ensure physical and psychological safety of GTAs/MUTAs and learners.

62399,Ambulatory cardiology telemedicine: a large academic pediatric center experience.,2021-03-12,"OBJECTIVE More than half of extremely preterm infants are delivered by cesarean section. Few data are available about severe maternal morbidity (SMM) of these extremely preterm cesarean. The objective was to determine whether gestational age under 26 weeks of gestation (weeks) was associated with an increased risk of SMM compared with gestational age between 26 and 34 weeks in women having a cesarean delivery. MATERIAL AND METHODS We searched MEDLINE, ISI Web of Science, the Cochrane Database, PROSPERO, and ClinicalTrials.gov on January 31, 2020. The search strategy clustered terms describing SMM and preterm cesarean delivery. No restrictions on language, publication status, and study design were applied. Abstracts were included if there was sufficient information to assess study quality. The authors of all identified studies were contacted to request for aggregated data. Relative risks (RR) were calculated using the inverse variance method. The primary outcome was SMM as defined in each study. We analyzed data on preterm cesarean deliveries between 22 and 34 weeks. The protocol was registered in PROSPERO (registration: CRD42019128644). RESULTS Six studies involving 45,572 women (3,440 delivering < 26 weeks; 42,132 delivering between 26 and 34 weeks) were included. SMM occurred in 607 women (17.6 %) < 26 weeks and 4,483 women (10.6 %) between 26 and 34 weeks. Gestational age < 26 weeks was associated with an increased risk of SMM (RR, 1.65; 95 % CI [Confidence Interval], 1.52-1.78; I2 = 40 %). Gestational age < 26 weeks remained associated with SMM in the subgroup analyses depending on the type of the study (prospective or retrospective), country of the study (European or non-European), and high quality of the study. A sensitivity analysis showed that gestational age < 25 weeks was also associated with SMM in preterm cesarean delivery (RR, 1.66; 95 % CI, 1.50-1.83; I2 = 3%). CONCLUSIONS Gestational age < 26 weeks was associated with an increased risk of SMM in women having a preterm cesarean delivery. Obstetricians and neonatologists should be aware of the increased risk of SMM in cesarean.","Blanc, Julie; Rességuier, Noémie; Loundou, Anderson; Boyer, Laurent; Auquier, Pascal; Tosello, Barthélémy; d'Ercole, Claude","European journal of obstetrics, gynecology, and reproductive biology",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejogrb.2021.04.022; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33932682/,114
62451,Utility of remission criteria for the renal prognosis of IgA nephropathy.,2021-05-11,"A novel coronavirus-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-emerged in humans in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 and has since disseminated globally1,2. As of April 16, 2020, the confirmed case count of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) had surpassed 2 million. Based on full-genome sequence analysis, SARS-CoV-2 shows high homology to SARS-related coronaviruses identified in horseshoe bats1,2. Here we show the establishment and characterization of expandable intestinal organoids derived from horseshoe bats of the Rhinolophus sinicus species that can recapitulate bat intestinal epithelium. These bat enteroids are fully susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection and sustain robust viral replication. Development of gastrointestinal symptoms in some patients with COVID-19 and detection of viral RNA in fecal specimens suggest that SARS-CoV-2 might cause enteric, in addition to respiratory, infection3,4. Here we demonstrate active replication of SARS-CoV-2 in human intestinal organoids and isolation of infectious virus from the stool specimen of a patient with diarrheal COVID-19. Collectively, we established the first expandable organoid culture system of bat intestinal epithelium and present evidence that SARS-CoV-2 can infect bat intestinal cells. The robust SARS-CoV-2 replication in human intestinal organoids suggests that the human intestinal tract might be a transmission route of SARS-CoV-2.","Zhou, Jie; Li, Cun; Liu, Xiaojuan; Chiu, Man Chun; Zhao, Xiaoyu; Wang, Dong; Wei, Yuxuan; Lee, Andrew; Zhang, Anna Jinxia; Chu, Hin; Cai, Jian-Piao; Yip, Cyril Chik-Yan; Chan, Ivy Hau-Yee; Wong, Kenneth Kak-Yuen; Tsang, Owen Tak-Yin; Chan, Kwok-Hung; Chan, Jasper Fuk-Woo; To, Kelvin Kai-Wang; Chen, Honglin; Yuen, Kwok Yung",Nature medicine,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41591-020-0912-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32405028/,114

65212,Hydroxychloroquine as Postexposure Prophylaxis for Covid-19.,2020-07-15,"OBJECTIVE For children with cyanotic congenital heart disease or acute hypoxemic respiratory failure, providers frequently make decisions based on pulse oximetry, in the absence of an arterial blood gas. The study objective was to measure the accuracy of pulse oximetry in the saturations from pulse oximetry (SpO2) range of 65% to 97%. METHODS This institutional review board-approved prospective, multicenter observational study in 5 PICUs included 225 mechanically ventilated children with an arterial catheter. With each arterial blood gas sample, SpO2 from pulse oximetry and arterial oxygen saturations from CO-oximetry (SaO2) were simultaneously obtained if the SpO2 was ≤ 97%. RESULTS The lowest SpO2 obtained in the study was 65%. In the range of SpO2 65% to 97%, 1980 simultaneous values for SpO2 and SaO2 were obtained. The bias (SpO2 - SaO2) varied through the range of SpO2 values. The bias was greatest in the SpO2 range 81% to 85% (336 samples, median 6%, mean 6.6%, accuracy root mean squared 9.1%). SpO2 measurements were close to SaO2 in the SpO2 range 91% to 97% (901 samples, median 1%, mean 1.5%, accuracy root mean squared 4.2%). CONCLUSIONS Previous studies on pulse oximeter accuracy in children present a single number for bias. This study identified that the accuracy of pulse oximetry varies significantly as a function of the SpO2 range. Saturations measured by pulse oximetry on average overestimate SaO2 from CO-oximetry in the SpO2 range of 76% to 90%. Better pulse oximetry algorithms are needed for accurate assessment of children with saturations in the hypoxemic range.","Ross, Patrick A; Newth, Christopher J L; Khemani, Robinder G",Pediatrics,https://doi.org/10.1542/peds.2013-1760; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24344108/,114
65389,Interstitial pneumonitis in the COVID-19 era: a difficult differential diagnosis in patients with lung cancer.,2020-08-26,"HYPOTHESIS We investigated if current-generation computed tomographic (CT) scanners have the resolution required to objectively detect bone structure defects as small as 0.1 mm. In addition, we propose that our method is able to predict a possible dehiscence in a semicircular canal. BACKGROUND In semicircular canal dehiscence (SCD), the bone overlying the superior canal (SC) is partially absent, causing vertigo, autophony, hyperacusis or hearing loss. Diagnosis of SCD is typically based on multi-slice computed tomography (MSCT) images combined with the consideration of clinical signs and symptoms. Recent studies have shown that MSCT tends to overestimate the size of dehiscences and may skew the diagnosis towards dehiscence when a thin bone layer remains. Evaluations of CT scans for clinical application are typically observer based. METHODS We developed a method of objectively evaluating the resolution of CT scanners. We did this for 2 types of computed tomography: MSCT, and cone beam computed tomography (CBCT), which have been reported to have a higher resolution for temporal bone scans. For the evaluation and comparison of image accuracy between different CT scanners and protocols, we built a bone cement phantom containing small, well-defined structural defects (diameter, 0.1-0.4 mm). These small inhomogeneities could reliably be detected by comparing the variances of radiodensities of a region of interest (i.e., a region containing a hole) with a homogenous region. The Fligner-Killeen test was used to predict the presence or absence of a hole (p ≥ 0.05). For our second goal, that is, to see how this technique could be applied to the detection of a possible dehiscence in a SC, a cadaveric head specimen was used to create an anatomic model for a borderline SCD; the SC was drilled to the point of translucency. After semi-automatically fitting the location of the canal, our variance-based approach allowed a clear, significant detection of the thin remaining bone layer. RESULTS Our approach of statistical noise analysis on bone cement phantoms allowed us to distinguish real irregularities from measured image noise or reconstruction errors. We have shown that with computed tomography, an approach comparing radiodensity variance in regions of interest is capable of detecting inhomogeneities down to 0.1 mm (p ≤ 0.0001). CONCLUSION Our analysis of data from the cadaveric head specimen demonstrates that this approach can be used to objectively detect thin layers of bone overlying an SC. This should provide the basis for using this approach for a semi-automated, objective detection of SCD.","Eibenberger, Karin; Carey, John; Ehtiati, Tina; Trevino, Carolina; Dolberg, James; Haslwanter, Thomas","Otology & neurotology : official publication of the American Otological Society, American Neurotology Society [and] European Academy of Otology and Neurotology",https://doi.org/10.1097/mao.0000000000000199; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24448293/,114
65493,Intermediate clinical endpoints in localised prostate cancer.,2021-03-01,"The aim of this study was to determine if there is a difference in 6-min walk test (6MWT) distance when the assessor accompanies the patient to continuously measure peripheral oxygen saturation (S pO2 ) compared to the patient walking unaccompanied. We conducted a randomised crossover study to evaluate the impact of the assessor walking with the patient during the 6MWT (6MWTwith) versus the patient walking alone (6MWTwithout). At the end of a pulmonary rehabilitation programme, each patient performed two 6MWTs in random order and separated by a 30-min rest. 49 patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (Global Initiative for Obstructive Lung Disease classification II-IV) were included. In a regression model adjusting for period and subject, accompanying the patient resulted in a lower walking distance (mean difference -9.1 m, 95% CI -13.9- -4.3, p=0.0004). Notably, six patients walked more than 30 m farther (minimal important difference) in one of the two conditions (6MWTwith: n=1, 6MWTwithout: n=5). There were no between-sequence-group differences in heart rate, dyspnoea, leg fatigue and S pO2 . The median (interquartile range) number and duration of S pO2 signal artefacts were high but not different between the experimental conditions (6MWTwith: 17 (4-24), 34 s (7-113 s); 6 MWTwithout: 11 (3-26), 24 s (4-62 s)). At a study population level, we observed a statistically significant difference in 6MWT distance between the two experimental conditions; however, the magnitude of difference was small and may not be clinically relevant. Nevertheless, in a clinical setting, unaccompanied walking resulted in a substantially higher walking distance in individual patients, pointing towards strictly standardised testing methodology, in particular in pre-post study designs.","Riegler, Thomas F; Frei, Anja; Haile, Sarah R; Radtke, Thomas",ERJ open research,https://doi.org/10.1183/23120541.00921-2020; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34350276/,114

The several weeks pandemic of the COVID-19 disease has forced the healthcare systems of numerous countries to adjust their resources to the care of the growing number of COVID-19 patients. Managers were presented with the challenge of protecting the healthcare workers from transmission of the disease within medical institutions, and issues concerning the physical and psychological depletion of personnel. MATERIAL AND METHODS Based on analyses of the structure and work processes in Central Clinical Hospital (CCH) reconstructive strategic plan was developed. It included: division of existing wards into observation and isolation wards; installing locks; weekly plan for supplying personal protection equipment (PPE); designating new access to the hospital and communication routes; training of medical and supporting staff. The plan was implemented from the first days of conversion of the hospital. RESULTS The wards of the CCH were converted for observation and isolation, and each one was fitted with sanitary locks. There was a big improvement in the supply of PPE for the medical staff. Separation of the 'dirty' and 'clean' parts of the CCH were attained, and widespread intensive training not only protected personnel against infections, but also diminished unrest which was discernable at the beginning of conversion. CONCLUSIONS The transformation efforts will ultimately be appraised at the end of the epidemic, but the data looks encouraging. Two weeks after conversion, the testing of hospital Staff was started and by the end of April, 459 tests were had been conducted, of which only 11 were positive.","Król, Zbigniew; Szymański, Piotr; Bochnia, Adrian; Abramowicz, Emilia; Płachta, Agnieszka; Rzepliński, Radosław; Sługocki, Mikołaj; Nowak, Błażej; Zaczyński, Artur; Kozłowski, Krzysztof; Posobkiewicz, Marek; Wierzba, Waldemar",Annals of agricultural and environmental medicine : AAEM,https://doi.org/10.26444/aaem/123801; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32588593/,114

We argue that the ambiguity between the roles and responsibilities of public and private actors involved may downplay the role (and regulation) of conflicts of interest (COI) between unhealthy commodity industries and public health. We argue that this ambiguity is not simply an artefact of the Political Declaration process, but a feature of multi-stakeholderism, which assumes that commercial actors´ interests can be aligned with the public interest. To safeguard global health governance, we recommend further empirical and conceptual research on COI and how it can be managed.","Carriedo, Angela; Lauber, Kathrin; Miller, Margaret M; Ralston, Rob",International journal of health policy and management,https://doi.org/10.34172/ijhpm.2021.113; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34523859/,114

This study was designed to determine the effect of laparoscopic splenectomy on portal haemodynamics in these patients. METHODS Patients with liver cirrhosis and portal hypertension who underwent laparoscopic splenectomy in Kyushu University Hospital from January 2006 to March 2009 were evaluated retrospectively. Correlations between splenic size and portal haemodynamics, and changes in portal haemodynamics and in levels of the vasoactive agents endothelin (ET) 1 and nitric oxide metabolites (NOx) before and 7-10 days after laparoscopic splenectomy were analysed. RESULTS Portal venous (PV) blood flow, PV cross-sectional area and PV congestion index correlated significantly with splenic size (P < 0·050). All three were significantly reduced following splenectomy in 59 patients. The hepatic venous pressure gradient, measured in 18 patients, decreased by 25 per cent after splenectomy (P < 0·001). Portal vascular resistance was also reduced, by 21 per cent (P = 0·009). The peripheral blood concentration of ET-1 decreased from 2·95 to 2·11 pg/ml (P < 0·001), and that of NOx tended to decrease (from 29·2 to 25·0 pg/ml; P = 0·068). In hepatic venous blood, the level of ET-1 decreased from 2·37 to 1·83 pg/ml (P = 0·006), whereas NOx concentration tended to increase (from 24·5 to 30·9 pg/ml; P = 0·067). CONCLUSION In patients with liver cirrhosis and portal hypertension, splenectomy reduced portal venous pressure. A decrease in splanchnic blood flow, by eliminating splenic blood flow, and reduction in intrahepatic vascular resistance, by normalizing hepatic concentrations of ET-1 and NOx, may both have contributed.","Kawanaka, H; Akahoshi, T; Kinjo, N; Iguchi, T; Ninomiya, M; Yamashita, Y-I; Ikegami, T; Yoshizumi, T; Shirabe, K; Maehara, Y",The British journal of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1002/bjs.9622; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25200126/,114
66543,The burden of lung disease in Hong Kong: a report from the Hong Kong Thoracic Society.,2008,"BACKGROUND Persons with multiple sclerosis (MS) take their treatment via pills, injections or infusions. A novel mode of disease-modifying treatment administration, an implantable device, is under development. This study determined MS patient preferences for three modes of first-line treatment administration (implant, pills, injectables), and trade-offs regarding treatment characteristics. METHODS A survey including a discrete choice experiment was conducted among MS patients in the Netherlands, France, and the United Kingdom. Respondents had to repeatedly choose between various treatment scenarios with four treatment characteristics: risk of relapse, reduction of disease progression, risk of side effects and mode of administration. Data was analysed using a panel latent class logit model. RESULTS Based on the preferences of 753 MS patients (response rate 7%: 753/11202), two latent classes were identified (class probability of 74% vs 26%). Persons with relapsing-remitting MS and who administered medication via injections generally preferred any treatment over no treatment. Patients who could walk without an aid were more likely to prefer no treatment. Reducing disease progression was the most important treatment characteristic class 1. Mode of administration was the most important characteristic in class 2. Patients were willing to accept an increase in risk of relapse and disease progression to get their treatment via an implant rather than injections. Predicted uptake was the highest for the implant, followed by pills, injections, and no treatment. CONCLUSION We found that a drug-delivery implant could be a potential addition to the MS treatment landscape: MS patients are willing to trade-off risk of relapse and disease progression for an implant, and predicted uptake for an implant is relatively high.","Visser, L A; Huls, S P I; Uyl-de Groot, C A; de Bekker-Grob, E W; Redekop, W K",Journal of the neurological sciences,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jns.2021.117587; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34364148/,114

In contrast, chronic pain is a debilitating condition without any obvious physiological function. The transition to, and the maintenance of chronic pain require new gene expression to support biochemical and structural changes within the pain pathway. The regulation of gene expression at the level of mRNA translation has emerged as an important step in the control of protein expression in the cell. Recent studies show that signaling pathways upstream of mRNA translation, such as mTORC1 and ERK, are upregulated in chronic pain conditions, and their inhibition effectively alleviates pain in several animal models. Despite this progress, mRNAs whose translation is altered in chronic pain conditions remain largely unknown. Here, we performed genome-wide translational profiling of dorsal root ganglion (DRG) and spinal cord dorsal horn tissues in a mouse model of neuropathic pain, spared nerve injury (SNI), using the ribosome profiling technique. We identified distinct subsets of mRNAs that are differentially translated in response to nerve injury in both tissues. We discovered key converging upstream regulators and pathways linked to mRNA translational control and neuropathic pain. Our data are crucial for the understanding of mechanisms by which mRNA translation promotes persistent hypersensitivity after nerve injury.","Uttam, Sonali; Wong, Calvin; Amorim, Inês S; Jafarnejad, Seyed Mehdi; Tansley, Shannon N; Yang, Jieyi; Prager-Khoutorsky, Masha; Mogil, Jeffrey S; Gkogkas, Christos G; Khoutorsky, Arkady",Neurobiology of pain,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ynpai.2018.04.001; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30906902/,114

Since the initiation of three-dimensional (3D) systems, studies have failed to prove significant advantages over traditional two-dimensional systems which could be attributed to suboptimal image quality, poor illumination and high cost of earlier systems. Recent advances in stereoscopy have led to the introduction of high-definition (HD) systems with improvement in image quality in both two-dimensional and 3D systems. With HD and new 4K imaging system, the previous data are now obsolete. METHODS We devised a cross-over study using the Olympus 4K camera imaging system compared with the HD 3D systems using 40 novice surgeons with no prior surgical skills to perform standardized surgical tasks and the groups were crossed over to assess any difference in the learning curve with the imaging systems. RESULTS The data showed a statistically significant difference in errors performed with the 3D imaging system with reduction in errors for passing needle through a ring, knot tying, cutting circle and touching circles with a needle. The time taken to perform those tasks was comparable except in knot tying where there was significant reduction in the time taken to tie knots with a P-value of <0.001 in both groups. CONCLUSION The study showed no significant difference in the time to perform tasks.

We performed this prospective cohort study in non-elective paediatric surgery to assess whether gastric ultrasound may help to determine the best anaesthetic induction technique, whether rapid sequence or routine. The primary outcome was the reduction of inappropriate induction technique. A pre-operative clinical assessment was performed by the attending anaesthetist who made a provisional plan for induction. Gastric ultrasound was performed in the semirecumbent and right lateral decubitus positions for a qualitative assessment of gastric contents, using a 0-2 grading scale. A final induction plan was made based on this assessment. Immediately after tracheal intubation, gastric contents were suctioned through a multi-orifice nasogastric tube; these were defined as above risk threshold for regurgitation and aspiration if there was clear fluid > 0.8 ml.kg-1 , and/or the presence of thick fluid and/or solid particles. Gastric ultrasound was feasible in 130 out of 143 (90%) of children, and led to a change in the planned induction technique in 67 patients: 30 from routine to rapid sequence, and 37 from rapid sequence to routine. An appropriate induction technique was therefore performed in 85% of children, vs. 49% planned after pre-operative clinical assessment alone (p < 0.00001). Our results suggest that gastric ultrasound is a useful guide to the general anaesthetic induction technique with respect to the risk of pulmonary aspiration, in comparison with pre-operative clinical assessment alone.","Gagey, A-C; de Queiroz Siqueira, M; Monard, C; Combet, S; Cogniat, B; Desgranges, F-P; Robinson, P; Chassard, D; Bouvet, L",Anaesthesia,https://doi.org/10.1111/anae.14179; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29265174/,114

Subsequently, we conducted meta-analyses for each outcome. We report the results of the fixed, as well as the random effects model. Three studies reported data on recurrent strokes. While the results did not reach statistical significance in the random effects model (despite a three times elevated risk), the fixed effects model revealed a significantly higher rate of recurrent strokes after thrombectomy. Four studies reported data on subarachnoid hemorrhage. The higher pooled rates in the intervention groups were statistically significant in both, the fixed and the random effects model. One study reported on vasospasms. We recorded 14 events in the intervention group and none in the control group.

METHODS The authors searched PubMed, Scopus, Education Full Text (EBSCOHost), and ERIC (EBSCOHost) to identify peer-reviewed publications reporting on obesity or dietetic-related curricula in dental and dental hygiene education within the last 20 years. Three studies met inclusion and exclusion criteria. Outcomes of the identified studies were abstracted and summarized independently by two investigators.

Data were collected prior to the start of the Covid-19 pandemic in the United States. METHODS Combined data were analyzed using JMP Pro version 12. Mean responses from two groups were compared using a t-test and those from more than two groups using analysis of variance. Logistic regression was used to determine the significance of impact each workload variable had on individual nurses' ability to administer medications successfully as measured by occurrence of NMs. FINDINGS The mean outcome of each of the six workload factors measured differed significantly (p < .0001) among nurses. The mean outcome for all workload factors except the hours worked was found to be significantly higher (p < .0001) for those who committed an NM compared to those who did not. At least one workload variable was observed to be significantly associated (p < .05) with the occurrence or nonoccurrence of NMs in 82.6% of the nurses in the study. CONCLUSIONS For the majority of the nurses in our study, the occurrence of an NM was significantly impacted by at least one workload variable. Because the specific variables that impact performance are different for each individual nurse, decreasing only one variable, such as patient load, will not adequately address the risk for NMs. Other variables not studied here, such as education and experience, might be associated with the occurrence of NMs. CLINICAL RELEVANCE In the majority of nurses, different workload variables increase their risk for an NM, suggesting that interventions addressing medication errors should be implemented based on the individual's risk profile.","Campbell, Amy A; Harlan, Todd; Campbell, Matt; Mulekar, Madhuri S; Wang, Bin",Journal of nursing scholarship : an official publication of Sigma Theta Tau International Honor Society of Nursing,https://doi.org/10.1111/jnu.12652; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33786985/,114

68913,Evaluating digestive neuroendocrine tumor progression and therapeutic responses in the era of targeted therapies: state of the art.,2014,"Although it was thought that children were not susceptible to 2019-nCoV in the early days of the COVID-19 infection outbreak, there are currently reports of children and even one-day-old newborns being infected by the virus and hospitalized around the world. Recognizing the symptoms of the infection in children is of great value since a large number of children are asymptomatic or have mild symptoms, which may act as facilitators of the virus transmission. This review aimed to identify and summarize the existing evidence on clinical characteristics of COVID-19 in pediatric patients. A systematic search was conducted in the PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, Google Scholar, and WHO database for eligible publications. The review proposal was registered with the PROSPERO. The quality assessment was done based on JBI Critical appraisal tools. The random-effects model was used to pool clinical features in the meta-analysis. From the identiﬁed 256 potentially relevant studies, 32 articles met the predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Twenty-one studies fulfilled the criteria for this meta-analysis. Fever (58%) and cough (48%) were reported as the most common symptoms of infected children. Disease severity was mild in 51% and moderate in 39% of cases. A total of 63% of cases had respiratory and 25% of children had gastrointestinal symptoms, particularly diarrhea and nausea/vomiting. Approximately 24% of patients were asymptomatic. Results demonstrated that fever and cough were the most common symptoms of COVID-19-infected children and the majority of cases had mild-to-moderate disease severity.","Taheri, Leila; Gheiasi, Seyede Fatemeh; Taher, Mohammad; Basirinezhad, Mohammad Hasan; Shaikh, Zulfiqar Ali; Dehghan Nayeri, Nahid",Comprehensive child and adolescent nursing,https://doi.org/10.1080/24694193.2021.1930288; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34125643/,114
68980,Society of pediatric nurses: A year in review.,2020-12-03,"BACKGROUND Jejunostomy tubes (JT) are routinely placed at the time of esophagectomy and can be associated with low--but not insignificant--morbidity. Increased emphasis on evidence-based medicine prompted this critical review of JT use during esophagectomy and factors that predict the absolute need for JT. METHODS All esophagectomies performed at one tertiary care institution from 1995 through 2009 were retrospectively reviewed. Statistical analyses were performed to determine preoperative variables that would assist in selecting patients who should receive a JT. RESULTS A total of 143 JTs were placed in 151 patients undergoing esophagectomy for carcinoma (83.4%), high-grade dysplasia (13.2%), and perforation (2.6%). Of these, 110 patients (76.9%) had returned to oral intake before discharge (median, 7 days), whereas 33 patients (23.1%) still required tube feedings. Of 8 patients who did not undergo intraoperative JT placement, 6 had resumed oral intake at discharge. Two patients were discharged on total parenteral nutrition. Logistic regression analysis of preoperative variables showed a body mass index of less than 18.5 kg/m2 conferred a likelihood of requiring a JT at discharge (odds ratio, 7.56; p<0.05). Age, sex, albumin level, type of esophagectomy, histology, stage, preoperative neoadjuvant therapy, and type of cancer were not significant predictors of JT need at discharge. CONCLUSIONS The only absolute indication for JT placement after esophagectomy was a body mass index of less than 18.5 kg/m2. Other patients may have selective JT placement based on the surgeon's judgment.","Fenton, James R; Bergeron, Edward J; Coello, Michael; Welsh, Robert J; Chmielewski, Gary W",The Annals of thoracic surgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.athoracsur.2011.03.101; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21704294/,114
68992,Elective procedures for prostate cancer in the time of Covid-19: a multidisciplinary team experience.,2020-05-18,"BACKGROUND It remains controversial on the optimal timing of cholecystectomy for patients with mild acute biliary pancreatitis. This study aimed at comparing the safety, feasibility, and cost-effectiveness of early laparoscopic cholecystectomy (ELC, within 72 h after admission) versus delayed laparoscopic cholecystectomy (DLC, beyond 72 h after admission) for patients with mild acute biliary pancreatitis. METHODS We performed a systematic search in the following databases: PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane library. We only included articles from RCTs which designed to evaluate the complications, conversion to open cholecystectomy, recurrence of acute pancreatitis, the length of hospital stay, and costs between patients undergoing ELC and those undergoing DLC. We schemed to analyze data using STATA 15.0 with both the random-effects and the fixed-effect models. We computed relative risk (RR) and weighted mean difference (WMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) based on the intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis. RESULTS A total of 4 studies involving 439 (215 vs 224) patients were included. The difference of complication rate [3.3% vs 3.2%; RR 1.03 (0.35, 3.01), P = 0.961] and rate of conversion to open cholecystectomy [3.8% vs 3.3%; RR 1.13 (0.37, 3.43), P = 0.830] are insignificant between patients who underwent ELC and ones who underwent DLC. The difference of rate of recurrence of acute pancreatitis is significant between ELC and DLC (2.17% vs 8.99%; RR 0.24 (0.08-0.70), P = 0.009). ELC does not shorten the length of hospital stay (random-effects model analysis: WMD -1.09 days (-2.67, 0.48), P = 0.173; fixed-effect model analysis: WMD -0.62 days (-1.00, -0.24), P = 0.001). CONCLUSION Compared to DLC, ELC is equally safe and feasible both in complication rate and rate of conversion to open procedure, and significantly reduces the recurrence rate of acute pancreatitis.

These are the same systematic failures that have always harmed and killed the nation's most vulnerable. While everyone wishes for an end to this national tragedy, the authors believe a new normal must be defined for the post-pandemic period.In the post-pandemic period, policies that were once labeled radical and impossible will be urgent and necessary. Examples of such policies include providing universal health care, dismantling the structures that propagate racism and injustice, and reinvesting in public health. Previous research by the authors has shown that their medical student colleagues recognize that it is their responsibility to address policies that harm patients and to support reforms at the scale the authors propose. This commitment to a better future is reflected in the widespread mobilization of medical students seen across the United States. Recognizing that the old normal is unsustainable, the authors call on those who previously benefited from the status quo to instead seek a new post-pandemic normal that works for all.","Blum, James R; Feuerbach, Alec M; Fox, Jacob A; Rook, Jordan M",Academic medicine : journal of the Association of American Medical Colleges,https://doi.org/10.1097/acm.0000000000003742; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32910001/,114

70444,"The role of Interleukin-6 in the pathogenesis, prognosis and treatment of severe COVID-19.",2020-12-08,"BACKGROUND The current state of thoracoscopic technology allows less invasive surgical procedures and requires fewer ports and incisions. Totally video-assisted thoracic surgery with a single port has emerged as the least invasive thoracoscopic approach. However, uniportal video-assisted thoracic surgery brings about considerable difficulties, necessitating the development of skillful techniques as well as specific surgical devices. In such situations as dense pleural adhesion and anatomical abnormality, it may be more burdensome, necessitating the conversion to conventional multiportal video-assisted thoracic surgery or even to thoracotomy. To troubleshoot these situations, we herein propose the use of additional technique which could support to sustain the confident operative field for uniportal video-assisted thoracic surgery. This procedure also provides the same cosmetic outcomes as uniportal video-assisted thoracic surgery. CASE PRESENTATION A previously healthy, 77-year-old female was referred to our hospital, with a lung adenocarcinoma measuring 28 mm in the right upper lobe. Uniportal video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery was planned to resect the tumor. During operation, we found the incomplete interlobar fissure between the upper and the middle lobe and the abnormal lobulation of the upper lobe. Therefore, the modified marionette technique was introduced to make the procedure safer and easier. This technique proposed herein consists of employing the untethered gripping forceps to retract the lung, not requiring additional traumatic trocars. The postoperative course was uneventful and the patient `was discharged in 1 week after a modified uniportal video-assisted thoracic surgery for the right upper lobectomy. CONCLUSIONS The modified marionette technique produced sufficient operative views to attain uniportal video-assisted thoracic surgery safely in this case, rendering operative conversion unnecessary.","Yamanaka, Sumitaka; Adachi, Kensuke",Surgical case reports,https://doi.org/10.1186/s40792-019-0657-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31209676/,114

METHODS It is a prospectively cross-sectional study. The elderly aged 65 years old lived in communities executed the congregate meal service and joined the Houston-Apollo project were included. During March and July on 2020, the pharmaceutical care team of Houston-Apollo polypharmacy project interviewed old people and collected their medications by remote video. Polypharmacy situation and drug-related problems, including potentially inappropriate medications (PIMs), anticholinergic burden (ACB) and risk of sarcopaenia, were evaluated by clinical pharmacists. In addition, we analysed the categories of the prescription types between polypharmacy and non-polypharmacy users, polypharmacy users with and without PIMs or ACB. A patient-specific integrated pharmacist's note for medication education and a dear doctor letter (as needed) were generated and delivered within 2-weeks postinterviewed. Age- and sex-adjusted logistic regression model was used to evaluate the association between polypharmacy and these potential medication problems. RESULTS There were 87 older people (mean age = 75.9) and 536 long-term medications were collected. Among them, 52% were defined as polypharmacy users. Polypharmacy was significantly associated with higher risk of PIMs and ACB. The adjusted odd ratio was 5.31 (95% CI: 2.02-13.9) and 10.1 (95% CI: 3.4-29.7), respectively. Among polypharmacy users, there were nearly double the prescriptions for the nervous system and musculoskeletal system among patients with PIMs compared with those without PIMs. Besides, polypharmacy users with ACB showed higher rate of prescriptions for the nervous system and the alimentary tract and metabolism system compared with those without ACB. CONCLUSION Polypharmacy was significantly associated with negative impact of medication safety among the elderly people in rural area. A persistent remote pharmaceutical care intervention was crucial for improving this problem.","Wang, Chen-Yu; Chang, Kai-Chieh; Chuang, Chin-Ju; Chen, Yi-Pin; Hsieh, Cheng-Ying; Huang, Yung-Cheng; Chen, Li-Yu; Yang, Yi-Hsuan; Jeng, Yachung; Chen, Hsiu-Hsi; Liao, Ling-Chiao; Liou, Horng-Huei",International journal of clinical practice,https://doi.org/10.1111/ijcp.14505; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34196443/,114

70735,Risk-Benefit Comparisons Between Shorter and Longer Durations of Adjuvant Chemotherapy in High-Risk Stage II Colorectal Cancer-Reply.,2020-06-25,"Tiger frog virus (TFV), in the genus Ranavirus of the family Iridoviridae, causes high mortality of cultured tiger frog tadpoles in China. To explore the cellular entry mechanism of TFV, HepG2 cells were treated with drugs that inhibit the main endocytic pathways. We observed that TFV entry was inhibited by NH(4)Cl, chloroquine, and bafilomycin, which can all elevate the pH of acidic organelles. In contrast, TFV entry was not influenced by chlorpromazine or overexpression of a dominant-negative form of Esp15, which inhibit the assembly of clathrin-coated pits. These results suggested that TFV entry was not associated with clathrin-mediated endocytosis, but was related to the pH of acidic organelles. Subsequently, we found that endocytosis of TFV was dependent on membrane cholesterol and was inhibited by the caveolin-1 scaffolding domain peptide. Dynamin and actin were also required for TFV entry. In addition, TFV virions colocalized with the cholera toxin subunit B, indicating that TFV enters as caveola-internalized cargo into the Golgi complex. Taken together, our results demonstrated that TFV entry occurs by caveola-mediated endocytosis with a pH-dependent step. This atypical caveola-mediated endocytosis is different from the clathrin-mediated endocytosis of frog virus 3 (FV3) by BHK cells, which has been recognized as a model for iridoviruses. Thus, our work may help further the understanding of the initial steps of iridovirus infection in lower vertebrates.","Guo, Chang-Jun; Liu, Dong; Wu, Yan-Yan; Yang, Xiao-Bo; Yang, Li-Shi; Mi, Shu; Huang, Yu-Xin; Luo, Yong-Wen; Jia, Kun-Tong; Liu, Zhao-Yu; Chen, Wei-Jian; Weng, Shao-Ping; Yu, Xiao-Qiang; He, Jian-Guo",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.01500-10; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21543502/,114

Complication rates associated with surgical resection of lower extremity tumors and replacement with megaendoprostheses are high. The aim of this study was to identify risk factors that predispose to revision surgery following the use of megaimplants in curative treatment of malignant tumors of the lower extremities. METHODS this retrospective study included patients aged ≥ 18 years who underwent implantation of a megaendoprosthesis for tumors or metastatic lesions of the lower extremities between January 2010 and December 2020. Baseline characteristics and information on adjuvant treatment, hospitalization time, comorbidities, mobility, complications, and revision surgery were considered. Primary outcomes were revision surgery and reasons for revision. Secondary outcomes were in-hospital complications and the duration of hospitalization. RESULTS Fifty-four patients (48% female, age 63 years, SD 15) were available for final analysis. Surgeries were performed at hip level in 37 patients (68.5%) and at knee level in 17 patients (31.5%). Revision for wound-related causes was performed in 12 cases (22.2%), with microbiological proof of infection in 8 cases (14.8%). Revision for hip joint instability was carried out in 4 cases (7.4%) and for disconnection between components of the megaimplant in 2 cases (3.7%). Those patients requiring a wound-related revision had undergone a longer primary surgical intervention than those who required an implant-related revision (276 vs 134 min, p = .002). Wound drains after the primary implantation remained longer in situ in patients who later required revision surgery for wound-related complications (5 vs 3 days, p = .020). An ASA > 3 was associated with an increased likelihood for in-hospital complications in general (p = .041), and in-hospital death in particular (p = .012). CONCLUSIONS The management of malignant tumors of the lower extremities with megaendoprostheses is associated with a high rate of wound-related complications. Swift surgical performance and early postoperative removal of wound drains minimize the risk of complications in general and the necessity of revision surgery in particular. Patients with more comorbidities were more likely to suffer in-hospital complications.","von Salis-Soglio, Moritz; Ghanem, Mohamed; Lycke, Christian; Roth, Andreas; Osterhoff, Georg",Journal of orthopaedic surgery and research,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13018-021-02654-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34407838/,114

72712,Tor Vergata University-Hospital in the Beginning of COVID-19-Era: Experience and Recommendation for Breast Cancer Patients.,2020-06-01,"In the current pandemic situation raised due to COVID-19, drug reuse is emerging as the first line of treatment. The viral agent that causes this highly contagious disease and the acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) share high nucleotide similarity. Therefore, it is structurally expected that many existing viral targets are similar to the first SARS-CoV, probably being inhibited by the same compounds. Here, we selected two viral proteins based on their vital role in the viral life cycle: Structure of the main protease SARS-CoV-2 and the structural base of the SARS-CoV-2 protease 3CL, both supporting the entry of the virus into the human host. The approved drugs used were azithromycin, ritonavir, lopinavir, oseltamivir, ivermectin and heparin, which are emerging as promising agents in the fight against COVID-19. Our hypothesis behind molecular coupling studies is to determine the binding affinities of these drugs and to identify the main amino acid residues that play a fundamental role in their mechanism of action. Additional studies on a wide range of FDA-approved drugs, including a few more protein targets, molecular dynamics studies, in vitro and biological in vivo evaluation are needed to identify combination therapy targeted at various stages of the viral life cycle. In our experiment in silico, based mainly on the molecular coupling approach, we investigated six different types of pharmacologically active drugs, aiming at their potential application alone or in combination with the reuse of drugs. The ligands showed stable conformations when analyzing the affinity energy in both proteases: ivermectin forming a stable complex with the two proteases with values -8.727 kcal/mol for Main Protease and -9.784 kcal/mol for protease 3CL, Heparin with values of -7.647 kcal/mol for the Main protease and -7.737 kcal/mol for the 3CL protease. Both conform to the catalytic site of the proteases. Our studies can provide an insight into the possible interactions between ligands and receptors, through better conformation. The ligands ivermectin, heparin and ritonavir showed stable conformations. Our in-silica docking data shows that the drugs we have identified can bind to the binding compartment of both proteases, this strongly supports our hypothesis that the development of a single antiviral agent targeting Main protease, or 3CL protease, or an agent used in combination with other potential therapies, it could provide an effective line of defense against diseases associated with coronaviruses.","Arouche, Tiago da Silva; Martins, Anderson Yuri; Ramalho, Teodorico de Castro; Júnior, Raul Nunes Carvalho; Costa, Fabio Luiz Paranhos; Filho, Tarciso Silva de Andrade; Neto, Antonio Maia Jesus Chaves",Journal of nanoscience and nanotechnology,https://doi.org/10.1166/jnn.2021.19029; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33500022/,114
73003,Audio Interview: Efficacy of Current Covid-19 Vaccines against Variant Viruses.,2021-03-18,"BACKGROUND Breast milk composition has been reported to vary significantly between individual women and between different populations. However, the composition is also known to vary within the same woman between different days, within the same day, and even across the same feed. Therefore, it is unclear to what extent variations in composition are due to variations in sampling methodology between studies. The purpose of this systematic review is to compare the results obtained for breast milk macronutrient composition between studies utilizing different sampling methodologies and to use this as a basis to determine the most robust and consistent sampling approach as an alternative to full expression (gold standard). METHODS The EMBASE, MEDLINE/PubMed, Cochrane Library, Scopus, Web of Science, and ProQuest Dissertations and Theses Global databases will be searched for relevant articles. Observational studies, including cross-sectional, comparative cohort, and longitudinal cohort studies which involve lactating women who are breastfeeding (exclusively or not) or expressing (manually or using a breast pump) at any lactation stage will be included. This review will compare different methods of breast milk collection used in research studies which report macronutrient levels (protein, fat, lactose). Two review authors will independently screen titles and abstracts of studies identified by the literature search to determine articles for the full text screening. Quality assessment of included articles will be conducted independently by two review authors using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale. DISCUSSION It is important to identify the most reliable and practical method of human milk collection which best represents the average composition of the milk that is being consumed by the infant. This systematic review will be critical for ensuring that we determine a robust and consistent sampling approach to use in future studies of evaluating breast milk composition in a larger population. Identifying a recommended standard collection protocol will also provide more opportunities for sharing and combining data from different research groups, thus enhancing replicability and knowledge in the field.

73004,"Popliteal vessel injuries: complex anatomy, difficult problems and surgical challenges.",2012,"Nonstructural protein 15 (Nsp15) encoded by coronavirus (CoV) is a nidoviral uridylate-specific endoribonuclease (NendoU) that plays an essential role in the life cycle of the virus. Structural information on this crucial protein from the Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV), which is lethally pathogenic and has caused severe respiratory diseases worldwide, is lacking. Here, we determined the crystal structure of MERS-CoV Nsp15 at a 2.7-Å resolution and performed the relevant biochemical assays to study how NendoU activity is regulated. Although the overall structure is conserved, MERS-CoV Nsp15 shows unique and novel features compared to its homologs. Serine substitution of residue F285, which harbors an aromatic side chain that disturbs RNA binding compared with that of other homologs, increases catalytic activity. Mutations of residues residing on the oligomerization interfaces that distort hexamerization, namely, N38A, Y58A, and N157A, decrease thermostability, decrease affinity of binding with RNA, and reduce the NendoU activity of Nsp15. In contrast, mutant D39A exhibits increased activity and a higher substrate binding capacity. Importantly, Nsp8 was found to interact with both monomeric and hexameric Nsp15. The Nsp7/Nsp8 complex displays a higher binding affinity for Nsp15. Furthermore, Nsp8 and the Nsp7/Nsp8 complex also enhance the NendoU activity of hexameric Nsp15 in vitro Taking the findings together, this work first provides evidence on how the activity of Nsp15 may be functionally mediated by catalytic residues, oligomeric assembly, RNA binding efficiency, or the possible association with other nonstructural proteins.IMPORTANCE The lethally pathogenic Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) pose serious threats to humans. Endoribonuclease Nsp15 encoded by coronavirus plays an important role in viral infection and pathogenesis. This study determines the structure of MERS-CoV Nsp15 and demonstrates how the catalytic activity of this protein is potentially mediated, thereby providing structural and functional evidence for developing antiviral drugs. We also hypothesize that the primase-like protein Nsp8 and the Nsp7/Nsp8 complex may interact with Nsp15 and affect enzymatic activity. This contributes to the understanding of the association of Nsp15 with the viral replication and transcription machinery.","Zhang, Lianqi; Li, Lei; Yan, Liming; Ming, Zhenhua; Jia, Zhihui; Lou, Zhiyong; Rao, Zihe",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00893-18; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30135128/,114
73279,Choice and management of vascular access in the context of COVID-19 outbreak in Italy: Recommendations from clinical practice.,2020-11-16,"Ubiquitination is a critical regulator of the host immune response to viral infection, and many viruses, including coronaviruses, encode proteins that target the ubiquitination system. To explore the link between coronavirus infection and the ubiquitin system, we asked whether protein degradation by the 26S proteasome plays a role in severe coronavirus infections using a murine model of SARS-like pneumonitis induced by murine hepatitis virus strain 1 (MHV-1). In vitro, the pretreatment of peritoneal macrophages with inhibitors of the proteasome (pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate [PDTC], MG132, and PS-341) markedly inhibited MHV-1 replication at an early step in its replication cycle, as evidenced by inhibition of viral RNA production. Proteasome inhibition also blocked viral cytotoxicity in macrophages, as well as the induction of inflammatory mediators such as IP-10, gamma interferon (IFN-γ), and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1). In vivo, intranasal inoculation of MHV-1 results in a lethal pneumonitis in A/J mice. Treatment of A/J mice with the proteasome inhibitor PDTC, MG132, or PS-341 led to 40% survival (P < 0.01), with a concomitant improvement of lung histology, reduced pulmonary viral replication, decreased pulmonary STAT phosphorylation, and reduced pulmonary inflammatory cytokine expression. These data demonstrate that inhibition of the cellular proteasome attenuates pneumonitis and cytokine gene expression in vivo by reducing MHV-1 replication and the resulting inflammatory response. The results further suggest that targeting the proteasome may be an effective new treatment for severe coronavirus infections.","Ma, Xue-Zhong; Bartczak, Agata; Zhang, Jianhua; Khattar, Ramzi; Chen, Limin; Liu, Ming Feng; Edwards, Aled; Levy, Gary; McGilvray, Ian D",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.01219-10; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20861244/,114
73405,Wrong but Useful - What Covid-19 Epidemiologic Models Can and Cannot Tell Us.,2020-05-15,"OBJECTIVE Periprocedural intracranial hemorrhage secondary to intranidal flow redirection may develop after arteriovenous malformation (AVM) embolization. We hypothesized that continuous draining vein pressure monitoring may identify clinically relevant hemodynamic changes during devascularization. Our goal was to characterize the draining vein pressures in a swine rete mirabile AVM model during embolization with Onyx. METHODS An acute swine AVM model was constructed in six animals. Baseline, transoperative and final AVM area measurements were used to determine the degree of AVM embolization. Continuous video recordings were captured at 10 s intervals of active embolization. Draining vein pressure, arterial feeder pressure and heart rate were continuously monitored. RESULTS The baseline and post-embolization mean draining vein pressures were 49.8±17.2 and 33.0±11.7 mm Hg (p=0.01), mean arterial pressures were 79.8±19.4 and 79.6±25.2 mm Hg (p=0.94), mean transnidal pressures were 35.8±19.7 and 45.4±33.7 mm Hg (p=0.37) and mean heart rates were 81.1±11.9 and 83.1±12.8 bpm (p=0.38), respectively. The draining vein pressure was averaged according to the degree of AVM embolization and represented as a relative change compared with the baseline draining vein pressure, and the slopes were found to decrease in all cases (p=0.02). In half of the animals the draining vein pressure decreased progressively as the AVM was embolized. In the remaining animals the venous pressure only started to decline after the AVM had been devascularized by > 50%. CONCLUSIONS The draining vein pressure response during Onyx embolization in the swine AVM model is heterogeneous. Continuous draining vein pressure monitoring is feasible and may potentially identify clinically relevant hemodynamic changes during AVM embolization.","Haussen, Diogo C; Ashour, Ramsey; Johnson, Jeremiah N; Elhammady, Mohamed Samy; Peterson, Eric C; Cesar, Liliana; Bowie, Charles; Aziz-Sultan, Mohammad Ali",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,https://doi.org/10.1136/neurintsurg-2013-011066; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24443412/,114

Some studies report an increased frequency of severe COVID-19 in cancer patients. This review aims to describe the risk of infection and developing severe COVID-19 in cancer patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS A systematic review was carried out through an exhaustive search of literature in PubMed and Scopus until May 2020. A secondary search was performed to include more studies. RESULTS The initial search identified 2,192 records, which included 17 publications with at least 10 infected cancer patients. Also, 5 articles were added from the additional search of the references cited by those 17 publications. Ten publications were from Chinese authors. Data analysis showed that COVID-19 infection is more frequent in cancer patients, and frequent therapeutic visits to the healthcare facility may be the cause. The presence of neoplasia predisposed patients to develop severe disease. Advanced age, associated comorbidities, advanced malignancy, and the presence of serum inflammatory markers increased the risk of developing severe disease. Initial studies indicate that the use of systemic treatment may also be a predisposing factor. CONCLUSIONS The risk of becoming infected by COVID-19 and developing severe disease is higher in the oncological population.","Castañeda, Carlos A; Castillo, Miluska; Rojas-Vilca, José Luis; Fuentes, Hugo; Gómez, Henry L",Revista peruana de medicina experimental y salud publica,https://doi.org/10.17843/rpmesp.2020.374.5976; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33566899/,114
73901,Differences in Lifetime Earning Potential for Pediatric Subspecialists.,2021-03-08,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Acute ischemic stroke caused by primary multivessel occlusions (pMVO) is a rare but devastating disease. Whether multi-target mechanical thrombectomy for pMVO is beneficial remains unknown. METHODS Multicenter retrospective review of patients treated with multi-target mechanical thrombectomy. The following pMVO sites were included: basilar artery, internal carotid artery, and middle cerebral artery (M1 and M2). Baseline characteristics were reported together with interventional technique, technical efficacy, and safety parameters. Clinical outcomes were evaluated applying the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale and modified Rankin Scale. A systematic literature review was performed to summarize previous reports on pMVO mechanical thrombectomy. RESULTS Of 6081 patients screened, 21 patients met the inclusion criteria (0.35% [95% CI, 0.23%-0.53%]). In 70% (14/20) a cardioembolic cause was reported. A successful reperfusion of Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction scale score ≥2b was achieved in 95.2% (20/21) for the first and 76.1% (16/21) for the second target vessel. In those who survived the acute hospital stay (n=10/21), median admission National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale improved from 21 (interquartile range, 13-27) to 8 (interquartile range, 2-20) at discharge (P=0.006). Mortality was 60% (12/20) at 90 days and only 20% (4/20) of patients reached modified Rankin Scale score ≤2. Acceptable outcomes were almost exclusively observed in pMVO patients presenting with at least one M2 occlusion. CONCLUSIONS Multi-target mechanical thrombectomy for pMVOs is rarely performed; however, the procedure appears to be feasible and safe with high reperfusion rates for both occlusion sites. More than half of all treated patients deceased early and favorable outcomes may only be expected for pMVO patients including at least one M2 occlusion.","Kaesmacher, Johannes; Meyer, Lukas; Styczen, Hanna; Lobsien, Donald; Seker, Fatih; Piechowiak, Eike; Tan, Benjamin Y Q; Fischer, Sebastian; Clajus, Christin; Yeo, Leonard; Papanagiotou, Panagiotis; Kastrup, Andreas; Maegerlein, Christian; Wunderlich, Silke; Möhlenbruch, Markus A; Radbruch, Alexander; Gralla, Jan; Fiehler, Jens; Maus, Volker",Stroke,https://doi.org/10.1161/strokeaha.120.029629; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32654632/,114

We examined the rural-urban differences in uptake, demand and willingness to pay (WTP) for influenza vaccination among women of childbearing age, to assess the feasibility of implementing locally produced vaccines in Vietnam. METHODS A cross-sectional study was performed in both urban and rural areas of Hanoi in 2018. Sociodemographic characteristics, history of vaccination, demand, and WTP for influenza vaccines were obtained. A multivariate logistic regression model was employed to identify the associated factors. RESULTS Of 750 participants, 29.9% had had flu shots in the current or previous flu season, 64.3% indicated demand for this vaccine. The median of the maximum amount of WTP for influenza vaccination services was US$ 8.5 (IQR: 8.5-17.0). Women living in rural areas had a significantly lower uptake, higher demand, and were willing to pay less than women in urban locations (21.1% vs 36.6%; 69% vs 60.2%; and US $8.5 vs US $11.7, respectively). For urban participants, factors associated with higher demand and WTP for flu shots included having ANC in health facilities and having been vaccinated against influenza in the past; for rural women these factors were having suffered from influenza and hearing about it . CONCLUSIONS This study informs the feasibility of implementing locally produced influenza vaccines in Vietnam. Educational programs, along with counseling services and government subsidies should be implemented to improve the coverage, demand, and WTP for the vaccine.","Thi Thanh Le, Xuan; Thi Nguyen, Hien; Thi Le, Huong; Thi Thanh Do, Toan; Huu Nguyen, Thang; Gia Vu, Linh; Tat Nguyen, Cuong; Thi Hoang, Men; Xuan Tran, Bach; Latkin, Carl A; Ho, Cyrus S H; Ho, Roger C M",Tropical medicine & international health : TM & IH,https://doi.org/10.1111/tmi.13515; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33164300/,114
74287,The Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on a stroke center in Latin America.,2020-06-26,"Introduction: In this study, we aimed to detect anxiety levels of the physicians during the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and to assess the knowledge, perspective, and willingness of the physicians about telemedicine. Materials and Methods: This was a survey study of physicians from different specialties who provided patient care during the pandemic in Turkey. A total of 824 physicians responded to questionnaire, which consisted of 5 sections: (1) demographic characteristics; (2) anxiety level; (3) knowledge; (4) perspective; and (5) willingness to use telemedicine. Results: Fifty-six percent of the participants were found to experience mild-to-severe anxiety during the pandemic. It was found that the early career physicians most likely report anxiety about COVID-19 (p = 0.012). Physicians working in training and research hospital settings had higher Beck Anxiety Inventory scores compared to their colleagues working in private health care institutions (p = 0.011). Anxiety levels of physicians were not affected by working experience, existence of comorbidities, or living conditions of the participants (p = 0.138, p = 0.317, and p = 0.123, respectively). The results showed that the participants had a low level of knowledge about telemedicine. Only 61.1% of the physicians stated that they had heard of telemedicine before. The physicians who experienced telemedicine before (N = 76, 9.2% of all the participants) were more likely to find telemedicine beneficial both in pandemic (p < 0.001) and postpandemic period (p = 0.002). Conclusion: About half of our physicians had different levels of anxiety during the pandemic, and this anxiety seemed to be more related to infecting their relatives. Participants thought that providing health care services with telemedicine during the pandemic period would be beneficial and reduce the spread of hospital-acquired COVID-19. However, there was no consensus among the participants regarding the use of telemedicine in the postpandemic period.","Demirgan, Serdar; Kargı Gemici, Ezgi; Çağatay, Melike; Altınel, Yüksel; Demirgan, Ebru Burcu; Güneyli, Hasan Cem; Sevdi, Mehmet Salih; Selcan, Ayşin",Telemedicine journal and e-health : the official journal of the American Telemedicine Association,https://doi.org/10.1089/tmj.2020.0546; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33739877/,114
74873,An unexpected cause of pericardial effusion.,2015-06-01,"OBJECTIVE To evaluate the wound complication rate in patients undergoing transumbilical single-incision laparoscopic (SIL) surgery. BACKGROUND SIL surgery claims to be less invasive than conventional laparoscopy. Small SIL series have raised concerns toward a higher wound complication rate related to the transumbilical incision. METHODS In a 44-month period, 1145 consecutive SIL procedures were included. The outcomes were assessed according to the intention-to-treat analysis principle. All procedures were followed for a minimum of 6 months postoperatively, and wound complications were recorded as bleeding, infection (superficial/deep), or hernia. Patients were classified as having a wound complication or not. For all comparisons, significance level was set at P<0.05. RESULTS Pure transumbilical SIL surgery was completed in 92.84%, and additional trocars were used in 7.16%. After a median follow-up of 22.1 (range, 7.67-41.11) months, 29 wound complications (2.53%) had occurred [bleeding 0%/infection 1.05% (superficial 0.9%/deep 0.17%)/early-onset hernia 0.09%/late-onset hernia 1.40%, respectively]. Factors associated with complications were higher patient body mass index (28.16±4.73 vs 26.40±4.68 kg/m; P=0.029), longer skin incisions (3.77±1.62 vs 2.96±1.06 cm; P=0.012), and multiport SIL versus single-port SIL (8.47% vs 2.38%; P=0.019) in complicated versus uncomplicated procedures. Furthermore, a learning curve effect was noted after 500 procedures (P=0.015). CONCLUSIONS With transumbilical SIL surgery, the incidence of wound complications is acceptable low and is further reduced once the learning curve has been passed.","Weiss, Helmut G; Brunner, Walter; Biebl, Matthias O; Schirnhofer, Jan; Pimpl, Katharina; Mittermair, Christof; Obrist, Christian; Brunner, Eberhard; Hell, Tobias",Annals of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1097/sla.0b013e31827b7818; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23426333/,114

Brazil occupies the 2nd position in numbers of infected cases and deaths, preceded only by the United States. Older adults and those with pre-existing chronic illnesses are more vulnerable to the consequences of the virus. The SARS-CoV-2 epidemic has serious consequences for health services. Therefore, an assessment of the pandemic's effect on the older Brazilian population is urgently needed. The study examines the prevalence of COVID-19 related symptoms, care-seeking, and cancellation of surgery or other scheduled medical care among a nationally representative sample of Brazilians aged 50 and over derived from the Brazilian Longitudinal Study of Aging (ELSI-Brazil) and a telephone follow-up survey (the ELSI-COVID-19 initiative) between late May and early June 2020. About 10.4% of older adults reported any fever, dry cough or difficulty breathing in the 30 days prior to the interview, with the highest prevalence in the North region (50%). Among individuals with symptoms, only 33.6% sought care. Individuals living in the South or Southeast regions were significantly less likely to seek care for COVID-19 related symptoms. Nearly one in six participants had to cancel scheduled surgery or other medical care; this proportion was higher among women, those with more education, and people with multiple chronic conditions. This paper is among the first to investigate the effect of COVID-19 on health care use in Brazil among older adults. Results highlight the need to adapt health care delivery (such as through telemedicine) to ensure the continuity of care as well as the urgent need for wide dissemination of information to guide the population on disease prevention measures and how to obtain healthcare when needed.","Macinko, James; Woolley, Natalia Oliveira; Seixas, Brayan V; Andrade, Fabiola Bof de; Lima-Costa, Maria Fernanda",Cadernos de saude publica,https://doi.org/10.1590/0102-311x00181920; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33053060/,114

However, young age is a factor of failure of conservative treatment, emphasizing the role of surgery. In our institution laparoscopic Heller's cardiomyotomy is the chosen procedure for surgical treatment. AIM To assess the outcome of surgery for achalasia treatment in children operated on in a single institution. MATERIAL AND METHODS A retrospective analysis of consecutive patient records from the years 1997 to 2014 was performed. There were 11 patients. Their mean age was 13 years, ranging from 6 to 17. Duration of symptoms was 2 to 36 months, mean 16. All 11 patients were operated on with a laparoscopic approach. Pneumatic dilatation was used both pre- and postoperatively but in no case was sufficient on its own. Collected data included patient demographics, preoperative symptoms and their duration, diagnostic findings and therapeutic means. Surgical procedures, complications and long-term follow-up were analyzed. The follow-up lasted from 1 to 10 years and finished when the patient reached 18 years of age. RESULTS Twelve laparoscopic cardiomyotomies were performed with concomitant fundoplications, 10 Toupet and 2 Dor and one redo procedure. There were no deaths. Two perforations were repaired promptly. The success rate was 82%, though with subsequent dilatations. One failure was due to serious progression of the disease. CONCLUSIONS In our opinion, laparoscopic Heller's myotomy is the procedure of choice for treating achalasia in children. Endoscopic balloon dilatation may be used as a complementary treatment, especially as a primary redo procedure.","Grabowski, Andrzej; Korlacki, Wojciech; Pasierbek, Michał; Pułtorak, Roksana; Achtelik, Filip; Ilewicz, Maciej",Przeglad gastroenterologiczny,https://doi.org/10.5114/pg.2016.64845; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28702097/,114
75851,Evaluating the Esophageal Epithelial Integrity: More Complex than it Seems.,2016,"BACKGROUND Single-incision laparoscopy (SIL) is similar to conventional laparoscopic surgery (LAP), but carries specific technical challenges due to lack of triangulation, reduced dexterity, conflicts due to inline instrumentation, and impaired visualization. This study was designed to evaluate technical skill performance of SIL versus LAP surgery in a simulated environment. METHODS We developed a modified laparoscopic skills trainer for SIL based upon the fundamentals of laparoscopic surgery (FLS) model. This includes a standard laparoscopic tower for visualization, allowing replication of the conflicts between scope and instruments. It also has a modified trainer box allowing use of different access devices and instruments for SIL. Sixteen subjects at different levels of training (novice through expert) completed four FLS tasks with standard LAP techniques. They then practiced the same tasks using SIL technique until they reached a steady state of performance. The first and last SIL trials were recorded. RESULTS Baseline SIL peg transfer was worse than FLS (254 ± 157 s vs 99 ± 27, p < 0.0002). Final SIL time was still significantly worse than FLS (173 ± 130, p < 0.02). FLS, baseline SIL, and final SIL circle cutting were not significantly different (p = 0.058). Final SIL loop ligation was significantly faster than FLS (48 ± 19 vs 70 ± 42, p < 0.05). FLS suturing was faster than SIL suturing (281 ± 188 vs. 526 ± 105, p < 0.01). There was substantial dropout due to frustration with SIL, and only two surgeons were able to successfully complete SIL suturing. CONCLUSIONS There are technical challenges with SIL that vary depending on task. Peg transfer and suturing were significantly impaired in SIL, while circle cutting was not significantly affected, and ligating loop was faster with SIL than LAP. These challenges may impact clinical outcomes of SIL and should influence training in SIL as well as future product development.","Wright, Andrew S; Khandelwal, Saurabh",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-015-4658-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26823059/,114

This study evaluates the prevalence of venous sinus stenosis and hypoplasia in the general patient population. MATERIALS AND METHODS 355 of 600 consecutive patients who underwent CT angiography of the head met the inclusion criteria. The diameters of the dural venous sinuses were recorded. Each study was evaluated by a neuroradiologist for the presence of stenoses. Univariate and multivariate statistical analyses were performed by a statistician. RESULTS The prevalence of unilateral transverse sinus stenosis or hypoplasia in a sample of patients representing the general population was 33%, the prevalence of bilateral transverse sinus stenosis was 5%, and the prevalence of unilateral stenosis with contralateral hypoplasia was 1%. A multivariate analysis identified arachnoid granulations as a predictor of stenosis (p<0.001). Gender trended toward significance (p=0.094). Race was not a significant predictor of stenosis (p=0.745). CONCLUSIONS The prevalence of bilateral transverse sinus stenosis in the general population is not trivial.

The viral 3C-like protease is solely responsible for the maturation of viral protein components. The crystal structures of the proteases were resolved at high atomic resolution. The protease was also explored by means of mutagenesis. These studies revealed the active-site amino acid residues and factors determining and affecting substrate specificity as well as the principle of architecting the protease molecule. The possible mechanism of proteolysis was also suggested.

77897,Hallucinatory palinopsia in COVID-19 induced posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome.,2020-09-07,"Tissue culture is an essential tool for the regeneration of uniform plant material. However, tissue culture conditions can be a source of abiotic stress for plants, leading to changes in the DNA sequence and methylation patterns. Despite the growing evidence on biochemical processes affected by abiotic stresses, how these altered biochemical processes affect DNA sequence and methylation patterns remains largely unknown. In this study, the methylation-sensitive Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism (metAFLP) approach was used to investigate de novo methylation, demethylation, and sequence variation in barley regenerants derived by anther culture. Additionally, we used Attenuated Total Reflectance Fourier Transform Infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy to identify the spectral features of regenerants, which were then analyzed by mediation analysis. The infrared spectrum ranges (710-690 and 1010-940 cm-1) identified as significant in the mediation analysis were most likely related to β-glucans, cellulose, and S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM). Additionally, the identified compounds participated as predictors in moderated mediation analysis, explaining the role of demethylation of CHG sites (CHG_DMV) in in vitro tissue culture-induced sequence variation, depending on the duration of tissue culture. The data demonstrate that ATR-FTIR spectroscopy is a useful tool for studying the biochemical compounds that may affect DNA methylation patterns and sequence variation, if combined with quantitative characteristics determined using metAFLP molecular markers and mediation analysis. The role of β-glucans, cellulose, and SAM in DNA methylation, and in cell wall, mitochondria, and signaling, are discussed to highlight the putative cellular mechanisms involved in sequence variation.","Bednarek, Piotr T; Zebrowski, Jacek; Orłowska, Renata",International journal of molecular sciences,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms21165770; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32796744/,114

Using polymerase chain reaction PCR-Array technology (24 ILA and 24 Ctrl, screening cohort) and reverse-transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) (57 ILA and 88 Ctr, independent validation cohort) we identified seven up-regulated miRNAs in serum of ILA compared to Ctrl (miR-193a-5p, p < 0.0001; miR-502-3p, p < 0.0001; miR-200c-3p, p = 0.003; miR-16-5p, p = 0.003; miR-21-5p, p = 0.002; miR-126-3p, p = 0.004 and miR-34a-5p, p < 0.005). Pathways regulated by these miRNAs include transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β), Wnt, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), Insulin, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling, and senescence. Receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve analysis indicated that miR-193a-5p (area under the curve AUC: 0.75) and miR-502-3p (AUC 0.71) have acceptable diagnostic value. This is the first identification of circulating miRNAs associated to ILA in respiratory asymptomatic subjects, providing potential non-invasive biomarkers and molecular targets to better understand the pathogenic mechanisms associated to ILA.","Ortiz-Quintero, Blanca; Buendía-Roldán, Ivette; Ramírez-Salazar, Eric Gustavo; Balderas-Martínez, Yalbi I; Ramírez-Rodríguez, Sandra Lizbeth; Martínez-Espinosa, Karen; Selman, Moisés",Cells,https://doi.org/10.3390/cells9061556; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32604783/,114

78451,Syncope in Patients with Cardiac Pacemakers.,2021-02-01,"BACKGROUND Preexisting cognitive impairment in surgical patients is one of the leading risk factors for adverse cognitive outcomes such as postoperative delirium and postoperative cognitive dysfunction. We developed a self-administered tablet computer application intended to assess the individual risk for adverse postoperative cognitive outcomes. This cross-sectional study aimed to establish normative data for the tool. MATERIALS AND METHODS Healthy volunteers aged 65 years and above were administered the Mini-Mental State Examination, Geriatric Depression Scale, and Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease-Neuropsychological Assessment Battery to assess cognitive health. All subjects completed the tablet computer application without assistance. Primary outcome measure was the test performance. Regression models were built for each cognitive domain score with the covariates age, sex, and education in cognitively healthy subjects. Demographically adjusted standard scores (z-scores) were computed for each subtest. RESULTS A total of 283 participants (155 women, 128 men) were included in the final analysis. Participants' age was 73.8±5.2 years (mean±SD) and their level of education was 13.6±2.9 years. Mini-Mental State Examination score was 29.2±0.9 points, Geriatric Depression Scale score was 0.4±0.7 points, and Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease-Neuropsychological Assessment Battery total score was 98.7±5.7 points. Older age was associated with poorer performance in the visual recognition task and in Trail Making Test B (P<0.05 after Bonferroni-Holm adjustments). CONCLUSIONS This study provides normative data for a novel self-administered tablet computer application that is ultimately designed to measure the individual risk for adverse postoperative cognitive outcomes in elderly patients.","Monsch, Raphael J; Burckhardt, Amélie C; Berres, Manfred; Thomann, Alessandra E; Ehrensperger, Michael M; Steiner, Luzius A; Goettel, Nicolai",Journal of neurosurgical anesthesiology,https://doi.org/10.1097/ana.0000000000000510; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29782389/,114

However, the variability of fasting blood glucose (FBG) after TJA remains unknown. We aimed to assess the fluctuation and extent of elevation of FBG following primary or revision TJA. METHODS We retrospectively evaluated the medical records of 1788 patients who underwent primary or revision TJA between 2013 and 2018. We examined FBG values collected during 6 days of the perioperative period. The findings for each time point were evaluated with descriptive statistics. Postoperative glycemic variability was assessed by the coefficient of variation (CV). RESULTS The final cohort included the medical records of 1480 patients (1417 primary and 63 revision). FBG was highest on postoperative day 1 in the primary and revision groups (P < 0.001), which had the highest number of hyperglycemic patients (FBG > 100 mg/dL), with 66.4% and 75.5% in the primary and revision groups, respectively. The CV of diabetics in the primary group, and diabetics and non-diabetics in the revision group, was higher than that of non-diabetics in the primary group. CONCLUSION Postoperative day 1 showed the highest FBG levels and proportion of patients with hyperglycemia in the perioperative period. Primary group diabetics, and revision group diabetics and non-diabetics, had higher postoperative fluctuation of FBG than primary group non-diabetics. Frequent FBG monitoring may therefore be warranted in diabetic patients undergoing TJA, and all patients undergoing revision TJA.","Ye, Yongyu; Pan, Baiqi; Gu, Minghui; Xian, Guoyan; Chen, Weishen; Zheng, Linli; Zhang, Ziji; Sheng, Puyi",Journal of orthopaedic surgery and research,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13018-020-02029-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33153464/,114

Methods: A retrospective survey was conducted by using unified questionnaire through field and telephone interviews among 129 close contacts of COVID-19 cases. The relationship of transmission was indicated by transmission chain, and the infectivity was analyzed by the contact history. Results: This cluster of COVID-19 cases occurred after a classmate party involving members in three families and work fellows in a factory (R(0)=3.8). The infection rate during the incubation period was 17.57%. On average, it was infectious three days before onset. There was significant difference in infection rate among different contact modes (χ(2)=15.10, P<0.01),There was significant difference in infection rate among single exposureswith different time length ( χ(2)=25.08, P<0.01). Conclusions: COVID-19 is highly infectious in the incubation period. The more confined the space is, the higher the risk is,and the longer the single exposure is, the higher the risk of transmission is.

In this commentary, we consider self-determination theory to explore factors that can influence intrinsic motivation to progress scholarly work. The place of extrinsic motivation is also considered, on the continuum of self-determination. COMMENTARY Using the components of self-determination theory, autonomy, mastery, and connection; academics, clinicians, and students, working in different environments, were asked to provide personal experiences and perspectives on their ability to maintain motivation during the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. Self-assessment questions were used to guide reflections. IMPLICATIONS Motivation, and in particular intrinsic motivation, can be impacted negatively during challenging times. Using a motivation framework can help identify personal factors that can be strengthened and developed over time. It is recognised that extrinsic factors are important in maintaining motivation. However, intrinsic motivation is a powerful driver to sustain and progress high quality work. Practical strategies and ideas are described to harness and develop self-motivation to pursue scholarly work, during challenging times.","Whitfield, Karen M; Dresser, Jacob D; Magoffin, Rowena; Wilby, Kyle J",Currents in pharmacy teaching & learning,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cptl.2020.10.017; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33641726/,114

DESIGN Using social media for recruitment, we partnered with a local community task force to administer a brief online survey. SETTING Residential urban community. SAMPLE Eighty-four community members, the majority of whom were white, female, college educated completed the survey. MEASURES Theory of planned behavior constructs: behavioral intentions, attitudes, perceived norms, and perceived behavioral control for 3 social distancing behaviors: maintaining a 6-foot distance, avoiding places people congregate, and staying home as much as possible. ANALYSIS Path analyses were conducted to understand significant determinants of intentions for each behavior to guide the development of locally tailored health promotion messages. RESULTS The RCBD was implemented, and results were communicated to the community within 1 week. Intentions were high across the 3 behaviors but lowest for staying home as much as possible. Younger participants had lower intentions of maintaining a 6-foot distance than older participants. For each behavior, specific recommendations for health promotion messaging emerged based on how attitudes, norms, and perceived behavioral control related to intentions. CONCLUSION In a situation where local community action is paramount for reducing coronavirus transmission, this RCBD process is feasible and useful for informing local health promotion.","Smith, Philip H; Branscum, Paul W",American journal of health promotion : AJHP,https://doi.org/10.1177/0890117120932460; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32551916/,114
79535,The EEG signal: a window on the cortical brain activity.,2012,"To assess the accuracy of infrared methodologies for daily rhythm monitoring of skin temperature, five clinically healthy Italian Saddle gelding horses, and five not pregnant and not lactating Camosciata goats, were monitored every 4 h over a 48 h period. The horses were housed in individual boxes, while the goats in two indoor pens, under natural photoperiod and natural environmental temperature. In each animal, skin temperature was recorded with the use of a digital infrared camera and a non-contact infrared thermometer, in five regions: neck, shoulder, ribs, flank and croup. Recorded values were compared with the well-established daily rhythm of rectal temperature. Rectal temperature was recorded at the same time by means of a digital thermometer. In horses, a lower value of skin temperature was recorded using the infrared thermometer for the croup region compared to shoulder and flank; a lower value of skin temperature was recorded using thermography for the croup region compared to the shoulder. In goats, a lower value of skin temperature was recorded using the infrared thermometer for the croup region compared to the flank. In both species, higher values of rectal temperature were observed, compared to the temperature recorded at the skin regions using the other two methodologies. Cosinor rhythmometry showed a daily rhythm of rectal and skin temperature recorded using both methodologies in all the examined regions. General linear model (GLM) showed statistically significant effect of breed on all rhythmic parameters; of day of monitoring on amplitude; of site of recording (rectal vs skin regions) on mesor, amplitude and acrophase; and no effect of methodologies used. The results of this study show the differences in rhythmicity of various body regions temperature and their differences in comparison with daily rhythm rectal temperature. The use of infrared methodologies was inaccurate in assessing body core temperature, but its use could be considered for the evaluation of inflammation in the different body sites.","Giannetto, Claudia; Arfuso, Francesca; Giudice, Elisabetta; Gianesella, Matteo; Fazio, Francesco; Panzera, Michele; Piccione, Giuseppe",Journal of thermal biology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtherbio.2020.102677; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32888574/,114

79736,Monoclonal Antibodies for Prevention and Treatment of COVID-19.,2020-06-15,"The spread of COVID-19 has already taken a pandemic form, affecting over 180 countries in a matter of three months. The full continuum of disease ranges from mild, self-limiting illness to severe progressive COVID-19 pneumonia, multiorgan failure, cytokine storm and death. Younger and healthy population is now getting affected than before. Possibilities of airborne and fecal oral routes of transmission has increased the concern. In the absence of any specific therapeutic agent for coronavirus infections, the most effective manner to contain this pandemic is probably the non-pharmacological interventions (NPIs). The damage due to the pandemic disease is multifaceted and crippling to economy, trade, and health of the citizens of the countries. The extent of damage in such scenarios is something that is beyond calculation by Gross Domestic Product rate or currency value of the country. Unfortunately, unlike many other diseases, we are still away from the target antiviral drug and vaccine for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) infection. The prime importance of NPIs like social distancing, staying in home, work from home, self-monitoring, public awareness, self-quarantine, etc. are constantly being emphasized by CDC, WHO, health ministries of all countries and social media houses. This is time of introspection and learning from our mistakes. Countries like China and South Korea who were initially the most hit countries could contain the disease spread by liberal testing of their population, stringent quarantine of people under investigation and isolation of the positive cases. Rest of the countries need to act urgently as well to bring an immediate halt in the community transmission.","Sahu, Kamal Kant; Mishra, Ajay Kumar; Lal, Amos",Annals of translational medicine,https://doi.org/10.21037/atm-20-2793; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32617314/,114
79866,Successful treatment of disseminated Mycobacterium simiae infection in a patient with advanced HIV.,2021-01-01,"Background The present study aimed to investigate the current situation and future trends of online academic activities for oncologists during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Methods From April 22 to May 5, 2020, a multicenter survey was conducted using an online questionnaire platform. To compare categorical variables, χ2-test, the kappa consistency analysis, and Wilcoxon rank sum test were applied. For all statistical hypotheses, P<0.05 was considered significant. Results In the present study, 2,120 oncologists participated in the survey. Of these, 2,035 respondents participated in online academic activities. During the pandemic, online academic activities significantly increased [oncologists who participated in online academic activities ≥60%: 64.58% (during the pandemic) vs. 10.90% (before the pandemic), Cohen's kappa coefficient =0.0499, P<0.001]. The findings indicated that 90.6% of respondents considered that the online academic activities would become a future trend. The main reason for the increase in online academic activities was due to in-person academic conferences and diagnoses/treatment being affected by the pandemic. Both speakers/chairs and audiences agreed that online academic activities resulted in reduced stress (61.15% vs. 67.26%, respectively; χ2=7.009, P=0.03). In the present study, 62.21% of audiences considered that the recording function of online activities was very important (score 5), while only 53.86% of the speakers had the same opinion (Z=-3.5340, P<0.001). Compared with provincial capital cities and other cities, the participants from first-tier cities thought that online academic activities required significant physical energy (χ2=6.41, P=0.040), and were more reluctant for the playback of activity contents (χ2=9.33, P=0.002) and the screenshot of activity contents (χ2=41.99, P<0.001). Conclusions During the COVID-19 pandemic, online academic activities have become the main form of academic exchanges for oncologists. Taking full advantage of online academic activities and paying adequate attention to the participants' requirements with different roles and titles, and from different cities, are key to improving the quality of and involvement in online academic activities.","Gao, Fei; Wei, Luopei; Chen, Qichen; Shang, Wen; Yang, Zhuoyu; Wen, Yan; Yan, Shida; Hu, Hanjie; Zhang, Rui; Li, Ni; Zhao, Hong",Annals of translational medicine,https://doi.org/10.21037/atm-20-5051; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33437758/,114
79953,Colonic Stool Burden a Useful Surrogate for Slow Transit Constipation as Determined by a Radiopaque Transit Study.,2019,"Lung ultrasound (LUS) is a cheap, safe and non-invasive imaging modality that can be performed at patient bed-side. However, to date LUS is not widely adopted due to lack of trained personnel required for interpreting the acquired LUS frames. In this work we propose a framework for training deep artificial neural networks for interpreting LUS, which may promote broader use of LUS. When using LUS to evaluate a patient's condition, both anatomical phenomena (e.g., the pleural line, presence of consolidations), as well as sonographic artifacts (such as A- and B-lines) are of importance. In our framework, we integrate domain knowledge into deep neural networks by inputting anatomical features and LUS artifacts in the form of additional channels containing pleural and vertical artifacts masks along with the raw LUS frames. By explicitly supplying this domain knowledge, standard off-the-shelf neural networks can be rapidly and efficiently finetuned to accomplish various tasks on LUS data, such as frame classification or semantic segmentation. Our framework allows for a unified treatment of LUS frames captured by either convex or linear probes. We evaluated our proposed framework on the task of COVID-19 severity assessment using the ICLUS dataset. In particular, we finetuned simple image classification models to predict per-frame COVID-19 severity score. We also trained a semantic segmentation model to predict per-pixel COVID-19 severity annotations. Using the combined raw LUS frames and the detected lines for both tasks, our off-the-shelf models performed better than complicated models specifically designed for these tasks, exemplifying the efficacy of our framework.","Frank, Oz; Schipper, Nir; Vaturi, Mordehay; Soldati, Gino; Smargiassi, Andrea; Inchingolo, Riccardo; Torry, Elena; Perrone, Tiziano; Mento, Federico; Demi, Libertario; Galun, Meirav; Eldar, Yonina C; Bagon, Shai",IEEE transactions on medical imaging,https://doi.org/10.1109/tmi.2021.3117246; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34606447/,114

To date, there has been no literature investigating the needs, knowledge, or implementation of osteopathic manipulative treatments (OMT) as a supportive care option in pediatric oncology. We hypothesized that pediatric oncology clinicians, caregivers, and patients have (a) limited knowledge of OMT and (b) dissatisfaction with current supportive care options and (c) would be interested in having OMT available during chemotherapy, once educated. METHODS Participants included three cohorts: (1) children aged ≥ 9 years, diagnosed with cancer and actively receiving chemotherapy; (2) their caregivers; and (3) oncology clinicians at Nationwide Children's Hospital. Participants completed 1:1 semi-structured interviews, which were audio-recorded, transcribed, and analyzed for thematic content regarding their perception of supportive care measures and views on OMT. Quantitative data was summarized descriptively. RESULTS A total of 60 participants completed the interview. Participants demonstrated limited awareness of osteopathic medicine; no participant had more than ""some"" knowledge of OMT. After education about OMT using a brief video, all clinicians, caregivers, and 95% of patients were receptive to OMT as a supportive care option. Major themes included the following: (a) patients have uncontrolled chemotherapy side effects, (b) improved supportive care options are desired, and (c) osteopathic medicine is a favorable supportive care adjunct. CONCLUSIONS Pediatric oncology clinicians, caregivers, and patients reported a need for better management of chemotherapy-associated side effects and an interest in utilizing OMT.

In the United States, while hospitals begin to increase surgical volume and tackle the backlog of cases, the specter of a ""second wave,"" with a potential vaccine months to years away, highlights the ongoing need to triage cases based upon the risk of surgical delay. We synthesize the available literature on time to surgery and its impact on outcomes along with a critical appraisal of the released triage guidelines in the United States. Methods We performed a systematic literature review using PubMed according to preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses guidelines evaluating relevant literature from the past 15 years. Results Out of 679 screened abstracts, 12 studies investigating time to surgery in lung cancer were included. In stage I-II lung cancer, delayed resection beyond 6 to 8 weeks is consistently associated with lower survival. No identified evidence justifies a 2 cm cutoff for immediate versus delayed surgery. For stage IIIa lung cancer, time to surgery greater than 6 weeks after neoadjuvant therapy is similarly associated with worse survival. For esophageal cancer, 254 abstracts were screened and 23 studies were included. Minimal literature addresses primary esophagectomy, but time to surgery over 8 weeks is associated with lower survival. In the neoadjuvant setting, longer time to surgery is associated with increased pathologic complete response, but also decreased survival. The optimal window for esophagectomy following neoadjuvant therapy is 6 to 8 weeks. Conclusions In the setting of the COVID-19 pandemic, timely resection of lung and esophageal cancer should be prioritized whenever possible based upon local resources and disease-burden.","Fligor, Scott C; Tsikis, Savas T; Wang, Sophie; Ore, Ana Sofia; Allar, Benjamin G; Whitlock, Ashlyn E; Calvillo-Ortiz, Rodrigo; Arndt, Kevin; Callery, Mark P; Gangadharan, Sidhu P",Journal of thoracic disease,https://doi.org/10.21037/jtd-20-2400; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33282365/,114
80417,Covid-19 Vaccine Injuries - Preventing Inequities in Compensation.,2021-01-20,"PURPOSE The objective was to evaluate the local treatment efficacy of transarterial ethanol ablation (TEA) as compared to radiofrequency ablation (RFA) for small hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). MATERIALS AND METHODS This was a retrospective study between January 2005 and April 2017, in which the treatment outcomes of all patients who received either percutaneous TEA or RFA for HCC tumors of size ≤ 3 cm, of Child-Pugh grade A or B, received no prior treatment other than surgical resection, were compared. For TEA, a mixture of absolute ethanol and ethiodized oil at a proportion of 1:2 by volume was administered superselectively into the tumor via a microcatheter placed at the feeding arteries. The TEA group and the RFA group consisted of 68 consecutive patients (88 treated target tumors) and 129 consecutive patients (129 tumors), respectively. RESULTS Technical success was achieved in all the target tumors in both groups. Grade 3 complication (CIRSE Classification) of prolonged fever occurred in 3 cases with multi-focal and large tumors in the TEA group. There was no statistically significant difference in complete response rate between the TEA group (84/88 or 95.5%) and the RFA group (188/195 or 96.4%) (p = 0.7). Time to progression in the TEA group [median 11.9 months, interquartile range (IQR) 5.6-18 months] was not statistically different from that in the RFA group (median 9.5 months, IQR 3.5-18.7 months) (p = 0.773). CONCLUSION TEA could be an effective alternative of RFA for the local treatment of small HCC; it is especially valuable for tumors of unfavorable location.","Yu, Simon Chun Ho; Hui, Joyce Wai Yi; Chong, Charing Ching Ning; Chu, Cheuk Man; Cheung, Sunny; Wong, John; Lee, Kit Fai",Cardiovascular and interventional radiology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00270-020-02426-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32152720/,114

The photocurrent intensity was strongest when the excitation source was polarized along the 1D chains with dichroic ratios of 4:1 and 1.2:1 for ZrS3 and TiS3, respectively. This behavior is explained by symmetry selection rules applicable to both valence and conduction band states. Symmetry selection rules are seen to be applicable to the experimental band structure, as is observed in polarization dependent nanospot angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy. Based on these band symmetry assignments, it is expected that the dichroic ratios, for both materials, will be maximized using excitation energies within 1 eV of their band gaps providing versatile polarization sensitive photodetection across the visible spectrum and into the near infrared.","Gilbert, Simeon; Yi, Hemian; Chen, Jia-Shiang; Yost, Andrew J; Dhingra, Archit; Abourahma, Jehad; Lipatov, Alexey; Avila, José; Komesu, Takashi; Sinitskii, Alexander; Asensio, Maria C; Dowben, Peter A",ACS applied materials & interfaces,https://doi.org/10.1021/acsami.0c11892; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32805799/,114

80625,Comparison of displacement of polyvinyl chloride and silicone leftsided double-lumen tubes during lateral positioning.,2019,"BACKGROUND Migration and involuntary displacement of children and young people have recently become common features of many African countries due to widespread poverty, rapid urbanization, joblessness, and instability that motivate them to seek livelihoods away from their places of origin. With limited education and skills, children become vulnerable socioeconomically, thereby exposing themselves to sexual and reproductive health (SRH) risks. METHODS Against this background, the authors undertook a scoping review of the existing literature between January and June 2019 to highlight current knowledge on SRH of African migrant and refugee children. Twenty-two studies that met the inclusion criteria were reviewed. RESULTS The results identified overcrowding and sexual exploitation of children within refugee camps where reproductive health services are often limited and underutilized. They also reveal language barriers as key obstacles towards young migrants' access to SRH information and services because local languages used to deliver these services are alien to the migrants. Further, cultural practices like genital cutting, which survived migration could have serious reproductive health implications for young migrants. A major gap identified is about SRH risk factors of unaccompanied migrant minors, which have received limited study, and calls for more quantitative and qualitative SRH studies on unaccompanied child migrants. Studies should also focus on the different dimensions of SRH challenges among child migrants differentiated by gender, documented or undocumented, within or across national borders, and within or outside refugee camps to properly inform and situate policies, keeping in mind the economic motive and spatial displacement of children as major considerations. CONCLUSION The conditions that necessitate economic-driven migration of children will continue to exist in sub-Saharan Africa. This will provide fertile grounds for child migration to continue to thrive, with diverse sexual and reproductive health risks among the child migrants. There is need for further quantitative and qualitative research on child migrants' sexual and reproductive health experiences paying special attention to their differentiation by gender, documented or undocumented, within or across national borders and within or outside refugee camps.","Kwankye, Stephen Owusu; Richter, Solina; Okeke-Ihejirika, Philomina; Gomma, Hayat; Obegu, Pamela; Salami, Bukola",Reproductive health,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12978-021-01138-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33865417/,114
80722,Combined Hookwire and Methylene Blue Localization of Pulmonary Nodules: Analysis of 74 Patients.,2018,"BACKGROUND There is wide variability in the reported incidence of perioperative thromboembolic (0-14%) and hemorrhagic (0-11%) complications after Pipeline Embolization Device (PED) procedures for cerebral aneurysm treatment, which could be partly due to differences in patient response to the P2Y12 receptor antagonist administered while the PED endothelializes. This study aims to identify an optimal pre-procedure P2Y12 reaction units (PRU) value range and determine the independent predictors of perioperative thromboembolic and hemorrhagic complications after PED procedures. METHODS We recorded patient and aneurysm characteristics, P2Y12 receptor antagonist administered, pre-procedure PRU value with VerifyNow, procedural variables and perioperative thromboembolic and hemorrhagic complications up to postoperative day 30 after PED procedures at our institution during an 8-month period. Perioperative complications were considered major if they caused a permanent disabling neurological deficit or death. Multivariate regression analysis was performed to identify independent predictors of perioperative complications in our cohort. RESULTS Forty-four patients underwent 48 PED procedures at our institution during the study period. There were eight thromboembolic and hemorrhagic perioperative complications in our cohort (16.7%), four of which were major (8.3%). A pre-procedure PRU value of <60 or >240 (p=0.02) and a technically difficult procedure (p=0.04) were independent predictors of all perioperative complications. A pre-procedure PRU value of <60 or >240 (p=0.004) and a history of hypertension (p=0.03) were independent predictors of major perioperative complications. CONCLUSIONS In our cohort, a pre-procedure PRU value of <60 or >240 was the strongest independent predictor of all and major perioperative thromboembolic and hemorrhagic complications after PED procedures.","Delgado Almandoz, Josser E; Crandall, Benjamin M; Scholz, Jill M; Fease, Jennifer L; Anderson, Ruth E; Kadkhodayan, Yasha; Tubman, David E",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,https://doi.org/10.1136/neurintsurg-2012-010582; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23314576/,114
81749,"Developing standardized titles to classify the adverse events in 7,418 cranial and spinal neurosurgical procedures.",2020-08-01,"BACKGROUND Bow hunter's syndrome is a rare cause of vertebrobasilar insufficiency arising from mechanical compression of the vertebral artery (VA) during rotation of the head. Surgical treatment usually involves direct decompression of the VA at the site of compression. We describe what is to our knowledge the first reported case of a posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA)-to-PICA in situ bypass for treatment of Bow hunter's-type ischemia in a patient with a VA dissection. CASE DESCRIPTION The patient was a 41-year-old man who developed disabling symptoms of vertebrobasilar insufficiency after trauma when he rotated his head to the right. Dynamic angiography demonstrated a chronic dissection and stasis of flow in the right VA when his head was rotated to the right, with no obvious site of focal compression. The right VA ended in the PICA and the left VA was of good caliber. A single-photon emission computed tomography study with acetazolamide challenge confirmed brainstem ischemia and poor cerebrovascular reserve. He ultimately underwent a PICA-to-PICA in situ bypass to revascularize his right PICA territory with complete symptom resolution. CONCLUSIONS The PICA-to-PICA in situ bypass is a useful option in the treatment of Bow hunter's-type ischemia in the absence of focal structural compression of the VA or VA stenosis.","Kan, Peter; Yashar, Parham; Langer, David J; Siddiqui, Adnan H; Levy, Elad I",World neurosurgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.wneu.2011.09.050; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22120571/,114
81942,Effect of remote patient management in peritoneal dialysis on hemodynamic and volume control.,2020-07-03,"OBJECTIVE Forced air warming (FAW) during general anaesthesia is a safe and effective intervention used to reduce hypothermia. The objective of this study was to determine if FAW reduces hypothermia when used for procedures performed with sedation in the cardiac catheterisation laboratory. METHODS A parallel-group randomised controlled trial was conducted. Adults receiving sedation in a cardiac catheterisation laboratory at two sites were randomised to receive FAW or usual care, which involved passive warming with heated cotton blankets. Hypothermia, defined as a temperature less than 36°C measured with a sublingual digital thermometer after procedures, was the primary outcome. Other outcomes were postprocedure temperature, shivering, thermal comfort and major complications. RESULTS A total of 140 participants were randomised. Fewer participants who received FAW were hypothermic (39/70, 56% vs 48/69, 70%, difference 14%; adjusted RR 0.75, 95% CI=0.60 to 0.94), and body temperature was 0.3°C higher (95% CI=0.1 to 0.5, p=0.004). FAW increased thermal comfort (63/70, 90% vs51/69, 74% difference 16%, RR 1.21, 95% CI=1.04 to 1.42). The incidence of shivering was similar (3/69, 4% vs 0/71 0%, difference 4%, 95% CI=-1.1 to 9.8). One patient in the control group required reintervention for bleeding. No other major complications occurred. CONCLUSION FAW reduced hypothermia and improved thermal comfort. The difference in temperature between groups was modest and less than that observed in previous studies where use of FAW decreased risk of surgical complications. Therefore, it should not be considered clinically significant.

82295,Combined systemic inflammation score (SIS) correlates with prognosis in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer receiving palliative chemotherapy.,2020-08-25,"The diverse sequences of viral populations within individual hosts are the starting material for selection and subsequent evolution of RNA viruses such as foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV). Using next-generation sequencing (NGS) performed on a Genome Analyzer platform (Illumina), this study compared the viral populations within two bovine epithelial samples (foot lesions) from a single animal with the inoculum used to initiate experimental infection. Genomic sequences were determined in duplicate sequencing runs, and the consensus sequence of the inoculum determined by NGS was identical to that previously determined using the Sanger method. However, NGS revealed the fine polymorphic substructure of the viral population, from nucleotide variants present at just below 50% frequency to those present at fractions of 1%. Some of the higher-frequency polymorphisms identified encoded changes within codons associated with heparan sulfate binding and were present in both foot lesions, revealing intermediate stages in the evolution of a tissue culture-adapted virus replicating within a mammalian host. We identified 2,622, 1,434, and 1,703 polymorphisms in the inoculum and in the two foot lesions, respectively: most of the substitutions occurred in only a small fraction of the population and represented the progeny from recent cellular replication prior to onset of any selective pressures. We estimated the upper limit for the genome-wide mutation rate of the virus within a cell to be 7.8 × 10(-4) per nucleotide. The greater depth of detection achieved by NGS demonstrates that this method is a powerful and valuable tool for the dissection of FMDV populations within hosts.","Wright, Caroline F; Morelli, Marco J; Thébaud, Gaël; Knowles, Nick J; Herzyk, Pawel; Paton, David J; Haydon, Daniel T; King, Donald P",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.01396-10; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21159860/,114
82321,Comprehensive characteristics of somatic mutations in the normal tissues of patients with cancer and existence of somatic mutant clones linked to cancer development.,2020-07-27,"While drug resistant mutations in HIV-1 are largely credited to its error prone HIV-1 RT, the time point in the infection cycle that these mutations can arise and if they appear spontaneously without selection pressures both remained enigmatic. Many HIV-1 RT mutational in vitro studies utilized reporter genes (LacZ) as a template to investigate these questions, thereby not accounting for the possible contribution of viral codon usage. To address this gap, we investigated HIV-1 RT mutation rates and biases on its own Gag, protease, and RT p66 genes in an in vitro selection pressure free system. We found rare clinical mutations with a general avoidance of crucial functional sites in the background mutations rates for Gag, protease, and RT p66 at 4.71 × 10-5, 6.03 × 10-5, and 7.09 × 10-5 mutations/bp, respectively. Gag and p66 genes showed a large number of 'A to G' mutations. Comparisons with silently mutated p66 sequences showed an increase in mutation rates (1.88 × 10-4 mutations/bp) and that 'A to G' mutations occurred in regions reminiscent of ADAR neighbor sequence preferences. Mutational free energies of the 'A to G' mutations revealed an avoidance of destabilizing effects, with the natural p66 gene codon usage providing barriers to disruptive amino acid changes. Our study demonstrates the importance of studying mutation emergence in HIV genes in a RT-PCR in vitro selection pressure free system to understand how fast drug resistance can emerge, providing transferable applications to how new viral diseases and drug resistances can emerge.","Yeo, Joshua Yi; Koh, Darius Wen-Shuo; Yap, Ping; Goh, Ghin-Ray; Gan, Samuel Ken-En",International journal of molecular sciences,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms22010370; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33396460/,114

Furthermore, it has been considered as a major challenge, which threatens human beings and affects all aspects of their life. Understanding the cellular and molecular pathophysiology of the disease is currently under the focus of investigations. Accordingly, this turns the human scientific community attention to find a solution for addressing the challenge. The development of vaccines and efficient therapeutic modality is critical. So, both primary and clinical scientists are not only trying to decipher the structure of SARS-CoV-2, but also attempting to understand the underlying molecular mechanisms that cause tissues and cell injuries. SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 are highly homologous and share a highly similar function and behavior patterns. Therefore, this might guide us toward decoding the molecular mechanisms that are behind the SARS-CoV2 pathologic effects. It is noteworthy to mention that, the undesired host immune reactions play important roles in the pathophysiology of the disease, and it also seems that, renin-angiotensin signaling (RAS) is a key contributor in this regard.

Ultrasound guidance could increase the success of performing LP. Objective To summarise the evidence on the use of ultrasound guidance versus palpation method for LP. Data sources We searched computerised databases and published indexes, registries and references identified from bibliographies of pertinent articles without any language restrictions to find studies that compared ultrasound guidance to palpation method for performing an LP. Study selection Studies were included if they were randomised or quasirandomised trials in neonates and infants that compared ultrasound guidance with palpation method for performing an LP. Data extraction and synthesis Standardised data collection tool was used for data extraction, and two reviewers independently assessed the quality of the studies. Main outcomes and measures The primary outcome was the risk of LP failure, while the risk of traumatic tap, needle redirections/reinsertions and procedure durations were secondary outcomes. Results Data from four studies and 308 participants is included in the analysis. Ultrasound imaging reduced the risk of LP failure, risk ratio of 0.58 (95% CI 0.15 to 2.28), but it was not statistically significant (p=0.44). Ultrasound imaging significantly reduced the risk of a traumatic tap risk ratio of 0.33 (95% CI 0.13 to 0.82) and p=0.02. The included studies had low to moderate quality; the studies differed based on mean age and with variability on outcome definition.

Household contacts have a high risk of infection and transmission outside the home can occur at closed and open locations. We studied the transmission risk at open environment among contacts of construction laborers. Methods Close contacts of 18 SARS-CoV-2 infected construction laborers were assessed for symptomatic or asymptomatic infection. Contacts were classified as: a) persons at residence of index case b) persons at workplace (open and closed environment), and c) persons outside the index case residence or workplace who are traceable. Relative risk of infection among contacts at different locations and observed parameters were compared between them. Results Four hundred and ninety-six contacts were assessed. The secondary transmission rate was maximum among household contacts (n=28, 43.7%) followed by contacts at closed environment at workplace (n=44, 26%), traceable other contacts (n=8, 15.7%) and contacts at open environment at workplace (n=3, 1.4%). Relative risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection among household contacts was 30.9 (CI 9.7-98.3, p<0.001) compared to open environmental work contacts and 1.68 (CI 1.15-2.44, p=0.006) compared to closed environmental work contacts. Relative risk was 18.3 (CI 5.8-58.2, P<0.001) among closed environmental work contacts compared to open environmental work contacts. One index and one secondary case died. Conclusions The low secondary transmission rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection among open environmental contacts emphasizes the fact that free air flow has the ability to dilute or probably blow away the virus particles and lowers the transmission risk substantially.","Sundar, Varun; Bhaskar, Emmanuel",Germs,https://doi.org/10.18683/germs.2021.1250; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33898351/,114

A ceiling-mounted intraoperative MRI system has several advantages compared to a conventional iMRI system. In this article, we report on first clinical experience with using such a state-of-the-art, the 1.5T iMRI system, in Europe. A total of 50 consecutive patients with intracranial tumors and vascular lesions were operated in the iMRI unit. We analyzed the patients' data, surgery preparation times, intraoperative scans, surgical time, and radicality of tumor removal. Patients' mean age was 46 years (range 8 to 77 years) and the median surgical procedure time was 5 hours (range 1 to 11 hours). The lesions included 6 low-grade gliomas, 8 grade III astrocytomas, 10 glioblastomas, 7 metastases, 7 pituitary adenomas, 2 cavernomas, 2 lymphomas, 1 cortical dysplasia, 3 aneurysms, 1 arterio-venous malformation and 1 extracranial-intracranial bypass, 1 clival chordoma, and 1 Chiari malformation. In the surgical treatment of tumor lesions, intraoperative imaging depicted tumor remnant in 29.7% of the cases, which led to a change in the intraoperative strategy. The mobile 1.5T iMRI system proved to be safe and allowed an optimal workflow in the iMRI unit. Due to the fact that the MRI scanner is moved into the operating room only for imaging, the working environment is comparable to a regular operating room.","Feigl, Guenther C; Heckl, Stefan; Kullmann, Marcel; Filip, Zoltan; Decker, Karlheinz; Klein, Jan; Ernemann, Ulrike; Tatagiba, Marcos; Velnar, Tomaz; Ritz, Rainer",Bosnian journal of basic medical sciences,https://doi.org/10.17305/bjbms.2018.3777; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30589401/,114

The hypothesis was that each suture combination studied would share a common minimum of at least 5 throws to guarantee security. Five suture materials (FiberWire [Arthrex, Inc, Naples, Florida], Monosof, Surgipro, Maxon, and Polysorb [Covidien, Mansfield, Massachusetts]) with varying suture sizes (#5, #2, 0, 2-0, and 4-0) were tied in vitro, varying the number of square knot throws (3, 4, 5, and 6). Twenty knots for each combination were statically loaded to failure in tension; whether the knot failed by fracture or slippage and the tensile strength at knot failure was determined. For the tested materials, at least 5 flat square throws should be used to confer knot security based on a binomial proportion score 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.84 to 1.0 or at least 4 throws for a 95% CI of 0.76 to 0.99. FiberWire requires 6 flat square throws per knot for security at either 95% CI level. Unless a surgeon has specific knowledge of experimental evidence that fewer throws are necessary for a specific application, the default should be a minimum of 4 throws, with 5 conferring additional security in most situations, and FiberWire requiring 6 throws.","Tidwell, John E; Kish, Vincent L; Samora, Julie B; Prud'homme, Joseph",Orthopedics,https://doi.org/10.3928/01477447-20120327-16; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22495855/,114
85148,Skewing of the B cell receptor repertoire in myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome.,2021-03-29,"In this report we propose a model in which after the herpes simplex virus (HSV) capsid docks at the nuclear pore, the tegument protein attached to the capsid must be cleaved by a serine or a cysteine protease in order for the DNA to be released into the nucleus. In support of the model are the following results. (i) Exposure of cells at the time of or before infection to l-(tosylamido-2-phenyl) ethyl chloromethyl ketone (TPCK), a serine-cysteine protease inhibitor, prevents the release of viral DNA or expression of viral genes. TPCK does not block viral gene expression after entry of viral DNA into the nucleus. (ii) The tegument protein VP1-2, the product of the U(L)36 gene, is cleaved shortly after the entry of the HSV 1 (HSV-1) virion into the cell. (iii) The proteolytic cleavage of VP1-2 does not occur in cells that are infected with HSV-1 under conditions that prevent the release of the viral DNA into the nucleus. (iv) The proteolytic cleavage of VP1-2 occurs only after the capsid is attached to the nuclear pore. Thus, TPCK prevented the release of HSV-1 DNA into the nucleus when added to medium 1 hour after infection with tsB7 at 39.5 degrees C followed by a shift down to the permissive temperature. The ts lesion maps in the U(L)36 gene. At the nonpermissive temperature, the capsids accumulate at the nuclear pore but the DNA is not released into the nucleus.","Jovasevic, Vladimir; Liang, Li; Roizman, Bernard",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.01919-07; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18216103/,114
85564,"The COVID-19 pandemonium continues: (Withdrawal of published clinical studies in Lancet and N Engl J Med, 2020).",2020-07-10,"The pro-inflammatory role of interleukin-6 (IL-6) is well-characterized. Blockade of IL-6, by Tocilizumab, is used in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and those diagnosed with cytokine storm. However, brain-produced IL-6 has recently emerged as a critical mediator of gut/adipose communication with the brain. Central nervous system (CNS) IL-6 is engaged by peripheral and central signals regulating energy homeostasis. IL-6 is critical for mediating hypophagia and weight loss effects of a GLP-1 analog, exendin-4, a clinically utilized drug. However, neuroanatomical substrates and behavioral mechanisms of brain IL-6 energy balance control remain poorly understood. We propose that the lateral hypothalamus (LH) is an IL-6-harboring brain region, key to food intake and food reward control. Microinjections of IL-6 into the LH reduced chow and palatable food intake in male rats. In contrast, female rats responded with reduced motivated behavior for sucrose, measured by the progressive ratio operant conditioning test, a behavioral mechanism previously not linked to IL-6. To test whether IL-6, produced in the LH, is necessary for ingestive and motivated behaviors, and body weight homeostasis, virogenetic knockdown by infusion of AAV-siRNA-IL6 into the LH was utilized. Attenuation of LH IL-6 resulted in a potent increase in sucrose-motivated behavior, without any effect on ingestive behavior or body weight in female rats. In contrast, the treatment did not affect any parameters measured (chow intake, sucrose-motivated behavior, locomotion, and body weight) in chow-fed males. However, when challenged with a high-fat/high-sugar diet, the male LH IL-6 knockdown rats displayed rapid weight gain and hyperphagia. Together, our data suggest that LH-produced IL-6 is necessary and sufficient for ingestive behavior and weight homeostasis in male rats.

Occupational therapy is often part of the multi-disciplinary approach within the Developmental, Individual-differences, Relationship-based (DIR) FloortimeTM Model. The model addresses the emotional development of children, which is considered to be critical for the other child developmental areas. PURPOSE. This review serves to inform practitioner decision-making about the use of this model, as no systematic reviews exist on child development outcomes. METHODS. The systematic search included Medline, Embase, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Scopus, and Cochrane. For critical appraisal, the McMaster Critical Review was utilized. FINDINGS. Nine studies were identified with varying quality levels. Outcomes were mostly reported for increased socio-emotional development. IMPLICATIONS. The evidence base for this model is emerging from a published research perspective. It is recommended that the use of this model be supported by sound clinical reasoning processes, intervention fidelity, use of valid outcome measures, and regular monitoring. Higher quality research is urgently needed to progress the research base for this intervention.","Boshoff, Kobie; Bowen, Holly; Paton, Hazel; Cameron-Smith, Sally; Graetz, Sean; Young, Alexander; Lane, Katelyn",Canadian journal of occupational therapy.

By the week of March 23, 2020, all states had mandated statewide school closures as a result of the pandemic, and the number of weekly missed breakfasts and lunches served at school reached a peak of approximately 169.6 million; this weekly estimate remained steady through the final week of April.We highlight strategies that states and school districts are using to replace these missed meals, including a case study from Maryland and the US Department of Agriculture waivers that, in many cases, have introduced flexibility to allow for innovation.

This review of reviews aimed to synthesise findings from high quality systematic reviews that examined the safety and effectiveness of cannabinoids in multiple sclerosis. We examined the outcomes of disability and disability progression, pain, spasticity, bladder function, tremor/ataxia, quality of life and adverse effects. RECENT FINDINGS We identified 11 eligible systematic reviews providing data from 32 studies, including 10 moderate to high quality RCTs. Five reviews concluded that there was sufficient evidence that cannabinoids may be effective for symptoms of pain and/or spasticity in MS. Few reviews reported conclusions for other symptoms. Recent high quality reviews find cannabinoids may have modest effects in MS for pain or spasticity. Future research should include studies with non-cannabinoid comparators; this is an important gap in the evidence.","Nielsen, Suzanne; Germanos, Rada; Weier, Megan; Pollard, John; Degenhardt, Louisa; Hall, Wayne; Buckley, Nicholas; Farrell, Michael",Current neurology and neuroscience reports,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11910-018-0814-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29442178/,114

Subsequent cytotoxicity screening revealed it to be a 2.97 µM cell growth inhibitor of the MiaPaCa-2 pancreatic cell line. This is in keeping with our hypothesis that inhibiting this interaction would have an anti-pancreatic cancer effect with S100A2, the validated PC drug target. A combination of focused library synthesis (3 libraries, 24 compounds total) and cytotoxicity screening identified a propyl alkyl diamine spacer as optimal; the nature of the terminal phenyl substituent had limited impact on observed cytotoxicity, whereas N -methylation was detrimental to activity. In total 15 human cancer cell lines were examined, with most analogues showing broad spectrum activity. Near uniform activity was observed against a panel of six pancreatic cancer cell lines: MiaPaCa-2, BxPC-3, AsPC-1, Capan-2, HPAC and PANC-1. In all cases there was good to excellent correlation between the predicted docking pose in the S100A2-p53 binding groove and the observed cytotoxicity, especially in the pancreatic cancer cell line with high endogenous S100A2 expression. This supports S100A2 as a pancreatic cancer drug target.","Sun, Jufeng; Ambrus, Joey I; Russell, Cecilia C; Baker, Jennifer R; Cossar, Peter J; Pirinen, Melanie J; Sakoff, Jennette A; Scarlett, Christopher J; McCluskey, Adam",ChemMedChem,https://doi.org/10.1002/cmdc.202000949; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34047071/,114
87010,Attenuation of post-myocardial infarction depression in rats by n-3 fatty acids or probiotics starting after the onset of reperfusion.,2013,"OBJECTIVE A number of new techniques have been developed to prevent lymphocele formation after pelvic lymphadenectomy in gynecologic cancers. We assessed whether the electrothermal bipolar vessel sealing device (EBVSD) could decrease the incidence of postoperative lymphocele secondary to pelvic lymphadenectomy. METHODS A total of 321 patients with gynecologic cancer underwent pelvic lymphadenectomy from 2005 to 2011. Pelvic lymphadenectomy without EBVSD was performed in 134 patients, and pelvic lymphadenectomy with EBVSD was performed in 187 patients. We retrospectively compared the incidence of lymphocele and symptoms between both groups. RESULTS Four to 8 weeks after operation, 108 cases of lymphocele (34%) were detected by computed tomography scan examination. The incidence of lymphocele after pelvic lymphadenectomy was 56% (75/134) in the tie ligation group, and 18% (33/187) in the EBVSD group. We found a statistically significant difference in the incidence of lymphocele between both groups (p<0.01). To detect the independent risk factor for lymphocele development, we performed multivariate analysis with logistic regression for three variables (device, number of dissected lymph nodes, and operation time). Among these variables, we found a significant difference (p<0.001) for only one device. CONCLUSION Use of the EBVSD during gynecological cancer operation is useful for preventing the development of lymphocele secondary to pelvic lymphadenectomy.","Tsuda, Naotake; Ushijima, Kimio; Kawano, Kouichiro; Takemoto, Shuji; Nishio, Shin; Sonoda, Gounosuke; Kamura, Toshiharu",Journal of gynecologic oncology,https://doi.org/10.3802/jgo.2014.25.3.229; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25045436/,114
87534,RAAS Inhibitors and Risk of Covid-19.,2020-10-27,"PURPOSE To describe our initial experience with robot-assisted ureteroureterostomy (RUU) at the proximal, middle, and distal ureter. MATERIALS AND METHODS Twelve consecutive patients underwent RUU by a single surgeon (D.D.E.) between July 2009 and November 2012. Indications included three iatrogenic injuries, two impacted stones, two ureterovaginal fistulas, two idiopathic ureteral strictures refractory to conservative treatment, one primary transitional cell carcinoma of the ureter, one colon cancer metastasis to the ureter, and one invasive endometriosis. There were two proximal, three middle, and seven distal ureteral pathologies. RESULTS Tension-free anastomosis was achieved in all 12 patients. All patients with proximal and middle ureteral pathology received concomitant downward nephropexy (DN) as a standard part of RUU. Mean age of patients at the time of surgery was 52 years (range 30-69), mean body mass index was 30.0 kg/m(2) (range 21-38), mean operative room time was 190 minutes (range 104-354), mean estimated blood loss was 181 mL (range 50-400), and mean length of excised ureter on pathologic analysis was 2.0 cm (range 1.0-4.5). There was one intraoperative complication in which liver and gallbladder laceration occurred during trocar placement. Mean length of hospital stay was 1.4 days (range 1-5), and there were no postoperative complications. Mean follow up was 10 months (range 3-36). One patient had a ureteral stricture recurrence at 7 months postoperatively that led to renal unit loss and eventual nephrectomy. CONCLUSION RUU is feasible, safe, and demonstrates good outcomes for pathologies at the proximal, middle, and distal ureter. Concomitant DN during RUU may assist in achieving a tension-free anastomosis for proximal and middle ureteral repairs.","Lee, Ziho; Llukani, Elton; Reilly, Christopher E; Mydlo, Jack H; Lee, David I; Eun, Daniel D",Journal of endourology,https://doi.org/10.1089/end.2013.0075; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23544889/,114

DESIGN AND SETTING Mastoid surgery was simulated in a dry laboratory using a plastic temporal bone, microscope and hand held drill with irrigation and suction. Comparisons of distance of droplet and bone dust contamination and surgeon contamination were made under differing conditions. Irrigation speed, use of microscope and drill burr size and type were compared. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Measurement of the distance of field contamination whilst performing simulated mastoidectomy and location of surgeon contamination. RESULTS There was a greater distance field contamination and surgeon contamination without the use of the microscope. Contamination was reduced by using a smaller drill burr and by using a diamond burr when compared to a cutting burr. The use of goggles and a face mask provided good protection for the surgeon however the microscope alone may provide sufficient protection to negate the need for goggles. CONCLUSIONS While the risks of performing mastoid surgery during the coronavirus pandemic cannot be completely removed, they can be mitigated. Such factors include using the microscope for all drilling, using smaller size drill burrs and creating a safe zone around the operating table.","Markey, Anne L; Leong, Samuel C; Vaughan, Casey",Clinical otolaryngology : official journal of ENT-UK ; official journal of Netherlands Society for Oto-Rhino-Laryngology & Cervico-Facial Surgery,https://doi.org/10.1111/coa.13725; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33533176/,114

88565,When routine bites hard….,2020-07-01,"INTRODUCTION Aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage (aSAH) is a devastating disease associated with high mortality and morbidity. The main threat to patients is delayed cerebral ischaemia (DCI). Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is a recent technology allowing continuous, non-invasive cerebral oximetry that could permit timely detection of impending DCI and appropriate intervention to improve outcomes. However, the ability of regional oxygen saturation to detect DCI, its association to the outcome, or benefits of any interventions based on NIRS data, are lacking. Our aims are to evaluate NIRS technology both as a therapeutic tool to improve outcomes in aSAH patients and as a diagnostic tool for DCI. METHODS AND ANALYSIS MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews will be searched from their inception and without language restriction. Our search strategy will cover the themes of subarachnoid haemorrhage and cerebral oximetry, without limitations regarding studied outcomes. We will identify all observational and interventional human studies of adult patients hospitalised after aSAH that were monitored using NIRS. Functional outcome measures, including the modified Rankin Scale, the Glasgow Outcome Scale and the Barthel Index, will constitute the primary outcome. The Cochrane Risk of Bias tool will be used for randomised controlled trials, the ROBINS-I tool to assess non-randomised studies of interventions and the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for cohort or case-control studies. The Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 will be applied to studies evaluating NIRS diagnostic accuracy for DCI. We will evaluate the quality of the evidence of the effect based on the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation methodology.

88612,"Association Between Leptin, Cognition, and Structural Brain Measures Among ""Early"" Middle-Aged Adults: Results from the Framingham Heart Study Third Generation Cohort.",2020-08-20,"BACKGROUND The prevalence of chronic pain conditions is growing. Low back pain was the primary cause of disability worldwide out of 156 conditions assessed between 1990 and 2016, according to the Global Burden of Disease Study. Conventional medical approaches have failed to identify effective and long-lasting approaches for the management of chronic pain, and often fail to consider the multiple domains that influence overall health and can contribute to the pain experience. Leading international organizations that focus on pain research have stated the importance of considering these other domains within holistic and multidisciplinary frameworks for treating pain. While the research behind the theoretical link between these domains and chronic pain outcomes has expanded greatly over the last decade, there have been few practical and feasible methods to implement this type of care in normal clinical practice. METHODS The purpose of this manuscript is to describe an implementation protocol that is being used to deliver a complex holistic health intervention at multiple sites within a large government health system, as part of a larger multisite trial for patients with chronic low back pain. The Move to Health program developed by the US Army Medical Command was tailored for specific application to patients with low back pain and begins by providing an empirical link between eight different health domains (that include physical, emotional, social, and psychological constructs) and chronic low back pain. Through a six-step process, a health coach leverages motivational interviewing and information from a personal health inventory to guide the patient through a series of conversations about behavioral lifestyle choices. The patient chooses which domains they want to prioritize, and the health coach helps implement the plan with the use of SMART (Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Realistic, Time-bound) goals and a series of resources for every domain, triaged from self-management to specialist referral. DISCUSSION Complex interventions described in clinical trials are often challenging to implement because they lack sufficient details. Implementation protocols can improve the ability to properly deliver trial interventions into regular clinical practice with increased fidelity. TRIAL REGISTRATION Implementation of this intervention protocol was developed for a clinical trial that was registered a priori (clinicaltrials.gov #NCT04172038).","Rhon, Daniel I; Fritz, Julie M; Greenlee, Tina A; Dry, Katie E; Mayhew, Rachel J; Laugesen, Mary C; Dragusin, Edita; Teyhen, Deydre S",Journal of translational medicine,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12967-021-03013-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34407840/,114

89316,"Cancer Nurses, Relational Care, and Science to Achieve Social Justice in Oncology.",2021,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation under systemic chemotherapy or immunosuppressive therapy is a serious complication among HBV-resolved patients. Some medications such as >2 weeks of corticosteroid therapy can influence HBV reactivation; therefore, screening tests that measure hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), hepatitis B core antibody, and hepatitis B surface antibody prior to therapy are required. Additionally, because HBV reactivation has been reported in patients positive for HBsAg treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), the prophylactic administration of nucleos(t)ide analogues prior to administering ICIs is recommended for HBsAg-positive patients. Under these circumstances, highly sensitive novel biomarkers are expected to be used for the early diagnosis of HBV reactivation. Recently, a fully automated high-sensitive HBsAg assay (detection limit: 5 mIU/mL) by Lumipulse HBsAg-HQ, with 10-fold higher sensitivity than that of conventional assays, is currently used. Furthermore, ultra-sensitive HBsAg assays employing a semi-automated immune complex transfer chemiluminescence enzyme immunoassay (ICT-CLEIA, detection limit: 0.5 mIU/mL) have been developed. Recently, a fully automated, novel high-sensitivity hepatitis B core-related antigen assay (iTACT-HBcrAg, cut-off value: 2.1 Log U/mL) has been developing and reported. The utility of ICT-CLEIA and iTACT-HBcrAg for the diagnosis of HBV reactivation appears comparable to the use of HBV DNA. In this review, we provide the latest information related to medications that influence HBV reactivation and recently developed novel biomarkers that predict and monitor HBV reactivation.

Several studies (GSE112790, GSE87630, and GSE56140) from the GEO database looking at molecular characteristics in HCC were screened and analyzed by GEO2R, which led to the identification of a total of 93 differentially expressed genes (DEGs). From the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network, we selected 13 key genes with high degree of variability in expression in HCC. Expression of three key genes (NQO1, CYP2C9, and C6) presented with poor overall survival (OS) in HCC patients by UALCAN. C6, which is a complement component, was found by ONCOMINE and TIMER to have low expression in many solid cancers including HCC. Besides, Kaplan-Meier plotter and UALCAN database analysis to access diseases prognosis suggested that low expression of C6 is significantly related to worse OS in LIHC patients, especially in advanced HCC patients. Finally, the TIMER analysis suggested that the C6 expression showed significant negative correlation with infiltrating levels of six immune cells. The somatic copy number alterations (SCNAs) of C6 were associated with CD4+ T cell infiltration in HCC. Taken together, these results together identified C6 as a potential key gene in the diagnosis and prognosis of HCC.","Mu, Di; Qin, Feng; Li, Baoshan; Zhou, Qian",BioMed research international,https://doi.org/10.1155/2020/7042124; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33083480/,114

This messaging enables the U.S. Department of Agriculture to track and respond to high-consequence animal disease outbreaks such as highly pathogenic avian influenza. Because of the lack of standardized data collection in the LIMSs used at VDLs, there is, to date, no means of summarizing VDL large data streams for multi-state and national animal health studies or for providing near-real-time tracking for hundreds of other important animal diseases in the United States that are detected routinely by VDLs. Further, VDLs are the only state and federal resources that can provide early detection and identification of endemic and emerging zoonotic diseases. Zoonotic diseases are estimated to be responsible for 2.5 billion cases of human illness and 2.7 million deaths worldwide every year.

90747,Technical Review of Developments in Endoscopic Ultrasound-Guided Hepaticogastrostomy.,2021-04-26,"During the clinical course of COVID-19, it has been observed that hepatic injury occurs in a significant proportion of patients, particularly in those with severe or critical illness. Mild increase in sinusoidal lymphocytic infiltration and multifocal hepatic necrosis are the main pathologic changes. Direct viral induced cellular injuries and potential hepatotoxicity from therapeutic drugs are two likely underlying mechanisms. In addition, preexisting chronic liver disease exacerbated during COVID-19, and COVID-19-related hyper-inflammatory reactions may contribute to liver injury as well. Further studies of additional autopsy cases will help clarifying these possibilities. This article is protected by copyright.

90832,Safety of unsedated PEG placement using transoral ultrathin endoscopy in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.,2017,"OBJECTIVE To compare the success rate, complications, and hospital length-of-stay (LOS) of three modalities of minimally invasive management of tubo-ovarian abscesses (TOA): laparoscopy, ultrasound-guided drainage and computerized tomography (CT)-guided drainage. DATA SOURCES Electronic-based search in Pubmed, EMBASE, Ovid MEDLINE, Google Scholar, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, using the following medical subject heading (MeSH) terms: ""minimally invasive surgical procedures, drainage, abscess, tubo-ovarian, ovarian diseases, and fallopian tube diseases."" METHODS OF STUDY SELECTION Of the 831 articles in the initial results, 10 studies were eligible for inclusion in our systematic review. RESULTS A total of 975 patients were included in our study; 107 (11%) had laparoscopic drainage procedures, and 406 (42%) had image-guided (US or CT) drainage of TOA. Image-guided TOA drainage had higher success rates (90 - 100%), when compared with laparoscopic drainage (89 -96%), and the use of antibiotic treatment alone (65 - 83%). Patients treated with image-guided drainage had no complications (for up to 6-months of follow-up) and shorter lengths of hospital stay (0-3 days on average) compared to laparoscopic drainage (5-12 days) or conservative management with antibiotics alone (7- 9 days). CONCLUSION Although conservative management of TOAs with antibiotics alone remains first-line, our review indicates that better outcomes in the management of TOA were achieved via minimally invasive approach compared to conservative treatment with antibiotics only. Of the minimally invasive techniques, image-guided drainage of TOAs provided the highest success rates, lowest complications, and the shortest hospital stays compared to laparoscopy. The low magnitude of evidence in the included studies, calls for further randomized trials.

90952,Endoscopy video forum.,2014,"BACKGROUND Techniques for uterus transplantation (UTx) have been developed in rodent/domestic animals towards future clinical introduction of UTx to treat uterine factor infertility. The aim of this study was to extend the UTx research into a non-human primate species by developing surgical techniques for uterus retrieval and transplantation in the baboon. METHODS Female baboons (n = 15) underwent surgery, with the initial five animals used for studies of pelvic vascular anatomy. Retrieval surgery included isolation of the ovarian veins and the uterine arteries together with the anterior branches of the internal iliacs. The utero-tubal-ovarian specimen was removed, flushed and kept ex vivo for 2 h when the two arterial ends and two venous ends were anastomosed side-to-side to construct one arterial and one venous end. These were, at auto-transplantation, anastomosed end-to-side to the external iliacs and the animals (n = 10) were evaluated concerning cyclicity and later by laparoscopy/laparotomy. RESULTS The total duration of organ retrieval, backtable preparation and transplantation was around 6 h with an overall ischaemic time of the specimen of about 3 h. One animal died due to cardiomyopathy. Five out of the nine surviving animals resumed cyclicity, as a sign of re-established ovarian function. Only two out of these five animals exhibited resumed menstruation, indicating re-established ovarian and uterine function. Laparoscopy confirmed normal-sized uteri in these two animals. CONCLUSIONS This study demonstrates the feasibility of UTx by vascular anastomosis in a non-human primate species. The low success rate demonstrates the complexity involved in UTx surgery and the need for further methodological developments.","Enskog, A; Johannesson, L; Chai, D C; Dahm-Kähler, P; Marcickiewicz, J; Nyachieo, A; Mwenda, J M; Brännström, M",Human reproduction,https://doi.org/10.1093/humrep/deq109; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20519250/,114
91401,Outcomes of COVID-19 in Patients With a History of Cancer and Comorbid Cardiovascular Disease.,2020-11-03,"Covid-19 continues to alter our way of living and dying. Much attention has focused on how to resolve pressing issues surrounding resource allocation and competing public health ethics. While these are important discussions, the legal and ethical dilemmas of treatment decisions remain highly critical. The urgency to ensure that life and death affairs are in order is magnified due to the possibility of becoming infected with Covid-19. However, many people continue to face challenges in organising their future medical care and treatment. This article explores how the pandemic affects advance care planning through the lenses of law and ethics. The range of Covid-19 implications on advance care planning demonstrates a paradigm shift from a primarily elective function to an essential role in healthcare delivery. This renewed appreciation to advance care planning offers the opportunity to support and sustain the important role that it could play during ordinary and extraordinary times.","Chan, Hui Yun",European journal of health law,https://doi.org/10.1163/15718093-bja10029; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33652389/,114
91504,"Clinical and penile Doppler outcomes using a modified, tourniquet free, Nesbit plication for severe Peyronie's disease.",2021-07-01,"Rituals may be understood broadly as stereotyped behaviours carrying symbolic meanings, which play a crucial role in defining relationships, legitimating authority, giving meaning to certain life events and stabilising social structures. Despite intense interest in the subject, and an extensive literature, relatively little attention has been given to the nature, role and function of ritual in contemporary medicine. Medicine is replete with ritualistic behaviours and imperatives, which play a crucial role in all aspects of clinical practice. Rituals play multiple, complex functions in clinical interactions and have an important role in shaping interactions, experiences and outcomes. Longstanding medical rituals have been disrupted in the wake of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Medical rituals may be evident or invisible, often overlap with or operate alongside instrumentalised practices, and play crucial roles in establishing, maintaining and guaranteeing the efficacy of clinical practices. Rituals can also inhibit progress and change, by enforcing arbitrary authority. Physicians should consider when they are undertaking a ritual practice and recognise when the exigencies of contemporary practice are affecting that ritual with or without meaning or intention. Physicians should reflect on whether aspects of their ritual interactions are undertaken on the basis of sentiment, custom or evidence-based outcomes, and whether rituals should be defended, continued in a modified fashion or even abandoned in favour of new behaviours suitable for and salient with contemporary practice in the interests of patient care.","Arnold, Mark H; Komesaroff, Paul; Kerridge, Ian",Internal medicine journal,https://doi.org/10.1111/imj.14990; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32929818/,114

While much of the calls for gerontological social work practice in response have rightfully focused on direct service provision for health care and basic needs, innovative responses from advocacy and professional organizations, as well as grassroots community groups, have demonstrated the importance of community practice in aging as well. Social work leadership in aging and communities is especially important for addressing issues of equity, inclusion, and meaningful participation across diverse stakeholder groups as local and regional authorities, as well as grassroots groups and community-based organizations, respond to the pandemic. Heightened involvement of social workers in leading place-based communities during this crucial moment has the potential to address long-standing issues within systems to support aging in place and healthy aging, especially with and on behalf of those most directly disadvantaged from multiple forms of injustice.","Pestine-Stevens, Althea; Greenfield, Emily A",Journal of gerontological social work,https://doi.org/10.1080/01634372.2020.1789258; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32635828/,114

The present needs of independent older adults suggest that health research and oral health care should shift from reductionist disease management to integral and personal treatment plans, including lifestyle, psychological, nutritional and oral health coaching approaches. Dentists and other medical professionals that work in the field of gerodontology should be educated on the macro and micronutrient needs of the elderly and incorporate certain nutritional plans early in the life of their patients with their approval and cooperation, in order to postpone tooth loss and masticatory impairment. Old recipes such as the Mediterranean diet should be kept as a base for all the elderly and be enriched in a customized interpersonal way from the dentist as well as the medical professional according to the specific needs of one's oral and general health status. In this nonsystematic review paper, the basic aspects of the vicious cycle of nutrition and oral health status are discussed and suggestions of major nutrients' influence and needs for independent elders are reported.

METHODS In total, 130 patients scheduled for elective surgery under general anesthesia lasting >120 minutes were divided into 2 groups: peri-induction warming (n = 65) and control (n = 65). Patients in the peri-induction warming group were warmed during the anesthetic induction period using a forced-air warmer set at 47°C, whereas patients in the control group were covered passively with a cotton blanket. All patients were warmed with a forced-air warmer during surgery. Body temperature was measured using a tympanic membrane thermometer in the pre- and postoperative periods and using a nasopharyngeal temperature probe during surgery. Patients were evaluated for shivering scale score, thermal comfort scale score, and satisfaction score in the post-anesthesia care unit. RESULTS The incidence rates of intraoperative and postoperative hypothermia were lower in the peri-induction warming group than in the control group (19.0% vs 57.1%, P < .001; 3.3% vs 16.9%, P = .013, respectively). Body temperature was higher in the peri-induction warming group (P < .001). However, intraoperative blood loss, as well as postoperative thermal comfort scale score, shivering scale score, and patient satisfaction score, were similar between groups. Post-anesthesia care unit duration was also similar between groups. CONCLUSIONS Peri-induction active forced air warming is an effective, simple, and convenient method to prevent inadvertent perioperative hypothermia in intraoperatively warmed patients undergoing major surgery lasting >120 minutes.","Yoo, Jae Hwa; Ok, Si Young; Kim, Sang Ho; Chung, Ji Won; Park, Sun Young; Kim, Mun Gyu; Cho, Ho Bum; Song, Sang Hoon; Cho, Chae Yeon; Oh, Hong Chul",Medicine,https://doi.org/10.1097/md.0000000000025235; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33761716/,114

This article describes the author's experience providing nursing care to a female patient who was diagnosed with COVID-19 after returning to Taiwan from overseas. During the patient's period of isolation (February 5th to February 29th, 2020), the author used Roy's adaptation model to perform first-level holistic physical, psychological, and social nursing assessments and collected health-problem information using face-to-face interviews, telephone interviews, and observations via a remote monitoring system. A second level of assessment confirmed that the problems faced by the patient included (1) existing infections related to COVID-19 and (2) anxiety related to uncertainties about disease prognosis, forgiveness from the family, and potential violations of personal privacy by the media. Due to the special nature of the isolation ward, the author used a remote physiological monitoring system to monitor the vital signs, fever, and shortness of breath status of the patient to quickly decrease her physical discomfort and to improve her self-care ability during hospitalization. Environmental cleanliness was strictly maintained to reduce the risk of cross-infection and ensure patient safety. To alleviate patient anxiety, the author established a good therapeutic interpersonal relationship with the patient by making 10-60 minutes of caring calls to her each day, by providing individual care measures, and by using the Internet to play audio and video to teach mindfulness meditation. Caring for COVID-19 cases is a completely new experience.

It is imperative to develop a prognostic tool to identify high-risk patients and assist in the formulation of treatment plans. We retrospectively collected 366 severe or critical COVID-19 patients from four centers, including 70 patients who died within 14 days (labeled as high-risk patients) since their initial CT scan and 296 who survived more than 14 days or were cured (labeled as low-risk patients). We developed a 3D densely connected convolutional neural network (termed De-COVID19-Net) to predict the probability of COVID-19 patients belonging to the high-risk or low-risk group, combining CT and clinical information. The area under the curve (AUC) and other evaluation techniques were used to assess our model. The De-COVID19-Net yielded an AUC of 0.952 (95% confidence interval, 0.928-0.977) on the training set and 0.943 (0.904-0.981) on the test set. The stratified analyses indicated that our model's performance is independent of age, sex, and with/without chronic diseases. The Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that our model could significantly categorize patients into high-risk and low-risk groups (p < 0.001). In conclusion, De-COVID19-Net can non-invasively predict whether a patient will die shortly based on the patient's initial CT scan with an impressive performance, which indicated that it could be used as a potential prognosis tool to alert high-risk patients and intervene in advance.","Meng, Lingwei; Dong, Di; Li, Liang; Niu, Meng; Bai, Yan; Wang, Meiyun; Qiu, Xiaoming; Zha, Yunfei; Tian, Jie",IEEE journal of biomedical and health informatics,https://doi.org/10.1109/jbhi.2020.3034296; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33108303/,114

To identify breed groups at risk of requiring anal sacculectomy. METHODS A retrospective review of medical records of dogs undergoing bilateral closed anal sacculectomy between 2003 and 2013. RESULTS Sixty-two dogs were included in the study of which 32·3% developed mild and self-limiting complications including 14·5% dogs that experienced postoperative defaecatory complications. No dog developed permanent faecal incontinence. Dogs less than 15 kg bodyweight were more likely to develop postoperative complications. Dogs that used gel to distend the anal sac were more likely to have postoperative complications than those that did not. Previous abscess formation, recurrent disease and pretreatment with antibiotics had no significant effect on postoperative complication rates. Cavalier King Charles spaniels and Labrador-type dogs were over-represented within this study population. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE Anal sacculectomy is a safe procedure with a relatively high rate of short-term but self-limiting, minor, postoperative complications. Smaller (<15 kg) dogs are more likely to experience postoperative complications but the risk of permanent faecal incontinence is low.","Charlesworth, T M",The Journal of small animal practice,https://doi.org/10.1111/jsap.12217; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24702484/,114

Increased measles incidence rates and considerable disease burden have been observed in under-vaccinated communities, predominantly Jewish ultraorthodox. The measles epidemic, despite proper public health handling, revealed susceptible population subgroups as well as gaps and lacking resources in the Israeli public health systems. In the COVID-19 pandemic in Israel, as of December 2020, the number of COVID-19 cases reported nationally was over 300,000 with approximately 3000 fatalities. Notably, minority groups such as the ultraorthodox Jewish community and the Arab community in Israel has been profoundly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. We believe it is still possible to implement the key lessons from the measles outbreak in Israel that could aid in the COVID-19 response in Israel and elsewhere. These conceptions should include a social-based approach, investment in public health human resources and infrastructure, tackling root causes of inequalities, emphasis on trust and solidarity, proactive communication, need for political will, and proper use of epidemiological data as a basis for decision-making.

We aimed to conduct a systematic review to assess the benefits and harms of physical activity interventions for men's bone health. METHODS We used standard methods and searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) (duration, ≥6 months) published in all languages across multiple databases and trial registries. The last search was conducted on July 22, 2020. RESULTS We included 11 studies (14 publications), resulting in a sample of N=723 men (range, 17-132 participants). We found low-certainty evidence that physical activity has little influence on the areal bone mineral density (aBMD) at the total hip (5 RCTs, N=324; mean difference [MD], 0.03 [95 confidence interval (CI), 0.01 to 0.05]) and little or no influence on the aBMD at the femoral neck (3 RCTs, N=186; MD, 0.00 [95% CI, -0.04 to 0.04]), lumbar spine (3 RCTs; N=213; MD, 0.05 [95% CI, -0.01 to 0.11]), and whole body (4 RCTs, N=203; MD, -0.00 [95% CI, -0.03 to 0.02]).

Given that patients with multiple myeloma are at increased risk of covid-19 infection and related complications, national bodies and experts around the globe have made recommendations for risk mitigation strategies for those vulnerable patients. Understandably, because of the novelty of the virus, many of the proposed risk mitigation strategies have thus far been reactionary and cannot be supported by strong evidence. In this editorial, we highlight some of the risk mitigation strategies implemented at our institutions across Canada during the first wave of covid-19, and we discuss the considerations that should be made when managing patients during the second wave and beyond.","Foley, R; Kaedbey, R; Song, K; Venner, C P; White, D; Doucette, S; Christofides, A; Reece, D E",Current oncology,https://doi.org/10.3747/co.27.7149; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33704127/,114

Sixty-three healthy adolescents (14-18 years) were assessed at the baseline (before social distancing imposition) for PAL (BL-PAL) and fitness variables; and next at the follow-up (2 months following social distancing commencement) for PAL (FU-PAL). A significant PAL decline was evidenced for the entire sample (P < .001) that was notably affected by PAL shifts among boys (P < .001) rather than girls (P = .07). Consistently, fitness variables (explosive strength, flexibility, and aerobic endurance) were positively correlated with BL-PAL and FU-PAL for boys and girls, where clearest associations were observed between baseline strength and aerobic endurance with PAL. With remarkable PAL declines among adolescents in challenging situations, like the COVID-19 pandemic, physical literacy is essential to preserve PAL.","Elnaggar, Ragab K; Alqahtani, Bader A; Mahmoud, Waleed S; Elfakharany, Mahmoud S",Asia-Pacific journal of public health,https://doi.org/10.1177/1010539520963564; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33016086/,114
95856,Autophagy and coronavirus infection - a Trojan horse or Achilles heel?,2021-01-18,"We investigate spreading and recovery of disease in a square lattice, and, in particular, emphasize the role of the initial distribution of infected patches in the network on the progression of an endemic and initiation of a recovery process, if any, due to migration of both the susceptible and infected hosts. The disease starts in the lattice with three possible initial distribution patterns of infected and infection-free sites, viz., infected core patches (ICP), infected peripheral patches (IPP), and randomly distributed infected patches (RDIP). Our results show that infection spreads monotonically in the lattice with increasing migration without showing any sign of recovery in the ICP case. In the IPP case, it follows a similar monotonic progression with increasing migration; however, a self-organized healing process starts for higher migration, leading the lattice to full recovery at a critical rate of migration. Encouragingly, for the initial RDIP arrangement, chances of recovery are much higher with a lower rate of critical migration. An eigenvalue-based semianalytical study is made to determine the critical migration rate for realizing a stable infection-free lattice. The initial fraction of infected patches and the force of infection play significant roles in the self-organized recovery. They follow an exponential law, for the RDIP case, that governs the recovery process. For the frustrating case of ICP arrangement, we propose a random rewiring of links in the lattice allowing long-distance migratory paths that effectively initiate a recovery process. Global prevalence of infection thereby declines and progressively improves with the rewiring probability that follows a power law with the critical migration and leads to the birth of emergent infection-free networks.","Saha, Suman; Mishra, Arindam; Dana, Syamal K; Hens, Chittaranjan; Bairagi, Nandadulal",Physical review.

We evaluated the factors predicting poor clinical outcome (3-month modified Rankin Scale, mRS >2) although MT performed with modern stent retrievers. METHODS We prospectively collected the clinical and imaging data of 105 consecutive anterior circulation stroke patients who underwent MT after multimodal CT imaging. Patients with occlusion of the internal carotid artery and/or middle cerebral artery up to the M2 segment were included. We recorded baseline clinical, procedural and imaging variables, technical outcome, 24-h imaging outcome and the clinical outcome. Differences between the groups were studied with appropriate statistical tests and binary logistic regression analysis. RESULTS Low cerebral blood volume Alberta stroke program early CT score (CBV-ASPECTS) was associated with poor clinical outcome (median 7 vs. 9, p = 0.01). Lower collateral score (CS) significantly predicted poor outcome in regression modelling with CS = 0 increasing the odds of poor outcome 4.4-fold compared to CS = 3 (95% CI 1.27-15.5, p = 0.02). Lower CBV-ASPECTS significantly predicted poor clinical outcome among those with moderate or severe stroke (OR 0.82, 95% CI 0.68-1, p = 0.05) or poor collateral circulation (CS 0-1, OR 0.66, 95% CI 0.48-0.90, p = 0.009) but not among those with mild strokes or good collaterals. CONCLUSIONS CBV-ASPECTS estimating infarct core is a significant predictor of poor clinical outcome among anterior circulation stroke patients treated with MT, especially in the setting of poor collateral circulation and/or moderate or severe stroke.","Protto, Sara; Pienimäki, Juha-Pekka; Seppänen, Janne; Numminen, Heikki; Sillanpää, Niko",Cardiovascular and interventional radiology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00270-016-1532-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27942925/,114

Various techniques such as pleural abrasion and pleurectomy are used to reduce the recurrence rate, but there exists no consensus among surgeons on which surgical technique offers the lowest risk of recurrence.We aimed to compare the efficiency and recurrence risk of pleural abrasion and pleurectomy methods in patients with primary spontaneous pneumothorax undergoing a wedge resection for the bulleous part of the paranchyme. MATERIALS AND METHODS Statistically compared variables between the 2 groups were age, sex, symptoms, smoking status, number of previous pneumothorax episodes, surgical indication, bleb number, estimated blood loss, intraoperative complication, duration of the surgery, conversion to open surgery, postoperative drainage amount, chest tube removal time, length of hospital stay, morbidity, mortality, duration of narcotic analgesic usage, pain according to Visual Analog Scale evaluation, follow-up period, and postoperative recurrence. RESULTS The medical records of 88 patients undergoing surgery between 2013 and 2017 were reviewed retrospectively. The pleural abrasion group was superior to the pleurectomy group in terms of operation time, drainage volume, time to drain removal, hospital stay, and Visual Analog Scale pain score on postoperative day 0. Statistically, there was no difference between the pleural abrasion group and the pleurectomy group in the recurrence rates after operation (2.0% vs. 2.5%, respectively; P=0.89). CONCLUSIONS Thoracoscopic pleural abrasion is safer than apical pleurectomy and is associated with the same pneumothorax recurrence rate.","Ocakcioglu, Ilhan; Kupeli, Mustafa","Surgical laparoscopy, endoscopy & percutaneous techniques",https://doi.org/10.1097/sle.0000000000000595; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30499890/,114

We described 7 post-COVID-19 patients, mean aged 65.7±11.9 years, referred to a Northern-Italy Rehabilitation Unit due to generalized muscle weakness. They came from specialized COVID-19 Unit after two negative SARS-CoV-2 swab tests. The 57.1% suffered from severe dyspnoea affecting activities of daily living. We noticed that almost all patients (85.7%) showed a perception of exertion, but only Case 2, that needed intensive care unit in the acute phase, presented a severe fatigue (Borg Category Ratio 10 scale=7). After the rehabilitation treatment the 71.4% showed no fatigue and the other 2 cases reported only a very light perception of exertion. This case series suggested that, starting from an adequate assessment of functional complications, a patient-tailored rehabilitation intervention should be planned for reducing fatigue and improving functioning in COVID-19 free patients.

98261,Intravenous lacosamide in clinical practice-Results from an independent registry.,2016,"PURPOSE Early detection of infectious endocarditis is challenging. For diagnosing infectious endocarditis, the revised Duke criteria are the gold standard. Evidence of endocardial involvement on echocardiography is a major criterion, but sensitivity and specificity of echocardiography are not optimal. Here we investigated the utility of (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography and computed tomography (PET/CT) to diagnose infectious endocarditis in patients with gram-positive bacteraemia. METHODS Seventy-two patients with gram-positive bacteraemia were prospectively included. Patients with a positive blood culture growing Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus species or Enterococcus species were eligible when a risk factor for developing metastatic infectious foci was present. Infectious endocarditis was defined according to the revised Duke criteria. All patients underwent (18)F-FDG PET/CT and echocardiography. (18)F-FDG uptake in or around the heart valves was evaluated independently by two nuclear medicine physicians. RESULTS Sensitivity for diagnosing infectious endocarditis with (18)F-FDG PET/CT was 39% and specificity was 93%. The positive predictive value was 64% and negative predictive value was 82%. The mortality rate in patients without infectious endocarditis and without increased (18)F-FDG uptake in or around the heart valves was 18%, and in patients without infectious endocarditis but with high (18)F-FDG uptake in or around the heart valves the mortality rate was 50% (p = 0.181). CONCLUSION (18)F-FDG PET/CT is currently not sufficiently adequate for the diagnosis of infectious endocarditis because of its low sensitivity. Improvements such as patient preparation with low carbohydrate-fat allowed diet and technical advances in the newest PET/CT scanners may increase sensitivity in future studies.","Kouijzer, Ilse J E; Vos, Fidel J; Janssen, Marcel J R; van Dijk, Arie P J; Oyen, Wim J G; Bleeker-Rovers, Chantal P",European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00259-013-2376-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23471580/,114
98267,COVID-19 will change MS care forever - Commentary.,2020-06-22,"Current infectious disease molecular tests are largely pathogen specific, requiring test selection based on the patient's symptoms. For many syndromes caused by a large number of viral, bacterial, or fungal pathogens, such as respiratory tract infections, this necessitates large panels of tests and has limited yield. In contrast, next-generation sequencing-based metagenomics can be used for unbiased detection of any expected or unexpected pathogen. However, barriers for its diagnostic implementation include incomplete understanding of analytical performance and complexity of sequence data analysis. We compared detection of known respiratory virus-positive (n= 42) and unselected (n= 67) pediatric nasopharyngeal swabs using an RNA sequencing (RNA-seq)-based metagenomics approach and Taxonomer, an ultrarapid, interactive, web-based metagenomics data analysis tool, with an FDA-cleared respiratory virus panel (RVP; GenMark eSensor). Untargeted metagenomics detected 86% of known respiratory virus infections, and additional PCR testing confirmed RVP results for only 2 (33%) of the discordant samples. In unselected samples, untargeted metagenomics had excellent agreement with the RVP (93%). In addition, untargeted metagenomics detected an additional 12 viruses that were either not targeted by the RVP or missed due to highly divergent genome sequences. Normalized viral read counts for untargeted metagenomics correlated with viral burden determined by quantitative PCR and showed high intrarun and interrun reproducibility. Partial or full-length viral genome sequences were generated in 86% of RNA-seq-positive samples, allowing assessment of antiviral resistance, strain-level typing, and phylogenetic relatedness. Overall, untargeted metagenomics had high agreement with a sensitive RVP, detected viruses not targeted by the RVP, and yielded epidemiologically and clinically valuable sequence information.","Graf, Erin H; Simmon, Keith E; Tardif, Keith D; Hymas, Weston; Flygare, Steven; Eilbeck, Karen; Yandell, Mark; Schlaberg, Robert",Journal of clinical microbiology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jcm.03060-15; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26818672/,114

The long-term clinical and patient-reported outcomes of these treatments in a tertiary referral center for proctology were evaluated. Methods A retrospective analysis was performed in all patients with grade III hemorrhoids who were treated between January 2013 and August 2018. Medical history, symptoms, reinterventions, complications, and patient-reported outcome measurements (PROM) were retrieved from individual electronic patient files, which were prospectively entered as standard questionnaires in our clinic. Results Overall, 327 patients (163 males) were treated by either RBL (n=182) or hemorrhoidectomy (n=145). The median follow-up was 44 months. The severity of symptoms and patient preference led to the treatment of choice. The most commonly experienced symptoms were prolapse (83.2%) and blood loss (69.7%). Hemorrhoidectomy was effective in 95.9% of the cases as a single procedure, while a single RBL procedure was only effective in 51.6%. In the RBL group, 34.6% received a second RBL session. Complications were not significantly different, 11 (7.6%) after hemorrhoidectomy versus 6 (3.3%) after RBL. However, 4 fistulas developed after hemorrhoidectomy and none after RBL (P<0.05). The pre-procedure PROM score was higher in the hemorrhoidectomy group whereas the post-procedure PROM score did not significantly differ between the groups. Conclusion Treatment of grade III hemorrhoids usually requires more than one session RBL whereas 1-time hemorrhoidectomy suffices. Complications were more common after hemorrhoidectomy. The patient-related outcome did not differ between procedures.","Dekker, Lisette; Bak, Michiel T J; Bemelman, Willem A; Felt-Bersma, Richelle J F; Han-Geurts, Ingrid J M",Annals of coloproctology,https://doi.org/10.3393/ac.2020.01011.0144; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34314581/,114
99934,From creative thinking to scientific principles in clinical practice.,2020-09-28,"BACKGROUND The use of noninvasive ventilation (NIV) is debated in de novo respiratory failure. Prolonged sessions, using a dedicated NIV ventilator, with high PEEP levels could be associated with better outcomes than shorter sessions using an ICU ventilator, with low PEEP levels. We performed a systematic review of randomized controlled trials to test whether the incidence of intubation was influenced by the NIV protocol in subjects admitted to the ICU for de novo respiratory failure. METHODS We selected randomized trials on NIV indexed in medical literature databases from their inception to April 2018. Pediatric studies, those performed outside of the ICU, trials with subjects on NIV for a reason other than de novo respiratory failure, and studies in which NIV protocol was not specified were excluded. Two authors independently extracted intubation rates and the NIV protocol (prolonged or short sessions, type of ventilator, and PEEP levels). RESULTS Fourteen studies, which included 750 subjects treated with NIV for de novo respiratory failure in ICU, were analyzed. Overall intubation rate was 38%, 95% CI 31-45% and was not influenced by prolonged NIV sessions or the type of ventilator. The 154 subjects treated with PEEP greater than the median overall PEEP (6 cm H2O) had a PEEP level of 8 ± 2 cm H2O and a pressure support level of 7 ± 2 cm H2O. Their intubation rate was lower than the 293 subjects treated with lower PEEP levels (25%, 95% CI 15-37% vs 43%, 95% CI 33-54%, respectively, P = .03). Inclusion criteria were heterogeneous, and critical information on NIV application were frequently lacking. CONCLUSIONS Except for high PEEP levels that might be associated with lower intubation rates, the protocol for carrying out NIV does not seem to influence intubation rate in patients with de novo respiratory failure.","Coudroy, Rémi; Hoppe, Marie-Anne; Robert, René; Frat, Jean-Pierre; Thille, Arnaud W",Respiratory care,https://doi.org/10.4187/respcare.07104; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31772067/,114
100021,Assessing Genitourinary Cancer Clinical Trial Accrual Sufficiency Using Archived Trial Data.,2020-07-01,"The development of the laryngeal mask airway in 1981 was an important first step toward widespread use and acceptance of the extraglottic airway (EGA). The term extraglottic is used in this review to encompass those airways that do not violate the larynx, in addition to those with a supraglottic position. Although the term extraglottic may be broad and include airways such as tracheostomy tubes, the term supraglottic does not describe a large number of devices with subglottic components and is too narrow for a discussion of modern devices. EGAs have flourished in practice, and now a wide variety of devices are available for an ever-expanding array of applications. In this review we attempt to clarify the current state of EGA devices new and old, and to illustrate their use in numerous settings. Particular attention is paid to the use of EGAs in special situations such as obstetric, pediatric, prehospital, and nontraditional ""out of the operating room"" settings. The role of the EGA in difficult airway management is discussed. EGA devices have saved countless lives because they facilitate ventilation when facemask ventilation and tracheal intubation were not possible. Traditionally, difficult airway management focused on successful tracheal intubation. The EGA has allowed a paradigm shift, changing the emphasis of difficult airway management from tracheal intubation to ventilation and oxygenation. EGA devices have proved to be useful adjuncts to tracheal intubation; in particular, the combination of EGA devices and fiberoptic guidance is a powerful technique for difficult airway management. Despite their utility, EGAs do have disadvantages. For example, they typically do not provide the same protection from pulmonary aspiration of regurgitated gastric material as a cuffed tracheal tube. The risk of aspiration of gastric contents persists despite advances in EGA design that have sought to address the issue. The association between excessive EGA cuff pressure and potential morbidity is becoming increasingly recognized. The widespread success and adoption of the EGA into clinical practice has revolutionized airway management and anesthetic care. Although the role of EGAs is well established, the user must know each device's particular strengths and limitations and understand that limited data are available for guidance until a new device has been well studied.","Hernandez, Michael R; Klock, P Allan; Ovassapian, Adranik",Anesthesia and analgesia,https://doi.org/10.1213/ane.0b013e31823b6748; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22178627/,114

100662,The predictive diagnostic value of the cytological findings in incontinentia pigmenti: a preliminary report.,2021-03-24,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW Infections have been suggested to contribute to disease induction and reactivation in many of the idiopathic vasculitides. This review describes and evaluates the evidence that microbes are involved in the etiopathogenesis of these diseases. RECENT FINDINGS Large-vessel vasculitis has recently been associated with two specific bacteria. Mycobacterium tuberculosis is thought to have an inducing role in Takayasu arteritis and a Burkholderia bacterium might be involved in giant cell arteritis. Hepatitis B and C viruses have been linked to polyarteritis nodosa. In antineutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibody-associated vasculitis, and more specifically granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA), Staphylococcus aureus has been the focus of many studies. Chronic nasal carriage of S. aureus is related to endonasal activity and disease relapses in GPA patients. Moreover, antibacterial treatment is known to reduce the risk for disease relapses. If and how pathogens trigger vasculitis is still unclear, but several potential mechanisms have been suggested and are briefly reviewed here. SUMMARY Although many observations suggest a link between infections and the development of vasculitis, no direct proof exists. Transcriptomic and proteomic studies of the pathogens involved could aid in identifying specific or common traits of pathogens that are relevant for the development and reactivation of vasculitis.","van Timmeren, Mirjan M; Heeringa, Peter; Kallenberg, Cees G M",Current opinion in rheumatology,https://doi.org/10.1097/bor.0000000000000068; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24827750/,114
100911,Home Blood Pressure Monitoring Devices: Device Performance in an Alaska Native and American Indian Population.,2021,"OBJECTIVE To assess the incidence and epidemiological pattern of respiratory viruses in HIV-infected patients and to evaluate their potential clinical impact. DESIGN AND METHODS A prospective population-based cohort study was conducted at three Swiss university hospitals. Study participants were HIV-infected patients who underwent a bronchoalveolar lavage to rule out an opportunistic event. All bronchoalveolar lavage specimens were screened using a set of real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction assays targeting 17 different respiratory viruses. RESULTS Between November 2003 and November 2006, 59 bronchoalveolar episodes from 55 HIV-infected patients were analysed. Eleven of 59 episodes (18.6%) were positive for at least one respiratory virus. Coronavirus OC43 was identified in three cases (27.3%) followed by influenza A in two (18.2%). Parainfluenza virus (PIV) 2, PIV 3, PIV 4, bocavirus, human rhinovirus A and human metapneumovirus were each identified in one case (9%).

The underlying mechanism for motor deficits related to tauopathy is not yet fully understood. Here, we use a novel transgenic tau mouse line, Tau 58/4, with enhanced neuron-specific expression of P301S mutant tau to investigate the motor abnormalities in association with the peripheral nervous system. Using stationary beam, gait, and rotarod tests, motor deficits were found in Tau 58/4 mice already 3 months after birth, which deteriorated during aging. Hyperphosphorylated tau was detected in the cell bodies and axons of motor neurons. At the age of 9 and 12 months, significant denervation of the neuromuscular junction in the extensor digitorum longus muscle was observed in Tau 58/4 mice, compared to wild-type mice. Muscle hypotrophy was observed in Tau 58/4 mice at 9 and 12 months. Using electron microscopy, we observed ultrastructural changes in the sciatic nerve of 12-month-old Tau 58/4 mice indicative of the loss of large axonal fibers and hypomyelination (assessed by g-ratio). We conclude that the accumulated hyperphosphorylated tau in the axon terminals may induce dying-back axonal degeneration, myelin abnormalities, neuromuscular junction denervation, and muscular atrophy, which may be the mechanisms responsible for the deterioration of the motor function in Tau 58/4 mice. Tau 58/4 mice represent an interesting neuromuscular degeneration model, and the pathological mechanisms might be responsible for motor signs observed in some human tauopathies.","Yin, Zhuoran; Valkenburg, Femke; Hornix, Betty E; Mantingh-Otter, Ietje; Zhou, Xingdong; Mari, Muriel; Reggiori, Fulvio; Van Dam, Debby; Eggen, Bart J L; De Deyn, Peter P; Boddeke, Erik",Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,https://doi.org/10.3233/jad-161206; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28222529/,114

Consequently, this leads to the activation of TNFR-associated factor family member-associated NF-κB activator-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) and phosphorylation of IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF3). It remains to be elucidated how MAVS activates TBK1/IRF3. In this study, we report that IFN-induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats 3 (IFIT3) is significantly induced upon RNA virus infection. Ectopic expression or knockdown of IFIT3 could, respectively, enhance or impair IRF3-mediated gene expression. Mechanistically, the tetratrico-peptide repeat motif (E164/E165) of IFIT3 interacts with the N terminus (K38) of TBK1, thus bridging TBK1 to MAVS on the mitochondrion. Disruption of this interaction markedly attenuates the activation of TBK1 and IRF3. Furthermore, host antiviral responses are significantly boosted or crippled in the presence or absence of IFIT3. Collectively, our study characterizes IFIT3 as an important modulator in innate immunity, revealing a new function of the IFIT family proteins (IFN-induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats).","Liu, Xin-Yi; Chen, Wei; Wei, Bo; Shan, Yu-Fei; Wang, Chen",Journal of immunology,https://doi.org/10.4049/jimmunol.1100963; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21813773/,114

103005,COVID-19 and Kawasaki Disease: Novel Virus and Novel Case.,2020-04-07,"The SidA ornithine hydroxylase from Aspergillus fumigatus is a fungal disease drug target involved in the production of hydroxamate containing siderophores, which are used by the pathogen to sequester iron. SidA is an N-monooxygenase that catalyzes the NADPH-dependent hydroxylation of L-ornithine through a multistep oxidative mechanism, utilizing a C4a-hydroperoxyflavin intermediate. Here we present four new crystal structures of SidA in various redox- and ligation states, including the first structure of oxidized SidA without NADP(H) or L-ornithine bound (resting state). The resting state structure reveals a new ""out"" active site conformation characterized by large rotations of the FAD isoalloxazine around the C1'-C2' and N10-C1' bonds, coupled to a 10 Å movement of the Tyr-loop. Additional structures show that either flavin reduction or the binding of NADP(H) is sufficient to drive the FAD to the ""in"" conformation. The structures also reveal protein conformational changes associated with the binding of NADP(H) and L-ornithine. Some of these residues were probed using site-directed mutagenesis. Docking was used to explore the active site of the ""out"" conformation. These calculations identified two potential ligand-binding sites. Altogether, our results provide new information about conformational dynamics in flavin-dependent monooxygenases. Understanding the different active site conformations that appear during the catalytic cycle may allow fine tuning of inhibitor discovery efforts.","Campbell, Ashley C; Stiers, Kyle M; Martin Del Campo, Julia S; Mehra-Chaudhary, Ritcha; Sobrado, Pablo; Tanner, John J",The Journal of biological chemistry,https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.ra120.014750; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32723870/,114

We investigated the clinical relevance of these patterns. METHODS Patients with a surgical biopsy of lung adenocarcinoma from a metastatic site were included. Slides were reviewed by an anatomical pathologist identifying the histologic patterns of solid with mucin, acinar, micropapillary, papillary, and assigning a major adenocarcinoma subtype according to the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer/American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society classification. EGFR and KRAS mutation testing were performed on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded blocks. Mutations were detected by high resolution melting assay with high resolution melting-positive samples confirmed by Sanger sequencing. RESULTS One-hundred patients were included. The major histologic subtype prevalence was as follows: solid (50), acinar (29), micropapillary (20), and papillary (1). Of 100 patients, 45 received no systemic therapy with no overall survival differences seen by histologic subtype and 55 received systemic therapy (chemoradiotherapy with curative intent or palliative chemotherapy). Worse survival was seen in the major solid histologic subtype compared with major acinar (hazard ratio 0.32 [95% confidence interval 0.15-0.68], p = 0.003) and micropapillary subtypes (hazard ratio 0.34 [95% confidence interval, 0.17-0.69], p = 0.003). The major solid histologic subtype was less likely to harbor EGFR mutations (p = 0.006) and was less frequent in never smokers (p = 0.010) compared with other histologic subtypes. CONCLUSION The major solid histologic subtype of lung adenocarcinoma at metastatic sites is associated with shorter overall survival on systemic anticancer therapy. Furthermore, the major solid histologic subtype is less likely to harbor EGFR mutations. These results require validation in larger cohorts.","Clay, Timothy D; Do, Hongdo; Sundararajan, Vijaya; Moore, Melissa M; Conron, Matthew; Wright, Gavin M; McLachlan, Sue-Anne; Dobrovic, Alexander; Russell, Prudence A",Journal of thoracic oncology : official publication of the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer,https://doi.org/10.1097/jto.0000000000000150; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24722155/,114

In this study, we aim to investigate the predictors of initial flexible ureteroscopy skills among novice trainees. METHODS This was a prospective study involving students with no prior ureteroscopy exposure. Non-surgical parameters were assessed with a detailed survey, including demographics, video game, and musical history. Musical ability was objectively evaluated with the mini-Profile of Music Perception Skills test. Ureteroscopic performance was evaluated using a Boston Scientific© flexible ureteroscope on a bench model. Each participant completed diagnostic ureteroscopy and stone extraction. Outcomes included both speed and quality of performance, based on an Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skills rubric. RESULTS A total of 28 pre-clerkship medical students and 10 urology residents were included. Age and musical background were not associated with ureteroscopic aptitude. Those with video game history tended to perform ureteroscopy tasks faster with a higher OSATS score, although no statistical significance was reached. Male gender was associated with faster task completion with statistically higher OSATS score independent of video game activities (p = 0.011), however, the absolute score difference was small. CONCLUSIONS Among novice trainees, musical and video game experience was not predictive of ureteroscopy skills. Male gender was associated with slightly faster and higher ureteroscopy technique scores, however, the differences are small and unlikely to represent clinical significance. Nevertheless, the use of ureteroscopy trainer provides useful insights and should be adopted in training programs as a marker of skills progression.","Sun, Ryan; Mohaghegh, Mohammad; Sidhom, Karim; Burton, Lauren; Bansal, Rahul; Patel, Premal",World journal of urology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00345-021-03846-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34608509/,114

METHODS Between 2011 and 2012, 75 patients (mean age 64.2±8.9 years; 46 men) with Rutherford category 2-4 ischemia and atherosclerotic lesions ≤10 cm in length underwent iliac artery stenting at 17 centers in the United States and Europe. The primary outcome of the study was the major adverse event (MAE) rate at 9 months postprocedure [composite of periprocedural death, in-hospital myocardial infarction, clinically driven target lesion revascularization (CD-TLR), and amputation of the treated limb]. Secondary outcomes included 30-day MAE rate, 9-month primary patency, changes in ankle-brachial index (ABI) and the Walking Impairment Questionnaire at 30 days and 9 months postprocedure, device success, and clinically driven target vessel revascularization (CD-TVR) at 30 days and 9 months. Outcomes in specific patient cohorts (ie, gender, stent location, calcification severity, and lesion grade) were analyzed. RESULTS Eighty-one stents were implanted in 61 CIA and 15 EIA lesions (41 with moderate/severe calcification). The mean lesion treated length was 29.3±13.9 mm. All devices were successfully deployed. MAE occurred in 3 (4.0%) of 75 subjects at 9 months. Primary patency and freedom from CD-TVR at 9 months were both 95.8%. ABI improved from 0.67±0.14 at baseline to 0.94±0.14 and 0.96±0.16 at 30 days and 9-month follow-up, respectively (p<0.001 for both). There were no differences with respect to any of the analyzed patient characteristics, including gender.

MATERIALS AND METHODS From January 2003 to January 2009, 29 patients (36 lung lesions) were treated with RFA; from January 2007 to January 2009, 16 patients (17 lung lesions) were treated with MWA. Complications recorded at our institution are reported following the Society of Interventional Radiology guidelines. A systematic review of the literature was performed. RESULTS Any major complication of RFA or MWA was recorded. In agreement with the literature, pneumothorax was the most frequent complication, even though the incidence in our series was lower than reported in the literature (3.5% vs. 4.3-18%). Other complications of RFA were pleural effusion and subcutaneous emphysema. No massive haemorrhages, haemoptysis, abscesses, pneumonia, infections or tumour seeding were recorded in our series. The most common complication of MWA was pneumothorax (25% vs. 39% reported in the literature). Pleural effusion was a common reaction, but therapeutic drainage was never required. CONCLUSIONS Pneumothorax is the most common complication of both techniques.

METHODS One of us (LRW) reviewed 35 medical records of patients with chronic pain who overdosed, 20 of them fatally, while consuming therapeutic opioids, leading to lawsuits against physicians for malpractice. The reviews were requested by plaintiff and defense attorneys from across the United States from 2005 to 2009 to ascertain which drug(s) were primarily responsible for each death and whether the death was due to physician error, patient nonadherence, or some other reason. Complaints against pharmaceutical companies were excluded. Cases were examined for common trends, and comment is offered. RESULTS Methadone was responsible for the most deaths at 10 (50%), and hydrocodone was second at four deaths (20%) The most common risk factors found in the medical records of decedents included prescriber error in initiating, converting or titrating doses, patient nonadherence to medical instruction, presence of comorbid mental disorders, toxicological presence of benzodiazepines, middle age, and unrelieved pain. This article focuses on examples of physician errors and how they can be prevented. CONCLUSIONS Common trends emerge from medical records of opioid decedents. Patient actions con-tribute, but physician error, particularly regarding prescribing methadone for pain, is apparent as well.

106408,Extension of the thoracic spine sign as a diagnostic marker for thoracic trauma.,2020-08-17,"BACKGROUND The various epidemiological indicators used to communicate the impact of COVID-19 have different strengths and limitations. METHODS We conducted a selective literature review to identify the indicators used and to derive appropriate definitions. We calculated crude and age-adjusted indicators for selected countries. RESULTS The proportion of deaths (case fatality proportion [CFP]; number of deaths/ total number of cases) is commonly used to estimate the severity of a disease. If the CFP is used for purposes of comparison, the existence of heterogeneity in the detection and registration of cases and deaths has to be taken into account. In the early phase of an epidemic, when case numbers rise rapidly, the CFP suffers from bias. For these reasons, variants have been proposed: the ""confirmed CFP"" (number of deaths/total number of confirmed cases), and the ""delay-adjusted CFP,"" which considers the delay between infection with the disease and death from the disease. The indicator mortality (number of deaths/total population) has at first sight the advantage of being based on a defined denominator, the total population. During the outbreak of a disease, however, the cumulative deaths rise while the total population remains stable. The phase of the epidemic therefore has to be considered when using this indicator. In this context, R0 and R(t) are important indicators. R0 estimates the maximum rate of spread of a disease in a population, while R(t) describes the dynamics of the epidemic at a given time. Age-adjusted analysis of the CFP shows that the differences between countries decrease but do not dis - appear completely. If the test strategies depend on age or symptom severity, however, the bias cannot be entirely eliminated. CONCLUSION Various indicators of the impact of the COVID-19 epidemic at population level are used in daily communication. Considering the relevance of the pandemic and the importance of relevant communications, however, the strengths and the limitations of each parameter must be considered carefully.","Gianicolo, Emilio; Riccetti, Nicola; Blettner, Maria; Karch, André",Deutsches Arzteblatt international,https://doi.org/10.3238/arztebl.2020.0336; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32527379/,114

METHODS Previously healthy children <2 years old with mild (outpatients) and severe (inpatients) RSV infection were enrolled and viral loads measured by polymerase chain reaction in nasopharyngeal swabs. Patients were stratified by age in 0-<3, 3-6 and >6-24 months, and multivariable analyses were performed to identify clinical and viral factors associated with severe disease. RESULTS From 2014 to 2018, we enrolled 534 children with RSV infection, 130 outpatients with mild RSV infection and 404 inpatients with severe RSV disease. Median duration of illness was 4 days for both groups, yet viral loads were higher in outpatients than in inpatients (P < 0.001). In bivariate analyses, wheezing was more frequent in outpatients of older age (>3 months) than in inpatients (P < 0.01), while fever was more common in inpatients than outpatients (P < 0.01) and its frequency increased with age. Adjusted analyses confirmed that increased work of breathing and fever were consistently associated with hospitalization irrespective of age, while wheezing in infants >3 months, and higher RSV loads in children >6-24 months were independently associated with reduced disease severity. CONCLUSIONS Age had a significant impact defining the interactions among viral loads, specific clinical manifestations and disease severity in children with RSV infection.

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying its effects have remained elusive. Here we report the discovery of a new functional link between EAF2 and TGF-β signaling. Promoter reporter assays indicated that EAF2 suppresses Smad3 transcriptional activity, resulting in inhibition of TGF-β signaling. Coimmunoprecipitation assays showed that EAF2 specifically interacts with Smad3 in vitro and in vivo but not with other Smad proteins. In addition, we observed that EAF2 binding does not alter Smad3 phosphorylation but causes Smad3 cytoplasmic retention, competes with Smad4 for binding to Smad3, and prevents p300-Smad3 complex formation. Furthermore, we demonstrated that EAF2 suppresses both TGF-β-induced G1 cell cycle arrest and TGF-β-induced cell migration. This study identifies and characterizes a novel repressor of TGF-β signaling.","Liu, Xing; Chen, Zhu; Ouyang, Gang; Song, Tieshan; Liang, Huageng; Liu, Wei; Xiao, Wuhan",The Journal of biological chemistry,https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.m115.663542; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26370086/,114

Many children with CCNs use augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) devices to support communication, yet little is known about family adaptation to such technology. To fill this gap, an integrative review, guided by the Resiliency Model of Family Stress, Adjustment, and Adaptation was conducted to assess conceptual foundations and the state of the science of family adaptation among children utilizing AAC. Web-based searches were conducted using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis and the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool. Thirty-three studies met eligibility. Findings demonstrated that to enhance the science underpinning family adaptation to AAC use, future research should be grounded conceptually and address important components of the Resiliency Model.

An efficient way to achieve low-carbon economy targets is to decompose different factors contributing to CO2 emissions, including structure effect, intensity effect, GDP gap effect, energy use efficiency effect, and economic efficiency. We classify economic sectors into three groups based on performance, i.e., sectors performing below, average, and above-average performing. Our results indicate that the economic efficiency and energy use efficiency effects in the industry sector have remained above average. In contrast, the GDP gap effect has remained below average. In the case of structure effect and intensity effect, the agriculture sector has performed on average. In contrast, the service sector has shown mixed results in all factors. The government should pay special attention to energy use structure and innovation to improve desirable output technical efficiency to achieve the target carbon emission level.","Azam, Muhammad; Nawaz, Saima; Rafiq, Zubair; Iqbal, Nasir",Environmental science and pollution research international,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11356-020-12088-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33411292/,114

Despite their importance, the development of a practical, real-time means of monitoring bioaerosols has remained elusive. Here, we present a novel, simple, and highly efficient means of obtaining enriched bioaerosol samples. Aerosols are collected into a thin and stable liquid film by the unique interaction of a superhydrophilic surface and a continuous two-phase centrifugal flow. We demonstrate that this method can provide a concentration enhancement ratio of ∼2.4 × 106 with a collection efficiency of ∼99.9% and an aerosol-into-liquid transfer rate of ∼95.9% at 500 nm particle size (smaller than a single bacterium). This transfer is effective in both laboratory and external ambient environments. The system has a low limit of detection of <50 CFU/m3air using a straightforward bioluminescence-based technique and shows significant potential for air monitoring in occupational and public-health applications.","Heo, Ki Joon; Ko, Hyun Sik; Jeong, Sang Bin; Kim, Sang Bok; Jung, Jae Hee",Nano letters,https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.nanolett.0c04096; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33444028/,114

Because of its ability to cause a lethal infection, low infectious dose, and aerosolizable nature, F. tularensis subspecies tularensis is considered a potential biowarfare agent. Due to its in vitro efficacy, ciprofloxacin is one of the antibiotics recommended for post-exposure prophylaxis of tularemia. In order to identify therapeutics that will be efficacious against infections caused by drug resistant select-agents and to better understand the threat, we sought to characterize an existing ciprofloxacin resistant (CipR) mutant in the Schu S4 strain of F. tularensis by determining its phenotypic characteristics and sequencing the chromosome to identify additional genetic alterations that may have occurred during the selection process. In addition to the previously described genetic alterations, the sequence of the CipR mutant strain revealed several additional mutations. Of particular interest was a frameshift mutation within kdsD which encodes for an enzyme necessary for the production of 3-Deoxy-D-manno-Octulosonic Acid (KDO), an integral component of the lipopolysaccharide (LPS). A kdsD mutant was constructed in the Schu S4 strain. Although it was not resistant to ciprofloxacin, the kdsD mutant shared many phenotypic characteristics with the CipR mutant, including growth defects under different conditions, sensitivity to hydrophobic agents, altered LPS profiles, and attenuation in multiple models of murine tularemia. This study demonstrates that the KdsD enzyme is essential for Francisella virulence and may be an attractive therapeutic target for developing novel medical countermeasures.","Chance, Taylor; Chua, Jennifer; Toothman, Ronald G; Ladner, Jason T; Nuss, Jonathan E; Raymond, Jo Lynne; Biot, Fabrice V; Demons, Samandra; Miller, Lynda; Halasohoris, Stephanie; Mou, Sherry; Koroleva, Galina; Lovett, Sean; Palacios, Gustavo; Vietri, Nicholas J; Worsham, Patricia L; Cote, Christopher K; Kijek, Todd M; Bozue, Joel A",PloS one,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0174106; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28328947/,114

STUDY DESIGN Prospective survey. SAMPLE POPULATION 1234 respondents from 5 veterinary university teaching hospitals in North America. METHODS An electronic survey was distributed to faculty, students, and staff that currently are or previously were dog owners. Responses were analyzed to determine what spay technique respondents would choose for their own dogs. Surgical options offered included open celiotomy, 2-port (TP) laparoscopy, single-port (SP) laparoscopy, and natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES). RESULTS TP laparoscopic ovariectomy (OVE) was the most popular choice, followed by SP laparoscopic OVE; NOTES was the least popular technique when all surgical options were available. If only minimally invasive surgeries were offered, 0.3% of respondents would refuse surgery. Nearly half (48%) of respondents were willing to spend between $100 and $200 more for a minimally invasive OVE than for an open celiotomy. CONCLUSION Minimally invasive OVE is an acceptable operative approach to those in the veterinary community. Additional study is required to correlate these findings with the general veterinary client population.","Hsueh, Christine; Giuffrida, Michelle; Mayhew, Philipp D; Case, J Brad; Singh, Ameet; Monnet, Eric; Holt, David E; Cray, Megan; Curcillo, Chiara; Runge, Jeffrey J",Veterinary surgery : VS,https://doi.org/10.1111/vsu.12766; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29400403/,114

The objective of this study was to describe the volume and mix of outpatient physician care over the last 12 months of life among patients dying with different end-of-life trajectories. METHODS We conducted a retrospective descriptive study involving adults (aged ≥ 18 yr) who died in Ontario between 2013 and 2017, using linked provincial health administrative databases. Decedents were grouped into 5 mutually exclusive end-of-life trajectories (terminal illness, organ failure, frailty, sudden death and other). Over the last 12 months and 3 months of life, we examined the number of physician encounters, the number of unique physician specialties involved per patient and specialty of physician, the number of unique physicians involved per patient, the 5 most frequent types of specialties involved and the number of encounters that took place in the home; these patterns were examined by trajectory. RESULTS Decedents (n = 359 559) had a median age of 78 (interquartile range 66-86) years. The mean number of outpatient physician encounters over the last year of life was 16.8 (standard deviation [SD] 13.7), of which 9.0 (SD 9.2) encounters were with family physicians. The mean number of encounters ranged from 11.6 (SD 10.4) in the frailty trajectory to 24.2 (SD 15.0) in the terminal illness trajectory across 3.1 (SD 2.0) to 4.9 (SD 2.1) unique specialties, respectively. In the last 3 months of life, the mean number of physician encounters was 6.8 (SD 6.4); a mean of 4.1 (SD 5.4) of these were with family physicians. INTERPRETATION Multiple physicians are involved in outpatient care in the last 12 months of life for all end-of-life trajectories, with family physicians as the predominant specialty. Those who plan health care models of the end of life should consider support for family physicians as coordinators of patient care.","Howard, Michelle; Hafid, Abe; Isenberg, Sarina R; Hsu, Amy T; Scott, Mary; Conen, Katrin; Webber, Colleen; Bronskill, Susan E; Downar, James; Tanuseputro, Peter",CMAJ open,https://doi.org/10.9778/cmajo.20210039; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34088732/,114

The IBV-Ark vaccine was applied ocularly and tears were collected from infected chickens for subsequent ocular inoculation in later passages. The experiment was performed twice. In both experiments the dominant S1 genotype of the vaccine strain was rapidly and negatively selected in all chicken groups (CAV, IBDV, CAV+IBDV and immunocompetent). Based on the S1 genotype, the same IBV subpopulations previously reported in immunocompetent chickens and named component (C) 1 to C5 emerged both in immunocompetent and immunodeficient chickens. During the first passage different subpopulations emerged, followed by the establishment of one or two predominant populations after further passages. Only when the subpopulation designated C2 became established in either CAV-infected or IBDV-infected chickens was IBV maintained for more than four passages. These results indicate that selection does not cease in immunodeficient chickens and that phenotype C2 may show a distinct adaptation to this environment. Subpopulations C1 or C4 initially became established in immunocompetent birds but became extinct after only a few succeeding passages. A similar result was observed in chickens co-infected with CAV+IBDV. These results suggest that the generation of genetic diversity in IBV is constrained. This finding constitutes further evidence for phenotypic drift occurring mainly as a result of selection.","Gallardo, Rodrigo A; van Santen, Vicky L; Toro, Haroldo",Avian pathology : journal of the W.V.P.A,https://doi.org/10.1080/03079457.2012.702889; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22897690/,114

However, limited evidence revealed the PSPH influence on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Herein, we observed that PSPH expression was upregulated in both HCC tissues and cell lines, which was determined by Western blotting. TCGA database showed that the PSPH protein levels were significantly upregulated and affected patient survival rates in HCC. Then gain- and loss-of-function manipulations were performed by transfection with a pcDNA-PSPH expression vector or a specific siRNA against PSPH in Huh7 cells. Huh7 cell proliferation, stemness, invasion and apoptosis were assessed by using CCK-8 test, colony formation assay, Transwell assay and Flow cytometry analysis, respectively, and levels of autophagy-related proteins were detected by using Western blotting. The results showed that PSPH could induce Huh7 cell autophagy, promote cell proliferation and invasion, and inhibit apoptosis. Knockdown of PSPH could inhibit Huh7 cell proliferation, invasion, and autophagy. Furthermore, PSPH activated Liver kinase B1 (LKB1) and TGF beta-activated kinase 1 (TAK1), affected the AMPK/mTOR/ULK1 signaling pathway, but could not activate calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase (CaMKK) in Huh7 cells. Inhibition of either LKB1, TAK1, or AMPK could eliminate the effect of PSPH overexpression on Huh7 cell behaviors. However, inhibition of CaMKK could not influence the effect of PSPH overexpression on Huh7 cell behaviors.

Herein, we report on our experience with endovascular treatment of complicated AVA. MATERIALS AND METHODS From September 2015 to December 2016, 3 patients at our clinic underwent an occlusion of hemodialysis AVA with 2 different Amplatzer vascular plugs: 2 patients with type II and 1 patient with type IV. Of these, 1 patient was treated for an autologous radiocephalic fistula, the second patient was treated for an autologous brachiocephalic fistula located at the elbow, and the third was, instead, treated for a radiocephalic forearm fistula. The reason for closing the AVA in all patients was due to the presence of dialysis-associated steal syndrome with critical hand ischemia and intractable ipsilateral edema. RESULTS All AVAs were treated using an AVP. No plug migration, access revascularization, persistent ischemia, nor other complications were observed. CONCLUSION This report suggests that the use of AVP for embolization of complicated AVA is a safe and reasonable alternative to open surgery in selected patients.","Filippo, Michele Di; Barbarisi, Danilo; Ferrara, Doriana; Brancaccio, Stefania; Del Guercio, Luca; Bracale, Renata; Capuano, Alfredo; Esposito, Giovanni; Bracale, Umberto Marcello",Case reports in nephrology and dialysis,https://doi.org/10.1159/000477663; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28868296/,114

MATERIALS AND METHODS Spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) were selected in this study to establish the animal model. The content of miR-195 in the model group and control group was measured, respectively. Arterial blood pressure, liver function and myocardial function in the two groups were detected and examined. Pathological changes in rat myocardial tissues were detected via hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining. After that, myocardial fibroblasts were collected and added with miRNA inhibitors and mimics to suppress and overexpress miR-195. Thereafter, Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blotting were employed to detect the mRNA and protein expression levels of checkpoint kinase 1 (Chek1) and alpha-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) (important molecules for proliferation and differentiation of myocardial fibroblasts), as well as the related pathway TGFβ1-Smad3. Furthermore, the effects of miR-195 on myocardial fibrosis in hypertensive rats via the TGFβ1-Smad3 signaling pathway were comprehensively observed. RESULTS Serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP), glutamic pyruvic aminotransferase (ALT) and creatine kinase (CK) levels in the SHR group were significantly higher than those of the normal group. Cardiac function examination showed that SHR group had significantly reduced fractional shortening (FS, %) and ejection fraction (EF, %) in comparison with the normal group. However, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, left ventricular end-diastolic dimension (LVEDd) and left ventricular end-systolic dimension (LVESd) were markedly elevated in the SHR group. In addition, the miR-195 expression level was remarkably reduced in hypertensive rats. Histopathological changes in rat myocardial tissues were detected through HE staining. The results showed that the normal group had orderly arranged myocardial cells. However, SHR group showed disorderly arranged myocardial cells, thickened myocardial fibers and myocardial fibrosis. RT-PCR assay results revealed that the mRNA levels of Collagen, Chek1, α-SMA, TGFβ1 and Smad3 in rat myocardial fibroblasts were significantly reduced in Mimics group (p<0.05) and increased in Inhibitors group (p<0.05). Western blotting results demonstrated that, compared with the control group, the protein levels of α-SMA, TGFβ1 and Smad3 in rat myocardial cells decreased significantly in Mimics group (p<0.05). Opposite results were observed in Inhibitors group (p<0.05). The above results suggested that overexpression of miR-195 inhibited the expressions of TGFβ1-Smad3 signaling pathway and related molecules, further repressing myocardial fibrosis. CONCLUSIONS MiR-195 participates in the development and progression of myocardial fibrosis in hypertensive rats through the TGFβ1-Smad3 signaling pathway. Furthermore, this can inhibit the development of myocardial fibrosis in hypertensive rats and prevent myocardial diseases.","Xu, Q; Lin, X-X; Liu, P; Zhang, W; Tang, K; Zhai, Y-S; Liu, L-J; Mei, W-Y",European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,https://doi.org/10.26355/eurrev_201909_19026; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31599435/,114

Efforts using low-dose (LD) interleukin-2 (IL-2) to expand autologous Treg cells show therapeutic efficacy for several inflammatory conditions. Whether LD IL-2 is an effective strategy for treating patients with IBD is unknown. Recently, we demonstrated that LD IL-2 was protective against experimental colitis in immune humanized mice in which human CD4+ T cells were restricted to human leukocyte antigen (HLA). Whether HLA restriction is required for human Treg cells to ameliorate colitis following LD IL-2 therapy has not been demonstrated. Here, we show that treatment with LD IL-2 reduced 2,4,6-trinitrobenzensulfonic acid (TNBS) colitis severity in NOD.PrkdcscidIl2rg-/- (NSG) mice reconstituted with human CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells. These data demonstrate the utility of standard immune humanized NSG mice as a pre-clinical model system to evaluate therapeutics targeting human Treg cells to treat IBD.","Tyagi, Rajeev K; Jacobse, Justin; Li, Jing; Allaman, Margret M; Otipoby, Kevin L; Sampson, Erik R; Wilson, Keith T; Goettel, Jeremy A",Frontiers in immunology,https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2021.630204; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33717161/,114

This study aimed to estimate the frequency of ASD in health care workers of a tertiary level pediatric hospital during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional study in which health care workers completed a virtual questionnaire, including sociodemographic information and the ASD scale. Results We analyzed 206 questionnaires. The population was divided into three groups: attending physicians, medical residents, and nursing personnel. The frequency of health care workers who showed at least nine symptoms of ASD was 88.8%. No significant differences were found between the studied groups. Conclusions ASD is a frequent condition in health care workers in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. We need to investigate further and assess risk and protective factors for developing this and other psychopathologies in this population.","Chapa-Koloffon, Gina Del C; Jean-Tron, María G; Ávila-Hernández, Aidee V; Márquez-González, Horacio; Garduño-Espinosa, Juan",Boletin medico del Hospital Infantil de Mexico,https://doi.org/10.24875/bmhim.20000226; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33661878/,114

In the present study, we investigated the effect of combining of two types of supramolecular interactions with different geometric requirements, amide hydrogen bonding and π-interactions, on the π-overlap between calamitic π-conjugated cores. To this end, we prepared two series of bithiophene diesters and diamides with methylene, ethylene, or propylene spacers between the bithiophene core and the functional groups in their terminal substituents. The hydrogen-bonded bithiophene diamides showed significantly denser packing of the bithiophene cores than the diesters and other known α,ω-disubstituted bithiophenes. The bithiophene packing density reach a maximum in the bithiophene diamide with an ethylene spacer, which featured the smallest longitudinal bithiophene displacement and infinite 1D arrays of electronically conjugated, parallel, and almost linear N-H···O=C hydrogen bonds. The synergistic hydrogen bonding and π-interactions were attributed to the favorable conformational mechanics of the ethylene spacer and resulted in H-type spectroscopic aggregates in solid-state absorption spectroscopy. These results demonstrate that the optoelectronic properties of π-conjugated materials in the solid-state may be tailored systematically via side chain engineering, and hence that this approach has significant potential for the design of organic and polymer semiconductors.","Özen, Bilal; Tirani, Farzaneh Fadaei; Schenk, Kurt; Lin, Kun-Han; Scopelliti, Rosario; Corminboeuf, Clémence; Frauenrath, Holger",Chemistry,https://doi.org/10.1002/chem.202003113; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32894599/,114
112262,Factors Affecting the Preventability of Stroke-Reply.,2016,"BACKGROUND The efficacy of antibiotic prophylaxis for the prevention of surgical-site infection (SSI) after open tension-free inguinal hernia repair remains controversial. METHODS A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial was conducted. Patients who underwent elective open mesh-plug hernia repair were eligible for randomization. In the antibiotic prophylaxis group, 1.0 g cefazolin was intravenously administrated 30 minutes before the incision. In the placebo group, an equal volume of sterile saline was administered. The primary end point was the incidence of SSI. RESULTS A total of 200 patients were enrolled. SSI developed in 2 of 100 patients (2%) in the antibiotic prophylaxis group and 13 of 100 patients (13%) in the placebo group, indicating a significant difference between the 2 groups (relative risk ratio, 0.25; 95% confidence interval, 0.070 to 0.92; P = .003). Other complications occurred in 23 patients: 7 (7%) in the antibiotic prophylaxis group and 16 (16%) in the placebo group (P = .046). CONCLUSIONS This study indicates that antibiotic prophylaxis is effective for the prevention of SSI after open mesh-plug hernia repair.","Mazaki, Takero; Mado, Kazunari; Masuda, Hideki; Shiono, Motomi; Tochikura, Noahiro; Kaburagi, Morio",American journal of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amjsurg.2013.01.047; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24674827/,114
112353,"Ultra-processed food consumption, appetitive traits and BMI in children: a prospective study.",2020-09-23,"BACKGROUND Diagnosis of primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) still remains a challenge, especially with mutations in the Dynein Arm Heavy Chain 11 (DNAH11) gene. Classical diagnostic measures like Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) are not applicable for mutations in the DNAH11 gene since ultrastructural defects of the ciliary apparatus are absent. Novel mutations encoding for PCD appear all the time with considerable variation in the clinical picture, making it necessary to update data bases and guidelines for PCD diagnostics. METHODS In this study we examined two unrelated, Finnish families with symptoms of PCD applying the clinical scoring system: Primary ciliary dyskinesia Rule (PICADAR), high speed video microscopy analysis (HSVMA) for ciliary movement, a commercially available gene panel analysis and nasal Nitric Oxide (nNO) measurements if applicable. RESULTS Two, likely pathogenic variants in the DNAH11 gene (c.2341G > A, p. (Glu781Lys) ja c.7645 + 5G > A) were detected. In the first family, compound heterozygous mutations led to disease manifestation in two of 4 children, which showed a similar phenotype of cilia beating pattern but marked differences in disease severity. In the second family, all three children were homozygotes for the c.2341G > A p.(Glu781Lys) mutation and showed a similar degree of disease severity. However, the phenotype of cilia beating pattern was different ranging from stiff, static cilia to a hyperkinetic movement in one of these children. CONCLUSIONS In this study we describe two Finnish families with PCD, revealing two novel mutations in the DNAH11 gene which show considerable variety in the clinical and beating cilia phenotype. The results of this study show the clinician that PCD can be much milder than generally expected and diagnosis demands a combination of measures which are only successful in experienced hands. Chronic and repeatedly treated wet cough should raise suspicion of PCD, referring the patient for further diagnostics to a specialised PCD centre.","Schultz, Rüdiger; Elenius, Varpu; Lukkarinen, Heikki; Saarela, Tanja",BMC medical genetics,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12881-020-01171-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33243178/,114

We examined the relationship between race/ethnicity and psychological well-being and functioning in psychiatric outpatients. We analyzed intake data for 8,697 adult patients in psychiatry clinics in New England between 2008 and 2010. Patients rated psychological wellbeing using the Schwartz Outcome Scale (SOS-10); clinicians rated the Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF). In an analysis of variance with covariates, race/ethnicity exhibited a small but statistically significant association with GAF (F(4,8481)=17.902, p<.001) and SOS-10 scores (F(4,8165)=7.271, p<.001). However, after adjustment for physical health and socioeconomic variables, these differences became insignificant or were reversed. Our findings suggest that the relationship between race/ethnicity and mental health may be confounded by other socioeconomic or health differences and may be small compared with the effect of those variables.

Early identification of frailty may prevent, reduce and postpone adverse health outcomes. However, there is a need for additional evidence to guide decision-making for the care of frail patients since frail persons are frequently excluded from studies, the differential impact of frailty is often not examined in clinical trials and few large-scale clinical trials examining frail cohorts have been conducted. Randomised control trials (RCTs) published to date have used a diverse range of definitions of frailty, as well as a variety of outcome measures. The objective of this systematic review is to comprehensively characterise the frail populations enrolled and the end points reported in frailty RCTs. METHODS AND ANALYSIS We will identify all RCTs reporting on the outcome of interventions in adult (age ≥18 years) frail populations as defined by authors, in all settings of care. Databases will include MEDLINE, CINAHL, EMBASE, PsycInfo, Global Health, the Joanna Briggs database and Cochrane Library. Two reviewers will independently determine trial eligibility. For each included trial, we will conduct duplicate independent data extraction, inter-rater reliability, risk of bias assessment and evaluation of the quality of the evidence using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations approach. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION This systematic review will comprehensively identify RCTs including frail patients to identify how frailty is measured and which outcomes are reported. The results of this systematic review may inform clinicians caring for persons with frailty, facilitate conduct of future RCTs and inform future efforts to develop common data elements and core outcomes for frailty studies. Our findings will be disseminated through conference presentation and publication in peer-reviewed journals.

Radiological examinations, especially computed tomography (CT), play an important role in the fight against COVID-19. A comprehensive and timely review of radiological role in the fight against COVID-19 remains urgent and mandatory. Hence, the aim of this review is to summarize the radiological role in the fight against COVID-19. This review of current studies on COVID-19 provides insight into the radiological role in the detection, diagnosis, and monitoring for COVID-19. The typical radiological features of COVID-19 include bilateral, multifocal, and multilobar ground glass opacification with patchy consolidation, a peripheral/subpleural or posterior distribution (or both), mainly in the lower lobes. A combination of chest CT and repeat Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) testing may be beneficial for the diagnosis of COVID-19 in the setting of strongly clinical suspicion. Chest CT may improve the sensitivity for COVID-19 diagnosis, but patients' exposure to radiation should be kept as low as possible especially for children and pregnant women patients.","Hu, L; Wang, C",European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,https://doi.org/10.26355/eurrev_202004_21035; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32373990/,114

113732,Anorexia nervosa: COVID-19 pandemic period (Review).,2021-08-01,"INTRODUCTION The Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) provides a structured method for assessment of the level of consciousness. Its derived sum score is applied in research and adopted in intensive care unit scoring systems. Controversy exists on the reliability of the GCS. The aim of this systematic review was to summarize evidence on the reliability of the GCS. METHODS A literature search was undertaken in MEDLINE, EMBASE and CINAHL. Observational studies that assessed the reliability of the GCS, expressed by a statistical measure, were included. Methodological quality was evaluated with the consensus-based standards for the selection of health measurement instruments checklist and its influence on results considered. Reliability estimates were synthesized narratively. RESULTS We identified 52 relevant studies that showed significant heterogeneity in the type of reliability estimates used, patients studied, setting and characteristics of observers. Methodological quality was good (n = 7), fair (n = 18) or poor (n = 27). In good quality studies, kappa values were ≥0.6 in 85%, and all intraclass correlation coefficients indicated excellent reliability. Poor quality studies showed lower reliability estimates. Reliability for the GCS components was higher than for the sum score. Factors that may influence reliability include education and training, the level of consciousness and type of stimuli used. CONCLUSIONS Only 13% of studies were of good quality and inconsistency in reported reliability estimates was found. Although the reliability was adequate in good quality studies, further improvement is desirable. From a methodological perspective, the quality of reliability studies needs to be improved. From a clinical perspective, a renewed focus on training/education and standardization of assessment is required.","Reith, Florence C M; Van den Brande, Ruben; Synnot, Anneliese; Gruen, Russell; Maas, Andrew I R",Intensive care medicine,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00134-015-4124-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26564211/,114

This pandemic hit has a huge interference with three global crises: governance, economics, and migration (1). It is a new coronavirus infection, ""COVID-19"" (which is the acronym of ""coronavirus disease 2019""), first reported to the WHO Country Office in China on the 31st of December 2019 and detected in Wuhan, the largest metropolitan area in China's Hubei province (2), COVID-19 outbreak situation on 6 April 2020 was with more than 1 175 000 confirmed cases, more than 65 000 deaths and already reported in 209 countries (3). This new coronavirus belongs to the Orthocoronavirinae subfamily of the Coronaviridae family (order Nidovirales) and it is a positive-stranded RNA virus with a crown-like appearance under an electron microscope, SARS-CoV-2 belonging to the beta CoVs human category. It is sensitive to ultraviolet rays and heat and is inactivated by lipid solvents including ether (75%), ethanol, chlorine-containing disinfectant, peroxyacetic acid and chloroform (except for chlorhexidine) (4) Genomic analyses suggest that SARS-CoV-2 probably evolved from a strain found in bats. The mammalian host between bats and humans is not well known; also, it is not certain whether this intermediary really exists (5). The pathogenic mechanism inducing pneumonia is complex. The virus is capable of producing an excessive immune reaction in the host; for some patients, the disaster starts from a 'cytokine storm' with tissue damage (one of the protagonists is IL6) (6).","Hancu, Anca; Mihaltan, Florin",Maedica,https://doi.org/10.26574/maedica.2020.15.2.246; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32952690/,114
114470,Clinical pathway after robotic nephroureterectomy: omission of pelvic drain with next-day catheter removal and discharge.,2014,"INTRODUCTION Serious Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARSCoV2) has led to COVID 19 pandemic a year ago and it has not been globally taken under control yet. COVID 19 tends to have poorer prognosis in cancer patients. Additionally, we have no well-established guidelines for management of these patients during pandemic, in terms of treatment of 'cancer' and treatment of 'COVID 19'. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are given without any break in cancer patients to have better survival outcomes in daily routine. However, there is no well-established data to continue or delay ALK inhibitors in lung cancer patients infected with SARS-CoV2. Concomittant use of ALK inhibitors and COVID 19 antiviral treatment is a dilemma because of the lack of data in this area. CASE REPORT A 47-year old female metastatic ALK positive nonsquamous cell lung cancer patient on alectinib, a second generation ALK inhibitor was diagnosed with symptomatic COVID 19. She was given favipiravir for COVID 19 while continuing alectinib.Management and outcome: The patient continued alectinib during COVID 19 antiviral treatment without any break. She tolerated 'concomittant' alectinib & favipiravir. She had partial remission after three months of alectinib without any dose adjustment despite active COVID 19 medication. DISCUSSION To best of our knowledge, this is the first case who continued alectinib without dose adjustment during antiviral COVID-19 medication without clinically worsening. There is limited data about 'concomittant' use of TKIs and antiviral COVID 19 medication in the literature. There are some case reports, but they generally tended to delay or suspend TKIs during COVID 19 antiviral medication. Our case differs from them in terms of continuation of alectinib without any break or additional side effects during favipiravir for symptomatic COVID 19. We consider that our case might contribute to the literature in terms of management of cancer patients on targeted therapy during COVID 19 antiviral treatment. However, clinical trials are needed in this area.","Akkus, Mehmet Hadi; Kaman, Omur; Dogan, Mutlu",Journal of oncology pharmacy practice : official publication of the International Society of Oncology Pharmacy Practitioners,https://doi.org/10.1177/10781552211020100; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34038226/,114

This study investigated the efficacy of PGA mesh for reducing postoperative pancreatic fistula (POPF) and evaluated other risk factors for POPF. METHODS This study enrolled 464 consecutive patients who underwent PD performed by one surgeon between 2006 and 2015, including a PGA group of 281 patients (60.6%) and a control group of 183 patients (39.4%). All pancreatico-enteric anastomoses were performed using double-layered, duct-to-mucosa, end-to-side pancreaticojejunostomy. RESULTS Mean patient age was 63.1 years. The rates of overall (27.0% vs. 37.2%, P = 0.024) and clinically relevant (Grades B, C; 13.9% vs. 24.0%, P = 0.006) POPF were significantly lower in the PGA than in the control group. Following propensity score matching, the rates of clinically relevant POPF (12.6% vs. 22.4%, P = 0.024) and complications (40.2% vs. 63.8%, P < 0.001) remained significantly lower in the PGA group. Multivariate analysis showed that non-pancreatic disease, greater blood loss, higher body mass index, and non-application of PGA mesh were significantly associated with the development of clinically relevant POPF. CONCLUSIONS PGA mesh reinforcement of pancreaticojejunostomy may prevent POPF as well as reducing overall abdominal complications after PD.","Kang, Jae Seung; Han, Youngmin; Kim, Hongbeom; Kwon, Wooil; Kim, Sun-Whe; Jang, Jin-Young",Journal of hepato-biliary-pancreatic sciences,https://doi.org/10.1002/jhbp.428; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28054751/,114

114843,Repurposing Cancer Drugs for COVID-19.,2020-09-18,"OBJECTIVE Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is a noninvasive technique that allows monitoring of regional hemoglobin oxygen saturation (rSO2) values and might have a role in the diagnosis of peripheral arterial disease. We assessed the reproducibility and inter-subject variability of rSO2 values and rSO2 limb-to-arm ratios (LARs) in lower extremities of healthy subjects. METHODS The rSO2 values and rSO2 LARs were calculated in eight healthy subjects without peripheral arterial disease. The rSO2 values were measured at rest at six fixed spots at each lower limb and a reference spot at each upper arm. NIRS provided the rSO2 values without involvement of any other processing technique. After measurements were completed, rSO2 LARs were calculated by dividing the rSO2 value of a lower extremity spot by the rSO2 value of the arm. Measurements were performed twice on 1 day and repeated on 4 different days. RESULTS Mean coefficients of variation of measurements of rSO2 values and rSO2 LARs at the same spot in the same subject were respectively less than 6% and 8% for every measurement spot over time. Coefficients of variation of measurements at the same spot between different subjects were less than 15% and 19% for every measurement spot respectively.

A Comparison with Established Epidemiological Data.,2020-05-04,"The COVID-19 pandemic has presented both challenges and opportunities for those working in health and social care in the United Kingdom (UK). With much focus on secondary and acute care at this time, there has been less communication and understanding about the impact on primary care. This discussion paper is based on the experience of one of the authors working as a general practitioner/family doctor during the pandemic and rapid changes are described during this time (April 2020). Two important themes emerged from this experience focusing on the importance of supporting one another and new roles and ways of working. It can be argued that the challenges presented by COVID-19 have expedited positive and potentially sustainable change in UK primary care that has been needed for some time. The authors discuss the implications for future working and make a series of recommendations for primary care relating to the importance of supporting the workforce, remote consultations and communication, regular team meetings, and development of integrated care. It is suggested that many of the challenges highlighted can be addressed by placing a greater emphasis on the use of interprofessional education (IPE) to underpin and support effective collaborative working.","Gray, Richard; Sanders, Chris",Journal of interprofessional care,https://doi.org/10.1080/13561820.2020.1823948; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32962462/,114

DESIGN Observational comparative cross-sectional study by means of electronic questionnaire. SETTING Professional football. PARTICIPANTS A total of 468 female (mean age: 22.8 years) and 1134 male (mean age: 26.0 years) players participated. The non-COVID-19 comparison group consisted of 132 female (mean age: 23.1 years) and 175 male (mean age: 24.8 years) professional footballers. INTERVENTION N/A. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Anxiety symptoms were measured with the validated Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7 and depressive symptoms with the validated Patient Health Questionnaire 9. Both instruments have been widely used in both clinical and research settings among different populations, showing excellent psychometric properties. RESULTS During the COVID-19 emergency period, the 2-week prevalence of symptoms consistent with a diagnosis of generalized anxiety disorder and depression was 18.2% and 21.6%, respectively, among female professional footballers and 15.5% and 12.9%, respectively, among male players. The 2-week prevalence of anxiety and depressive symptoms among professional footballers was significantly higher during the COVID-19 emergency period than before the global pandemic (P < 0.01). Differences were most pronounced for those worried about the playing future. CONCLUSIONS The COVID-19 emergency period is associated with increased symptoms of anxiety and depression in professional footballers, especially among those worried about their future as players.","Gouttebarge, Vincent; Ahmad, Imtiaz; Mountjoy, Margo; Rice, Simon; Kerkhoffs, Gino",Clinical journal of sport medicine : official journal of the Canadian Academy of Sport Medicine,https://doi.org/10.1097/jsm.0000000000000886; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32941374/,114

Given the shortage of specialty palliative care providers, there is a pressing need to improve the palliative care skills of internal medicine (IM) residents, who have a central role in the care of seriously ill patients hospitalized at academic medical centers. METHODS We conducted an anonymous survey of IM residents at a large, urban, academic medical center to identify which aspects of palliative care trainees find most important and their knowledge gaps in palliative care. The survey measured trainees' self-assessed degree of importance and knowledge of core palliative care skills and evaluated frequency of completing advance care planning documentation. RESULTS Overall, 51 (23%) IM residents completed the survey. The majority of trainees considered multiple palliative care skills to be ""very important/important"": symptom management, prognostication, introducing the palliative care approach, discussing code status, and breaking serious news. Across these same skills, trainees reported variable levels of knowledge. In our sample, trainees reported completing healthcare proxy forms and Medical Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment infrequently. CONCLUSIONS IM trainees rated core palliative care skills as important to their practice. Yet, they reported knowledge gaps across multiple core palliative care skills that should be addressed given their role as frontline providers for patients with serious illness.","Frydman, Julia L; Hauck, Kevin; Lowy, Joseph; Gelfman, Laura P",The American journal of hospice & palliative care,https://doi.org/10.1177/1049909120987207; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33478256/,114

We propose that people commonly respond to health threats by managing their emotions with cognitive strategies such as reappraisal, which can reduce fear and protect mental health. However, because fear can also motivate health behaviors, reducing fear may also jeopardize health behaviors. In two diverse U.S. samples (N = 1,241) tracked across 3 months, sequential and cross-lagged panel mediation models indicated that reappraisal predicted lower fear about an ongoing health threat (COVID-19) and, in turn, better mental health but fewer recommended physical health behaviors. This trade-off was not inevitable, however: The use of reappraisal to increase socially oriented positive emotions predicted better mental health without jeopardizing physical health behaviors. Examining the costs and benefits of how people cope with health threats is essential for promoting better health outcomes for individuals and communities.","Smith, Angela M; Willroth, Emily C; Gatchpazian, Arasteh; Shallcross, Amanda J; Feinberg, Matthew; Ford, Brett Q",Psychological science,https://doi.org/10.1177/09567976211024260; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34143697/,114

117493,The impact of influenza vaccination on cardiovascular disease.,2021-04-05,"Over the past five decades, scientists have been documenting negative anthropogenic environmental change, expressing increasing alarm and urging dramatic socioecological transformation in response. A host of international meetings have been held but the erosion of biological diversity continues to accelerate. The lack of effective political action begs the question as to why. Herein we contend that part of the answer may lie in the anthropocentric ethical premises and moral rhetoric typically deployed in the cause of conservation. We further argue that it is essential to advance moral arguments for biodiversity conservation that are not just based on perceived human interests but on ecocentric values, namely, convictions that species and ecosystems have value and interests that should be respected regardless of whether they serve human needs and aspirations. A broader array of moral rationales for biodiversity conservation, we conclude, would be more likely to lead to effective plans, adopted and enforced by governments, that are designed to conserve biological diversity. A good place to start in this regard would be to explicitly incorporate ecocentric values into the recommendations that will be made at the conclusion of the fifteenth meeting of the parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity, which has been scheduled to be held in Kunming, China, in October 2020.

SUMMARY An 86-year-old man on dabigatran etexilate 110 mg twice daily for stroke prevention with atrial fibrillation was admitted to the hospital for bowel obstruction and severe acute kidney injury on chronic kidney disease. The patient had an abnormal coagulation profile and no history of bleeding. Initial laboratory values revealed a hemoglobin concentration of 10.7 g/dL, a platelet count of 115 × 103 platelets/μL, an activated partial thromboplastin time of 150.4 seconds, an international normalized ratio of 10.28, a thrombin time greater than 100 seconds and a serum creatinine of 5.54 mg/dL (490 μmol/L). An initial dose of idarucizumab was administered 1 hour prior to surgery to prevent bleeding. Significant bleeding and hemodynamic instability occurred following surgery. Three additional doses of idarucizumab, 2 sessions of intermittent hemodialysis, continuous venovenous hemofiltration and blood products were required to achieve normalization of coagulation parameters and hemodynamic stability due to rebound coagulopathy after each dose of idarucizumab. CONCLUSION Acute kidney injury on chronic kidney disease and third-space redistribution could have led to important dabigatran accumulation and favored rebound coagulopathy. Multiple therapeutic approaches may be required in the management of complex dabigatran intoxication.","Flynn, Francis; Richard, Guillaume; Dobrescu, Marc A; Bouchard, Josée; Williamson, David; Brindamour, Dave; Charbonney, Emmanuel; Dupuis, Sébastien",Journal of pharmacy practice,https://doi.org/10.1177/0897190020961691; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32985337/,114

TECHNIQUE We describe our technique for a one-stage hand-assisted minimally invasive esophagectomy that allows sequential access to the chest and abdomen within the same surgical field, eliminating the need for repositioning. The patient is positioned in a ""corkscrew"" configuration with the abdomen supine and the chest rotated to the left to allow access to the right chest. The abdomen and chest are prepped into a single operative field. This technique allows sequential access to the abdomen for gastric mobilization, chest for division of the esophagus, abdomen for construction of the gastric conduit, and chest for intrathoracic anastomosis. CONCLUSION This approach enables extracorporeal construction of the conduit, which helps ensure a clear distal margin on the specimen and facilitates conduit length by placing the stomach on stretch during stapling.","Motz, Benjamin M; Lorimer, Patrick D; Boselli, Danielle; Symanowski, James T; Reames, Mark K; Hill, Joshua S; Salo, Jonathan C",Journal of gastrointestinal surgery : official journal of the Society for Surgery of the Alimentary Tract,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11605-018-4063-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30623378/,114
118409,Systematic Review of the Use of Phytochemicals for Management of Pain in Cancer Therapy.,2015,"Rotavirus is a major cause of gastroenteritis in children, with infection typically inducing high levels of protective antibodies. Antibodies targeting the middle capsid protein VP6 are particularly abundant, and as VP6 is only exposed inside cells, neutralisation must be post-entry. However, while a system of poly immune globulin receptor (pIgR) transcytosis has been proposed for anti-VP6 IgAs, the mechanism by which VP6-specific IgG mediates protection remains less clear. We have developed an intracellular neutralisation assay to examine how antibodies neutralise rotavirus inside cells, enabling comparison between IgG and IgA isotypes. Unexpectedly we found that neutralisation by VP6-specific IgG was much more efficient than by VP6-specific IgA. This observation was highly dependent on the activity of the cytosolic antibody receptor TRIM21 and was confirmed using an in vivo model of murine rotavirus infection. Furthermore, mice deficient in only IgG and not other antibody isotypes had a serious deficit in intracellular antibody-mediated protection. The finding that VP6-specific IgG protect mice against rotavirus infection has important implications for rotavirus vaccination. Current assays determine protection in humans predominantly by measuring rotavirus-specific IgA titres. Measurements of VP6-specific IgG may add to existing mechanistic correlates of protection.","Caddy, Sarah L; Vaysburd, Marina; Wing, Mark; Foss, Stian; Andersen, Jan Terje; O'Connell, Kevin; Mayes, Keith; Higginson, Katie; Iturriza-Gómara, Miren; Desselberger, Ulrich; James, Leo C",PLoS pathogens,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1008732; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32750093/,114
118580,CD74-NRG1 fusions in lung adenocarcinoma.,2014,"Quantitative analysis of glycans released from glycoproteins using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) requires fluorescent tag labeling to enhance sensitivity and selectivity. However, the methods required to remove large amounts of excess labeling reagents from the reaction mixture are time-consuming. Furthermore, these methods, including solvent extraction and solid phase extraction (SPE), often impair quantitative analysis. Here, we developed an online sample cleanup procedure for HPLC analysis of 2-aminopyridine (AP)-labeled glycans using a six-port/two-way valve and two small columns: one packed with a strong cation exchange resin (SCX) and the other comprising ODS silica gel. AP-labeled glycans delivered from an injection port were separated from excess AP by passing through an SCX column (4.6 mm i.d., 1 cm long) regulated to 40°C. The AP-labeled glycans were trapped on an ODS column (4.6 mm i.d., 1 cm long) to further separate them from inorganic contaminants. By changing the valve position after 2 min to connect the ODS column to an analysis column, AP-labeled glycans trapped in the ODS column were eluted with an acetonitrile-containing eluent followed by hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) separation on an amide column or reversed-phase mode separation on a C30 column. This method was successfully used to analyze N-linked glycans released from several glycoprotein samples.","Kishimoto, Yuka; Okada, Fuka; Maesako, Tomohiro; Yamamoto, Sachio; Kinoshita, Mitsuhiro; Hayakawa, Takao; Suzuki, Shigeo",Journal of chromatography.

We aim to synthesize the literature on the use of NLP to process or analyze symptom information documented in EHR free-text narratives. MATERIALS AND METHODS Our search of 1964 records from PubMed and EMBASE was narrowed to 27 eligible articles. Data related to the purpose, free-text corpus, patients, symptoms, NLP methodology, evaluation metrics, and quality indicators were extracted for each study. RESULTS Symptom-related information was presented as a primary outcome in 14 studies. EHR narratives represented various inpatient and outpatient clinical specialties, with general, cardiology, and mental health occurring most frequently. Studies encompassed a wide variety of symptoms, including shortness of breath, pain, nausea, dizziness, disturbed sleep, constipation, and depressed mood. NLP approaches included previously developed NLP tools, classification methods, and manually curated rule-based processing. Only one-third (n = 9) of studies reported patient demographic characteristics. DISCUSSION NLP is used to extract information from EHR free-text narratives written by a variety of healthcare providers on an expansive range of symptoms across diverse clinical specialties. The current focus of this field is on the development of methods to extract symptom information and the use of symptom information for disease classification tasks rather than the examination of symptoms themselves. CONCLUSION Future NLP studies should concentrate on the investigation of symptoms and symptom documentation in EHR free-text narratives. Efforts should be undertaken to examine patient characteristics and make symptom-related NLP algorithms or pipelines and vocabularies openly available.","Koleck, Theresa A; Dreisbach, Caitlin; Bourne, Philip E; Bakken, Suzanne",Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA,https://doi.org/10.1093/jamia/ocy173; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30726935/,114

119441,Pembrolizumab in the adjuvant treatment of melanoma: efficacy and safety.,2021-01-28,"BACKGROUND Thyroid nodules have a low prevalence of malignancy and most proven cancers do not behave aggressively. Thus, risk-stratification of nodules is a critical step to avoid surgical overtreatment. We hypothesized that a risk management system superior to those currently in use could be created to reduce the number of clinically indeterminate nodules (i.e., the ""gray zone"") by concurrently considering the malignancy risks conferred by clinical, ultrasonographic, and cytologic variables. METHODS Thyroidectomy cases were reviewed from three institutions. Their benign versus malignant outcome was used to evaluate the variables for correlation. A binary logistic regression model was trained and, using indeterminate nodules with Bethesda III and IV results, validated. A scoring nomogram was designed to demonstrate the application of the model in clinical practice. RESULTS One hundred thirty thyroidectomies (28% malignant) met inclusion criteria. The final logistic regression model included difficulty in swallowing, hypothyroidism, echogenicity, hypervascularity, margins, calcification, and cytology diagnosis as input parameters. The model was highly successful in determining the outcome (p value: 0.001) with a R2 (Nagelkerke) score of 0.93. The area under the curve as determined by receiver operating characteristics was 0.91. The accuracy of the model on the training dataset was 93% (sensitivity and specificity 92% and 96%, respectively) and, on the validation dataset, 80% (sensitivity and specificity 91% and 67%, respectively). CONCLUSIONS We report a model for risk assessment of thyroid nodules that has the potential to significantly reduce indeterminates and surgical overtreatment.

We performed a retrospective observational analysis of the moderate-to-severe psoriasis patients under ceratolizumab pegol therapy. Primer endpoints were efficacy of CZP, defined as statistically significant improvement of PASI, PGA, and cDAPSA in the 24 week of therapy. Secondary endpoints were safety of CZP especially during COVID-19 pandemic. Fifty-six moderate-to-severe psoriasis patients treated with CZP were evaluated retrospectively. We observed a rapid and significiant reduction of PASI, PGA and c DAPSA scores in W4. After loading dose we observed loss of clinical efficacy of CZP in 8 patients and optimized therapy by increasing the dosing of CZP. Dose escalation of CZP permitted the achievement and long-term maintenance of clinical improvement in these patients. We compare the clinical efficacy of CZP between naive and patients who has been treated with other biologic agents. There were no statistical differences in efficacy between these two groups. No side effects were observed during CZP treatment. There were no cases of death from COVID-related disease in our study population or patients hospitalized for COVID-19 related disease.

However, remifentanil results in hyperalgesia and increases postoperative opioid requirements. Local anesthetic infiltration is alternative methods to opioid for providing analgesia. However, otologists avoids its use as it can abolish the ESRT. We investigated the effect of the preemptive local anesthetic infiltration on intraoperative ESRT and opioid requirements in pediatric cochlear implant surgery performed under TIVA. Material and Methods Prospective, randomized, double-blinded, controlled study including 70 child undergoing cochlear implant under TIVA were randomly assigned to a local anesthesia (LA group, n = 35) or control (CT group, N = 35). The primary outcome was the total tramadol consumption during the first 24 h postoperative, and the secondary outcomes were time to first analgesia request, postoperative pain scores, the ESRT and, propofol and remifentanil requirements. The incidence of postoperative vomiting was recorder as well. Results The total tramadol consumption during the first 24 h after surgery was significantly less in the LA group than in CT group (8.25 [4.3] vs. 16.5 [6.57] mg, P < 0.01). The time to first analgesic request was significantly prolonged in the LA group as compared with the CT group [8 [2-12] vs. 3 [0-8] h, P < 0.01). The postoperative Faces, Legs, Activity, Cry Consolability pain scores were significantly lower in the LA group at 15 min, 30 min, 2, 4 and 6 h postoperative. Mean remifentanil infusion rate [mean (standard deviation)] was significantly higher in in the CT group than in the LA group [0.7 (0.3) vs. 0.5 (0.2) μg/kg/min; P = 0.001).The ESRT response, propofol requirements, and the incidence of postoperative vomiting had no significant differences between both groups.

120301,Clinical Practice Guidelines for the Use of Video Capsule Endoscopy.,2017,"BACKGROUND An intestinal ostomy is an artificial bowel opening created on the skin. Procedure-related mortality is extremely rare. However, the presence of an ostomy may be associated with significant morbidity. Complications negatively affect the quality of life of ostomates. Preoperative stoma site marking can reduce stoma-related complications and is recommended by several guidelines. However, there is no consensus on the procedure and recommendations are based on low-quality evidence. The objective of the systematic review will be to investigate if preoperative stoma site marking compared to no preoperative marking in patients undergoing intestinal stoma surgery reduces or prevents the rate of stoma-related complications. METHODS We will include (cluster-) randomised controlled trials and cohort studies that involve patients with intestinal ostomies comparing preoperative stoma site marking to no preoperative marking and report at least one patient-relevant outcome. For study identification, we will systematically search MEDLINE/PubMed, EMBASE, CENTRAL and CINHAL as well as Google Scholar, trial registries, conference proceedings and reference lists. Additionally, we will contact experts in the field. Two reviewers will independently perform study selection and data extraction. Outcomes will be prioritised based on findings from telephone interviews with five ostomates and five ostomy and wound nurses prior to conducting the review. Outcomes may include but are not limited to stoma-related complications (infection, parastomal abscess, hernia, mucocutaneous separation, dermatological complications, stoma necrosis, stenosis, retraction and prolapse) or other patient-relevant postoperative endpoints (quality of life, revision rate, dependence on professional care, mortality, length of stay and readmission). We will use the ROBINS-I or the Cochrane risk of bias tool to assess the risk of bias of the included studies. We will perform a meta-analysis and assess the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach. DISCUSSION With the results of the systematic review, we aim to provide information for future clinical guidelines and influence clinical routine with regard to preoperative stoma site marking in patients undergoing ostomy surgery. When the evidence of our systematic review is low, it would still be a useful basis for future clinical trials by identifying data gaps.

120403,School Reopening-The Pandemic Issue That Is Not Getting Its Due.,2020-05-13,"A novel and highly pathogenic coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has caused an outbreak in Wuhan city, Hubei province of China since December 2019, and soon spread nationwide and spilled over to other countries around the world1-3. To better understand the initial step of infection at an atomic level, we determined the crystal structure of the SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) bound to the cell receptor ACE2 at 2.45 Å resolution. The overall ACE2-binding mode of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD is nearly identical to that of the SARS-CoV RBD, which also utilizes ACE2 as the cell receptor4. Structural analysis identified residues in the SARS-CoV-2 RBD that are critical for ACE2 binding, the majority of which either are highly conserved or share similar side chain properties with those in the SARS-CoV RBD. Such similarity in structure and sequence strongly argue for convergent evolution between the SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV RBDs for improved binding to ACE2, although SARS-CoV-2 does not cluster within SARS and SARS-related coronaviruses1-3,5. The epitopes of two SARS-CoV antibodies targeting the RBD are also analysed with the SARS-CoV-2 RBD, providing insights into the future identification of cross-reactive antibodies.","Lan, Jun; Ge, Jiwan; Yu, Jinfang; Shan, Sisi; Zhou, Huan; Fan, Shilong; Zhang, Qi; Shi, Xuanling; Wang, Qisheng; Zhang, Linqi; Wang, Xinquan",Nature,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-020-2180-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32225176/,114

Poor care transitions can result in delays, medication mistakes, incomplete follow-up care, and adverse health outcomes. Ensuring a smooth and effective care transition is the goal for providers at both the hospital and SNF. At its foundation, successful care transitions rely on teamwork, relationship building, and communication among diverse groups of providers. Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC) developed the ECHO-CT (Extension for Community Healthcare Outcomes-Care Transitions) program to improve transitions of care through structured, bi-directional communication between hospital-based and SNF-based providers. This paper describes key strategies for success in this model including: facilitating teamwork, eliminating hierarchy, and encouraging a bi-directional learning environment. We propose these as strategies that could be implemented in other organizations seeking to improve value during transitions of care.","Junge-Maughan, Lauren; Moore, Amber; Lipsitz, Lewis",Journal of interprofessional care,https://doi.org/10.1080/13561820.2020.1798900; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32811238/,114

OBJECTIVE This study aimed to investigate the effect of closed suction (CS), catheter size, and the use of active post-suction sighs on tracheal pressure (P(trach)), and global and regional end-expiratory lung volume (EELV) during HFJV. METHODS Six anaesthetized and muscle-relaxed adult rabbits were stabilized on HFJV. CS was performed using all permutations of three CS methods (Continual negative pressure, negative pressure applied during Withdrawal, and HFJV in Standby) and 6 French gauge (6 FG) and 8 French gauge (8 FG) catheter, randomly assigned. The sequence was repeated using post-suction sighs. P(trach), absolute (respiratory inductive plethysmography) and regional (electrical impedance tomography; expressed as percentage of vital capacity for the defined region of interest, %Z(VCroi) ) EELV were measured before, during and 60 sec post-suction. RESULTS CS methods exerted no difference on ΔP(trach), ΔEELV(RIP), or Δ%Z(VCroi) . 8FG catheter resulted in a mean (95%CI) 20.0 (17.9,22.2) cm H(2)O greater loss of P(trach) during suction compared to 6FG (Bonferroni post-test). Mean (± SD) ΔEELV(RIP) was -6(±3) and -2(±1) ml/kg with the 8 and 6 FG catheters (P < 0.0001; Bonferroni post-test). ΔEELV was 31.7 (21.1,42.4) %Z(VCroi) and 24.8 (10.9,38.7) %Z(VCroi) greater in the ventral and dorsal hemithoraces using the 8 FG. Only after 8 FG CS was post-suction recruitment required to restore EELV. CONCLUSIONS In this animal model receiving HFJV, ΔP(trach), ΔEELV, and need for post-suction recruitment during CS were most influenced by catheter size. Volume changes within the lung were uniform.","Hepponstall, J Michele; Tingay, David G; Bhatia, Risha; Loughnan, Peter M; Copnell, Beverley",Pediatric pulmonology,https://doi.org/10.1002/ppul.21607; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22290736/,114

However, little is known about families of children with Neurodevelopmental Disorder (NDD). The present study investigated parental stress, coparenting, and child adjustment in Italian families with children with NDD (N = 82) and typical developing children (TD, N = 82) during lockdown, using an online survey. Results of quantitative analyses showed a significant increase in parental stress and child externalizing behaviors, but not of coparenting. Parental stress is predicted by externalizing behaviors, and coparenting acted as a moderator in the relationship between the change in the amount of time spent with the children before and during lockdown and parental stress. In children with NDD, the decrease in therapeutic/rehabilitation support predicted higher externalizing behaviors. Qualitative analysis showed that beyond the difficulties and worries arising during lockdown, most of the parents appreciated the opportunity of spending more time with their children and strengthening the parent-child relationship. In conclusion, our results point out the importance of ensuring continuity of care for children with NDD (e.g. telehealth) during home confinement and of providing psychological support for parents.","Bentenuto, Arianna; Mazzoni, Noemi; Giannotti, Michele; Venuti, Paola; de Falco, Simona",Research in developmental disabilities,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ridd.2020.103840; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33383468/,114

The number of COVID-19 patients increased in Japan from late March to early April 2020. Since COVID-19 treatment methods with antiviral drugs were not established in March 2020, clinical trials began at a rapid pace worldwide. We participated in a global investigator-initiated clinical trial of the antiviral drug remdesivir. It took approximately two months to prepare for and start patient enrollment, 26 days to enroll all patients in Japan, and 32 days from the end of enrollment to the release of the first report, a fairly quick response overall. In the course of this clinical trial, we found some of the critical issues related to conducting an infectious disease clinical trial in Japan need to be addressed and tackled to support a rapid response. These included such things as the necessity of a research network to promote clinical research, a framework for a rapid review system of clinical trial notification, and better cooperation with outsourced teams. Furthermore, for Japan to take the lead in global collaborative research and development in the field of infectious diseases, it is necessary to develop further human resources and organization on a national basis. It is indispensable for Japan to establish a clinical trial system at the national level to prepare for future emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases.","Saito, Sho; Hayakawa, Kayoko; Mikami, Ayako; Izumi, Shinyu; Funazaki, Hideki; Ashida, Shinobu; Sugiura, Wataru; Sugiyama, Haruhito; Kokudo, Norihiro; Ohmagari, Norio",Global health & medicine,https://doi.org/10.35772/ghm.2020.01106; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33937567/,114
122181,Polymorphisms and haplotype of mitochondrial DNA D-loop region are associated with polycystic ovary syndrome in a Chinese population.,2020-12-29,"BACKGROUND Stapling devices for creating anastomosis in internal organs are commonly used during surgery. Despite the obvious advantages of shortened procedure duration and fewer complications to manual suturing, staple-line leakage during intestinal anastomosis likely relates to the interaction between the staples and the tissue and to the tissue mechanical properties. The authors studied the deformation pattern close to the anastomosis to learn more about the mechanism involved in leakage. METHODS End-to-end anastomosis in pig small intestine was done using 21-mm circular staplers. Distension with pressure up to 100 cm H2O was done on the anastomosed segment. Surface markers were tracked using a microscope and a CCD camera. Circumferential and longitudinal strains were computed. RESULTS The staples restricted the deformation both in circumferential and longitudinal directions and induced a heterogeneous strain distribution. Circumferential strains were bigger between the staples (range 0.5-1) than inside the staples (range 0-0.3). The longitudinal strain ranged from 0 to slightly negative between the staples, indicating longitudinal compression. The negative strains turned into positive strains with increasing distance from the anastomosis. Further away from the anastomosis the longitudinal strain was in the range 0.3 to 0.5. CONCLUSION The surface strain field was heterogeneously close to the stapled anastomosis. The longitudinal compression between staples in the longitudinal direction during inflation may have a beneficial effect preventing leakage, a phenomenon that needs further studies. The method may be useful in the design and validation of new staplers.","Yang, Jian; Soltz, Michael; Russell, Heinrich; Beres, Jeff; Zhao, Jingbo; Liao, Donghua; Gregersen, Hans",Surgical innovation,https://doi.org/10.1177/1553350611426566; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22075437/,114

A major limit is the low pathogen load compared to the high background of host nucleic acids. To overcome this issue, several solutions exist, such as applying a very high depth of sequencing, or performing a relative enrichment of viral genomes associated with capsids. At the end, the quantity of total nucleic acids is often below the concentrations recommended by the manufacturers of library kits, which necessitates to random amplify nucleic acids. Using a pool of 26 viruses representative of viral diversity, we observed a deep impact of the nature of sample (total nucleic acids versus RNA only), the reverse transcription, the random amplification and library construction method on virus recovery. We further optimized the two most promising methods and assessed their performance with fully characterized reference virus stocks. Good genome coverage and limit of detection lower than 100 or 1000 genome copies per mL of plasma, depending on the genome viral type, were obtained from a three million reads dataset. Our study reveals that optimized random amplification is a technique of choice when insufficient amounts of nucleic acid are available for direct libraries constructions.","Regnault, Béatrice; Bigot, Thomas; Ma, Laurence; Pérot, Philippe; Temmam, Sarah; Eloit, Marc",Viruses,https://doi.org/10.3390/v13020253; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33562285/,114

METHODS Cohort of hospitalized patients with TIA and stroke discharged alive from a large university hospital in Norway, and their informal caregivers. Questionnaires at 3 and 12 months post discharge were filled out by caregivers (n = 320 and n = 326, respectively) and survivors (n = 368 and n = 383, respectively). Multivariable linear regression analyses tested associations between initial stroke severity (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale, NIHSS) and HRQoL (EQ-5D-3L) in caregivers and survivors. RESULTS Caregivers of survivors with TIA or stroke did not report lower HRQoL than matched norms. There was some evidence of an association of the NIHSS with caregiver HRQoL at 3 months only (age-sex-adjusted coefficient - 0.01, p = 0.008), however, this was attenuated after additional adjustments. Survivors with stroke, but not TIA, reported lower HRQoL than population norms at both time points. There was a negative association between higher NIHSS scores and survivors' HRQoL; fully adjusted coefficient - 0.01 at both time points (p = 0.001). CONCLUSION The informal caregivers and survivors with TIA did not report lower than expected HRQoL. Increasing stroke severity was associated with decreasing HRQoL among survivors, but had limited predictive value among caregivers. Other factors may therefore be better indicators of 'at risk' caregivers.","Labberton, Angela S; Augestad, Liv Ariane; Thommessen, Bente; Barra, Mathias","Quality of life research : an international journal of quality of life aspects of treatment, care and rehabilitation",https://doi.org/10.1007/s11136-020-02516-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32388786/,114
122534,Interval Colorectal Cancer After Colonoscopy: Exploring Explanations and Solutions.,2015,"Studies of 'cost and value' in anatomical sciences education examine not only what works, but at what cost, thus evaluating the inputs and outputs of education. This research provides insights into how to use available resources (e.g. academic time, budgets, infrastructure) as a mechanism to obtaining the maximum outcomes available. The purpose of this viewpoint article is to expand on the application of cost and value concepts to anatomical sciences education, contextualizing these concepts through a deeper dive into the more costly educational approaches of human donor dissection. In do so, both questions and opportunities are raised for the discipline of anatomical sciences going forward. Educational decisions, inclusive of cost and value appraisals, consider the range of outcomes for which the activity is designed to achieve, and the activity's integration with the philosophy of the educational program it is contributing to; these decisions, thus, evaluate more than just cost alone. Healthcare students' engagement with human donor dissection pedagogy offers an array of reported non-economic benefits, including non-traditional discipline-independent skill (NDIS) development (e.g., professionalism, teamwork skills). These skills are often harder to measure, but are no less important to the final pedagogical decision-making process. The goal of cost and value research is to create an evidence-base towards education that delivers maximum value for a given spend. Anatomy educators, researchers, and decision-makers who embrace cost and value dialogue, and interpret and apply findings from studies of educational costs, are best positioned to improve the educational value for their learners, and provide effective outputs for all stakeholders.","Maloney, Stephen; Pather, Nalini; Foo, Jonathan; Lazarus, Michelle D",Anatomical sciences education,https://doi.org/10.1002/ase.2027; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33068329/,114

Since type I interferon (IFNαβ) and type III interferon (IFNλ) are potent antiviral cytokines with immunomodulatory potential, we assessed their efficacy as IAV treatments. IFNλ treatment of IAV-infected Mx1-positive mice lowered viral load and protected from disease. IFNα treatment also restricted IAV replication but exacerbated disease. IFNα treatment increased pulmonary proinflammatory cytokine secretion, innate cell recruitment and epithelial cell death, unlike IFNλ-treatment. IFNλ lacked the direct stimulatory activity of IFNα on immune cells. In epithelia, both IFNs induced antiviral genes but no inflammatory cytokines. Similarly, human airway epithelia responded to both IFNα and IFNλ by induction of antiviral genes but not of cytokines, while hPBMCs responded only to IFNα. The restriction of both IFNλ responsiveness and productive IAV replication to pulmonary epithelia allows IFNλ to limit IAV spread through antiviral gene induction in relevant cells without overstimulating the immune system and driving immunopathology. We propose IFNλ as a non-inflammatory and hence superior treatment option for human IAV infection.","Davidson, Sophia; McCabe, Teresa M; Crotta, Stefania; Gad, Hans Henrik; Hessel, Edith M; Beinke, Soren; Hartmann, Rune; Wack, Andreas",EMBO molecular medicine,https://doi.org/10.15252/emmm.201606413; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27520969/,114

Based on Mpro inhibitors screening, 12 322 potential active components were obtained, and the representative active components included aster pentapeptide A, ligustrazine, salvianolic acid B, etc., and Zingiberis Rhizoma Recens, Asteris Radix et Rhizoma, Notoginseng Radix et Rhizoma, Chuanxiong Rhizoma, Salviae Miltiorrhizae Radix et Rhizoma, Zingiberis Rhizoma, Dianthi Herba, Rhei Radix et Rhizoma, Cistanches Herba were obtained. While 11 294 potential active ingredients were obtained by PLP inhibitor screening, representative active ingredients included gingerketophenol, ginkgol alcohol, ferulic acid, etc., and Codonopsis Radix, Notopterygii Rhizoma et Radix, Zingiberis Rhizoma Recens, Ginkgo Semen, Chuanxiong Rhizoma, Trichosanthis Fructus, Paeoniae Radix Alba, Psoraleae Fructus, Sophorae Flavescentis Radix, Notoginseng Radix et Rhizoma, Angelicae Sinensis Radix were chosen. By combining the diagnosis and treatment scheme of Hunan province's and angiotensin converting enzyme 2(ACE2) inhibitors screening from literature, present study also discussed the rational application of candidate herbs to this epidemic situation. Trichosanthis Fructus obtained by PLP inhibitors screening and Fritillaria verticillata obtained by ACE2 inhibitors screening were parts of the Sangbei Zhisou Powder and Xiaoxianxiong Decoction, which might be applicable to the syndromes of cough and dyspnea. Rhei Radix et Rhizoma screened by Mpro and Trichosanthis Fructus screened by PLP were contained in Maxing Shigan Decoction and Xuanbai Chengqi Decoction, and could be applied to the syndromes of epidemic virus blocking lung. Mori Folium, Lonicerae Japonicae Flos and Forsythiae Fructus obtained by ACE2 inhibitors screening were included in the Sangju Decoction and Yinqiaosan, which might be applicable to the syndromes of warm pathogen attacking lung and cough and dyspnea. The results of this study are intended to provide a reference for the further development of traditional Chinese medicine to deal with the new epidemic.","Ma, Jing; Huo, Xiao-Qian; Chen, Xi; Zhu, Wei-Xing; Yao, Mei-Cun; Qiao, Yan-Jiang; Zhang, Yan-Ling",Zhongguo Zhong yao za zhi = Zhongguo zhongyao zazhi = China journal of Chinese materia medica,https://doi.org/10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20200216.401; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32281328/,114

Most alarming is that children are especially at risk. Although many studies demonstrate that the majority of trafficked persons surveyed engage with the health-care system during the time in which they are trafficked, health-care practitioners lack the knowledge, tools and resources to assist these patients. The present efforts in training health-care professionals have been fragmented and largely ineffective. While prior training has produced short-term changes in knowledge or attitudes of health professionals, it has not produced sustained changes in knowledge and attitudes nor meaningful changes in screening or intervention. No training has demonstrated changes in patient outcomes. Trafficked persons, particularly children and survivors of labour trafficking, are inadequately served by our present training options for health-care practitioners, and evidence-based protocols are needed to care for this underserved, disenfranchised and traumatised population. To provide optimal care for trafficked youth, health-care practitioners may benefit from: (i) evaluating training for health care providers (HCP) rigorously and meaningfully; (ii) advocating for high-quality training for all HCPs; (iii) fostering partnerships with key stakeholders to inform training and practice; and (iv) designing HCP training that is comprehensive, spanning all forms of human trafficking and including all populations involved.","Coughlin, Catherine G; Greenbaum, Jordan; Titchen, Kanani",Journal of paediatrics and child health,https://doi.org/10.1111/jpc.15116; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32815607/,114

To limit the spread of infection, the government issued a national social lockdown. The obstetrical-gynaecological emergencies and essential services were guaranteed to protect pregnant women's health, and a return to a medicalised childbirth was necessary. This situation could had amplified risk factors on the psychological wellbeing of mothers-to-be. Indeed, the last trimester of pregnancy is a period of increased vulnerability itself.Method: For better support women who experience pregnancy during social lockdown, we explored the impact of COVID-19 on psychic wellbeing of two samples of pregnant women (40 living in Lombardy and 35 in Tuscany).Results: T-test and correlations analyses revealed that women living in the Lombardy had a higher perception of the centrality of COVID-19. Further, women that considered the pandemic as a significant event, experienced a higher perinatal depressive symptom. Those symptoms also arose in women who presented a higher number of intrusion and hyperarousal symptoms and a lower ability to plan.Conclusion: Pregnant women should be closely monitored and supported, especially those who live in high-risk areas, such as Lombardy Region.

125564,Biochemical analysis of cytokeratin fragment 21-1 concentration and expression of cytokeratin 19 in oral potentially malignant disorders.,2020,"The complexity associated with an epidemic defies any quantitatively reliable predictive theoretical scheme. Here, we pursue a generalized mathematical model and cellular automata simulations to study the dynamics of infectious diseases and apply it in the context of the COVID-19 spread. Our model is inspired by the theory of coupled chemical reactions to treat multiple parallel reaction pathways. We essentially ask the question: how hard could the time evolution toward the desired herd immunity (HI) be on the lives of people? We demonstrate that the answer to this question requires the study of two implicit functions, which are determined by several rate constants, which are time-dependent themselves. Implementation of different strategies to counter the spread of the disease requires a certain degree of a quantitative understanding of the time-dependence of the outcome. Here, we compartmentalize the susceptible population into two categories, (i) vulnerables and (ii) resilients (including asymptomatic carriers), and study the dynamical evolution of the disease progression. We obtain the relative fatality of these two sub-categories as a function of the percentages of the vulnerable and resilient population and the complex dependence on the rate of attainment of herd immunity. We attempt to study and quantify possible adverse effects of the progression rate of the epidemic on the recovery rates of vulnerables, in the course of attaining HI. We find the important result that slower attainment of the HI is relatively less fatal. However, slower progress toward HI could be complicated by many intervening factors.","Mondal, Sayantan; Mukherjee, Saumyak; Bagchi, Biman",The Journal of chemical physics,https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0018807; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32962383/,114

Given that neural response to rewards is altered in MDD and given that reward-related circuitry is modulated by dopamine and serotonin, we examined, for the first time, whether reward-related neural activity moderated response to sertraline, an antidepressant medication that targets these neurotransmitters. A total of 222 unmedicated adults with MDD randomized to receive sertraline (n = 110) or placebo (n = 112) in the Establishing Moderators and Biosignatures of Antidepressant Response in Clinical Care (EMBARC) study completed demographic and clinical assessments, and pretreatment functional magnetic resonance imaging while performing a reward task. We tested whether an index of reward system function in the ventral striatum (VS), a key reward circuitry region, moderated differential response to sertraline versus placebo, assessed with the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HSRD) over 8 weeks. We observed a significant moderation effect of the reward index, reflecting the temporal dynamics of VS activity, on week-8 depression levels (Fs ≥ 9.67, ps ≤ 0.002). Specifically, VS responses that were abnormal with respect to predictions from reinforcement learning theory were associated with lower week-8 depression symptoms in the sertraline versus placebo arms. Thus, a more abnormal pattern of pretreatment VS dynamic response to reward expectancy (expected outcome value) and prediction error (difference between expected and actual outcome), likely reflecting serotonergic and dopaminergic deficits, was associated with better response to sertraline than placebo. Pretreatment measures of reward-related VS activity may serve as objective neural markers to advance efforts to personalize interventions by guiding individual-level choice of antidepressant treatment.","Greenberg, Tsafrir; Fournier, Jay C; Stiffler, Richelle; Chase, Henry W; Almeida, Jorge R; Aslam, Haris; Deckersbach, Thilo; Cooper, Crystal; Toups, Marisa S; Carmody, Tom; Kurian, Benji; Peltier, Scott; Adams, Phillip; McInnis, Melvin G; Oquendo, Maria A; Fava, Maurizio; Parsey, Ramin; McGrath, Patrick J; Weissman, Myrna; Trivedi, Madhukar; Phillips, Mary L",Molecular psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41380-019-0490-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31462766/,114

Two CYP3A substrates were used - in the studies with CHIM, CYP3A activity was quantified via LC/MS-MS quantification of midazolam 1'-hydroxylation while in CHE, luciferin IPA metabolism to luciferin was quantified by luminescence. Upon treatment of CHIM with the estimated lumen concentration of the HS upon each oral administration (manufacturers' recommended dosage dissolved in 200 mL of culture medium), >80% CYP3A inhibition was observed for green tea extract, St. John's wort, valerian root, horehound and grapefruit juice. Less than 50% inhibition was observed for fenugreek, aloe vera, guarana, soy isoflavone, maca, echinacea, spirulina, evening primrose, milk thistle, cranberry, red yeast rice, rhodiola, ginkgo biloba, turmeric, curcumin, white kidney bean,, garlic, cinnamon, saw palmetto berries, panax ginseng, black elderberry, wheat grass juice, flaxseed oil, black cohosh, and ginger root. The results were confirmed in a a dose-response study with HS obtained from three suppliers for the four inhibitory HS (green tea extract, horehound, St. John's wort, valerian root), and three representative non-inhibitory HS (black cohosh, black elderberry, echinacea). Similar results were obtained with the inhibitory HS in CHE. The results illustrate that CHIM and CHE represent physiologically relevant in vitro experimental models for the evaluation of drug interaction potential of herbal supplements. Significance Statement In vitro evaluation of 29 popular herbal supplements in cryopreserved human intestinal mucosa identified green tea extract, horehound, St. John's wort, valerian root to have CYP3A inhibitory potential similar to that for grapefruit juice, suggesting their potential to have clinically-significant pharmacokinetic interaction with orally administered drugs that are CYP3A substrates.

Their wide clinical spectrum ranges from infantile severe multisystemic disorders to adult-onset myopathies. To suspect in adults these disorders, clinical features such as exercise intolerance and recurrent myoglobinuria need investigation while another group presents fixed weakness and cardiomyopathy as a clinical pattern. AREAS COVERED In metabolic myopathies, clinical manifestations are important to guide diagnostic tests used in order to lead to the correct diagnosis. The authors searched in literature the most recent techniques developed. The authors present an overview of the most common phenotypes of Pompe disease and what is currently known about the mechanism of ERT treatment. The most common disorders of lipid metabolism are overviewed, with their possible dietary or supplementary treatments.

We reviewed the recent multicenter experience with endovascular treatment of posterior circulation strokes to identify the clinical, radiographic, and procedural predictors of successful recanalization and good neurological outcomes. METHODS We performed a multicenter retrospective analysis of consecutive patients with posterior circulation strokes, who underwent thrombectomy with stent retrievers or primary aspiration thrombectomy (including A Direct Aspiration First Pass Technique [ADAPT] approach). We correlated clinical and radiographic outcomes with demographic, clinical, and technical characteristics. RESULTS A total of 100 patients were included in the final analysis (mean age, 63.5±14.2 years; mean admission National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score, 19.2±8.2). Favorable clinical outcome at 3 months (modified Rankin Scale score ≤2) was achieved in 35% of patients. Successful recanalization and shorter time from stroke onset to the start of the procedure were significant predictors of favorable clinical outcome at 90 days. Stent retriever and aspiration thrombectomy as primary treatment approaches showed comparable procedural and clinical outcomes. None of the baseline advanced imaging modalities (magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomographic perfusion, or computed tomography angiography assessment of collaterals) showed superiority in selecting patients for thrombectomy. CONCLUSIONS Time to the start of the procedure is an important predictor of clinical success after thrombectomy in patients with posterior circulation strokes. Both stent retriever and aspiration thrombectomy as primary treatment approaches are effective in achieving successful recanalization.","Mokin, Maxim; Sonig, Ashish; Sivakanthan, Sananthan; Ren, Zeguang; Elijovich, Lucas; Arthur, Adam; Goyal, Nitin; Kan, Peter; Duckworth, Edward; Veznedaroglu, Erol; Binning, Mandy J; Liebman, Kenneth M; Rao, Vikas; Turner, Raymond D; Turk, Aquilla S; Baxter, Blaise W; Dabus, Guilherme; Linfante, Italo; Snyder, Kenneth V; Levy, Elad I; Siddiqui, Adnan H",Stroke,https://doi.org/10.1161/strokeaha.115.011598; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26888533/,114

Objective To assess whether a diagnosis of a schizophrenia spectrum disorder, mood disorder, or anxiety disorder is associated with mortality in patients with COVID-19. Design, Setting, and Participants This retrospective cohort study assessed 7348 consecutive adult patients for 45 days following laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 between March 3 and May 31, 2020, in a large academic medical system in New York. The final date of follow-up was July 15, 2020. Patients without available medical records before testing were excluded. Exposures Patients were categorized based on the following International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification diagnoses before their testing date: (1) schizophrenia spectrum disorders, (2) mood disorders, and (3) anxiety disorders. Patients with these diagnoses were compared with a reference group without psychiatric disorders. Main Outcomes and Measures Mortality, defined as death or discharge to hospice within 45 days following a positive severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) test result. Results Of the 26 540 patients tested, 7348 tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 (mean [SD] age, 54 [18.6] years; 3891 [53.0%] women). Of eligible patients with positive test results, 75 patients (1.0%) had a history of a schizophrenia spectrum illness, 564 (7.7%) had a history of a mood disorder, and 360 (4.9%) had a history of an anxiety disorder. After adjusting for demographic and medical risk factors, a premorbid diagnosis of a schizophrenia spectrum disorder was significantly associated with mortality (odds ratio [OR], 2.67; 95% CI, 1.48-4.80). Diagnoses of mood disorders (OR, 1.14; 95% CI, 0.87-1.49) and anxiety disorders (OR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.65-1.41) were not associated with mortality after adjustment. In comparison with other risk factors, a diagnosis of schizophrenia ranked behind only age in strength of an association with mortality. Conclusions and Relevance In this cohort study of adults with SARS-CoV-2-positive test results in a large New York medical system, adults with a schizophrenia spectrum disorder diagnosis were associated with an increased risk for mortality, but those with mood and anxiety disorders were not associated with a risk of mortality. These results suggest that schizophrenia spectrum disorders may be a risk factor for mortality in patients with COVID-19.","Nemani, Katlyn; Li, Chenxiang; Olfson, Mark; Blessing, Esther M; Razavian, Narges; Chen, Ji; Petkova, Eva; Goff, Donald C",JAMA psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2020.4442; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33502436/,114

128806,Fetal myelomeningocele repair: the post-MOMS experience at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia.,2015,"BACKGROUND Excessive screen time ([Formula: see text] 2 h per day) is associated with childhood overweight and obesity, physical inactivity, increased sedentary time, unfavorable dietary behaviors, and disrupted sleep. Previous reviews suggest intervening on screen time is associated with reductions in screen time and improvements in other obesogenic behaviors. However, it is unclear what study characteristics and behavior change techniques are potential mechanisms underlying the effectiveness of behavioral interventions. The purpose of this meta-analysis was to identify the behavior change techniques and study characteristics associated with effectiveness in behavioral interventions to reduce children's (0-18 years) screen time. METHODS A literature search of four databases (Ebscohost, Web of Science, EMBASE, and PubMed) was executed between January and February 2020 and updated during July 2021. Behavioral interventions targeting reductions in children's (0-18 years) screen time were included. Information on study characteristics (e.g., sample size, duration) and behavior change techniques (e.g., information, goal-setting) were extracted. Data on randomization, allocation concealment, and blinding was extracted and used to assess risk of bias. Meta-regressions were used to explore whether intervention effectiveness was associated with the presence of behavior change techniques and study characteristics. RESULTS The search identified 15,529 articles, of which 10,714 were screened for relevancy and 680 were retained for full-text screening. Of these, 204 studies provided quantitative data in the meta-analysis. The overall summary of random effects showed a small, beneficial impact of screen time interventions compared to controls (SDM = 0.116, 95CI 0.08 to 0.15). Inclusion of the Goals, Feedback, and Planning behavioral techniques were associated with a positive impact on intervention effectiveness (SDM = 0.145, 95CI 0.11 to 0.18). Interventions with smaller sample sizes (n < 95) delivered over short durations (< 52 weeks) were associated with larger effects compared to studies with larger sample sizes delivered over longer durations. In the presence of the Goals, Feedback, and Planning behavioral techniques, intervention effectiveness diminished as sample size increased. CONCLUSIONS Both intervention content and context are important to consider when designing interventions to reduce children's screen time. As interventions are scaled, determining the active ingredients to optimize interventions along the translational continuum will be crucial to maximize reductions in children's screen time.","Jones, Alexis; Armstrong, Bridget; Weaver, R Glenn; Parker, Hannah; von Klinggraeff, Lauren; Beets, M W",The international journal of behavioral nutrition and physical activity,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12966-021-01189-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34530867/,114

When expressed independently or during virus infection, ORF7b accumulates in the Golgi compartment, colocalizing with both cis- and trans-Golgi markers. To identify the domains of this protein that are responsible for Golgi localization, we have generated a set of mutant proteins and analyzed their subcellular localizations by indirect immunofluorescence confocal microscopy. The N- and C-terminal sequences are dispensable, but the ORF7b transmembrane domain (TMD) is essential for Golgi compartment localization. When the TMD of human CD4 was replaced with the ORF7b TMD, the resulting chimeric protein localized to the Golgi complex. Scanning alanine mutagenesis identified two regions in the carboxy-terminal portion of the TMD that eliminated the Golgi complex localization of the chimeric CD4 proteins or ORF7b protein. Collectively, these data demonstrate that the Golgi complex retention signal of the ORF7b protein resides solely within the TMD.","Schaecher, Scott R; Diamond, Michael S; Pekosz, Andrew",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00784-08; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18632859/,114

We describe an immunocompetent woman with a cutaneous manifestation of Candida parasilopsis fungemia, a prominent eschar which proved to be the nidus for the candidemia. We stress the value of selectively removing eschars. C. parasilopsis and C. auris are increasingly important causes of sepsis and wound infections. We emphasize that commercially available biochemical-based tests may misidentify C. auris as C. parapsilosis, and stress the added danger of C. auris to critically ill hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Any health care facility with evidence of infection or colonization with C. auris requires very close monitoring, since this fungus is comparable to SARS-CoV-2 in its infectivity, mortality, and fomite adhesiveness! Both organisms must be closely observed as nosocomial infections in health care workers, who need to follow strict CDC guidelines. During this COVID-19 pandemic, every health care facility should closely monitor for the possible deadly combination of the SARS-CoV-2 and C. auris. The identification of C. auris necessitates use of sophisticated technology not readily available to make this essential diagnosis since C. auris is multi-drug resistant and isolation precautions would become paramount.","Schwartz, Robert A; Kapila, Rajendra",Dermatologic therapy,https://doi.org/10.1111/dth.13481; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32369240/,114

There has been a concern about new onset or worsening of gastroesophageal reflux (GERD) following LSG. OBJECTIVE The objective of the study was to evaluate the effect of surgically treating hiatal weakness on GERD symptoms in patients undergoing LSG. SETTING Single tertiary referral institution, Sydney, Australia. METHODS A prospective observational cohort study was conducted with consecutive patients undergoing LSG. Hiatal findings, patient demographics, medications and reflux score were recorded prospectively. Patients were followed up post-operatively for a minimum of 12 months and assessed using GERD-HRQL score to quantify reflux symptoms. RESULTS Data from 100 patients with a minimum of 1-year follow-up were analysed. Mean follow-up was 18.9 months. Overall, GERD-HRQL improved from mean 4.5 ± 5.8 pre-operatively to 0.76 ± 1.5 after 18.9 months (p = 0.0001). For those with pre-operative reflux, GERD-HRQL improved from mean (SD) 8.43 ± 6.26 pre-operatively to 0.94 ± 1.55 (p = 0.0001). All the nine patients with troublesome daily reflux significantly improved. For those without pre-operative reflux, GERD-HRQL improved from 0.88 ± 1.37 to 0.47 ± 1.25 (p-ns) post-operatively. On multivariate analysis, higher pre-operative reflux and dysphagia/bloat scores, younger age and lower percentage excess weight loss after 18.9 months were associated with GERD-HRQL improvement. CONCLUSION In the medium term, GERD-HRQL improves following sleeve gastrectomy with meticulous hiatal assessment and repair of hiatal laxity and herniation.","Page, Philip Le; Martin, David; Taylor, Craig; Wang, Jennifer; Wadhawan, Himanshu; Falk, Gregory; Gibson, Simon C",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-017-5935-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29234942/,114

130533,Tracking Cancer Evolution through the Disease Course.,2021-04-01,"BACKGROUND Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a common and important complication of stroke. The CLOTS 3 trial aims to determine whether, compared with best medical care, best medical care plus intermittent pneumatic compression (IPC) in immobile stroke patients reduces the risk of proximal deep vein thrombosis (DVT). METHODS/DESIGN The CLOTS 3 trial is a multicenter, parallel group trial with centralized randomization (minimization) to ensure allocation concealment. The protocol has been published (Trials 2012, 13:26) and is available in full at: http://www.clotstrial.com. Between December 2008 and September 2012, 105 centers in the UK recruited 2,876 immobile stroke patients within the first 3 days of their hospital admission. Patients were allocated to best medical care or best medical care plus IPC. Ultrasonographers performed a compression Doppler ultrasound scan to detect DVT in each treatment group at 7 to 10 days and 25 to 30 days. The primary outcome cluster includes symptomatic or asymptomatic DVT in the popliteal or femoral veins detected on either scan. Patients will be followed up by postal or telephone questionnaire at 6 months from randomization to detect later symptomatic DVT and pulmonary embolism (PE), and to measure functional outcome (Oxford Handicap Scale) and quality of life (EQ-5D-3L). The ultrasonographers performing the scans are blinded to treatment allocation, whereas the patients and caregivers are not. The trial has more than 90% power to detect a 4% absolute difference (12% versus 8%) in risk of the primary outcome and includes a health economic analysis.Follow-up will be completed in April 2013 and the results reported in May 2013.

OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to determine whether transversus abdominis plane blocks improve early postoperative outcomes in patients undergoing laparoscopic colorectal resection already on an optimized enhanced recovery pathway. DESIGN This study is based on a prospective, randomized, double-blind controlled trial. SETTINGS The trial was conducted at a tertiary referral center. PATIENTS Patients undergoing elective laparoscopic colorectal resection were selected. INTERVENTIONS(S) Patients were randomly assigned to receive either a transversus abdominis plane block or a placebo placed intraoperatively under laparoscopic guidance. All followed a standardized enhanced recovery pathway. Patient demographics, perioperative procedures, and postoperative outcomes were collected. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Postoperative pain and nausea/vomiting scores in the postanesthesia care unit and department, opioid use, length of stay, and 30-day readmission rates were measured. RESULTS The trial randomly assigned 41 patients to the transversus abdominis plane block group and 38 patients to the control group. Demographic, clinical, and procedural data were not significantly different. In the postanesthesia care unit, the transversus abdominis plane block group had significantly lower pain scores (p < 0.01) and used fewer opioids (p < 0.01) than the control group; postoperative nausea/vomiting scores were comparable (p = 0.99). The transversus abdominis plane group had significantly lower pain scores on postoperative day 1 (p = 0.04) and throughout the study period (p < 0.01). There was no significant difference between groups in postoperative opioid use (p = 0.65) or nausea/vomiting (p = 0.79). The length of stay (median, 2 days experimental, 3 days control; p = 0.50) and readmission rate (7% experimental, 5% control, p = 0.99) was similar across cohorts. LIMITATIONS This study was conducted a single center. CONCLUSIONS Transversus abdominis plane blocks improved immediate short-term opioid use and pain outcomes. Pain improvement was durable throughout the hospital stay. However, the blocks did not translate into less overall narcotic use, shorter length of stay, or lower readmission rates.","Keller, Deborah S; Ermlich, Bridget O; Schiltz, Nicholas; Champagne, Bradley J; Reynolds, Harry L; Stein, Sharon L; Delaney, Conor P",Diseases of the colon and rectum,https://doi.org/10.1097/dcr.0000000000000211; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25285696/,114

The masterplan described is based on regional, geographically sited liver centres, each linked to four to six surrounding district general hospitals-a pattern of care similar to that successfully introduced for stroke services. The plan includes the establishment of a lead and deputy lead clinician in each acute hospital, preferably a hepatologist or gastroenterologist with a special interest in liver disease, who will have prime responsibility for organising the care of admitted patients with liver disease on a 24/7 basis. Essential for the plan is greater access to intensive care units and high-dependency units, in line with the reconfiguration of emergency care due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This Review strongly recommends full implementation of alcohol care teams in hospitals and improved working links with acute medical services. We also endorse recommendations from paediatric liver services to improve overall survival figures by diagnosing biliary atresia earlier based on stool colour charts and better caring for patients with impaired cognitive ability and developmental mental health problems. Pilot studies of earlier diagnosis have shown encouraging progress, with 5-6% of previously undiagnosed cases of severe fibrosis or cirrhosis identified through use of a portable FibroScan in primary care. Similar approaches to the detection of early asymptomatic disease are described in accounts from the devolved nations, and the potential of digital technology in improving the value of clinical consultation and screening programmes in primary care is highlighted. The striking contribution of comorbidities, particularly obesity and diabetes (with excess alcohol consumption known to be a major factor in obesity), to mortality in COVID-19 reinforces the need for fiscal and other long delayed regulatory measures to reduce the prevalence of obesity. These measures include the food sugar levy and the introduction of the minimum unit price policy to reduce alcohol consumption. Improving public health, this Review emphasises, will not only mitigate the severity of further waves of COVID-19, but is crucial to reducing the unacceptable burden from liver disease in the UK.","Williams, Roger; Alessi, Charles; Alexander, Graeme; Allison, Michael; Aspinall, Richard; Batterham, Rachel L; Bhala, Neeraj; Day, Natalie; Dhawan, Anil; Drummond, Colin; Ferguson, James; Foster, Graham; Gilmore, Ian; Goldacre, Raphael; Gordon, Harriet; Henn, Clive; Kelly, Deirdre; MacGilchrist, Alastair; McCorry, Roger; McDougall, Neil; Mirza, Zulfiquar; Moriarty, Kieran; Newsome, Philip; Pinder, Richard; Roberts, Stephen; Rutter, Harry; Ryder, Stephen; Samyn, Marianne; Severi, Katherine; Sheron, Nick; Thorburn, Douglas; Verne, Julia; Williams, John; Yeoman, Andrew",Lancet,https://doi.org/10.1016/s0140-6736(20)32396-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33714360/,114

OBJECTIVES To examine whether sleep-disordered breathing increases the risk of incident hypertension among persons 40 years of age and older. METHODS In a prospective cohort study, we analyzed data from 2,470 participants who at baseline did not have hypertension, defined as blood pressure of at least 140/90 mm Hg or taking antihypertensive medication. The apnea-hypopnea index (AHI), the number of apneas plus hypopneas per hour of sleep, was measured by overnight in-home polysomnography. We estimated odds ratios for developing hypertension during 5 years of follow-up according to baseline AHI. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS The odds ratios for incident hypertension increased with increasing baseline AHI; however, this relationship was attenuated and not statistically significant after adjustment for baseline body-mass index. Although not statistically significant, the observed association between a baseline AHI greater than 30 and future hypertension (odds ratio, 1.51; 95% confidence interval, 0.93-2.47) does not exclude the possibility of a modest association. CONCLUSIONS Among middle-aged and older persons without hypertension, much of the relationship between AHI and risk of incident hypertension was accounted for by obesity. After adjustment for body mass index, the AHI was not a significant predictor of future hypertension, although a modest influence of an AHI greater than 30 on hypertension could not be excluded.","O'Connor, George T; Caffo, Brian; Newman, Anne B; Quan, Stuart F; Rapoport, David M; Redline, Susan; Resnick, Helaine E; Samet, Jonathan; Shahar, Eyal",American journal of respiratory and critical care medicine,https://doi.org/10.1164/rccm.200712-1809oc; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19264976/,114
131543,Four phases of intravenous fluid therapy: a conceptual model.,2014,"The use of oxidative stress generated by Cold Atmospheric Plasma (CAP) in oncology is being recently studied as a novel potential anti-cancer therapy. However, the beneficial effects of CAP for treating osteosarcoma have mostly been demonstrated in 2-dimensional cultures of cells, which do not mimic the complexity of the 3-dimensional (3D) bone microenvironment. In order to evaluate the effects of CAP in a relevant context of the human disease, we developed a 3D tissue-engineered model of osteosarcoma using a bone-like scaffold made of collagen type I and hydroxyapatite nanoparticles. Human osteosarcoma cells cultured within the scaffold showed a high capacity to infiltrate and proliferate and to exhibit osteomimicry in vitro. As expected, we observed significantly different functional behaviors between monolayer and 3D cultures when treated with Cold Plasma-Activated Ringer's Solution (PAR). Our data reveal that the 3D environment not only protects cells from PAR-induced lethality by scavenging and diminishing the amount of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species generated by CAP, but also favours the stemness phenotype of osteosarcoma cells. This is the first study that demonstrates the negative effect of PAR on cancer stem-like cell subpopulations in a 3D biomimetic model of cancer. These findings will allow to suitably re-focus research on plasma-based therapies in future.","Tornín, Juan; Villasante, Aranzazu; Solé-Martí, Xavi; Ginebra, Maria-Pau; Canal, Cristina",Free radical biology & medicine,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2020.12.437; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33401009/,114
131546,Infusion of donor feces affects the gut-brain axis in humans with metabolic syndrome.,2020-09-08,"The COVID-19 pandemic continues to present enormous challenges for colleges and universities and strategies for save reopening remain a topic of ongoing debate. Many institutions that reopened cautiously in the fall experienced a massive wave of infections and colleges were soon declared as the new hotspots of the pandemic. However, the precise effects of college outbreaks on their immediate neighborhood remain largely unknown. Here we show that the first two weeks of instruction present a high-risk period for campus outbreaks and that these outbreaks tend to spread into the neighboring communities. By integrating a classical mathematical epidemiology model and Bayesian learning, we learned the dynamic reproduction number for 30 colleges from their daily case reports. Of these 30 institutions, 14 displayed a spike of infections within the first two weeks of class, with peak seven-day incidences well above 1,000 per 100,000, an order of magnitude larger than the nation-wide peaks of 70 and 150 during the first and second waves of the pandemic. While most colleges were able to rapidly reduce the number of new infections, many failed to control the spread of the virus beyond their own campus: Within only two weeks, 17 campus outbreaks translated directly into peaks of infection within their home counties. These findings suggests that college campuses are at risk to develop an extreme incidence of COVID-19 and become superspreaders for neighboring communities. We anticipate that tight test-trace-quarantine strategies, flexible transition to online instruction, and-most importantly-compliance with local regulations will be critical to ensure a safe campus reopening after the winter break.","Lu, Hannah; Weintz, Cortney; Pace, Joseph; Indana, Dhiraj; Linka, Kevin; Kuhl, Ellen",Computer methods in biomechanics and biomedical engineering,https://doi.org/10.1080/10255842.2020.1869221; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33439055/,114

METHODS A retrospective review was conducted of patients with an ICA injury related to trans-sphenoidal surgery from 2000 to 2012. Demographic data, clinical charts, indications for treatment, radiographic images, lesion characteristics, operative notes, endovascular procedure notes and post-procedure hospital course were reviewed. RESULTS Three men and one woman of mean age of 52 years (range 33-74) were identified. The lesions included two macroadenomas, one meningioma and one chondrosarcoma. Risk factors for ICA rupture included two patients with carotid dehiscence, one with sphenoid septal attachment to the ICA, two with revision surgery, one with prior radiation to the tumor, one with bromocriptine treatment and two with acromegaly. In three patients, covered stent placement achieved hemostasis at the site of injury within the ICA. One patient developed delayed bleeding 6 h after covered stent placement and underwent successful endovascular occlusion of the ICA but died 6 days after the injury. The fourth patient had an intraoperative ICA stroke requiring suction thrombectomy, thrombolysis, stent placement and evacuation of an epidural hematoma. At 1-year follow-up, two patients had a modified Rankin score (mRS) and National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score of 0; in the patient who had a stroke the mRS score was 1 and the NIHSS score 2.

Titanium (Ti) coating using polyelectrolyte poly-L-lysine (PLL) may represent an interesting and simple approach, to provide a charged surface net able to improve cell adherence. However, in vitro and in vivo effects of Ti coated with PLL have been poorly investigated. The aims of the present study are (1) to obtain and characterize, chemically and physically, Ti disks coated with PLL (TiPLL); (2) to perform in vitro studies on osteoblast cell lines' cytocompatibility and functionality (alkaline phosphatase [ALP] activity, calcium deposition, proinflammatory interleukin 6 production); (3) to obtain in vivo evidence of osseointegration, using a sheep animal model. XPS, AFM, and contact-angle analyses demonstrated that the Ti disk was successfully covered with PLL, providing higher hydrophilicity to the Ti disk. No cellular toxicity, enhanced calcium deposition, and a decreased tendency toward interleukin-6 production were observed in the osteoblast seeded onto TiPLL. In vivo experiments showed cortical bone microhardness at 3 months significantly improved in the presence of the PLL coating. PLL coating on Ti implants seemed to safely enhance calcium deposition and implant early osseointegration in animals, suggesting promising evidence to optimize the surface properties of dental implants.","Varoni, Elena; Canciani, Elena; Palazzo, Barbara; Varasano, Vincenzo; Chevallier, Pascale; Petrizzi, Lucio; Dellavia, Claudia; Mantovani, Diego; Rimondini, Lia",The Journal of oral implantology,https://doi.org/10.1563/aaid-joi-d-13-00036; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24001103/,114

Some works have highlighted pathological changes on lung microvasculature with local pulmonary intravascular coagulopathy that may explain pulmonary artery thrombosis found on pulmonary computed tomography (CT) angiography. The objective of our study was to describe lung perfusion disorders assessed by pulmonary dual-energy CT (DECT) angiography in severe COVID-19 patients. Methods This single center retrospective study included 85 consecutive patients with a reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 who underwent a pulmonary DECT angiography between March 16th 2020 and April 22th 2020. Pulmonary DECT angiography was performed when the patient had severe clinical symptoms or suffered from active neoplasia or immunosuppression. Two chest radiologists performed pulmonary angiography analysis in search of pulmonary artery thrombosis and a blinded semi quantitative analysis of iodine color maps focusing on the presence of parenchymal ischemia. The lung parenchyma was divided into volumes based on HU values. DECT analysis included lung segmentation, total lungs volume and distribution of lung perfusion assessment. Results Twenty-nine patients (34%) were diagnosed with pulmonary artery thrombosis, mainly segmental (83%). Semi-quantitative analysis revealed parenchymal ischemia in 68% patients of the overall population, with no significant difference regarding absence or presence of pulmonary artery thrombosis (23 vs. 35, P=0.144). Inter-reader agreement of parenchymal ischemia between reader 1 and 2 was substantial [0.74; interquartile range (IQR): 0.59-0.89]. Volume of ischemia was significantly higher in patients with pulmonary artery thrombosis [29 (IQR, 8-100) vs. 8 (IQR, 0-45) cm3, P=0.041]. Lung parenchyma was divided between normal parenchyma (59%, of which 34% was hypoperfused), ground glass opacities (10%, of which 20% was hypoperfused) and consolidation (31%, of which 10% was hypoperfused). Conclusions Pulmonary perfusion evaluated by iodine concentration maps shows extreme heterogeneity in COVID-19 patients and lower iodine levels in normal parenchyma. Pulmonary ischemic areas were more frequent and larger in patients with pulmonary artery thrombosis. Pulmonary DECT angiography revealed a significant number of pulmonary ischemic areas even in the absence of visible pulmonary arterial thrombosis. This may reflect microthrombosis associated with COVID-19 pneumonia.","Grillet, Franck; Busse-Coté, Andreas; Calame, Paul; Behr, Julien; Delabrousse, Eric; Aubry, Sébastien",Quantitative imaging in medicine and surgery,https://doi.org/10.21037/qims-20-708; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32879862/,114

To test plans that were developed for mass prophylaxis scenarios, in April 2013 the Cook Country Department of Public Health (CCDPH) and the Triple Community (TripCom) Medical Reserve Corps (MRC) executed a full-scale mass prophylaxis exercise in response to a simulated anthrax bioterrorism attack. The exercise took place over 2 days and included the TripCom Point-of-Dispensing (POD) Management Team, volunteers from the TripCom MRC, and neighboring public health departments and MRCs. Individuals from the community volunteered as actors during the exercise, while local municipal, police, and fire personnel coordinated their responses to create the most realistic simulation possible. The exercise was designed to test the capacity of TripCom and CCDPH to implement plans for organizing municipal staff and volunteers to efficiently distribute prophylaxis to the community. Based on results from POD clinic flow, accuracy of prophylaxis distribution, and observations from evaluators, the exercise was successful in demonstrating areas that were operationally efficient as well as identifying areas that can be improved on. These include improvements to the just-in-time training for POD staff, the health screening and consent forms handed out to patients, the physical setup of the POD, and the command structure and communication for the management of POD operations. This article demonstrates the need for full-scale exercises and identifies gaps in POD planning that can be integrated into future plans, exercises, and emergency response.","Kilianski, Andy; O'Rourke, Amy T; Carlson, Crystal L; Parikh, Shannon M; Shipman-Amuwo, Frankie","Biosecurity and bioterrorism : biodefense strategy, practice, and science",https://doi.org/10.1089/bsp.2013.0089; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24697783/,114

Diels, Dianthus superbus L. Forsythiae fructus (Lian Qiao), Lonicerae flos (Jin Yin Hua), Naemorhedi cornu, Platycladus orientalis Franco, Polygonum aviculare, Polygonum cuspidatum, Poria cocos (Schw.), Rehmannia glutinosa (Gaertn.) DC, Rheum palmatum, Salvia miltiorrhiza Bunge, Scutellaria barbata, Scutellariae radix (Huang Qin) and Ursi fel (Xiong Dan) have shown to have antimicrobial properties against clinically significant Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacterial pathogens, as well as the mycobacteria (TB & non-tuberculous mycobacteria). Evidence is now beginning to emerge through systematic reviews of the outcomes of clinical studies employing Chinese Herbal Medicine to treat infections. Of the 106 Cochrane systematic reviews on CHM, 16 (circa 15%) reviews examine CHM in the context of treating a specific infection disease or state. This update examines direct antimicrobial effect of CHM on bacterial pathogens, as well as synergistic effects of combining CHM with conventional antibiotics.","Millar, Beverley C; Rao, Juluri R; Moore, John E",Letters in applied microbiology,https://doi.org/10.1111/lam.13534; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34219247/,114

133055,Vaccination plus Decarceration - Stopping Covid-19 in Jails and Prisons.,2021-03-03,"PURPOSE The hybrid system combining a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner with a linear accelerator (Linac) has become increasingly desirable for tumour treatment because of excellent soft-tissue contrast and non-ionising radiation. However, image distortions caused by gradient non-linearity (GNL) can have detrimental impacts on real-time radiotherapy using MRI-Linac systems, where accurate geometric information of tumours is essential. METHODS In this work, we proposed a deep convolutional neural network-based method to efficiently recover undistorted images (ReUINet) for real-time image guidance. The ReUINet, based on the encoder-decoder structure, was created to learn the relationship between the undistorted images and distorted images. The ReUINet was pre-trained and tested on a publically available brain MR image dataset acquired from 23 volunteers. Then, transfer-learning was adopted to implement the pre-trained model (i.e., network with optimal weights) on the experimental 3D grid phantom and in-vivo pelvis image datasets acquired from the 1.0 T Australian MRI-Linac system. RESULTS Evaluations on the phantom (768 slices) and pelvis data (88 slices) showed that the ReUINet achieved over 15-times and 45-times improvement on computational efficiency in comparison with standard interpolation and GNL-encoding methods, respectively. Moreover, qualitative and quantitative results demonstrated that the ReUINet provided better correction results than the standard interpolation method, and comparable performance compared to the GNL-encoding approach. CONCLUSIONS Validated by simulation and experimental results, the proposed ReUINet showed promise in obtaining accurate MR images for the implementation of real-time MRI-guided radiotherapy.","Shan, Shanshan; Li, Mao; Li, Mingyan; Tang, Fangfang; Crozier, Stuart; Liu, Feng",Medical physics,https://doi.org/10.1002/mp.14861; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33763850/,114

Examples include the successful implementation of vaccine and therapeutic clinical trials during the recent Ebola outbreak in West Africa. On the other end of the spectrum was the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) of peramivir in the treatment of H1N1 influenza virus that did not provide an opportunity to collect data or understand the effectiveness of the EUA program. Between the gold standard of a randomized controlled clinical trial and the problems associated with EUAs are the domain of expanded access protocols that may provide an avenue to make products available while awaiting licensure. This paper will examine the regulatory pathways in the United States (US) for the use of investigational drugs in a public health emergency as well as considerations when making these products available outside the US. Descriptions of the applications of the various approaches will be presented. Regardless of the pathway chosen, public health and clinical research planners need to work together to consider several factors associated with the respective options and maintain a goal of working toward the collection of data to support licensure before faced with future outbreaks. Finally, this paper will consider the lessons learned from public health response in the context of investigational drugs in other diseases where ""right to try laws"" may pose opportunities, as well as challenges.","Kirchoff, Matthew Carl; Pierson, Jerome F",Therapeutic innovation & regulatory science,https://doi.org/10.1177/2168479016680253; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28663940/,114

METHODS This review was conducted according to the PRISMA guidelines (PROSPERO ID: 4201707915). RESULTS Two underpowered randomized controlled trials and six observational studies were retrieved (n = 894 patients). Health-related quality of life and physical function may improve during anti-neoplastic treatment in who PN treatment is the only feeding opportunity, but not necessarily in patients able to feed enterally. Nutritional status may improve in patients regardless of anti-neoplastic treatment and gastrointestinal function. PN treatment was neither superior to fluid in terminal patients nor to dietary counselling in patients able to feed enterally in regards to survival. The total incidence of adverse events was low.

133701,Oropharyngeal surfactant can improve initial stabilisation and reduce rescue intubation in infants born below 25 weeks of gestation.,2018,"BACKGROUND Postoperative pulmonary complications (PPCs) are common and significant problems for oral and maxillofacial surgery patients. Dexmedetomidine (DEX), an α2-adrenoreceptor agonist, has been proven having lung protection effects. However, since now, there has not been final conclusion about whether DEX can reduce the incidence of PPCs. We hypothesize that, in oral and maxillofacial surgery with fibular free flap reconstruction patients, DEX may decrease the incidence of PPCs. METHODS This was a prospective, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, single-centered trial with two parallel arms. A total of 160 patients at intermediate-to-high risk of PPCs undergoing oral and maxillofacial surgery with fibular free flap reconstruction and tracheotomy were enrolled and randomized to receive continuous infusion of either DEX or placebo (normal saline). 0.4 μg/kg of DEX was given over 10mins as an initial dose followed by a maintaining dose of 0.4 μg/kg/h till the second day morning after surgery. At the same time, the normal saline was administered a similar quantity. The primary outcome was the incidence of PPCs according to Clavien-Dindo score within 7 days after surgery. RESULTS The two groups had similar characteristics at baseline. 18(22.5%) of 80 patients administered DEX, and 32(40.0%) of 80 patient administered placebo experienced PPCs within the first 7 days after surgery (relative risk [RR] 0.563,95% confidence interval [CI] 0.346-0.916; P = 0.017). In the first 7 days after surgery, the DEX group had a lower incidence of PPCs and a better postoperative survival probability (Log-rank test, P = 0.019), and was less prone to occur PPCs (Cox regression, P = 0.025, HR = 0.516). When the total dose of DEX was more than 328 μg, the patients were unlikely to have PPCs (ROC curve, AUC = 0.614, P = 0.009). CONCLUSIONS For patients undergoing oral and maxillofacial surgery with fibular free flap reconstruction and tracheotomy who were at intermediate or high risk of developing PPCs, continuous infusion of DEX could decrease the occurrence of PPCs during the first 7 days after surgery and shorten the length of hospital stay after surgery, but did not increase the prevalence of bradycardia or hypotension.

While flat two-dimensional (2-D) monolayers composed of a single cell type have provided important insight into understanding host-pathogen interactions and infectious disease mechanisms, these reductionist models lack many essential features present in the native host microenvironment that are known to regulate infection, including three-dimensional (3-D) architecture, multicellular complexity, commensal microbiota, gas exchange and nutrient gradients, and physiologically relevant biomechanical forces (e.g., fluid shear, stretch, compression). A major challenge in tissue engineering for infectious disease research is recreating this dynamic 3-D microenvironment (biological, chemical, and physical/mechanical) to more accurately model the initiation and progression of host-pathogen interactions in the laboratory. Here we review selected 3-D models of human intestinal mucosa, which represent a major portal of entry for infectious pathogens and an important niche for commensal microbiota. We highlight seminal studies that have used these models to interrogate host-pathogen interactions and infectious disease mechanisms, and we present this literature in the appropriate historical context. Models discussed include 3-D organotypic cultures engineered in the rotating wall vessel (RWV) bioreactor, extracellular matrix (ECM)-embedded/organoid models, and organ-on-a-chip (OAC) models.

134615,Photoredox-catalyzed deoxyfluorination of activated alcohols with Selectfluor®.,2019-08-09,"Existing estimations of air pollution from automobile sources are based on either experiments or small-scale governmental interventions. China's nationwide traffic control during the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak provided us a unique opportunity to assess the direct dose-effect relationship between vehicle density and air pollution. We found that, during the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak, the nationwide reduced air pollution (except for O3) could be largely explained by traffic control measures. During the traffic control period, every doubling of vehicle density was associated with a decrease of 4.2 (2.0, 6.4) μg/m3 in PM2.5, 5.5 (2.9, 8.1) μg/m3 in PM10, 1.5 (0.9, 2.0) μg/m3 in NO2, and 0.04 (0.02, 0.07) mg/m3 in CO comparing cities with different vehicle densities. Similarly, for every 10% increase in the truck proportion, PM2.5 decreased by 12.3 (4.1, 20.6) μg/m3, PM10 decreased by 14.3 (4.6, 23.9) μg/m3, and CO decreased by 0.14 (0.05, 0.23) mg/m3. Moreover, the associations between vehicle density and reduction in PM2.5, PM10, and CO during the traffic control period were stronger and showed near-complete linearity in cities with low green coverage rate (All P < 0.05 for interaction). According to our estimation, PM2.5 emissions from every doubling of vehicle density can lead to over 8000 excess deaths per year, 66% of which were caused by cardiopulmonary diseases. This natural experiment study is the first to observe the dose-effect relationship between on-road traffic and traffic-generated air pollution, as well as the mitigating effect of urban greening. Findings provide key evidence to the assessment and control of traffic-generated air pollution and its public health impact.","Jia, Chengyong; Li, Wending; Wu, Tangchun; He, Meian",The Science of the total environment,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.146618; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33780836/,114

The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of vitamin D deficiency in complex PCOS pathophysiological pathways. Methods Two hundred sixty-seven patients with PCOS were divided into two groups Group 1 with 25(OH)D3 deficiency, and Group 2 with normal 25(OH)D3. Biochemical and hormonal parameters (androgen hormones, gonadotropins, and thyroid function tests) were compared between the two groups. Results Eighty-six percent of the patients (n=231) were in Group 1 and 14% (n=36) in Group 2. Statistically significantly higher concentrations of serum testosterone, dehydroepiandrosterone-sulfate and LH were determined in Group 1 (p<0.05). 25(OH)D3 concentrations were negatively correlated with body mass index (r=-0.459), serum testosterone (r =-0.374) and dehydroepiandrosterone-sulfate levels (r=-0.418); (all; p< 0.05). Conclusion The study findings show that low 25(OH)D3 levels are associated with high androgen levels in women with PCOS. Vitamin D deficiency should be considered as an additional risk factor in the development of PCOS. We think that providing vitamin D supplementation for women from identified deficiency areas can reduce the risk of PCOS development.","Gokosmanoglu, Feyzi; Onmez, Attila; Ergenç, Hasan",African health sciences,https://doi.org/10.4314/ahs.v20i4.45; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34394253/,114

Materials and Methods: We conducted a retrospective, observational study using cross-sectional data for all 139 U.S. Veterans Affairs Medical Centers (VAMCs). We used logistic regression analyses to identify factors that predicted whether a VAMC was in the top quartile of VA Video Connect (VVC) telehealth uptake for primary care and mental health care. Results: All 139 VAMCs increased their VVC uptake at least 2-fold early in the pandemic, with most increasing uptake between 5- and 10-fold. Pre-COVID-19, higher VVC uptake in primary care was weakly and positively associated with having more high-risk patients, negatively associated with having more long-distance patients, and positively associated with the prior fiscal year's VVC uptake. During COVID-19, the positive association with high-risk patients and the negative association with long-distance patients strengthened, while weaker broadband coverage was negatively associated with VVC uptake. For mental health care, having more long-distance patients was positively associated with higher VVC uptake pre-COVID-19, but this relationship reversed during COVID-19. Discussion: Despite the marked increase in VVC uptake early in the COVID-19 pandemic, significant VAMC-level variation indicates that VVC adoption was more difficult for some medical centers, particularly those with poorer broadband coverage and less prior VVC experience. Conclusions and Relevance: These findings highlight opportunities for medical centers, VA Central Office, and other federal entities to ensure equitable access to video telehealth.","Jacobs, Josephine; Ferguson, Jacqueline M; Van Campen, James; Yefimova, Maria; Greene, Liberty; Heyworth, Leonie; Zulman, Donna M",Telemedicine journal and e-health : the official journal of the American Telemedicine Association,https://doi.org/10.1089/tmj.2020.0530; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33887166/,114

We investigated the influence of age on the baseline profile and on outcomes in acute intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH) among participants of the INTERACT2 study. METHODS INTERACT2 was an international, randomised controlled trial in 2839 patients with spontaneous ICH within 6 h of onset and elevated systolic blood pressure (SBP; 150-220 mmHg) who were allocated to receive intensive (target SBP <140 mmHg within 1 h) or guideline-recommended (target SBP <180 mmHg) blood pressure lowering treatment. Stroke severity was assessed with the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale. Poor outcome was defined as death or major disability ('dependency', modified Rankin Scale scores 3-6) at 90 days. Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) was assessed with the European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions (EQ-5D) questionnaire. Associations between age and outcomes were analysed in multivariable logistic regression models. RESULTS Stroke severity increased in categories of older age (P-trend 0.002). Stroke patients over 75 years old were four times more likely to die or be disabled at 90 days than those <52 years when other confounders were accounted for (odds ratio 4.36, 95% confidence interval 3.12-6.08). Older age was also associated with decreasing HRQoL, across mobility, self-care, usual activities and depression (all P-trend <0.001), and pain or discomfort (P-trend 0.022). CONCLUSION In the INTERACT2 cohort, older people had more severe ICH and worse outcomes (death, major disability and HRQoL).

Oral administration of the commensal bacterium Lactococcus lactis expressing recombinant fusion proteins has been used to elicit mucosal and systemic immune responses. In this study, a Lactococcus lactis NZ3900 strain co-expressing the outer membrane protein (Omp) H of the microfold (M) cell-targeting ligand and the viral capsid protein (VP)2 antigen of IBDV was genetically engineered, and its immunopotentiating capacity as an oral and injected vaccine in chickens was evaluated. Western blotting analysis demonstrated that VP2-OmpH was expressed in the cytoplasm of cells and had high immunoreactivity. An in vivo study showed that in the absence of any adjuvant, the recombinant L. lactis VP2-OmpH strain stimulated the immune response and protected against very virulent IBDV challenge in 100% and 80% of chickens immunized by injection and oral administration, respectively. Moreover, the antiviral neutralizing antibody titers induced by injection administration were higher than those induced by oral administration. Mucosal secretory IgA titers induced by oral administration were higher than those induced by injection administration. These results suggested that the recombinant L. lactis VP2-OmpH strain is a promising candidate vaccine to prevent IBDV infection.","Liu, Linlin; Zhang, Wang; Song, Yuxin; Wang, Wenqian; Zhang, Yuan; Wang, Tingting; Li, Kai; Pan, Qing; Qi, Xiaole; Gao, Yulong; Gao, Li; Liu, Changjun; Zhang, Yanping; Wang, Yongqiang; He, Gaoming; Wang, Xiaomei; Cui, Hongyu",Vaccine,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2017.12.027; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29289381/,114

Nerve growth factor is involved in pain signaling. Tanezumab, a nerve growth factor monoclonal antibody, has demonstrated efficacy in chronic pain. Placebo-controlled parent (NCT00545129; study 1003) and noncontrolled open-label extension (NCT00830180; study 1029) studies evaluated efficacy and safety of tanezumab in patients with painful bone metastases taking daily opioids. Patients in study 1003 received a single intravenous injection of 10 mg tanezumab or placebo and were followed up to 16 weeks. Efficacy analyses included change from baseline in daily average and worst pain at week 6 on an 11-point numeric rating scale. At week 8, patients could enroll in study 1029 and receive 4 infusions of 10 mg tanezumab at 8-week intervals with follow-up to 40 weeks. Safety assessments included adverse events and physical and neurologic examinations. Overall, 59 patients were randomized and treated (placebo, n = 30; tanezumab, n = 29). At the primary endpoint of study 1003, least squares mean (SE) difference in change from baseline in daily average pain vs placebo was -0.26 (0.45; P = 0.569). Post hoc analyses suggested that tanezumab had greater efficacy in patients with lower baseline opioid use and/or higher baseline pain. Mean (SE) pain scores in study 1029 were reduced through week 40 compared with study 1029 or 1003 baselines (-0.21 [0.76] and -1.27 [0.68], respectively). Adverse event incidence of study 1003 was similar between groups. Although the primary endpoint was not achieved, tanezumab may provide additional sustained analgesia in patients with metastatic bone pain taking daily opioids.

138734,Higher mortality in patients with right hemispheric intracerebral haemorrhage: INTERACT1 and 2.,2015,"BACKGROUND Multiple Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines appear to be safe and efficacious, but only high-income countries have the resources to procure sufficient vaccine doses for most of their eligible populations. The World Health Organization has published guidelines for vaccine prioritisation, but most vaccine impact projections have focused on high-income countries, and few incorporate economic considerations. To address this evidence gap, we projected the health and economic impact of different vaccination scenarios in Sindh Province, Pakistan (population: 48 million). METHODS AND FINDINGS We fitted a compartmental transmission model to COVID-19 cases and deaths in Sindh from 30 April to 15 September 2020. We then projected cases, deaths, and hospitalisation outcomes over 10 years under different vaccine scenarios. Finally, we combined these projections with a detailed economic model to estimate incremental costs (from healthcare and partial societal perspectives), disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for each scenario. We project that 1 year of vaccine distribution, at delivery rates consistent with COVAX projections, using an infection-blocking vaccine at $3/dose with 70% efficacy and 2.5-year duration of protection is likely to avert around 0.9 (95% credible interval (CrI): 0.9, 1.0) million cases, 10.1 (95% CrI: 10.1, 10.3) thousand deaths, and 70.1 (95% CrI: 69.9, 70.6) thousand DALYs, with an ICER of $27.9 per DALY averted from the health system perspective. Under a broad range of alternative scenarios, we find that initially prioritising the older (65+) population generally prevents more deaths. However, unprioritised distribution has almost the same cost-effectiveness when considering all outcomes, and both prioritised and unprioritised programmes can be cost-effective for low per-dose costs. High vaccine prices ($10/dose), however, may not be cost-effective, depending on the specifics of vaccine performance, distribution programme, and future pandemic trends. The principal drivers of the health outcomes are the fitted values for the overall transmission scaling parameter and disease natural history parameters from other studies, particularly age-specific probabilities of infection and symptomatic disease, as well as social contact rates. Other parameters are investigated in sensitivity analyses. This study is limited by model approximations, available data, and future uncertainty. Because the model is a single-population compartmental model, detailed impacts of nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) such as household isolation cannot be practically represented or evaluated in combination with vaccine programmes. Similarly, the model cannot consider prioritising groups like healthcare or other essential workers. The model is only fitted to the reported case and death data, which are incomplete and not disaggregated by, e.g., age. Finally, because the future impact and implementation cost of NPIs are uncertain, how these would interact with vaccination remains an open question. CONCLUSIONS COVID-19 vaccination can have a considerable health impact and is likely to be cost-effective if more optimistic vaccine scenarios apply. Preventing severe disease is an important contributor to this impact. However, the advantage of prioritising older, high-risk populations is smaller in generally younger populations. This reduction is especially true in populations with more past transmission, and if the vaccine is likely to further impede transmission rather than just disease. Those conditions are typical of many low- and middle-income countries.","Pearson, Carl A B; Bozzani, Fiammetta; Procter, Simon R; Davies, Nicholas G; Huda, Maryam; Jensen, Henning Tarp; Keogh-Brown, Marcus; Khalid, Muhammad; Sweeney, Sedona; Torres-Rueda, Sergio; Eggo, Rosalind M; Vassall, Anna; Jit, Mark",PLoS medicine,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1003815; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34606520/,114

A simple, rapid, and effective method for the on-site detection of these viruses would be useful. We used a denaturation bubble-mediated strand exchange amplification (SEA) method to successfully detect CPV-2 and FPLV in fecal samples. SEA could detect as little as 3.6 pg/μL of CPV-2 and 6.6 pg/μL of FPLV genomic DNA following a 40-min incubation at an isothermal temperature of 61°C. Unlike PCR, SEA does not require complicated equipment, and positive samples produce a color change that can be visualized by the naked eye. Additionally, SEA is simpler than PCR because no extraction is needed, and heating of the fecal sample at 98°C can be performed with a heating block or water bath. This rapid and effective nucleic acid detection platform could be used as a point-of-care test for the detection of CPV-2 and FPLV.","Liu, Mengmeng; Li, Mengzhe; Ma, Cuiping; Shi, Chao","Journal of veterinary diagnostic investigation : official publication of the American Association of Veterinary Laboratory Diagnosticians, Inc",https://doi.org/10.1177/1040638720962067; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32996420/,114

139260,Impact of Preoperative Nutritional Status on Surgical Outcomes in Patients with Pediatric Gastrointestinal Surgery.,2020-11-16,"IMPORTANCE Acute kidney injury, a common complication of surgery, is associated with poor outcomes and high health care costs. Some studies suggest aspirin or clonidine administered during the perioperative period reduces the risk of acute kidney injury; however, these effects are uncertain and each intervention has the potential for harm. OBJECTIVE To determine whether aspirin compared with placebo, and clonidine compared with placebo, alters the risk of perioperative acute kidney injury. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A 2 × 2 factorial randomized, blinded, clinical trial of 6905 patients undergoing noncardiac surgery from 88 centers in 22 countries with consecutive patients enrolled between January 2011 and December 2013. INTERVENTIONS Patients were assigned to take aspirin (200 mg) or placebo 2 to 4 hours before surgery and then aspirin (100 mg) or placebo daily up to 30 days after surgery, and were assigned to take oral clonidine (0.2 mg) or placebo 2 to 4 hours before surgery, and then a transdermal clonidine patch (which provided clonidine at 0.2 mg/d) or placebo patch that remained until 72 hours after surgery. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Acute kidney injury was primarily defined as an increase in serum creatinine concentration from the preoperative concentration by either an increase of 0.3 mg/dL or greater (≥26.5 μmol/L) within 48 hours of surgery or an increase of 50% or greater within 7 days of surgery. RESULTS Aspirin (n = 3443) vs placebo (n = 3462) did not alter the risk of acute kidney injury (13.4% vs 12.3%, respectively; adjusted relative risk, 1.10; 95% CI, 0.96-1.25). Clonidine (n = 3453) vs placebo (n = 3452) did not alter the risk of acute kidney injury (13.0% vs 12.7%, respectively; adjusted relative risk, 1.03; 95% CI, 0.90-1.18). Aspirin increased the risk of major bleeding. In a post hoc analysis, major bleeding was associated with a greater risk of subsequent acute kidney injury (23.3% when bleeding was present vs 12.3% when bleeding was absent; adjusted hazard ratio, 2.20; 95% CI, 1.72-2.83). Similarly, clonidine increased the risk of clinically important hypotension. In a post hoc analysis, clinically important hypotension was associated with a greater risk of subsequent acute kidney injury (14.3% when hypotension was present vs 11.8% when hypotension was absent; adjusted hazard ratio, 1.34; 95% CI, 1.14-1.58). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among patients undergoing major noncardiac surgery, neither aspirin nor clonidine administered perioperatively reduced the risk of acute kidney injury.

DESIGN A retrospective case series. SETTING Five community hospitals within 1 urban health system. PATIENTS Adult patients whom received tocilizumab between March 27th, 2020 to April 30th, 2020 for severe COVID-19. INTERVENTIONS None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Sixteen patients in total were evaluated from the 5 community hospitals. The mean (± SD) age of the patients was 53.9 ± 9.2 years, 56% were men, and the most common comorbidities present on admission were hypertension (31%) and diabetes mellitus (25%). All patients received at least 1 other treatment modality for COVID-19 (steroids, hydroxychloroquine, or convaslescent plasma). Additionally, all patients on admission to intensive care units had severe COVID-19 with 56% requiring mechanical ventilation with a pre-tocilizumab median (IQR) Pao2: Fio2 of 84 (69 - 108.6), 19% requiring vasopressor support, and inflammatory markers (CRP, LDH, ferritin, and IL-6) were elevated. The median (IQR) tocilizumab dose was 400 mg (400-600) which correlated with a weight-based mean (± SD) dose of 5.4 mg/kg ± 1.3. Of the 16 patients that received tocilizumab, 8 (50%) were discharged home, 7 (44%) died, and 1 (6%) was still hospitalized at the end of data collection. Patients who died were more likely to be older 62 ± 2 years, female (57%), had a higher rate of mechanical ventilation (86%) and vasopressors (43%) use at baseline, and had a higher median (IQR) IL-6 level prior to tocilizumab administration 550 pg/mL (IQR 83-1924). There were no reported adverse drug reactions reported after the administration of tocilizumab for any patient. CONCLUSIONS Our findings do not support the effectiveness of tocilizumab in treatment of severe COVID-19 infection in critically ill patients.","McKenzie, Matt G; Lee, Yeunju Michelle; Mathew, Julin; Anderson, Megan; Vo, Alison T; Akinyele, Samuel; Narayanan, Malarvizhi",Journal of pharmacy practice,https://doi.org/10.1177/08971900211002353; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33736526/,114
139498,Managing asthma in the COVID-19 pandemic and current recommendations from professional bodies: a review.,2020-08-11,"BACKGROUND In response to the coronavirus 2019 pandemic, telemedicine use has increased throughout the United States. We aimed to measure patient experience with electronic health record-integrated postoperative telemedicine encounters following thyroid and parathyroid surgery. METHODS In this preliminary study, adult patients receiving postoperative electronic health record-integrated telemedicine video encounters or standard in-person visits after thyroid or parathyroid surgery at a single institution were prospectively enrolled from November 2019 through May 2020. Patients with home zip codes 10 to 75 miles from the medical center were included. Patient experience was assessed using the Consumer Assessment of Health Care Providers and Systems Clinician & Group Visit Survey 2.0 and the Communication Assessment Tool. Top box analysis was performed, defined as the percentage of respondents who chose the most positive response score. RESULTS The cohort consisted of 45 telemedicine and 32 in-person encounters. Both groups reported similar and excellent patient experience and satisfaction (9.7 of 10 for telemedicine vs 9.8 of 10 for in-person encounters, mean difference 0.02, 95% confidence interval, [-0.25 to 0.29]). Similar surgeon communication performance was observed (mean Communication Assessment Tool top box score 83% telemedicine vs 86% in-person, mean difference 3%, 95% confidence interval [-10% to 17%]). Nonlinear increases in monthly telemedicine encounter volume were observed within the section of endocrine surgery (3-fold increase) and the health system (125-fold increase) from November 2019 to May 2020. CONCLUSION Patients who underwent cervical endocrine surgery reported similarly high rates of satisfaction and excellent surgeon communication following either telemedicine or in-person postoperative encounters. Electronic health record-integrated telemedicine for a subset of low-risk procedures can act as a suitable replacement for in-person encounters. A surge in telemedicine use, stimulated by the coronavirus 2019 pandemic, was experienced at our institution.","Schumm, Max A; Pyo, Howard Q; Ohev-Shalom, Roben; Tseng, Chi-Hong; Livhits, Masha J; Zanocco, Kyle A; Hiyama, Darryl T; Yeh, Michael W",Surgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.surg.2020.11.019; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33384159/,114

In this study, we detected T cells reactive to SARS-CoV-2 proteins M, S and N, as well as serum virus-specific IgM, IgA, IgG, in nearly all SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals, but not in healthy donors. Virus-reactive T cells exhibited signs of in vivo activation, as suggested by the surface expression of immune-checkpoint molecules PD1 and TIGIT. Of note, we detected antigen-specific adaptive immune response both in asymptomatic and symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infected subjects. More importantly, symptomatic patients displayed a significantly higher magnitude of both cell-mediated and humoral adaptive immune response to the virus, as compared to asymptomatic individuals. These findings suggest that an uncontrolled adaptive immune response contribute to the development of the life threatening inflammatory phase of the disease.

140041,Cardiovascular Risk Factors After Adolescent Bariatric Surgery.,2018,"OBJECTIVE To investigate whether the use of routinely obtained chest X-rays is necessary after elective VATS. METHODS We retrospectively reviewed 1097 chest X-rays obtained routinely after elective VATS, performed in patients aged over 15 years during an 18-month period. VATS procedures were divided into three groups according to the degree of pulmonary resection. The chest X-rays (obtained anterior-posterior in one plane with the patient in the supine position) were categorized as abnormal if showing pneumothorax >5 cm, possible intra-thoracic bleeding and/or a displaced chest tube. Medical charts were reviewed for all patients with abnormal chest X-rays to see if an intervention was made based on the X-ray. In case of an intervention, detailed clinical data were collected. RESULTS 44 of 1097 chest X-rays (4.0 %) were abnormal and 10 of these X-rays (0.9 %) led to a clinical intervention. Proportions of abnormal chest X-rays were unequally distributed between groups (p < 0.001), whereas the number of interventions was not (p = 0.43). Of the ten chests X-rays that led to an intervention, three showed possible intra-thoracic bleeding, six showed pneumothorax >5 cm and one showed a kinked chest tube. All the patients with possible intra-thoracic bleeding were re-explored in the operating theatre the same day. CONCLUSIONS Only 10 of 1097 chest X-rays (0.9 %) obtained routinely after elective VATS procedures led to a clinical intervention, supporting the abandon of routine chest X rays in favour of a more individualised approach, based on clinical observations.","Bjerregaard, Lars S; Jensen, Katrine; Petersen, René Horsleben; Hansen, Henrik Jessen",General thoracic and cardiovascular surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11748-015-0560-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26007694/,114

The bovine rotavirus-specific passive antibodies were produced before the study by hyperimmunization of pregnant cows during the dry period with an adjuvanted vaccine containing recombinantly-expressed rotavirus virus-like particles. Eighty-three calves were cleanly collected at birth and randomly assigned to 1 of 3 groups as follows: (1) control group that was colostrum deprived and fed milk replacer for first feeding, (2) group that was colostrum deprived and fed milk replacer mixed with antirotavirus antibodies for first feeding, or (3) group that was fed colostrum replacer mixed with antirotavirus antibodies and a product approved by the US Department of Agriculture containing antibodies against Escherichia coli K99 and bovine coronavirus for first feeding. One of the 3 treatments was administered within 6 h of birth to each calf, followed by oral challenge with bovine rotavirus 3 h later. Calves were observed through 7 d of age and scored according to a standardized scale for clinical signs of diarrhea, change in appetite, depression, and dehydration. Twice daily, measurements of rectal temperature and collection of feces were performed. Fecal samples were assessed for infectious agents commonly associated with diarrhea, and bovine rotavirus shedding was quantified. There were 24 of 28 (86%) calves in the control group that received no antibodies that had signs of severe diarrhea, whereas 57% of the calves that received antirotavirus in milk replacer experienced severe diarrhea, and 7% of calves that received colostrum replacer mixed with antigen-specific bovine rotavirus antibodies showed signs of severe diarrhea. Calves that received colostrum replacer mixed with antigen-specific bovine rotavirus antibodies had a mean duration of 0.9 d of diarrhea compared with 2.7 d in the control group. Calves in the group that was colostrum deprived and fed milk replacer with antirotavirus antibodies had a mean duration of diarrhea of 1.7 d. Rotavirus peak fecal shedding was 3.5 d in the group with milk replacer only, 5.5 d in the milk replacer with antibody group, and 6.5 d in calves in the colostrum replacer group. When bovine rotavirus antigen-specific antibody was fed in milk replacer to colostrum-deprived calves or in conjunction with colostrum replacer that also contained supplemental antibodies against Escherichia coli K99 and bovine coronavirus, those calves were observed to have reduced the onset, duration, and severity of diarrhea when compared with milk replacer placebo.","Bristol, L S; Duhamel, G E; Zinckgraf, J W; Crabb, J H; Nydam, D V",Journal of dairy science,https://doi.org/10.3168/jds.2020-19834; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34419277/,114
141330,Treatment of cancer pain.,2011,"Background The outbreak of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) made imperative the use of protective devices as a source control tool. As there is no definite antiviral treatment and effective vaccine, the only efficient means of protecting and mitigating infectious contagion has been the use of personal protective equipment, especially by healthcare workers. However, masks affect the humidification process of inhaled air, possibly leading to a basal inflammatory state of the upper airways. Study design This is a single-center observational study conducted at the University Hospital of Catania from April 1, 2020, to June 31, 2020. Methods We analyzed the role of protective masks on the elimination of upper airways complaints in healthcare workers of the University Hospital of Catania. We evaluated 277 subjects through a selfadministered 17 item questionnaire based on respiratory, work performance and health-related quality of life domains. Results A higher prevalence of nasal and ocular symptoms, perceived reduced work performance, difficulty in concentrating, and sleep disorders were found. After two weeks adhering to a list of good practices that we recommended, significant reversibility of the symptoms investigated and work performance enhancement were observed. Conclusions Despite clinical complaints related to personal protective equipment, effective amelioration through usage rules is easily obtained. Given the essential use of protective masks, healthcare workers have to adhere to appropriate work and safety prevention rules.","Maniaci, A; Ferlito, S; Bubbico, L; Ledda, C; Rapisarda, V; Iannella, G; La Mantia, I; Grillo, C; Vicini, C; Privitera, E; Coco, S; Cammaroto, G; Lechien, J R; Magliulo, G; Pace, A; Meccariello, G; Cocuzza, S",Annali di igiene : medicina preventiva e di comunita,https://doi.org/10.7416/ai.2021.2439; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33797548/,114
141396,"Anaesthesiology and perioperative medicine around the world: different names, same goals.",2015,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Coil embolization is an alternative to clipping for intracranial aneurysms. However, controversy exists regarding the best therapeutic strategy in patients with ruptured aneurysms, and there is great center- and country-related variability in the rates of clipping versus coiling. We performed a meta-analysis of prospective controlled trials of clipping versus coil embolization for ruptured aneurysms. MATERIALS AND METHODS We performed a search of the English literature for published prospective controlled trials comparing surgical clipping with endovascular coil embolization for ruptured intracranial aneurysms. Data were abstracted from the identified references. Outcomes of interest were the proportion of patients with a poor outcome at 1 year and episodes of rebleeding from the index treated aneurysm after the allocated treatment. RESULTS There were 3 prospective controlled trials eligible for inclusion. These studies enrolled 2723 patients. Meta-analysis of these studies showed that the rate of poor outcome at 1 year was significantly lower in patients allocated to coil embolization (risk ratio, 0.75; 95% confidence interval, 0.65-0.87). This relative effect is consistent with an absolute risk reduction of 7.8% and a number needed to treat of 13. The effect on mortality was not statistically different across the 2 treatments. Rebleeding rates within the first month were higher in patients allocated to endovascular coil embolization. CONCLUSIONS On the basis of the analysis of the 3 high-quality prospective controlled trials available, there is strong evidence to indicate that endovascular coil embolization is associated with better outcomes compared with surgical clipping in patients amenable to either therapeutic strategy.","Lanzino, G; Murad, M H; d'Urso, P I; Rabinstein, A A",AJNR.

141762,Pilot study of a computed tomography-compatible shielded intracavitary brachytherapy applicator for treatment of cervical cancer.,2013,"PURPOSE Laparoscopy is the approach of choice for the majority of colorectal disorders that require a minimally invasive abdominal operation. As the emphasis on minimizing the technique continues, natural orifice surgery is quickly evolving. The authors utilized an embryologic natural orifice, the umbilicus, as sole access to the abdomen to perform a colorectal procedure. Herein, we present our initial experience of single-port laparoscopic colorectal surgery using a Uni-X Single-Port Access Laparoscopic System (Pnavel Systems, Morganville, New Jersey, USA) with a multi-channel cannula and specially designed curved laparoscopic instrumentation. METHOD The abdomen was approached through a 3.5 cm incision via the umbilicus and a single-port access device was utilized to perform a right hemicolectomy on a patient with an unresectable caecal polyp and a body mass index of 35. Ligation of the ileocolic artery was done with a LigaSure Device (Covidien Ltd, Norwalk, Connecticut, USA), and was followed by colonic mobilization, extraction and extracorporeal ileocolic anastomosis. RESULTS The total operative time was 115 min with minimal blood loss. Hospital stay was 4 days with no undue sequelae. CONCLUSION Single-port laparoscopic surgery may allow common colorectal laparoscopic operations to be performed entirely through the patient's umbilicus and enable an essentially scarless procedure. Additional experience and continued investigation are warranted.","Remzi, F H; Kirat, H T; Kaouk, J H; Geisler, D P",Colorectal disease : the official journal of the Association of Coloproctology of Great Britain and Ireland,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1463-1318.2008.01660.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18684153/,114

Magnetic Resonance Fingerprinting (MRF) may provide time efficient means of rapid multiparametric quantitative MRI. The accuracy of MRF, however, relies on adequate control over system imperfections, such as eddy currents and $B_1^+$, which are different and not as well established on MRL systems compared to diagnostic systems. In this study we investigate the technical feasibility of gradient spoiled 2D MRF on a 1.5T MRL. We show with phantom experiments that the MRL generates reliable MRF signals that are temporally stable during the day and have good agreement with spin-echo reference measurements. Subsequent in-vivo MRF scans in healthy volunteers and a patient with a colorectal liver metastasis showed good image quality, where the quantitative values of selected organs corresponded with the values reported in literature. Therefore we conclude that gradient spoiled 2D MRF is feasible on a 1.5T MRL with similar performance as on a diagnostic system. The precision and accuracy of the parametric maps are sufficient for further investigation of the clinical utility of MRF for online quantitatively MRI-guided radiotherapy.","Bruijnen, Tom; van der Heide, Oscar; Intven, Martijn P W; Mook, Stella; Lagendijk, Jan J W; Van den Berg, Cornelis A T; Tijssen, Rob H N",Physics in medicine and biology,https://doi.org/10.1088/1361-6560/abbb9d; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32977318/,114

Endotracheal tubes (ETTs) and connectors contribute to resistance. However, the effect of a closed system suction (CSS) connector is not well known. We compared the in vivo resistance occurring with a CSS connector with that of the standard connector. MATERIALS AND METHODS This prospective study was conducted at Gazi University Hospital's neonatal intensive care unit. Intubated neonates were studied for two cycles; each cycle contained two periods of ETT + connector pairs (15 min/period) as follows: cycle 1 [A: long ETT + standard connector; B: long ETT + CSS connector] and cycle 2 [C: shortened ETT + standard connector; D: shortened ETT + CSS connector]. Resistance of 40 breaths/period was averaged for each case, and the means were analyzed by Wilcoxon test for pairwise comparisons between standard and CSS connectors. As each case provided two cycle data, 16 cycle data were compared. RESULTS The CSS connector increased resistance by 13.8% (range: 3.0%-22.1%) compared to the standard connector; P < 0.001. The resistance increase was similar between long [17.3% (range: 3.0%-17.7%)] and shortened ETTs [15.3% (range: 5.0%-29.6%)]; P = 0.834. CONCLUSION CSS connectors were found to increase airway resistance in ventilated neonates. The contribution of CSS should be considered during ventilation, particularly in the presence of difficulty in providing sufficient tidal volume.","Ünal, Sezin; Ergenekon, Ebru; Kazanci, Ebru; Aktaş, Selma; Kulali, Ferit; Hirfanoğlu, İbrahim Murat; Türkyilmaz, Canan; Atalay, Yıldız",Turkish journal of medical sciences,https://doi.org/10.3906/sag-1606-177; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28618745/,114

This study investigated whether virus-virus or virus-Bordetella co-infections are more frequent or more severe than previously recognized. METHODS This is a 3-year prospective study of children younger than 24 months hospitalized with a febrile respiratory illness. Viral pathogens were detected using multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR), enzyme-linked immunoassays, and/or viral cultures from nasopharyngeal samples. Bordetella infections were detected by PCR. RESULTS A total of 201 patients were enrolled. Respiratory viruses were detected in 187 (93%) patients, with 52 (28%) multipathogen infections. The most common viruses detected were respiratory syncytial virus and rhinovirus/enterovirus. There were no differences in illness severity when comparing patients infected with one pathogen and those with multipathogen infection. CONCLUSION Virus co-infection in young children hospitalized with an acute febrile respiratory infection is common but does not appear to be associated with illness severity.","Suryadevara, Manika; Cummings, Erin; Bonville, Cynthia A; Bartholoma, Nadine; Riddell, Scott; Kiska, Deanna; Rosenberg, Helene F; Domachowske, Joseph B",Clinical pediatrics,https://doi.org/10.1177/0009922810394834; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21262758/,114

Between December 2011 and August 2013, a total of 23 patients with ZD underwent endoscopic surgery using the LigaSure™ technique in our department. A retrospective evaluation of the surgery was based on medical records and additionally a long-term follow-up was performed using a standardized questionnaire that was send to all patients. The questions dealt with complaints according to a visual analog scale (VAS) and were sent a minimum of one year after the surgery (mean time 22 months, range 12-32 month). The overall response rate was 91%. The mean age of the patients was 69 years (range 37-89 years). The patients reported nine for overall satisfaction on the VAS (range 0-10: 10 being very content and 0 very uncontent, 25 and 75% quartiles: 7 and 10) regarding the final outcome of their surgery, although several of the patients had continuous symptoms within the first postoperative year. Eight patients (38%) reported no symptoms at all. Our results suggest that endoscopic management of ZD with the LigaSure™ 5 mm instrument is a minimally invasive, fast and safe method with solid long-term outcome with relief of symptoms and patient satisfaction. This new operative instrument was not found inferior to traditional endoscopic techniques and is now the standard treatment method for ZD in our departments.","Andersen, Michelle Fog; Trolle, Waldemar; Anthonsen, Kristian; Nielsen, Hans Ulrik; Homøe, Preben",European archives of oto-rhino-laryngology : official journal of the European Federation of Oto-Rhino-Laryngological Societies (EUFOS) : affiliated with the German Society for Oto-Rhino-Laryngology - Head and Neck Surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00405-017-4489-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28220306/,114

We compared the cuff pressure of a TaperGuard ETT and a cylindrical ETT after lateral rotation of head during middle ear surgery. METHODS Fifty-two patients aged 18-70 years underwent a tympanomastoidectomy under general anesthesia were randomly allocated to receive endotracheal intubation with cylindrical (group C, n = 26) or TaperGuard ETTs (group T, n = 26). After endotracheal intubation, the ETT cuff pressure was set at 22 cmH2O in the neutral position of head. After lateral rotation of head, the cuff pressure was measured again and readjusted to 22 cmH2O. In addition, the change of distance from the carina to the tip of the ETT was measured before and after the positional change. The incidence of cough, sore throat, and hoarseness was assessed at 30 minutes, 6 hours, and 24 hours after surgery. RESULTS There was no difference in demographic data between groups. After lateral rotation of head, the cuff pressure significantly increased in group T (11.9 ± 2.3 cmH2O) compared with group C (6.0 ± 1.9 cmH2O) (P < 0.001). The incidence of a cuff pressure >30 cmH2O was higher in group T (96.2%) than in group C (30.8%) (P < 0.001). In addition, the degree of displacement of an ETT was greater in group T (11.0 ± 1.7 mm) than in group C (7.2 ± 2.6 mm) (P < 0.001). The overall incidences of postoperative sore throat, hoarseness, and cough at 30 minutes, 6 hours, and 24 hours after surgery were comparable between two groups. CONCLUSION The cuff pressure was higher in the TaperGuard ETT than in the cylindrical ETT after positional change of head from neutral to lateral rotation. In addition, after a positional change, the extent of displacement of ETT was greater in the TaperGuard ETT than in the cylindrical ETT.","Choi, Eunkyung; Park, Yongmin; Jeon, Younghoon",Medicine,https://doi.org/10.1097/md.0000000000006257; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28272230/,114

142800,The Possible Double-Edged Sword Effects of Vitamin D on COVID-19: A Hypothesis.,2020-09-29,"Asymmetric-flow field-flow fractionation (AF4) has been recognized as an invaluable tool for the characterisation of particle size, polydispersity, drug loading and stability of nanopharmaceuticals. However, the application of robust and high quality standard operating procedures (SOPs) is critical for accurate measurements, especially as these complex drug nanoformulations are most often inherently polydisperse. In this review we describe a unique international collaboration that lead to the development of a robust SOP for the measurement of physical-chemical properties of nanopharmaceuticals by multi-detector AF4 (MD-AF4) involving two state of the art infrastructures in the field of nanomedicine, the European Union Nanomedicine Characterization Laboratory (EUNCL) and the National Cancer Institute-Nanotechnology Characterisation Laboratory (NCI-NCL). We present examples of how MD-AF4 has been used for the analysis of key quality attributes, such as particle size, shape, drug loading and stability of complex nanomedicine formulations. The results highlight that MD-AF4 is a very versatile analytical technique to obtain critical information on a material particle size distribution, polydispersity and qualitative information on drug loading. The ability to conduct analysis in complex physiological matrices is an additional very important advantage of MD-AF4 over many other analytical techniques used in the field for stability studies. Overall, the joint NCI-NCL/EUNCL experience demonstrates the ability to implement a powerful and highly complex analytical technique such as MD-AF4 to the demanding quality standards set by the regulatory authorities for the pre-clinical safety characterization of nanomedicines.","Caputo, F; Mehn, D; Clogston, J D; Rösslein, M; Prina-Mello, A; Borgos, S E; Gioria, S; Calzolai, L",Journal of chromatography.

Accordingly, the aim of the present study was to investigate the spread of RGs in a fish-duck pond and the RGs and bacterial community of fish intestines. Five fish tanks, including a control tank and four experimental tanks (duck manure, duck manure + cefotaxime, duck manure + As, and duck manure + cefotaxime + As), were tested for 100 days. The results showed that duck manure increased both the diversity and relative abundance of RGs in fish intestines, and the addition of stress factors (cefotaxime, As) increased the relative abundance of RGs by one to two orders of magnitude. The stress-inducing effect of cefotaxime was greater than that of As. Tetracycline resistance genes were more sensitive to stress factors and were the predominant RGs in fish intestines. RGs in duck manure preferentially spread from the water to biofilm and then to fish intestines, whereas co-stress of cefotaxime and As obviously promoted the spread of RGs to fish intestines. In comparison to the control tank, duck manure and stress factors significantly changed the bacterial community of fish intestines. Correlation analysis also revealed that arsB, MOX, tetA and sul1 were significantly correlated with intI1 (P < 0.01), which hinted a potentially dissemination risk of RGs in fish intestines. These findings provide a theoretical basis for further investigating the dissemination of RGs in integrated culture systems and for evaluating the ecological risk of antibiotic and As use in aquaculture.","Zhou, Min; Xu, Yanbin; Ouyang, Pengqian; Ling, Jiayin; Cai, Qiujie; Du, Qingping; Zheng, Li",The Science of the total environment,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.138693; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32408202/,114

METHODS The Cochrane Library, PubMed, and ClinicalTrials.gov were searched from inception to February 28, 2021, to identify randomized controlled trials. The primary outcome was reintubation within 24-72 hours after a planned extubation. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. RESULTS Six articles presenting findings for 1746 patients were included. The effect of HFNC on the reintubation rate was noninferior to that of NIV (OR = 1.11, 95% CI: 0.85-1.44). The rate of treatment failure was 20.40% with HFNC versus 20.92% with NIV; this difference was nonsignificant (OR = 0.97, 95% CI: 0.72-1.32, P = 0.85). HFNC reduced the rates of skin lesion occurrence (10.28% versus 23.82%, OR = 0.37, 95% CI: 0.26-0.53, P < 0.00001) and post-extubation respiratory failure (23.76% versus 25.56%, OR = 0.64, 95% CI: 0.46-0.88, P = 0.006), compared with NIV.

The relationship between the progression of COVID-19 and Nutritional status is still unclear. We analyzed the clinical characteristics of 342 coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients, and analyzed the relationship between the progression of COVID-19 and Nutritional status. METHODOLOGY 342 COVID-19 were enrolled from ten different hospitals in China. The clinical characteristics were collected and analyzed. RESULTS The body mass index (BMI) of the mild patients (Group A) was higher than those in severe patients (Group B) and critical patients (Group C); The lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level of Group A was lower than those of the other two groups; Sex, age, and BMI, was strongly correlated with Clinical classification (CT); Among the laboratory test results, Neutrophil (NEU%), Aspartate aminotransferase (AST), LDH, and blood glucose (BG) were positively correlated with CT; Lymphocyte ( LYM%), Platelet (PLT), Albumin (ALB), and Creatinine (Cr) were negatively correlated with CT. BMI, NEU%, LYM%, ALB, Cr, and PLT are all protective factors that affect CT. CONCLUSION People with poor nutritional status (lower BMI and ALB) have a higher risk of developing severe disease after infection with SARS-CoV-2.

143302,Neuromodulation Approaches in Parkinson's Disease Using Deep Brain Stimulation and Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation.,2021-07-01,"RATIONALE Classical interpretation of cystic fibrosis (CF) lung disease pathogenesis suggests that infection initiates disease progression, leading to an exuberant inflammatory response, excessive mucus, and ultimately bronchiectasis. Although symptomatic antibiotic treatment controls lung infections early in disease, lifelong bacterial residence typically ensues. Processes that control the establishment of persistent bacteria in the CF lung, and the contribution of noninfectious components to disease pathogenesis, are poorly understood. OBJECTIVES To evaluate whether continuous antibiotic therapy protects the CF lung from disease using a ferret model that rapidly acquires lethal bacterial lung infections in the absence of antibiotics. METHODS CFTR (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator)-knockout ferrets were treated with three antibiotics from birth to several years of age and lung disease was followed by quantitative computed tomography, BAL, and histopathology. Lung disease was compared with CFTR-knockout ferrets treated symptomatically with antibiotics. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Bronchiectasis was quantified from computed tomography images. BAL was evaluated for cellular differential and features of inflammatory cellular activation, bacteria, fungi, and quantitative proteomics. Semiquantitative histopathology was compared across experimental groups. We demonstrate that lifelong antibiotics can protect the CF ferret lung from infections for several years. Surprisingly, CF animals still developed hallmarks of structural bronchiectasis, neutrophil-mediated inflammation, and mucus accumulation, despite the lack of infection. Quantitative proteomics of BAL from CF and non-CF pairs demonstrated a mucoinflammatory signature in the CF lung dominated by Muc5B and neutrophil chemoattractants and products. CONCLUSIONS These findings implicate mucoinflammatory processes in the CF lung as pathogenic in the absence of clinically apparent bacterial and fungal infections.","Rosen, Bradley H; Evans, T Idil Apak; Moll, Shashanna R; Gray, Jaimie S; Liang, Bo; Sun, Xingshen; Zhang, Yulong; Jensen-Cody, Chandler W; Swatek, Anthony M; Zhou, Weihong; He, Nan; Rotti, Pavana G; Tyler, Scott R; Keiser, Nicholas W; Anderson, Preston J; Brooks, Leonard; Li, Yalan; Pope, R Marshall; Rajput, Maheen; Hoffman, Eric A; Wang, Kai; Harris, J Kirk; Parekh, Kalpaj R; Gibson-Corley, Katherine N; Engelhardt, John F",American journal of respiratory and critical care medicine,https://doi.org/10.1164/rccm.201708-1616oc; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29327941/,114

143423,Targeting Pyrimidine Metabolism in the Era of Precision Cancer Medicine.,2021,"Mycoplasma pneumoniae is usually susceptible to macrolides, but macrolide-resistant strains have been found frequently in recent years. Mutations in domain V of the 23S rRNA gene of M. pneumoniae interfere with the binding of macrolides to rRNA and mediate macrolide resistance. In this study, we developed a rapid and inexpensive method that combines nested PCR (nPCR), single-strand conformation polymorphisms (SSCPs), and capillary electrophoresis (CE) to detect macrolide-resistant mutants directly from throat swabs. nPCR was used to specifically amplify M. pneumoniae 23S rRNA gene fragments containing mutations, and amplicons were analyzed by CE-SSCP for macrolide resistance mutations, with results confirmed by sequencing. From January to December 2009, 665 throat swabs were collected in Beijing, China, yielding 110 samples that tested positive for M. pneumoniae by nPCR and serological testing. We randomly selected 64 positive throat swabs for CE-SSCP analysis. The A2063G mutation was found in 57 samples, and a coexisting T2611C mutation was identified in 1 sample. An A2063T mutation was identified in 1 sample. The total mutation rate was 91%. All mutant samples identified by nPCR-CE-SSCP were sequenced. The nPCR-CE-SSCP method could identify macrolide-resistant mutants directly from clinical samples. This is the first report of an nPCR-CE-SSCP assay for the detection of dominant mutations that confer macrolide resistance on M. pneumoniae. This approach would allow clinicians to choose appropriate therapy rapidly and could be used as a screening method for genetic mutations related to antibiotic resistance.","Lin, Changying; Li, Shaoli; Sun, Hongmei; Zhao, Hanqing; Feng, Yanling; Cao, Ling; Yuan, Yi; Zhang, Ting",Journal of clinical microbiology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jcm.00400-10; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20861333/,114

Reply.,2020-10-27,"Liquid infused surfaces with partially wetting lubricants have recently been exploited for numerous intriguing applications, such as for droplet manipulation, droplet collection and spontaneous motion. When partially wetting lubricants are used, the pinning force is a key factor that can strongly affect droplet mobility. Here, we derive an analytical prediction for contact angle hysteresis in the limit where the meniscus size is much smaller than the droplet, and numerically study how it is controlled by the solid fraction, the lubricant wetting angles, and the various fluid surface tensions. We further relate the contact angle hysteresis and the pinning force experienced by a droplet on a liquid infused surface, and our predictions for the critical sliding angles are consistent with existing experimental observations. Finally, we discuss why a droplet on a liquid infused surface with partially wetting lubricants typically experiences stronger pinning compared to a droplet on a classical superhydrophobic surface.","Sadullah, Muhammad Subkhi; Panter, Jack R; Kusumaatmaja, Halim",Soft matter,https://doi.org/10.1039/d0sm00766h; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32734997/,114

Many institutions have developed virtual experiences to fill this void; however, the format and objectives of these experiences are variable. This article describes an education intervention for visiting students where both learner-oriented and program-oriented outcomes of a nonclerkship virtual student experience are explored. This intervention consisted of five 1-hour case-based teaching sessions in addition to attendance at weekly residency conference over a 1-week period. The primary outcomes were student ratings of how the experience impacted their 1) perception of the program's educational environment and culture, 2) medical knowledge, and 3) program ranking before and after the experience. Of 24 participants, 15 students (63%) completed the final evaluation, all with positive summative rankings in every domain measured. Of the 15 respondents, 12 (80%) reported an increase in where they would rank the program after the experience compared to before, and nine of 15 (60%) stated that they would rank the program #1 if making a list at the time they completed the final evaluation. Future study should examine long-term outcomes of these interventions including decisions regarding where students apply, who programs interview, and ranking decisions of students and programs.","Shappell, Eric; Egan, Daniel J; Eyre, Andrew; Nadel, Eric; Wittels, Kathleen",AEM education and training,https://doi.org/10.1002/aet2.10582; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34124526/,114
143881,COVID-19 Infection in Medical Laboratory Professional: a Note.,2020-06-01,"INTRODUCTION Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the cause of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) which recently has been characterized as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) having killed almost 250,000 people worldwide as of May 4th 2020. Despite the fact that SARS-CoV-2 seems to predominantly affect the respiratory system leading to pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome, it is now evident that it may also affect the cardiovascular system in multiple ways. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION The current paper is a review of the most recent literature regarding SARS-CoV-2 infection and its associated main cardiovascular clinical manifestations. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS Cardiovascular disease represents a prevalent underlying comorbidity associated with increased mortality rates among COVID-19 affected individuals. In addition, various cardiovascular manifestations have been linked to the viral insult, including among others acute coronary syndromes, myocarditis, acute heart failure, cardiac injury, arrhythmias and acute pulmonary embolism. CONCLUSIONS Further studies are required in order to establish the complicated association between SARS-CoV-2 infection and its effects on the cardiovascular system. Our knowledge regarding diagnostic approaches, therapeutic management and preventive measures is constantly enriched throughout an abundance of ongoing research in the respective fields.","Chatzis, Dimitrios G; Magounaki, Kalliopi T; Pantazopoulos, Ioannis N; Johnson, Elizabeth O; Tsioufis, Konstantinos P",Minerva cardioangiologica,https://doi.org/10.23736/s0026-4725.20.05298-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32472990/,114

METHODS The potential thermometry cost savings in two hospital systems-University Hospital Centre Zagreb (UHCZ), which uses TMT (device Covidien Genius 2) and University of Michigan Hospitals (UMH), which relies on OT, RT and AT (device Welch Allyn suretemp plus 692)-were analysed to evaluate institution-wide TAT (device Exergen TAT-5000) implementation. Two scenarios were developed: scenario 1, comparing costs for a period of 1, 3 and 5 years; scenario 2, calculation of the number of measurements per device for TAT to be cost-effective. RESULTS At UHCZ, use of TAT would bring budget savings regardless of the number of devices per bed and the number of years observed. Savings would range from US$0.08 million (one device per bed, impact for 1 year) to US$1.8 million (one device per 10 beds, impact for 5 years). At UMH, use of TAT would lead to budget savings if one device per 10 beds were acquired, but only over a period of 3 or 5 years. Other TAT scenarios were associated with budget costs at UMH even after a period of 5 years. CONCLUSIONS Sensitivity analyses showed that the price of current consumables had the highest impact on the model in both hospital settings, with TAT up to 10 times cheaper in that regard over TMT at UHCZ, potentially leading to considerable budget savings within a year of hospital-wide implementation.","Hayes, Kenneth; Shepard, Amanda; Cesarec, August; Likić, Robert",Postgraduate medical journal,https://doi.org/10.1136/postgradmedj-2016-134630; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28100807/,114
144461,A new approach to Actinic Folliculitis: prophylactic narrowband UVB phototherapy.,2020-11-20,"BACKGROUND To investigate whether anxiety and depression levels are associated with Heat Shock Protein 70 (HSP70) induction in the colon of patients with ulcerative colitis (UC). METHODS The design was cross-sectional. Clinical activity was assessed by the Rachmilewitz Index (CAI). Three psychometric questionnaires were used: Zung Depression Rating Scale (ZDRS), Spielberg State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Colon biopsies were obtained from each affected anatomical site. Severity of inflammation was assessed by eosin/hematoxylin. Constitutive (HSP70c) and inducible (HSP70i) HSP70 expression were immunohistochemically studied. RESULTS 29 UC patients were enrolled (69% men). Mean age was 46.5 years (SD: 19.5). Inflammation severity was moderate in 17 patients, severe in 6, and mild in 6. The mean number of years since diagnosis was 7.9 (SD: 6.5). The mean CAI was 6.4 (SD: 3.1). In active UC, there was downregulation of HSP70c in inflamed epithelium, without significant HSP70 induction. In 22/29 cases of active cryptitis, polymorphonuclear cells (PMN) clearly expressed HSP70i, with weak, focal positivity in the other 7 cases. Except for the hospital anxiety scale, scores in all psychometric tools were higher in patients with strong HSP70i immunoreactivity in the PMN. Logistic regression showed a strong positive relationship between HSP70i immunoreactivity in the PMN cells and scores in the trait anxiety, ZDRS, and hospital depression scales, (Odds ratios 1.3, 1.3, and 1.5; P = 0.018, 0.023, and 0.038; Wald test, 5.6, 5.2, and 4.3 respectively) and a weaker but significant positive correlation with the CAI (Odds ratio 1.654; P = 0.049; Wald test 3.858). CONCLUSION HSP70 is induced in PMN cells of UC patients and its induction correlates with depression and anxiety levels.","Vlachos, Ilias I; Barbatis, Calypso; Tsopanomichalou, Maria; Abou-Assabeh, Lydia; Goumas, Konstantinos; Ginieri-Coccossis, Maria; Economou, Marina; Papadimitriou, George N; Patsouris, Efstratios; Nicolopoulou-Stamati, Polyxeni",BMC gastroenterology,https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-230x-14-77; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24742079/,114

This study sought to compare the efficacy and safety of tirofiban and eptifibatide in patients with ACS. METHODS Within the ACUITY trial, 4,323 patients with moderate- and high-risk ACS received upstream, adjunctive GPI (tirofiban or eptifibatide) in addition to an antithrombin. Primary outcomes included 30-day rates of composite major adverse cardiac events (MACE), major bleeding (not related to coronary artery bypass grafting), and composite net adverse clinical events (NACE). The outcomes were compared based on the upstream GPI administered. RESULTS There were significant differences in the baseline characteristics of patients treated with tirofiban vs eptifibatide, particularly related to country/region. In unadjusted analyses, treatment with upstream tirofiban vs eptifibatide was associated with similar rates of major bleeding (5.8% vs 6.5%, P = .39) and nonsignificantly lower rates of MACE (6.1% vs 7.6%, P = .06) and NACE (10.6% vs 12.6%, P = .06). After propensity-based multivariable adjustment, there were no significant differences between tirofiban and eptifibatide with respect to 30-day major bleeding, MACE, or NACE. CONCLUSIONS Among more than 4,000 patients with moderate- and high-risk ACS treated with upstream GPI as part of an early invasive management strategy, the use of tirofiban and eptifibatide resulted in similar clinical outcomes. These data suggest equivalence of these 2 agents for upstream use, while highlighting some of the difficulties of nonrandomized comparative effectiveness analyses, specifically the difficulty in addressing geographic differences in the use of nonrandomized treatments.","Nazif, Tamim M; Mehran, Roxana; Lee, Edwin A M; Fahy, Martin; Parise, Helen; Stone, Gregg W; Kirtane, Ajay J",American heart journal,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ahj.2013.10.013; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24332141/,114

We consider a simple model in which agents without previous contact with the rumor, being skeptically oriented, may convince spreaders to stop their activity or, once exposed to the rumor, decide not to propagate it as a consequence, for example, of fact checking. We extend a previous, mean-field analysis of the combined effect of these two mechanisms, active and passive skepticism, to include spatial correlations. This can be done either analytically, through the pair approximation, or simulating an agent-based version on diverse networks. Our results show that while in mean field there is no coexistence between spreaders and susceptibles (although, depending on the parameters, there may be bistability depending on the initial conditions), when spatial correlations are included, because of the protective effect of the isolation provided by removed agents, coexistence is possible.","Amaral, Marco Antonio; Dantas, W G; Arenzon, Jeferson J",Physical review.

145167,Tension Pneumothorax After Percutaneous Tracheostomy.,2018,"Long-range heteronuclear single quantum correlation (LR-HSQC) experiments may be applied for detecting long-range correlations but suffer from two disadvantages, common to all heteronuclear long-range correlation experiments: (i) The information density in LR-HSQC spectra may be too high to be used directly without ""filtering out"" shorter range correlations, and (ii) often, substantial differences in intensity among cross peaks exist, potentially hampering the visualization of weak, often crucial cross peaks. In this contribution, we propose a modified LR-HSQC experiment, the LR-HTQC experiment (Long-Range Heteronuclear Triple Quantum Correlation) that partially solves the problems aforementioned. We show theoretically and experimentally that the LR-HTQC experiment removes the intense cross peaks of CH spin pairs, substantially reduces the medium intensity of cross peaks originating from CHH' spin systems, whereas the typically weak intensity of cross peaks of CHH'H″ and C(H)n, n > 3 spin systems is less affected. Consequently, the LR-HTQC experiment affords simplified long-range heteronuclear shift correlation spectra and scales down large intensity differences among different types of cross peaks, although a certain general reduction of signal intensities has to be accepted.","Bigler, Peter; Furrer, Julien",Magnetic resonance in chemistry : MRC,https://doi.org/10.1002/mrc.5078; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33411358/,114

Although anaphylaxis may occur after any vaccine, understanding the risk for this outcome, particularly following influenza vaccines, is important because of the large number of persons vaccinated annually. Recent Findings Two recent CDC safety studies confirmed the rarity of post-vaccination anaphylaxis. In a 25-year review of data from the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), reports in children were most common following childhood vaccinations and among adults more often followed influenza vaccine. In a Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD) study, the estimated incidence of anaphylaxis was 1.3 per million vaccine doses administered for all vaccines and 1.6 per million doses for IIV3 (trivalent) influenza vaccine. Summary Despite its rarity, its rapid onset (usually within minutes) and potentially lethal nature require that all personnel and facilities providing vaccinations have procedures in place for anaphylaxis management.","McNeil, Michael M",Current treatment options in allergy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s40521-019-00215-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31815089/,114
145584,Hippocampal dysfunction in Gulf War veterans: investigation with ASL perfusion MR imaging and physostigmine challenge.,2011,"Alterations in environmentally sensitive epigenetic mechanisms (e.g., DNA methylation) influence axonal regeneration in the spinal cord following sharp injury. Conventional DNA methylation detection methods using sodium bisulphite treatment do not distinguish between methylated and hydroxymethylated forms of cytosine, meaning that past studies report a composite of 5-methylcytosine (5mC) and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC). To identify the distinct contributions of DNA methylation modifications to axonal regeneration, we collected spinal cord tissue after sharp injury from untreated adult F3 male rats with enhanced regeneration of injured spinal axons or controls, derived from folate- or water-treated F0 lineages, respectively. Genomic DNA was profiled for genome-wide 5hmC levels, revealing 658 differentially hydroxymethylated regions (DhMRs). Genomic profiling with whole genome bisulphite sequencing disclosed regeneration-related alterations in composite 5mC + 5hmC DNA methylation levels at 2,260 differentially methylated regions (DMRs). While pathway analyses revealed that differentially hydroxymethylated and methylated genes are linked to biologically relevant axon developmental pathways, only 22 genes harbour both DhMR and DMRs. Since these differential modifications were more than 60 kilobases on average away from each other, the large majority of differential hydroxymethylated and methylated regions are unique with distinct functions in the axonal regeneration phenotype. These data highlight the importance of distinguishing independent contributions of 5mC and 5hmC levels in the central nervous system, and denote discrete roles for DNA methylation modifications in spinal cord injury and regeneration in the context of transgenerational inheritance.","Madrid, Andy; Borth, Laura E; Hogan, Kirk J; Hariharan, Nithya; Papale, Ligia A; Alisch, Reid S; Iskandar, Bermans J",Epigenetics,https://doi.org/10.1080/15592294.2020.1786320; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32633672/,114

The goal of the present study was to advance our understanding on this front. METHOD We isolated and examined motor kinematics associated with the learning of a rapid aimed limb movement in a sample of 40 individuals (13-34 years of age) with ETPKU and a matched comparison group of 40 individuals without phenylketonuria (PKU). Indices of motor learning included overall movement duration as well as the relative proportion of movement time devoted to ballistic and corrective submovements. (Note that practice of motor movements in nonclinical populations is associated with, not only improvements in overall speed, but also reduction in the proportion of movement time devoted to corrective submovements relative to an initial ballistic submovement.) Results: A group-by-time interaction was found. With practice, the non-PKU group showed a significant reduction in the proportion of movement time devoted to the corrected (as compared to the ballistic) submovement. A similar change was not observed for the ETPKU group. In addition, within the ETPKU group, the rate of improvement in total movement duration was correlated with recent blood phenylalanine levels (an indicator of treatment adherence). CONCLUSIONS Motor learning is adversely affected in individuals with ETPKU. Further investigation into the behavioral and neural mechanisms of motor learning in ETPKU will advance our understanding of the etiologic basis for this disruption as well as how it relates to the broader neurocognitive profile of ETPKU.

The major druggable targets of SARS-CoV-2 include 3-chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro), papain-like protease (PLpro), RNA-dependent 26 RNA polymerase, and spike (S) protein. Molecular docking studies have highlighted that quercetin, a natural polyphenol belonging to the flavonol class, inhibits 3CLpro, PLpro and S proteins. Biophysical technics have then very recently confirmed that quercetin is reasonably a potent inhibitor of 3CLpro. The likely antiviral properties of quercetin are anyway challenged by its very poor oral bioavailability profile and any attempt to overcome this limit should be welcome. A phospholipid complex of quercetin (Quercetin Phytosome®) has been recently tested in humans to evaluate a possible improvement in oral bioavailability. After hydrolysis of the conjugated form (mainly glucuronide) of quercetin found in human plasma, the pharmacokinetics results have demonstrated an increased bioavailability rate by about 20-fold for total quercetin. It has been also observed that the presence of specific glucuronidase could yield free systemic quercetin in human body. Taking also into considerations its anti-inflammatory and thrombin-inhibitory actions, a bioavailable form of quercetin, like Quercetin Phytosome®, should be considered a possible candidate to clinically face COVID-19.","Di Pierro, Francesco; Khan, Amjad; Bertuccioli, Alexander; Maffioli, Pamela; Derosa, Giuseppe; Khan, Saeed; Khan, Bilal A; Nigar, Roohi; Ujjan, Ikram; Devraian, Bikha R",Minerva gastroenterologica e dietologica,https://doi.org/10.23736/s1121-421x.20.02771-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33016666/,114

This study aimed to compare manual suture using the transanal endoscopic operation platform (TEO; Karl Storz, Tüttlingen, Germany) with the end-to-end anastomosis hemorrhoid circular stapler (EEA; Covidien, Dublin, Ireland) for closure of the rectal viscerotomy during transrectal NOTES segmental colectomy. MATERIALS AND METHODS A total of 12 swine underwent transrectal hybrid NOTES partial colectomies. Animals were divided into two groups according to the viscerotomy closure technique: 1) TEO manual suture; 2) EEA circular stapler closure. RESULTS Mean (± SD) viscerotomy closure time was 67.5 ± 59.5 minutes and 31.5 ± 19.6 minutes for TEO and EEA, respectively. There was one conversion to laparoscopy in the TEO group and a misfiring in the EEA group that required a TEO salvage suture. There was one positive air-leak test in each group. Peritoneal fluid collected at the end of the procedure tested positive for bacterial contamination in all cases. A mild stenosis was present in 4 /6 viscerotomies (67 %) in the TEO group and in 1/6 (17 %) in the EEA group on endoscopic control. Inflammatory changes were mild in 3/5 (60 %) and 4/5 (80 %) viscerotomies in the TEO and EEA groups, respectively, whereas severe inflammation was found in 2/5 (TEO) and 1 /5 (EEA). CONCLUSION Transrectal viscerotomy closure using the EEA circular stapler technique is feasible, easy to perform, and histologically comparable to suture closure through a TEO platform. It may offer an attractive alternative for NOTES segmental colectomies and endoscopic resections.","Diana, M; Leroy, J; Wall, J; De Ruijter, V; Lindner, V; Dhumane, P; Mutter, D; Marescaux, J",Endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0032-1308911; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22638781/,114
147114,"Flow-mediated dilation, nitroglycerin-mediated dilation and their ratio predict successful renal denervation in mild resistant hypertension.",2018,"BACKGROUND Preterm birth is the leading cause of death in children younger than 5 years worldwide. Although preterm survival rates have increased in high-income countries, preterm newborns still die because of a lack of adequate newborn care in many low-income and middle-income countries. We estimated global, regional, and national rates of preterm birth in 2014, with trends over time for some selected countries. METHODS We systematically searched for data on preterm birth for 194 WHO Member States from 1990 to 2014 in databases of national civil registration and vital statistics (CRVS). We also searched for population-representative surveys and research studies for countries with no or limited CRVS data. For 38 countries with high-quality data for preterm births in 2014, data are reported directly. For countries with at least three data points between 1990 and 2014, we used a linear mixed regression model to estimate preterm birth rates. We also calculated regional and global estimates of preterm birth for 2014. FINDINGS We identified 1241 data points across 107 countries. The estimated global preterm birth rate for 2014 was 10·6% (uncertainty interval 9·0-12·0), equating to an estimated 14·84 million (12·65 million-16·73 million) live preterm births in 2014. 12· 0 million (81·1%) of these preterm births occurred in Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. Regional preterm birth rates for 2014 ranged from 13·4% (6·3-30·9) in North Africa to 8·7% (6·3-13·3) in Europe. India, China, Nigeria, Bangladesh, and Indonesia accounted for 57·9 million (41×4%) of 139·9 million livebirths and 6·6 million (44×6%) of preterm births globally in 2014. Of the 38 countries with high-quality data, preterm birth rates have increased since 2000 in 26 countries and decreased in 12 countries. Globally, we estimated that the preterm birth rate was 9×8% (8×3-10×9) in 2000, and 10×6% (9×0-12×0) in 2014. INTERPRETATION Preterm birth remains a crucial issue in child mortality and improving quality of maternal and newborn care. To better understand the epidemiology of preterm birth, the quality and volume of data needs to be improved, including standardisation of definitions, measurement, and reporting.

METHODS The study population consisted of healthcare workers from LMICs who partook in the questionnaire survey from March 1, 2020, until April 15, 2020. RESULTS In the bivariate analysis, gender (p = 0.05), HCWs (p < 0.01), and of care (p < 0.01) were associated with the public or private sector (p < 0.05). Using multivariate analysis, PPE factors were associated with the health sector (p < 0.05). The multivariate logistic regression model determined a Pearson's χ2 of 706.736 (d.f. = 726, p = -0.689) and a c-statistic of 0.592, indicating a good model. CONCLUSION In LMICs, huge discrepancies are present in PPE provision to HCWs, especially among the public healthcare sectors. Efforts at national and international protective levels ought to be addressed to protect frontline HCWs at higher risk of contracting COVID-19.","Sarfraz, Azza; Sarfraz, Zouina; Anwer, Ammar; Sarfraz, Muzna; Siddiq, Javaria",Journal of occupational and environmental medicine,https://doi.org/10.1097/jom.0000000000002028; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32956236/,114

147957,Major complications of high-energy microwave ablation for percutaneous CT-guided treatment of lung malignancies: Single-centre experience after 4 years.,2015,"BACKGROUND Centrifugation is a popular processing method, with an unclear mechanism of action. Hypotheses include fat concentration, reduced inflammatory response by removal of blood, and concentration of adipose-derived stem cells. The authors performed multiple experiments to determine the role of centrifugation and compared it with a different processing method (mesh/gauze technique). METHODS Lipoaspirate components were quantified after centrifugation at increasing speed to determine concentration efficacy. For comparison, the authors quantified the concentration efficacy of mesh/gauze. They also compared the number of adipose-derived stem cells isolated by either method. To determine the effects of each component, they compared fat alone to fat mixed with various spinoff components in a mouse model. They also compared centrifugation to mesh/gauze. RESULTS The adipocyte fraction remains constant above 5000 g, whereas 1200 g results in 91 percent concentrated fat. Mesh/gauze also results in 90 percent concentrated fat. The number of adipose-derived stem cells in 1 g of fat was 1603 ± 2020 and 1857 ± 1832 in the centrifuge and mesh/gauze groups, respectively (p = 0.86). Five ""add-back"" groups were created: fat plus oil, fat plus surgical tumescence, fat plus fresh tumescence, fat plus cell pellets and fresh tumescence, and fat plus cell pellets. The fat-only group had better retention than the groups mixed with tumescence, regardless of whether it was surgical, fresh, or had cell pellets. Oil did not affect grafts. Centrifugation at 1200 g was equivalent to mesh/gauze (0.73 ± 0.12 g and 0.72 ± 0.13 g, respectively). CONCLUSIONS Centrifugation improves graft retention by concentration of the adipocyte fraction. The concentration efficacy of mesh/gauze is equivalent to centrifugation at 1200 g, with equivalent in vivo outcomes.","Salinas, Harry M; Broelsch, G Felix; Fernandes, Justin R; McCormack, Michael C; Meppelink, Amanda M; Randolph, Mark A; Colwell, Amy S; Austen, William G",Plastic and reconstructive surgery,https://doi.org/10.1097/prs.0000000000000524; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24945949/,114
148161,Dermoscopy of lichen planus under polarized versus nonpolarized mode: a retrospective analysis of 14 patients.,2021-01-23,"BACKGROUND AND STUDY AIMS Studies have shown that PPIs are frequently used in an inappropriate way, above the standard doses, and against the recommendations, leading to adverse events like malabsorption problems, community acquired pneumonia, hip fractures and Clostridium difficile colitis. In Lebanon only one study about the out-patient use of PPI was done in community pharmacies, but in-patient prescription studies are inexistent. Our study will evaluate the use of PPIs in a hospital setting in Lebanon and will compare it to international recommendations. PATIENTS AND METHODS A cross-sectional study, conducted in a university hospital in Lebanon (CHU NDS) between June and November 2018, included 186 randomly selected Lebanese inpatient adults. RESULTS Less than half of the participants (46.8%) received a PPI for the adequate indication and 83.9% received the adequate PPI molecule, whereas only 9.2% received the adequate dose. The rate of PPI misuse was higher in the surgery ward (59.6%) than in the medicine department (40.4%) (Cardiology, internal medicine, neurology, pneumology, nephrology, infectious diseases, gastro-enterology, rheumatology). Concerning age, 56.3% of the ≥ 65 years old patients were taking PPI for the right indication. However, among those who are < 65 years old, only 43.7% of the prescriptions were recommended. Also adequate PPI indication and adequate choice of drug was mainly noticed in patients having GI history or taking antiplatelet therapy. CONCLUSION Our study has shown that a significant amount of PPIs was prescribed inadequately leading to a need to re-evaluate or adjust the use of PPIs among Lebanese physicians.","Souaid, Christophe Karl; Maalouf, Rami George; Hallit, Souheil; Akiki, Bassem; Dagher, Elissar",Arab journal of gastroenterology : the official publication of the Pan-Arab Association of Gastroenterology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajg.2020.07.008; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32830092/,114
148470,Early Neurologic Deterioration in Lacunar Stroke: Clinical and Imaging Predictors and Association With Long-term Outcome.,2021-08-16,"Background: Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) treat an expanding range of cancers. Consistent basic data suggest that these same checkpoints are critical negative regulators of atherosclerosis. Therefore, our objectives were to test whether ICIs were associated with accelerated atherosclerosis and a higher risk of atherosclerosis-related cardiovascular events. Methods: The study was situated in a single academic medical center. The primary analysis evaluated whether exposure to an ICI was associated with atherosclerotic cardiovascular events in 2842 patients and 2842 controls, matched by age, a history of cardiovascular events and cancer type. In a second design, a case-crossover analysis was performed with an ""at-risk period"" defined as the two-year period after and the ""control period"" as the two-year prior to treatment. The primary outcome was a composite of atherosclerotic cardiovascular events (myocardial infarction, coronary revascularization and ischemic stroke). Secondary outcomes included the individual components of the primary outcome. Additionally, in an imaging sub-study (n=40), the rate of atherosclerotic plaque progression was compared from before and after starting an ICI. All study measures and outcomes were blindly adjudicated. Results: In the matched cohort study, there was a 3-fold higher risk for cardiovascular events after starting an ICI (HR, 3.3 [95% CI, 2.0-5.5]; P<0.001). There was a similar increase in each of the individual components of the primary outcome. In the case-crossover, there was also an increase in cardiovascular events from 1.37 to 6.55 per 100 person-years at two years (adjusted HR, 4.8 [95% CI, 3.5-6.5]; P<0.001). In the imaging study, the rate of progression of total aortic plaque volume was >3-fold higher with ICIs (from 2.1%/year pre-to 6.7%/year post). This association between ICI use and increased atherosclerotic plaque progression was attenuated with concomitant use of statins or corticosteroids. Conclusions: Cardiovascular events were higher after initiation of ICIs, potentially mediated by accelerated progression of atherosclerosis. Optimization of cardiovascular risk factors and increased awareness of cardiovascular risk, prior to, during and after treatment, should be considered among patients on an ICI.","Drobni, Zsofia D; Alvi, Raza M; Taron, Jana; Zafar, Amna; Murphy, Sean P; Rambarat, Paula K; Mosarla, Ramya C; Lee, Charlotte; Zlotoff, Daniel A; Raghu, Vineet K; Hartmann, Sarah E; Gilman, Hannah K; Gong, Jingyi; Zubiri, Leyre; Sullivan, Ryan J; Reynolds, Kerry L; Mayrhofer, Thomas; Zhang, Lili; Hoffmann, Udo; Neilan, Tomas G",Circulation,https://doi.org/10.1161/circulationaha.120.049981; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33003973/,114

METHODS A prospective consecutive series of 52 women with a stage 2 vaginal vault prolapse or higher that occurred after total hysterectomy who underwent surgery between 2003 and 2007. Principal outcome measures were anatomic cure (stage 1 or lower) and impact on quality of life measured using the pelvic floor distress inventory (PFDI) and pelvic floor impact self-reported questionnaire (PFIQ). Anatomical results were analyzed using chi(2) and Fisher exact tests, and PFDI and PFIQ scores were analyzed using the Wilcoxon test. RESULTS With a median follow-up of 36months, the anatomic cure rate was 96%. Significant improvements were noted in POPQ-S scores after surgery (P<0.05). Stress urinary incontinence was cured in 73% of patients and improved in 15% of patients. The PFDI and PFIQ scores were improved (P<0.05). One mesh extrusion was observed. The rates of mesh contraction and new cases of dyspareunia were 31% and 13%, respectively.

148856,The Effect of Skin Pigmentation on the Accuracy of Pulse Oximetry in Infants with Hypoxemia.,2017,"OBJECTIVES To provide systematically evaluated evidence of prospective associations between exposure to physical, psychological and gender-based violence and health among healthcare, social care and education workers. METHODS The guidelines on Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses were followed. Medline, Cinahl, Web of Science and PsycInfo were searched for population: human service workers; exposure: workplace violence; and study type: prospective or longitudinal in articles published 1990-August 2019. Quality assessment was performed based on a modified version of the Cochrane's 'Tool to Assess Risk of Bias in Cohort Studies'. RESULTS After deduplication, 3566 studies remained, of which 132 articles were selected for full-text screening and 28 were included in the systematic review. A majority of the studies focused on healthcare personnel, were from the Nordic countries and were assessed to have medium quality. Nine of 11 associations between physical violence and poor mental health were statistically significant, and 3 of 4 associations between physical violence and sickness absence. Ten of 13 associations between psychological violence and poor mental health were statistically significant and 6 of 6 associations between psychological violence and sickness absence. The only study on gender-based violence and health reported a statistically non-significant association. CONCLUSION There is consistent evidence mainly in medium quality studies of prospective associations between psychological violence and poor mental health and sickness absence, and between physical violence and poor mental health in human service workers. More research using objective outcomes, improved exposure assessment and that focus on gender-based violence is needed.","Nyberg, Anna; Kecklund, Göran; Hanson, Linda Magnusson; Rajaleid, Kristiina",Occupational and environmental medicine,https://doi.org/10.1136/oemed-2020-106450; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32414952/,114

149580,COVID-19 Hits Cancer Research Funding.,2020-04-24,"BACKGROUND Aeromedical transport of critically ill patients requires continued, accurate performance of equipment at altitude. Changes in barometric pressure can affect the performance of mechanical ventilators calibrated for operation at sea level. Deploying ventilators that can maintain a consistent tidal volume (VT) delivery at various altitudes is imperative for lung protection when transporting wounded war fighters to each echelon of care. METHODS Three ventilators (Impact 731, Hamilton T1, and CareFusion Revel) were tested at pediatric (50 and 100 mL) and adult (250-750 mL) tidal VTs at 0 and 20 cm H₂O positive end expiratory pressure and at inspired oxygen of 0.21 and 1.0. Airway pressure, volume, and flow were measured at sea level as well as at 8,000, 16,000, and 22,000 ft (corresponding to barometric pressures of 760, 564, 412, and 321 mm Hg) using a calibrated pneumotachograph connected to a training test lung in an altitude chamber. Set VT and delivered VT as well as changes in VT at each altitude were compared by t test. RESULTS The T1 delivered VT within 10% of set VT at 8,000 ft. The mean VT was less than set VT at sea level as a result of circuit compressible volume with the Revel and the 731. Changes in VT varied widely among the devices at sea level and at altitude. Increasing altitudes resulted in larger VT than set for the Revel and the T1. The 731 compensated for changes in altitude delivered VT within 10% at the adult settings at all altitudes. CONCLUSION Altitude compensation is an active software algorithm. Only the 731 actively accounts for changes in barometric pressure to maintain the set VT at all tested altitudes.","Blakeman, Thomas; Britton, Tyler; Rodriquez, Dario; Branson, Richard",The journal of trauma and acute care surgery,https://doi.org/10.1097/ta.0000000000000379; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25159349/,114

President Jair Bolsonaro's dangerous brew of neoliberal authoritarianism, science denialism and ableism has plunged this country into catastrophe. In this article we argue that this form (or lack) of public health governance can best be described as governance without (central) government. We begin with an overview of public health governance in the country before introducing the main theoretical concepts that guide our analysis, namely the notions of 'government by exception' and 'strategic ignorance'. Finally, we sketch the main features of this emerging form of (non)governance of COVID-19. We highlight the new forms of solidarity and mutual aid that have emerged in favelas and Indigenous communities, which have stepped in to fill the void left by a limited federal presence. The article concludes by reflecting on what this collapse of public health reveals about the limitations of democratic governance in the age of Bolsonaro.","Ortega, Francisco; Orsini, Michael",Global public health,https://doi.org/10.1080/17441692.2020.1795223; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32663117/,114
149820,Creating a Blueprint of Well-Being in Oncology: An Approach for Addressing Burnout From ASCO's Clinician Well-Being Taskforce.,2021-06-01,"INTRODUCTION While much of the literature on homelessness is centred on the experience of men, women make up over one-quarter of Canada's homeless population. Research has shown that women experiencing homelessness are often hidden (i.e. provisionally housed) and have different pathways into homelessness and different needs as compared to men. The objective of this research is to identify evidence-based interventions and best practices to better support women experiencing or at risk of homelessness. METHODS We conducted a scoping review with a gender and equity analysis. This involved searching MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsycINFO and other databases for systematic reviews and randomized trials, supplementing our search through reference scanning and grey literature, followed by a qualitative synthesis of the evidence that examined gender and equity considerations. RESULTS Of the 4102 articles identified on homelessness interventions, only 4 systematic reviews and 9 randomized trials were exclusively conducted on women or published disaggregated data enabling a gender analysis. Interventions with the strongest evidence included post-shelter advocacy counselling for women experiencing homelessness due to intimate partner violence, as well as case management and permanent housing subsidies (e.g. tenant-based rental assistance vouchers), which were shown to reduce homelessness, food insecurity, exposure to violence and psychosocial distress, as well as promote school stability and child well-being. CONCLUSION Much of the evidence on interventions to better support women experiencing homelessness focusses on those accessing domestic violence or family shelters. Since many more women are experiencing or at risk of hidden homelessness, population-based strategies are also needed to reduce gender inequity and exposure to violence, which are among the main structural drivers of homelessness among women.","Andermann, Anne; Mott, Sebastian; Mathew, Christine M; Kendall, Claire; Mendonca, Oreen; Harriott, Dawnmarie; McLellan, Andrew; Riddle, Alison; Saad, Ammar; Iqbal, Warda; Magwood, Olivia; Pottie, Kevin","Health promotion and chronic disease prevention in Canada : research, policy and practice",https://doi.org/10.24095/hpcdp.41.1.01; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33439566/,114
149984,The Development and Preliminary Impact of CAMP Air: A Web-based Asthma Intervention to Improve Asthma Among Adolescents.,2020-09-15,"Two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have attracted considerable attention owing to their synergetic effects with other 2D materials, such as graphene and hexagonal boron nitride, in TMD-based heterostructures. Therefore, it is important to understand the physical properties of TMD-TMD vertical heterostructures for their applications in next-generation electronic devices. However, the conventional synthesis process of TMD-TMD heterostructures has some critical limitations, such as nonreproducibility and low yield. In this paper, we synthesize wafer-scale MoS2-WS2 vertical heterostructures (MWVHs) using plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PE-CVD) via penetrative single-step sulfurization discovered by time-dependent analysis. This method is available for fabricating uniform large-area vertical heterostructures (4 in.) at a low temperature (300 °C). MWVHs were characterized using various spectroscopic and microscopic techniques, which revealed their uniform nanoscale polycrystallinity and the presence of vertical layers of MoS2 and WS2. In addition, wafer-scale MWVHs diodes were fabricated and demonstrated uniform performance by current mapping. Furthermore, mode I fracture tests were performed using large double cantilever beam specimens to confirm the separation of the MWVHs from the SiO2/Si substrate. Therefore, this study proposes a synthesis mechanism for TMD-TMD heterostructures and provides a fundamental understanding of the interfacial properties of TMD-TMD vertical heterostructures.","Seok, Hyunho; Megra, Yonas Tsegaye; Kanade, Chaitanya K; Cho, Jinill; Kanade, Vinit K; Kim, Minjun; Lee, Inkoo; Yoo, Pil J; Kim, Hyeong-U; Suk, Ji Won; Kim, Taesung",ACS nano,https://doi.org/10.1021/acsnano.0c06989; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33411506/,114

Although various classifications were developed in order to define the resection margins of this operation, no clear standardization could be achieved both in the nomenclature and in the extent of the surgery. Total mesometrial resection (TMMR) is a novel procedure which aims to remove all components of the compartment formed by Müllerian duct in which female reproductive organs develop. TMMR differs from the conventional radical hysterectomy techniques in that its surgical philosophy, terminology, and partly resection borders are different. In this paper, a TMMR with therapeutic pelvic lymphadenectomy operation that we performed for the first time with robot-assisted laparoscopic (robotic) approach in an early-stage cervical cancer patient was presented. This procedure has already been described in open surgery by Michael Höckel and translated to the robotic surgery by Rainer Kimmig. Our report is the second paper, to our knowledge, to present the initial experience regarding robotic TMMR in the English literature.","Toptas, Tayfun; Uysal, Aysel; Ureyen, Isin; Erol, Onur; Simsek, Tayup",Case reports in surgery,https://doi.org/10.1155/2016/4616343; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27195167/,114

The IBV S-ectodomain protein, which is S excluding the transmembrane anchor and short cytoplasmic domain of S2, expressed from recombinant LS corresponds to an Arkansas (Ark)-type IBV. In a first experiment, chickens were primed at 1 day of age or primed at 1 day of age and boosted at 14 days of age with 104 50% embryo infectious doses (EID50)/bird of rLS/IBV.Se and challenged with a virulent Ark strain. A single vaccination proved completely ineffective at protecting chickens against challenge, whereas priming and boosting reduced clinical signs and tracheal lesions but did not reduce viral load in lachrymal fluids. In experiment 2, the vaccine dose was increased to 107 EID50/bird and a different virulent Ark strain was used for challenge. In addition, chickens were singly immunized on either day 1 or day 10 after hatch. NDV antibody levels detected in vaccinated chickens were moderate, with hemagglutination inhibition titers varying between 4 and 5 log2. Slightly higher antibody levels to NDV were observed in chickens vaccinated on day 10 versus day 1 but without the difference achieving statistical significance. In contrast, antibody responses measured using recombinant IBV S1 protein-coated ELISA plates were significantly greater in chickens vaccinated on day 10 than on day 1. The use of a higher rLS/IBV.Se dose substantially enhanced the success of a single vaccination compared to experiment 1. Signs and tracheal lesions were reduced more effectively in chickens vaccinated at day 10 after hatch. However, as in experiment 1, vaccination did not reduce the viral loads in tear fluids of challenged chickens. Similar results, in which no reduction in viral load in the trachea was apparent from rLS/IBV.S vaccination, have been obtained by others. Further work is needed to understand the immune responses induced by this recombinant virus that seems to provide some protection against the disease but does not reduce viral loads in the upper respiratory tract.","Zegpi, R A; He, L; Yu, Q; Joiner, K S; van Santen, V L; Toro, H",Avian diseases,https://doi.org/10.1637/0005-2086-64.1.53; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32267125/,114

METHODS We retrospectively reviewed all patients with AIS from the prospectively constructed Acute Stroke Registry and Analysis of Lausanne during 8.25 years. AIS-C were defined as a failure to suspect stroke or as incorrect exclusion of stroke diagnosis. They were compared with patients diagnosed correctly at the time of admission. RESULTS Forty-seven of 2,200 AIS were missed (2.1%). These AIS-C were either very mild or very severe strokes. Multivariate analysis showed a younger age in patients with AIS-C (odds ratio [OR] per year 0.98, p < 0.01), less prestroke statin treatment (OR 0.29, p = 0.04), and lower diastolic admission blood pressure (OR 0.98 p = 0.04). They showed less eye deviation (OR 0.21, p = 0.04) and more cerebellar strokes (OR 3.78, p < 0.01). AIS-C were misdiagnosed as other neurologic (42.6% of cases) or nonneurologic (17.0%) disease, as unexplained decreased level of consciousness (21.3%), and as concomitantly present disease (19.1%). At 12 months, patients with AIS-C had less favorable outcomes (adjusted OR 0.21, p < 0.01) and higher mortality (adjusted OR 4.37, p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS AIS are missed in patients with younger age with a lower cerebrovascular risk profile and may be masked by other acute conditions. Patients with chameleons present more often with milder strokes or coma, fewer focal signs and cerebellar strokes, and have higher disability and mortality rates at 12 months. These findings may be used to raise awareness in emergency departments to recognize and treat such patients appropriately.","Richoz, Benjamin; Hugli, Olivier; Dami, Fabrice; Carron, Pierre-Nicolas; Faouzi, Mohamed; Michel, Patrik",Neurology,https://doi.org/10.1212/wnl.0000000000001830; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26180146/,114
151089,Game-theoretical mapping of fundamental brain functions based on lesion deficits in acute stroke.,2021,"Collagen I is an essential structural and mechanical building block of various tissues, and it is often used as tissue-engineering scaffolds. However, collagen-based constructs reconstituted in vitro often lacks robust fiber structure, mechanical stability, and molecule binding capability. To enhance these performances, the present study developed 3-D collagen-nanotube composite constructs with two types of functionalized carbon nanotubes, carboxylated nanotubes and covalently functionalized nanotubes (CFNTs). The influences of nanotube functionalization and loading concentration on the collagen fiber structure, mechanical property, biocompatibility, and molecule binding were examined. Results revealed that surface modification and loading concentration of nanotubes determined the interactions between nanotubes and collagen fibrils, thus altering the structure and property of nanotube-collagen composites. Scanning electron microscopy and confocal microscopy revealed that the incorporation of CFNT in collagen-based constructs was an effective means of restructuring collagen fibrils because CFNT strongly bound to collagen molecules inducing the formation of larger fibril bundles. However, increased nanotube loading concentration caused the formation of denser fibril network and larger aggregates. Static stress-strain tests under compression showed that the addition of nanotube into collagen-based constructs did not significantly increase static compressive moduli. Creep/recovery testing under compression revealed that CFNT-collagen constructs showed improved mechanical stability under continuous loading. Testing with endothelial cells showed that biocompatibility was highly dependent on nanotube loading concentration. At a low loading level, CFNT-collagen showed higher endothelial coverage than the other tested constructs or materials. Additionally, CFNT-collagen showed capability of binding to other biomolecules to enhance the construct functionality. In conclusion, functionalized nanotube-collagen composites, particularly CFNT-collagen composites, could be promising materials, which provide structural support showing bundled fibril structure, biocompatibility, multifunctionality, and mechanical stability, but rigorous control over chemical modification, loading concentration, and nanotube dispersion are needed.","Tan, Wei; Twomey, John; Guo, Dongjie; Madhavan, Krishna; Li, Min",IEEE transactions on nanobioscience,https://doi.org/10.1109/tnb.2010.2043367; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20215088/,114

Previous reports have focused primarily on short-term results of sacral nerve stimulation for fecal incontinence. The present study reports the long-term effectiveness and safety of sacral nerve stimulation for fecal incontinence in a large prospective multicenter study. DESIGN AND METHODS Patients with fecal incontinent episodes more than twice per week were offered participation in this multicentered prospective trial. Patients showing ≥ 50% improvement during test stimulation were offered chronic implantation of the InterStim Therapy system (Medtronic; Minneapolis, MN). The aims of the current report were to provide 3-year follow-up data on patients from that study who underwent sacral nerve stimulation and were monitored under the rigors of an Food and Drug Administration-approved investigational protocol. RESULTS One hundred thirty-three patients underwent test stimulation with a 90% success rate, of whom 120 (110 females) with a mean age of 60.5 years and a mean duration of fecal incontinence of 7 years received chronic implantation. Mean length of follow-up was 3.1 (range, 0.2-6.1) years, with 83 patients completing all or part of the 3-year follow-up assessment. At 3 years follow-up, 86% of patients (P < .0001) reported ≥ 50% reduction in the number of incontinent episodes per week compared with baseline and the number of incontinent episodes per week decreased from a mean of 9.4 at baseline to 1.7. Perfect continence was achieved in 40% of subjects. The therapy also improved the fecal incontinence severity index. Sacral nerve stimulation had a positive impact on the quality of life, as evidenced by significant improvements in all 4 scales of the Fecal Incontinence Quality of Life instrument at 12, 24, and 36 months of follow-up. The most common device- or therapy-related adverse events through the mean 36 months of follow-up included implant site pain (28%), paresthesia (15%), change in the sensation of stimulation (12%), and infection (10%). There were no reported unanticipated adverse device effects associated with sacral nerve stimulation therapy. CONCLUSIONS Sacral nerve stimulation using InterStim Therapy is a safe and effective treatment for patients with fecal incontinence. These data support long-term safety and effectiveness to 36 months.","Mellgren, Anders; Wexner, Steven D; Coller, John A; Devroede, Ghislain; Lerew, Darin R; Madoff, Robert D; Hull, Tracy",Diseases of the colon and rectum,https://doi.org/10.1097/dcr.0b013e31822155e9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21825885/,114

Concerns about the contribution of prescribed opioids, and particularly high-dose opioids, continue to mount as do initiatives to reduce prescribing. Evidence around opioid tapering, which can be challenging and potentially hazardous, is not well developed. A recent national guideline has recognized this and recommended referral to multidisciplinary care for challenging cases of opioid tapering. However, multidisciplinary care for opioid tapering is not well understood or defined. OBJECTIVE Identify the existing literature on any multidisciplinary care programs that evaluate impact on opioid use, synthesize how these programs work and clarify whom they benefit. STUDY DESIGN Systematic rapid realist review. DATASET Bibliographic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Cochrane Library), grey literature, reference hand search and formal expert consultation. RESULTS 95 studies were identified. 75% of the programs were from the United States and the majority (n = 62) were published after 2000. A minority (n = 23) of programs reported on >12 month opioid use outcomes. There were three necessary but insufficient mechanisms common to all programs: pain relief, behavior change and active medication management. Programs that did not include a combination of all three mechanisms did not result in opioid dose reductions. A concerning 20-40% of subjects resumed opioid use within one year of program completion. CONCLUSIONS Providing alternative analgesia is insufficient for reducing opioid doses. Even high quality primary care multidisciplinary care programs do not reduce prescribed opioid use unless there is active medication management accomplished by changing the primary opioid prescriber. Rates of return to use of opioids from these programs are very concerning in the current context of a highly potent and lethal street drug supply. This contextual factor may be powerful enough to undermine the modest benefits of opioid dose reduction via multidisciplinary care.","Sud, Abhimanyu; Armas, Alana; Cunningham, Heather; Tracy, Shawn; Foat, Kirk; Persaud, Navindra; Hosseiny, Fardous; Hyland, Sylvia; Lowe, Leyna; Zlahtic, Erin; Murti, Rhea; Derue, Hannah; Birnbaum, Ilana; Bonin, Katija; Upshur, Ross; Nelson, Michelle L A",PloS one,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0236419; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32716982/,114

Sixty days after onset of symptoms, 13/78 (17%) study participants had borderline or negative results to an ELISA detecting IgG against the S1 protein of SARS-CoV-2. We analyzed participants with PCR-confirmed infection who had strong antibody responses (ratio >3) as positive controls and participants without symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection and without household contact with infected patients as negative controls. Using interferon-γ ELISpot, we observed that 78% of PCR-positive volunteers with undetectable antibodies showed T cell immunity against SARS-CoV-2. We observed a similar frequency (80%) of T-cell immunity in convalescent donors with strong antibody responses but did not detect immunity in negative controls. We concluded that, in convalescent patients with undetectable SARS-CoV-2 IgG, immunity may be mediated through T cells.","Schwarzkopf, Sina; Krawczyk, Adalbert; Knop, Dietmar; Klump, Hannes; Heinold, Andreas; Heinemann, Falko M; Thümmler, Laura; Temme, Christian; Breyer, Marianne; Witzke, Oliver; Dittmer, Ulf; Lenz, Veronika; Horn, Peter A; Lindemann, Monika",Emerging infectious diseases,https://doi.org/10.3201/2701.203772; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33058753/,114

The importance of nurses in addressing health care delivery challenges cannot be overstated. PURPOSE To present a Nursing Health Services Research (NHSR) agenda for the 2020s. METHOD A meeting of an interdisciplinary group of 38 health services researchers to discuss five key challenges facing health care delivery (behavioral health, primary care, maternal/neonatal outcomes, the aging population, health care spending) and identify the most pressing and feasible research questions for NHSR in the coming decade. FINDINGS Guided by a list of inputs affecting health care delivery (health information technology, workforce, delivery systems, payment, social determinants of health), meeting participants identified 5 to 6 research questions for each challenge. Also, eight cross-cutting themes illuminating the opportunities and barriers facing NHSR emerged.

This disease has caused significant economic losses to the poultry industry worldwide. The rapid and simple detection of NDV infection is crucial to inform the appropriate control measures. We developed a reverse-transcription recombinase polymerase amplification (RT-RPA) assay combined with a lateral flow assay (LFA) for NDV detection. The RPA assay can be completed at 37°C within 20 min, and the RPA result can be visualized by the LFA within 5 min. The NDV RT-RPA-LFA detected NDV specifically with no cross-reactivity with other pathogens. The detection limit of NDV cDNA with our RT-RPA-LFA was 3.34 × 10-3 ng/μL. Consequently, the RT-RPA-LFA showed good potential for the detection of NDV infection in the field, especially in resource-limited settings.","Fan, Jindai; Chen, Wenxian; Zhang, Yuanyuan; Liu, Zhixiang; Li, Xiaoming; Ding, Hongxing; Yi, Lin; Chen, Jinding; Zhao, Mingqiu","Journal of veterinary diagnostic investigation : official publication of the American Association of Veterinary Laboratory Diagnosticians, Inc",https://doi.org/10.1177/1040638721990122; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33685333/,114

Having had COVID-19 and reporting higher levels of distress as well as giving up caregiving were related to perceived worsening in care-recipients well-being. Perceived increases were mainly reported by younger caregivers, those who perceived to have not coped well, and those reporting an increase in conflicts. Some caregivers perceived an increase in positive emotions.Conclusions: The pandemic has a negative impact on caregivers' perceptions about the course of their own emotions and care-recipients' well-being.Clinical implications: Interventions are needed to train caregivers in strategies to cope with the sources of stress caused by the pandemic and to promote social support.","Losada, Andrés; Vara-García, Carlos; Romero-Moreno, Rosa; Barrera-Caballero, Samara; Pedroso-Chaparro, María Del Sequeros; Jiménez-Gonzalo, Lucía; Fernandes-Pires, José; Cabrera, Isabel; Gallego-Alberto, Laura; Huertas-Domingo, Cristina; Mérida-Herrera, Laura; Olazarán-Rodríguez, Javier; Márquez-González, María",Clinical gerontologist,https://doi.org/10.1080/07317115.2021.1928356; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34096470/,114

METHODS Study participants were selected using a case-control design using medical records collected between August 2014 and May 2018 at Hahnemann University Hospital in Philadelphia. Controls were frequency matched to cases by age and length of stay. Final sample included 170 cases and 324 controls. Neighborhood-level factors were measured using American Community Survey data. Multilevel models were used to examine infection by census tract, deprivation index, race/ethnicity, insurance type, referral location, antibiotic use, and proton-pump inhibitor use. RESULTS Patients on Medicare compared to private insurance had 2.04 times (95% CI, 1.31-3.20) the odds of infection after adjusting for all covariables. Prior antibiotic use (2.70; 95% CI, 1.64-4.46) was also associated with infection, but race or ethnicity and referral location were not. A smaller proportion of hospital cases occurred among white patients (25% vs 44%) and patients over the age of 65 (39% vs 56%) than expected based on national surveillance statistics. CONCLUSIONS Medicare and antibiotics were associated with Clostridioides difficile infection, but evidence did not indicate association with race or ethnicity. This finding diverges from national data in that infection is higher among white people compared to nonwhite people. Furthermore, a greater proportion of hospital cases were aged <65 years than expected based on national data. National surveillance statistics on CDI may not be transportable to safety-net hospitals, which often disproportionately serve low-income, nonwhite patients.","Vader, Daniel T; Weldie, Chelsea; Welles, Seth L; Kutzler, Michele A; Goldstein, Neal D",Infection control and hospital epidemiology,https://doi.org/10.1017/ice.2020.1324; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33280624/,114

Here, we report the use of lentiviral vectors for long-term in vivo delivery of RNAi selectively to resident alveolar macrophages (AMs), key immune effector cells in the lung. We demonstrate the therapeutic potential of this approach by RNAi-based downregulation of p65 (RelA), a component of the pro-inflammatory transcriptional regulator, nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) and a key participant in lung disease pathogenesis. In vivo RNAi delivery results in decreased induction of NF-κB and downstream neutrophilic chemokines in transduced AMs as well as attenuated lung neutrophilia following stimulation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Through concurrent delivery of a novel lentiviral reporter vector (lenti-NF-κB-luc-GFP) we track in vivo expression of NF-κB target genes in real time, a critical step towards extending RNAi-based therapy to longstanding lung diseases. Application of this system reveals that resident AMs persist in the airspaces of mice following the resolution of LPS-induced inflammation, thus allowing these localized cells to be used as effective vehicles for prolonged RNAi delivery in disease settings.","Wilson, Andrew A; Kwok, Letty W; Porter, Emily L; Payne, Julie G; McElroy, Gregory S; Ohle, Sarah J; Greenhill, Sara R; Blahna, Matthew T; Yamamoto, Kazuko; Jean, Jyh C; Mizgerd, Joseph P; Kotton, Darrell N",Molecular therapy : the journal of the American Society of Gene Therapy,https://doi.org/10.1038/mt.2013.19; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23403494/,114

The present study was designed to assess the presence and significance of PTX3 in Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)4-7. RNA-sequencing analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells, single-cell bioinformatics analysis and immunohistochemistry of lung autopsy samples revealed that myelomonocytic cells and endothelial cells express high levels of PTX3 in patients with COVID-19. Increased plasma concentrations of PTX3 were detected in 96 patients with COVID-19. PTX3 emerged as a strong independent predictor of 28-d mortality in multivariable analysis, better than conventional markers of inflammation, in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. The prognostic significance of PTX3 abundance for mortality was confirmed in a second independent cohort (54 patients). Thus, circulating and lung myelomonocytic cells and endothelial cells are a major source of PTX3, and PTX3 plasma concentration can serve as an independent strong prognostic indicator of short-term mortality in COVID-19.","Brunetta, Enrico; Folci, Marco; Bottazzi, Barbara; De Santis, Maria; Gritti, Giuseppe; Protti, Alessandro; Mapelli, Sarah N; Bonovas, Stefanos; Piovani, Daniele; Leone, Roberto; My, Ilaria; Zanon, Veronica; Spata, Gianmarco; Bacci, Monica; Supino, Domenico; Carnevale, Silvia; Sironi, Marina; Davoudian, Sadaf; Peano, Clelia; Landi, Francesco; Di Marco, Fabiano; Raimondi, Federico; Gianatti, Andrea; Angelini, Claudio; Rambaldi, Alessandro; Garlanda, Cecilia; Ciccarelli, Michele; Cecconi, Maurizio; Mantovani, Alberto",Nature immunology,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41590-020-00832-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33208929/,114

OBJECTIVES The study reported weight loss and nutritional outcomes of 80 patients with a follow-up of at least 10 years. SETTING The follow-up was conducted at a university hospital as well as in a private practice institution in France. METHODS Eighty patients operated on between February 2002 and May 2006 were reviewed. Weight outcomes were analyzed as well as complete biological status. Revisions were reported as well as the number of patients taking vitamin supplementation. RESULTS A follow-up of 141 ± 16 months was available for 87.7% of the patients at least 10 years from surgery. Preoperative BMI decreased from 48.9 ± 7.3 to 31.2 ± 6.2 kg/m2 with an EWL of 73.4 ± 26.7% and a TWL of 35.9% ± 17.7%. Despite weight regain ≥10% of the weight loss in 61% of the cases, 78% of the patients maintained a BMI <35. Fourteen percent of the patients had a revision. Normal vitamin D levels were found in 35.4%. The overall PTH level was 91.9 ± 79.5 ng/mL, and 62% of the patients had hyperparathyroidism. Other deficiencies were less frequent but fat-soluble deficiencies as well as a PTH >100 ng/mL were significantly associated with the absence of vitamin supplementation. CONCLUSION BPD/DS maintains a significant weight loss, but remains associated with side effects leading to revision and multiple vitamin deficiencies. The most severe deficiencies are related to the lack of supplementation compliance.","Topart, Philippe; Becouarn, Guillaume; Delarue, Jacques",Obesity surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11695-016-2537-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28050789/,114
153623,"Response to Cottu, Bozec, Basse, and Paoletti.",2021-01-06,"RATIONALE A challenge in treating substance use disorder is that successful treatment often does not persist, resulting in relapse and continued drug seeking. One approach to persistently weaken drug-seeking behaviors is to pair exposure to drug-associated cues or behaviors with delivery of a compound that may strengthen the inhibition of the association between drug cues and behavior. OBJECTIVES We evaluated whether a selective histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) inhibitor could promote extinction and weaken contextual control of operant drug seeking after intravenous cocaine self-administration. METHODS Male Long-Evans rats received a systemic injection of the HDAC3 inhibitor RGFP966 either before or immediately after the first extinction session. Persistence of extinction was tested over subsequent extinction sessions, as well as tests of reinstatement that included cue-induced reinstatement, contextual renewal, and cocaine-primed reinstatement. Additional extinction sessions occurred between each reinstatement test. We also evaluated effects of RGFP966 on performance and motivation during stable fixed ratio operant responding for cocaine and during a progressive ratio of reinforcement. RESULTS RGFP966 administered before the first extinction session led to significantly less responding during subsequent extinction and reinstatement tests compared to vehicle-injected rats. Follow-up studies found that these effects were not likely due to a performance deficit or a change in motivation to self-administer cocaine, as injections of RGFP966 had no effect on stable responding during a fixed or progressive ratio schedule. In addition, RGFP966 administered just after the first extinction session had no effect during early extinction and reinstatement tests, but weakened long-term responding during later extinction sessions. CONCLUSIONS These results suggest that a systemic injection of a selective HDAC3 inhibitor can enhance extinction and suppress reinstatement after cocaine self-administration. The finding that behavioral and pharmacological manipulations can be combined to decrease drug seeking provides further potential for treatment by epigenetic modulation.","Hitchcock, Leah N; Raybuck, Jonathan D; Wood, Marcelo A; Lattal, K Matthew",Psychopharmacology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00213-018-5122-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30488346/,114

154875,Strengthening Vaccine Confidence and Acceptance in the Pediatric Provider Office.,2020-12-01,"TLR ligands are promising candidates for the development of novel vaccine adjuvants that can elicit protective immunity against emerging infectious diseases. Adjuvants have been used most frequently to increase the quantity of an immune response. However, the quality of a T cell response can be more important than its quantity. Stimulating certain pairs of TLRs induces a synergistic response in terms of activating dendritic cells and eliciting/enhancing T cell responses through clonal expansion, which increases the number of responding T cells. Here, we have found that utilizing ligands for 3 TLRs (TLR2/6, TLR3, and TLR9) greatly increased the protective efficacy of vaccination with an HIV envelope peptide in mice when compared with using ligands for only any 2 of these TLRs; surprisingly, increased protection was induced without a marked increase in the number of peptide-specific T cells. Rather, the combination of these 3 TLR ligands augmented the quality of the T cell responses primarily by amplifying their functional avidity for the antigen, which was necessary for clearance of virus. The triple combination increased production of DC IL-15 along with its receptor, IL-15Ralpha, which contributed to high avidity, and decreased expression of programmed death-ligand 1 and induction of Tregs. Therefore, selective TLR ligand combinations can increase protective efficacy by increasing the quality rather than the quantity of T cell responses.","Zhu, Qing; Egelston, Colt; Gagnon, Susan; Sui, Yongjun; Belyakov, Igor M; Klinman, Dennis M; Berzofsky, Jay A",The Journal of clinical investigation,https://doi.org/10.1172/jci39293; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20101095/,114

Therapeutic strategies to target mutant-p53 cancers are urgently needed. We show that accumulated mutant-p53 protein suppresses the expression of SLC7A11, a component of the cystine/glutamate antiporter, system xC-, through binding to the master antioxidant transcription factor NRF2. This diminishes glutathione synthesis, rendering mutant-p53 tumours susceptible to oxidative damage. System xC- inhibitors specifically exploit this vulnerability to preferentially kill cancer cells with stabilized mutant-p53 protein. Moreover, we demonstrate that SLC7A11 expression is a novel and robust predictive biomarker for APR-246, a first-in-class mutant-p53 reactivator that also binds and depletes glutathione in tumours, triggering lipid peroxidative cell death. Importantly, system xC- antagonism strongly synergizes with APR-246 to induce apoptosis in mutant-p53 tumours. We propose a new paradigm for targeting cancers that accumulate mutant-p53 protein by inhibiting the SLC7A11-glutathione axis.","Liu, David S; Duong, Cuong P; Haupt, Sue; Montgomery, Karen G; House, Colin M; Azar, Walid J; Pearson, Helen B; Fisher, Oliver M; Read, Matthew; Guerra, Glen R; Haupt, Ygal; Cullinane, Carleen; Wiman, Klas G; Abrahmsen, Lars; Phillips, Wayne A; Clemons, Nicholas J",Nature communications,https://doi.org/10.1038/ncomms14844; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28348409/,114

She had also reported haematemesis, epistaxis and melaena. Vital signs included temperature 36.9°C, blood pressure 90/50 mm Hg, heart rate 130 beats per minute and respiratory rate 32 breaths per minute. Physical examination was notable for an acutely ill appearing woman with scleral icterus, hepatosplenomegaly and palpable cervical and axillary lymphadenopathy. Complete blood count showed pancytopaenia with haemoglobin 59 g/L (normal 120-160 g/L), white blood cell count 2.7×109/L (normal 4-10.5×109/L) and platelet count 50×109/L (normal 150-450×109/L). The white blood cell count differential included 58% neutrophils (normal 38%-77%) with immature neutrophils in band form elevated at 45% (normal <14%), 16% lymphocytes (normal 20%-48%), 7% monocytes (normal <12%) and no eosinophils (normal <6%). Blood smear revealed anisocytosis, poikilocytosis and hypochromia. Coagulation panel showed elevated levels of d-dimer level at 1.39 µg/mL (normal <0.45 µg/mL), prolonged prothrombin time at 34.4 s (normal 11-15 s), prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time of 55.6 s (normal 25-34 s), prolonged international normalised ratio at 3.31 (normal <1.1) and low fibrinogen 60 mg/dL (normal >200 mg/dL). Lipid panel showed cholesterol at 114 mg/dL (normal 125-200 mg/dL), triglycerides 207 mg/dL (normal 30-150 mg/dL), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol 10 mg/dL (normal 40-60 mg/dL) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol 63 mg/dL (normal <100 mg/dL). Other lab abnormalities included elevated ferritin of 6513 ng/mL (normal 10-150 ng/mL) and elevated lactate dehydrogenase of 1071 unit/L (normal 95-240 unit/L). Soluble interleukin-2 receptor alpha level was elevated at 60 727 units/mL (normal 223-710 units/mL). Fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) scan showed abnormal tracer localisation within the paratracheal, hilar, pelvic, abdominal and subcarinal lymph nodes, along with FDG-PET positive hepatosplenomegaly. A bone marrow biopsy showed hypercellular marrow (95% cellularity) with trilineage haematopoiesis, haemophagocytic cells, polytypic plasmacytosis and T-cell lymphocytosis, along with positive latent membrane protein-1 immunohistochemical staining for EBV. EBV quantitative DNA PCR showed >1 million copies. These findings were consistent with a diagnosis of HLH secondary to EBV infection.

156820,Error in Byline.,2020-06-01,"OBJECTIVE To explore the relationship between wearing protective masks combined with goggles and skin injuries in medical staff during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. DESIGN AND SETTING A cross-sectional, multicenter online survey investigating skin injuries in medical staff during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS Respondents voluntarily completed the questionnaire on their smartphones. Ordinal and multinomial logistic regression were employed to identify factors related to skin injuries. RESULTS In total, 1,611 respondents wore protective masks combined with goggles in 145 hospitals in China; 1,281 cases of skin injuries were found, and the overall prevalence was 79.5%. Multiple concomitant skin injuries (68.5%) and injuries in four locations (24.0%) were the most common, followed by injuries in three locations (22.8%), two locations (21.7%) and one location (11.0%). Multinomial logistic regression indicated that sweating increased the risk of injuries in 1-4 locations (95% confidence interval [CI] for odds ratio [OR] 16.23-60.02 for one location and 38.22-239.04 for four locations), and wearing an N95 mask combined with goggles and a daily use > 4 hours increased the risk of injuries in four locations (95% CI for OR 1.18-5.31 and 1.14-3.93, respectively). CONCLUSIONS The prevalence of skin injuries among medical staff wearing protective masks combined with goggles was very high. These were mainly device-related pressure injuries, moisture-associated skin damage and skin tears. The combination of multiple factors resulted in skin injuries at multiple sites. Preventing and managing sweating should be a focus for medical staff who wear protective masks combined with goggles for more than 4 hours.","Jiang, Qixia; Liu, Yuxiu; Song, Siping; Wei, Wei; Bai, Yuxuan",Advances in skin & wound care,https://doi.org/10.1097/01.asw.0000744352.80758.96; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33871407/,114

We report the emergency use of immunomodulatory therapy utilizing an extracorporeal selective cytopheretic device (SCD) in two patients with elevated serum interleukin (IL)-6 levels and refractory COVID-19 ARDS requiring extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). The two patients were selected based on clinical criteria and elevated levels of IL-6 (>100 pg/ml) as a biomarker of inflammation. Once identified, emergency/expanded use permission for SCD treatment was obtained and patient consented. Six COVID-19 patients (four on ECMO) with severe ARDS were also screened with IL-6 levels less than 100 pg/ml and were not treated with SCD. The two enrolled patients' PaO2/FiO2 ratios increased from 55 and 58 to 200 and 192 at 52 and 50 hours, respectively. Inflammatory indices also declined with IL-6 falling from 231 and 598 pg/ml to 3.32 and 116 pg/ml, respectively. IL-6/IL-10 ratios also decreased from 11.8 and 18 to 0.7 and 0.62, respectively. The two patients were successfully weaned off ECMO after 17 and 16 days of SCD therapy, respectively. The results observed with SCD therapy on these two critically ill COVID-19 patients with severe ARDS and elevated IL-6 is encouraging. A multicenter clinical trial is underway with an FDA-approved investigational device exemption to evaluate the potential of SCD therapy to effectively treat COVID-19 intensive care unit patients.","Yessayan, Lenar; Szamosfalvi, Balazs; Napolitano, Lena; Singer, Benjamin; Kurabayashi, Katsuo; Song, Yujing; Westover, Angela; Humes, H David",ASAIO journal,https://doi.org/10.1097/mat.0000000000001239; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33136592/,114

157651,Diagnostic and therapeutic treatment modalities for acute lower gastrointestinal bleeding: a systematic review.,2017,"BACKGROUND The onset of cerebral ischemia is difficult to predict in patients with altered consciousness using the methods available. We hypothesise that changes in Heart Rate Variability (HRV), Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS) and Electroencephalography (EEG) correlated to clinical data and processed by artificial intelligence (AI) can indicate the development of imminent cerebral ischemia and reperfusion respectively. This study aims to develop a method that enables detection of imminent cerebral ischemia in unconscious patients, noninvasively and with the support of AI. METHODS This prospective observational study will include patients undergoing elective surgery for carotid endarterectomy and patients undergoing acute endovascular embolectomy for cerebral arterial embolism. HRV, NIRS, and EEG measurements and clinical information on patient status will be collected and processed using machine learning. The study will take place at Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Gothenburg, Sweden. Inclusion will start in September 2020, and patients will be included until a robust model can be constructed. By analysing changes in HRV, EEG, and NIRS measurements in conjunction with cerebral ischemia or cerebral reperfusion, it should be possible to train artificial neural networks to detect patterns of impending cerebral ischemia. The analysis will be performed using machine learning with long-short term memory artificial neural networks combined with convolutional layers to identify patterns consistent with cerebral ischemia and reperfusion. DISCUSSION Early signs of cerebral ischemia could be detected more rapidly by identifying patterns in integrated, continuously collected physiological data processed by AI. Clinicians could then be alerted, and appropriate actions could be taken to improve patient outcomes.","Block, Linda; Merhi, Ali El; Liljencrantz, Jaquette; Naredi, Silvana; Staron, Miroslaw; Hergès, Helena Odenstedt",Acta anaesthesiologica Scandinavica,https://doi.org/10.1111/aas.13657; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32533722/,114

However, the burden of the pandemic has not been distributed equally. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether racial and economic residential segregation were associated with COVID-19 related factors in the nation's capital, Washington D.C., during the first year of the pandemic. METHODS Racial, economic, and racialized economic segregation were assessed using the Index of Concentration at the Extremes measure and data from the 2014-2018 American Community Survey. COVID-19 related factors (i.e. incidence, testing rate, and percent positivity) were assessed using data from the Washington D.C. government. Spearman rank correlation was used to assess the relationship between each segregation measure and each COVID-19 related factor. RESULTS Washington D.C. neighborhoods with a higher concentration of African Americans, lower income residents, and African Americans with low income had a higher incidence of COVID-19 and greater percent positivity, but lower testing rates compared to their counterparts. CONCLUSIONS There is a geographic mismatch between neighborhoods most vulnerable to COVID-19 and the neighborhoods where the testing resources are being used. More resources should be allocated to the most vulnerable neighborhoods to address the COVID-19 pandemic in an equitable manner.","Brown, Kristen M; Lewis, Jessica Y; Davis, Sharon K",Annals of epidemiology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.annepidem.2021.04.003; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33895243/,114
158106,Neuromodulatory treatments for psychiatric disease: A comprehensive survey of the clinical trial landscape.,2021-08-27,"BACKGROUND Recently, single-incision laparoscopic surgery has begun to develop as an extension of standard laparoscopic minimally invasive procedures. However, there have been a limited number of reports of single-incision procedures in colorectal disease. PURPOSE The aim of this study is to describe our initial experience with single-incision laparoscopic right colectomy and to make comparisons with the current standard of care, multiport laparoscopic right colectomy. METHODS Data from consecutive patients undergoing single-incision laparoscopic right colectomy were analyzed and compared with case-matched multiport laparoscopic right colectomies. Indications for surgery, type of port used, operative time, number of nodes harvested, length of hospital stay, and complications were the outcomes measured. RESULTS During the study period, 17 patients underwent single-incision laparoscopic colectomy. Of the planned single-incision laparoscopic cases, 15 (88%) were completed with a single incision, whereas 2 required an additional port placement. There were no conversions to open surgery during any of the cases. Indications for surgery were similar between the 2 groups. Operative time was not significantly different in single-incision laparoscopic right colectomy compared with multiport laparoscopic right colectomy (139 min vs 134 min, respectively; P = .61). Length of stay and number of nodes harvested also had no significant differences between the 2 groups. There was one death after discharge to home secondary to pulmonary embolism and one delayed thermal injury in the single-incision laparoscopic group. CONCLUSION Single-incision laparoscopic right colectomy is feasible, and appears to have results similar to standard multiport right colectomy in our initial comparisons. Ongoing development in instrumentation may help to further shorten operative time and minimize complications, and may make this an equivalent or preferred method for minimally invasive colorectal surgery. Large, prospective, randomized, controlled trials should be conducted to further compare the safety and efficacy of this approach.","Adair, James; Gromski, Mark A; Lim, Robert B; Nagle, Deborah",Diseases of the colon and rectum,https://doi.org/10.1007/dcr.0b013e3181e85875; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20940605/,114

158551,HRT and breast cancer risk - Fast facts.,2021-01-26,"Molecularly, breast cancer represents a highly heterogenous family of neoplastic disorders, with substantial interpatient variations regarding genetic mutations, cell composition, transcriptional profiles, and treatment response. Consequently, there is an increasing demand for alternative diagnostic approaches aimed at the molecular annotation of the disease on a patient-by-patient basis and the design of more personalized treatments. The clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated (Cas) technology enables the development of such novel approaches. For instance, in diagnostics, the use of the RNA-specific C2c2 system allows ultrasensitive nucleic acid detection and could be used to characterize the mutational repertoire and transcriptional breast cancer signatures. In disease modeling, CRISPR/Cas9 technology can be applied to selectively engineer oncogenes and tumor-suppressor genes involved in disease pathogenesis. In treatment, CRISPR/Cas9 can be used to develop gene-therapy, while its catalytically-dead variant (dCas9) can be applied to reprogram the epigenetic landscape of malignant cells. As immunotherapy becomes increasingly prominent in cancer treatment, CRISPR/Cas9 can engineer the immune cells to redirect them against cancer cells and potentiate antitumor immune responses. In this review, CRISPR strategies for the advancement of breast cancer diagnostics, modeling, and treatment are highlighted, culminating in a perspective on developing a precision medicine-based approach against breast cancer.","Mintz, Rachel L; Gao, Madeleine A; Lo, Kahmun; Lao, Yeh-Hsing; Li, Mingqiang; Leong, Kam W",Advanced biosystems,https://doi.org/10.1002/adbi.201800132; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32832592/,114

All CNS resident cell types are equipped with pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) to respond to viruses. The resulting activation of IFN-alpha/beta, pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines is dependent on the virus replication strategy, tropism and PRR distribution. Although IFN-alpha/beta induced antiviral mediators are essential to restrict initial viral spread, adaptive immunity promoted by chemokines, cytokines and metalloproteinases is equally crucial in lowering viral burden. Recognition of viral antigen presented by MHC molecules is crucial for T cell retention and function. Non-lytic clearance mechanisms mediated by IFN-gamma and antibodies prevail in providing protection. Targeted intervention can be achieved by PRR stimulation, chemokine-receptor blockade and immune modulation of T cell function. However, owing to the extensive positive and negative feedback signaling cascades linking innate and adaptive immune responses, enhanced anti-viral functions will have to be counterbalanced to avoid pathology.","Savarin, Carine; Bergmann, Cornelia C",Current opinion in pharmacology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.coph.2008.05.002; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18562249/,114

We designed a participatory disease surveillance (PDS) system, to capture symptoms of Influenza-like illness (ILI) to estimate SARS-CoV-2 infection in the community. While data generated by these platforms can help public health organisations find community hotspots and effectively direct control measures, it has never been compared to traditional systems. OBJECTIVE Methods and Objectives: A completely anonymised web based PDS system, www.trackcovid-19.org was developed. We evaluated the symptomatic responses received form the PDS system to the traditional risk based surveillance carried out by the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike over a period of 45 days in the South Indian city of Bengaluru. METHODS Methods and Objectives: A completely anonymised web based PDS system, www.trackcovid-19.org was developed. We evaluated the symptomatic responses received form the PDS system to the traditional risk based surveillance carried out by the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike over a period of 45 days in the South Indian city of Bengaluru. RESULTS Results: The PDS system recorded 11062 entries from 106 Postal codes. A healthy response was obtained from 10863 users while 199 (1.8%) reported symptomatic. Subgroup analysis of a 14 day symptomatic window recorded 33 (0.29%) responses. Risk based surveillance was carried out covering a population of 605,284 with 209 (0.03%) individuals identified symptomatic. CONCLUSIONS Conclusion: Web PDS platforms provide better visualisation of community infection when compared to traditional risk based surveillance systems. They are extremely useful by providing real time information in the extended battle against this pandemic. When integrated into national disease surveillance systems, they can provide long term community surveillance adding an important cost-effective layer to already available data sources.","Masthi, Ramesh; Jahan, Afraz; Bharathi, Divya; Abhilash, Pradam; Kaniyarakkal, Vinayak; Tv, Sanjay; Gowda, Giriyanna; Ts, Ranganath; Goud, Ramakrishna; Rao, Shubha; Hegde, Ajay",JMIR public health and surveillance,https://doi.org/10.2196/20746; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33481758/,114

The aim of this work is to provide evidence that similar inflammatory mechanisms exist in synovial membrane (n = 24) obtained from three pathologies presenting altogether an inflammatory gradient: OA, chronic pyrophosphate arthropathy (CPPA) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Synovial biopsies were first characterized by a histological score based on synovial hyperplasia and infiltration of lymphocytes, plasma cells, polymorphonuclear and macrophages. All biopsies were also analyzed by 2D-nano-UPLC-ESI-Q-Orbitrap for protein identification and quantification. Protein levels were correlated with the histological score. Histological score was in the range of 3 to 8 for OA, 5 to 13 for CPPA and 12 to 17 for RA. Of the 4,336 proteins identified by mass spectrometry, 51 proteins were selected for their strong correlation (p < 0.001) with the histological score of which 11 proteins (DNAJB11, CALR, ERP29, GANAB, HSP90B1, HSPA1A, HSPA5, HYOU1, LMAN1, PDIA4, and TXNDC5) were involved in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Protein levels of S100A8 and S100A9 were significantly higher in RA compared to OA (for both) or to CPPA (for S100A8 only) and also significantly correlated with the histological score. Eighteen complement component proteins were identified, but only C1QB and C1QBP were weakly correlated with the histological score. This study highlights the inflammatory gradient existing between OA, CPPA and RA synovitis either at the protein level or at the histological level.

Diet-related outcomes included purchasing, dietary intakes, diet quality, and health including weight. We coded studies for enabling public policy levers underpinning the intervention, using two widely used conceptual frameworks. RECENT FINDINGS Of 86 articles (1974-2018), the majority (58 articles, 67%) showed at least one positive effect on diet. Thirteen articles (15%) discussed natural experiments, 27 articles (31%) used a design involving comparison groups including 23 articles (27%) specifically describing randomized controlled trials, and 46 (53%) were quasi-experimental (cross-sectional) evaluations. Across the ""4Ps"" of marketing (product, promotion, placement, and price), promotion comprised the greatest proportion of intervention strategies, especially in earlier literature (pre-2008). Few studies combined geographic access interventions with 4P strategies, and few used robust dietary intake assessments. Behavior change communication remains an intervention mainstay, but recent work has also incorporated environmental and social planning, and fiscal strategies. More recent interventions were multi-component. The retail food environment intervention literature continues to grow and has become more robust overall, with clearer evidence of the effect of interventions on diet-related outcomes, including consumer purchasing, dietary intakes, and health. There is still much scope for development in the field. Attention to enabling public policy could help to strengthen intervention implementation and evaluation in the retail food environment.","Mah, Catherine L; Luongo, Gabriella; Hasdell, Rebecca; Taylor, Nathan G A; Lo, Brian K",Current nutrition reports,https://doi.org/10.1007/s13668-019-00295-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31797233/,114
160688,Differences in longitudinal associations of cardiovascular risk factors with arterial stiffness and pressure wave reflection in middle-aged Japanese men.,2020-07-28,"Men are reluctant to seek help for depression. This is an important public health concern, and it has been largely attributed to the stigma attached to men who seek help. The present studies aim to understand the nature of such stigma. Specifically, are men who seek help for mental distress perceived to be less masculine and/or more feminine? Our findings suggest that symptomology, the diagnostic label, and targets' reaction to the symptoms jointly shape the gendered perceptions of help-seeking. In four experiments (N = 1118), participants read descriptions of targets with varying psychological or physical symptoms and provided masculinity and femininity ratings of the targets. People seeking help for internalizing symptoms (e.g., depressed moods) are perceived to be less masculine and more feminine than those seeking help for physical symptoms, yet the reverse pattern was found for people seeking help for externalizing symptoms (e.g., angry outbursts). In addition, the knowledge of a depression diagnosis decreased masculinity ratings and increased femininity ratings of male targets with physical symptoms (but not those with psychological symptoms), suggesting the power of labeling in shaping perceptions. Importantly, seeking help affects how men are perceived above and beyond symptomology: Men who downplay physical symptoms are perceived to be more masculine; whereas those who seek help for psychological symptoms are perceived to be more feminine. The association between help-seeking and masculinity ideologies shapes person perception, particularly because help-seeking violates norms of masculinity.

Plant-based diet interventions that emphasize whole plant foods with minimal processing and less refined grains and sugar have shown have shown great promise in control of obesity, but there is a paucity of data translating this treatment effect to disparate populations. The objective of our study was to evaluate the efficacy of the Healthy Eating Lifestyle Program (HELP) for accomplishing weight management in a hospital-based, family centered, culturally tailored, plant-based diet intervention for Hispanic/Latino children who were overweight or obese. Methods: Our mixed methods evaluation included: (1) A one arm study to measure changes in body mass index (BMI) from pre- to post-intervention, and (2) A stakeholder analysis of the program staff. Results: For children ages 5-12 years who were overweight/obese, we found no evidence of excess weight gain evidenced by BMI Z scores (Zpost-pre = -0.02, p = 0.11). Among the parent/guardians who were overweight or obese, we found a decrease in BMI that was stronger in men (BMI post-pre = -0.75 kg/m2, p = 0.01) than in women (BMI post-pre = -0.12 kg/m2, p = 0.30). A program strength was the cultural tailoring of the plant-based diet choices. Conclusions: The evaluation raises the possibility that incorporating intervention components of HELP (plant-based food choices, family-based, cultural tailoring) into pediatric weight management can improve the standard of care.","Singh, Pramil N; Steinbach, Jessica; Nelson, Anna; Shih, Wendy; D'Avila, Mary; Castilla, Selene; Jordan, Michael; McCarthy, William J; Hayes-Bautista, David; Flores, Hector",International journal of environmental research and public health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17134849; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32640565/,114

Cancers are generally additional risk factors for COVID-19, and this has implications also for skin cancer patients. Those patients require special attention, due to situations such as an increased risk of infection as a result of visiting the hospital for treatment. It is imperative that the diagnosis and treatment of patients who have a cancer that progresses rapidly, such as malignant melanoma, high-risk squamous cell carcinoma and a high risk of metastasis, are delayed. Due to the relatively long-lasting nature of basal cell carcinoma and, as almost no metastasis would be expected, its treatment may be postponed, except for those that occur in areas such as the eyes and mouth. Diagnosis and treatment of skin cancers is a process that requires many procedures. Throughout this process, physicians should take appropriate precautions that are sufficient to protect both the patient and themselves in the best way without leading to any delay in the procedures.","Aslan Kayıran, M; Karadag, A S; Wollina, U",Journal of biological regulators and homeostatic agents,https://doi.org/10.23812/20-344-e; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33111514/,114

The rise of digital technologies may influence the delivery of compassionate care, and thus this relationship between compassion and digital health care needs to be better understood. OBJECTIVE This scoping review aimed to identify existing digital technologies being used by patients and health professionals in the delivery of mental health care, understand how digital technologies are being used in the delivery of compassionate mental health care, and determine the facilitators of and barriers to digital technology use among patients and health professionals in the delivery of compassionate mental health care. METHODS We conducted this scoping review through a search of Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online (MEDLINE), MEDLINE In-Process and EPub Ahead of Print, PsycINFO, and Web of Science for articles published from 1990 to 2019. RESULTS Of the 4472 articles screened, 37 articles were included for data extraction. Telemedicine was the most widely used technology by mental health professionals. Digital technologies were described as facilitating compassionate care and were classified using a conceptual model to identify each digital intersection with compassionate care. Facilitators of and barriers to providing compassionate care through digital technology were identified, including increased safety for providers, health care professional perceptions and abilities, and the use of picture-in-picture feedback to evaluate social cues. CONCLUSIONS Implementing digital technology into mental health care can improve the current delivery of compassionate care and create novel ways to provide compassion. However, as this is a new area of study, mental health professionals and organizations alike should be mindful that compassionate human-centered care is maintained in the delivery of digital health care. Future research could develop tools to facilitate and evaluate the enactment of compassion within digital health care.","Kemp, Jessica; Zhang, Timothy; Inglis, Fiona; Wiljer, David; Sockalingam, Sanjeev; Crawford, Allison; Lo, Brian; Charow, Rebecca; Munnery, Mikayla; Singh Takhar, Shuranjeet; Strudwick, Gillian",Journal of medical Internet research,https://doi.org/10.2196/16263; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32141833/,114

However, the effectiveness of oxygen therapy as a treatment for pneumonia is not well known. OBJECTIVES To determine the effectiveness and safety of oxygen therapy in the treatment of pneumonia in adults older than 18 years. SEARCH METHODS We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) 2011, Issue 4, part of The Cochrane Library, www.thecochranelibrary.com (accessed 9 December 2011), which includes the Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infections Group's Specialised Register, MEDLINE (1948 to November week 3, 2011) and EMBASE (1974 to December 2011). SELECTION CRITERIA Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of oxygen therapy for adults with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and nosocomial (hospital-acquired) pneumonia (HAP or NP) in intensive care units (ICU). DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Two review authors independently reviewed abstracts and assessed data for methodological quality. MAIN RESULTS Three RCTs met our inclusion criteria. The studies enrolled 151 participants with CAP or immunosuppressed patients with pulmonary infiltrates. Overall, we found that non-invasive ventilation can reduce the risk of death in the ICU, odd ratio (OR) 0.28, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.09 to 0.88; endotracheal intubation, OR 0.26, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.61; complications, OR 0.23, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.70; and shorten ICU length of stay, mean duration (MD) -3.28, 95% CI -5.41 to -1.61.Non-invasive ventilation and standard oxygen supplementation via a Venturi mask were similar when measuring mortality in hospital, OR 0.54, 95% CI 0.11 to 2.68; two-month survival, OR 1.67, 95% CI 0.53 to 5.28; duration of hospital stay, MD -1.00, 95% CI -2.05 to 0.05; and duration of mechanical ventilation, standard MD -0.26, 95% CI -0.66 to 0.14. Some outcomes and complications of non-invasive ventilation were varied according to different participant populations. We also found that some subgroups had a high level of heterogeneity when conducting pooled analyses. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS Non-invasive ventilation can reduce the risk of death in the ICU, endotracheal intubation, shorten ICU stay and length of intubation. Some outcomes and complications of non-invasive ventilation were varied according to different participant populations. Other than the oxygen therapy, we must mention the importance of standard treatment by physicians. The evidence is weak and we did not include participants with pulmonary tuberculosis and cystic fibrosis. More RCTs are required to answer these clinical questions. However, the review indicates that non-invasive ventilation may be more beneficial than standard oxygen supplementation via a Venturi mask for pneumonia.","Zhang, Yanling; Fang, Chenli; Dong, Bi Rong; Wu, Taixiang; Deng, Jue Lin",The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.cd006607.pub4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22419316/,114

In addition, vaccine responses in mice are often poorly predictive of responses to those same vaccines in humans. Here we use human tonsils, readily available lymphoid organs, to develop a functional organotypic system that recapitulates key germinal center features in vitro, including the production of antigen-specific antibodies, somatic hypermutation and affinity maturation, plasmablast differentiation and class-switch recombination. We use this system to define the essential cellular components necessary to produce an influenza vaccine response. We also show that it can be used to evaluate humoral immune responses to two priming antigens, rabies vaccine and an adenovirus-based severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 vaccine, and to assess the effects of different adjuvants. This system should prove useful for studying critical mechanisms underlying adaptive immunity in much greater depth than previously possible and to rapidly test vaccine candidates and adjuvants in an entirely human system.","Wagar, Lisa E; Salahudeen, Ameen; Constantz, Christian M; Wendel, Ben S; Lyons, Michael M; Mallajosyula, Vamsee; Jatt, Lauren P; Adamska, Julia Z; Blum, Lisa K; Gupta, Neha; Jackson, Katherine J L; Yang, Fan; Röltgen, Katharina; Roskin, Krishna M; Blaine, Kelly M; Meister, Kara D; Ahmad, Iram N; Cortese, Mario; Dora, Emery G; Tucker, Sean N; Sperling, Anne I; Jain, Aarti; Davies, D Huw; Felgner, Philip L; Hammer, Gregory B; Kim, Peter S; Robinson, William H; Boyd, Scott D; Kuo, Calvin J; Davis, Mark M",Nature medicine,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41591-020-01145-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33432170/,114

Risk factors for severe course of COVID-19 and increased mortality in these patients are unclear. Objectives: To evaluate the course of COVID-19 in our AAV cohort and identifying risk factors for mortality. Methods: Patients with AAV who were classified according to CHCC and whose scheduled last visit were after December 2019 were screened and evaluated for COVID-19 either by phone call or in the clinic. Records of patients with a history of hospital admission due to COVID-19 were evaluated. Cumulative clinical findings and treatment history were noted. Hypogammaglobulinemia (hIgG) was defined as IgG level below 700 mg/dl. All inpatients with a diagnosis of COVID-19 were screened for hIgG and IVIG was administered if necessary. Results: Eighty-nine patients (47.2% female, mean age 56 + 12.5 (28-81)) were included into the study. The diagnosis was GPA in 56 (62.9%) and MPA in 33 (37.1%) patients. Mean follow up time was 91 + 53.4 (26-272) months. Anti-PR3 and anti-MPO were positive in 46 (51.7%) and 32 (35.9%) patients, respectively. Lower respiratory tract (LRT) involvement was present in 72 (80.9%) and 10 patients had a history of diffuse alveolar haemorrhage (DAH). Sixty-one patients (68.2%) had a history of rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis (RPGN) and 21 (23.6%) had peripheral nervous system (PNS) involvement. Fifteen (16.9%) patients had COVID-19;14 of them were PCR positive, one patient had symptoms and thorax CT findings compatible with COVID-19. Pulmonary infiltrates were observed in 13 patients (86.7%);9 (60%) had severe pneumonia. Twelve patients (85.7%) were hospitalized, 6 patients (42.9%) needed ICU admission and 5 patients (35.7%) died. Tocilizumab and anakinra for hyperinflammation during COVID-19 were used in 1 (6.7%) and 4 (26.7%) patients, respectively. Four out of five deceased patients (3 on RTX treatment, 1 with renal transplant) were in remission at the time of COVID-19. COVID-19 was detected in a patient with disease flare and DAH, during treatment with high dose steroids and plasmapheresis. hIgG was detected in all deceased patients from COVID-19 during hospital admission (mean IgG: 495±113.2 mg/dL). Symptomatic COVID-19 was more frequent in patients with a history of DAH, RPGN and hIgG. hIgG during the follow-up was significantly associated with COVID-19 in multivariable analysis (p=0.01, OR=20,6 %95 CI (2-210). Comparison of patients who died of COVID-19 and survived showed that female sex, PNS involvement and hIgG during the clinical course and hospital admission were risk factors for increased mortality (Table 1). Age, smoking, treatments, history of flares or serious infections, remission status and chronic renal insufficiency did not differ between groups. Conclusion: The frequency and mortality from COVID-19 is found to be high in our AAV cohort compared to previous reports (1). Patients with serious lung or renal involvement are prone to symptomatic COVID-19. Previously reported severe outcomes on RTX therapy might be related to consequent hIgG. High dose IVIG treatment may not be sufficient in improving survival in AAV patients with severe COVID-19 and hIgG.","Ince, B.; Bektas, M.; Koca, N.; Agargun, B. F.; Zarali, S.; Guzey, D.

Antiglycolytic therapies are under investigation for treatment of obesity, cancer, aging, autoimmunity, and microbial diseases. Interrupting glycolysis is highly valued as a therapeutic strategy, because glycolytic disruption is generally tolerated in mammals. Unfortunately, anemia is a known dose-limiting side effect of these inhibitors and presents a major caveat to development of antiglycolytic therapies. We developed specific inhibitors of enolase – a critical enzyme in glycolysis – and validated their metabolic and cellular effects on human erythrocytes. Enolase inhibition increases erythrocyte susceptibility to oxidative damage and induces rapid and premature erythrocyte senescence, rather than direct hemolysis. We apply our model of red cell toxicity to address questions regarding erythrocyte glycolytic disruption in the context of Plasmodium falciparum malaria pathogenesis. Our study provides a framework for understanding red blood cell homeostasis under normal and disease states and clarifies the importance of erythrocyte reductive capacity in malaria parasite growth.","Jezewski, Andrew J.; Lin, Yu-Hsi; Reisz, Julie A.; Culp-Hill, Rachel; Barekatain, Yasaman; Yan, Victoria C.; D’Alessandro, Angelo; Muller, Florian L.; Odom John, Audrey R.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.10.09.331728,114

167046,Factors associated with cancer screening adherence amongst Latinos in Indiana: Results of an electronic survey,2021,"Background. The increasing number of cases and hospital admissions due to COVID-19 created an urgent need for rapid, reliable testing procedures for SARS-CoV-2 in Emergency Departments (ED) in order to effectively manage hospital resources, allocate beds and prevent nosocomial spread of infection. The ID NOW(TM) COVID-19 assay is a simple, user-friendly, rapid molecular test run on an instrument with a small footprint enabling point-of-care diagnostics. Methods. In the first wave, outsourced RT-PCR testing regularly required 36-48 hours before results were available. This prospective study was conducted in the second wave (October 2020-April 2021) and evaluated the impact the implementation of the ID NOW(TM) COVID-19 test in the ED had on clinical care processes and patient pathways. 710 patients were recruited upon arrival at the ED which included those presenting clinical symptoms, asymptomatic individuals or persons fulfilling epidemiological criteria. The first anterior nasal swab was taken by trained nurses in the ambulance or a separate consultation room. The ID NOW(TM) COVID-19 test was performed in the ED in strict compliance with the manufacturer's instructions and positive or suspected cases were additionally tested with RT_PCR (cobas SARS-COV-2 RT-PCR, Roche) following collection of a second nasopharyngeal NP specimen. Results. Swabs directly tested with the ID NOW(TM) COVID-19 test showed a diagnostic concordance of 98 % (sensitivity 99.59 %, specificity 94.55 %, PPV 97.6 %, NPV 99.05 %) compared to RT-PCR as reference. The 488 patients that tested positive with the ID NOW(TM) COVID-19 had a Ct range in RT-PCR results between 7.94 to 37.42 (in 23.2 % > 30). Two false negative results (0.28%) were recorded from patients with Ct values > 30. 14 (1.69%) discordant results were reviewed case-by-case and usually associated with either very early or very advanced stages of infection. Furthermore, patients initially negative with the ID NOW(TM) COVID-19 test and admitted to the hospital were tested again on days 5 and 12: no patient became positive. Discussion. The ID NOW(TM) COVID-19 test for detection of SARS-CoV-2 demonstrated excellent diagnostic agreement with RT-PCR under the above-mentioned patients pathways implemented during the second wave. The main advantage of the system was the provision of reliable results within a few minutes. This not only allowed immediate initiative of appropriate therapy and care for COVID-19 (patient benefit) but provided essential information on isolation and thus available beds. This drastically helped the overall finances of the department and additionally allowed more patients to be admitted including those requiring immediate attention; this was not possible during the first wave since beds were blocked waiting for diagnostic confirmation. Our findings also show that when interpreting the results, the clinical condition and epidemiological history of the patient must be taken into account, as with any test procedure. Overall, the ID NOW(TM) COVID-19 test for SARS-CoV-2 provided a rapid and reliable alternative to laboratory-based RT-PCR in the real clinical setting which became an acceptable part of the daily routine within the ED and demonstrated that early patient management can mitigate the impact of the pandemic on the hospital.","Kortuem, S.

METHODS Design Population-based historical rate comparison study and self-controlled case series (SCCS) analysis. Setting Primary care records from the United Kingdom. Participants Individuals who received the first dose of ChAdOx1 or BNT162b2 between 8 December 2020 and 6 March 2021. A cohort with a first positive RT-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 between 1 September 2020 and 28 February 2021 was used for comparison. Main outcome measures Outcomes included Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS), Bell's palsy, encephalomyelitis, and transverse myelitis. Incidence rates were estimated in the 28 days post first-dose vaccine, 90 days post-COVID-19, and between 2017 to 2019 for the general population cohort for background rates. Indirectly standardised incidence ratios (SIRs) were estimated. Adjusted incidence rate ratios (IRR) were estimated from the SCCS when sufficient statistical power was reached. Results We included 1,868,767 ChAdOx1 and 1,661,139 BNT162b2 vaccinees; 299,311 people infected with COVID-19; and 2,290,537 from the general population. SIRs for GBS were 1.91 [95% CI: 0.86 to 4.26] after ChAdOx1, 1.29 [0.49 to 3.45] after BNT162b2, and 5.20 [1.95 to 13.85] after COVID-19. In the same cohorts, SIRs for Bell's palsy were 1.34 [1.05 to 1.72], 1.15 [0.88 to 1.50], and 1.23 [0.80 to 1.89], and for encephalomyelitis 1.62 [0.61 to 4.31], 0.86 [0.22 to 3.46], and 11.05 [5.27 to 23.17], respectively. Transverse myelitis was too rare to analyse (n<5 in all cohorts). SCCS analysis was only conducted for Bell's palsy due to limited statistical power. We found no association between either vaccine and Bell's palsy, with an IRR of 1.10 [0.81 to 1.46] and 1.15 [0.87 to 1.49] for BNT162b2 and ChAdOx1, respectively.

Objective This study provides a standardized technique of performing an ultrasound (US)-guided percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy (PDT) on COVID-19 patients in the intensive care unit (ICU). It also outlines safety strategies for health care providers that includes proper use of personal protective equipment (PPE) and regular testing of otolaryngologists for COVID-19 contamination. Methods This study analyzed data from 44 PDT procedures performed on COVID-19 patients in the ICU of hospitals in Sao Paulo and Santos, Brazil. The PDT procedures were conducted between April 2020 and August 2020, which coincided with a peak of the COVID-19 pandemic in S?o Paulo, Brazil. Surgeons were tested for COVID-19 using a two-stage serological enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay specific for SARS-CoV-2 antigens. Conclusion This study describes a safe standardized technique of US-guided PDT for COVID-19 patients in the ICU using a method that also decreases the risk of surgeon contamination.","Tenório, Lucas Ribeiro Nakai Marianne Yumi Artese Araújo Giancarlo Menezes Marcelo Benedito Bertelli Antônio Augusto Tupinambá Romeo Dominic Rajasekaran Karthik Gonçalves Antonio José",Laryngoscope Investigative Otolaryngology,https://doi.org/10.1002/lio2.658,114

The present research article introduces the theory of an innovative hybrid model called the fuzzy bipolar soft expert sets, as a natural extension of two existing models (including fuzzy soft expert sets and fuzzy bipolar soft sets). The proposed model is highly suitable for describing the bipolarity of fuzzy soft information having multiple expert opinions. Some fundamental properties of the developed hybrid model are discussed, including subset, complement, union, intersection, AND operation, and OR operation. The proposed concepts are explained with detailed examples. Moreover, to demonstrate the applicability of our initiated model, an application of the proposed hybrid model is presented along with the developed algorithm to tackle the real-world group decision-making situation, that is, ranking effectiveness of tests in spread analysis of COVID-19. Finally, a comparative analysis of the developed model with some existing mathematical tools such as fuzzy soft expert sets and fuzzy bipolar soft sets is provided to show the cogency and reliability of the initiated model. © 2021 Ghous Ali et al.","Ali, G.; Muhiuddin, G.; Adeel, A.; Zain Ul Abidin, M.",Mathematical Problems in Engineering,https://doi.org/10.1155/2021/5874216,114

STUDY DESIGN: A descriptive cross-sectional study. PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY: Department of Pediatrics, Kastamonu Training and Research Hospital, Kastamonu, Turkey from March to December 2020. METHODOLOGY: Seventy-nine children, hospitalised with the diagnosis of COVID-19, were included in the study and were divided into two groups as symptomatic and asymptomatic. The demographic data, laboratory results and clinics of the patients of the two groups were compared. RESULTS: The mean age of participants was 10.43 ± 5.91 (0-17) years, and 57% (n=45) of them were girls. Five patients in the symptomatic group had comorbidities (2 allergic asthma, cerebral palsy, type-1 diabetes mellitus and anorexia nervosa). The most common symptom was fever (36.7%, n=29). It was noteworthy that everyone with an NLR >3.13 (high-NLR) was symptomatic. Significantly more patients in the high-NLR group were symptomatic compared with the low-NLR group (p=0.005). On the other hand, symptomatic children had significantly higher levels of C-reactive protein (2.8 (IQR: 1.2-10.0) mg/L vs. 1.4 (IQR: 0.4-2.0) mg/L, p=0.011); and procalcitonin (0.05 (IQR: 0.02-0.10) ng/mL vs. 0.01 (IQR: 0.00-0.03) ng/mL, p<0.001) than those without symptoms. One of the children with cerebral palsy died from pneumonia during the study. CONCLUSION: C-reactive protein, procalcitonin and NLR levels were found to be significantly higher in symptomatic children. NLR can be suggested as a potential marker associated with disease severity in COVID-19 patients, which needs to be supported by other studies.

The discussion is centered around the idea of detecting an upscattering event mediated by a transition magnetic moment in a neutrino or dark matter experiment. Considering neutrinos from all known sources, as well as including all available data from XENON1T and Borexino, we derive the strongest up-to-date exclusion limits on the active-to-sterile neutrino transition magnetic moment. We then study complementary constraints from astrophysics and cosmology, performing, in particular, a thorough analysis of BBN. We find that these data sets scrutinize most of the relevant parameter space. Explaining the XENON1T excess with transition magnetic moments is marginally possible if conservative assumptions are adopted regarding the supernova 1987A and CMB constraints. Finally, we discuss model-building challenges that arise in scenarios that feature large magnetic moments while keeping neutrino masses well below 1 eV. We present a successful ultraviolet-complete model of this type based on TeV-scale leptoquarks, establishing links with muon magnetic moment, B physics anomalies, and collider searches at the LHC.","Brdar, Vedran; Greljo, Admir; Kopp, Joachim; Opferkuch, Toby",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.15563v3.pdf,114

To improve the computational efficiency for solving the robust DBN optimisation model, a tabu search heuristic is proposed for the first time in this paper.

174053,Social distancing to avoid SARSCov-2 infection in cancer and noncancer patients,2021,"Influenza virus is a major respiratory viral pathogen responsible for the deaths of hundreds of thousands worldwide each year. Current vaccines provide protection primarily by inducing strain-specific antibody responses with the requirement of a match between vaccine strains and circulating strains. It has been suggested that anti-influenza T-cell responses, in addition to antibody responses may provide the broadest protection against different flu strains. Therefore, to address this urgent need, it is desirable to develop a vaccine candidate with an ability to induce balanced adaptive immunity including cell mediated immune responses. A live viral vector technology should exhibit safety, immunogenicity, effectiveness in the presence of pre-existing immunity, and the ability to induce mucosal immune responses. Here, we used VC2, an established Herpes Simplex Virus type 1 vaccine vector, to express the influenza HA protein. We show that this virus is capable of generating potent and specific anti-influenza humoral and cell-mediated immune responses. We further show that a single vaccination with the VC2-derived influenza vaccine protects mice from lethal challenge with influenza virus. Our data support the continued development of VC2-derived influenza vaccines for protection of human populations from both seasonal and pandemic strains of influenza. Finally, our results support the potential of VC2-derived vaccines as a platform for the rapid development of vaccines against emerging and established pathogens, particularly respiratory pathogens.","Rider, Paul J.F.; Dulin, Harrison; Uche, Ifeanyi K.; McGee, Michael C.; Breitenstein, Blake; Tan, Gene S.; Huang, Weishan; Kousoulas, Konstantin G.; Hai, Rong",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.08.05.455241,114

An estimated 6.2 million Americans age 65 and older are suffering from Alzheimer’s dementia today. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is widely used for the clinical diagnosis of AD. In the meanwhile, medical researchers have identified 40 risk locus using single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) information from Genome-wide association study (GWAS) in the past decades. However, existing studies usually treat MRI and GWAS separately. For instance, convolutional neural networks are often trained using MRI for AD diagnosis. GWAS and SNPs are frequently used to identify genomic traits. In this study, we propose a multi-modal AD diagnosis neural network that uses both MRIs and SNPs. The proposed method demonstrates a novel way to use GWAS findings by directly including SNPs in predictive models. We test the proposed methods on the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative dataset. The evaluation results show that the proposed method improves the model performance on AD diagnosis and achieves 93.5% AUC and 96.1% AP, respectively, when patients have both MRI and SNP data. We believe this work brings exciting new insights to GWAS applications and sheds light on future research directions.","Ying, Qi; Xing, Xin; Liu, Liangliang; Lin, Ai-Ling; Jacobs, Nathan; Liang, Gongbo",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.07.443184,114

It is advocated that complex systems theory, in general, and synergetics, in particular, provide a valuable and comprehensive repertoire of tools and concepts such as the concept of amplitude equations and order parameters to study the spread of COVID-19 in human populations. Specifically, within the framework of SIR and SEIR compartment models COVID-19 trajectories are described in terms of amplitude equations and order parameters. By plotting simulated and semi-empirical COVID-19 case trajectories it is shown that the initial epidemics in China, in general, and Wuhan city, in particular, during the first quarter of the year 2020 followed relatively simple amplitude dynamics in SIR and SEIR model state spaces describing interaction classes of individuals. The amplitudes evolve along certain paths or directions determined by order parameters that are well known to exist in complex systems. In summary, the present work highlights that COVID-19 outbreaks are constrained by general principles that hold for a broad class of phenomena in living and non-living systems.","Frank, T.

177051,Patient Perception of OxbrytaTM Treatment Benefit,2020,"Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disease affecting the synovial joints where different subsets of CD4+ T cells are suspected to play a pathogenic role. So far, our understanding of the contribution of cytotoxic CD4+ T cells is incomplete, particularly in the context of the recently described peripheral helper T-cell subset (TPH). Here, using single cell sequencing and multi-parameter flow cytometry, we show that cytotoxic CD4+ T cells are enriched in synovial fluid of anti-citrullinated peptides antibody (ACPA)-positive RA patients. We identify two distinct TPH states differentially characterized by the expression of CXCL13 and PRDM1, respectively. Our data reveal that the adhesion G-Protein Coupled Receptor 56 (GPR56), a marker of circulating cytotoxic cells, delineates the synovial TPH CD4+ T-cell subset. At the site of inflammation, GPR56+CD4+ T cells expressed the tissue-resident memory markers LAG-3, CXCR6 and CD69. Further, TCR clonality analysis revealed that most expanded clones in SF are contained within the cytotoxic and the CXCL13+ TPH CD4+ T-cell populations. Finally, the detection of common TCRs between the two TPH and cytotoxic CD4+ T-cell clusters suggest a shared differentiation. Our study provides comprehensive immunoprofiling of the heterogenous T-cell subsets at the site of inflammation in ACPA+ RA and suggests GPR56 as a therapeutic target to modulate TPH cells and cytotoxic CD4+ T cell function","Argyriou, A.; Wadsworth, M.

177283,Characterizing the effective reproduction number during the COVID-19 epidemic: Insights from Qatar experience,2021-10-07,"The emergence of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has led to a cost and time crisis for most construction projects around the world. Adherence to COVID-19 response guidelines for construction sites may prevent the occurrence of COVID-19 cases, which eliminates the risk of site closure. However, adding a disinfection process to the construction process, as mandated in COVID-19 response guidelines, increases overall construction cost and time. Conversely, however, not adding a disinfection process may result in COVID-19 cases among construction workers, which would delay construction and perhaps even cause closure of the construction site. Therefore, this study analyzed the feasibility of COVID-19 response guidelines for construction sites, especially the addition of a disinfection process, in terms of cost and time. To this end, CYClic Operations NEtwork (CYCLONE) models were developed to simulate the construction process, and a case study was conducted to validate the applicability of the suggested approach. The results showed that compliance with COVID-19 response guidelines increased the number of working days and the construction costs of the subject construction project, but because there was no more risk of construction site closure, the construction delays were short, and the liquidated damages were minimized. Through the method proposed in this study, it is possible to estimate construction cost and time before and after the COVID-19 pandemic;this method could be used to provide data for both owners and contractors to pro-actively recognize and respond to situations or damage caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Instructions for the lockdown of religious minority communities were issued a week later. The total lockdown of the Danish religious landscape is both historically unprecedented and radical in a global context, and it raises questions about mediatized religion and religion–state relations in a postsecular society. Building on quantitative and qualitative data collected during the lockdown and the gradual opening of society in 2020, this article examines the media usage of the Danish national church and of the 28 recognized Muslim communities. It reevaluates Heidi A. Campbell’s ‘religious-social shaping approach to technology’ by examining how religious communities sought to establish continuity between their offline and online practices to maintain authority and community cohesion. We conclude (1) that the willingness of religious communities to cooperate with authorities was high, (2) that the crisis affected religious communities’ organizational framework and societal position, and (3) that Campbell’s approach needs to pay further attention to the conflict-producing aspects of negotiations on digitalized rituals, the importance of transnationalism, and differences between minority and majority religion.","Kühle, Lene Larsen Tina Langholm",Religions,https://doi.org/10.3390/rel12070496,114

Many students engage with online videos that enable them to watch, and re-watch these support materials flexibly and at their own pace. In our large-enrolment introductory first-year physics unit, many students find the content very challenging. To support their learning, we have developed short videos of 4-7 minutes explaining concepts and providing demonstrations of the problemsolving process. Our study was originally designed to evaluate and compare the effect on conceptual understanding and self-efficacy of students engaging with two different types of videos: screencasts (e.g. Khan Academy style) and lightboard videos, where the teacher presents direct to the camera on a writable transparent board (the image is then inverted to be the right way round). Then COVID struck, and all our learning was moved online. Thus, in the second semester of the study, we only used screencasts, and focused our research on exploring the relationship between online engagement, self-efficacy and conceptual understanding of students. We found that students preferred lightboards, and that both semesters' average survey scores on self-efficacy and conceptual understanding were generally stable or increased only slightly. This is at odds with other studies of similar cohorts. However, the small number of paired responses in our study meant that a self-selection bias may have skewed results. Scores on the conceptual understanding were weakly correlated with assessment performance, suggesting the presence of other contributing variables. Initial self-efficacy scores did not predict subsequent engagement. Instead, missing multiple early assessments was identified as a stronger predictor of failing to pass the subject. © 2021.

Most effective drugs are, however, characterized by serious side effects upon long usage. It is, therefore, imperative to explore natural sources for efficient therapeutics with little or no side effects. This paper outlines the therapeutic potentials of endophytes using published articles on endophytes in both Web of Science (WoS) and Scopus (1990–2020). Scientific evidences discussed in this review suggest endophytic microbes as reservoirs of novel bioactive compounds belonging to the following classes alkaloid, xanthones, methoxyphenols, depsipeptide, bicyclic lactones, depsidoenes, butenolides, maleimide-bearing compounds, ergosterol, spirobisnaphthalenes, benzopyran derivatives, isofuranonaphthalenone, butyrolactones, diketopiperazine, sesquiterpenoids, cytochalasin-related compounds, pestalols and cyclic pentapeptides. The identified compounds are characterized by promising therapeutic potentials such as antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, anticancer, antidiabetic, antiviral, neuroprotective, and hepatoprotective properties, which are significant to healthy living and sustainable healthcare. This review further discusses the emerging potentials of endophytes in the production of antibiofilm, anti-multiresistant Staphylococcus aureus (anti-MRSA) and lipase inhibitors (LIs). The prospective applications of endophytes in the development of anti-COVID-19 medications and therapeutics for the management of neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) are also advocated in this review. The therapeutic potentials of endophytes, if properly harnessed, would in no small measure contribute to good health, which is an integral part of the sustainable development goals (SDGs) of the United Nations (UN). © 2021 The Author(s).

With this pilot study, we propose a mix of pedagogical genres that includes technical communication and entrepreneurial thinking (ET) in a soft-hard content language integrated learning (CLIL) platform. The pilot project discussed here is aimed at promoting ET in language classroom using four digital storytelling (DS) assignments with new media in a technical writing and design context. The project measures students' overall performance with the DS assignments and self-reports of their overall perception of the tasks and use of the software. The content area studied is specific to the COVID-19 related disruptive technologies in the market. Preliminary results suggested that students were mostly capable of performing the necessary content research and represented the information successfully for the DS exercises. However, results also indicated the importance of multiple iterations that will likely help students value the importance of the instructional guidelines provided when completing the exercises. A mismatch was observed between students' levels of satisfaction with the DS exercises and software tools used, and actual performance outcomes.","Roy, D.; Ieee,",2021 9th International Conference on Information and Education Technology,https://doi.org/10.1109/iciet51873.2021.9419628,114
180855,This Lyrical Life: Music Therapy in Oncology,2021,"Purpose: China has emerged as an undisputed leader of global business and as a preferred hub for global value chains. However, recent threats of the trade war, the allegation of violation of intellectual property rights and more recently the COVID-19 pandemic seemed to have dampened China’s attractiveness. Multinational corporations may be contemplating diversifying their dependence on China – a strategy known as “China-Plus-One”. What could be possible destinations in Asia for such a diversification strategy? Design/methodology/approach: Towards understanding the “China-Plus-One” phenomenon, the authors use a methodology of arriving at an aggregate ranking of the major economies of emerging Asia. This is built on a few standard indices such as World Bank's Logistic Performance Index;World Bank’s Ease of Doing Business Indicator;World Economic Forum’s Global Competitiveness Index;Economic Complexity Index of the Harvard University;Economist Magazine’s Country Rating of Financial Strength;and Corruption Perception Index compiled by the Transparency International. Accordingly, the authors rank seven countries (namely, Thailand, Malaysia, India, Vietnam, Indonesia, the Philippines and Bangladesh) next to China as possible destinations for selecting the “Plus one” country. Findings: In the aggregate ranking, China ranks first followed by Thailand, Malaysia, Philippines, India, Indonesia, Vietnam and then Bangladesh. This sequence gives some pointers on the possible shifts from China as potential hubs of global value chains. The authors observe the following: first, it is challenging to move away from China in the short run;second, corporations could pursue a “China-plus-One” strategy, whereby they may move marginally from China and relocate part of their supply chain elsewhere;third, in looking for alternative locations, corporations may look for the following countries in emerging Asia, namely, Thailand, Malaysia, India, Vietnam, Indonesia, Philippines and Bangladesh. Originality/value: The aggregate ranking method applied in this paper is one of the first applications in the context of ranking developing Asian economies based on economic, logistics, supply chain, financial and corruption metrics. It is one of the first conceptual works in the domain of identifying possible diversification options for the “China-Plus-One” strategy that can be extended to include many context-specific rankings. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Basu, P.; Ray, P.",Journal of Business Strategy,https://doi.org/10.1108/jbs-04-2021-0066,114
181867,Novel approach to improve the diagnosis of pediatric cancer in Kenya via telehealth education,2021,"Abstract Introduction. The aim of this study was to investigate how age and underlying medical conditions affect the risk of severe outcomes following SARS-CoV-2 infection and how they should be weighed while prioritising vaccinations against COVID-19. Methods. This population-based register study includes all SARS-CoV-2 PCR-test-positive cases until 24 Feb 2021, based on the Finnish National Infectious Diseases Register. The cases were linked to other registers to identify presence of comorbidities and severe outcomes (hospitalisation, intensive care treatment, death). The odds of severe outcomes were compared in those with and without the pre-specified comorbidities using logistic regression. Furthermore, population-based rates were compared between those with a given comorbidity and those without any of the specified comorbidities using negative binomial regression. Results. Age and various comorbidities were found to be predictors of severe COVID-19. Compared to 60-69-year-olds, the odds ratio (OR) of death was 7.1 for 70-79-year-olds, 26.7 for 80-89-year-olds, and 55.8 for 90-year-olds and over. Among the 20-69-year-olds, chronic renal disease (OR 9.4), malignant neoplasms (5.8), hematologic malignancy (5.6), chronic pulmonary disease (5.4), and cerebral palsy or other paralytic syndromes (4.6) were strongly associated with COVID-19 mortality; severe disorders of the immune system (8.0), organ or stem cell transplant (7.2), chronic renal disease (6.7), and diseases of myoneural junction and muscle (5.5) were strongly associated with COVID-19 hospitalisation. Type 2 diabetes and asthma, two very common comorbidities, were associated with all three outcomes, with ORs from 2.1 to 4.3. The population-based rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection decreased with age. Taking the 60-69-year-olds as reference, the rate ratio was highest (3.0) for 20-29-year-olds but under 1 for 70-79-year-olds and 80-89-year-olds. Conclusion. Comorbidities predispose for severe COVID-19 among younger ages. In vaccine prioritisation both the risk of infection and the risk of severe outcomes, if infected, should be combined.","Salo, H.; Lehtonen, T.; Auranen, K.; Baum, U.; Leino, T.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.07.04.21259954v1?rss=1,114

Despite that conserved binding patterns for a few commonly used FGs have been reported in the literature, large-scale identification and evaluation of FG-based 3D binding motifs are still lacking. Here, we developed AFTME, an alignment-free method for automatic mapping of 3D motifs to different FGs of a specific ligand through two-dimensional clustering. Applying our method to 233 nature-existing ligands, we defined 481 FG-binding motifs that are highly conserved across different ligand-binding pockets. Systematic analysis further reveals four main classes of binding motifs corresponding to distinct sets of FGs. Combinations of FG-binding motifs facilitate proteins to bind a wide spectrum of ligands with various binding affinities. Finally, we showed that these general binding patterns are also applicable to target-drug interactions, providing new insights into structure-based drug design.","Yang, Liu; He, Wei; Yun, Yuehui; Gao, Yongxiang; Zhu, Zhongliang; Teng, Maikun; Liang, Zhi; Niu, Liwen",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.09.27.315762,114

To leverage data from self-tracking tools in epidemiological studies on fertility or the menstrual cycle's effects on diseases and symptoms, it is critical to have methods for identifying reproductive events, e.g. ovulation, pregnancy losses or births. We present two coupled hidden semi-Markov models that adapt to changes in tracking behavior, explicitly capture variable-- and state-- dependent missingness, allow for variables of different type, and quantify uncertainty. The accuracy on synthetic data reaches 98% with no missing data, 90% with realistic missingness, and 94% accuracy on our partially labeled real-world time series. Our method also accurately predicts cycle length by learning user characteristics. It is publicly available (HiddenSemiMarkov R package) and transferable to any health time series, including self-reported symptoms and occasional tests.","Symul, L.; Holmes, S.

184630,[The Effects of COVID-19 Pandemic on Surgery of Cancer Patients].,2020-12-01,"Aim: To examine ABO and Rh blood group distribution in COVID-19 related deaths considering demographics and pathological conditions. Materials and Methods: We conducted a retrospective study at the University Hospital Centre Split, Croatia, that included 245 COVID-positive individuals that died from April 8, 2020, to January 25, 2021. From the hospital database, we extracted data on their blood groups, demographics, and pre-existing comorbidities. To compare findings with the general population, we used information from collected blood group donations (n = 101357) and statistical reports of non-COVID deaths from 2019 (n = 4968). Results: The proportion of males was significantly higher in analyzed subjects than in non-COVID deaths from 2019 (63.7% vs. 48.9%, P < 0.001), while the proportion of older individuals did not differ (P = 0.8). The most common pre-existing diseases were hypertension (59.6%), diabetes (37.1%), heart failure (28.8%), digestive disorder (26.5%), and solid tumor (21.6%). The ABO distribution in the deceased and donors' group showed statistically significant differences, with the higher prevalence of A/AB group and lower prevalence of 0, but with individual differences significant only for AB and non-AB groups. There was a significantly reduced proportion of females within the deceased with group 0 (P = 0.014) and a higher proportion of AB individuals with coronary heart disease (P = 0.024), while other differences were not significant. Conclusion: The study confirmed a higher risk of death in male individuals. The lower proportion of type 0 in deceased individuals was more pronounced in females, implying that group 0 is not necessarily an independent protective factor. Among analyzed comorbidities, coronary heart disease was identified as a potential risk factor for AB individuals.","Brdar, I.; Jerkovic, I.; Basic, Z.; Kunac, N.; AnÄelinovic, D.; Bezic, J.; Kruzic, I.; Vuko, A.; AnÄelinovic, S.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.07.16.21260630v1?rss=1,114
185311,Estimating the Efficiency Gain of Covariate-Adjusted Analyses in Future Clinical Trials Using External Data.,2021-04-30,"Collaborative learning activities have become a common practice in current university studies due to the implantation of the EHEA. However, the COVID-19 pandemic has led to a radical and abrupt change in the teaching–learning model used in most universities, and in the way students’ group work is carried out. Given this new situation, our interest is focused on discovering how computer science students have approached group programming tasks. For this purpose, we have designed a cross-sectional pilot study to explore, from both social and technological points of view, how students carried out their group programming activities during the shutdown of universities, how they are doing them now, when social distance must be maintained, and what they have missed in both situations. The results of the study indicate that during the imposed confinement, the students adopted a programming model based on work division or distributed peer programming, and very few made use of synchronous distributed collaboration tools. After the lockdown, the students mostly opted for a model based on collaborative programming and there was an increased use of synchronous distributed collaboration tools. The specific communication, synchronization, and coordination functionalities they considered most useful or necessary were also analyzed. Among the desirable features included in a software for synchronous distributed programming, the students considered that having an audio-channel can be very useful and, possibly, the most agile method to communicate. The video signal is not considered as very necessary, being in many cases rather a source of distraction, while textual communication through a chat, to which they are very accustomed, is also well valued. In addition, version control and the possibility of recovering previous states of the practical projects were highly appreciated by the students, and they considered it necessary to record the individual contributions of each member of the team to the result.","Molina, Ana Isabel",Electronics,https://doi.org/10.3390/electronics10141728,114

185465,Is COVID-19 impacting prostate cancer screening? A survey of prostate-specific antigen test requests during a local outbreak.,2021-02-01,"COVID-19 originally started in Wuhan city in China. The disease rapidly became a worldwide pandemic, causing a respiratory illness with symptoms such as coughing, fever, and in more severe cases difficulty in breathing. With the current testing processes, it is very difficult and sometimes impossible to manage and provide the necessary treatment to suspected patients since the number of the infected is rapidly increasing. Hence, the availability of an artificial intelligent driven system can be an assistive tool to provide accurate diagnosis using radiology imaging techniques. In this paper, we put forward a new deep learning architecture, which integrates the Nested Residual Connections (NRCs) in a DarkCovidNet model, called DarkCovidNet-NRC, in order to classify chest images and to detect COVID-19 cases. The proposed architecture is validated with the K-fold cross-validation technique on X-ray and CT chest datasets separately and then combined. The experimental results reveal that the suggested model performs very well in the medical classification task and it competes with the state of the art in multiple performance metrics by respectively achieving an accuracy and precision of 0.9609 and 0.978 on the combined dataset. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Bouden, A.; Blaiech, A.

186024,Prostate cancer in African American men.,2020-03-01,"Ribophorins are two transmembrane glycoproteins characteristic of the rough endoplasmic reticulum, which are thought to be involved in the binding of ribosomes. Their biosynthesis was studied in vivo using lines of cultured rat hepatocytes (clone 9) and pituitary cells (GH 3.1) and in cell-free synthesis experiments. In vitro translation of mRNA extracted from free and bound polysomes of clone 9 cells demonstrated that ribophorins are made exclusively on bound polysomes. The primary translation products of ribophorin messengers obtained from cultured hepatocytes or from regenerating livers co-migrated with the respective mature proteins, but had slightly higher apparent molecular weights (2,000) than the unglycosylated forms immunoprecipitated from cells treated with tunicamycin. This indicates that ribophorins, in contrast to all other endoplasmic reticulum membrane proteins previously studied, contain transient amino-terminal insertion signals which are removed co-translationally. Kinetic and pulse-chase experiments with [35S]methionine and [3H]mannose demonstrated that ribophorins are not subjected to electrophoretically detectable posttranslational modifications, such as proteolytic cleavage or trimming and terminal glycosylation of oligosaccharide side chain(s). Direct analysis of the oligosaccharides of ribophorin l showed that they do not contain the terminal sugars characteristic of complex oligosaccharides and that they range in composition from Man8GlcNAc to Man5GlcNAc. These findings, as well as the observation that the mature proteins are sensitive to endoglycosidase H and insensitive to endoglycosidase D, are consistent with the notion that the biosynthetic pathway of the ribophorins does not require a stage of passage through the Golgi apparatus.",,J Cell Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2113407/,114

186615,NICE recommends photodynamic therapy for certain patients with macular degeneration.,2003,"Neurotropic coronavirus-induced encephalitis was used to evaluate recruitment, functional activation, and retention of peripheral bystander memory CD8+ T cells. Mice were first infected with recombinant vaccinia virus expressing a non-cross-reactive human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) epitope, designated p18. Following establishment of an endogenous p18-specific memory CD8+ T-cell population, mice were challenged with coronavirus to directly compare recruitment, longevity, and activation characteristics of both primary coronavirus-specific and bystander memory populations trafficking into the central nervous system (CNS). HIV-specific memory CD8+ T cells were recruited early into the CNS as components of the innate immune response, preceding CD8+ T cells specific for the dominant coronavirus epitope, designated pN. Although pN-specific T-cell numbers gradually exceeded bystander p18-specific CD8+ T-cell numbers, both populations peaked concurrently within the CNS. Nevertheless, coronavirus-specific CD8+ T cells were preferentially retained. By contrast, bystander CD8+ T-cell numbers declined to background numbers following control of CNS virus replication. Furthermore, in contrast to highly activated pN-specific CD8+ T cells, bystander p18-specific CD8+ T cells recruited to the site of inflammation maintained a nonactivated memory phenotype and did not express ex vivo cytolytic activity. Therefore, analysis of host CD8+ T-cell responses to unrelated infections demonstrates that bystander memory CD8+ T cells can comprise a significant proportion of CNS inflammatory cells during virus-induced encephalitis. However, transient CNS retention and the absence of activation suggest that memory bystander CD8+ T cells may not overtly contribute to pathology in the absence of antigen recognition.","Chen, Audrey M; Khanna, Nivedita; Stohlman, Stephen A; Bergmann, Cornelia C",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15795256/,114

We describe here the clinical characteristics and computed tomography (CT) patterns in asymptomatic young patients who had laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. METHODS This is a retrospective observational study where 25 male in-patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in Hospital Canselor Tuanku Muhriz. Demographics, clinical data and CT images of these patients were reviewed by 2 senior radiologists. RESULTS In total there were 25 patients (all males; mean age [±SD], 21.64±2.40 years; range, 18-27 years). Patients with abnormal chest CT showed a relatively low normal absolute lymphocytes count (median: 2.2 x 109/L) and absolute monocyte count (median: 0.5 x 109/L). Lactate dehydrogenase was elevated in 5 (20%) of the patients. The procalcitonin level was normal while elevated levels of alanine aminotransferase, total bilirubin, platelet and C-reactive protein were common. Baseline chest CT showed abnormalities in 6 patients. The distribution of the lesions were; upper lobe 3 (12%) lower lobe 3 (12%) with peripheral distribution 4 (16%). Of the 25 patients included, 4 (16%) had ground glass opacification (GGO), 1 (4%) had a small peripheral subpleural nodule, and 1 (4%) had a dense solitary granuloma. Four patients had typical CT features of COVID-19. CONCLUSION We found that the CT imaging showed peripheral GGO in our patients. They remained clinically stable with no deterioration of their respiratory symptoms suggesting stability in lung involvement. We postulate that rapid changes in CT imaging may not be present in young, asymptomatic, non-smoking COVID-19 patients. Thus the use of CT thoraxfor early diagnosis may be reserved for patients in the older agegroups, and not in younger patients.","Ng, B H; Nuratiqah, N A; Andrea, Y L B; Faisal, A H; Soo, C I; Najma, K; Shahizon, M M; Isa, A Z; Kamazuraman, L; Yusuf, A S; Abdul, G H; Mustafa, N; Nafisah, W Y; Azmin, S; Khoo, C S; Hemalatha, M; Ching, Z H; Low, H J; Periyasamy, P",The Medical journal of Malaysia,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32723996/,114
188172,Rat Hepatitis E in an Immunocompromised Patient.,2020-11-15,"The genome of the coronavirus transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) has been engineered as an expression vector with an infectious cDNA. The vector led to the efficient (>40 micro g/10(6) cells) and stable (>20 passages) expression of a heterologous gene (green fluorescent protein [GFP]), driven by the transcription-regulating sequences (TRS) of open reading frame (ORF) 3a inserted in the site previously occupied by the nonessential ORFs 3a and 3b. Expression levels driven by this TRS were higher than those of an expression cassette under the control of regulating sequences engineered with the N gene TRS. The recombinant TGEV including the GFP gene was still enteropathogenic, albeit with a 10- to 10(2)-fold reduction in enteric tissue growth. Interestingly, a specific lactogenic immune response against the heterologous protein has been elicited in sows and their progeny. The engineering of an additional insertion site for the heterologous gene between viral genes N and 7 led to instability and to a new genetic organization of the 3' end of the recombinant viruses. As a consequence, a major species of subgenomic mRNA was generated from a TRS with the noncanonical core sequence 5'-CUAAAA-3'. Extension of the complementarity between the TRS and sequences at the 3' end of the viral leader was associated with transcriptional activation of noncanonical core sequences. The engineered vector led to expression levels as high as those of well-established vectors and seems very promising for the development of vaccines and, possibly, for gene therapy.","Sola, Isabel; Alonso, Sara; Zúñiga, Sonia; Balasch, Mónica; Plana-Durán, Juan; Enjuanes, Luis",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12634392/,114

Methods After excluding the first 30 days since the announcement of an index case in a country, relevant data for the next forty days was collected from four countries: Belgium, Italy, South Korea and United Kingdom. Two online databases: Our World in Data and worldometer were used for the collection of data which included the number of new COVID-19 cases and the number of tests conducted on a given day. The acquired figures were transformed into per million population of the given country. The growth rate of daily COVID-19 cases was derived and was used as the regress and in a multiple linear regression with the number of tests per million population per day and the number of days since a lock-down was imposed as the regressors. Results It was found that the growth rate of daily COVID-19 cases decreased by .051% when the number of daily tests conducted per million population increased by 1. A .532% decrease in the growth rate of daily COVID-19 cases was observed with each passing day of a lock-down, which essentially represented the most effective form of social distancing. A significant regression was calculated (F (2, 155) = 35.191, p=.014), with an R2 of .054. Neither the daily number of tests conducted per million population nor the number of days of maintaining social distancing (lock-down) was individually significant contributors to the prediction of the growth rate of daily COVID-19 cases (p=.267 and p=.554 respectively). Conclusion An extensive and rapid increase in the daily number of testing capacity and maintaining social distancing can decrease the growth rate of daily COVID-19 cases. Depending on the availability of the required resources, timely implementation of these measures can lead to better outcomes for a given population.","Haroon, Muhammad Zeeshan; Khan, Suhaib Ali; Khan, Shahbaz Ali; Khan, Kashif Ali; Khan, Awais Nawaz; Farooq, Muhammad Umer; Aurangzeb, Ahsan","Journal of Ayub Medical College, Abbottabad : JAMC",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33754532/,114

Both Nebraska NCD viruses were demonstrated in this experimental animal. However, the adenovirus was not re-isolated.

The Italian Society for Rheumatology promptly launched a retrospective and anonymised data collection to monitor COVID-19 in patients with rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases (RMDs), the CONTROL-19 surveillance database, which is part of the COVID-19 Global Rheumatology Alliance. METHODS CONTROL-19 includes patients with RMDs and proven severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) updated until May 3rd 2020. In this analysis, only molecular diagnoses were included. The data collection covered demographic data, medical history (general and RMD-related), treatments and COVID-19 related features, treatments, and outcome. In this paper, we report the first descriptive data from the CONTROL-19 registry. RESULTS The population of the first 232 patients (36% males) consisted mainly of elderly patients (mean age 62.2 years), who used corticosteroids (51.7%), and suffered from multi-morbidity (median comorbidities 2). Rheumatoid arthritis was the most frequent disease (34.1%), followed by spondyloarthritis (26.3%), connective tissue disease (21.1%) and vasculitis (11.2%). Most cases had an active disease (69.4%). Clinical presentation of COVID-19 was typical, with systemic symptoms (fever and asthenia) and respiratory symptoms. The overall outcome was severe, with high frequencies of hospitalisation (69.8%), respiratory support oxygen (55.7%), non-invasive ventilation (20.9%) or mechanical ventilation (7.5%), and 19% of deaths. Male patients typically manifested a worse prognosis. Immunomodulatory treatments were not significantly associated with an increased risk of intensive care unit admission/mechanical ventilation/death. CONCLUSIONS Although the report mainly includes the most severe cases, its temporal and spatial trend supports the validity of the national surveillance system. More complete data are being acquired in order to both test the hypothesis that RMD patients may have a different outcome from that of the general population and determine the safety of immunomodulatory treatments.","Scirè, Carlo Alberto; Carrara, Greta; Zanetti, Anna; Landolfi, Gianpiero; Chighizola, Cecilia; Alunno, Alessia; Andreoli, Laura; Caporali, Roberto; Gerli, Roberto; Sebastiani, Gian Domenico; Valesini, Guido; Sinigaglia, Luigi",Clinical and experimental rheumatology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32723435/,114

Immunization of dams can provide passive protection in neonatal calves; antibodies transferred through colostrum block colonization of bacteria, thereby preventing disease. In this study, healthy pregnant heifers were vaccinated at approximately 3 months of gestation with either a polyvalent oil-adjuvanted vaccine containing inactivated coronavirus, rotavirus, E. coli K99 subunit antigen, and Clostridium perfringens b and e toxoid or normal saline as a placebo. Calves were allowed to nurse immediately after birth, were orally challenged with virulent heterologous enterotoxigenic E. coli at 1 day of age, and were observed for clinical signs of scours for 10 days. Signs of severe scours were noted in 75% of control calves and 28.6% of vaccinates, and the severity of scours was significantly higher (P = .0382) in the control group. The mortality rate was significantly higher (P = .0007) in the control group (80%) than in the vaccinate group (14%). These findings indicate that the vaccination of pregnant heifers at as early as 3 months of gestation (6 months before calving) provides passive protection in neonatal calves against colibacillosis.","Jayappa, Huchappa; Davis, Randy; Dierks, Lindy; Sweeney, Diane; Wasmoen, Terry",Veterinary therapeutics : research in applied veterinary medicine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19177333/,114

This paper reports a pregnant woman with COVID-19, for whom a cesarean section was successfully performed in our hospital on February 8, 2020. Anesthetic management, protection of medical staff and psychological intervention for the patients during the operation are discussed. Importance should be attached to the preoperative evaluation of pregnant women with COVID-19 and the implementation of anesthesia plan. For ordinary COVID-19 patients intraspinal anesthesia is preferred in cesarean section, and the influence on respiration and circulation in both maternal and infant should be reduced; while for severe or critically ill patients general anesthesia with endotracheal intubation should be adopted. The safety of medical environment should be ensured, and level-Ⅲ standard protection should be taken for anesthetists. Special attention and support should be given to maternal psychology. It is important to give full explanation before operation to reduce anxiety; to relieve the discomfort during operation to reduce tension; to avoid the bad mood of patients due to pain after operation.","Kang, Xianhui; Zhang, Rong; He, Huiliang; Yao, Yongxing; Zheng, Yueying; Wen, Xiaohong; Zhu, Shengmei",Zhejiang da xue xue bao.

Epidemiological data implicated 1,1'-ethylidenebis (L-tryptophan) (EBT) (peak 97 or peak E) as a possible etiologic agent. We showed previously that Lewis rats treated with the L-TRP implicated in EMS develop fasciitis and perimyositis similar to those seen in human EMS. We now report the pathology associated with the treatment of Lewis rats with synthetic EBT and/or L-TRP. All animals treated for 6 wk with case-associated L-TRP or EBT developed significant myofascial thickening, compared with animals in the vehicle control and control L-TRP groups. However, even those animals receiving the control L-TRP showed a mild but significant increase in the thickness of the myofascia, compared with vehicle-treated control animals. All animals except vehicle controls also exhibited significant pancreatic pathology, including fibrosis and acinar changes. Only animals treated with case-associated L-TRP for 6 wk showed evidence of immune activation with increased frequency of CD8, Ia, and IL-2 receptor-positive cells in the peripheral blood. Animals receiving L-TRP or EBT for < 6 wk did not show significant differences in myofascial thickness, although these animals did show pancreatic acinar changes. Although these results demonstrate for the first time the pathological effects of EBT, they do not rule out the possibility that other impurities in the EMS-case-associated L-TRP may also contribute to some of the features of EMS.","Love, L A; Rader, J I; Crofford, L J; Raybourne, R B; Principato, M A; Page, S W; Trucksess, M W; Smith, M J; Dugan, E M; Turner, M L",The Journal of clinical investigation,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8450062/,114

Infections may interfere with animal experiments, and there are no scientific reasons why the non-rodent species should be of a lower microbiological quality than the rodent species. Therefore, a system for health monitoring of pigs was developed in order to raise the quality of laboratory pigs to the level of laboratory rodents. This system, which includes screening for several viruses, bacteria and ecto- and endoparasites, was used for monitoring minipigs from a barrier unit with the same standards applied to rodents units. In these pigs only rotaviruses are found, which was shown by both serological antibody detection and by detection of rotaviral antigen in faeces. In minipigs from another unit with far less hygienic protection rotaviruses were also found along with certain influenza- and coronaviruses, as well as Pasteurella spp. It is concluded, that it is possible to raise pigs of a microbiological quality comparable to the quality of rats and mice, and that advanced microbiological monitoring in pigs will reveal useful information.","Hansen, A K; Farlov, H; Bollen, P",Laboratory animals,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9230498/,114

A new strain of the canine parvovirus is identified, from which the pathogenicity is not yet completely clarified. Infection with West Nile virus is associated with progressive neurological disease and subclinical infections in dogs. Infection with equine influenza A (H3N8) or a highly related influenza virus can cause severe respiratory disease and mortality in greyhounds and other dogs.

These counties account for an important part of the Croatian commercial pig production and have a high density of wild boars. Samples were tested for antibodies to porcine parvovirus (PPV), Aujeszky's disease virus (ADV), porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2), swine influenza virus, porcine respiratory and reproductive syndrome virus (PRRSV), porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV), transmissible gastroenteritis virus, and swine vesicular disease virus (SVDV). Antibodies to all of the infectious pathogens except SVDV were detected. There was a statistically significant difference in prevalence between the two periods for PPV, ADV, PCV2, PRRSV, and PRCV, with a higher prevalence of PPV and ADV in the 2009-10 period (P<0.05). During the same period, the prevalence of PCV2, PRRSV, and PRCV was lower (P<0.05). Our results provide information on the current disease exposure and health status of wild boars in Croatia and suggest that wild boars may act as a reservoir for several pathogens and a source of infection for domestic pigs and other livestock as well as humans, especially for ADV.","Roic, Besi; Jemersic, Lorena; Terzic, Svjetlana; Keros, Tomislav; Balatinec, Jelena; Florijancic, Tihomir",Journal of wildlife diseases,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22247381/,114

MATERIALS AND METHODS A pilot randomized controlled trial. Sixty preterm infants, categorized into lidocaine (n=30) and control groups (n=30). The primary outcome was Premature Infant Pain Profile (PIPP) score, secondary outcomes included salivary cortisol, presence of cry, the duration of first cry, and adverse effects of lidocaine. RESULTS There were no statistically significant differences between lidocaine and control groups regarding PIPP scores (mean±SD: 7.2±2.3 vs. 9.3±3.0, respectively, P=0.086). None of the infants in the lidocaine group had severe pain defined as a PIPP score>12, compared with 3 (10%) infants in the control group (P=0.056). Salivary cortisol concentrations were not significantly different between the lidocaine and control groups (mean±SD: 2.57±1.79 vs. 4.82±1.61 μg/dL, respectively, P=0.11). Standardized effect sizes for topical lidocaine were medium to large for reduction in PIPP scores and large for reduction in salivary cortisol (Cohen d=-0.78 and -1.32, respectively). No adverse effects were reported in infants receiving lidocaine. DISCUSSION Our data suggest that topical lidocaine did not reduce the pain associated with the insertion of nCPAP prongs in preterm infants. However, the trends for lower PIPP scores in the lidocaine group and the effect sizes for lidocaine on PIPP scores and salivary cortisol were large enough so that a large-scale randomized clinical trial is warranted to confirm or refute our results. Such a study should compare 2 or more active pain interventions during nCPAP application, rather than evaluating a single intervention versus placebo or no treatment.","Soliman, Hasnaa; Elsharkawy, Ashraf; Abdel-Hady, Hesham",The Clinical journal of pain,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26710224/,114
201697,The Effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on cancer patient encounters,2020,"Knowledge about the new infectious disease COVID-19, which first spread in the city of Wuhan in China, in December 2019, is based on the evidence retrieved from coronaviruses previously known to humans. The main transmission ways of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are respiratory droplets and direct and close contact with infected individuals and contaminated surfaces. To date, some scientific publications provide initial evidence that SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in the air, thus assuming a further route of infection, that airborne, although these results are to be considered preliminary and they need careful interpretation. In support of this hypothesis, ventilation systems, aimed to improve indoor air, could represent an easy way to spread and promote the virus infection especially in hospitals and in all health facilities where the presence of infected individuals is potentially high as well as the possibility of infection by air. Indeed, by generating jets of air at different speeds, they can interfere with the mission of respiratory particles and determine an environmental diffusion of the potentially contaminating droplet. Therefore, ventilation systems could provide a potential transmission channel for the viral load able to spread out in indoor air. Nonetheless, good management, technical and operational practices may lead to a low risk of contagion, both in community and health environments.","Sezzatini, Romina; Sapienza, Martina; D'Ambrosio, Floriana; Moscato, Umberto; Laurenti, Patrizia",Igiene e sanita pubblica,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32877395/,114

Sensitivity and specificity of MLPA to detect hMPV is high and time to diagnosis is short. A number of other respiratory pathogens can be tested in one test run. Treatment is mainly supportive and only a few antiviral agents are available for treating paramyxovirus infections.

All calves were killed at 10 days of age. Control calves had lesions characteristic of coronavirus infection, and intestinal epithelial cells were positive by fluorescent antibody tests. In vaccinated calves, lesions of coronavirus infection were absent, and results of fluorescent antibody tests were negative.

202337,BNT162b2 mRNA Covid-19 Vaccine in a Nationwide Mass Vaccination Setting,2021,"SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus 2) has accumulated multiple mutations during its global circulation. Recently, three SARS-CoV-2 lineages, B.1.1.7 (501Y.V1), B.1.351 (501Y.V2) and B.1.1.28.1 (P.1), have emerged in the United Kingdom, South Africa and Brazil, respectively. Here, we have presented global viewpoint on implications of emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants based on structural-function impact of crucial mutations occurring in its spike (S), ORF8 and nucleocapsid (N) proteins. While the N501Y mutation was observed in all three lineages, the 501Y.V1 and P.1 accumulated a different set of mutations in the S protein. The missense mutational effects were predicted through a COVID-19 dedicated resource followed by atomistic molecular dynamics simulations. Current findings indicate that some mutations in the S protein might lead to higher affinity with host receptors and resistance against antibodies, but not all are due to different antibody binding (epitope) regions. Mutations may, however, result in diagnostic tests failures and possible interference with binding of newly identified anti-viral candidates against SARS-CoV-2, likely necessitating roll out of recurring ""flu-like shots"" annually for tackling COVID-19. The functional relevance of these mutations has been described in terms of modulation of host tropism, antibody resistance, diagnostic sensitivity and therapeutic candidates.

203661,Determining the effect of postage on the recovery of cystic fibrosis pathogens from respiratory samples,2020,"CD8+ T cells are crucial for anti-viral immunity, however, understanding T cell responses requires the identification of epitopes presented by Human Leukocyte Antigens (HLA). To date, few SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cell epitopes have been described. Internal viral proteins are typically more conserved than surface proteins and are often the target of CD8+ T cells. Therefore, we have characterised eight peptides derived from the internal SARS-CoV-2 Nucleocapsid protein predicted to bind HLA-A*02:01, the most common HLA molecule in the global population. We determined not all peptides could form a complex with HLA-A*02:01, and the six crystal structures determined revealed that some peptides adopted a mobile conformation. We therefore provide a molecular understanding of SARS-CoV-2 CD8+ T cell epitopes. Furthermore, we show that there is limited pre-existing CD8+ T cell response towards these epitopes in unexposed individuals. Together, these data show that SARS-CoV-2 Nucleocapsid might not contain potent epitopes restricted to HLA-A*02:01.","Szeto, Christopher; Chatzileontiadou, Demetra S M; Nguyen, Andrea T; Sloane, Hannah; Lobos, Christian A; Jayasinghe, Dhilshan; Halim, Hanim; Smith, Corey; Riboldi-Tunnicliffe, Alan; Grant, Emma J; Gras, Stephanie",iScience,,114

204266,"The combined analgesic effect of pregabalin and morphine in the treatment of pancreatic cancer pain, a retrospective study",2021,"BACKGROUND: The major reasons to treat sarcoidosis are to lower the morbidity and mortality risk or to improve quality of life (QoL). The indication for treatment varies depending on which manifestation is the cause of symptoms: lungs, heart, brain, skin, or other manifestations. While glucocorticoids (GC) remain the first choice for initial treatment of symptomatic disease, prolonged use is associated with significant toxicity. GC-sparing alternatives are available. The presented treatment guideline aims to provide guidance to physicians treating the very heterogenous sarcoidosis manifestations. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A European Respiratory Society Task Force (TF) committee composed of clinicians, methodologists, and patients with experience in sarcoidosis developed recommendations based on the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations) methodology. The committee developed eight PICO (Patients, Intervention, Comparison, Outcomes) questions and these were used to make specific evidence-based recommendations. RESULTS: The TF committee delivered twelve recommendations for seven PICOs. These included treatment of pulmonary, cutaneous, cardiac, and neurologic disease as well as fatigue. One PICO question regarding small fiber neuropathy had insufficient evidence to support a recommendation. In addition to the recommendations, the committee provided information on how they use alternative treatments, when there was insufficient evidence to support a recommendation. CONCLUSIONS: There are many treatments available to treat sarcoidosis. Given the diverse nature of the disease, treatment decisions require an assessment of organ involvement, risk for significant morbidity, and impact on QoL of the disease and treatment. MESSAGE: An evidence based guideline for treatment of sarcoidosis is presented. The panel used the GRADE approach and specific recommendations are made. A major factor in treating patients is the risk of loss of organ function or impairment of quality of life.","Baughman, Robert P; Valeyre, Dominique; Korsten, Peter; Mathioudakis, Alexander G; Wuyts, Wim A; Wells, Athol; Rottoli, Paola; Nunes, Hiliaro; Lower, Elyse E; Judson, Marc A; Israel-Biet, Dominique; Grutters, Jan C; Drent, Marjolein; Culver, Daniel A; Bonella, Francesco; Antoniou, Katerina; Martone, Filippo; Quadder, Bernd; Spitzer, Ginger; Nagavci, Blin; Tonia, Thomy; Rigau, David; Ouellette, Daniel R",Eur. respir. j,,114
205334,Covid-19 vaccine and autoimmunity: Awakening the sleeping dragon,2021,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global pandemic. The disease, typically characterized by bilateral pulmonary infiltrates and profound elevation of inflammatory markers, can range in severity from mild or asymptomatic illness to a lethal cytokine storm and respiratory failure. A number of recognized complications of COVID-19 infection are described in the literature. Common neurological complications include headache and anosmia. Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) is an uncommon complication described in isolated case reports. However, a causal relationship has yet to be established. This case report adds to the growing body of evidence that GBS is a potential COVID-19 complication. CASE PRESENTATION: A 70-year-old Caucasian woman with recently diagnosed COVID-19 infection presented to the emergency department with 4 days of gradually worsening ascending lower extremity weakness. Exam revealed bilateral lower extremity weakness, mute reflexes, and sensory loss. Soon after starting intravenous administration of immunoglobulin (IVIG), the patient developed respiratory distress, eventually requiring intubation. She remained intubated for the duration of her IVIG treatment. After five rounds of treatment, the patient was successfully extubated and transferred to acute rehab. Following 4 weeks of intense physical therapy, she was able to walk with assistance on room air. CONCLUSION: At the present time, this is one of the few reports of acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (AIDP) or GBS associated with COVID-19 in the United States. It is unclear whether a causal relationship exists given the nature of the syndrome. However, in light of the growing number of reported cases, physicians should be aware of this possible complication when evaluating COVID-19 patients.","Gagarkin, Dmitriy A; Dombrowski, Keith E; Thakar, Keyur B; DePetrillo, John C",J Med Case Rep,,114

205733,Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency: Home Therapy,2021,"We use geospatial data to examine the unprecedented national program currentlyunderway in the United States to distribute and administer vaccines against COVID-19. We quantify the impact of the proposed federal partnership with the companyDollar General to serve as vaccination sites and compare vaccine access with DollarGeneral to the current Federal Retail Pharmacy Partnership Program. Although dollarstores have been viewed with skepticism and controversy in the policy sector, we showthat, relative to the locations of the current federal program, Dollar General stores aredisproportionately likely to be located in Census tracts with high social vulnerability;using these stores as vaccination sites would greatly decrease the distance to vaccinesfor both low-income and minority households. We consider a hypothetical alternativepartnership with Dollar Tree and show that adding these stores to the vaccinationprogram would be similarly valuable, but impact different geographic areas than theDollar General partnership. Adding Dollar General to the current pharmacy partnersgreatly surpasses the goal set by the Biden administration of having 90% of the popu-lation within 5 miles of a vaccine site.

Guided by the model of stigma communication, we examine four types of message content, namely mark, group labeling, responsibility, and peril, that are instrumental in forming stigma beliefs and sharing stigma messages. We also explore whether the presence of misinformation and conspiracy theories in COVID-19-related tweets is associated with the presence of COVID-19 stigma content. A total of 155,353 unique COVID-19-related tweets posted between December 31, 2019, and March 13, 2020, were identified, from which 7000 tweets were randomly selected for manual coding. Results showed that the peril of COVID-19 was mentioned the most often, followed by mark, responsibility, and group labeling content. Tweets with conspiracy theories were more likely to include group labeling and responsibility information, but less likely to mention COVID-19 peril.

There are two intertwined difficulties in estimating this prevalence based on testing results from a group of subjects. First, the test is prone to measurement error with unknown sensitivity and specificity. Second, the prevalence tends to be low at the initial stage of the pandemic and we may not be able to determine if a positive test result is a false positive due to the imperfect specificity of the test. The statistical inference based on large sample approximation or conventional bootstrap may not be sufficiently reliable and yield confidence intervals that do not cover the true prevalence at the nominal level. In this paper, we have proposed a set of 95% confidence intervals, whose validity is guaranteed and doesn't depend on the sample size in the unweighted setting. For the weighted setting, the proposed inference is equivalent to a class of hybrid bootstrap methods, whose performance is also more robust to the sample size than those based on asymptotic approximations. The methods are used to reanalyze data from a study investigating the antibody prevalence in Santa Clara county, California, which was the motivating example of this research, in addition to several other seroprevalence studies where authors had tried to correct their estimates for test performance.

We aimed to evaluate lipid profile, neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and cardiovascular admissions to the coronary care unit (CCU) of a tertiary center in Turkey during the COVID-19 era and to compare these results with admissions in the same time interval of the previous year. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed CCU admissions due to new-onset atrial fibrillation, ST-elevation myocardial infarction, non-ST elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTEACS) and acute heart failure during the COVID-19 outbreak and the same time interval of the past year. Laboratory measurements including lipid profile and NLR values were retrieved from the institutional digital database. RESULTS: Compared to the same time interval of 2019 (March-April, 2019), the number of patients admitted to the CCU with acute cardiovascular disorders (atrial fibrillation, STEMI, NSTEACS and acute heart failure) were lower in the COVID-19 period. The levels of NLR, total cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol were significantly higher and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol was significantly lower in subjects admitted to the CCU during March-April 2020 compared to subjects admitted in March-April 2019. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings show that subjects admitted to the CCU in the COVID-19 era have an unfavorable lipid profile and elevated NLR compared to those admitted in 2019.

RESULTS: The average birth weight of the 22 newborns (16 males and 6 females) was 2980 g, and the mean gestational week was 37W+3. The birth weight of three babies was <2500 g, and the gestational week of all three low-birth-weight neonates was less than 36W. Three newborns had minor lesions of infection in the lungs as shown by computed tomography (CT) scans. Furthermore, three newborns had elevated SARS-CoV-2-related immunoglobin M (IgM) antibodies, and 11 newborns (52.4%) had positive immunoglobin G (IgG) antibodies. Notably, both cystatin C and ß2-microglobulin were increased in all newborns. Five of the 21 tested newborns had leukocytosis, and 11 had increased neutrophil levels. In addition, the aspartate aminotransferase of 18 newborns and the Î³-glutamyl transpeptidase of 19 newborns were increased. Total bilirubin was elevated in all newborns and serum albumin was reduced in 20 of 22 newborns. CONCLUSIONS: This study was the first to discover that COVID-19 infection in the third trimester of pregnancy could cause fetal kidney developmental injury, as indicated by increased cystatin C and ß2-microglobulin in all neonates. Furthermore, there is the possibility of maternal-fetal transmission of SARS-CoV-2.","He, Zheng; Fang, Yinian; Zuo, Qin; Huang, Xiaoxing; Lei, Yongfang; Ren, Xiuhua; Liu, Dong",Int J Antimicrob Agents,,114

212227,COVID-19 and the Emerging Regulatory Guidance for Ongoing Clinical Trials in the European Union,2021,"Deep neural speech and audio processing systems have a large number of trainable parameters, a relatively complex architecture, and require a vast amount of training data and computational power. These constraints make it more challenging to integrate such systems into embedded devices and utilise them for real-time, real-world applications. We tackle these limitations by introducing DeepSpectrumLite, an open-source, lightweight transfer learning framework for on-device speech and audio recognition using pre-trained image convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The framework creates and augments Mel-spectrogram plots on-the-fly from raw audio signals which are then used to finetune specific pre-trained CNNs for the target classification task. Subsequently, the whole pipeline can be run in real-time with a mean inference lag of 242.0 ms when a DenseNet121 model is used on a consumer-grade Motorola moto e7 plus smartphone. DeepSpectrumLite operates decentralised, eliminating the need for data upload for further processing. By obtaining state-of-the-art results on a set of paralinguistics tasks, we demonstrate the suitability of the proposed transfer learning approach for embedded audio signal processing, even when data is scarce. We provide an extensive command-line interface for users and developers which is comprehensively documented and publicly available at https://github.com/DeepSpectrum/DeepSpectrumLite.","Amiriparian, Shahin; Hubner, Tobias; Gerczuk, Maurice; Ottl, Sandra; Care, Bjorn W.

212753,Primordial odontogenic tumor occurred in the maxilla with unique calcifications and its crucial points for differential diagnosis,2020,"INTRODUCTION: At the beginning of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, controversial data were reported concerning angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) that induced a number of physicians to stop using them in patients with COVID-19. Although large-scale studies have ruled out this concern, it is common experience that patients with COVID-19 taking ACE inhibitors or ARBs are at increased risk of death. The aim of this study was to investigate the reasons for this apparently high mortality rate. METHODS: During the first wave of the pandemic, we conducted a field study of 427 consecutive patients with COVID-19 upon their admission to the emergency department of a hospital in one of the most severely hit cities in northern Italy, and 30 days later. The disease was defined as being mild, moderate or severe on the basis of clinical, laboratory and imaging data, and a multivariate model was used to analyse the determinants of mortality. RESULTS: Within 30 days of admission, 31.6% of the patients treated with ACE inhibitors or ARBs and 15.2% of those not treated with these drugs had died. Multivariate analysis showed that the determinants of mortality were age (p = 0.0001), hypertension (p = 0.0120) and diabetes (p = 0.0129), whereas ACE inhibitors or ARBs had no effect on mortality. There was no significant difference between the patients treated with ACE inhibitors and those treated with ARBs. CONCLUSION: The apparently increased mortality of patients with COVID-19 receiving long-term treatment with ACE inhibitors or ARBs is not due to the drugs themselves, but to the conditions associated with their use.","Cugno, Massimo; Gualtierotti, Roberta; Casazza, Giovanni; Tafuri, Francesco; Ghigliazza, Gabriele; Torri, Adriana; Costantino, Giorgio; Montano, Nicola; Peyvandi, Flora",Adv Ther,,114
212905,The prognosis and short-term efficacy of corticosteroid therapy for COVID-19 patients,2020,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: COVID 19 is a novel pandemic affecting globally. Although no reliable data suggests that patients of well controlled Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM) being at increased risk of becoming severely ill with SARS-CoV2, but lockdown may impact patients with T1DM requiring regular medications and follow up. Hence this study was planned to see the impact of lockdown on glycemic control in patients with T1DM. METHODS: A cross sectional study was done in T1DM patients in whom a structured questionnaire was administered on follow up within 15 days after lockdown. Data regarding hypoglycemic and hyperglycemic episodes, Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), insulin dose missed, regular glucose monitoring, dietary compliance, physical activity, hospitalization during the phase of lockdown was taken. Average blood glucose and HbA1C of lockdown phase was compared with the readings of prelockdown phase. RESULTS: Out of 52 patients, 36.5% had hyperglycemic and 15.3% had hypoglycemic episodes. Insulin dose was missed in 26.9%, glucose monitoring not done routinely in 36.5% and 17.4% were not diet compliant during lockdown. Average blood glucose during lockdown phase was 276.9 ± 64.7 mg/dl as compared to 212.3 ± 57.9 mg/dl during prelockdown phase. Mean HbA1c value of lockdown (10 ± 1.5%) which was much higher that of pre lockdown (8.8 ± 1.3%) and the difference was statistically significant (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Glycemic control of T1DM patients has worsened mainly due to non availability of insulin/glucostrips during lockdown period. There is a need for preparedness in future so that complications can be minimised.","Verma, Anjali; Rajput, Rajesh; Verma, Surender; Balania, Vikas K B; Jangra, Babita",Diabetes Metab Syndr,,114

While specific therapeutics and vaccines are being developed, a broad-spectrum therapeutic agent for RNA viruses would be beneficial for targeting newly emerging and mutated RNA viruses. In this study, we conducted a screen of repurposed drugs using Sendai virus (an RNA virus of the family Paramyxoviridae), with human-induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) to explore existing drugs that may present anti-RNA viral activity. Selected hit compounds were evaluated for their efficacy against two important human pathogens: Ebola virus (EBOV) using Huh7 cells and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) using Vero E6 cells. Selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs), including raloxifene, exhibited antiviral activities against EBOV and SARS-CoV-2. Pioglitazone, a PPARÎ³ agonist, also exhibited antiviral activities against SARS-CoV-2, and both raloxifene and pioglitazone presented a synergistic antiviral effect. Finally, we demonstrated that SERMs blocked entry steps of SARS-CoV-2 into host cells. These findings suggest that the identified FDA-approved drugs can modulate host cell susceptibility against RNA viruses.","Imamura, Keiko; Sakurai, Yasuteru; Enami, Takako; Shibukawa, Ran; Nishi, Yohei; Ohta, Akira; Shu, Tsugumine; Kawaguchi, Jitsutaro; Okada, Sayaka; Hoenen, Thomas; Yasuda, Jiro; Inoue, Haruhisa",FEBS Open Bio,,114

Whether patients with COVID-19 present specific manifestations of proximal tubule dysfunction remains unknown. To test this, we examined a cohort of 49 patients requiring hospitalization in a large academic hospital in Brussels, Belgium. There was evidence of proximal tubule dysfunction in a subset of patients with COVID-19, as attested by low-molecular-weight proteinuria (70-80%), neutral aminoaciduria (46%), and defective handling of uric acid (46%) or phosphate (19%). None of the patients had normoglycemic glucosuria. Proximal tubule dysfunction was independent of pre-existing comorbidities, glomerular proteinuria, nephrotoxic medications or viral load. At the structural level, kidneys from patients with COVID-19 showed prominent tubular injury, including in the initial part of the proximal tubule, with brush border loss, acute tubular necrosis, intraluminal debris, and a marked decrease in the expression of megalin in the brush border. Transmission electron microscopy identified particles resembling coronaviruses in vacuoles or cisternae of the endoplasmic reticulum in proximal tubule cells. Among features of proximal tubule dysfunction, hypouricemia with inappropriate uricosuria was independently associated with disease severity and with a significant increase in the risk of respiratory failure requiring invasive mechanical ventilation using Cox (adjusted hazard ratio 6.2, 95% CI 1.9-20.1) or competing risks (adjusted sub-distribution hazard ratio 12.1, 95% CI 2.7-55.4) survival models. Thus, our data establish that SARS-CoV-2 causes specific manifestations of proximal tubule dysfunction and provide novel insights into COVID-19 severity and outcome.","Werion, Alexis; Belkhir, Leila; Perrot, Marie; Schmit, Gregory; Aydin, Selda; Chen, Zhiyong; Penaloza, Andrea; De Greef, Julien; Yildiz, Halil; Pothen, Lucie; Yombi, Jean Cyr; Dewulf, Joseph; Scohy, Anais; Gérard, Ludovic; Wittebole, Xavier; Laterre, Pierre-François; Miller, Sara E; Devuyst, Olivier; Jadoul, Michel; Morelle, Johann",Kidney Int,,114

The present communication builds on this work and considers the probability of infection given immunity, taking into account the distribution across the population of antibody concentration in vaccinated or convalescent people. The model is consistent with the observed rates of breakthrough infection following vaccination or previous infection. The model is then developed to consider the use of quantitative measurement of antibody concentration on arrival as an aid to risk stratification of travellers. The model indicates that such a measurement could significantly decrease the quarantine time required to achieve a given level of importation risk.","Williams, David Edward",,,114
215414,Patient-reported Outcomes of Patients With Breast Cancer During the COVID-19 Outbreak in the Epicenter of China: A Cross-sectional Survey Study,2020,"Ethiopia has taken unprecedented preventive measures, such as confinement to home and closure of schools and offices to halt the spread of Corona virus pandemic in the country. Unfortunately, such orders may have been associated with intimate partner violence (IPV) against women but there is no study conducted to assess the magnitude of IPV during the lock-downs in the country. Thus, this study intended to investigate the prevalence and associated factors of IPV against women during the COVID-19 pandemic restrictions. A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted on sample of 617 married or cohabited women. A systematic random sampling technique was employed to identify and enroll women who are married. A logistic regression analysis was used to identify the predictors of IPV among women and all statistical analyses were carried out using STATA 14.2. In this study, amongst the 589 married women who were included in the analysis, 22.4% [95% CI: 19.1%, 25.9%] were experienced at least one form of IPV. Additionally, 11.0%, 20.0%, and 13.8% of women also experienced physical, psychological, and sexual IPVs respectively. After adjusting for covariate; being illiterate [AOR=2.37: 95% CI 1.29, 4.35], having illiterate husband [AOR=2.67: 95% CI 1.36, 5.21], having substance user husband (alcohol, chat or cigarettes) [AOR=2.75: 95% CI 1.42, 5.34], and community tolerant attitude to violence [AOR=2.97: 95% CI 1.17, 7.61] were the independent predictors of IPV amongst married women. In conclusion, the prevalence of IPV among married women was comparable to the national pre-COVID figure of IPV. Therefore, national and regional governments should work toward enhancing gender equality, coupled with addressing risk factors at multiple levels, using community- and institution-based approaches to prevent IPV and to specifically achieve SDG5 of eliminating violence against women by 2030.","Tadesse, Abay Woday; Tarekegn, Setegn Mihret; Wagaw, Gebeyaw Biset; Muluneh, Muluken Dessalegn; Kassa, Ayesheshim Muluneh",J Interpers Violence,,114

An online survey, comprising demographic questions and questionnaires on depression, anxiety and loneliness symptoms, was distributed in Canada during the height of social distancing restrictions during the COVID-19 pandemic. Respondents (N=661) from lower income households experienced greater anxiety, depression and loneliness. Specifically, loneliness was greater in those with an annual income <$50,000/yr versus higher income brackets. Younger females (18-29yr) displayed greater anxiety, depressive symptoms and loneliness than their male counterparts; this difference did not exist among the other age groups (30-64yr, >65yr). Moreover, loneliness scores increased with increasing depression and anxiety symptom severity category. The relationship between loneliness and depression symptoms was moderated by gender, such that females experienced higher depressive symptoms when encountering greater loneliness. These data identify younger females, individuals with lower income, and those living alone as experiencing greater loneliness and mental health challenges during the height of the pandemic in Canada. We highlight the strong relationship between loneliness, depression and anxiety, and emphasize increased vulnerability among certain cohorts.","McQuaid, Robyn J; Cox, Sylvia M L; Ogunlana, Ayotola; Jaworska, Natalia",Psychiatry Res,,114

In the face of a new infectious agent causing acute respiratory failure for which there were no known effective therapies, rapid, often pragmatic trials were necessary to evaluate potential treatments, frequently starting with medications that are already marketed for other indications. Early in the pandemic, hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin were two such candidates. OBJECTIVE: Assess the relative efficacy of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin among hospitalized patients with COVID-19. METHODS: We performed a randomized clinical trial of hydroxychloroquine vs. azithromycin among hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Treatment was 5 days of study medication. The primary endpoint was the COVID Ordinal Outcomes scale at day 14. Secondary endpoints included hospital-, ICU-, and ventilator-free days at day 28. The trial was stopped early after enrollment of 85 patients when a separate clinical trial concluded that a clinically important effect of hydroxychloroquine over placebo was definitively excluded. Comparisons were made a priori using a proportional odds model from a Bayesian perspective. RESULTS: We enrolled 85 patients at 13 hospitals over 11 weeks. Adherence to study medication was high. The estimated odds ratio for less favorable status on the ordinal scale for hydroxychloroquine vs. azithromycin from the primary analysis was 1.07, with a 95% credible interval from 0.63 to 1.83 with a posterior probability of 60% that hydroxychloroquine was worse than azithryomycin. Secondary outcomes displayed a similar, slight preference for azithromycin over hydroxychloroquine. QTc prolongation was rare and did not differ between groups. The twenty safety outcomes were similar between arms with the possible exception of post-randomization onset acute kidney injury, which was more common with hydroxychloroquine (15% vs. 0%). Patients in the hydroxychloroquine arm received remdesivir more often than in the azithromycin arm (19% vs. 2%). There was no apparent association between remdesivir use and acute kidney injury. CONCLUSIONS: While early termination limits the precision of our results, we found no suggestion of substantial efficacy for hydroxychloroquine over azithromycin. Acute kidney injury may be more common with hydroxychloroquine than azithromycin, although this may be due to the play of chance. Differential use of remdesivir may have biased our results in favor of hydroxychloroquine. Our results are consistent with conclusions from other trials that hydroxychloroquine cannot be recommended for inpatients with COVID-19; azithromycin may merit additional investigation. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: This trial was prospectively registered (NCT04329832) before enrollment of the first patient.","Brown, Samuel M; Peltan, Ithan; Kumar, Naresh; Leither, Lindsay; Webb, Brandon J; Starr, Nathan; Grissom, Colin K; Buckel, Whitney R; Srivastava, Rajendu; Butler, Allison M; Groat, Danielle; Haaland, Benjamin; Ying, Jian; Harris, Estelle; Johnson, Stacy; Paine, Robert; Greene, Tom",Ann.

It permits a purely mathematical description of the molecular structure so that in the development of identification of new drugs can be found through adequate topological indices. In this paper, we study the structural properties of the several antiviral drugs such as chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir, ritonavir, remdesivir, theaflavin, nafamostat, camostat, umifenovir and bevacizumab by considering the distance and bond measures of chemical compounds. Our quantitative values of the topological indices are extremely useful in the recent development of designing new drugs for COVID-19.","Liu, Jia-Bao; Arockiaraj, Micheal; Arulperumjothi, M; Prabhu, Savari",Int J Quantum Chem,,114

220115,Why ophthalmologists should mask: a perspective from Hong Kong,2020,"Objective: To describe the clinical manifestations and outcomes of COVID-19, and explore the risk factors of deterioration and death of the disease. Methods: In this retrospective study, we collected data from 121 COVID-19 cases confirmed by RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing in Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University from January 30, 2019, to March 23, 2020, and conducted statistical analysis. Results: A total of 121 patients were included in our study, the median age was 65 years (IQR, 55.0–71.5 years), and 54.5% cases were men. Among those cases, 52 (43.0%) cases progressed to severe, and 14 (11.6%) died. Overall, the most common manifestations were fever (78.5%) and respiratory symptoms (77.7%), while neurological symptoms were found in only 9.9% of the patients. 70.2% of all the cases had comorbidities, including hypertension (40.5%) and diabetes (20.7%). On admission, cases usually show elevated levels of neutrophils (27.3%), D-dimer (72.6%), Interleukin-6 (35.2%), Interleukin-10 (64.4%), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (82.6%), and lactate dehydrogenase (62.0%), and decreased levels of lymphocytes (66.9%), CD3 cells (67.2%), and CD4 cells (63.0%). The proportional hazard Cox models showed that the risk factors for severity progression and death included comorbidities (HR: 4.53, 95% CI: 1.78–11.55 and HR: 7.81, 95% CI: 1.02–59.86), leukocytosis (HR: 1.13; 95% CI: 1.05–1.22 and HR: 1.25, 95% CI: 1.10–1.42), neutrophilia (HR: 1.15, 95% CI: 1.07–1.13 and HR: 1.28, 95% CI: 1.13–1.46, and elevated LDH (HR: 1.14, 95% CI: 1.12–1.15 and HR: 1.11, 95% CI: 1.10–1.12). Elevated D-dimer (HR: 1.02, 95% CI: 1.01–1.03), IL-6 (HR: 1.01, 95% CI: 1.00–1.02) and IL-10 levels (HR: 1.04, 95% CI: 1.01–1.07) were also risk factors for the progression of disease severity. Meanwhile, lymphopenia and wake immune responses [e.g., lower CD3, CD4, or CD19 counts (all HR &lt; 1)] were associated with disease deterioration and death. Conclusions: Severe cases and death of COVID-19 are associated with older age, comorbidities, organ dysfunction, lymphopenia, high cytokines, and weak immune responses.","Zou, Li; Dai, Lijun; Zhang, Yangyang; Fu, Wenning; Gao, Yan; Zhang, Zhaohui; Zhang, Zhentao",Front.

During the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak, huge amount of information is increasingly available in digital information sources and overwhelms the average person. The purpose of this research was to investigate public's information seeking behavior on COVID-19 in Greece. METHOD: The study was conducted through a web-based survey, facilitated by the use of questionnaire posted on the Google Forms platform. The questionnaire consisted of closed-ended, 7-point Likert scale questions and multiple choice questions and was distributed to all over Greek Regions to almost 3.000 recipients, during the implementation of restrictive measures against the COVID-19 outbreak in Spring 2020. The data collected were subjected to a descriptive statistical analysis. The median was used to present the results. In order to perform analysis between genders, as well as age groups, the non-parametric criteria Mann-Whitney U and Kruskal-Wallis were applied to determine the existence of differences in participants' beliefs. RESULTS: Responses by 776 individuals were obtained. Individuals dedicated up to 2 h per day to be informed on COVID-19. Television, electronic press and news websites were reported by the participants as more reliable than social media, in obtaining information on COVID-19. Respondents paid attention to official sources of information (Ministry of Health, Civil Protection etc.). Family and friends played an additional role in the participants' information on COVID-19, while the personal doctor, other health workers and pharmacists did not appear to be most preferred sources of information on COVID-19. Participants' most common information seeking strategy in digital environment was keyword searching. Unreliable information, fake news and information overload were the most common difficulties that the participants encountered seeking information on COVID-19. The respondents' views seemed to differ significantly among age groups. The older the participants, the more often they were informed by television (p < 0.001) and the less often by the internet (p < 0.001). Females appear to use more frequently internet (p < 0.001) and social media (p = 0.001) out of habit and visit more often the Ministry of Health (p < 0.001) and the Civil Protection (p=0.005) websites, compared to males. Most of the participants seemed to worry about the fake news phenomenon and agreed that fake news on COVID-19 is being spread in the media and especially social networks. CONCLUSION: The study revealed that, during the COVID-19 pandemic in Greece, participants obtained information about the disease mainly by television, electronic press and news websites. On the contrary, the limited use of social media demonstrates the participants awareness of the spread of fake news on social media. This observed information seeking behavior might has contributed to individuals' acceptance of the necessary behavioral changes that had led to the Greek success story in preventing spread of the disease.","Skarpa, Paraskevi El; Garoufallou, Emmanouel",Int J Med Inform,,114

221700,Quantitative Fit Evaluation of N95 Filtering Facepiece Respirators and Coronavirus Inactivation Following Heat Treatment,2021,"OBJECT: The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted all aspects of society globally. As healthcare resources had to be preserved for infected patients, and the risk of in-hospital procedures escalated for uninfected patients and staff, neurosurgeons around the world have had to postpone non-emergent procedures. Under these unprecedented conditions, the decision to defer cases became increasingly difficult as COVID-19 cases skyrocketed. METHODS: Data was collected by self-reporting surveys during two discrete periods: the principal survey accrued responses during 2 weeks at the peak of the global pandemic, and the supplemental survey accrued responses after that to detect changes in opinions and circumstances. Nine hypothetical surgical scenarios were used to query neurosurgeons' opinion on the risk of postponement and the urgency to re-schedule the procedures. An acuity index was generated for each scenario, and this was used to rank the nine cases. RESULTS: There were 494 respondents to the principal survey from 60 countries. 258 (52.5%) reported that all elective cases and clinics have been shut down by their main hospital. A total of 226 respondents (46.1%) reported that their operative volume had dropped more than 50%. For the countries most affected by COVID-19, this proportion was 54.7%. There was a high degree of agreement among our respondents that fast-evolving neuro-oncological cases are non-emergent cases that nonetheless have the highest risk in postponement, and selected vascular cases may have high acuity as well. CONCLUSION: We report on the impact of COVID-19 on neurosurgeons around the world. From their ranking of the nine case scenarios, we deduced a strategic scheme that can serve as a guideline to triage non-emergent neurosurgical procedures during the pandemic. With it, hopefully, neurosurgeons can continue to serve their patients without endangering them either neurologically or risking their exposure to the deadly virus.","Jean, Walter C; Ironside, Natasha T; Sack, Kenneth D; Felbaum, Daniel R; Syed, Hasan R",Acta Neurochir (Wien),,114

COVID-19 is caused by a novel virus SARS-CoV2 (2019-nCoV), against which there is currently no vaccine available; and current antiviral therapies have failed, causing a very high mortality rate. Drug repurposing i.e. utilizing an approved drug for different indication, offers a time- and cost-efficient alternative for making new therapies available to patients. Although there are several reports presenting novel approaches to treat COVID-19, still an attentive review of previous scientific literature is essential to overcome their failure to exhibit efficacy. There is an urgent need to provide a comprehensive outlook toward utilizing drug repurposing as a tool for discovery of new therapies against COVID-19. In this article, we aim to provide a to-the-point review of current literature regarding efficacy of repurposed drugs against COVID-19 and other respiratory infections caused by coronaviruses. We have briefly discussed COVID-19 epidemiology, and then have discussed drug repurposing approaches and examples, specific to respiratory viruses.

(Special Issue: Therapeutic targets and pharmacological treatment of COVID-19.)",2020,"INTRODUCTION: With France one of the European countries most strongly affected by COVID-19 in the spring of 2020, French authorities imposed a nationwide lockdown for 8 weeks (March 17-May 10). This study explored the perception of the adult population about the need for-and access to-psychological support from health care professionals (HCP) in response to concerns about the psychological needs during lockdown. MATERIAL AND METHOD: This online cross-sectional survey of a representative sample of the adult general population of mainland France (N = 2,003) took place during the last four days of the French lockdown (May 7-10, 2020). RESULTS: One in eight respondents (12.2%) perceived a need for psychological support from an HCP during the lockdown; most had symptoms of depression and/or anxiety of at least moderate intensity. Only a third (29.8%, 3.6% of the entire sample) actually obtained this support. Factors associated with this perceived need included: age under 35, economic difficulties due to lockdown, pre-lockdown use of psychological support, infection with COVID-19, serious worries about becoming infected, and heavy media use to obtain information about the disease. Among those who perceived a need for psychological support, the elderly were the most likely not to consult an HCP. People aged 35-64, those with high income, and those seriously worried about developing COVID-19 were the most likely to forgo seeking access to care because of their fear of infection by the coronavirus-2019. CONCLUSION: The perceived need for psychological support from an HCP and access to it appeared to be strongly associated with COVID-19 exposure factor. More research about this association is needed to improve the health authorities' understanding of the population's psychological needs in this situation and to enhance HCPs' abilities to meet them. In particular, further research of its specific impact on youth is necessary.","Alleaume, Caroline; Verger, Pierre; Peretti-Watel, Patrick",PLoS One,,114

Healthcare workers in Singapore working in high-risk areas were mandated to wear personal protective equipment (PPE) such as N95 face mask and protective eyewear while attending to patients. OBJECTIVES: We sought to determine the risk factors associated with the development of de novo PPE-associated headaches as well as the perceived impact of these headaches on their personal health and work performance. The impact of COVID-19 on pre-existing headache disorders was also investigated. METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study among healthcare workers at our tertiary institution who were working in high-risk hospital areas during COVID-19. All respondents completed a self-administered questionnaire. RESULTS: A total of 158 healthcare workers participated in the study. Majority [126/158 (77.8%)] were aged 21-35 years. Participants included nurses [102/158 (64.6%)], doctors [51/158 (32.3%)], and paramedical staff [5/158 (3.2%)]. Pre-existing primary headache diagnosis was present in about a third [46/158 (29.1%)] of respondents. Those based at the emergency department had higher average daily duration of combined PPE exposure compared to those working in isolation wards [7.0 (SD 2.2) vs 5.2 (SD 2.4) hours, P < .0001] or medical ICU [7.0 (SD 2.2) vs 2.2 (SD 0.41) hours, P < .0001].

A pre-existing primary headache diagnosis (OR = 4.20, 95% CI 1.48-15.40; P = .030) and combined PPE usage for >4 hours per day (OR 3.91, 95% CI 1.35-11.31; P = .012) were independently associated with de novo PPE-associated headaches. Since COVID-19 outbreak, 42/46 (91.3%) of respondents with pre-existing headache diagnosis either ""agreed"" or ""strongly agreed"" that the increased PPE usage had affected the control of their background headaches, which affected their level of work performance. CONCLUSION: Most healthcare workers develop de novo PPE-associated headaches or exacerbation of their pre-existing headache disorders.","Ong, Jonathan J Y; Bharatendu, Chandra; Goh, Yihui; Tang, Jonathan Z Y; Sooi, Kenneth W X; Tan, Yi Lin; Tan, Benjamin Y Q; Teoh, Hock-Luen; Ong, Shi T; Allen, David M; Sharma, Vijay K",Headache,,114
223585,Clinical Research Redirection and Optimization During a Pandemic,2021,"Exposure to perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) has been associated with the occurrence of thyroid disease in some epidemiologic studies. We hypothesized that in a specific epidemiologic study based on the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, the association of clinical thyroid disease with serum concentration of PFOA and PFOS was due to reverse causality. Thyroid hormone affects glomerular filtration, which in turn affects excretion of PFOA and PFOS. We evaluated this by linking a model of thyroid disease status over the lifetime to a physiologically based pharmacokinetic model of PFOA and PFOS. Using Monte Carlo methods, we simulated the target study population and analyzed the data using multivariable logistic regression. The target and simulated populations were similar with respect to age, estimated glomerular filtration rate, serum concentrations of PFOA and PFOS, and prevalence of clinical thyroid disease. The analysis showed little or no evidence of bias from the hypothesized mechanism. The largest bias was for the fourth quartile of PFOA in females, with an odds ratio of 0.93 (95% CI, 0.90, 0.97). The reported odds ratio of clinical thyroid disease for this group was 1.63 (1.07, 2.47), and if it were corrected for the bias would have been 1.74 (1.14, 2.65).

228259,Elaboration of a new synovial predictive score of septic origin for acute arthritis on the native joint (RESAS),2020,"BACKGROUND: The primary method of surveillance for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 is with nasopharyngeal swabs. Given the significant demand for nasopharyngeal swabs, a large number of previously untrained and unfamiliar staff are now performing this test. It was noted that there was significant heterogeneity in instructions for performing nasopharyngeal swabs in Canada, in contrast to the guidance provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO). The objective of this study was to review the instructions provided across Canada and contrast them to those of the CDC and PAHO. METHODS: A standard series of steps for nasopharyngeal swab performance was outlined based on the CDC, PAHO, and New England Journal of Medicine instructions. A comprehensive search was performed in August 2020 to identify nasopharyngeal swab guidelines provided by public health in the provinces and territories of Canada. Regional health authority guidance was also collected. Instructions provided were contrasted against the standardized steps. RESULTS: Instructions were identified for all provinces and territories, and for 81 regional health authorities. From the provincial and territorial guidelines, 10/13 (77%) cleared the nasal passages before swab insertion, 11/13 (85%) tilted the patient's head back slightly, 12/13 (92%) inserted the swab parallel to the palate, but only 3/13 (23%) inserted the swab to at least a depth of two-thirds the distance between the patient's nose and ear. A clear majority (81%) of regional health authority guidelines followed their respective provincial guidelines. For depth of insertion, Quebec provided a pictogram but no distance or technique for estimation. Six provinces and territories - Northwest Territories, Nunavut, Ontario, Saskatchewan, Prince Edward Island and Alberta - recommended 4 cm or one-half the distance from nostrils to ear. British Columbia and Manitoba recommended a 7 cm depth of insertion. Nova Scotia recommended one-half to two-thirds the distance from nose to ear. Lastly, Newfoundland, New Brunswick and the Yukon recommended an insertion from nose to the external ear canal. CONCLUSION: There is significant heterogeneity in guidance for nasopharyngeal swab performance across Canada. The instructions provided by the majority of provinces and territories in Canada would not be effective in reaching the nasopharynx.","Hiebert, Nole M; Chen, Breanna Ashley; Sowerby, Leigh J",J Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,,114

229307,Effects of policies and containment measures on control of COVID19 epidemic in Chongqing,2020,"While local anthropogenic emission sources contribute largely to deteriorate metro air quality, long range transport can also play a significant role in influencing levels of pollutants, particularly carbon monoxide (CO) that has a relatively long life span. A nationwide lockdown of two months imposed across India amid COVID-19 led to a dramatic decline in major sources of emissions except for household, mainly from cooking. This initially led to declined levels of CO in two of the largest megacities of India, Delhi and Mumbai under stable weather conditions, followed by a distinctly different variability under the influence of prevailing mesoscale circulation. We hereby trace the sources of CO from local emissions to transport pathways and interpret the observed variability in CO using the interactive WRF-Chem model and back trajectory analysis. For this purpose, COVID-19 emission inventory of CO has been estimated. Model results indicate a significant contribution from externally generated CO in Delhi from surrounding regions and an unusual peak on 17th May amid lockdown due to long range transport from the source region of biofuel emissions in central India. However, the oceanic winds played a larger role in keeping CO levels in check in a coastal megacity Mumbai which otherwise has high CO emissions from household sources due to a larger share of urban slums. Keeping track of evolving carbon-intensive pathways can help inform government responses to the COVID-19 pandemic to prioritize controls of emissions sources.","Beig, Gufran; Korhale, Nikhil; Rathod, Aditi; Maji, Sujit; Sahu, Saroj K; Dole, Shruti; Latha, R; Murthy, B S",Environ Pollut,,114
229537,Recommendations for Testing and Treating Outpatient Cancer Patients in the Era of COVID-19,2020,"Avant que le rôle bénéfique de la dexaméthasone ne soit établi au cours de l'infection au COVID-19 dans une large étude randomisée anglaise (RECOVERY) en juillet 2020, plusieurs voies thérapeutiques alternatives ont été testées, notamment le tocilizumab (TCZ), un inhibiteur de la voie de signalisation du récepteur de l'interleukine-6. L'hétérogénéité des résultats concernant l'efficacité du TCZ pourrait être expliquée par des différences dans le timing d'injection : défavorable si trop précoce ou inefficace si trop tardive. Le but de ce travail était d'étudier l'impact du délai d'injection de TCZ–défini depuis le début des symptômes (SF0) jusqu'à la perfusion de TCZ (J0)–sur la mortalité au cours de l'infection au COVID-19. Étude multicentrique rétrospective ayant inclus des patients COVID-19 avec atteinte modérée à sévère–score OMS 5 à 6–avec oxygénodépendance ≥ 4 L/min et CRP &gt; 50 mg/L, traités de manière compassionnelle par TCZ 8 mg/kg IV en plus des soins usuels, lors du premier pic épidémique en France, avant l'ouverture de l'essai randomisé CORIMUNO-TOCI. Les critères d'exclusion étaient une contre-indication au TCZ, une hospitalisation en soins intensifs avant ou dans les 24 heures après TCZ ou une limitation thérapeutique. Les facteurs de risque de mortalité au cours de l'infection au COVID-19 modérée ou sévère après TCZ ont été analysés selon des modèles multivariés de régression logistique et de Cox. Les facteurs de risque potentiels étaient les variables avec p &lt; 0,30 en analyse univariée parmi âge, sexe, obésité, comorbidités, période SF0–J0, débit O2 à l'admission, sévérité des lésions scanographiques, CRP à J0 et traitement par corticoïdes. L'analyse de survie a été réalisée en utilisant le jour d'hospitalisation comme début de suivi, et des courbes de survie ajustées conditionnelles ont été construites à l'aide d'un modèle de Cox. Entre le 17 mars et le 15 avril 2020, 97 patients (âge moyen 68 ans et 80 % hommes) ont reçu du TCZ pour une pneumonie modérée à sévère à COVID-19 dans 8 hôpitaux français. 0, 1 ou &gt; 1 comorbité était relevée chez 23 %, 35 % et 42 % des patients, respectivement. À J0 (administration du TCZ), le débit moyen d'O2 était de 9,6 ± 4 L/min, la fréquence respiratoire de 30 ± 8/min et le taux moyen de CRP de 158 ± 78 mg/L. Le scanner thoracique retrouvait une atteinte parenchymateuse &gt; 50 % chez 39 (45 %) patients. Les glucocorticoïdes étaient utilisés chez 34 (35 %) patients. À J10, 35 (44 %) patients étaient sevrés d'O2, 26 (27 %) étaient sortis d'hospitalisation, 54 (55 %) étaient toujours hospitalisés dont 7 en réanimation, et 17 (18 %) étaient décédés. Le délai moyen de sevrage en O2 était de 15 jours ± 12 et la durée moyenne d'hospitalisation de 16 jours ± 13. À 1 mois du traitement par TCZ, la mortalité globale était de 25 %. La survie globale des patients ayant reçu le TCZ dans les 7 premiers jours après SF0 n'était pas différente de celle des patients ayant reçu le TCZ 8 à 10 jours et &gt; 11 jours après SF0. De même, les délais de survie n'étaient pas associés à la période SF0–J0. Un débit d'O2 à J0 &gt; 12 L/min versus 4-8L/min (OR 9,73, IC à 95 % [2,10-45,12] ;HR 5,20, IC à 95 % [1,62–16,67]) était significativement associée au décès chez les patients traités par TCZ, alors que le taux de CRP à J0 ne l'était pas. Dans cette étude de vraie vie rapportant l'utilisation compassionnelle du TCZ chez des patients atteints de formes modérées à sévères de COVID-19 hospitalisés hors soins intensifs, le délai de perfusion du TCZ n'avait pas d'impact sur la survie des patients contrairement au débit d'O2 à l'admission. En outre, l'existence d'un odds ratio de près de 10 pour des débits d'O2 différents chez des patients tous classés OMS 5 suggère de créer des sous-groupes de gravité croissante (4-8 L/min, 9-11 L/min, 12-15 L/min) afin d'homogénéiser les populations étudiées. Au moment de soumettre c t abstract, les derniers résultats de l'étude Recovery diffusés en prépublication annoncent une réduction de mortalité de 14 % sous TCZ chez les patients hospitalisés pour Covid-19.

231231,"BTK Inhibitors in Cancer Patients with COVID-19: ""The Winner Will be the One Who Controls That Chaos"" (Napoleon Bonaparte)",2020,"Recently the entire world is witnessing the pandemic outbreak of COVID 19, which creates havoc in the healthcare industry. Error tolerance may lead to death threats for the patient in the healthcare system. However, practically the healthcare industry faces many manual error incidences, inadequate staffing, aging population, etc. These challenges will increase the stress level and disturbs the psychological as well as physical health of the healthcare practitioner. Internet of things (IoT) technique is adept to tackle such outbreaks by providing complete digitization of healthcare systems. However, IoT application deployment comes with many security threats and attacks challenges. Here it is worth mentioning that to implement a robust security solution, the comprehensive analysis of attack must carry out. This paper contributes by analyzing two preeminent attacks, the Denial of service (DoS) and version Number attack on the healthcare system. DoS rapidly destroy the network whereas version number haltingly takes control of the network. The paper further critically analyzes the performance and severity of these two attacks based on discrete parameters like routing metric, power consumption, number of packets received, number of expected transmissions, beacon interval, and proposes the robust solution. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Ambarkar, S.

231232,"BTK Inhibitors in Cancer Patients with COVID-19: ""The Winner Will be the One Who Controls That Chaos"" (Napoleon Bonaparte)",2020,"BACKGROUND: A renal biopsy is needed to define active inflammatory infiltration and guide therapeutic management in drug-induced acute tubulointerstitial nephritis (D-ATIN). However, factors such as various contraindications, refusal of informed consent and limited technical support may stop the biopsy process. It is thus of great importance to explore approaches that could deduce probable pathologic changes. METHODS: A total of 81 biopsy-proven D-ATIN patients were enrolled from a prospective cohort of ATIN patients at Peking University First Hospital. The systemic inflammation score (SIS) was developed based on the CRP and ESR levels at biopsy, and patients were divided into high-SIS, median-SIS, and low-SIS groups. The demographic data, clinicopathologic features, and renal outcomes were compared. RESULTS: The SIS was positively correlated with inflammatory cell infiltration and was inversely correlated with interstitial fibrosis. The number of interstitial inflammatory cells increased significantly with increasing SISs. The proportions of neutrophils and plasma cells were the highest in the high-SIS group compared with the other two groups. Prednisone (30-40 mg/day) was prescribed in all patients. The high-SIS group tended to have more favorable renal restoration than the other two groups. By 12 months postbiopsy, a decreased eGFR (< 60 mL/min/1.73 m2) was observed in 66.7% of medium-SIS patients, 32.4% of high-SIS patients, and 30.4% of low-SIS patients. CONCLUSION: The SIS was positively correlated with active tubulointerstitial inflammation and therefore could help to aid therapeutic decisions in D-ATIN.","Zheng, Xi-Zi; Gu, Yang-Hui; Su, Tao; Zhou, Xu-Jie; Huang, Jun-Wen; Sun, Ping-Ping; Jia, Yan; Xu, Da-Min; Wang, Su-Xia; Liu, Gang; Yang, Li",BMC Nephrol,,114

The participants consisted of 960 individuals, including 663 females (69.1%) and 297 males (30.9%). The age of the participants ranged between 18 and 76 (29.74 ± 9.64). As a result of the correlation analysis, a positive relationship was found between fear of COVID-19 and intolerance of uncertainty, depression, anxiety, and stress, and a negative relationship was determined between the fear of COVID-19 and positivity. The result of the analysis for the study model indicated that there was a mediating role of intolerance of uncertainty, depression, anxiety, and stress in the relationship between the fear of COVID-19 and positivity. Eliminating uncertainty from the fear of COVID-19 will contribute to reducing depression, anxiety and stress, and increasing positivity.","Bakioglu, Fuad; Korkmaz, Ozan; Ercan, Hülya",Int J Ment Health Addict,,114
232004,Cardiac involvement in consecutive elite athletes recovered from Covid-19: A magnetic resonance study,2021,"Somos Dign@s, a collective, composed by students, professors, and human rights activists, concerned about the crisis of human rights and civil liberties in Puerto Rico designed a successful national campaign for human rights known as: ""Trayecto Dignidad"" or ""The Journey toward Dignity."" This educational campaign emulated the Freedom Riders initiative of the 1960s. Throughout this article, we discuss the participatory action research (PAR) methodology designed by Somos Dign@s which frames the work of our Trayecto Dignidad campaign. Our methodology is based on the theoretical approaches of De Sousa-Santos (2002) and his conceptualization of human rights as having to rise through a process of ""Globalization from below""; that is, a process of globalization that allows oppressed classes to advocate for their human rights. Five campaigns have been implemented since 2011. Some results have shown the need: (1) to continue educating about human and civil rights; (2) to educate and reinforce public policies to address discrimination based on race, social class, and gender particularly in the work setting; (3) to universalize health services; (4) to conduct a debt audit and advocate for the right of people of Puerto Rico to self-determination (UN Resolution 1514 XV); and (5) to integrate a public policy education based on gender perspective on schools and declare the State of Emergency for the femicides.","Rivera-Díaz, Marinilda; Correa-Luna, Juan; Álamo-Rodríguez, Natalie M; Barreto-Cortés, Esterla; Paz-Zayas, Valerie; Martínez-Avilés, María de Lourdes; Muñoz-Sosa, Nylca; López-Ortiz, Mabel T; Ortiz-Ortiz, Yamil; Pizarro-Claudio, Doris; Reyes-Gil, Yanira; Tejada-Duarte, Randy",J Hum Rights Soc Work,,114
232005,Cardiac involvement in consecutive elite athletes recovered from Covid-19: A magnetic resonance study,2021,"Some participants of the public debate have argued that the world before and after the coronavirus crisis will look fundamentally different. An underlying assumption is that this crisis will alter public opinion in such a way that it leads to profound societal and political change. Scholarship suggests that while some policy preferences are quite volatile and prone to change under the influence of crises, core values formed during childhood are likely to remain stable. In this article, we test stability or change of a well-selected set of opinions and values before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. We rely on a unique longitudinal panel study whereby the Dutch fieldwork of the European Values Study 2017 web survey serves as a baseline; respondents were re-approached in May 2020. The findings indicate that values remain largely stable. However, there is an increase in political support, confirming the so-called rally effect. We conclude our manuscript with a response to the futurists expecting changes in public opinion because of the coronavirus crisis.","Reeskens, Tim; Muis, Quita; Sieben, Inge; Vandecasteele, Leen; Luijkx, Ruud; Halman, Loek",Eur.

232336,Clinical and laboratory features of hypercoagulability in COVID-19 and other respiratory viral infections amongst predominantly younger adults with few comorbidities,2021,"We report on data and debriefing observations in the context of an immersive simulation conducted to (a) train clinicians and (b) test new protocols and kits, developed in table-top exercises without prior clinical experience to fit anticipated clinical encounters in the setting of the rapidly expanding COVID-19 pandemic. We simulated scenarios with particular relevance for anesthesiology, perioperative and critical care, including (1) cardiac arrest, (2) emergency airway management, (3) tele-instruction for remote guidance and supervision, and (4) transporting an intubated patient. Using a grounded theory approach, three authors (MHA, DLR, EHS) developed emergent themes. First alone and then together, we sought consensus in uncovering overarching themes and constructs from the debriefings. We thus performed an informal qualitative thematic analysis based in a critical realist epistemological position - the understanding that our findings, while real, are affected by situational variables and the observer's perspective[1,2]. We compared data from videos and triangulated the data by member checking. All participants and course instructors volunteered to participate in this educational project and contributed as co-authors to this manuscript. During debriefing, we applied crisis resource management concepts including situation awareness, prioritization of tasks, and clear communication practices, conducting the debriefing with emphasis on current TeamStepps 2.0 terminology and concepts. [3,4] In addition, we re-evaluated formerly familiar processes, as shortcomings of protocols, kits, and interdisciplinary cooperation became apparent. The data provide detailed observations on how immersive simulation and debriefing among peers mitigated the unfamiliarity of individual clinicians and the organization at large with the demands of an unprecedented healthcare crisis. We also observed and report on the anxiety caused by resource constraints, risk to clinicians in the face of limited personal equipment, and the overall uncertainty surrounding COVID-19. We began to summarize, interpret, critique, and discuss our data and debriefing observations in a rapid co-publication in the Journal of Clinical Anesthesia.

232954,Caring Cancer Patients While Living With COVID-19: An Experience of a Tertiary Cancer Care Center,2020,"COVID-19 spread rapidly throughout the world, leading most of the affected countries to close their borders and to establish lockdown in different versions. Three months after the pandemic started, many countries are making decisions tending to relax the lockdown, although without a vaccine or treatment capable of confronting SARS-CoV-2 infection, the situation could be reversed at any time. In this context, the aim of this work was to propose a decision algorithm that will allow the optimization of asymptomatic case detections and the strategic management of quarantine to prevent the spread of the virus and to allow a new controlled normality. This tentative proposal was developed to optimize the number of tests for the detection of SARS-CoV-2, analyzing composite samples (group analysis) that combine individual ones taken from different people that integrate the group of interest. Groups were defined according to their critical role in society and/or because they belong to vulnerable groups. The algorithm takes into account the following variables: group priority, number of members within the group, intragroup and intergroup contact, contact vulnerability due to the activity, and time elapsed since last testing. The proposed tool rationally allows to establish a priority order to assess critical groups in society. Furthermore, this tool could optimize the available resources, reducing the impact on a region's health, society, and economy.","Rivero, Mariano; Gutiérrez-Cacciabue, Dolores; Rajal, Verónica Beatriz; Irazusta, Verónica Patricia",Rev. argent. microbiol,,114
233447,An Ounce of Prevention is Worth a Pound of Cure: US Cues for a Revision of the EU Market Abuse Regulation (preprint),2020,"We propose a dynamical model for describing the spread of epidemics. This model is an extension of the SIQR (susceptible-infected-quarantined-recovered) and SIRP (susceptible-infected-recovered-pathogen) models used earlier to describe various scenarios of epidemic spreading. As compared to the basic SIR model, our model takes into account two possible routes of contagion transmission: direct from the infected compartment to the susceptible compartment and indirect via some intermediate medium or fomites. Transmission rates are estimated in terms of average distances between the individuals in selected social environments and characteristic time spans for which the individuals stay in each of these environments. We also introduce a collective economic resource associated with the average amount of money or income per individual to describe the socioeconomic interplay between the spreading process and the resource available to infected individuals. The epidemic-resource coupling is supposed to be of activation type, with the recovery rate governed by the Arrhenius-like law. Our model brings an advantage of building various control strategies to mitigate the effect of epidemic and can be applied, in particular, to modeling the spread of COVID-19.","Gandzha, I.

234776,"Think national, act local: the role of the physician and the RCP",2020,"In response to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) has been extensively used, and discarded PPE has been observed in many different environments, including on tourist beaches. Here we examined the distribution and densities of face masks on some of the main tourist beaches in Chile, and we monitored their daily accumulation rates on one beach in northern-central Chile. Face masks were found on beaches across the country with average densities of 0.006 ± 0.002 (mean ± se) face masks m−2, which are higher than densities reported on Peruvian beaches, but lower than those on some Kenyan beaches. Face masks were also found on more remote beaches and rocky shores in northern-central Chile. Daily accumulation rates on one tourist beach were low during austral fall/winter (0.2 face masks km−1 d−1), but were over ten times higher during austral summer (3.0 face masks km−1 d−1). These values are substantially higher than daily accumulation rates reported from urban streets, which is most likely due to the high densities of beach visitors during the summer tourist season. COVID-19 related infrastructure (signposts and PPE waste bins) was present on most beaches, but while signposts about personal protection were abundant, there were few signposts about littering, and only one of the 12 beaches sampled for COVID infrastructure had a signpost that offered recommendations about the proper disposal of used face masks. Specific waste bins for PPE waste were only available at three beaches. Based on these findings it is recommended to provide sufficient PPE-related signs and waste bins, establish general and strict waste disposal regulations, and to improve enforcement. Educational campaigns should aim at recommending proper use and disposal of face masks, litter prevention, reduction of single-use waste and enhanced pro-environmental behaviors. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Thiel, M.; de Veer, D.; Espinoza-Fuenzalida, N.

In order to ensure the ability to detect breaks at sample endpoints, we thoroughly study weighted CUSUM statistics, analysing the asymptotics for virtually all possible weighing schemes, including the standardised CUSUM process (for which we derive a Darling-Erdos theorem) and even heavier weights (studying the so-called R\'enyi statistics). Our results are valid irrespective of whether the sequence is stationary or not, and no prior knowledge of stationarity or lack thereof is required. Technically, our results require strong approximations which, in the nonstationary case, are entirely new. Similarly, we allow for heteroskedasticity of unknown form in both the error term and in the stochastic part of the autoregressive coefficient, proposing a family of test statistics which are robust to heteroskedasticity, without requiring any prior knowledge as to the presence or type thereof. Simulations show that our procedures work very well in finite samples.

COVID-19 emerged in Wuhan, Hubei province of China, in early December 2019 and is now considered a pandemic. This study aimed to investigate the airborne transmission of COVID-19 and the role of face mask to prevent it. METHODS: A systematic search for English-language literature was done via PUBMED/Medline and Google Scholar up to October 2020. There was two search strategy; for airborne transmission and the role of face mask for prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Based on a fixed and random effects model, the RR and 95% CI were used to evaluate the combined risk. This meta-analysis followed Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) Guidelines. RESULTS: After eligibility assessment, four articles with a total of 7688 participants were included in this meta-analysis. The result of this meta-analysis has shown significant reduction in infection with face mask use; the pooled RR (95%CI) was 0.12 [0.06, 0.27] (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: In conclusion, this meta-analysis suggests that there is association between face mask use and reduction of COVID-19. However, COVID-19 spreads primarily with contact routes and respiratory droplets, but its transmissibility has many mysteries yet and there is controversy about airborne transmission of COVID-19.","Tabatabaeizadeh, Seyed-Amir",Eur J Med Res,,114

Patient-doctor interactions may be disrupted and therefore need to be replaced by alternative effective communication methods. Purpose: To describe the preferences of cancer patients with respect to communication methods and the use of patient-accessible electronic health records (PAEHRs). To record the impact on cancer patients during the COVID-19 pandemic and the knowledge and attitude of the patients towards it. Patients and Methods: We created a self-administered electronic survey that was piloted and evaluated for its clinical relevance. Using convenient sampling methods, we surveyed the cancer patients in our Oncology Center. Results: We received 385 responses between April 15 and April 30, 2020. The preferred method for communication was a phone call with a 92% response rate followed by the electronic patient portal, mobile application, telemedicine and text message in 75%, 76%, 73%, and 72%, respectively. The majority (97%) preferred the use of PAEHRs for appointments, 95% for drug delivery and to view laboratory tests, and 92% in requesting medical reports. In our survey, 22% of patients with cancer reported that their medical cancer care had not been affected by COVID-19. They reported that trusted sources of information during COVID-19 included the Ministry of Health with 98% and doctors with 94%. Sixty-one percent know that they are more susceptible to COVID-19 infection and 91% of respondents supported the notion of digital transformation in the caring of cancer patients. Conclusion: Our study revealed a general acceptance of patients to telecommunication as substitute to in-person interaction with their physicians.

238399,Fact or Fiction: Verifying Scientific Claims,2020-04-30,"The present work describes the preparation of a new covalent organic polymer (COP) and its application as a hetero support for diaryl selenides synthesis. A nitrogen rich COP (CGP) has been synthesized via SNAr reaction of cyanuric chloride with guanidinium hydrochloride. The successful confinement of COP with Ni nanoparticles through post-synthetic transformations (Ni@CGP) provides excellent catalytic activity for the transformation of aryl halides into diaryl selenides using elemental selenium powder. The synthetic transformations are well confirmed using various modern analytical and spectroscopic techniques which reveal high chemical and thermal durability. The N-rich framework of CGP fortifies the confinement of Ni NPs. Ni@CGP provides an efficient approach for diaryl selenides synthesis using a very cheap selenating reagent under water benign solvent conditions (DMSO : H2O) at room temperature with high reusability. Significantly, our work not only contributes the opportunity for developing economical and effective non-noble metal decorated COPs as heterogeneous catalysts, but also delivers an efficient approach to produce industrially important C-Se coupling products.","Yadav, Deepika; Dixit, A K; Raghothama, S; Awasthi, Satish Kumar",,,114
239004,Demographic attributes of COVID-19 patients in an infectious disease center of Nigeria,2021,"Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) infection and its severity can be explained by the concentration of glycosylated severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) viral particles in the lung epithelium, the concentration of glycosylated angiotensin-converting enzyme receptor 2 (ACE2) in the lung epithelium, and the degree and control of the pulmonary immune response to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein at approximately day 8 to 10 after symptom onset, which may be related to both. Binding of ACE2 by SARS-CoV-2 in COVID-19 also suggests that prolonged uncontrolled hyperglycemia, and not just a history of diabetes mellitus, may be important in the pathogenesis of the disease. It is tempting to consider that the same mechanism acts in COVID-19 as in SARS, where an overactive macrophage M1 inflammatory response, as neutralizing antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein form at day 7 to 10, results in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in susceptible patients. It also allows consideration of agents, such as hydroxychloroquine, which may interfere with this overly brisk macrophage inflammatory response and perhaps influence the course of the disease, in particular, those that blunt but do not completely abrogate the M1 to M2 balance in macrophage polarization, as well as viral load, which in SARS appears to be temporally related to the onset of ARDS.","Brufsky, Adam",J Med Virol,,114
239021,Intraoral human herpes viruses detectable by PCR in majority of patients,2020,"BACKGROUND: Studies of consequences of sickness absence such as health and well-being have been rare whereas risk factors for sickness absence have been studied extensively. This study assumed the consequences of sickness absence would differ by diagnostic group or by patient care type. The aim was to investigate sickness absence due to various diagnosis groups as a predictor for subsequent inpatient- and specialized outpatient care while controlling for familial confounding. METHODS: We utilized the register data of 69,552 twin individuals between 16 and 80 years of age (48% women). The first incident sickness absence spell, from baseline year 2005, including diagnosis of sickness absence was our primary exposure of interest and we followed them until the first incident inpatient- and specialized outpatient care episode with main diagnosis code or until 31.12.2013. RESULTS: A total of 7464 incident sickness absence spells took place (11%), 42% had inpatient care and 83% specialized outpatient care (mean follow-up time 3.2 years, SD 3.1 years). All the main sickness absence diagnosis groups were associated with increased risk of future care in comparison to no sickness absence. Controlling for confounders attenuated the associations in magnitude but with retaining direction, and we could not confirm an effect of familial factors. CONCLUSIONS: Sickness absence predicts both inpatient- and specialized outpatient care and the association is universal across diagnosis groups. The lower survival time and incidence rates of inpatient than specialized outpatient care point towards severity of diseases assumption. This finding was also universal across sickness absence diagnosis groups.","Ropponen, Annina; Wang, Mo; Narusyte, Jurgita; Kärkkäinen, Sanna; Blom, Victoria; Svedberg, Pia",BMC Public Health,,114
239729,Excipients as Potential Agents of Anaphylaxis in Vaccines: Analyzing the Formulations of Currently Authorized COVID-19 Vaccines,2021,"INTRODUCTION: SARS-CoV-2, coronavirus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), was first detected in Spain on 31 January 2020. On 14 March 2020, a state of emergency was declared in Spain in a bid to control the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic in the country. The aim of our study is to analyse the impact on emergency medicine attendance after the national lockdown, as well as the clinical presentation and the management of patients with suspected COVID-19 in the Paediatric Emergency Department. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This retrospective observational study included children and adolescents under the age of 18, attended in our Paediatric Emergency Department during the period March 14 to April 17, 2020. RESULTS: A total of 1,666 patients were attended during the study period, 65.4% less than in the same period of 2019. Just over half (51.2%) were males, and mean age was 5.4 years. In triage, 39.9% were high priority levels, 6.5% more than 2019. Most frequent reasons for consultation at the Paediatric Emergency Department were fever (26.5%), respiratory symptoms (16.1%), and trauma (15.2%). A total of 218 patients (13%) received a diagnosis of possible COVID-19, with SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed in 18.4%, and 23.8% (52/218) were hospitalised. At discharge, 44% (96/218) were diagnosed with lower, and 33.9% (74/218) with upper respiratory infection. CONCLUSIONS: During the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, the demand for urgent paediatric care decreased, with the proportion of cases with high priority triage levels increasing. Most of the patients with suspected or microbiological confirmation of COVID-19 had mild respiratory symptoms.","Molina Gutiérrez, Miguel Ángel; Ruiz Domínguez, José Antonio; Bueno Barriocanal, Marta; de Miguel Lavisier, Begoña; López López, Rosario; Martín Sánchez, Julia; de Ceano-Vivas la Calle, María",An Pediatr (Barc),,114

Our aim was to report an extremely rare two cases of primary malignant melanoma of the spine one of them is sacral melanoma which represents the second reported case in the literature and to conduct a systematic review of the relevant literature. METHODS: The diagnosis and management of these cases were retrospectively reviewed. Using the PRISMA guideline, we conducted a systematic review of the literature to analyze different management strategies and the prognosis of such pathology. RESULTS: All two patients were operated on, and received gross total removal of their tumors, with extended follow up for tumor recurrences. One of the cases involved a sacral tumor, which was resected without adjuvant therapy. The other one was seen by oncology and received post-operative chemo- and radio- therapy. In addition to the aforementioned cases, we present a comprehensive review of the literature on PSM from 1950 to the present, demonstrating that PSM is a very rare tumor, with a limited counted number of cases reported worldwide. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, we report an exceedingly rare two cases of primary malignant melanoma of the spine. Early surgical intervention is key to the management of these rare and aggressive tumors.

240036,COVID-19 and Kawasaki disease in children,2020,"INTRODUCTION AND AIM: Non-invasive ventilation (NIV) and continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) have been widely employed to treat acute respiratory failure secondary to COVID-19 pneumonia, but their role in terms of efficacy and safety are still debated. The aim of this review was to analyse mortality and intubation rates in COVID-19 patients treated with NIV/CPAP. METHODS: Rapid review methodology was applied to include all the studies published since December-2019 until November-2020 with available data on in-hospital mortality in COVID-19 patients treated with NIV or CPAP. RESULTS: 23 manuscripts were included (4776 patients, 66% males, 46% with hypertension). 46% of patients received non-invasive respiratory support, of which 48.4% with CPAP, 46% with NIV, and 4% with either CPAP or NIV. Non-invasive respiratory support failed in 47.7% of patients, of which 26.5% were intubated and 40.9% died. In-hospital mortality was higher in patients treated with NIV compared with CPAP (35.1% vs. 22.2%). Complications were under-reported, but mostly not related to CPAP/NIV treatment. CONCLUSION: CPAP and NIV appear equally and frequently applied in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, but associated with high mortality. Robust evidence is urgently needed to confirm the clinical efficacy of non-invasive respiratory support in COVID-19-related ARDS.","Radovanovic, Dejan; Coppola, Silvia; Franceschi, Elisa; Gervasoni, Fabrizio; Duscio, Eleonora; Chiumello, Davide Alberto; Santus, Pierachille",J Crit Care,,114
241282,Therapeutic targeting of TMPRSS2 andACE2 as a potential strategy to combat COVID-19,2020,"The COVID-19 pandemic has stressed patients and healthcare givers alike and challenged our practice of antenatal care, including fetal diagnosis and therapy. This document aims to review relevant recent information to allow us to optimize prenatal care delivery. We discuss potential modifications to obstetric management and fetal procedures in SARS-CoV2-negative and SARS-CoV2-positive patients with fetal anomalies or disorders. Most fetal therapies are time sensitive and cannot be delayed. If personnel and resources are available, we should continue to offer procedures of proven benefit, acknowledging any fetal and maternal risks, including those to health care workers. There is, to date, minimal, unconfirmed evidence of spontaneous vertical transmission, though it may theoretically be increased with some procedures. Knowing a mother's preoperative SARS-CoV-2 status would enable us to avoid or defer certain procedures while she is contagious and to protect health care workers appropriately. Some fetal conditions may alternatively be managed neonatally. Counseling regarding fetal interventions which have a possibility of additional intra- or postoperative morbidity must be performed in the context of local resource availability. Procedures of unproven benefit should not be offered. We encourage participation in registries and trials that may help us to understand the impact of COVID-19 on pregnant women, their fetuses, and neonates.","Deprest, Jan; Choolani, Mahesh; Chervenak, Frank; Farmer, Diana; Lagrou, Katrien; Lopriore, Enrico; McCullough, Laurence; Olutoye, Olutoyin; Simpson, Lynn; Van Mieghem, Tim; Ryan, Greg",Fetal Diagn Ther,,114
241439,Nervous System Involvement in COVID-19: Results from a Retrospective Consecutive Neuroimaging Cohort,2020,"BACKGROUND: The recent COVID-19 outbreak has generated an unprecedented public health crisis, with millions of infections and hundreds of thousands of deaths worldwide. Using hospital-based or mortality data, several COVID-19 risk factors have been identified, but these may be confounded or biased. METHODS: Using SARS-CoV-2 infection test data (n = 4509 tests; 1325 positive) from Public Health England, linked to the UK Biobank study, we explored the contribution of demographic, social, health risk, medical and environmental factors to COVID-19 risk. We used multivariable and penalized logistic regression models for the risk of (i) being tested, (ii) testing positive/negative in the study population and, adopting a test negative design, (iii) the risk of testing positive within the tested population. RESULTS: In the fully adjusted model, variables independently associated with the risk of being tested for COVID-19 with odds ratio >1.05 were: male sex; Black ethnicity; social disadvantage (as measured by education, housing and income); occupation (healthcare worker, retired, unemployed); ever smoker; severely obese; comorbidities; and greater exposure to particulate matter (PM) 2.5 absorbance. Of these, only male sex, non-White ethnicity and lower educational attainment, and none of the comorbidities or health risk factors, were associated with testing positive among tested individuals. CONCLUSIONS: We adopted a careful and exhaustive approach within a large population-based cohort, which enabled us to triangulate evidence linking male sex, lower educational attainment and non-White ethnicity with the risk of COVID-19. The elucidation of the joint and independent effects of these factors is a high-priority area for further research to inform on the natural history of COVID-19.","Chadeau-Hyam, Marc; Bodinier, Barbara; Elliott, Joshua; Whitaker, Matthew D; Tzoulaki, Ioanna; Vermeulen, Roel; Kelly-Irving, Michelle; Delpierre, Cyrille; Elliott, Paul",Int. j. epidemiol,,114

With older and more medically vulnerable people tending to stay at home to avoid contracting the virus, it is unclear how the behavior of people with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) has changed. The aim of this study was to determine if delays in presentation and healthcare service delivery for AMI exist during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to the same period a year prior. Methods: In this single-center, retrospective study, we evaluated patients admitted with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) or non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) during early months of the COVID-19 pandemic (March 11, 2020 to April 20, 2020) compared to patients admitted with same diagnosis during the same period a year prior. Results: There were 30 and 62 patients who presented with NSTEMI in the pandemic and pre-pandemic eras, respectively. The median pain-to-door time was significantly larger during the pandemic compared to pre-pandemic era (1,885 (880, 5,732) vs. 606 (388, 944) min, P < 0.0001). There was a significant delay in door-to-reperfusion time during the pandemic with a median time of 332 (182, 581) vs. 194 (92, 329) min (P = 0.0371). There were 24 (80%) and 25 (42%) patients who presented after 12 h of pain onset in pandemic and pre-pandemic eras, respectively (P = 0.0006). There were 47 and 60 patients who presented with STEMI during the pandemic timeframe of study and pre-pandemic timeframe, respectively. The median pain-to-door time during the pandemic was significantly larger than that of the pre-pandemic (620 (255, 1,500) vs. 349 (146, 659) min, P = 0.0141). There were 22 (47%) and 14 (24%) patients who presented after 12 h of pain onset in the pandemic and pre-pandemic eras, respectively (P = 0.0127). There was not a significant delay in door-to-reperfusion time (P = 0.9833). There were no differences in in-hospital death, stroke, or length of hospitalization between early and late presenters, as well as between pandemic and pre-pandemic eras. Conclusions: In conclusion, this study found that patients waited significantly longer during the pandemic to seek medical treatment for AMI compared to before the pandemic, and that pandemic-specific protocols may delay revascularization for NSTEMI patients. These findings resulted in more than a threefold increase from the onset of symptoms to revascularization increasing the risks for future complications such as left ventricular dysfunction and cardiovascular death. Efforts should be made to increase patients' awareness regarding consequences of delayed presentation, and to find a balance between hospital evaluation strategies and goals of minimizing total ischemic time.","Aldujeli, Ali; Hamadeh, Anas; Briedis, Kasparas; Tecson, Kristen M; Rutland, Joshua; Krivickas, Zilvinas; Stiklioraitis, Simas; Briede, Kamilija; Aldujeili, Montazar; Unikas, Ramunas; Zaliaduonyte, Diana; Zaliunas, Remigijus; Vallabhan, Ravi C; McCullough, Peter A",Cardiol Res,,114
243565,Estimating the Efficiency Gain of Covariate-Adjusted Analyses in Future Clinical Trials Using External Data,2021-04-30,"There is currently increasing interest internationally in deploying robotic applications for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) testing, as these can help to reduce the risk of transmission of the virus to health care staff and patients. We provide an overview of key recent developments in this area. We argue that, although there is some potential for deploying robots to help with SARS-CoV-2 testing, the potential of patient-facing applications is likely to be limited. This is due to the high costs associated with patient-facing functionality, and risks of potentially adverse impacts on health care staff work practices and patient interactions. In contrast, back-end laboratory-based robots dealing with sample extraction and amplification, that effectively integrate with established processes, software, and interfaces to process samples, are much more likely to result in safety and efficiency gains. Consideration should therefore be given to deploying these at scale.","Cresswell, Kathrin; Ramalingam, Sandeep; Sheikh, Aziz",J Med Internet Res,,114

Secondary HLH includes infection- (eg viral/bacterial/fungal/parasitic) and non-infection- (eg collagen disease or malignancy) related diseases. Viral HLH is the major type among all age groups. Secondary viral HLH and primary HLH must be differentiated carefully because primary HLH can be associated with viral infection(s), and the outcome is dismal without a timely diagnosis and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-related HLH (EBV-HLH) is the most common type of viral HLH in childhood. For non-EBV-HLH, appropriate treatment of viral infection, followed by immunomodulatory agent(s) such as corticosteroids, intravenous immunoglobulin or cyclosporine A, is usually successful; however, recent SARS-CoV-2-related HLH may become life-threatening. EBV-HLH may occur heterogeneously associated with the primary infection, with chronic active EBV infection or with underlying primary HLH. Although immunomodulatory agent(s) are effective in the majority of EBV-HLH cases, management differs from that of non-EBV-HLH because severe and refractory cases may require etoposide-containing HLH-1994/2004 regimens or other experimental agents. The novel agent, emapalumab (an anti-IFN-Î³ monoclonal antibody) can be used to treat EBV-HLH cases to avoid the risk of secondary malignancy due to etoposide. Finally, HSCT is required for refractory EBV-HLH cases and can also be curative in some other cases.","Imashuku, Shinsaku; Morimoto, Akira; Ishii, Eiichi",Acta paediatr. scand,,114

248812,Fulminant myocarditis in the time of coronavirus,2020,"Since early March 2020, the COVID-19 epidemic across the United Kingdom has led to a range of social distancing policies, which resulted in changes to mobility across different regions. An understanding of how these policies impacted travel patterns over time and at different spatial scales is important for designing effective strategies, future pandemic planning and in providing broader insights on the population geography of the country. Crowd level data on mobile phone usage can be used as a proxy for population mobility patterns and provide a way of quantifying in near-real time the impact of social distancing measures on changes in mobility. Here we explore patterns of change in densities, domestic and international flows and co-location of Facebook users in the UK from March 2020 to March 2021. We find substantial heterogeneities across time and region, with large changes observed compared to pre-pandemic patterns. The impacts of periods of lockdown on distances travelled and flow volumes are evident, with each showing variations, but some significant reductions in co-location rates. Clear differences in multiple metrics of mobility are seen in central London compared to the rest of the UK, with each of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland showing significant deviations from England at times. Moreover, the impacts of rapid changes in rules on international travel to and from the UK are seen in substantial fluctuations in traveller volumes by destination. While questions remain about the representativeness of the Facebook data, previous studies have shown strong correspondence with census-based data and alternative mobility measures, suggesting that findings here are valuable for guiding strategies.","Shepherd, Harry E.R.; Atherden, Florence S.; Chan, Ho Man Theophilus; Loveridge, Alexandra; Tatem, Andrew J",,,114
248813,Fulminant myocarditis in the time of coronavirus,2020,"OBJECTIVE: The American Association for Geriatric Psychiatry (AAGP) Scholars Program was developed to recruit trainees into geriatric psychiatry fellowships and is considered a pipeline for fellowship recruitment. Nonetheless, the number of trainees entering geriatric psychiatry fellowship is declining, making it important to identify modifiable factors that may influence trainees' decisions to pursue fellowship. We analyzed survey data from Scholars Program participants to identify demographic characteristics, attitudes toward program components, and behaviors after the program that were independently associated with the decision to pursue fellowship. METHODS: Web-based surveys were distributed to all 289 former Scholars participants (2010-2018), whether or not they had completed geriatric psychiatry fellowships. We conducted a hierarchical binary logistic regression analysis to examine demographics, program components, and behaviors after the program associated with deciding to pursue geriatric psychiatry fellowship. RESULTS: Sixty-one percent of Scholars decided to pursue geriatric psychiatry fellowship. Attending more than one AAGP annual meeting (relative variance explained [RVE]â¯=â¯34.2%), maintaining membership in the AAGP (RVEâ¯=â¯28.2%), and rating the Scholars Program as important for meeting potential collaborators (RVEâ¯=â¯26.6%) explained the vast majority of variance in the decision to pursue geriatric psychiatry fellowship. CONCLUSION: Nearly two-thirds of Scholars Program participants decided to pursue geriatric psychiatry fellowship, suggesting the existing program is an effective fellowship recruitment pipeline.

BALB/c mice were infected by oral gavage with non-virulent D8 strain and challenged 45 days post-infection with virulent EGS or CH3 strains. Cytokine measurement was performed 2 days post-challenge in cell extracts of the small intestine and 2, 7, and 14 days post-challenge in serum. Virulence gene allele type of these strains was analyzed. Challenged mice survived by avoiding exacerbated inflammation and inhibiting the overproduction of cytokines. Local and systemic cytokine response in challenged mice was similar to chronic controls and quite distinct in mice acutely infected with the EGS or CH3 strains. Allelic combinations of the virulence genes ROP5/ROP18 was predictive of virulence in mice when tested in these T. gondii strains. Other allelic combinations of rhoptries and dense granules genes showed discrepancies.","Ladeia Costa, Julia Gatti; Pinto, Lorena Velozo; Araujo de Castro Baraviera, Ramon; Geiger, Stefan Michael; Silva Araújo, Marcio Sobreira; Martins Filho, Olindo Assis; Almeida Vitor, Ricardo Wagner",Exp Parasitol,,114

The author suggests that the medical education community must embrace any positive changes that come about as a result of the pandemic while continuing to systematically review the strengths and areas for improvement in the current transition to residency process.In its recommendations, InCUS provided a thoughtful set of action priorities and an effective process to work together, which can inform and guide the work ahead. The COVID-19 pandemic is dominating the educational and clinical environments and is now the biggest disruptor in all aspects of life, not just medical education. It is the responsibility of leaders in medical education to have a vision for and then implement an improved continuum of education that maintains the core values of the field and fits the health care delivery needs of today and the future.","Whelan, Alison J",Acad. med,,114
250085,Six-month follow-up of gut microbiota richness in patients with COVID-19,2021,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has caused radiotherapy resource pressures and led to increased risks for lung cancer patients and healthcare staff. An international group of experts in lung cancer radiotherapy established this practice recommendation pertaining to whether and how to adapt radiotherapy for lung cancer in the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: For this ESTRO & ASTRO endorsed project, 32 experts in lung cancer radiotherapy contributed to a modified Delphi consensus process. We assessed potential adaptations of radiotherapy in two pandemic scenarios. The first, an early pandemic scenario of risk mitigation, is characterized by an altered risk-benefit ratio of radiotherapy for lung cancer patients due to their increased susceptibility for severe COVID-19 infection, and minimization of patient travelling and exposure of radiotherapy staff. The second, a later pandemic scenario, is characterized by reduced radiotherapy resources requiring patient triage. Six common lung cancer cases were assessed for both scenarios: peripherally located stage I NSCLC, locally advanced NSCLC, postoperative radiotherapy after resection of pN2 NSCLC, thoracic radiotherapy and prophylactic cranial irradiation for limited stage SCLC and palliative thoracic radiotherapy for stage IV NSCLC. RESULTS: In a risk-mitigation pandemic scenario, efforts should be made not to compromise the prognosis of lung cancer patients by departing from guideline-recommended radiotherapy practice. In that same scenario, postponement or interruption of radiotherapy treatment of COVID-19 positive patients is generally recommended to avoid exposure of cancer patients and staff to an increased risk of COVID-19 infection. In a severe pandemic scenario characterized by reduced resources, if patients must be triaged, important factors for triage include potential for cure, relative benefit of radiation, life expectancy, and performance status. Case-specific consensus recommendations regarding multimodality treatment strategies and fractionation of radiotherapy are provided. CONCLUSION: This joint ESTRO-ASTRO practice recommendation established pragmatic and balanced consensus recommendations in common clinical scenarios of radiotherapy for lung cancer in order to address the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Guckenberger, Matthias; Belka, Claus; Bezjak, Andrea; Bradley, Jeffrey; Daly, Megan E; DeRuysscher, Dirk; Dziadziuszko, Rafal; Faivre-Finn, Corinne; Flentje, Michael; Gore, Elizabeth; Higgins, Kristin A; Iyengar, Puneeth; Kavanagh, Brian D; Kumar, Sameera; Le Pechoux, Cecile; Lievens, Yolande; Lindberg, Karin; McDonald, Fiona; Ramella, Sara; Rengan, Ramesh; Ricardi, Umberto; Rimner, Andreas; Rodrigues, George B; Schild, Steven E; Senan, Suresh; Simone Ii, Charles B; Slotman, Ben J; Stuschke, Martin; Videtic, Greg; Widder, Joachim; Yom, Sue S; Palma, David",Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys,,114

252424,ASO Author Reflections: Complex Cancer Surgery Mortality After 30 Days: An Opportunity for Improvement,2020,"ABSTRACT Many health workers in the Americas, especially women, have been victims of discrimination and different types of grievances during the COVID-19 pandemic. These brief reflections aim to make the problem visible, offer theoretical explanations and some recommendations. The pandemic constitutes a massive crisis that triggers fears and reassuring of diffuse anxieties, which often includes someone to blame. Healthcare workers have become circumstantial scapegoating targets. The inflicted attacks can be understood as reactive hate crimes since they are originated from an allegedly healthy person to an allegedly contaminated person. People seems to incur in a sanitary profiling process based on the health worker's uniform. However, these expressions of hatred are fueled by pre-pandemic circumstances such as the precariousness of health systems and deficient medical equipment, misogyny, or the pervasiveness of authoritarian tendencies. Understanding this situation as a human rights issue, it is suggested to consider measures in order to discourage these attacks, such as: guaranteeing the appropriate conditions of hospitals and the personal protective equipment of workers; development of recognition campaigns of the healthcare staff and the work they carry out (in particular female nurses); and implementing transitory regulations that sanction any hate crime type attack to health workers or the scientific community. Furthermore, educational advocacy efforts should reiterate basic hygiene measures for the people, but also focus on refuting false and pseudoscientific beliefs that contribute to the fear-induced construction of the health worker as a threat of contagion.(AU)","Orellana, Carlos I",Rev. salud pública,,114

Using a cross-sectional online survey, this paper is the first from the Chinese outbreak to investigate how quarantine experiences and attitudes towards COVID-19 are related to mental health, and how these relationships change across the distribution of mental health scores. Using quantile regression analysis, we found that home self-quarantine is associated with a decrease in depression and an increase in happiness, while community-level quarantine is associated with decreased happiness, especially for those in the lower happiness quantile. We also found that favorable attitudes towards COVID-19 regarding the credibility of real-time updates and confidence in the epidemic control are associated with lower levels of depression and higher levels of happiness. These effects are stronger in the upper quantile of depression and the median quantile of happiness.","Lu, Haiyang; Nie, Peng; Qian, Long",Appl Res Qual Life,,114

255082,"Virology, pathogenesis, diagnosis and in-line treatment of COVID-19",2020,"Population ageing requires society to adjust by ensuring additional types of services and assistance for elderly people. These may be provided by either organized services and sources of informal social support. The latter are especially important since a lack of social support is associated with a lower level of psychological and physical well-being. During the Covid-19 pandemic, social support for the elderly has proven to be even more crucial, also due to physical distancing. Therefore, this study aims to identify and describe the various types of personal social support networks available to the elderly population during the pandemic. To this end, a survey of Slovenians older than 64 years was conducted from April 25 to May 4, 2020 on a probability web-panel-based sample (n = 605). The ego networks were clustered by a hierarchical clustering approach for symbolic data. Clustering was performed for different types of social support (socializing, instrumental support, emotional support) and different characteristics of the social support networks (i.e., type of relationship, number of contacts, geographical distance). The results show that most of the elderly population in Slovenia has a satisfactory social support network, while the share of those without any (accessible) source of social support is significant. The results are particularly valuable for sustainable care policy planning, crisis intervention planning as well as any future waves of the coronavirus.","Cugmas, Marjan; Ferligoj, Anuska; Kogovsek, Tina; Batagelj, Zenel",PLoS One,,114

To do so, we compared the trend of six types of actions related to the three phases of self-regulated learning before and after campus closures and between two semesters. We found that campus closure changed students' planning and goal setting strategies for completing the assignments, but didn't have a detectable impact on the outcome or the time of completion, nor did it change students' self-reflection behavior. The results suggest that most students still manage to complete assignments on time during the pandemic, while the design of online learning modules might have provided the flexibility and support for them to do so.","Zhang, Tom; Taub, Michelle; Chen, Zhongzhou",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.05872v1.pdf,114

We evaluated the performance of two commercially-available lateral flow immunochromatographic assays (LFIC) (Wondfo SARS-CoV-2 Antibody test and the INNOVITA 2019-nCoV Ab test) in comparison with a SARS-CoV-2 neutralization pseudotyped assay for COVID-19 diagnosis in hospitalized patients, and investigate whether the intensity of the test band in LFIC associates with neutralizing antibody (NtAb) titers. Ninety sera were included from 51 patients with moderate to severe COVID-19. A green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter-based pseudotyped neutralization assay (vesicular stomatitis virus coated with SARS-CoV-2 spike protein) was used. Test line intensity was scored using a 4-level scale (0 to 3+). Overall sensitivity of LFIC assays was 91.1% for the Wondfo SARS-CoV-2 Antibody test, 72.2% for the INNOVITA 2019-nCoV IgG, 85.6% for the INNOVITA 2019-nCoV IgM and 92.2% for the NtAb assay. Sensitivity increased for all assays in sera collected beyond day 14 after symptoms onset (93.9%, 79.6%,93.9% and 93.9%, respectively). Reactivities equal to or more intense than the positive control line (&#8805;2+) in the Wondfo assay had a negative predictive value of 100% and a positive predictive value of 96.4% for high NtAb50 titers (&#8805;1/160). Our findings support the use of LFIC assays evaluated herein, particularly the Wondfo test, for COVID-19 diagnosis.

METHOD: A comprehensive search was conducted (up to September 27, 2020), and 19 eligible records were identified according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The data of the studies were extracted by 2 independent reviewers and were analyzed to evaluate the safety and availability of tocilizumab for treating COVID-19. RESULTS: Thirteen retrospective case-control studies (n = 2285 patients) and 6 retrospective single-armed studies (n = 208) were retrieved in this study. In the comparison of tocilizumab treatment group (TCZ) and standard treatment group (ST), significant associations with a lower risk of admission to ICU, use of ventilation, and mortality (OR, 95% CI: 0.53, 0.26~1.09; 0.66, 0.46~0.94; 0.44, 0.36~0.55) were found in the tocilizumab treatment group. What is more, patients treated with tocilizumab had better clinical improvement compared with the patients treated with ST (OR, 1.24; 95% CI, 0.96~1.62). After taking tocilizumab, the patients had lower C-reactive protein (CRP), white blood cell count (WBC), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (WMD, 95% CI: - 99.66, - 156.24~- 43.09; - 0.95, - 1.8~- 0.11; - 12.58, - 18.88~-6.29) but higher troponin (WMD, 7.61; 95% CI, 3.06~12.15) than before. In addition, tocilizumab did not have significant influence on patients' neutrophil count (Neut), lymphocyte count (Lymp), platelet count (Plt), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and creatine (WMD, 95% CI: - 0.29, - 2.91~2.33; 0.42, - 0.23~1.07; 5.2, - 2.85~13.25; 22.49, - 2.73~47.7; - 44.78, - 93.37~3.81). CONCLUSION: Tocilizumab may have potential effectiveness to treat COVID-19 according to the results of this study. However, more large-scale studies are needed for more accurate conclusions.","Zhao, Meng; Lu, Jieyu; Tang, Yihu; Dai, Yawei; Zhou, Jingxin; Wu, Yanhu",Eur. j. clin. pharmacol,,114
264063,[COVID-19 and patients with cancer: Experiment of a French comprehensive cancer center]./ Première vague COVID-19 : expérience d'un centre de lutte contre le cancer,2021,"INTRODUCTION/OBJECTIVE: Chronic migraine (CM) is associated with impaired health-related quality of life and substantial socioeconomic burden, but many people with CM are underdiagnosed and do not receive appropriate preventive treatment. OnabotulinumtoxinA and topiramate have demonstrated efficacy (treatment benefit under ideal conditions) for the prevention of headaches in people with CM in clinical trials, but real-world studies suggest markedly different clinical effectiveness (treatment benefit based on a blend of efficacy and tolerability). This study sought to evaluate patient-reported outcomes (PROs) of onabotulinumtoxinA versus topiramate immediate release for people with CM. METHODS: FORWARD was a prospective, multicenter, randomized, parallel-group, open-label, phase 4 study comparing onabotulinumtoxinA 155 U every 12 weeks with topiramate 50 to 100 mg/day for &#8804;36 weeks in people with CM. PROs measured included the Headache Impact Test (HIT-6), 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire Quick Depression Assessment (PHQ-9), Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire: Specific Health Problem (WPAI:SHP), and Functional Impact of Migraine Questionnaire (FIMQ). RESULTS: A total of 282 patients were randomized and treated with onabotulinumtoxinA (n = 140) or topiramate (n = 142). From baseline to week 30, mean HIT-6 test scores improved significantly in patients taking onabotulinumtoxinA compared with topiramate (P < .001). Improvements in depression over time were observed via larger changes in PHQ-9 scores with onabotulinumtoxinA than topiramate (P < .001). Work productivity assessed via WPAI:SHP scores revealed significant improvements with onabotulinumtoxinA versus topiramate in Work Productivity Loss (P = .024) and Activity Impairment (P < .001) domains. Results from the FIMQ also revealed a larger reduction from baseline with onabotulinumtoxinA vs topiramate (P < .0001). CONCLUSION: OnabotulinumtoxinA treatment had more favorable real-world effectiveness than topiramate on depression, headache impact, functioning and daily living, activity, and work productivity. The overall study results suggest that the beneficial effects on a range of PROs are the result of improved effectiveness when onabotulinumtoxinA is used as preventive treatment for CM.

264064,[COVID-19 and patients with cancer: Experiment of a French comprehensive cancer center],2021,"BACKGROUND: Abnormal movements in Covid-19 patients have been reported with varying degree of frequency, prompting neurologic consultation and additional diagnostic evaluation. We sought to evaluate the frequency and etiology of abnormal movements among hospitalized Covid-19 patients undergoing neurologic consultation. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the first 50 consecutive patients with confirmed Covid-19 hospitalized at our tertiary medical care center who underwent acute inpatient neurology consultation from March 2020 through May 2020. Indication for neurologic consultation and diagnostic studies performed were identified by electronic medical record review. RESULTS: Of the 50 initial consultation requests, 11 (22.0%) patients were evaluated for abnormal movements (nine male and two female). Myoclonus was diagnosed in 6/11 (54.5%) patients. Additionally, two patients were diagnosed with seizures (confirmed on EEG in one), while two additional patients were diagnosed with tremor (physiologic and probable functional). A single case of serotonin syndrome was also identified. CONCLUSION: Abnormal movements observed in hospitalized Covid-19 patients can have a wide range of etiologies and were a frequent initial indication for neurologic consultation. Myoclonus was the most frequent type of abnormal movement observed. Early clinical recognition and directed diagnostic work-up is essential for accurate diagnoses in these patients.","Clark, Jeffrey R; Liotta, Eric M; Reish, Nicholas J; Shlobin, Nathan A; Hoffman, Steven C; Orban, Zachary S; Lim, Patrick H; Koralnik, Igor J; Batra, Ayush",J Neurol Sci,,114

(Special Issue: Therapeutic targets and pharmacological treatment of COVID-19.),2020,"ABSTRACT: This work considers the implications of cloth masks due to the COVID-19 pandemic on suspected plutonium inhalations and dose assessment. In a plutonium inhalation scenario, the greater filtration efficiency for large particles exhibited by cloth masks can reduce early fecal excretion without a corresponding reduction in dose. For plutonium incidents in which cloth masks are worn, urinary excretion should be the preferred method of inferring dose immediately after the inhalation, and fecal excretion should be considered unreliable for up to 10 days.","Klumpp, John; Poudel, Deepesh",Health Phys,,114

The current study investigated how well employees worked and felt in this novel situation by following n = 199 German employees-56% of them female, 24% with childcare duties-over the course of two working weeks in which they reported once daily on their well-being (PANAS-20, detachment) and motivation (work engagement, flow). Participants reported on organizational and personal resources (emotional exhaustion, emotion regulation, segmentation preference, role clarity, job control, social support). Importantly, they indicated how well their work-related basic needs, i.e., autonomy, competence, and relatedness, were met when working from home and how these needs had been met in the office. Multilevel models of growth showed that work engagement, flow, affect and detachment were on average positive and improving over the two weeks in study. Higher competence need satisfaction predicted better daily work engagement, flow, and affect. In a network model, we explored associations and dynamics between daily variables. Overall, the results suggest that people adapted well to the novel situation, with their motivation and well-being indicators showing adequate levels and increasing trajectories. Avenues for improving work from home are job control and social support.","Schade, Hannah M; Digutsch, Jan; Kleinsorge, Thomas; Fan, Yan",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,114
265091,Potential role of memantine in the prevention and treatment of COVID-19: its antagonism of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChR) and beyond,2020,"ABSTRACT: Infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) can lead to coronavirus-induced disease 2019 (COVID-19). The gastrointestinal (GI) tract is now an appreciated portal of infection. SARS-CoV-2 enters host cells via angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) and the serine protease TMPRSS2. Eosinophilic gastrointestinal disorders (EGIDs) are inflammatory conditions caused by chronic type 2 (T2) inflammation. the effects of the T2 atopic inflammatory milieu on SARS-COV-2 viral entry gene expression in the GI tract is poorly understood. We analyzed tissue ACE2 and TMPRSS2 gene expression in pediatric eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE), eosinophilic gastritis (EG), and in normal adult esophagi using publicly available RNA-sequencing datasets. Similar to findings evaluating the airway, there was no difference in tissue ACE2/TMPRSS2 expression in EoE or EG when compared with control non-EoE/EG esophagus/stomach. ACE2 gene expression was significantly lower in esophagi from children with or without EoE and from adults with EoE as compared with normal adult esophagi. Type 2 immunity and pediatric age could be protective for infection by SARS-CoV-2 in the gastrointestinal tract because of decreased expression of ACE2.","Chiang, Austin W T; Duong, Loan D; Shoda, Tetsuo; Nhu, Quan M; Ruffner, Melanie; Hara, Takeo; Aaron, Bailey; Joplin, Erik; Manresa, Mario C; Abonia, J Pablo; Dellon, Evan S; Hirano, Ikuo; Gonsalves, Nirmala; Gupta, Sandeep K; Furuta, Glenn T; Rothenberg, Marc E; Lewis, Nathan E; Muir, Amanda B; Aceves, Seema S",J Pediatr Gastroenterol Nutr,,114

265605,Oncology services in corona times: a flash interview among German cancer patients and their physicians,2020,"School closures affected more than 55 million students across the United States when implemented as a strategy to prevent the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19 (1). Reopening schools requires balancing the risks for SARS-CoV-2 infection to students and staff members against the benefits of in-person learning (2). During December 3, 2020-January 31, 2021, CDC investigated SARS-CoV-2 transmission in 20 elementary schools (kindergarten through grade 6) that had reopened in Salt Lake County, Utah. The 7-day cumulative number of new COVID-19 cases in Salt Lake County during this time ranged from 290 to 670 cases per 100,000 persons. Susceptible§ school contacts¶ (students and staff members exposed to SARS-CoV-2 in school) of 51 index patients** (40 students and 11 staff members) were offered SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing. Among 1,041 susceptible school contacts, 735 (70.6%) were tested, and five of 12 cases identified were classified as school-associated; the secondary attack rate among tested susceptible school contacts was 0.7%. Mask use among students was high (86%), and the median distance between students' seats in classrooms was 3 ft. Despite high community incidence and an inability to maintain &#8805;6 ft of distance between students at all times, SARS-CoV-2 transmission was low in these elementary schools. The results from this investigation add to the increasing evidence that in-person learning can be achieved with minimal SARS-CoV-2 transmission risk when multiple measures to prevent transmission are implemented (3,4).","Hershow, Rebecca B; Wu, Karen; Lewis, Nathaniel M; Milne, Alison T; Currie, Dustin; Smith, Amanda R; Lloyd, Spencer; Orleans, Brian; Young, Erin L; Freeman, Brandi; Schwartz, Noah; Bryant, Bobbi; Espinosa, Catherine; Nakazawa, Yoshinori; Garza, Elizabeth; Almendares, Olivia; Abara, Winston E; Ehlman, Daniel C; Waters, Keith; Hill, Mary; Risk, Ilene; Oakeson, Kelly; Tate, Jacqueline E; Kirking, Hannah L; Dunn, Angela; Vallabhaneni, Snigdha; Hersh, Adam L; Chu, Victoria T",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,,114

265829,Hemorrhage Is a Major Cause of Blood Transfusion in COVID-19 Patients,2020,"Healthcare workers are considered at higher risk for mumps infection than the general population. Since 2017, the national immunization plan recommended the administration of a dose of measles–mumps–rubella (MMR) vaccine to the healthcare operators who are unable to demonstrate a complete vaccination history or that are seronegative for at least one of the three agents. Regarding mumps infection, based on actual concerns regarding the loss of protection over the years after vaccination, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommended to administer a third dose of vaccine to operators previously vaccinated with two doses of MMR vaccine who belong to a group at increased risk of mumps infection in the event of an epidemic. This guideline, however, is not currently followed in Italy, resulting in a potential risk for vaccinated operators to become unprotected from mumps over the years. The aim of our study is to evaluate the persistence of a protective antibody level for mumps among medical students vaccinated during infancy or adolescence, at the start of their hospital internship. We retrospectively evaluated mumps-specific IgG levels in a group of medical students, in the period from 1 January to 31 December 2020. We evaluated the persistence of the detectable level of mumps-specific antibodies in relation to their vaccinal status, gender and time elapsed from vaccination. We found that 17.4% (65 subjects) of our sample were seronegative for mumps. The univariate analysis showed a significant difference in serological protection between male and female gender (77.0% vs. 86.2%;p &lt; 0.05 with chi2 test) and between age classes (86.5% vs. 76.4%;p &lt; 0.05 for subjects aged 18–23 years and over 23 years, respectively). Female gender was significantly related to higher serological protection even after adjusting for age classes and number of vaccine doses administered in a multivariate analysis model. Our study shows a substantial percentage of subjects lacking a protective mumps titer among medical students who were vaccinated in childhood. Given the higher risk of infection among those subjects, routine pre-employment screening should be performed among those operators regardless of their vaccination history and a third dose of MMR should be offered to unprotected students.","Ferrari, Cristiana Marco Trabucco Aurilio Mazza Andrea Pietroiusti Antonio Magrini Andrea Balbi Ottavia Bolcato Matteo Coppeta Luca",Vaccines,,114

Evidence regarding detection, management, and monitoring of COVID-19-associated coagulopathy is still missing. We propose to describe the thrombus viscoelastic properties to investigate the mechanisms of hypercoagulability in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: Thromboelastography (TEG) was performed in 24 consecutive patients admitted to a single intensive care unit for COVID-19 pneumonia, and 10 had a second TEG before being discharged alive from the intensive care unit. RESULTS: Compared with a group of 20 healthy participants, patients with COVID-19 had significantly decreased values of reaction time, coagulation time, and lysis index and increased values of &#945; angle, maximum amplitude, clot strength, and coagulation index. Velocity curves were consistent with increased generation of thrombin. These values persisted in surviving patients despite their good clinical course. DISCUSSION: In patients with COVID-19, TEG demonstrates a complex and prolonged hypercoagulable state including fast initiation of coagulation and clot reinforcement, low fibrinolysis, high potential of thrombin generation, and high fibrinogen and platelet contribution. The antithrombotic strategy in patients with COVID-19 during intensive care hospitalisation and after discharge should be investigated in further studies.","Cordier, Pierre-Yves; Pierrou, Candice; Noel, Alexandre; Paris, Raphaël; Gaudray, Eliott; Martin, Edouard; Contargyris, Claire; Bélot-De Saint Léger, Frédérik; Lyochon, Arthur; Astier, Hélène; Desmots, Florian; Savini, Hélène; Surcouf, Corinne",Aust. crit. care,,114

267995,Optimizing breast cancer surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"At the end of December 2019, the Health Commission of the city of Wuhan, China, alerted the World Health Organization (WHO) to a pneumonia cluster in the city. The cause was identified as being a new virus, later named SARS-CoV-2. We can distinguish three clinical phases of the disease with a distinct pathogenesis, manifestations and prognosis. Here, we describe the case of a 45-year-old male, successfully treated for Coronavirus disease (COVID-19). The patient was feeling sick in early April 2020; he had a fever and pharyngodynia. When he came to our COVID hospital, his breathing was normal. The nasopharyngeal swab specimen turned out positive. High-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) showed mild interstitial pneumonia. The patient was admitted to our department and treated with hydroxychloroquine, ritonavir, darunavir, azithromycin and enoxaparin. On day seven of the disease, the patient's respiratory condition got worse as he was developing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). He was given tocilizumab and corticosteroids and was immediately treated with non-invasive mechanical ventilation (NIMV). His condition improved, and in the ensuing days, the treatment gradually switched to a high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC); after 18 days, the patient's clinical condition was good.The successful results we have been able to obtain are closely associated with avoidance of invasive ventilation that may lead to intensive care unit (ICU)-related superinfections. In our opinion, it is fundamental to understand that COVID-19 is a systemic disease that is a consequence of an overwhelming inflammatory response, which can cause severe medical conditions, even in young patients.","Massabeti, Rosanna; Cipriani, Maria Stella; Valenti, Ivana",J Popul Ther Clin Pharmacol,,114

268836,Audio Interview: Protecting the Immunosuppressed against Covid-19,2021,"The pandemic of COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2, is a major global health threat. Epidemiological studies suggest that bats (Rhinolophus affinis) are the natural zoonotic reservoir for SARS-CoV-2. However, the host range of SARS-CoV-2 and intermediate hosts that facilitate its transmission to humans remain unknown. The interaction of coronavirus with its host receptor is a key genetic determinant of host range and cross-species transmission. SARS-CoV-2 uses angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as the receptor to enter host cells in a species-dependent manner. In this study, we characterized the ability of ACE2 from diverse species to support viral entry. By analyzing the conservation of five residues in two virus-binding hotspots of ACE2 (hotspot 31Lys and hotspot 353Lys), we predicted 80 ACE2 proteins from mammals that could potentially mediate SARS-CoV-2 entry. We chose 48 ACE2 orthologs among them for functional analysis, and showed that 44 of these orthologs-including domestic animals, pets, livestock, and animals commonly found in zoos and aquaria-could bind the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and support viral entry. In contrast, New World monkey ACE2 orthologs could not bind the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and support viral entry. We further identified the genetic determinant of New World monkey ACE2 that restricts viral entry using genetic and functional analyses.

269050,"The cytokine storms of COVID-19, H1N1 influenza, CRS and MAS compared. Can one sized treatment fit all?",2021,"This study attempts an integrated analysis of the health and economic aspects of COVID-19 that is based on publicly available data from a wide range of data sources. The analysis is done keeping in mind the close interaction between the health and economic shocks of COVID-19. The study combines descriptive and qualitative approaches using figures and graphs with quantitative methods that estimate the plotted relationships and econometric estimation that attempts to explain cross-country variation in COVID-19 incidence, deaths and 'case fatality rates'. The study seeks to answer a set of questions on COVID-19 such as: what are the economic effects of COVID-19, focussing on international inequality and global poverty? How effective was lockdown in curbing COVID-19? What was the effect of lockdown on economic growth? Did the stimulus packages work in delinking the health shocks from the economic ones? Did 'better governed countries' with greater public trust and those with superior health care fare better than others? Did countries that have experienced previous outbreaks such as SARS fare better than those who have not? The study provides mixed messages on the effectiveness of lockdowns in controlling COVID-19. While several countries, especially in the East Asia and Pacific region, have used it quite effectively recording low infection rates going into lockdown and staying low after the lockdown, the two spectacular failures are Brazil and India. In contrast to lockdown, the evidence on the effectiveness of stimulus programs in avoiding recession and promoting growth is unequivocal. The effectiveness is much greater in the case of emerging/developing economies than in the advanced economies. Multilateral institutions such as the World Bank and the IMF need to work out a coordinated strategy to declare immediate debt relief and provide additional liquidity to the poorer economies to help them announce effective stimulus measures. COVID-19 will lead to a large increase in the global pool of those living in 'extreme poverty'. A poignant feature of our results is that while a significant share of health shocks from COVID-19 is borne by the advanced economies, the burden of 'COVID-19 poverty' will almost exclusively fall on two of the poorest regions, namely, Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia.","Ray, Ranjan; Kumar, Sanjesh",Indian Econ Rev,,114

269561,Factors involved in low susceptibility to COVID-19: An adaptation of high altitude inhabitants,2020,"OBJECTIVES: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) blindness, that is, the excessive consideration of the disease in diagnosis, has reportedly led to delayed diagnosis of some diseases. We compared several clinical measures between patients admitted for bacteremia during the two months of the COVID-19 pandemic and those admitted during the same period in 2019. We hypothesized that the pandemic has led to delayed treatment of bacteremia. METHODS: This retrospective observational study compared several measures undertaken for patients who visited the emergency unit in two hospitals between March 1 and May 31, 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic and whose blood cultures tested positive for bacteremia with those for corresponding patients treated during the same period in 2019. The primary measure was time from consultation to blood culture/antimicrobials. RESULTS: We included 29 eligible patients from 2020 and 26 from 2019. In 2020, the time from consultation to antimicrobial administration was significantly longer than in 2019 (mean [range], 222 [145-309] min vs. 139 [102-179] min, p=0.002). The frequency of chest computed tomography (CT) was significantly higher in 2020 (96.6 vs. 73.1%, p=0.021). Significant differences were not observed in the time to blood culture or chest CT preceding the blood culture between the two periods. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggested that due to the COVID-19 epidemic/pandemic, focusing on the exclusion of its infection using CT scans leads to an overall delay in the diagnosis and treatment of bacteremia. Medical providers must be aware of COVID-19 blindness and evaluate patients objectively based on rational criteria and take appropriate action.","Miyagami, Taiju; Uehara, Yuki; Harada, Taku; Watari, Takashi; Shimizu, Taro; Nakamura, Ayako; Ogura, Naoya; Kushiro, Seiko; Masuyama, Katsutoshi; Kanai, Yoshinori; Yang, Kwang-Seok; Naito, Toshio","Diagnosis (Berl., Internet)",,114

Our objective was to identify prevalence of hyperglycaemia in COVID-19 patients with and without prior diabetes and quantify its association with COVID-19 disease course. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This observational cohort study included all consecutive COVID-19 patients admitted to John H Stroger Jr. Hospital, Chicago, IL from March 15, 2020 to May 3, 2020 and followed till May 15, 2020. The primary outcome was hospital mortality, and the studied predictor was hyperglycaemia [any blood glucose &#8805;7.78 mmol/L (140 mg/dL) during hospitalization]. RESULTS: Of the 403 COVID-19 patients studied, 51 (12.7%) died; 335 (83.1%) were discharged while 17 (4%) were still in hospital. Hyperglycaemia occurred in 228 (56.6%) patients; 83 of these hyperglycaemic patients (36.4%) had no prior history of diabetes. Compared to the reference group no-diabetes/no-hyperglycaemia patients the no-diabetes/hyperglycaemia patients showed higher mortality [1.8% versus 20.5%, adjusted odds ratio 21.94 (95% confidence interval 4.04-119.0), P < 0.001]; improved prediction of death (P = 0.01) and faster progression to death (P < 0.01). Hyperglycaemia within the first 24 and 48 h was also significantly associated with mortality (odds ratio 2.15 and 3.31, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Hyperglycaemia without prior diabetes was common (20.6% of hospitalized COVID-19 patients) and was associated with an increased risk of and faster progression to death. Development of hyperglycaemia in COVID-19 patients who do not have diabetes is an early indicator of progressive disease.","Mamtani, M; Athavale, A M; Abraham, M; Vernik, J; Amarah, A R; Ruiz, J P; Joshi, A J; Itteera, M; Zhukovski, S D; Madaiah, R P; White, B C; Hart, P; Kulkarni, H",Diabetes Metab,,114

Nighttime sky radiance is an effective measure to study its effects on individual sleep quality. Objectives: The study is aimed to measure the effect of light pollution on the sleep quality and compare among people residing in selected rural and urban areas of West Bengal, India. Methods: A comparative cross-sectional study was conducted during September-October 2018 in 10 villages of Barasat II block and 10 wards of Kolkata Municipal Corporation. Two hundred and sixty-three participants from urban and 249 participants from rural areas were selected through multi-stage sampling. Data regarding sleep quality and other selected factors were geotagged along with the radiance data. Multi-level linear regression models were built. Results: The mean age of the participants from rural and urban areas were respectively 37.65 (±10.77) years and 38.10 (±11.02) years. Gender-wise the participants were distributed almost evenly in urban and rural areas. Among the urban and rural population, the observed mean global Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index scores were 12.63 (±3.04) and 9.23 (±2.27), respectively. Poorer sleep quality was observed to be statistically significant with increasing level of exposure. Multi-level models show that, at an exposure of >40.0 nW/cm2/sr the adjusted coefficient was 11.52 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 9.65, 13.40) in the overall model and 12.84 (95% CI: 12.31, 13.37) for urban participants. Conclusion: The disturbance in sleep is associated with higher levels of night-time radiance of the sky strongly observed among the urban population.","Lahiri, Arista; Chakraborty, Arup; Roy, Amal Kumar Sinha; Dasgupta, Urmila; Bhattacharyya, Krishnadas",Indian J Public Health,,114

275444,"Infection, Infectious Agents and Vascular Disease",2021,"Public health experts emphasize the need for quick, point-of-care SARS-CoV-2 detection as an effective strategy for controlling virus spread. To this end, many ""antigen"" detection devices were developed and commercialized. These devices are mostly based on detecting SARS-CoV-2's nucleocapsid protein. Recently, alerts issued by both the FDA and the CDC raised concerns regarding the devices' tendency to exhibit false positive results. In this work, we developed a novel alternative spike-based antigen assay, comprising four high-affinity, specific monoclonal antibodies, directed against different epitopes on the spike's S1 subunit. The assay's performance was evaluated for COVID-19 detection from nasopharyngeal swabs, compared to an in-house nucleocapsid-based assay, composed of novel antibodies directed against the nucleocapsid. Detection of COVID-19 was carried out in a cohort of 284 qRT-PCR positive and negative nasopharyngeal swab samples. The time resolved fluorescence (TRF) ELISA spike assay displayed very high specificity (99%) accompanied with a somewhat lower sensitivity (66% for Ct < 25), compared to the nucleocapsid ELISA assay which was more sensitive (85% for Ct < 25) while less specific (87% specificity). Despite being outperformed by qRT-PCR, we suggest that there is room for such tests in the clinical setting, as cheap and rapid pre-screening tools. Our results further suggest that when applying antigen detection, one must consider its intended application (sensitivity vs specificity), taking into consideration that the nucleocapsid might not be the optimal target. In this regard, we propose that a combination of both antigens might contribute to the validity of the results. Schematic representation of sample collection and analysis.

Second, to address this challenge for professionalism, in this paper I articulate the term ""relational centered-patient professionalism"", which has two main axes. The relational approach means taking into account how the relationships among professionals, patients and institutions determine the constitution and evolution of those professional values.

Oral health professionals have been particularly affected during this crisis, and the use of digital health, and especially teledentistry, has been considered in many countries. However, the development of teledentistry is not free of bogus ""good"" ideas. It is time that teledentistry be adequately considered, while ensuring the quality of the medical procedure and with the aim of reducing inequalities in terms of access to oral healthcare and public health problems.","Giraudeau, Nicolas",Inquiry,,114

Despite recognizing the need for triage, responses are not the same everywhere, and opinions and practices differ around what guidelines should be used, how they should be implemented, and who should ultimately decide. To some extent, triage issues reflect community values, revealing a given society's moral standards and ideals. Our goal is to study two countries which share many common features-Italy and France-as they deal with the pandemic, revealing the moral organization of medicine and healthcare, the power structures, and the nature of the disruptions in each context.","Orfali, Kristina",J Bioeth Inq,,114

282719,Letter: elevated liver enzymes and outcome in COVID-19,2020,"One Welfare describes the interconnection between animal welfare, human wellbeing and their physical and social environment. The SARS-CoV-2 virus is the cause of COVID-19 and emerged as a human pathogen in 2019 although is thought to have a zoonotic source. The original wildlife reservoir and any potential intermediate hosts have not yet been identified. The combination of the virus zoonotic condition together with the impacts of disease control measures has exposed clear interconnections between animals, people and their environment from both a health and a welfare perspective. The One Welfare Framework comprises five sections that can help understand the different One Welfare levels on which the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the world. This paper uses the One Welfare Framework to provide an overview of examples, within each of the five sections, where evidence is and/or can be made available to document COVID-19 impacts on One Welfare. The paper identifies a number of areas where further research and evidence gathering is required to better understand the different One Welfare impacts. Based on evidence summarised in this paper the author recommends that those responsible for managing the COVID-19 impacts and for planning the future recovery phase of the pandemic should consider adopting a holistic approach, including both health and welfare, by adopting & One Health, One Welfare& policies.","García Pinillos, Rebeca",Appl Anim Behav Sci,,114

The aim of this meta-analysis is to estimate the rate of GI bleeding of patientsinfected with SARS-CoV-2. Methods MEDLINE via PubMed, Ovid Embase, Scopus and Cochrane Library were systematically searched through October,10th 2020. Studies simultaneously reporting cohorts of COVID-19 patients with and without GI bleeding were included. Arandom-effect model was applied for pooling results;heterogeneity was expressed as I . Impact of confounding covariateson the meta-analytic results was evaluated using meta-regression analysis. Results Seven studies (including a total of 1047 COVID-19 patients) met the inclusion criteria and were included in theanalysis. Among COVID-19 patients with gastrointestinal bleeding, 93 experienced upper and 21 lower GI bleeding. The mean age ofparticipants ranged from 45.3 to 73.7 years. Four studies have been carried out in Western countries (2 in the US, 1 in Italyand 1 in Israel), and 3 in Eastern countries (China). Three studies reported the rate of patients taking anticoagulants orantiplatelets, ranging from 37.4 % to 100 %. The overall pooled bleeding rate was 9 % [95 % CI: 2 % to 20 %], with highheterogeneity (I 96.4 %), and no “small study effect” observed using the Egger test (p = 0.979). The pooled uppergastrointestinal bleeding rate was 7 % (95 % CI: 1 % to 17 %, I 95.3 %, Egger test p = 0.835), whereas the pooled lowergastrointestinal bleeding rate was 1 % (95 % CI: 0 % to 4 %, I 82.4 %, Egger test p = 0.437). Meta-regression analysisshowed that overall risk bleeding was significantly affected by the geographic area of the study (β 0.899±0.027) and theupper source of bleeding (β 1.010±0.003). Conclusions In this meta-analysis of published studies, individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infections were found to be at risk forGI bleeding, especially upper GI bleeding.","Marasco, G.; Maida, M.; Morreale, G.

283051,COVID-19 and the multidisciplinary care of patients with lung cancer: an evidence-based review and commentary,2021,"The COVID-19 epidemic that emerged in Wuhan China at the end of 2019 hit Italy particularly hard, yielding the implementation of strict national lockdown rules (Phase 1). There is now a hot ongoing debate in Italy and abroad on what the best strategy is to restart a country to exit a national lockdown (Phase 2). Previous studies have focused on modelling possible restarting scenarios at the national level, overlooking the fact that Italy, as other nations around the world, is divided in administrative regions who can independently oversee their own share of the Italian National Health Service. In this study, we show that regionalism, and heterogeneity between regions, is essential to understand the spread of the epidemic and, more importantly, to design effective post Lock-Down strategies to control the disease. To achieve this, we model Italy as a network of regions and parameterize the model of each region on real data spanning almost two months from the initial outbreak. Using the model, we confirm the effectiveness at the regional level of the national lockdown strategy implemented so far by the Italian government to mitigate the spread of the disease and show its efficacy at the regional level. We also propose that differentiated, albeit coordinated, regional interventions can be effective in Phase 2 to restart the country and avoid future recurrence of the epidemic, while avoiding saturation of the regional health systems and mitigating impact on costs. Our study and methodology can be easily extended to other levels of granularity (provinces or counties in the same region or states in other federal countries, etc.) to support policy- and decision-makers.","Rossa, Fabio Della; Salzano, Davide; Meglio, Anna Di; Lellis, Francesco De; Coraggio, Marco; Calabrese, Carmela; Guarino, Agostino; Cardona, Ricardo; DeLellis, Pietro; Liuzza, Davide; Iudice, Francesco Lo; Russo, Giovanni; Bernardo, Mario di",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.07594v1.pdf,114

O estudo foi realizado no Laboratório de Microbiologia e Imunologia da UNIVASF, na cidade de Petrolina-PE. Os extratos foram preparados utilizando diferentes diluentes, sendo estes: álcool etílico absoluto e a água destilada. Em seguida, foi empregada a técnica da Concentração Inibitória Mínima (MIC) e da Concentração Bactericida Mínima (CBM). Todos os ensaios foram realizados em triplicata. A CBM média do extrato diluído em etanol foi de 358µg/µL e do extrato diluído em água destilada foi igual a 520,82µg/mL. Não houve diferença (P<0,05) quanto à inibição bacteriana para o extrato diluído em álcool etílico absoluto ou água destilada autoclavada. Ao comparar a atividade do extrato diluído em álcool etílico absoluto e a relação com a presença do gene blaZ, observou-se que os isolados negativos para o gene pesquisado apresentaram uma CBM igual a 412,3µg/mL, e, quando comparadas aos que foram positivos para o gene blaZ, que foi de 308,80µg/mL, contudo sem diferença estatística. Quanto à inibição das bactérias utilizando extrato aquoso, a atividade foi igual para as bactérias com ou sem o gene (520,82µg/mL). Desse modo, tanto o extrato diluído em álcool etílico absoluto quanto em agua destilada autoclavada demonstrou atividade antimicrobiana, sugerindo que ocorreu extração de substâncias bioativas. Em relação ao potencial antisséptico, H. martiana teve ação pareada com o cloro, contudo aquele agiu mais rapidamente, enquanto o cloro agiu de modo ideal uma hora após a aplicação; ambos os resultados destacam que o extrato etanólico bruto das folhas de H. martiana possui potencial de combate à proliferação de bactérias ambientais e infecciosas, surgindo como uma forma de prevenir a mastite.(AU)","Vieira, Dielson S; Peixoto, Rodolfo M; Costa, Mateus M; Freire, Davi P; Silva, Telma Maria G; Silva, Tania Maria S",Pesqui. vet. bras,,114

The cost of unmitigated polarization would be extremely high for the society; therefore, it is desirable to identify the polarizing issues before they become serious. With this in mind, we conducted a retrospective analysis of the polarized subtopics of COVID-19 to obtain insights for future policymaking. To this end, we first propose a framework to comprehensively search for controversial subtopics. We then retrospectively analyze subtopics on COVID-19 using the proposed framework, with data obtained via Twitter in Japan. The results show that the proposed framework can effectively detect controversial subtopics that reflect current reality. Controversial subtopics tend to be about the government, medical matters, economy, and education; moreover, the controversy score had a low correlation with the traditional indicators--scale and sentiment of the subtopics--which suggests that the controversy score is a potentially important indicator to be obtained. We also discussed the difference between subtopics that became highly controversial and ones that did not despite their large scale.","Miyazaki, Kunihiro; Uchiba, Takayuki; Toriumi, Fujio; Tanaka, Kenji; Sakaki, Takeshi",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.09354v1.pdf,114

This came as a shock to a country that was already battling with the deadly COVID-19 pandemic. The emergence of the virus has spurred import bans and massive culls in the poultry business. Local experts have also called for a restriction on the movement of people and cars in and out of their chicken farms. Employees have also been encouraged to shower in the mornings when they arrive at the farms and wear fresh clothes, as the flu spreads very quickly. In a country that is already facing the economic implications of the COVID-19, this has the potential to cause a significant dent in the economy, as well as severely impact people's day-to-day life. Bird flu-also called avian influenza-is a viral infection that can infect not only birds but also humans and other animals. The threat of a new influenza pandemic has prompted countries to draft national strategic preparedness plans to prevent, contain and mitigate the next human influenza pandemic.

Its depletion, however, also has curative effects against some viral infections, suggesting that different components of the intestinal microbiota can play both promoting and inhibitory roles depending on the type of viral infection. The two primary mechanisms by which the microbiota facilitates or inhibits viral invasion involve participation in the innate and adaptive immune responses and direct or indirect interaction with the virus, during which the abundance and composition of the intestinal microbiota might be changed by the virus. Oral administration of probiotics, faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), and antibiotics are major therapeutic strategies for regulating intestinal microbiota balance. However, these three methods have shown limited curative effects in clinical trials. Therefore, the intestinal microbiota might represent a new and promising supplementary antiviral therapeutic target, and more efficient and safer methods for regulating the microbiota require deeper investigation. This review summarizes the latest research on the relationship among the intestinal microbiota, anti-viral immunity and viruses and the most commonly used methods for regulating the intestinal microbiota with the goal of providing new insight into the antiviral effects of the gut microbiota.","Yang, Mengling; Yang, Yang; He, Qingnan; Zhu, Ping; Liu, Mengqi; Xu, Jiahao; Zhao, Mingyi",Front Immunol,,114

Any potential course of action to manage this complex disease requires the systematic and efficient analysis of data that can delineate the underlying pathogenesis. We have developed a mathematical model of disease progression to predict the clinical outcome, utilizing a set of causal factors known to contribute to COVID-19 pathology such as age, comorbidities, and certain viral and immunological parameters. Viral load and selected indicators of a dysfunctional immune response, such as cytokines IL-6 and IFNα which contribute to the cytokine storm and fever, parameters of inflammation D-Dimer and Ferritin, aberrations in lymphocyte number, lymphopenia, and neutralizing antibodies were included for the analysis. The model provides a framework to unravel the multi-factorial complexities of the immune response manifested in SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals. Further, this model can be valuable to predict clinical outcome at an individual level, and to develop strategies for allocating appropriate resources to manage severe cases at a population level.","Chirmule, N.; Khare, R.; Nair, P.; Desai, B.; Nerurkar, V.; Gaur, A.",Clin Exp Pharmacol,,114

The novelty of the recent COVID-19 outbreak has led patients to turn more frequently to the internet to gather more information and to alleviate their concerns about the virus. OBJECTIVE: The aims of the study were to (1) determine the most commonly searched phrases related to COVID-19 in the United States and (2) identify the sources of information for these web searches. METHODS: Search terms related to COVID-19 were entered into Google. Questions and websites from Google web search were extracted to a database using customized software. Each question was categorized into one of 6 topics: clinical signs and symptoms, treatment, transmission, cleaning methods, activity modification, and policy. Additionally, the websites were categorized according to source: World Health Organization (WHO), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), non-CDC government, academic, news, and other media. RESULTS: In total, 200 questions and websites were extracted. The most common question topic was transmission (n=63, 31.5%), followed by clinical signs and symptoms (n=54, 27.0%) and activity modification (n=31, 15.5%). Notably, the clinical signs and symptoms category captured questions about myths associated with the disease, such as whether consuming alcohol stops the coronavirus. The most common websites provided were maintained by the CDC, the WHO, and academic medical organizations. Collectively, these three sources accounted for 84.0% (n=168) of the websites in our sample. CONCLUSIONS: In the United States, the most commonly searched topics related to COVID-19 were transmission, clinical signs and symptoms, and activity modification.

Telehealth is a viable alternative to face-to-face service delivery. Telephone calls alone, however, may be insufficient. Here, we evaluated whether supplementary telehealth via video-conferencing platforms could bring additional benefits to care-recipient with NCD and their spousal caregivers at home. PARTICIPANTS: Sixty older adults NCD-and-caregiver dyads were recruited through an activity center. DESIGN, INTERVENTION: The impact of additional services delivered to both care-recipient and caregiver through video conference (nâ¯=â¯30) was compared with telehealth targeted at caregivers by telephone only (nâ¯=â¯30), over 4 weeks in a pretest-post-test design. Interviews and questionnaires were conducted at baseline and study's end. MEASUREMENTS, RESULTS: Supplementary telemedicine had averted the deterioration in the Montreal Cognitive Assessment evident in the telephone-only group (Î·p2â¯=â¯0.50). It also reversed the falling trend in quality of life observed in the telephone only group (QoL-AD, Î·p2â¯=â¯0.23). Varying degrees of improvements in physical and mental health (Short-Form 36 v2), perceived burden (Zarit Burden Interview Scale) and self-efficacy (Revised Caregiving Self-Efficacy Scale) were observed among caregivers in the video-conferencing group, which were absent in the telephone-only group (Î·p2â¯=â¯0.23-0.51). CONCLUSION: Telemedicine by video conference was associated with improved resilience and wellbeing to both people with NCD and their caregivers at home. The benefits were visible already after 4 weeks and unmatched by telephone alone. Video conference as the modus operandi of telehmedicine beyond the context of pandemic-related social distancing should be considered.","Lai, Frank Ho-Yin; Yan, Elaine Wai-Hung; Yu, Kathy Ka-Ying; Tsui, Wing-Sze; Chan, Daniel Ting-Hoi; Yee, Benjamin K",Am J Geriatr Psychiatry,,114

296398,Termination of pregnancy in a twin pregnant patient with COVID-19,2020,"Poorly regulated reward seeking is a central feature of substance use disorder. Recent research shows that rewarding drug-related experiences induce synchronous activation of a discrete number of neurons in the nucleus accumbens that are causally linked to reward-related contexts. Here we comprehensively characterize the specific ensemble of neurons built through experience that are linked to seeking behavior. We additionally address the question of whether or not addictive drugs usurp the neuronal networks recruited by natural rewards by evaluating cocaine- and sucrose-associated ensembles within the same mouse. We used FosCreERT2/+/Ai14 transgenic mice to tag cells activated by and potentially encoding cocaine and sucrose seeking. We tagged ~1% of neurons in the core subregion of the accumbens (NAcore) activated during cue-induced seeking for cocaine or sucrose. The majority of tagged cells in the seeking ensembles were D1-MSNs, and specifically activated during seeking, not during extinction or when mice remained in the home cage. To compare different reward-specific ensembles within the same mouse, we used a dual cocaine and sucrose self-administration protocol allowing reward-specific seeking. Using this model, we found ~70% distinction between the cells constituting the cocaine- compared to the sucrose-seeking ensemble. Establishing that cocaine recruits an ensemble of NAcore neurons largely distinct from neurons recruited into an ensemble coding for sucrose seeking suggest a finely tuned specificity of ensembles. The findings allow further exploration of the mechanisms that transform reward-based positive reinforcement into maladaptive drug seeking.","Bobadilla, Ana-Clara; Dereschewitz, Eric; Vaccaro, Lucio; Heinsbroek, Jasper A; Scofield, Michael D; Kalivas, Peter W",Mol. psychiatry,,114
296436,Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA BNT162b2 Covid-19 vaccine protection against variants of concern after one versus two doses,2021,"BACKGROUND: In nursing home residents (NHRs), polypharmacy is widespread, accompanied by elevated risks of medication related complications. Managing medication in NHRs is a priority, but prone to several challenges, including interprofessional cooperation. Against this background, we implemented and tested an interprofessional intervention aimed to improve medication appropriateness for NHRs. METHODS: A non-randomized controlled study (SiMbA; ""Sicherheit der Medikamentherapie bei AltenheimbewohnerInnen"", Safety of medication therapy in NHRs) was conducted in six nursing homes in Austria (2016-2018). Educational training, introduction of tailored health information technology (HIT) and a therapy check process were combined in an intervention aimed at healthcare professionals. Medication appropriateness was assessed using the Medication Appropriateness Index (MAI). Data was collected before (t0), during (t1, month 12) and after (t2, month 18) intervention via self-administered assessments and electronic health records. RESULTS: We included 6 NHs, 17 GPs (52.94% female) and 240 NHRs (68.75% female; mean age 85.0). Data of 159 NHRs could be included in the analysis. Mean MAI-change was - 3.35 (IG) vs. - 1.45 (CG). In the subgroup of NHRs with mean MAI &#8805;23, MAI-change was - 10.31 (IG) vs. -3.52 (CG). The intervention was a significant predictor of improvement in MAI when controlled for in a multivariable regression model. CONCLUSIONS: Improvement of medication appropriateness was clearest in residents with inappropriate baseline MAI-scores. This improvement was independent of variances in certain covariates between the intervention and the control group. We conclude that our intervention is a feasible approach to improve NHRs' medication appropriateness. TRIAL REGISTRATION: DRKS Data Management, ID: DRKS00012246 .

The aim of this study was to assess the impact of COVID-19-related public health measures on orthopaedic presentations to a regional Australian hospital. METHODS: A case-control study was performed at a regional trauma hospital in New South Wales (NSW), Australia. Data was collected prospectively from patients that required orthopaedic review in the period corresponding to a declaration of a global pandemic to the end of the NSW lockdown, and compared with retrospective data from the corresponding period in 2019. The five-year average of orthopaedic presentations to ED during the study period were obtained for comparison. The primary outcomes were overall number of presentations, mechanism and anatomical location of injuries, operative versus non-operative management and disposition. RESULTS: During the study period in 2020, presentations requiring orthopaedic review were significantly more frequent than 2019 (496 vs. 280, p < 0.0001), with more requiring admission in 2020 (p < 0.0001). The absolute number of patients managed operatively was higher (p = 0.0002) and significantly more patients were referred for community follow-up (p < 0.0001). There was a 20% increase of consults in 2020 compared to the average number of referrals during the same period in the previous five years. CONCLUSIONS: Contrary to other published literature, lockdown conditions imposed during the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a surprising 77% increase in orthopaedic presentations to this regional Australian hospital. These findings can be used to better direct resources, preparation and staff education in the current and for future pandemics.","Woo, Elise; Smith, Ariella Jessica; Mah, Dominic; Pfister, Benjamin Francis; Drobetz, Herwig",ANZ j.

However, the training of end-to-end neural-based medical dialogue system is restricted by an insufficient quantity of medical dialogue corpus. In this work, we make the first attempt to build and release a large-scale high-quality Medical Dialogue dataset related to 12 types of common Gastrointestinal diseases named MedDG, with more than 17K conversations collected from the online health consultation community. Five different categories of entities, including diseases, symptoms, attributes, tests, and medicines, are annotated in each conversation of MedDG as additional labels. To push forward the future research on building expert-sensitive medical dialogue system, we proposes two kinds of medical dialogue tasks based on MedDG dataset. One is the next entity prediction and the other is the doctor response generation. To acquire a clear comprehension on these two medical dialogue tasks, we implement several state-of-the-art benchmarks, as well as design two dialogue models with a further consideration on the predicted entities. Experimental results show that the pre-train language models and other baselines struggle on both tasks with poor performance in our dataset, and the response quality can be enhanced with the help of auxiliary entity information. From human evaluation, the simple retrieval model outperforms several state-of-the-art generative models, indicating that there still remains a large room for improvement on generating medically meaningful responses.","Liu, Wenge; Tang, Jianheng; Qin, Jinghui; Xu, Lin; Li, Zhen; Liang, Xiaodan",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.07497v1.pdf,114
300943,Natural mucosal barriers and COVID-19 in children,2021,"The reemergence of coronavirus prompts the need for the development of effective therapeutics to prevent the cellular entry and replication of coronavirus. This study demonstrated the putative inhibitory potential of lopinavir, remdesivir, oseltamir, azithromycin, ribavirin, and chloroquine towards V-ATPase, protein kinase A, SARS-CoV spike glycoprotein/ACE-2 complex and viral proteases. The pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties were predicted through the pkCSM server while the corresponding binding affinity of the selected drugs towards the proteins was computed using AutodockVina Screening tool. The ADMET properties revealed all the drugs possess drug-like properties. Lopinavir has the highest binding affinities to the pocket site of SARS-CoV spike glycoprotein/ACE-2 complex, cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase A and 3-Chymotrypsin like protease while redemsivir has the highest binding affinities for vacuolar proton-translocating ATPase (V-ATPase) and papain-like proteins. The amino acids Asp269, Leu370, His374, and His345 were predicted as the key residues for lopinavir binding to human SARS-CoV spike glycoprotein/ACE-2 complex while His378, Tyr515, Leu73, Leu100, Phe32 and Phe40 for remdesivir and Tyr510, Phe504, Met62, Tyr50, and His378 were predicted for azithromycin as the key residues for binding to SARS-CoV spike glycoprotein/ACE-2 complex. Moreover, it was also observed that chloroquine has appreciable binding affinities for 3-Chymotrpsin- like protease and cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase A when compared to Oseltamivir and ribavirin. The study provided evidence suggesting putative repurposing of the selected drugs for the development of valuable drugs for the prevention of cellular entry and replication of coronavirus.

SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: On March 15, 2020, the VA issued a nationwide order to temporarily pause elective cases due to COVID-19. The effects of this disruption on patient outcomes are not yet known. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study used data from the VA Corporate Data Warehouse. Surgical procedures canceled due to COVID-19 in 2020 (n = 3326) were matched to similar completed procedures in 2018 (n = 151,863) and 2019 (n = 146,582). Outcome measures included 30- and 90-day VA ED use and mortality in the period following the completed or canceled procedure. We used exact matching on surgical procedure category and nearest neighbor matching on patient characteristics, procedure year, and facility. RESULTS: Patients with elective surgical procedures canceled due to COVID-19 were no more likely to have an ED visit in the 30- [Difference: -4.3% pts; 95% confidence interval (CI): -0.078, -0.007] and 90âdays (-0.9% pts; 95% CI: -0.068, 0.05) following the expected case date. Patients with cancellations had no difference in 30- (Difference: 0.1% pts; 95% CI: -0.008, 0.01) and 90-day (Difference: -0.4% pts; 95% CI: -0.016, 0.009) mortality rates when compared to similar patients with similar procedures that were completed in previous years. CONCLUSIONS: The pause in elective surgical cases was not associated with short-term adverse outcomes in VA hospitals, suggesting appropriate surgical case triage and management. Further study will be essential to determine if the delayed cases were associated with longer-term effects.","Tran, Linda Diem; Rose, Liam; Urech, Tracy; Dalton, Aaron; Wu, Siqi; Vashi, Anita A",Ann Surg,,114

301891,Covid-19 - A Reminder to Reason,2020,"BACKGROUND: The 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic is a public health emergency of international concern and poses a challenge to the mental health and sleep quality of front-line medical staff (FMS). The aim of this study was to investigate the sleep quality of FMS during the COVID-19 outbreak in China and analyze the relationship between mental health and sleep quality of FMS. METHODS: From February 24, 2020 to March 22, 2020, a cross-sectional study was performed with 543 FMS from a medical center in Western China. A self-reported questionnaire was used to collect data anonymously. The following tests were used: The Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) for symptoms of anxiety, the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) for depressive symptoms, and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) for sleep quality assessment. RESULTS: Of the 543 FMS, 216 (39.8%) were classified as subjects with poor sleep quality. Anxiety (P<0.001), depression (P<0.001), and the prevalence of those divorced or widowed (P<0.05) were more common in FMS with poor sleep quality than in participants with good sleep quality. The FMS exhibiting co-occurrence of anxiety and depression were associated with worse scores on sleep quality than those medical staff in the other three groups/categories. The difference in sleep quality between the FMS with only depression and the FMS experiencing co-occurrence of anxiety and depression was statistically significant (P<0.05). However, there was no significant difference in sleep quality between the FMS experiencing only anxiety and the FMS with co-occurrence of anxiety and depression (P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: During the COVID-19 pandemic, there was a noteworthy increase in the prevalence of negative emotions and sentiments among the medical staff, along with poor overall sleep quality. We anticipate that this study can stimulate more research into the mental state of FMS during outbreaks and other public health emergencies. In addition, particular attention must be paid to enhance the sleep quality of FMS, along with better planning and support for FMS who are continuously exposed to the existing viral epidemic by virtue of the nature of their profession.","Yue, Leiyu; Zhao, Rui; Xiao, Qingqing; Zhuo, Yu; Yu, Jianying; Meng, Xiandong",PLoS One,,114

302495,At one's fingertips: can you nail the diagnosis?,2021,"OBJECTIVE: To determine how neurology departments and residency programs in the United States used virtual communication to adapt to the COVID-19 pandemic, we investigated the presence and use of social media pages, virtual outreach events, and virtual internship opportunities. METHODS: Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook accounts were identified (or noted as nonexistent) for 159 accredited neurology departments and residency programs. Google searches and social media site specific searches were performed. For existing pages, the date of creation was determined and all posts on and after March 1st, 2020, were assessed to investigate the presence of virtual open house advertisements. Each program was also assessed for virtual sub-internship and elective opportunities on the Visiting Student Application Service (VSAS). RESULTS: A majority of neurology residency programs (110) had a social media presence, particularly on Twitter and Instagram. Most residency program Twitter and Instagram accounts were created after March 1st, 2020, and this was not the case on Facebook. Twitter and Instagram were used most to advertise virtual opportunities. A correlation was observed between presence and number of social media accounts and program prestige. Few programs offered virtual opportunities on VSAS for the 2020-2021 year. CONCLUSION: Neurology residency programs adapted to the COVID-19 pandemic by creating residency social media accounts, primarily on Instagram and Twitter, and hosting virtual informational events. We recommend that neurology residency applicants create professional Instagram and Twitter accounts to network with programs and receive updates about virtual events. Similarly, going forward, we recommend continued social media use by neurology residency programs for applicant outreach.","Gaini, Rahul R; Patel, Kush M; Khan, Saad A; Singh, Nikhi P; Love, Marissa Natelson",Clin Neurol Neurosurg,,114

AIMS: We aimed to characterize the adverse skin reactions occurring after hand hygiene and glove use in HCWs in a tertiary university hospital to determine the possible causative factors and whether the use of these measures is affected. METHODS: Between April 15 and May 1, 2020, a cross-sectional survey was conducted, using online questionnaire, answered by HCWs in a tertiary university hospital. RESULTS: The increase in general hand-skin problems during the pandemic period was statistically significant (P = .004). The most common symptom was dryness. During the pandemic period, 67 (24.3%) HCWs thought that the conditions were caused by glove use, and 197 (71.4%) thought that they were due to alcohol-based hand antiseptics. The incidence of other hand-skin conditions except for vesicles was statistically higher in women than in men (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Increased number of hand-skin conditions during the pandemic should not be ignored, since hand hygiene and glove use are expected to increase.","Altunisik Toplu, Sibel; Altunisik, Nihal; Turkmen, Dursun; Ersoy, Yasemin",J. cosmet. dermatol,,114

304331,The Oncology Family Forum: Collaborating With Families to Codesign Pediatric Oncology Services,2020,"BACKGROUND: In the UK, consultations for prescription medicines are available via private providers such as online pharmacies. However, these providers may have lower thresholds for prescribing certain drugs. This is a particular concern for antibiotics, given the increasing burden of antimicrobial resistance. Public preferences for consultations with online providers are unknown, hence the impact of increased availability of online consultations on antibiotic use and population health is unclear. OBJECTIVE: To conduct a discrete choice experiment survey to understand UK public preferences for seeking online consultations, and the factors that influence these preferences, in the context of having symptoms for which antibiotics may be appropriate. METHODS: In a survey conducted between July and August 2018, general population respondents completed 16 questions in which they chose a primary care consultation via either their local medical centre or an online provider. Consultations were described in terms of five attributes, including cost and similarity to traditional 'face-to-face' appointments. Choices were modelled using regression analysis. RESULTS: Respondents (n = 734) placed a high value on having a consultation via their local medical centre rather than an online provider, and a low value on consultations by phone or video. However, respondents characterised as 'busy young professionals' showed a lower strength of preference for traditional consultations, with a higher concern for convenience. CONCLUSION: Before COVID-19, the UK public had limited appetite for consultations with online providers, or for consultations that were not face-to-face. Nevertheless, prescriptions from online providers should be monitored going forward, particularly for antibiotics, and in key patient groups.","Buchanan, James; Roope, Laurence S J; Morrell, Liz; Pouwels, Koen B; Robotham, Julie V; Abel, Lucy; Crook, Derrick W; Peto, Tim; Butler, Christopher C; Walker, A Sarah; Wordsworth, Sarah",Appl Health Econ Health Policy,,114
304559,"COVID-19, Mast Cells, Cytokine Storm, Psychological Stress, and Neuroinflammation",2020,"We present a method for real-time stereo scene capture and remote VR visualization that allows a human operator to freely move their head and thus intuitively control their perspective during teleoperation. The stereo camera is mounted on a 6D robotic arm, which follows the operator's head pose. Existing VR teleoperation systems either induce high latencies on head movements, leading to motion sickness, or use scene reconstruction methods to allow re-rendering of the scene from different perspectives, which cannot handle dynamic scenes effectively. Instead, we present a decoupled approach which renders captured camera images as spheres, assuming constant distance. This allows very fast re-rendering on head pose changes while keeping the resulting temporary distortions during head translations small. We present qualitative examples, quantitative results in the form of lab experiments and a small user study, showing that our method outperforms other visualization methods.","Schwarz, Max; Behnke, Sven",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.11373v1.pdf,114

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Reports on the clinical manifestations in solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients are rare. We report the clinical features and treatment of a Chinese renal transplant recipient with COVID-19. A 46-year-old Chinese woman, who had a renal transplant in 2006 due to chronic glomerulonephritis, was admitted to Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University for fever, cough, and expectoration for more than 10 days and diarrhea for 3 days. At admission, her body temperature was 38.2 ℃ and pulse oxygen saturation was 96% under oxygen inhalation. There were decreased breath sounds bilaterally. Laboratory data revealed normal leucocyte count, a normal percentage of neutrophils, a normal percentage of lymphocytes, decreased lymphocyte count, elevated procalcitonin and C-reactive protein (CRP), and increased levels of urea, creatinine, and estimated glomerular filtration rate. COVID-19 was confirmed by nasopharyngeal swab and sputum which were positive for SARS-CoV-2 by real-time reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR). Chest CT revealed multiple patchy and flake ground-glass shadows in bilateral lung fields, and strip shadows in bilateral lower lobes. Treatment included antiviral (umifenovir, hydroxychloroquine), antibacterial (moxifloxacin), and other support therapies. Her symptoms, laboratory data, and chest CT showed trends of gradual improvement, while nasopharyngeal swabs were always positive for SARS-CoV-2. She was finally discharged from hospital on her 70th day of hospitalization when 2 consecutive nasopharyngeal swabs were negative for SARS-CoV-2. This is a rare report on COVID-19 in a renal transplant recipient, which can help enhance the understanding and treatment of COVID-19 in renal transplant recipients.","Wu, J.; Xiong, L.; Li, P.",Translational Andrology and Urology,,114

Till date, SARS-CoV-2 infection is still spreading, representing a major threat to public health, where several control measures are being practiced in order to culminate its spread. The research and development of new drugs require a lot of funding in addition to being a slow and costly process. As a result, new techniques have been proposed to streamline this process. The repositioning or repurposing of drugs represents an attractive strategy, presenting a promising way to introduce new drugs. Currently, numerous reused drugs are already available in the market and are in practice. In this review, it was observed that the antiviral drugs Entricitabine and Tenofovir display potential therapeutic efficacy in preclinical studies. Therefore, in silico analyses were considered a potential tool for predicting the effectiveness of drugs, mainly as an effective approach to encourage a complementary in vitro and in vivo antiviral evaluation.","Rocha, Yasmim Mendes; de Moura, Gabriel Acácio; de Oliveira, Juliana Ramos; de Figueiredo Nicolete, Larissa Deadame; Nicolete, Roberto",Curr. med. chem,,114

So far, cancer screening has been a causality of COVID-19; however, the opposite may transpire for self-sampling. Self-sampling enables socially distanced cervical screening with an outreach that extends to underserved populations. As evidence mounts that self-sampling is noninferior to clinician-taken samples, the focus for self-sampling is now as a primary screening option for all women. Now, we have evidence from a modeling study (using Australia as an exemplar) to suggest that program effectiveness with primary self-sampling would be better than the current program, even if sensitivity is lower. Regulatory issues, suitable triage strategies, and clear communication about self-sampling are hurdles yet to be overcome. Nevertheless, existing evidence coupled with COVID-19 could be the tipping point for wider introduction of self-sampling.See related article by Smith et al., p. 268.","Lim, Anita W W",Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev,,114

This study investigated the feasibility and accuracy of a sample pooling approach for wide-scale population screening for coronavirus disease 2019. A total of 940 nasopharyngeal swab samples (934 negative and 6 positive) previously tested for SARS-CoV-2 were deidentified and assigned random numbers for analysis, and 94 pools of 10 samples each were generated. Automated RNA extraction, followed by RT-PCR, was performed in a 96-well plate. Positive pools were identified, and the individual samples were reanalyzed. Of the 94 pools/wells, four were positive [Ct values: N (22.7 to 28.3), ORF1ab (23.3 to 27.2), and internal control (34.4 to 35.4)]. The 40 samples comprising the four pools were identified and reanalyzed individually; six samples were positive, with Ct values of N gene, ORF1ab, and internal control comparable to their respective wells. Additional experiments were performed on samples with high Ct values, and overall results showed 91.6% positive and 100% negative agreement compared with individual testing approach. Thus, 940 samples were tested in 148 reactions compared with 940 reactions in routine screening.

COVID-19 is associated with increased hypoxemia and desaturation on exertion. We hypothesized that desaturation after 1-minute sit-to-stand test (1MSTS), a validated field exercise test can serve as a potential marker for triage of COVID 19 patients. Methods Subjects with proven COVID 19 without hypoxemia on ambient air at presentation underwent the 1MSTS. The demographic details, clinical profile, pre and post-test vitals and pulse oximetric saturation was recorded and they were followed up for outcome throughout the hospital stay and after discharge. Results 55 mild cases of COVID-19 and 6 cases of recovering severe COVID-19 were included. The mild cohort had a median age of 35 years (IQR,27-41.5) and a median hospital stay of 16 days (IQR 14,20). The severe cohort had a median age of 47.5 years (IQR, 42.3,54.3) and median intensive care and hospital stays of respectively 9 (IQR, 7.5,9) and 23.5 (IQR, 21.5,27) days. The two cohorts showed median desaturations of 0% (IQR, 0.5-1) and 5.5% (IQR, 4.3-6) respectively. No subjects in the mild cohort needed oxygen therapy or escalation of care to intensive care.

311378,Feasibility of Augmented Reality-Guided Transjugular Intrahepatic Portosystemic Shunt,2020,"The importance of a strict quarantine has been widely debated during the COVID-19 epidemic even from the purely epidemiological point of view. One argument against strict lockdown measures is that once the strict quarantine is lifted, the epidemic comes back, and so the cumulative number of infected individuals during the entire epidemic will stay the same. We consider an SIR model on a network and follow the disease dynamics, modeling the phases of quarantine by changing the node degree distribution. We show that the system reaches different steady states based on the history: the outcome of the epidemic is path-dependent despite the same final node degree distribution. The results indicate that two-phase route to the final node degree distribution (a strict phase followed by a soft phase) are always better than one phase (the same soft one) unless all the individuals have the same number of connections at the end (the same degree); in the latter case, the overall number of infected is indeed history-independent. The modeling also suggests that the optimal procedure of lifting the quarantine consists of releasing nodes in the order of their degree - highest first.","Nimmagadda, Varun; Kogan, Oleg; Khain, Evgeniy",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.13826v1.pdf,114
311732,Delay to elective colorectal cancer surgery and implications for survival: a systematic review and meta-analysis,2021,"BACKGROUND: Since there was no proven treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), hydroxychloroquine-azithromycin (HCQ-AZM) combination is being used in different countries as a treatment option. Many controversies exist related to the safety and effectiveness of this combination, and questions about how HCQ-AZM combination affects the ventricular repolarization are still unknown. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to show whether the hydroxychloroquine-azithromycin (HCQ-AZM) combination prolonged Tpeak-to-end (TpTe) duration and TpTe/QT interval ratio or not. METHODS: One hundred and twenty-six consequent COVID-19(+) patients meeting the study criteria were enrolled in this study. Baseline ECGs were obtained immediately after hospitalization and before commencing the HCQ-AZM combination. On-treatment ECG was obtained 24-48 hr after the loading dose of HCQ/AZM. ECG parameters including PR interval, QRS duration, QT interval, QTc interval, TpTe duration, and TpTe/QT interval ratio were assessed. Demographic and laboratory findings were collected from an electronic recording system. RESULTS: ECGs of 126 COVID-19(+) patients who received HCQ-AZM combination were assessed. Mean baseline QTc (by Fridericia formula), TpTe, and TpTe/QT ratio were 420.0 ± 26.5 ms, 82.43 ± 9.77 ms, and 0.22 ± 0.02, respectively. On-treatment QTc, TpTe and TpTe/QT ratio were 425.7 ± 27.18 ms, 85.17 ± 11.17 ms, and 0.22 ± 0.03, respectively. No statistically significant acute impacts of HCQ-AZM combination on TpTe duration and TpTe/QT interval ratio were observed compared with baseline values. No ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation and the significant conduction delays were seen during in-hospital follow-up. CONCLUSION: HCQ-AZM combination increased TpTe duration. However, no significant impact on TpTe/QT interval ratio was observed.","Bakhshaliyev, Nijad; Özdemir, Ramazan",Ann Noninvasive Electrocardiol,,114
311788,Assessment of humoral responses in COVID-19 using various quantitative antibody tests,2021,"The capability of generalization to unseen domains is crucial for deep learning models when considering real-world scenarios. However, current available medical image datasets, such as those for COVID-19 CT images, have large variations of infections and domain shift problems. To address this issue, we propose a prior knowledge driven domain adaptation and a dual-domain enhanced self-correction learning scheme. Based on the novel learning schemes, a domain adaptation based self-correction model (DASC-Net) is proposed for COVID-19 infection segmentation on CT images. DASC-Net consists of a novel attention and feature domain enhanced domain adaptation model (AFD-DA) to solve the domain shifts and a self-correction learning process to refine segmentation results. The innovations in AFD-DA include an image-level activation feature extractor with attention to lung abnormalities and a multi-level discrimination module for hierarchical feature domain alignment. The proposed self-correction learning process adaptively aggregates the learned model and corresponding pseudo labels for the propagation of aligned source and target domain information to alleviate the overfitting to noises caused by pseudo labels. Extensive experiments over three publicly available COVID-19 CT datasets demonstrate that DASC-Net consistently outperforms state-of-the-art segmentation, domain shift, and coronavirus infection segmentation methods. Ablation analysis further shows the effectiveness of the major components in our model. The DASC-Net enriches the theory of domain adaptation and self-correction learning in medical imaging and can be generalized to multi-site COVID-19 infection segmentation on CT images for clinical deployment.","Jin, Qiangguo; Cui, Hui; Sun, Changming; Meng, Zhaopeng; Wei, Leyi; Su, Ran",Expert Syst Appl,,114

312782,Highlights of the 15th annual scientific meeting of the Society of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography,2020,"Background Since the emergence of COVID-19 in December 2019, multidisciplinary research teams have wrestled with how best to control the pandemic in light of its considerable physical, psychological and economic damage. Mass testing has been advocated as a potential remedy;however, mass testing using physical tests is a costly and hard-to-scale solution. Methods This study demonstrates the feasibility of an alternative form of COVID-19 detection, harnessing digital technology through the use of audio biomarkers and deep learning. Specifically, we show that a deep neural network based model can be trained to detect symptomatic and asymptomatic COVID-19 cases using breath and cough audio recordings. Results Our model, a custom convolutional neural network, demonstrates strong empirical performance on a data set consisting of 355 crowdsourced participants, achieving an area under the curve of the receiver operating characteristics of 0.846 on the task of COVID-19 classification. Conclusion This study offers a proof of concept for diagnosing COVID-19 using cough and breath audio signals and motivates a comprehensive follow-up research study on a wider data sample, given the evident advantages of a low-cost, highly scalable digital COVID-19 diagnostic tool. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2021.

313295,Why COVID-19 virus is so deadly to cancer patients?,2020,"BackgroundIn the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, confidence in the government and access to accurate information have been critical to the control of outbreaks. Although outbreaks have emerged amongst communities of international migrant workers worldwide, little is known about how they perceive the governments response or their exposure to rumors. MethodsBetween 22 June to 11 October 2020, we surveyed 1011 low-waged migrant workers involved in dormitory outbreaks within Singapore. Participants reported their confidence in the government; whether they had heard, shared, or believed widely-disseminated COVID-19 rumors; and their socio-demographics. Logistic regression models were fitted to identify factors associated with confidence and rumor exposure. Results1 in 2 participants (54.2%, 95% CI: 51.1-57.3%) reported that they believed at least one COVID-19 rumor. This incidence was higher than that observed in the general population for the host country (Singapore). Nonetheless, most participants (90.0%, 95% CI: 87.6-91.5%) reported being confident that the government could control the spread of COVID-19. Age was significantly associated with belief in rumors, while educational level was associated with confidence in government. ConclusionsOur findings suggest that language and cultural differences may limit the access that migrant workers have to official COVID-19 updates. Correspondingly, public health agencies should use targeted messaging strategies to promote health knowledge within migrant worker communities.","Tan, Edina YQ; Albarazi, Dalia; Saw, Young Ern; Buvanaswari, P; Doshi, Kinjal; Liu, Jean CJ",,,114
313421,The perplexing question of trained immunity versus adaptive memory in COVID-19,2020,"Immunotherapy has been a new standard for recurrent/metastatic head and neck cancers (R/M HNC). One of the prominent characteristics of cancer immunotherapy is the induction of immune memory followed by endured treatment response. However, whether and how a treatment delay would impact on the efficacy of immunotherapy has not been well determined. During the outbreak of COVID-19, a number of cancer patients in Wuhan, the epicenter of the pandemic in China, had experienced long-lasting city lockdown and delay of immunotherapies. Here, we retrospectively analyzed 24 HNC patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors in our cancer institute prior to the outbreak of COVID-19 who were re-evaluated after the restoration of regular medical care. Of these 24 patients, 10 patients had achieved complete response (CR) or partial response (PR), 12 patients had achieved stable disease (SD), and 2 patients had received just one cycle treatment without efficacy evaluation before treatment delay. The median delay was 3.75 months (range 1.73-8.17 months). Re-evaluation after treatment delay revealed that ten patients (10/10) who achieved CR or PR, two patients (2/2) who received just one cycle treatment without efficacy evaluation and seven patients (7/12) who achieved SD before outbreak of COVID-19 maintained tumor response after treatment delay. Among the rest five patients who had achieved SD, four patients were re-evaluated as progressive disease (PD) due to treatment delay and one patient died after treatment interruption without re-evaluation. Our results from a small cohort of R/M HNC patients showed that treatment delay of three to four months might have mild, if any, impact on the efficacy of immunotherapy for patients with controlled disease.","Chen, Gaili; Wu, Qiuji; Jiang, Huangang; Li, Zheng; Hua, Xinying; Hu, Xiaoyan; Yu, Haijun; Xie, Conghua; Zhong, Yahua",J Hematol Oncol,,114

317077,Feasibility of lung imaging with a large field-of-view spectral photon-counting CT system,2021,"COVID-19 is associated with a wide range of extrarespiratory complications, of which the pathogenesis is currently not fully understood. However, both systemic spread and systemic inflammatory responses are thought to contribute to the systemic pathogenesis. In this study, we determined the temporal kinetics of viral RNA in serum (RNAemia) and the associated inflammatory cytokines and chemokines during the course of COVID-19 in hospitalized patients. We show that RNAemia can be detected in 90% of the patients who develop critical disease, compared to 50% of the patients who develop moderate or severe disease. Furthermore, RNAemia lasts longer in patients who develop critical disease. Elevated levels of interleukin-10 (IL-10) and MCP-1-but not IL-6-are associated with viral load in serum, whereas higher levels of IL-6 in serum were associated with the development of critical disease. In conclusion, RNAemia is common in hospitalized patients, with the highest frequency and duration in patients who develop critical disease. The fact that several cytokines or chemokines are directly associated with the presence of viral RNA in the circulation suggests that the development of RNAemia is an important factor in the systemic pathogenesis of COVID-19. IMPORTANCE Severe COVID-19 can be considered a systemic disease as many extrarespiratory complications occur. However, the systemic pathogenesis is poorly understood. Here, we show that the presence of viral RNA in the blood (RNAemia) occurs more frequently in patients who develop critical disease, compared to patients with moderate or severe disease. In addition, RNAemia is associated with increased levels of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, like MCP-1 and IL-10, in serum during the course of disease. This suggests that extrarespiratory spread of SARS-CoV-2 contributes to systemic inflammatory responses, which are an important factor in the systemic pathogenesis of COVID-19.","van Riel, Debby; Embregts, Carmen W E; Sips, Gregorius J; van den Akker, Johannes P C; Endeman, Henrik; van Nood, Els; Raadsen, Mathijs; Bauer, Lisa; van Kampen, Jeroen; Molenkamp, Richard; Koopmans, Marion; van de Vijver, David; GeurtsvanKessel, Corine H",mSphere,,114

318759,Letter: population mortality from COVID-19 and latitude-data from China,2020,"Plasmonic sensors are commonly defined on two-dimensional (2D) surfaces with an enhanced electromagnetic field only near the surface, which requires precise positioning of the targeted molecules within hotspots. To address this challenge, we realize segmented nanocylinders that incorporate plasmonic (1-50 nm) gaps within three-dimensional (3D) nanostructures (nanocylinders) using electron irradiation triggered self-assembly. The 3D structures allow desired plasmonic patterns on their inner cylindrical walls forming the nanofluidic channels. The nanocylinders bridge nanoplasmonics and nanofluidics by achieving electromagnetic field enhancement and fluid confinement simultaneously. This hybrid system enables rapid diffusion of targeted species to the larger spatial hotspots in the 3D plasmonic structures, leading to enhanced interactions that contribute to a higher sensitivity. This concept has been demonstrated by characterizing an optical response of the 3D plasmonic nanostructures using surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS), which shows enhancement over a 22 times higher intensity for hemoglobin fingerprints with nanocylinders compared to 2D nanostructures.","Dai, Chunhui; Lin, Zihao; Agarwal, Kriti; Mikhael, Carol; Aich, Anupam; Gupta, Kalpna; Cho, Jeong-Hyun",Nano lett,,114

The role of neutralizing antibody (NAb) response in disease progression remains elusive. This study determined the seroprevalence of 733 non-COVID-19 individuals from April 2018 to February 2020 in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and compared the neutralizing antibody (NAb) responses of eight COVID-19 patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with those of 42 patients not admitted to the ICU. We found that NAb against SARS-CoV-2 was not detectable in any of the anonymous serum specimens from the 733 non-COVID-19 individuals. The peak serum geometric mean NAb titer was significantly higher among the eight ICU patients than the 42 non-ICU patients (7280 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1468-36099]) vs (671 [95% CI, 368-1223]). Furthermore, NAb titer increased significantly at earlier infection stages among ICU patients than among non-ICU patients. The median number of days to reach the peak Nab titers after symptoms onset was shorter among the ICU patients (17.6) than that of the non-ICU patients (20.1). Multivariate analysis showed that oxygen requirement and fever during admission were the only clinical factors independently associated with higher NAb titers. Our data suggested that SARS-CoV-2 was unlikely to have silently spread before the COVID-19 emergence in Hong Kong. ICU patients had an accelerated and augmented NAb response compared to non-ICU patients, which was associated with disease severity.

We assessed occupational risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection among staff in six care homes experiencing a COVID-19 outbreak during the peak of the pandemic in London, England. METHODS: Care home staff were tested for SARS-COV-2 infection by RT-PCR and asked to report any symptoms, their contact with residents and if they worked in different care homes. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) was performed on RT-PCR positive samples. RESULTS: In total, 53 (21%) of 254 staff were SARS-CoV-2 positive but only 12/53 (23%) were symptomatic. Among staff working in a single care home, SARS-CoV-2 positivity was 15% (2/13), 16% (7/45) and 18% (30/169) in those reporting no, occasional and regular contact with residents. In contrast, staff working across different care homes (14/27, 52%) had a 3.0-fold (95% CI, 1.9-4.8; P<0.001) higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 positivity than staff working in single care homes (39/227, 17%). WGS identified SARS-CoV-2 clusters involving staff only, including some that included staff working across different care homes. CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 positivity was significantly higher among staff working across different care homes than those who were working in the same care home. We found local clusters of SARS-CoV-2 infection between staff only, including those with minimal resident contact. Infection control should be extended for all contact, including those between staff, whilst on care home premises.","Ladhani, Shamez N; Chow, J Yimmy; Janarthanan, Roshni; Fok, Jonathan; Crawley-Boevey, Emma; Vusirikala, Amoolya; Fernandez, Elena; Perez, Marina Sanchez; Tang, Suzanne; Dun-Campbell, Kate; Wynne-Evans, Edward; Bell, Anita; Patel, Bharat; Amin-Chowdhury, Zahin; Aiano, Felicity; Paranthaman, Karthik; Ma, Thomas; Saavedra-Campos, Maria; Myers, Richard; Ellis, Joanna; Lackenby, Angie; Gopal, Robin; Patel, Monika; Chand, Meera; Brown, Kevin; Hopkins, Susan; Consortium, CoG; Shetty, Nandini; Zambon, Maria; Ramsay, Mary E",J Infect,,114

322939,Two-month stop in mammographic screening significantly impacts on breast cancer stage at diagnosis and upfront treatment in the COVID era,2021,"Outbreaks of COVID-19 among nursing homes, assisted living facilities, and other long-term care facilities in the United States have had devastating effects on residents. Restrictions such as banning visitors, sequestering residents, and testing health care staff have been implemented to mitigate the spread of the virus. However, consequences include a decline in mental and physical health, decompensation, and a sense of hopelessness among residents. We present and explore a case study at an assisted living facility addressing the ethical issues in balancing the management of the community versus the resident's right to autonomy and self-determination. A team of palliative care experts was brought into assisted living facilities to manage patients, care for well residents, and provide input in advance care planning and symptom management. The principles of self-determination and autonomy, stewardship, and distributive justice were explored. The use of nursing skills in triage and assessment, principles in public health, and the 8 domains of palliative care provided a comprehensive framework for structuring emergency operations. Palliative interventions and the role of palliative care nurses played an integral part in addressing ethical challenges in the containment of the virus and the deleterious effects of social isolation among the elderly.","Parekh de Campos, Amisha; Daniels, Susan",J Hosp Palliat Nurs,,114

Histopathology of invasive Aspergillus tracheobronchitis in patients with severe COVID-19 confirms tracheal ulcers with tissue invasion of Aspergillus hyphae but without angioinvasion, which differs from patients with severe influenza, where early angioinvasion is observed. We argue that aggregation of predisposing factors (eg, factors that are defined by the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer and Mycoses Study Group Education and Research Consortium or genetic polymorphisms), viral factors (eg, tropism and lytic effects), immune defence factors, and effects of concomitant therapies will determine whether and when the angioinvasion threshold is reached. Management of invasive Aspergillus tracheobronchitis should include reducing viral lytic effects, rebalancing immune dysregulation, and systemic and local antifungal therapy . Future study designs should involve approaches that aim to develop improved diagnostics for tissue invasion and airways involvement and identify the immune status of the patient to guide personalised immunotherapy.","Veerdonk, F.

324317,COVID-19 and stroke in the latin american stroke registry (lase),2021,"COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by the most recently discovered coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). The virus and disease were unknown before the outbreak began in the city of Wuhan, China, in December 2019. Nigeria and other sub-Sahara Africa countries like the rest of the world introduced several lockdown measures as part of their public health response to mitigate the spread of the virus. This, however, was not without the likelihood of consequences considering the weak health systems. The access and supply side of vaccination was more likely to have been affected by the lockdown measures. When vaccination services are disrupted even for brief periods during emergencies, the risk of outbreak-prone vaccine-preventable diseases increases, leading to excess morbidity and mortality. This highlights the importance of maintaining essential services such as vaccination in times of emergency. There is therefore an urgent need to ensure that children are protected against those diseases for which vaccines already exist. The COVID-19 outbreak has posed a new hindrance to vaccination activities in Nigeria and across Sub-Saharan Africa with associated threat to surveillance of vaccine-preventable diseases. Achieving and sustaining high levels of vaccination coverage during this period must, therefore, be a priority for all health systems.","Ogundele, Olorunfemi Akinbode; Omotoso, Ayodeji Andrew; Fagbemi, Aderonke Tolulope",Hum Vaccin Immunother,,114
326170,The reason for this number,2020,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 resulted in considerable mental health burden in the Chinese general population and among health care workers at the beginning and peak of the pandemic. However, little is known about potentially vulnerable groups during the final stage of the lockdown. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this survey study was to assess the mental health burden of different professions in China in order to find vulnerable groups, possible influencing factors, and successful ways of coping during the last 4 weeks of the lockdown in Hubei Province. METHODS: A cross-sectional online survey asked participants about current residence, daily working hours, exposure to COVID-19 at work, and media preferences. We used a shortened version of the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21) to assess mental health. Further assessments included perceived stress (Simplified Chinese version of the 14-item Perceived Stress Scale), coping strategies for all participants, and specific stressors for health care workers. We followed the reporting guidelines of the STROBE (Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology) statement for observational studies. RESULTS: The sample (N=687) consisted of 158 doctors, 221 nurses, 24 other medical staff, 43 students, 60 teachers/government staff, 135 economy staff, 26 workers/farmers, and 20 professions designated under the ""other"" category. We found increased depression (n=123, 17.9%), anxiety (n=208, 30.3%), and stress (n=94, 13.7%) in our sample. Professions that were vulnerable to depression were other medical staff and students. Doctors, nurses, and students were vulnerable to anxiety; and other medical staff, students, and economy staff were vulnerable to stress. Coping strategies were reduced to three factors: active, mental, and emotional. Being female and emotional coping were independently associated with depression, anxiety, or stress. Applying active coping strategies showed lower odds for anxiety while mental coping strategies showed lower odds for depression, anxiety, and stress. Age, being inside a lockdown area, exposure to COVID-19 at work, and having a high workload (8-12 hours per day) were not associated with depression, anxiety, or stress. WeChat was the preferred way of staying informed across all groups. CONCLUSIONS: By the end of the lockdown, a considerable part of the Chinese population showed increased levels of depression and anxiety. Students and other medical staff were the most affected, while economy staff were highly stressed. Doctors and nurses need support regarding potential anxiety disorders. Future work should focus on longitudinal results of the pandemic and develop targeted preventive measures.","Du, Junfeng; Mayer, Gwendolyn; Hummel, Svenja; Oetjen, Neele; Gronewold, Nadine; Zafar, Ali; Schultz, Jobst-Hendrik",J Med Internet Res,,114

In the study, we aimed to dissect the dynamic profile and clinical implications of hematological findings in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Methods We retrospectively analyzed the hematological findings of 72 patients with COVID-19 admitted from January 21 to February 17, 2020. The final date of follow-up was March 20, 2020. Dynamic profile of vital hematological parameters in severe and non-severe patients was presented at different time points (day 1, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15 after admission), and the correlation of hematological parameters with hospitalization time was indicated. Results Of 72 patients with COVID-19, lymphopenia and leukopenia occurred in 39 (54.2%) and 20 (27.8%) patients with COVID-19, respectively. Fifteen (20.8%) patients were defined as severe cases and 57 (79.2%) were non-severe cases. Compared to non-severe patients, leukocyte count, neutrophil count and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) were significantly higher, whereas lymphocyte count was declined in severe patients at each time point. A growing trend in platelet count was found in non-severe patients over the follow-up period. In addition, a positive correlation of NLR with hospitalization time was detected from day 5 after admission. Conclusions Dynamic changes in vital hematological parameters from severe and non-severe patients had been characterized in the course of hospitalization. During hospitalization, NLR was found to have certain relevance to the hospitalization days and a role in forecasting disease prognosis for patients with COVID-19.","Ding, Xiurong; Yu, Yanhua; Lu, Bichao; Huo, Jianbo; Chen, Ming; Kang, Yanfang; Lou, Jinli; Liu, Zhizhong",Clin Chem Lab Med,,114

326670,A Perspective on Personalized Therapies in Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy,2021,"PurposeThe CoViD-19 pandemic has brought about a panoply of institutional challenges both domestically and in the international arena. Classical constitutional theory thereby underwent a reinvention by the executive for the sake of speedy policy action and to the detriment of institutional control while favouring authoritarian forms of governance. This paper concerns itself with institutional responses to such developments, placing emphasis on the role of the judiciary and people*s in contesting emergency decrees and other executive orders, especially where fundamental rights are infringed upon. The paper aims to explore the difficulties arising with exerting absolute executive powers during the health crisis, the respective role assumed by constitutional courts and the impact of the new governance paradigm on forms of public contestation, also as a means of quasi institutional control.Design/methodology/approachIndeed, the right to health may be translated into political discourse and become foundational to security and public interest paradigms. This may result in a shrinking public space given the constraints to the freedom of movement. In the name of public safety, the (collective) right to assembly, expression and protest have been submitted to major limitations in that regard.FindingsUltimately, this re-opens debates on the meaning of absolute rights and contextualities of derogations, as well as the reconcilability of civil and political rights and economic, social and cultural rights. It also exposes social inequalities, social justice dimensions and vulnerabilities, often exacerbated by the health crisis;migrant rights demonstrably face particularly severe and intersectional forms of violations.Originality/valueParticular values lie with the interdisciplinary approach embraced in this paper;the authors draw on a variety of social sciences disciplines to shed light on this very current issue. Both theoretical and empirical methods are used and combined here, making sense of the underlying logic of virus governance and its impacts on fundamental rights.","Eichler, Jessika Sonkar Sumit",Review of Economics and Political Science,,114

Methods: Cross-sectional population-based study comprising 643 adults (39.6 ± 11.1 years, 44.9% men) from Florianópolis, Southern Brazil. Muscle strength was assessed by handgrip strength. Health variables included were systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP), waist circumference (WC), carotid intima-media thickness (IMT), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (CRP), total cholesterol (CHOL), HDL cholesterol (HDL-C), triglycerides (TRG), glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and insulin resistance index (HOMA-IR). Participants were grouped into three health status categories: 1) healthy (without CVD and risk for CVD); 2) at risk for CVD (obesity, high blood pressure and hyperglycemia); 3) with CVD. Multiple linear regression adjusted for confounding factors was used. Results: Muscle strength was inversely associated with IMT (ß = -0.02, SE: 0.03), CHOL (ß = -0.14, SE: 0.02) and HbA1c (ß = -0.01, SE: 0.10), and directly associated with SBP (ß = 0.16, SE: 0.06) and WC (ß = 0.02, SE: 0.03). Among adults with CVD, muscle strength was inversely associated with IMT (p < 0.05). Higher muscle strength was directly associated with SBP among healthy adults (p < 0.05). Conclusion: The main finding of the present study indicated that among individuals with CVD, muscle strength was associated with lower IMT values.","de Lima, Tiago Rodrigues; González-Chica, David Alejandro; Franco Moreno, Yara Maria; Santos Silva, Diego Augusto",,,114

331941,"AMWA-EMWA-ISMPP joint position statement on medical publications, preprints, and peer review",2021,"PROBLEM: Subinternships are integral to medical education as tools for teaching and assessing fourth-year medical students. Social distancing due to COVID-19 has precluded the ability to offer in-person subinternships - negatively impacting medical education and creating uncertainty surrounding the residency match. With no precedent for the development and implementation of virtual subinternships, the Society of Academic Urologists (SAU) developed an innovative and standardized curriculum for the Virtual Subinternship in Urology (vSIU). METHODS: The vSIU committee's mandate was to create a standardized curriculum for teaching foundational urology and assessing student performance. Thirty-three members from 23 institutions were divided into working groups and given 3 weeks to develop 10 modules based on urologic subspecialties, Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education core competencies, technical skills training and student assessment. Working groups were encouraged to develop innovative learning approaches. The final curriculum was assembled into the ""vSIU Guidebook."" RESULTS: The vSIU Guidebook contains 212 pages - 64 pages core content and 2 appendices (patient cases and evaluations). It outlines a detailed 4-week curriculum with a sufficient volume of resources to offer a completely adaptable virtual course with the same rigor as a traditional subinternship. Modules contain curated teaching resources including journal articles, lectures, surgical videos and simulated clinical scenarios. Innovative learning tools include reflective writing, mentorship guidelines, videoconference-based didactics, surgical simulcasting and virtual technical skills training. The guidebook was disseminated to program directors nationally. NEXT STEPS: The vSIU is the first virtual subinternship in any specialty to be standardized and offered nationally, and it was implemented by at least 19 urology programs. This curriculum serves as a template for other specialties looking to develop virtual programs and feedback from educators and students will allow the curriculum to evolve. As the pandemic continues to challenge our paradigm, this rapid and innovative response exemplifies that the medical community will continue to meet the needs of an ever-changing educational landscape.","Mikhail, David; Margolin, Ezra J; Sfakianos, John; Clifton, Marisa; Sorenson, Mathew; Thavaseelan, Simone; Haleblian, George; Kavoussi, Louis; Badalato, Gina M; Richstone, Lee",J. surg. educ,,114

Misinformation dissemination under the circumstances of the COVID-19 pandemic can be considered a cause of health-related anxieties and severe harm to the countries. The present study aims to explain factors related to the dissemination and acceptance of coronavirus misinformation in Iran. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This qualitative study was carried out through content analysis in the year 2020. The population included Iranian experts in Information and Communication Sciences, among whom 19 experts were selected through the purposive sampling method. The data were collected through semi-structured interviews and analyzed through Continuous Thematic Analysis. Such criteria authenticated data trustworthiness as credibility, confirmability, dependability, and transferability proposed by Guba and Lincoln. FINDINGS: Based on the experiences of participants, six major categories and 18 subcategories were identified regarding the major theme. The major categories included the official news and informing system, misinformation nature, users, media, misinformation source, and social determinants. CONCLUSION: Concurrent with the Covid-19 outbreak, a sort of information tsunami occurs. Unavoidably, a significant amount of misinformation regarding the various aspects of the virus, such as its origin, transmission methods, control, and treatment, are published. In many cases, the spreading information is not checked and verified in terms of accuracy and authenticity. The spread and acceptance of Covid-19 related misinformation happen under the impact of various factors. Being familiar with these factors will boost the culture of health and pave the path toward establishing evidence-based information public awareness schemes.","Taghipour, Faezeh; Ashrafi-Rizi, Hasan; Soleymani, Mohammad Reza",Int Q Community Health Educ,,114

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We collected the clinical data of patients with COVID-19 admitted to our hospital, by using logistic regression analysis and AUC curves, explored the relationship between biochemical indicators and nucleic acid positive duration, the severity of COVID-19, and hospital stay respectively. RESULTS: A total of two hundred and thirty-three patients with COVID-19 were enrolled in the study. We found patients whose nucleic acid turned negative within 14 days had lower LDH, CRP and higher ALB (P < 0.05). ROC curve results indicated that lower LDH, TP, CRP and higher ALB predicted the nucleic acid of patients turned negative within 14 days with statistical significance(P < 0.05), AST, LDH, CRP and PCT predicted the severe COVID-19 with statistical significance, and CRP predicted hospital stay >31days with statistical significance (P < 0.05). After verification, the probability of nucleic acid turning negative within 14 days in patients with low LDH (<256 U/L), CRP (<44.5 mg/L) and high ALB (>35.8 g/L) was about 4 times higher than that in patients with high LDH, CRP and low ALB (P < 0.05).

Rapid, accurate and early diagnosis of COVID-19 infection plays a crucial role in breaking this pandemic. However, the detection accuracy is limited for current single-gene diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2. Herein, we develop an autonomous lab-on-paper platform for multiplex gene diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 by combining reverse transcription recombinase polymerase amplification (RT-RPA) and CRISPR-Cas12a detection. The autonomous lab-on-paper is capable of simultaneously detecting nucleoprotein (N) gene and spike (S) gene of SARS-CoV-2 virus as well as human housekeeping RNAse P gene (an internal control) in a single clinical sample. With the developed platform, 102 copies viral RNA per test can be detected within one hour. Also, the lab-on-paper platform has been used to detect 21 swab clinical samples and obtains a comparable performance to the conventional RT-PCR method. Thus, the developed lab-on-paper platform holds great potential for rapid, sensitive, reliable, multiple molecular diagnostics of COVID-19 and other infectious diseases in resource-limited settings.","Yin, Kun; Ding, Xiong; Li, Ziyue; Sfeir, Maroun M; Ballesteros, Enrique; Liu, Changchun",Lab Chip,,114

We retrospectively reviewed the data of AMI patients admitted to the Nihon University Itabashi Hospital after a COVID-19 outbreak in 2020 (COVID-19 period) and the same period from 2017 to 2019 (control period). The patients' characteristics, time course of admission, diagnosis, and treatment of AMI, and 30-day mortality were compared between the two period-groups for both ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and non-STEMI (NSTEMI), respectively. The AMI inpatients decreased by 5.7% after the COVID-19 outbreak. There were no differences among most patient backgrounds between the two-period groups. For NSTEMI, the time from the symptom onset to admission was significantly longer, and that from the AMI diagnosis to the catheter examination tended to be longer during the COVID-19 period than the control period, but not for STEMI. The 30-day mortality was significantly higher during the COVID-19 period for NSTEMI (23.1% vs. 1.9%, P = 0.004), but not for STEMI (9.4% vs. 8.3%, P = 0.77). In conclusion, hospitalizations for AMI decreased after the COVID-19 outbreak. Acute cardiac care for STEMI and the associated outcome did not change, but NSTEMI outcome worsened after the COVID-19 outbreak, which may have been associated with delayed medical treatment due to the indirect impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Arai, Riku; Fukamachi, Daisuke; Ebuchi, Yasunari; Migita, Suguru; Morikawa, Tomoyuki; Monden, Masaki; Takei, Norio; Tamaki, Takehiro; Kojima, Keisuke; Akutsu, Naotaka; Murata, Nobuhiro; Kitano, Daisuke; Okumura, Yasuo",Heart vessels,,114

343561,"Clinical Management of Gynecologic Cancer Patients during Covid-19 Pandemia: the Experience of Day Hospital Tumori Femminili of Fondazione Policlinico Agostino Gemelli, Irccs",2020,"Background: Oscillometry is a tool to measure respiratory impedance that requires minimal patients' effort. In patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), the correlation of respiratory impedance at rest with exertional ventilatory parameters, including exercise tolerance, has scarcely been reported. In addition, the utility of oscillometric parameters might differ between the inspiratory and expiratory phases due to airflow obstruction during expiration, but the hypothesis had not been validated. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether oscillometric parameters are associated with exertional ventilatory parameters in patients with COPD. Methods: Fifty-five subjects with COPD who attended clinics at the National Hospital Organization Osaka Toneyama Medical Center performed spirometry, oscillometry, and cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) within 2 weeks. The correlations between parameters of spirometry, oscillometry, and CPET were analyzed using Spearman's rank correlation coefficient, univariate, and multivariate analyses. Results: Respiratory reactance had better correlations with the CPET parameters than respiratory resistance. Moreover, inspiratory reactance at rest correlated with the CPET parameters stronger than expiratory reactance. In particular, inspiratory resonant frequency (Fres-ins) correlated with peak oxygen uptake (rS=-0.549, p<0.01) and dead space to tidal volume ratio at peak exercise (rS=0.677, p<0.01) and the best predicted expiratory tidal volume (VT ex) at peak exercise of all the oscillometric parameters (rS=-0.679, p<0.01). However, the correlation between Fres-ins and V T ex at peak exercise became weak in subjects with severe and very severe COPD during exercise. Conclusion: Measurement of respiratory reactance is useful for the effortless evaluation of not only exertional ventilatory parameters but exercise tolerance in patients with COPD. The correlation of respiratory impedance with exertional ventilatory parameters can become weak in patients with advanced COPD; thus, the measurement of oscillometry might not be appropriate for evaluating exertional ventilatory parameters of patients with advanced COPD.","Yamamoto, Yuji; Miki, Keisuke; Matsuki, Takanori; Fukushima, Kiyoharu; Oshitani, Yohei; Kagawa, Hiroyuki; Tsujino, Kazuyuki; Yoshimura, Kenji; Miki, Mari; Kida, Hiroshi",Int J Chron Obstruct Pulmon Dis,,114
343837,Identifying and Managing Suicidality in Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome,2021,"Among the therapies against the pandemic SARS-CoV-2 virus, monoclonal Antibodies (mAbs) targeting the Spike glycoprotein represent good candidates to interfere in the Spike/ACE2 interaction, preventing virus cell entry. Since anti-spike mAbs, used individually, might be unable to block the virus entry in the case of resistant mutations, we designed an innovative strategy for the isolation of multiple novel human scFvs specific for the binding domain (RBD) of Spike. By panning a large phage display antibody library on immobilized RBD, we obtained specific binders by eluting with ACE2 in order to identify those scFvs recognizing the epitope of Spike interacting with its receptor. We converted the novel scFvs into full size IgG4, differently from the previously isolated IgG1 mAbs, to avoid unwanted potential side effects of IgG1 potent effector functions on immune system. The novel antibodies specifically bind to RBD in a nanomolar range and interfere in the interaction of Spike with ACE2 receptor, either used as purified protein or when expressed on cells in its native conformation. Furthermore, some of them have neutralizing activity for virus infection in cell cultures by using two different SARS-CoV-2 isolates including the highly contagious VOC 202012/01 variant and could become useful therapeutic tools to fight against the SARS-CoV-2 virus.","Passariello, Margherita; Gentile, Chiara; Ferrucci, Veronica; Sasso, Emanuele; Vetrei, Cinzia; Fusco, Giovanna; Viscardi, Maurizio; Brandi, Sergio; Cerino, Pellegrino; Zambrano, Nicola; Zollo, Massimo; De Lorenzo, Claudia",Sci Rep,,114

Despite abundant data on that many COVID-19 patients also displayed kidney disease, there is limited information available about the recovery of kidney disease after discharge. METHODS: Retrospective and prospective cohort study to patients with new-onset kidney disease during the COVID-19 hospitalization, admitted between January 28 to February 26, 2020. The median follow-up was 4 months after discharge. The follow-up patients were divided into the recovery group and non-recovery group. Descriptive statistics and between-groups comparison were used. RESULTS: In total, 143 discharged patients with new-onset kidney disease during the COVID-19 hospitalization were included. Patients had a median age was 64 (IQR, 51-70) years, and 59.4% of patients were men. During 4-months median follow-up, 91% (130 of 143) patients recovered from kidney disease, and 9% (13 of 143) patients haven't recovered. The median age of patients in the non-recovery group was 72 years, which was significantly higher than the median age of 62 years in the recovery group. Discharge serum creatinine was significantly higher in the non-recovery group than in the recovery group. CONCLUSIONS: Most of the new-onset kidney diseases during hospitalization of COVID-19 patients recovered 4 months after discharge. We recommend that COVID-19 patients with new-onset kidney disease be followed after discharge to assess kidney recovery, especially elderly patients or patients with high discharge creatinine.","Zhang, Nan-Hui; Cheng, Yi-Chun; Luo, Ran; Zhang, Chun-Xiu; Ge, Shu-Wang; Xu, Gang",BMC Infect Dis,,114

Results: Among 482â¯323 long-stay residents included, the mean (SD) age was 82.7 (9.2) years, with 326â¯861 (67.8%) women, and 383â¯838 residents (79.6%) identifying as White. Among 137â¯119 residents (28.4%) diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 during follow up, 29â¯204 residents (21.3%) were hospitalized, and 26â¯384 residents (19.2%) died within 30 days. Nursing homes explained 37.2% of the variation in risk of infection, while county explained 23.4%. Risk of infection increased with increasing body mass index (BMI; calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) (eg, BMI>45 vs BMI 18.5-25: adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 1.19; 95% CI, 1.15-1.24) but varied little by other resident characteristics. Risk of hospitalization after SARS-CoV-2 increased with increasing BMI (eg, BMI>45 vs BMI 18.5-25: aHR, 1.40; 95% CI, 1.28-1.52); male sex (aHR, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.29-1.35); Black (aHR, 1.28; 95% CI, 1.24-1.32), Hispanic (aHR, 1.20; 95% CI, 1.15-1.26), or Asian (aHR, 1.46; 95% CI, 1.36-1.57) race/ethnicity; impaired functional status (eg, severely impaired vs not impaired: aHR, 1.15; 95% CI, 1.10-1.22); and increasing comorbidities, such as renal disease (aHR, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.18-1.24) and diabetes (aHR, 1.16; 95% CI, 1.13-1.18). Risk of mortality increased with age (eg, age >90 years vs 65-70 years: aHR, 2.55; 95% CI, 2.44-2.67), impaired cognition (eg, severely impaired vs not impaired: aHR, 1.79; 95% CI, 1.71-1.86), and functional impairment (eg, severely impaired vs not impaired: aHR, 1.94; 1.83-2.05). Conclusions and Relevance: These findings suggest that among long-stay nursing home residents, risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection was associated with county and facility of residence, while risk of hospitalization and death after SARS-CoV-2 infection was associated with facility and individual resident characteristics. For many resident characteristics, there were substantial differences in risk of hospitalization vs mortality. This may represent resident preferences, triaging decisions, or inadequate recognition of risk of death.","Mehta, Hemalkumar B; Li, Shuang; Goodwin, James S",JAMA Netw Open,,114

The chiral bicyclic imidazole catalyst is crucial for the dynamic kinetic asymmetric transformation (DyKAT) to proceed smoothly with high reactivity and excellent stereoselectivity [96% conv., 22:1 P(S):P(R)]. Mechanistic studies showed that this DyKAT is a first-order visual kinetic reaction dependent on catalyst concentration. The unique chiral bicyclic imidazole skeleton and carbamate substituent of the catalyst are both required for the racemization process involving the phosphoryl chloride and subsequent stereodiscriminating step. A 10-gram scale reaction was also conducted with comparably excellent results, showing its potential for industrial application.","Wang, Mo; Zhang, Lu; Huo, Xiaohong; Zhang, Zhenfeng; Yuan, Qianjia; Li, Panpan; Chen, Jianzhong; Zou, Yashi; Wu, Zhengxing; Zhang, Wanbin",Angew. chem; int. ed. engl,,114

The aim of this study was to report data of a systematic search performed on papers published in July 2020. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: The methodology described in the second edition of the rapid living systematic review was applied to search eligible papers included in the databases between July 1, 2020 and July 31, 2020. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Eight-hundred-ninety-two papers were identified through database searching (after removal of duplicates); of these, only 23 studies were included. According to OCEBM 2011 Levels of Evidence Table, they were level 3 in 30.5% cases and level 4 in 69.5%. No RCT was found. Nineteen papers studied COVID-19 patients, assessed in the acute (10 studies), post-acute (8 studies) and chronic phase (one study). Four studies reported data on the impact of COVID-19 on subjects with pre-existing health conditions. CONCLUSIONS: The current literature production still focuses more on describing all the possible aspects and complications of the pathology than on interventions or new organization models to deal with it. Albeit evidence on handling COVID-19 from a rehabilitative point of view is improving each month, further studies are still mandatory to report the role of rehabilitation in this scenario.","Negrini, Francesco; de Sire, Alessandro; Andrenelli, Elisa; Lazzarini, Stefano G; Patrini, Michele; Ceravolo, Maria G",Eur J Phys Rehabil Med,,114

METHODS: Thirty-five older adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus were assigned to 2 groups according to their frailty status: exercise training group (prefrail or frail; n = 21; 74.7 [4.5] y; 33.3% male) and control group (robust; n = 14; 73.1 [3.9] y; 42.9% male). The exercise training group followed a multicomponent training program focusing on muscle power: supervised (5 wk) and unsupervised (6 wk). The primary outcomes, including PA and sitting time, perceived disability, and HRQoL, were assessed at the baseline and after 11 weeks. RESULTS: At the end of confinement, there were significant decreases in PA in both groups (P < .05). Thus, sitting time increased more in the control group than in the exercise training group (P < .05). The HRQoL measures remained unchanged. CONCLUSIONS: Muscle power training before and during mandatory COVID-19 self-isolation in type 2 diabetes mellitus older adults (1) attenuates the COVID-19 domiciliary confinement-related increase in sitting time and (2) slightly decreases the self-reported levels of disability and maintains HRQoL.","Brazo-Sayavera, Javier; López-Torres, Olga; Martos-Bermúdez, Álvaro; Rodriguez-Garcia, Lorena; González-Gross, Marcela; Guadalupe-Grau, Amelia",J Phys Act Health,,114
350307,Safety of bariatric surgery in patients with coronary artery disease,2020,"Introduction: Gefitinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), is an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)blocking drug that is effective in the treatment of lung cancer with EGFR mutations;however, its benefits for head and neck cancers are uncertain. Therefore, this study aims to determine the efficacy of gefitinib and methotrexate in patients with advanced-stage or recurrent head and neck cancer. Methodology: Two hundred patients of age &gt;18 years with advanced clinical stage either IVA or IVB and recurrent cases were included in this study. Patients were randomly allocated to the gefitinib (n=100) or methotrexate (n=100) group. Each patient was evaluated for demographic variables, addictions, comorbidities and history of cancer followed by clinical and radiological evaluation. Treatment response was evaluated with standard Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST). The primary end point of the study was overall response rate (ORR). SPSS version 25 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA) was used to analyze data. Results: Overall response of therapy was partial 11% vs 8%, stable disease 52% vs 40%, and progressive disease 33% vs 40% in gefitinib and methotrexate groups respectively. Three patients were lost to follow up in the gefitinib group and one patient in the methotrexate group. Only one death was reported in the gefitinib group and four in the methotrexate group. In recurrent cases, six patients treated with gefitinib showed partial response whereas no case of partial response was reported in the methotrexate group (27.3% vs 0%). Similarly, in the methotrexate group significantly higher numbers of progressive and stable diseases were reported for recurrent cases than in the gefitinib group (p=0.045). Discussion: Gefitinib had marginally better results in terms of overall response and safety as compared to methotrexate, specifically in recurrent cases of head and neck cancer. This benefit for recurrent cases and ease of administration, leading to fewer hospital visits in the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) era, makes gefitinib superior to methotrexate.","Irshad, R.; Haider, G.; Hashmi, M.; Hassan, A.",Cureus,,114

Several postulations have been made in an attempt to explain this phenomenon. One hypothesis is that African countries have leveraged on experiences from past epidemics to build resilience and response strategies which may be contributing to protecting the continent's health systems from being overwhelmed.

Pandemic containment and confinement measures impact societies and economies; their costs and benefits must be assessed holistically. This study provides an evolving portrait of the health, economic and social consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic on vulnerable populations in India. Our analysis focuses on 100 days early in the pandemic from 13 March to 20 June 2020. We developed a conceptual framework based on the human right to health and the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). We analysed people's experiences recorded and shared via mobile phone on the voice platforms operated by the Gram Vaani COVID-19 response network, a service for rural and low-income populations now being deployed to support India's COVID-19 response. Quantitative and visual methods were used to summarize key features of the data and explore relationships between factors. In its first 100 days, the platform logged over 1.15 million phone calls, of which 793 350 (69%) were outbound calls related largely to health promotion in the context of COVID-19. Analysis of 6636 audio recordings by network users revealed struggles to secure the basic necessities of survival, including food (48%), cash (17%), transportation (10%) and employment or livelihoods (8%). Themes were mapped to shortfalls in 10 SDGs and their associated targets. Pre-existing development deficits and weak social safety nets are driving vulnerability during the COVID-19 crisis. For an effective pandemic response and recovery, these must be addressed through inclusive policy design and institutional reforms.","Johri, Mira; Agarwal, Sumeet; Khullar, Aman; Chandra, Dinesh; Pratap, Vijay Sai; Seth, Aaditeshwar",Health promot. internation,,114

353910,Routine childhood immunization may protect against COVID-19,2020,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Understanding of the fundamental processes underlying the versatile clinical manifestations of COVID-19 is incomplete without comprehension of how different immune cells are recruited to various compartments of virus-infected lungs, and how this recruitment differs among individuals with different levels of disease severity. As in other respiratory infections, leukocyte recruitment to the respiratory system in people with COVID-19 is orchestrated by specific leukocyte trafficking molecules, and when uncontrolled and excessive it results in various pathological complications, both in the lungs and in other organs. In the absence of experimental data from physiologically relevant animal models, our knowledge of the trafficking signals displayed by distinct vascular beds and epithelial cell layers in response to infection by SARS-CoV-2 is still incomplete. However, SARS-CoV-2 and influenza virus elicit partially conserved inflammatory responses in the different respiratory epithelial cells encountered early in infection and may trigger partially overlapping combinations of trafficking signals in nearby blood vessels. Here, we review the molecular signals orchestrating leukocyte trafficking to airway and lung compartments during primary pneumotropic influenza virus infections and discuss potential similarities to distinct courses of primary SARS-CoV-2 infections. We also discuss how an imbalance in vascular activation by leukocytes outside the airways and lungs may contribute to extrapulmonary inflammatory complications in subsets of patients with COVID-19. These multiple molecular pathways are potential targets for therapeutic interventions in patients with severe COVID-19.","Alon, Ronen; Sportiello, Mike; Kozlovski, Stav; Kumar, Ashwin; Reilly, Emma C; Zarbock, Alexander; Garbi, Natalio; Topham, David J",Nat. rev. immunol,,114

The objective of this study was to generate insights on COVID-19 mortality-associated factors and identify potential new therapeutic options for COVID-19 patients by employing artificial intelligence analytics on real-world data. Materials and MethodsA Bayesian statistics-based artificial intelligence data analytics tool (bAIcis(R)) within Interrogative Biology(R) platform was used for network learning, inference causality and hypothesis generation to analyze 16,277 PCR positive patients from a database of 279,281 inpatients and outpatients tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection by antigen, antibody, or PCR methods during the first pandemic year in Central Florida. This approach generated causal networks that enabled unbiased identification of significant predictors of mortality for specific COVID-19 patient populations. These findings were validated by logistic regression, regression by least absolute shrinkage and selection operator, and bootstrapping. ResultsWe found that in the SARS-CoV-2 PCR positive patient cohort, early use of the antiemetic agent ondansetron was associated with increased survival in mechanically ventilated patients. ConclusionsThe results demonstrate how real world COVID-19 focused data analysis using artificial intelligence can generate valid insights that could possibly support clinical decision-making and minimize the future loss of lives and resources.","Miller, Gregory M; Ellis, Austin J; Sarangarajan, Rangaprasad; Parikh, Amay; Rodrigues, Leonardo O; Bruce, Can; Chand, Nischal Mahaveer; Smith, Steven R; Richardson, Kris; Vazquez, Raymond; Kiebish, Michael A; Chandran, Haneesh; Granger, Elder; Holtz, Judy; Hinkle, Jacob; Narain, Niven R; Goodpaster, Bret; Smith, Jeremy C; Lupu, Daniel",,,114
356418,Whole blood immunophenotyping uncovers immature neutrophil-to-VD2 T-cell ratio as an early marker for severe COVID-19,2020,"In December 2019, cases of severe coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) infection rapidly progressed to acute respiratory failure. This study aims to assess the association between the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and the incidence of severe COVID-19 infection. A retrospective cohort study was conducted on 210 patients with COVID-19 infection who were admitted to the Central Hospital of Wuhan from 27 January 2020 to 9 March 2020. Peripheral blood samples were collected and examined for lymphocyte subsets by flow cytometry. Associations between tertiles of NLR and the incidence of severe illness were analysed by logistic regression.Of the 210 patients with COVID-19, 87 were diagnosed as severe cases. The mean NLR of the severe group was higher than that of the mild group (6.6 vs. 3.3, P < 0.001). The highest tertile of NLR (5.1-19.7) exhibited a 5.9-fold (95% CI 1.3-28.5) increased incidence of severity relative to that of the lowest tertile (0.6-2.5) after adjustments for age, diabetes, hypertension and other confounders. The number of T cells significantly decreased in the severe group (0.5 vs. 0.9, P < 0.001). COVID-19 might mainly act on lymphocytes, particularly T lymphocytes. NLR was identified as an early risk factor for severe COVID-19 illness. Patients with increased NLR should be admitted to an isolation ward with respiratory monitoring and supportive care.","Kong, Man; Zhang, Hongmei; Cao, Xiaocui; Mao, Xiaoli; Lu, Zhongxin",Epidemiol Infect,,114

358516,Rare cutaneous involvement as the first manifestation of Systemic Sclerosis,2021,"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is an aggressive malignancy that remains a challenge to treat. In pursuit of personalized medicine, researchers continue active exploration of the genetic and molecular framework of PDAC to apply novel therapeutics and enhance outcomes. In patients who have PDAC, germline mutations-such as those in the BRCA1/2 and PALB2 genes-are predominantly associated with the DNA damage response and repair pathway. On the basis of studies completed in patients with BRCA-mutated advanced breast and ovarian cancer, the poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors have been evaluated for safety, tolerability, and efficacy in patients with advanced PDAC who are carrying germline BRCA gene mutations. Results have demonstrated meaningful activity and identified BRCA as a predictive and targetable biomarker in PDAC, and have also identified the role of olaparib as a maintenance therapy in PDAC. On the basis of the principle of synthetic lethality, and to avert resistance to PARP inhibitors, clinical trials of combination therapy with PARP inhibitors and platinum-based chemotherapy have been conducted with an early signal. As we continue to explore the role of PARP inhibitors in the management of PDAC, recent clinical trials are studying the effectiveness of PARP inhibitors in combination with immunotherapy, targeted inhibitors, and angiogenesis inhibitors. The next steps are to understand the role of PARP inhibitors beyond germline BRCA in other homologous recombination repair gene mutations and in other subgroups of patients with PDAC.","Moffat, Gordon T; O039,; Reilly, Eileen M",Clin Adv Hematol Oncol,,114

In this report, we describe three patients with ischemic stroke associated with COVID-19 infection.Methods: We report 3 cases of adult patients with ischemic stroke and novel coronavirus 2019 infection. Case 1 is an 88-year-old female with acute left hemiplegia and right peripheral facial paresis that she had a fever along with stroke symptoms. Case 2 is an 85-year-old female with left hemiplegia and drowsiness who had a weakness, asthenia, and dry cough 3 days before appearing stroke signs. Case 3 is a 55-year-old male with acute Broca's aphasia and right hemiplegia who experience fever and respiratory problems 3 days after admission.Results: The clinical symptoms of infected patients with COVID-19 have been associated with severe symptoms of ischemic stroke. Two patients were admitted to the ICU. RT-PCR of the oropharyngeal sample was positive in three cases. All patients had the involvement of large cerebral arteries.Conclusion: The mechanism by which COVID-19 causes ischemic stroke is unknown but it is likely by production inflammatory cytokines or direct infection of cerebral arteries. Therefore, regarding the current situation of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is indispensable that the possible diagnosis of COVID-19 vasculopathy is considered in all ischemic strokes of unclear etiology.","Sharifi-Razavi, Athena; Karimi, Narges; Zarvani, Ashraf; Cheraghmakani, Hamed; Baghbanian, Seyed Mohammad",Int J Neurosci,,114

It is possible that the male sex hormone, testosterone, contributes to the morbidity from COVID-19. SARS-CoV2 viruses use cell membrane protein Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor and undergo S protein priming by the Type II Transmembrane Serine Protease (TMPRSS2) to enter the cells. Hence, the expression level of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 may affect disease susceptibility and possible severity. TMPRSS2 is regulated by the androgen receptor. We, therefore, examined if an association exists between serum testosterone concentrations and ACE2 or TMPRSS2 expression level in men.","Ling, Guyou Campbell Robert Bruno Jonathan Goffinet Aaron Krebs Joseph Jain Ajay Dhindsa Sandeep S.",Journal of the Endocrine Society,,114

360352,A hypothesis about the role of fetal hemoglobin in COVID-19,2020,"Detecting groups of people who are jointly deceptive in video conversations is crucial in settings such as meetings, sales pitches, and negotiations. Past work on deception in videos focuses on detecting a single deceiver and uses facial or visual features only. In this paper, we propose the concept of Face-to-Face Dynamic Interaction Networks (FFDINs) to model the interpersonal interactions within a group of people. The use of FFDINs enables us to leverage network relations in detecting group deception in video conversations for the first time. We use a dataset of 185 videos from a deception-based game called Resistance. We first characterize the behavior of individual, pairs, and groups of deceptive participants and compare them to non-deceptive participants. Our analysis reveals that pairs of deceivers tend to avoid mutual interaction and focus their attention on non-deceivers. In contrast, non-deceivers interact with everyone equally. We propose Negative Dynamic Interaction Networks to capture the notion of missing interactions. We create the DeceptionRank algorithm to detect deceivers from NDINs extracted from videos that are just one minute long. We show that our method outperforms recent state-of-the-art computer vision, graph embedding, and ensemble methods by at least 20.9% AUROC in identifying deception from videos.","Kumar, Srijan; Bai, Chongyang; Subrahmanian, V.

362186,"A Review on Coronavirus: Structure, Diagnosis and Treatment",2020,"Formulating accurate and robust classification strategies is a key challenge of developing diagnostic and antibody tests. Methods that do not explicitly account for disease prevalence and uncertainty therein can lead to significant classification errors. We present a novel method that leverages optimal decision theory to address this problem. As a preliminary step, we develop an analysis that uses an assumed prevalence and conditional probability models of diagnostic measurement outcomes to define optimal (in the sense of minimizing rates of false positives and false negatives) classification domains. Critically, we demonstrate how this strategy can be generalized to a setting in which the prevalence is unknown by either: (i) defining a third class of hold-out samples that require further testing; or (ii) using an adaptive algorithm to estimate prevalence prior to defining classification domains. We also provide examples for a recently published SARS-CoV-2 serology test and discuss how measurement uncertainty (e.g. associated with instrumentation) can be incorporated into the analysis. We find that our new strategy decreases classification error by up to a decade relative to more traditional methods based on confidence intervals. Moreover, it establishes a theoretical foundation for generalizing techniques such as receiver operating characteristics (ROC) by connecting them to the broader field of optimization.","Patrone, Paul N.; Kearsley, Anthony J.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.10021v1.pdf,114
362876,Negative pressure rooms and COVID-19,2021,"BackgroundChildren and young people (CYP) were less affected than adults in the first wave of SARS-CoV-2 in the UK. We test the hypothesis that clinical characteristics of hospitalized CYP with SARS-CoV-2 in the UK second wave would differ from the first due to the combined impact of the alpha variant, school reopening and relaxation of shielding. MethodsPatients <19 years hospitalised in the UK with clinician-reported SARS-CoV-2 were enrolled in a prospective multicentre observational cohort study between 17th January 2020 and 31st January 2021. Minimum follow up time was two weeks. Clinical characteristics were compared between the first (W1) and second wave (W2) of infections. Findings2044 CYP aged <19 years were reported from 187 hospitals. 427/2044 (20.6%) had asymptomatic/incidental SARS-CoV-2 infection and were excluded from main analysis. 16.0% (248/1548) of symptomatic CYP were admitted to critical care and 0.8% (12/1504) died. 5.6% (91/1617) of symptomatic CYP had Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C). Patients in W2 were significantly older (median age 6.5 years, IQR 0.3-14.9) than W1 (4.0 (0.4-13.6, p 0.015). Fever was more common in W1, otherwise presenting symptoms and comorbidities were similar across waves. After excluding CYP with MIS-C, patients in W2 had lower PEWS at presentation, lower antibiotic use and less respiratory and cardiovascular support compared to W1. There was no change in the proportion of CYP admitted to critical care between W1 and W2. 58.0% (938/1617) of symptomatic CYP had no reported comorbidity. Patients without co-morbidities were younger (42.4%, 398/938, <1 year old), had lower Paediatric Early Warning Scores (PEWS) at presentation, shorter length of hospital stay and received less respiratory support. MIS-C was responsible for a large proportion of critical care admissions, invasive and non-invasive ventilatory support, inotrope and intravenous corticosteroid use in CYP without comorbidities. InterpretationSevere disease in CYP admitted with symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 in the UK remains rare. One in five CYP in this cohort had asymptomatic/incidental SARS-CoV-2 infection. We found no evidence of increased disease severity in W2 compared with W1.

Very little structural information about 2019-nCoV make this situation more difficult for drug designing. Benzylidenechromanones, naturally occurring oxygen heterocyclic compounds, having capability to inhibit various protein and receptors, have been designed here to block mutant variety of coronavirus main protease enzyme (SARC-CoV-2 Mpro) isolated from 2019-nCoV with the assistance of molecular docking, bioinformatics and molecular electrostatic potential. (Z)-3-(4'-chlorobenzylidene)-thiochroman-4-one showed highest binding affinity to the protein. Binding of a compound to this protein actually inhibits the replication and transcription of the virus and, ultimately, stop the virus multiplication. Incorporation of any functional groups to the basic benzylidenechromanones enhances their binding ability. Chloro and bromo substitutions amplify the binding affinity. ADME studies of all these compounds indicate they are lipophilic, high gastro intestine absorbable and blood-brain barrier permeable. The outcome reveals that the investigated benzylidenechromanones can be examined in the case of 2019-nCoV as potent inhibitory drug of SARC-CoV-2 Mpro, for their strong inhibition ability, high reactivity and effective pharmacological properties.","Sepay, Nayim; Sepay, Nadir; Al Hoque, Ashique; Mondal, Rina; Halder, Umesh Chandra; Muddassir, Mohd",Struct Chem,,114

Remdesivir (GS-5734), a nucleoside analogue prodrug, has inhibitory effects on pathogenic animal and human coronaviruses, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in vitro, and inhibits Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, SARS-CoV-1, and SARS-CoV-2 replication in animal models. METHODS: We did a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre trial at ten hospitals in Hubei, China. Eligible patients were adults (aged &#8805;18 years) admitted to hospital with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, with an interval from symptom onset to enrolment of 12 days or less, oxygen saturation of 94% or less on room air or a ratio of arterial oxygen partial pressure to fractional inspired oxygen of 300 mm Hg or less, and radiologically confirmed pneumonia. Patients were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to intravenous remdesivir (200 mg on day 1 followed by 100 mg on days 2-10 in single daily infusions) or the same volume of placebo infusions for 10 days. Patients were permitted concomitant use of lopinavir-ritonavir, interferons, and corticosteroids. The primary endpoint was time to clinical improvement up to day 28, defined as the time (in days) from randomisation to the point of a decline of two levels on a six-point ordinal scale of clinical status (from 1=discharged to 6=death) or discharged alive from hospital, whichever came first. Primary analysis was done in the intention-to-treat (ITT) population and safety analysis was done in all patients who started their assigned treatment. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04257656. FINDINGS: Between Feb 6, 2020, and March 12, 2020, 237 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to a treatment group (158 to remdesivir and 79 to placebo); one patient in the placebo group who withdrew after randomisation was not included in the ITT population. Remdesivir use was not associated with a difference in time to clinical improvement (hazard ratio 1·23 [95% CI 0·87-1·75]). Although not statistically significant, patients receiving remdesivir had a numerically faster time to clinical improvement than those receiving placebo among patients with symptom duration of 10 days or less (hazard ratio 1·52 [0·95-2·43]). Adverse events were reported in 102 (66%) of 155 remdesivir recipients versus 50 (64%) of 78 placebo recipients. Remdesivir was stopped early because of adverse events in 18 (12%) patients versus four (5%) patients who stopped placebo early. INTERPRETATION: In this study of adult patients admitted to hospital for severe COVID-19, remdesivir was not associated with statistically significant clinical benefits. However, the numerical reduction in time to clinical improvement in those treated earlier requires confirmation in larger studies.

367229,The Role of Host Genetic Factors in Coronavirus Susceptibility: Review of Animal and Systematic Review of Human Literature,2020,"SARS-CoV-2 virus infection is responsible for coronavirus disease (COVID-19), which is characterised by a hyperinflammatory response that plays a major role in determining the respiratory and immune-mediated complications of this condition. While isolating peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from whole blood of COVID-19 patients by density gradient centrifugation, we noticed some changes in the floating properties and in the sedimentation of the cells on density medium. Investigating this further, we found that in early phase COVID-19 patients, characterised by reduced circulating lymphocytes and monocytes, the PBMC fraction contained surprisingly high levels of neutrophils. Furthermore, the neutrophil population exhibited alterations in the cell size and in the internal complexity, consistent with the presence of low density neutrophils (LDNs) and immature forms, which may explain the shift seen in the floating abilities and that may be predictive of the severity of the disease. The percentage of this subset of neutrophils found in the PBMC band was rather spread (35.4 ± 27.2%, with a median 28.8% and IQR 11.6-56.1, Welch's t-test early phase COVID-19 versus blood donor healthy controls P < 0.0001). Results confirm the presence of an increased number of LDNs in patients with early stage COVID-19, which correlates with disease severity and may be recovered by centrifugation on a density gradient together with PBMCs.","Manunta, Maria D I; Lamorte, Giuseppe; Ferrari, Francesca; Trombetta, Elena; Tirone, Mario; Bianco, Cristiana; Cattaneo, Alessandra; Santoro, Luigi; Baselli, Guido; Brasca, Manuela; Ostadreza, Mahnoosh; Erba, Elisa; Gori, Andrea; Bandera, Alessandra; Porretti, Laura; Valenti, Luca V C; Prati, Daniele",Sci Rep,,114

368925,ACCC Joins Lawsuit Against MFN Final Rule,2021,"The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Related Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a global health emergency. As only very limited therapeutic options are clinically available, there is an urgent need for the rapid development of safe, effective, and globally available pharmaceuticals that inhibit SARS-CoV-2 entry and ameliorate COVID-19 severity. In this study, we explored the use of small compounds acting on the homeostasis of the endolysosomal host-pathogen interface, to fight SARS-CoV-2 infection. We find that fluoxetine, a widely used antidepressant and a functional inhibitor of acid sphingomyelinase (FIASMA), efficiently inhibited the entry and propagation of SARS-CoV-2 in the cell culture model without cytotoxic effects and also exerted potent antiviral activity against two currently circulating influenza A virus subtypes, an effect which was also observed upon treatment with the FIASMAs amiodarone and imipramine. Mechanistically, fluoxetine induced both impaired endolysosomal acidification and the accumulation of cholesterol within the endosomes. As the FIASMA group consists of a large number of small compounds that are well-tolerated and widely used for a broad range of clinical applications, exploring these licensed pharmaceuticals may offer a variety of promising antivirals for host-directed therapy to counteract enveloped viruses, including SARS-CoV-2.","Schloer, Sebastian; Brunotte, Linda; Goretzko, Jonas; Mecate-Zambrano, Angeles; Korthals, Nadia; Gerke, Volker; Ludwig, Stephan; Rescher, Ursula",Emerg Microbes Infect,,114

Recent studies have highlighted the contribution of caregivers to sleep development. However, the majority of them have primarily focused on maternal behaviors, overlooking fathers. The main goal of the present study was to investigate the associations between paternal and maternal involvement in children's sleep care and the number of night awakenings reported by both parents in infants and toddlers. METHODS: One-hundred-and-one families of infants aged 8 to 12 months and 54 families of toddlers aged 18 to 36 months filled out the following self-report questionnaires: The Brief Infant Sleep Questionnaire and an ad hoc questionnaire to assess parental involvement in sleep care for children. A moderate actor-partner interdependence (APIM) with path analysis was performed to test the predictive role of parental involvement on the children's sleep (no. of nocturnal awakenings) and the moderation role of age on these relationships. RESULTS: Paternal involvement in children's sleep care was associated with the number of night awakenings reported by both parents. Moreover, a significant interaction effect emerged between the children's age and paternal involvement in children's sleep care for predicting nocturnal awakenings.

371236,"Mélange intéressante: COVID-19, autologous transplants and multiple sclerosis",2020,"To stop the spread of the Coronavirus, people must avoid infection risk. Given widespread skepticism regarding information concerning the Coronavirus received from authorities, one potentially important pathway to estimate the infectiousness of one's group members could be through gossip (i.e., information about an absent target). Infection risk is reflected by both infection status and adherence to social distancing norms. In hypothetical scenarios (N = 837), participants received gossip that we manipulated to describe a group member's infection status and/or norm adherence. Results showed people tended to believe gossip and that gossip influenced behavioral intentions to avoid and punish targets of gossip as well as the perception of targets. We conclude that gossip, while potentially unreliable, could affect how people treat group members. We discuss how gossip could alleviate the Coronavirus crisis by contributing to slowing the Coronavirus's spread, as well as exacerbate it through increased social exclusion based on unverified information.

372587,ATS Core Curriculum 2020. Adult Pulmonary Medicine,2020,"CONTEXT: In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak a pandemic. Due to the rapid spread, strong contagion, high incidence of lethality in severe cases, and the lack of a pharmaceutical prevention or cure, COVID-19 has posed a serious threat to human life and health. It has also had a tremendous impact on mental health, including fear and worry, difficulty sleeping or concentrating, and increased use of poor coping mechanisms. Osteopathic medical students have had additional concerns regarding the interruption of their studies, closing of clinical rotations, and postponed licensing exams. To date, few reports have focused on osteopathic medical students and their reactions to the outbreak. OBJECTIVES: To assess resilience, coping, health behaviors, and emotional wellbeing of osteopathic medical students during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, we distributed an anonymous online survey to all medical students enrolled at Nova Southeastern University in May 2020 (n=1,310) via an e-mail invitation using the institution's student listservs. Our major study variables were based on published reports and anecdotal evidence; we subsequently developed the Emotional Wellbeing in Healthcare Professions Students Questionnaire (EWB-Q). This EWB-Q contained validated scales to assess the contribution of levels of coping strategies used, personal resilience, and health behaviors on the emotional wellbeing of osteopathic medical students. Multiple linear regression and other statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS v0.26. RESULTS: Of the 1,310 students invited to participate, 335 (25.5%) surveys were returned. Of those, 133 had more than 33% of the necessary data missing and were removed, resulting in 202 (15.4%) completed questionnaires. The mean age of the participants was 26.7 years. About half (n=92; 45.5%) were in the clinical phase (years 3 and 4) of their medical school training (in rotations). A significant regression equation was found (F[4,171]=17.481, p<0.000, R 2 =0.290, R 2adjusted=0.274), indicating that levels of coping, personal resilience, and health behaviors (i.e., not sleeping more than usual, not exercising less than usual) accounted for a significant amount of the variance in emotional wellbeing scores in osteopathic medical students. Higher levels of resilience, greater use of coping strategies, not sleeping more than usual, and not exercising less than usual were predictors of emotional wellbeing. CONCLUSIONS: Cultivating positive mental health should be a high priority for medical educators as they develop and implement curriculum-based initiatives to help medical students bolster their personal resilience and to encourage healthy coping behaviors during times of crisis and beyond. A proactive position that assists with building personal resilience and developing stress management habits is paramount in assisting students who are grappling not only with the challenges of rigorous medical training, but also with the uncertainty and stress that exists during any major global health or socioeconomic crisis.","Jacobs, Robin; Lanspa, Michelle; Kane, Michael; Caballero, Joshua",J Osteopath Med,,114

373389,Pirfenidone: A novel hypothetical treatment for COVID-19,2020,"Background: In the absence of effective vaccines and definitive treatment, non-pharmaceutical interventions, also known as community mitigation strategies (CMS), are needed to reduce the transmission of respiratory virus infections such as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, the effectiveness of these strategies depends on a knowledgeable population cooperating and adhering strictly to recommended strategies. Objective: The objective of the study was to determine the knowledge and adherence to CMS against COVID-19 in Benin City, the capital of Edo State, Nigeria. Materials and Methods: A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted amongst adult residents in Benin City using a self-administered questionnaire for data collection. Eighteen questions addressed knowledge of CMS, while adherence was assessed using 14 questions on a graded scale. Each correct answer was scored giving maximum and minimum scores of 18 and 0 for knowledge and 28 and 0 for adherence, respectively. Scores were converted to percentages with scores 70% and above adjudged as good knowledge of CMS and scores 50% and above adjudged as good adherence to CMS. Data were analysed with IBM SPSS version 25.0 software. The level of significance was set at P < 0.05. Results: The mean age (standard deviation) of 577 respondents who participated in the study was 32.5 ± 11.7 years. Overall, 532 (92.2%) respondents had good knowledge, while only 165 (28.6%) demonstrated good compliance with CMS against COVID-19. Christianity was a statistically significant predictor of knowledge of CMS. Income was found to be a significant predictor of adherence to CMS amongst respondents. Conclusion: Respondents demonstrated good knowledge but poor adherence with CMS against COVID-19 in Benin City, Edo State. Behaviour change communication is advocated to ensure that mitigation strategies are effective.","Ogboghodo, Esohe Olivia; Osaigbovo, Iriagbonse Iyabo; Obaseki, Darlington Ewaen; Nneka Okwara, Obiageli Henrietta; Omo-Ikirodah, Orezimena Temitope; Adio, Funmilayo; Ehinze, Ewere Scholastica",Niger Postgrad Med J,,114
373638,Barriers Driving Racial Disparities in Colorectal Cancer Screening in African Americans,2020,"PURPOSE: To describe the possible adverse effects of sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) solutions, high-concentration alcohol solutions, and povidone-iodine products, which are indicated for disinfection of inanimate surfaces against human coronavirus of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV), on prosthesis materials, including zirconia, lithium disilicate, and acrylic resin. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A systematic literature research for articles published between January 2010 and February 2020 was conducted in Scopus, PubMed/Medline, Web of Science, Embase, and Science Direct using a combination of the following MeSH/Emtree terms and keywords: sodium hypochlorite, alcohol, ethanol, povidone-iodine, dental ceramic, zirconia, lithium disilicate, and acrylic resin. RESULTS: A total of 538 studies were identified in the search during initial screening, of which 44 were subject to full-text evaluation, and 24 fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Seven articles on zirconia and lithium disilicate investigated the effect of NaOCl (0.5% and 1%), 96% isopropanol, and 80% ethanol on bond strength after saliva contamination. The remaining articles evaluated color alteration, surface roughness modifications, decrease in flexural strength, and bonding strength of all cleaning agents on acrylic resin. CONCLUSION: NaOCl (1%) solution for 1 minute is recommended to reduce SARS-CoV infectivity and to minimize the risk of cross-contamination through prosthetic materials. The increase in surface roughness and color alteration were recorded using 1% NaOCl on acrylic resin, but this increase was not clinically significant. A decrease in bonding strength was determined after using 1% NaOCl, 96% isopropanol, and 80% ethanol solutions on lithium disilicate. Silanization before the try-in procedure and the application of the second layer of silane after cleaning methods are recommended to improve the bonding strength.","Di Fiore, Adolfo; Monaco, Carlo; Granata, Stefano; Stellini, Edoardo",Int. j. prosthodont,,114

In answering questions raised regarding our study, we updated our database and repeated all analyses. METHODS: We re-evaluated the incidence of the composite outcome of symptomatic acute pulmonary embolism (PE), deep-vein thrombosis, ischemic stroke, myocardial infarction and/or systemic arterial embolism in all COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICUs of 2 Dutch university hospitals and 1 Dutch teaching hospital from ICU admission to death, ICU discharge or April 22nd 2020, whichever came first. RESULTS: We studied the same 184 ICU patients as reported on previously, of whom a total of 41 died (22%) and 78 were discharged alive (43%). The median follow-up duration increased from 7 to 14 days. All patients received pharmacological thromboprophylaxis. The cumulative incidence of the composite outcome, adjusted for competing risk of death, was 49% (95% confidence interval [CI] 41-57%). The majority of thrombotic events were PE (65/75; 87%). In the competing risk model, chronic anticoagulation therapy at admission was associated with a lower risk of the composite outcome (Hazard Ratio [HR] 0.29, 95%CI 0.091-0.92). Patients diagnosed with thrombotic complications were at higher risk of all-cause death (HR 5.4; 95%CI 2.4-12). Use of therapeutic anticoagulation was not associated with all-cause death (HR 0.79, 95%CI 0.35-1.8).

375688,COVID-19: Staging of a New Disease,2020,"BACKGROUND: Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) has become the preferred bariatric procedure in many countries. However, there is one shortcoming of LSG in the long-term follow-up, and this is the onset of gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD) and erosive esophagitis (EE). Conversion to Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) is considered an option in patients unresponsive to medical therapy. Currently, there is no evidence of EE improvement or resolution after conversion surgery. In this study, we objectively evaluate the effectiveness of RYGB in management of EE with upper endoscopy (EGD) to identify the significant variables in patients with GERD symptoms post LSG refractory to medical therapy and require conversion surgery. METHODS: Over a period of 11 years (2008-2019) at Singapore General Hospital, we retrospectively reviewed a prospectively collected database of a cohort of patients whom had conversion surgery to RYGB for refractory GERD and EE after LSG. Patient's endoscopic findings and demographic and anthropometric data were analyzed. RESULTS: We identified a total of 14 patients who underwent LSG to RYGB conversions for endoscopic proven erosive esophagitis in our unit during the study period. Eight patients (57.1%) had concurrent hiatal hernia repaired. Nine (64.3%) patients were females. The median age of patients in this cohort was 44 (range 30-61) years. Mean weight and BMI were 87.7 kg (± 19.2) and 32.8 (± 3.09) kg/m2, respectively, on the day of conversion surgery. The median time between LSG and revision to RYGB was 36 (range 6-68) months. Seven patients (50%) had complete resolution of GERD symptoms after conversion, and 6 patients (42.9%) had partial resolution. Six out of 7 patients had complete resolution of EE. There were 4 anastomotic strictures (28.6%). Older patients, Indian ethnicity, present of hiatal hernia and lower weight loss after initial LSG were more likely to undergo conversion surgery. CONCLUSION: Conversion to RYGB after LSG is clinically relevant and may be a feasible solution if patients have ongoing GERD refractory to medical therapy. Ninety-three percent of our patients achieved complete resolution of their GERD symptoms and significant improvement of erosive esophagitis with significant weight loss after conversion. This study has important implications as LSG is increasingly being performed and a proportion of these will need revision surgery for various reasons, particularly GERD which is extremely prevalent.","Lim, Chin Hong; Lee, Phong Ching; Lim, Eugene; Eng, Alvin; Chan, Weng Hoong; Tan, Hong Chang; Ho, Emily; Kovalik, Jean-Paul; Ganguly, Sonali; Tan, Jeremy",Obes. surg,,114
375920,Lexical-semantic search related to side of onset and putamen volume in Parkinson's disease,2020,"BACKGROUND: During the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic a mass casualty incident of ambulatory patients occurred at the COVID-19 rapid response infrastructure (CRRI) facility at the University Hospital of Cologne (UHC). We report the development of a patient-centred mobile-device solution to support efficient management of the facility, triage of patients and rapid delivery of test results. METHODS: The UHC-Corona Web Tool (CWT) was developed as a web-based software useable on each patient's smartphone. It provides, among others, a self-reported medical history including type and duration of symptoms and potential risk contacts and links all retrieved information to the digital patient chart via a QR code. It provides scheduling of outpatient appointments and automated transmission of SARS-CoV-2 test results. RESULTS: The UHC-CWT was launched on 9 April 2020. It was used by 28,652 patients until 31 August 2020. Of those, 15,245 (53,2%) consulted the CRRI, representing 43,1% of all CRRI patients during the observed period. There were 8304 (29,0%) specifications concerning travel history and 17,145 (59,8%) indications of &#8805;1 symptom of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The most frequently indicated symptoms were sore throat (60,0%), headache (50,7%), common cold (45,1%) and cough (42,6%) while 11,057 (40,2%) patients did not report any symptoms. After implementation of the UHC-CWT, the amount of patient contacts per physician rose from 38 to 98,7 per day.

376206,Emerging treatment strategies for COVID-19 infection,2020,"The authenticity and integrity of medical images in telemedicine has to be protected Robust reversible watermarking (RRW) algorithms provide copyright protection and the original images can be recovered at the receiver’s end However, the existing algorithms have limitations in their ability to balance the tradeoff among robustness, imperceptibility, and embedded capacity Some of them are even not completely reversible Besides, most medical image watermarking algorithms are not designed for color images To improve their performance in protecting medical color image information, we propose a novel RRW scheme based on the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) First, the DWT provides a robust solution Second, the modification of the wavelet domain coefficient guarantees the changes of integer values in the spatial domain and ensures the reversibility of the watermarking scheme Third, the embedding scheme makes full use of the characteristics of the original image and watermarking This reduces the modification of the original image and ensures better imperceptibility Lastly, the selection of the Zernike moments order for geometric correction is optimized to predict attack parameters more accurately by using less information This enhances the robustness of the proposed scheme against geometric attacks such as rotation and scaling The proposed scheme is robust against common and geometric attacks and has a high embedding capacity without obvious distortion of the image The paper contributes towards improving the security of medical images in remote healthcare","Zhou, Xiaoyi Ma Yue Zhang Qingquan Mazin Abed Mohammed Damaševičius Robertas",Electronics,,114

Purpose: We aimed to explore early warning information for patients with severe/critical COVID-19 based on quantitative analysis of chest CT images at the lung segment level. Materials and Methods: A dataset of 81 patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) treated at Wuhan Wuchang hospital in Wuhan city from 21 January 2020 to 14 February 2020 was retrospectively analyzed, including ordinary and severe/critical cases. The time course of all subjects was divided into four stages. The differences in each lobe and lung segment between the two groups at each stage were quantitatively analyzed using the percentage of lung involvement (PLI) in order to investigate the most important segment of lung involvement in the severe/critical group and its corresponding time point. Results: Lung involvement in the ordinary and severe/critical groups reached a peak on the 18th and 14th day, respectively. In the first stage, PLIs in the right middle lobe and the left superior lobe between the two groups were significantly different. In the second stage and the fourth stage, there were statistically significant differences between the two groups in the whole lung, right superior lobe, right inferior lobe and left superior lobe. The rapid progress of the lateral segment of the right middle lobe on the second day and the anterior segment of the right upper lobe on the 13th day may be a warning sign for severe/critical patients. Age was the most important demographic characteristic of the severe/critical group. Conclusion: Quantitative assessment based on the lung segments of chest CT images provides early warning information for potentially severe/critical patients.","Yuyun, Xu; Lexi, Yu; Haochu, Wang; Zhenyu, Shu; Xiangyang, Gong",Front Public Health,,114

Neurosurgery has seen a great decline in cases including head trauma leading to a negative impact on the development of neurosurgical trainees. The main objective of this study is to the identify changes in neurosurgical referrals, admissions and management during the COVID-19 pandemic. We also aim to assess how current practise could be adapted to help manage future pandemic peaks. METHODS: Data was collected for the first 31 days of lockdown during 2020 (23rd March - 22nd April) and compared to the same time period in the years 2016-2019. We assessed the number of referrals, admissions and clinical information of patients during this period with a key emphasis on head trauma. RESULTS: Neurosurgical head injury referrals and admissions reduced by 57.5% and 48.3% respectively during the first 31 days of lockdown when compared to the mean figures for the same period in the previous 4 years. This was also seen with head trauma with a 21.9% decline in referrals and 39.1% reduction in admissions for the period of interest. A significant decrease in length of stay (P < 0.001) was seen between 2020 and the years 2017-19. CONCLUSION: The impact of COVID-19 makes it imperative that we plan for future pandemics to lessen the impact on neurosurgery. Special considerations need to be taken so that trainees are sufficiently prepared for completion of training whilst still priotising patient safety and providing high quality care.","Sinha, Siddharth; Toe, Ko Ko Zayar; Wood, Edith; George, K Joshi",J Clin Neurosci,,114

In this paper, we test whether work-related mobility is effectively influenced by the local intensity of poverty. To do so, we exploit poverty data and Google mobility data for 242 regions of nine Latin American and African countries. We find that the drop in work-related mobility during the first lockdown period was indeed significantly lower in high-poverty regions compared to other regions. We also illustrate how higher poverty has induced a faster spread of the virus. The policy implication is that social protection measures in the form of food or cash transfers must be complementary to physical distancing measures. Further research must evaluate how such transfers, when implemented, have attenuated the difference between poor and non-poor regions in terms of exposure to the virus.","Bargain, Olivier; Aminjonov, Ulugbek",World Dev,,114

Achieving effective systemic exposure with oral formulations has been challenging. An intravenous lipid emulsion fenretinide formulation was developed to overcome this barrier. We conducted a study to establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), preliminary efficacy, and pharmacokinetics of intravenous lipid emulsion fenretinide in patients with advanced solid tumors. METHODS: Twenty-three patients with advanced solid tumors refractory to standard treatments received fenretinide as a continuous infusion for five consecutive days in 21-day cycles. Five different dose cohorts were evaluated between doses of 905 mg/m2 and 1414 mg/m2 per day using a 3 + 3 dose escalation design. A priming dose of 600 mg/m2 on day 1 was introduced in an attempt to address the asymptomatic serum triglyceride elevations related to the lipid emulsion. RESULTS: The treatment-related adverse events occurring in &#8805; 20% of patients were anemia, hypertriglyceridemia, fatigue, aspartate aminotransferase (AST)/alanine aminotransferase (ALT) increase, thrombocytopenia, bilirubin increase, and dry skin. Five evaluable patients had stable disease as best response, and no patients had objective responses. Plasma steady-state concentrations of the active metabolite were significantly higher than with previous capsule formulations.

Outcomes of clinical trials on repurposed drugs have not been yielding success. Therefore, it is necessary to include complementary approaches of medicine against COVID-19. PURPOSE: This study was designed to evaluate the impact of traditional Indian Ayurvedic treatment regime on asymptomatic patients with COVID-19 infection. STUDY DESIGN: It is a placebo controlled randomized double-blind pilot clinical trial. METHODS: The study was registered with Clinical Trial Registry-India (vide Registration No. CTRI/2020/05/025273) and conducted at the Department of Medicine in National Institute of Medical Sciences and Research, Jaipur, India. 1 g of Giloy Ghanvati (Tinospora cordifolia) and 2 g of Swasari Ras (traditional herbo-mineral formulation) and 0.5 g each of Ashwagandha (Withania somnifera) and Tulsi Ghanvati (Ocimum sanctum) were given orally to the patients in treatment group twice per day for 7 days. Medicines were given in the form of tablets and each tablet weighed 500 mg. While, Swasari Ras was administered in powdered form, 30 min before breakfasts and dinners, rest were scheduled for 30 min post-meals. Patients in the treatment group also received 4 drops of Anu taila (traditional nasal drop) in each nostril every day 1 h before breakfast. Patients in the placebo group received identical-looking tablets and drops, post randomization and double blinded assortments. RT-qPCR test was used for the detection of viral load in the nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab samples of study participants during the study. Chemiluminescent immunometric assay was used to quantify serum levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-&#945;) and high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) on day 1 and day 7 of the study. RESULTS: By day 3, 71.1 % and 50.0 % patients recovered in the treatment and placebo groups, respectively. Treatment group witnessed 100 % recovery by day 7, while it was 60.0 % in the placebo group. Average fold changes in serum levels of hs-CRP, IL-6 and TNF-&#945; in treatment group were respectively, 12.4, 2.5 and 20 times lesser than those in the placebo group at day 7. There was 40 % absolute reduction in the risk of delayed recovery from infection in the treatment group. CONCLUSIONS: Ayurvedic treatment can expedite virological clearance, help in faster recovery and concomitantly reduce the risk of viral dissemination. Reduced inflammation markers suggested less severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the treatment group. Moreover, there was no adverse effect observed to be associated with this treatment.","Devpura, Ganpat; Tomar, Balvir S; Nathiya, Deepak; Sharma, Abhishek; Bhandari, Deepak; Haldar, Swati; Balkrishna, Acharya; Varshney, Anurag",Phytomedicine,,114

We studied blood and airways of COVID-19 patients across disease severity at multiple timepoints. M-MDSC frequencies were elevated in blood but not in nasopharyngeal or endotracheal aspirates of COVID-19 patients compared to controls. M-MDSCs isolated from COVID-19 patients suppressed T cell proliferation and IFNg production partly via an arginase-1 (Arg-1) dependent mechanism. Furthermore, patients showed increased Arg-1 and IL-6 plasma levels. COVID-19 patients had fewer T cells, and displayed downregulated expression of the CD3Î¶ chain. Ordinal regression showed that early M-MDSC frequency predicted subsequent disease severity. In conclusion, M-MDSCs expand in blood of COVID-19 patients, suppress T cells and strongly associate with disease severity, suggesting a role for M-MDSCs in the dysregulated COVID-19 immune response.","Falck-Jones, Sara; Vangeti, Sindhu; Yu, Meng; Falck-Jones, Ryan; Cagigi, Alberto; Badolati, Isabella; Österberg, Björn; Lautenbach, Maximilian Julius; Ahlberg, Eric; Lin, Ang; Lepzien, Rico; Szurgot, Inga; Lenart, Klara; Hellgren, Fredrika; Maecker, Holden T; Sälde, Jörgen; Albert, Jan; Johansson, Niclas; Bell, Max; Lore, Karin; Färnert, Anna; Smed-Sörensen, Anna",J. clin. invest,,114

This study aims to examine the spatial heterogeneity of COVID-19 transmission in the city naturally, and optimize vaccine distribution strategies considering spatial prioritization. We proposed an integrated spatial model of agent-based model and SEIR (susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered). It simulated spatiotemporal process of COVID-19 transmission in a realistic urban context. Individual movements were represented by trajectories of 8146 randomly sampled mobile phone users on Dec 28, 2016 in Guangzhou, China,90% of whom aged 18-60.

Scenario 3-6 applied four vaccination strategies (random strategy, age strategy, space strategy, and space & age strategy), and identified the optimal vaccine strategy. Scenario 7 assessed the most appropriate vaccine coverage. The results demonstrates herd immunity is heterogeneously distributed in space, thus, vaccine intervention strategies should be spatialized. Among four strategies, space & age strategy is substantially most efficient, with 7.7% fewer in attack rate and 44 days longer than random strategy under 20% vaccine uptake.

Within months scientists all over the world have developed promising new vaccines, many of which use adenoviral vectors to incorporate immunogenic molecules of SARS-coronavirus in order to elicit effective immune responses. The Gamaleya institute developed the COVID-19 vaccine named Sputnik (Gam-COVID-Vac) using adenoviral vectors ad 26 and ad5 to incorporate a full SARS-Spike Protein for vaccination. Two differing vectors enable so called prime-boost, thus avoiding neutralizing effects against the vector itself, ensuring proper immunogenicity against the vaccine. Current available published evidence has raised controversy among small sample sizes in phase II and early endpoints in phase III studies with Sputnik and scientific community took notice that full study protocols and clinical data haven't been made available yet. Patient subgroups and vaccination efficacy in healthy vaccinated may be at risk in case of partial viral replication of Ad5 vectors or when batch to batch reproducibility is not warranted, as concerns from authorities in Brazil and Slovakia have recently been raised.

Basophils constitute a homogeneous population of CD4-CD19-CD49b+IgE+ cells in flow cytometric analysis. When IgE levels are low, one can also use anti-FcÎµRI or anti-CD200R3 antibodies instead of anti-IgE. For immunofluorescence staining, we use an anti-Mcpt8 antibody since Mcpt8 is a specific marker for murine basophils.

386266,Audio Interview: What Earlier Epidemics Teach Us about Covid-19,2021,"Mastocytosis is a neoplasm characterized by an accumulation of mast cells in various organs and increased risk for severe anaphylaxis in patients with concomitant allergies. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a pandemic that is associated with a relatively high rate of severe lung disease and mortality. The mortality is particularly high in those with certain comorbidities and increases with age. Recently, several companies have developed an effective vaccination against COVID-19. Although the reported frequency of severe side effects is low, there is an emerging discussion about the safety of COVID-19 vaccination in patients with severe allergies and mastocytosis. However, even in these patients, severe adverse reactions are rare. We therefore recommend the broad use of COVID-19 vaccination in patients with mastocytosis on a global basis. The only well-established exception is a known or suspected allergy against a constituent of the vaccine. Safety measures, including premedication and postvaccination observation, should be considered in all patients with mastocytosis, depending on the individual personal risk and overall situation in each case. The current article provides a summary of published data, observations, and expert opinion that form the basis of these recommendations.","Bonadonna, Patrizia; Brockow, Knut; Niedoszytko, Marek; Elberink, Hanneke Oude; Akin, Cem; Nedoszytko, Boguslaw; Butterfield, Joseph H; Alvarez-Twose, Ivan; Sotlar, Karl; Schwaab, Juliana; Jawhar, Mohamad; Castells, Mariana; Sperr, Wolfgang R; Hermine, Olivier; Gotlib, Jason; Zanotti, Roberta; Reiter, Andreas; Broesby-Olsen, Sigurd; Bindslev-Jensen, Carsten; Schwartz, Lawrence B; Horny, Hans-Peter; Radia, Deepti; Triggiani, Massimo; Sabato, Vito; Carter, Melody C; Siebenhaar, Frank; Orfao, Alberto; Grattan, Clive; Metcalfe, Dean D; Arock, Michel; Gulen, Theo; Hartmann, Karin; Valent, Peter",J Allergy Clin Immunol Pract,,114

More than 6,000 people were diagnosed in this city within a four-week period, and both medical system breakdown and increasing mortality were imminent. However, we minimized fatalities despite this explosive outbreak in a short time. The collaboration between the Daegu Medical Association and the local government may provide a reference model for overcoming regional outbreaks in the global pandemic era. We can prevent the shortage of medical resources by recruiting volunteer doctors and nurses early through public awareness campaigns. We can overcome the first massive outbreak using several new diagnostic and therapeutic systems such as the drive-through diagnosis system, telephonic counseling for self-quarantine patients by volunteer doctors, and therapeutic living centers. Both sharing the process of collaboration with the public system and summarizing the factors can provide useful information for building effective response systems to cope with the ongoing local outbreak of COVID-19 and any future epidemics of infectious diseases.","Kim, Dae-Hyun; Min, Pok-Kee",J.

In this work, we propose a two-stage nonparametric approach to address this problem. We first extract the de-noised data and their higher order derivatives using boundary kernel method, and then feed them into a sparsely connected deep neural network with ReLU activation function. Our method is able to recover the ODE system without being subject to the curse of dimensionality and complicated ODE structure. When the ODE possesses a general modular structure, with each modular component involving only a few input variables, and the network architecture is properly chosen, our method is proven to be consistent. Theoretical properties are corroborated by an extensive simulation study that demonstrates the validity and effectiveness of the proposed method. Finally, we use our method to simultaneously characterize the growth rate of Covid-19 infection cases from 50 states of the USA.","Li, Kexuan; Wang, Fangfang; Liu, Ruiqi; Yang, Fan; Shang, Zuofeng",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.03591v1.pdf,114

The objective of this training tool was to improve the preparedness of health care workers and the control measures to manage any respiratory infection outbreaks. Also, to provide good patient care and patient safety during the sudden outbreak of SARS-CoV-2, the pathogen causing pandemic respiratory infection outbreak worldwide. Methods: Simulated patient environment is a kind of functional mock drill that was applied to assess and improve the readiness of the healthcare workers of the hospital to identify the patient at the screening area, guide the patient for investigation and inform the public health system during an outbreak of an infection. The faculty of the Department of Microbiology, Community and Family Medicine, and General Medicine were the educators and demonstrators. Fifty healthcare workers from All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Mangalagiri, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MOHFW), Government of India, such as doctors, epidemiologists, nurses, laboratory technicians, laboratory attendants, members of infection control team and biomedical waste management team participated in this program. Results: Statistical analysis of the results with pre-intervention and post-intervention assessments and feedback from the participants was done at the end of the program. The difference between the mean of pre-intervention and post-intervention scores in doctors, nurses, and other health care professionals was statistically very highly significant (P-value &lt;0.001). Conclusion: The training method was the simulation of management of pandemic respiratory infection outbreaks in the most realistic manner possible to test or evaluate the capability of more than one function in the context of an emergency event. An in-situ simulation is an effective method that is close to real-life scenario, to measure the readiness and effectiveness of an emergency response plan. Hence, it is a useful tool to assess disaster preparedness against any type of outbreak.","Mangayarkarasi, V. Babu Arumugam M. K.; Debnath, D. J.",Advances in Medical Education &amp; Practice,,114

This epidemic infects a lot of individuals in Egypt. The World Health Organization states that COVID-19 could be spread from one person to another at a very fast speed through contact and respiratory spray. On these days, Egypt and all countries worldwide should rise to an effective step to investigate this disease and eliminate the effects of this epidemic. In this paper displayed, the real database of COVID-19 for Egypt has been analysed from February 15, 2020, to June 15, 2020, and predicted with the number of patients that will be infected with COVID-19, and estimated the epidemic final size. Several regression analysis models have been applied for data analysis of COVID-19 of Egypt. In this study, we've been applied seven regression analysis-based models that are exponential polynomial, quadratic, third-degree, fourth-degree, fifth-degree, sixth-degree, and logit growth respectively for the COVID-19 dataset. Thus, the exponential, fourth-degree, fifth-degree, and sixth-degree polynomial regression models are excellent models specially fourth-degree model that will help the government preparing their procedures for one month. In addition, we have applied the well-known logit growth regression model and we obtained the following epidemiological insights: Firstly, the epidemic peak could possibly reach at 22-June 2020 and final time of epidemic at 8-September 2020. Secondly, the final total size for cases 1.6676E+05 cases.

394126,"Retraction notice to ""Facemasks in the COVID-19 era: A health hypothesis"" [Medical Hypotheses 146 (2021) 5]",2021,"Dexamethasone, a synthetic glucocorticoid, has previously shown mortality benefit in severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in a randomized controlled trial. As the illness is considered to reflect a hyperinflammatory state, this therapeutic effectiveness is presumably ascribed to broad anti-inflammatory activities of glucocorticoids. Here, an unbiased analysis of available transcriptomic data on lung and blood immune cells from severe COVID-19 patients and matching cellular models of dexamethasone treatment is presented that supports this presumption. Comparison of differentially expressed genes in severe COVID-19 with that in dexamethasone treated cells reveals a small set of genes that are regulated in opposite direction between the disease and the drug, and are enriched for genes and processes related to glucocorticoid pathway and receptor binding. This expression signature differentiates as a whole various cytokines from a set of anti-cytokine/anti-inflammatory agents, with the former resembling COVID-19 and the latter dexamethasone in gene regulation. The signature apparently relates to TNF- &#945;, IL-1&#945;, IL-1ß, IFN-&#945;, IFN-ß, and IFN-Î³ signaling, but not IL-6 signaling, suggesting that therapeutic effect of dexamethasone in COVID-19 does not involve IL-6 pathway. However, as all these observations are purely based on bioinformatic analysis, experimental evidence will be required to validate the inferences drawn. In conclusion, the present analysis seems to provide a proof of concept for therapeutic mechanisms of dexamethasone in COVID-19.","Sharma, Abhay",Gene,,114
394140,Minimizing the risk of COVID-19 among patients on dialysis,2020,"BACKGROUND: Several COVID-19 vaccine efficacy trials are ongoing with others predicted to start soon. Diagnostic work-up of trial participants following any COVID-19 associated symptom will lead to extensive testing, potentially overwhelming laboratory capacity whilst primarily yielding negative results. We aimed to identify an efficient symptom combination to capture most cases using the lowest possible number of tests. METHODS: UK and US users of the COVID-19 Symptom Study app who reported new-onset symptoms between March-September 2020 and an RT-PCR test within seven days of symptom onset were included. Sensitivity, specificity, and number of RT-PCR tests needed to identify one RT-PCR positive case were calculated for individual symptoms and symptom combinations. A multi-objective evolutionary algorithm was applied to generate symptom combinations with good trade-offs between sensitivity and specificity. FINDINGS: The UK dataset included 122,305 individuals (1,202 RT-PCR positive). Findings were replicated in a US dataset including 3,162 individuals (79 RT-PCR positive). Within three days of symptom onset, the COVID-19 specific symptom combination (cough, dyspnoea, fever, anosmia/ageusia) identified 69% of cases requiring 47 RT-PCR tests per positive case. The symptom combination with the highest sensitivity was fatigue, anosmia, cough, diarrhoea, headache, and sore throat, identifying 96% of cases and requiring 96 tests. INTERPRETATION: We confirm the significance of COVID-19 specific symptoms widely recommended for triggering RT-PCR. By using the data-driven optimization technique we identified additional symptoms (fatigue, sore throat, headache, diarrhoea) that enabled many more positive cases to be captured efficiently. By providing a set of solutions with optimal trade-offs between sensitivity and specificity, we produced a selection of symptom subsets that maximise the capture of cases given different laboratory capacities. The methodology may be of particular use for COVID-19 vaccine developers across a range of resource settings and have more far-reaching public health implications for detection of symptomatic SARS CoV2 infection.","Antonelli, Michela; Capdevila, Joan; Chaudhari, Amol; Granerod, Julia; Canas, Liane; Graham, Mark; Klaser, Kerstin; Modat, Marc; Moldeni, Erica; Murray, Ben; Sudre, Carole; Davies, Richard; May, Anna; Nguyen, Long; Drew, David; Joshi, Amit; Chan, Andrew; Cramer, Jakob; Spector, Tim; Wolf, Jonathan; Ourselin, Sebastien; Steves, Claire; Loeliger, Alfred E",,,114

394280,Problematics of insurance companies that failed to pay the customer,2021,"OBJECTIVES: The study aims to assess the impact of the second COVID-19 pandemic wave on migraine characteristics. METHODS: This is an observational cross-sectional study conducted on migraine patients previously interviewed during the first Italian pandemic outbreak. A second structured telephone interview was conducted between 20 November 2020 and 18 January 2021. We compared migraine characteristics among T0 (before pandemic), T1 (during the first pandemic phase), and T2 (during the second pandemic phase). RESULTS: Among the 433 patients interviewed during the first pandemic phase, 304 cases were finally considered. One hundred forty-eight patients had a control visit between March 2020 and December 2020, 120 had an in-person visit, 14 by phone, the remainder used telemedicine software provided by the hospital. Frequency of headache, number of symptomatic drugs and headache intensity worsened during T2, compared to T0 and T1, especially in episodic migraine. Headache intensity increased relating to the negative emotional impact of the pandemic. Migraine management during the pandemic did not influence the clinical outcome. CONCLUSION: The prolongation of the pandemic seems to have a negative impact on migraine evolution. The arousal and negative psychological behavior toward the COVID-19 outbreak seem to worsen migraine.","Gentile, E.; Delussi, M.; Abagnale, C.; Caponnetto, V.; De Cesaris, F.; Frattale, I.; Guaschino, E.; Marcinno, A.; Ornello, R.; Pistoia, F.; Putorti, A.; Candida, G.; Roveta, F.; Lupi, C.; Coppola, G.; Prudenzano, A.

395222,Nature as Ally in Our Chronic Disease Epidemic,2020,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is one of the most destructive pandemic after millennium, forcing the world to tackle a health crisis. Automated classification of lung infections from chest X-ray (CXR) images strengthened traditional healthcare strategy to handle COVID-19. However, classifying COVID-19 from pneumonia cases using CXR image is challenging because of shared spatial characteristics, high feature variation in infections and contrast diversity between cases. Moreover, massive data collection is impractical for a newly emerged disease, which limited the performance of common deep learning models. To address this challenging topic, Multiscale Attention Guided deep network with Soft Distance regularization (MAG-SD) is proposed to automatically classify COVID-19 from pneumonia CXR images. In MAG-SD, MA-Net is used to produce prediction vector and attention map from multiscale feature maps. To relieve the shortage of training data, attention guided augmentations along with a soft distance regularization are posed, which requires a few labeled data to generate meaningful augmentations and reduce noise. Our multiscale attention model achieves better classification performance on our pneumonia CXR image dataset. Plentiful experiments are proposed for MAG-SD which demonstrates that it has its unique advantage in pneumonia classification over cuttingedge models. The code is available at https://github.com/ JasonLeeGHub/MAG-SD.","Li, Jingxiong; Wang, Yaqi; Wang, Shuai; Wang, Jun; Liu, Jun; Jin, Qun; Sun, Lingling",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.02278v1.pdf,114
395421,Oxytocin as a potential defence against Covid-19?,2020,"A cell-surface heparan proteoglycan called Syndecan-1 (SDC-1) has multiple roles in healthy and pathogenic conditions, including respiratory viral infection. In this study, we explore the dynamic alternation in the levels of SDC-1 in cases with COVID-19. A total of 120 cases definitely diagnosed with COVID-19 were admitted to the Firoozgar Hospital, Tehran, Iran, from December 1, 2020, to January 29, 2021, and included in our study. Also, 58 healthy subjects (HS) were chosen as the control group. Patients were classified into two groups: 1) ICU patients and (63 cases) 2) non-ICU patients (57 cases). The dynamic changes of serum SCD-1, CRP, IL-6, IL-10, IL-18, and Vit D levels a well as the disease activity were investigated in three-time points (T1-T3). Our results indicated that the COVID-19 patients had significantly increased SCD-1, CRP, IL-6, IL-10, and IL-18 levels than in HS, while the Vit D levels in COVID-19 patients were significantly lower than HS. Further analysis demonstrated that the SCD-1, CRP, IL-6, IL-10, and IL-18 levels in ICU patients were significantly higher than in non-ICU patients. Tracking dynamic changes in the above markers indicated that on the day of admission, the SCD-1, CRP, IL-6, IL-10, and IL-18 levels were gradually increased on day 5 (T2) and then gradually decreased on day 10 (T3). ROC curve analysis suggests that markers mentioned above, SDC-1, IL-6, and IL-18 are valuable indicators in evaluating the activity of COVID-19. All in all, it seems that the serum SDC-1 levels alone or combined with other markers might be a good candidate for disease activity monitoring.","Karampoor, Sajad; Zahednasab, Hamid; Farahmand, Mohammad; Mirzaei, Rasoul; Zamani, Farhad; Tabibzadeh, Alireza; Bouzari, Behnaz; Ajdarkosh, Hossein; Nikkhah, Mehdi; Hashemi, Melika Razavi; Laali, Azadeh; Keyvani, Hossein",Int Immunopharmacol,,114
395468,Weighing the Cost of Obesity: One Solution Does Not Fit All For This Complicated Disease,2020,"OBJECTIVES: A high frequency and a strong association of olfactory/gustatory impairment with COVID-19 were reported. Its spontaneous evolution remains unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate the spontaneous evolution of olfactory disorders in COVID-19 patients. STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. METHODS: A total of 229 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 from March 1 through 31, 2020 in our institution were included. Among them, 140 patients (mean age, 38.5 years, 89 women) reported sudden olfactory/gustatory disorders during COVID-19. All patients were interviewed by phone based on a questionnaire with 16 questions at time of survey. The primary end point was olfactory recovery rate at time of survey. RESULTS: The frequency of patients with olfactory disorders was higher before March 20, 2020 than since (70.3% vs. 53.9%, respectively) (P = .016). At time of survey (26 days of the mean time from anosmia onset), 95.71% reported to start an olfactory recovery. The mean time from olfactory loss onset to recovery onset was 11.6 days. Recovery started between the fourth and the fifteenth day after olfactory loss onset in 78.4% of patients. Complete olfactory recovery happened for 51.43% of patients. There was a significant relationship between the complete olfactory recovery and a short time from olfactory loss onset to recovery onset (P = .0004), absence of nasal obstruction (P = .023) and absence of sore/dry/tingling feeling in the nose (P = .007) in COVID-19 patients. CONCLUSION: Knowledge of spontaneous evolution of olfactory disorders allows reassuring patients and planning therapeutic strategies for persistent olfactory dysfunction after having definitely recovered from COVID-19.

396246,How coronavirus related shutdowns affected addretion,2020,"The 2020 COVID-19 pandemic has rendered in-person provision of genetic counseling impossible for prolonged periods in many countries, mandating a sudden shift to remote delivery. We used qualitative thematic analysis to explore Italian genetics professionals' experience with remote genetic counseling. Fourteen group and four individual interviews were conducted after participants had delivered one or more remote sessions via videoconference or on the telephone. Data were coded and grouped under themes. Three main themes were identified as follows: (a) technical and logistical issues, (b) communication issues, and (c) clinical content and outcome of the session. The participants acknowledged that not having to travel to the clinic saves consultands time and expense. They also highlighted that not sharing a physical space with consultands and having to rely on technology can negatively impact on effective communication, building trusting relationships, and performing accurate psychosocial assessments. Regarding the clinical content of sessions, remote genetic counseling was perceived to favor greater focus and succinct, to the point communication. However, participants also felt uncomfortable not being able to use visual aids to support the explanation of complex concepts. Moreover, demographics and the socio-cultural status of consultands emerged as factors influencing the outcome of remote genetic counseling sessions. Finally, participants reported feeling that more experience with this novel approach would improve their confidence and their ability to adapt their counseling skills as appropriate. Based on these findings, we suggest that effective, equitable provision of remote genetic counseling will require an infrastructure that is able to support video counseling, sharing of clinical documents and visual aids, and connect with a wide range of devices. Moreover, the structure of sessions should be tailored to the specific requirements of remote genetic counseling and suitable training efforts should be promoted to enhance professionals' communication skills.","Turchetti, Daniela; Battistuzzi, Linda; Bertonazzi, Benedetta; Godino, Lea",J. genet. couns,,114
396616,Beta-thalassemia may protect against COVID 19,2020,"ABSTRACT: To date, there is lack of specific effective treatment or vaccine for the SARS-CoV-2, and clinical and laboratory research is still ongoing to find successful drugs. Therefore, prevention to be infected through social distancing and isolation is the most effective way. However, all the other physical and mental illnesses continue to exist, if possible even more burdened by the emergency situation and social distancing. The COVID-19 pandemic, especially in many low- and middle-income countries, has caused a deeper gap in seeking psychiatric help. In this scenario, telepsychiatry could play a decisive role in implementing clinical care for frail patients and ensuring continuous mental care. Therefore, we felt the urge to write this article to express our hope that the old health care system at this time of crisis, as we know it, can offer the chance to implement pervasive care technologies that perfectly fit current psychiatric needs.","Diwan, Mufaddal Najmuddin; Ali Awan, Hashir; Aamir, Alifiya; de Filippis, Renato; Ullah, Irfan",J Nerv Ment Dis,,114

397246,Doctors and nurses during COVID19pandemic: A different perception of cancer care,2020,"INTRODUCTION: Numerous concerns regarding maintenance of blood inventory have been raised after SARS-CoV-2 pandemic outbreak. These concerns were based on the experience of blood centres in previous pandemics where shortage of blood components was reported. The present study had tried to understand the impact of SARS-CoV-2 pandemic on blood collection and demand as well as the impact of disaster planning in maintaining an adequate inventory. METHODS: Data related to blood supply and demand were collected retrospectively using blood bank management software for pre-COVID-19 and COVID-19 time period and compared. Strategies adopted and effects of changes in existing disaster plans to maintain an adequate inventory were studied. RESULTS: A drastic fall in the red cell inventory was observed as compared to pre-COVID-19 time period was observed due to disproportionate decrease in blood collection (1/6 to 1/9 of the previous collection) and demand (1/2 of the previous demand). The buffer stock fell gradually over a period of three weeks with cancellation of planned blood donation drives. A buffer stock equivalent to 2-week inventory led to adequate inventory in the initial lockdown periods. Similar fall was observed in the platelet inventory with reduction in the blood collection but almost a proportionate reduction in the platelet demand led to adequate inventory. No increase in wastage was observed for both red cells and platelets during this period. DISCUSSION: A buffer stock of blood and blood components, strict adherence to the transfusion triggers, good coordination with the clinical staff and a prospective review of blood transfusion requests to ensure rational blood transfusion were some of the steps which helped us to successfully maintain transfusion requirements in the initial phases of the COVID-19 pandemic. Use of first-in-first-out policy prevented any wastage due to outdating of blood.","Pandey, Hem Chandra; Coshic, Poonam; C S, Chippy; Arcot, Priyadarsini Jayachandran; Kumar, Karan",Vox sang,,114

The coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), has spread quickly to more than 213 countries and claimed 395,779 lives as of June 7, 2020. Notably, in several studies, diabetes is one of the most reported comorbidities in patients with severe COVID-19. SCOPE OF REVIEW: In this review, I summarize the clinical data on the risk for infectious diseases in individuals with diabetes while highlighting the mechanisms for altered immune regulation. The focus is on coronaviruses. Based on the new clinical data obtained from COVID-19 patients, a discussion of mechanisms, such as cytokine storm, pulmonary and endothelial dysfunction, and hypercoagulation, that may render individuals with diabetes more vulnerable to COVID-19 is provided. MAJOR CONCLUSIONS: Epidemiological studies show that poorly controlled diabetes is a risk factor for various infectious diseases. Given the global burden of diabetes and the pandemic nature of coronaviruses, understanding how diabetes affects COVID-19 severity is critical to designing tailored treatments and clinical management of individuals affected by diabetes.","Erener, Suheda",Mol Metab,,114

398756,COVID-19 and picotechnology: Potential opportunities,2020,"Conventional predictive Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) commonly employ deterministic weight matrices; therefore, their prediction is a point estimate. Such a deterministic nature in ANNs causes the limitations of using ANNs for medical diagnosis, law problems, and portfolio management, in which discovering not only the prediction but also the uncertainty of the prediction is essentially required. To address such a problem, we propose a predictive probabilistic neural network model, which corresponds to a different manner of using the generator in conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN) that has been routinely used for conditional sample generation. By reversing the input and output of ordinary cGAN, the model can be successfully used as a predictive model; besides, the model is robust against noises since adversarial training is employed. In addition, to measure the uncertainty of predictions, we introduce the entropy and relative entropy for regression problems and classification problems, respectively. The proposed framework is applied to stock market data and an image classification task. As a result, the proposed framework shows superior estimation performance, especially on noisy data; moreover, it is demonstrated that the proposed framework can properly estimate the uncertainty of predictions.","Lee, Minhyeok; Seok, Junhee",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.00334v1.pdf,114

399348,Amantadine Treatment for People with COVID-19,2020,"Recent studies suggest that the COVID-19 pandemic has increased alcohol sales and alcohol related problems. This may be due to the synergistic effects of unemployment, stress from childcare or additional caregiving responsibilities, reduced social interactions and negative coping strategies. Weerakoon and colleagues set out to identify the most robust risk factors for alcohol consumption, binge drinking, and changes in drinking patterns due to the COVID-19 pandemic. One-third of the sample reported consuming more alcohol after COVID-19 compared to pre-COVID-19. In addition, each additional week spent at home under stay-at-home orders was increased the odds of binge drinking by 19%. Individuals who have been diagnosed with depression and were currently experiencing depressive symptoms were more than three times more likely (OR = 3.37) to have increased their alcohol consumption during COVID-19 compared to those with no history or symptoms of depression. Parents of children was associated with decreased COVID-19 related binge drinking (OR = .74). As many daily life factors have been altered due to the pandemic, a more holistic lifestyle disruption construct may help further investigate the long term effects of social isolation on alcohol use as the pandemic continues. Furthermore, the role of social support in mitigating COVID-19-related stress has yet to be examined and may be a protective factor against alcohol related problems. As stress continues, researchers should continue assessing the longitudinal effects of COVID-19 lockdowns with the goal of early identification for those at the highest risk of problematic alcohol use.","Molsberry, Rebecca; Maskaly, Jon; Reingle Gonzalez, Jennifer M",Am J Drug Alcohol Abuse,,114

Under controlled conditions, aerosol particles can travel up to a distance of 28 feet (or 8 m); however, such aerosol particles are less likely to have sufficient quantities of viable viruses to spread infection. Additionally, nearly all the experimental models examined the behavior of the aerosols only in confined spaces, not in open areas; these findings, therefore, cannot be considered generally applicable. In the absence of scientific information and education, only misconceptions, unfounded fears, and unsubstantiated myths will prevail. Given that an effective vaccine and drugs are still not available, prevention remains the only option of protection against SARS-CoV-2, the new coronavirus.

METHODS: We queried the 2002-2016 National Inpatient Sample database for hospitalized patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction who underwent isolated coronary artery bypass grafting. We report temporal trends, predictors, and outcomes of coronary artery bypass grafting in the early (2002-2010) and recent (2011-2016) cohorts. RESULTS: Of 3,347,470 patients hospitalized for ST-elevation myocardial infarction, 7.7% underwent isolated coronary artery bypass grafting. The incidence of isolated coronary artery bypass grafting after ST-elevation myocardial infarction decreased over time (9.2% in 2002 vs 5.5% in 2016, Ptrend < .001), whereas perioperative crude in-hospital mortality did not change (5.1% in 2002 vs 4.2% in 2016, Ptrend = .66), coinciding with an increase in the burden of comorbidities. There was an increase in performing isolated coronary artery bypass grafting on hospitalization day 3 or more, as well as an increase in the use of mechanical support devices and precoronary artery bypass grafting percutaneous coronary intervention. In the early cohort, isolated coronary artery bypass grafting on days 1 and 2 was associated with higher in-hospital mortality. In the recent cohort, coronary artery bypass grafting on day 2 had similar in-hospital mortality compared with day 3 or more and lower rates of acute kidney injury, ischemic stroke, ventricular arrhythmia, and length of hospital stay. CONCLUSIONS: In this nationwide analysis, there has been a decline in the use of isolated coronary artery bypass grafting after ST-elevation myocardial infarction. Isolated coronary artery bypass grafting on day 1 was performed in sicker patients and was associated with higher in-hospital mortality than coronary artery bypass grafting performed on day 3 or more. In the recent cohort, isolated coronary artery bypass grafting on day 2 had similar in-hospital mortality compared with day 3 or more.","Elbadawi, Ayman; Elzeneini, Mohammed; Elgendy, Islam Y; Megaly, Michael; Omer, Mohamed; Jimenez, Ernesto; Ghanta, Ravi K; Brilakis, Emmanouil S; Jneid, Hani",J. thorac. cardiovasc. sur,,114

405418,Covid-19 in cancer and non-cancer patients,2021,"OBJECTIVE: During the COVID-19 pandemic, there was a temporary cessation of mammography screening. However, in some facilities, diagnostic breast imaging services continued for patients with a high clinical suspicion of breast cancer. The objective of this study was to evaluate changes in the diagnostic interval (DI) of non-screening patients presenting for diagnostic mammography during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Retrospective chart review was performed on patients presenting for non-screening diagnostic mammography from April 1 to June 30, 2020 (pandemic group) and April 1 to June 30, 2019 (pre-pandemic group). Age, reason for referral, number and type of imaging studies/biopsies necessary for a final diagnosis were recorded. Diagnostic interval (DI) was defined as the number of days from the date of the diagnostic mammogram to the date of the final diagnosis. RESULTS: Compared to the pre-pandemic group (n = 64), the pandemic group (n = 77) showed a reduction in DI of the entire cohort (pandemic: 1 day; pre-pandemic: 15 days, p < 0.0001) for patients not requiring tissue sampling (pandemic: 1 day; pre-pandemic: 11 days, .p < 0.0001) and those requiring tissue sampling with benign pathology (pandemic 9 days; pre-pandemic, 33 days, p = 0.0002). A higher percentage of patients in the pandemic group had their assessment completed during the initial visit (pandemic: 50.6%; pre-pandemic: 23.4%, p = 0.0009). CONCLUSION: During the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, the DI for patients with non-screening-related diagnostic mammography was significantly shorter, with a higher percentage of patients completing their assessments on the initial visit, compared to one year prior. KEY POINTS: â¢ Despite reductions in manpower and clinical services, during pandemic times, it is possible to maintain a diagnostic breast imaging service for women at high clinical suspicion for breast cancer. â¢ During pandemic times, breast imaging departments should consider restructuring to a Rapid Diagnostic Unit model with a navigation team that follows patients through the assessment process to a final diagnosis. â¢ Departmental restructuring and patient navigation during pandemic times could either maintain or shorten the diagnostic interval for patients presenting for diagnostic mammography.","Crivellaro, Priscila; Tafur, Monica; George, Ralph; Muradali, Derek",Eur. radiol,,114
405791,COVID-19: a recommendation to examine the effect of hydroxychloroquine in preventing infection and progression,2020,"In December 2019, an outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) emerged in Wuhan, China. Although it has been reported that some COVID-19 patients showed elevated liver biochemistries, there are few studies regarding clinical features and prognosis of these patients. In this multicenter, retrospective study, we collected data on laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients from three hospitals in Wuhan, China, who died or were discharged between February 1, 2020, and February 20, 2020. The data on demographics, comorbidities, clinical symptoms, laboratory examinations on admission, complications, treatment, and outcome were collected. A total of 482 patients were enrolled in this study. Of those, 142 (29.5%) patients showed abnormal liver biochemistries on admission, and patients with elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and total bilirubin (TBIL) accounted for 67.6%, 69.0%, and 16.2%, respectively. Those with abnormal liver biochemistries showed higher percentages of severe cases and comorbidities and were more likely to have dyspnea, chest distress or pain, and increased hemoglobin (Hb) on admission. Higher rates of complications and mortality and worse recovery when discharged were observed in patients with abnormal AST or TBIL. The multivariable regression analysis showed that chest distress or pain (odds ratio [OR], 1.765; P = 0.018), dyspnea (OR, 2.495; P = 0.001), elevated C-reactive protein [CRP] level (OR, 1.007; P = 0.008), elevated white blood count (WBC) (OR, 1.139; P = 0.013), and elevated Hb concentration (OR, 1.024; P = 0.001) were independent factors associated with elevated liver biochemistries in COVID-19 patients. Conclusion: Elevated liver biochemistries were common in COVID-19 patients. Patients with hypoxia or severe inflammation are more likely to experience increased liver biochemistries on admission. Those with abnormal AST or TBIL on admission are more likely to suffer from severe complications and death.","Fu, Yu; Zhu, Rui; Bai, Tao; Han, Ping; He, Qin; Jing, Mengjia; Xiong, Xiaofeng; Zhao, Xi; Quan, Runze; Chen, Chaoyue; Zhang, Ying; Tao, Meihui; Yi, Jianhua; Tian, Dean; Yan, Wei",Hepatology (Baltim.),,114
405929,Clinical Guidelines for Cancer Chemotherapy under COVID-19 in the World,2021,"PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the adoption and outcomes of locally designed reporting guidelines for patients with possible coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). METHODS: A departmental guideline was developed for radiologists that specified reporting terminology and required communication for patients with imaging findings suggestive of COVID-19, on the basis of patient test status and imaging indication. In this retrospective study, radiology reports completed from March 1, 2020, to May 3, 2020, that mentioned COVID-19 were reviewed. Reports were divided into patients with known COVID-19, patients with ""suspected"" COVID-19 (having an order indication of respiratory or infectious signs or symptoms), and ""unsuspected patients"" (other order indications, eg, trauma or non-chest pain). The primary outcome was the percentage of COVID-19 reports using recommended terminology; the secondary outcome was percentages of suspected and unsuspected patients diagnosed with COVID-19. Relationships between categorical variables were assessed using the Fisher exact test. RESULTS: Among 77,400 total reports, 1,083 suggested COVID-19 on the basis of imaging findings; 774 of COVID-19 reports (71%) used recommended terminology. Of 574 patients without known COVID-19 at the time of interpretation, 345 (60%) were eventually diagnosed with COVID-19, including 61% (315 of 516) of suspected and 52% (30 of 58) of unsuspected patients. Nearly all unsuspected patients (46 of 58) were identified on CT. CONCLUSIONS: Radiologists rapidly adopted recommended reporting terminology for patients with suspected COVID-19. The majority of patients for whom radiologists raised concern for COVID-19 were subsequently diagnosed with the disease, including the majority of clinically unsuspected patients. Using unambiguous terminology and timely notification about previously unsuspected patients will become increasingly critical to facilitate COVID-19 testing and contact tracing as states begin to lift restrictions.","Hammer, Mark M; Zhao, Anna H; Hunsaker, Andetta R; Mendicuti, Alejandra Duran; Sodickson, Aaron D; Boland, Giles W; Khorasani, Ramin",J Am Coll Radiol,,114

This situation invites us to review the different types of involuntary admission that our legal system provides and how involuntary medical treatment is regulated according to its purpose and the patient's ability to decide. In the field of public health, the determining element to be able to impose any sanitary measure against the will of the patient is the risk to the health of the population. In the case presented, the judge rejects the possibility of authorizing medical treatment for not contributing anything from the point of view of public health.

We exploit spatial variation in exposure to COVID-19 related infections and lockdown measures along with temporal differences in our outcomes of interest using a difference-in-difference approach. We find that those households exposed to higher COVID-19 cases or mobility lockdowns experience a significant increase in measures of food insecurity. Examining possible transmission channels for this effect, we find that COVID-19 significantly reduces labor market participation and increases food prices. We find that impacts differ by economic activities and households. For instance, lockdown measures increased households' experience of food insecurity by 13 percentage points and reduced the probability of participation in non-farm business activities by 11 percentage points. These lockdown measures have smaller impacts on wage-related activities and farming activities. In terms of food security, households relying on non-farm businesses, poorer households, those with school-aged children, and those living in remote and conflicted-affected zones have experienced relatively larger deteriorations in food security. These findings can help inform immediate and medium-term policy responses, including social protection policies aiming at ameliorating the impacts of the pandemic, as well as guide targeting strategies of governments and international donor agencies by identifying the most impacted sub-populations.","Amare, M.; Abay, K.

Recommendations of the COVID-19 Task Force of the 2020 Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplantation Research Center Outcomes Forum,2021,"(STATE-XXX = Wisconsin). ABSTRACT: Objective: To describe the incidence of COVID-19 in STATE-XXX high school athletes, and to investigate the relationship of COVID-19 incidence with sport and face mask use.Design: Retrospective survey.Setting: High schools across STATE-XXX during September, 2020.Participants: Athletic directors representing 30,074 high school athletes with and without SARS-CoV-2.Independent Variables: COVID-19 rates among athletes, counties, and STATE-XXX, school instruction type (virtual vs in-person), sport type, face mask use.Main Outcome Measurements: Reported athlete case rates compared to their county's general population. Associations between COVID-19 incidence and sport type and face mask use, adjusting for each school's county incidence using multivariable negative binomial regression models.Results: COVID-19 incidence rates for 207 of 244 responding schools were 32.6 cases per 100,000 player-days. Reported case rates for athletes in each county were positively correlated with the county's general population case rates (ß=1.14±0.20, r=0.60, p<0.001). One case (0.5%) was attributed to sport contact by the reporting schools. No difference was identified between team and individual sports (incidence rate ratio (IRR)=1.03 [95% CI=0.49-2.2], p=0.93) or between non-contact and contact sports (IRR=0.53 [0.23-1.3], p=0.14). Outdoor sports had a lower incidence rate than indoor sports, although this did not reach statistical significance (IRR=0.52 [0.26-1.1], p=0.07). There were no significant associations between COVID-19 incidence and face mask use during play for those sports with greater than 50 schools reporting on face mask use (p>0.05 for all).Conclusions: Incidence of reported COVID-19 among high school athletes was related to county incidence and most cases were attributed to non-sport contact. A lower COVID-19 incidence in outdoor sports approached statistical significance. The lack of a significant benefit of face mask use may be due to relatively low rates of COVID-19 in STATE-XXX during September 2020.

410439,Audio Interview: Covid-19 Vaccines and Pregnancy - A Conversation with CDC Director Rochelle Walensky,2021,"INTRODUCTION: Although there is evidence to suggest a high rate of cerebrovascular complications in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, anecdotal reports indicate a falling rate of new ischemic stroke diagnoses. We conducted an exploratory single-center analysis to estimate the change in number of new stroke diagnoses in our region, and evaluate the proximate reasons for this change during the COVID-19 pandemic at a tertiary care center in New Jersey. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A Comprehensive Stroke Center prospective cohort was retrospectively analyzed for the number of stroke admissions, demographic features, and short-term outcomes 5 months prior to 3/1/2020 (pre-COVID-19), and in the 6 weeks that followed (COVID-19 period). The primary outcome was the number of new acute stroke diagnoses before and during the COVID-19 period, as well as the potential reasons for a decline in the number of new diagnoses. RESULTS: Of the 328 included patients, 53 (16%) presented in the COVID-19 period. There was a mean fall of 38% in new stroke diagnoses (mean 1.13/day [SD 1.07] from 1.82/day [SD 1.38], p<0.01), which was related to a 59% decline in the number of daily transfers from referral centers (p<0.01), 25% fewer telestroke consultations (p=0.08), and 55% fewer patients presenting directly to our institution by private vehicle (p<0.01) and 29% fewer patients through emergency services (p=0.09). There was no significant change in the monthly number of strokes due to large vessel occlusion (LVO), however the proportion of new LVOs nearly doubled in the COVID-19 period (38% vs. 21%, p=0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The observations at our tertiary care center corroborate anecdotal reports that the number of new stroke diagnoses is falling, which seems related to a smaller proportion of patients seeking healthcare services for milder symptoms. These preliminary data warrant validation in larger, multi-center studies.","Siegler, J E; Heslin, M E; Thau, L; Smith, A; Jovin, T G",J Stroke Cerebrovasc Dis,,114

However, these measures may lead to several skin problems, thereby affecting their performance. Objectives: To analyze skin changes induced by enhanced protective measures and explore possible risk factors. Materials and Methods: A web-based descriptive study was conducted among 212 frontline COVID-19 doctors. Data were collected regarding their demography, duty, use of enhanced protective measures including prophylactic hydroxychloroquine, recent skin changes with affected sites, and possible risk factors. Results: Skin changes were reported by 41.5% of respondents (mean age 34.8 ± 5.6 years) across 210 sites. Hands were involved most commonly in 77.3% of doctors, followed by nasal bridge, cheeks, and retroauricular area. Dryness (84.1%) and skin peeling (79.5%) were the commonest clinical features. Regression model showed prolonged PPE wear (&gt;6 h) adjusted odd's ratio (AOR) 2.9, P = 0.005], heavy sweating [AOR 12.8, P = 0.001] and frequent hand hygiene (&gt;10 times/day) [AOR 3.1, P = 0.0006] to be significant risk factors. Hydroxychloroquine prophylaxis was deemed safe as treatment-emergent adverse events were uncommon (17.4%). Conclusion: Frontline doctors have an increased risk of developing skin damage due to enhanced protective measures. Appropriate steps should be taken to address the risk factors and minimize skin damage.

412219,Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine Tolerance in Allergic versus Non-Allergic Individuals,2021,"BACKGROUND: Recent reports have surfaced from the United States Food and Drug Administration hearings in December 2020 regarding the COVID-19 vaccines and study participants who developed facial and/or lip swelling after receiving the newly developed drug. Despite an incidence rate of 0.02% in the vaccine arm of the Moderna mRNA-1273 trial, concerns have been expressed about the association of adverse reactions following soft tissue filler injections and the COVID-19 vaccines. The International Society for Dermatologic and Aesthetic Surgery (ISDS) understands these concerns and has designed the following study. METHODS: A global survey was designed to capture the incidence of adverse events related to: (1) previous soft tissue filler injections, (2) soft tissue filler injections during positive testing for COVID-19, and (3) soft tissue filler injections during and after receiving any of the COVID-19 vaccines globally available. RESULTS: The information of 106 survey participants from 18 different countries was analyzed. 80.2% (n=85) never experienced any adverse reaction following their soft tissue filler injection whereas 15.1% (n=16) experienced swelling and 4.7% (n=5) experienced pain that lasted longer than two days. Of those who received at least one dose of the COVID-19 vaccine (n=78), 94.9% reported not to have experienced any adverse reaction related to their previous soft tissue filler injection, whereas 5.1% (n=4) reported to have perceived pain that lasted longer than two days. CONCLUSION: The data collected does not support the concern for an increased risk of developing adverse reactions following soft tissue filler injections associated with the COVID-19 vaccines compared to that risk associated with other previously described triggers or the default risk following soft tissue filler injections.

We evaluated the feasibility and safety of the routine use of transcystic choledochoscopy following IOC (dual common bile duct examination: DCBDE), which may improve the diagnostic accuracy of CBD stones and facilitate one-stage clearance, in LC for suspected choledocholithiasis. METHODS: Between May 2017 and November 2018, 38 patients with suspected choledocholithiasis were prospectively enrolled in this study, regardless of whether they underwent endoscopic sphincterotomy. Transcystic choledochoscopy was routinely attempted following IOC in LC. RESULTS: Five cases were excluded due to cholecystitis, bile duct anomaly, or liver cirrhosis. DCBDE was performed in the remaining 33 patients. The biliary tree was delineated by IOC in all patients. Subsequently, choledochosope was performed in 32 patients except for one who was found to have pancreaticobiliary malunion in IOC. The scope was successfully passed into the CBD in 25 (78.1%) patients. Choledochoscopy detected 3 (9.4%) cases of cystic duct stones and 4 (12.5%) cases of CBD stones which were not identified by IOC. All those stones were removed via cystic duct. There were no intra- and postoperative complications, except for two cases of wound infection and one case of a transient increase in serum amylase. CONCLUSIONS: DCBDE in LC is a safe and promising approach for intraoperative diagnosis and one-stage treatment of suspected choledocholithasis.","Matsumura, Tatsuki; Komatsu, Shunichiro; Komaya, Kenichi; Fukami, Yasuyuki; Arikawa, Takashi; Saito, Takuya; Osawa, Takaaki; Kurahashi, Shintaro; Uchino, Tairin; Kato, Shoko; Toda, Yoko; Kaneko, Kenitiro; Sano, Tsuyoshi",Surg. endosc,,114

413369,Patients most likely to benefit from home-based telerehabilitation after stroke,2021,"PURPOSE: There is a growing concern about the COVID-19 epidemic intensifying in rural areas in the United States (U.S.). In this study, we described the dynamics of COVID-19 cases and deaths in rural and urban counties in the U.S. METHODS: Using data from April 1 to November 12, 2020, from Johns Hopkins University, we estimated COVID-19 incidence and mortality rates and conducted comparisons between urban and rural areas in three time periods at the national level, and in states with higher and lower COVID-19 incidence rates. RESULTS: Results at the national level showed greater COVID-19 incidence rates in urban compared to rural counties in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions of the U.S. at the beginning of the epidemic. However, the intensity of the epidemic has shifted to a rapid surge in rural areas. In particular, high incidence states located in the Mid-west of the country had more than 3,400 COVID-19 cases per 100,000 people compared to 1,284 cases per 100,000 people in urban counties nationwide during the third period (August 30 to November 12). CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the current epicenter of the epidemic is located in states with higher infection rates and mortality in rural areas. Infection prevention and control efforts including healthcare capacity should be scaled up in these vulnerable rural areas.","Cuadros, Diego F; Branscum, Adam J; Mukandavire, Zindoga; Miller, F DeWolfe; MacKinnon, Neil",Ann Epidemiol,,114

STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective study including patients under 18 years of age admitted with SARS-CoV-2 infection from March 1 to April 30, 2020. Infection was confirmed by realtime reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or antibody testing. We describe the epidemiological and clinical data, laboratory and imaging findings, as well as treatment and outcome in these patients. In light of these findings, patients were classified into two severity groups and then compared. RESULTS: Thirty-nine children were included, with a median age of 9 years (range 12 days-16 years); 23 were boys. Cases with uncomplicated disease course (24) mostly presented to the emergency department (ED) with fever and/or respiratory symptoms without significant alterations in laboratory findings. Of the 15 children with a complicated course, 12 developed shock. In addition to fever, they frequently presented altered appearance, extreme tachycardia, abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, rash, and/or conjunctival hyperemia. They also showed greater lymphopenia (p = 0.001), elevated neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (p = 0.001), C-reactive protein (p < 0.001), procalcitonin (p = 0.001), D-dimer (p < 0.001), and ferritin (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 infection in admitted children presents with great clinical variability. When provided supportive care, patients with predominant respiratory symptoms without altered laboratory-test results generally have an uncomplicated course. Patients with complicated disease present mainly with fever and abdominal and/or mucocutaneous symptoms. Most develop shock. Elevation of inflammatory markers may allow for early detection and the final outcome is good.","Storch-de-Gracia, Pilar; Leoz-Gordillo, Inés; Andina, David; Flores, Patricia; Villalobos, Enrique; Escalada-Pellitero, Silvia; Jiménez, Raquel",An Pediatr (Barc),,114
415783,Hematological changes in patients with COVID­19 (Review),2020,"BACKGROUND: Recent reports of COVID-19 patients developing pneumothorax mainly correspond to case reports in mechanically-ventilated patients. The real incidence, clinical characteristics and outcome of spontaneous pneumothorax (SP) as a form of COVID presentation remains to be defined. RESEARCH QUESTION: Do the incidence, risk factors, clinical characteristics and outcomes of SP in COVID-19 patients attending emergency departments (ED) differ compared to COVID patients without SP and non-COVID patients with SP? STUDY DESIGN: and methods: This case-control study retrospectively reviewed all COVID patients diagnosed with SP(case group) in 61 Spanish EDs(20% of Spanish EDs) and compared them with two control groups: COVID patients without SP and non-COVID patients with SP. Relative frequencies of SP were estimated in COVID and non-COVID patients in the ED and annual standardized incidences were estimated for both populations. Comparisons between cases and controls included 52 clinical, analytical and radiological characteristics and 4 outcomes. RESULTS: We identified 40 SP in 71,904 patients with COVID-19 attending EDs(0.56, 95%CI=0.40-0.76). This relative frequency was higher than that of non-COVID patients(387/1,358,134, 0.28, 95%CI=0.26-0.32; OR=1.93, 95%CI=1.41-2.71). The standardized incidence of SP was also higher in COVID patients (34.2 versus 8.2/100,000/year; OR=4.19, 95%CI=3.64-4.81). Compared with COVID patients without SP, COVID patients developing SP more frequently had dyspnea and chest pain, low pulsioxymetry, tachypnea and increased leukocyte count. Compared to non-COVID patients with SP, cases differed in 19 clinical variables, the most prominent being a higher frequency of dysgeusia/anosmia, headache, diarrhea, fever and lymphopenia (all with OR>10). All the outcomes measured, including in-hospital death, were worse in cases than in both control groups. INTERPRETATION: SP as a form of COVID presentation at the ED is unusual (<1 cases) but is more frequent than in the non-COVID population and could be associated with worse outcomes than SP in non-COVID patients and COVID patients without SP.","Miró, Òscar; Llorens, Pere; Jiménez, Sònia; Piñera, Pascual; Burillo-Putze, Guillermo; Martín, Alfonso; Martín-Sánchez, Francisco Javier; García-Lamberetchs, Eric Jorge; Jacob, Javier; Alquézar-Arbé, Aitor; Mòdol, Josep Maria; López-Díez, María Pilar; Guardiola, Josep Maria; Cardozo, Carlos; Lucas Imbernón, Francisco Javier; Tejedo, Alfons Aguirre; García, Ángel García; Grinspan, Martín Ruiz; Roca, Ferran Llopis; González Del Castillo, Juan",Chest,,114

416723,Audio Interview: Viral Variants and Covid-19,2021,"INTRODUCTION: European Neuroendocrine Tumour Society (ENETS) recommends managing appendiceal neuroendocrine tumours (aNET) with appendicectomy and possibly completion right hemicolectomy (CRH). However, disease behaviour and survival patterns remain uncertain. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively assessed the impact of lymph nodes and CRH on outcomes, including survival, in all aNET patients diagnosed between 1990 and 2016. RESULTS: 102 patients (52F, 50 M), median age 39.4 (range 16.3-81.1) years, were diagnosed with aNET. Mean tumour size was 12.7 (range 1-60) mm, most sited in appendiceal tip (63%). Index surgery was appendicectomy in 79% of cases while the remainder underwent colectomy. CRH performed in 30 patients at a median 3.2 (range 1.4-9.8) months post-index surgery yielded residual disease in nine: lymph nodes (n = 8) or residual tumour (n = 1). Univariate logistic regression showed residual disease was significantly predicted by tumour size &#8805;2 cm (p = 0.020). Four patients declined CRH, but did not suffer relapse or reduced survival. One patient developed recurrence after 16.5 years of follow-up and another patient developed a second neuroendocrine tumour after 18.8 years follow-up. There were 5 deaths; one being aNET-related. 5-year and 10-year overall survival were 99% and 92% respectively; 5-year and 10-year relapse-free survival were 98% and 92% respectively. Only 5-year relapse-free survival was affected by ENETS stage (p = 0.002). CONCLUSION: aNETs are indolent with very high rates of overall and relapse-free survival. Recurrence is rare, and in this series only occurred decades later, making a compelling case for selective surveillance and follow-up. The significance of positive lymph nodes and the necessity for completion right hemicolectomy remain unclear.","Alabraba, Edward; Pritchard, David Mark; Griffin, Rebecca; Diaz-Nieto, Rafael; Banks, Melissa; Cuthbertson, Daniel James; Fenwick, Stephen",Eur. j. surg. oncol,,114

417500,Drug-Drug Interactions and Prescription Appropriateness in COVID-19 Patients: A Retrospective Analysis from a Reference Hospital in Northern Italy,2020,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Simulation in cardiovascular medicine may help clinicians understand the important events occurring during mechanical ventilation and circulatory support. During the COVID-19 pandemic, a significant number of patients have required hospital admission to tertiary referral centres for concomitant mechanical ventilation and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Nevertheless, the management of ventilated patients on circulatory support can be quite challenging. Therefore, we sought to review the management of these patients based on the analysis of haemodynamic and energetic parameters using numerical simulations generated by a software package named CARDIOSIM©. METHODS: New modules of the systemic circulation and ECMO were implemented in CARDIOSIM© platform. This is a modular software simulator of the cardiovascular system used in research, clinical and e-learning environment. The new structure of the developed modules is based on the concept of lumped (0-D) numerical modelling. Different ECMO configurations have been connected to the cardiovascular network to reproduce Veno-Arterial (VA) and Veno-Venous (VV) ECMO assistance. The advantages and limitations of different ECMO cannulation strategies have been considered. We have used literature data to validate the effects of a combined ventilation and ECMO support strategy. RESULTS: The results have shown that our simulations reproduced the typical effects induced during mechanical ventilation and ECMO assistance. We focused our attention on ECMO with triple cannulation such as Veno-Ventricular-Arterial (VV-A) and Veno-Atrial-Arterial (VA-A) configurations to improve the hemodynamic and energetic conditions of a virtual patient. Simulations of VV-A and VA-A assistance with and without mechanical ventilation have generated specific effects on cardiac output, coupling of arterial and ventricular elastance for both ventricles, mean pulmonary pressure, external work and pressure volume area. CONCLUSION: The new modules of the systemic circulation and ECMO support allowed the study of the effects induced by concomitant mechanical ventilation and circulatory support. Based on our clinical experience during the COVID-19 pandemic, numerical simulations may help clinicians with data analysis and treatment optimisation of patients requiring both mechanical ventilation and circulatory support.","De Lazzari, Beatrice; Iacovoni, Attilio; Mottaghy, Khosrow; Capoccia, Massimo; Badagliacca, Roberto; Vizza, Carmine Dario; De Lazzari, Claudio",Comput Methods Programs Biomed,,114

METHODS: The Department of Medicine sought participation by ""independent"" and redeployed ""employed"" physicians to provide acute hospital care, as well as assistance with occupational health and family communication. Plans addressed training, compensation, clinical privileges, malpractice, and collaboration with the existing hospitalist service. RESULTS: Redeployed employed physicians (81% internists) selected either acute care (n = 68; median age, 52 y [range, 32-72 y]; 28% female) or non-face-to-face supportive roles (n = 69; median age, 52 y [range, 32-84 y]; 28% female). The redeployed physician group totaled 474 twelve-h daytime shifts typically caring for 10 patients per day. Six employed physicians refused redeployment, and only 3 independent physicians participated (all acute care). Of note, COVID-19 infection occurred in 10 hospitalists and intensivists, and in several redeployed physicians.

419058,Audio Interview: Finding Reliable Information about Covid-19,2020,"OBJECTIVES: Targeted corticosteroid injections (CSI) are one of the treatments that can provide pain relief and thereby, enhance quality of life in patients with chronic pain. Corticosteroids (CS) are known to impair immune response. The objective was to evaluate the risk of developing post-procedural infection within 4 weeks of receiving depot CSI for chronic pain as part of on going quality improvement project. We hypothesised that interventional treatment with depot steroids will not cause a significant increase in clinical infection in the first 4 weeks. METHODS: Telephone follow-up was performed as a part of prospective longitudinal audit in a cohort of patients who received interventional treatment for chronic pain at a multidisciplinary pain medicine centre based at a university teaching hospital. Patients who received interventional treatment in the management of chronic pain under a single physician between October 2019 and December 2020 were followed up over telephone as part of on going longitudinal audits. Data was collected on any infection within 4 and 12 weeks of receiving the intervention. Outcomes collected included type of intervention, dose of depot steroids and pain relief obtained at 12 weeks following intervention. RESULTS: Over a 15 month period, 261 patients received pain interventions with depot CS. There was no loss to follow-up. Nine patients reported an infection within 4 weeks of receiving depot steroids (9/261, 3.4%). None of the patients tested positive for Covid-19. Eight patients (8/261, 3%) reported an infection between 5 and 12 weeks following the corticosteroid intervention. Although none of the patients tested positive for Covid-19, two patients presented with clinical and radiological features suggestive of Covid-19. Durable analgesia was reported by 51% (133/261) and clinically significant analgesia by 30% (78/261) at 12 weeks following the intervention. Failure rate was 19% (50/261). CONCLUSIONS: Pain medicine interventions with depot steroids do not appear to overtly increase the risk for Covid-19 infection in the midst of a pandemic.","James, Arul; Niraj, Shruti; Mittal, Manish; Niraj, G",Scandinavian journal of pain (Online),,114

420485,Clinical and Psychological Issues in Children with Inflammatory Bowel Disease During COVID-19 Pandemic,2020,"Oil spills in Arctic marine environments are expected to increase concurrently with the expansion of shipping routes and petroleum exploitation into previously inaccessible ice-dominated regions. Most research on oil biodegradation focusses on the bulk oil, but the fate of the water-accommodated fraction (WAF), mainly composed of toxic aromatic compounds, is largely underexplored. To evaluate the bacterial degradation capacity of such dissolved aromatics in Greenlandic seawater, microcosms consisting of 0 °C seawater polluted with WAF were investigated over a 3-month period. With a half-life (t1/2) of 26 days, m-xylene was the fastest degraded compound, as measured by gas chromatography - mass spectrometry. Substantial slower degradation was observed for ethylbenzene, naphthalenes, phenanthrene, acenaphthylene, acenaphthene and fluorenes with t1/2 of 40-105 days. Colwellia, identified by 16S rRNA gene sequencing, was the main potential degrader of m-xylene. This genus occupied up to 47 % of the bacterial community until day 10 in the microcosms. Cycloclasticus and Zhongshania aliphaticivorans, potentially utilizing one-to three-ringed aromatics, replaced Colwellia between day 10 and 96 and occupied up to 6 % and 23 % of the community, respectively. Although most of the WAF can ultimately be eliminated in microcosms, our results suggest that the restoration of an oil-impacted Arctic environment may be slow as most analysed compounds had t1/2 of over 2-3 months and the detrimental effects of a spill towards the marine ecosystem likely persist during this time.","Gomes, Ana; Christensen, Jan H; Gründger, Friederike; Kjeldsen, Kasper Urup; Rysgaard, Søren; Vergeynst, Leendert",Chemosphere,,114

For CRSwNP treatment with T2-addressing biologics is possible. On October 24, 2019, the European Commission granted extended approval for dupilumab as the first biological agent for treatment of insufficiently controlled severe CRSwNP. The Federal Joint Committee (G­BA) evaluates the benefits of reimbursable drugs with new active ingredients. This includes assessment of the additional benefit and its therapeutic relevance. METHODS: A meta-analysis was performed using individual patient data based on two phase III studies. Both studies examined the safety and efficacy of dupilumab as an add-on therapy to INCS for treatment of CRSwNP in adults inadequately controlled with systemic corticosteroids and/or surgery compared to INCS alone. RESULTS: Based on the present data, the G­BA decided that there is an indication of a considerable additional benefit of dupilumab compared to mometasone furoate. CONCLUSION: For patients with severe CRSwNP inadequately controlled with INCS and systemic corticosteroids and/or surgery, there is an indication of a considerable additional benefit for the administration of dupilumab as an add-on therapy to INCS compared to mometasone furoate alone.","Klimek, L; Chaker, A; Deitmer, T; Plontke, S K; Wollenberg, B; Bousquet, J; Bachert, C",HNO,,114

The increasing use of social media as a source of health information may contribute to vaccine hesitancy due to anti-vaccination content widely available on social media, including Twitter. Being able to identify anti-vaccination tweets could provide useful information for formulating strategies to reduce anti-vaccination sentiments among different groups. This study aims to evaluate the performance of different natural language processing models to identify anti-vaccination tweets that were published during the COVID-19 pandemic. We compared the performance of the bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) and the bidirectional long short-term memory networks with pre-trained GLoVe embeddings (Bi-LSTM) with classic machine learning methods including support vector machine (SVM) and naive Bayes (NB). The results show that performance on the test set of the BERT model was: accuracy = 91.6%, precision = 93.4%, recall = 97.6%, F1 score = 95.5%, and AUC = 84.7%. Bi-LSTM model performance showed: accuracy = 89.8%, precision = 44.0%, recall = 47.2%, F1 score = 45.5%, and AUC = 85.8%. SVM with linear kernel performed at: accuracy = 92.3%, Precision = 19.5%, Recall = 78.6%, F1 score = 31.2%, and AUC = 85.6%. Complement NB demonstrated: accuracy = 88.8%, precision = 23.0%, recall = 32.8%, F1 score = 27.1%, and AUC = 62.7%. In conclusion, the BERT models outperformed the Bi-LSTM, SVM, and NB models in this task. Moreover, the BERT model achieved excellent performance and can be used to identify anti-vaccination tweets in future studies.","To, Q. G.; To, K. G.; Huynh, V. N.; Nguyen, N. T. Q.; Ngo, D. T.

426988,Audio Interview: A New Monoclonal Antibody for Covid-19,2020,"BACKGROUND: Classic epidemic curves - counts of daily events or cumulative events over time -emphasise temporal changes in the growth or size of epidemic outbreaks. Like any graph, these curves have limitations: they are impractical for comparisons of large and small outbreaks or of asynchronous outbreaks, and they do not display the relative growth rate of the epidemic. Our aim was to propose two additional graphical displays for the monitoring of epidemic outbreaks that overcome these limitations. METHODS: The first graph shows the growth of the epidemic as a function of its size; specifically, the logarithm of new cases on a given day, N(t), is plotted against the logarithm of cumulative cases C(t). Logarithm transformations facilitate comparisons of outbreaks of different sizes, and the lack of a time scale overcomes the need to establish a starting time for each outbreak. Notably, on this graph, exponential growth corresponds to a straight line with a slope equal to one. The second graph represents the logarithm of the relative rate of growth of the epidemic over time; specifically, log10(N(t)/C(t-1)) is plotted against time (t) since the 25th event. We applied these methods to daily death counts attributed to COVID-19 in selected countries, reported up to June 5, 2020. RESULTS: In most countries, the log(N) over log(C) plots showed initially a near-linear increase in COVID-19 deaths, followed by a sharp downturn. They enabled comparisons of small and large outbreaks (e.g., Switzerland vs UK), and identified outbreaks that were still growing at near-exponential rates (e.g., Brazil or India). The plots of log10(N(t)/C(t-1)) over time showed a near-linear decrease (on a log scale) of the relative growth rate of most COVID-19 epidemics, and identified countries in which this decrease failed to set in in the early weeks (e.g., USA) or abated late in the outbreak (e.g., Portugal or Russia). CONCLUSIONS: The plot of log(N) over log(C) displays simultaneously the growth and size of an epidemic, and allows easy identification of exponential growth. The plot of the logarithm of the relative growth rate over time highlights an essential parameter of epidemic outbreaks.","Perneger, Thomas; Kevorkian, Antoine; Grenet, Thierry; Gallée, Hubert; Gayet-Ageron, Angèle",BMC Med Res Methodol,,114

Hand and upper limb injuries presenting to the host organization during a pre-lockdown period (23rd March 2019-11th May 2019) and the formal UK lockdown period (23rd March 2020-11th May 2020) were compared, using data collated from the host institution's hand surgery database. The UK lockdown period was associated with a 52% fall in the number of patients presenting to the service with hand and upper limb injuries (589 pre-lockdown vs. 284 during lockdown). There was a significant increase in the proportion of injuries due to machinery use during lockdown (38, 6.5% pre-lockdown vs. 33, 11.6% during lockdown, P = 0.009), other etiologies were consistent. The proportion requiring surgical management were similar (n = 272, 46.2% pre-lockdown vs. n = 138, 48.6% during lockdown, P = 0.50). The proportion requiring overnight admission fell (n = 94, 16.0% pre-lockdown vs. 29, 10.2% during lockdown, P = 0.022). COVID-19 related lockdown in the UK resulted in a reduction in the presenting numbers of hand related injuries; however almost half of these patients still required surgery. These data may be of use to other hand surgery centers for resource planning during future lockdown periods, and for injury prevention strategies in the post-COVID-19 world.","Pidgeon, T E; Parthiban, S; Malone, P; Foster, M; Chester, D L",Hand Surg Rehabil,,114
427414,"Old drug, new Trick? The rationale for the treatment of COVID-19 with activated protein C",2021,"Intragravidic and perinatal infections, acting through either direct viral effect or immune-mediated responses, are recognized causes of liability for neurodevelopmental disorders in the progeny. The large amounts of epidemiological data and the wealth of information deriving from animal models of gestational infections have contributed to delineate, in the last years, possible underpinning mechanisms for this phenomenon, including defects in neuronal migration, impaired spine and synaptic development, and altered activation of microglia. Recently, dysfunctions of the neurovascular unit and anomalies of the brain vasculature have unexpectedly emerged as potential causes at the origin of behavioral abnormalities and psychiatric disorders consequent to prenatal and perinatal infections. This review aims to discuss the up-to-date literature evidence pointing to the neurovascular unit and brain vasculature damages as the etiological mechanisms in neurodevelopmental syndromes. We focus on the inflammatory events consequent to intragravidic viral infections as well as on the direct viral effects as the potential primary triggers. These authors hope that a timely review of the literature will help to envision promising research directions, also relevant for the present and future COVID-19 longitudinal studies.","Rasile, Marco; Lauranzano, Eliana; Mirabella, Filippo; Matteoli, Michela",FEBS j,,114

However, no studies were conducted to explore the existence of the micro-structural changes in the central nervous system after infection. We aimed to identify the existence of potential brain micro-structural changes related to SARS-CoV-2. Methods: In this prospective study, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and 3D high-resolution T1WI sequences were acquired in 60 recovered COVID-19 patients (56.67% male; age: 44.10 ± 16.00) and 39 age- and sex-matched non-COVID-19 controls (56.41% male; age: 45.88 ± 13.90). Registered fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), axial diffusivity (AD), and radial diffusivity (RD) were quantified for DTI, and an index score system was introduced. Regional volumes derived from Voxel-based Morphometry (VBM) and DTI metrics were compared using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). Two sample t-test and Spearman correlation were conducted to assess the relationships among imaging indices, index scores and clinical information. Findings: In this follow-up stage, neurological symptoms were presented in 55% COVID-19 patients. COVID-19 patients had statistically significantly higher bilateral gray matter volumes (GMV) in olfactory cortices, hippocampi, insulas, left Rolandic operculum, left Heschl's gyrus and right cingulate gyrus and a general decline of MD, AD, RD accompanied with an increase of FA in white matter, especially AD in the right CR, EC and SFF, and MD in SFF compared with non-COVID-19 volunteers (corrected p value <0.05). Global GMV, GMVs in left Rolandic operculum, right cingulate, bilateral hippocampi, left Heschl's gyrus, and Global MD of WM were found to correlate with memory loss (p value <0.05). GMVs in the right cingulate gyrus and left hippocampus were related to smell loss (p value <0.05). MD-GM score, global GMV, and GMV in right cingulate gyrus were correlated with LDH level (p value <0.05). Interpretation: Study findings revealed possible disruption to micro-structural and functional brain integrity in the recovery stages of COVID-19, suggesting the long-term consequences of SARS-CoV-2.

430155,Risks of potential drug-drug interactions in COVID-19 patients treated with corticosteroids: a single-center experience,2021,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has raised concerns over secondary infections because it has limited treatment options and empiric antimicrobial treatment poses serious risks of aggravating antimicrobial resistance (AMR). Studies have shown that COVID-19 patients are predisposed to develop secondary infections. This study was conducted to ascertain the prevalence and profiles of co- & secondary infections in patients at the COVID-19 facility in North India. METHODS: We studied the profile of pathogens isolated from 290 clinical samples. Bacterial and fungal pathogens were identified, and antimicrobial susceptibility was determined by the Vitek2® system. Additionally, respiratory samples were tested for any viral/atypical bacterial co-infections and the presence of AMR genes by FilmArray test. The clinical and outcome data of these patients were also recorded for demographic and outcome measures analyses. RESULTS: A total of 151 (13%) patients had secondary infections, and most got infected within the first 14 days of hospital admission. Patients aged >50 years developed severe symptoms (pâ¯=â¯0.0004) and/or had a fatal outcome (pâ¯=â¯0.0005). In-hospital mortality was 33%.K.pneumoniae (33.3%) was the predominant pathogen, followed by A. baumannii (27.1%). The overall resistance was up to 84%.Majority of the organisms were multidrug-resistant (MDR) harbouring MDR genes. CONCLUSION: A high rate of secondary infections with resistant pathogens in COVID-19 patients highlights the importance of antimicrobial stewardship programs focussing on supporting the optimal selection of empiric treatment and rapid-de-escalation, based on culture reports.","Khurana, Surbhi; Singh, Parul; Sharad, Neha; Kiro, Vandana V; Rastogi, Neha; Lathwal, Amit; Malhotra, Rajesh; Trikha, Anjan; Mathur, Purva",Indian J Med Microbiol,,114

Among other things, we illustrate the use of a probabilistic programming language that automates inference in existing simulators. Neither the full capabilities of this tool for automating inference nor its utility for planning is widely disseminated at the current time. Timely gains in understanding about how such simulation-based models and inference automation tools applied in support of policymaking could lead to less economically damaging policy prescriptions, particularly during the current COVID-19 pandemic.","Wood, Frank; Warrington, Andrew; Naderiparizi, Saeid; Weilbach, Christian; Masrani, Vaden; Harvey, William; Scibior, Adam; Beronov, Boyan; Grefenstette, John; Campbell, Duncan; Nasseri, Ali",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.13221v3.pdf,114

We administered an online survey among the population in the Portland-Vancouver-Hillsboro Metropolitan area on household and demographic characteristics, e-commerce preferences and factors, number of deliveries made before and during the COVID-19 lockdown, and number of deliveries expected to make post-pandemic. In this research, we conduct an exploratory analysis of the factors that affect home delivery levels before, during, and post-COVID-19. There was a significant increase in home deliveries during the COVID-19 lockdown relative to the before COVID-19 period. A high proportion of the households that made less than three deliveries per month before the pandemic stated they would order more online post-pandemic. A majority of the households that ordered more than three deliveries per month before COVID-19 are expected to revert to their original levels post-pandemic. The two variables most positively affecting the likelihood of online shopping were access to delivery subscriptions and income. Tech-savvy individuals are expected to make more home delivery orders post-pandemic compared to before and during COVID-19. Health concerns positively increase the likelihood of ordering online during the pandemic and post-pandemic. Older and retired individuals are less likely to use online deliveries. However, the likelihood of older and retired individuals ordering more home deliveries increased during the pandemic lockdown. Households with disabled members, single workers, and respondents concerned about online experience and health are more likely to be first-time online shoppers during the pandemic.","Unnikrishnan, Avinash Figliozzi Miguel",Transportation Research Interdisciplinary Perspectives,,114

Local and national health care systems, hospitals and health care workers have been overwhelmed by the needs of patients and limited by weaknesses in resources, staff capacity and distribution networks. These circumstances impact the ergonomic conditions within which health care staff work, and subsequently their behavioural responses. In this commentary we argue that urgent research is needed globally to bridge the evidence gap that exists on how best to support health care workers with the repercussions of working on the frontline of a pandemic. Leadership on the frontline is what matters. It is not only what policies, guidelines and checklists are in place to support nurses, doctors and health care workers; it is the actions and behaviours of their frontline and local leaders in implementing initiatives that really make the difference. Recognising that the leadership style, organisational culture, and the model of successful implementation are inextricable is the first step to ensure sustainable interventions to support health care workers' wellbeing will follow.","OBrien, Niki; Flott, Kelsey; Durkin, Mike",Int. j. qual. health care,,114

Herein, we have expanded on this study by investigating the role of three of the plants, Pithecellobium dulce (Fabaceae), Leonotis nepetifolia (Lamiaceae), and Opuntia ficus-indica (Cactaceae), on the survival, fecundity, and egg viability of the dengue vector Aedes aegypti. METHODS: We tested these effects using females that received (i) an initial three rations of blood meals and (ii) no blood meal at all. Two controls were included: age-matched females fed on glucose solution with or without an initial blood meal and those fed exclusively on blood meals. Data were collected daily over a 30-day period. The amino acid contents of Ae. aegypti guts and their respective diets were detected by coupled liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. RESULTS: Females fed on P. dulce and an exclusively blood meal diet had a shorter survival than those fed on glucose. On the other hand, females fed on L. nepetifolia survived longer than those fed exclusively on blood meals, whereas those fed on O. ficus-indica had the shortest survival time. With an initial blood meal, females fed on L. nepetifolia laid 1.6-fold more eggs while those fed on the other diets laid fewer eggs compared to those fed exclusively on blood meals. Hatching rates of the eggs laid varied with the diet. Mass spectroscopic analysis of gut contents of mosquitoes exposed to the different diets showed qualitative and quantitative differences in their amino acid levels. CONCLUSION: Our findings highlight the central role of plant nutrients in the reproductive fitness of dengue vectors, which may impact their disease transmission potential.","Nyasembe, Vincent Odhiambo; Tchouassi, David Poumo; Muturi, Martha Njeri; Pirk, Christian W W; Sole, Catherine L; Torto, Baldwyn",Parasit Vectors,,114

Research into how the causative SARS-CoV-2 virus together with its individual constituent genes and proteins interact with target host cells can facilitate the development of improved strategies to manage the acute and long-term complications of COVID-19. In this study, to better understand the biological roles of critical SARS-CoV-2 proteins, we determined and compared the host transcriptomic responses of the HL-CZ human pro-monocytic cell line upon transfection with key viral genes encoding the spike S1 subunit, S2 subunit, nucleocapsid protein (NP), NSP15 (endoribonuclease), and NSP16 (2'-O-ribose-methyltransferase). RNA sequencing followed by gene set enrichment analysis and other bioinformatics tools revealed that host genes associated with topologically incorrect protein, virus receptor activity, heat shock protein binding, endoplasmic reticulum stress, antigen processing and presentation were up-regulated in the presence of viral spike S1 expression. With spike S2 expression, pro-monocytic genes associated with the interferon-gamma-mediated signaling pathway, regulation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activity, adipocytokine signaling pathway, and insulin signaling pathway were down-regulated, whereas those associated with cytokine-mediated signaling were up-regulated. The expression of NSP15 induced the up-regulation of genes associated with neutrophil degranulation, neutrophil-mediated immunity, oxidative phosphorylation, prion disease, and pathways of neurodegeneration. The expression of NSP16 resulted in the down-regulation of genes associated with S-adenosylmethionine-dependent methyltransferase activity. The expression of NP down-regulated genes associated with positive regulation of neurogenesis, nervous system development, and heart development. Taken together, the complex transcriptomic alterations arising from these viral-host gene interactions offer useful insights into host genes and their pathways that potentially contribute to SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis.","Sharma, A.; Ong, J.

However, data on COVID-19-related encephalitis and movement disorders are still limited. Herein, we describe the clinical and neuroimaging (FDG-PET/CT, MRI and DaT-SPECT) findings of two patients with COVID-19-related encephalopathy who developed prominent parkinsonism. None of the patients had previous history of parkinsonian signs/symptoms, and none had prodromal features of Parkinson's disease (hyposmia or RBD). Both developed a rapidly progressive form of atypical parkinsonism along with distinctive features suggestive of encephalitis. A possible immune-mediated etiology was suggested in Patient 2 by the presence of CSF-restricted oligoclonal bands, but none of the patients responded favorably to immunotherapy. Interestingly, FDG-PET/CT findings were similar in both cases and reminiscent of those observed in post-encephalitic parkinsonism, with cortical hypo-metabolism associated with hyper-metabolism in the brainstem, mesial temporal lobes, and basal ganglia. Patient's FDG-PET/CT findings were validated by performing a Statistical Parametric Mapping analysis and comparing the results with a cohort of healthy controls (n = 48). Cerebrum cortical thickness map was obtained in Patient 1 from MRI examinations to evaluate the structural correlates of the metabolic alterations detected with FDG-PET/CT. Hypermetabolic areas correlated with brain regions showing increased cortical thickness, suggesting their involvement during the inflammatory process. Overall, these observations suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection may trigger an encephalitis with prominent parkinsonism and distinctive brain metabolic alterations.","Morassi, Mauro; Palmerini, Francesco; Nici, Stefania; Magni, Eugenio; Savelli, Giordano; Guerra, Ugo Paolo; Chieregato, Matteo; Morbelli, Silvia; Vogrig, Alberto",J. neurol,,114

We hypothesized that BDG from colonizing fungi in critically ill patients may translocate into the systemic circulation and be associated with host inflammation and outcomes.METHODSWe enrolled 453 mechanically ventilated patients with acute respiratory failure (ARF) without invasive fungal infection and measured BDG, innate immunity, and epithelial permeability biomarkers in serially collected plasma samples.RESULTSCompared with healthy controls, patients with ARF had significantly higher BDG levels (median [IQR], 26 pg/mL [15-49 pg/mL], P < 0.001), whereas patients with ARF with high BDG levels (&#8805;40 pg/mL, 31%) had higher odds for assignment to the prognostically adverse hyperinflammatory subphenotype (OR [CI], 2.88 [1.83-4.54], P < 0.001). Baseline BDG levels were predictive of fewer ventilator-free days and worse 30-day survival (adjusted P < 0.05). Integrative analyses of fungal colonization and epithelial barrier disruption suggested that BDG may translocate from either the lung or gut compartment. We validated the associations between plasma BDG and host inflammatory responses in 97 hospitalized patients with COVID-19.CONCLUSIONBDG measurements offered prognostic information in critically ill patients without fungal infections.

Methods: The study was conducted in three phases: A survey to investigate if the SmartOptometry App was easy to download, understand and test (phase I), an in-clinic comparison of VA measured in a random testing order with four tools namely COMPlog, Reduced Snellen near vision, Peek Acuity (Distance VA) and SmartOptometry (Near VA) (phase II) and a repeatability study on these 4 tools by measuring VA again (phase III). The study recruited the employees of our institute and adhered to the strict COVID-19 protocols of testing. Results: Phase I Survey (n = 40) showed 90% of participants used android phones, 60% reported that instructions were clear, and all users were able to self-assess their near VA with SmartOptometry App. Phase II (n = 68) revealed that Peek Acuity was comparable to COMPlog VA (P = 0.31), however SmartOptometry was statistically significantly different (within 2 log MAR lines) from Reduced Snellen near vision test, particularly for young (n = 44, P = 0.004) and emmetropic (n = 16, P = 0.04) participants. All the 4 tests were found to be repeatable in phase III (n = 10) with a coefficient of repeatability &#8804;0.14. Conclusion: Smartphone-based apps were easy to download and can be used for checking patient's distance and near visual acuity. An effect of age and refractive error should be considered when interpreting the results. Further studies with real-time patients are required to identify potential benefits and challenges to solve.","Satgunam, PremNandhini; Thakur, Monika; Sachdeva, Virender; Reddy, Sneha; Rani, Padmaja Kumari",Indian J Ophthalmol,,114
435932,Effectiveness of a On-Site Medicalization Program for Nursing Homes with COVID-19 Outbreaks,2020,"The long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play a critical regulatory role in the host response to the viral infection. However, little is understood about the transcriptome architecture, especially lncRNAs pattern during the SARS-CoV-2 infection. In the present study, using publicly available RNA sequencing data of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) samples from COVID-19 patients and healthy individuals, three interesting findings highlighted: (a) More than half of the interactions between lncRNAs-PCGs of BALF samples established by three trans-acting lncRNAs (HOTAIRM1, PVT1 and AL392172.1), which also exhibited the high affinity for binding to the SARS-CoV-2 genome, suggesting the major regulatory role of these lncRNAs during the SARS-CoV-2 infection. (b) lncRNAs of MALAT1 and NEAT1 are possibly contributed to the inflammation development in the SARS-CoV-2 infected cells. (c) In contrast to the 3' part of the SARS-CoV-2 genome, the 5' part can interact with many human lncRNAs. Therefore, the mRNA-based vaccines will not show any side effects because of the off-label interactions with the human lncRNAs. Overall, the putative functionalities of lncRNAs can be promising to design the non-coding RNA-based drugs and to inspect the efficiency of vaccines to overcome the current pandemic.","Moazzam-Jazi, Maryam; Lanjanian, Hossein; Maleknia, Samaneh; Hedayati, Mehdi; Daneshpour, Maryam S",J Cell Mol Med,,114
436037,Impact of cancer history on outcomesamong hospitalized COVID-19 patients: A case-controlanalysis,2020,"BACKGROUND: The use of Twitter data for health-related research has been increasing over time. While the organic nature of the data offer new opportunities, the limited understanding of how and by whom the data are generated poses a challenge for advancing health-related research. Individual-level data linkage could shed light into the data generation mechanism. OBJECTIVES: This paper investigates whether consent to link survey data with Twitter public data is associated with sociodemographic and Twitter use pattern factors and whether consenters and non-consenters differ on health-related outcomes. METHODS: Data from three health related surveys that use probability samples of the target population were used: 1) A college population web survey in KU Leuven University, 2) An adult population web survey of the US population, and 3) A population face-to-face survey in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). In all surveys, respondents reported whether they have a Twitter account, and Twitter users were asked to provide consent for linking their survey responses to their public Twitter data. RESULTS: Consent rate estimates from the two web surveys in Belgium and the US were 24% and 27% respectively. The face-to-face survey in KSA yielded a higher consent rate of 45%. In general, respondents' sociodemographic characteristics were not significantly associated with consent to link. However, more use of social media and reporting sensitive information in the survey were found to be significantly correlated with higher consent. Consenters and non-consenters were not found to be statistically different on any of the health related measures. CONCLUSIONS: Very few differences were found between those who consented to link their survey data with their Twitter public data and those who did not. Modifiable design variables need to be investigated to maximize consent while maintaining balance between consenters and non-consenters.","Mneimneh, Zeina N; McClain, Colleen; Bruffaerts, Ronny; Altwaijri, Yasmin A",Res. soc. adm. pharm,,114

Here we examined vaccine-specific CD4+ T cell, CD8+ T cell, binding antibody, and neutralizing antibody responses to the 25 g Moderna mRNA-1273 vaccine over 7 months post-immunization, including multiple age groups, with a particular interest in assessing whether pre-existing crossreactive T cell memory impacts vaccine-generated immunity. Low dose (25 g) mRNA-1273 elicited durable Spike binding antibodies comparable to that of convalescent COVID-19 cases. Vaccine-generated Spike memory CD4+ T cells 6 months post-boost were comparable in quantity and quality to COVID-19 cases, including the presence of TFH cells and IFN{gamma}-expressing cells. Spike CD8+ T cells were generated in 88% of subjects, with equivalent percentages of CD8+ T cell memory responders at 6 months post-boost compared to COVID-19 cases. Lastly, subjects with pre-existing crossreactive CD4+ T cell memory had increased CD4+ T cell and antibody responses to the vaccine, demonstrating a biological relevance of SARS-CoV-2 crossreactive CD4+ T cells.

437540,Regarding the evidence-based use of micronized progesterone,2020,"OBJECTIVES: In patient-facing healthcare workers delivering secondary care, what is the evidence behind UK Government personal protective equipment (PPE) guidance on surgical masks versus respirators for SARS-CoV-2 protection? DESIGN: Two independent reviewers performed a rapid review. Appraisal was performed using Critical Appraisal Skills Programme checklists and Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations methodology. Results were synthesised by comparison of findings and appraisals. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, Google Scholar, UK Government COVID-19 website and grey literature. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Studies published on any date containing primary data comparing surgical facemasks and respirators specific to SARS-CoV-2, and studies underpinning UK Government PPE guidance, were included. RESULTS: Of 30 identified, only 3 laboratory studies of 14 different respirators and 12 surgical facemasks were found. In all three, respirators were significantly more effective than facemasks when comparing protection factors, reduction factors, filter penetrations, total inspiratory leakages at differing particle sizes, mean inspiratory flows and breathing rates. Tests included live viruses and inert particles on dummies and humans. In the six clinical studies (6502 participants) included the only statistically significant result found continuous use of respirators more effective in clinical respiratory illness compared with targeted use or surgical facemasks. There was no consistent definition of 'exposure' to determine the efficacy of respiratory protective equipment (RPE). It is difficult to define 'safe'. CONCLUSIONS: There is a paucity of evidence on the comparison of facemasks and respirators specific to SARS-CoV-2, and poor-quality evidence in other contexts. The use of surrogates results in extrapolation of non-SARS-CoV-2 specific data to guide UK Government PPE guidance. The appropriateness of this is unknown given the uncertainty over the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.This means that the evidence base for UK Government PPE guidelines is not based on SARS-CoV-2 and requires generalisation from low-quality evidence of other pathogens/particles. There is a paucity of high-quality evidence regarding the efficacy of RPE specific to SARS-CoV-2. UK Government PPE guidelines are underpinned by the assumption of droplet transmission of SARS-CoV-2.These factors suggest that the triaging of filtering face piece class 3 respirators might increase the risk of COVID-19 faced by some.","Ramaraj, Prashanth; Super, Jonathan; Doyle, Ruben; Aylwin, Christopher; Hettiaratchy, Shehan",BMJ Open,,114

438406,COVID-19: what has been learned and to be learned about the novel coronavirus disease,2020,"Introduction: Over 40,000 cases of coronavirus (CoV) disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been confirmed in China. The causative agent, 2019 novel CoV (2019-nCoV), has spread rapidly to more than 25 countries worldwide. Human-to-human transmission has accounted for most of the infections outside Wuhan. Most studies to date on COVID-19 have focused on disease etiology and the genomics of 2019-nCoV, with few reports on the epidemiologic and clinical characteristics of infected patients. Methods: We report early clinical features of 26 patients with confirmed COVID-19 who were admitted to Liaocheng Infectious Disease Hospital in Shandong Province. Results: The median age of the 26 patients with COVID-19 in this study was 42 years. The most common occupation was retail staff (16 patients, 61.54%), with 11 patients or their family members working at the same supermarket. Only 2 patients had visited Wuhan since December 2019; the other cases of 2019-nCoV infection arose from patient-to-patient transmission. Twelve patients had more than one sign or symptom; however, seven patients had no sign or symptom. The average time from symptom onset to admission was 4.5 days. CT revealed signs of bronchitis in 2 patients and unilateral and bilateral pneumonia in 9 and 15 patients, respectively. The patients received the following treatments: antiviral therapy (100%), Chinese medicine (76.92%), antibiotics (50%), gastric mucosal protection (19.23%), immunotherapy (7.69%), and glucocorticoids (3.85%). Most patients (25/26) required ≥1 treatment. Discussion: In contrast to previous reports, most patients (24/26) had not been in close contact with individuals from Wuhan. Additionally, 11 patients or their family members worked at the same supermarket, suggesting active viral transmission in a location frequented by a large number of people. Close monitoring is essential for preventing the large-scale spread of the virus in such places.","Wang, Lizhen; Duan, Yueting; Zhang, Wenming; Liang, Juan; Xu, Jianxiang; Zhang, Yongqing; Wu, Changgang; Xu, Yangling; Li, Hua",Clin.

In this paper, we report the activity plan results and describe the baseline characteristics of the referred subjects. METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated data from 125 subjects referred to the critical care outreach team from March 22 to April 22, 2020. We considered subjects with a ceiling of care decision, with those deemed eligible assigned to level 3 care (ward subgroup), and those deemed ineligible admitted to the ICU (ICU subgroup). Quality indicators of the outreach team plan delivery included number of cardiac arrest calls, number of intubations in level 2 areas, and ineffective palliative support. RESULTS: We enrolled 125 consecutive adult subjects with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19. We did not report any emergency endotracheal intubations in the clinical ward. In the care ceiling subgroup, we had 2 (3.3%) emergency calls for cardiac arrest, whereas signs of ineffective palliative support were reported in 5 subjects (12.5%). Noninvasive forms of respiratory assistance were delivered to 40.0% of subjects in the ward subgroup (median 3 d [interquartile range (IQR) 2-5]), to 45.9% of subjects in the care ceiling subgroup (median 5 d [IQR 3-7]), and to 64.7% of subjects in the ICU subgroup (median 2.5 d [IQR 1-3]). Thirty of the 31 ward subjects (96.7%), 26 of the 34 ICU subjects, (76.4%), and 19 of the 61 ceiling of care subjects (31.1%) were discharged.

441012,The Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer perspective on regulation of interleukin-6 signaling in COVID-19-related systemic inflammatory response,2020,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To summarize current knowledge of the impact of coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) on patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). RECENT FINDINGS: Several observational studies, including case series, patient surveys, and patient registries, have examined the incidence and severity of COVID-19 in patients with SLE. Due to methodologic limitations (focus on sicker patients, exclusion of asymptomatic or mild cases, limited or inaccurate viral testing), it is difficult to determine the risk and outcomes of COVID-19 in SLE patients. Corticosteroids might be associated with increased hospitalizations from COVID-19 in individuals with autoimmune rheumatic diseases. Some immune suppressive treatments do not appear to significantly increase the risk of contracting COVID-19 or poor subsequent outcomes; however, data on the safety of specific drugs remain scarce. Studies in non-autoimmune cohorts have shown more severe COVID-19 in ethnic and racial minorities, populations also more heavily impacted by SLE. Such results have been attributed to highly prevalent socioeconomic disparities and comorbidities. The complex interplay between SARS-CoV-2 and the host immunologic milieu may have particular implications for patients with SLE that remain to be explored. Concerns have been raised of COVID-19 heightening the risk of thromboembolic events in the presence of an SLE-induced procoagulant state. Limitations in epidemiologic data available to date do not allow for assessing the risk and severity of COVID-19 in patients with SLE. Other than corticosteroids, prior use of some immune suppressive medications does not appear to increase the risk for infection with SARS-CoV-2 however, more comprehensive studies are needed.","Thanou, Aikaterini; Sawalha, Amr H",Curr Rheumatol Rep,,114
441013,The Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer perspective on regulation of interleukin-6 signaling in COVID-19-related systemic inflammatory response,2020,"Ventilation plays an important role in prevention and control of COVID-19 in enclosed indoor environment and specially in high-occupant-density indoor environments (e.g., underground space buildings, conference room, etc.). Thus, higher ventilation rates are recommended to minimize the infection transmission probability, but this may result in higher energy consumption and cost. This paper proposes a smart low-cost ventilation control strategy based on occupant-density-detection algorithm with consideration of both infection prevention and energy efficiency. The ventilation rate can be automatically adjusted between the demand-controlled mode and anti-infection mode with a self-developed low-cost hardware prototype. YOLO (You Only Look Once) algorithm was applied for occupancy detection based on video frames from surveillance cameras. Case studies show that, compared with a traditional ventilation mode (with 15% fixed fresh air ratio), the proposed ventilation control strategy can achieve 11.7% energy saving while lowering the infection probability to 2%. The developed ventilation control strategy provides a feasible and promising solution to prevent transmission of infection diseases (e.g., COVID-19) in public and private buildings, and also help to achieve a healthy yet sustainable indoor environment.","Wang, Junqi; Huang, Jingjing; Feng, Zhuangbo; Cao, Shi-Jie; Haghighat, Fariborz",Energy Build,,114

Ever increasing sources and formats are becoming available through a combination of traditional and new (digital) media, including social media. In such an information and media rich environment, understanding how people access and manage news during a global health epidemic like COVID-19 becomes even more important. The designation of the current situation as an infodemic has raised concerns about the quality, accuracy and impact of information. Instances of misinformation are commonplace due, in part, to the speed and pervasive nature of social media and messaging applications in particular. This paper reports on data collected using media diaries from 15 university students in the United Arab Emirates documenting their news consumption in April 2020. Faced with a potentially infinite amount of information and news, participants demonstrate how they are managing news overload (MNO) using a number of complementary strategies. Results show that while consumption patterns vary, all diaries indicate that users' ability to navigate the news landscape in a way that fulfils their needs is influenced by news sources; platform reliability and verification; sharing activity; and engagement with news.","Ahmed, Sameera Tahira",Information,,114
442894,Cancer care during the COVID-19pandemic in Southern India,2020,"Anthracene derivative compounds are currently investigated because of their unique physical properties (e.g. bright luminescence and emission tunability), which make them ideal candidates for advanced optoelectronic devices. Intermolecular interactions are the basis of the tunability of the optical and electronic properties of these compounds, whose prediction and exploitation benefit from knowledge of the crystal structure and the packing architecture. Polymorphism can occur due to the weak intermolecular interactions, requiring detailed structural analysis to clarify the origin of observed material property modifications. Here, two silylethyne-substituted anthracene compounds are characterized by single-crystal synchrotron X-ray diffraction, identifying a new polymorph in the process. Additionally, laser confocal microscopy and fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy confirm the results obtained by the X-ray diffraction characterization, i.e. shifting the substituents towards the external benzene rings of the anthracene unit favours &#960;-&#960; interactions, impacting on both the morphology and the microscopic optical properties of the crystals. The compounds with more isolated anthracene units feature shorter lifetime and emission spectra, more similar to those of isolated molecules. The crystallographic study, supported by the optical investigation, sheds light on the influence of non-covalent interactions on the crystal packing and luminescence properties of anthracene derivatives, providing a further step towards their efficient use as building blocks in active components of light sources and photonic networks.","Moliterni, Anna; Altamura, Davide; Lassandro, Rocco; Olieric, Vincent; Ferri, Gianmarco; Cardarelli, Francesco; Camposeo, Andrea; Pisignano, Dario; Anthony, John E; Giannini, Cinzia",Acta Crystallogr B Struct Sci Cryst Eng Mater,,114

The proposed methodology is based on how to conclude the season for Serie A, a top-division football league in Italy. The analysis showed that it is reasonable to play 14 instead of the 124 remaining matches of the 2019?2020 season to conclude the championship. The proposed methodology was tested on the past 10 seasons of the Serie A, and its effectiveness was confirmed.

To study the interpretability of discriminative features for COVID19 detection. Materials and Methods: Our database consists of 2096 CT exams that include CTs from 1150 COVID-19 patients. Training was performed on 1000 COVID-19, 131 ILD, 113 other pneumonias, 559 normal CTs, and testing on 100 COVID-19, 30 ILD, 30 other pneumonias, and 34 normal CTs. A metric-based approach for classification of COVID-19 used interpretable features, relying on logistic regression and random forests. A deep learning-based classifier differentiated COVID-19 based on 3D features extracted directly from CT intensities and from the probability distribution of airspace opacities. Results: Most discriminative features of COVID-19 are percentage of airspace opacity, ground glass opacities, consolidations, and peripheral and basal opacities, which coincide with the typical characterization of COVID-19 in the literature. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering compares the distribution of these features across COVID-19 and control cohorts. The metrics-based classifier achieved AUC, sensitivity, and specificity of respectively 0.85, 0.81, and 0.77. The DL-based classifier achieved AUC, sensitivity, and specificity of respectively 0.90, 0.86, and 0.81. Most of ambiguity comes from non-COVID-19 pneumonia with manifestations that overlap with COVID-19, as well as COVID-19 cases in early stages. Conclusion: A new method discriminates COVID-19 from other types of pneumonia, ILD, and normal, using quantitative patterns from chest CT.

The multi-reference coupled-cluster approaches are based on the effective Hamiltonian formulation providing a two-step procedure, in which dynamic correlation effects can be efficiently evaluated by the wave operator, while nondynamic correlation contributions are given by diagonalization of the effective Hamiltonian in the final step. There are two classical multi-reference coupled-cluster formulations. In this paper, the focus is on the so-called Fock-space coupled-cluster method in its basic version with one- and two-particle operators in the exponent. Computational schemes using this truncation of the cluster operator have been successfully applied in calculations in one- and two-valence sectors of the Fock space. In this paper, we show that the approach can be easily extended and effectively employed in the three-valence sector calculations.","Meissner, Leszek; Musial, Monika; Kucharski, Stanislaw A",J Chem Phys,,114

With the global epidemic dynamics becoming more and more serious, the prediction and analysis of the confirmed cases and deaths of COVID-19 has become an important task. We develop an artificial neural network (ANN) for modeling of the confirmed cases and deaths of COVID-19. The confirmed cases and deaths data are collected from January 20 to November 11, 2020 by the World Health Organization (WHO). By introducing root mean square error (RMSE), correlation coefficient (R), and mean absolute error (MAE), statistical indicators of the prediction model are verified and evaluated. The size of training and test confirmed cases and death base employed in the model is optimized. The best simulating performance with RMSE, R, and MAE is realized using the 7 past days' cases as input variables in the training and test dataset. And the estimated R are 0.9948 and 0.9683, respectively. Compared with different algorithms, experimental simulation shows that trainbr algorithm has better performance than other algorithms in reproducing the amount of the confirmed cases and deaths. This study shows that the ANN model is suitable for predicting the confirmed cases and deaths of COVID-19 in the future. Using the ANN model, we also predict the confirmed cases and deaths of COVID-19 from June 5, 2020 to November 11, 2020. During the predicting period, the R, RMSE, and MAE for new infected confirmed cases of COVID-19 are 0.9848, 17,554, and 12,229, respectively; the R, RMSE, and MAE for new confirmed deaths of COVID-19 are 0.8593, 631.8, and 463.7, respectively. The predicted confirmed cases and deaths of COVID-19 are very close to the actual confirmed cases and deaths. The results show that continuous and strict control measures should be taken to prevent the further spread of the epidemic.","Guo, Qingchun; He, Zhenfang",Environ Sci Pollut Res Int,,114

However, data on IPC compliance among healthcare workers in COVID-19 treatment centers are unknown in Ghana. This study aims to assess IPC compliance among healthcare workers in Ghana's COVID-19 treatment centers. The study was a secondary analysis of data, which was initially collected to determine the level of risk of COVID-19 virus infection among healthcare workers in Ghana. Quantitative data were conveniently collected using the WHO COVID-19 risk assessment tool. We analyzed the data using descriptive statistics and logistic regression analyses. We observed that IPC compliance during healthcare interactions was 88.4% for hand hygiene and 90.6% for Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) usage; IPC compliance while performing aerosol-generating procedures (AGPs), was 97.5% for hand hygiene and 97.5% for PPE usage. For hand hygiene during healthcare interactions, lower compliance was seen among nonclinical staff [OR (odds ratio): 0.43; 95% CI (Confidence interval): 0.21-0.89], and healthcare workers with secondary level qualification (OR: 0.24; 95% CI: 0.08-0.71). Midwives (OR: 0.29; 95% CI: 0.09-0.93) and Pharmacists (OR: 0.15; 95% CI: 0.02-0.92) compliance with hand hygiene was significantly lower than registered nurses. For PPE usage during healthcare interactions, lower compliance was seen among healthcare workers who were separated/divorced/widowed (OR: 0.08; 95% CI: 0.01-0.43), those with secondary level qualifications (OR 0.08; 95% CI 0.01-0.43), non-clinical staff (OR 0.16 95% CI 0.07-0.35), cleaners (OR: 0.16; 95% CI: 0.05-0.52), pharmacists (OR: 0.07; 95% CI: 0.01-0.49) and among healthcare workers who reported of insufficiency of PPEs (OR: 0.33; 95% CI: 0.14-0.77). Generally, healthcare workers' infection prevention and control compliance were high, but this compliance differs across the different groups of health professionals in the treatment centers.

Its questions are even more complex when these soldiers are projected into external operations where current conflicts, of a terrorist nature, expose the local populations, women and children specifically. Nevertheless, the SSA can also be projected to respond to exclusively health issues (excluding conflicts) as during the Ebola epidemic in Guinea in 2014, or more recently in Mulhouse with COVID-19.

To meet the global demand, lower cost and faster antigen tests for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) detection are a convenient alternative to the gold standard reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay. We tested laboratory-based RT-PCR RNA detection and two rapid antigen detection (RAD) tests, based on the immunochromatography test for nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19 Ag ECO Test, ECO Diagnóstica, and Panbio COVID-19 Ag Rapid Test Abbott). Paired collection and testing were done in a small prospective open study in three clinical services in São Paulo, constituted of mostly symptomatic volunteers at collection (97%, 109/112) for a median of 4 days (interquartile range: 3-6), ranging from 1 to 30. Among the 108 paired RT-PCR/RAD tests, results were concordant in 96.4% (101/108). The test's performance was comparable, with an overall sensitivity of 87% and a specificity of 96%. These observations add to other data that suggest that antigen tests may provide reasonable sensitivity and specificity and deserve a role to improve testing strategies, especially in resource-limited settings.","Matsuda, Elaine Monteiro; de Campos, Ivana Barros; de Oliveira, Isabela Penteriche; Colpas, Daniela Rodrigues; Carmo, Andreia Moreira Dos Santos; Brígido, Luís Fernando de Macedo",J Med Virol,,114

We hypothesize that CHADS2 and CHA2DS2-VASc scores may predict thromboembolic events and mortality in COVID-19. METHODS AND RESULTS: COVID-19 hospitalized patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection from 1 March to 20 April 2020 who completed at least 1-month follow-up or died were studied. CHADS2 and CHA2DS2-VASc scores were calculated. Given the worse prognosis of male patients in COVID-19, a modified CHA2DS2-VASc score (CHA2DS2-VASc-M) in which 1 point was given to male instead of female was also calculated. The associations of these scores with laboratory results, thromboembolic events, and death were analysed. A total of 3042 patients (mean age 62.3 ± 20.3 years, 54.9% male) were studied and 115 (3.8%) and 626 (20.6%) presented a definite thromboembolic event or died, respectively, during the study period [median follow 59 (50-66) days]. Higher score values were associated with more marked abnormalities of inflammatory and cardiac biomarkers. Mortality was significantly higher with increasing scores for CHADS2, CHA2DS2-VASc, and CHA2DS2-VASc-M (P < 0.001 for trend). The CHA2DS2-VASc-M showed the best predictive value for mortality [area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) 0.820, P < 0.001 for comparisons]. All scores had poor predictive value for thromboembolic events (AUC 0.497, 0.490, and 0.541, respectively). CONCLUSION: The CHADS2, CHA2DS2-VASc, and CHA2DS2-VASc-M scores are significantly associated with all-cause mortality but not with thromboembolism in COVID-19 patients.

Antiviral innate immune responses can be triggered by multiple cellular receptors sensing viral components. The activated innate immune system produces interferons (IFNs) and cytokines that perform antiviral functions to eliminate invading viruses. Coronaviruses are single-stranded, positive-sense RNA viruses that have a broad range of animal hosts. Coronaviruses have evolved multiple means to evade host antiviral immune responses. Successful immune evasion by coronaviruses may enable the viruses to adapt to multiple species of host organisms. Coronavirus transmission from zoonotic hosts to humans has caused serious illnesses, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19), resulting in global health and economic crises. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge of the mechanisms underlying host sensing of and innate immune responses against coronavirus invasion, as well as host immune evasion strategies of coronaviruses.","Kasuga, Yusuke; Zhu, Baohui; Jang, Kyoung-Jin; Yoo, Ji-Seung",Exp. mol. med,,114

However, data on the morbidity and mortality of COVID-19 among pregnant women, compared to nonpregnant women, are sparse and inconclusive. We sought to assess the impact of pregnancy on COVID-19 associated morbidity and mortality, with particular attention to the impact of pre-existing comorbidity. METHODS: We used retrospective data from January through June 2020 on female patients aged 18-44 years old utilizing the Cerner COVID-19 de-identified cohort. We used mixed-effects logistic and exponential regression models to evaluate the risk of hospitalization, maximum hospital length of stay (LOS), moderate ventilation, invasive ventilation, and death for pregnant women while adjusting for age, race/ethnicity, insurance, Elixhauser AHRQ weighted Comorbidity Index, diabetes history, medication, and accounting for clustering of results in similar zip-code regions. RESULTS: Out of 22,493 female patients with associated COVID-19, 7.2% (n = 1609) were pregnant. Crude results indicate that pregnant women, compared to non-pregnant women, had higher rates of hospitalization (60.5% vs. 17.0%, P < 0.001), higher mean maximum LOS (0.15 day vs. 0.08 day, P < 0.001) among those who stayed < 1 day, lower mean maximum LOS (2.55 days vs. 3.32 days, P < 0.001) among those who stayed &#8805;1 day, and higher moderate ventilation use (1.7% vs. 0.7%, P < 0.001) but showed no significant differences in rates of invasive ventilation or death. After adjusting for potentially confounding variables, pregnant women, compared to non-pregnant women, saw higher odds in hospitalization (aOR: 12.26; 95% CI (10.69, 14.06)), moderate ventilation (aOR: 2.35; 95% CI (1.48, 3.74)), higher maximum LOS among those who stayed < 1 day, and lower maximum LOS among those who stayed &#8805;1 day. No significant associations were found with invasive ventilation or death. For moderate ventilation, differences were seen among age and race/ethnicity groups. CONCLUSIONS: Among women with COVID-19 disease, pregnancy confers substantial additional risk of morbidity, but no difference in mortality. Knowing these variabilities in the risk is essential to inform decision-makers and guide clinical recommendations for the management of COVID-19 in pregnant women.","Qeadan, Fares; Mensah, Nana A; Tingey, Benjamin; Stanford, Joseph B",BMC Pregnancy Childbirth,,114

456308,"Editorial for ""Cardiac Involvement in Consecutive Elite Athletes Recovered From COVID-19 - A Magnetic Resonance Study""",2021,"OBJECTIVES: The aims of the study were to investigate the effects of social distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic on the use of hormonal contraceptives, their discontinuation and the risk of unplanned pregnancy. METHODS: The study enrolled 317 women listed in the database of the Department of General Surgery and Medical-Surgical Specialties, University of Catania, Italy, family planning clinic who were known to be using hormonal contraceptives. The women were contacted by telephone and asked whether they would like to participate in the study. If they agreed, they were then emailed a questionnaire about their social behaviour and sexual activity during the pandemic, according to their cohabiting status, i.e., whether they were continuing to use their hormonal contraception and whether they had had an unplanned pregnancy. RESULTS: The questionnaire was completed by 175 (81.8%) women who were using short-acting reversible contraception (SARC) and by 90 (87.4%) women who were using long-acting reversible contraception (LARC). All married and cohabiting women were continuing to use their contraceptive method. None had had an unplanned pregnancy. On the other hand, 51 (50.5%) non-cohabiting or single women had discontinued their SARC method while social distancing, for non-method-related reasons; however, 47 (46.5%) non-cohabiting or single women had continued their sexual activity, infringing social distancing rules, and 14.9% had had an unplanned pregnancy, for which they had sought a termination. CONCLUSION: Several non-cohabiting women using SARC had discontinued their contraceptive method during the pandemic but had continued to engage in sexual activity and had had an unplanned pregnancy. Clinicians should counsel women about what they should do in regard to contraception in the event of new, future social distancing measures.","Caruso, Salvatore; Rapisarda, Agnese Maria Chiara; Minona, Patrizia",Eur J Contracept Reprod Health Care,,114

METHODS: We conducted an observational study on non-valvular atrial fibrillation patients administered dabigatran at different dosing intervals at the Department of Geriatrics, Peking University First Hospital, China. We enrolled 121 consecutive non-valvular atrial fibrillation patients aged &#8805;60 years on dabigatran therapy (mean age, 79.6 ± 7.4 years); they were administered conventional low-dose dabigatran (110 mg twice daily) or extended-interval dosing with dabigatran (110 mg every 16 h or every 24 h). All patients received follow-up care, and we evaluated the presence of bleeding and thromboembolic events. RESULTS: All patients exhibited creatinine clearance greater than 30 mL/min with an average of 56.6 ± 17.3 mL/min. Sixty-two patients received extended-interval dosing with dabigatran at a mean dose of 117.1 ± 18.6 mg daily. Patients on extended-interval dosing were older; they exhibited lower creatinine clearance and bodyweight and higher CHA2DS2-VASc and HAS-BLED scores. The mean follow-up time was 25.8 ± 15.6 months. No significant differences were observed in the trough and peak values of the activated partial thromboplastin time and in thromboembolic or bleeding events between the 2 groups. CONCLUSION: Extended-interval dabigatran dosing in older patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation and lower creatinine clearance can maintain activated partial thromboplastin time trough and peak values comparable to the conventional low dose. Physician-prescribed practices regarding dabigatran dosing intervals do not lead to worse outcomes in the above-mentioned population.","Ni, Lianfang; Chen, Xiahuan; Liu, Meilin; Fan, Yan; Fu, Zhifang; Sun, Dan; Zhao, Zhijie",J Cardiovasc Pharmacol Ther,,114

Apart from the antiviral approach, the interventions to support healthy immune responses to the virus are feasible through diet, nutrition, and lifestyle approaches. This narrative review explores the recent studies on dietary, nutritional, and lifestyle interventions that influence the microbiota-mediated immunomodulatory effects against viral infections. Cumulative studies reported that the airway microbiota and SARS-CoV-2 leverage each other and determine the pathogen-microbiota-host responses. Cigarette smoking can disrupt microbiota abundance. The composition and diversification of intestinal microbiota influence the airway microbiota and the innate and adaptive immunity, which require supports from the balance of macro- and micronutrients from the diet. Colorful vegetables supplied fermentable prebiotics and anti-inflammatory, antioxidant phytonutrients. Fermented foods and beverages support intestinal microbiota. In sensitive individuals, the avoidance of the high immunoreactive food antigens contributes to antiviral immunity. This review suggests associations between airway and intestinal microbiota, antiviral host immunity, and the influences of dietary, nutritional, and lifestyle interventions to prevent the clinical course toward severe COVID-19.","Gasmi, Amin; Tippairote, Torsak; Mujawdiya, Pavan Kumar; Peana, Massimiliano; Menzel, Alain; Dadar, Maryam; Benahmed, Asma Gasmi; Bjørklund, Geir",Clin Immunol,,114

459105,COVID-19 in breast cancer patients: a cohort at the Institut Curie hospitals in the Paris area,2020,"BACKGROUND: Hospitals worldwide have postponed all non-essential surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic, but non-COVID-19 patients are still in urgent need of care. Uncertainty about a patient's COVID-19 status risks infecting healthcare workers and non-COVID-19 inpatients. We evaluated the use of quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) screening for COVID-19 on admission for all patients with fractures. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of patients older than 18 years admitted with low-energy fractures who were tested by RT-qPCR for SARS-CoV-2 at any time during hospitalization. Two periods based on the applied testing protocol were defined. During the first period, patients were only tested because of epidemiological criteria or clinical suspicion based on fever, respiratory symptoms, or radiological findings. In the second period, all patients admitted for fracture treatment were screened by RT-qPCR. RESULTS: We identified 15 patients in the first period and 42 in the second. In total, 9 (15.8%) patients without clinical or radiological findings tested positive at any moment. Five (33.3%) patients tested positive postoperatively in the first period and three (7.1%) in the second period (p=0.02).For clinically unsuspected patients, postoperative positive detection went from 3/15 (20%) during the first period to 2/42 (4.8%) in the second (p=0.11). Clinical symptoms demonstrated high specificity (92.1%) but poor sensitivity (52.6%) for infection detection. CONCLUSIONS: Symptom-based screening for COVID-19 has shown to be specific but not sensitive. Negative clinical symptoms do not rule out infection. Protocols and separated areas are necessary to treat infected patients. RT-qPCR testing on admission helps minimize the risk of nosocomial and occupational infection.

459251,Potential effect of natural and anabolizan steroids in elderly patient with COVID-19,2020,"Due to a lack of definitive treatment, many drugs were repurposed for Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) treatment; among them, corticosteroid is one. However, its benefit or harm while treating COVID-19 is not fully studied. Thus, we conducted this meta-analysis to assess the rationality on the use of corticosteroids in COVID-19. Pubmed, Medline, Clinicaltrials.gov, Cochrane library, and Preprint publisher were searched. In the qualitative syntheses, 41, and quantitative studies, 40, were included using PRISMA guidelines. Assessment of heterogeneity was done using the I-squared (I 2) test and random/fixed effect analysis was done to determine the odds/risk ratio. We found severely ill COVID-19 patients almost 5 (OR 4.78, 2.76-8.26) times higher odds of getting corticosteroids during their treatment. Similarly, the odds for corticosteroids in addition to standard of care (SOC) were approximately 4 (OR 4.09, 1.89-8.84) times higher among intensive care unit (ICU) patients than non-ICU ones. A higher mortality risk with the corticosteroid-receiving group compared with the SOC alone (RR 2.01, 1.12-3.63) was observed. Neither increased discharge rate (RR 0.79, 0.63-0.99) nor recovery/improvement rate was shown among the corticosteroid-receiving group (OR 0.24, 0.13-0.43). Approximately, the overall 4-day longer hospital stay was found among the treatment groups (MD 4.19, 2.57-5.81). For the negative conversion of reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), approximately a 3-day (MD 2.42, 1.31-3.53) delay was observed with corticosteroid treatment cases. Our study concludes that more severe and critically ill patients tend to get corticosteroids, and the mortality risk increases with the use of corticosteroids. With the use of corticosteroids, delayed recovery and a longer hospital stay were observed.","Budhathoki, Pravash; Shrestha, Dhan Bahadur; Rawal, Era; Khadka, Sitaram",SN Compr Clin Med,,114

A supplemental webinar series to the First International Pediatric Cardio-Oncology Meeting,2021,"To determine the value of 3T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) texture analysis in differentiating high- from low-grade soft-tissue sarcoma.Forty-two patients with soft-tissue sarcomas who underwent 3T MRI were analyzed. Qualitative and texture analysis were performed on T1-, T2- and fat-suppressed contrast-enhanced (CE) T1-weighted images. Various features of qualitative and texture analysis were compared between high- and low-grade sarcoma. Areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC) were calculated for texture features. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to analyze the value of qualitative and texture analysis.There were 11 low- and 31 high-grade sarcomas. Among qualitative features, signal intensity on T1-weighted images, tumor margin on T2-weighted images, tumor margin on fat-suppressed CE T1-weighted images and peritumoral enhancement were significantly different between high- and low-grade sarcomas. Among texture features, T2 mean, T1 SD, CE T1 skewness, CE T1 mean, CE T1 difference variance and CE T1 contrast were significantly different between high- and low-grade sarcomas. The AUCs of the above texture features were > 0.7: T2 mean, .710 (95% confidence interval [CI] .543-.876); CE T1 mean, .768 (.590-.947); T1 SD, .730 (.554-.906); CE T1 skewness, .751 (.586-.916); CE T1 difference variance, .721 (.536-.907); and CE T1 contrast, .727 (.530-.924). The multivariate logistic regression model of both qualitative and texture features had numerically higher AUC than those of only qualitative or texture features.Texture analysis at 3T MRI may provide additional diagnostic value to the qualitative MRI imaging features for the differentiation of high- and low-grade sarcomas.","Hong, Ji Hyun; Jee, Won-Hee; Jung, Chan-Kwon; Chung, Yang-Guk",Medicine (Baltimore),,114

We hereby describe the telemedicine procedures implemented in a large PrEP delivery service in Rio de janeiro in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. At the initial teleconsultation, individuals undergoe HIV rapid testing and are assessed by phone for PrEP related procedures. Individuals receive a digital prescription to retrieve a 120-day PrEP supply plus two HIV self-test kits. Subsequent follow-up teleconsultations will be performed remotely by phone call, including instructions for the HIV self-test performance, which results are to be sent using a digital picture. Participants will attend the service only for PrEP refill. The use of telemedicine procedures is being effective to avoid PrEP shortage and reduce the time PrEP users spend at the service during the COVID-19 pandemic and social distancing recommendations.","Hoagland, Brenda; Torres, Thiago S; Bezerra, Daniel R B; Geraldo, Kim; Pimenta, Cristina; Veloso, Valdilea G; Grinsztejn, Beatriz",Braz J Infect Dis,,114

Amid the outbreak of Coronavirus (COVID-19) in January 2020, strict policies were in place to restrict people's movement, bringing about steep reductions in pollution activities and notably lower ambient concentrations of primary pollutants. In this study, we report hourly measurements of fine particulate matter (i.e., PM2.5) and its comprehensive chemical speciation, including elemental and molecular source tracers, at an urban site in Shanghai spanning a period before the lockdown restriction (BR) (1 to 23 Jan. 2020) and during the restriction (DR) (24 Jan. to 9 Feb. 2020). The overall PM2.5 was reduced by 27% from 56.2 ± 40.9 (BR) to 41.1 ± 25.3 µg m-3 (DR) and the organic carbon (OC) in PM2.5 was similar, averaged at 5.45 ± 2.37 (BR) and 5.42 ± 1.75 µgC m-3 (DR). Reduction in nitrate was prominent, from 18.1 (BR) to 9.2 µg m-3 (DR), accounting for most of the PM2.5 decrease. Source analysis of PM2.5 using positive matrix factorization modeling of comprehensive chemical composition, resolved nine primary source factors and five secondary source factors. The quantitative source analysis confirms reduced contributions from primary sources affected by COVID-19, with vehicular emissions showing the largest drop, from 4.6 (BR) to 0.61 µg m-3 (DR) and the percentage change (-87%) in par with vehicle traffic volume and fuel sale statistics (-60% to -90%). In the same time period, secondary sources are revealed to vary in response to precursor reductions from the lockdown, with two sources showing consistent enhancement while the other three showing reductions, highlighting the complexity in secondary organic aerosol formation and the nonlinear response to broad primary precursor pollutants. The combined contribution from the two secondary sources to PM2.5 increased from 7.3 ± 6.6 (BR) to 14.8 ± 9.3 µg m-3 (DR), partially offsetting the reductions from primary sources and nitrate while their increased contribution to OC, from 1.6 ± 1.4 (BR) to 3.2 ± 2.0 µgC m-3 (DR), almost offset the decrease coming from the primary sources. Results from this work underscore challenges in predicting the benefits to PM2.5 improvement from emission reductions of common urban primary sources.","Zhu, Shuhui; Wang, Qiongqiong; Qiao, Liping; Zhou, Min; Wang, Shan; Lou, Shengrong; Huang, Dandan; Wang, Qian; Jing, Shengao; Wang, Hongli; Chen, Changhong; Huang, Cheng; Yu, Jian Zhen",Faraday discuss,,114

The present research aimed to develop and evaluate a new parent-report questionnaire that measures the time children spend playing across a range of places and includes a supplement to evaluate how adventurously children play. METHODS: The questionnaire was developed with input from a diverse group of parents and experts in children's play. It was designed to yield a range of metrics including time spent playing per year, time spent playing outside, time spent playing in nature and level of adventurous play. The reliability of the questionnaire was then evaluated with 245 parents (149 mothers, 96 fathers) of 154 children aged 5-11 years. All participants completed the measure at time 1. At time 2, an average of 20 days later, 184 parents (111 mothers and 73 fathers) of 99 children completed the measure again. RESULTS: Cross-informant agreement, evaluated using Concordance Correlation Coefficients (CCCs), ranged from 0.36 to 0.51. These fall in the poor to moderate range and are largely comparable to cross-informant agreement on other measures. Test-retest reliability for mothers was good (range 0.67-0.76) for time spent playing metrics. For fathers, test-retest reliability was lower (range 0.39-0.63). For both parents the average level of adventurous play variable had relatively poor test retest reliability (mothers = 0.49, fathers = 0.42). This variable also showed a significant increase from time 1 to time 2. This instability over time may be due to the timing of the research in relation to the Covid-19 lockdown and associated shifts in risk perception. CONCLUSIONS: The measure will be of value in future research focusing on the public health benefits and correlates of children's play as well as researchers interested in children's outdoor play and play in nature specifically. The development of the measure in collaboration with parents and experts in children's play is a significant strength. It will be of value for future research to further validate the measure against play diaries or activity monitors.","Dodd, Helen F; Nesbit, Rachel J; Maratchi, Laura R",BMC Public Health,,114
468091,Targeting Neurological Manifestations of Coronaviruses by Candidate Phytochemicals: A Mechanistic Approach,2021,"Purpose This study aims to examine the impact of Covid-19 on transforming accountability, corporate social responsibility (CSR) and office operation and control. This paper explains how unleashing the rationality of health and safety along with internal CSR made the transformation to telework successfully operable in a periphery of a western multinational corporation. Design/methodology/approach The study draws upon the theories of governmentality and social accountability. It adopts an interpretative qualitative research approach and uses the case study method. Data were collected from one of the biggest private sector telecommunication companies in Egypt. Findings This study finds that Covid-19 and its related health and safety discourse represented a good rationale for the western home office to accelerate the initiation of its office transformation plan to reach full working from home policy in a less developed country peripheral subsidiary. Under the guise of CSR, the company spent a large budget to make this transformation quickly operable, while its Egyptian subsidiary is financially distressed. Moreover, the company achieved its objectives from this new rationality as employees currently prefer the telework mode which reduces the company costs in the long run. Practical implications The study provides practitioners with evidence and practicable knowledge regarding the impact of Covid-19 on office reconfiguration and the ways used to achieve this in the Egyptian telecommunication sector. Originality/value The current study extends the governmentality literature by illustrating that transformation to telework in emerging markets is an operational manifestation of cost reduction and efficiency rationality under the guise of CSR. Moreover, it extends the office transformation literature by bringing early evidence regarding office transition plans during COVID-19 in an emerging market.","Metwally, A. B.

468134,Audio Interview: Delivering Covid-19 Vaccines to Minority Communities,2021,"INTRODUCTION: Health care workers (HCWs) are at a high risk of infection owing to occupational exposure to patients and virus-contaminated surfaces. OBJECTIVES: The study was aimed to reveal and compare the seroprevalence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection among patient-facing HCWs across 3 dental clinics equipped with different types of aspirating systems. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included 157 HCWs (43.58 ± 1.66 y) from 3 dental clinics in Ekaterinburg (Russian Federation) who reported to work during the coronavirus disease pandemic. All HCWs underwent serological testing once a week to detect immunoglobulin G and M antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2. The V6000 aspirating system with a vacuum controller (dry or semidry mode) and high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters was used at clinics A and B, and the aspirated aerosol and air were evacuated and dissipated into the atmosphere. The VS900 aspirating vacuum pump without HEPA filters was used at clinic C. The aspirated aerosol and air were evacuated and dissipated into the operatories. All dental clinics followed the same recommendations for dental patient management and types of personal protective equipment used. RESULTS: The estimated prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection was 11.5% (19 HCWs) over a 5-mo follow-up (May to August 2020). The prevalence of infection was unaffected by sex or the role of the member in the dental team (dentist/dental assistant). The prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection (+) was significantly higher at clinic C (equipped with an aspirating vacuum pump without HEPA filters) than at other clinics. CONCLUSION: The type of aspirating system used and the presence of HEPA filters could affect the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection across dental clinics. Therefore, we recommend the use of aspirating systems installed with HEPA filters, which evacuate and dissipate aerosols into specialized areas. KNOWLEDGE TRANSFER STATEMENT: This report confirms that dentists, being patient-facing HCWs, are at a high risk of acquiring the SARS-CoV-2 infection and identifies gaps in the protection of patients and staff in dental settings.","Sarapultseva, M; Hu, D; Sarapultsev, A",JDR Clin Trans Res,,114
468967,Clinical features and diagnosis of cardiac sarcoidosis,2021,"Confinement during COVID-19 has caused serious effects on agriculture all over the world. As one of the efficient solutions, mechanical harvest/auto-harvest that is based on object detection and robotic harvester becomes an urgent need. Within the auto-harvest system, robust few-shot object detection model is one of the bottlenecks, since the system is required to deal with new vegetable/fruit categories and the collection of large-scale annotated datasets for all the novel categories is expensive. There are many few-shot object detection models that were developed by the community. Yet whether they could be employed directly for real life agricultural applications is still questionable, as there is a context-gap between the commonly used training datasets and the images collected in real life agricultural scenarios. To this end, in this study, we present a novel cucumber dataset and propose two data augmentation strategies that help to bridge the context-gap. Experimental results show that 1) the state-of-the-art few-shot object detection model performs poorly on the novel `cucumber' category; and 2) the proposed augmentation strategies outperform the commonly used ones.","Riou, Kevin; Zhu, Jingwen; Ling, Suiyi; Piquet, Mathis; Truffault, Vincent; Callet, Patrick Le",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.02719v1.pdf,114

469090,Mutations in membrane-fusion subunit of spike glycoprotein play crucial role in the recent outbreak of COVID-19,2021,"Reliable detection and monitoring of estrus and pregnancy is essential to the effective ex situ conservation of endangered felids. Here, we review the current methods used to detect estrus and pregnancy in felids and describe the advantages and limitations of each. A total of 194 felid-focused publications were reviewed. The methods used included behavioral assessments (61 publications across 24 species), hormone monitoring (124 studies across 28 species), fecal protein monitoring (two studies in cheetah), ultrasonography (31 publications across seven species), vaginal cytology (22 publications across nine species), and laparoscopy (70 publications across 19 species). Behavior-based assessments of reproductive state are often inconsistent and unreliable in felids; thus hormone measurement is the most frequently used method for monitoring estrous cycles (66% of studies). In non-domestic felids, non-invasive fecal- or urine-based hormone metabolite analyses are preferred to blood assessments (66% of endocrine-based publications). While the measurement of fecal estrogen and progestin metabolites are useful for the retrospective assessment of ovarian activity, their use for real-time detection of estrus is limited. Vaginal cytology, laparoscopy and ultrasonography provide an acute and immediate determination of reproductive state but usually require anesthesia or sedation, which can prevent ovulation and cause abortions; thus, their use for pregnancy diagnosis is limited. Fecal progesterone or prostaglandin F2&#945; metabolites can be used to detect pregnancy in most felids (the exception being fecal progestins for Lynx spp.), but only during mid-to-late gestation. Urinary relaxin measurement is a promising method for earlier pregnancy diagnosis (30-40% duration of gestation) but is presently limited by poor assay sensitivity due to the lack of a feline-specific relaxin antibody. Elevated levels of fecal immunoglobulin J chain have been investigated as a tool to detect pregnancy in cheetah (>80% accuracy), but research is lacking on other species. We conclude that there is no single 'best method' for monitoring ovarian activity and detecting pregnancy in felids, and current best practice would involve a combination of existing methods. Non-invasive methods for detecting estrus and pregnancy in felids (e.g., accelerometry and infrared thermography) should also be considered to augment existing methods.","Andrews, Christopher J; Thomas, David G; Welch, Marcia V; Yapura, Jimena; Potter, Murray A",Theriogenology,,114

469330,"Audio Interview: The Impact of Covid-19 on Patients with Other Diseases, with Arnold Epstein",2020,"BACKGROUND: The rapid outbreak of COVID-19 around the world has adversely affected the mental health of the public. The prevalence of anxiety among the public has increased dramatically during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, there are few studies evaluating the effects of positive psychological responses and information-seeking behaviors on anxiety experienced among social media users during the COVID-19 pandemic. OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated the prevalence of anxiety and its associated factors among WeChat users in mainland China during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: From February 10 to February 24, 2020, a nationwide, web-based cross-sectional survey study was carried out using convenience sampling. Participants' levels of anxiety, positive psychological responses, and information-seeking behaviors were assessed. The survey was distributed among WeChat users via the WeChat smartphone platform. Chi-square tests and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to examine the factors associated with anxiety. RESULTS: This study found that the prevalence of anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item [GAD-7] scale score &#8805;7) among WeChat users in China was 17.96% (446/2483) during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. Results of multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that information-seeking behaviors such as cannot stop searching for information on COVID-19, being concerned about the COVID-19 pandemic, and spending more than 1 hour per day consuming information about the pandemic were found to be associated with increased levels of anxiety. Additionally, participants who chose social media and commercial media as the primary sources to obtain information about the COVID-19 pandemic were found more likely to report anxiety. Conversely, participants who were confident or rational about the COVID-19 pandemic were less likely to report anxiety. CONCLUSIONS: This study found that positive psychological responses and information-seeking behaviors were closely associated with anxiety among WeChat users during the COVID-19 pandemic in China. It might be paramount to enhance mental well-being by helping people respond to the COVID-19 pandemic more rationally and positively in order to decrease symptoms of anxiety.","Zou, Changqing; Zhang, Weiyu; Sznajder, Kristin; Yang, Fengzhi; Jia, Yajing; Ma, Ruqing; Cui, Can; Yang, Xiaoshi",J Med Internet Res,,114

469825,Association of HLA-DRB1*09:01 with severe COVID-19,2021,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Despite the plethora of publications discussing the severe respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), evidence of viral secretion in urine is sparse. RECENT FINDINGS: We could identify 34 publications including a total of 2172 patients. Among those, 549 patients were tested for SARS-CoV-2 secretion in urine, which was detected in only 38 patients (6.9%). Within the seven studies displaying positive results, the majority of positive patients (86.8%) was from not yet peer-reviewed studies including weak data and heterogeneous techniques for sample testing. Furthermore, none of the studies available in the literature addressed the virulence of detected viral RNA in urine. SUMMARY: Overall, only seven studies were able to detect SARS-CoV-2 secretion in urine, all of them with a considerably low rate of positivity. However, these studies were of rather low quality considering their methodology. Despite this, as SARS-CoV-2 has been detected in urine, it is of importance to discuss safety and urinary hygiene protocols. Until further research provides valid data on viral shedding and virulence in urine, potential risk of transmission through urine cannot be ruled out. Therefore, safety and hygiene measures need to be discussed.","Brönimann, Stephan; Rebhan, Katharina; Lemberger, Ursula; Misrai, Vincent; Shariat, Shahrokh F; Pradere, Benjamin",Curr Opin Urol,,114

469884,Challenges and Strategies in the Management of Coronary Artery Aneurysms,2020,"OBJECTIVES: We aimed to evaluate the accuracy of the Panbio&#8482; Ag-RDT at primary health care (PHC) centers and test sites in symptomatic patients and close contacts, using the Reverse-Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) test as the gold standard. METHODS: The study was conducted in four PHC centers and two test sites in Mallorca, Spain. Consecutive patients older than 18 years, attending the sites for RT-PCR testing were included. Two nasopharyngeal samples were collected, one for RT-PCR and the other was processed on-site using the Panbio&#8482; rapid antigen test kit for SARS-CoV-2. The sensitivity and specificity were calculated using RT-PCR as the reference, and the predictive values using the pretest probability results for each analyzed group. FINDINGS: A total of 1369 participants were included; mean age 42.5â¯±â¯14.9 years and 54.3% women. The overall prevalence was 10.2%. Most participants (70.6%) presented within 5 days of the onset of symptoms. The overall sensitivity was of 71.4% (95% CI: 63.1%, 78.7%), the specificity of 99.8% (95% CI: 99.4%, 99.9%), the positive predictive value of 98.0% (95% CI: 93.0%, 99.7%) and a negative predictive value of 96.8% (95% CI: 95.7%, 97.7%). The sensitivity was higher in symptomatic patients, in those arriving within 5 days since symptom onset and in those with high viral load. INTERPRETATION: Ag-RDT had relatively good performance characteristics in suspected symptomatic patients within five days since the onset of symptoms. However, our data do not support the sole use of Panbio&#8482; Ag-RDT in asymptomatic individuals.

470607,COVID-19 infection and oxidative stress: an under-explored approach for prevention and treatment?,2020,"BACKGROUND: Polyethylene glycols (PEGs) are polymers of varying molecular weight (MW) used widely as excipients in drugs and products, including the mRNA vaccines against COVID-19. Allergy to PEGs is very rare. Skin testing and graded challenge carries a high risk of inducing systemic reactions. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate skin prick test (SPT) and in-vitro reactivity over time to different MW PEGs and assess cross-sensitization patterns in PEG allergy. METHODS: Ten patients with previously diagnosed PEG allergy were skin prick tested twice with PEGs 26 months apart. Lower MW (PEG 300, 3000, 6000) were tested, followed by PEG 20,000 in stepwise, increasing concentrations. Cross-sensitization to polysorbate 80 and poloxamer 407 was assessed. SPT was performed in 16 healthy controls. In vitro Basophil Histamine Release (HR) test and passive sensitization HR test were performed in patients and controls. RESULTS: Patients previously testing positive on SPT to PEG 3000 and/or 6000 also tested positive to PEG 20,000. Patients with longer interval since diagnosis tested negative to lower MW PEGs and positive mainly to higher concentrations of PEG 20,000. Three patients developed systemic urticaria during SPT. Eight patients showed cross-sensitization to poloxamer 407 and three to polysorbate 80. All controls tested negative. In-vitro tests showed limited usefulness. CONCLUSION: Skin test reactivity to PEG can decrease over time, but titrated SPT with increasing concentrations of PEG 20,000 can be diagnostic when lower MW PEGs test negative. To avoid systemic reactions stepwise SPT is mandatory. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: An algorithm using a stepwise approach of skin prick testing to PEGs of increasing molecular weights and concentrations can be used to diagnose allergy to PEGs.","Bruusgaard-Mouritsen, Maria Anna; Jensen, Bettina Margrethe; Poulsen, Lars K; Johansen, Jeanne Duus; Garvey, Lene Heise",J. allergy clin. immunol,,114

Although several studies suggest that online education can be as effective as traditional education which requires attendance, few studies have focused on learner satisfaction with online instruction, particularly in the transition to online learning from traditional approaches. The results indicate that students react differently to online education, and their reaction is based on their proficiency in using online tools, their ability to technically access online courses, and the instructors’ manner in conducting learning activities.","Butnaru, Gina Ionela Niță Valentin Anichiti Alexandru Brînză Geanina",Sustainability,,114
471438,Real-world clinical outcomes in biological subgroups of breast cancer in the Hospital District of Southwest Finland,2021,"BACKGROUND: Since the outbreak of COVID-19 in December 2019, it has spread rapidly and widely, bringing great psychological pressure to the public. In order to prevent the epidemic, traffic lockdown was required in many areas of China, which led to inconvenience of treatment for dialysis patients. This study was conducted to explore the psychological distress and the psychological demand induced by CO-VID-19 in the patients undergoing dialysis and compare the difference between hemodialysis (HD) and peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients during the traffic lockdown period. METHODS: Questionnaires were given to the dialysis patients in the West China Hospital of Sichuan University. The Impact of Event Scale (IES) was used to investigate the patients' trauma-related distress in response to COVID-19. RESULTS: 232 eligible respondents were enrolled in this cross-section study, consisting of 156 PD patients and 76 HD patients. The median IES score for all the enrolled patients was 8.00 (2.00-19.00), which belonged to the subclinical dimension of post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS). HD patients had a significant higher IES score than PD patients (11.50 vs. 8.00) (p < 0.05). HD patients already got more psychological support from the medical staff. According to IES scores, 22.4% HD patients and 13.4% PD patients were classified as having moderate or severe PTSS, which need psychological support (p < 0.05). But more patients of both groups considered psychological support was necessary (HD: 50%, PD: 45.5%) (p > 0.05). In the multivariate regression analysis, we found that dialysis vintage, the impact of COVID-19 on the severity of illness and daily life, and confidence in overcoming the disease contributed to IES score (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: HD patients had more severe trauma-related stress symptoms than PD patients. When major public healthy events occurred, careful psychological estimate and sufficient psychological support should be provided to the dialysis patients, especially to the HD patients.","Xia, Xiaoxiao; Wu, Xiaofang; Zhou, Xueli; Zang, Zhiyun; Pu, Li; Li, Zi",Blood Purif,,114
471939,Longitudinal assessment of right atrial conduit fraction provides additional insight to predict adverse events in pediatric pulmonary hypertension,2021,"OBJECTIVES: The general objective of this study is to test the hypothesis that administration of convalescent plasma from donors with previous diagnosis of severe COVID-19 pneumonia is safe and associated with a decrease in all-cause in-hospital mortality among hospitalized patients with COVID-19 at 30 days in comparison with standard treatment alone. The secondary objectives are as follows: (1) to assess the efficacy of convalescent plasma to reduce the length of hospitalization, (2) to assess the efficacy of convalescent plasma to reduce the length of ICU stay, and (3) to assess the efficacy of convalescent plasma on reducing the requirement of invasive mechanical ventilation or ICU stay. TRIAL DESIGN: PERUCONPLASMA is a IIb phase open label, randomized, superiority clinical trial with 1:1 allocation taking place in real life routine clinical practice at public hospitals in Lima, Peru. Participants will be randomized to receive convalescent plasma along with local standard treatment or local standard treatment alone. After allocation, all participants will be followed for a total of 30 days or until hospital discharge, whichever occurs first. PARTICIPANTS: The population for the study are patients with severe disease with a confirmed laboratory test for SARS-CoV-2 infection hospitalized in 3 tertiary-care hospitals in Lima, Peru. Subjects are eligible for the trial if they meet all of the following inclusion criteria: 1. Age 18 or older 2. Hospitalization due to COVID-19 with laboratory confirmation (either with serologic, molecular, or antigen test along with a compatible clinical presentation) 3. Severe or critical COVID-19 disease Severe illness was defined by 2 or more of the following: Respiratory rate of 22 or more Hypoxemia with oxygen saturation equal or less than 93% Abnormal blood gas analysis (PaO2 < 60 mmHg, PaCO2 > 50 mmHg, or Pa/FiO2 < 300) Critical disease was defined by either: Mechanical ventilation requirement less than 72 h. Shock. 4. Capacity to provide informed consent (patient or patient's direct relative) 5. Availability of convalescent plasma units compatible with ABO blood type of the subject. EXCLUSION CRITERIA: Subjects are not eligible for the trial if they meet any of the following criteria: 1. Contraindication for transfusion (e.g., prior anaphylaxis, congestive heart failure) 2. Hemodynamic instability (PA < 60 mmHg refractory to vasopressors) 3. Uncontrolled concomitant infections\ 4. Stupor or coma 5. Platelets < 50,000/µL or disseminated intravascular coagulation 6. Serum creatinine > 3.5 mg/dL or dialysis requirement 7. Total bilirubin > 6 mg/dL or jaundice of unknown etiology 8. Myocardial infarction or acute coronary syndrome 9. Active or recent (< 7 days) intracranial hemorrhage 10. Pregnancy Donors: The donors have to meet the following criteria: male between 30 and 60 years with a previous diagnosis of severe COVID-19-associated pneumonia within the last 3 months, with resolution of symptoms of at least 28 days. The rationale for including donors with severe disease is to maximize the probability of collecting convalescent plasma units with high titer of neutralizing antibodies, as the technology to measure this specific type of antibodies is not routinely available in Peru. Aliquots of plasma will be stored for future quantification of neutralizing antibodies. INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: Convalescent plasma from donors with previous severe COVID-19 is the investigational medical product. The experimental group will receive 1 to 2 units of 200 to 250 ml of convalescent plasma along with local standard treatment. The control group will receive local standard treatment alone. The participants randomized to plasma will have evaluations at 6 h and 24 h to specifically evaluate possible post transfusion events. All the participants will be evaluated at day 3, day 7, and day 30 after enrolment. MAIN OUTCOMES: Safety outcome: Incidence of serious adverse reactions related to convalescent plasma transfusion within 24 h after convalescent plasma administration. Efficacy outcomes: Mortality from any cause during hospitalization at 30 days post randomization. Length of hospitalization at 30 days post randomization or until hospital discharge. Duration of mechanical ventilation at 30 days post randomization or until hospital discharge. Length of hospitalization in an intensive care unit at 30 days post randomization or until hospital discharge. Exploratory: Oxygen requirement evolution at days 3 and 7. Score Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) evolution at days 3 and 7. Dynamics of inflammatory marker (lymphocyte, C-reactive protein (CRP), D-dimer, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)) evolution at days 3 and 7. Proportion of patients progressing to multi-organ failure at 30 days post randomization or until hospital discharge. Proportion of transfusion related adverse reactions at 30 days post randomization or until hospital discharge. RANDOMIZATION: Randomization will be carried out within the electronic case report form (eCRF) in 1:1 ratio (receive plasma/control) in a randomization process established by blocks of size 2, 4, and 6. Allocation to the treatment arm of an individual patient will not be available to the investigators before completion of the whole randomization process. Randomization blocks will be performed with ""ralloc"", Stata's randomization process v.16.0. Randomization through the eCRF will be available 24 h every day. BLINDING (MASKING): Both the participants and study staff will be aware of the allocated intervention. Blinded statistical analysis will be performed. NUMBERS TO BE RANDOMIZED (SAMPLE SIZE): The sample size was calculated using the Fleiss formula with continuity correction to detect a mortality reduction from 50 to 20% between the two treatment arms with a confidence level of 95% and a power of 80%. Based on this information, a total of 45 patients per arm would be needed. After adjustment for a drop-out rate of 10% after enrolment, a total of 50 patients per arm (100 patients in total) will be enrolled.

FINDINGS: 91 patients were included between March and August 20 20. NPS and saliva viral loads were correlated (r = 0.315, p = 0.01). Symptomatic patients had significantly higher NPS and saliva viral loads than asymptomatic patients. Serial NPS and saliva viral load measurements showed that the log10 NPS (r = -0.532, p < 0.001) and saliva (r = -0.417, p < 0.001) viral loads for all patients were inversely correlated with the days from symptom onset with statistical significance. Patients with cough, sputum, and headache had significantly higher saliva, but not NPS, viral loads. Higher saliva, but not NPS, viral loads were associated with total lymphopenia, CD3 and CD4 lymphopenia (all p < 0.05), and were inversely correlated with total lymphocyte (r = -0.43), CD3 (r = -0.55), CD4 (r = -0.60), CD8 (r = -0.41), B (r = -0.482), and NK (r = -0.416) lymphocyte counts (all p < 0.05).

472824,Cardiometabolic Therapy and Mortality in Very Old Patients With Diabetes Hospitalized due to COVID-19,2021,"Adverse childhood experiences (ACES) have repeatedly been associated with depression. The ability to differentiate emotional intensity is a protective factor for psychopathology and in the context of life stressors, poor negative emotion differentiation (ED) is associated with depressive symptoms. However, little is known about whether the ability to recognize negative emotional intensity, a theorized developmental prerequisite of ED, influences the relationship between ACES and depressive symptoms in early childhood. The current study examined the interactive effects of ACES, the ability to recognize emotional intensity and depressive symptoms in 249 preschoolers enriched for depression. Findings demonstrated that when experiencing ACES, sad (not happy) emotion recognition was associated with elevated depressive symptoms. Specifically, when facing multiple ACEs, preschoolers with poor and moderate ability to recognize sad emotional intensity exhibited elevated depressive symptoms. Findings demonstrate that when experiencing elevated ACES, sad emotion recognition may be a protective factor for depression in early childhood.","Sudit, Ella; Luby, Joan; Gilbert, Kirsten",Child psychiatry hum. dev,,114

Chloroquine has shown to inhibit receptor binding of the viral particles, interferes with their replication and inhibits ""cytokine storm"". Though multiple modes of actions have been employed by chloroquine against multiple diseases, viral diseases can provide an added advantage to establish the anti-SARS-CoV-2 mechanism, the in vitro and in vivo trials against SARS-CoV-2 have yielded mixed results. The toxicological effects and dosage optimization of chloroquine have been studied for many diseases, though it needs a proper evaluation again as chloroquine is also associated with several toxicities. Moreover, the drug is inexpensive and is readily available in many countries. Though much of the hope has been created by chloroquine and its derivatives against multiple diseases, repurposing it against SARS-CoV-2 requires large scale, collaborative, randomized and unbiased clinical trials to avoid false promises. This review summarizes the use and the mechanism of chloroquine against multiple diseases, its side-effects, mechanisms and the different clinical trials ongoing against ""COVID-19"".","Kamat, S.; Kumari, M.",Frontiers in Pharmacology,,114

Using our recently developed difference-dedicated (DD) second-order vibrational perturbation theory (VPT2) method, we test this assumption for a variety of molecules. The vibration hole turns out to be well localized in many cases but not in the interesting case where the H/D substitution site is involved in an intra-molecular hydrogen bond. For a series of salicylaldehyde derivatives recently studied by Hansen and co-workers (Molecules 2019, 24, 4533), the vibrational hole was found to stretch over the whole hydrogen-bond moiety, including the bonds to the neighbouring C atoms, and to be sensitive to substituent effects.

Cirrhotic subjects consecutively referring to eight Italian centers were prospectively enrolled for a 6-month period in 2019. Subjects were asked if they had received a flu vaccine in the last 12 months. Multiple logistic regression analysis was performed to identify independent predictors of lack of vaccination. A total of 818 cases were recruited. The overall vaccine coverage was 39.6% (26.9% in those younger than 65 years and 51.9% in those older than 64 years; p < 0.001). Age < 65 years (odds ratio [OR] = 2.38; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.68-3.36), alcoholic etiology (OR = 2.40; 95% CI = 1.49-3.85), birth abroad (OR = 2.7; 95% CI = 1.10-6.61), and residence in South/Sardinia island (OR = 1.66; 95% CI = 1.14-2.42) all resulted independent predictors of the likelihood of lack of vaccination. The lack of information regarding the vaccine as the reason for no vaccination was reported by 71.4% of foreigners and by 34.7% of natives (p < 0.001). In conclusion, much work still should be done to improve coverage among groups at higher risk of lack of vaccination identified in this survey. The ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic may represent one more alert for improving seasonal flu vaccine coverage to avoid further stress to the National Health System.","Stroffolini, Tommaso; Lombardi, Anna; Ciancio, Alessia; Niro, Grazia A; Colloredo, Guido; Marignani, Massimo; Vinci, Maria; Morisco, Filomena; Babudieri, Sergio; Ferrigno, Luigina; Sagnelli, Evangelista",J Med Virol,,114

We quantified compliance of 108 asthmatic schoolchildren (53 from Cyprus, 55 from Greece, mean age 9.7 years) from both countries to intervention levels, using wearable sensors to continuously track personal location and physical activity. Changes in 'fraction time spent at home' and 'total steps/day' were assessed with a mixed-effects model adjusting for confounders. We observed significant mean increases in 'fraction time spent at home' in Cyprus and Greece, during each intervention level by 41.4% and 14.3% (level 1), 48.7% and 23.1% (level 2) and 45.2% and 32.0% (level 3), respectively.

Further we introduce a temporal layer in our modeling by incorporating the stringency level employed by each country over a period of 6 time intervals. Our results show that the indexes and level of stringency are not ideally suited for explaining variation in COVID-19 risk, however the ratio of elderly in the population is a stand out indicator in terms of its predictive power for mortality risk.

Having observed that previous infection by SARS-CoV-2 but not the standard ""2 doses"" scheme of vaccination, provided complete protection against COVID-19 to transplant recipients, we undertook this translational study to compare the cellular and humoral immune responses of these 2 groups of patients. Neutralizing anti-Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) IgG were identified as the critical immune effectors associated with protection. Generation of anti-RBD IgG was dependent upon spike-specific T follicular helper (Tfh) CD4+ T cells, which acted as limiting checkpoint. Tfh generation was impeded by high dose mycophenolate mofetil in non-responders to vaccine but not in infected patients, suggesting that increasing immunogenicity of vaccine could improve response rate to mRNA vaccine. This theory was validated in two independent prospective cohorts, in which administration of a 3rd dose of vaccine resulted in the generation of anti-RBD IgG in half of non-responders to 2 doses.

Using the example of a clinic for visceral, transplantation, thorax and vascular surgery (VTTG), the performance development of inpatient care in the first 7 weeks in comparison to the previous year as well as an evaluation of the compensation measures laid down by law were evaluated. METHODOLOGY: Based on the performance figures, a comparison was made between the period from 16 March to 3 May 2019 and the same period in 2020. Changes in the number of cases, case mix, case mix index and day mix index as well as the bed occupancy days were recorded. The monetary measures from the COVID-19 Hospital Relief Act were applied to these changes and the adequacy was evaluated. RESULTS: Compared to the previous year there was a decrease in inpatient admissions of 120 patients during the observation period. As a result there was a decrease of 370 points in case mix and 1433 days of occupancy. For the whole VTTG this resulted in a decrease in revenue of approximately 0.8â¯million , which was completely compensated by the flat rate payment for empty beds. The individual areas of the VTTG showed a heterogeneous picture in relation to the compensation for the loss of revenue. Elective units in particular showed a shortfall up to 128,163â¯ with respect to inpatient treatment for 7 weeks. CONCLUSION: The measures taken by the Government are an important support for the economic security of German hospitals. The lack of differentiation of measures by specialty leads to a heterogeneous picture in compensation for VTTG revenues and has to be understood as an alarm signal especially for elective surgical healthcare.","von Dercks, Nikolaus; Seehofer, Daniel; Steinert, Matthias; Krämer, Sebastian; Branzan, Daniela; Dietrich, Arne; Schürmann, Olaf; Gockel, Ines",Chirurg,,114

The concurrence of this new pandemic in regions where human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and tuberculosis (TB) infections possess the same epidemiological consideration, has arisen concerns about the prognosis, clinical management, symptomatology, and treatment of patients with triple infection. At the same time, healthcare services previously devoted to diagnosis and treatment of TB and HIV are being jeopardized by the urgent need of resources and attention for COVID-19 patients. The aim of this review was to collect any article considering the three conditions (HIV, TB, and SARS-CoV-2), included in PubMed/Medline and published in the English language since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. We focused on detailed descriptions of the unusual cases describing the three co-infections. Eighty-four out of 184 publications retrieved met our inclusion criteria, but only three of them reported cases (five in total) with the three concomitant infections. The clinical evolution, management, and therapy of all of them were not different from mild/severe cases with exclusive COVID-19; the outcome was not worse either, with recovery for the five patients. Cases of patients with COVID-19 besides HIV and TB infections are scarce in literature, but studies deliberately embracing the triple infection as a priori inclusion criterion should be carried out in order to provide a complete understanding of joint influence.","González-Domenech, Carmen María; Pérez-Hernández, Isabel; Gómez-Ayerbe, Cristina; Viciana Ramos, Isabel; Palacios-Muñoz, Rosario; Santos, Jesús",Viruses,,114

Dual-energy CT (DECT) can depict pulmonary perfusion by regional assessment of iodine uptake. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was the analysis of pulmonary perfusion using dual-energy CT in a cohort of 27 consecutive patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia. METHOD: We retrospectively analyzed pulmonary perfusion with DECT in 27 consecutive patients (mean age 57 years, range 21-73; 19 men and 8 women) with severe COVID-19 pneumonia. Iodine uptake (IU) in regions-of-interest placed into normally aerated lung, ground-glass opacifications (GGO) and consolidations was measured using a dedicated postprocessing software. Vessel enlargement (VE) within opacifications and presence of pulmonary embolism (PE) was assessed by subjective analysis. Linear mixed models were used for statistical analyses. RESULTS: Compared to normally aerated lung 106/151 (70.2%) opacifications without upstream PE demonstrated an increased IU, 9/151 (6.0%) an equal IU and 36/151 (23.8%) a decreased IU. The estimated mean iodine uptake (EMIU) in opacifications without upstream PE (GGO 1.77 mg/mL; 95%-CI: 1.52-2.02; p = 0.011, consolidations 1.82 mg/mL; 95%-CI: 1.56-2.08, p = 0.006) was significantly higher compared to normal lung (1.22 mg/mL; 95%-CI: 0.95-1.49). In case of upstream PE, EMIU of opacifications (combined GGO and consolidations) was significantly decreased compared to normal lung (0.52 mg/mL; 95%-CI: -0.07-1.12; p = 0.043). The presence of VE in opacifications correlated significantly with iodine uptake (p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: DECT revealed the opacifications in a subset of patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia to be perfused non-uniformly with some being hypo- and others being hyperperfused. Mean iodine uptake in opacifications (both ground-glass and consolidation) was higher compared to normally aerated lung except for areas with upstream pulmonary embolism. Vessel enlargement correlated with iodine uptake: In summary, in a cohort of 27 consecutive patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia, dual-energy CT demonstrated a wide range of iodine uptake in pulmonary ground-glass opacifications and consolidations as a surrogate marker for hypo- and hyperperfusion compared to normally aerated lung. Applying DECT to determine which pathophysiology is predominant might help to tailor therapy to the individual patient´s needs.","Poschenrieder, Florian; Meiler, Stefanie; Lubnow, Matthias; Zeman, Florian; Rennert, Janine; Scharf, Gregor; Schaible, Jan; Stroszczynski, Christian; Pfeifer, Michael; Hamer, Okka W",PLoS One,,114

To estimate the time-varying reproduction number, Rt of SARS-CoV-2 in Georgia and its 18 public health districts, we apply the R package ‘EpiEstim’ to the time series of historical daily incidence of confirmed cases, 2 March–15 December 2020. The epidemic curve is shifted backward by nine days to account for the incubation period and delay to testing. Linear regression is performed between log10-transformed per capita cumulative case count and log10-transformed population size. We observe Rt fluctuations as state and countywide policies are implemented. Policy changes are associated with increases or decreases at different time points. Rt increases, following the reopening of schools for in-person instruction in August. Evidence suggests that counties with lower population size had a higher per capita cumulative case count on June 15 (slope = −0.10, p = 0.04) and October 15 (slope = −0.05, p = 0.03), but not on August 15 (slope = −0.04, p = 0.09), nor December 15 (slope = −0.02, p = 0.41). We found extensive community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 across all 18 health districts in Georgia with median 7-day-sliding window Rt estimates between 1 and 1.4 after March 2020.","Ogwara, Chigozie A.; Mallhi, Arshpreet Kaur Hua Xinyi Muniz-Rodriguez Kamalich Schwind Jessica S.; Zhou, Xiaolu Jones Jeffery A.; Chopak-Foss, Joanne Chowell Gerardo Fung Isaac Chun-Hai",Epidemiologia,,114

486084,Collateral damage: Fear from SARS-CoV2-infection causing Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,2020,"The trend of deploying digital systems in numerous industries has induced a hike in recording digital information. The health sector has observed an extensive adoption of digital devices and systems that generate large volumes of personal medical records. Electronic health records contain valuable information for retrospective and prospective analysis that is often not entirely exploited because of the dense information storage. The crude purpose of condensing health records is to select the information that holds most characteristics of the original documents based on reported disease. These summaries may boost diagnosis and extend a doctor's time with the patient during a high workload situation like the COVID-19 pandemic. In this paper, we propose applying a multi-head attention-based mechanism to perform extractive summarization of meaningful phrases in clinical notes. This method finds major sentences for a summary by correlating tokens, segments, and positional embeddings. The model outputs attention scores that are statistically transformed to extract key phrases and can be used to projection on the heat-mapping tool for visual and human use.","Kanwal, Neel; Rizzo, Giuseppe",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.08942v2.pdf,114

Hansen's disease is known to present as a complex immunological response to the lepra bacilli, resulting in its varied spectral manifestations. An interaction between these two infectious agents, hence, may affect Hansen's disease. We came across six cases of Hansen's disease who developed COVID19 co-infection. This series presents their clinical course and outcome, during the period of co-infection. All cases were followed up for a minimum eight-week period thereafter. In all these cases the active phase of coronavirus infection had no effect on Hansen's disease and those on prednisolone for their lepra reaction had a more favorable outcome, with two cases manifesting exacerbation of their lepra reactions in the follow period.","Arora, Sandeep; Bhatnagar, Anuj; Singh, Gautam Kumar; Pal, Reetika; Bahuguna, Amit; Das, Pankaj; Verma, Prachi",Dermatol Ther,,114

The frequency of cardiac injury remains highly uncertain and confounded in current publications; myocarditis is one of several mechanisms that have been proposed. METHODS: We prospectively assessed patients with myocardial injury hospitalized for COVID-19 using transthoracic echocardiography, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, and endomyocardial biopsy. RESULTS: Eighteen patients with COVID-19 and myocardial injury were included in this study. Echocardiography revealed normal to mildly reduced left ventricular ejection fraction of 52.5% (46.5%-60.5%) but moderately to severely reduced left ventricular global longitudinal strain of -11.2% (-7.6% to -15.1%). Cardiac magnetic resonance showed any myocardial tissue injury defined by elevated T1, extracellular volume, or late gadolinium enhancement with a nonischemic pattern in 16 patients (83.3%). Seven patients (38.9%) demonstrated myocardial edema in addition to tissue injury fulfilling the Lake-Louise criteria for myocarditis. Combining cardiac magnetic resonance with speckle tracking echocardiography demonstrated functional or morphological cardiac changes in 100% of investigated patients. Endomyocardial biopsy was conducted in 5 patients and revealed enhanced macrophage numbers in all 5 patients in addition to lymphocytic myocarditis in 1 patient. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was not detected in any biopsy by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Finally, follow-up measurements of left ventricular global longitudinal strain revealed significant improvement after a median of 52.0 days (-11.2% [-9.2% to -14.7%] versus -15.6% [-12.5% to -19.6%] at follow-up; P=0.041). CONCLUSIONS: In this small cohort of COVID-19 patients with elevated troponin levels, myocardial injury was evidenced by reduced echocardiographic left ventricular strain, myocarditis patterns on cardiac magnetic resonance, and enhanced macrophage numbers but not predominantly lymphocytic myocarditis in endomyocardial biopsies.","Weckbach, Ludwig T; Curta, Adrian; Bieber, Stephanie; Kraechan, Angelina; Brado, Johannes; Hellmuth, Johannes C; Muenchhoff, Maximilian; Scherer, Clemens; Schroeder, Ines; Irlbeck, Michael; Maurus, Stefan; Ricke, Jens; Klingel, Karin; Kääb, Stefan; Orban, Mathias; Massberg, Steffen; Hausleiter, Jörg; Grabmaier, Ulrich",Circ Cardiovasc Imaging,,114

493217,How to incorporate a chemo-free interval into the management of metastatic colorectal cancer,2020,"BACKGROUND: Automated texting platforms have emerged as a tool to facilitate communication between patients and health care providers with variable effects on achieving target blood pressure (BP). Understanding differences in the way patients interact with these communication platforms can inform their use and design for hypertension management. OBJECTIVE: Our primary aim was to explore the unique phenotypes of patient interactions with an automated text messaging platform for BP monitoring. Our secondary aim was to estimate associations between interaction phenotypes and BP control. METHODS: This study was a secondary analysis of data from a randomized controlled trial for adults with poorly controlled hypertension. A total of 201 patients with established primary care were assigned to the automated texting platform; messages exchanged throughout the 4-month program were analyzed. We used the k-means clustering algorithm to characterize two different interaction phenotypes: program conformity and engagement style. First, we identified unique clusters signifying differences in program conformity based on the frequency over time of error alerts, which were generated to patients when they deviated from the requested text message format (eg, ###/## for BP). Second, we explored overall engagement styles, defined by error alerts and responsiveness to text prompts, unprompted messages, and word count averages. Finally, we applied the chi-square test to identify associations between each interaction phenotype and achieving the target BP. RESULTS: We observed 3 categories of program conformity based on their frequency of error alerts: those who immediately and consistently submitted texts without system errors (perfect users, 51/201), those who did so after an initial learning period (adaptive users, 66/201), and those who consistently submitted messages generating errors to the platform (nonadaptive users, 38/201). Next, we observed 3 categories of engagement style: the enthusiast, who tended to submit unprompted messages with high word counts (17/155); the student, who inconsistently engaged (35/155); and the minimalist, who engaged only when prompted (103/155). Of all 6 phenotypes, we observed a statistically significant association between patients demonstrating the minimalist communication style (high adherence, few unprompted messages, limited information sharing) and achieving target BP (P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: We identified unique interaction phenotypes among patients engaging with an automated text message platform for remote BP monitoring. Only the minimalist communication style was associated with achieving target BP. Identifying and understanding interaction phenotypes may be useful for tailoring future automated texting interactions and designing future interventions to achieve better BP control.","Davoudi, Anahita; Lee, Natalie S; Chivers, Corey; Delaney, Timothy; Asch, Elizabeth L; Reitz, Catherine; Mehta, Shivan J; Chaiyachati, Krisda H; Mowery, Danielle L",J Med Internet Res,,114

The focus of health care activity has shifted to the pandemic, with a negative impact on the management of other conditions. Neurosurgery, like most specialties, has been drastically affected but, arguably, warrants special considerations because many of the treatments required are time-critical. Lack or delay of appropriate intervention may lead, for an individual patient, to permanent neurologic injury and a significant decline in function and quality of life, or even death. In this report, we consider the challenges that neurosurgeons currently face in relation to the pandemic and are likely to face in the foreseeable future. The challenges are multifaceted with practical, ethical, legal, and other implications. These include re-deployment of staff to areas outside neurosurgery, treatment priority setting, ethical decision-making and risk of moral injury, as well as medicolegal risks, financial uncertainties and implications for training, research, and global health work. As well as patients, these challenges will affect neurosurgeons as doctors and as humans.

497559,"Response to Comment on ""ApoE e4e4 genotype and mortality with COVID-19 in UK Biobank"" by Kuo et al",2020,"Since COVID-19 has emerged as a word public health problem, attention has been focused on how immune suppressive drugs used for the treatment of autoimmune disorders influence the risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection and the development of the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Here we discuss the disease-modifying agents approved for the treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS) within this context. Interferon (IFN)-ï¢1a and -1b, which display antiviral activity, could be protective in the early stage of COVID-19 infection, although SARS-CoV-2 may have developed resistance to IFNs. However, in the hyper inflammation stage, IFNs may become detrimental by facilitating macrophage invasion in the lung and other organs. Glatiramer acetate and its analogues should not interfere with the development of COVID-19 and may be considered safe. Teriflunomide, a first-line oral drug used in the treatment of relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) may display antiviral activity by depleting cellular nucleotides necessary for viral replication. The other first-line drug, dimethyl fumarate, may afford protection against SARS-CoV-2 by activating the Nrf-2 pathway and reinforcing the cellular defences against oxidative stress. Concern has been raised on the use of second-line treatments for MS during COVID-19 pandemic. However, this concern is not always justified. For example, fingolimod, might be highly beneficial during the hyperinflammatory stage of COVID-19 for a number of mechanisms including the reinforcement of the endothelial barrier. Caution is suggested for the use of natalizumab, cladribine, alemtuzumab, and ocrelizumab, although MS disease recurrence after discontinuation of these drugs may overcome a potential risk for COVID-19 infection.","Alborghetti, Marika; Bellucci, Gianmarco; Gentile, Antonietta; Calderoni, Chiara; Nicoletti, Ferdinando; Capra, Ruggero; Salvetti, Marco; Centonze, Diego",Curr. neuropharmacol,,114

METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study of 117 confirmed patients with COVID-19 which conducted at a tertiary hospital in Daegu, South Korea. The primary outcome was defined as the severe and critical outcome (SCO), of which the composite outcomes of acute respiratory distress syndrome, septic shock, intensive care unit care, and 28-day mortality. We analyzed what clinical features and glycemic control-related factors affect the prognosis of COVID-19 in the DM group. RESULTS: After exclusion, 110 participants were finally included. DM patients (n=29) was older, and showed higher blood pressure compared to non-DM patients. DM group showed higher levels of inflammation-related biomarkers and severity score, and highly progressed to SCO. After adjustment with other risk factors, DM increased the risk of SCO (odds ratio [OR], 10.771; P<0.001). Among the DM patients, SCO was more prevalent in elderly patients of &#8805;70 years old and age was an independent risk factor for SCO in patients with DM (OR, 1.175; P=0.014), while glycemic control was not. The use of medication did not affect the SCO, but the renin-angiotensin system inhibitors showed protective effects against acute cardiac injury (OR, 0.048; P=0.045). CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 patients with DM had higher severity and resulted in SCO. Intensive and aggressive monitoring of COVID-19 clinical outcomes in DM group, especially in elderly patients is warranted.","Chung, Seung Min; Lee, Yin Young; Ha, Eunyeong; Yoon, Ji Sung; Won, Kyu Chang; Lee, Hyoung Woo; Hur, Jian; Hong, Kyung Soo; Jang, Jong Geol; Jin, Hyun Jung; Choi, Eun Young; Shin, Kyeong Cheol; Chung, Jin Hong; Lee, Kwan Ho; Ahn, June Hong; Moon, Jun Sung",Diabetes Metab J,,114

498988,A Rational Approach to Managing Prostate Cancer in an Irrational Time,2020,"BACKGROUND: Despite numerous interventions and treatment options, the outcomes of traumatic brain injury (TBI) have improved little over the last three decades, which raises concern about the value of care in this patient population. We aimed to synthesize the evidence on 14 potentially low-value clinical practices in TBI care. METHODS: Using umbrella review methodology, we identified systematic reviews evaluating the effectiveness of 14 potentially low-value practices in adults with acute TBI. We present data on methodological quality (AMSTAR-2), reported effect sizes and credibility of evidence (I to IV). RESULTS: The only clinical practice with evidence of benefit was therapeutic hypothermia (credibility of evidence II to IV). However, the most recent meta-analysis on hypothermia based on high-quality trials suggested harm (credibility of evidence IV). Meta-analyses on platelet transfusion for patients on antiplatelet therapy were all consistent with harm but were statistically non-significant. For the following practices, effect estimates were consistently close to the null: CT in adults with mild TBI who are low-risk on a validated clinical decision rule; repeat CT in adults with mild TBI on anticoagulant therapy with no clinical deterioration; antibiotic prophylaxis for external ventricular drain placement; and decompressive craniectomy for refractory intracranial hypertension. CONCLUSIONS: We identified five clinical practices with evidence of lack of benefit or harm. However, evidence could not be considered to be strong for any clinical practice as effect measures were imprecise and heterogeneous, systematic reviews were often of low quality and most included studies had a high risk of bias.","Moore, Lynne; Tardif, Pier-Alexandre; Lauzier, François; Bérubé, Mélanie; Archambault, Patrick; Lamontagne, Francois; Chassé, Michael; Stelfox, Henry T; Gabbe, Belinda; Lecky, Fiona; Kortbeek, John; Lessard-Bonaventure, Paule; Truchon, Catherine; Turgeon, Alexis F",J. neurotrama,,114

However, a sufficiently big training data set is usually difficult to obtain due to high annotation costs. In the case of banded chromosome images, the creation of big enough libraries is difficult for multiple pathologies due to the rarity of certain genetic disorders. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have proven to be effective in generating synthetic images and extending training data sets. In our work, we implement a conditional adversarial network that allows generation of realistic single chromosome images following user-defined banding patterns. To this end, an image-to-image translation approach based on self-generated 2D chromosome segmentation label maps is used. Our validation shows promising results when synthesizing chromosomes with seen as well as unseen banding patterns. We believe that this approach can be exploited for data augmentation of chromosome data sets with structural abnormalities. Therefore, the proposed method could help to tackle medical image analysis problems such as data simulation, segmentation, detection, or classification in the field of cytogenetics.","Uzolas, Lukas; Rico, Javier; Coup'e, Pierrick; Cserey, Juan C.

The goal of these analyses was to examine the prevalence and impact of comorbid chronic pain and cigarette smoking among PLWH. Participants included 3289 PLWH (83% male) who were recruited from five HIV clinics. As expected, the prevalence of smoking was higher among PLWH with chronic pain (41.9%), than PLWH without chronic pain (26.6%, p < .0001), and the prevalence of chronic pain was higher among current smokers (32.9%), than among former (23.6%) or never (17%) smokers (ps < .0001). PLWH who endorsed comorbid chronic pain and smoking (vs. nonsmokers without chronic pain) were more likely to report cocaine/crack and cannabis use, be prescribed long-term opioid therapy, and have virologic failure, even after controlling for relevant sociodemographic and substance-related variables (ps < .05). These results contribute to a growing empirical literature indicating that chronic pain and cigarette smoking frequently co-occur, and extend this work to a large sample of PLWH. Indeed, PLWH may benefit from interventions that are tailored to address bidirectional pain-smoking effects in the context of HIV.","LaRowe, Lisa R; Cleveland, John D; Long, Dustin M; Nahvi, Shadi; Cachay, Edward R; Christopoulos, Katerina A; Crane, Heidi M; Cropsey, Karen; Napravnik, Sonia; O039,; Cleirigh, Conall; Merlin, Jessica S; Ditre, Joseph W",AIDS Care,,114

502155,Short report on implications of Covid-19 and emerging zoonotic infectious diseases for pastoralists and Africa,2020,"A pandemic outbreak of a viral respiratory infection (COVID-19) caused by a coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) prompted a multitude of research focused on various aspects of this disease. One of the interesting aspects of the clinical manifestation of the infection is an accompanying ocular surface viral infection, viral conjunctivitis. Although occasional reports of viral conjunctivitis caused by this and the related SARS-CoV virus (causing the SARS outbreak in the early 2000s) are available, the prevalence of this complication among infected people appears low (~1%). This is surprising, considering the recent discovery of the presence of viral receptors (ACE2 and TMPRSS2) in ocular surface tissue. The discrepancy between the theoretically expected high rate of concurrence of viral ocular surface inflammation and the observed relatively low occurrence can be explained by several factors. In this work, we discuss the significance of natural protective factors related to anatomical and physiological properties of the eyes and preventing the deposition of large number of virus-loaded particles on the ocular surface. Specifically, we advance the hypothesis that the standing potential of the eye plays an important role in repelling aerosol particles (microdroplets) from the surface of the eye and discuss factors associated with this hypothesis, possible ways to test it and its implications in terms of prevention of ocular infections.","Zimmerman, Keith; Kearns, Fiona; Tzekov, Radouil",Med Hypotheses,,114

In this sense, identifying specificities of each location is essential to minimize the damage caused by the disease. Therefore, the aim of this research was to assess the vulnerability of 853 municipalities in the second most populous state in Brazil, Minas Gerais (MG), in order to direct public policies. An epidemiological study was carried out based on Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) using indicators with some relation to the process of illness and death caused by COVID-19. The indicators were selected by a literature search and categorized into: demographic, social, economic, health infrastructure, population at risk and epidemiological. The variables were collected in Brazilian government databases at the municipal level and evaluated according to MCDA, through the Program to Support Decision Making based on Indicators (PRADIN). Based on this approach, the study performed simulations by category of indicators and a general simulation that allowed to divide the municipalities into groups of 1-5, with 1 being the least vulnerable and 5 being the most vulnerable. The groupings of municipalities were exposed in their respective mesoregions of MG in a thematic map, using the software Tabwin 32. The results revealed that the mesoregion of Norte de Minas stands out with more than 40% of its municipalities belonging to group 5, according to economic, social and health infrastructure indicators. Similarly, the Jequitinhonha mesoregion exhibited almost 60% of the municipalities in this group for economic and health infrastructure indicators. For demographic and epidemiological criteria, the Metropolitana de Belo Horizonte was the most vulnerable mesoregion, with 42.9 and 26.7% of the municipalities in group 5, respectively. Considering the presence of a population at risk, Zona da Mata reported 42.3% of the municipalities in the most vulnerable group. In the joint analysis of data, the Jequitinhonha, Vale do Mucuri and Vale do Rio Doce mesoregions were the most vulnerable in the state of MG. Thus, through the outlined profile, the present study proved how socioeconomic diversity affects the vulnerability of the municipalities to face COVID-19 outbreak, highlighting the need for interventions directed to each reality.","Campos, I.

The distribution of pathogens in the sputum specimens was applied for retrospective analysis. Meanwhile, 110 patients diagnosed with COVID-19, but without pulmonary infection were regarded as the asymptomatic group. The risk factors of pulmonary infection were analyzed with generalized linear models and logistic regression. The pathogens in the lung infection group were mainly gram-negative bacteria (22, 68.8%), especially Klebsiella pneumoniae. Gram-positive bacteria and fungi accounted for 13 (40.6%), mainly Staphylococcus aureus, and 11 (34.4%), mainly Candida albicans. There were 14 cases (43.8%) infected with two or more pathogens. The comparison between the two groups found that, patients with elder age, underlying diseases, more lung lesions and low protein contents, were more likely to develop lung infections. At last, univariate analysis showed that 6 factors, including indwelling gastric catheter, the number of deep vein catheters, tracheal intubation tracheotomy, invasive mechanical ventilation, hormonal application, and the use of more than three antibacterial drugs, are risk factors for COVID-19 secondary pulmonary infection. Generalized linear models and logistic regression analysis showed antimicrobial use as an independent risk factor for COVID-19 secondary lung infection. There are many risk factors for secondary lung infection in severe COVID-19 patients, and it is recommended to use antibiotics reasonably.","Tang, Haicheng; Zhao, Zhangyan; Zhang, Xiaolin; Pan, Lei; Wu, Qingguo; Wang, Mei; Zhang, Yunbin; Li, Feng",Microb Pathog,,114

DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. METHODS: We conducted a telephone survey and interview of a random sample of patients who received different modalities of care (in-person, telephone, videocall, or visits deferred) during Michigan's shelter-in-place order beginning March 23rd, 2020. The survey assessed patient safety, patient satisfaction with care, perceptions of telehealth-based eye care, and worry about eyesight. Data was analyzed via frequency measures (e.g., means and standard deviations), Chi-square tests, ANOVA, and paired t-tests. Interviews were analyzed using Grounded Theory. RESULTS: 3274 patients were called and 1720 (53%) agreed to participate. In-person participants were significantly older than telephone (p=0.002) and videocall visit (p=0.001) participants. Significantly more white participants had in-person visits than minority participants (p=0.002). In-person visit participants worried about their eyesight more (2.7, SD=1.2) than those who had telephone (2.5, SD 1.3), videocall (2.4, SD=1.1), or deferred visits (2.4, SD=1.2) (p=0.004). Of all telephone or videocall visits, 1.5% (n=26) resulted in an in-person visit within 1 day, 2.9% (n=48) within 2-7 days, and 2.4% (n=40) within 8-14 days after the virtual visit demonstrating appropriate triage to telemedicine-based care. Patients frequently cited a desire for augmenting the telephone or videocall visits with objective test data. CONCLUSIONS: When appropriately triaged, tele-ophthalmology appears to be a safe way to reduce the volume of in-person visits to promote social distancing in the clinic. A hybrid model of eye care combining ancillary testing with a video or phone visit represents a promising model of care.","Newman-Casey, Paula Anne; De Lott, Lindsey; Cho, Juno; Ballouz, Dena; Azzouz, Lyna; Saleh, Sahal; Woodward, Maria A",Am. j. ophthalmol,,114

Due to presence of non-specific symptoms, it's always difficult to differentiate between paroxysmal sympathetic storm and cytokine storm syndrome and hence can delay specific treatment. CASE REPORT: We report a clinical case of 19-year-old male tested COVID 19 positive with diffuse axonal injury presented with features of paroxysmal sympathetic storm and cytokine storm syndrome. The patient showed the signs clinical improvement when we treated both these conditions. CONCLUSION: We suggest that clinicians need to have a high degree of suspicion of paroxysmal sympathetic storm in patients of traumatic brain injury and consider its diagnosis. Also, if patient is COVID 19 positive, early identification of signs of developing cytokine storm with monitoring of biomarkers is important for its timely management.","Singh, K.; Kumar, N.; Kumar, A.; Shaju, A.

506325,Purposing Saikosaponins for the treatment of COVID-19,2020,"A question of global concern regarding the sustainable future of humankind stems from the effect due to aerosols on the global climate. The quantification of atmospheric aerosols and their relationship to climatic impacts are key to understanding the dynamics of climate forcing and to improve our knowledge about climate change. Due to its response to precipitation, temperature, topography and human activity, one of the most dynamical atmospheric regions is the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL): ABL aerosols have a sizable impact on the evolution of the radiative forcing of climate change, human health, food security, and, ultimately, on the local and global economy. The identification of ABL pattern behaviour requires constant monitoring and the application of instrumental and computational methods for its detection and analysis. Here, we show a new method for the retrieval of ABL top arising from light detection and ranging (LiDAR) signals, by training a convolutional neural network in a supervised manner; forcing it to learn how to retrieve such a dynamical parameter on real, non-ideal conditions and in a fully automated, unsupervised way. Our findings pave the way for a full integration of LiDAR elastic, inelastic, and depolarisation signal processing, and provide a novel approach for real-time quantitative sensing of aerosols.","Vivas, David R.; S'anchez, Estiven; Reina, John H.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.04353v1.pdf,114

507399,Diagnostic accuracy estimates for COVID-19 RT-PCR and Lateral flow immunoassay tests with Bayesian latent class models,2021,"OBJECTIVES: COVID-19 has changed the epidemiology of trauma. However, Taiwan is a country with a low COVID-19 threat, and people's daily lives have remained mostly unchanged during this period. The purpose of this study is to investigate whether the trend of trauma incidence and the service of trauma care is affected by the relatively minor COVID-19 pandemic in Taiwan. DESIGN: A single-institute, retrograde cohort study. SETTING: An observational study based on the trauma registry of Chang Gung Memorial Hospital (CGMH). PARTICIPANTS: Trauma patients presented to the emergency department of CGMH in the period of 1 January to 30 June 2020 (week 1 to week 26) were designated as the COVID-19 group, with 1980 patients in total. Patients of the same period in 2015-2019 were designated as the pre-COVID-19 group, with 10 334 patients overall. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome is the incidence of trauma admission. Differences in trauma mechanism, severity, location and outcome were also compared in both groups. RESULTS: A decrease in trauma incidence during March and April 2020 was noticed. Significant change (p<0.001) in trauma mechanisms was discovered, with decreased burn (5.8% vs 3.6%) and assault (4.8% vs 1.2%), and increased transport accidents (43.2% vs 47.2%) and suicide (0.2% vs 1.0%) in the COVID-19 cohort. A shift in injury locations was also found with a 5% decrement of workplace injuries (19.8% vs 14.8%, p<0.001). CONCLUSION: The limited COVID-19 outbreak in Taiwan has led to a decreased incidence of trauma patients, and the reduction is mostly attributed to the decline in workplace injuries.","Kuo, Ling-Wei; Fu, Chih-Yuan; Liao, Chien-An; Liao, Chien-Hung; Wu, Yu-Tung; Huang, Jen-Fu; Hsieh, Chi-Hsun; Cheng, Chi-Tung",BMJ Open,,114
507653,Gastrointestinal lesion in adult-onset Langerhans cell histiocytosis,2020,"In addition to studies focused on estrogen mediation of sex-different regulation of systemic circulations, there is now increasing clinical relevance and research interests in the pulmonary circulation, in terms of sex differences in the morbidity and mortality of lung diseases such as inherent-, allergic- and inflammatory-based events. Thus, female predisposition to pulmonary artery hypertension (PAH) is an inevitable topic. To better understand the nature of sexual differentiation in the pulmonary circulation, and how heritable factors, in vivo- and/or in vitro-altered estrogen circumstances and changes in the live environment work in concert to discern the sex bias, this chapter reviews pulmonary events characterized by sex-different features, concomitant with exploration of how alterations of genetic expression and estrogen metabolisms trigger the female-predominant pathological signaling. We address the following: PAH (Sect.7.2) is characterized as an estrogenic promotion of its incidence (Sect. 7.2.2), as a function of specific germline mutations, and as an estrogen-elicited protection of its prognosis (Sect.7.2.1). More detail is provided to introduce a less recognized gene of Ephx2 that encodes soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) to degrade epoxyeicosatrienic acids (EETs). As a susceptible target of estrogen, Ephx2/sEH expression is downregulated by an estrogen-dependent epigenetic mechanism. Increases in pulmonary EETs then evoke a potentiation of PAH generation, but mitigation of its progression, a phenomenon similar to the estrogen-paradox regulation of PAH. Additionally, the female susceptibility to chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (Sect. 7.3) and asthma (Sect.7.4), but less preference to COVID-19 (Sect. 7.5), and roles of estrogen in their pathogeneses are briefly discussed.","Huang, An; Kandhi, Sharath; Sun, Dong",Adv Exp Med Biol,,114

507976,COVID-19 and liver disease: mechanistic and clinical perspectives,2021,"Due to its high lethality amongst the elderly, the safety of nursing homes has been of central importance during the COVID-19 pandemic. With test procedures becoming available at scale, such as antigen or RT-LAMP tests, and increasing availability of vaccinations, nursing homes might be able to safely relax prohibitory measures while controlling the spread of infections (meaning an average of one or less secondary infections per index case). Here, we develop a detailed agent-based epidemiological model for the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in nursing homes to identify optimal prevention strategies. The model is microscopically calibrated to high-resolution data from nursing homes in Austria, including detailed social contact networks and information on past outbreaks. We find that the effectiveness of mitigation testing depends critically on the timespan between test and test result, the detection threshold of the viral load for the test to give a positive result, and the screening frequencies of residents and employees. Under realistic conditions and in absence of an effective vaccine, we find that preventive screening of employees only might be sufficient to control outbreaks in nursing homes, provided that turnover times and detection thresholds of the tests are low enough. If vaccines that are moderately effective against infection and transmission are available, control is achieved if 80% or more of the inhabitants are vaccinated, even if no preventive testing is in place and residents are allowed to have visitors. Since these results strongly depend on vaccine efficacy against infection, retention of testing infrastructures, regular voluntary screening and sequencing of virus genomes is advised to enable early identification of new variants of concern.","Lasser, Jana; Zuber, Johannes; Sorger, Johannes; Dervic, Elma; Ledebur, Katharina; Lindner, Simon David; Klager, Elisabeth; Kletevcka-Pulker, Maria; Willschke, Harald; Stangl, Katrin; Stadtmann, Sarah; Haslinger, Christian; Klimek, Peter; Wochele-Thoma, Thomas",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.00550v3.pdf,114

The serum level of neutralizing IgG to S-Trimer Protein SARS-Cov-2 was determined. The number of antigen-recognizing receptors of B-lymphocytes represented by membrane IgG to S-Trimer Protein SARSCov-2 was also evaluated. It was found that in some of the subjects who consider themselves not sick, antibodies and antigen-recognizing receptors of B-lymphocytes are not detected. However, a significant proportion of healthy individuals (67 %) were found to have elevated levels of serum antibodies and a high number of antigen-recognizing receptors. Persons who recovered from COVID-19 had elevated levels of serum IgG antibodies and high levels of antigen-recognizing receptors of B-lymphocytes in peripheral blood. However, in patients with a more severe course of infection who were prescribed glucocorticosteroids during the treatment, the serum IgG and lymphocyte receptor levels were lower. Individuals who noted respiratory infection of varying severity during the epidemic period, but not confirmed by PCR for COVID-19 and did not receive glucocorticosteroids, there were high levels of serum neutralizing IgG antibodies and a high content of antigenrecognizing receptors of peripheral blood B-lymphocytes, represented by membrane IgG to S-Trimer Protein SARS-Cov-2.","Baturin, V.

METHODS: Sixty pediatric patients admitted to the hospital between March 11, 2020 and April 15, 2020 with respiratory tract infections were evaluated retrospectively. Among them, 20 patients with reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests and chest computed tomography (CT) examinations were included in the study. According to the RT-PCR test results, the patients were divided into the COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 groups. The clinical observations, laboratory results, and radiological features from the two groups were then compared. RESULTS: According to the RT-PCR test results, 12 patients were assigned to the COVID-19 group and 8 to the non-COVID-19 group. There were no significant differences between the two groups in terms of clinical or laboratory features. In terms of radiological features, the presence of bronchiectasis and peribronchial thickening was statistically significantly higher in the non-COVID-19 group (P = 0.010 and P = 0.010, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: In pediatric cases, diagnosing COVID-19 using radiological imaging methods plays an important role in determining the correct treatment approach by eliminating the possibility of other infections.","Kuzan, Beyza Nur; Aslan, Bülent; Kuzan, Taha Yusuf; Yagci, Aysegül Karahasan; Çimsit, Nuri Çagatay",World J Pediatr,,114

However, in large-scale mass crisis events, the stressors may be highly interrelated, indicating shared experience. Furthermore, few stressor exposure scales also measure appraised stressfulness of those stressors. Development of a psychometrically sound measure of both stressor exposure and appraisal advances the study of highly stressful events such as community-wide crises, especially in providing a useful measure of its cumulative stressfulness. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is an enduring, worldwide stressor with an indefinite timeline. The COVID-19 Stressor Scale is a 23-item measure of stressor exposure and appraisal related to the pandemic developed within the first weeks of widespread shelter-in-place practices in the Unites States. We present initial psychometric results of the COVID-19 Stressor Scale. Results of a principal components analysis indicate that the measure is unidimensional and has strong internal consistency. Evidence of convergent and discriminant validity were demonstrated. The COVID-19 Stressor Scale is a useful measure for studying the ongoing stressors associated with the pandemic and presents a model for measuring other massive, ongoing crises.","Tambling, Rachel R; Russell, Beth S; Park, Crystal L; Fendrich, Michael; Hutchinson, Morica; Horton, Abagail L; Tomkunas, Alexandria J",Health Educ Behav,,114

To better understand human exposure to NNIs, 10 parent compounds, and 6 of their metabolites were analyzed in 408 urine samples collected from 129 healthy adults in Wuhan, Central China, during autumn and winter of 2018. These specimens included repeated urine samples taken in 3 d from 75 volunteers. The urinary concentrations of desnitro-imidacloprid (DN-IMI), imidacloprid-olefin (IMI-olefin), and desmethyl-acetamiprid (DM-ACE) were higher (4-40 times) than those of their parent compounds (IMI and acetamiprid, ACE). DN-IMI and IMI-olefin accounted for 92% of the urinary &#931;3IMI (the sum of IMI and its specific metabolites measured). Positive correlations (r) were observed between DN-IMI and IMI (0.50), IMI-olefin and IMI (0.75), and DM-ACE and ACE (0.53). Good to excellent inter-day reliabilities (unadjusted intraclass correlation coefficients) were observed for IMI-olefin (0.61) and DM-ACE (0.81), while moderate inter-day reliability was observed for DN-IMI (0.43).

517743,Systemic treatment of advanced or recurrent biliary tract cancer,2020,"BACKGROUND: The traditional model of promotion and tenure in the health professions relies heavily on formal scholarship through teaching, research, and service. Institutions consider how much weight to give activities in each of these areas and determine a threshold for advancement. With the emergence of social media, scholars can engage wider audiences in creative ways and have a broader impact. Conventional metrics like the h-index do not account for social media impact. Social media engagement is poorly represented in most curricula vitae (CV) and therefore is undervalued in promotion and tenure reviews. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to develop crowdsourced guidelines for documenting social media scholarship. These guidelines aimed to provide a structure for documenting a scholar's general impact on social media, as well as methods of documenting individual social media contributions exemplifying innovation, education, mentorship, advocacy, and dissemination. METHODS: To create unifying guidelines, we created a crowdsourced process that capitalized on the strengths of social media and generated a case example of successful use of the medium for academic collaboration. The primary author created a draft of the guidelines and then sought input from users on Twitter via a publicly accessible Google Document. There was no limitation on who could provide input and the work was done in a democratic, collaborative fashion. Contributors edited the draft over a period of 1 week (September 12-18, 2020). The primary and secondary authors then revised the draft to make it more concise. The guidelines and manuscript were then distributed to the contributors for edits and adopted by the group. All contributors were given the opportunity to serve as coauthors on the publication and were told upfront that authorship would depend on whether they were able to document the ways in which they met the 4 International Committee of Medical Journal Editors authorship criteria. RESULTS: We developed 2 sets of guidelines: Guidelines for Listing All Social Media Scholarship Under Public Scholarship (in Research/Scholarship Section of CV) and Guidelines for Listing Social Media Scholarship Under Research, Teaching, and Service Sections of CV. Institutions can choose which set fits their existing CV format. CONCLUSIONS: With more uniformity, scholars can better represent the full scope and impact of their work. These guidelines are not intended to dictate how individual institutions should weigh social media contributions within promotion and tenure cases. Instead, by providing an initial set of guidelines, we hope to provide scholars and their institutions with a common format and language to document social media scholarship.","Acquaviva, Kimberly D; Mugele, Josh; Abadilla, Natasha; Adamson, Tyler; Bernstein, Samantha L; Bhayani, Rakhee K; Büchi, Annina Elisabeth; Burbage, Darcy; Carroll, Christopher L; Davis, Samantha P; Dhawan, Natasha; English, Kim; Grier, Jennifer T; Gurney, Mary K; Hahn, Emily S; Haq, Heather; Huang, Brendan; Jain, Shikha; Jun, Jin; Kerr, Wesley T; Keyes, Timothy; Kirby, Amelia R; Leary, Marion; Marr, Mollie; Major, Ajay; Meisel, Jason V; Petersen, Erika A; Raguan, Barak; Rhodes, Allison; Rupert, Deborah D; Sam-Agudu, Nadia A; Saul, Naledi; Shah, Jarna R; Sheldon, Lisa Kennedy; Sinclair, Christian T; Spencer, Kerry; Strand, Natalie H; Streed, Carl G; Trudell, Avery M",J Med Internet Res,,114

Furthermore, news reports and public health data show that residents of these communities have more comorbidities, utilize hospitals with fewer resources, and experience greater treatment delays, all resulting in higher mortality related to COVID-19. The same social determinants contributing to the inequities seen in COVID-19 drive similar disparities in oncology. Oncologic inequities have long predated the inequities associated with COVID-19 and have led to considerably more deaths. These stark realities demand that we stop merely reporting the impact of adverse social determinants on the health of communities. We must instead target these causes of healthcare disparities.

520800,Persistent Cardiac Magnetic Resonance Imaging Features of Myocarditis Detected Months After COVID-19 Infection,2021,"Conducting numerous, rapid, and reliable PCR tests for SARS-CoV-2 is essential for our ability to monitor and control the current COVID-19 pandemic. Here, we tested the sensitivity and efficiency of SARS-CoV-2 detection in clinical samples collected directly into a mix of lysis buffer and RNA preservative, thus inactivating the virus immediately after sampling. We tested 79 COVID-19 patients and 20 healthy controls. We collected two samples (nasopharyngeal swabs) from each participant: one swab was inserted into a test tube with Viral Transport Medium (VTM), following the standard guideline used as the recommended method for sample collection; the other swab was inserted into a lysis buffer supplemented with nucleic acid stabilization mix (coined NSLB). We found that RT-qPCR tests of patients were significantly more sensitive with NSLB sampling, reaching detection threshold 2.1±0.6 (Mean±SE) PCR cycles earlier then VTM samples from the same patient. We show that this improvement is most likely since NSLB samples are not diluted in lysis buffer before RNA extraction. Re-extracting RNA from NSLB samples after 72 hours at room temperature did not affect the sensitivity of detection, demonstrating that NSLB allows for long periods of sample preservation without special cooling equipment. We also show that swirling the swab in NSLB and discarding it did not reduce sensitivity compared to retaining the swab in the tube, thus allowing improved automation of COVID-19 tests. Overall, we show that using NSLB instead of VTM can improve the sensitivity, safety, and rapidity of COVID-19 tests at a time most needed.","Erster, Oran; Shkedi, Omer; Benedek, Gil; Zilber, Eyal; Varkovitzky, Itay; Shirazi, Rachel; Oriya Shorka, Dorit; Cohen, Yuval; Bar, Tzahi; Yechieli, Rafi; Tepperberg Oikawa, Michal; Venkert, Dana; Linial, Michal; Oiknine-Djian, Esther; Mandelboim, Michal; Livneh, Zvi; Shenhav-Saltzman, Gilat; Mendelson, Ella; Wolf, Dana; Szwarcwort-Cohen, Moran; Mor, Orna; Lewis, Yair; Zeevi, Danny",PLoS One,,114
520803,The role of vagus nerve stimulation in sepsis,2020,"Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome is a serious illness of unknown etiology, characterized by debilitating exhaustion, memory impairment, pain and sleep abnormalities. Viral infections are believed to initiate the pathogenesis of this syndrome although the definite proof remains elusive. With the unfolding of COVID-19 pandemic, the interest in this condition has resurfaced as excessive tiredness, a major complaint of patients infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus, often lingers for a long time, resulting in disability and poor life quality. In a previous article, we hypothesized that COVID-19-upregulated angiotensin II triggered premature endothelial cell senescence, disrupting the intestinal and blood brain barriers. Here, we hypothesize further that post-viral sequelae, including myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome, are promoted by the gut microbes or toxin translocation from the gastrointestinal tract into other tissues, including the brain. This model is supported by the SARS-CoV-2 interaction with host proteins and bacterial lipopolysaccharide. Conversely, targeting microbial translocation and cellular senescence may ameliorate the symptoms of this disabling illness.","Sfera, Adonis Osorio Carolina Zapata Martín del Campo Carlos M.; Pereida, Shaniah Maurer Steve Maldonado Jose Campo Kozlakidis Zisis",Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience,,114

He argues for a need to rethink the personal autonomy approaches to HIV testing in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) countries. HIV/AIDS has remained a leading cause of disease burden in SSA. It is important to bring this disease burden under control, especially given the availability of current effective antiretroviral regimens in low- and middle-income countries. In most SSA countries the ethic or value of personal autonomy or self-determination is promoted as primary in HIV testing decision-making. SSA policymakers have an ontological and moral duty to adopt HIV testing policies that reflect human and medical realities, relationships, local contexts, and respect human rights for both individuals and others who are affected by HIV in society. Without rethinking the value of autonomy in HIV testing decision-making, the article cautions that attainment of the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 3 and the UNAIDS fast-track strategy that explicitly call to end the epidemic by 2030 will not be feasible for SSA.","Kasoka, Kasoka",Med Health Care Philos,,114

Shutting down broad‐specificity proteases, however, is problematic because normal functions by these proteases will be affected. Herein, nanoparticle receptors were prepared from molecular imprinting for complex biological peptides. Their strong and selective binding enabled them to protect their targeted sequences from proteolysis in aqueous solution at stoichiometric amounts. Generality of the method was demonstrated by the protection of hydrophobic and hydrophilic peptides from different proteases, selective protection of a segment of a long peptide, and selective protection of a targeted peptide in a mixture. Most interestingly, two receptors targeting different parts of a long peptide could work in cooperation to protect the overall sequence, highlighting the versatility of the method.","Li, Xiaowei; Chen, Kaiqian; Zhao, Yan",Angew Chem Int Ed Engl,https://doi.org/10.1002/anie.202102148; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33725413/,114

The lockdown and reorganization of medical units also altered the accessibility to outpatient rehabilitation services. AIM: The focus of interest in our report lies in the evaluation of the outpatient rehabilitation treatment accessibility at our center in the time of the COVID-19 pandemic. DESIGN: Cross-sectional observational study. SETTING: Outpatients Rehabilitation Unit at University Medical Centre Maribor (UMC Maribor), Slovenia. POPULATION: Patients with diverse pathologies referred to outpatient rehabilitation. METHODS: The data were gathered retrospectively at the Institute of Physical and Rehabilitation Medicine (IPRM) at the UMC Maribor. The search included all the patients treated at IPRM in the pre-COVID and COVID period from March 16 to August 31 in 2019 and 2020. The data for the period including the lockdown (March 16 to August 31, 2020) and the period after the lockdown (June 1 to August 31, 2020) was analyzed and compared to the same timeframes in 2019. We were interested in the magnitude of decline in the total number of patients, the number of the first and follow-up visits, the number of sessions and in the profile and pathologies of patients comparing pre-COVID and COVID period. The &#967;2 and Fisher's Exact test were used in the analysis. RESULTS: With the lockdown period included there was a 44% decline in the total number of patients, a 71.1% decline in the number of sessions, a 42% decline of the first visits and a 60.9% decline of follow-up visits. When comparing the pre-COVID and COVID period after the lockdown, a 28.5% decline in the number of patients treated in 2020 compared to 2019 was observed. By analyzing the number of sessions in the pre-COVID and COVID period after the lockdown there was a 46.6% decline. No statistically significant difference was found in the age groups between the two periods (X2=9.466; P=0.05). The difference for the first and follow-up visits in 2019 and 2020 proved to be statistically significant (P<0.001), as well as the difference in percentage of patients in the acute and chronic group (P=0.037). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings showed how COVID-19 outbreak hindered the accessibility to outpatient rehabilitation service. Not only has the number of patients substantially reduced in the year 2020 compared to 2019, but also the number of sessions and number of first and follow-up visits declined. The demographic structure of the patients remained the same.

In this study, a peptide-conjugated nano-delivery system was explored for the purpose of glioma therapy. A peptide-decorated copolymer was used to prepare nanoparticles (NPs) by a solvent evaporation method. The particle size was in the range of 160.9 ± 3.3–173.5 ± 3.6 nm with monodistribution, and the zeta potentials ranged from −18.6 ± 1.2 to +7.9 ± 0.6 mV showing an increasing trend with R9-peptide. An in vitro cocultured BBB model illustrated the internalization of peptide-conjugated NPs in bEnd.3 cells followed by uptake by U87-MG cells indicating both BBB-crossing and glioma-penetrating abilities. IVIS (In Vivo Imaging System) images revealed that T7-conjugated NPs specifically accumulated in the brain more than peptide-free NPs and had less biodistribution in nontarget tissues than T7/R9 dual-peptide conjugated NPs. The benefit of T7-peptide as a targeting ligand for NPs across the BBB with accumulation in the brain was elucidated.","Lo, Yu-Chen; Lin, Wen-Jen",Pharmaceutics,https://doi.org/10.3390/pharmaceutics13081249; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34452209/,114

These hypotheses are testable and could guide therapeutic and preventive interventions. As obesity is now almost ubiquitous and no vaccine for COVID-19 is currently available, even a modest reduction in the impact of obesity on mortality and morbidity from this viral infection could have profound consequences for public health.","Lockhart, Sam M.; O’Rahilly, Stephen",Med,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2666634020300106; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666634020300106?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32838359/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.medj.2020.06.005,114

Intestinal content samples were collected from 101 broiler flocks from several regions of Jordan to detect the presence of astrovirus, coronavirus, reovirus, and rotavirus, by using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Forty-six of these flocks were clinically healthy with no enteric disease, and the other 55 flocks were clinically suffering from diarrhea. The samples were collected between 5 and 16 d of age. The results show that 79% of total 101 flocks tested were infected with one or more of the above enteric viruses. Coronavirus was the most common virus, detected in 56.4% of these flocks, with astrovirus in 29.7% of the flocks, and rotavirus (9.9%) and reovirus (5.6%) being the least common. None of these flocks were found to be infected with all four viruses, but one of the flocks was found to be infected with astrovirus, coronavirus, and rotavirus simultaneously. Individual infection was noted with astrovirus, coronavirus and rotavirus but not with reovirus, whereas all flocks infected with reovirus were also infected with coronavirus. There was no statistical evidence to link these viruses as the main cause of diarrhea in the flocks tested.

We aimed to evaluate the presence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies in patients with SLE with or without previous COVID-19-related symptoms or RT-PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: For this analysis, we included patients with SLE from two cohorts based in New York City: the Web-based Assessment of Autoimmune, Immune-Mediated and Rheumatic Patients during the COVID-19 pandemic (WARCOV) study; and the NYU Lupus Cohort (a prospective registry of patients at NYU Langone Health and NYC Health + Hospitals/Bellevue). Patients in both cohorts were tested for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies via commercially available immunoassays, processed through hospital or outpatient laboratories. Patients recruited from the NYU Lupus Cohort, referred from affiliated providers, or admitted to hospital with COVID-19 were tested for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies as part of routine surveillance during follow-up clinical visits. FINDINGS: 329 patients with SLE were included in this analysis, 146 from the WARCOV study and 183 from the NYU Lupus Cohort, and were tested for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies between April 29, 2020, and Feb 9, 2021. 309 (94%) were women and 91 (28%) were of Hispanic ethnicity. 51 (16%) of 329 patients had a positive SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody test. Seropositive patients were more likely than seronegative patients to be Hispanic (24 [47%] of 51 vsz 67 [24%] of 278). Other demographic variables, SLE-specific factors, and immunosuppressant use were not associated with SARS-CoV-2 positivity. Of the 29 patients with COVID-19 previously confirmed by RT-PCR, 18 (62%) were on immunosuppressants; 24 (83%) of 29 patients tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies. Of 17 patients who had symptoms of COVID-19 but negative concurrent RT-PCR testing, one (6%) developed an antibody response. Of 26 patients who had COVID-19-related symptoms but did not undergo RT-PCR testing, six (23%) developed an antibody response. Of 83 patients who had no symptoms of COVID-19 and no RT-PCR testing, four (5%) developed an antibody response. Among 36 patients who were initially SARS-CoV-2 IgG positive, the majority maintained reactivity serially (88% up to 10 weeks, 83% up to 20 weeks, and 80% up to 30 weeks). Seven (70%) of ten patients with confirmed COVID-19 had antibody positivity beyond 30 weeks from disease onset. INTERPRETATION: Most patients with SLE and confirmed COVID-19 were able to produce and maintain a serological response despite the use of a variety of immunosuppressants, providing reassurance about the efficacy and durability of humoral immunity and possible protection against re-infection with SARS-CoV-2.

During COVID-19 pandemic time, many such patients could not be operated at early time because of the limitation of the medical resources, the risk of infection and redirection of medical attention to a severe infective health problem. METHODS: A search of electronic databases (PubMed, Medline, CINAHL, EMBASE and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials) with keywords ""COVID"", ""COVID-19"", “SARS-COV-2”, “Corona”, ""pandemic"", ""hip fracture"", ""trochanteric fracture"" and ""neck femur fracture"" revealed 64 studies evaluating treatment of hip fracture in elderly patients during COVID-19 pandemic time. After screening, 7 studies were identified that described the mortality and morbidity in hip fractures in both COVID-19 infected (COVID-19 +) and non-infected (COVID-19 −) patients. The 30-day mortality rate, inpatient mortality rate, critical care/special care need, readmission rate and complications rate in both groups were evaluated. Data were analyzed using Review Manager (RevMan) V.5.3. RESULTS: There were significantly increased risks of 30-day mortality (32.23% COVID-19 + death vs. 8.85% COVID-19 − death) and inpatient mortality (29.33% vs. 2.62%) among COVID-19 + patients with odds ratio (OR) of 4.84 (95% CI: 3.13-7.47, p < 0.00001) and 15.12 (95% CI: 6.12-37.37, p < 0.00001), respectively. The COVID-19 + patients needed more critical care admission (OR = 5.34, 95% CI: 3.41-8.38, p < 0.00001) and they remain admitted for a longer time in the hospital (MD = 3.6, 95% CI: 1.74-5.45, p = 0.0001); but there was no difference in readmission rate between these 2 groups. The risks of overall complications (OR = 17.22), development of pneumonia (OR = 21.02), and acute respiratory distress syndrome/acute respiratory failure (OR = 32.96) was significantly high among COVID-19 + patients compared to COVID-19 − patients. CONCLUSIONS: There are increased risks of the 30-day mortality, inpatient mortality and critical care admission among hip fracture patients who are COVID-19 +. The chances of developing pneumonia and acute respiratory failure are more in these patients than in COVID-19 ‒ patients.","Tripathy, Sujit Kumar; Varghese, Paulson; Panigrahi, Sibasish; Panda, Bijnya Birajita; Srinivasan, Anand; Sen, Ramesh Kumar",Chin J Traumatol,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1008127521000882?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cjtee.2021.05.004; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34154865/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1008127521000882,114

Accordingly, emphasis is presently on curbing transmission, which is potentially achievable by identification and elimination of potential reservoirs. The strongest contenders for being the disease reservoir are cases of Post Kala-azar Dermal Leishmaniasis (PKDL) which occurs in a minor proportion of individuals apparently cured of Visceral Leishmaniasis (VL). The demonstration of parasites in tissue aspirates despite being a risky and invasive process is the gold standard for diagnosis of VL, but is now being replaced by serological tests e.g., rK39 strip test and direct agglutination test. However, these antibody based tests are limited in their ability to diagnose relapses, detect cases of PKDL, and monitor effectiveness of treatment. Accordingly, detection of antigen or nucleic acids by polymerase chain reaction has been successfully applied for monitoring of parasite kinetics. This review article provides updated information on recent developments regarding the available antibody or antigen/nucleic acid based biomarkers for longitudinal monitoring of patients with VL or PKDL and emphasizes the need for availability of studies pertaining to quantification of treatment response or relapse.","Moulik, Srija; Sengupta, Shilpa; Chatterjee, Mitali",Front Cell Infect Microbiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33692966/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fcimb.2021.623437,114
593422,Common genetic variants identify therapeutic targets for COVID-19 and individuals at high risk of severe disease,2020-12-16,"Background The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a high death toll. We aimed to describe the place and cause of death during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods This national death registry included all adult (aged [â¥]18 years) deaths in England and Wales between 1st January 2014 and 30th June 2020. Analyses were based upon ICD-10 codes corresponding to the underlying cause of death as stated on the Medical Certificate of Cause of Death. Daily deaths during COVID-19 pandemic were compared against the expected daily deaths estimated using Farrington surveillance algorithm for daily historical data between 2014 and 2020, by place and cause of death. Findings Between 2nd March and 30th June 2020, there was an excess mortality of 57860 (a proportional increase of 35%) compared with the expected deaths, of which 50603 (86.2%) were COVID-19 related. Almost half the excess deaths occurred in care homes (25611 deaths) where deaths were 55% higher than expected. One fifth of the excess deaths occurred in hospital (15938 deaths; a proportional increase of 21%) with the remainder occurring at home (16190 deaths; a proportional increase of 39%). At home, only 14% of 16190 excess deaths were related to COVID-19, with 5 963 deaths due to cancer and 2485 deaths due to cardiac disease, very few of which involved COVID-19. In care homes or hospices, 61% of the 25611 excess deaths were related to COVID-19, 5539 of which were due to respiratory disease and most of these (4315 deaths) involved COVID-19. In hospital, there were 16174 fewer deaths than expected which did not involve COVID-19, and there were 4088 fewer deaths due to cancer and 1398 fewer deaths due to cardiac disease than expected. Interpretation The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a substantial increase in the absolute numbers of deaths occurring at home and care homes. There was a huge burden of excess deaths occurring in care homes, which were poorly characterised, and were likely to be, at least in part, the result of undiagnosed COVID-19. There was a smaller but important and ongoing excess in deaths at home, particularly from cancer and cardiac disease, which suggests avoidance of hospital care for non-COVID-19 conditions.","Wu, Jianhua; Mafham, Marion; Mamas, Mamas; Rashid, Muhammad; Kontopantelis, Evangelos; Deanfield, John; Belder, Mark de; Gale, Chris P",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.08.12.20173302v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.12.20173302,114

To date, more than 170 RNA modifications have been discovered in all types of cellular RNA. Only a few, however, have been found in viral RNA, and the function of most of these has yet to be elucidated. Those few we have discovered and whose functions we understand have a varied effect on each virus. They facilitate RNA export from the nucleus, aid in viral protein synthesis, recruit host enzymes, and even interact with the host immune machinery. The most common methods for their study are mass spectrometry and antibody assays linked to next-generation sequencing. However, given that the actual amount of modified RNA can be very small, it is important to pair meticulous scientific methodology with the appropriate detection methods and to interpret the results with a grain of salt. Once discovered, RNA modifications enhance our understanding of viruses and present a potential target in combating them. This review provides a summary of the currently known chemical modifications of viral RNA, the effects they have on viral machinery, and the methods used to detect them.","Potužník, Jiří František; Cahová, Hana",mBio,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32934087/; https://doi.org/10.1128/mbio.02131-20,114
594497,Carbapenem-Resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae Associated with COVID-19,2021-05-11,"Advancement in the understanding of inflammation regulation during tuberculosis (TB) treatment has led to novel therapeutic approaches being proposed. The use of immune mediators like anti-inflammatory and pro-resolving molecules for such, merits attention. Drug repurposing is a widely used strategy that seeks to identify new targets to treat or manage diseases. The widely explored nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) ibuprofen and a more recently explored pharmaconutrition therapy using omega-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 LCPUFAs), have the potential to modulate the immune system and are thus considered potential repurposed drugs in this context. These approaches may be beneficial as supportive therapy to the already existing treatment regimen to improve clinical outcomes. Here, we applied adjunct ibuprofen and n-3 LCPUFA therapy, respectively, with standard anti-TB treatment, in a C3HeB/FeJ murine model of TB. Bacterial loads, lung pathology, lung cytokines/chemokines and lung lipid mediators were measured as outcomes. Lung bacterial load on day 14 post-treatment (PT) was lower in the n-3 LCPUFA, compared to the ibuprofen group (p = 0.039), but was higher in the ibuprofen group than the treated control group (p = 0.0315). Treated control and ibuprofen groups had more free alveolar space initially as compared to the n-3 LCPUFA group (4 days PT, p= 0.0114 and p= 0.002, respectively); however, significantly more alveolar space was present in the n-3 LCPUFA group as compared to the ibuprofen group by end of treatment (14 days PT, p = 0.035). Interleukin 6 (IL-6) was lower in the ibuprofen group as compared to the treated control, EPA/DHA and untreated control groups at 4 days PT (p = 0.019, p = 0.019 and p = 0.002, respectively). Importantly, pro-resolving EPA derived 9-HEPE, 11-HEPE, 12-HEPE and 18-HEPE lipid mediators (LMs) were significantly higher in the EPA/DHA group as compared to the ibuprofen and treated control groups. This suggests that n-3 LCPUFAs do improve pro-resolving and anti-inflammatory properties in TB, and it may be safe and effective to co-administer as adjunct therapy with standard TB treatment, particularly longer-term. Also, our results show host benefits upon short-term co-administration of ibuprofen, but not throughout the entire TB treatment course.","Hayford, Frank E.

However, medical care delay or avoidance might increase morbidity and mortality risk associated with treatable and preventable health conditions and might contribute to reported excess deaths directly or indirectly related to COVID-19 (2). To assess delay or avoidance of urgent or emergency and routine medical care because of concerns about COVID-19, a web-based survey was administered by Qualtrics, LLC, during June 24-30, 2020, to a nationwide representative sample of U.S. adults aged ≥18 years. Overall, an estimated 40.9% of U.S. adults have avoided medical care during the pandemic because of concerns about COVID-19, including 12.0% who avoided urgent or emergency care and 31.5% who avoided routine care. The estimated prevalence of urgent or emergency care avoidance was significantly higher among the following groups: unpaid caregivers for adults* versus noncaregivers (adjusted prevalence ratio [aPR] = 2.9); persons with two or more selected underlying medical conditions† versus those without those conditions (aPR = 1.9); persons with health insurance versus those without health insurance (aPR = 1.8); non-Hispanic Black (Black) adults (aPR = 1.6) and Hispanic or Latino (Hispanic) adults (aPR = 1.5) versus non-Hispanic White (White) adults; young adults aged 18-24 years versus adults aged 25-44 years (aPR = 1.5); and persons with disabilities§ versus those without disabilities (aPR = 1.3). Given this widespread reporting of medical care avoidance because of COVID-19 concerns, especially among persons at increased risk for severe COVID-19, urgent efforts are warranted to ensure delivery of services that, if deferred, could result in patient harm.

Several respiratory viruses are able to cause post-viral olfactory dysfunction, suggesting a sensorineural damage. Since the olfactory bulb is considered an immunological organ contributing to prevent the invasion of viruses, it could have a role in host defense. The inflammatory products locally released in COVID-19, leading to a local damage and causing olfactory loss, simultaneously may interfere with the viral spread into the central nervous system. In this context, olfactory receptors could play a role as an alternative way of SARS-CoV-2 entry into cells locally, in the central nervous system, and systemically. Differences in olfactory bulb due to sex and age may contribute to clarify the different susceptibility to infection and understand the role of age in transmission and disease severity. Finally, evaluation of the degree of functional impairment (grading), central/peripheral anosmia (localization), and the temporal course (evolution) may be useful tools to counteract COVID-19.","Gori, Alessandra; Leone, Fabrizio; Loffredo, Lorenzo; Cinicola, Bianca Laura; Brindisi, Giulia; De Castro, Giovanna; Spalice, Alberto; Duse, Marzia; Zicari, Anna Maria",Front Neurol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fneur.2020.00956; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33013637/,114

The virus consists of a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome of approximately 7.5 kb, with a polyadenylated 3' end. We now report on the cloning and nucleotide sequencing of an overlapping, contiguous set of cDNA clones representing the entire genome of the HEV Burma strain [HEV(B)]. The largest open reading frame extends approximately 5 kb from the Fend and contains the RNA-directed RNA polymerase and nucleoside triphosphate binding motifs. The second major open reading frame (ORF2) begins 37 by downstream of the first and extends approximately 2 kb to the termination codon present 65 by from the 3' terminal stretch of poly(A) residues. ORF2 contains a consensus signal peptide sequence at its amino terminus and a capsid-like region with a high content of basic amino acids similar to that seen with other virus capsid proteins. A third open reading frame partially overlaps the first and second and encompasses only 369 bp. In addition to the 7.5-kb full-length genomic transcript, two subgenomic polyadenylated messages of approximately 3.7 and 2.0 kb were detected in infected liver using a probe from the 3' third of the genome. The genomic organization of the virus is consistent with the Fend encoding nonstructural and the 3' end encoding the viral structural gene(s). The expression strategy of the virus involves the use of three different open reading frames and at least three different transcripts. HEV was previously determined to be a nonenveloped particle with a diameter of 27–34 nm. These findings on the genetic organization and expression strategy of HEV suggest that it is the prototype human pathogen for a new class of RNA virus or perhaps a separate genus within the Caliciviridae family","Tam, Albert W.; Smith, Matthew M.; Guerra, Martha E.; Huang, Chiao-Chain; Bradley, Daniel W.; Fry, Kirk E.; Reyes, Gregory R.",Virology,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/0042682291907609; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0042682291907609; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1926770/,114

These pathogens are transmitted, directly or indirectly, and can lead to epidemics or even pandemics. The resulting infection may lead to mild-to-severe symptoms such as life-threatening fever or diarrhea. Infectious diseases may be asymptomatic in some individuals but may lead to disastrous effects in others. Despite the advances in medicine, infectious diseases are a leading cause of death worldwide, especially in low-income countries. With the advent of mathematical tools, scientists are now able to better predict epidemics, understand the specificity of each pathogen, and identify potential targets for drug development. Artificial intelligence and its components have been widely publicized for their ability to better diagnose certain types of cancer from imaging data. This chapter aims at identifying potential applications of machine learning in the field of infectious diseases. We are deliberately focusing on key aspects of infection: diagnosis, transmission, response to treatment, and resistance. We are proposing the use of extreme values as an avenue of interest for future developments in the field of infectious diseases.

Data on onset, course, comorbidities, number of drugs including angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin-II-receptor antagonists (sartans), follow-up swab, pharmacological treatments, non-invasive respiratory support, ICU admission, and deaths were recorded. Among 411 SARS-COV-2 patients (67.7% males) median age was 70.8 years (range 5–99). Chest CT was performed in 317 (77.2%) and showed interstitial pneumonia in 304 (96%).

The correlation between Tim-3 expression and the clinical indices was estimated using linear regression. RESULTS: Tim-3 expressions on peripheral CD3(+) T cells and CD8(+) T cells in ICH patients are significantly downregulated, while Tim-3 expressions on CD14(+) monocytes and CD16(+)CD56(+) NK cells are increased. Furthermore, Tim-3 expression on peripheral CD8(+) T cells was negatively correlated with the inflammatory response, the disease severity and the outcome of ICH patients. However, there was no relationship between Tim-3 expression and blood glucose concentration.

597488,Effect of Collaborative Review of Electronic Patient-Reported Outcomes for Shared Reporting in Breast Cancer Patients: Descriptive Comparative Study,2021-03-17,"Background: Previous studies during SARS and Ebola pandemics have shown that quarantine is associated with several negative psychological effects, such as post-traumatic stress symptoms, confusion, and anger. These conditions may affect the course of many diseases, including migraine. Although it is possible that the quarantine measures for the current COVID-19 pandemic affect migraine burden, no information is currently available on this issue. Aim: In this study, we aimed to: (1) explore the possible changes in migraine frequency, severity, and days with acute medication intake during quarantine period; (2) evaluate possible differences in migraine outcomes in consideration of lifestyle changes, emotions, pandemic diffusion, and COVID-19 infection. Methods: We interviewed patients who were included in the observational Italian Headache Registry (Registro Italiano Cefalee, RICE), retrospectively collecting information on main headache features, lifestyle factors, emotions, individual infection status, and perception of COVID-19 for 2 months before (pre-quarantine) and after the beginning of the quarantine (quarantine). Inclusion criteria were: age > 18, diagnosis of migraine without aura, migraine with aura and chronic migraine, last in-person visit more than 3 months preceding the beginning of quarantine. Results: A total of 433 migraine subjects agreed to be interviewed. We found an overall reduction in headache frequency (9.42 ± 0.43 days with headache vs. 8.28 ± 0.41) and intensity (6.57 ± 0.19 vs. 6.59 ± 0.21) during the quarantine, compared to pre-quarantine. There was a correlation between improvement and number of days of stay-at-home. When results were stratified for geographic area, we found a tendency toward worsening of headache frequency in northern Italy. Disgust regarding viral infection corresponded to a minor improvement in migraine. Conclusions: Migraine patients showed a mild improvement of migraine features, probably attributable to resilient behavior toward pandemic distress. Disgust regarding the contagion whereas potentially favoring defensive behavior, could potentially worsen migraine. The spontaneous limitation of migraine burden during quarantine could favor patient follow-up via the use of telemedicine visits, reliable diaries, and frequent remote contacts.","Delussi, Marianna; Gentile, Eleonora; Coppola, Gianluca; Prudenzano, Addolorata Maria Pia; Rainero, Innocenzo; Sances, Grazia; Abagnale, Chiara; Caponnetto, Valeria; De Cesaris, Francesco; Frattale, Ilaria; Guaschino, Elena; Marcinnò, Andrea; Ornello, Raffaele; Pistoia, Francesca; Putortì, Alessia; Roca, Maria Elena; Roveta, Fausto; Lupi, Chiara; Trojano, Maria; Pierelli, Francesco; Geppetti, Pierangelo; Sacco, Simona; de Tommaso, Marina",Front Neurol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fneur.2020.597881; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33240213/,114

RESULTS: 401 patients (mean age 38.16 ± 13.43 years) were identified to be SARS-CoV-2 positive and 80% of cases were male. 160 patients had moderate severity and 241 were mild in severity. The most common signs and symptoms at presentation were cough, fever, fatigue, and shortness of breath. Neutrophil and lymphocyte counts, aspartate aminotransferase, C-reactive protein, and ferritin were higher in the COVID-19 moderate severity patient group. Mild severity patients spent a shorter duration hospitalized and had slightly higher percentages of abnormal CT scans and X-ray imaging. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides an understanding of the features of non-ICU COVID-19 patients in Saudi Arabia. Further national collaborative studies are needed to streamline screening and treatment procedures for COVID-19.","Al Mutair, Abbas; Alhumaid, Saad; Alhuqbani, Waad N.; Zaidi, Abdul Rehman Z.; Alkoraisi, Safug; Al-Subaie, Maha F.; AlHindi, Alanoud M.; Abogosh, Ahmed K.; Alrasheed, Aljwhara K.; Alsharafi, Aya A.; Alhuqbani, Mohammed N.; Alhowar, Njoud A.; Salih, Samer; Alhedaithy, Mogbil A.; Al-Tawfiq, Jaffar A.; Al-Shammari, Haifa; Abdulqawi, Rayid; Ismail, Alaa F.; Hamdan, Noura; Saad, Fares; Olhaye, Fahad A.; Eltahir, Tarig A.; Rabaan, Ali A.; Al-Omari, Awad",Eur J Med Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33239068/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s40001-020-00462-x,114

Hemagglutination of variant I was restricted to red blood cells of guinea pigs, whereas variant II also hemagglutinated chicken cells. The variants differed also in their ability to bind to α2,6-linked sialic acid. Evidence is presented that this difference is determined by a complex carbohydrate side chain at asparagine131 near the receptor binding site which is absent in variant II. With both variants, the arginine found at the cleavage site of all other human isolates analyzed so far was replaced by lysine.","Günther, I.; Glatthaar, B.; Döller, G.; Garten, W.",Virus Research,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0168170293900782; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/0168170293900782; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8460527/,114

Few major outbreaks of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have occurred in China after major non-pharmaceutical interventions and vaccines have been deployed and implemented. However, sporadic outbreaks that had high possibility to be linked to cold chain products were reported in several cities of China.. What is added by this report? In July 2020, a COVID-19 outbreak occurred in Dalian, China. The investigations of this outbreak strongly suggested that the infection source was from COVID-19 virus-contaminated packaging of frozen seafood during inbound unloading personnel contact. What are the implications for public health practice? Virus contaminated paper surfaces could maintain infectivity for at least 17–24 days at -25 ℃. Exposure to COVID-19 virus-contaminated surfaces is a potential route for introducing the virus to a susceptible population. Countries with no domestic transmission of COVID-19 should consider introducing prevention strategies for both inbound travellers and imported goods. Several measures to prevent the introduction of the virus via cold-chain goods can be implemented.","Ma, Huilai; Zhang, Jianqun; Wang, Ji; Qin, Ying; Chen, Cao; Song, Yang; Wang, Liang; Meng, Jun; Mao, Lingling; Li, Fengqin; Li, Ning; Cai, Jian; Zhang, Yong; Wang, Dayan; Xia, Yunting; Wang, Hong; Jiang, Shaofeng; Zhao, Xiang; Niu, Peihua; Tan, Wenjie; Ma, Tao; Yao, Yecheng; Mao, Naiying; Zhu, Zhen; Ji, Tianjiao; Yang, Qian; Huang, Baoying; Zhao, Li; Yu, Jianxing; Bai, Li; Zhu, Shuangli; Wang, Dongyan; Zhang, Yan; Sun, Yingwei; Luan, Mingchun; Wang, Yanhai; Sun, Haibo; Yang, Shihong; Bo, Zhijian; Ren, Xiang; Li, Zhongjie; Gao, George Fu; Yao, Wei; Yao, Wenqing; Feng, Zijian; Xu, Wenbo",China CDC Wkly,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34594909/; https://doi.org/10.46234/ccdcw2021.114,114

The clinical, autoimmune, and laboratory characteristics of 21 patients who had laboratory‐confirmed severe and critical cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) from the intensive care unit of the Huangshi Central Hospital, Hubei Province, China, were investigated. A total of 21 patients (13 men and 8 women), including 8 (38.1%) severe cases and 13 (61.9%) critical cases, were enrolled. Cough (90.5%) and fever (81.0%) were the dominant symptoms, and most patients (76.2%) had at least one coexisting disorder on admission. The most common characteristics on chest computed tomography were ground‐glass opacity (100%) and bilateral patchy shadowing (76.2%). The most common findings on laboratory measurement were lymphocytopenia (85.7%) and elevated levels of C‐reactive protein (94.7%) and interleukin‐6 (89.5%).

The manifestations differ somewhat between individuals, including those infected with pathogens which do not have genetic variability – suggesting host determinants. Principal components analysis (PCA) was applied to acute phase, self-report symptom data from subjects in the Dubbo Infection Outcomes Study (n = 296) to empirically derive indices of fatigue, pain, neurocognitive difficulties, and mood disturbance, as well as overall illness severity. Associations were sought with functional single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the cytokine genes, interleukin (IL)-6, tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interferon (IFN)-γ, and IL-10. The summed individual symptom indices correlated with overall severity and also with functional status. The relative contribution of individual symptom domains to the overall illness was stable over time within subjects, but varied between subjects with the same infection. The T allele of the IFN-γ +874 T/A SNP was associated with increased fatigue (p = 0.0003; OR: 3.3). The C allele of the IL-10 −592 C/A SNP exerted a protective effect on neurocognitive difficulties (p = 0.017; OR: 0.52); while the A allele for the IL-10 −592 SNP was associated with increased mood disturbance (p = 0.044; OR: 1.83), as was the G allele of the IL-6 −174 G/C SNP (p = 0.051; OR: 1.83). The acute sickness response has discrete symptom domains including fatigue, which have unique genetic associations.

Such interactions may not require any physical movement, thus aiding people with severe motor disabilities in communicating with external devices. The brain–computer interface (BCI) has turned into a field involving new elements for assistive and rehabilitative technologies. This systematic literature review (SLR) aims to help BCI investigator and investors to decide which devices to select or which studies to support based on the current market examination. This examination of noninvasive EEG devices is based on published BCI studies in different research areas. In this SLR, the research area of noninvasive BCIs using electroencephalography (EEG) was analyzed by examining the types of equipment used for assistive, adaptive, and rehabilitative BCIs. For this SLR, candidate studies were selected from the IEEE digital library, PubMed, Scopus, and ScienceDirect. The inclusion criteria (IC) were limited to studies focusing on applications and devices of the BCI technology. The data used herein were selected using IC and exclusion criteria to ensure quality assessment. The selected articles were divided into four main research areas: education, engineering, entertainment, and medicine. Overall, 238 papers were selected based on IC. Moreover, 28 companies were identified that developed wired and wireless equipment as means of BCI assistive technology. The findings of this review indicate that the implications of using BCIs for assistive, adaptive, and rehabilitative technologies are encouraging for people with severe motor disabilities and healthy people. With an increasing number of healthy people using BCIs, other research areas, such as the motivation of players when participating in games or the security of soldiers when observing certain areas, can be studied and collaborated using the BCI technology. However, such BCI systems must be simple (wearable), convenient (sensor fabrics and self-adjusting abilities), and inexpensive.","Jamil, Nuraini; Belkacem, Abdelkader Nasreddine; Ouhbi, Sofia; Lakas, Abderrahmane",Sensors (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/s21144754; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34300492/,114
602368,Letter to the Editor in Response to Buja et al. 2020,2020-08-29,"Serological assessment of SARS-CoV-2 specific responses are an essential tool for determining the prevalence of past SARS-CoV-2 infections in the population especially when testing occurs after symptoms have developed and limited contact tracing is in place. The goal of our study was to test a new 10-plex electro-chemiluminescence-based assay to measure IgM and IgG responses to the spike proteins from multiple human coronaviruses including SARS-CoV-2, assess the epitope specificity of the SARS-CoV-2 antibody response against full-length spike protein, receptor-binding domain and N-terminal domain of the spike protein, and the nucleocapsid protein. We carried out the assay on samples collected from three sample groups: subjects diagnosed with COVID-19 from the U.S. Army hospital at Camp Humphreys in Pyeongtaek, South Korea; healthcare administrators from the same hospital but with no reported diagnosis of COVID-19; and pre-pandemic samples. We found that the new CoV-specific multiplex assay was highly sensitive allowing plasma samples to be diluted 1:30,000 with a robust signal. The reactivity of IgG responses to SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein and IgM responses to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein could distinguish COVID-19 samples from non-COVID-19 and pre-pandemic samples. The data from the three sample groups also revealed a unique pattern of cross-reactivity between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV, and seasonal coronaviruses HKU1 and OC43. Our findings show that the CoV-2 IgM response is highly specific while the CoV-2 IgG response is more cross-reactive across a range of human CoVs and also showed that IgM and IgG responses show distinct patterns of epitope specificity. In summary, this multiplex assay was able to distinguish samples by COVID-19 status and characterize distinct trends in terms of cross-reactivity and fine-specificity in antibody responses, underscoring its potential value in diagnostic or serosurveillance efforts.","Chaudhury, Sidhartha; Hutter, Jack; Bolton, Jessica S.; Hakre, Shilpa; Mose, Evelyn; Wooten, Amy; O’Connell, William; Hudak, Joseph; Krebs, Shelly J.; Darden, Janice M.; Regules, Jason A.; Murray, Clinton K.; Modjarrad, Kayvon; Scott, Paul; Peel, Sheila; Bergmann-Leitner, Elke S.",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34081747/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0252628,114
603310,Individual COVID-19 disease trajectories revealed by plasma proteomics,2021,"Background The Covid-19 pandemic has led to the introduction of conservative non-operative approaches to surgical management favouring community driven care. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of these pathways on patients attending a surgical assessment unit (SAU). Method This was a retrospective observational cohort study. We included all consecutive attendances to the SAU in April 2020 (Covid-19 period) and April 2019 (pre-Covid-19). The Covid-19 period saw a shift in clinical practice towards a more conservative approach to the management of acute surgical presentations. The primary outcome measure was 30-day readmission. The secondary outcome measures were length of hospital stay, inpatient investigations undertaken and 30-day mortality. Results A total of 451 patients were included. This represented 277 and 174 attendances in pre-Covid-19, and Covid-19 groups respectively. The rates of unplanned 30-day readmission rates in the Covid-19 and pre-Covid-19 periods were 16.7% and 12.6% respectively (P=0.232). There were significantly fewer planned follow-ups in the Covid-19 (36.2%) compared to the pre-Covid-19 group (49.1%; P<0.01; OR 1.7, 95% CI 1.15-2.51). There were no significant differences in length of hospital stay (P=0.802), and 30-day mortality rate (P=0.716; OR 1.9, 95% CI 0.38-9.54) between the two periods. Conclusion There were no differences in 30-day readmission rates, length of hospital stay, and 30-day mortality with the changes to pathways. Our findings suggest the resource efficient conservative Covid-19 pathways could potentially continue long-term. However, further multi-centre studies with larger sample sizes and longer follow-up duration will be required to validate our findings.","Simone Laskar, Naomi; Hunt, Alexander; Karunaratne, Dilhara; Brooke-Ball, Hannah; Miller, Matthew T.V.",Surgeon,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1479666X20301402; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.surge.2020.08.015; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1479666X20301402?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33028491/,114

While analyzing the overall spread of the disease, clusters of countries could be identified where the population‐adjusted number of cases and mortality rates (MRs) were significantly different from the others. To draw a comparison over the countries at the same stage of infection, the nature and spread of the infection was evaluated at the 90th day of the pandemic for each country. It was observed that the countries with prevalent malarial transmission tended to have lesser population‐adjusted COVID‐19 caseloads. It was further observed that high population coverage of the Bacillus Calmette–Guérin vaccination was negatively associated with population‐adjusted caseloads and MRs due to COVID‐19. The present cross‐sectional study is an attempt to bring in several social, economic, and structural confounders into understanding of the nature and spread of this novel pandemic globally.","Goswami, Rudra Prosad; Ganguli, Bhaswati; Chatterjee, Moumita",J Med Virol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33580710/; https://doi.org/10.1002/jmv.26875,114
604410,Peripheral neuroimmune interactions: selected review and some clinical implications,2021-02-28,"A dual strategy for the electrochemical detection for 20S proteasome (20S) is proposed, based on the oriented immobilization of a capture monoclonal antibody (Abβ) on a self-assembled monolayer of 4-mercaptophenylboronic acid (4-MPBA) on gold electrodes, which led to the Au/4-MPBA/Abβ immunosensor. The methodology comprises the correlation of 20S concentration with (i) its proteolytic activity toward the Z-LLE-AMC substrate, using the Au/4-MPBA/Abβ/20S, and (ii) the enzymatic activity of an alkaline phosphatase (AlkP) from the AlkP-labeled secondary antibody (Ab(core)-AlkP), which involves the conversion of aminophenylphosphate to the electroactive aminophenol using Au/4-MPBA/Abβ/20S/Ab(core)-AlkP. The step-by-step construction of the immunosensor and the interactions at its surface were evaluated by surface plasmon resonance and gravimetric analysis with quartz crystal microbalance, showing a high affinity between both antibodies and 20S. Morphological analysis by scanning electron microscopy demonstrated a pattern of parallel lines upon immobilization of Abβ on 4-MPBA and morphological changes to a well-organized granular structure upon binding of 20S. A voltametric and impedimetric characterization was performed after each step in the immunosensor construction. The two detection strategies were evaluated. It was shown that the immunosensor responds linearly with 20S concentration in the range between 5 and 100 µg mL(−1), which corresponds to proteasome levels in serum in the case of diverse pathological situations, and LoD values of 1.4 and 0.2 µg mL(−1) were calculated for the detection strategies.

An angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) decoy that competes with endogenous ACE2 for binding of the SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor binding domain (S RBD) and inhibits infection may offer a therapeutic option with sustained efficacy against variants. Here, we used Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulation to predict ACE2 sequence substitutions that might increase its affinity for S RBD and screened candidate ACE2 decoys in vitro. The lead ACE2(T27Y/H34A)-IgG(1)F(C) fusion protein with enhanced S RBD affinity shows greater live SARS-CoV-2 virus neutralization capability than wild type ACE2. MD simulation was used to predict the effects of S RBD variant mutations on decoy affinity that was then confirmed by testing of an ACE2 Triple Decoy that included an additional enzyme activity-deactivating H374N substitution against mutated S RBD. The ACE2 Triple Decoy maintains high affinity for mutated S RBD, displays enhanced affinity for S RBD N501Y or L452R, and has the highest affinity for S RBD with both E484K and N501Y mutations, making it a viable therapeutic option for the prevention or treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection with a high likelihood of efficacy against variants.","Tanaka, Shiho; Nelson, Gard; Olson, C.

In type II systems, a trans-activating crRNA (tracrRNA) hybridizes to crRNAs to drive their processing and utilization by Cas9. While analyzing Cas9-RNA complexes from Campylobacter jejuni, we discovered tracrRNA hybridizing to cellular RNAs, leading to formation of “noncanonical” crRNAs capable of guiding DNA targeting by Cas9. Our discovery inspired the engineering of reprogrammed tracrRNAs that link the presence of any RNA of interest to DNA targeting with different Cas9 orthologs. This capability became the basis for a multiplexable diagnostic platform termed LEOPARD (leveraging engineered tracrRNAs and on-target DNAs for parallel RNA detection). LEOPARD allowed simultaneous detection of RNAs from different viruses in one test and distinguished severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and its D614G (Asp(614)→Gly) variant with single-base resolution in patient samples.","Jiao, Chunlei; Sharma, Sahil; Dugar, Gaurav; Peeck, Natalia L.; Bischler, Thorsten; Wimmer, Franziska; Yu, Yanying; Barquist, Lars; Schoen, Christoph; Kurzai, Oliver; Sharma, Cynthia M.; Beisel, Chase L.",Science,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33906967/; https://doi.org/10.1126/science.abe7106,114

608594,Distinct inflammatory profiles distinguish COVID-19 from influenza with limited contributions from cytokine storm,2020-12-09,"A weak production of INF-β along with an exacerbated release of pro-inflammatory cytokines have been reported during infection by the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus. SARS-CoV-2 encodes several proteins able to counteract the host immune system, which is believed to be one of the most important features contributing to the viral pathogenesis and development of a severe clinical picture. Previous reports have demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 N protein, along with some non-structural and accessory proteins, efficiently suppresses INF-β production by interacting with RIG-I, an important pattern recognition receptor (PRR) involved in the recognition of pathogen-derived molecules. In the present study, we better characterized the mechanism by which the SARS-CoV-2 N counteracts INF-β secretion and affects RIG-I signaling pathways. In detail, when the N protein was ectopically expressed, we noted a marked decrease in TRIM25-mediated RIG-I activation. The capability of the N protein to bind to, and probably mask, TRIM25 could be the consequence of its antagonistic activity. Furthermore, this interaction occurred at the SPRY domain of TRIM25, harboring the RNA-binding activity necessary for TRIM25 self-activation. Here, we describe new findings regarding the interplay between SARS-CoV-2 and the IFN system, filling some gaps for a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms affecting the innate immune response in COVID-19.","Gori Savellini, Gianni; Anichini, Gabriele; Gandolfo, Claudia; Cusi, Maria Grazia",Viruses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34452305/; https://doi.org/10.3390/v13081439,114
608906,Is macrophages heterogeneity important in determining COVID-19 lethality?,2020-07-03,"BACKGROUND: AVATAR therapy is a novel intervention targeting distressing auditory verbal hallucinations (henceforth ‘voices’). A digital simulation (avatar) of the voice is created and used in a three-way dialogue between participant, avatar and therapist. To date, therapy has been delivered over 6 sessions, comprising an initial phase, focusing on standing up to a hostile avatar, and a second phase in which the avatar concedes and focus shifts to individualised treatment targets, including beliefs about voices. The first fully powered randomised trial found AVATAR therapy resulted in a rapid and substantial fall in voice frequency and associated distress that was superior to supportive counselling at 12 weeks. The main objective of this AVATAR2 trial is to test the efficacy of two forms of AVATAR therapy in reducing voice-related distress: AVATAR-brief (standardised focus on exposure, assertiveness and self-esteem) and AVATAR-extended (phase 1 mirroring AVATAR-brief augmented by a formulation-driven phase 2). Secondary objectives include the examination of additional voice, wellbeing and mood outcomes, the exploration of mediators and moderators of therapy response, and examining cost-effectiveness of both forms of therapy compared with usual treatment (TAU). METHODS: This multi-site parallel group randomised controlled trial will independently randomise 345 individuals to receive AVATAR-brief (6 sessions) plus TAU or AVATAR-extended (12 sessions) plus TAU or TAU alone (1:1:1 allocation). Participants will be people with a diagnosis of schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders who have heard distressing voices for more than 6 months. The primary outcome is the PSYRATS Auditory Hallucinations Distress dimension score at 16 and 28 weeks, conducted by blinded assessors. Statistical analysis will follow the intention-to-treat principle and data will be analysed using linear mixed models. Mediation and moderation analyses using contemporary causal inference methods will be conducted as secondary analyses. Service costs will be calculated, and cost-effectiveness assessed in terms of quality-adjusted life years accrued. DISCUSSION: This study will clarify optimal therapy delivery, test efficacy in a multi-site study and enable the testing of the AVATAR software platform, therapy training and provision in NHS settings.

Current data indicates that viral RNA levels in maternal blood are low and there is no evidence of placental infection with SARS-CoV-2. Published reports to date suggest that perinatal transmission of SARSCoV- 2 can occur but is rare. Among 179 newborns tested for SARS-CoV2 at birth from mothers with COVID-19, transmission was suspected in 8 cases, 5 with positive nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR and 3 with SARS-CoV-2 IgM. However, these cases arise from maternal infection close to childbirth and there are no information about exposition during first or second trimester of pregnancy. Welldesigned prospective cohort studies with rigorous judgement criteria are needed to determine the incidence and risk factors for perinatal transmission of SARS-CoV-2.","Egloff, Charles; Vauloup-Fellous, Christelle; Picone, Olivier; Mandelbrot, Laurent; Roques, Pierre",J Clin Virol,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S138665322030189X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2020.104447; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32425663/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S138665322030189X?v=s5,114

ECMO has been associated with development of lymphocytopenia that is also common in COVID-19. Hyperinflammation may complicate SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, prompting therapy with steroids and immunomodulatory drugs. We aimed to evaluate the association of therapies such as steroids and Tocilizumab with trajectories of the total leukocytes, lymphocyte subpopulation count, and inflammatory and fibrinolysis markers in COVID-19-related ARDS, requiring or not VV-ECMO support. The association of the trajectories of the leukocytes, lymphocyte subpopulation count, and inflammatory and fibrinolysis markers with treatment with steroids (Steroids), Tocilizumab (Tocilizumab), both drugs (Steroids + Tocilizumab), and absence of treatment (No Treatment) were analyzed using mixed effects regression models, where ECMO was considered as a potential effect modifier. One hundred and thirty-nine leukocyte and eighty-one lymphocyte subpopulation counts were obtained from thirty-one patients who required (VV-ECMO, N = 13) or not (no VV-ECMO, N = 18) extracorporeal support. In both groups, treatment with Steroids + Tocilizumab was independently associated with a significant reduction of 46% and 67% in total lymphocytes, 22% and 60% in CD3(+), and 61% and 91% in CD19(+) (B lymphocytes) compared to those obtained without treatment, respectively. In the no VV-ECMO group, Tocilizumab was associated with a 79% increase in total lymphocytes and with a reduction in procalcitonin compared to no treatment. CD45(+), CD3(+)CD4(+) (Th cell), CD3(+)CD8(+), CD4(+)/CD8(+), the NK cell subpopulation, neutrophils, monocytes, and basophils were significantly reduced by Steroids + Tocilizumab without an effect modification by VV-ECMO support. In critically ill COVID-19 patients with ARDS, concomitant therapies with steroids and Tocilizumab, beside mitigating the inflammation and fibrinolysis, could reduce the total leukocyte, lymphocyte, and subpopulation count. Moreover, the effect of Tocilizumab in increasing the total lymphocytes and reducing procalcitonin might be blunted by VV-ECMO.","Fanelli, Vito; Montrucchio, Giorgia; Sales, Gabriele; Simonetti, Umberto; Bonetto, Chiara; Rumbolo, Francesca; Mengozzi, Giulio; Urbino, Rosario; Pizzi, Costanza; Richiardi, Lorenzo; Cappello, Paola; Brazzi, Luca",Membranes (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/membranes11080603; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34436366/,114

In their first years of life children are receptive to obstructive airway diseases. The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of redecoration of the apartment on airway symptoms in infants during the first two years of life. The Leipzig Allergy Risk Children Study (LARS) is a birth cohort study with the following inclusion criteria: double positive family atopy anamnesis, cord blood IgE>0.9 kU/l, or low birth weight between 1500 – 2500 g. Within the context of LARS, 186 parents of risk children completed a questionnaire on the respiratory symptoms of their children and the redecoration of their apartment at the end of the first and second year of life. A total 22% of the children suffered from obstructive bronchitis once or more during their first year, and 11% experienced this condition during their second year of life. Redecoration of the apartment had a significant influence on the appearance of obstructive bronchitis in the first (OR 4.1 95%CI 1.4 – 11.9) and in the second year of life (OR 4.2 95%CI 1.4 – 12.9). (The OR are adjusted for cord blood-IgE >0.9 kU/l, birth weight ≤2500 g, male sex and double positive parental atopy anamnesis, dampness, smoking or pet in the apartment). Simultaneous contamination from redecoration activities and additional exposures such as smoking, a pet or dampness in the apartment increased the risk for obstructive bronchitis in the first year (OR 9.1; 95% CI 2.3 – 34.8) as well as in the second year (OR 5.1; 95%CI 1.6 – 15.6). Our data suggest that redecoration of the apartment is associated with the development of acute inflammations, but not with a chronic influence on the airways in atopy risk infants. At an exposure to more than one environmental factor, pronounced effects were seen.","Diez, Ulrike; Rehwagen, Martina; Rolle-Kampczyk, Ulrike; Wetzig, Heide; Schulz, Rita; Richter, Matthias; Lehmann, Irina; Borte, Michael; Herbarth, Olf",International Journal of Hygiene and Environmental Health,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1438463904702072; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1438463904702072; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12872525/,114
611393,"Multidomain Intervention for Reversal of Cognitive Frailty, Towards a Personalized Approach (AGELESS Trial): Study Design",2021-07-21,"Membrane-bound peptidases play important roles in the regulation of local concentrations of various signalling peptides such as the growth factors, hormones, chemokines and cytokines. That is accomplished by means of their enzyme activity. Recently, membrane-bound peptidases have also been shown to act as receptors, receiving signals from as yet undefined ligands and transducing them into the cell interior. By using either or both of these mechanisms, peptidases interact with fundamental cellular functions: growth, differentiation, activation and death. This study addressed the effects of a T-cell derived cytokine, interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) on the activity of aminopeptidase N (APN), an ectoenzyme processing several signal peptides. Cells of a myelo-monocytic cell line HL-60 were used as a model system, and APN was assayed at the levels of mRNA, its membrane marker CD13, and the enzyme activity. Regulation of CD13/APN by IFN-γ was found at all three levels. The direction of regulation was time-dependent: an initial down-regulation seen 24 and 48 hrs after the onset of treatment with IFN-γ was replaced by an up-regulation after 72 and/or 96 hrs. Up-regulation of CD13/APN observed after 96 hrs was preceded by an up-regulation of APN mRNA reaching its maximum after 72 hrs. The IFN-γ-induced regulation of APN was due to membrane aminopeptidase N, since it could be completely abrogated by an APN blocking antibody WM-15. The delayed up-regulation of CD13/APN (observed after 72 and/or 96 hrs), required de novo protein synthesis as it could be abrogated by cycloheximide, an inhibitor of protein synthesis. Possible role of endogenous (IFN-γ-induced) TGF-β in mediating CD13/APN up-regulation could be excluded, since no TGF-β was found in supernatants of IFN-γ treated HL-60 cells. Thus, our data show regulation of CD13/APN on cells of myelo-monocytic origin by a T-cell derived cytokine, IFN-γ. A similar mechanism might play a role in inflammation.","Gabrilovac, Jelka; Breljak, Davorka; Čupić, Barbara; Ambriović-Ristov, Andreja",Life Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15792835/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0024320505000664; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0024320505000664,114

Here, we demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 infection of human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) and dendritic cells (MDDCs) was abortive, but induced the production of multiple antiviral and pro-inflammatory cytokines (IFN-α, IFN-β, TNF, IL-1β, IL-6 and IL-10) and a chemokine (CXCL10). Despite the lack of efficient replication in MDMs, SARS-CoV-2 induced profound IFN-mediated cell death of host cells. Macrophage activation and death was not enhanced by exposure to low levels of convalescent plasma, suggesting that antibody-dependent enhancement of infection does not contribute to cell death.

Up to March 11, 2020, 2019-nCov thoroughly broke out in Italy with over 10,000 confirmed cases notwithstanding the gradually block of the country since March 9, 2020. Estimation of possible infection population and prospective suggestion of handling spread based on exist data are of crucial importance. Considering of the biology parameters obtained based on Chinese clinical data in Wuhan, other scholars' work and real spread feature of 2019-nCov in Italy, we built a more applicable model called SEIJR with log-normal distributed time delay to forecast the trend of spreading. Adopting Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), we estimated the early period average spreading velocity (0) and conducted inversion analysis of time point (T0) when the virus first hit the Italy. Based on fixed 0 and T0, we then obtained the average spreading velocity 1 after the lock by PSO. For the aim of offering expeditious advice, we generated the prediction trends with different which we considered would be helpful in addressing the infection. Not only solved the complex, nondifferentiable equation of epidemic model, our research also performs well in inversion analysis based on PSO which conveys informative outcomes for further discussion on precatious action.

It is thus necessary to promote PPE rational use, highlighting possible differences in terms of efficacy among them and promoting an effective technique to reuse them. Methods A literature search was performed on PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane database, and Google Scholar and from 25 top cited papers, 15 were selected for relevance and impact. Results Most studies on prior respiratory virus epidemic to date suggest surgical masks not to be inferior compared with N95 respirators in terms of protective efficacy among health care workers. The use of N95 respirators should be then limited in favor of high-risk situations. Concerning respirators reuse, highly energetic short-wave ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI) at 254 nm was proficiently applied to determine N95 respirators decontamination from viral respiratory agents, but it requires careful consideration of the type of respirator and of the biological target. Conclusions Rational use and successful reuse of respirators can help facing PPE shortening during a pandemic. Further evidences testing UVGI and other decontamination techniques are an unmet need. The definitive answer to pandemic issues can be found in artificial intelligence and deep learning: these groundbreaking modalities could help in identifying high-risk patients and in suggesting appropriate types and use of PPE.","Boškoski, Ivo; Gallo, Camilla; Wallace, Michael B.; Costamagna, Guido",Gastrointest Endosc,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32353457/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gie.2020.04.048; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016510720342474?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0016510720342474,114

The aim of this study was to assess the impact of COVID‐19‐related public health measures on orthopaedic presentations to a regional Australian hospital. METHODS: A case–control study was performed at a regional trauma hospital in New South Wales (NSW), Australia. Data was collected prospectively from patients that required orthopaedic review in the period corresponding to a declaration of a global pandemic to the end of the NSW lockdown, and compared with retrospective data from the corresponding period in 2019. The five‐year average of orthopaedic presentations to ED during the study period were obtained for comparison. The primary outcomes were overall number of presentations, mechanism and anatomical location of injuries, operative versus non‐operative management and disposition. RESULTS: During the study period in 2020, presentations requiring orthopaedic review were significantly more frequent than 2019 (496 vs. 280, p < 0.0001), with more requiring admission in 2020 (p < 0.0001). The absolute number of patients managed operatively was higher (p = 0.0002) and significantly more patients were referred for community follow‐up (p < 0.0001).

Aim: To evaluate the association between IgE sensitization and viral infection in wheezing children. Methods: This is an observational study in hospitalized wheezing children (n = 247; median age 1.6 ; interquartile range 1.1, 2.9). Eighteen respiratory viral infections were studied using all available methods. A specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) sensitization for common food and aeroallergens and other atopy‐related variables including total IgE, blood and nasal eosinophils, exhaled nitric oxide, eczema and atopic eczema, parental allergy and asthma, number of wheezing episodes, positive asthma predictive index or asthma and use of inhaled corticosteroid were correlated with specific viral etiology. Results: Atopy was closely associated with sole rhinovirus etiology (n = 58) but not with sole respiratory syncytial virus, sole enterovirus, sole human bocavirus, sole other virus, mixed viral, or virus negative etiology. The number of sensitizations was particularly associated with sole rhinovirus etiology (odds ratio 4.59; 95% confidence interval 1.78, 11.8; adjusted to age and sex), followed by aeroallergen sensitization (respectively; 4.18; 2.00, 8.72), total IgE level (2.06; 1.32, 3.21), food allergen sensitization (2.02; 1.08, 3.78), and nasal eosinophil count (1.52; 1.08, 2.13). Conclusions: According to our data, allergic sensitization is positively linked to rhinovirus‐, but not other virus‐, associated wheezing and calls attention for studies to test rhinovirus‐associated wheezing as a part of asthma risk indices.","Jartti, T.; Kuusipalo, H.; Vuorinen, T.; Söderlund‐Venermo, M.; Allander, T.; Waris, M.; Hartiala, J.; Ruuskanen, O.",Pediatr Allergy Immunol,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1399-3038.2010.01059.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20977499/,114

A better understanding of the pathophysiology associated with COVID-19 is crucial to improve treatment modalities and to develop effective prevention strategies. Transcriptomic and proteomic data on the host response against SARS-CoV-2 still have anecdotic character; currently available data from other coronavirus infections are therefore a key source of information. MethodsWe investigated selected molecular aspects of three human coronavirus (HCoV) infections, namely SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and HCoV-229E, through a network based-approach. A functional analysis of HCoV-host interactome was carried out in order to provide a theoretic host-pathogen interaction model for HCoV infections and in order to translate the results in prediction for SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis. The 3D model of S-glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 was compared to the structure of the corresponding SARS-CoV, HCoV-229E and MERS-CoV S-glycoprotein. SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, HCoV-229E and the host interactome were inferred through published protein-protein interactions (PPI) as well as gene co-expression, triggered by HCoV S-glycoprotein in host cells. ResultsAlthough the amino acid sequences of the S-glycoprotein were found to be different between the various HCoV, the structures showed high similarity, but the best 3D structural overlap shared by SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, consistent with the shared ACE2 predicted receptor. The host interactome, linked to the S-glycoprotein of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, mainly highlighted innate immunity pathway components, such as Toll Like receptors, cytokines and chemokines. ConclusionsIn this paper, we developed a network-based model with the aim to define molecular aspects of pathogenic phenotypes in HCoV infections. The resulting pattern may facilitate the process of structure-guided pharmaceutical and diagnostic research with the prospect to identify potential new biological targets.","Messina, Francesco; Giombini, Emanuela; Agrati, Chiara; Vairo, Francesco; Bartoli, Tommaso Ascoli; Moghazi, Samir Al; Piancentini, Mauro; Maeurer, Markus; Zumla, Alimuddin; Capobianchi, Maria R.; Lauria, Francesco Nicola; Ippolito, Giuseppe",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.07.082487,114

Here, we investigate awareness of infection and symptoms in relation to antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in healthy plasma donors. We ask individuals donating plasma across the Netherlands between May 11th and 18th 2020 to report COVID-19 related symptoms and we test for antibodies indicative of a past infection with SARS-CoV-2. Among 3,676 with antibody and questionnaire data 239 (6.5%) are positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Of those, 48% suspect no COVID-19 despite the majority reporting symptoms. 11% of seropositive individuals report no, and 27% very mild symptoms at any time during the first peak of the epidemic. Anosmia/ageusia and fever are most strongly associated with seropositivity. Almost half of seropositive individuals do not suspect SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Previously, we developed pseudovirus poliovirus (PV) neutralization test (pPNT) with type 1, 2, and 3 PV pseudovirus (PV(pv)), which possess a luciferase-encoding PV replicon in the capsids of wild-type strains (PV(pv)[WT]), showing that pPNT with type 2 and 3 PV(pv)(WT) but not type 1 shows high correlation with the conventional PV neutralization test (cPNT) performed with vaccine strains. Here, we analyse the antigenicity of PV(pv)(WT) and PV(pv) with capsid proteins of Sabin vaccine strains (PV(pv)[Sabin]) in human serum. Type 2 and 3 PV(pv)(WT) and PV(pv)(Sabin) show similar antigenicity in the analysed set of human sera in contrast to type 1 PV(pv). The levels of PV(pv)(Sabin) infection (%), including about 70% of PV(pv) infection (%) measured in the presence of human serum diluted to the cPNT titre, serve as the optimal threshold values for pPNT (5% for type 1 and 2, 10% for type 3) to show high correlation with cPNT results. Our results suggest that pPNT with PV(pv)(Sabin) could serve as an alternative to cPNT and provide a rationale for pPNT threshold values.","Arita, Minetaro; Iwai-Itamochi, Masae",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31427704/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-48534-1,114

The aim of this systematic review was to compare immunogenicity and protective efficacy of various SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidates tested in non-human primate (NHP) models. METHODS: Literature on effect of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in NHP models reported on PubMed and preprint platforms (medRxiv and bioRxiv) till October 22, 2020, was searched with the following terms: coronavirus vaccine, COVID-19 vaccine, SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, nonhuman primate, and rhesus macaque. RESULTS: Our search yielded 19 studies, which reported immune response elicited by 18 vaccine candidates in NHP. All the vaccines induced detectable neutralizing antibody (NAb) titres in the serum of vaccinated animals, with some showing effective viral clearance from various organs. The vaccinated animals also showed nil to mild histopathological changes in their lungs compared to placebo groups in the trials that performed necropsy. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSIONS: Our findings highlighted onset of quick immunogenicity and protective efficacy of mRNA-1273, followed by Ad26.CoV2.S, NVX-CoV2373, BNT162b2, RBD and BBV152 vaccine candidates in preclinical trials as compared to the others.

623639,Role of Iron Chelation and Protease Inhibition of Natural Products on COVID-19 Infection,2021-05-25,"BACKGROUND: Primary pericardial mesothelioma (PPM) is a rare malignancy with a high prevalence of mortality. The diagnosis is usually challenging using a variety of imaging modalities and invasive procedures and is generally performed at the later stages of the disease or in autopsy. This case study points to an unconventional presentation of PPM and the challenges in diagnosing this rare mortal malignancy. CASE PRESENTATION: This study presents a 44-year-old woman with no remarkable medical history with an initial diagnosis of effusive constrictive pericarditis at first hospitalization. Imaging evaluations, including transthoracic echocardiography and chest computed tomography scan, demonstrated visible thickened pericardium, pericardial effusion, and mass-like lesions in pericardium and mediastinum. The definite diagnosis of primary pericardial mesothelioma was established after pericardiectomy and histopathology examinations. Chemotherapy with pemetrexed and carboplatin was administrated to the patient, and she has been through four cycles of chemotherapy with no complications to date. CONCLUSION: Constrictive pericarditis is an uncommon presentation of PPM. Due to the high mortality rate and late presentation, difficulties and uncertainties in diagnosis, being aware of this rare malignant entity in different cardiac manifestations, particularly when there is no clear explanation or response to treatment in such conditions, is highly important.

In addition, many patients receiving antithrombotic therapy for thrombotic disease may develop COVID-19, which can have implications for choice, dosing, and laboratory monitoring of antithrombotic therapy. Moreover, during a time with much focus on COVID-19, it is critical to consider how to optimize the available technology to care for patients without COVID-19 who have thrombotic disease. Herein, we review the current understanding of the pathogenesis, epidemiology, management and outcomes of patients with COVID-19 who develop venous or arterial thrombosis, and of those with preexisting thrombotic disease who develop COVID-19, or those who need prevention or care for their thrombotic disease during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Bikdeli, Behnood; Madhavan, Mahesh V.; Jimenez, David; Chuich, Taylor; Dreyfus, Isaac; Driggin, Elissa; Nigoghossian, Caroline Der; Ageno, Walter; Madjid, Mohammad; Guo, Yutao; Tang, Liang V.; Hu, Yu; Giri, Jay; Cushman, Mary; Quéré, Isabelle; Dimakakos, Evangelos P.; Gibson, C.

Here, we show that at non-cytotoxic concentrations, these small molecules accelerate the deaths of non-cancerous cells infected with influenza A virus (IAV) or other viruses. In particular, we demonstrate that ABT-263 altered Bcl-xL interactions with Bcl-2 antagonist of cell death (Bad), Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax), uveal autoantigen with coiled-coil domains and ankyrin repeats protein (UACA). ABT-263 thereby activated the caspase-9-mediated mitochondria-initiated apoptosis pathway, which, together with the IAV-initiated caspase-8-mediated apoptosis pathway, triggered the deaths of IAV-infected cells. Our results also indicate that Bcl-xL, Bcl-2 and Bcl-w interact with pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) that sense virus constituents to regulate cellular apoptosis. Importantly, premature killing of IAV-infected cells by ABT-263 attenuated the production of key pro-inflammatory and antiviral cytokines. The imbalance in cytokine production was also observed in ABT-263-treated IAV-infected mice, which resulted in an inability of the immune system to clear the virus and eventually lowered the survival rates of infected animals. Thus, the results suggest that the chemical inhibition of Bcl-xL, Bcl-2 and Bcl-w could potentially be hazardous for cancer patients with viral infections.","Kakkola, L; Denisova, O V; Tynell, J; Viiliäinen, J; Ysenbaert, T; Matos, R C; Nagaraj, A; Öhman, T; Kuivanen, S; Paavilainen, H; Feng, L; Yadav, B; Julkunen, I; Vapalahti, O; Hukkanen, V; Stenman, J; Aittokallio, T; Verschuren, E W; Ojala, P M; Nyman, T; Saelens, X; Dzeyk, K; Kainov, D E",Cell Death Dis,https://doi.org/10.1038/cddis.2013.267; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23887633/,114

The main purpose of this article is to discuss the challenges of COVID-19 management in Asian LMICs and propose some future guidelines to control the transmission and spread. Due to a highly dense population, low-resourced health system, lack of testing kit, and tracing, the ultimate impact could be lasting. It is highly likely that Asian LMICs were not in the center of receiving high priority by the international community in order to take effective prevention strategies. This might upsurge caseloads. Like the symptoms, mode of transmission varies largely due to a number of unknown clinical features of the virus, defining a risk group only based on some limited criteria such as age and disease with comorbidity could be risky. Recently some of the Asian LMICs launched contact tracing app. However, the study has identified several healthcare challenges in Asian LMICs such as shortage of supply of PPE, inadequate long-term care services, the socio-cultural differences which require utmost consideration. In addition, to control infection and enhance prevention, some pertinent problems need to be addressed. Based on that, some multifactorial approaches can be taken in line with international guidelines. Finally, this paper recommends developing a strong and resilient healthcare monitoring system.","Jahan, Yasmin; Rahman, Atiqur",,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2666449620300141; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666449620300141?v=s5,114

DESIGN: We followed the Cochrane criteria and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta‐Analysis guidelines for this systematic review and meta‐analysis. DATA SOURCES: PubMed, Scopus, ProQuest, Cochrane COVID‐19 registry, CINAHL and pre‐print services (medRχiv and PsyArXiv) were searched from January 1 to November 15, 2020 and we removed duplicates. REVIEW METHODS: We applied a random effect model to estimate pooled effects since the heterogeneity between results was very high. RESULTS: Sixteen studies, including 18,935 nurses met the inclusion criteria. The overall prevalence of emotional exhaustion was 34.1%, of depersonalization was 12.6% and of lack of personal accomplishment was 15.2%. The main risk factors that increased nurses' burnout were the following: younger age, decreased social support, low family and colleagues readiness to cope with COVID‐19 outbreak, increased perceived threat of Covid‐19, longer working time in quarantine areas, working in a high‐risk environment, working in hospitals with inadequate and insufficient material and human resources, increased workload and lower level of specialized training regarding COVID‐19. CONCLUSION: Nurses experience high levels of burnout during the COVID‐19 pandemic, while several sociodemographic, social and occupational factors affect this burnout. IMPACT: We found that burnout among nurses is a crucial issue during the COVID‐19 pandemic. There is an urgent need to prepare nurses to cope better with COVID‐19 pandemic. Identification of risk factors for burnout could be a significant weapon giving nurses and health care systems the ability to response in a better way against the following COVID‐19 waves in the near future.","Galanis, Petros; Vraka, Irene; Fragkou, Despoina; Bilali, Angeliki; Kaitelidou, Daphne",J Adv Nurs,https://doi.org/10.1111/jan.14839; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33764561/,114

The aim of this study is to study the prevalence of dysgeusia and anosmia in COVID-19 patients treated at the University of Florida Health Center and establish the odds of having an olfactory and gustatory disorder with a confirmed COVID-19 infection. METHODS: This is a retrospective cross-sectional study utilizing the University of Florida Health Center patients’ registry i2b2 platform to search for ICD 10 diagnoses of COVID-19 infection and taste and smell disturbances. We assessed the odds ratio for patients with dysgeusia and anosmia having a laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection using a logistic regression model adjusting for gender, race, age, and comorbidity conditions. P < 0.05 was deemed significant. RESULTS: Out of 889 individuals that tested positive for COVID-19, 12.88% were diagnosed with taste and smell disturbances. The odds ratio for COVID-19 for people with dysgeusia and anosmia was 39.107. After adjusting for sex, age, and race, it was 41.9, 37, and 34.2, respectively. CONCLUSION: Taste and smell disturbances in COVID-19 are not anecdotal. It is paramount that oral and maxillofacial surgeons include taste and smell disturbances in the history and physical examination as these symptoms are suspicious of active COVID-19 infection. Patients presenting with an olfactory and gustatory disorder should undergo further evaluations for COVID-19 infection and oral and maxillofacial surgeons should enhance the personal protective equipment used when treating these patients to prevent further spread of the infection and protect other healthcare members.","Alharbi, Hamad; You, Sijia; Katz, Joseph",Oral Maxillofac Surg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33954852/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s10006-021-00965-9,114

CRISPR-Cas nucleases offer programmable RNA-guided RNA recognition that triggers cleavage and release of a fluorescent reporter molecule, but long reaction times hamper their detection sensitivity and speed. Here, we show that unrelated CRISPR nucleases can be deployed in tandem to provide both direct RNA sensing and rapid signal generation, thus enabling robust detection of ~30 molecules per µl of RNA in 20 min. Combining RNA-guided Cas13 and Csm6 with a chemically stabilized activator creates a one-step assay that can detect severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA extracted from respiratory swab samples with quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR)-derived cycle threshold (Ct) values up to 33, using a compact detector.

Recently, dysbiosis of gut microbiome in PD was identified: altered abundances of three microbial clusters were found, one of which was composed of opportunistic pathogens. Using two large datasets, we found evidence that the overabundance of opportunistic pathogens in PD gut is influenced by the host genotype at the alpha-synuclein locus, and that the variants responsible modulate alpha-synuclein expression. Results put forth testable hypotheses on the role of gut microbiome in the pathogenesis of PD, the incomplete penetrance of PD susceptibility genes, and potential triggers of pathology in the gut.","Wallen, Zachary D; Stone, William J; Factor, Stewart A; Molho, Eric; Zabetian, Cyrus P; Standaert, David G; Payami, Haydeh",NPJ Parkinson's disease,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34408160/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41531-021-00218-2,114

We specifically chose CART to examine neural mechanism(s) underlying photoperiod-induced responses, since it is a potent anorectic neuropeptide and involved in the regulation of changes in the body mass and reproduction in mammals. We first studied the distribution of CART-immunoreactivity in the hypothalamus of migratory redheaded buntings (Emberiza bruniceps). CART-immunoreactive neurons were found extensively distributed in the preoptic, lateral hypothalamic (LHN), anterior hypothalamic (AN), suprachiasmatic (SCN), paraventricular (PVN), dorsomedialis hypothalami (DMN), inferior hypothalamic (IH), and infundibular (IN) nuclei. Then, we correlated hypothalamic CART-immunoreactivity in buntings with photostimulated seasonal states, particularly winter non-migratory/non-breeding (NMB) state under short days, and spring premigratory/pre-breeding (PMB) and migratory/breeding (MB) states under long days. There were significantly increased CART-immunoreactive cells, and percent fluorescent area of CART-immunoreactivity was significantly increased in all mapped hypothalamic areas, except the SCN, PVN, AN, and DMN in photostimulated PMB and MB states, as compared to the non-stimulated NMB state. In particular, CART was richly expressed in the medial preoptic nucleus, LHN, IH and IN during MB state in which buntings showed reduced food intake and increased night-time activity. These results suggest that changes in the activity of the CART-containing system in different brain regions were associated with heightened energy needs of the photoperiod-induced seasonal responses during spring migration and reproduction in migratory songbirds.","Singh, Omprakash; Agarwal, Neha; Yadav, Anupama; Basu, Sumela; Malik, Shalie; Rani, Sangeeta; Kumar, Vinod; Singru, Praful S.",Brain Struct Funct,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00429-020-02154-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33141294/,114
628383,Quantitative and semi-quantitative CT assessments of lung lesion burden in COVID-19 pneumonia,2021-03-04,"Mannose binding lectin (MBL) generally plays a protective role during viral infection, yet MBL-mediated complement activation promotes Ross River virus (RRV)-induced inflammatory tissue destruction, contributing to arthritis and myositis. As MBL binds to carbohydrates, we hypothesized that N-linked glycans on the RRV envelope glycoproteins act as ligands for MBL. Using a panel of RRV mutants lacking the envelope N-linked glycans, we found that MBL deposition onto infected cells was dependent on the E2 glycans. Moreover, the glycan-deficient viruses exhibited reduced disease and tissue damage in a mouse model of RRV-induced myositis compared to wild-type RRV, despite similar viral load and inflammatory infiltrates within the skeletal muscle. Instead, the reduced disease induced by glycan-deficient viruses was linked to decreased MBL deposition and complement activation within inflamed tissues. These results demonstrate that the viral N-linked glycans promote MBL deposition and complement activation onto RRV-infected cells, contributing to the development of RRV-induced myositis.","Gunn, Bronwyn M.; Jones, Jennifer E.; Shabman, Reed S.; Whitmore, Alan C.; Sarkar, Sanjay; Blevins, Lance K.; Morrison, Thomas E.; Heise, Mark T.",Virology,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682217304336; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682217304336; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2017.12.022; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29324290/,114

628597,Lessons from dermatology about inflammatory responses in Covid‐19,2020-07-12,"Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) strain H120 was successfully rescued as infectious clone by reverse genetics. Thirteen 1.5–2.8 kb fragments contiguously spanning the virus genome were amplified and cloned into pMD19-T. Transcription grade complete length cDNA was acquired by a modified “No See’m” ligation strategy, which employed restriction enzyme Bsa I and BsmB I and ligated more than two fragments in one T4 ligase reaction. The full-length genomic cDNA was transcribed and its transcript was transfected by electroporation into BHK-21 together with the transcript of nucleocapsid gene. At 48 h post transfection, the medium to culture the transfected BHK-21 cells was harvested and inoculated into 10-days old SPF embryonated chicken eggs (ECE) to replicate the rescued virus. After passage of the virus in ECE five times, the rescued H120 virus (R-H120) was successfully recovered. R-H120 was subsequently identified to possess the introduced silent mutation site in its genome. Some biological characteristics of R-H120 such as growth curve, EID50 and HA titers, were tested and all of them were very similar to its parent strain H120. In addition, both R-H120 and H120 induced a comparable titer of HA inhibition (HI) antibody in immunized chickens and also provided up to 85% of immune protection to the chickens that were challenged with Mass41 IBV strain. The present study demonstrated that construction of infectious clone from IBV vaccine strain H120 is possible and IBV-H120 can be use as a vaccine vector for the development of novel vaccines through molecular recombination and the modified reverse genetics approach.","Zhou, Ying Shun; Zhang, Yi; Wang, Hong Ning; Fan, Wen Qiao; Yang, Xin; Zhang, An Yun; Zeng, Fan Ya; Zhang, Zhi Kun; Cao, Hai Peng; Zeng, Cheng",Vet Microbiol,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2012.08.013; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378113512004646; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378113512004646; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22999521/,114

To obtain information useful to contribute towards the planning of service delivery. METHODS: Analysis of England’s Hospital Episode Statistics from the Health and Social Care Information Centre and population data from the United Kingdom’s Office for National Statistics. RESULTS: Episodes of ‘retinal detachments with breaks’ increased year on year from 3447 (7.0/100 M) in 2000 to 10,971 (19.7/100 M) in 2018 (p < 0.001), whereas records of ‘tractional retinal detachment’ increased from 290 (0.6/100 M) to 910 (1.6/100 M) in the same period (p < 0.0001). The number of reported pars plana vitrectomies irrespective of indication increased over fourfold from 5761 to 26,900 (p < 0.0001), while the number of scleral buckling records decreased by two thirds from 2897 to 780 (p < 0.0001). During the same period, the population of England increased from 49.2 to 55.6 million, proportionally at a slower rate than that for recorded hospital episodes. CONCLUSIONS: The frequency of admissions to hospital for surgically treated retinal detachment seems to have been increasing significantly since 2000. This effect is more marked in cases of rhegmatogenous retinal detachment. This may be explained by increased incidence of disease (due to increased rates of cataract surgery, increasing longevity and increasing rates of myopia) as well as repeat surgery in cases of recurrent retinal detachment. Other factors which may play a role include improvements in patient access, increased public awareness and improved local coding and reporting practice.","Madi, Haifa A.; Keller, Johannes",Eye (Lond),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34290443/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41433-021-01647-2,114

The clinical covariates and the laboratory tests performed on a patient provide robust statistics to guide clinical treatment. Deep learning approaches on a data set of this nature enable patient stratification and provide methods to guide clinical treatment. OBJECTIVE: Here, we report on the development and prospective validation of a state-of-the-art machine learning model to provide mortality prediction shortly after confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the Mayo Clinic patient population. METHODS: We retrospectively constructed one of the largest reported and most geographically diverse laboratory information system and electronic health record of COVID-19 data sets in the published literature, which included 11,807 patients residing in 41 states of the United States of America and treated at medical sites across 5 states in 3 time zones. Traditional machine learning models were evaluated independently as well as in a stacked learner approach by using AutoGluon, and various recurrent neural network architectures were considered. The traditional machine learning models were implemented using the AutoGluon-Tabular framework, whereas the recurrent neural networks utilized the TensorFlow Keras framework. We trained these models to operate solely using routine laboratory measurements and clinical covariates available within 72 hours of a patient's first positive COVID-19 nucleic acid test result. RESULTS: The GRU-D recurrent neural network achieved peak cross-validation performance with 0.938 (SE 0.004) as the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve. This model retained strong performance by reducing the follow-up time to 12 hours (0.916 [SE 0.005] AUROC), and the leave-one-out feature importance analysis indicated that the most independently valuable features were age, Charlson comorbidity index, minimum oxygen saturation, fibrinogen level, and serum iron level. In the prospective testing cohort, this model provided an AUROC of 0.901 and a statistically significant difference in survival (P<.001, hazard ratio for those predicted to survive, 95% CI 0.043-0.106). CONCLUSIONS: Our deep learning approach using GRU-D provides an alert system to flag mortality for COVID-19-positive patients by using clinical covariates and laboratory values within a 72-hour window after the first positive nucleic acid test result.","Sankaranarayanan, Saranya; Balan, Jagadheshwar; Walsh, Jesse R; Wu, Yanhong; Minnich, Sara; Piazza, Amy; Osborne, Collin; Oliver, Gavin R; Lesko, Jessica; Bates, Kathy L; Khezeli, Kia; Block, Darci R; DiGuardo, Margaret; Kreuter, Justin; O'Horo, John C; Kalantari, John; Klee, Eric W; Salama, Mohamed E; Kipp, Benjamin; Morice, William G; Jenkinson, Garrett",J Med Internet Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34449401/; https://doi.org/10.2196/30157,114

The varying trajectories of the COVID-19 pandemic in different countries afford the opportunity to assess the unique influence of ‘macro-level’ environmental factors and ‘micro-level’ psychological variables on both fear and perceived health. Here, we investigate predictors of fear and perceived health using machine learning as lockdown restrictions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic were introduced in Austria, Spain, Poland and Czech Republic. Over a seven-week period, 533 participants completed weekly self-report surveys which measured the target variables subjective fear of the virus and perceived health, in addition to potential predictive variables related to psychological factors, social factors, perceived vulnerability to disease (PVD), and economic circumstances. Viral spread, mortality and governmental responses were further included in the analysis as potential environmental predictors. Results revealed that our models could accurately predict fear of the virus (accounting for approximately 23% of the variance) using predictive factors such as worrying about shortages in food supplies and perceived vulnerability to disease (PVD), where interestingly, environmental factors such as spread of the virus and governmental restrictions did not contribute to this prediction. Furthermore, our results revealed that perceived health could be predicted using PVD, physical exercise, attachment anxiety and age as input features, albeit with smaller effect sizes. Taken together, our results emphasize the importance of ‘micro-level’ psychological factors, as opposed to ‘macro-level’ environmental factors, when predicting fear and perceived health, and offer a starting point for more extensive research on the influences of pathogen threat and governmental restrictions on the psychology of fear and health.","Eder, Stephanie Josephine; Steyrl, David; Stefanczyk, Michal Mikolaj; Pieniak, Michał; Martínez Molina, Judit; Pešout, Ondra; Binter, Jakub; Smela, Patrick; Scharnowski, Frank; Nicholson, Andrew A.",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33705439/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0247997,114

This knowledge is used in immune repertoire mining, where known binders are used to search bulk sequencing repertoires to identify new binders. However, current computational methods cannot identify epitope convergence between antibodies from different clonotypes, limiting the sequence diversity of antigen-specific antibodies that can be identified. We describe how the antibody binding site, the paratope, can be used to cluster antibodies with common antigen reactivity from different clonotypes. Our method, paratyping, uses the predicted paratope to identify these novel cross clonotype matches. We experimentally validated our predictions on a pertussis toxoid dataset. Our results show that even the simplest abstraction of the antibody binding site, using only the length of the loops involved and predicted binding residues, is sufficient to group antigen-specific antibodies and provide additional information to conventional clonotype analysis.

This study aimed to determine the differences between laboratory parameters in (1) COVID-19 versus non-COVID-19 pneumonia, and (2) severe versus non-severe COVID-19 cases. Methods: Studies were collected until March 2020, and retrieved parameters include leukocyte, neutrophil, thrombocyte, and lymphocyte counts in addition to C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT) and D-dimer levels. In the presence of heterogeneity, the random-effect model (REM) was used instead of the fixed-effect model (FEM). Results: Seven studies in the first analysis showed significantly lower leukocyte, neutrophil and platelet counts in COVID-19 pneumonia (SMD = -0.42, 95%CI -0.60 – -0.25, p<0.00001, SMD = -0.23, 95%CI -0.41 – -0.06, p=0.01, SMD = -0.54, 95%CI -0.91 – -0.16, p=0.0005) compared to non-COVID-19 pneumonia. Twenty-six studies in the second analysis showed significantly lower lymphocyte and thrombocyte counts (SMD = -0.56, 95%CI -0.71 – -0.40, p<0.0001, SMD = -0.32, 95%CI -0.49 – -0.15, p=0.0002) and significantly higher leukocyte, neutrophil, D-dimer, and CRP (SMD = 0.31, 95%CI 0.07 – 0.56, p=0.01; SMD = 0.44, 95%CI 0.24 – 0.64, p<0.0001; SMD = 0.53, 95%CI 0.31 – 0.75, p<0.00001; SMD = 0.97, 95%CI 0.70 – 1.24, p<0.00001) in severe COVID-19 compared to non-severe COVID-19. Conclusions: In conclusion, thrombocyte count is key in both diagnosis and prognosis.

632761,Potential of electric stimulation for the management of COVID-19,2020-09-10,"Human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63) is an enveloped pathogen of the family Coronaviridae that spreads worldwide and causes up to 10% of all annual respiratory diseases. HCoV-NL63 is typically associated with mild upper respiratory symptoms in children, elderly and immunocompromised individuals. It has also been shown to cause severe lower respiratory illness. NL63 shares ACE2 as a receptor for viral entry with SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2. Here, we present the in situ structure of HCoV-NL63 spike (S) trimer at 3.4-Å resolution by single-particle cryo-EM imaging of vitrified virions without chemical fixative. It is structurally homologous to that obtained previously from the biochemically purified ectodomain of HCoV-NL63 S trimer, which displays a three-fold symmetric trimer in a single conformation. In addition to previously proposed and observed glycosylation sites, our map shows density at other sites, as well as different glycan structures. The domain arrangement within a protomer is strikingly different from that of the SARS-CoV-2 S and may explain their different requirements for activating binding to the receptor. This structure provides the basis for future studies of spike proteins with receptors, antibodies or drugs, in the native state of the coronavirus particles.","Zhang, Kaiming; Li, Shanshan; Pintilie, Grigore; Chmielewski, David; Schmid, Michael F.; Simmons, Graham; Jin, Jing; Chiu, Wah",QRB Discov,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34192263/; https://doi.org/10.1017/qrd.2020.16,114

It is unknown how many US states have ventilator allocation guidelines and how these state guidelines compare with one another. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the number of publicly available US state guidelines for ventilator allocation and the variation in state recommendations for how ventilator allocation decisions should occur and to assess whether unique criteria exist for pediatric patients. EVIDENCE REVIEW: This systematic review evaluated publicly available guidelines about ventilator allocation for all states in the US and in the District of Columbia using department of health websites for each state and internet searches. Documents with any discussion of a process to triage mechanical ventilatory support during a public health emergency were screened for inclusion. Articles were excluded if they did not include specific ventilator allocation recommendations, were in draft status, did not include their state department of health, or were not the most up-to-date guideline. All documents were individually assessed and reassessed by 2 independent reviewers from March 30 to April 2 and May 8 to 10, 2020. FINDINGS: As of May 10, 2020, 26 states had publicly available ventilator guidelines, and 14 states had pediatric guidelines. Use of the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score in the initial rank of adult patients was recommended in 15 state guidelines (58%), and assessment of limited life expectancy from underlying conditions or comorbidities was included in 6 state guidelines (23%). Priority was recommended for specific groups in the initial evaluation of patients in 6 states (23%) (ie, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Utah). Many states recommended exclusion criteria in adult (11 of 26 states [42%]) and pediatric (10 of 14 states [71%]) ventilator allocation. Withdrawal of mechanical ventilation from a patient to give to another if a shortage occurs was discussed in 22 of 26 adult guidelines (85%) and 9 of 14 pediatric guidelines (64%). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These findings suggest that although allocation guidelines for mechanical ventilatory support are essential in a public health emergency, only 26 US states provided public guidance on how this allocation should occur. Guidelines among states, including adjacent states, varied significantly and could cause inequity in the allocation of mechanical ventilatory support during a public health emergency, such as the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic.","Piscitello, Gina M.; Kapania, Esha M.; Miller, William D.; Rojas, Juan C.; Siegler, Mark; Parker, William F.",JAMA Netw Open,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32558916/; https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2020.12606,114

We found a significant difference in the CFR between the two groups of countries. Our data further supports the view that universal BCG vaccination has a protective effect on the course of COVID-19 probably preventing progression to severe disease and death.

637009,Oncology care in the era of pandemics,2020,"BACKGROUND: Data on viral factors causing pediatric disease and guidance for pediatric-specific considerations have lagged behind adults throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. As COVID-19 infections and deaths increase in the pediatric population, characterization of SARS-CoV-2 viral dynamics in children would enable data-driven public health guidance. METHODS: Nasal swabs collected from children with COVID-19 were analyzed. Viral load was quantified by RT-PCR; viral culture was assessed by direct observation of cytopathic effects and semiquantitative viral titers. Correlations with age or symptom duration were analyzed. SARS-CoV-2 whole genome amplification was compared with contemporaneous Massachusetts sequences to assess for clustering patterns. RESULTS: Ninety-seven children with COVID-19 (median age 10 years, range 2 weeks-22 years) were included in this study. Age did not impact SARS-CoV-2 viral load in nasal secretions: children of all ages were equally likely to carry live, replicating virus. Children within the first five days of illness had higher viral loads and rates of culture positivity, and viral load in hospitalized children (n=30) did not differ from hospitalized adults (n=21) with similar duration of symptoms. While pediatric SARS-CoV-2 sequences were representative of those in the community, novel variants were identified. CONCLUSIONS: Children can carry high quantities of live, replicating virus, creating a potential reservoir for transmission and evolution of genetic variants. As guidance around social distancing and masking evolves following vaccine uptake in older populations, a clear understanding of SARS-CoV-2 infection dynamics in children is critical for rational development of public health policies and vaccination strategies to mitigate the impact of COVID-19.","Yonker, Lael M.; Boucau, Julie; Regan, James; Choudhary, Manish C.; Burns, Madeleine D.; Young, Nicola; Farkas, Eva J.; Davis, Jameson; Moschovis, Peter P.; Kinane, T.

637341,COVID-19 and paediatric challenges: An interview with Professor of Paediatrics Vana Papaevangelou (University of Athens School of Medicine),2020-10-30,"The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a highly contagious virus that underlies the current COVID-19 pandemic. SARS-CoV-2 is thought to disable various features of host immunity and cellular defense. The SARS-CoV-2 nonstructural protein 1 (Nsp1) is known to inhibit host protein translation and could be a target for antiviral therapy against COVID-19. However, how SARS-CoV-2 circumvents this translational blockage for the production of its own proteins is an open question. Here, we report a bipartite mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 Nsp1 which operates by: (1) hijacking the host ribosome via direct interaction of its C-terminal domain (CT) with the 40S ribosomal subunit and (2) specifically lifting this inhibition for SARS-CoV-2 via a direct interaction of its N-terminal domain (NT) with the 5’ untranslated region (5’ UTR) of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA. We show that while Nsp1-CT is sufficient for binding to 40S and inhibition of host protein translation, the 5’ UTR of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA removes this inhibition by binding to Nsp1-NT, suggesting that the Nsp1-NT-UTR interaction is incompatible with the Nsp1-CT-40S interaction. Indeed, lengthening the linker between Nsp1-NT and Nsp1-CT of Nsp1 progressively reduced the ability of SARS-CoV-2 5’ UTR to escape the translational inhibition, supporting that the incompatibility is likely steric in nature. The short SL1 region of the 5’ UTR is required for viral mRNA translation in the presence of Nsp1. Thus, our data provide a comprehensive view on how Nsp1 switches infected cells from host mRNA translation to SARS-CoV-2 mRNA translation, and that Nsp1 and 5’ UTR may be targeted for anti-COVID-19 therapeutics.","Shi, Ming; Wang, Longfei; Fontana, Pietro; Vora, Setu; Zhang, Ying; Fu, Tian-Min; Lieberman, Judy; Wu, Hao",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.09.18.302901; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32995777/,114
637410,"Supporting breast cancer survivors via text messages: reach, acceptability, and utility of EMPOWER-SMS",2021-09-09,"FUNDING ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS: Type of funding sources: None. BACKGROUND: During the COVID-19 pandemic, many non-urgent elective cardiac MRI (CMR) appointments were cancelled to minimise the risk of infection to patients coming to hospital. At the time of the first lockdown, our scanning schedule allowed on average 228 scans/month. Non-urgent elective studies were cancelled from April-June 2020, resulting in 684 scans added to the waiting list. Upon reactivation of our clinical CMR service, we developed a service quality improvement initiative consisting of using a ‘Rapid CMR’ protocol to reduce scanning time without compromising the test’s diagnostic accuracy, increase our scanning capacity and improve efficiency in reducing the backlog of requests. PURPOSE: To demonstrate the increased scanning capacity generated by the adoption of the ""Rapid CMR"" protocol. METHODS: The Rapid CMR protocol was implemented in November 2020 to all scans requiring cines, late gadolinium enhancement ± adenosine stress (non-stress and stress studies). The protocol was modelled on prior published experiences[1,2]. Patients who underwent these scans with additional imaging (e.g. T2-STIR imaging) were excluded. Data was collected from Nov 2020 to Jan 2021 and compared with the same time period the previous year when the standard protocol was used (cf. Image 1). Data collected included scan duration (time from first to last image), whether the Rapid CMR studies maintained diagnostic quality (yes/no), and the did-not-attend (DNA) rate. RESULTS: With the Rapid CMR protocol 254 patients were scanned (114 non-stress, 140 stress), compared with 286 patients scanned with standard protocol in November 2019 to January 2020 (155 non-stress, 131 stress). Median scanning time in minutes for non-stress was 29 (IQR 25-34; Rapid) vs 37 (IQR 33-41; standard); (p < 0.001). For stress studies the median scanning time in minutes was 32 (IQR 28-36; Rapid) vs 41 (IQR 29-45; standard; (p < 0.001). The rate of suboptimal imaging due to patient factors (such as breathing or arrhythmia) was similar for each protocol (14.4% Rapid, 20.2% standard; p = 0.04). All Rapid studies were of diagnostic quality (Table 1). Saving c.8 minutes per scan led to an improved scanning time and schedule capacity of 21%. Fewer patients were scanned with the Rapid protocol due to pandemic related issues: patient reluctance to accept appointments (unfilled slots), cleaning measures between patients (on average ∼5 mins per slot reducing overall capacity), and a higher DNA rate: 15.3% (Rapid) vs 6.5% (standard); p < 0.001. CONCLUSION: The Rapid CMR protocol resulted in a statistically significant reduction in scanning time (-8 min for both stress and non-stress CMRs) increasing our schedule capacity and improving efficiency by 21%, whilst maintaining diagnostic quality. The implementation of the Rapid CMR protocol is a feasible and effective strategy to tackle the backlog of CMR clinical request accumulated during the pandemic.","Liang, K; Nakou, E; De Garate, E; Williams, M; Lawton, CB; Bucciarelli-Ducci, C",Eur Heart J Cardiovasc Imaging,https://doi.org/10.1093/ehjci/jeab090.012,114

The dependent variable was operationalized in two ways: (1) as a Likert-style question about COO importance in general, and (2) as an indication of COO as the most important food attribute at first purchase, which I called top-of-mind COO importance. The survey was conducted with the use of the internet panel of a research agency in a representative sample of 1051 Polish consumers. In bivariate analyses, I identified the characteristics of consumer segments attaching high importance to each type of COO information. In a multivariate log-normal regression, general COO importance was affected to the largest extent by the product originating from Poland, which confirmed the strong relation between COO importance and consumer ethnocentrism. In multivariate logit regressions, top-of-mind COO importance depended also on the Polish origin of the product to the largest extent. The remaining predictors were sex (men were over 1.5 times more likely to indicate COO as the most important attribute) and age (each year of life contributing to a 2% increase in the likelihood of indicating top-of-mind COO). A theoretical implication is to differentiate between general and top-of-mind COO measures, as different results were obtained depending on whether the COO effect was measured as a response to questions such as “How important is the product COO for you?” or “What is the most important product attribute for you?—COO” Not only were the answer patterns different, but their determinants also varied.","Bryła, Paweł",Nutrients,https://doi.org/10.3390/nu13093251; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34579128/,114

Four weeks after the State of Emergency began, between 17 April and 15 May 2020, caregivers completed this online survey, including the Perceived Stress Scale. Participants (n = 335) were 99% female and mostly White (87%). Over half (60%) were breastfeeding, and 71% had a household income over CAD$60,000. Most participants (77%) received governmental parental benefits before the emergency, and 59% experienced no COVID‐19‐related economic changes. Over three quarters of participants (77%) scored moderate levels of perceived stress. Common themes of concern included social isolation, COVID‐19 infection (both caregiver and infant), and a lack of access to goods, namely, human milk substitutes (‘infant formula’), and services, including health care, lactation support, and social supports. Most COVID‐19‐related information was sought from the internet and social media, so for broad reach, future evidence‐based information should be shared via online platforms. Although participants were experiencing moderate self‐perceived stress and shared numerous concerns, very few COVID‐19‐related changes to infant feeding were reported, and there were few differences by socio‐economic status, likely due to a strong economic safety net in this Canadian setting.","Fry, Hillary L.; Levin, Olga; Kholina, Ksenia; Bianco, Jolene L.; Gallant, Jelisa; Chan, Kathleen; Whitfield, Kyly C.",Matern Child Nutr,https://doi.org/10.1111/mcn.13154; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33619906/,114

To shed light on this critical matter, the present study provides the first comprehensive assessment of SARS-CoV-2 stability on experimentally contaminated personal protective equipment (PPE) widely used by healthcare workers and the general public. Persistence of viable virus was monitored over 21 days on eight different materials, including nitrile medical examination gloves, reinforced chemical resistant gloves, N-95 and N-100 particulate respirator masks, Tyvek, plastic, cotton, and stainless steel. Unlike previous reports, viable SARS-CoV-2 in the presence of a soil load persisted for up to 21 days on experimentally inoculated PPE, including materials from filtering facepiece respirators (N-95 and N-100 masks) and a plastic visor. Conversely, when applied to 100% cotton fabric, the virus underwent rapid degradation and became undetectable by TCID(50) assay within 24 h.

METHODS: This retrospective case-control study involves subjects (7–98 years) presenting at the designated national outbreak screening center and tertiary care hospital in Singapore for SARS-CoV-2 testing from 26 January to 16 February 2020. COVID-19 status was confirmed by PCR testing of sputum, nasopharyngeal swabs, or throat swabs. Demographic, clinical, laboratory, and exposure-risk variables ascertainable at presentation were analyzed to develop an algorithm for estimating the risk of COVID-19. Model development used Akaike’s information criterion in a stepwise fashion to build logistic regression models, which were then translated into prediction scores. Performance was measured using receiver operating characteristic curves, adjusting for overconfidence using leave-one-out cross-validation. RESULTS: The study population included 788 subjects, of whom 54 (6.9%) were SARS-CoV-2 positive and 734 (93.1%) were SARS-CoV-2 negative. The median age was 34 years, and 407 (51.7%) were female. Using leave-one-out cross-validation, all the models incorporating clinical tests (models 1, 2, and 3) performed well with areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUCs) of 0.91, 0.88, and 0.88, respectively. In comparison, model 4 had an AUC of 0.65. CONCLUSIONS: Rapidly ascertainable clinical and laboratory data could identify individuals at high risk of COVID-19 and enable prioritization of PCR testing and containment efforts. Basic laboratory test results were crucial to prediction models.","Sun, Yinxiaohe; Koh, Vanessa; Marimuthu, Kalisvar; Ng, Oon Tek; Young, Barnaby; Vasoo, Shawn; Chan, Monica; Lee, Vernon J M; De, Partha P; Barkham, Timothy; Lin, Raymond T P; Cook, Alex R; Leo, Yee Sin",Clin Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32211755/; https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciaa322,114

The genetic-phenotypic mechanism underneath the four mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive types of O, A, B and AB could theoretically be elucidated. However, genetic polymorphisms in the human populations render the link elusive, and importantly, past studies using genetically determined rather than biochemically determined ABO types were not and could not be evaluated for the inference errors. Upon both blood-typing and genotyping a cohort of 1008 people of the Han Chinese population, we conducted a genome-wide association study in parallel with both binomial and multinomial log-linear models. Significant genetic variants are all mapped to the ABO gene, and are quantitatively evaluated for binary and multi-class classification performances. Three single nucleotide polymorphisms of rs8176719, rs635634 and rs7030248 would together be sufficient to establish a multinomial predictive model that achieves high accuracy (0.98) and F1 scores (micro 0.99 and macro 0.97). Using the set of identified ABO-associated genetic variants as instrumental variables, we demonstrate the application in causal analysis by Mendelian randomization (MR) studies on blood pressures (one-sample MR) and severe COVID-19 with respiratory failure (two-sample MR).","Wang, Mengqiao; Gao, Jiaqi; Liu, Jin; Zhao, Xing; Lei, Yi",Genes (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/genes12070959; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34202464/,114

Their role in human disease has not yet been determined. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to develop sensitive and specific assays for the detection of KIV and WUV. STUDY: Two KIV (KI-A and KI-B) and three WUV (WU-A, WU-B and WU-C) real-time polymerase chain reaction (rtPCR) assays were developed and evaluated. Clinical sensitivities and specificities were determined by testing 200 respiratory specimens and the results compared to those for previously described conventional PCR assays. Limits of detection were determined, and the analytical specificities of the assays were investigated. RESULTS: No cross-reactivity was observed between the rtPCR methods and unrelated organisms. All five rtPCR assays could reliably detect 10 copies of genomic DNA equivalents per reaction, which was more sensitive than conventional methods. Compared to the conventional PCR assays, the sensitivity of the KI-A, KI-B, WU-A, WU-B and WU-C assays was 100%, 86.7% 95.5%, 100% and 100%, respectively. Specificity was 94.6%, 97.3%, 96.6%, 97.7% and 97.2%, respectively.

More than 50 serotypes have been recognized; however, the exact association of serotype with clinical phenotype is still unclear. There have been no reports on the adenovirus serotype pattern in Hong Kong, and their relationships with disease manifestations and complications are not known. Clinical and epidemiological data on 287 children (<6 years old) admitted with adenovirus respiratory infections from 2001 to 2004 were reviewed. Common presenting symptoms included fever (97.9 %) and cough and rhinitis (74 %). Extra-pulmonary manifestations were present in 37.3 %. The clinical picture mimicked bacterial infection for its prolonged high fever and neutrophilic blood picture. Forty-two patients (14.6 %) had LRTI, either pneumonia or acute bronchiolitis, but none had severe acute respiratory compromise. Children aged 1 to 2 years old were most at risk for adenovirus LRTI (adjusted p = 0.0165). Serotypes 1 to 7 could be identified in 93.7 % of the nasopharyngeal specimens, with serotypes 2 and 3 being the most prevalent. Different serotypes showed predilection for different age groups and with different respiratory illness association. The majority of acute bronchiolitis (71.4 %) were associated with serotype 2 infection, and this association was statistically significant (p < 0.0001). Serotype 3 infection accounted for over half of the pneumonia cases (57–75 %) in those aged 3–5 years old. Only one patient developed mild bronchiectasis after serotype 7 pneumonia. Children aged 1 to 2 years old were the at-risk group for adenovirus LRTI, but respiratory morbidity was relatively mild in our locality. There was an apparent serotype–respiratory illness association.","Chau, Shuk-Kuen; Lee, So-lun; Peiris, Malik J.

A pertinent and recent example where such strategy could be employed is in the fight against COVID-19. Therapies designed or discovered to target viral proteins also have off-target effects on the host proteome when employed in a complex physiological environment. This study aims to assess these host cell targets for a panel of FDA approved antiviral compounds including Remdesivir, using the cellular thermal shift assay (CETSA®) coupled to mass spectrometry (CETSA MS) in non-infected cells. CETSA MS is a powerful method to delineate direct and indirect interactions between small molecules and protein targets in intact cells. Biologically active compounds can induce changes in thermal stability, in their primary binding partners as well as in proteins that in turn interact with the direct targets. Such engagement of host targets by antiviral drugs may contribute to the clinical effect against the virus but can also constitute a liability. We present here a comparative study of CETSA molecular target engagement fingerprints of antiviral drugs to better understand the link between off-targets and efficacy.","Friman, Tomas; Chernobrovkin, Alexey; Molina, Daniel Martinez; Arnold, Laurence",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.19.210492,114
643304,ImmunosuppressiveTherapies Differently Modulate Humoral- and T-Cell-Specific Responses to COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine in Rheumatoid Arthritis Patients,2021-09-14,"BACKGROUND: People with multiple sclerosis (MS) are a vulnerable group for severe COVID- 19, particularly those taking immunosuppressive disease-modifying therapies (DMTs). We examined the characteristics of COVID-19 severity in an international sample of people with MS. METHODS: Data from 12 data-sources in 28 countries were aggregated (sources could include patients from 1-12 countries). Demographic (age, sex), clinical (MS-phenotype, disability), and DMT (untreated, alemtuzumab, cladribine, dimethyl-fumarate, glatiramer acetate, interferon, natalizumab, ocrelizumab, rituximab, siponimod, other DMTs) covariates were queried, alongside COVID-19 severity outcomes, hospitalisation, ICU admission, requiring artificial ventilation, and death. Characteristics of outcomes were assessed in patients with suspected/confirmed COVID-19 using multilevel mixed-effects logistic regression, adjusted for age, sex, MS-phenotype, and EDSS. RESULTS: 657(28.1%) with suspected and 1,683(61.9%) with confirmed COVID-19 were analysed. Among suspected+confirmed and confirmed-only COVID-19, 20.9% and 26.9% were hospitalised, 5.4% and 7.2% were admitted to ICU, 4.1% and 5.4% required artificial ventilation, and 3.2% and 3.9% died. Older age, progressive MS-phenotype, and higher disability were associated with worse COVID-19 outcomes. Compared to dimethyl-fumarate, ocrelizumab and rituximab were associated with hospitalisation (aOR=1.56,95%CI=1.01- 2.41; aOR=2.43,95%CI=1.48-4.02) and ICU admission (aOR=2.30,95%CI=0.98-5.39;aOR=3.93,95%CI=1.56-9.89), though only rituximab was associated with higher risk of artificial ventilation (aOR=4.00,95%CI=1.54-10.39). Compared to pooled other DMTs, ocrelizumab and rituximab were associated with hospitalisation (aOR=1.75,95%CI=1.29- 2.38; aOR=2.76,95%CI=1.87-4.07) and ICU admission (aOR=2.55,95%CI=1.49-4.36;aOR=4.32,95%CI=2.27-8.23) but only rituximab with artificial ventilation (aOR=6.15,95%CI=3.09-12.27). Compared to natalizumab, ocrelizumab and rituximab wereassociated with hospitalisation (aOR=1.86,95%CI=1.13-3.07; aOR=2.88,95%CI=1.68-4.92) and ICU admission (aOR=2.13,95%CI=0.85-5.35; aOR=3.23,95%CI=1.17-8.91), but only rituximab with ventilation (aOR=5.52,95%CI=1.71-17.84). Importantly, associations persisted on restriction to confirmed COVID-19 cases. No associations were observed between DMTs and death. Stratification by age, MS-phenotype, and EDSS found no indications that DMT associations with COVID-19 severity reflected differential DMT allocation by underlying COVID-19 severity. CONCLUSIONS: Using the largest cohort of people with MS and COVID-19 available, we demonstrated consistent associations of rituximab with increased risk of hospitalisation, ICU admission, and requiring artificial ventilation, and ocrelizumab with hospitalisation and ICU admission. Despite the study's cross-sectional design, the internal and external consistency of these results with prior studies suggests rituximab/ocrelizumab use may be a risk factor for more severe COVID-19.","Simpson-Yap, Steve; De Brouwer, Edward; Kalincik, Tomas; Rijke, Nick; Hillert, Jan A; Walton, Clare; Edan, Gilles; Moreau, Yves; Spelman, Tim; Geys, Lotte; Parciak, Tina; Gautrais, Clement; Lazovski, Nikola; Pirmani, Ashkan; Ardeshirdavanai, Amin; Forsberg, Lars; Glaser, Anna; McBurney, Robert; Schmidt, Hollie; Bergmann, Arnfin B; Braune, Stefan; Stahmann, Alexander; Middleton, Rodden; Salter, Amber; Fox, Robert J; van der Walt, Anneke; Butzkueven, Helmut; Alroughani, Raed; Ozakbas, Serkan; Rojas, Juan I; van der Mei, Ingrid; Nag, Nupur; Ivanov, Rumen; Sciascia do Olival, Guilherme; Dias, Alice Estavo; Magyari, Melinda; Brum, Doralina; Mendes, Maria Fernanda; Alonso, Ricardo N; Nicholas, Richard S; Bauer, Johana; Chertcoff, Aníbal Sebastián; Zabalza, Anna; Arrambide, Georgina; Fidao, Alex; Comi, Giancarlo; Peeters, Liesbet",Neurology,https://doi.org/10.1212/wnl.0000000000012753; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34610987/,114

643590,How vision and leadership shaped the U.S. National Cancer Institute's 50-year journey to advance the evidence base of cancer control and cancer care delivery research,2020-10-13,"Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is one of the major causes of mortality associated with COVID-19 disease. Many patients will require intensive care with ventilatory support. Despite progress and best efforts, the mortality rates projected remain high. Historical data outlook points towards 80% expected fatality for patients progressing to advanced pulmonary disease, even when hospitalized in the intensive care unit. This is particularly true among the patient population over 65. Novel life-saving strategies are desperately needed to mitigate the high mortality that will be associated with the late stage SARS-CoV-2 viral infection associated with the fatal respiratory distress. We hypothesize that the morbidity, severity of the disease, and underlying physiological events leading to mortality are closely linked to the TRPV1 expressing neuronal system (afferent/efferent neurons) in the lungs. TRPV1 expressing cells are responsible for pain transmission, inflammation and immunomodulation throughout the entire pulmonary system and are modulating the processes associated with localized cytokine release (storm) and overall rapid disease progression. We suggest that therapeutic approaches targeting TRPV1 containing nerve fibers in the lungs will modulate the inflammatory and immune signal activity, leading to reduced mortality and better overall outcomes. We also propose to further explore the use of resiniferatoxin (RTX), an ultra-potent TRPV1 agonist currently in clinical trials for cancer and osteoarthritis pain, as a possible ablating agent of TRPV1 positive pulmonary pathways in patients with advanced COVID-19 disease.","Nahama, Alexis; Ramachandran, Roshni; Cisternas, Alvaro Francisco; Ji, Henry",Med Drug Discov,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.medidd.2020.100033; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2590098620300208; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590098620300208?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32292906/,114

644702,Amiodarone as a possible therapy for coronavirus infection,2020-04-16,"INTRODUCTION: A neutrophilic infiltrate characterizes bacterial pneumonia. Macrophage infiltration is similarly characteristic of the viral pneumonia caused by SARS‐CoV‐2. These infiltrating macrophages, while phagocytic and capable of engulfing virus laden alveolar cells, are also rich in tissue factor—a thromboplastin. This prothrombotic aspect likely explains how a respiratory virus whose malign effects should be confined to the oropharynx, bronchi and lungs, can cause a panoply of extra‐pulmonary organ disorders. Elevated ferritin levels in ICU Covid 19 patients, and elevated acute phase proteins suggest immune overreaction. Elevated d‐dimers implicate clotting as well. This evidence links hyperactive innate immunity (macrophage lung infiltrates) with the elevated levels of oligomeric fibrin present in the bloodstream of these patients. METHODS: An in‐house assay measuring oligomeric (soluble) fibrin (also referred to as soluble fibrin monomer complexes or SFMC) in whole blood, previously developed for monitoring incipient disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) during liver transplantation, was made available to COVID ICU attendings. Since SFMC constitutes the input to intravascular fibrin clots and d‐dimer reflects fibrin clot dissolution, it was thought that the two tests, run in tandem along with assays of immune activation, might clarify the frequency and possibly the cause of DIC in patients with severe COVID‐19 pneumonia. RESULTS: Classical DIC with intravascular clotting and thrombocytopenia was documented only rarely. However, early in the pandemic shortly after the assay was made available, it identified three patients undergoing acute defibrination. In each patient virtually all of the body's fibrinogen was transformed into SFMC over 3–4 days and deposited somewhere in the vasculature without any gross clots being detected. CONCLUSIONS: Three COVID‐19 patients with evidence of a hyperactive immune response (elevated ferritin and acute phase proteins) defibrinated while blood levels of SFMC were being monitored. SFMC levels that were five times higher than normal appeared in the circulation during the defibrination process. SFMC at these levels may precipitate as showers of microclots, damaging heart, kidney, brain, and so forth.","Bull, Brian S.; Hay, Karen L.",Immun Inflamm Dis,https://doi.org/10.1002/iid3.482; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34231951/,114

Mental health disorders in pregnancy are known to have adverse outcomes both for mothers and their children. It is the first study in Poland to investigate the impact of the pandemic on stress level and general mental state in pregnant women. METHODS: Three hundred sixteen pregnant women completed an online survey containing four instruments. The main research questions were investigated with Bayesian regression analyses. RESULTS: We found that 37% of pregnant women presented with some mental state disorders and almost 46% with elevated emotional tension. Seventeen % had elevated stress level, 11% elevated intrapsychic stress level and 13% elevated outward stress level. Both 'being scared of lack of social support...' and 'being scared of infection...' have an impact on stress level, however the first factor is a more substantial stressor. CONCLUSIONS: Multiple pregnant women during the Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 pandemic presented with mental state disorders and elevated stress levels. As mental state disorders contribute to adverse neonatal outcomes and maternal mortality, it is imperative to focus on pregnant women's psychological and psychiatric conditions during the pandemic.

Usage of pulmonary computed tomography (CT) scan is known to be an important method in the diagnosis of COVID-19. Here, we aimed to evaluate the relationship between CT severity score and capillary blood oxygen saturation in patients with COVID-19 infection. Methods and material: This is a cross-sectional study performed in 2020 on patients with COVID-19 infection. All patients underwent pulmonary CT scan and CT severity score was calculated. The initial capillary oxygen saturation by the time of admission was also collected. Data were collected and analyzed. Results: A total number of 270 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 infection entered the study. The initial mean capillary oxygen saturation was 89.65 ± 8.09%. The mean score in patients was 15.16 ± 8.08. We also indicated that 27 patients had hypoxia by the time of admission and these patients had significantly higher CT severity scores (p = 0.001). Diabetes mellitus (p = 0.001), hypertension (p = 0.001), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (p = 0.03) and totally having an underlying disease (p < 0.001) were significantly associated with decreased capillary oxygen saturation. Patients with hypertension (p = 0.001) and patients with the previous medical disease (p = 0.01) had significantly higher CT severity scores than others. There was a significant reverse relationship between CT severity score and capillary oxygen saturation (r = −0.44, p < 0.001). Conclusions: We showed that there was a significant reverse relationship between CT severity score and capillary oxygen saturation which has great clinical importance. Furthermore, we indicated that previous medical history could also play an important role in CT severity score.

RESULTS: Results demonstrate significant differences between child and adult sessions with a relative decrease in the number of child mental health services with the switch to TH in March 2020 (onset of lockdown) and a relatively rapid shift back to face‐to‐face among child services when in‐person services resumed in May and June 2020. Results further highlight significant differences between child age and service type, with psychiatry less affected by TH than psychotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: Implicit in the data is the ability to offer remotely, a high volume of ongoing behavioral intervention. Findings support TH as less preferred for children than adults while indicating that child TH is favored for psychiatry and support services, less so for psychotherapy. Implications for enhancing child TH delivery and directions for continued research include relational factors, platform (phone/video) and screen salience.","Hoffnung, Gabriel; Feigenbaum, Esther; Schechter, Ayelet; Guttman, Daniel; Zemon, Vance; Schechter, Isaac",Psychiatr Res Clin Pract,https://doi.org/10.1176/appi.prcp.20200035; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33821240/,114

The tremendous number of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases in the United States has resulted in a large population of survivors with prolonged post-infectious symptoms. The creation of multidisciplinary post-COVID-19 clinics to address both persistent symptoms and potential long-term complications requires an understanding of the acute disease and the emerging data regarding COVID-19 outcomes. Experience with severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome, post-acute respiratory distress syndrome complications, and post-intensive care syndrome also informs anticipated sequelae and clinical program design. Post-COVID-19 clinical programs should be prepared to care for individuals previously hospitalized with COVID-19 (including those who required critical care support), non-hospitalized individuals with persistent respiratory symptoms following COVID-19 infection, and individuals with pre-existing lung disease complicated by COVID-19. Effective multidisciplinary collaboration models leverage lessons learned during the early phases of the pandemic to overcome the unique logistical challenges posed by pandemic circumstances. Collaboration between clinicians and researchers across disciplines will provide insight into survivorship that may shape the treatment of both acute disease and chronic complications. In this review, we discuss the aims, general principles, elements of design, and challenges of a successful multidisciplinary model to address the needs of COVID-19 survivors.","Lutchmansingh, Denyse D.; Knauert, Melissa P.; Antin-Ozerkis, Danielle E.; Chupp, Geoffrey; Cohn, Lauren; Dela Cruz, Charles S.; Ferrante, Lauren E.; Herzog, Erica L.; Koff, Jonathan; Rochester, Carolyn L.; Ryu, Changwan; Singh, Inderjit; Tickoo, Mayanka; Winks, Vikki; Gulati, Mridu; Possick, Jennifer D.",Chest,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012369220351254?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0012369220351254; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33159907/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chest.2020.10.067,114
648821,A Molecular Docking Study Repurposes FDA Approved Iron Oxide Nanoparticles to Treat and Control COVID-19 Infection,2020-07-12,"Combating the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic demands accurate, rapid, and point-of-care testing with fast results to triage cases for isolation and treatment. The current testing relies on reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR), which is routinely performed in well-equipped laboratories by trained professionals at specific locations. However, during busy periods, high numbers of samples queued for testing can delay the test results, impacting efforts to reduce the infection risk. Besides, the absence of well-established laboratories at remote sites and low-resourced environments can contribute to a silent spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). These reasons compel the need to accommodate point-of-care testing for COVID-19 that meets the ASSURED criteria (affordable, sensitive, specific, user-friendly, rapid and robust, equipment-free, and deliverable). This study assessed the agreement and accuracy of the portable Biomeme SARS-CoV-2 system against the gold standard tests. Nasopharyngeal and nasal swabs were used. Of the 192 samples tested using the Biomeme SARS-CoV-2 system, the results from 189 samples (98.4%) were in agreement with the reference standard-of-care RT-PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2. The portable system generated simultaneous results for nine samples in 80 min with high positive and negative percent agreements of 99.0% and 97.8%, respectively. We performed separate testing in a sealed glove box, offering complete biosafety containment. Thus, the Biomeme SARS-CoV-2 system can help decentralize COVID-19 testing and offer rapid test results for patients in remote and low-resourced settings.","Zowawi, Hosam M.; Alenazi, Thamer H.; AlOmaim, Waleed S.; Wazzan, Ahmad; Alsufayan, Abdullah; Hasanain, Rihab A.; Aldibasi, Omar S.; Althawadi, Sahar; Altamimi, Sarah A.; Mutabagani, Maysoon; Alamri, Maha; Almaghrabi, Reem S.; Al-Abdely, Hail M.; Memish, Ziad A.; Alqahtani, Saleh A.",J Clin Microbiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33674285/; https://doi.org/10.1128/jcm.03004-20,114

There are worldwide descriptions of neurological deficits in COVID-19 patients. Central nervous system (CNS) symptoms can be present early in the course of the disease. As many as 55% of hospitalized COVID-19 patients have been reported to have neurological disturbances three months after infection by SARS-CoV-2. The mutability of the SARS-COV-2 virus and its potential to directly affect the CNS highlight the urgency of developing technology to diagnose, manage, and treat brain injury in COVID-19 patients. The pathobiology of CNS infection by SARS-CoV-2 and the associated neurological sequelae of this infection remain poorly understood. In this review, we outline the rationale for the use of blood biomarkers (BBs) for diagnosis of brain injury in COVID-19 patients, the research needed to incorporate their use into clinical practice, and the improvements in patient management and outcomes that can result. BBs of brain injury could potentially provide tools for detection of brain injury in COVID-19 patients. Elevations of BBs have been reported in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood of COVID-19 patients. BB proteins have been analyzed in CSF to detect CNS involvement in patients with infectious diseases, including human immunodeficiency virus and tuberculous meningitis. BBs are approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for diagnosis of mild versus moderate traumatic brain injury and have identified brain injury after stroke, cardiac arrest, hypoxia, and epilepsy. BBs, integrated with other diagnostic tools, could enhance understanding of viral mechanisms of brain injury, predict severity of neurological deficits, guide triage of patients and assignment to appropriate medical pathways, and assess efficacy of therapeutic interventions in COVID-19 patients.","DeKosky, Steven T.; Kochanek, Patrick M.; Valadka, Alex B.; Clark, Robert S.B.; Chou, Sherry H.-Y.; Au, Alicia K.; Horvat, Christopher; Jha, Ruchira M.; Mannix, Rebekah; Wisniewski, Stephen R.; Wintermark, Max; Rowell, Susan E.; Welch, Robert D.; Lewis, Lawrence; House, Stacey; Tanzi, Rudolph E.; Smith, Darci R.; Vittor, Amy Y.; Denslow, Nancy D.; Davis, Michael D.; Glushakova, Olena Y.; Hayes, Ronald L.",J Neurotrauma,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33115334/; https://doi.org/10.1089/neu.2020.7332,114

The Movement Oriented Games Based Assessment (MOGBA) is a delivery and assessment intervention designed to improve children’s complex movement skills, based on principles of motor development and assessment theories. MOGBA aims to improve children’s movement competence, physical fitness and self-perceptions (physical and game) and increase children’s moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA). MOGBA is to be used in the ‘Made to Play’ initiative, involving 105 sports and activity programs across 21 countries, involving over 25 million children. A multi-site cluster randomized controlled trial will take place across three global sites (UK, Ireland and Australia). Each site will recruit eight primary schools (four experiment, four control) with each school providing two separate classes of children from age ranges 8–12 years (Site n = ~300, total n = 904). After baseline assessments, schools will be randomly allocated to an experimental or wait-list control group. Following two half-day workshops, trained facilitators will deliver the MOGBA intervention for 9 weeks. The main intervention components include delivery of 14 games-based activities with associated assessments of children’s movement and differentiation to meet children’s needs by manipulating space, effort and relationships. The primary outcome of the trial is to improve children’s’ movement competence (The Dragon Challenge), with secondary outcomes of improving children’s’ in-activity and leisure-time MVPA (5-day accelerometer), physical fitness (standing long jump and push ups) and self-perceptions (physical and game). Data will be analysed using multilevel modelling approaches. The MOGBA intervention has been designed to improve children’s movement competence and scalable interventions based on MOGBA could be applied across programs within the Made to Play initiative, globally. The trial is registered at the Australia New Zealand Clinical Trial Registry (ACTRN12619001320145p, 27 Sep 2019).","Morley, David; Rudd, James; Issartel, Johann; Goodway, Jackie; O’Connor, Donna; Foulkes, Jonathon; Babic, Mark; Kavanagh, Jennifer; Miller, Andrew",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0253747; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34166447/,114

However, because of the similarity of presentation with other cardiopulmonary pathologies, identification of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) related myocarditis can be challenging. Transthoracic echocardiography is a key component in initial diagnosis. COVID-19 related myocarditis is increasingly identified as an underlying problem in COVID-19 patients with low ejection fraction. Early recognition is critical with a low threshold for screening echocardiogram. Utilization of cardiac MRI (CMRI) can be helpful in recognition of early manifestations of COVID-19 myocarditis, with the added benefit of avoidance of invasive testing such as endomyocardial biopsy (EMB). Once diagnosis is established, disease-specific treatment can lead to rapid recovery of ventricular systolic function. We present a case series including two similar cases of COVID-19 myocarditis in which we utilized echocardiography as an early diagnostic tool and prompt treatment led to better prognosis.","Fatmi, Syed S; Basso, Rafaela; Liaqat, Adnan; Tariq, Fateeha; Swamiappan, Ramesh",Cureus,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34430109/; https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.16494,114

DATA SOURCES: Key historical articles, articles highlighted in our recent review of most significant recent asthma advancements, and findings from several birth cohorts related to asthma and viral infections were reviewed. In addition, PubMed was searched for review articles and original research related to the associations between viral infection and asthma, using the search words asthma, viral infections, atopy, development of asthma, rhinovirus (RV), and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). STUDY SELECTIONS: Articles were selected based on novelty and relevance to our topic of interest, the role of asthma and viral infections, and possible mechanisms to explain the association. RESULTS: There is a large body of evidence demonstrating a link between early viral infections (especially RV and RSV) and asthma inception and exacerbations. RV-induced wheezing is an important risk factor for asthma only when atopy is present, with much evidence supporting the idea that sensitization is a risk factor for early RV-induced wheezing, which in turn is a risk factor for asthma. RSV, on the other hand, is a more important risk factor for nonatopic asthma, with severe infections conferring greater risk. CONCLUSION: There are important differences in the development of atopic and nonatopic asthma, with several proposed mechanisms explaining the association between viral infections and the development of asthma and asthma exacerbations. Understanding these complex associations is important for developing asthma prevention strategies and targeted asthma therapies.","Mikhail, Irene; Grayson, Mitchell H.",Ann Allergy Asthma Immunol,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.anai.2019.06.020; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31276807/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1081120619304648; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1081120619304648,114

These questions emerge from two imperatives: the necessity to consider both short- and longer-term struggles in a context of protracted conflict and the need to protect public health as a public good whilst the public Primary Healthcare Network (PHCN) is facing the Covid19 pandemic. In order to identify how these questions are related to the need to be working short and long, we look at the imprints left by past and present shocks. Profound shocks of the past include the Lebanese civil war and the Syrian refugee crisis. We analyse how these shocks have resulted in the PHCN developing resilience mechanisms in order to ensure a space for healthcare provision that stands public in Lebanon today. Then, we consider how two present shocks -- the economic breakdown and the blast of ammonium nitrate in Beirut port -- are affecting and threatening the progress made by the PHCN to ensure that primary healthcare remains a public good, a fragile space acquired with difficulty in the past half century. We identify what questions emerge from the combined consequences of such traumas, when the immediate constraints of the present meet the impediments of the past. We consider what such questions mean more broadly, for the people living in Lebanon today, and for the PHCN ability to respond to the Covid 19 pandemic in a relevant way. Our hypothesis is that in a protracted conflict, such as the one defining the circumstances of Lebanon now, public access to primary healthcare might persist for the people as one safeguard, in which social and moral continuity can be anchored to protect a sense of public good.","Hamadeh, Randa Sami; Kdouh, Ola; Hammoud, Rawan; Leresche, Enrica; Leaning, Jennifer",Confl Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33827637/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s13031-021-00359-4,114

652617,International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis: Present and future,2021,"Treatment options in multiple myeloma (MM) are increasing with the introduction of complex multi-novel-agent-based regimens investigated in randomized clinical trials. However, application in the real-world setting, including feasibility of and adherence to these regimens, may be limited due to varying patient-, treatment-, and disease-related factors. Furthermore, approximately 40% of real-world MM patients do not meet the criteria for phase 3 studies on which approvals are based, resulting in a lack of representative phase 3 data for these patients. Therefore, treatment decisions must be tailored based on additional considerations beyond clinical trial efficacy and safety, such as treatment feasibility (including frequency of clinic/hospital attendance), tolerability, effects on quality of life (QoL), and impact of comorbidities. There are multiple factors of importance to real-world MM patients, including disease symptoms, treatment burden and toxicities, ability to participate in daily activities, financial burden, access to treatment and treatment centers, and convenience of treatment. All of these factors are drivers of QoL and treatment satisfaction/compliance. Importantly, given the heterogeneity of MM, individual patients may have different perspectives regarding the most relevant considerations and goals of their treatment. Patient perspectives/goals may also change as they move through their treatment course. Thus, the ‘efficacy’ of treatment means different things to different patients, and treatment decision-making in the context of personalized medicine must be guided by an individual’s composite definition of what constitutes the best treatment choice. This review summarizes the various factors of importance and practical issues that must be considered when determining real-world treatment choices. It assesses the current instruments, methodologies, and recent initiatives for analyzing the MM patient experience.

Methods In this randomized, open-label, parallel-arm, multicenter, Phase 3 trial, adults (18-75 years) with RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 and mild-to-moderate symptoms (including asymptomatic) were randomized 1:1 to oral favipiravir (Day 1: 1800 mg BID; Days 2-14: 800 mg BID) plus standard supportive care versus supportive care alone. The primary endpoint was time to cessation of viral shedding; time to clinical cure also was measured. Results From May 14-July 3, 2020, 150 patients were randomized to favipiravir (n = 75) or control (n = 75). Median time to cessation of viral shedding was 5 days (95% CI: 4 days, 7 days) versus 7 days (95% CI: 5 days, 8 days),P = 0.129, and median time to clinical cure was 3 days (95% CI: 3 days, 4 days) versus 5 days (95% CI: 4 days, 6 days), P = 0.030, for favipiravir and control, respectively. Adverse events were observed in 36% of favipiravir and 8% of control patients. One control patient died due to worsening disease. Conclusion Lack of statistical significance on the primary endpoint was confounded by limitations of the RT-PCR assay. Significant improvement in time to clinical cure suggests favipiravir may be beneficial in mild-to-moderate COVID-19.","Udwadia, Zarir F.; Singh, Pawan; Barkate, Hanmant; Patil, Saiprasad; Rangwala, Shabbir; Pendse, Amol; Kadam, Jatin; Wu, Wen; Caracta, Cynthia F.; Tandon, Monika",Int J Infect Dis,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S120197122032453X?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2020.11.142; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S120197122032453X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33212256/,114

METHODS: Literature values of IL‐6, IL‐6 antagonist SIL, sIL‐6R, IL‐6R antagonist TCZ and their respective binding constants were used to develop a model to predict the impact of treatment on IL‐6 signalling. Models were used to generate simulated bronchoalveolar lavage fluid concentrations for normal subjects, subjects at risk of developing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and subjects with ARDS under 4 conditions: without treatment; treatment with TCZ; treatment with SIL; and treatment with TCZ + SIL. RESULTS: With TCZ intervention, IL‐6 levels are unaffected and sIL‐6R is reduced somewhat below the Normal case. IL‐6:sIL‐6R complex only slightly decreased relative to the no‐intervention case. With SIL intervention, sIL‐6R levels are unaffected and IL‐6 is greatly reduced below the Normal case. IL‐6:sIL‐6R complex is greatly decreased relative to the no‐intervention case. With TCZ + SIL intervention, IL‐6 and sIL‐6R levels are reduced below the Normal case and achieve suppression equivalent to monotherapy results for their respective targets. IL‐6:sIL‐6R complex reduction is predicted to be greater than that achieved with monotherapy. This reflects sequestration of both components of the complex and the nonlinear binding equilibrium. CONCLUSION: Coadministration of both IL‐6 and IL‐6R sequestering products such as SIL and TCZ may be necessary to effectively treat COVID‐19 patients who have or are at risk of developing ARDS.","Doyle, Eileen B.; Bentley, Darren; Dodds, Michael G.",Br J Clin Pharmacol,https://doi.org/10.1111/bcp.15009; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34318516/,114

We describe here the first case of a pregnant woman with Covid-19 acute infection and non-classical congenital adrenal hyperplasia (NCAH). CASE DESCRIPTION: A woman at 36 weeks of gestation was referred to our Maternity Hospital for premature rupture of membranes (PROM). Her medical history was positive for NCAH on chronic steroid replacement till the age of 17 years (cortisone acetate and dexamethasone, both in the morning). At admission, her naso-oro-pharyngeal swab resulted positive for SARS-CoV-2. Due to hyperpyrexia and late preterm PROM, cesarean section was planned, and she was started on a 100 mg-bolus of hydrocortisone, followed by continuous infusion of 200 mg/24 h. A female neonate in good clinical condition and with a negative nasopharyngeal Covid-19 swab was delivered. On second postpartum day, the mother was in good condition and was switched to oral steroid therapy. On third postpartum day she worsened, with radiological signs of acute pulmonary embolism. Oro-tracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation were started, and she was switched back to intravenous steroid therapy. On April 30, pulmonary embolism was resolved, and on May 13th she was discharged in good condition. CONCLUSIONS: We report the first case of Covid-19 acute infection that occurred in late-pregnancy in a woman with NCAH on chronic steroid replacement.

OBJECTIVES: To assess the risk of hospitalization or in‐hospital mortality due to COVID‐19 by treatment exposure in patients with psoriasis. METHODS: All adults with psoriasis registered in the French national health‐insurance (Système National des Données de Santé, SNDS) database between 2008 and 2019 were eligible. Two study periods were considered: 15 February to 30 June 2020 and 1 October 2020 to 31 January 2021, the first and second waves of the COVID‐19 pandemic in France, respectively. Patients were classified according to their baseline treatment: biologics, nonbiologics, topicals or no treatment. The primary endpoint was hospitalization for COVID‐19 using Cox models with inverse probability of treatment weighting. The secondary endpoint was in‐hospital mortality due to COVID‐19. RESULTS: We identified 1 326 312 patients with psoriasis (mean age 59 years; males, 48%). During the first study period, 3871 patients were hospitalized for COVID‐19 and 759 (20%) died; during the second period 3603 were hospitalized for COVID‐19 and 686 (19%) died. In the propensity score‐weighted Cox models, risk of hospitalization for COVID‐19 was associated with exposure to topicals or nonbiologics [hazard ratio (95% confidence interval): 1·11 (1·04–1·20) and 1·27 (1·09–1·48), respectively] during the first period, and with all exposure types, during the second period. None of the exposure types was associated with in‐hospital mortality due to COVID‐19. CONCLUSIONS: Systemic treatments for psoriasis (including biologics) were not associated with increased risk of in‐hospital mortality due to COVID‐19. These results support maintaining systemic treatment for psoriasis during the pandemic.","Penso, L.; Dray‐Spira, R.; Weill, A.; Zureik, M.; Sbidian, E.",Br J Dermatol,https://doi.org/10.1111/bjd.20659; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34310699/,114

656054,Bone biology and COVID-19 infection: Is ACE2 a potential influence factor?,2020-08-10,"Borna disease virus (BDV) is a neurotropic, non-cytolytic RNA virus which replicates in the cell nucleus targeting mainly hippocampal neurons, but also astroglial and oligodendroglial cells in the brain. BDV is associated with a large spectrum of neuropsychiatric pathologies in animals. Its relationship to human neuropsychiatric illness still remains controversial. We could recently demonstrate that human BDV strain Hu-H1 promoted apoptosis and inhibited cell proliferation in a human oligodendroglial cell line (OL cells) whereas laboratory BDV strain V acted contrariwise. Here, differential protein expression between BDV Hu-H1-infected OL cells and non-infected OL cells was assessed through a proteomics approach, using two-dimensional electrophoresis followed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight tandem mass spectrometry. A total of 63 differential host proteins were identified in BDV Hu-H1-infected OL cells compared to non-infected OL cells. We found that most changes referred to alterations related to the pentose phosphate pathway, glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism, the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, and glycolysis /gluconeogenesis. By manual querying, two differential proteins were found to be associated with mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signal transduction. Five key signaling proteins of this pathway (i.e., p-Raf, p-MEK, p-ERK1/2, p-RSK, and p-MSK) were selected for Western blotting validation. p-ERK1/2 and p-RSK were found to be significantly up-regulated, and p-MSK was found to be significantly down-regulated in BDV Hu-H1-infected OL cells compared to non-infected OL cell. Although BDV Hu-H1 constitutively activated the ERK–RSK pathway, host cell proliferation and nuclear translocation of activated pERK in BDV Hu-H1-infected OL cells were impaired. These findings indicate that BDV Hu-H1 infection of human oligodendroglial cells significantly perturbs host energy metabolism, activates the downstream ERK–RSK complex of the Raf/MEK/ERK signaling cascade, and disturbs host cell proliferation possibly through impaired nuclear translocation of pERK, a finding which warrants further research.","Liu, X.; Yang, Y.; Zhao, M.; Bode, L.; Zhang, L.; Pan, J.; Lv, L.; Zhan, Y.; Liu, S.; Zhang, L.; Wang, X.; Huang, R.; Zhou, J.; Xie, P.",Neuroscience,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306452214002152; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0306452214002152; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroscience.2014.03.009; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24637096/,114

Adult Pulmonary Medicine,2020-10-08,"Persistent infection of the mouse central nervous system (CNS) with mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) induces a demyelinating disease pathologically similar to multiple sclerosis and is therefore used as a model system. There is little information regarding the host factors that correlate with and contribute to MHV-induced demyelination. Here, we detail the genes and pathways associated with MHV-induced demyelinating disease in the spinal cord. High-throughput sequencing of the host transcriptome revealed that demyelination is accompanied by numerous transcriptional changes indicative of immune infiltration as well as changes in the cytokine milieu and lipid metabolism. We found evidence that a Th1-biased cytokine/chemokine response and eicosanoid-derived inflammation accompany persistent MHV infection and that antigen presentation is ongoing. Interestingly, increased expression of genes involved in lipid transport, processing, and catabolism, including some with known roles in neurodegenerative diseases, coincided with demyelination. Lastly, expression of several genes involved in osteoclast or bone-resident macrophage function, most notably TREM2 and DAP12, was upregulated in persistently infected mouse spinal cord. This study highlights the complexity of the host antiviral response, which accompany MHV-induced demyelination, and further supports previous findings that MHV-induced demyelination is immune-mediated. Interestingly, these data suggest a parallel between bone reabsorption by osteoclasts and myelin debris clearance by microglia in the bone and the CNS, respectively. To our knowledge, this is the first report of using an RNA-seq approach to study the host CNS response to persistent viral infection.","Elliott, Ruth; Li, Fan; Dragomir, Isabelle; Chua, Ming Ming W.; Gregory, Brian D.; Weiss, Susan R.",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0075346; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24058676/,114
656881,Inside the lungs of COVID-19 disease,2020-05-26,"Smoke taint has become a prominent issue for the global wine industry as climate change continues to impact the length and extremity of fire seasons around the world. Although the issue has prompted a surge in research on the subject in recent years, no singular solution has yet been identified that is capable of maintaining the quality of wine made from smoke-affected grapes. In this review, we summarize the main research on smoke taint, the key discoveries, as well as the prevailing uncertainties. We also examine methods for mitigating smoke taint in the vineyard, in the winery, and post production. We assess the effectiveness of remediation methods (proposed and actual) based on available research. Our findings are in agreement with previous studies, suggesting that the most viable remedies for smoke taint are still the commercially available activated carbon fining and reverse osmosis treatments, but that the quality of the final treated wines is fundamentally dependent on the initial severity of the taint. In this review, suggestions for future studies are introduced for improving our understanding of methods that have thus far only been preliminarily investigated. We select regions that have already been subjected to severe wildfires, and therefore subjected to smoke taint (particularly Australia and California) as a case study to inform other wine-producing countries that will likely be impacted in the future and suggest specific data collection and policy implementation actions that should be taken, even in countries that have not yet been impacted by smoke taint. Ultimately, we streamline the available information on the topic of smoke taint, apply it to a global perspective that considers the various stakeholders involved, and provide a launching point for further research on the topic.","Mirabelli-Montan, Ysadora A.; Marangon, Matteo; Graça, Antonio; Mayr Marangon, Christine M.; Wilkinson, Kerry L.",Molecules,https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules26061672; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33802808/,114

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) virus uses angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 in gastrointestinal epithelium as a receptor for entry process. Due to the steroid intake, the COVID-19 virus is present in the patient's gastrointestinal tract for extended period of time. It may therefore increase the possibility of PI in such patients. It is usually asymptomatic, with a clinical spectrum ranging from indolent to life-threatening. Unfortunately, there are no algorithms concerning diagnosis and treatment of PI. AIM OF STUDY: The aim of this study is to highlight the problem of PI induced by COVID-19, especially in high-risk groups such as solid organs recipients.

659070,IAEA consultancy meeting on low-dose radiation for patients and population,2021-08-27,"Different mechanisms forwarded to understand anosmia and ageusia in coronavirus patients are not adequate to explain reversible anosmia and ageusia, which are resolved quickly. In addition, the reason behind the impaired chemesthetic sensations in some coronavirus patients remains unknown. In the present paper it is proposed that SARS-CoV-2 patients suffer from depletion of tryptophan, as ACE2, a key element in the process of absorption of tryptophan from the food, is significantly reduced in the patients as coronavirus uses ACE2 as the receptor to enter the host cells. The tryptophan depletion leads to a deficit of serotonin (5-HT) in SARS-COV-2 patients because tryptophan is the precursor in the synthesis of 5-HT. Such 5-HT deficiency can explain anosmia, ageusia and dysfunctional chemesthesis in COVID-19, given the fact that 5-HT is an important neuromodulator in the olfactory neurons, taste receptor cells and transient receptor potential channels (TRP channels) involved in chemesthesis. In addition, 5-HT deficiency worsens silent hypoxemia and depresses hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction leading to increased severity of the disease. Also, the levels of anti-inflammatory melatonin (synthesized from 5-HT) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD(+), produced from niacin whose precursor is the tryptophan) might decrease in coronavirus patients resulting in the aggravation of the disease. Interestingly, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) may not be of much help in correcting the 5-HT deficiency in COVID-19 patients, as their efficacy goes down significantly when there is depletion of tryptophan in the system. Hence, tryptophan supplementation may herald a radical change in the treatment of COVID-19 and accordingly, clinical trials (therapeutic / prophylactic) should be conducted on coronavirus patients to find out how tryptophan supplementation (oral or parenteral, the latter in severe cases where there is hardly any absorption of tryptophan from the food) helps in curing, relieving or preventing the olfactory, gustatory and chemesthetic dysfunctions and in lessening the severity of the disease.","Sen, Amarnath",Med Hypotheses,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306987721001468?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34139598/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0306987721001468; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mehy.2021.110627,114

Established inclusion criteria were used to screening articles, subsequently evaluate the quality of the included studies, Stata 16.0 PM and RevMan 5.3 software were conducted for meta-analysis. The pooled odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) was determined to assess the relationship between MTHFR and risk of URPL in Chinese women. RESULTS: For MTHFR C677T, fifty studies were included, involving 6677 URPL cases and 8111 controls. The overall results showed that MTHFR C677T was significantly correlated with URPL risk, especially in the homozygous model (TT vs CC; OR 3.06; 95% CI 2.56–3.66). For MTHFR A1298C, twenty-first studies were included, involving 3439 URPL cases and 3155 controls. The results showed that MTHFR A1298C was also significantly correlated with URPL risk in recessive (CC vs AC + AA; OR 1.55; 95% CI 1.25–1.93) and homozygous (CC vs AA; OR 1.53; 95% CI 1.22–1.91) models. In addition, sub-group results showed that no significant difference between north and south China populations in the MTHFR gene polymorphisms and URPL risk. Of note, the patients carrying MTHFR C677T and MTHFR A1298C joint mutants had no synergistic effect (OR 2.71; 95% CI 0.84–8.70) on the occurrence of URPL compared with the wild-type homozygous genotype (MTHFR 677CC/ MTHFR 1298AA). CONCLUSION: Studies included in this meta-analysis suggested that MTHFR 677T allele and 677TT genotype and MTHFR 1298CC genotype were both associated with URPL; testing MTHFR C677T gene polymorphism was a more appropriate target compared with other mutations in the prediction of URPL.","Wang, Genzhu; Lin, Zhaohui; Wang, Xiaoying; Sun, Qiang; Xun, Zhikun; Xing, Baiqian; Li, Zhongdong",Medicine (Baltimore),https://doi.org/10.1097/md.0000000000025487; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33907097/,114

Forty samples were collected at different time points during the outbreak, and parts of the SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence were used to assess genomic variation patterns. The phylogenetics of the 40 samples were clustered into L, GH, GR, O and T types. T types were predominant in Bangkok during the first local outbreak centered at a boxing stadium and entertainment venues in March 2020. Imported cases were infected with various types, including L, GH, GR and O. In southern Thailand introductions of different genotypes were identified at different times. No clinical parameters were significantly associated with differences in genotype. The results indicated local transmission (type T, Spike protein (A829T)) and imported cases (types L, GH, GR and O) during the first wave in Thailand. Genetic and epidemiological data may contribute to national policy formulation, transmission tracking and the implementation of measures to control viral spread.","Puenpa, Jiratchaya; Suwannakarn, Kamol; Chansaenroj, Jira; Nilyanimit, Pornjarim; Yorsaeng, Ritthideach; Auphimai, Chompoonut; Kitphati, Rungrueng; Mungaomklang, Anek; Kongklieng, Amornmas; Chirathaworn, Chintana; Wanlapakorn, Nasamon; Poovorawan, Yong",Sci Rep,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-73554-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33024144/,114

660459,A nephroprotective iodinated contrast agent with cardioprotective properties: A pilot study,2021-05-12,"The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been spreading rapidly all over the world and has raised grave concern globally. The present research aims to conduct a robust base compositional analysis of SARS-CoV-2 to reveal adaptive intricacies to the human host. Multivariate statistical analysis revealed a complex interplay of various factors including compositional constraint, natural selection, length of viral coding sequences, hydropathicity, and aromaticity of the viral gene products that are operational to codon usage patterns, with compositional bias being the most crucial determinant. UpG and CpA dinucleotides were found to be highly preferred whereas, CpG dinucleotide was mostly avoided in SARS-CoV-2, a pattern consistent with the human host. Strict avoidance of the CpG dinucleotide might be attributed to a strategy for evading a human immune response. A lower degree of adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 to the human host, compared to Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus and SARS-CoV, might be indicative of its milder clinical severity and progression contrasted to SARS and MERS. Similar patterns of enhanced adaptation between viral isolates from intermediate and human hosts, contrasted with those isolated from the natural bat reservoir, signifies an indispensable role of the intermediate host in transmission dynamics and spillover events of the virus to human populations. The information regarding avoided codon pairs in SARS-CoV-2, as conferred by the present analysis, promises to be useful for the design of vaccines employing codon pair deoptimization based synthetic attenuated virus engineering.","Roy, Ayan; Guo, Fucheng; Singh, Bhupender; Gupta, Shelly; Paul, Karan; Chen, Xiaoyuan; Sharma, Neeta Raj; Jaishee, Nishika; Irwin, David M.; Shen, Yongyi",Front Microbiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33889134/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2021.548275,114

661642,Modalities to restrain the progression of oral potentially malignant diseases and oral squamous cell carcinoma in COVID-19 pandemic,2020-11-10,"Rapamycin and its derivatives are specific inhibitors of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) kinase and, as a result, are well-established immunosuppressants and antitumorigenic agents. Additionally, this class of drug promotes gene delivery by facilitating lentiviral vector entry into cells, revealing its potential to improve gene therapy efforts. However, the precise mechanism was unknown. Here, we report that mTOR inhibitor treatment results in down-regulation of the IFN-induced transmembrane (IFITM) proteins. IFITM proteins, especially IFITM3, are potent inhibitors of virus–cell fusion and are broadly active against a range of pathogenic viruses. We found that the effect of rapamycin treatment on lentiviral transduction is diminished upon IFITM silencing or knockout in primary and transformed cells, and the extent of transduction enhancement depends on basal expression of IFITM proteins, with a major contribution from IFITM3. The effect of rapamycin treatment on IFITM3 manifests at the level of protein, but not mRNA, and is selective, as many other endosome-associated transmembrane proteins are unaffected. Rapamycin-mediated degradation of IFITM3 requires endosomal trafficking, ubiquitination, endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) machinery, and lysosomal acidification. Since IFITM proteins exhibit broad antiviral activity, we show that mTOR inhibition also promotes infection by another IFITM-sensitive virus, Influenza A virus, but not infection by Sendai virus, which is IFITM-resistant. Our results identify the molecular basis by which mTOR inhibitors enhance virus entry into cells and reveal a previously unrecognized immunosuppressive feature of these clinically important drugs. In addition, this study uncovers a functional convergence between the mTOR pathway and IFITM proteins at endolysosomal membranes.","Shi, Guoli; Ozog, Stosh; Torbett, Bruce E.; Compton, Alex A.",Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30301809/; https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1811892115,114

663059,The Quandary of DNA-Based Treatment Assessment in De Novo Metastatic Prostate Cancer in the Era of Precision Oncology,2021-04-22,"Doping and the use of performance enhancing drugs (PEDs) are often considered and discussed as a separate issue from other types of substance use, by sporting bodies, politicians, the media, and athletes who use drugs themselves. However, perceptions and understandings of substance use in the sport and fitness world are directly related to those of substance use in the non-sport world. One way the gap between sport and non-sport substance use research can be bridged is to consider sport risk and enabling environments. Similar to non-sport contexts and drug use, it is important to analyse the environments in which doping occurs. This approach allows us to examine the dynamic interplay between risk and enabling factors, as the enabling environment shifts in response to changes produced in the risk environment, and vice versa. There are models of sport environments that have proven effective at both enabling doping by athletes and reducing harms to athletes: systematic doping. This article will use secondary literature in order to review and analyse known cases of systematic doping through the risk and enabling environment frameworks. We argue that these systems responded to anti-doping in ways that protected athletes from the risk factors established by anti-doping policy and that athletes suffered most when these systems were revealed, exposing athletes to the full range of doping harms. Further, we argue that risks within these systems (i.e. extortion, bullying) resulted from the broader prohibitive sport environment that forces doping underground and allows such abuses to occur.","Henning, April; McLean, Katherine; Andreasson, Jesper; Dimeo, Paul",Int J Drug Policy,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095539592030236X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32768155/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S095539592030236X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.drugpo.2020.102897,114
663174,How to choose an abdominal imaging fellowship,2021-06-23,"Pandemics have a profound impact on our world, causing loss of life, affecting our culture and historically shaping our genetics. The response to a pandemic requires both resilience and imagination. It has been clearly documented that obtaining an accurate estimate and trends of the actual infection rate and mortality risk are very important for policy makers and medical professionals. One cannot estimate mortality rates without an accurate assessment of the number of infected individuals in the population. This need is also aligned with identifying the infected individuals so they can be properly treated, monitored and tracked. However, accurate estimation of the infection rate, locally, geographically and nationally is important independently. These infection rate estimates can guide policy makers at both state, national or world level to achieve a better management of risk to society. The decisions facing policy makers are very different during early stages of an emerging epidemic where the infection rate is low, middle stages where the rate is rapidly climbing, and later stages where the epidemic curve has flattened to a low and relatively sustainable rate. In this paper we provide relatively efficient pooling methods to both estimate infection rates and identify infected individuals for populations with low infection rates. These estimates may provide significant cost reductions for testing in rural communities, third world countries and other situations where the cost of testing is expensive or testing is not widely available. As we prepare for the second wave of the pandemic this line of work may provide new solutions for both the biomedical community and policy makers at all levels.","Beigel, R.; Kasif, S.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.22.20110585v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.22.20110585,114

664782,Persistent High Percentage of HLA-DR(+)CD38(high) CD8(+) T Cells Associated With Immune Disorder and Disease Severity of COVID-19,2021-09-09,"Background: COVID-19 induces progressive hypoxemic respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome, mostly due to a dysregulated inflammatory response. Since the first observations of COVID-19 patients, significant hypoalbuminemia was detected. This study aimed to investigate the hypothesis that hypoalbuminemia in COVID-19 patients is due to pulmonary capillary leakage and to test its correlation with indicators of respiratory function. Methods: 174 COVID-19 patients, 92 admitted to the Intermediate Medicine ward (IMW), and 82 to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) at Luigi Sacco Hospital in Milan were included in this study. Findings: Serum albumin concentration was decreased in the whole cohort, with ICU patients displaying lower values than IMW patients [20 (18-23) vs 28 (24-33) g/L, p<0.0001]. Lower albumin values were found in patients belonging to a more compromised group (lower PaO2 to FiO2 ratio and worst chest X-ray findings). In a subset of 26 patients, analysis of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) highlighted high protein concentrations, which were correlated to Interleukin-8 and Interleukin-10 BALF concentration. The length of hospitalisation [20 (15-29) vs 8 (5-14) days, p<0.0001] and death rate (52.4% vs 21.7%, p<0.0001) were higher in ICU than in IMW patients, while a strict relation between hypoalbuminemia and 30 day-survival was detected in the whole cohort. Electron microscopy examinations of eight out of ten autopsy lung tissues showed diffuse loosening of interendothelial junctional complex. Interpretation: The degree of hypoalbuminemia can be considered as a useful severity marker in hospitalised COVID-19 patients. Pulmonary capillary leak syndrome secondary to the hyperinflammatory state plays a key role in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 respiratory dysfunction and should be regarded as a therapeutic target.","Wu, M.

The progression of COVID-19 is related to an excessive host inflammatory immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection, which is considered a major cause of disease severity and death. Dysregulated immune response produces huge amounts of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines called ""cytokine storm"". Moreover, the activation of microthrombi formation plays an important role in multiple organ failure. METHODS: Keeping into consideration the potent anti-inflammatory activity of black seed and its major constituent Thymoquinone (TQ), we hypothesize their potential implication in the treatment of COVID-19 patients. A literature search was performed in PubMed, ScienceDirect, Google Scholar and Scopus electronic databases using the terms, including black seed, N. sativa, thymoquinone, SARSCoV- 2, COVID-19 and inflammatory immune response. RESULTS: Various studies confirmed that Black seed and TQ reduced the thrombus formation, the expression of tissue factor and the immune activation. Furthermore, TQ demonstrated the broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity that may be effective in controlling the secondary infections in COVID-19 patients. CONCLUSION: Keeping into consideration the multi-targeting nature of the black seed and TQ, they may be used as a potential therapeutic formulation or as an adjunct therapy in the treatment of COVID-19 patients.","Khan, Masood Alam; Younus, Hina",Curr Pharm Biotechnol,https://doi.org/10.2174/1389201021999201110205048; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33176642/,114

We aimed to investigate the role of peripheral blood eosinophil (EOS) as a marker in the course of the virus infection to improve the efficiency of diagnosis and evaluation of COVID‐19 patients. METHODS: 227 pneumonia patients who visited the fever clinics in Shanghai General Hospital and 97 hospitalized COVID‐19 patients admitted to Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center were involved in a retrospective research study. Clinical, laboratory, and radiologic data were collected. The trend of EOS level in COVID‐19 patients and comparison among patients with different severity were summarized. RESULTS: The majority of COVID‐19 patients (71.7%) had a decrease in circulating EOS counts, which was significantly more frequent than other types of pneumonia patients. EOS counts had good value for COVID‐19 prediction, even higher when combined with NLR. Patients with low EOS counts at admission were more likely to have fever, fatigue and shortness of breath, with more lesions in chest CT and radiographic aggravation, longer length of hospital stay and course of disease than those with normal EOS counts. Circulating EOS level gradually increased over the time, and was synchronous with the improvement of chest CT(12days vs 13days, P=0.07), later than that of body temperature(12days vs 10days, P=0.014), but was earlier than the negative conversion of nucleic acid assays(12days vs 17days, P=0.001).

Concerns about the susceptibility of humans that have already been infected before or those already vaccinated to infection by VOC rise among scientists and clinicians. Herein, we assessed the prevalence of different VOC among recent infections at the Brazilian National Cancer Institute (Rio de Janeiro, Brazil). By using a Sanger-based sequencing approach targeting the viral S gene to identify VOC, we have analyzed 72 recent infections. The overall prevalence of VOC was 97%. Among the subjects analyzed, six had been vaccinated with the ChAdOx1-S/nCoV-19 (n = 4; one with two doses and three with one dose) or the CoronaVac (n = 2; both with 2 doses) vaccine, while five subjects represented reinfection cases, being two of them also part of the vaccinated group (each one with one vaccine type). All vaccinated and re-infected subjects carried VOC irrespective of the vaccine type taken, the number of doses taken, IgG titers or being previously infected during the first wave of the Brazilian pandemic.

These restrictions provided a unique opportunity to quantify the degree to which anthropogenic noise contributes to and impacts underwater soundscapes. In Guadeloupe, French West Indies, a significantly lower number of motor boats were recorded in the vicinity of the major urban marina during the peak of the first COVID-19 lockdown (April-May 2020), compared with the number recorded post-lockdown. The resumption of human activities at the end of May was correlated with a maximum increase of 6 decibels in the ambient noise level underwater. The change in noise level did not impact daily sound production patterns of vocal fishes, with increased activity at dusk seen both during and after the lockdown period. However, during the lockdown vocal activity was comprised of a reduced number of sounds, suggesting that anthropogenic noise has the potential to interfere with vocalization behaviours in fishes.","Bertucci, Frédéric; Lecchini, David; Greeven, Céline; Brooker, Rohan M; Minier, Lana; Cordonnier, Sébastien; René-Trouillefou, Malika; Parmentier, Eric",Environ Pollut,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34375848/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2021.117898,114

The article focuses on the meaning that was attached to the concept and to the ways of being together that it encapsulated and stipulated. Where support bubbles were formalised as a matter of law, as in New Zealand and the UK, a particular form of relating was legally constructed and real relationships were affected through law. The article addresses the meaning and implications of the concept of the support bubble in this light. First, it considers the concept of the support bubble as a new legal form, which drew in, and built on, a range of relationships and then recast them in terms of a new legal form. Second, it analyses the central question posed by the concept as one of the meaning of being together in a support bubble, not only for those navigating and living with the concept in practice, but also as mediated in and through law. Third, it outlines how the concept of the support bubble represented a distinct legal development. It enabled those who were eligible to define for themselves, albeit within a specified framework, the meaning and nature of a relationship of support of this kind.

One of these, human coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43), is a well-matched surrogate for SARS-CoV-2 because it is also a Betacoronavirus, targets the human respiratory system, is transmitted via respiratory aerosols and droplets and is relatively resistant to disinfectants. Unfortunately, growth of HCoV-OC43 in the recommended human colon cancer (HRT-18) cells does not produce obvious cytopathic effect (CPE) and its titration in these cells requires expensive antibody-based detection. Consequently, multiple quantification approaches for HCoV-OC43 using alternative cell lines exist, which complicates comparison of research results. Hence, we investigated the basic growth parameters of HCoV-OC43 infection in three of these cell lines (HRT-18, human lung fibroblasts (MRC-5) and African green monkey kidney (Vero E6) cells) including the differential development of cytopathic effect (CPE) and explored reducing the cost, time and complexity of antibody-based detection assay. Multi-step growth curves were conducted in each cell type in triplicate at a multiplicity of infection of 0.1 with daily sampling for seven days. Samples were quantified by tissue culture infectious dose(50)(TCID(50))/mL or plaque assay (cell line dependent) and additionally analyzed on the Sartorius Virus Counter 3100 (VC), which uses flow virometry to count the total number of intact virus particles in a sample. We improved the reproducibility of a previously described antibody-based detection based TCID(50) assay by identifying commercial sources for antibodies, decreasing antibody concentrations and simplifying the detection process. The growth curves demonstrated that HCoV-O43 grown in MRC-5 cells reached a peak titer of ˜10(7) plaque forming units/mL at two days post infection (dpi). In contrast, HCoV-OC43 grown on HRT-18 cells required six days to reach a peak titer of ˜10(6.5) TCID(50)/mL. HCoV-OC43 produced CPE in Vero E6 cells but these growth curve samples failed to produce CPE in a plaque assay after four days. Analysis of the VC data in combination with plaque and TCID(50) assays together revealed that the defective:infectious virion ratio of MRC-5 propagated HCoV-OC43 was less than 3:1 for 1-6 dpi while HCoV-OC43 propagated in HRT-18 cells varied from 41:1 at 1 dpi, to 329:4 at 4 dpi to 94:1 at 7 dpi.

668547,Response to mRNA vaccination for COVID-19 among patients with multiple myeloma,2021-07-29,"A severe outbreak of enteric and respiratory disease associated with bovine coronavirus (BCoV) infection is described. The outbreak occurred in a dairy herd of southern Italy in the first decade of September 2006, when summer temperatures were still recorded, affecting calves, heifers and adult cows, with a marked decrease in milk production. By virus isolation and RT-PCR targeting the S gene, BCoV was identified as the etiological agent of the outbreak, whereas bacteriological, parasitological and toxicological investigations failed to detect other causes of disease. BCoV strains with 99–100% nucleotide identity in the S gene were isolated from nasal, ocular and rectal swabs, thus proving the absence of separate clusters of virus on the basis of tissue tropism. Sequence analysis of the haemagglutination-esterase and spike proteins of the strain detected in one rectal sample (339/06) showed a high genetic relatedness with recent BCoV isolates (98–99% amino acid identity), with several unique amino acid substitutions in the S protein. The BCoV outbreak described in this paper presents interesting aspects: (i) the occurrence of a severe form of disease in the warmer season; (ii) the simultaneous presence of respiratory and enteric disease; (iii) the involvement of young as well as adult cattle.","Decaro, Nicola; Mari, Viviana; Desario, Costantina; Campolo, Marco; Elia, Gabriella; Martella, Vito; Greco, Grazia; Cirone, Francesco; Colaianni, Maria Loredana; Cordioli, Paolo; Buonavoglia, Canio",Vet Microbiol,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378113507003203; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378113507003203; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17669602/,114

Caliciviruses are important human and animal pathogens and, as observed for human noroviruses, they may impact on human health on a global scale. By screening fecal samples of bats in Hungary, calicivirus RNA was identified in the samples of Myotis daubentonii and Eptesicus serotinus bats. In order to characterize more in detail the bat caliciviruses, large portions of the genome sequence of the viruses were determined. Phylogenetic analyses and molecular modeling identified firmly the two viruses as candidate members within the Caliciviridae family, with one calicivirus strain resembling members of the Sapovirus genus and the other bat calicivirus being more related to porcine caliciviruses of the proposed genus Valovirus.

Despite the ongoing controversies, HCQ was recommended for managing mild to moderate cases in Saudi Arabia . However, to our knowledge, no previous studies have been conducted in Saudi Arabia to assess its effectiveness. Methods A hospital-based retrospective cohort study involving 161 patients with COVID-19 was conducted from March 1 to May 20, 2020. The study was conducted at Prince Mohammed bin Abdul Aziz Hospital (PMAH). The population included hospitalized adults (age ≥18 years) with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. Each eligible patient was followed from the time of admission until the time of discharge. Patients were classified into two groups according to treatment type: in the HCQ group, patients were treated with HCQ; in the SC group, patients were treated with other antiviral or antibacterial treatments according to Ministry of Health (MOH) protocols The outcomes were hospitalization days, ICU admission, and the need for mechanical ventilation. We estimated the differences in hospital length of stay and time in the ICU between the HCQ group and the standard care (SC) group using a multivariate generalized linear regression. The differences in ICU admission and mechanical ventilation were compared via logistic regression. All models were adjusted for age and gender variables. Results A total of 161 patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Approximately 59% (n=95) received HCQ-based treatment, and 41% (n=66) received SC. Length of hospital stay and time in ICU in for patients who received HCQ based treatment was shorter than those who received SC. Similarly, there was less need for ICU admission and mechanical ventilation among patients who received HCQ based treatment compared with SC, (8.6% vs. 10.7 and 3.1% vs. 9.1%). However, the regression analysis showed no significant difference between the two groups in terms of patient outcomes. Conclusion HCQ had a modest effect on hospital length stay and days in ICU compared with SC. However, these results need to be interpreted with caution. Larger observational studies and RCTs that evaluate the efficacy of HCQ in COVID-19 patients in the Saudi population are urgently needed.","Almazrou, Saja H.; Almalki, Ziyad S.; Alanazi, Abdullah S; Alqahtani, Abdulhadi M.; AlGhamd, Saleh M.",Saudi Pharm J,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsps.2020.09.019; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1319016420302334?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33020690/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1319016420302334,114

The worldwide outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has elevated these concerns due to increased risk factors pertaining to social, family, economic, and health stressors, in addition to changes to typical routines and support systems. Unfortunately, there are many barriers to at-risk youth being able to access evidence-based mental health services including cost, lack of trained providers, transportation issues, and physical distancing due to the pandemic. Providing school-based prevention and intervention programs that promote social, emotional, and behavioral well-being helps to address many of these barriers. This article highlights important considerations to providing these services in a school-based telehealth modality. Symptom clusters that put youth at risk of harm to self are described. Best practice therapeutic modalities that can be disseminated in a school-based telehealth modality, such as cognitive behavior therapy, dialectical behavior therapy, and mindfulness-based approaches, are reviewed. Although there is growing empirical literature for these school-based prevention and intervention approaches, additional research is needed to determine how to best support at-risk youth remotely.","Holland, Melissa; Hawks, Jessica; Morelli, Lauren C.; Khan, Zainab",Contemp Sch Psychol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33425481/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s40688-020-00341-6,114

The psychiatric emergency department (ED) plays a key role during this mental health crisis. This study aimed to investigate differences in admissions at a Swiss psychiatric ED from 1 April to 15 May during a “pandemic-free” period in 2016 and a “during-pandemic” period in 2020. The study included 579 consultations at psychiatric ED in the “during-pandemic” period and 702 in the “pandemic-free” period. Sociodemographic and clinical characteristics were compared, and logistic regression analysis was performed to identify variables associated with psychiatric admissions during the pandemic. A reduction in total psychiatric ED admissions was documented during COVID-19. Logistic regression analysis predicted the independent variable (ED admission during the pandemic) and estimated odds ratio (OR) for being unmarried/not in a relationship, arrival in an ambulance, suicidal behavior, behavioral disorders and psychomotor agitation. Though only statistically significant in bivariate analysis, patients were also more likely to be involuntarily hospitalized. This picture appears to be reversed from a sociodemographic and clinical point of view to our observation of psychiatric ED consultation in 2016. These findings highlight that the reduction in psychiatric ED admissions during the pandemic seems to be associated with living alone and more severe psychopathologies, which must alert psychiatrists to ensure access to mental health care in times of pandemic.","Ambrosetti, Julia; Macheret, Laura; Folliet, Aline; Wullschleger, Alexandre; Amerio, Andrea; Aguglia, Andrea; Serafini, Gianluca; Prada, Paco; Kaiser, Stefan; Bondolfi, Guido; Sarasin, François; Costanza, Alessandra",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18031174; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33525740/,114
674335,Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency: Home Therapy,2021-04-15,"During the past two years, the world has been ravaged by a global pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Acquired mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 genome affecting virus infectivity and/or immunogenicity have led to a number of novel strains with higher transmissibility compared to the original Wuhan strain. Mutations in the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein have been extensively studied in this context. However, mutations and deletions within the N-terminal domain (NTD) located adjacent to the RBD are less studied. Many of these are found within certain β sheet-linking loops, which are surprisingly long in SARS-CoV-2 in comparison to SARS-CoV and other related β coronaviruses. Here, we perform a structural and epidemiological study of novel strains carrying mutations and deletions within these loops. We identify short and long-distance interactions that stabilize the NTD loops of the spike protein and form a critical epitope that is essential for the recognition by a wide variety of neutralizing antibodies from convalescent plasma. Among the different mutations/deletions found in these loops, Ala 67 and Asp 80 mutations as well as His 69/Val 70 and Tyr 144 deletions have been identified in different fast-spreading strains. Similarly, deletions in amino acids 241-243 and 246-252 have been found to affect the network of NTD loops in strains with high transmissibility. Our structural findings provide insight regarding the role of these mutations/deletions in altering the epitope structure and thus affecting the immunoreactivity of the NTD region of spike protein.","Klinakis, Apostolos; Cournia, Zoe; Rampias, Theodoros",Comput Struct Biotechnol J,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2001037021004268; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2001037021004268?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.csbj.2021.10.004; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34630935/,114

Currently, the predictive value of body temperature for acute infection is inhibited by failure to account for other readily available variables that affect temperature values. In this proof-of-concept study, we sought to improve COVID-19 pretest probability estimation by incorporating covariates known to be associated with body temperature, including patient age, sex, comorbidities, month, and time of day. METHODS: For patients discharged from an academic hospital emergency department after testing for COVID-19 in March and April of 2020, we abstracted clinical data. We reviewed physician documentation to retrospectively generate estimates of pretest probability for COVID-19. Using patients' COVID-19 PCR test results as a gold standard, we compared AUCs of logistic regression models predicting COVID-19 positivity that used: (1) body temperature alone; (2) body temperature and pretest probability; (3) body temperature, pretest probability, and body temperature-relevant covariates. Calibration plots and bootstrap validation were used to assess predictive performance for model #3. RESULTS: Data from 117 patients were included. The models' AUCs were: (1) 0.69 (2) 0.72, and (3) 0.76, respectively. The absolute difference in AUC was 0.029 (95% CI -0.057 to 0.114, p=0.25) between model 2 and 1 and 0.038 (95% CI -0.021 to 0.097, p=0.10) between model 3 and 2.

The cross-sectional data were collected using the time-lag design to avoid the common method bias as much as possible. Regression results using structural equation modeling show that the internalized stigmatization of epicenter travel experiences may have positive relationships with mental health problems (i.e., anxiety, depression, and shame), and such relationships can be moderated by social support. Specifically, the positive relationships between internalized stigmatization and mental health problems are buffered/strengthened when social support is at a high/low level.

In this context, the International Labour Organization (ILO) has focused on Special Economic Zones (SEZ), especially, the so-called Export Processing Zones (EPZ). It is common for developing countries to attract investors by offering special framework conditions, for example, the granting of tax holidays and the repeal of national labour protection laws (in cases where such laws exist). In recognition of this practice, many years ago the ILO developed compliance guidelines on “decent work.” In this paper, Juan Carlos Hiba addresses this issue from the ILO’s perspective. Marina Jentsch discusses why the topic is still relevant by comparing developments (or lack thereof) in recent years and uses data from the textile industry to illustrate certain points. The World Trade Organization (WTO) and some regional trade agreements increasingly show a trend to restrict the use of subsidies and countervailing measures and provide rules addressing the special treatment of free trade zones and their incentive systems. In the final section, Klaus J. Zink discusses the future of these zones in light of the increasing criticism levelled at the ecological impacts of production and the working and living conditions of workers.

Also, data from Mexico are hospitable population-based without signs and symptoms information. For these reasons, this work aims to provide epidemiology information about the burden of COVID-19 in the Mexican outpatients and to identify symptomatic COVID-19 profiles that could help in the early diagnosis of the disease. METHODS: Between June to September, epidemiological, clinical, and demographic data of 482,413 individuals diagnosed by RT-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 in Salud Digna clinics were collected. RESULTS: We observed a 41% incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infections with a mean age of 36 years, being young adults (20-40 years) the most affected. Among occupations, deliverers (OR 1.38) or informal traders (OR 1.33) had a higher risk of COVID-19. Moreover, 13% of SARS-CoV-2 infections were in presymptomatic patients. Finally, we identify three different symptomatic profiles (common, respiratory, and gastrointestinal) associated with COVID-19. CONCLUSION: The incidence of SARS-CoV-2 was high among outpatients with a significant proportion of presymptomatic carriers, so it is necessary increasing testing and continue the SARS-CoV-2 surveillance with a better description of signs and symptoms; in this regard, were identified three symptomatic profiles that could help in the diagnose of COVID-19.","Fernández-Rojas, Miguel A.; Esparza, Marco A.

Aims: To examine characteristics of NHs across three Community Health Organisations (CHOs) in Ireland, proportions with COVID-19 outbreaks, staff and resident, symptom-profile and resident case-fatality. Methods: Forty-five NHs surveyed across three CHOs requesting details on occupancy, size, COVID-19 outbreak, timing of outbreak, total symptomatic/asymptomatic cases, and outcomes for residents from 29/02/2020-22/05/2020. Results: Surveys were returned from (62.2%, 28/45) of NHs (2043 residents, 2303 beds). Three-quarters (21/28) had COVID-19 outbreaks (1741 residents, 1972 beds). Median time from first case of COVID-19 in Ireland to first case in these NHs was 27.0 days. Resident COVID-19 incidence was (43.9%, 764/1741): laboratory-confirmed (40.1%, 710/1741) with (27.2%, 193/710 asymptomatic), and clinically-suspected (3.1%, 54/1741). Resident case-fatality was (27.6%, 211/764) for combined laboratory-confirmed/clinically-suspected COVID-19. Similar proportions of residents in NH with an early outbreak (<28days) versus a later outbreak developed confirmed/suspected COVID-19. A lower proportion of residents in NHs with early outbreaks had recovered compared to those with late outbreaks (37.4% vs 61.7%; X2=56.9, p<0.001). Among 675 NH staff across twenty-four sites who had confirmed/suspected COVID-19 (23.6%, 159/675) were asymptomatic. There was a significant correlation between the proportion of staff with symptomatic COVID-19 and resident numbers with confirmed/suspected COVID-19 (Spearmans rho=0.81, p<0.001).

Patients who survive the acute phase of sepsis display long-term impairments in immune function due to reductions in numbers and function of many immune cell populations. This state of chronic immunoparalysis renders sepsis survivors increasingly susceptible to infection with newly or previously encountered infections. CD4 T cells play important roles in the development of cellular and humoral immune responses following infection. Understanding how sepsis impacts the CD4 T cell compartment is critical for informing efforts to develop treatments intended to restore immune system homeostasis following sepsis. This review will focus on the current understanding of how sepsis impacts the CD4 T cell responses, including numerical representation, repertoire diversity, phenotype and effector functionality, subset representation (e.g., Th1 and Treg frequency), and therapeutic efforts to restore CD4 T cell numbers and function following sepsis. Additionally, we will discuss recent efforts to model the acute sepsis phase and resulting immune dysfunction using mice that have previously encountered infection, which more accurately reflects the immune system of humans with a history of repeated infection throughout life. A thorough understanding of how sepsis impacts CD4 T cells based on previous studies and new models that accurately reflect the human immune system may improve translational value of research aimed at restoring CD4 T cell-mediated immunity, and overall immune fitness following sepsis.","Martin, Matthew D.; Badovinac, Vladimir P.; Griffith, Thomas S.",Front Immunol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2020.01364; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32733454/,114

There are many described protocols for the purification of microbially-produced viral protein in the literature, however, they suffer from inherent limitations in efficiency, scalability and overall process costs. In this study, we investigated alternative purification pathways to identify and optimise a suitable purification pathway to overcome some of the current challenges. Among the methods, the optimised purification strategy consists of an anion exchange step in flow through mode followed by a multi modal cation exchange step in bind and elute mode. This approach allows an integrated process without any buffer adjustment between the purification steps. The major contaminants like host cell proteins, DNA and aggregates can be efficiently removed by the optimised strategy, without the need for a size exclusion polishing chromatography step, which otherwise could complicate the process scalability and increase overall cost. High throughput process technology studies were conducted to optimise binding and elution conditions for multi modal cation exchanger, Capto™ MMC and strong anion exchanger Capto™ Q. A dynamic binding capacity of 14 mg ml(−1) was achieved for Capto™ MMC resin. Samples derived from each purification process were thoroughly characterized by RP-HPLC, SEC-HPLC, SDS-PAGE and LC-ESI-MS/MS Mass Spectrometry analytical methods. Modular polyomavirus major capsid protein could be purified within hours using the optimised process achieving purities above 87% and above 96% with inclusion of an initial precipitation step. Purified capsid protein could be easily assembled in-vitro into well-defined virus-like particles by lowering pH with addition of calcium chloride to the eluate. High throughout studies allowed the screening of a vast design space within weeks, rather than months, and unveiled complicated binding behaviour for Capto(TM) MMC.","Gerstweiler, Lukas; Billakanti, Jagan; Bi, Jingxiu; Middelberg, Anton",J Chromatogr A,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0021967321000480; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2021.461924; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33545579/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021967321000480?v=s5,114

After that, on 30 January 2020, it was officially declared as a global pandemic by World Health Organization (WHO). The International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) recognized it as a Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the disease named Coronavirus Disease-19 (COVID-19). Several studies have been ameliorated the active role of COVID-19 transmission, etiology, pathogenicity, and mortality rate as serious impact on human life. The symptoms of this disease may include fever, fatigue, cough and some peoples are severely prone to gastrointestinal infection. The elderly and seriously affected peoples are likely concerned with serious outcomes.

678258,Utility of Stool PCR for the Diagnosis of COVID-19: Comparison of Two Commercial Platforms,2020-08-24,"BACKGROUND: Safe and effective decontamination and reuse of N95 filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs) has the potential to significantly extend FFR holdings, mitigating a potential shortage due to an influenza pandemic or other pandemic events. Ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI) has been shown to be effective for decontaminating influenza-contaminated FFRs. This study aims to build on past research by evaluating the UVGI decontamination efficiency of influenza-contaminated FFRs in the presence of soiling agents using an optimized UVGI dose. METHODS: Twelve samples each of 15 N95 FFR models were contaminated with H1N1 influenza (facepiece and strap), then covered with a soiling agent—artificial saliva or artificial skin oil. For each soiling agent, 3 contaminated FFRs were treated with 1 J/cm(2) UVGI for approximately 1 minute, whereas 3 other contaminated FFRs remained untreated. All contaminated surfaces were cut out and virus extracted. Viable influenza was quantified using a median tissue culture infectious dose assay. RESULTS: Significant reductions (≥3 log) in influenza viability for both soiling conditions were observed on facepieces from 12 of 15 FFR models and straps from 7 of 15 FFR models. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that FFR decontamination and reuse using UVGI can be effective. Implementation of a UVGI method will require careful consideration of FFR model, material type, and design.","Mills, Devin; Harnish, Delbert A.; Lawrence, Caryn; Sandoval-Powers, Megan; Heimbuch, Brian K.",Am J Infect Control,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajic.2018.02.018; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0196655318301408; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0196655318301408; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29678452/,114
678800,COVID-19: a recommendation to examine the effect of hydroxychloroquine in preventing infection and progression,2020-03-20,"Crises lay bare the social fault lines of society. In the United States, race, gender, age, and education have affected vulnerability to COVID-19 infection. Yet, consequences likely extend far beyond morbidity and mortality. Temporarily closing the economy sent shock waves through communities, raising the possibility that social inequities, preexisting and current, have weakened economic resiliency and reinforced disadvantage, especially among groups most devastated by the Great Recession. We address pandemic precarity, or risk for material and financial insecurity, in Indiana, where manufacturing loss is high, metro areas ranked among the hardest hit by the Great Recession nationally, and health indicators stand in the bottom quintile. Using longitudinal data (n = 994) from the Person to Person Health Interview Study, fielded in 2019–2020 and again during Indiana’s initial stay-at-home order, we provide a representative, probability-based assessment of adverse economic outcomes of the pandemic. Survey-weighted multivariate regressions, controlling for preexisting inequality, find Black adults over 3 times as likely as Whites to report food insecurity, being laid off, or being unemployed. Residents without a college degree are twice as likely to report food insecurity (compared to some college), while those not completing high school (compared to bachelor’s degree) are 4 times as likely to do so. Younger adults and women were also more likely to report economic hardships. Together, the results support contentions of a Matthew Effect, where pandemic precarity disproportionately affects historically disadvantaged groups, widening inequality. Strategically deployed relief efforts and longer-term policy reforms are needed to challenge the perennial and unequal impact of disasters.","Perry, Brea L.; Aronson, Brian; Pescosolido, Bernice A.",Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33547252/; https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2020685118,114
678813,Equitable distribution of COVID-19 vaccines,2021-01-31,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has drastically changed the lives of countless members of the general population. Older adults are known to experience loneliness, age discrimination, and excessive worry. It is therefore reasonable to anticipate that they would experience greater negative outcomes related to the COVID-19 pandemic given their increased isolation and risk for complications than younger adults. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to synthesize the existing research on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and associated isolation and protective measures, on older adults. The secondary objective is to investigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and associated isolation and protective measures, on older adults with Alzheimer disease and related dementias. METHODS: A rapid review of the published literature was conducted on October 6, 2020, through a search of 6 online databases to synthesize results from published original studies regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on older adults. The Human Development Model conceptual framework–Disability Creation Process was used to describe and understand interactions between personal factors, environmental factors, and life habits. Methods and results are reported following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses Statement. RESULTS: A total of 135 records were included from the initial search strategy of 13,452 individual studies. Of these, 113 (83.7%) studies were determined to be of level 4 according to the levels of evidence classification by the Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine. The presence of psychological symptoms, exacerbation of ageism, and physical deterioration of aged populations were reported in the included studies. Decreased social life and fewer in-person social interactions reported during the COVID-19 pandemic were occasionally associated with reduced quality of life and increased depression. Difficulties accessing services, sleep disturbances, and a reduction of physical activity were also noted. CONCLUSIONS: Our results highlight the need for adequate isolation and protective measures. Older adults represent a heterogeneous group, which could explain the contradictory results found in the literature. Individual, organizational, and institutional strategies should be established to ensure that older adults are able to maintain social contacts, preserve family ties, and maintain the ability to give or receive help during the current pandemic. Future studies should focus on specific consequences and needs of more at-risk older adults to ensure their inclusion, both in public health recommendations and considerations made by policy makers.","Lebrasseur, Audrey; Fortin-Bédard, Noémie; Lettre, Josiane; Raymond, Emilie; Bussières, Eve-Line; Lapierre, Nolwenn; Faieta, Julie; Vincent, Claude; Duchesne, Louise; Ouellet, Marie-Christine; Gagnon, Eric; Tourigny, André; Lamontagne, Marie-Ève; Routhier, François",JMIR Aging,https://doi.org/10.2196/26474; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33720839/,114
679380,Decreased Serum Selenium Levels of COVID-19 Patients in Comparison with Healthy Individuals,2021-07-01,"Adenovirus infection has a tremendous impact on the cellular silencing machinery. Adenoviruses express high amounts of non-coding virus associated (VA) RNAs able to saturate key factors of the RNA interference (RNAi) processing pathway, such as Exportin 5 and Dicer. Furthermore, a proportion of VA RNAs is cleaved by Dicer into viral microRNAs (mivaRNAs) that can saturate Argonaute, an essential protein for miRNA function. Thus, processing and function of cellular miRNAs is blocked in adenoviral-infected cells. However, viral miRNAs actively target the expression of cellular genes involved in relevant functions such as cell proliferation, DNA repair or RNA regulation. Interestingly, the cellular silencing machinery is active at early times post-infection and can be used to control the adenovirus cell cycle. This is relevant for therapeutic purposes against adenoviral infections or when recombinant adenoviruses are used as vectors for gene therapy. Manipulation of the viral genome allows the use of adenoviral vectors to express therapeutic miRNAs or to be silenced by the RNAi machinery leading to safer vectors with a specific tropism.

With the above thesis in mind, questionnaire-based surveys were conducted amongst residents of five European countries: Poland, Italy, Spain, Portugal and Great Britain (England and Scotland). A specially devised, structured questionnaire was used to conduct anonymous internet surveys between 28 April and 16 July 2020. It contained questions pertaining to sociodemographic data, eating behaviours, the impact of the pandemic on the diet and physical activity. The questionnaire was made available to internet users in Poland, Italy, Spain, Great Britain (England and Scotland), and Portugal. The questionnaire was translated by native speakers into five languages: Polish, English, Spanish, Italian and Portuguese. Survey results were then analysed using StatSoft’s Statistica v. 13 software and Cytel’s StatXact v. 9.0.0. Age was the parameter that impacted changing eating behaviours to the largest extent during the pandemic. It was also found that during the pandemic, regular consumption of meals was most dependent on various factors. The negative impact of the pandemic within this scope was most profound amongst women, city residents regardless of gender and people over 35 years of age. A change in the frequency of consumption of selected product groups during the pandemic was also observed. Reduced consumption of meat and fish was identified. Especially among people under 35 living in Portugal, almost half—45.5% (p = 0.0210) declared lower consumption of meat, and more than half—54.5% (p = 0.011) reported lower consumption of fish. An analysis of the obtained results also showed an increase in the consumption of products with lower nutritional values, particularly amongst people under 35 years of age and also amongst residents of Great Britain (regardless of age). Moreover, the results showed that the pandemic may have had an impact on the weight reduction diet. A negative impact was declared by 16.5% of people, compared to 9.7% who said that the pandemic facilitated the use of the weight reduction diet (p = 0.006). The results of our survey also showed a decrease in the level of physical activity among people over 35 living in Poland (69.6%, p = 0.0497) and people living in Portuguese cities (72.73%, p = 0.0245). Our survey results showed that the impact of the pandemic on eating behaviours was particularly profound when it came to meal consumption regularity. Changes to the consumption of products with lower nutritional values, which may decrease immunity, have also been found during the pandemic. Our results showed that the problem associated with consuming products with lower nutritional values was particularly evident amongst people under 35. Considering the global character of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, further research is necessary to determine its impact on the diet, nutritional status and physical activity.","Górska, Paulina; Górna, Ilona; Miechowicz, Izabela; Przysławski, Juliusz",Foods,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34359494/; https://doi.org/10.3390/foods10071624,114

The aim of this preliminary study is to identify how ban zhu ren perceive the mental health of their students, and how they have acted on these perceptions. Content analysis was used to organize the data and distinguish categories or themes derived from in-depth semi-structured interviews conducted with 27 ban zhu ren from Zhejiang and Anhui provinces. Frequencies of informant responses were used to identify the areas of agreement and disagreement across identified categories and themes among the informants. The results illustrate that the informants consider issues, such as not paying attention in class (n = 14), not getting along well with classmates (n = 12), and excessive gaming (n = 11) to be indicative of mental illness, although these would commonly be considered normal adolescent behaviors. Fifteen informants admitted that they found it difficult to work with student mental health issues, and 18 felt they had inadequate or non-existent training. However, all informants stated that they had intervened with what they perceived to be students’ mental health issues, although only 9 informants had referred students for professional help. The informants reported that they were reluctant to provide referrals, due to the stigmatization they believed students would experience if given a diagnosis of mental illness. We conclude that among our informants there is a lack of agreement on what behavioral and mental health issues are, and that informants may be confusing what are, in actuality, non-conformist or non-compliant (yet often normal), adolescent behaviors with mental illness due to insufficient mental health training.","Yao, Min; Kadetz, Paul I; Sidibe, Aissata Mahamadou; Wu, Yedong; Li, Jiameng; Lyu, Jinping; Ma, Cuiling; Hesketh, Therese",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18147271; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34299721/,114

Soluble cluster of differentiation (CD)14 subtype (sCD14-ST also termed presepsin PSP) is a regulatory factor that modulates immune responses by interacting with T and B cells, useful for early diagnosis, prognosis and risk stratification prediction. Methods In 75 consecutive patients suffering from COVID-19 microbiology proven infection, admitted to intensive care unit (ICU, n=21, 28%) and/or in infectious disease ward (IW, n=54, 72%), PSP (Pathfast, Mitsubishi, Japan) has been measured in addition to routine laboratory tests performed during the period of hospitalization (from January to March 2020). Results PSP demonstrates: -statistically significant higher values (Mann-Whitney test) in 6 patients died (median, IQR= 1046, 763-1240; vs 417, 281-678 ng/L, p<0.05); -statistically significant but poor correlations with CRP (r= 0.59 p<0.001), LDH (r=0.52, p<0.001) and PCT (r=0.72, p<0.001) measured at the same day; -a significant relationship between concentrations and ICU stay. In fact patients showing PSP values higher than 250 ng/L (cut-off for risk stratification) did stay in ICU for a significantly longer time (median 17 days, IQR 12-31; p<0.001) than those exhibiting lower values (median 10 days, IQR 7-18). Conclusions The data obtained seems to demonstrate the role of PSP in providing prognostic information in COVID-19 patients, allowing to identify, during the early phase of the monitoring, the patients suffering from a more severe disease which will be hospitalized for a more long time.","Zaninotto, Martina; Maria Mion, Monica; Cosma, Chiara; Rinaldi, Daniela; Plebani, Mario",Clin Chim Acta,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0009898120301753; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0009898120301753?v=s5,114

682296,A network pharmacology based approach for predicting active ingredients and potential mechanism of Lianhuaqingwen capsule in treating COVID-19,2021-02-24,"Background: Facing the global COVID-19 pandemic University teaching has been digitalized and German medical faculties took great effort to offer curricular contents online as they agreed that semesters during pandemic should not be suspended. Skill training is an essential part of medical education and cannot be fully digitalized nor should it be omitted. The pandemic demonstrates that skills like ultrasound are essential when treating critical ill patients. Medical faculties use peer assisted learning (PAL) concepts to teach skills, like ultrasound through specially trained student tutors. Aim: Here, we would like to share our experiences and elaborate how ultrasound teaching can be safely performed during the pandemic with an emphasis on adjustment of an existing PAL teaching concept. Method: At the hospital of Saarland University, we implemented a PAL teaching concept for abdominal, including emergency, ultrasound, and echocardiography, called “sonoBYstudents” to teach sonography to undergraduate medical students. Students are generally taught in small groups of 5 people in 90min sessions over a time of 8 weeks with an objective structured clinical exam (OSCE) at the end of the course program. Each semester nearly 50 students are taught in abdominal and emergency ultrasound and 30 students in echocardiography. Over five years, more than 600 students have been taught with at least 30 students being trained as student tutors. Given the pandemic, course size, course interval and total course time and total course time were adapted to the hygienic precautions. Results: 45 and 30 students were taught in abdominal ultrasound and echocardiography respectively achieving their learning goals measured via OSCE at the end of the courses. OSCE results were the same when compared to previous semesters. Conclusion: PAL as a teaching concept lives out of sustained educational strategies like practical and didactical trainings and an ongoing recruitment of new student tutors. Suspending PAL and its skill teaching would require starting from the beginning which is a time and cost consuming process. With sonoBYstudents we were able to demonstrate that an existing PAL concept can, with some effort, be adjusted to changing teaching circumstances. Apart from this ultrasound is a non-omittable part of medical skill training with easily appliable hygienic precautions during teaching sessions.","Nourkami-Tutdibi, Nasenien; Hofer, M.; Zemlin, M.; Abdul-Khaliq, H.; Tutdibi, E.",GMS J Med Educ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33659610/; https://doi.org/10.3205/zma001401,114

However, data regarding natriuretic peptides are scarce. N‐terminal pro B‐type natriuretic peptide (NT‐proBNP) reflects haemodynamic stress and has proven useful for risk stratification in heart failure (HF) and other conditions such as pulmonary embolism and pneumonia. We aimed to adequately characterize NT‐proBNP concentrations using a large cohort of patients with COVID‐19, and to investigate its association with prognosis. METHODS AND RESULTS: Consecutive patients with confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) infection and available NT‐proBNP determinations, from March 1st to April 20th, 2020 who completed at least 1‐month follow‐up or died, were studied. Of 3080 screened patients, a total of 396 (mean age 71.8 ± 14.6 years, 61.1% male) fulfilled all the selection criteria and were finally included, with a median follow‐up of 53 (18–62) days. Of those, 192 (48.5%) presented NT‐proBNP levels above the recommended cut‐off for the identification of HF. However, only 47 fulfilled the clinical criteria for the diagnosis of HF. Patients with higher NT‐proBNP during admission experienced more frequent bleeding, arrhythmias and HF decompensations. NT‐proBNP was associated with mortality both in the whole study population and after excluding patients with HF. A multivariable Cox model confirmed that NT‐proBNP was independently associated with mortality after adjusting for all relevant confounders (hazard ratio 1.28, 95% confidence interval 1.13–1.44, per logarithmic unit). CONCLUSION: NT‐proBNP is frequently elevated in COVID‐19. It is strongly and independently associated with mortality after adjusting for relevant confounders, including chronic HF and acute HF. Therefore, its use may improve early prognostic stratification in this condition.","Caro‐Codón, Juan; Rey, Juan R.; Buño, Antonio; Iniesta, Angel M.; Rosillo, Sandra O.; Castrejon‐Castrejon, Sergio; Rodriguez‐Sotelo, Laura; Martinez, Luis A.; Marco, Irene; Merino, Carlos; Martin‐Polo, Lorena; Garcia‐Veas, Jose M.; Martinez‐Cossiani, Marcel; Gonzalez‐Valle, Luis; Herrero, Alicia; López‐de‐Sa, Esteban; Merino, Jose L.",Eur J Heart Fail,https://doi.org/10.1002/ejhf.2095; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33421281/,114

Troponin elevation is a frequent laboratory finding in hospitalized patients with the disease, and may reflect direct vascular injury or nonspecific supply-demand imbalance. In this work, we assessed the correlation between different ranges of Troponin elevation, Electrocardiographic (ECG) abnormalities and mortality. MethodsWe retrospectively studied 204 consecutive patients hospitalized at NYU Langone Health with COVID19. Serial ECG tracings were evaluated in conjunction with laboratory data including Troponin. Mortality was analyzed in respect to the degree of Troponin elevation and the presence of ECG changes including ST elevation, ST depression or T wave inversion. ResultsMortality increased in parallel with increase in Troponin elevation groups and reached 60% when Troponin was >1 ng/ml. In patients with mild Troponin rise (0.05 - 1.00 ng/ml) the presence of ECG abnormality resulted in significantly greater mortality. ConclusionECG repolarization abnormalities may represent a marker of clinical severity in patients with mild elevation in Troponin values.

We built a 3D and RGB door dataset with images from several indoor environments using a 3D Realsense camera D435. This dataset is freely available online. All methods are analysed taking into account their accuracy and the speed of the algorithm in a low powered computer. We conclude that it is possible to have a door classification algorithm running in real-time on a low-power device.","Ramôa, João Gaspar; Lopes, Vasco; Alexandre, Luís A.; Mogo, S.",SN Appl Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33942027/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s42452-021-04588-3,114
685105,Can chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine prove efficient in cancer cachexia? A hypothesis in the era of COVID-19,2020-11-26,"A characteristic feature of aggressive malignancy is the overexpression of lactic acid dehydrogenase- (LDH-) A, concomitant to pericellular accumulation of lactate. In a recent high-throughput screening, we identified Rhus chinensis (Mill.) gallnut (RCG) (also known as Galla Chinensis) extract as a potent (IC(50) < 1 µg/mL) inhibitor of human LDH-A (hLDH-A). In this study, through bioactivity guided fractionation of the crude extract, the data demonstrate that penta-1,2,3,4,6-O-galloyl-β-D-glucose (PGG) was a primary constituent responsible for hLDH-A inhibition, present at ~9.95 ± 0.34% dry weight. Theoretical molecular docking studies of hLDH-A indicate that PGG acts through competitive binding at the NADH cofactor site, effects confirmed by functional enzyme studies where the IC(50) = 27.32 nM was reversed with increasing concentration of NADH. Moreover, we confirm protein expression of hLDH-A in MDA-231 human breast carcinoma cells and show that PGG was toxic (LC(50) = 94.18 µM), parallel to attenuated lactic acid production (IC(50) = 97.81 µM). In a 72-hour cell proliferation assay, PGG was found to be a potent cytostatic agent with ability to halt cell division (IC(50) = 1.2 µM) relative to paclitaxel (IC(50) < 100 nM). In summary, these findings demonstrate that PGG is a potent hLDH-A inhibitor with significant capacity to halt proliferation of human breast cancer cells.","Deiab, Shihab; Mazzio, Elizabeth; Eyunni, Suresh; McTier, Oshlii; Mateeva, Nelly; Elshami, Faisel; Soliman, Karam F.

688719,Cerebral vein thrombosis after four COVID-19 vaccines in Europe,2021-08-21,"Worldwide, there is an array of clinical trials under way to evaluate treatment options against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Concurrently, several nutritional therapies and alternative supportive treatments are also being used and tested to reduce the mortality associated with acute respiratory distress in patients with COVID-19. In the context of COVID-19, improved nutrition that includes micronutrient supplementation to augment the immune system has been recognized as a viable approach to both prevent and alleviate the severity of the infection. The potential role of micronutrients as immune-boosting agents is particularly relevant for low- and middle-income countries, which already have an existing high burden of undernutrition and micronutrient deficiencies. A systematic literature review was performed to identify nutritional interventions that might prevent or aid in the recovery from COVID-19. The PubMed, ScienceDirect, Cochrane, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar databases were searched electronically from February to April 2020. All abstracts and full-text articles were examined for their relevance to this review. The information gathered was collated under various categories. Deficiencies of micronutrients, especially vitamins A, B complex, C, and D, zinc, iron, and selenium, are common among vulnerable populations in general and among COVID-19 patients in particular and could plausibly increase the risk of mortality. Judicious use of need-based micronutrient supplementation, alongside existing micronutrient fortification programs, is warranted in the current global pandemic, especially in low- and middle-income economies.","Akhtar, Saeed; Das, Jai K; Ismail, Tariq; Wahid, Muqeet; Saeed, Wisha; Bhutta, Zulfiqar A",Nutr Rev,https://doi.org/10.1093/nutrit/nuaa063; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33570583/,114
689472,Data and Safety Monitoring of COVID-19 Vaccine Clinical Trials,2021-05-19,"Importance: The scope of vaccination rollout and effectiveness of mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in the United States (US), and US Veterans specifically, has not been fully assessed. Objective: To estimate receipt of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, and vaccine effectiveness (VE) against SARS-CoV-2 infection, subsequent disease-related severity and mortality. Design, Setting, and Participants: First, receipt of any SARS-CoV-2 vaccine by March 7, 2021 was described for all enrolled and alive Veterans within the Veterans Health Administration (VHA). Second, to evaluate mRNA SARS-CoV-2 VE, a matched test negative case-control evaluation was conducted across all VHA facilities utilizing SARS-CoV-2 positive (cases [n=16,690]) and negative (controls [n=61,610]) tests from Veterans aged [≥]18 years old who routinely sought care at a VHA facility and were tested for SARS-CoV-2 from December 14, 2020, through March 14, 2021. Exposures: Vaccination histories were obtained from pharmacy and medical records to determine if patients were unvaccinated, partially vaccinated (from 7 days after first dose until day of second dose of mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccine), or fully vaccinated (from 7 days after second dose of mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccine) at time of SARS-CoV-2 test. Main Outcome Measures: Primary outcomes were (1) vaccine receipt among Veterans and specific subpopulations, (2) VE calculated from odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for the association between SARS-CoV-2 infection and full vs. no vaccination, and (3) VE against infection for partial vs. no vaccination. VE against COVID-19-related hospitalization and death were also estimated. Results: By March 7, 2020, among 6,170,750 Veterans, 1,547,045 (23.1%) received at least one SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. Based on the analysis of mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, VE against infection was 93.7% (95% CI 92.0-95.0) and 57.7% (95% CI 53.5-61.5) for full and partial vaccination (vs. no vaccination), respectively. VE was similar for subpopulations. VE against COVID-19-related hospitalization and death for full vs. no vaccination was 90.7% (95% CI 90.0-91.3) and 94.7% (95% CI 91.3-98.1), respectively. Conclusion and Relevance: Vaccines are effective in reducing SARS-CoV-2 infections and disease-related severity and mortality in the Veteran population. Effective vaccine, as well as their efficient and equitable distribution, are important for reducing COVID-19 disease burden among Veterans.","Young-Xu, Y.; Korves, C.; Powell, E. I.; Zwain, G.
