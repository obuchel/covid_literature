62824,Renal changes and acute kidney injury in covid-19: a systematic review.,2020,"Today, endoscopic adrenalectomy has become a gold standard in endocrine surgery. To minimize the morbidity and improve cosmesis, single access retroperitoneoscopic adrenalectomy (SARA) has been developed as an alternative to traditional multiport laparoscopy and single port access (SPA) surgery, potentially exploiting even more the already proven benefits of minimally invasive surgery. We applied the SARA technique to adrenalectomy using the posterior retroperitoneal approach. The aim is to highlight the current situation regarding the feasibility and safety of single access retroperitoneoscopic adrenalectomy and to present our initial experience. Between October 2010 and February 2011, a 74-year-old woman (body mass index (BMI) - 31 kg/m(2)) with pheochromocytoma (1.2 cm in size) and 3 women, aged 45, 46 and 66 years (BMI - 27, 32, 33 kg/m(2)), respectively, and all diagnosed with Conn's adenoma (from 1.2 cm to 2.0 cm in size), underwent single access retroperitoneoscopic adrenalectomies. Operations were performed using conventional laparoscopic (STORZ) equipment. No conversions to the open or conventional retroperitoneal approach were necessary. There were no perioperative or postoperative complications. Operating time ranged from 60 min to 80 min. All patients left the hospital 2 days after surgery. The single access retroperitoneoscopic technique has been successfully applied to adrenalectomy as an available alternative to multiport laparoendoscopic adrenalectomy and single port access surgery. Exposure, visualization and dissection are the same as in retroperitoneal endoscopic adrenalectomy. The SARA surgery offers patient benefits such as faster convalescence, decreased postoperative scarring, better cosmetic effect and financial benefit.","Beiša, Virgilijus; Kildušis, Edvinas; Strupas, Kęstutis",Wideochirurgia i inne techniki maloinwazyjne = Videosurgery and other miniinvasive techniques,https://doi.org/10.5114/wiitm.2011.25640; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23256000/,860

We thus evaluated post-mRNA vaccination adverse events (AE) in 246 vaccinated adults with IBD participating in a longitudinal vaccine registry. In general, AE frequency was similar to that reported in the general population. AE were more common among younger patients, and those with prior COVID-19. We additionally found that AE were less common in individuals receiving biologic therapy. Those with IBD and other IMID on these commonly prescribed therapies can be reassured that the AE risk is likely not increased, and may be reduced, while on biologics.","Botwin, Gregory J; Li, Dalin; Figueiredo, Jane; Cheng, Susan; Braun, Jonathan; McGovern, Dermot P B; Melmed, Gil Y",The American journal of gastroenterology,https://doi.org/10.14309/ajg.0000000000001342; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34047304/,860
87926,COVID-19: scars of the virus and stories caused by social isolation and mourning.,2020-11-01,"OBJECTIVE Plaut's breakthrough 2010 publication on diversity science-the study of meaningful human differences-set in motion a generative field of theory and research. Yet, to move diversity science forward, innovative methods that explicitly center the experiences of Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC) who encounter multiple forms of marginalization must be adopted. One such approach is intersectional mixed methods research-a methodological approach that uses intersectionality theory to guide the use of both quantitative and qualitative methods within a single study. CONCLUSIONS We argue that intersectional mixed methods research includes four tenets: (1) research questions prioritize multiply marginalized BIPOC individuals, (2) the multiple realities of BIPOC individuals are honored and embraced, (3) identity-related variables (e.g., self-reported discrimination) are studied alongside systems-level variables (e.g., structural racism), and (4) scholars engage in critical reflexivity. We also propose that intersectional mixed methods research can advance scholarship on multiply marginalized BIPOC individuals by fulfilling one of five purposes: Triangulation, complementarity, expansion, development, and initiation. We close with a discussion of tensions and recommendations.

88026,Role of a Neonatal Intensive Care Unit during the COVID-19 Pandemia: recommendations from the neonatology discipline.,2020-07-01,"BACKGROUND Large-scale, prospective studies of infectious intestinal disease (IID) in developed countries are uncommon. Two studies of IID incidence and etiology have been conducted in the United Kingdom: the Infectious Intestinal Disease Study in England (IID1) in 1993-1996 and the Second Study of Infectious Intestinal Disease in the Community (IID2) in 2008-2009. We examined changes in etiology and diagnostic yield of IID cases over 15 years. METHODS Fecal samples submitted by IID cases were examined for a range of bacterial, viral, and protozoal pathogens using traditional and molecular microbiological methods. We calculated the percentage of specimens positive for each organism based on traditional methods and on traditional and molecular methods combined. We compared the distributions of organisms in the 2 studies. RESULTS For pathogens investigated in both studies, 40% of fecal samples submitted by cases in IID2 were positive compared with 28% in IID1. Viruses were most frequent among community cases in IID2. Campylobacter was the most common bacterial pathogen among cases presenting to healthcare. Major differences between the 2 studies were increases in the detection of norovirus and sapovirus and a decline Salmonella. CONCLUSIONS Most fecal specimens were negative for the pathogens tested in both studies, so new strategies are needed to close the diagnostic gap. Among known pathogens, effective control of norovirus, rotavirus, and Campylobacter remain high priorities. The reduction in nontyphoidal salmonellosis demonstrates the success of Europe-wide control strategies, notably an industry-led Salmonella control program in poultry in the United Kingdom.","Tam, Clarence C; O'Brien, Sarah J; Tompkins, David S; Bolton, Frederick J; Berry, Lisa; Dodds, Julie; Choudhury, Dalia; Halstead, Fenella; Iturriza-Gómara, Miren; Mather, Katherine; Rait, Greta; Ridge, Alan; Rodrigues, Laura C; Wain, John; Wood, Bernard; Gray, James J",Clinical infectious diseases : an official publication of the Infectious Diseases Society of America,https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/cis028; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22412058/,860
107756,Speech therapy practice in hospital settings and COVID-19 pandemic.,2020,"Background: Teledermatology offers an opportunity to continually deliver care during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. Objective: To provide quantitative data about the use of teledermatology. Methods: Retrospective analysis of teledermatology consultations was performed from March 16 to May 1, 2020. The number/type of encounters, differences in diagnoses, and prescriptions between asynchronous and synchronous teledermatology visits were analyzed. Results: A total of 951 visits (36.2%) were asynchronous whereas 1,672 visits (63.8%) were synchronous. Only 131 (<5%) visits required an acute in-person follow-up. The diagnosis of acne was more frequent with asynchronous visits (p < 0.002, Bonferroni corrected). Antibiotics and nonretinoid acne medications were prescribed more with asynchronous visits, whereas immunomodulators and biologics were more commonly prescribed with synchronous visits (p < 0.02, Bonferroni corrected). Providers at our institution were split on preferred mode (54.2% synchronous, 45.8% asynchronous); however, synchronous visits were preferred for complex medical dermatology patients and return patients (p < 0.05). Limitations: This study is limited by being a single-center study. Conclusions: Asynchronous teledermatology was used more for acne management, whereas synchronous teledermatology was preferable to providers for complex medical dermatology. Postanalysis of the data collected led us to institute a hybridization of our asynchronous and synchronous teledermatology.","Kazi, Rashek; Evankovich, Maria R; Liu, Rebecca; Liu, Andrew; Moorhead, Autumn; Ferris, Laura K; Falo, Louis D; English, Joseph C",Telemedicine journal and e-health : the official journal of the American Telemedicine Association,https://doi.org/10.1089/tmj.2020.0299; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33074786/,860

130999,Neutrophil count to albumin ratio as a new predictor of mortality in patients with COVID-19 ınfection.,2020,PURPOSE OF REVIEW This review will report on the new aspects of management of 'malignant' middle cerebral artery (MCA) infarctions. RECENT FINDINGS Large MCA infarctions have been associated with high death rates for years. The most reliable predictors of a 'malignant' course are hypodensity in more than 50% of the MCA territory on computed tomography as well as stroke volume greater than 145 ml on diffusion-weighted imaging. Real-time neuromonitoring may be helpful in the detection of development of cerebral edema. The attempt of recanalization of the affected artery utilizing a combination of intravenous and intra-arterial thrombolysis and mechanical thrombectomy is crucial. Monitoring of intracranial pressure has not been proven helpful. Decompressive surgery within 48 h after symptom onset in patients less than 60 years old reduces mortality and severe disability. The quality of life perceived by the survivors is variable and deserves further study. The neuroprotective effect of hypothermia requires additional investigation. SUMMARY The era of decompressive hemicraniectomy has changed the prospects of patients with large infarctions in the MCA or internal carotid artery territory who are at risk of development of 'malignant' cerebral edema. Timing of surgery and appropriate patient selection based on age and other criteria need to be refined.,"Wartenberg, Katja E",Current opinion in critical care,https://doi.org/10.1097/mcc.0b013e32835075c5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22322256/,860

149473,Investigation of the frequency of COVID-19 in patients treated with intravesical BCG.,2020,"PURPOSE To describe and compare primary patency rates in patients undergoing endovascular femoropopliteal interventions with standard or interwoven nitinol stents or drug-coated balloons. METHODS A cohort of 1292 patients was treated for symptomatic femoropopliteal occlusive disease classified as Rutherford category ≥ 1 at a large vascular center between June 2006 and August 2013 using either standard nitinol stents (SNS; n=432), interwoven nitinol stents (INS; n=470), or drug-coated balloons (DCB; n=390). Primary patency rates were assessed by ultrasound or angiographic readings for over 3 years of follow-up. Propensity score-matched pairs were formed to compare each treatment with another using survival analysis. RESULTS Survival curves of primary patency favored INS compared with SNS in 368 propensity score-matched pairs (p<0.001). Kaplan-Meier estimates at 1, 2, and 3 years were 86.6%, 76.4%, and 68.9%, respectively, in the INS group vs 60.5%, 46.1%, and 42.1%, respectively, in the SNS group. No significant difference (p=0.232) was seen for the comparison of SNS vs DCB in 284 matched pairs over long-term follow-up (primary patency estimates at 1, 2, and 3 years were 79.8%, 53.8%, and 32.9%, respectively, in the DCB group vs 60.5%, 44.8%, and 40.3%, respectively, in the SNS group). Survival curves of primary patency favored INS over DCB in 254 matched pairs (p<0.001). Kaplan-Meier estimates at 1, 2, and 3 years were 79.0%, 51.2%, and 30.1%, respectively, in the DCB group vs 89.0%, 76.9%, and 66.2%, respectively, in the INS group. CONCLUSION Propensity score-based analysis of primary patency suggests profound differences in restenosis rates between various treatment modalities for femoropopliteal disease for over 3 years of follow-up.","Steiner, Sabine; Schmidt, Andrej; Bausback, Yvonne; Piorkowski, Michael; Werner, Martin; Yahiaoui-Doktor, Maryam; Banning-Eichenseer, Ursula; Scheinert, Dierk",Journal of endovascular therapy : an official journal of the International Society of Endovascular Specialists,https://doi.org/10.1177/1526602816628285; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26848131/,860

201434,COVID-19 and stroke: a thromboembolic hypothesis,2020,"BACKGROUND The Interventional Management of Stroke III (IMS-III) trial demonstrated no benefit for intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (IV rt-PA) followed by endovascular therapy versus IV rt-PA alone. However, IMS-III mostly included earlier generation devices. The recent thrombectomy trials have incorporated the stent-retriever technology, but their generalizability remains unknown. METHODS The North American Solitaire Acute Stroke (NASA) registry recruited patients treated with the Solitaire FR™ device between March 2012 and February 2013. The NASA-IMS-III-Like Group (NILG baseline NIHSS score ≥10 who received IV rt-PA) was compared to the IV rt-PA and IV + intra-arterial (IA)-IMS-III groups and the MR CLEAN, ESCAPE, SWIFT Prime, and REVASCAT trial controls to assess the stent-retriever treatment in the 'real-world' setting. The NILG was also compared to non-IV rt-PA NASA patients to evaluate the impact of IV rt-PA on thrombectomy. RESULTS A total of 136 of the 354 NASA patients fulfilled criteria for the NILG. Baseline characteristics were well balanced across groups. Time from onset to puncture was higher in NILG than IV+IA-IMS-III patients (274 ± 112 vs. 208 ± 47 min, p < 0.0001). Occlusions involving the intracranial ICA, MCA-M1, or basilar arteries were more common in NILG than IV+IA-IMS-III patients (91.2 vs. 47.2%, p < 0.00001). Modified thrombolysis in cerebral infarction ≥2b reperfusion was higher in NILG than IV+IA-IMS-III patients (74.3 vs. 39.6%, p < 0.00001). A 90-day modified Rankin Scale score ≤2 was more frequent in the NILG than IV+IA-IMS-III patients (51.9 vs. 40.8%, p = 0.03) and MR CLEAN (51.9 vs. 19.1%, p < 0.00001), ESCAPE (51.9 vs. 29.3%, p = 0.0002), SWIFT Prime (51.9 vs. 35.5%, p = 0.02), and REVASCAT (51.9 vs. 28.2%, p = 0.0003) controls. Symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage definitions varied across the different studies with rates ranging from 2.7% (ESCAPE) to 11.9% (NILG). The NILG 90-day mortality (24.4%) was higher than in SWIFT Prime but comparable to all other groups. IV rt-PA was an independent predictor of good outcome in NASA (OR = 2.3, 95% CI 1.2-4.7). CONCLUSION Our results support the 'real-world' applicability of the recent thrombectomy trials.","Nogueira, Raul G; Zaidat, Osama O; Castonguay, Alicia C; Haussen, Diogo C; Martin, Coleman O; Holloway, William E; Mueller-Kronast, Nils; English, Joey; Linfante, Italo; Dabus, Guilherme; Malisch, Tim W; Marden, Franklin A; Bozorgchami, Hormozd; Xavier, Andrew; Rai, Ansaar T; Froehler, Michael T; Badruddin, Aamir; Nguyen, Thanh N; Taqi, M Asif; Abraham, Michael G; Janardhan, Vallabh; Yoo, Albert J; Shaltoni, Hashem; Abou-Chebl, Alex; Chen, Peng R; Britz, Gavin W; Novakovic, Roberta; Nanda, Ashish; Kaushal, Ritesh; Issa, Mohammad A; Frankel, Michael R; Gupta, Rishi",Interventional neurology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27781037/,860
201435,COVID-19 and stroke: a thromboembolic hypothesis,2020,"The spike (S) protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is a major antigenic determinant capable of inducing protective immunity. Recently, a small fragment on the SARS-CoV S protein (residues 318-510) was characterized as a minimal receptor-binding domain (RBD), which mediates virus binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, the functional receptor on susceptible cells. In this study, we demonstrated that a fusion protein containing RBD linked to human IgG1 Fc fragment (designated RBD-Fc) induced high titer of RBD-specific Abs in the immunized mice. The mouse antisera effectively neutralized infection by both SARS-CoV and SARS pseudovirus with mean 50% neutralization titers of 1/15,360 and 1/24,737, respectively. The neutralization determinants on the RBD of S protein were characterized by a panel of 27 mAbs isolated from the immunized mice. Six groups of conformation-dependent epitopes, designated as Conf I-VI, and two adjacent linear epitopes were identified by ELISA and binding competition assays. The Conf IV and Conf V mAbs significantly blocked RBD-Fc binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, suggesting that their epitopes overlap with the receptor-binding sites in the S protein. Most of the mAbs (23 of 25) that recognized the conformational epitopes possessed potent neutralizing activities against SARS pseudovirus with 50% neutralizing dose ranging from 0.005 to 6.569 microg/ml. Therefore, the RBD of SARS S protein contains multiple conformational epitopes capable of inducing potent neutralizing Ab responses, and is an important target site for developing vaccines and immunotherapeutics.","He, Yuxian; Lu, Hong; Siddiqui, Pamela; Zhou, Yusen; Jiang, Shibo",Journal of immunology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15814718/,860

After the peak of the epidemic in New York City, in late April to early May, cases of severe illness associated with COVID-19 were reported among mostly previously healthy children ages 5-19. Many of these cases feature a toxic shock-like syndrome or Kawasaki-like syndrome in the setting of SARS-CoV-2 positive diagnostic testing and the CDC has termed this presentation Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome (MIS-C). It is essential to disseminate information among the medical community regarding severe and atypical presentations of COVID-19 as prior knowledge can help communities with increasing caseloads prepare to quickly identify and treat these patients as they present in the emergency department. We describe a case of MIS-C in a child who presented to our Emergency Department (ED) twice and on the second visit was found to have signs of distributive shock, multi-organ injury and systemic inflammation associated with COVID-19. The case describes two ED visits by an 11- year-old SARS-CoV-2-positive female who initially presented with fever, rash and pharyngitis and returned within 48 hours with evidence of cardiac and renal dysfunction and fluid-refractory hypotension requiring vasopressors and PICU admission.","Greene, Andrea G; Saleh, Mona; Roseman, Eric; Sinert, Richard",Am J Emerg Med,,860
224758,COVID-19: the virus in the control of culture?,2020,"Meteorological and geophysical hazards will concur and interact with coronavirus disease (COVID-19) impacts in many regions on Earth. These interactions will challenge the resilience of societies and systems. A comparison of plausible COVID-19 epidemic trajectories with multi-hazard time-series curves enables delineation of multi-hazard scenarios for selected countries (United States, China, Australia, Bangladesh) and regions (Texas). In multi-hazard crises, governments and other responding agents may be required to make complex, highly compromised, hierarchical decisions aimed to balance COVID-19 risks and protocols with disaster response and recovery operations. Contemporary socioeconomic changes (e.g. reducing risk mitigation measures, lowering restrictions on human activity to stimulate economic recovery) may alter COVID-19 epidemiological dynamics and increase future risks relating to natural hazards and COVID-19 interactions. For example, the aggregation of evacuees into communal environments and increased demand on medical, economic, and infrastructural capacity associated with natural hazard impacts may increase COVID-19 exposure risks and vulnerabilities. COVID-19 epidemiologic conditions at the time of a natural hazard event might also influence the characteristics of emergency and humanitarian responses (e.g. evacuation and sheltering procedures, resource availability, implementation modalities, and assistance types). A simple epidemic phenomenological model with a concurrent disaster event predicts a greater infection rate following events during the pre-infection rate peak period compared with post-peak events, highlighting the need for enacting COVID-19 counter measures in advance of seasonal increases in natural hazards. Inclusion of natural hazard inputs into COVID-19 epidemiological models could enhance the evidence base for informing contemporary policy across diverse multi-hazard scenarios, defining and addressing gaps in disaster preparedness strategies and resourcing, and implementing a future-planning systems approach into contemporary COVID-19 mitigation strategies. Our recommendations may assist governments and their advisors to develop risk reduction strategies for natural and cascading hazards during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Quigley, Mark C; Attanayake, Januka; King, Andrew; Prideaux, Fabian",Environ Syst Decis,,860

METHODS: Using an online survey platform, a poststratified (by age, gender, race, income, and geography), representative sample (n = 10,368 adults) is used in the analysis. RESULTS: On average, sample respondents report Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression (CES-D) Scale symptomatology nearly a point higher than the often used cutoff score for clinical caseness (16+); one-third of respondents had CES-D scores higher than 25. Multiple regression results show elevated levels of depressive symptomatology among the socially vulnerable (women, Hispanic, unmarried, not working). Those persons expressing heightened COVID-19 fear and moderate to high levels of food insecurity report more depressive symptoms than persons with less fear and low or no food insecurity. All three of the resource variables (mastery of fate, strength of ties, and optimism) are significant and in the negative direction. CONCLUSIONS: In a snapshot, the data provide an important point prevalence assessment of adult depressive symptoms during the current public health crisis. Results highlight the significance of vulnerability and individual stressors in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, the analysis affirms the importance of access to social and psychological resources to combat heightened fear and anxiety that persons report during the current pandemic.","Fitzpatrick, Kevin M; Harris, Casey; Drawve, Grant",Depress. anxiety,,860
251479,Can the neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (NLR) have a role in the diagnosis of coronavirus 2019 disease (COVID-19)?,2020,"BACKGROUND: Accurate anti-SARS-CoV-2 assays are needed to inform diagnostic, therapeutic, and public health decisions. The first manufacturer-independent head-to-head comparison of two rapid high-throughput automated electrochemiluminescence double-antigen sandwich immunoassays targeting total anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies against two different viral proteins, Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 (Elecsys-N) and Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 S (Elecsys-S) (Roche Diagnostics), was performed in a routine setting during the exponential growth phase of the epidemic's second wave. METHODS: The diagnostic specificity of Elecsys-N and Elecsys-S was initially evaluated on a panel of 572 pre-COVID-19 samples, showing 100 % specificity of both assays. Elecsys-N/Elecsys-S head-to-head comparison used 3,416 consecutive blood samples from individuals that were tested for the presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 within commercial out-of-pocket serologic testing. RESULTS: Elecsys-N/Elecsys-S head-to-head comparison showed overall agreement of 98.68 % (3,371/3,416; 95 % CI, 98.23-99.03 %), positive agreement of 95.16 % (884/929; 95 % CI, 93.52-96.41 %), and a high kappa value of 0.996 (95 % CI, 0.956-0.976). Previous SARS-CoV-2 PCR positivity was identified in 14/24 (58.3 %) Elecsys-N negative/Elecsys-S positive individuals and in 4/21 (19.0 %) Elecsys-N positive/Elecsys-S negative individuals. CONCLUSION: The first Elecsys-N/Elecsys-S head-to-head comparison showed excellent agreement of two highly specific and rapid high-throughput automated anti-SARS-CoV-2 assays. An important question is whether laboratories offering two different antibody assays could benefit from combining the assays; if so, should use be concomitant or sequential-and, in the latter case, in which order? Based on our results, we favor concomitant over sequential Elecsys-N/Elecsys-S use when testing individuals for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in high-incidence settings; for example, during the exponential or stationary growth phase of the COVID-19 epidemic.","Poljak, Mario; Ostrbenk Valencak, Anja; Stamol, Tina; Seme, Katja",J Clin Virol,,860
261763,Current evidence of SARS-CoV-2 vertical transmission: an integrative review,2020,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic and ensuing national lockdowns have dramatically changed the healthcare landscape. The pandemic's impact on people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) remains poorly understood. We hypothesised that the UK-wide lockdown restrictions were associated with reductions in severe COPD exacerbations. We provide the first national level analyses of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and first lockdown on severe COPD exacerbations resulting in emergency hospital admissions and/or leading to death as well as those recorded in primary care or emergency departments. METHODS: Using data from Public Health Scotland and the Secure Anonymised Information Linkage Databank in Wales, we accessed weekly counts of emergency hospital admissions and deaths due to COPD over the first 30 weeks of 2020 and compared these to the national averages over the preceding 5 years. For both Scotland and Wales, we undertook interrupted time-series analyses to model the impact of instigating lockdown on these outcomes. Using fixed-effect meta-analysis, we derived pooled estimates of the overall changes in trends across the two nations. RESULTS: Lockdown was associated with 48% pooled reduction in emergency admissions for COPD in both countries (incidence rate ratio, IRR 0.52, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.58), relative to the 5-year averages. There was no statistically significant change in deaths due to COPD (pooled IRR 1.08, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.33). In Wales, lockdown was associated with 39% reduction in primary care consultations for acute exacerbation of COPD (IRR 0.61, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.71) and 46% reduction in COPD-related emergency department attendances (IRR 0.54, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.81). CONCLUSIONS: The UK-wide lockdown was associated with the most substantial reductions in COPD exacerbations ever seen across Scotland and Wales, with no corresponding increase in COPD deaths. This may have resulted from reduced transmission of respiratory infections, reduced exposure to outdoor air pollution and/or improved COPD self-management.","Alsallakh, Mohammad A; Sivakumaran, Shanya; Kennedy, Sharon; Vasileiou, Eleftheria; Lyons, Ronan A; Robertson, Chris; Sheikh, Aziz; Davies, Gwyneth A",BMC Med,,860

Inflammation and cardiac injury are commonly observed in these cases. However, the association between the hyper-inflammatory response and cardiac injury among patients with COVID-19 remains unknown. METHODS: The study was designed based on severe and critically ill patients with COVID-19. Information on demographics and baseline clinical characteristics as well as laboratory examinations were collected from the electronic medical records and analyzed. RESULTS: There were 32.4% (nâ¯=â¯107) of patients presenting with cardiac injury. The median age was 67 years, and 48.8% (nâ¯=â¯161) of patients were men. Hypertension was the most common in 161 (48.8%) patients, followed by diabetes (16.7%, nâ¯=â¯55) and coronary heart disease (13.3%, nâ¯=â¯44). Moreover, compared to cases without cardiac injury, those with cardiac injury were older, had higher proportions of coronary heart disease, had significantly elevated leukocyte counts and concentrations of N-terminal pro-B-Type natriuretic peptide, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-&#945;, interleukin-2 receptor (IL-2R), IL-6, and IL-8, but lower lymphocyte counts. A significant positive correlation was observed between high-sensitivity troponin I and hs-CRP, TNF-&#945;, IL-2R, IL-6 and IL-8. Stepwise logistic regression analysis showed that hs-CRP, TNF-&#945; and IL-6 were independent risk factors for cardiac injury. CONCLUSIONS: Pro-inflammatory cytokines were associated with cardiac injury among severe and critically ill patients with COVID-19, suggesting that hyper-inflammatory response may involve in cardiac injury.","Xia, Guozhi; Fan, Di; Ma, Chaoran; He, Yanru; Wang, Ming; Zhu, Yaowu; Zheng, Qiangsun",Am. j. med. sci,,860

295326,COVID-19: scars of the virus and stories caused by social isolation and mourning,2020,"Early prediction of patients at risk of clinical deterioration can help physicians intervene and alter their clinical course towards better outcomes. In addition to the accuracy requirement, early warning systems must make the predictions early enough to give physicians enough time to intervene. Interpretability is also one of the challenges when building such systems since being able to justify the reasoning behind model decisions is desirable in clinical practice. In this work, we built an interpretable model for the early prediction of various adverse clinical events indicative of clinical deterioration. The model is evaluated on two datasets and four clinical events. The first dataset is collected in a predominantly COVID-19 positive population at Stony Brook Hospital. The second dataset is the MIMIC III dataset. The model was trained to provide early warning scores for ventilation, ICU transfer, and mortality prediction tasks on the Stony Brook Hospital dataset and to predict mortality and the need for vasopressors on the MIMIC III dataset. Our model first separates each feature into multiple ranges and then uses logistic regression with lasso penalization to select the subset of ranges for each feature. The model training is completely automated and doesn't require expert knowledge like other early warning scores. We compare our model to the Modified Early Warning Score (MEWS) and quick SOFA (qSOFA), commonly used in hospitals. We show that our model outperforms these models in the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) while having a similar or better median detection time on all clinical events, even when using fewer features. Unlike MEWS and qSOFA, our model can be entirely automated without requiring any manually recorded features. We also show that discretization improves model performance by comparing our model to a baseline logistic regression model.","Hammoud, Ibrahim; Prasanna, Prateek; Ramakrishnan, IV; Singer, Adam; Henry, Mark; Thode, Henry",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.05958v2.pdf,860

In this context, a ""One Health"" approach with an integrated multidisciplinary effort involving humans, animals and their surrounding environment is needed to tackle the spread of AMR. One of the most common ways for bacteria to live is to adhere to surfaces and form biofilms. Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) can form biofilm on most surfaces and in a wide heterogeneity of environmental conditions. The biofilm guarantees the survival of the S. aureus in harsh environmental conditions and represents an issue for the food industry and animal production. The identification and characterization of biofilm-related proteins may provide interesting insights into biofilm formation mechanisms in S. aureus. In this regard, the aims of this study were: (i) to use proteomics to compare proteomes of S. aureus growing in planktonic and biofilm forms in order to investigate the common features of biofilm formation properties of different strains; (ii) to identify specific biofilm mechanisms that may be involved in AMR. The proteomic analysis showed 14 differentially expressed proteins among biofilm and planktonic forms of S. aureus. Moreover, three proteins, such as alcohol dehydrogenase, ATP-dependent 6-phosphofructokinase, and fructose-bisphosphate aldolase, were only differentially expressed in strains classified as high biofilm producers. Differentially regulated catabolites metabolisms and the switch to lower oxygen-related metabolisms were related to the sessile conformation analyzed.","Piras, Cristian; Di Ciccio, Pierluigi Aldo; Soggiu, Alessio; Greco, Viviana; Tilocca, Bruno; Costanzo, Nicola; Ceniti, Carlotta; Urbani, Andrea; Bonizzi, Luigi; Ianieri, Adriana; Roncada, Paola",,,860

This is especially the case during public health emergencies like the 2019 SARS-CoV-2 disease. Objectives: The study aimed at assessing the prevalence of self-medication before and during the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic and its associated factors. Methods: Stratified sampling was used to select 379 study respondents. The authors developed an online questionnaire, pretested and submitted to various online professional groups of different cadres of health workers. Collected data was analysed using descriptive and inferential statistics. The data was presented in tables, graphs, percentages, and cross-tabulation with different variables. Multivariable logistic regression was used to ascertain factors that influence an individual's desire to self-medicate and associations were considered significant at p<0.05. Results: The overall prevalence of self-medication increased from 36.2% (n=137) before the pandemic to 60.4% (n=229) during the pandemic. The respondents' gender, level of education, age, marital status, level of participation in physical activity, and drug reaction events, were significantly associated with self-medication before and during the outbreak (P < 0.05). Multivariable logistic regression analyses showed that engaging in physical activity, working during the day and being healthy were less likely to choose self-medication (p < 0.01). Conclusion: Self-medication is an important health issue, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Understanding the drivers behind the growth of such networks - in particular urban firm networks -, is essential for the economic resilience of urban systems. We introduce in this paper a generative network model for firm networks at the urban area level including several complementary processes: the economic size of urban areas at origin and destination, industrial sector proximity between firms, the strength of links from the past, as well as the geographical and socio-cultural distance. An empirical network analysis on European firm ownership data confirms the relevance of each of these factors. We then simulate network growth for synthetic systems of cities, unveiling stylized facts such as a transition from a local to a global regime or a maximal integration achieved at an intermediate interaction range. We calibrate the model on the European network, outperforming statistical models and showing a strong role of path-dependency. Potential applications of the model include the study of mitigation policies to deal with exogenous shocks such as economic crisis or potential lockdowns of countries, which we illustrate with an application on stylized scenarios.","Raimbault, Juste; Zdanowska, Natalia; Arcaute, Elsa",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.05528v1.pdf,860

329056,The effects of favipiravir on hematological parameters of covıd-19 patients,2020,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a pandemic infectious disease caused by novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS CoV-2). The SARS CoV-2 is transmitted more rapidly and readily than SARS CoV. Both, SARS CoV and SARS CoV-2 via their glycosylated spike proteins recognize the human angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) receptor. We generated multiple sequence alignments and phylogenetic trees for representative spike proteins of SARS CoV and SARS CoV-2 from various host sources in order to analyze the specificity in SARS CoV-2 spike proteins required for causing infection in humans. Our results show that among the genomes analyzed, two sequence regions in the N-terminal domain ""MESEFR"" and ""SYLTPG"" are specific to human SARS CoV-2. In the receptor-binding domain, two sequence regions ""VGGNY"" and ""EIYQAGSTPCNGV"" and a disulfide bridge connecting 480C and 488C in the extended loop are structural determinants for the recognition of human ACE-2 receptor. The complete genome analysis of representative SARS CoVs from bat, civet, human host sources, and human SARS CoV-2 identified the bat genome (GenBank code: MN996532.1) as closest to the recent novel human SARS CoV-2 genomes. The bat SARS CoV genomes (GenBank codes: MG772933 and MG772934) are evolutionary intermediates in the mutagenesis progression toward becoming human SARS CoV-2.","Guruprasad, Lalitha",Proteins,,860

However, the studies published to date have several methodological limitations and are mainly from China. We set out to synthesize evidence on smoking and COVID-19 relationship drawn on cohort studies only which are published in non-Chinese population settings. Method: A systematic literature search was undertaken drawn on predefined eligibility criteria and a comprehensive search strategy following the PRISMA guideline between January 2020 and August 2020, excluding preprints and gray literature. Three specific outcomes were examined: smoking history, SARS-CoV2 infection, and COVID-19 severity.","Rodgers, A.; Nadkarni, M.; Indreberg, E. K.; Alfallaj, L.; Kabir, Z.",Tobacco Use Insights,,860

The objectives of this paper are to describe the development of and students' experiences and learning outcomes during the elective. Faculty preceptor and experiential administrator's perspectives are also described. METHODS: This month-long APPE was developed in mid-March and delivered in April and May of 2020. The students volunteered in-person with the State of Tennessee COVID-19 Hotline call centers and conducted topic discussions and assignments virtually with a remote preceptor. RESULTS: A total of 16 students completed this rotation experience. Student ratings of the experience were positive, and their knowledge improved in all topic areas. Students collectively completed approximately 700 hours manning the COVID-19 hotline and logged over 1,000 phone calls. CONCLUSIONS: In a time of unprecedented disruption to experiential learning, the development of this unique public health APPE directly benefited the college, the students, and the citizens of our state. The APPE described in this paper could be replicated in additional waves of the pandemic or adapted for similar disaster response.","Kiles, Tyler Marie; Hagemann, Tracy; Felts, Brianna; Crill, Catherine",J Pharm Pract,,860

The author describes the changes in daily routine and the measures that had to be taken to follow regulations and stay ‘on the safe side’, on the one hand, while maintaining the continuity of analyses on the other. This change was rapid and intense, and the main feature of this period was the loss of the ability to withhold action, to stop and think, and to let mental and psychical processes run their course–a feature we are so accustomed to in our usual practice. The consequences of this process are still to be explored, and need more time and perspective for the full impact to be understood. In this paper, the author maps a few issues that will have to be dealt with more fully after the pandemic is over. © 2021 Association of Child Psychotherapists.","Wolpe, E.",Journal of Child Psychotherapy,,860

362507,Speech therapy practice in hospital settings and COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"We report the first two cases of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) who were receiving intensive care including favipiravir, and were clinically diagnosed with neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) to focus attention on NMS in COVID-19 management. Case 1: A 46-year-old-man with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) caused by COVID-19 infection was being administered favipiravir. Fentanyl, propofol, and rocuronium were also given. On day 3, midazolam administration was initiated for deep sedation. On day 5, his high body temperature increased to 41.2â¯°C, creatine kinase level elevated, and he developed tachycardia, tachypnea, altered consciousness, and diaphoresis. NMS was suspected, and supportive therapy was initiated. High-grade fever persisted for 4â¯days and subsided on day 9. Case 2: A 44-year-old-man with ARDS caused by COVID-19 infection was being treated with favipiravir. On day 5, risperidone was started for delirium. On day 7, his body temperature suddenly increased to 40.8â¯°C, his CK level elevated, and he developed tachycardia, tachypnea, altered consciousness, and diaphoresis. NMS diagnosis was confirmed, and both, favipiravir and risperidone were discontinued on day 8. On the same day, his CK levels decreased, and his body temperature normalized on day 9. Patients with COVID-19 infection frequently require deep sedation and develop delirium; therefore, more attention should be paid to the development of NMS in patients who are being administered such causative agents. The mechanism underlying the occurrence of NMS in COVID-19 patients treated with favipiravir remains unknown. Therefore, careful consideration of NMS development is necessary in the management of COVID-19 patients.","Soh, Mitsuhito; Hifumi, Toru; Isokawa, Shutaro; Shimizu, Masato; Otani, Norio; Ishimatsu, Shinichi",Am. j. emerg. med,,860

Rising concerns about Covid-19 have severely affected the healthcare system in all countries as the Covid-19 outbreak has developed at a rapid rate all around the globe. Intriguing, a clinically used drug, acetazolamide (a specific inhibitor of carbonic anhydrase, CA, EC 4.2.1.1), is used to treat high-altitude pulmonary oedema (HAPE), showing a high degree of clinical similarities with the pulmonary disease caused by Covid-19. In this context, this preliminary study aims to provide insights into some factors affecting the Covid-19 patients, such as hypoxaemia, hypoxia as well as the blood CA activity. We hypothesise that patients with Covid-19 problems could show a dysregulated acid-base status influenced by CA activity. These preliminary results suggest that the use of CA inhibitors as a pharmacological treatment for Covid-19 may be beneficial.","Deniz, Secil; Uysal, Tugba Kevser; Capasso, Clemente; Supuran, Claudiu T; Ozensoy Guler, Ozen",J Enzyme Inhib Med Chem,,860

Initial reports from the early weeks of lockdown in the UK and worldwide suggested that uptake could fall putting children at risk from multiple other infectious diseases. In Scotland and England, enhanced surveillance of national data for childhood immunisations was established to inform and rapidly assess the impact of the pandemic on infant and preschool immunisation uptake rates. Methods and findingsWe undertook an observational study using routinely collected data for the year prior to the pandemic (2019), and immediately before, during and after the first period of the UK lockdown in 2020. Data were obtained for Scotland from the Public Health Scotland ""COVID19 wider impacts on the health care system"" dashboard (https://scotland.shinyapps.io/phs-covid-wider-impact/) and for England from ImmForm. Five vaccinations delivered at different ages were evaluated; three doses of the 6-in-1 DTaP/IPV/Hib/HepB vaccine and two doses of MMR. Uptake in the periods in 2020 compared to that in the baseline year of 2019 using binary logistic regression analysis. For Scotland, we analysed timely uptake of immunisations, defined as uptake within four weeks of the child becoming eligible by age for each immunisation and data were also analysed by geographical region and indices of deprivation. For both Scotland and England, we assessed whether immunisations were up to date at approximately 6 months (all doses 6-in-1) and 16-18 months (first MMR) of age. We found that uptake rates within four weeks of eligibility in Scotland for all the five vaccine visits were higher during the 2020 lockdown period than in 2019. The difference ranged from 1.3% for the first dose of the 6-in-1 vaccine (95.3 vs 94%, OR 1.28, CI 1.18-1.39) to 14.3% for the second MMR dose (66.1 vs 51.8 %, OR 1.8, CI 1.74-1.87). Significant increases in uptake were seen across all deprivation levels, though, for MMR, there was evidence of greater improvement for children living in the least deprived areas. In England, fewer children who had been due to receive their immunisations during the lockdown period were up to date at 6 months (6-in-1) or 18 months (first dose MMR). The fall in percentage uptake ranged from 0.5% for first 6-in1 (95.8 vs 96.3%, OR 0.89, CI 0.86-0.91) to 2.1% for third 6-in-1 (86.6 vs 88.7%, OR 0.82, CI 0.81-0.83). ConclusionsThis study suggests that the national lockdown in Scotland was associated with a positive effect on timely childhood immunisation uptake, however in England a lower percentage of children were up to date at 6 and 18 months. Reason for the improve uptake in Scotland may include active measures taken to promote immunisation at local and national level during this period. Promoting immunisation uptake and addressing potential vaccine hesitancy is particularly important given the ongoing pandemic and COVID-19 vaccination campaigns.","McQuaid, Fiona; Mulholland, Rachel; Rai, Yuma Sangpang; Agrawal, Utkarsh; Bedford, Helen; Cameron, Claire; Gibbon, Cheryl; Roy, Partho; Sheikh, Aziz; Shi, Ting; Simpson, Colin; Tait, Judith; Tessier, Elise; Turner, Steve; Ortega, Jaime Villacampa; White, Joanne; Wood, Rachael",,,860

392270,Home Care as a safe alternative during the COVID-19 crisis,2020,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 epidemic and the related containment strategies may affect parental and pediatric health behaviors. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to assess the change in children's and adolescents' prevention and vaccination behaviors amid China's COVID-19 epidemic. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional online survey in mid-March 2020 using proportional quota sampling in Wuhan (the epidemic epicenter) and Shanghai (a nonepicenter). Data were collected from 1655 parents with children aged 3 to 17 years. Children's and adolescents' prevention behaviors and regular vaccination behaviors before and during the epidemic were assessed. Descriptive analyses were used to investigate respondents' characteristics, public health prevention behaviors, unproven protection behaviors, and vaccination behaviors before and during the COVID-19 epidemic. Univariate analyses were performed to compare differences in outcome measures between cities and family characteristics, using chi-square tests or Fisher exact tests (if expected frequency was <5) and analyses of variance. Multivariate logistic regressions were used to identify the factors and disparities associated with prevention and vaccination behaviors. RESULTS: Parent-reported prevention behaviors increased among children and adolescents during the COVID-19 epidemic compared with those before the epidemic. During the epidemic, 82.2% (638/776) of children or adolescents always wore masks when going out compared with 31.5% (521/1655) before the epidemic; in addition, 25.0% (414/1655) and 79.8% (1321/1655) had increased their frequency and duration of handwashing, respectively, although only 46.9% (776/1655) went out during the epidemic. Meanwhile, 56.1% (928/1655) of the families took unproven remedies against COVID-19. Parent-reported vaccination behaviors showed mixed results, with 74.8% (468/626) delaying scheduled vaccinations and 80.9% (1339/1655) planning to have their children get the influenza vaccination after the epidemic. Regarding socioeconomic status, children and adolescents from larger families and whose parents had lower education levels were less likely to improve prevention behaviors but more likely to take unproven remedies. Girls were less likely than boys to always wear a mask when going out and wash their hands. CONCLUSIONS: Prevention behaviors and attitudes toward influenza vaccination have improved during the COVID-19 epidemic. Public health prevention measures should be continuously promoted, particularly among girls, parents with lower education levels, and larger families. Meanwhile, misinformation about COVID-19 remains a serious challenge and needs to be addressed by public health stakeholders.","Hou, Zhiyuan; Song, Suhang; Du, Fanxing; Shi, Lu; Zhang, Donglan; Lin, Leesa; Yu, Hongjie",JMIR Public Health Surveill,,860

Objective: To determine whether a therapy that increases peripheral blood leukocyte and lymphocyte cell counts leads to clinical improvement in patients with COVID-19. Design, Setting and Participants: Between February 18 and April 10, 2020, we conducted an open-label, multicenter, randomized clinical trial at 3 participating centers in China. The main eligibility criteria were pneumonia, a blood lymphocyte cell count of 800 per µL (to convert to ×109/L, multiply by 0.001) or lower, and no comorbidities. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection was confirmed with reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction testing. Exposures: Usual care alone, or usual care plus 3 doses of recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (rhG-CSF, 5 µg/kg, subcutaneously at days 0-2). Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary end point was the time from randomization to improvement of at least 1 point on a 7-category disease severity score. Results: Of 200 participants, 112 (56%) were men and the median (interquartile range [IQR]) age was 45 (40-55) years. There was random assignment of 100 patients (50%) to the rhG-CSF group and 100 (50%) to the usual care group. Time to clinical improvement was similar between groups (rhG-CSF group median of 12 days (IQR, 10-16 days) vs usual care group median of 13 days (IQR, 11-17 days); hazard ratio, 1.28; 95% CI, 0.95-1.71; P = .06).

New evidence is needed on how to mitigate the job market crisis, but there exists only a handful of studies mostly focusing on developed countries. We fill in this gap in the literature by using novel data from Ukraine, a transition country in Eastern Europe, which enacted strict quarantine policies early on. We model four binary outcomes to identify respondents (i) who are not working during quarantine, (ii) those who are more likely to work from home, (iii) respondents who are afraid of losing a job, and, finally, (iv) survey participants who have savings for 1 month or less if quarantine is further extended. Our findings suggest that respondents employed in public administration, programming and IT, as well as highly qualified specialists, were more likely to secure their jobs during the quarantine. Females, better educated respondents, and those who lived in Kyiv were more likely to work remotely. Working in the public sector also made people more confident about their future employment perspectives. Although our findings are limited to urban households only, they provide important early evidence on the correlates of job market outcomes, expectations, and financial security, indicating potential deterioration of socio-economic inequalities.","Brik, Tymofii; Obrizan, Maksym",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.15704v1.pdf,860

The outcomes intend to encourage increased collaboration with respect to dental guidelines in relation to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, as well as to improve decision making and safety for dental patients and staff. METHODS: This rapid review was conducted by 2 authors (MKV and KD), with the support of a third author (SD), to assess current guidelines related to dental AGDPs. This streamlined review approach allowed synthesis of data in an efficient manner in the rapidly evolving environment associated with the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. RESULTS: The findings identified 1) a lack of consistency in reporting which procedures were deemed an AGDP; 2) that high-speed handpieces, air-water syringes, and mechanical scalers were consistently considered high-risk AGDPs; 3) a lack of consensus on the risk of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) transmission with the use of slow-speed handpieces; 4) a general agreement, when described, that rubber dam and high-volume evacuation can significantly reduce aerosol production; and 5) a lack of consistency in reporting whether procedures constitute a low, moderate, or high risk of COVID-19 transmission. The findings are discussed in relation to the guidance and future recommendations. CONCLUSION: It is recommended that future published guidance should indicate the risk stratification (low/moderate/high) of each procedure/exposure in a standardized international approach. KNOWLEDGE TRANSFER STATEMENT: The results of this rapid review can be used by clinicians to increase their awareness of international guidance on aerosol-generating procedures in dentistry. It will also encourage those publishing future guidance to provide an internationally standardized, risk-stratified approach to describing aerosol-generating procedures. Currently, it allows clinicians to consider aerosol-generating procedures as a risk spectrum.","Virdi, M K; Durman, K; Deacon, S",JDR Clin Trans Res,,860

438601,Coronavirus: a clinical update of Covid-19,2020,"INTRODUCTION: Asymptomatic maintenance hemodialysis patients with acute respiratory corona virus-2 (SARS-COV-2) are missed with pre-dialysis screening without testing. The possible ideal strategy of testing each patient before each shift with reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is not feasible. We aimed to study the effectiveness of fortnightly screening with RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 in curbing transmission. METHODS: Between July 1, 2020 and September 30, 2020, all 273 patients receiving hemodialysis were subjected to fortnightly testing for SARS-Cov-2 in the unit to detect asymptomatic patients. The cost and effectiveness of universal testing in preventing transmission were analyzed using susceptible-infectious-removed (SIR) modeling assuming R0 of 2.2. RESULTS: Of 273 MHD patients, 55 (20.1%) found infected with SARS-CoV-2 over 3 months. Six (10.9%) were symptomatic, and 49 (89.1%) asymptomatic at the time of testing. Six (10.9%) asymptomatic patients develop symptoms later, and 43 (78.2%) remained asymptomatic. A total of seven (6.1%) HCWs also tested positive for the virus. Fortnightly universal testing is cost-effective, and SIR modeling proved effective in preventing person-to-person transmission. CONCLUSIONS: Repeated universal testing in maintenance hemodialysis patients detected 89% of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 patients over 3 months and appeared to be an effective strategy to prevent person-to-person transmission in the dialysis unit.","Patel, Manas R; Kushwaha, Ravi S; Behera, Manas; Bhadauria, Dharmendra S; Yachha, Monika; Kaul, Anupma; Prasad, Narayan",Sem. dial,,860
438602,Coronavirus: a clinical update of Covid-19,2020,"INTRODUCTION: Relatively limited data are available regarding paediatric COVID-19. Although most children appear to have mild or asymptomatic infections, infants and those with comorbidities are at increased risk of experiencing more severe illness and requiring hospitalisation due to COVID-19. The recent but uncommon association of SARS-CoV-2 infection with development of a multisystem inflammatory syndrome has heightened the importance of understanding paediatric SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The Paediatric Emergency Research Network-COVID-19 cohort study is a rapid, global, prospective cohort study enrolling 12 500 children who are tested for acute SARS-CoV-2 infection. 47 emergency departments across 12 countries on four continents will participate. At enrolment, regardless of SARS-CoV-2 test results, all children will have the same information collected, including clinical, epidemiological, laboratory, imaging and outcome data. Interventions and outcome data will be collected for hospitalised children. For all children, follow-up at 14 and 90 days will collect information on further medical care received, and long-term sequelae, respectively. Statistical models will be designed to identify risk factors for infection and severe outcomes. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Sites will seek ethical approval locally, and informed consent will be obtained. There is no direct risk or benefit of study participation. Weekly interim analysis will allow for real-time data sharing with regional, national, and international policy makers. Harmonisation and sharing of investigation materials with WHO, will contribute to synergising global efforts for the clinical characterisation of paediatric COVID-19. Our findings will enable the implementation of countermeasures to reduce viral transmission and severe COVID-19 outcomes in children.

451108,Should ethanol be considered a treatment for COVID-19?,2020,"Maintaining hospital workers' psychological health is essential for hospitals' capacities to sustain organizational functioning during the COVID-19 pandemic. Workers' personal resilience can be an important factor in preserving psychological health, but how this exactly works in high stakes situations, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, requires further exploration. Similarly, the role of team social climate as contributor to individual psychological health seems obvious, but how it exactly prevents workers from developing depressive complaints in prolonged crises remains under investigated. The present paper therefore applies conservation of resources theory to study the relationships between resilience, team social climate, and depressive complaints, specifically focusing on worries about infections as an important explanatory mechanism. Based on questionnaire data of 1126 workers from five hospitals in the Netherlands during the second peak of the pandemic, this paper estimates a moderated-mediation model. This model shows that personal resilience negatively relates to depressive complaints (beta = -0.99, p &lt; 0.001, 95%CI = -1.45--0.53), partially as personal resilience is negatively associated with worries about infections (beta = -0.42, p &lt; 0.001, 95%CI = -0.50--0.33) which in turn are positively related to depressive complaints (beta = 0.75, p &lt; 0.001, 95% CI = 0.31-1.19). Additionally, team social climate is associated with a lower effect of worries about being infected and infecting others on depressive complaints (beta = -0.88, p = 0.03, 95% CI = -1.68--0.09). These findings suggest that resilience can be an important individual level resource in preventing depressive complaints. Moreover, the findings imply that hospitals have an important responsibility to maintain a good team social climate to shield workers from infection related worries building up to depressive complaints.","Fleuren, B.

451937,Knowledge and attitudes towards COVID-19 among emergency medical service workers,2020,"Background: The COVID-19 global pandemic inspired an unprecedented surge in virtual health care. Safety precautions limited in-person urgent care options, despite high patient demand. This study describes how one children's health system redeployed clinical health professionals to expand existing pediatric, urgent care, on-demand telemedicine in the early months of the United States' pandemic response. Patient utilization and visit characteristics during the pandemic are contextualized relative to pre-pandemic, business-as-usual (BAU) operations. Materials and Methods: This IRB-approved study is a descriptive, retrospective analysis. Key elements of the clinician redeployment process and shift in physician workflow are described. Retrospective data analysis included routine patient and visit characteristics for urgent care, on-demand telemedicine services received January to May 2020. BAU represented telemedicine encounters between January and May 2019. Results: Twenty-eight redeployed pediatricians and advanced practice registered nurses were trained and credentialed to assist the on-demand pediatrician team on the existing telemedicine platform. During 2020, providers completed 5,055 telemedicine visits, a 168% increase over the same timeframe in 2019. Pre-pandemic visit wait time was 6.29 ± 5.4 min, which increased to 23.25 ± 34.30 min during 2020. Top chief complaints included skin-related concerns (27.9%) and upper respiratory infections (20.2%) and were consistent across years. Patient satisfaction with provider and platform were high. Discussion: By engaging and training redeployed clinicians during the pandemic response, health care access was maintained for thousands of patients. Conclusion: Where regulations allow, clinical health professionals can be trained and redeployed rapidly to on-demand telemedicine platforms to successfully meet spontaneous increases in demand for virtual care.","Murren-Boezem, Joanne; Solo-Josephson, Patricia; Zettler-Greeley, Cynthia M",Telemed. j. e. health,,860

458694,Associations Between Primary Care Provider Shortage Areas and County-Level COVID-19 Infection and Mortality Rates in the USA,2020,"OBJECTIVE: To keep patients healthy and safe during the pandemic, payers and the Federal Government temporarily relaxed restrictions, expanded the eligible provider list for providing telehealth services, and developed a reimbursement structure. Physical therapists were uniquely challenged during the pandemic, requiring a reassessment of techniques and strategies in order to best support patients. The purpose of this case report is to describe a musculoskeletal institution's experience with implementing telehealth physical therapy. METHODS (CASE DESCRIPTION): Previous telehealth experience enabled the infrastructure of a wide-scale adoption across institutions response to the Covid-19 pandemic. However, to fill in training gaps for HSS outpatient physical therapists, HSS Rehabilitation developed a robust education and implementation program. This training was influenced by clinician and patient surveys as well as the development of a published HSS Rehabilitation telehealth guide. Prior to performing telehealth physical therapist visits, clinicians were required to complete all training material to ensure comfortability and confidence. RESULTS: The adoption of telehealth among clinicians was born out of necessaity, however the speed in which HSS rehabilitation pivoted was critical to avoid lapses in care. In a four week period after the NYC shelter in-place orders, 173 therapists were trained and performing virtual visits. HSS rehabilitation determined telehealth physical therapy had quicker access to care, similar patient satisifaction, and increase geographical outreach when compared to in-person care. CONCLUSIONS: The tranisition to telehealth physical therapy included a multi-step process that provided clinician training, establishment of protocols and guidelines, and obtaining a better understanding of the patient experience. Telehealth physical therapy has shown early benefits such as improving patient access to care, and better continuity of care for patients traveling. Even after the current public health emergency, there is a place for high value telehealth physical therapy in caring for patients with musculoskeletal conditions.","Grundstein, M Jake; Fisher, Charles; Titmuss, Matthew; Cioppa-Mosca, JeMe",Phys. ther,,860

It first identifies provider-delivered tele-interventions that can enhance OUD services in each of the four stages, including family outreach, family engagement, family-focused intervention, and family-focused recovery maintenance. It then introduces several types of direct-to-family tele-supports that can be used to supplement provider-delivered interventions. These include both synchronous tele-supports (remote interactions that occur in real time) such as helplines, peer-to-peer coaching, and online support groups; and asynchronous tele-supports (communications that occur without participants being simultaneously present) such as automated text messaging, self-directed internet-based courses, and digital web support.","Hogue, Aaron; Bobek, Molly; Levy, Sharon; Henderson, Craig E; Fishman, Marc; Becker, Sara J; Dauber, Sarah; Porter, Nicole; Wenzel, Kevin",J Marital Fam Ther,,860
472672,Impact of antihypertensive agents on clinical course and in-hospital mortality: analysis of 169 hypertensive patients hospitalized for COVID-19,2020,"African swine fever (ASF) was first identified in Estonia in 2014, initially detected in wild boar and spreading to affect almost the whole country from late 2016 onwards. Passive surveillance and the control measures applied in Estonia are the main actions in the attempt to control the wild boar population and therefore limit the spread of ASF. Implementation and success of both activities depend mainly on the involvement and commitment of the executing force: the Estonian hunters. Thus, their acceptance of the measures is of utmost importance and with the help of participatory methods, their acceptability can be assessed. Participatory epidemiology allows the involvement of key stakeholders in planning control measures and surveillance strategies and gathering information otherwise inaccessible. By conducting focus group discussions and utilizing participatory tools, this study aimed to assess the acceptance of ASF control measures by hunters in Estonia. Furthermore, the study aimed to detect means to improve the motivation of hunters to support passive surveillance. Among hunters, the results ranked the trust in lower authorities (e.g. local official veterinarians) towards implementing control measures as high (in contrast to higher officials e.g. 'Ministry of Rural Affairs'), while perceiving themselves as the most trustworthy group among those implementing ASF control measures. Hunting and every measure supporting increased hunting, for example selective hunting, bait feeding and incentives for hunting wild boar, were deemed favourable for hunters. These measures also received the highest trust for controlling ASF. All measures hindering hunting and the movement of wildlife, for example fencing or involvement of the army in ASF control, were described as unpleasant or even unethical and trust in these measures to control the disease successfully was lacking. When assessing the perceived consequences for hunters of finding a dead wild boar, arising financial costs, additional workload and time consumption were highlighted. In line with these results, the two tools with the strongest motivational effect for taking part in passive surveillance were: (1) higher monetary incentives as compensation for the hunters' work, and (2) the reduction of the negative consequences by limiting the hunters' duties to solely reporting found dead wild boar. In conclusion, participatory methods can be used as a highly suitable tool for the evaluation of acceptance of measures and surveillance systems. Potentially, the results can help to improve control and passive surveillance in Estonia, as well as functioning as an example for other countries battling or awaiting ASF.","Urner, Nico; Mõtus, Kerli; Nurmoja, Imbi; Schulz, Jana; Sauter-Louis, Carola; Staubach, Christoph; Conraths, Franz J; Schulz, Katja",Prev Vet Med,,860

To achieve this aim, a methodology is proposed based on the Pareto analysis, fuzzy theory, total interpretive structural modelling (TISM), and Matriced Impacts Cruoses Multiplication Applique a un Classement techniques (MICMAC). The proposed methodology is tested using experienced supply chain practitioners as well as academic experts' inputs from the emerging economy. This study reveals the influential relationships and indispensable links between the drivers using fuzzy TISM to improve the SCS in the context of COVID-19. Findings also reveal that financial support from the government as well as from the supply chain partners is required to tackle the immediate shock on SCS due to COVID-19.

The study developed two broad models to analyse the relationship between the stated factors at the current level and forecast level. The results show that improvement in the environmental sustainability rating and financial efficiency reduces the COVID-19 cases, while continued economic growth and changes in price level likely to exacerbate the COVID-19 cases across countries. The forecast results suggest the U-shaped relationship between COVID-19 cases and carbon damages controlling financial development, price level and environmental sustainability rating. The variance decomposition analysis shows that carbon damages, environmental sustainability rating and price level changes will largely influence COVID-19 cases over the next year.

On the one hand, GHS might be able to give priority to health problems on the political agenda-setting, on the other, however, it might open up space for public security actors in decision-making processes to the detriment of the power of health authorities. This article critically analyzes the concept and the progress of the GHS agenda seeking to demonstrate that there can be no security in matters of public health when sustainability in its multiple dimensions is not taken into account. At the end, sustainability has a twofold responsibility: to maintain the consistency and permanence of emergency response actions, especially with investments in public health systems, with universal access, and to minimize the structural causes of pandemics linked to the environment.","Ventura, Deisy de Freitas Lima; di Giulio, Gabriela Marques; Rached, Danielle Hanna",Ambient.

495710,Ethical dilemmas in COVID-19 times: how to decide who lives and who dies?,2020,"As of November 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic continues to rage across the world. One of the measures that has been taken to curb the spread of the virus is blanket stay-at-home orders. Staying at home significantly limits close contact with others and can, thus, decrease the number of new cases. However, if people refrain from going out, this will cause significant economic damage. For this reason, some people think that these orders should be revoked after a short period of time, and people should get out more often. However, if blanket stay-at-home restrictions are lifted before a significant decrease is seen in the number of new cases, the number of infected people is likely to increase within a short period. This will, in turn, hasten the next round of blanket stay-at-home orders and lead to a further reduction in people who can leave their home. Against this backdrop, this study examines below phenomena, through a multi-agent simulation. The early removal strategies of stay-at-home orders for increasing the number of people leaving their homes have the effect of both increasing and decreasing the number of such people. Therefore, we consider the strategies do not lead to a sufficient increase in the overall number of people leaving their homes. To examine these phenomena, we conducted the simulations that consist of six scenarios with the different removal condition of stay-at-home orders. As a result, we could confirm that when more removal conditions of stay-at-home orders were eased, the tendencies of more number of infected people and death people were increasing with some exceptions. In contrast, there were almost no differences among the numbers of people leaving their home of these scenarios. Based on the results, we also examined the possibility of a strategy that covers both infected people and the number of people allowed to leave their homes.","Omae, Y.; Kakimoto, Y.; Toyotani, J.; Hara, K.; Gon, Y.; Takahashi, H.",International Journal of Innovative Computing Information and Control,,860

504233,Investigation of the frequency of COVID-19 in patients treated with intravesical BCG,2020,"One of the most impact issues in recent years refers to the COVID-19 pandemic, the consequences of which thousands of deaths recorded worldwide, are still inferior understood. Its impacts on the environment and aquatic biota constitute a fertile field of investigation. Thus, to predict the impact of the indiscriminate use of azithromycin (AZT) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) in this pandemic context, we aim to assess their toxicological risks when isolated or in combination, using zebrafish (Danio rerio) as a model system. In summary, we observed that 72 h of exposure to AZT and HCQ (alone or in binary combination, both at 2.5 μg/L) induced the reduction of total protein levels, accompanied by increased levels of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances, hydrogen peroxide, reactive oxygen species and nitrite, suggesting a REDOX imbalance and possible oxidative stress. Molecular docking analysis further supported this data by demonstrating a strong affinity of AZT and HCQ with their potential antioxidant targets (catalase and superoxide dismutase). In the protein-protein interaction network analysis, AZT showed a putative interaction with different cytochrome P450 molecules, while HCQ demonstrated interaction with caspase-3. The functional enrichment analysis also demonstrated diverse biological processes and molecular mechanisms related to the maintenance of REDOX homeostasis. Moreover, we also demonstrated an increase in the AChE activity followed by a reduction in the neuromasts of the head when zebrafish were exposed to the mixture AZT+HCQ. These data suggest a neurotoxic effect of the drugs. Altogether, our study demonstrated that short exposure to AZT, HCQ or their mixture induced physiological alterations in adult zebrafish. These effects can compromise the health of these animals, suggesting that the increase of AZT and HCQ due to COVID-19 pandemic can negatively impact freshwater ecosystems.","Mendonça-Gomes, Juliana Moreira da Costa Araújo Amanda Pereira da Luz Thiarlen Marinho Charlie-Silva Ives Braz Helyson Lucas Bezerra Jorge Roberta Jeane Bezerra Ahmed Mohamed Ahmed Ibrahim Nóbrega Rafael Henrique Vogel Christoph F.

505578,COVID-19 and acute myocarditis: current literature review and diagnostic challenges,2020,"BACKGROUND: Mechanical ventilation (MV) is a core intensive care unit (ICU) therapy. Significant inter- and intra- patient variability in lung mechanics and condition makes managing MV difficult. Accurate prediction of patient-specific response to changes in MV settings would enable optimised, personalised, and more productive care, improving outcomes and reducing cost. This study develops a generalised digital clone model, or in-silico virtual patient, to accurately predict lung mechanics in response to changes in MV. METHODS: An identifiable, nonlinear hysteresis loop model (HLM) captures patient-specific lung dynamics identified from measured ventilator data. Identification and creation of the virtual patient model is fully automated using the hysteresis loop analysis (HLA) method to identify lung elastances from clinical data. Performance is evaluated using clinical data from 18 volume-control (VC) and 14 pressure-control (PC) ventilated patients who underwent step-wise recruitment maneuvers. RESULTS: Patient-specific virtual patient models accurately predict lung response for changes in PEEP up to 12 cmH2O for both volume and pressure control cohorts. R2 values for predicting peak inspiration pressure (PIP) and additional retained lung volume, Vfrc in VC, are R2=0.86 and R2=0.90 for 106 predictions over 18 patients. For 14 PC patients and 84 predictions, predicting peak inspiratory volume (PIV) and Vfrc yield R2=0.86 and R2=0.83. Absolute PIP, PIV and Vfrc errors are relatively small. CONCLUSIONS: Overall results validate the accuracy and versatility of the virtual patient model for capturing and predicting nonlinear changes in patient-specific lung mechanics. Accurate response prediction enables mechanically and physiologically relevant virtual patients to guide personalised and optimised MV therapy.","Zhou, Cong; Chase, J Geoffrey; Knopp, Jennifer; Sun, Qianhui; Tawhai, Merryn; Möller, Knut; Heines, Serge J; Bergmans, Dennis C; Shaw, Geoffrey M; Desaive, Thomas",Comput Methods Programs Biomed,,860

While the risks and benefits of noninvasive techniques versus early invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) are intensely debated, actual evidence is lacking. We sought to assess the risks and benefits of different respiratory support strategies, employed in intensive care units during the first months of the COVID-19 pandemic on intubation and intensive care unit (ICU) mortality rates. METHODS: Subanalysis of a prospective, multinational registry of critically ill COVID-19 patients. Patients were subclassified into standard oxygen therapy &#8805;10 L/min (SOT), high-flow oxygen therapy (HFNC), noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation (NIV), and early IMV, according to the respiratory support strategy employed at the day of admission to ICU. Propensity score matching was performed to ensure comparability between groups. RESULTS: Initially, 1421 patients were assessed for possible study inclusion. Of these, 351 patients (85 SOT, 87 HFNC, 87 NIV, and 92 IMV) remained eligible for full analysis after propensity score matching. 55% of patients initially receiving noninvasive respiratory support required IMV. The intubation rate was lower in patients initially ventilated with HFNC and NIV compared to those who received SOT (SOT: 64%, HFNC: 52%, NIV: 49%, p = 0.025). Compared to the other respiratory support strategies, NIV was associated with a higher overall ICU mortality (SOT: 18%, HFNC: 20%, NIV: 37%, IMV: 25%, p = 0.016). CONCLUSION: In this cohort of critically ill patients with COVID-19, a trial of HFNC appeared to be the most balanced initial respiratory support strategy, given the reduced intubation rate and comparable ICU mortality rate. Nonetheless, considering the uncertainty and stress associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, SOT and early IMV represented safe initial respiratory support strategies. The presented findings, in agreement with classic ARDS literature, suggest that NIV should be avoided whenever possible due to the elevated ICU mortality risk.","Wendel Garcia, Pedro D; Aguirre-Bermeo, Hernán; Buehler, Philipp K; Alfaro-Farias, Mario; Yuen, Bernd; David, Sascha; Tschoellitsch, Thomas; Wengenmayer, Tobias; Korsos, Anita; Fogagnolo, Alberto; Kleger, Gian-Reto; Wu, Maddalena A; Colombo, Riccardo; Turrini, Fabrizio; Potalivo, Antonella; Rezoagli, Emanuele; Rodríguez-García, Raquel; Castro, Pedro; Lander-Azcona, Arantxa; Martín-Delgado, Maria C; Lozano-Gómez, Herminia; Ensner, Rolf; Michot, Marc P; Gehring, Nadine; Schott, Peter; Siegemund, Martin; Merki, Lukas; Wiegand, Jan; Jeitziner, Marie M; Laube, Marcus; Salomon, Petra; Hillgaertner, Frank; Dullenkopf, Alexander; Ksouri, Hatem; Cereghetti, Sara; Grazioli, Serge; Bürkle, Christian; Marrel, Julien; Fleisch, Isabelle; Perez, Marie-Helene; Baltussen Weber, Anja; Ceruti, Samuele; Marquardt, Katharina; Hübner, Tobias; Redecker, Hermann; Studhalter, Michael; Stephan, Michael; Selz, Daniela; Pietsch, Urs; Ristic, Anette",Crit Care,,860

594208,Bundle for pediatric COVID-19 sepsis,2021,"BACKGROUND: Severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) is characterized by a proinflammatory state with high mortality. Statins have anti‐inflammatory effects and may attenuate the severity of COVID‐19. METHODS AND RESULTS: An observational study of all consecutive adult patients with COVID‐19 admitted to a single center located in Bronx, New York, was conducted from March 1, 2020, to May 2, 2020. Patients were grouped as those who did and those who did not receive a statin, and in‐hospital mortality was compared by competing events regression. In addition, propensity score matching and inverse probability treatment weighting were used in survival models to examine the association between statin use and death during hospitalization. A total of 4252 patients were admitted with COVID‐19. Diabetes mellitus modified the association between statin use and in‐hospital mortality. Patients with diabetes mellitus on a statin (n=983) were older (69±11 versus 67±14 years; P<0.01), had lower inflammatory markers (C‐reactive protein, 10.2; interquartile range, 4.5–18.4 versus 12.9; interquartile range, 5.9–21.4 mg/dL; P<0.01) and reduced cumulative in‐hospital mortality (24% versus 39%; P<0.01) than those not on a statin (n=1283). No difference in hospital mortality was noted in patients without diabetes mellitus on or off statin (20% versus 21%; P=0.82). Propensity score matching (hazard ratio, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.83–0.94; P<0.01) and inverse probability treatment weighting (HR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.84–0.92; P<0.01) showed a 12% lower risk of death during hospitalization for statin users than for nonusers. CONCLUSIONS: Statin use was associated with reduced in‐hospital mortality from COVID‐19 in patients with diabetes mellitus. These findings, if validated, may further reemphasize administration of statins to patients with diabetes mellitus during the COVID‐19 era.","Saeed, Omar; Castagna, Francesco; Agalliu, Ilir; Xue, Xiaonan; Patel, Snehal R.; Rochlani, Yogita; Kataria, Rachna; Vukelic, Sasa; Sims, Daniel B.; Alvarez, Chikezie; Rivas‐Lasarte, Mercedes; Garcia, Mario J.; Jorde, Ulrich P.",J Am Heart Assoc,https://doi.org/10.1161/jaha.120.018475; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33092446/,860

662090,"Is There a Link between COVID-19 Mortality with Genus, Age, ABO Blood Group Type, and ACE2 Gene Polymorphism?",2020-08-11,"BACKGROUND: Knowledge of infection prevention and control (IPC) procedures among healthcare workers (HCWs) is crucial for effective IPC. Compliance with IPC measures has critical implications for HCWs safety, patient protection and the care environment. AIMS: To discuss the body of available literature regarding HCWs' knowledge of IPC and highlight potential factors that may influence compliance to IPC precautions. DESIGN: A systematic review. A protocol was developed based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analysis [PRISMA] statement. DATA SOURCES: Electronic databases (PubMed, CINAHL, Embase, Proquest, Wiley online library, Medline, and Nature) were searched from 1 January 2006 to 31 January 2021 in the English language using the following keywords alone or in combination: knowledge, awareness, healthcare workers, infection, compliance, comply, control, prevention, factors. 3417 papers were identified and 30 papers were included in the review. RESULTS: Overall, the level of HCW knowledge of IPC appears to be adequate, good, and/or high concerning standard precautions, hand hygiene, and care pertaining to urinary catheters. Acceptable levels of knowledge were also detected in regards to IPC measures for specific diseases including TB, MRSA, MERS-CoV, COVID-19 and Ebola. However, gaps were identified in several HCWs' knowledge concerning occupational vaccinations, the modes of transmission of infectious diseases, and the risk of infection from needle stick and sharps injuries. Several factors for noncompliance surrounding IPC guidelines are discussed, as are recommendations for improving adherence to those guidelines. CONCLUSION: Embracing a multifaceted approach towards improving IPC-intervention strategies is highly suggested. The goal being to improve compliance among HCWs with IPC measures is necessary.","Alhumaid, Saad; Al Mutair, Abbas; Al Alawi, Zainab; Alsuliman, Murtadha; Ahmed, Gasmelseed Y.; Rabaan, Ali A.; Al-Tawfiq, Jaffar A.; Al-Omari, Awad",Antimicrob Resist Infect Control,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13756-021-00957-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34082822/,860

664709,The Impact of COVID-19 on the Cardiovascular System,2021,"AIM: To confirm the presence of extracellular vesicles (EVs) in cell-free saliva (CFS) of children with asthma and describe the isolated EV population. METHODS: A pooled sample of CFS EVs isolated from 180 participants using ExoQuick-TC was examined in downstream analyses. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used to confirm the presence of EVs. Nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) and single particle interferometric reflectance imaging sensing (SP-IRIS) with fluorescence were used for sizing, counting, and phenotyping of EVs. Capillary immunoassays were used for protein quantitation. RESULTS: TEM confirmed the presence of EVs of diverse sizes, indicating the prep contained a heterogeneous population of EVs. Capillary immunoassays confirmed the presence of EV-associated proteins (CD9, CD63, CD81, ICAM-1, and ANXA5) and indicated limited cellular contamination. As others have also reported, there were discrepancies in the EV sizing and enumeration across platforms. Fluorescent NTA detected particles with a mode diameter of ~90 nm, whereas SP-IRIS reported sizes of ~55–60 nm that more closely approximated the TEM results. Consistent with protein immunoassay results, SP-IRIS with fluorescence showed that the majority of these EVs were CD9- and CD63-positive, with little expression of CD81. CONCLUSION: EVs from CFS can be isolated using a high-throughput method that can be scaled to large epidemiological studies. To our knowledge, we are the first to characterize CFS EVs from patients with asthma. The use of CFS EVs as potential novel biomarkers in asthma warrants further investigation and opens a new avenue of research for future studies.","Comfort, Nicole; Bloomquist, Tessa R.; Shephard, Alex P.; Petty, Carter R.; Cunningham, Amparito; Hauptman, Marissa; Phipatanakul, Wanda; Baccarelli, Andrea",Extracell Vesicles Circ Nucl Acids,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34368811/; https://doi.org/10.20517/evcna.2020.09,860
