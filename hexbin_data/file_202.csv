506,506,506,Evolution of size and pattern in the social amoebas,15.504622,2.0422032,2007-06-11,"A fundamental goal of biology is to understand how novel phenotypes evolved through changes in existing genes. The Dictyostelia or social amoebas represent a simple form of multicellularity, where starving cells aggregate to build fruiting structures. This review summarizes efforts to provide a framework for investigating the genetic changes that generated novel morphologies in the Dictyostelia. The foundation is a recently constructed molecular phylogeny of the Dictyostelia, which was used to examine trends in the evolution of novel forms and in the divergence of genes that shape these forms. There is a major trend towards the formation of large unbranched fruiting bodies, which is correlated with the use of cyclic AMP (cAMP) as a secreted signal to coordinate cell aggregation. The role of cAMP in aggregation arose through co‐option of a pathway that originally acted to coordinate fruiting body formation. The genotypic changes that caused this innovation and the role of dynamic cAMP signaling in defining fruiting body size and pattern throughout social amoeba evolution are discussed.

One uses unnatural molecules to reproduce emergent behaviours from natural biology, with the goal of creating artificial life. The other seeks interchangeable parts from natural biology to assemble into systems that function unnaturally. Either way, a synthetic goal forces scientists to cross uncharted ground to encounter and solve problems that are not easily encountered through analysis. This drives the emergence of new paradigms in ways that analysis cannot easily do. Synthetic biology has generated diagnostic tools that improve the care of patients with infectious diseases, as well as devices that oscillate, creep and play tic-tac-toe.","Benner, Steven A.; Sismour, A.

Two replicate experiments on rats were performed to determine if similar changes could be detected in animals exposed under a comparable regime, which was based on average, induced‐current densities and on the chronology of reproductive development, as dosimetrically and biologically scaled. Beginning at three months of age, female rats of the F(0) generation and their subsequent offspring were chronically exposed to a 60‐Hz electric field (100 kV/ m unperturbed) for 19 h/day for the duration of experimentation. After four weeks of exposure, F(0) female rats were mated to unexposed male rats during the field‐off period. No significant developmental effects were detected in their litters, confirming our previous results with swine and rats. The F(0) females were mated for a second time at 7.2 months of age, and the fetuses were evaluated shortly before term. In the first experiments, the incidence of intrauterine mortality was significantly less in exposed than in sham‐exposed litters, and there was a tendency (P = 0.12) for an increased incidence of malformed fetuses in exposed litters. Neither end point was significantly affected in the second experiment. Copulatory behavior of the female F(1) offspring, which were bred at three months of age, was not affected in either experiment. There was a statistically significant decrease in the fertility of F(1) exposed females and a significant increase in the fraction of exposed litters with malformed fetuses in the first experiment; both end points were essentially the same in the sham and exposed groups of the second experiment. That the significant effects detected in the first experiment were not seen in the second may be attributed to random or biological variation. Alternatively, the finding may indicate that the response threshold for induction of malformations lies near 100 kV/m.","Rommereim, D. N.; Kaune, W. T.; Buschbom, R. L.; Phillips, R. D.; Sikov, M.

SP16 is a short polypeptide that mimics the LRP1 binding portion of alpha-1 antitrypsin. METHODS: A pilot phase I, first-in-man, randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled safety study was conducted to evaluate a subcutaneous injection at three dose levels of SP16 (0.0125, 0.05, and 0.2 mg/kg [up to 12 mg]) or matching placebo in 3:1 ratio in healthy individuals. Safety monitoring included vital signs, laboratory examinations (including hematology, coagulation, platelet function, chemistry, myocardial toxicity) and electrocardiography (to measure effect on PR, QRS, and QTc). RESULTS: Treatment with SP16 was not associated with treatment related serious adverse events. SP16 was associated with mild-moderate pain at the time of injection that was significantly higher than placebo on a 0–10 pain scale (6.0+/-1.4 [0.2 mg/kg] versus 1.5+/-2.1 [placebo], P = 0.0088). No differences in vital signs, laboratory examinations and electrocardiography were found in those treated with SP16 versus placebo.

23976,23976,23976,Conclusion: Contributions of Multiple Representations to Biological Education,15.431998,2.0138469,2013-01-15,"Diagnostic virology is to identify the etiologic cause of infection from patient’s samples. In the past the diagnostic virology relied on three classical techniques to make a diagnosis of viral infection: (a) virus isolation by direct virus cultivation, (b) viral antigen detection, (c) indirect detection of virus-specific antibodies. While being important tools in the diagnostic virology today, these techniques are time-consuming and require specific tools such as cultivation media, cell or tissue cultures, antibodies, purified antigens. In the past decade the number of new molecular-based methods grew rapidly and gained more popularity in diagnostic labs. The core of these techniques constitutes of techniques based on nucleic acid detection by specific amplification, hybridization, and/or sequencing (reviewed in ref. [1]). The most nucleic acid-based diagnostic methods are simple, speed, sensitive and specific and thus meet the gold four-S-standard for their application in any diagnostic laboratories. The methods are simple and speed because only a specific primer pair and a PCR machine are needed in a lab setting and identification of a viral pathogen takes within few hours. They are sensitive and specific and require only a small amount of patients’ materials to detect a specific nucleotide sequence region. In general, these techniques can be used to detect almost all types of viral pathogens and even to identify multiple viral pathogens or their variants at the same time. In this chapter we focus on detection of viral RNA splicing as a new tool for diagnostic virology.","Majerciak, Vladimir; Zheng, Zhi-Ming",Advanced Techniques in Diagnostic Microbiology,202,1

Since then, the discipline of interventional cardiology has matured rapidly, particularly with regards to ischemic heart disease. As a result, more patients are undergoing percutaneous catheter interventional therapy for ischemic heart disease and fewer patients are undergoing surgical myocardial revascularization. Those patients referred for surgical revascularization are generally older and have more complex problems. Furthermore, as the population ages more patients are referred to surgery for valvular heart disease. The result of these changes is a population of surgical patients older and sicker than previously treated.","DiMarco, Ross F.",Surgical Intensive Care Medicine,202,1

There is a huge anthropomorphic prejudice that although life is unlikely, the just-right Goldilocks terrestrial conditions mean that the just-right balance of minerals and basic small molecules inevitably result in life as we know it throughout our solar system, galaxy, and the rest of the universe. Moreover, when such conditions on planets such as ours may not be quite right for the origin of life, it is popularly opined that asteroids and comets magically produce life or at the very least, the important, if not crucial components of terrestrial life so that life then blooms, when their fragments cruise the solar system, stars, and galaxies, and plummet onto appropriately bedecked planets and moons. It is no longer extraordinary to detect extraterrestrial solar systems. Moreover, since extra-solar system space exploration has commenced, this provides the problem of detecting life with enhanced achievability. Small organisms, which replicate outside of a living cell or host, would not be catalogued as viruses. How about viruses that cohabit with life? On the Earth, viruses are a major, if underestimated, condition of life – will that be the case elsewhere? Detection of extra-solar system viruses, if they exist, requires finding life, since viruses necessitate life to replicate. (It should be noted, though, that viruses could be detected through various types of portable ultra-microscopes, including Electron Microscopes (EM) (scanning and transmission) as well as Atomic Force Microscopes (AFM).) However, extra-solar system detection of life does not oblige that viruses exist ubiquitously. Viruses are important potential components of biospheres because of their multiple interactions and influence on evolution, although viruses are small and obligatory parasitic. In addition, nanotechnology – living or replicating nano-synthetic machine organisms might also be present out there, and require consideration as well. An imposing caveat is that, if found, could some extraterrestrial viruses and synthetic nanotechnological microorganisms infect humans? Possibly, intelligence and cognition may at times be contemporaneous with life. Concomitantly, life and viruses that may be detected, could well be impacted upon by intelligences existing on such exoplanets (and vice versa). Coming to an understanding of the plurality of extraterrestrial intelligence is an optimal objective, in order to avoid causing harm on exoplanets, as well as avoiding conflict and possible human devastation. This is especially the case if we encounter greatly advanced galactic-level civilizations, compared to terrestrial civilizations. Their machine and bionic technologies on the Dyson engineering civilization scale may be prominently superior to ours; their biological expertise may be similarly critically radical. For example, they may use viruses for purposes for which we are barely aware, and which could be utterly deadly for humans. A series of steps is being taken in space exploration. Scientists hypothesize and claim that types of life may be near the Earth, in the solar system, and outside the solar system, similar to ours in the sense that only such conditions, Goldilocks conditions, are key sine qua non requirements, based on our terrestrial chemistry and biochemistry. If detected within the solar system, will life or its remnants resemble terrestrial life? Outside the solar system a similar chauvinism exists, although the likelihood for life, in any event, remains probably low, according to more cautious approaches to the problem. The study of our solar system includes planets, asteroids, comets, and other planetesimals that have been in overall contiguity during several billion years; anthropomorphisms claims life consequently has been developing along terrestrial-type mechanisms. However, a non-anthropomorphic view would surmise, probably not, especially for extra-solar system locales. The prime warning and admonition in all these deliberations is the contamination and damage, which current and past practice and procedures has caused and continues, due to insufficient biocontainment concepts and technology to date. Advances in the development of robotics, artificial intelligence (AI), and high capacity ultrafast quantum computers (QC) greatly enhance the sophisticated control and logical development of extra-solar system studies. Consequently, future long-range manned space exploration seems unwarranted. Clearly, reduced dangers to human health and safety, will result from the use of intelligent machine-based investigations and besides, with increased cost-effectiveness. Space exploration comes at great cost to humanity as a whole and utilizes global resources. Consequently, appropriate organizational measures and planning/cooperation need to be in place. Moreover, the bottom line is that despite all the slogans and claims, there have been next to no financial benefits to our planet as a whole. Such financial and heedless difficulties need to be addressed, the sooner the better. In addition, prior to exposure to exoplanetary life, deep understanding of the problems of infectious diseases and immune dysfunction risks are needed. In addition, global efforts should avoid serendipity and stochasticity as this work should be directed with long-term organization, commitment, scientific, and technological methodology. This chapter briefly reviews such questions assuming a new paradigm for oversight of extrasolar system viral investigations including intelligence and life. Finances are included as an essential adjunct.","Shapshak, Paul",Global Virology III: Virology in the 21st Century,202,30

Despite the exciting efficacy observed in preclinical studies, DNA vaccines have faced challenges in inducing strong immune responses in humans. This unexpected poor immunogenicity has severely hampered the translation of DNA vaccines from investigational medications to licensed products. To overcome this obstacle, tremendous efforts have been made to improve antigen expression and enhance immunogenicity. Among these endeavors, in vivo DNA electroporation (EP) has proved to be a breakthrough technology capable of mediating efficient DNA uptake and resulting in enhanced antigen expression and vaccine immunogenicity. EP-mediated DNA delivery has become one of the major platforms used in clinical trials to evaluate DNA vaccines in humans. In this chapter, in addition to EP delivery, other progress made in DNA vaccine development including plasmid optimization, antigen design, and immunologic adjuvants is also reviewed. Finally, the use of DNA vaccines in the context of clinical trials for infectious diseases and cancer immunotherapy is summarized. Specifically, the strategies that allow DNA vaccines to overcome antigenic diversity for viral infection and break immune tolerance for cancer therapy are explored. Based on the advantages of DNA vaccines and the immense progress, led by the electroporation-mediated vaccine delivery, DNA vaccines appear to have the potential to fundamentally transform the vaccine field, providing important benefits for preventing and curing diseases.","Liu, Li; Morrow, Matthew P.; Bagarazzi, Mark",Handbook of Electroporation,202,1

OBJECTIVE: To identify the prevalence of individuals making major medical treatment decisions for themselves or someone else and to explore the relationships between decisional conflict and circumstances of the decision as well as the decision-maker. DESIGN: Two-phase survey study: in phase 1, we screened for who made a major treatment decision; in phase 2, we asked eligible respondents about their experience making the decision. PARTICIPANTS: Address-based random sample of 4000 Wisconsin residents; 1072 completed phase 1 and 464 completed phase 2. MAIN MEASURES: We asked respondents about types of decisions made, the most difficult decision made, and characteristics of the decision-maker and the decision. We included the Decisional Conflict Scale and four domains of the Health Literacy Questionnaire. Open-ended questions also allowed respondents to describe their experiences. KEY RESULTS: About 43% of respondents reported making a major medical treatment decision. Decisions about major surgery and life support were regarded as the most difficult decisions.

Respondents who reported higher ability to actively engage with healthcare providers (β = − 5.24, p = 0.002) and to understand health information well enough to know what to do (β = − 6.12, p = 0.001) had lower decisional conflict. CONCLUSIONS: The need to make major treatment decisions is likely to increase and making decisions on someone else’s behalf appeared to be especially difficult. Improving communication to encourage patient and family engagement in the decision-making conversation, particularly for individuals with limited health literacy, may be helpful.

Children with special health care needs may have behavioral factors, medical complexities, and/or intellectual disabilities which influence their ability to cooperate for dental treatment. They may have elevated dental fear and anxiety which may not be alleviated with basic behavior guidance strategies alone. The option to offer inhalational nitrous oxide provides an adjunctive method to help reduce a child's pain and anxiety during dental treatment. Inhalational nitrous oxide can be simply administered via a well-fitting nasal hood. Based on the underlying medical condition of the child, it may be necessary to monitor oxygen saturation with pulse oximetry. Administration of 100% oxygen preoperatively and upon completion of treatment is an essential step applicable to all the patients. Children recover quickly from the effects of nitrous oxide after post-treatment oxygenation and can be discharged to the parent without any residual effects. With appropriate case selection and administration technique, inhalational nitrous oxide is a safe and effective technique to provide dental treatment for children with special health care needs.","Ritwik, Priyanshi; Gupta, Kunal",Clin Dent Rev,202,1

Exosomes are nano-sized vesicles secreted into the extracellular space by most types of cells, and are ideal substances for the transmission and integration of signals between cells. Cells can selectively encapsulate biologically active substances, such as lipids, proteins and RNA in exosomes and act through paracrine mechanisms. Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) are important for communication between cells. They can reach the recipient cells through exosomes, causing phenotypic changes and playing a molecular regulatory role in cell function. Elucidating their molecular mechanisms can help identify therapeutic targets or strategies for CVD. Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the most important disease in CVD. Here, we review the role and the regulatory mechanism of exosomal ncRNAs in the pathophysiology of CAD, as well as the potential contribution of exosomal ncRNA to diagnosis and treatment of CAD.","Liu, Jia; Wu, Junduo; Li, Longbo; Li, Tianyi; Wang, Junnan",Front Pharmacol,202,1

We analyzed IgG responses to the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD) in COVID-19 patients admitted to VA Greater Los Angeles (VAGLA) and correlated with clinical outcomes. METHODS: Serially admitted patients from March 20-May 10, 2020 with at least one available residual serum specimen were included in this analysis. Serum samples selected for analysis included first, last, and intermediaries spaced ≥ 5 days apart, as available. Anti-RBD IgG was detected with an enzyme immunoassay (EIA) using recombinant RBD protein. Serum from an uninfected individual collected April 2019 was used as control. The average optical density of the control in triplicate plus 3 standard deviations was considered the threshold positive/negative value. The highest dilution above the threshold value was considered the IgG titer. Clinical groups were defined as asymptomatic, moderate/severe (no ICU) or critical (mechanical ventilation, cytokine storm and/or death). RESULTS: Of the 43 consecutive patients admitted to VAGLA with COVID-19 in this analysis, 40 developed detectable RBD IgG responses with maximum inverse titers (MIT) ranging 100-819,200, geometric mean 12,152. Five patients remained asymptomatic but had positive EIAs with median MIT 3200 (IQR 800–3200). Twenty-five had moderate-severe illness with median MIT 25600 (IQR 6400–102400). Ten patients with critical disease had median MIT 38400 (IQR 8800–51200). The median time to positive IgG was 10 days for asymptomatic (IQR 10,10), 4 days for moderate-severe (IQR 3,15), and 7 days for critical (IQR 3.5,14.5). The figure depicts RBD IgG titers over time after onset of symptoms. Asymptomatic patients had a more gradual rate of increase and lower peak titers, while critical patients had the fastest rate of rise and the highest peak titers. Of the 21 patients with samples > 30 days after symptom onset (range 31–67 days), there was no evidence for decrease in anti-RBD IgG. Kinetics of IgG to SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain by clinical severity CONCLUSION: Following infection with SARS-CoV-2, disease severity correlates with both the rate of increase and peak in antibody titers. Anti-RBD IgG titers did not decrease over the observation period.

The spectrum and attributable outcomes of these infections are unknown. METHODS: Using a matched historical cohort design, HARVI cases identified between July 2013 and June 2018 at a large pediatric referral hospital in Dallas, Texas were defined as patients who tested positive for one of eight respiratory viruses during their hospitalization, had new respiratory symptoms develop during hospitalization, and had symptom onset on a hospitalization day that was greater than the maximum incubation period for the specific respiratory virus. Controls were matched 1:1 for index time, meaning that the control had a hospital length of stay that was at least as long as the length of stay in the matched case prior to viral testing. Controls were also matched for year and month of infection as well as hospital unit and/or age. The primary outcome was additional length of stay following infection or index time. Additional outcomes included transfer to intensive care, need for intubation, hospital charges, and all cause in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: Over the 5-year study period, 317 definite HARVI were identified (0.62 per 1,000 admitted patient days), and only 287 (91%) had a matched control to be included in analysis. Among these cases and matched controls, the median time to index time was 19 days (IQR 10-39 days). The most common causative viruses where rhinovirus/enterovirus (188, 65.5%), RSV (30, 10.5%), parainfluenza virus (28, 9.8%), and seasonal coronaviruses (27, 9.4%). Fewer cases than controls were in an intensive care unit at index time (101 [35.2%] vs. 156 [54.4%]) The mean additional length of stay following index time was shorter in cases than controls (35.2 days vs. 48.1 days, difference = -12.9 days, 95% CI -20.95 to -4.82 days). CONCLUSION: Hospital length of stay for cases with HARVI was not longer than for those without HARVI. Possible explanations include confounding and selection bias. Further studies with carefully selected controls are needed.

Knowledge and compliance with standard precautions are essential to prevent hospitals associated infections and protect patients as well as medical workers from exposure to infectious agents. AIMS: This study aimed to assess the level of knowledge, level of compliance, and associated factors toward compliance with standard precautions among registered nurses in the North of Jordan. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted at three hospitals in the North of Jordan. Two were public hospitals and one was a university-affiliated hospital. A questionnaire concerning the knowledge and compliance with the standard precaution guidelines was distributed among 300 registered nurses of whom 266 completed the questionnaire (response rate 88.7%). RESULTS: 53% of the participants were from governmental hospitals and 57.1% were females. The age median of them was 30 years (IQR = 28–32). The majority of the participants were medical/surgical RNs (33.1%) while only 8.3% of them were from the pediatric/gynecology departments. The overall knowledge score was 16.27 (SD = 3.15), and the total compliance score was 49.15 (SD = 12.36).

According to the Chinese government’s immediate isolation and centralized diagnosis of confirmed cases, and the adoption of epidemic tracking measures on patients to prevent further spread of the epidemic, we divide the population into susceptible, exposed, infectious, quarantine, confirmed and recovered. This paper proposes an SEIR model with isolation measures that simultaneously investigates the infectivity of the incubation period, reflects prevention and control measures and calculates the basic reproduction number of the model. According to the data released by the National Health Commission of the People’s Republic of China, we estimated the parameters of the model and compared the simulation results of the model with actual data. We have considered the trend of the epidemic under different incubation periods of infectious capacity. When the incubation period is not contagious, the peak number of confirmed in the model is 33,870; and when the infectious capacity is 0.1 times the infectious capacity in the infectious period, the peak number of confirmed in the model is 57,950; when the infectious capacity is doubled, the peak number of confirmed will reach 109,300. Moreover, by changing the contact rate in the model, we found that as the intensity of prevention and control measures increase, the peak of the epidemic will come earlier, and the peak number of confirmed will also be significantly reduced. Under extremely strict prevention and control measures, the peak number of confirmed cases has dropped by nearly 50%. In addition, we use the EEMD method to decompose the time series data of the epidemic, and then combine the LSTM model to predict the trend of the epidemic. Compared with the method of directly using LSTM for prediction, more detailed information can be obtained.","Huang, Bo; Zhu, Yimin; Gao, Yongbin; Zeng, Guohui; Zhang, Juan; Liu, Jin; Liu, Li",Appl Intell,202,16

The outdoor and indoor weather data are collected from April to August 2016 using a weather station installed ad hoc in urban settings, and the 52 houses of the five low-income participating communities living in congested and less environment-friendly areas of Faisalabad. The discomfort index values, related to the building design concepts, including (i) house orientation to sunlight and (ii) house ventilation, are calculated from outdoor and indoor dry-bulb and wet-bulb temperatures. Our results show that although June was the hottest month of summer 2016, based on the monthly mean temperature of the Faisalabad region, the month of May produced the highest discomfort levels, which were higher in houses exposed to sunlight and without ventilation. The study also identifies some popular heat mitigation strategies adopted by the five participating low-income communities during various heat-related health complaints. The strategies are gender-biased and have medical, cultural/customary backgrounds. For example, about 52% of the males and 28% of the females drank more water during dehydration, diarrhea, and eye infection. Over 11% and 19% of the males and females, respectively, moved to cooler places during fever.

However, the processes related to the software architecture of HIS are often considered only from low level of abstraction, even for software architecture description. The ISO/IEC/IEEE 42020 defines 6 clauses for architecture process, among them the Architecture Conceptualization process is the subject of this paper. Given the importance of establishing a well-defined software architecture, and considering the difficulties of understanding an architectural standard, and also considering that ISO/IEC/IEEE 42020 has only recently been published, we propose a framework for using the Architecture Conceptualization clause, which leverages high level concepts and elements of software architecture. A case study on a HIS is described.","Santos, Valdicélio Mendes; Misra, Sanjay; Soares, Michel S.",Computational Science and Its Applications - ICCSA 2020,202,10

The present work focus on modelling the spatial distribution of the BSF species relative biomass. Georeferenced data given by the location of the fishing hauls and the corresponding catches are available for a set of different vessels that belong to the longline fishing fleet. A classical geostatistical approach was applied to fit a variogram and evaluate the isotropy of the data. Then, different regression models with fixed, structured and unstructured random effects were fitted under a Bayesian framework, considering the Stochastic Partial Differential Equation (SPDE) methodology under the Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation (INLA), addressing some practical implementation issues.

Since multiple elements are to be analysed to reconsider the risk society theory in the current global landscape characterized by emerging threats, an integrated approach has been chosen in this study for a comprehensive evaluation. The majority of the studies conducted on the relevant subject matter lack quantitative analyses; therefore, this study aims at bridging a gap in this regard by elucidating the parameters and implications of the concepts related to the risk society based on the results obtained by quantitative and qualitative analyses. To this end, a survey (including demographic, sociological and psychological items) on risk and economic uncertainty was designed and conducted online. Secondly, content analysis was done on a set of news items focusing on global economy. The results of the survey evaluated with statistical analyses (ANOVA, t-test and correlation analysis) were used to relate the responses to different aspects and thematic qualities of the risk society theory postulated and developed by Ulrich Beck, Anthony Giddens and other social philosophers. The experimental results of the study revealed certain relationships between demographic characteristics and sociological-psychological elements of the risk society theory and its parameters in the individuals’ attitudes and perception. Correspondingly, repercussions of the risk society theory have been revealed in the news items handled. The majority of the results obtained support the key postulations of the risk society, which can shed light on understanding the significant transformation of our era along with the social attitudes, fears, insecurity and risk perception among individuals. In addition, the findings can lead to further interpretation of the interplay between economy, media, science and politics, opening up new perspectives toward reconsidering “contemporary” risks.","Dursun, Ahu Dereli",Computational Science and Its Applications - ICCSA 2020,202,1

The world is facing formidable challenges in laying down a path towards a sustainable economy. Undoubtedly, several supply-side factors are crucial in sustainability discourse. However, the demand-side factors have a critical role to play in determining—how long-term sustainability would unfold? Globally, the concept of the circular economy (CE) is being advocated as an effective means of ensuring sustainable consumption and production patterns in the times ahead. In this backdrop, this chapter provides a review of the conceptual foundations of the CE as was first proposed by Pearce and Turner, and analyses the scope and methodological framework of CE in terms of its inter-linkages with other fields such as industrial ecology and ecological economics. It further provides an overview of the recent initiatives of the Government of India towards the adoption of CE. Finally, it puts forth an economic perspective towards CE and highlights some potential hindrances in its mainstreaming from the economic methodology point of view in the realm of the neoclassical economic paradigm. It concludes that there is an urgent need to move beyond the techno-centric and business-oriented understanding of CE to a framework that attempts to integrate with the socio-economic realities and development priorities of the developing economies.","Singhal, Robin",Sustainable Development Insights from India,202,1

Though a major portion of the globe is under lockdown due to this deadly virus, the number of causalities is still growing rapidly. Therefore, it is very important to predict the number of infected and fatality cases for the future to overcome the consequences, save the lives of people, and plan accordingly. This paper proposes a data-driven analysis based on univariate Holt’s double exponential smoothening method with parameter optimization and polynomial curve fitting technique for one month ahead forecasting of the death cases in nine profoundly affected countries across the world namely India, USA, Italy, UK, China, France, Iran, Spain, and Germany. In contrast to the complex deep learning-based predictors, the proposed Holt’s model is simple yet efficient enough to give outstanding prediction performance for all the countries under this study and can be further used for the prediction of infections and causalities for the rest of the countries in future. The future estimation of the number of death cases will act as a beneficial tool for the successful allocation of the medical resources and as an early warning to the policymakers and health officials as well as to the residents of the country to boost their self-awareness.","Rai, Sneha; De, Mala",Emerging Technologies During the Era of COVID-19 Pandemic,202,24

Recently, the attention of both scholars and practitioners has turned to an extension of the assessment to the whole Supply Chain (SC). Given the importance of reaching a high level of integration and digital readiness in all the various actors that collaborate in the SC, some Digital Supply Chain (DSC) assessment models have been proposed mainly in the consulting field. However, to fully exploit the benefits of measuring the digital readiness of a SC, companies need also to be supported in the identification and prioritization of the most relevant opportunities triggered by the deployment of DSC projects. To this purpose, this paper presents a framework that links the potentials of DSC implementations with the SC operation processes, highlighting the most suitable technologies to deploy them. The framework has been conceived starting from a literature review and aims at providing a valuable tool to all the stakeholders involved in the transformation towards Digital Supply Chains.","Cimini, Chiara; Pirola, Fabiana; Cavalieri, Sergio",Advances in Production Management Systems,202,1

One of these is the increasing prevalence of local content regulations which are impinging more and more upon the ways those corporations operate, including having an impact upon the scope and nature of corporate social responsibility and sustainable development activities. In this chapter I examine the historical, political and economic context of local content policies, exploring their roots in conflict and the contemporary, contested discourses that lie behind the development of different local content requirements. As local content requirements have become increasingly adopted by countries in the developing world they have displaced activities more generally associated with corporate social responsibility, a move which is synchronous with claims that CSR is a neo-colonial means by which the developed world attempts to continue to exert power over its erstwhile colonies. I explore how this has worked in different contexts, highlighting the rhetorical nature of policy setting, reflecting power struggles on the international stage rather than meaningful or sustainable developments in terms of national or local economies.","Buckler, Sarah",Global Challenges to CSR and Sustainable Development,202,12

We comparatively analyzed the interaction, persistence, and modulation of expression of selected genes and cell viability in an ex vivo model using human MG‐63 osteoblasts of two previously studied and well‐characterized S. aureus clinical strains belonging to the ST239‐SCCmecIII‐t037 and ST228‐SCCmecI‐t041 clones at 3 h and 24 h post‐infection (p.i). S. aureus ATCC12598 ST30‐t076 was used as a control strain. Using imaging flow cytometry (IFC), we found that these strains invaded and persisted in MG‐63 osteoblasts to different extents. The invasion was evaluated at 3 h p.i and persistence at 24 h p.i., in particular: ATCC12598 internalized in 70% and persisted in 50% of MG‐63 cells; ST239‐SCCmecIII internalized in 50% and persisted in 45% of MG‐63 cells; and ST228‐SCCmecI internalized in 30% and persisted in 20% of MG‐63 cells. During the infection period, ST239‐III exerted significant cytotoxic activity resulting from overexpression of hla and psmA and increased expression of the genes involved in adhesion, probably due to the release and re‐entry of bacteria inside MG‐63 cells at 24 h p.i. The lower invasiveness of ST228‐I was also associated with non‐cytotoxic activity inside osteoblasts. This clone was unable to activate sufficient cellular reaction and succumbed inside MG‐63 cells. Our findings support the idea of considering new strategies, based on a translational approach—eukaryotic host–pathogen interaction (EHPI)—and to be applied on a large scale, to predict S. aureus /osteoblast interaction and treat bone infections. Such strategies rely on the study of the genetic and biochemical basis of both pathogen and host.","Bongiorno, Dafne; Musso, Nicolò; Caruso, Giuseppe; Lazzaro, Lorenzo Mattia; Caraci, Filippo; Stefani, Stefania; Campanile, Floriana",Microbiologyopen,202,1

Realising the intelligent recognition and accurate classification of coal flotation froth is a key technology of intelligent separation. At present, the coal flotation process relies on artificial recognition of froth features for adjusting the reagent dosage. However, owing to the low accuracy and subjectivity of artificial recognition, some problems arise, such as reagent wastage and unqualified product quality. Thus, this paper proposes a new froth image classification method based on the maximal-relevance-minimal-redundancy (MR MR)-semi-supervised Gaussian mixture model (SSGMM) hybrid model for recognition of reagent dosage condition in the coal flotation process. First, the features of morphology, colour, and texture are extracted, and the optimal froth image features are screened out using the maximal-relevance-minimal-redundancy (MRMR) feature selection algorithm based on class information. Second, the traditional GMM clusterer is improved, called SSGMM, by introducing a small number of marked samples, the traditional GMM’ problems of unclear training goals, invisible clustering results, and artificially judged clustering results are solved. Then a new hybrid classification model is proposed by combining the MRMR with the modified GMM (SSGMM) which can be named as (MRMR - SSGMM). The optimal froth image features are screened by MRMR to provide the SSGMM classifier. In the process of training and learning the feature samples, using the marked feature samples of froth images to guide the unmarked feature samples. The information of marked feature samples of froth images is mapped to the unmarked feature samples, the classification of the froth images were realised. Finally, the accuracy of the SSGMM classifier is used as the evaluation criterion for the screened features by MRMR. By automatically executing the entire learning process to find the best number of froth image features and the optimal image features, so that the classifier achieves the maximum classification accuracy. Experimental results show that the proposed classification method achieves the best results in accuracy and time, compared with other benchmark classification methods. Application results show that the method can provide reliable guidance for the adjustment of the reagent dosage, realize the accurate and timely control of the reagent dosage, reduce the consumption of the reagent and the incidence of production accidents, and stabilize the product quality in the coal flotation production process.","Cao, Wenyan; Wang, Ranfeng; Fan, Minqiang; Fu, Xiang; Wang, Haoran; Wang, Yulong",Appl Intell,202,1

We hold that such an evaluation must accommodate the necessarily fragile relation between the information that numbers are taken to carry and the policy decisions they are meant to support. In doing so, attention needs to be paid to differences in how that relation is formed. With this in mind, we investigated a public discourse that heavily relied on numbers in the context of introducing, maintaining, and easing the rules and regulations directed to contain the spread of the virus SARS-CoV-2 during the first epidemic wave of COVID-19 in Germany with its peak in early April 2020. We used a public-service broadcasting outlet as data. Our theoretical stance is affiliated with post-structuralist discourse theory. As an outcome, we identified four major related strategies of using numbers, which we named rationalisation, contrast, association and recharging.

METHOD: We distributed a cross-sectional survey from 2/5/2020 to 14/6/2020 to all medical students at UK medical schools. RESULTS: A total of 1145 medical students from 36 medical schools completed the questionnaire. 82.7% of students were willing to volunteer, but only 34.3% had volunteered. The strongest predictors of willingness to volunteer on multiple linear regression were the beliefs that volunteering to work would benefit their medical education (estimate=0.35±0.03, adjusted P < 0.001) and that they would have a positive impact (estimate=0.33±0.03, adjusted P < 0.001). The majority of students were willing to take up a clinical role and were confident in having the necessary skills, but there was a discrepancy between the role’s students were comfortable performing and those they were assigned. Thematic analysis of the issue’s students would face when volunteering identified five themes: safety, professional practice, pressure to volunteer, finances and logistics, and education. CONCLUSIONS: This study identifies areas for consideration from those responsible for workforce planning, healthcare provision, and student safety. We provide recommendations to facilitate a volunteering process that is safer for students, staff, and patients.","Byrne, M; Ashcroft, J; Wan, J; Alexander, L; Harvey, A; Schindler, N; Brassett, C",Br J Surg,202,1

Human infections are reported worldwide, but vaccines have been approved only in China and Korea. Orthohantavirus vaccine development has been pursued with no sense of urgency due to the relative paucity of cases in countries outside China and Korea. However, the orthohantaviruses continuously evolve in hosts and thus the current vaccine may not work as well against some variants. Therefore, a more effective vaccine should be prepared against the orthohantaviruses. In this review, we discuss the issues caused by the orthohantavirus vaccine. Given the pros and cons of the orthohantavirus vaccine, we suggest strategies for the development of better vaccines in terms of pandemic preparedness.","Bae, Joon-Yong; Kim, Jin Il; Park, Mee Sook; Lee, Gee Eun; Park, Heedo; Song, Ki-Joon; Park, Man-Seong",Vaccines (Basel),202,1

The result is complex multidimensional data that pose numerous analytic challenges for downstream interpretation. However, a systematic review of approaches for the downstream analysis of such data has been lacking in the field. In this review, we detail the steps of a typical temporal and spatial analysis, including data pre-processing steps (i.e., quality control, data normalization, the imputation of missing values, and dimensionality reduction), different statistical and machine learning approaches, validation, interpretation, and the extraction of biological information from mass spectrometry data. We also discuss current best practices for these steps based on a collection of independent studies to guide users in selecting the most suitable strategies for their dataset and analysis objectives. Moreover, we also compiled the list of commonly used R software packages for each step of the analysis. These could be easily integrated into one’s analysis pipeline. Furthermore, we guide readers through various analysis steps by applying these workflows to mock and host-pathogen interaction data from public datasets.

Semi-structured qualitative face to face interviews were conducted by trained mental healthcare professionals with mental health service users (n = 26) and caregivers (n = 24) in private rooms at a tertiary health facility, where service users were admitted. Following transcription and translation, data was analysed using framework analysis. There was limited knowledge about their mental health diagnosis by service users and generally low mental health literacy among service users and caregivers. Mental health service users reported experiences of stigma from their own families and communities. Caregivers reported withholding the patient’s diagnosis from the community for fear of being stigmatised, and this fear of stigma carries the risk of negatively affecting care treatment-seeking. Limited mental health knowledge, coupled with a high prevalence of perceived family and community stigma among caregivers and service users, impedes the capacity of caregivers to effectively cope in supporting their family members living with mental illness. There is a need for interventions to provide psychoeducation, reduce community stigma, and support coping strategies for caregivers and people with mental health conditions.","Monnapula-Mazabane, Portia; Petersen, Inge",Curr Psychol,202,1

However, its predictive value for other types of cancer remained unclear. This meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the association between pretreatment LIPI score and therapeutic outcomes in cancer patients treated with ICIs. METHODS: We searched PubMed, Cochrane Library literature databases and EMBASE for abstracts and full-text articles published from the inception of the database until 16th, Nov 2020. Meta-analyses were performed separately for progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) by using the random-effects model. RESULTS: A total of 12 studies involving 4883 patients receiving ICIs treatment were identified for the primary analysis. The pooled results implied that compared with good LIPI score groups, patients with poor or intermediate LIPI score were significantly associated with worse OS (HR=3.33, 95%CI 2.64-4.21, P < 0.001, I(2) = 64.2%; HR=1.71, 95%CI 1.43-2.04, P < 0.001, I(2) = 43.6%, respectively) and PFS (HR=2.73,95%CI 2.00-3.73, P < 0.001, I(2) = 78.2%; HR=1.43, 95%CI 1.28-1.61, P < 0.001, I(2) = 16.3%, respectively). Also, for 1873 patients receiving chemotherapy, a poor LIPI score was significantly associated with worse OS (HR=2.30, 95%CI 1.73-3.07, P < 0.001; I(2) = 56.2%) and PFS (HR=1.92,95%CI 1.69-2.17; P < 0.001; I(2) = 0.0%) compared with good LIPI score groups.

DESIGN : In vitro study using readily available clinical equipment. SETTING Medical-surgical pediatric intensive care unit of a university-affiliated hospital. PATIENTS/SUBJECTS None. INTERVENTIONS Three-, 12-, and 60-mL syringes (Kendall Monoject) with extension tubing were mounted in identical Baxter AS50 infusion pumps. We determined time to alarm after occlusion of the distal tubing. We described and validated a method using capillary tubes to determine startup time to reach steady-state flow and variability of steady-state flow. Data were analyzed using single-factor analysis of variance or linear regression, as appropriate. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS At 5 mL/hr flow, time to alarm occlusion (mean +/- sd) was 1:08 +/- 0:42, 3:35 +/- 0:58, and 27:06 +/- 3:26 minutes for 3-, 12-, and 60-mL syringes, respectively (p < .00001). At a lower flow of 0.2 mL/hr, none of the pumps alarmed despite 30 mins of distal occlusion, regardless of syringe size. Validation testing of the capillary tube volumetric method revealed a sd <5% of the average fluid column displacement. Startup time to reach steady-state flow of 0.2 mL/hr for 60-mL syringes was 76 +/- 40 mins and significantly exceeded 24 +/- 10 mins for 3-mL syringes (p = .041). In one test using a 60-mL syringe, flow remained below 20% of steady state for >3 hrs. Average steady-state flow was similar for the three syringe sizes (p = .2861), but sd of steady-state flow was directly related to syringe size and regressed to a line with r = 1. CONCLUSIONS Syringe size is related to time to reach steady-state flow, time to alarm occlusion, and variability of low-flow infusions.","Neal, D'Anne; Lin, James A",Pediatric critical care medicine : a journal of the Society of Critical Care Medicine and the World Federation of Pediatric Intensive and Critical Care Societies,202,1

The aim of this study is to determine the differences in gastric emptying, gastric distension and metabolic response between two starting distances. MATERIAL AND METHODS This is a prospective randomised study of 60 patients (30 patients with the section at 3 cm and 30 patients at 8 cm from the pylorus). We calculate at 6 and 12 months from surgery gastric emptying by scintigraphy (T1/2 min), gastric volume by CT scan (cc) and metabolic response by blood sample analysis (glucose, HbA1c, insulin, HOMA-IR, GLP-1, GIP and C-peptide). RESULTS Gastric emptying increases the speed significantly in both groups but is greater in the 3-cm group (p < 0.05). Dividing groups into type 2 diabetic patients and non-diabetic patients, the speed in non-diabetic patients is significantly higher for the 3-cm group. Residual volume increases significantly in both groups, and there are no differences between them. One year after surgery, there are significant improvements in the hyperinsulinaemia in the patients of the 3-cm group with respect to the 8-cm group, but only in diabetic patients. No differences between groups are found regarding changes in GLP-1 or GIP. CONCLUSIONS Gastric emptying is faster in patients with antrum resection. The distance does not influence the gastric emptying of diabetic patients. Other mechanisms may explain metabolic response besides GLP-1 and its association with improvements in diabetes via gastric emptying.","Vives, M; Molina, A; Danús, M; Rebenaque, E; Blanco, S; París, M; Sánchez, A; Sabench, F; Del Castillo, D",Obesity surgery,202,7

A strong antiviral response to the viral surface glycoprotein (SU) was noted in both natural and experimental infections. In addition, 143 of 226 FIV-infected animals (63%) also expressed antibodies to the primary binding receptor, CD134, whereas cats infected with other feline RNA viruses, including calicivirus, coronavirus, herpesvirus, and feline leukemia virus, did not. Both affinity-purified anti-CD134 and anti-SU antibodies blocked FIV infection ex vivo. FACS analyses revealed that the anti-CD134 antibodies bound to a cryptic epitope on the receptor that was only exposed when SU bound to CD134. Anti-CD134 binding caused displacement of SU from the surface of the cell and inhibition of infection. The presence of antibodies to CD134 correlated with lower virus loads and a better overall health status in FIV(+) cats, whereas anti-SU antibodies were present independent of health status. The findings are consistent with a role for antireceptor antibodies in protection from virus spread and disease progression.","Grant, Chris K; Fink, Elizabeth A; Sundstrom, Magnus; Torbett, Bruce E; Elder, John H",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,202,1

Two important structural features that participate in the regulatory function of AT include a mobile reactive center loop (RCL) that binds to active-site of coagulation proteases, trapping them in the form of inactive covalent complexes and a basic D-helix that binds to therapeutic heparins and heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) on vascular endothelial cells. The binding of D-helix of AT by therapeutic heparins promotes the reactivity of the serpin with coagulation proteases by several orders of magnitude by both a conformational activation of the serpin and a template (bridging) mechanism. In addition to its essential anticoagulant function, AT elicits a potent anti-inflammatory signaling response when it binds to distinct vascular endothelial cell HSPGs, thereby inducing prostacyclin synthesis. Syndecans-4 has been found as a specific membrane-bound HSPG receptor on endothelial cells that relays the signaling effect of AT to the relevant second messenger molecules in the signal transduction pathways inside the cell. However, following cleavage by coagulation proteases and/or by spontaneous conversion to a latent form, AT loses both its anti-inflammatory activity and high affinity interaction with heparin and HSPGs. Interestingly, these low-affinity heparin conformers of AT elicit potent proapoptotic and antiangiogenic activities by also binding to specific HSPGs by unknown mechanisms. This review article will summarize current knowledge about mechanisms through which different conformers of AT exert their serine protease inhibitory and intracellular signaling functions in these biological pathways.","Rezaie, Alireza R; Giri, Hemant",Journal of thrombosis and haemostasis : JTH,202,16

Central venous pressure (CVP) measurement seems to remain an integral part in hemodynamic monitoring, especially in cardio-surgical ICUs. However, its value as a prognostic marker for organ failure is still unclear. Therefore, we analyzed postoperative CVP values after adult cardiac surgery in a large cohort with regard to its prognostic value for morbidity and mortality. METHODS All adult patients admitted to our ICUs between 2006 and 2019 after cardiac surgery were eligible for inclusion in the study (n = 11,198). We calculated the median initial CVP (miCVP) after admission to the ICU, which returned valid values for 9802 patients. An ROC curve analysis for optimal cut-off miCVP to predict ICU mortality was conducted with consecutive patient allocation into a (a) low miCVP (LCVP) group (≤11 mmHg) and (b) high miCVP (HCVP) group (>11 mmHg). We analyzed the impact of high miCVP on morbidity and mortality by propensity score matching (PSM) and logistic regression. RESULTS ICU mortality was increased in HCVP patients. In addition, patients in the HCVP group required longer mechanical ventilation, had a higher incidence of acute kidney injury, were more frequently treated with renal replacement therapy, and showed a higher risk for postoperative liver dysfunction, parametrized by a postoperative rise of ≥ 10 in MELD Score. Multiple regression analysis confirmed HCVP has an effect on postoperative ICU-mortality and intrahospital mortality, which seems to be independent. CONCLUSIONS A high initial CVP in the early postoperative ICU course after cardiac surgery is associated with worse patient outcome. Whether or not CVP, as a readily and constantly available hemodynamic parameter, should promote clinical efforts regarding diagnostics and/or treatment, warrants further investigations.","Schiefenhövel, Fridtjof; Trauzeddel, Ralf F; Sander, Michael; Heringlake, Matthias; Groesdonk, Heinrich V; Grubitzsch, Herko; Kruppa, Jochen; Berger, Christian; Treskatsch, Sascha; Balzer, Felix",Journal of clinical medicine,202,22

The authors note that ""inequality presence denial"" combines with high-risk contexts, framed by geography and psychohistoric moments (e.g., The Great Recession, COVID-19), to alter diverse children's developmental pathways. The acknowledgement of ""morbid risk"" motivates the urgency for research that builds upon Zigler's innovations and privileges human development imperatives. The case study explores these concepts by examining the challenges and assets available to mothers in a low-income community. The article's closing notes developments in the field of economics that ameliorate human capital theory's conceptual limitations, underscoring human development's theoretical strength in motivating research and policies that are maximally responsive to children's positive identity development.","Nichols Lodato, Bronwyn; Hall, Jennifer; Spencer, Margaret Beale",Development and psychopathology,202,1

Gynecomastia, benign enlargement of the male breast is the most common breast pathology amongst males. The most widely used modality of treatment is liposuction under general anesthesia. To date however there is no published study that specifically addresses to use tumescent anesthesia & use of tranexamic acid in it for excision of gynecomastia. Objective. To evaluate the efficacy of tumescent anesthesia in surgical excision of gynecomastia. Methods. A 4-year study with 100 patients of gynecomastia aged 14 to 47 years were enrolled with follow up for 3 months. All patients were given tumescence anesthesia in each breast comprising subcutaneous infiltration of 500 ml RL, 20 ml 0.5% bupivacaine, 30 ml 2% lignocaine, 1 mg adrenaline & 1 gm tranexamic acid. Breast tissue was excised in each breast by a single infraareolar incision & patients were assessed for intra-op pain and post-op pain by using numeric rating scale (NRS). Results. Bilateral presentation was there in 69 patients and 31 unilateral with 4 recurrent cases. Size of gland excised were 12-14 cms in 53 cases, 15-18 cms in 38 & 19-20 cms in 9 patients. Average surgical time required for each breast was 30 minutes. Intraoperative pain NRS-0 for 66, NRS-1 for 31 & NRS-5 for 03 patients. Postoperative pain for first eight hours was NRS-0 for 69 and NRS-1 for 31 patients. Conclusion. Tumescent anaesthesia for surgical excision of gynecomastia using a periareolar incision is a minimally invasive bloodless and painless technique in which ductal and stromal tissue can be removed resulting in a high level of patient satisfaction. In todays covid era it avoids the use of general anesthesia and electrocautery.","Mohan, Amitabh; Rangwala, Murtuza; Rajendran, Nagamahendran",Surgical innovation,202,20

Comorbid anxiety or depression amplifies fibromyalgia symptoms. The recent recognition of small fiber neuropathy in fibromyalgia patients supports the neuropathic nature of the illness. Corneal confocal microscopy accurately identifies small nerve fiber pathology. The newly developed Small-Fiber Symptom Survey captures the spectrum of small fiber neuropathy symptoms. We aimed to correlate corneal nerve density with different fibromyalgia disease severity questionnaires including the Small-Fiber Symptom Survey. We defined the possible confounding role of comorbid anxiety or depression severity in the clinical-pathological association. METHODS This is a case series of 28 women with fibromyalgia. A single ophthalmologist quantified corneal subbasal plexus nerve density. Corneal innervation was correlated (Spearman ρ) with the following clinical questionnaires scores: Small-Fiber Symptom Survey, Revised Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire, and COMPASS-31 (Composite Autonomic Symptom Survey 31-Item Score). Validated inquiry forms assessed the comorbid anxiety and/or depression severity. RESULTS There were no clinical-pathological correlations in the group as a whole. In the subgroup of fibromyalgia women without severe anxiety or depression (n = 13), there was a strong negative correlation between corneal nerve density with the Small-Fiber Symptom Survey score (ρ = -0.771, p = 0.002) and COMPASS-31 score (ρ = -0.648, p = 0.017). Patients with profound anxiety or depression (n = 15) had more intense symptoms but had not clinical-pathological correlations. CONCLUSIONS Small fiber neuropathy and dysautonomia symptoms correlate with corneal denervation in women with fibromyalgia without severe anxiety or depression. This clinical-pathological association reinforces fibromyalgia as a dysautonomia-related neuropathic pain syndrome. Severe anxiety or depression distorts fibromyalgia symptoms.

CLINICAL CHALLENGES Laparoscopy is distinctly different from traditional open surgery and a reduced working area and loss of depth perception are among the challenges that the surgeon must get to grips with. Indeed, it is often lack of the necessary skills, rather than the cost of equipment, that presents the greatest obstacle. AUDIENCE This article is aimed at practitioners keen to embrace minimally invasive surgery and advises on how to develop excellence in laparoscopic skills. It makes the case for simulation training and outlines methods that can be instituted in practice at low cost and with comparatively little time expenditure. It also describes technological advances that have already increased the success of veterinary 'keyhole' surgery, as well as those that look promising for the future. EVIDENCE BASE Simulation training has been an intense area of research and publication within the past 15 years. This article draws on that evidence base and the experience gained by the author and her research team, which is at the forefront of efforts to develop laparoscopic training for veterinarians.","Fransson, Boel",Journal of feline medicine and surgery,202,16

MATERIAL AND METHODS Three months after the extraction of all mandibular premolars and first molars, two recipient sites were selected. The osteotomies were randomly prepared with either conventional drills (drill sites) or a piezoelectric device (piezoelectric sites). Implants were installed and a submerged healing was allowed. The animals were euthanized in groups of six after 4 and 8 weeks of healing. Biopsies were obtained for histological preparation. Coronal level of osseointegration (bone level) and bone-to-implant contact percentage (BIC%) were evaluated. RESULTS After 4 weeks of healing, the bone level was 0.6 ± 0.9 mm for the piezoelectric sites and 1.6 ± 0.7 mm for the drill sites (p = 0.173). After 8 weeks, the respective measures were 0.9 ± 0.3 mm and 1.0 ± 1.1 mm (p = 0.917). After 4 weeks of healing, a new bone apposed onto the implant surface was found at fractions of 54.9 ± 6.7% and 55.1 ± 16.6% for the piezoelectric and the drill sites, respectively (p = 0.674). The respective total bone fractions, including new and old bone, was 64.0 ± 4.8% and 63.4 ± 20.4% (p = 0.917). After 8 weeks, a new bone increased to 67.4 ± 6.7% and 62.9 ± 12.5% for the piezoelectric and the drill sites, respectively (p = 0.463). The respective total bone fractions were 70.4 ± 5.5% and 67.8 ± 12.1% (p = 0.753). CONCLUSIONS The use of a piezoelectric device for implant site preparation is a safe procedure that allows a proper integration since the early periods of healing similar to that observed using conventional drills.","Fujiwara, Shigeo; Kato, Shingo; Bengazi, Franco; Urbizo Velez, Joaquin; Tumedei, Margherita; Kotsu, Mitsuo; Botticelli, Daniele",Oral and maxillofacial surgery,202,1

Model systems can help us extract generalities from amid all the wondrous diversity, but only if we choose and develop them carefully, use them wisely, and have a range of model systems from which to choose. In this introduction to the Special Feature on Model Systems in Ecology, Evolution, and Behavior (EEB), we begin by grappling with the question, What is a model system? We then explore where our model systems come from, in terms of the skills and other attributes required to develop them and the historical biases that influence traditional model systems in EEB. We emphasize the importance of communities of scientists in the success of model systems-narrow scientific communities can restrict the model organisms themselves. We also consider how our discipline was built around one type of ""model scientist""-a history still reflected in the field. This lack of diversity in EEB is unjust and also narrows the field's perspective, including by restricting the questions asked and talents used to answer them. Increasing diversity, equity, and inclusion will require acting at many levels, including structural changes. Diversity in EEB, in both model systems and the scientists who use them, strengthens our discipline.","Duffy, Meghan A; García-Robledo, Carlos; Gordon, Swanne P; Grant, Nkrumah A; Green, Delbert A; Kamath, Ambika; Penczykowski, Rachel M; Rebolleda-Gómez, María; Wale, Nina; Zaman, Luis",The American naturalist,202,17

This review describes the pathophysiology of acute pain utilizing three preclinical models: surgery, burn, and fracture. RECENT FINDINGS In general, there is greater interest directed toward peripheral mediators of acute pain. Studies indicate that treatment against nerve growth factor, interleukins, and ischemic-like mediators may provide valuable avenues for treatment of acute pain. By targeting the periphery, analgesic therapies may have reduced side-effects. SUMMARY Peripheral mediators of acute pain can vary depending upon the type of injury. Treatment aimed toward those mediators specific to the injury may improve acute pain management in the future. It will be important to translate these findings into clinical trials in the future.","Xu, Jun; Brennan, Timothy J",Current opinion in anaesthesiology,202,1

METHODS Both meshes were fixed on abdominal fascia of 25 Wistar rats (epifascial onlay placement). They were killed at 7, 28 and 90 days to measure the prostheses. Histological analysis was performed with hematoxylin-eosin for cellular counting and immunohistochemistry to measure collagen types I and III. RESULTS The authors found that the LW-PP mesh presented greater median shrinkage than HW-PP mesh at 7 (P = .036), 28 (P = .674) and 90 days (P = .038) postoperatively. There were more neutrophils on LW-PP mesh (P = .008) at 7 days, gradually diminishing in both prostheses. Lymphocytes were similar between the implants at 7 days, diminishing about 50 % on LW-PP mesh (P < .001) at 90 days. Macrophages and giant cells diminished on LW-PP and increased on HW-PP meshes (P < .001). Collagen I/III ratio presented a progressive, almost fivefold rise at 90 days, on both mesh types (P < .001). The collagen I/III ratio was similar between LW-PP and HW-PP meshes at the three times studied. CONCLUSIONS It is concluded that LW-PP showed more shrinkage than HW-PP mesh at 7 and 90 days, despite the fact that HW-PP presented more lately foreign body reaction. The collagen I/III ratio was similar between the prostheses and increased during the postimplant period.","Zogbi, L; Trindade, E N; Trindade, M R M",Hernia : the journal of hernias and abdominal wall surgery,202,1

Phages from this group conduct a strictly lytic lifestyle and cause substantial losses during milk fermentation processes, by infecting lactococcal host starter strains. Despite their deleterious activity, there are limited research data concerning Ceduovirus phages. To advance our knowledge on this specific phage group, we sequenced and performed a comparative analysis of 10 new Lactococcus lactis Ceduovirus phages isolated from distinct dairy environments. Host range studies allowed us to distinguish the differential patterns of infection of L. lactis cells for each phage, and revealed a broad host spectrum for most of them. We showed that 40% of the studied Ceduovirus phages can infect both cremoris and lactis strains. A preference to lyse strains with the C-type cell wall polysaccharide genotype was observed. Phage whole-genome sequencing revealed an average nucleotide identity above 80%, with distinct regions of divergence mapped to several locations. The comparative approach for analyzing genomic data and the phage lytic spectrum suggested that the amino acid sequence of the orf8-encoded putative tape measure protein correlates with host range. Phylogenetic studies revealed separation of the sequenced phages into two subgroups. Finally, we identified three types of phage origin of replication regions, and showed they are able to support plasmid replication without additional phage proteins.","Chmielewska-Jeznach, Magdalena; Bardowski, Jacek K; Szczepankowska, Agnieszka K",Viruses,202,1

The study was funded by members of the American Petroleum Institute between 2001 and 2009 and was designed to evaluate the human health effects associated with benzene exposure. Two arms of the SHS included: an occupational-based molecular epidemiology study and several hospital-based case control studies. Consistent with historical literature, following sufficient exposure to relatively high airborne concentrations and years of exposure, the SHS concluded that exposure to benzene resulted in an increased risk of various blood and bone marrow abnormalities such as benzene poisoning, aplastic anemia (AA), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) was not significantly increased for the exposures examined in this study. Perhaps the most important contribution of the SHS was furthering our understanding of the mechanism of benzene-induced bone marrow toxicity and the importance of identifying the proper subset of MDS relevant to benzene. Investigators found that benzene-exposed workers exhibited bone marrow morphology consistent with an immune-mediated inflammatory response. Contrary to historic reports, no consistent pattern of cytogenetic abnormalities was identified in these workers. Taken together, findings from SHS provided evidence that the mechanism for benzene-induced bone marrow damage was not initiated by chromosome abnormalities. Instead, chronic inflammation, followed by an immune-mediated response, is likely to play a more significant role in benzene-induced disease initiation and progression than previously thought.","Gross, Sherilyn A; Paustenbach, Dennis J",Critical reviews in toxicology,202,5

SETTING Nine municipalities in Finland which started CRC screening with faecal immunochemical test (FIT) in April 2019 with cut-off levels 70 µg Hg/g faeces for men and 25 µg Hg/g faeces for women. PARTICIPANTS Men (n=13 059) and women (n=14 669) aged 60-66 years invited to screening during the first programme year. OUTCOME MEASURES Participation rates, positivity rates, detection rates of CRC and advanced adenoma (AA), and positive predictive values (PPV) of FIT for CRC and AA. RESULTS Altogether 21 993 invitees returned stool samples. The participation rate of women (83.4%; 95% CI 82.8 to 84.0) was significantly higher than that of men (74.7%; 95% CI 73.9 to 75.4). The positivity rates were 2.4% (2.2 to 2.7) and 2.8% (2.5 to 3.1), respectively. In total, 37 CRCs and 116 AAs were detected. The detection rates of CRC and AA per 1000 participants were 1.8 (1.1 to 2.9) and 7.2 (5.6 to 9.1) for men and 1.6 (0.9 to 2.4) and 3.8 (2.8 to 5.0) for women.

CONCLUSIONS The chosen FIT strategy narrowed the gap in the diagnostic performance between men and women especially in the detection of CRC. The participation rates were excellent. The levels of positivity and detection rates were moderate and need further action. The results indicate that gender-specific protocols can be introduced to organised CRC screening.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS The study included 1263 women with prior GDM and 705 women without GDM. Homeostatic model assessment was used to estimate homeostatic model assessment of β-cell secretory function (HOMA-%β) and homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR). RESULTS Multivariable-adjusted ORs of diabetes across quartiles of HOMA-%β and HOMA-IR were 1.00, 1.46, 2.15, and 6.25 (ptrend <0.001), and 1.00, 2.11, 5.59, and 9.36 (ptrend <0.001), respectively. Women with IR only had the same diabetes risk as women with β-cell dysfunction only. Obesity, together with IR or β-cell dysfunction, had a stronger effect on diabetes risk. This stronger effect was also found for a history of GDM with IR or β-cell dysfunction. Women with three risk factors, including obesity, a history of GDM and β-cell dysfunction/IR, showed the highest ORs of diabetes.

However, so far, functional molecular diodes have only been demonstrated in the very low alternating current frequency regime, which is partially due to their extremely low conductance and the poor degree of device integration. Here, we report about fully integrated rectifiers with microtubular soft-contacts, which are based on a molecularly thin organic heterojunction and are able to convert alternating current with a frequency of up to 10 MHz. The unidirectional current behavior of our devices originates mainly from the intrinsically different surfaces of the bottom planar and top microtubular Au electrodes while the excellent high frequency response benefits from the charge accumulation in the phthalocyanine molecular heterojunction, which not only improves the charge injection but also increases the carrier density.","Li, Tianming; Bandari, Vineeth Kumar; Hantusch, Martin; Xin, Jianhui; Kuhrt, Robert; Ravishankar, Rachappa; Xu, Longqian; Zhang, Jidong; Knupfer, Martin; Zhu, Feng; Yan, Donghang; Schmidt, Oliver G",Nature communications,202,1

As vital regulators of transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels, Noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) are closely related to all the pathophysiological processes involved in infertility in males, especially spermatogenesis. Our study explored the expression levels of circ_0049356 in both the whole blood and seminal plasma samples of idiopathic NOA patients via quantitative real-time PCR. Furthermore, the relative expression of its host gene (CARM1) was also determined using the same methods. In addition, as circRNAs have been demonstrated to regulate gene expression as miRNAs sponge, we predicted a total of five miRNAs and 101 mRNAs as putative downstream targets and constructed a circRNA-miRNA-mRNA network. Based on the predictions, Gene Ontology and KEGG pathway analyses were performed for further bioinformatics analysis to explore the potential function and investigate the circ_0049356-miRNA-mRNA interactions. Our results show target mRNAs that have been predicted to regulate guanyl-nucleotide exchange factor activity to mediate the GTP/GDP exchange, and downstream targets possibly involved in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton, which play a significant role in cytoskeleton rearrangement of germ cells during spermatogenesis.","Liu, Lin; Li, Faminzi; Wen, Zhen; Li, Tao; Lv, Meng; Zhao, Xiaodong; Zhang, Wei; Liu, Jing; Wang, Liyan; Ma, Xiaoling",Andrologia,202,31

Given the nature of the interventions, the potential of an effect extending beyond the original one year of follow-up might be present. This study aims to determine the efficacy of this IPS on LTSA and termination of employment contract over five years by extended follow up of IPS trials. Methods Company records on sickness absence and termination of employment contract over five years were used from two randomized controlled trials (RCT) on the efficacy of the IPS (RCT I employees at high-risk for LTSA: intervention: N=263; RCT II high-risk employees with concurrent mild depressive complaints: intervention: N=139). Survival analysis was used to model time until the first LTSA episode and termination of employment contract. Results RCT I showed a decrease of 43.2 days of sickness absence (P=0.05) and a lower 5-year risk of LTSA in the intervention, as compared to the control group [hazard ratio (HR) 0.61, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.41-0.90], however no considerable impact on employment contract (HR 0.85, 95% CI 0.54-1.35) (intention-to-treat, ITT). For RCT II, we found no large difference in days of SA and no difference in LTSA risk over five years (HR 1.31, 95% CI 0.70-2.47), whereas the risk of termination of the employment contract was lower (HR 0.62, 95% CI 0.39-0.99) (ITT). Conclusion Effects of the IPS were observed over five years, albeit differential between the two approaches. A combination of elements of both interventions might lead to optimal results but needs further study.","Klasen, Sophie H; van Amelsvoort, Ludovic Gpm; Jansen, Nicole Wh; Slangen, Jos Jm; Ton, Gladys Tjin A; Kant, IJmert","Scandinavian journal of work, environment & health",202,1

The impacts on the well-being of local populations have been devastating. We reviewed these extreme weather events, together with the year's newly published climate and health science reports, and identified three important themes for building health resilience in the decade ahead: (1) preparing for greater magnitude and intensity of climate hazards, extreme events, and population health impacts; (2) better anticipating cascading and compound impacts on population well-being, particularly for the most vulnerable; and (3) identifying appropriate, effective preparedness tools and strategies. While decarbonizing the economy is the urgent goal to protect both human and planetary health from a changing climate, 2020 demonstrates that recognizing the likely magnitude and complexity of future extreme weather events, and preparing local public health agencies and communities with the knowledge and tools to respond to them, will be essential in this critical decade.","Sheehan, Mary C","International journal of health services : planning, administration, evaluation",202,5

METHODS In 2019, we recruited participants for an online survey about sexual and reproductive health. Eligible participants were TGE people assigned female or intersex at birth, 18 years and older, from across the United States, and recruited through The PRIDE Study or via online and in-person postings. RESULTS Of 1694 TGE participants, 76 people (36% of those ever pregnant) reported considering trying to end a pregnancy on their own without clinical supervision, and a subset of these (n=40; 19% of those ever pregnant) reported attempting to do so. Methods fell into four broad categories: herbs (n=15, 38%), physical trauma (n=10, 25%), vitamin C (n=8, 20%) and substance use (n=7, 18%). Reasons given for abortion without clinical supervision ranged from perceived efficiency and desire for privacy, to structural issues including a lack of health insurance coverage, legal restrictions, denials of or mistreatment within clinical care, and cost. CONCLUSIONS These data highlight a high proportion of sampled TGE people who have attempted abortion without clinical supervision. This could reflect formidable barriers to facility-based abortion care as well as a strong desire for privacy and autonomy in the abortion process. Efforts are needed to connect TGE people with information on safe and effective methods of self-managed abortion and to dismantle barriers to clinical abortion care so that TGE people may freely choose a safe, effective abortion in either setting.","Moseson, Heidi; Fix, Laura; Gerdts, Caitlin; Ragosta, Sachiko; Hastings, Jen; Stoeffler, Ari; Goldberg, Eli A; Lunn, Mitchell R; Flentje, Annesa; Capriotti, Matthew R; Lubensky, Micah E; Obedin-Maliver, Juno",BMJ sexual & reproductive health,202,23

In related fields, technology acceptance models have been employed to explain users' adoption of technology and to inform the advancement of empirically supported technological resources. AIMS To determine the factors that influence SLTs' use of technology for clinical practice by testing a model of their technology acceptance and use. METHODS & PROCEDURES We surveyed 209 practising SLTs in the United States representative of the speech and language membership of the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association (ASHA). Participants completed a 38-item electronic survey representing four categories: (1) technology use, (2) technology attitudes and factors influencing technology use, (3) employment information and (4) demographics. Items measuring technology attitudes served as indicators of the research model, which mapped the primary relationships of a technology acceptance model. Survey data were collected before the Covid-19 pandemic. OUTCOMES & RESULTS The research model accounted for 66% of the variance in SLTs' behavioural intention to use technology, which significantly and positively predicted the amount of time they reportedly spent using technology in the workplace. Subjective norms and attitudes towards technology use directly predicted the intention to use technology. Perceived usefulness and ease of use indirectly predicted intention to use technology. Survey respondents reported using technology during 48% (SD = 24%) of their overall weekly work hours on average, with a large majority reporting using technology at least once per week for planning (89% of respondents), assessment (66% of respondents) or intervention (90% of respondents). CONCLUSIONS & IMPLICATIONS These findings statistically explain the relationships between SLTs' attitudes and their intention to use technology for clinical practice, contributing to our understanding of why SLTs adopt certain technologies. We also detail the nature and frequency of technology use in the clinical practice of SLTs. Future directions for this work include further exploring use categories, employing direct measurements of technology use and exploring the impact of recent changes in SLT service delivery due to the Covid-19 pandemic on SLTs' technology attitudes. What this paper adds What is already known on the subject Existing research about the adoption and use of technological resources by SLTs indicates that they select tools based on convenience, cost and recommendations by others. What this paper adds to existing knowledge This study is the first to develop and test a research model of SLTs' technology attitudes. The findings from model testing demonstrate the significant predictors of SLTs' behavioural intention to use technology for clinical purposes. Intent of use is related to how much SLTs use technology in the workplace. What are the potential or actual clinical implications of this work? The present findings can inform interventions targeting the design and adoption of electronic SLT resources that are empirically supported.","Albudoor, Nahar; Peña, Elizabeth D",International journal of language & communication disorders,202,1

Use of an intubation checklist can reduce exposure risk and thus acts as a potential safeguard. Specific, step-by-step guidance to perform safe endotracheal intubation in the setting of COVID-19 are limited. This article outlines the development and refinement of a COVID-19 intubation checklist and operational protocol for ICU staff at a single center in the United States. METHODS A standard pre-intubation checklist was adapted and refined by consensus using a multidisciplinary and iterative process, then distributed to local staff for clinical use. Subsequent mock intubation training sessions were held using the new checklist to ensure proficiency. Planned debriefing sessions helped identify several previously unanticipated issues, allowing for further refinement of the intubation checklist and inclusion of all stakeholders. RESULTS A COVID-19 intubation checklist helped optimize safety during a high-risk situation by minimizing aerosolization of secretions, the number of staff required in the room, the time spent in the room, and the frequency of donning/doffing personal protective equipment. CONCLUSIONS We present a checklist for use during high-risk intubations of COVID-19 patients, which serves as a pragmatic bedside tool for clinicians. The process of checklist development may also serve as a model for facilities preparing their own pandemic protocols.","Papali, Alfred; Ingram, Anna O; Rosenberger, Amy M; D'Arcy, Frances R; Singh, Jaspal; Ahlberg, Lisa; Russell, Christopher D",Respiratory care,202,16

Studies have reported that postharvest chemical treatments have a major role in improving the storage life of the fruit. In this study, the efficacy of different concentrations (1, 2, and 3 mM) of salicylic acid (SA), a well-known signaling molecule, was explored to overcome browning and maintain the postharvest quality of the Patharnakh pear during cold storage. RESULTS SA treated pears were better than the untreated fruits in all of the studied parameters. SA application alleviated the rate of weight loss and respiration, and lowered the decay percentage. The efficacy of SA in the reduction of polyphenol oxidase (PPO) activity, which correlates negatively with the total phenolic content, was quite noticeable. The SA treated fruits exhibited a slower oxidation of the total phenol content by inhibiting the action of polyphenol oxidase and retaining the total phenolic content, leading to lower incidence of browning. SA effectively maintained the ascorbic acid content and superoxide dismutase activity. Total soluble solids, titratable acidity, ascorbic acid, and pH of the pears were highest with the SA treatment. CONCLUSION The 2 mM SA treatment exhibited the best result of reducing fruit decay and tissue browning, and maintaining the postharvest quality parameters of pear up to 60 days of cold storage.

This case report describes a non-diabetic patient without any other chronic diseases, who experienced mild hypoglycemia related to HCQ used for COVID-19 treatment. METHODS All etiologies causing hypoglycemia were investigated and a 72-hour fast test was performed. RESULTS A 34-years old male patient was admitted to our hospital with a high fever, cough, and chest pain. The result of his COVID-19 PCR test was positive. He received HCQ for 10 days for the treatment of COVID-19 infection. He experienced fatigue, dizziness, severe headache, weakness and feeling of hunger after discontinuation of HCQ during his isolation at home. Before COVID-19 infection, he never experienced hypoglycemia symptoms. He did not have a history of chronic diseases, drug use, alcohol consumption or smoking. A Seventy two-hour fasting test was performed. He complained about headache and weakness during the 72 hours test period. The PG level was determined as 49 mg/dl during these symptoms. Concurrent insulin and C-peptide levels were <2 mU/mL and 0.553 ng/mL, respectively. ACTH, cortisol, growth hormone, liver and kidney function tests were normal. HbA1c level was 4.7% (28 mmol/mol) (Normal Range %4,5-5,7). CONCLUSION Hypoglycemia may be observed as an adverse effect of HCQ used for COVID-19 infection even in patients without chronic diseases and comorbidities. We must be careful while using HCQ for these patients and must warn them about this effect. The warning about hypoglycemia effect of HCQ must be added to COVID-19 treatment guidelines.","Imanova Yaghji, Narimana; Kan, Elif Kilic; Akcan, Songul; Colak, Ramis; Atmaca, Aysegul",Postgraduate medicine,202,1

In this prospective self-controlled pilot study, we aimed to evaluate the safety, efficiency and user satisfaction outcomes of virtual care (VC) at a military medical centre. METHODS Out of 320 patients seen during the study period, 28 were enrolled in this study and underwent on-premises VC, comprising digital symptoms collection and telemedicine in addition to the usual in-person physician consultation. Safety outcomes were measured based on the diagnostic concordance between physicians. Efficiency was measured based on consultation times, and user satisfaction was evaluated using a standard questionnaire. RESULTS There was a higher caseload of both upper respiratory infections and dermatological conditions in our population, in which telemedicine performed well. In terms of safety, telemedicine achieved a mean diagnostic concordance of 92.8% compared to in-person consultations. In terms of efficiency, consultation times were 26.2% - or 2 minutes and 15 seconds - shorter on average with telemedicine (p = 0.0488). User satisfaction was favourable, with 85.5% of patients satisfied with the VC experience. DISCUSSION This study has been invaluable in showing that on-premises telemedicine is a safe, efficient and effective means to extend and increase our surge capacity for primary health care.

The vigorous development of Internet in China provides an opportunity to observe public reaction and sentiment toward vaccination when Kangtai Hepatitis B vaccine crisis happened and evolved to a widespread debate on the internet from December 12, 2013 to January 3, 2014. METHODS This study conducted Internet surveillance by examining three daily indicators including the daily number of relevant online news article, Sina Weibo posts and Baidu search index during the crisis. We also analyzed the sentiments of relevant original microblog posts collected from Sina Weibo platform in the crisis. RESULTS A total of 17 infant deaths were reported to associated with Hepatitis B vaccination. Three major waves of high media and public attention were detected. The daily indicators reached their peaks in the second wave after the relevant vaccine was suspended by the authority (from December 20 to December 29, 2013) with 23,200 daily online news reports, 34,018 Sina Weibo posts and 17,832 Baidu search indices. There were significant correlations between the daily amount of online news, Weibo posts, and Baidu searches (p<.001). The contents analysis suggested 1343 out of 1608 (83.5%) original Weibo posts expressed negative sentiment with almost 90% in the second wave. CONCLUSION This study found the Kangtai vaccine crisis raised great public attention and negative sentiment toward vaccinations on the internet in China. Policy change such as suspension of the suspected vaccine might trigger even greater reaction and more negative sentiment. The government should provide ways to address emerging public concerns after policy change to avoid misinformation and misunderstanding during such a vaccine crisis.","Chen, Bin; Zhang, Jueman Mandy; Jiang, Zhenggang; Shao, Jian; Jiang, Tao; Wang, Zhengting; Liu, Kui; Tang, Siliang; Gu, Hua; Jiang, Jianmin",Vaccine,202,27

To better understand the core features (elements) that underlie patient engagement, it is useful to have a look at models and frameworks that guide its conduct. Therefore, this manuscript aims to present a protocol for a scoping review of models and frameworks of patient engagement in health services research. Methods: Our protocol design is based on an established framework for conducting scoping reviews. We will identify relevant models and frameworks through systematic searches of electronic databases, websites, reference lists of included articles, and correspondence with colleagues and experts. We will include published and unpublished articles that present models and frameworks of patient engagement in health services research and exclude those not in English or unavailable as full texts. Two reviewers will independently review abstracts and full texts of identified articles for inclusion and extract relevant data; a third reviewer will resolve discrepancies. Our primary objective is to count and describe elements of patient engagement that overlap (present in 2 or more) and diverge among included models and frameworks. Discussion: We hope this review will raise awareness of existing models and frameworks of patient engagement in health services research. Further, by identifying elements that overlap and diverge between models and frameworks, this review will contribute to a clearer understanding of what patient engagement in research is and/or could be. Abstract Background: Patients can bring an expert voice to healthcare research through their lived experience of receiving healthcare services. Patient engagement in research is an emerging approach that challenges researchers to acknowledge and utilize this expertise through meaningful and active collaboration with patients throughout the research process. In order to facilitate a clearer understanding of the core elements that underlie patient engagement, it is useful to examine existing models and frameworks that guide its conduct. Therefore, the aim of this manuscript is to present a protocol for a scoping review of models and frameworks of patient engagement in health services research. Methods: Drawing on Arksey and O'Malley's and Levac et al.'s framework for scoping reviews, we designed our protocol to identify relevant a) published articles through systematic searches of 7 electronic databases and snowball sampling and b) unpublished articles through systematic searches of databases and websites and snowball sampling. We will include published and unpublished models and frameworks of patient engagement in health services research and exclude those not in English or unavailable as full texts. Two reviewers will independently screen the abstracts and full texts of identified articles for inclusion and extract relevant data; a third reviewer will resolve disagreements. We will conduct a descriptive analysis of the characteristics (i.e., elements underlying patient engagement and those related to the study authors, publication, and model/framework) of included articles and a narrative analysis of the data concerning elements of the model or framework. Our primary objective is to count and describe elements of patient engagement that overlap (present in ≥ 2) and diverge (present in < 2) among identified models and frameworks. Discussion: Through identification of elements that overlap and diverge between existing models and frameworks, this review will provide a starting point for the critical reflection on our collective understanding of what patient engagement in health services research is and/or could be. Ultimately, we hope that the findings of this review raise awareness of existing models and frameworks and shed light on some of the complexity of conducting patient engaged research through identification of key elements that shape this approach.","Chudyk, Anna Maria; Waldman, Celeste; Horrill, Tara; Demczuk, Lisa; Shimmin, Carolyn; Stoddard, Roger; Hickes, Serena; Schultz, Annette S H",Research involvement and engagement,202,27

With four all-male community and forensic samples collected in Germany and the United States (nTotal = 853), we evaluated several measurement models of the PCL:SV, including correlated factor models, higher-order models, and bifactor models, on numerous psychometric criteria including model fit, factor saturation, and predictive utility. Across the samples, we found that a bifactor model had better fit to the data and explained comparable or more variance in measures of fluid intelligence, crystallized intelligence, and characteristics of antisocial personality disorder relative to the four correlated factors model. The best bifactor structure model differed between forensic and community samples. With both populations, in addition to a g factor which loaded on all items, a nested factor representing the lifestyle and antisocial facets was also modeled. With the forensic sample, an additional orthogonal nested factor representing the interpersonal facet was needed. We conclude that there is strong communality across the 12 PCL:SV items, which is best captured by a bifactor structure. However, the specific nesting structure differs due to whether or not the sample includes a forensic or community population.

Most of the available data in the literature is derived from Chinese cohorts and we aim to contribute the clinical experience of a single British clinical centre with the characteristics of a British cohort. DESIGN A prospective case series. SETTING A single clinical centre in the UK. METHODS We have collected the demographics and medical characteristics of all COVID-19 positive cases admitted over two-week period. All cases were diagnosed by PCR. RESULTS Total of 71 COVID-19 patients were included in this case series. Majority of patients (75%) were ≥75 years old and 58% were men. Pre-existing comorbidities was common (85% of patients). Most patients presented with respiratory symptoms such as fever (59%), shortness of breath (56%) and cough (55%). Gastrointestinal symptoms were second most common presenting compliant such as diarrhoea (10%) and abdominal pain (7%). Opacification in chest X-rays were demonstrated in 45% of patients. All patients received supportive treatment and no specific antiviral therapy was administered in this cohort. So far, 18 (25%) patients have fully recovered, 9 patients (13%) escalated to a higher level of care and 10 (14%) have died. Patients who died were non-significantly older than those who have recovered (78.0 v 69.2 years, p=0.15) but they had a significantly higher clinical frailty scores (5.75 v 3.36, p=0.005). CONCLUSION This case series demonstrated that the characteristics of British COVID-19 patients were generally similar to what is published in literature although we report more gastrointestinal symptoms at presentation. We have identified frailty as a risk factor for adverse outcome in COVID-19 patients and suggest that it should be included in the future vaccination recommendations.","Conway, J; Gould, A; Westley, R; Raju, S; Oklopcic, A; Broadbent, A; Abdelhafiz, A H",International journal of clinical practice,202,19

This study looked at the impact of an Outpatient-Monitor-Service (OMS) on clinical, economic, patient safety and service improvement outcomes in gynaecology patients compared with care as usual (with no access to the OMS). METHODS We conducted a retrospective match-pair controlled study at a London-based hospital. The cohort included adult women who received either (i) gynecological, (ii) hysteroscopy or (iii) vulval procedures. A cost-consequences analysis compared intervention (who received the OMS) with control (historical cases who did not receive the OMS. Main outcome measures were clinical-effectiveness, NHS-cost, patient safety, and service improvement. RESULTS The intervention had positive impacts spanning clinical, patient safety and service improvement areas and showed cost saving results for the healthcare in terms of reduced follow-up consultations and did-not-attend occurrences.

These findings were attributed to activation of the inflammatory response with the release of cytokines and immune suppression. The aim of this study was to evaluate the association of RBC transfusion on the day of surgery and postoperative outcomes following endovascular aortic repair (EVAR). METHODS A total of 510 patients who underwent EVAR from April 2005 to March 2007 were considered for analysis. The exposure of interest was whether or not patients receive RBC transfusion on the day of surgery. The primary outcome was a composite in-hospital morbidity/mortality outcome. The authors assessed the association between RBC transfusion and our composite outcome using logistic regression after adjusting for the available potential confounders using propensity score matching. RESULTS Propensity scores were estimated for 418 out of the 510 patients; 92 patients were not included because of missing data. Propensity matching resulted in 42 successfully matched pairs. Median (quartiles) propensity score was 0.46 (0.28, 0.66) for the matched patients with transfusion and 0.46 (0.29, 0.61) for the matched patients without transfusion (P = .75, Wilcoxon rank sum test). Results of the multivariable model developed after propensity score matching suggest that RBC transfusion was not significantly associated with experiencing a postoperative complication; estimated odds ratio (95% confidence interval) of 2.7 (0.8, 9.0), P = .11. CONCLUSION In this study, RBC transfusion was not independently associated with an increased incidence of in-hospital morbidity and mortality after EVAR.","Argalious, Maged Y; Dalton, Jarrod E; Mascha, Edward J; Cywinski, Jacek B; Clair, Daniel G",Seminars in cardiothoracic and vascular anesthesia,202,26

To describe patterns and socioeconomic inequalities in complementary feeding practices among children aged 6-23 months in 80 low and middle-income countries (LMICs). Methods. We analyzed national surveys carried out since 2010. Complementary feeding indicators for children aged 6-23 months included minimum dietary diversity (MDD), minimum meal frequency (MMF) and minimum acceptable diet (MAD). Between- and within-country inequalities were documented using relative (wealth deciles) and absolute (estimated household income) socioeconomic indicators. Results. Only 21.3%, 56.2% and 10.1% of the 80 countries showed prevalence levels above 50% for MDD, MMF and MAD, respectively. Western & Central Africa showed the lowest prevalence for all indicators, whereas the highest for MDD and MAD was Latin America & Caribbean, and for MMF in East Asia & the Pacific. Log per capita gross domestic product was positively associated with MDD (R2 = 48.5%), MMF (28.2%) and MAD (41.4%). Pro-rich within-country inequalities were observed in most countries for the three indicators; pro-poor inequalities were observed in two countries for MMF, and in none for the other two indicators. Breastmilk was the only type of food with a pro-poor distribution, whereas animal-source foods (dairy products, flesh foods and eggs) showed the most pronounced pro-rich inequality. Dietary diversity improved sharply when absolute annual household incomes exceeded about US$20,000. There were no consistent differences among boys and girls for any of the indicators studied. Conclusion. Monitoring complementary feeding indicators in the world and implementing policies and programs to reduce wealth related inequalities are essential to achieve optimal child nutrition.","Gatica Dominguez, G.; Neves, P.

Assessing LD in thousands of genomes and/or millions of single-nucleotide poly-morphisms (SNPs) exhibits excessive time and memory requirements that can potentially hinder future large-scale genomic analyses. To this end, we introduce qLD (quickLD) (https://github.com/StrayLamb2/qLD), a highly optimized open-source software that assesses LD based on Pearson's correlation coefficient. qLD exploits the fact that the computational kernel for calculating LD can be cast in terms of dense linear algebra operations. In addition, the software employs memory-aware techniques to lower memory requirements, and parallel GPU architectures to further shorten analysis times. qLD delivers up to 5x faster processing than the current state-of-the-art software implementation when run on the same CPU, and up to 29x when computation is offloaded to a GPU. Furthermore, the software is designed to quantify allele associations between arbitrarily distant loci in a time- and memory-efficient way, thereby facilitating the evaluation of long-range LD and the detection of co-evolved genes. We showcase qLD on the analysis of 22,554 complete SARS-CoV-2 genomes.","Theodoris, C.; Alachiotis, N.; Low, T.

Object: In this study, we surveyed university students with disabilities and specific learning disabilities (SLDs) on their perceptions of and satisfaction with emergency remote teaching (ERT) during the lockdown phase (March–April 2020) and following restrictions due to the COVID-19 pandemic. We compared the responses of students with disabilities and SLDs with those of normotypical students. Methodology: A questionnaire was completed remotely: five items on the ERT were designed as ad hoc questions and five items were taken from the Short Form 12 Health Survey (SF-12) to evaluate physical and mental self-perceived health. There was a total of 163 students surveyed, 67 students with disabilities and/or SLDs and 96 normotypical students. Results and Conclusion: Students with disabilities and SLDs were more satisfied with remote teaching than the normotypical students. In fact, only 22% of the students with disabilities or SLDs indicated that they were dissatisfied with the teaching method used due to difficulties encountered, including those related to a weak technological infrastructure.

AIM: This study aimed to examine the association between eHealth literacy and self-care behavior among youths in Yogyakarta during the coronavirus disease pandemic. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, 455 never-married youths aged 15–24 years who lived in Yogyakarta Province completed the online survey that was conducted from October 5 to October 19, 2020. There were some indicators measured in the survey: eHealth Literacy, health information-seeking behavior, the intention of health maintenance, self-maintenance of health behavior, perceived behavioral control, subjective norms, and attitude toward health maintenance. Path analysis was conducted to determine the influencing factors of eHealth literacy and self-care behavior. RESULTS: Five in 10 youths accessed the internet more than 4 hours a day, though more than half of youths had low eHealth literacy levels. Intention (β = 0.09;95% CI = 0.01–0.18;p = 0.037), perceived behavioral control (β = 0.46;95% CI = 0.38–0.54;p ≤ 0.001), and subjective norms (β = 0.24;95% CI = 0.16–0.33;p ≤ 0.001) had a significant positive direct effect on youth self-care behavior. Attitude indirectly affects self-care behavior through the intention (β = 0.46;95% CI = 0.39–0.53;p ≤ 0.001) together with eHealth literacy (β = 0.11;95% CI= 0.04–0.18;p = 0.001). CONCLUSION: Health literacy does not explicitly affect youths’ self-care behavior, but it becomes crucial when it builds youths’ intention to behave healthier. The positive impact of intention to enhance self-health care seems to have occurred only if eHealth literacy was adopted.","Nugroho, D. C. A.; Sulistiawan, D.; Arifa, R.

This virus can cause severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). In this study, we reviewed proteases of SARS-CoV-2 based on related articles published in journals indexed by Scopus, PubMed, and Google Scholar from December 2019 to April 2020. Based on this study, it is concluded that this coronavirus has about 76% genotype similarity to SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Also, similarities between these two viruses have been found in the mechanism of entry into host cells and pathogenicity. ACE 2, the angiotensin convertase enzyme 2, has roles in the Renin- Angiotensin-Aldosterone system (RAAS) and blood pressure regulation. Some mechanisms have been reported for the role of ACE 2 in the pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2. For example, the interaction between the ACE 2 receptor and spike protein mediated by TMPRSS2, Cathepsin B/L, and other enzymes is responsible for the entry of the virus into human cells and pathogenicity. Some host cell endosomal enzymes are necessary to cleavage coronavirus spike protein and cause binding to their common receptor. So, we conclude that molecules like antibodies or small molecules as ACE2 antagonists and soluble ACE 2 can be used as a good therapeutic candidate to prevent SARS-CoV-2. © Fateme Tavakoli Far1, Ehsan Amiri-Ardekani, 2021.","Far, F.

These instruments find use in ground-based efforts to characterize stellar and exoplanet atmospheres, and in space-based observatories. Our grating fabrication technique uses x-ray crystallography to orient silicon parts prior to cutting, followed by lithography and wet chemical etching to produce the blaze. This process takes advantage of the crystal structure and relative difference in etching rates between the (100) and (111) planes such that we can produce parts that have surface errors<{\lambda}/4. Previous measurements indicate that chemical etching can yield a final etched blaze that slightly differs from the orientation of the (111) plane. This difference can be corrected by the mechanical mount in the case of the immersion gratings, but doing so may compromise grating throughput due to shadowing. In the case of the grisms, failure to take the actual blaze into account will reduce the brightness of the undeviated ray. We report on multiple techniques to precisely measure the blaze of our in-house fabricated immersion gratings. The first method uses a scanning electron microscope to image the blaze profile, which yields a measurement precision of 0.5 degrees. The second method is an optical method of measuring the angle between blaze faces using a rotation stage, which yields a measurement precision of 0.2 degrees. Finally, we describe a theoretical blaze function modeling method, which we expect to yield a measurement precision of 0.1 degrees. With these methods, we can quantify the accuracy with which the wet etching produces the required blaze and further optimize grating and grism efficiencies.","Lubar, Emily; Jaffe, Daniel T.; Brooks, Cynthia; Hickman, Sierra; Gully-Santiago, Michael; Mace, Gregory",,202,25

To transfer the engineering knowledge and problem solving skills, hardware equipment and components are used in the laboratories. Similarly, software simulators are also used due to the budget and space constraints. In this context, a separate simulator is required for each kind of laboratory experiment which not only increases the cost but also requires long learning time. Therefore, there a need for a platform that can be used in both situations, i.e., real and virtual environments. A real environment implies that the experiments are performed physically inside the laboratory. On the other hand, a virtual environment advocates the use of the proposed platform remotely. Consequently, a LabVIEW and Multisim based experimental setup is proposed in this paper that is useful in various types of engineering laboratory experiments. The proposed platform allows to perform algorithmic level exploration as well as component level implementation. For algorithmic level exploration, a LabVIEW programming environment is employed while the circuit level implementation is supported with a Multisim.

Methods: We performed a quality improvement project with the plan-do-study-act framework to assess and improve participants’ knowledge of the cost of single-use endoscopy devices. We assessed baseline knowledge of the cost of 20 different devices with a questionnaire. We then utilized two interventions, an active intervention at one site and a passive intervention at 2 sites. At the active intervention site, endoscopy nurses called out the cost of each single-use endoscopy device used in each case, while at the passive sites we displayed posters that listed the name, cost, and image of each devices.

We performed random effects Poisson regression for pairwise comparisons of accuracy with 15% and 30% error thresholds. Results: There were 38 participants at baseline and 19 (50%) completed the follow-up questionnaire and were included for analysis. The COVID pandemic did delay the intervention phase resulting in loss of some study participants due to relocation. Participants were within 15% of the actual device cost for a mean 2.4 devices out of 20 at baseline and a mean 4.6 devices at follow-up (p = 0.01).

We evaluated clinician experiences of telemedicine to determine its potential use post-Covid-19. Methods From 16th March 2020 all HF appointments at a specialist centre were telemedicine by default, with in-person appointments only in exceptional circumstances. HF clinicians were invited to participate in semi-structured interviews about their experiences of telemedicine consultations. Interviews were conducted using Microsoft Teams, recorded and transcribed verbatim. Each interview lasted approximately 30 minutes. Narrative data were explored by thematic analysis: the iterative coding and comparison of transcripts to identify themes. Analysis was performed until themes saturated. Results Between 16th March 2020 and 15th March 2021, there were 2725 HF clinic appointments, 98.9% of which were by telemedicine. 8 clinicians were interviewed: 4 HF consultants, 3 HF specialist nurses and one training-grade doctor. Four key themes emerged (figure 1): Time management - telemedicine consultations were perceived to be more efficient, owing to more focused assessments, less time between appointments and ability to multitask, but more administrative and preparation time was required. Clinicians felt less guilty keeping consultations brief, as patients had not travelled for their appointment.Information gathering - without physical examination clinicians relied more on objective data such as test results. Video was perceived as superior to telephone for assessing patients. Examination of oedema was possible by video, but more difficult and perceived to be less reliable.Rapport and relationships - telemedicine changed the patient-clinician interaction. Clinicians experienced difficulty establishing rapport with new patients by telephone;video was better than telephone, but clinicians felt that new patients were generally best assessed in-person to establish a 'connection' and relationship of trust. Choice and flexibility - clinicians expressed a fear of 'topdown' diktats on future delivery of care. This was exemplified by the quote '?the health service has got a great tradition of making up its mind as to what the patient thinks'. Clinicians felt telemedicine consultations would continue to play a major role, as they were considered more convenient for patients, but patient choice was essential. Figure 2 shows a word cloud generated from interview transcripts. Conclusions Telemedicine HF consultations were acceptable for clinicians, but changed workflows, consultation dynamics, and how clinicians developed rapport and trust. Understanding these changes is essential for future delivery of care. We will now seek to understand the views of patients and their families.","Singhal, A.; Riley, J.; Cowie, M.",Heart,202,25

The current COVID-19 pandemic has provided a catalyst for rapid adoption of telehealth. A regional cancer center has established a novel rural health partnership program that utilizes a hybrid model of on-site visits and telehealth to increase access to advanced oncology care for patients in rural communities. Here we describe the collaboration and benefits of this model. Methods: The rural health hybrid delivery model utilizes a combination of in-person and telehealth visits to provide immediate access to the regional center's oncology care team and specialized services such as advanced surgeries, radiation, precision medicine, and clinical trials. Speed to care was built into the model as a key feature, offering initial appointments within 3 business days from the time of the referral, wherein treatment plans are developed facilitating immediate start. The model is a collaborative partnership, ensuring a coordinated care process driven by the regional oncologists working in coordination with the local provider to meet the needs of the patient. The patient is able to decrease transportation time, cost, and obtain care closer to their support system by keeping the patient in their community for basic needs. For more complex requirements, on-site visits are coordinated. This allows access to the regional center's specialty oncology care services not available locally, while keeping the patient engaged with their local provider, which increases service utilization and expands the patient base. Leveraging telehealth visits at the local hospital ensures access to adequate broadband and technology capabilities to facilitate continuity of patient care. Results: This model provides the patient with timely access to specialty cancer care in their local community. Partnerships with two rural health systems were implemented in July and November 2020. 14 patients are enrolled in the program to date with a 100% retention rate. The turnaround time from treatment plan to treatment is 6 business days. There was a total of 62 oncology telehealth appointments, reducing patient travel by 12,705 driving miles, 310 travel hours, saving $7,380 in travel costs and accommodation. Conclusions: Telehealth provides a bridge to the rural health access gap, and advances health equity by offering specialized care to patients in their local communities. Improving access to best practice treatment strategies for all cancer patients moves us closer to resolving disparities in outcomes. Applications of this hybrid model of care to other rural sites is a promising strategy to reduce rural-urban disparities in cancer care.","Rariy, C.; Truesdale, L.; Ahn, E. R.; Gershenhorn, B.

More than 83 million people have been infected, and more than 1.8 million people have died, as reported to the World Health Organization on the 3rd of January, 2021. Analysis of genetic variations is critical for understanding the spreading pattern of SARS-CoV-2 across several countries. This review aimed to gather information about the prominent mutations of SARS-CoV-2 by analyzing the origin, viral pathogenesis, and mutation rate. Moreover, we concluded their potential impacts on SARS-CoV-2 therapeutics. Mutations in the spike protein (D614G, N501Y, E484K, A222V, S477N, and G485R), ORF1ab (P323L, N628N, Y455Y, A97V, and F106F), nucleocapsid protein (R203K and G204R), ORF8 (L84S), and ORF3a (Q57H and G251V) were examined in this review by analyzing relevant articles from the beginning of the current pandemic to the most recent date. A detailed analysis of articles demonstrates that D614G is the major variation distributed globally, and its frequency increased rapidly from early in March, followed by several other variations in either spike or different proteins. In addition, it was seen that the currently circulating N501Y and E484K variants revealed a public concern regarding vaccines' efficacy. Investigation of variations of SARS-CoV-2 would lead to understanding their potential mechanism of action against SARS-CoV-2, thereby suggesting suitable therapeutics. Several mechanisms were suggested to have a role in SARS-CoV-2 mutation rate and evolution. Possible therapeutics and vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 were proposed.","Uuml,; nlü, S.; sküdar-Güçlü, A.; Başustaoǧlu, A.","Mediterranean Journal of Infection, Microbes and Antimicrobials",202,10

These matrices are highly relevant for informing prevention and control of new outbreaks, and evaluating strategies that reduce the amount of mixing in the population (such as school closures, social distancing, or working from home). In addition, they finally provide the possibility to use multiple sources of social mixing data to evaluate the uncertainty that stems from social mixing when designing public health interventions.","Klepac, Petra; Kucharski, Adam J; Conlan, Andrew JK; Kissler, Stephen; Tang, Maria; Fry, Hannah; Gog, Julia R",,202,24

First, it argues that the relationship between reproductive rights and the rule of law in Poland came clearly into view through the abortion judgment K 1/20, handed down by the Constitutional Tribunal in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic. The judgment and the context in which it was issued and published are interpreted as reflections of deep-lying processes and problems in Polish society.

One of the major remittance sources for Bangladesh is its migrant workers who are required to receive mRNA vaccines to return to their jobs. Despite reports of higher efficacy of mRNA vaccine against COVID-19, breakthrough infection cases are arising especially with the emergence of Delta variant. It is highly important to understand the post-vaccination immune response and breakthrough infections in different populations so that the necessity of booster dosage can be assessed properly. Methods We observed post BNT162b2 full vaccination immune response in a small older group (mean age= 59.5+-5.44 years) of migrant workers (n=10) for six months at the Sheikh Hasina National Institute of Burn and Plastic Surgery, Dhaka, Bangladesh. The plasma samples from the participants were collected after 14 days, 2 months, 3 months, 4 months, 5 months, and 6 months of receiving the 2nd dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine. Anti S1 RBD IgG responses were measured as optical density ratios using a commercially available ELISA kit. Results All 10 of the participants were male migrant workers and none of them had a history of previous COVID-19 infection. The median antibody response [IQ1:IQ3] was 9.05 [7.53; 10.0] on day 14 then it increases to 13.6 [12.0; 14.0] at the second month which gradually decreased to a median of 8.63 [8.34; 9.37] on the 6th-month post-vaccination. There were two breakthrough infection cases after receiving the second dose and the antibody responses were highly increased in the following months. Two of the breakthrough cases were diagnosed with mild COVID-19 as the symptom duration was less than 3 days with no respiratory complications and no hospital admission were required. Conclusions The BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine produces a strong immune response that sustains at least 6 months after getting fully vaccinated. But even after getting fully vaccinated people are susceptible to breakthrough infections that are not severe and boost the immune response greatly offering a hybrid immunity from both vaccine and natural infection. Hence, it is still important to fully vaccinate a greater number of people rather than thinking of offering booster dosage to the privileged populations out of the fear of breakthrough cases. If the LMICs can quickly cover at least 80% of their population with usual priority targets (healthcare workers, migrant workers, older people, etc.) then a global risk reduction and pandemic control would be possible that will allow additional variant-specific boosters for targeted populations if evidence support.","Hoque, A.; Rahman, M.

The findings indicate that over the full and before the pandemic periods, oil returns cause the renewable stock index returns during normal market conditions, but this is not the case in the extreme market conditions. Moreover, all the five renewable energy sectoral stock returns have no predictive power of oil returns under any market conditions. On the other hand, the volatility analysis suggests a significant bidirectional causality between the oil price volatility and the renewable energy stock volatility only at the lower quantiles during the same periods. During the COVID-19 pandemic period, the findings suggest the absence of significant causal relationships between the oil price (returns and volatility) and the renewable energy stocks.

We have previously described the construction and characterization of generic and reusable blood transcriptional module repertoires. The third and latest version that we have recently made available comprises 382 functionally annotated gene sets (modules) and encompasses 14,168 transcripts. We developed R scripts for performing module repertoire analyses and custom fingerprint visualization. These are made available here along with detailed descriptions. An illustrative public transcriptome dataset and corresponding intermediate output files are also included as supplementary material. Briefly, the steps involved in module repertoire analysis and visualization include: First, the annotation of the gene expression data matrix with module membership information. Second, running of statistical tests to determine for each module the proportion of its constitutive genes which are differentially expressed. Third, the results are expressed “at the module level” as percent of genes increased or decreased and plotted in a fingerprint grid format. A parallel workflow has been developed for computing module repertoire changes for individual samples rather than groups of samples. Such results are plotted in a heatmap format. The use case that is presented illustrates the steps involved in the generation of blood transcriptome repertoire fingerprints of septic patients at both group and individual levels.","Rinchai, Darawan; Roelands, Jessica; Hendrickx, Wouter; Altman, Matthew C.; Bedognetti, Davide; Chaussabel, Damien",bioRxiv,202,22

Although they have robust anti-inflammatory properties, their success has been variable in clinical trials due to an unclear understanding of their mechanism. Once injected, a majority of MSCs traffic to the lung, where they are rapidly cleared, signifying an opportunity to target lung inflammatory [Figure presented] conditions such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). ARDS is a catastrophic condition of the lungs, involving pulmonary inflammation that develops with severe SARS-CoV2 and other respiratory infections. MSCs are expected to prevent alveolar damage by suppressing the immune response and there is evidence that MSCs protect in phase I/IIa trials for ARDS associated with COVID-19. While these results are promising, understanding the mechanism is critical to determine dosing, maximize efficacy, and ultimately lead to an approved product. Methods, Results & Conclusion: We and others have demonstrated that within their short time in the lung, MSCs interact with monocytes and macrophages. Through direct cell contact, MSCs transfer cytoplasmic components, notably cytoplasmic processing-bodies (p-bodies) to monocytes and macrophages. P-bodies are membrane-less organelles that contain RNA binding proteins, microRNAs, and mRNAs enriched for genes that regulate the transcriptional landscape of cells. MSC interactions result in long-term transcriptional reprogramming of monocytes and macrophages to suppress a helper T cell response and upregulate tissue repair pathways. To investigate the mechanisms of MSCs in vivo, we utilized 2 mouse models of lung inflammation: 1. intranasal lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to study general acute inflammation and 2. an engineered vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) with a SARS-CoV2 Spike protein. Using these models, we demonstrated that during inflammation cytoplasm of MSCs transferred to lung macrophages to decrease activation and the expression of MHC-II. Further, MSCs prevented a decrease in resident alveolar macrophages, suppressed proinflammatory macrophages, and blocked an influx in infiltrating monocytes (Fig 1). Depleting p-bodies from MSCs abolished the beneficial effects, despite transfer cytoplasmic component to macrophages at similar levels of control MSCs. Overall, our data suggest a novel form of cell communication that could explain how MSCs could lead to long-term beneficial effects on lung inflammation despite being rapidly cleared.

When a cue later occurs without punishment, this unexpected withdrawal of aversive outcome is encoded as reward, via activation of reward-encoding dopaminergic neurons. Using real-time in vivo functional imaging, optogenetics, behavioral analysis, and electron-microscopy, we identify the neural mechanism through which Drosophila reward-encoding dopaminergic neurons are activated when an olfactory cue is unexpectedly no longer paired with electric shock punishment. Reduced activation of punishment-encoding dopaminergic neurons relieves depression of synaptic inputs to cholinergic neurons, which in turn synaptically increase odor responses of reward-encoding dopaminergic neurons to decrease odor avoidance. These studies reveal for the first time how an indirect excitatory cholinergic synaptic relay from punishment- to reward-encoding dopaminergic neurons encodes the absence of a negative as a positive, revealing a general circuit motif for unlearning aversive memories that could be present in mammals.","McCurdy, Li Yan; Sareen, Preeti; Davoudian, Pasha A.; Nitabach, Michael N.",bioRxiv,202,1

Clinical Quality Assurance (QA) practices used to detect underreporting rely on on-site audits, however adverse events underreporting remains a recurrent issue. In a recent project, we developed a predictive model that enables oversight of Adverse Event (AE) reporting for clinical Quality Program Leads (QPL). However, there were limitations to using solely a machine learning model. Objective Our primary objective was to propose a robust method to compute the probability of AE underreporting that could complement our machine learning model. Our model was developed to enhance patients safety while reducing the need for on-site and manual QA activities in clinical trials. Methods We used a Bayesian hierarchical model to estimate the site reporting rates and assess the risk of underreporting. We designed the model with Project Data Sphere clinical trial data that is public and anonymized. Outcome With the resulting reporting rates and metrics, we could focus quality assurance strategic activities for clinical trials on the investigator sites with the highest risk of underreporting. Conclusion The new model will be integrated into the current dashboard designed for clinical Quality Program Leads. This approach reduces the need for on-site audits, shifting focus from source data verification (SDV) to pre-identified, higher risk areas. It will enhance further quality assurance activities for safety reporting from clinical trials and generate quality evidence during pre-approval inspections.","Barmaz, Y.; Menard, T.",,202,4

The framework introduced and the method proposed in this paper are on the basis of the theory of rational choice at a societal level, which assumes that the government is a rational, benevolent agent that systematically and purposefully takes into account the social marginal costs and social marginal benefits of its actions to its citizens and makes decisions that maximize the society's well-being as a whole.

For the Cas12a/Cas13a-based signal detection phase, we determine buffer conditions and substrate range for optimal detection performance. By comparing several chemical additives, we find that addition of L-proline can secure or enhance Cas12a/Cas13a detection capability. For isothermal amplification phase with typical LAMP and RPA methods, inclusion of L-proline can also enhance specific target amplification as determined by CRISPR detection. Using SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus, we demonstrate CECRID has enhanced detection sensitivity over chemical additive-null method with either fluorescence or lateral flow strip readout.

By means of statistical analysis, the data were analysed and a GIS environment was used to visualise data distributions. Our findings indicate that if the perceived risk associated to the epidemic is high, people will change their normal behaviours, adopt preventative measures, adhere to strict hygiene practices and are willing to self-isolate for the benefit of their peers, which they tend to see as running a greater risk than themselves. Women and people with higher educational status tend to be more worried about the current situation, but regarding the severity, almost all men believe they would risk a severe state if infected.

The limitation of current contact tracing systems in that a reception of a single beacon is sufficient to reveal the user identity, potentially exposing users to malicious trackers installed along the roads, passageways, and other infrastructure. In this paper, we propose a method based on Shamir secret sharing algorithm, which lets mobile nodes reveal their identity only after a certain predefined contact duration, remaining invisible to trackers with short or fleeting encounters. Through data-driven evaluation, using a dataset containing 18 million BLE sightings, we show that the method drastically reduces the privacy exposure of users.

However, a comprehensive assessment of the current state of financial regulation reveals that this shift is incomplete. In particular, the notion of risk that lies at the heart of the Basel framework is still blind to extreme events. Climate risk and pandemic risk fall into this category. The purpose of this article is twofold. On the one hand, we point out why current banking regulation is not adequate to face risks whose origin is grounded outside financial markets – as is the case for both the pandemic and the climate risks –;on the other hand, we offer avenues for reforming macroprudential regulation in a way that would allow to take those risks into account. © 2021 CEPII (Centre d'Etudes Prospectives et d'Informations Internationales), a center for research and expertise on the world economy","Le Quang, G.; Scialom, L.",International Economics,202,1

We show negative market reactions to the crisis across all firms, which is consistent with investors expecting COVID-19 to negatively impact firms' future prospects. Using tax-paying credit rating as a proxy for tax integrity, we find that the negative reaction to the COVID-19 crisis is significantly less for firms with high tax integrity, consistent with investors expecting tax integrity to benefit firms during the crisis. In contrast, we find no difference in the negative market reactions to the 2003 SARS outbreak for the same set of firms. As there was no tax credit rating disclosure in 2003, this serves as a control for the treatment effect. Overall, our results suggest that investors expect corporate tax integrity to mitigate the negative effect of exogenous crises such as COVID-19 on firms.","Wang, P.; Xie, L.

Innate and adaptive immune response are controlled by coordinated activity of multiple immune cell types. The functional activity state of immune cells is determined by cellular signal transduction pathways (STPs). A novel mRNA-based signaling pathway assay platform has been developed to quantitatively measure relevant STP activities in all types of immune cells and mixed immune cell samples for experimental and diagnostic purposes. We generated a STP activity profile, termed Immune-Pathway Activity Profile (I-PAP), for a variety of immune cell types in resting and activated state, and provide a first example for use in patient samples. Methods The technology to measure STP activity has been described for androgen and estrogen receptor, PI3K, MAPK, TGFβ, Notch, NFκB, JAK-STAT1/2, and JAK-STAT3 pathways. STP activity was measured on Affymetrix expression microarray data from preclinical studies containing public data from different types of immune cells, resting/naïve or immune-activated in vitro, to establish I-PAPs. Subsequently data from a clinical study on rheumatoid arthritis were analyzed. Results I-PAPs of naïve/resting and immune-activated CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, T helper cells, B cells, NK cells, monocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells were established and in agreement with known experimental immunobiology. In whole blood samples of rheumatoid arthritis patients TGFβ pathway activity was increased; JAK-STAT3 pathway activity was selectively increased in female patients. In naïve CD4+ Tregs TGFβ pathway activity was increased, while in memory T effector cells JAK-STAT3 pathway activity tended to increase, suggesting that these immune cell types contributed to whole blood analysis results. Conclusion STP assay technology (currently being converted to qPCR-based assays) makes it possible to directly measure functional activity of cells of the innate and adaptive immune response enabling quantitative assessment of the immune response of an individual patient. Envisioned utility lies in (1) prediction and monitoring of response to immunomodulatory treatments for a variety of immune-mediated diseases, including RA; (2) uncovering novel treatment targets; (3) improvement and standardization of in vitro immunology research and drug development.","Bouwman, Wilbert; Verhaegh, Wim; van Doorn, Arie; van de Stolpe, Anja",bioRxiv,202,26

However, the response of tubular epithelial cells to serum protein exposure has not been systematically characterized. Using transcriptomic profiling we studied serum-induced changes in primary human tubular epithelial cells cultured in 3D microphysiological devices. Serum proteins induced cellular proliferation, cytokine secretion and activated a coordinated stress response. We orthogonally confirmed our findings by comparing the transcriptomic and epigenomic landscapes of intact human kidney cortex and isolated tubular epithelial cells cultured in fetal bovine serum. Importantly, key transcriptomic programs in response to either type of serum exposure remained consistent, including comparisons to an established mouse model of kidney injury. This serum-induced transcriptional response was dominated by switching off of nuclear receptor-driven programs and activation of AP-1 and NF-κB signatures in the tubular epigenomic landscape. These features of active regulation were seen at canonical kidney injury genes (HAVCR1) and genes associated with COVID-19 (ACE2, IL6).

Herein, a near-infrared (NIR) light-triggerable thermo-sensitive defective molybdenum oxide-nitrogen doped carbon (MoO3-x/NCNs) composite was fabricated and applied to water disinfection. With the synergy of photodynamic and photothermal effects, the MoO3-x/NCNs achieve a rapid and effective inactivation of Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) as compared to photocatalytic treatment or thermal catalytic alone. Particularly, MONC-3 with optimal ratio can completely inactivate 7.6 log of E. coli and S. aureus within 60 min and 100 min, respectively. The MONC-3 hybrid exhibits efficient charge separation and migration ability due to the formation of Schottky heterojunction, resulting in the highly enhanced ·O2– (11.34×10-10 M) generation activity. Meanwhile, excellent NIR light absorption and photothermal conversion efficiency (52.6%) of MONC-3 can generate local high temperature to promote photocatalytic reaction rate and destruct the bacterial integrity.

Cardiovascular evidence for older second-line agents, such as sulfonylureas, and direct head-to-head comparisons, including with dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) inhibitors, are lacking, leaving a critical gap in our understanding of the relative effects of T2DM agents on cardiovascular risk and on patient-centered safety outcomes. Methods and Analysis: The Large-Scale Evidence Generations Across a Network of Databases for T2DM (LEGEND-T2DM) initiative is a series of systematic, large-scale, multinational, real-world comparative cardiovascular effectiveness and safety studies of all 4 major second-line anti-hyperglycemic agents including SGLT2 inhibitor, GLP1 receptor agonist, DPP4 inhibitor and sulfonylureas. LEGEND-T2DM will leverage the Observational Health Data Science and Informatics (OHDSI) community that provides access to a global network of administrative claims and electronic health record (EHR) data sources. Committed data partners represent 190 million patients in the US and about 50 million internationally. LEGEND-T2DM will identify all adult, T2DM patients who newly initiate a traditionally second-line T2DM agent, including individuals with and without established cardiovascular disease. Using an active comparator, new-user cohort design, LEGEND-T2DM will execute all pairwise class-vs-class and drug-vs-drug comparisons in each data source that meet a minimum patient count of 1,000 per arm and extensive study diagnostics that assess reliability and generalizability through cohort balance and equipoise to examine the relative risk of cardiovascular and safety outcomes. The primary cardiovascular outcomes include a 3-point and a 4-point composite of major adverse cardiovascular events, and series of safety outcomes. The study will pursue data-driven, large-scale propensity adjustment for measured confounding, a large set of negative control outcome experiments to address unmeasured and systematic bias. Ethics and Dissemination: The study ensures data safety through a federated analytic approach and follows research best practices, including prespecification and full disclosure of hypotheses tested and their results. LEGEND-T2DM is dedicated to open science and transparency and will publicly share all our analytic code from reproducible cohort definitions through turn-key software, enabling other research groups to leverage our methods, data, and results in order to verify and extend our findings.","Khera, R.; Schuemie, M.

The ""quietness"" on land and ocean that followed presents an opportunity to measure an unprecedented reduction in human-related seismic activities and study its effect on the short-period range of ambient noise cross-correlation functions (NCFs). We document the variations in seismic power levels and signal quality of short-period NCFs measured by four seismographs located near Canadian cities across the pandemic-defined timeline. Significant drops in seismic power levels are observed at all the locations around mid-March. These drops coincide with lockdown announcements by the various Canadian provinces where the stations are located. Mean seismic power reductions of 24% and 17% are observed near Montreal and Ottawa, respectively, in eastern Canada. Similar reductions of 27% and 17% are recorded in western Canada near Victoria and Sidney, respectively. None of the locations show full recovery in seismic power back to the pre-lockdown levels by the end of June, when the provinces moved into gradual reopening. The overall levels of seismic noise during lockdown are a factor of 5-10 lower at our study locations in western Canada, relative to the east. Signal quality of NCF measured in the secondary microseism frequency band for the station pair in western Canada is maximum before lockdown (late February-early March), minimum during lockdown (mid- late March), and increased to intermediate levels in the reopening phase (late May). A similar pattern is observed for the signal quality of the eastern Canada station pair, except for a jump in levels at similar periods during the lockdown phase. The signal quality of NCF within the secondary microseism band is further shown to be the lowest for the western Canada station pair during the 2020 lockdown phase, when compared with similar time windows in 2018 and 2019.","Kuponiyi, A.

However, attempts to integrate take-home simulation into surgical training have met with inconsistent engagement, as reported in our 2014-15 study of an Incentivised Laparoscopy Practice (ILP) programme. Our subsequent multi-centre study examined barriers and facilitators, informing revisions of the programme for 2018-20. We now report engagement with the revised versions. METHODS In ILP v2.1 and 2.2, two consecutive year-groups of new CSTs (n= 48 and 46) were loaned portable simulators. The 6-month programme included induction, technical support, and intermittent feedback. Six tasks were prescribed, with video instruction and charting of metric scores. Video uploads were required and scored by faculty. A pass resulted in an eCertificate, expected at Annual Review. ILP was set within a wider reform, 'Improving Surgical Training'. RESULTS ILP v2.1 and 2.2 saw pass rates of 94% and 76% (45/48 and 35/46 trainees respectively), compared with only 26% (7/27) in v1, despite the v2.1 and v2.2 groups having less electronic gaming experience. In the ILP v2.2 group, 73% reported their engagement was adversely affected by COVID19 redeployments. CONCLUSIONS Simply providing kit, no matter how good, is not enough. To achieve trainee engagement with take-home simulators, as in ILP v2, a whole programme is required, with motivated learning, individual and group practice, intermittent feedback, and clear goals and assessments. ILP is a complex intervention, best understood as a 'reform within a reform, within a context.' This may explain why trainee engagement fell away during early pandemic conditions.","Walker, K.

Inspired by the thought of granular computing, this article proposes a new hesitant fuzzy linguistic method to deal with issues when a lot of decision makers provide hesitant and uncertain preference information in the decision-making process. First, we design a multiplicative consistency index and calculate its thresholds corresponding to different dimensions of preference matrix by the Monte Carlo experiment. Then, we construct a hesitant fuzzy linguistic model with granularity level, so as to recharacterize original assessment information and improve the consistency of preference matrices as far as possible. Considering the features of some large-scale group decision-making situation, where the decision makers have little opportunity to take part in multiple consensus reaching processes, hesitant fuzzy linguistic fuzzy C-means clustering algorithm is developed to integrate the assessment information given by decision makers.

Camera trap arrays have become the ‘gold standard’ method for surveying many terrestrial mammals and birds, but these arrays often generate millions of images that are challenging to process. This causes significant latency between data collection and subsequent inference, which can impede conservation at a time of ecological crisis. Machine learning algorithms have been developed to improve camera trap data processing speeds, but these models are not considered accurate enough for fully automated labeling of images. Here, we present a new approach to building and testing a high performance machine learning model for fully automated labeling of camera trap images. As a case-study, the model classifies 26 Central African forest mammal and bird species (or groups). The model was trained on a relatively small dataset (c.300,000 images) but generalizes to fully independent data and outperforms humans in several respects (e.g. detecting ‘invisible’ animals). We show how the model’s precision and accuracy can be evaluated in an ecological modeling context by comparing species richness, activity patterns (n = 4 species tested) and occupancy (n = 4 species tested) derived from machine learning labels with the same estimates derived from expert labels. Results show that fully automated labels can be equivalent to expert labels when calculating species richness, activity patterns (n = 4 species tested) and estimating occupancy (n = 3 of 4 species tested) in completely out-of-sample test data (n = 227 camera stations, n = 23868 images). Simple thresholding (discarding uncertain labels) improved the model’s performance when calculating activity patterns and estimating occupancy, but did not improve estimates of species richness.

Many countries especially those in the developing world continue to struggle with scaling up reverse transcriptase polymerase reaction (RT-PCR) to detect SARS-CoV-2 due to scarcity of resources. Alternatives such as antigen rapid diagnostics tests (Ag-RDTs) may provide a solution to enable countries to scale up testing. Methods In this study, we evaluated the PanbioTM and STANDARD Q Ag-RDTs in the laboratory using 80 COVID-19 RT-PCR confirmed and 80 negative nasopharyngeal swabs. The STANDARD-Q was further evaluated in the field on 112 symptomatic and 61 asymptomatic participants. Results For the laboratory evaluation, both tests had a sensitivity above 80% (PanbioTM = 86% vs STANDARD Q = 88%). The specificity of the PanbioTM was 100%, while that of the STANDARD Q was 99%. When evaluated in the field, the STANDARD Q maintained a high specificity of 99%, however the sensitivity was reduced to 56%. Conclusion Using Ag-RDTs in low resource settings will be helpful, however, negative results should be confirmed by RT-PCR where possible to rule out COVID-19 infection.","Konstantinus, I.

Administrative database analysis of viral testing results and vaccination history may be a viable alternative. This study compared VE estimates from outpatient research and administrative databases. Methods: Using the test-negative, case-control design, data for 2017-2018 and 2018-2019 influenza seasons, were collected using: 1) research methods including consent, specimen collection, RT-PCR testing and vaccine verification using multiple methods; and 2) an administrative database of outpatients with a clinical respiratory viral panel combined with electronic immunization records. Odds ratios for likelihood of influenza infection by vaccination status were calculated using multivariable logistic regression. VE = (1 - OR) X 100. Results: Research participants were significantly younger (P<0.001), more often white (69% vs. 59%; P<0.001) than non-white and less frequently enrolled through the emergency department (ED) (35% vs. 72%; P<0.001) than administrative database participants. VE was significant against all influenza and influenza A in each season and both seasons combined (37%-49%). Point estimate differences between methods were evident, with higher VE in the research database, but insignificant due to low sample sizes. When enrollment sites were separately analyzed, there were significant differences in VE estimates for all influenza (66% research vs. 46% administrative P<0.001) and influenza A (67% research vs. 49% administrative; P<0.001) in the ED. The selection of the appropriate method for determining influenza vaccine effectiveness depends on many factors, including sample size, subgroups of interest, etc., suggesting that research estimates may be more generalizable. Other advantages of research databases for VE estimates include lack of clinician-related selection bias for testing and less misclassification of vaccination status. The advantages of the administrative databases are potentially shorter time to VE results and lower cost.","Balasubramani, G. K.; Zimmerman, R. K.; Eng, H.; Lyons, J.; Clarke, L. G.; Nowalk, M.

COVID-19 vaccines were tested in clinical trials with thousands of participants before authorization, and were administered to over a billion people across the globe in the following 6 months. Post-authorization safety monitoring was performed using pre-existing systems (such as the World Health Organization's platform VigiBase or US Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, VAERS) and newly developed post-vaccination health checkers (such as V-safe in the US). Vaccinated individuals were also posting their experiences on multiple social media groups created on Facebook, Reddit, Telegram and other platforms, but the groups were often removed as ""proliferating false claims"". These forms of reporting are susceptible to biases and misclassifications and do not reach all vaccinated individuals, raising questions about risks of exacerbating health inequalities as well as security and privacy vulnerabilities.

We apply a socio-technical systems perspective and green ergonomics principles to investigate the relationship between an OPO environment and the occupants working within it.

We also consider how a green OPO might provide non-carbon benefits such as improving occupant well-being and supporting the emergence of a green organizational culture. Our investigation highlights several avenues through which an OPO designed with green ergonomic principles could benefit occupants, the organizations they work for, and the natural environment of which they are a part and on which they depend.

The Beacon Caresystem is a model-based bedside decision support system using mathematical models tuned to the individual patient's physiology to advise on appropriate ventilator settings. Personalised approaches using individual patient description may be particularly advantageous in complex patients, including those who are difficult to mechanically ventilate and wean, in particular ARDS. Methods: We will conduct a multi-centre international randomised, controlled, allocation concealed, open, pragmatic clinical trial to compare mechanical ventilation in ARDS patients following application of the Beacon Caresystem to that of standard routine care to investigate whether use of the system results in a reduction in driving pressure across all severities and phases of ARDS. Discussion. Despite 20 years of clinical trial data showing significant improvements in ARDS mortality through mitigation of ventilator induced lung injury, there remains a gap in its personalised application at the bedside. Importantly, the protective effects of higher positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) were noted only when there were associated decreases in driving pressure. Hence, the pressures set on the ventilator should be determined by the diseased lungs' pressure-volume relationship which is often unknown or difficult to determine. Knowledge of extent of recruitable lung could improve the ventilator driving pressure. Hence, personalised management demands the application of mechanical ventilation according to the physiological state of the diseased lung at that time. Hence, there is significant rationale for the development of point-of-care clinical decision support systems which help personalise ventilatory strategy according to the current physiology. Furthermore, the potential for the application of the Beacon Caresystem to facilitate local and remote management of large numbers of ventilated patients (as seen during this COVID-19 pandemic), could change the outcome of mechanically ventilated patients during the course of this and future pandemics.

These interrelations are represented by a graph whose nodes correspond to the financial instruments while the edges correspond to a pair-wise correlation function in between assets. DeepPocket consists of a restricted, stacked autoencoder for feature extraction, a convolutional network to collect underlying local information shared among financial instruments, and an actor-critic reinforcement learning agent. The actor-critic structure contains two convolutional networks in which the actor learns and enforces an investment policy which is, in turn, evaluated by the critic in order to determine the best course of action by constantly reallocating the various portfolio assets to optimize the expected return on investment.

We used the Australian national network of acoustic receivers facilitated by the Integrated Marine Observing System (IMOS) to describe the extent and frequency of movements for two large epipelagic shark species, the bronze whaler (C. brachyurus) and dusky shark (Carcharhinus obscurus). A total of 210 sharks (117 bronze whalers and 93 dusky sharks) were tracked for a 10-year period during which 21% and 9% of detected bronze whalers and dusky sharks, respectively, moved between Australian states. Bronze whalers showed more variable inter-state movements, mostly between Western Australia and South Australia but also eastwards to New South Wales (NSW). Although no dusky sharks tagged in Western Australia undertook inter-state movements, ~50% of the sharks tagged in South Australia went to Western Australia. Five dusky sharks tagged in NSW were detected across different states but remained on the east and southeast coast (Queensland, NSW, Victoria, and Tasmania). The IMOS receivers also detected six bronze whalers in Ningaloo Reef, representing an extension of the previously known Australian distribution. Our findings highlight the value of collaboration between researchers and the value of national infrastructure, by providing a more accurate understanding of inter-state movements.

We describe the rationale and methods of the Innovative Support for Patients with SARS-CoV-2 Registry (INSPIRE) that combines patient-reported outcomes with data from digital health records to understand predictors and impacts of SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: INSPIRE is a prospective, multicenter, longitudinal study of individuals with symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection in eight regions across the US. Included are adults fluent in English or Spanish, with self-reported symptoms suggestive of acute SARS-CoV-2 infection, enrolled within 42 days of having a US Food and Drug Administration approved SARS-CoV-2 viral test (i.e., nucleic acid amplification test or antigen test). Recruitment occurs in-person, by phone or email, and through online advertisement. A secure online platform is used to facilitate the collation of consent-related materials, digital health records, and responses to self-administered surveys. Participants will be followed for up to 18 months, with patient-reported outcomes collected every three months via survey and linked to concurrent digital health data; follow-up includes no in-person involvement.

The research was conducted pre-COVID-19. • Public housing renewal provides an opportunity for policy makers to give direction to urban reconfiguration processes. Since the 2000s public housing renewal has increasingly become part of a policy discourse that places emphasis on 'unlocking' under-utilised sites (i.e. public housing estates) for jobs, investment and urban renewal. In this intersection with urban renewal processes, mixed-tenure public housing renewal, in practice, becomes public housing urban renewal. • This research highlights a consistency of views across stakeholders (often on pragmatic grounds) regarding 'how public housing renewal works'. It is thus possible to conceptualise learning and evaluation in public housing renewal policy-making within an advocacy coalition framework (ACF). • An ACF framework focuses on the alignment of the beliefs, actions and interest of a range of stakeholders with respect to how policies work, or can work. Our use of the ACF is grounded in a consistency of views about 'how public housing renewal works', given the prevailing institutional and financial constraints, and the implication of this for the role of evaluation and learning, rather than any suggestion of a formal or informal actual coalition, or collusion, in agenda setting or public policy objectives. • Interviewees perceived evaluation to be one of several integral parts to the policy formation process. However, evaluations have frequently been summative, rather than formative in nature. In addition, stakeholders also relied on personal and institutional experience to inform policy development and decision-making. These learning dynamics have, over time, reinforced key aspects of the policy core belief within the advocacy coalition. • The policy core belief guiding public housing urban renewal is characterised by a shared belief in the instrumental role of land values and land value change as a means of reconciling multiple asset- and people-based outcomes, while controlling the cost of public policy to public budgets. Mixed tenure, housing density and the strategic leveraging of land are policies that also extract land value for public housing reinvestment and other public policy goals. • The central role of land and land value has raised concerns amongst tenants, groups external to the advocacy coalition, but also some of the interviewees that public housing renewal is increasingly driven by asset-based viability considerations and reduced government exposure to risk. While risk related to physical reconfiguration (public housing stock renewal) in this respect is reduced, other objectives (such as wider social and economic benefits for tenants) increasingly become shaped by - rather than shaping urban reconfiguration processes. • Core members of the public housing renewal advocacy coalition are state governments and private developers. Additional members are (in some cases) community housing providers (CHPs) and local governments. Policy formation within advocacy coalitions is shaped by multiple factors. This includes evaluations, but also reacting to external events and internal stakeholder dynamics. • In the contextual analysis in this research, change in relative income is used as an indicator of social and economic reconfiguration. Apart from Adelaide, census collection districts (CCD) subject to public housing renewal experienced little improvement in relative income status (1996-2016). • Citywide drivers (such as economic restructuring, urban sprawl containment, population growth) and neighbourhood drivers (such as economic obsolescence, relative incomes) are specific drivers of social and economic reconfiguration. These are evident in all three capital cities, leading to the potential to 'unlock' value through mixed tenure and public housing renewal. • Policy options exist that can unlock more inclusive c nceptualisations of value, and shift the reliance on land value in the program logic of public housing renewal. The design of public housing renewal tenders, and strategies for implementation, offer considerable opportunity for policy experimentation;identification and evaluation of assumed causal relationships and benefits. A social infrastructure perspective provides a framework for 'unlocking' additional and renewal project-specific values. A number of tools already exist to estimate the (equivalent) monetary value of wider social and economic benefits. © Australian Housing and Urban Research Institute Limited 2021","Nygaard, C.; Pinnegar, S.; Taylor, E.; Levin, I.; Maguire, R.",AHURI Final Report,202,22

Those alternative theories can be easily located among the family of conspiracy theories, as they always assume some secretive activity of some groups acting on their self-interest and against the good of the many. The article assesses the prevalence of these beliefs during the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy, studies its development during the pandemic, and investigates its potential determinants. In particular, it analyses the relationship between beliefs in alternative theories on the origin of the virus and political orientation, by arguing that the association cannot be attributed to (politically) motivated reasoning, as the issue has not been highly politicized in the Italian context. Alternatively, the article suggests that the main factor driving beliefs in alternative accounts on the origins of the virus is institutional trust.

We observe that during the second half of the first and second waves, the COVID-19 deaths are significantly higher than the excess mortality. We attribute the difference to the pre-dying effect. We then compare the excess mortality to the official COVID-19 death numbers and calculate the infection fatality rates (IFRs) and the percentage of infected individuals from excess mortality for different age bands. We also compare the impact of COVID-19 to past influenza waves and analyze the vaccination effect on excess mortality. Methods: We forecast the baseline mortality from official data on deaths in Germany. Distributing a part of excess mortality into the near future, we lower the baseline simulating the pre-dying effect. From there, we compare the excess mortality to official COVID-19 deaths. From the observed mortality deficit, we estimate the percentage of infected individuals and then estimate the age-dependent IFRs. Results: In the first wave, we find an overall excess mortality of ca. 8 000. For the second wave, the overall excess mortality adds up to ca. 56 000. We find, that the pre-dying effect explains the difference between the official COVID-19 deaths and excess mortality in the second half of the waves to a high degree. Attributing the whole excess mortality to COVID-19, we find that the IFRs are significantly higher in the second wave. In the third wave, we find an excess mortality in mid-age bands which cannot be explained by the official COVID-19 deaths. For the senior band 80+, we find results in favor of a strong and positive vaccination effect for the third COVID-19 wave. Conclusions: We conclude that in the first and second COVID-19 waves, the COVID-19 deaths explain almost all excess mortality when the pre-dying effect is taken into account. In the third wave in 2021, the excess mortality is not very pronounced for the 80+ age band, probably due to vaccination. The partially unvaccinated 40-80 age group experiences a pronounced excess mortality in the third wave while there are too few official COVID-19 deaths to explain the excess. The no-vaccination scenario for the 80+ age band results in a similarly high excess mortality as for the more younger age bands, suggesting a very positive vaccination effect on reduction of COVID-19 deaths.","Weber, A.",,202,13

The analysis relies on daily electricity consumption, nitrogen dioxide emission and mobility records to trace the economic disruptions caused by the pandemic and calibrate these measures to estimate the magnitude of the economic impact. To address the potential endogeneity in the introduction of NPIs, we instrument their stringency by the extent of a country's social ties to China. The results suggest that the NPIs led to a decline of about 10% in economic activity across the region. On average, countries that implemented non-pharmaceutical interventions in the early stages of the pandemic appear to have better short-term economic outcomes and lower cumulative mortality, compared with countries that imposed non-pharmaceutical interventions during the later stages of the pandemic. Moreover, there is evidence that COVID-19 mortality at the peak of the local outbreak has been lower in countries that acted earlier. In this sense, the results suggest that the sooner non-pharmaceutical interventions are implemented, the better are the economic and health outcomes.","Demirgüç-Kunt, Asli Lokshin Michael Torre Iván",Economics of Transition and Institutional Change,202,33

How the endomembrane system remodels has been poorly understood. Here we identify a new type of membrane contact formed between the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) and the ER-exit site (ERES) in the ER-Golgi system, which is essential for promoting autophagosome biogenesis induced by different stress stimuli. The ERGIC-ERES contact is established by the interaction between TMED9 and SEC12 which generates a short distance opposition (as close as 2-5 nm) between the two compartments. The tight membrane contact allows the ERES-located SEC12 to transactivate COPII assembly on the ERGIC. In addition, a portion of SEC12 also relocates to the ERGIC. Through both mechanisms, the ERGIC-ERES contact promotes formation of the ERGIC-derived COPII vesicle, a membrane precursor of the autophagosome. The ERGIC-ERES contact is physically and functionally different from the TFG-mediated ERGIC-ERES adjunction involved in secretory protein transport, and therefore defines a unique endomembrane structure generated upon stress conditions for autophagic membrane formation.","Li, Shulin; Yan, Rui; Xu, Jialu; Zhao, Shiqun; Ma, Xinyu; Sun, Qiming; Zhang, Min; Li, Ying; Liu, Jun-Jie Gogo; Chen, Liangyi; Li, Sai; Xu, Ke; Ge, Liang",bioRxiv,202,10

This has provided some commentators with newfound hope about the possibility that we will be able to solve what is arguably the greatest collective action problem of all time: global climate change. In this paper we argue that this is overly optimistic. We defend two main claims. First, these two collective action problems are so different that the actions that individuals have taken to try to solve the problem posed by Covid-19 unfortunately provide little indication that we will be able to solve the problem posed by climate change. Second, the actions that states have taken in response to Covid-19 might—if anything—even be evidence that they will continue to fail to cooperate towards a solution to the climate crisis. © 2021, Erasmus Journal for Philosophy and Economics.

To determine health impacts during, and following, an extended community lockdown and COVID-19 outbreak in the Australian state of Victoria, compared with the rest of Australia. Methods. A national cohort of 898 working-age Australians enrolled in a longitudinal cohort study, completing surveys before, during, and after a 112-day community lockdown in Victoria (8 July - 27 October 2020). Outcomes included psychological distress, mental and physical health, work, social interactions and finances. Regression models examined health changes during and following lockdown. Results. The Victorian lockdown led to increased psychological distress. Health impacts coincided with greater social isolation and work loss. Following the extended lockdown, mental health, work and social interactions recovered to an extent whereby no significant long-lasting effects were identified in Victoria compared to the rest of Australia. Conclusion. The Victorian community lockdown had adverse health consequences, which reversed upon release from lockdown. Governments should weigh all potential health impacts of lockdown. Services and programs to reduce the negative impacts of lockdown may include increases in mental health care, encouraging safe social interactions and supports to maintain employment relationships.","Griffiths, D.; Sheehan, L.; Petrie, D.; van Vreden, C.; Whiteford, P.; Collie, A.",,202,1

Due to the variety of subcellular localizations, cargo and transport mechanisms, such characterization is a daunting task, and predictive approaches focused on the functional context of transporters are very much needed. Here we present a case for identifying a transporter localization using evolutionary rate covariation (ERC), a computational approach based on pairwise correlations of amino acid sequence evolutionary rates across the mammalian phylogeny. As a case study, we find that poorly characterized transporter SLC30A9 (ZnT9) uniquely and prominently coevolves with several components of the mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation chain, suggesting mitochondrial localization. We confirmed this computational finding experimentally using recombinant human SLC30A9. SLC30A9 loss caused zinc mishandling in the mitochondria, suggesting that under normal conditions it acts as a zinc exporter. We therefore propose that ERC can be used to predict the functional context of novel transporters and other poorly characterized proteins.","Kowalczyk, Amanda; Gbadamosi, Omotola; Kolor, Kathryn; Sosa, Jahree; St Croix, Claudette; Gibson, Gregory; Chikina, Maria; Aizenman, Elias; Clark, Nathan; Kiselyov, Kirill",bioRxiv,202,13

Solid evidence on the effect on postoperative infection rates is missing. Due to a national scarcity in surgical masks during the first wave of the COVID-19 crisis the usage of these masks was decreased. In our tertiary referral centre for Surgical Oncology, this led to the decision that, for a period of ten weeks, the surgical masks were only being used by the sterile surgical team and not by non-sterile operation theatre personnel. This retrospective study evaluates the influence of this intervention in terms of postoperative wound infection rates. DESIGN Retrospective cohort study. METHOD Consecutive patients undergoing surgery during the first COVID-19 wave (2-3-2020 until 11-05-2020) were compared with patients undergoing surgery in the same period a year earlier. Patients undergoing surgery for soft-tissue malignancies were included. Intra-abdominal surgery was excluded. Primary outcome measurement was wound infection rate within 30 days following surgery. Secondary, a cost reduction analysis was made. RESULTS In the COVID-19 wave, a total of 219 patients underwent surgery for soft-tissue malignancies, compared to 241 a year earlier. The incidence of postoperative wound infection was 58/460 (12.6%) for the total cohort. There was no difference in infection rate between the COVID-19 period and the same period in 2019; 25/219 (11,4%; 95% CI: 7,8-16,4)) vs. 33/241 (13,7%; 95% CI: 9,8-18,6), p = 0,46) respectively. During the COVID-19 wave, a total of 6.400 of surgical masks were used by the personnel in the operation theatre complex, compared to a total of 11.000 in the same period in 2019. This resulted in a reduction of 42% in usage of surgical masks. CONCLUSION Based on this mono-centric, explorative retrospective cohort study, it seems that omitting the surgical mask for the non-sterile operation theatre personnel does not influence the postoperative wound infection rate. Despite the fact that our sample size is small, the impressive reduction in usage of 42% demands further research initiatives on a larger scale.","Borstlap, W A A; van Hilst, J; Kuhlmann, K F D; Oldenburg, H S A; van Houdt, W J; Ruers, T J M",Nederlands tijdschrift voor geneeskunde,202,11

In 1986 a TGE-like virus, tentatively named porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV), was isolated from the lungs of swine. The virus was partially characterized using monoclonal antibodies against TGEV and this showed that some (mainly nonneutralizing) epitopes of the peplomer glycoprotein E2 were absent in PRCV, whereas the major neutralizing domains were conserved. These findings allowed the design of competitive antibody immunoassays either discriminating or not discriminating the immune responses against the two viruses.

In addition, NDV may enter host cells by an endocytic pathway. Treatment of cells with drugs that block caveolae-dependent endocytosis reduced NDV fusion and infectivity, the degree of inhibition being dependent on virus concentration. The inhibitory effect was reduced greatly when drugs were added after virus adsorption. Cells treated with methyl beta-cyclodextrin, a drug that sequesters cholesterol from membranes, reduced the extent of fusion, infectivity and virus-cell binding; this indicates that cholesterol plays a role in NDV entry. Double-labelling immunofluorescence assays performed with anti-NDV monoclonal antibodies and antibodies against the early endosome marker EEA1 revealed the localization of the virus in these intracellular structures. Using fluorescence microscopy, it was found that cell-cell fusion was enhanced at low pH. It is concluded that NDV may infect cells through a caveolae-dependent endocytic pathway, suggesting that this pathway could be an alternative route for virus entry into cells.","Cantín, Celia; Holguera, Javier; Ferreira, Laura; Villar, Enrique; Muñoz-Barroso, Isabel",The Journal of general virology,202,1

Nephron-sparing surgery (NSS)ensures excellent oncological and functional outcomes in treating small renal masses. Laparo- Endoscopic-Single-Site Surgery (LESS)is one of the major advances in the evolution of minimally invasive surgery. METHODS A prospective evaluation of patients underwent LESS NSS at our institutions for a solitary, exophytic, enhancing, small (= 4.0 cm) renal masses and normal controlateral kidney was done. Peri-operative, pathological, hematological data together with a subjective evaluation of the pain (VAS) and the scars were collected. A comprehensive electronic literature search was conducted in May 2011 using the Medline database to identify all publications relating to LESS NSS. RESULTS Fourteen patients were operated by a LESS unclamp NSS and 6 patients by a clamp LESS NSS (mean operative time: 125 min and 137.4 min; mean blood loss: 207 ml and 113 ml). The mean warm ischemia time in the LESS clamped NSS was 11.1±2.4 min using an early unclamped technique. Neither conversion to open surgery nor transfusions occurred. Three patients required conversion to standard laparoscopy. Postoperatively, we recorded 1 Clavien II (acute gastritis), 1 Clavien IIIa (urinary fistula after NSS) and 1 Clavien IV (cerebral stroke) complications. Pathology revealed 13 T1a clear cell carcinoma, 4 complex renal cysts, 2 oncocytoma and 1 angiomyolipoma (surgical margin positive). With a minimal postoperative pain (VAP: 1.8 in POD1) the patients were discharged after 4.4 days without variation in eGFR. No local or distant progression was detected. Current literature suggest that LESS NSS can safely and effectively be performed in a variety of urologic settings and represent one of the major interests among the LESS procedures . Although, the quality of evidence of all available studies remains low, mostly being small case series or case control studies from selected centers. CONCLUSIONS LESS NSS in selected renal masses is feasible, provides postoperative outcomes overlapping the standard counterpart and ensures subjective satisfaction. A more extensive surgical experience and a prolonged follow-up are necessary to point out the role of this technique.","Cindolo, Luca; Greco, Francesco; Fornara, Paolo; Mirone, Vincenzo; Schips, Luigi",Archivos espanoles de urologia,202,16

In Man (West Ivory Coast) region for instance, Rotaviruses and Coronaviruses were mainly encountered; in Bouaké, Polioviruses and Adenoviruses were predominant whereas in Bondoukou and Odienné respectively Coxsackieviruses and Adenoviruses were predominantly identified. Multiple viral infections were also evidenced: Rotaviruses + Coronaviruses, Rotaviruses + Polioviruses, Coronaviruses + Polioviruses, Polioviruses and Adenoviruses. The greatest number of multiple infections was found in Man (8 cases). Inapparent infections were mainly detected in Man where the prevalence for at least one viral type is very high 91.6%; in Bouaké, prevalence of at least one viral type is around 36%. The least level of prevalence was recorded in Bondoukou (East of Ivory Coast) and Odienné (North-West) respectively 17% and 20%.","Gershy-Damet, G M; Koffi, K; Soro, B; Dosso, M; Saracino, J C; N'Goran, S; Sangare, A; Ehouman, A",Bulletin de la Societe de pathologie exotique et de ses filiales,202,16

During distressing events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, there is a concern that physical activity levels may be negatively impacted. However, recent studies have shown inconsistent results. Additionally, there is a lack of studies in Australia on this topic. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to investigate changes in physical activity reported through the 10,000 Steps program and changes in engagement with the program during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Data between January 1, 2018, and June 30, 2020, from registered members of the 10,000 Steps program, which included 3,548,825 days with step data, were used. The number of daily steps were logged manually by the members or synced automatically from their activity trackers connected to the program. Measures on program usage were the number of new registered members per day, the number of newly registered organizations per day, the number of steps logged per day, and the number of step entries per day. Key dates used for comparison were as follows: the first case with symptoms in Wuhan, China; the first case reported in Australia; the implementation of a 14-day ban for noncitizens arriving in Australia from China; the start of the lockdown in Australia; and the relaxing of restrictions by the Australian Government. Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were used to test for significant differences in number of steps between subgroups, between engagement measures in 2019 versus 2020, and before and after an event. RESULTS: A decrease in steps was observed after the first case in Australia was reported (1.5%; P=.02) and after the start of the lockdown (3.4%; P<.001). At the time that the relaxing of restrictions started, the steps had already recovered from the lockdown. Additionally, the trends were consistent across genders and age groups. New South Wales, Australian Capital Territory, and Victoria had the greatest step reductions, with decreases of 7.0% (P<.001), 6.2% (P=.02), and 4.7% (P<.001), respectively. During the lockdown, the use of the program increased steeply. On the peak day, there were more than 9000 step entries per day, with nearly 100 million steps logged per day; in addition, more than 450 new users and more than 15 new organizations registered per day, although the numbers decreased quickly when restrictions were relaxed. On average per day, there were about 55 new registered users (P<.001), 2 new organizations (P<.001), 25.6 million steps (P<.001), and 2672 log entries (P<.001) more in 2020 compared to the same period in 2019. CONCLUSIONS: The pandemic has had negative effects on steps among Australians across age groups and genders. However, the effect was relatively small, with steps recovering quickly after the lockdown. There was a large increase in program usage during the pandemic, which might help minimize the health impact of the lockdown and confirms the important role of physical activity programs during times of distress and lockdowns.","To, Quyen G; Duncan, Mitch J; Van Itallie, Anetta; Vandelanotte, Corneel",J Med Internet Res,202,7

This unprecedented situation has generated a decrease in assistance and academic activities in most medical residences. The aim of this manuscript is to evaluate the impact of this health crisis on training programs through a survey addressed to urology medical residents. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cross sectional designed study, with multiple-choice non validated survey answered online by residents. Questionnaire was developed through the CAU EDUCACION platform. RESULTS: A total of 148 responses from 18 countries coming from Latin America and Spain answering the survey. Of total, 82% answered that the activity of their urology department was significantly reduced, attending only urgent surgical pathologies, 15 % that, the urology activity has been closed completely and the staff was assigned to COVID-19 patients care, 3% continue with the regular clinic activity. Likewise, 75% stated that their surgical training has been completely affected, 93% receive urological information through tools such as Skype, ZOOM meeting, Cisco Webex, being Webinar modality the most used. Despite technological boom, 65% answered their academic training has been partially or completely affected. Most of the surveyed residents consider that period of residence should be extended to retrieve the educational targets. CONCLUSION: This unprecedented reality is negatively impacting the heterogeneous residency programs that American Confederation of Urology (CAU) nucleates. It is necessary to continue with technological innovation and allocate time and resources to easily generate accessible tools to favor the training of future urologists.","Paesano, Nahuel; Santomil, Fernando; Tobia, Ignacio",Int Braz J Urol,202,19

This infection is highly contagiousness, has a high morbidity, and is capable of evolving into a potentially lethal form of interstitial pneumonia. Numerous countries shut-down various activities that were considered ""not essential."" Dental treatment was in this category and, at the time of writing, only non-deferrable emergencies are still allowed in many countries. Therefore, follow-up visits of ongoing active therapies (e.g., orthodontic treatment) must be handled taking special precautions. This literature review aims at reducing in-office appointments by providing an overview of the technologies available and their reliability in the long-distance monitoring of patients, i.e., teledentistry. METHODS: A literature review was made according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Protocols (PRISMA-P) guidelines. Randomized clinical trials, cross sectional, observational, and case-control studies were evaluated with the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool for quality assessment and study limitations. RESULTS: A primary search found 80 articles, 69/80 were excluded as non-relevant on the basis of: the abstract, title, study design, bias, and/or lack of relevance. Twelve articles were included in the qualitative analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Teleorthodontics can manage most emergencies, reassuring and following patients remotely. The aim set by dental teleassistance was met as it reduced patients' office visits whilst maintaining regular monitoring, without compromising the results. Although our preliminary findings should be further investigated to objectively evaluate the efficacy, cost-effectiveness, and long-term results, we are confident that teleassistance in orthodontics will have a role to play in the near future.","Maspero, Cinzia; Abate, Andrea; Cavagnetto, Davide; El Morsi, Mohamed; Fama, Andrea; Farronato, Marco",,202,16

However, the immunogenicity of this vaccine in humans against SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern remains unclear. Here we report humoral and cellular immune responses from 20 Ad26.COV2.S vaccinated individuals from the COV1001 phase I-IIa clinical trial2 against the original SARS-CoV-2 strain WA1/2020 as well as against the B.1.1.7, CAL.20C, P.1 and B.1.351 variants of concern. Ad26.COV2.S induced median pseudovirus neutralizing antibody titres that were 5.0-fold and 3.3-fold lower against the B.1.351 and P.1 variants, respectively, as compared with WA1/2020 on day 71 after vaccination. Median binding antibody titres were 2.9-fold and 2.7-fold lower against the B.1.351 and P.1 variants, respectively, as compared with WA1/2020. Antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis, complement deposition and natural killer cell activation responses were largely preserved against the B.1.351 variant. CD8 and CD4 T cell responses, including central and effector memory responses, were comparable among the WA1/2020, B.1.1.7, B.1.351, P.1 and CAL.20C variants. These data show that neutralizing antibody responses induced by Ad26.COV2.S were reduced against the B.1.351 and P.1 variants, but functional non-neutralizing antibody responses and T cell responses were largely preserved against SARS-CoV-2 variants. These findings have implications for vaccine protection against SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern.","Alter, Galit; Yu, Jingyou; Liu, Jinyan; Chandrashekar, Abishek; Borducchi, Erica N; Tostanoski, Lisa H; McMahan, Katherine; Jacob-Dolan, Catherine; Martinez, David R; Chang, Aiquan; Anioke, Tochi; Lifton, Michelle; Nkolola, Joseph; Stephenson, Kathryn E; Atyeo, Caroline; Shin, Sally; Fields, Paul; Kaplan, Ian; Robins, Harlan; Amanat, Fatima; Krammer, Florian; Baric, Ralph S; Le Gars, Mathieu; Sadoff, Jerald; de Groot, Anne Marit; Heerwegh, Dirk; Struyf, Frank; Douoguih, Macaya; van Hoof, Johan; Schuitemaker, Hanneke; Barouch, Dan H",Nature (Lond.),202,1

However, there are limited data on health information, beliefs, and behaviors that might indicate different exposure to risk. Objective: To determine the association of sociodemographic characteristics with reported incidence, knowledge, and behavior regarding COVID-19 among US adults. Design, Setting, and Participants: A US national survey study was conducted from March 29 to April 13, 2020, to measure differences in knowledge, beliefs, and behavior about COVID-19. The survey oversampled COVID-19 hotspot areas. The survey was conducted electronically. The criteria for inclusion were age 18 years or older and residence in the US. Data analysis was performed in April 2020. Main Outcomes and Measures: The main outcomes were incidence, knowledge, and behaviors related to COVID-19 as measured by survey response. Results: The survey included 5198 individuals (mean [SD] age, 48 [18] years; 2336 men [45%]; 3759 white [72%], 830 [16%] African American, and 609 [12%] Hispanic). The largest differences in COVID-19-related knowledge and behaviors were associated with race/ethnicity, sex, and age, with African American participants, men, and people younger than 55 years showing less knowledge than other groups. African American respondents were 3.5 percentage points (95% CI, 1.5 to 5.5 percentage points; P = .001) more likely than white respondents to report being infected with COVID-19, as were men compared with women (3.2 percentage points; 95% CI, 2.0 to 4.4 percentage points; P < .001). Knowing someone who tested positive for COVID-19 was more common among African American respondents (7.2 percentage points; 95% CI, 3.4 to 10.9 percentage points; P < .001), people younger than 30 years (11.6 percentage points; 95% CI, 7.5 to 15.7 percentage points; P < .001), and people with higher incomes (coefficient on earning &#8805;$100â¯000, 12.3 percentage points; 95% CI, 8.7 to 15.8 percentage points; P < .001). Knowledge of potential fomite spread was lower among African American respondents (-9.4 percentage points; 95% CI, -13.1 to -5.7 percentage points; P < .001), Hispanic respondents (-4.8 percentage points; 95% CI, -8.9 to -0.77 percentage points; P = .02), and people younger than 30 years (-10.3 percentage points; 95% CI, -14.1 to -6.5 percentage points; P < .001). Similar gaps were found with respect to knowledge of COVID-19 symptoms and preventive behaviors. Conclusions and Relevance: In this survey study of US adults, there were gaps in reported incidence of COVID-19 and knowledge regarding its spread and symptoms and social distancing behavior. More effort is needed to increase accurate information and encourage appropriate behaviors among minority communities, men, and younger people.","Alsan, Marcella; Stantcheva, Stefanie; Yang, David; Cutler, David",JAMA Netw Open,202,6

There are few studies on the contamination pathway of PAEs from labels or tapes to food stuff. In this study, the concentrations of eleven PAEs in adhesive labels, tapes, labeled fruits and vegetables on the market were investigated. The eleven PAEs were detected with the total concentration of 7.44-30.51 mg/m2 in labels and tapes. Diethyl phthalate (DEP), di-n-butyl phthalate (DIBP), dimethyl phthalate (DMP), Bis (2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) and di-n-butyl phthalate (DBP) had the highest detection frequency in adhesive material samples. The concentrations of PAEs in labeled fruits were higher than that in unlabeled fruits, especially in the peel, indicating PAEs could transfer from labels or tapes to fruits and vegetables. Furthermore, the migration behaviors of PAEs from labels or tapes to apples, avocados and celery were investigated. It was found that the PAEs could penetrate to apple and avocado pulp through the peel, resulting in the residue of the PAEs in the whole fruit. Unlike apple peel, the thick avocado peel was more difficultly penetrated by the PAEs. Due to the high lipid content, the PAEs distributed more evenly in avocado pulp than in apple pulp. The migrations up to a maximum of 4.16 mg/kg were found for butyl benzyl phthalate (BBP) in avocado peel and up to a maximum of 0.188 mg/kg in avocado pulp. The average migration of the PAEs in celery ranged from 0.3 to 26.1 µg/kg in three days and the low migration might result from the rough surface and less contacting area. These findings suggest that the use of labels or tapes in direct contact may increase the risk of PAEs exposure to humans through fruits and vegetables.","Hou, Haonan; Min, Yihao; Liu, Xueke; Wang, Peng; Zhou, Zhiqiang; Liu, Donghui",J Hazard Mater,202,2

Many countries were to a large extent unprepared for such a situation, even though predictions about a significant probability for a pandemic to occur existed, and national governments of several countries often acted in an uncoordinated manner, which resulted in many inconsistencies in the disaster risk reduction processes. Limited evidence has also made room for strategic narratives meant to persuade the public of the chosen set of actions, even though the degree of uncertainty regarding the outcomes of these was high, further complicating the situation. In this article, we assume a normative standpoint regarding rhapsodic decision making and suggest an integrated framework for a more elaborated decision analysis under the ambiguity of how to contain the virus spread from a policy point of view, while considering epidemiologic estimations and socioeconomic factors in a multi-stakeholder-multi-criteria context based on a co-creative work process for eliciting attitudes, perceptions, as well as preferences amongst relevant stakeholder groups. The framework, applied in our paper on Romania for demonstrative purposes, is used for evaluating mitigation measures for catastrophic events such as the COVID-19 situation, to mobilize better response strategies for future scenarios related to pandemics and other hazardous events, as well as to structure the production and analysis of narratives on the current pandemic effects.","Ekenberg, Love; Mihai, Adriana; Fasth, Tobias; Komendantova, Nadejda; Danielson, Mats",Front Public Health,202,10

Weight loss strategies that easily can be integrated into daily life are needed, but knowledge about how TRE affects daily life is lacking. This study examined how individuals having overweight or obesity at high risk of type 2 diabetes performed TRE in daily life, with a focus on how the timing of eating changed the organisation and rhythms of daily activities. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with participants enrolled in a randomised controlled trial studying the effect of a 12-week TRE intervention focusing on a self-selected daily 10-h window between 6 AM and 8 PM. Seventeen participants from the intervention group were interviewed at baseline and end of intervention, and data were analysed using a thematic analysis approach. Participants found TRE simple and appealing due to the unrestricted dietary intake. In general, participants did not change their food preferences and continued to eat three main daily meals. However, participants had to increase their awareness of the time of day, reshuffle ordinary daily activities and plan their intake more carefully. Two participants reported fully adherence every day, whereas all other participants reported one to several episodes of intake outside their window during the 12 weeks. Social evening activities and collective rhythms were largest barriers. Our findings suggest that TRE interventions would benefit from a broader perspective on daily life and an expanded view on families and friends as joint units of intervention. TRE interventions should consider individuals' daily rhythms and help them develop practical solutions to integrating new eating practices.","Bjerre, Natasja; Holm, Lotte; Quist, Jonas Salling; Færch, Kristine; Hempler, Nana Folmann",Appetite,202,16

Patients and Methods: In this retrospective cross-sectional study, we identified 264 confirmed cases with COVID-19 at King Saud University Medical City in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Patients aged 18-80 years were included, and their electronic records were reviewed. They were classified into low, intermediate, and high risk of CVD according to FRS classification. Results: Two-hundred-six patients (67% male) were included in this study. The mean age was 55.3 ± 15.1 years. Most patients had comorbidities: the most common were hypertension (48.1%), diabetes (45.1%), and ischemic heart disease (11.2%). More than half required intensive care admission, and 58 (28.2%) patients died. Pneumonia was the most frequently observed complication (85%), followed by mechanical ventilation (28.3%) and acute kidney injury (27.7%). Age, male gender, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus showed significant differences between FRS categories, and were associated with intermediate and high-risk groups of FRS (p < 0.05). Pneumonia and length of stay were associated with the Intermediate risk group of FRS. Conclusion: Cardiovascular disease risk factors are prevalent in Saudi patients infected with COVID-19. FRS could be a useful tool to identify CVD risk factors among COVID-19 patients and predict a complicated course.","Alshaikh, Mashael K; Alotair, Hadil; Alnajjar, Farrah; Sharaf, Hanaa; Alhafi, Bader; Alashgar, Lolwah; Aljuaid, Mohammed",Vasc Health Risk Manag,202,16

The purpose of this study was to test whether the prepandemic functional connectome predicted individual anxiety induced by the pandemic. METHODS: Anxiety scores from healthy undergraduate students were collected during the severe and remission periods of the pandemic (first survey, February 22-28, 2020, N=589; second survey, April 24 to May 1, 2020, N=486). Brain imaging data and baseline (daily) anxiety ratings were acquired before the pandemic. The predictive performance of the functional connectome on individual anxiety was examined using machine learning and was validated in two external undergraduate student samples (N=149 and N=474). The clinical relevance of the findings was further explored by applying the connectome-based neuromarkers of pandemic-related anxiety to distinguish between individuals with specific mental disorders and matched healthy control subjects (generalized anxiety disorder, N=43; major depression, N=536; schizophrenia, N=72). RESULTS: Anxiety scores increased from the prepandemic baseline to the severe stage of the pandemic and remained high in the remission stage. The prepandemic functional connectome predicted pandemic-related anxiety and generalized to the external sample but showed poor performance for predicting daily anxiety. The connectome-based neuromarkers of pandemic-related anxiety further distinguished between participants with generalized anxiety and healthy control subjects but were not useful for diagnostic classification in major depression and schizophrenia. CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate the feasibility of using the functional connectome to predict individual anxiety induced by major stressful events (e.g., the current global health crisis), which advances our understanding of the neurobiological basis of anxiety susceptibility and may have implications for developing targeted psychological and clinical interventions that promote the reduction of stress and anxiety.","He, Li; Wei, Dongtao; Yang, Fan; Zhang, Jie; Cheng, Wei; Feng, Jianfeng; Yang, Wenjing; Zhuang, Kaixiang; Chen, Qunlin; Ren, Zhiting; Li, Yu; Wang, Xiaoqin; Mao, Yu; Chen, Zhiyi; Liao, Mei; Cui, Huiru; Li, Chunbo; He, Qinghua; Lei, Xu; Feng, Tingyong; Chen, Hong; Xie, Peng; Rolls, Edmund T; Su, Linyan; Li, Lingjiang; Qiu, Jiang",Am J Psychiatry,202,16

In this systematic review, the importance of isolation and contact tracing has been explained, and what kinds of practices exist in different countries are mentioned. Methods: A systematic review was conducted in accordance with the PRISMA and Cochrane guidelines by searching articles from major medical databases such as Google Scholar, PubMed/MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, CINAHL between Jan 1, 2020 and Apr 1, 2021. Observational and modeling studies written on contact tracing, screening, quarantine and isolation were included. Results: 27 observational and modeling studies were included. It was seen that rapid contact tracing to reduce the basic reproduction number (R0) from 3.11 to 0.21. Additionally, each new case requires an average of 36 people to be monitored. Since screening programs missed 75% of cases, high-level contact tracing should also be done simultaneously. Wide quarantine would prevent 79.27% deaths and 87.08% infections. Conclusion: Effective, rapid contact tracing is the cornerstone of an effective public health response in out-breaks. Its success depends on quickly identifying cases, gathering information from them about their last contacts, and tracing and isolating those contacts. © 2021 Koçak.

Due to the heterogeneity of ACHD and secondary complications, risk profiles are, however, not uniform. This document aims to give an overview of relevant data and outline our pragmatic approach to disease prevention and management. Based on anatomy and additional physiological factors including symptoms, exercise capacity, heart failure, pulmonary hypertension and cyanosis, we propose a pragmatic approach to categorising patients into low-risk, intermediate-risk and high-risk groups. We regard especially patients with complex cyanotic conditions, those with palliated univentricular hearts, heart failure, severe valvular disease or pulmonary hypertension as high-risk patients. To avoid infection, we recommend self-isolation and exemption from work for these cohorts. Infected ACHD patients with low or moderate risk and without signs of deterioration may be remotely followed and cared for at home while in self isolation. High-risk patients or those with signs of respiratory or cardiovascular impairment require admission ideally at a tertiary ACHD centre. Especially patients with complex, cyanotic disease, heart failure and arrhythmias require particular attention. Treatment in patients with cyanotic heart disease should be guided by the relative degree of desaturation compared with baseline and lactate levels rather than absolute oxygen saturation levels. Patients with right heart dilatation or dysfunction are potentially at increased risk of right heart failure as mechanical ventilation and acute respiratory distress syndrome can lead to increase in pulmonary arterial pressures.","Radke, Robert M; Frenzel, Tim; Baumgartner, Helmut; Diller, Gerhard-Paul",Heart,202,22

Some patients develop severe complications including multiple organ failure. It has been suggested that excessive inflammation associated with the disease plays major role in the severity and mortality of COVID-19. To elucidate the inflammatory mechanisms involved in COVID-19, we examined the effects of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein S1 subunit (hereafter S1) on the pro-inflammatory responses in murine and human macrophages. Murine peritoneal exudate macrophages produced pro-inflammatory mediators in response to S1 exposure. Exposure to S1 also activated nuclear factor-B (NF-B) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling pathways. Pro-inflammatory cytokine induction by S1 was suppressed by selective inhibitors of NF-B and JNK pathways. Treatment of murine peritoneal exudate macrophages and human THP-1 cell-derived macrophages with a toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) antagonist attenuated pro-inflammatory cytokine induction and the activation of intracellular signaling by S1 and lipopolysaccharide. Similar results were obtained in experiments using TLR4 siRNA-transfected murine RAW264.7 macrophages. In contrast, TLR2 neutralizing antibodies could not abrogate the S1-induced pro-inflammatory cytokine induction in either RAW264.7 or THP-1 cell-derived macrophages. These results suggest that SARS-CoV-2 spike protein S1 subunit activates TLR4 signaling to induce pro-inflammatory responses in murine and human macrophages. Therefore, TLR4 signaling in macrophages may be a potential target for regulating excessive inflammation in COVID-19 patients.","Shirato, K.; Kizaki, T.",Heliyon,202,12

Research provides evidence of a COVID Stress Syndrome (CSS), consisting of (1) worry about the dangerousness of getting infected with SARSCoV2 and coming into contact with infected surfaces, (2) worry concerning the personal socioeconomic consequences of COVID-19, (3) xenophobic fears that SARSCOV2 is being spread by foreigners, (4) COVID-19-related traumatic stress symptoms (e.g., nightmares), and (5) compulsive checking and reassurance-seeking about COVID-19. Little is known about how these symptoms are related to vulnerability and protective personality factors. Based on data from 1,976 US and Canadian adults, we conducted a prospective network analysis in which personality factors were initially assessed at Time 1 and then symptoms of the CSS were assessed at Time 2, 2.5 months later. Results indicated that trait optimism and trait resilience were negatively associated with negative emotionality, suggesting a modulatory (inhibitory) influence. Negative emotionality was positively linked to the narrower traits of intolerance of uncertainty and health anxiety proneness. These narrower traits, in turn, were prospectively linked to symptoms of the CSS. Results suggest that the effects of broad personality traits (e.g., negative emotionality, trait resilience) on symptoms of the CSS were mediated by narrower traits such as the intolerance of uncertainty.

METHODS: A cohort of 90 cladribine-treated patients with follow-up data reported by treating physicians and recorded in the Australian MSBase registry (database lock February 2016) were examined. Clinical data included Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) scores, relapses and other disease-modifying drugs (DMDs) administered before and after cladribine treatment. RESULTS: Mean age on starting cladribine was 47 years; mean age at MS onset was 34 years, and median baseline EDSS score was 5.25. Disability trajectories in patients with sufficient follow-up suggested an overall increasing trend prior to cladribine treatment which was reduced during the 2-year post-treatment. Approximately 80% of patients were EDSS progression-free, 65% remained relapse-free after 2 years and median time to next DMD was 1.7 years. CONCLUSION: These observational data suggest a disease-modifying effect in this cohort of relapsing MS patients characterised by older and more disabled patients. Since these data represent a single-arm cohort, clinical trials and larger comparative post-marketing studies are needed to validate and extend these findings.","Lizak, Nathaniel; Hodgkinson, Suzanne; Butler, Ernest; Lechner-Scott, Jeannette; Slee, Mark; McCombe, Pamela Ann; Shaw, Cameron; Skibina, Olga; Vucic, Steve; Shuey, Neil; Barnett, Michael H; Parratt, John; Butzkueven, Helmut; Jack, Dominic; Fabris, Jessica; Kalincik, Tomas",Mult Scler,202,1

METHODS: AYA oncology patients attended a weekend retreat. They completed the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - General (FACT-G) before, 1 month after, and 6 months after the weekend retreat. Controls were age-matched oncology patients who did not attend the retreat. FINDINGS: Retreat participants' scores did not significantly change over time; however, retreat participants' scores at 1-month follow-up were significantly higher than control group scores. CONCLUSIONS: AYA oncology patients may experience transient improvement in psychological well-being after attending a retreat, but benefits may not be durable. Work remains needed to examine the impact of retreat attendance on specific aspects of psychosocial well-being. Implications for psychosocial oncology: Work is needed to decrease perceived attendance barriers for AYA oncology patients who have a low quality of life. Future retreat planners may consider modifying retreat activities and consider alternative retreat locations that appeal to campers with limited mobility, chronic pain, and/or other quality of life limitations. Additional study is needed to determine whether brief overnight or weekend retreats can be as effective as week-long camps in enhancing oncology patients' quality of life. Future researchers should compare changes in weekend retreat attendees' quality of life to changes in quality of life for a control group (e.g., via a waitlist control study design).","Antonetti, Callah; Stromberg, Sarah E; Costello, Aimee; Faith, Melissa A; Shaw, Peter H",J Psychosoc Oncol,202,16

225599,225599,225599,COVID-19s impacts on Global Supply Chains: Facts and Perspectives,15.583891,1.8917533,2020,"OBJECTIVES: It is important to quantify the true burden of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in different countries, to enable informed decisions about imposing and relaxing control measures. COVID-19 surveillance data fails in this respect, as it is influenced by different definitions, control policies and capacities. This article aims to quantify excess mortality and estimate the distribution between COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 causes of death. STUDY DESIGN: Observational study and mathematical modelling. METHODS: Publicly available data from multiple institutional sources were used and an in-depth analysis was carried out of deaths from all causes between 2015 and 2020 in Italy at the national, regional and local level. Excess mortality over time and space was first explored, followed by an assessment of how this related to COVID-19 surveillance and, ultimately, assuming a fixed male:female ratio, a model was developed and applied to estimate the proportions of COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 excess mortality in 2020. RESULTS: In Italy, the mortality rate doubled in March and April 2020 compared with data from 2015 to 2019 (+109%, when considering municipalites with >10.000 inhabitants), with excess mortality reaching >600% in large municipalities in northern areas. Notified COVID-19 deaths accounted for only 43.5% (regional range: 43-62%) of excess mortality. It is estimated that more than two-thirds of excess deaths that were not captured by surveillance are non-COVID-19 deaths, which could be a result of the excess burden on the health systems, in addition to reduced demand and supply of other non-COVID healthcare services. CONCLUSIONS: The impact of COVID-19 during the early stages of the pandemic is much larger than official figures have reported. Monitoring excess mortality helps to capture the full effect of the COVID-19 pandemic, which differs between regions in Italy and which might have resulted in significant indirect effects on the well-being of the population. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic has also resulted in significant indirect effects on the well-being of the population.","Odone, A; Delmonte, D; Gaetti, G; Signorelli, C",Public Health,202,18

Most patients now prefer to obtain their doctor's care and check their health status through their mobile phone call, Skype, Facebook Messenger, or other online resources. There is, however, a major concern about the privacy of patients when using online resources. Patients usually choose to keep their information confidential, which should be only accessible to authorized individuals. The most current remote patient monitoring system is organization-centric and patient's privacy and security rely on healthcare providers' mercy. Blockchain technologies have attracted the attention of researchers for designing eHealth applications to provide patients with secure and privacy-preserving health services. Blockchain researchers have recently proposed some models for remote patient monitoring systems. However, most of those researchers have applied public blockchains where health data is available to all participants with the property of data tamper-proof. In this paper, we propose a novel remote patient monitoring model using a decentralized private blockchain to protect patient's privacy and increase the system's efficiency. The private blockchain will be implemented on Hyperledger Fabric where a Patient-centric Agents (PCA) manage patient's data and coordinate authorization to form a secure channel to transmit data to the private blockchain. A hybrid consensus by combining Proof of Integrity (PoI) and Proof of Validity (PoV) is used to protect data privacy and integrity when retrieving data from a blockchain-based cloud database. Finally, the Merkle Tree algorithm was used for data processing and authentication when collecting data and uploading it to a cloud database. © 2020 IEEE.","Wadud, M. A. H.; Amir-Ul-Haque Bhuiyan, T.

But do liberals and conservatives in the United States embrace conspiratorial thinking to an equivalent degree? There are important historical, philosophical, and scientific reasons dating back to Richard Hofstadter's book The Paranoid Style in American Politics to doubt this claim. In four large studies of U.S. adults (total N = 5049)—including national samples—we investigated the relationship between political ideology, measured in both symbolic and operational terms, and conspiratorial thinking in general. Results reveal that conservatives in the United States were not only more likely than liberals to endorse specific conspiracy theories, but they were also more likely to espouse conspiratorial worldviews in general (r =.27, 95% CI:.24,.30). Importantly, extreme conservatives were significantly more likely to engage in conspiratorial thinking than extreme liberals (Hedges' g =.77, SE =.07, p &lt;.001). The relationship between ideology and conspiratorial thinking was mediated by a strong distrust of officialdom and paranoid ideation, both of which were higher among conservatives, consistent with Hofstadter's account of the paranoid style in American politics.","van der Linden, Sander; Panagopoulos, Costas; Azevedo, Flávio; Jost, John T.",Polit.

As many viral infections are associated with neuropathy, the aim of the study is to characterize the incidence and severity of neuropathic pain in patients with COVID-19. Methods: A cohort study will be conducted in adult (&gt;=18 years) patients who were tested for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) at Washington University/Barnes-Jewish Hospital. Participants who are deceased, with incomplete test results, or who cannot be contacted will be excluded. Approximately 1320 participants will be recruited in a 1:2 ratio of those with a positive-to-negative SARS-CoV-2 test result. Each participant will be invited to complete a survey to assess their symptoms related to neuropathy, 30 to 90 days after their initial SARS-CoV-2 test. Survey responses, demographics, and clinical data from the electronic health record will be used for analysis. The primary outcome is the incidence of new symptoms of neuropathic pain. The self-reported DN4 and Neuropathic Pain Symptom Inventory questionnaires (Appendix 1, http://links.lww.com/PR9/A103) will be used for neuropathic pain screening and severity assessment, respectively. Exploratory analyses will be performed to investigate other potential clinical endpoints and trends. Results/Conclusion: Similar to previous coronavirus infections, an increased incidence of new-onset neuropathic pain after COVID-19 disease is expected, along with an increase in the severity experienced by patients with COVID-19 with pre-existing chronic pain. Comprehensive understanding of how COVID-19 affects the nervous system can provide a better framework for managing pain in this disease.","Odozor, C.

The aim of this study was to understand the attitudes towards and obstacles facing vaccination with a potential COVID-19 vaccine. To measure these attitudes a survey was administered to 316 respondents across the United States by a survey corporation. Structural equation modeling was used to analyze the relationships of several factors with attitudes toward potential COVID-19 vaccination. Prior vaccine usage and attitudes predicted attitudes towards COVID-19 vaccination. Assessment of the severity of COVID-19 for the United States was also predictive. Approximately 68% of all respondents were supportive of being vaccinated for COVID-19, but side effects, efficacy and length of testing remained concerns. Longer testing, increased efficacy and development in the United States were significantly associated with increased vaccine acceptance. Messages promoting COVID-19 vaccination should seek to alleviate the concerns of those who are already vaccine-hesitant. Messaging directed at the benefits of vaccination for the United States as a country would address the second predictive factor.

While there is an increase in the usage of cosmetic products, it is concerning whether the consumers are aware of the safety of the products. AIMS: This study aimed to widely explore consumers' perceptions and attitudes toward cosmetics within the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was carried out among adults in Selangor, Malaysia. Thirty-three questions divided into three dimensions (socio-demographic parameters, assessment of perception, and assessment of attitude) were developed and validated to be answered by cosmetics consumers. Descriptive and inferential statistical analysis was done using SPSS. RESULTS: A response rate of 87% was achieved, and the mean age of participants was 33 ± 7.2. The overall perception of consumers indicates low levels of perception and moderate level of attitude toward cosmetic products. There was a positive correlation and high relationship between participants' perception and attitude (p = 0.001, r = 0.72). A significant association was observed between demographic data of respondents and their attitude and perception toward cosmetic products. Participants were unaware that sharing of cosmetic products could lead to bacterial infection and possibly increased the chance of contracting COVID-19. CONCLUSION: This study displayed a nonchalant perception and attitude of Malaysian adults toward cosmetic products by focusing on aesthetics rather than health safety. Therefore, it is recommended to raise awareness on the composition and effects of cosmetic products, increase the practice of hygiene and dissuade the sharing of cosmetics to reduce transmissions of COVID-19.","Mohammed, Ali Haider; Blebil, Ali; Dujaili, Juman; Hassan, Bassam Abdul Rasool",J Cosmet Dermatol,202,20

As of now preventive measures are the sole solution to stop this disease for further transmission from person to person transmissions as there is no effective treatment or vaccine available to date. Research and development of new molecule is a laborious process; therefore, drug repurposing can be an alternative solution that involves the identification of potential compounds from the already available data. Alkaloids are potential source of therapeutic agents which might be able to treat novel COVID-19. Therefore, in the present study, twenty potential alkaloid molecules that possess antiviral activity against different viral diseases have taken into consideration and scrutinized using Lipinski's rule. Then out of twenty compounds seventeen were further selected for docking study. Docking study was performed using Autodock software and the best four molecule which provides maximum negative binding energy was selected for further analysis.

Our study included 56 patients who were died due to COVID-19 as the study group, and 245 patients who were hospitalized and recovered as the control group. The laboratory data of the patients were evaluated from the first blood tests (pre) taken from the first moment of admission to the hospital and the blood tests taken from before the patient's discharge or exitus (post) were evaluated retrospectively. The mean age of the nonsurvivor group was 62.0 ± 15.7 and the mean age of the control group was 54.34 ± 13.03. Age and length of stay are significantly higher in the nonsurvivor group. When comparing the pre- and postvalues of ferritin, according to the two groups separately, there was no significant difference in the control group and a high level of significance was observed in the nonsurvivor group (p < .01). COVID-19 disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 causes high mortality with widespread inflammation and cytokine storm.

The ubiquity of computing and our reliance on it has been accelerated and amplified by the COVID-19 pandemic. From education to work environments to healthcare to defense to entertainment - it is hard to imagine a segment of modern life that is not touched by computing. The security of computers, systems, and applications has been an active area of research in computer science for decades. However, with the confluence of both the scale of interconnected systems and increased adoption of artificial intelligence, there are many research challenges the community must face so that our society can continue to benefit and risks are minimized, not multiplied. Those challenges range from security and trust of the information ecosystem to adversarial artificial intelligence and machine learning. Along with basic research challenges, more often than not, securing a system happens after the design or even deployment, meaning the security community is routinely playing catch-up and attempting to patch vulnerabilities that could be exploited any minute. While security measures such as encryption and authentication have been widely adopted, questions of security tend to be secondary to application capability. There needs to be a sea-change in the way we approach this critically important aspect of the problem: new incentives and education are at the core of this change. Now is the time to refocus research community efforts on developing interconnected technologies with security""baked in by design""and creating an ecosystem that ensures adoption of promising research developments.

The damage it causes to the nervous system is manifold. The main neurological manifestation is anosmia. Olfactory damage is often transient, but there are no data reflecting an observational period of several months. OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated the trend of anosmia in patients affected by coronavirus disease 2019 in the eight months following diagnosis. METHODS: Fifty-five subjects who presented with symptoms suggestive of coronavirus disease 2019 and who developed anosmia, between the end of February and the beginning of March 2020, were investigated. The patients were interviewed after eight months to determine functional recovery and assess the degree of recovery. RESULTS: Ninety-one per cent of the population reported olfactory recovery and, of these, 53 per cent had total recovery after eight months. Females and younger age groups seem slightly advantaged in functional recovery. The elderly population appears to have excellent prospects for full functional recovery. CONCLUSION: Anosmia represents a frequent neurological manifestation during coronavirus disease 2019. Fortunately, it is transient in most cases, and only a small percentage of patients affected by it report long-term functional deficits.","Capelli, M; Gatti, P",J Laryngol Otol,202,1

The immediate effects of a nationwide lockdown were investigated by comparing matched samples of New Zealanders assessed before (Nprelockdown = 1,003) and during the first 18 days of lockdown (Nlockdown = 1,003). Two categories of outcomes were examined: (a) institutional trust and attitudes toward the nation and government and (b) health and well-being. Applying propensity score matching to approximate the conditions of a randomized controlled experiment, the study found that people in the pandemic/lockdown group reported higher trust in science, politicians, and police, higher levels of patriotism, and higher rates of mental distress compared to people in the prelockdown prepandemic group.

Large-scale seroprevalence surveys can better estimate infection across many geographic regions. Objective: To estimate the prevalence of persons with SARS-CoV-2 antibodies using residual sera from commercial laboratories across the US and assess changes over time. Design, Setting, and Participants: This repeated, cross-sectional study conducted across all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico used a convenience sample of residual serum specimens provided by persons of all ages that were originally submitted for routine screening or clinical management from 2 private clinical commercial laboratories. Samples were obtained during 4 collection periods: July 27 to August 13, August 10 to August 27, August 24 to September 10, and September 7 to September 24, 2020. Exposures: Infection with SARS-CoV-2. Main Outcomes and Measures: The proportion of persons previously infected with SARS-CoV-2 as measured by the presence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 by 1 of 3 chemiluminescent immunoassays. Iterative poststratification was used to adjust seroprevalence estimates to the demographic profile and urbanicity of each jurisdiction. Seroprevalence was estimated by jurisdiction, sex, age group (0-17, 18-49, 50-64, and &#8805;65 years), and metropolitan/nonmetropolitan status. Results: Of 177â¯919 serum samples tested, 103â¯771 (58.3%) were from women, 26â¯716 (15.0%) from persons 17 years or younger, 47â¯513 (26.7%) from persons 65 years or older, and 26â¯290 (14.8%) from individuals living in nonmetropolitan areas. Jurisdiction-level seroprevalence over 4 collection periods ranged from less than 1% to 23%. In 42 of 49 jurisdictions with sufficient samples to estimate seroprevalence across all periods, fewer than 10% of people had detectable SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Seroprevalence estimates varied between sexes, across age groups, and between metropolitan/nonmetropolitan areas. Changes from period 1 to 4 were less than 7 percentage points in all jurisdictions and varied across sites. Conclusions and Relevance: This cross-sectional study found that as of September 2020, most persons in the US did not have serologic evidence of previous SARS-CoV-2 infection, although prevalence varied widely by jurisdiction. Biweekly nationwide testing of commercial clinical laboratory sera can play an important role in helping track the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the US.","Bajema, Kristina L; Wiegand, Ryan E; Cuffe, Kendra; Patel, Sadhna V; Iachan, Ronaldo; Lim, Travis; Lee, Adam; Moyse, Davia; Havers, Fiona P; Harding, Lee; Fry, Alicia M; Hall, Aron J; Martin, Kelly; Biel, Marjorie; Deng, Yangyang; Meyer, William A; Mathur, Mohit; Kyle, Tonja; Gundlapalli, Adi V; Thornburg, Natalie J; Petersen, Lyle R; Edens, Chris",JAMA intern. med.

However, as peer support specialists are part of a fast-growing mental health and substance use workforce in innovative integrated care settings, they encounter various challenges in their new roles and tasks. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to explore peer support specialists' experiences regarding employment challenges in integrated mental health and substance use workplace settings in New Hampshire, USA. METHODS: Using experience-based co-design, nonpeer academic researchers co-designed this study with peer support specialists. We conducted a series of focus groups with peer support specialists (N=15) from 3 different integrated mental health and substance use agencies. Audio recordings were transcribed. Data analysis included content analysis and thematic analysis. RESULTS: We identified 90 final codes relating to 6 themes: (1) work role and boundaries, (2) hiring, (3) work-life balance, (4) work support, (5) challenges, and (6) identified training needs. CONCLUSIONS: The shared values of experience-based co-design and peer support specialists eased facilitation between peer support specialists and nonpeer academic researchers, and indicated that this methodology is feasible for nonpeer academic researchers and peer support specialists alike.

The COVID-19 pandemic has predominantly affected adult populations, while children appear to be relatively spared of severe disease. Notwithstanding, paediatric intensive care (PICU) clinicians may already have been influenced by changes in practices of adult ICUs, and these changes may pose unintended consequences to the vulnerable population in the PICU.

Methods: We launched our community-based cohort to assess public perceptions of infectious disease outbreaks in mid-2019. After the first case of COVID-19 was reported in Singapore on 23 January, we launched a series of seven COVID-19 surveys to both existing and regularly enrolled new participants every 2 weeks. As well as sociodemographic properties of the participants, we recorded changing responses to judge awareness of the situation, trust in various information sources and perceived risk. We used multivariable logistic regression models to evaluate associations with perceptions of risk and self-reported adopted frequencies of protective behaviour. Findings: Our cohort of 633 participants provided 2857 unique responses during the seven COVID-19 surveys. Most agreed or strongly agreed that information from official government sources (99.1%; 528/533) and Singapore-based news agencies (97.9%; 522/533) was trustworthy. Trust in government communication was significantly associated with higher perceived threat (odds ratio, OR: 2.2; 95% confidence interval, CI: 1.6-3.0), but inversely associated with perceived risk of infection (OR: 0.6; 95% CI: 0.4-0.8) or risk of death if infected (OR: 0.6; 95% CI: 0.4-0.9). Trust in government communication was also associated with a greater likelihood of adopting protective behaviour.

INTRODUCTION: Worldwide, non-urban populations experience higher levels of disease, mortality, and disease risk factors, yet most health services, including occupational therapy, are disproportionately located in urban areas. Research has predominantly focused on attracting therapists to non-urban practice by exploring generalized expressed needs from existing non-urban therapists, such as access to professional development, backfilling of jobs, peer and other practice supports, or enticing occupational therapy students through placement experiences. However, the types of service that non-urban occupational therapists routinely provide remains unclear. Clarifying the scope of occupational therapy services in non-urban areas will support educators and policy makers to plan curricula and services to support non-urban clinicians and communities.

We have seen the proliferation of statements of solidarity with the Black Lives Matter movement and commitments to fight racism and health inequities from academia, nonprofit organizations, governmental agencies, and private corporations. Actions must now arise from these promises. As public health and EHS scientists, we must examine the systems that produce and perpetuate inequities in exposure to environmental pollutants and associated health effects. OBJECTIVES: We outline five recommendations the EHS research community can implement to confront racism and move our science forward for eliminating racial inequities in environmental health. DISCUSSION: Race is best considered a political label that promotes inequality. Thus, we should be wary of equating race with biology. Further, EHS researchers should seriously consider racism as a plausible explanation of racial disparities in health and consider structural racism as a factor in environmental health risk/impact assessments, as well as multiple explanations for racial differences in environmental exposures and health outcomes. Last, the EHS research community should develop metrics to measure racism and a set of guidelines on the use and interpretation of race and ethnicity within the environmental sciences. Numerous guidelines exist in other disciplines that can serve as models. By taking action on each of these recommendations, we can make significant progress toward eliminating racial disparities. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP8186.","Payne-Sturges, Devon C; Gee, Gilbert C; Cory-Slechta, Deborah A",Environ Health Perspect,202,2

The dynamics of the diseases follows the susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model, where the infection induces faulty behaviors in the agents and affects their state values. To ensure resilient consensus among the noninfectious agents, the difficulty is that the number of infectious agents changes over time. We assume that a high-level policy maker announces the level of infection in realtime, which can be adopted by the agents for their preventative measures. It is demonstrated that this problem can be formulated as resilient consensus in the presence of the socalled mobile malicious models, where the mean subsequence reduced (MSR) algorithms are known to be effective.

The social limitation policy, market disruption, and changes in income may change the state of family food security and altering child CF practices. Besides, infant age, mother education and occupation, information availability, and CF knowledge may also affect the practice. Therefore, we aimed to explore the CF practice and its related factors during the COVID-19 outbreak through an online cross-sectional study of the mothers of children aged 6 to 24 months in Daerah Istimewa Yogyakarta. The results showed that a child's age (P = .019), household food security (P = .006), and mother's CF knowledge (P = .002) had an association with CF practices. We concluded that a child's age, household food security, and mother's CF knowledge are the determinant factors for appropriate CF practices during the outbreak.","Widyaningrum, Rachmawati; Safitri, Rosyida Awalia; Ramadhani, Khairunisa; Suryani, Dyah; Syarief, Firman",Asia Pac J Public Health,202,16

Supportive treatment remains the mainstay of therapy for COVID-19. The World Health Organization reported that four candidate drugs, including remdesivir, are ineffective or have little effect on COVID-19. According to China News, 90 % of Chinese patients with COVID-19 use traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), with an effectiveness rate of 80 %, and no deterioration in patient condition. We have compiled the direct evidence of TCM treatment for COVID-19 as of December 31, 2020. We describe the advantages of TCM in the treatment of COVID-19 based on clinical evidence and the required methods for its clinical use. TCM can inhibit virus replication and transcription, prevent the combination of SARS-CoV-2 and the host, and attenuate the cytokine storm and immune deficiency caused by the virus infection. The cooperation of many countries is required to establish international guidelines regarding the use of TCM in patients with severe COVID-19 from other regions and of different ethnicities. Studies on the psychological abnormalities in patients with COVID-19, and medical staff, is lacking; it is necessary to provide a complete chain of evidence to determine the efficacy of TCM in the related prevention, treatment, and recovery. This study aims to provide a reference for the rational use of TCM in the treatment of COVID-19.","An, Xuedong; Zhang, YueHong; Duan, Liyun; Jin, De; Zhao, Shenghui; Zhou, RongRong; Duan, Yingying; Lian, Fengmei; Tong, Xiaolin",Biomed Pharmacother,202,24

However, little is known about the impact of social media use, unhealthy lifestyles and the risk of miscarriage among pregnant women during the COVID-19 pandemic. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to assess the association between social media use, unhealthy lifestyles and the risk of miscarriage among pregnant women in the early stage of COVID-19 pandemic in China. METHODS: In this prospective cohort study, 456 singleton pregnant women in mainland China were recruited during January and February, 2020. Social-demographic characteristics, history of previous health, social media use, and current lifestyles was collected at baseline and the occurrence of miscarriage was followed up. Log-binomial regression models were used to estimate the risk ratios (RRs) of miscarriage for women with different exposure of COVID-19-specipfic information. RESULTS: Among all the 456 pregnant women, there were 82 (18.0%) without any physical activities, 82 (18.0%) with inadequate dietary diversity, 174 (38.2%) with poor sleep quality, and 54 (11.8%) spending &#8805; 3 hours on reading COVID-19 news per day. Women with excessive media use (&#8805;3h) were more likely to be previous pregnant, never taking physical activities, with inadequate dietary diversity, and poor sleep quality (all P<.05). The prevalence of miscarriage was 16.0% (95% CI: 12.6%-19.4%). Compared with women who spent 0.5-2h (10.1%) on reading COVID-19 news per day, miscarriage prevalence in women who spent <0.5h (21.7%), 2-3h (19.7%) and &#8805;3h (31.5%) were higher (P<.05). Miscarriage prevalence was also higher in pregnant women with poor sleep quality (22.4% vs 12.1%, P<.05) and high educational level (17.9% vs 8.0%, P<.05). In the multivariable model, poor sleep quality (adjusted RR, 2.06; 95% CI: 1.24-3.44), 2-3h media use daily (adjusted RR, 1.74; 95% CI: 1.02-2.97), and &#8805; 3h media use daily (adjusted RR, 2.56; 95% CI: 1.43-4.59) were associated with miscarriage (all P<.05) (all P<.05). In the sensitivity analysis, results were still stable. CONCLUSIONS: Pregnant women with excessive media use were more likely to be never taking physical activities, with inadequate dietary diversity, and poor sleep quality. Excessive media use and poor sleep quality was associated with the higher risk of miscarriage. Our findings highlighted the importance of healthy lifestyles during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Zhang, Xiaotong; Liu, Jue; Han, Na; Yin, Jing",,202,1

In Experiment 2, participants viewed videos of actors making facial expressions, or static images taken from the videos. In Experiment 3, participants viewed videos of moving faces presented in the left or right visual field. Results showed the neural response in Herschel's right occipital face area (OFA) was impaired for moving and static faces (Experiment 1), moving expressions (Experiment 2) and moving faces in the left visual field (Experiment 3). The response in Herschel's right fusiform face area (FFA) to moving and static faces was impaired in Experiment 1 only, in Experiments 2 and 3 Herschel's FFA response was not significantly different from controls. By contrast, the response in Herschel's right posterior superior temporal sulcus (rpSTS) to moving and static faces and expressions (Experiments 1 and 2) and the visual field response (Experiment 3) was not significantly different from control participants.

This environment potentially creates a conducive ground for the hyperinflammatory response mediated by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Therefore, in addition to accepted risk factors such as advanced age, pregnancy and diabetes, obesity is thought to be an important entity predisposing to severe Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and a potentially worse prognosis. The aim of this study is to understand the impact of obesity on the clinical course and outcome of intensive care unit (ICU) patients with COVID-19. Methods All COVID-19 ICU admissions between March 1st and May 31st, 2020 were obtained from our hospital's data base. Patients age &gt;18 years with a positive SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction from a nasopharyngeal swab were included. ICU patients who were admitted for non-respiratory reasons with an incidental positive test result were excluded. Patients were divided into two groups obese: (BMI &gt;/=30) and non-obese (BMI &lt;30). All categorical variables are expressed as frequencies and percentages. Comparisons of categorical variables were performed using Fisher's Exact Test. Continuous variables are expressed as median (IQR). Medians were compared using the Mann-Whitney U-Test. P-value of &lt;0.05 was taken to be statistically significant. The institutional review board of New York Medical College approved this study. Results Of the 210 patients who met our inclusion criteria, 95 patients were obese and 115 were nonobese. Obese patients were significantly younger than their non-obese counterparts (p=0.005). Aside from this, there was no significant difference between the groups in terms of gender, race, baseline comorbidities and severity of illness at the time of ICU admission. Outcomes such as mechanical ventilation, renal replacement therapy, stroke and death were not different between the two groups (Table 1). Conclusion Unlike other studies, ours did not find significant differences in the outcomes of critically ill obese patients with COVID-19. This might be because other authors used a BMI &gt;25 as their cutoff whereas we used BMI &gt;/= 30. Another potential explanation is that in our study, obese patients were younger, a factor which may have neutralized the negative impact of obesity. Our study is limited by sample size and the single center factor but suggests that obesity alone may not significantly affect prognosis although this will need to be confirmed by larger studies.","Macauley, P.; Yaqoob, H.; Manglani, R.; GreenbergMd, D.; Chandy, D.",American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine,202,29

We analyzed the epidemic patterns from March 1 to June 30. There was a progressive drop of cases from March (104,710) to April (94,888), May (25,705) and June (8110). Likewise, after a slight increase of deaths in April (14,804) compared to March (12,396), a considerable decline occurred in May (5170) and June (1464). Doubling times of cumulative cases grew from 2 to 6 days until March 20 to 2 weeks up to April 5, and thereafter no further doubling occurred until June 30. There was a striking North-South gradient of both cases and deaths.

Nurses have been at the centre of this experience managing the outbreak through direct bedside care, managing hospital units, providing Covid-19 testing, and contact tracing. PURPOSE: The aim of this article is to examine the role that nurses played in the early stages of the Covid-19 pandemic through the voices of the participants. METHODS: Using a phenomenological methodology thirty-one interviews were completed via phone and thematic analysis was completed. RESULTS: The major themes that emerged from this phenomenological study were: emotional challenges, uncertainty, and protective factors. Emotional challenges included, stress, anxiety, exhaustion, frustration, guilt, and loneliness. These challenges were magnified by uncertainty through leadership and communication challenges, needs of the pandemic versus needs of the patient, and Covid-19 and best practice. In this study, emotional challenges were mitigated by the protective factors of: education, ability to contribute, team cohesiveness, and community support. CONCLUSIONS: Nurses are challenged during this time but by limiting uncertainty and providing protective factors, nurses can be less affected by emotional challenges and able to provide nursing care and manage the outbreak effectively.","Nelson, Heather; Hubbard Murdoch, Natasha; Norman, Kasandra",Can J Nurs Res,202,16

Reflecting back and looking forward,15.625511,1.6791406,2021,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic was declared in 2020. The shortage of diagnostic tests limited monitoring of the first wave of the pandemic. This study estimates and describes the wave in Navarre (Spain). METHODS: Enhanced epidemiological surveillance, seroepidemiological survey estimates and mortality registries were used to characterise the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic from February to June 2020 in Navarre. RESULTS: A total of 10,358 persons (1.6?% of population) were confirmed with COVID-19, 1,943 cases were hospitalized (3 per 1,000 inhabitants), 139 were admitted to the ICU (21 per 100,000 inhabitants), and 529 people died from confirmed COVID-19 (80 per 100,000). Mortality increased exponentially with age, exceeding 1?% in people over 85 years. 58?% of deaths occurred amongst nursing home residents. The mortality registry received reporting of 733 confirmed or probable COVID-19 deaths, while the excess deaths during this period were 613 (20.9?%) concentrated from mid-March to the end of April. It is estimated that, at the end of June, 6.7?% (n?=?44,000) of the population had detectable antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 and 10.3?% had had the infection. The estimates of SARS-CoV-2 infection incidence increased sharply in the first half of March and decreased quickly during the home lockdown in the second half of March. CONCLUSIONS: The first wave of the pandemic produced a high number of cases, hospitalizations and deaths in Navarre in a few weeks. The pronounced decrease of SARS-CoV-2 infections during the home lockdown suggests considerable efficacy and impact of this measure for transmission control.","Castilla, J; Moreno-Iribas, C; Ibero Esparza, C; Martínez-Baz, I; Trobajo-Sanmartín, C; Ezpeleta, C; Guevara, M; En Navarra, Grupo Para El Estudio de Covid-",An. sist. sanit.

The disease and the interventions both impose costs and harm on society. Some interventions with particularly high costs may only be implemented briefly. The design of optimal policy requires consideration of many intervention scenarios. In this paper we investigate the optimal timing of interventions that are not sustainable for a long period. Specifically, we look at at the impact of a single short-term non-repeated intervention (a ""one-shot intervention"") on an epidemic and consider the impact of the intervention's timing. To minimize the total number infected, the intervention should start close to the peak so that there is minimal rebound once the intervention is stopped. To minimise the peak prevalence, it should start earlier, leading to initial reduction and then having a rebound to the same prevalence as the pre-intervention peak rather than one very large peak. To delay infections as much as possible (as might be appropriate if we expect improved interventions or treatments to be developed), earlier interventions have clear benefit. In populations with distinct subgroups, synchronized interventions are less effective than targeting the interventions in each subcommunity separately.","Di Lauro, Francesco; Kiss, István Z; Miller, Joel C",PLoS Comput Biol,202,1

Problems from a dysfunctional costing model in hospital operating systems were magnified by a very large demand shock triggered by acute need in healthcare and panicked marketplace behavior that depleted domestic PPE inventories. The lack of effective action on the part of the federal government to maintain and distribute domestic inventories, as well as severe disruptions to the PPE global supply chain, amplified the problem. Analysis of trade data shows that the US is the world's largest importer of face masks, eye protection, and medical gloves, making it highly vulnerable to disruptions in exports of medical supplies. We conclude that market prices are not appropriate mechanisms for rationing inputs to health because health is a public good. Removing the profit motive for purchasing PPE in hospital costing models, strengthening government capacity to maintain and distribute stockpiles, developing and enforcing regulations, and pursuing strategic industrial policy to reduce US dependence on imported PPE will help to better protect healthcare workers with adequate supplies of PPE.","Cohen, Jennifer; Rodgers, Yana van der Meulen",Prev Med,202,20

In addition, it will be demonstrated which performance measures can be used for diagnostic tests with binary results, the properties of these measures and how to interpret them. Materials and Methods: The evaluation of the diagnostic test performance measures may differ depending on whether the test result is numerical or binary. When the diagnostic test result is continuous numerical data, ROC analysis is often utilized. The performance of a diagnostic test with binary results are usually evaluated using the measures of sensitivity and specificity. However, there are some important measures other than these two measures for binary test results. These measures are predictive values, overall accuracy, diagnostic odds ratio, Youden index, and likelihood ratios. Results: A hypothetical data has been produced based on the studies conducted on the performance of rapid tests (Specific IgM/IgG) according to the RT-PCR test for Covid 19 in the literature. An example of a diagnostic test (Specific IgM/IgG) with a binary result is given and all measurements and their confidence interval are obtained for this data. The performance of rapid test was examined and interpreted. Conclusion: It is important to design and evaluate the performance of diagnostic/screening tests for health care. In this review, some basic definitions, performance measures that can be used only in evaluating the diagnostic tests with binary results and their confidence intervals are mentioned. Having many different measures provides different interpretations in the evaluation of test performance. Accurately predicting the performance of a diagnostic test depends on many factors. These factors can be study design, criteria of participant selection, sample size calculation, test methods etc. There are guidelines that ensure that all information regarding the conditions under which the study was conducted is in report, in terms of such factors. Therefore, these guidelines are recommended for use of the checklist by many publishers.","Karakaya, J.",Turkish Journal of Biochemistry-Turk Biyokimya Dergisi,202,16

Alveolar macrophage-derived cytokines contribute to the inflammation underlying pulmonary disease in COVID-19. We sought to determine if basal macrophage activation, as a risk factor for COVID-19 infection, was present in PCOS and, if so, was further enhanced by vitamin D deficiency. Methods: A cross-sectional study in 99 PCOS and 68 control women who presented sequentially. Plasma levels of a macrophage-derived cytokine panel were determined by Slow Off-rate Modified Aptamer (SOMA)-scan plasma protein measurement. Vitamin D was measured by tandem mass spectroscopy. Results: Vitamin D was lower in PCOS women (p<0.0001) and correlated negatively with body mass index (BMI) in PCOS (r=0.28, p=0.0046). Basal macrophage activation markers CXCL5, CD163 and MMP9 were elevated, whilst protective CD200 was decreased (p<0.05); changes in these variables were related to, and fully accounted for, by BMI. PCOS and control women were then stratified according to vitamin D concentration. Vitamin D deficiency was associated with decreased CD80 and IFN-Î³ in PCOS and IL-12 in both groups (p<0.05). These factors, important in initiating and maintaining the immune response, were again accounted for by BMI. Conclusion: Basal macrophage activation was higher in PCOS with macrophage changes related with increased infection risk associating with vitamin D; all changes were BMI dependent, suggesting that obese PCOS with vitamin D deficiency may be at greater risk of more severe COVID-19 infection, but that it is obesity-related rather than an independent PCOS factor.","Moin, Abu Saleh Md; Sathyapalan, Thozhukat; Butler, Alexandra E; Atkin, Stephen L",Front Endocrinol (Lausanne),202,1

Unlike many extant arguments for restricting, curtailing, or even eliminating intensive animal agriculture which focus on environmental harms, animal welfare, or the link between animal source food (ASF) consumption and noncommunicable disease, the argument in this article appeals to the value of protecting populations from future global health emergencies and their broad social, economic, and health impacts, taking the SARS-CoV-2 virus as a particularly salient example. The article begins by identifying how intensive animal agriculture contributes to the outbreak (and risk of future outbreaks) of zoonotic diseases. Next, we explore three specific policy options: 1. Incentivizing plant-based and cell-based ASF alternatives through government subsidies;2. Disincentivizing intensive ASF production through the adoption of a ""zoonotic tax"";and 3. Eliminating intensive ASF production through a total ban. We argue that all three of these measures are permissible, although we remain agnostic as to whether these measures are obligatory. We argue for this conclusion on the grounds that each measure is justified by the same sorts of considerations that justify other widely accepted public health interventions, and each is compatible with a variety of theories of justice. We then address potential objections. Finally, we discuss how our novel argument relates to extant ethical arguments in favor or curtailing ASF production and consumption.","Bernstein, J.; Dutkiewicz, J.",Food Ethics,202,30

This study aimed to investigate the contributions of lockdown conditions to individuals' overall health status using blood indices as biological markers. During lockdown, people are limited to confined spaces, have access to limited nutritional supply options, experience increased stress, and are exposed to other environmental factors. Methods: Our study's target population included all outpatients who were severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-negative and requested CBC assessments as part of their routine health checks. A total of 2414 CBC results were included, covering a period from February 2019 to December 2020. The average of different blood indices during the COVID-19 lockdown was compared to the 10-month period preceding the lockdown. Results: The average counts of RBCs, hemoglobin, and hematocrit showed a significant increase during the lockdown period, which lasted from May 2020 to September 2020. Reductions were observed for the RBC distribution width, total white blood cell count, platelets, and platelet distribution width. Conclusion: Our findings suggested that the overall health status of individuals improved during the lockdown period in the short term, but health status might be adversely affected under these conditions of a longer period. Both RDW and PDW could be used as indicators for the overall health status when assessed against other blood indices.","Suliman, B. A.",Journal of Blood Medicine,202,12

Here, we present an extremely rare case of late phytobezoar formation following laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG). CASE PRESENTATION: A 52-year-old woman with a body mass index (BMI) of 40.7 kg/m2 underwent LSG. Following persistent symptoms of nausea, vomiting, early satiety, and tremendous weight loss, endoscopy was performed, and gastric phytobezoar was detected at one-year post-operation. After endoscopic fragmentation, phytobezoar was removed by snare, and the patient later underwent redo bariatric surgery (conversion of LSG to LRYGB). CONCLUSIONS: With an increase in the number of LSG procedures performed globally, and the late-onset nature of phytobezoar formation, more cases of this complication are expected to be detected in future. Long-term postoperative follow-up alongside applying surgical methods to avoid gastric stenosis are needed to reduce the chance of phytobezoar formation in patients undergoing LSG.","Aryannezhad, Shayan; Sadeghian, Yasaman; Shapoori, Parvin; Valizadeh, Majid; Barzin, Maryam",BMC Surg,202,3

Nucleocapsid protein (N protein) is highly conserved and the most abundant protein in coronaviruses and thus a potential target for both vaccine and point-of-care diagnostics. N Protein has been suggested in the literature as having post-translational modifications (PTMs), and accurately defining these PTMs is critical for its potential use in medicine. Reports of phosphorylation of N protein have failed to provide detailed site-specific information. We have performed comprehensive glycomics, glycoproteomics and proteomics experiments on two different N protein preparations. Both were expressed in HEK293 cells, one was in-house expressed and purified without a signal peptide sequence and the other was commercially produced with a signal peptide channeling it through the secretory pathway. Our results show completely different PTMs on the two N protein preparations. The commercial product contained extensive N- and O-linked glycosylation, as well as O-phosphorylation on site Thr393. Conversely, the native N Protein model had O-phosphorylation at Ser176 and no glycosylation, highlighting the importance of knowing the provenance of any commercial protein to be used for scientific or clinical studies. Recent studies have indicated that N protein can serve as an important diagnostic marker for coronavirus disease and as a major immunogen by priming protective immune responses. Thus, detailed structural characterization of N protein may provide useful insights for understanding the roles of PTMs on viral pathogenesis, vaccine design and development point-of-care diagnostics.","Supekar, Nitin T; Shajahan, Asif; Gleinich, Anne S; Rouhani, Daniel S; Heiss, Christian; Chapla, Digantkumar Gopaldas; Moremen, Kelley W; Azadi, Parastoo",Glycobiology,202,16

Preliminary cross-sectional research has demonstrated increases in mental health problems in mothers during the COVID-19 pandemic compared with pre-pandemic estimates. We aimed to study an existing longitudinal cohort of mothers to assess changes in the prevalence of maternal depression and anxiety symptoms as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic over time and at the individual level. METHODS: In this longitudinal observational study, women who took part in the All Our Families pregnancy cohort in Canada were invited to complete a COVID-19 impact survey between May 20 and July 15, 2020. Women who had not agreed to additional research, had discontinued, were lost to follow-up, or who were not contactable via email were excluded. Maternal depression and anxiety symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic were compared with three previous estimates collected at 3, 5, and 8-year timepoints (between April, 2012, and October, 2019). Depression symptoms were assessed using the 10-item Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression scale and anxiety symptoms were assessed using the short form of the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory. Repeated cross-sectional analyses were done to assess temporal trends and fixed-effects regression models were fitted to assess within-person change over time. FINDINGS: Of the 3387 women included in the All Our Families study, 2445 women were eligible and were invited to participate in the COVID-19 impact study, of whom 1333 consented to participate, and 1301 were included in the longitudinal analysis. At the COVID-19 impact survey timepoint, a higher proportion of mothers had clinically significant depression (35·21%, 95% CI 32·48-38·04) and anxiety symptoms (31·39%, 28·76-34·15) than at all previous data collection timepoints. The mean depression score (8·31, 95% CI 7·97-8·65) and anxiety score (11·90, 11·66-12·13) at the COVID-19 pandemic timepoint were higher than previous data collection waves at the 3-year timepoint (mean depression score 5·05, 4·85-5·25; mean anxiety score 9·51, 9·35-9·66), 5-year timepoint (mean depression score 5·43, 5·20-5·66; mean anxiety score 9·49, 9·33-9·65), and 8-year timepoint (mean depression score 5·79, 5·55-6·02; mean anxiety score 10·26, 10·10-10·42). For the within-person comparisons, depression scores were a mean of 2·30 points (95% CI 1·95-2·65) higher and anxiety scores were a mean of 1·04 points (0·65-1·43) higher at the COVID-19 pandemic timepoint, after controlling for time trends. Larger increases in depression and anxiety symptoms were observed for women who had income disruptions, difficulty balancing home schooling with work responsibilities, and those with difficulty obtaining childcare. White mothers had greater increases in anxiety scores than non-white mothers and health-care workers had smaller increases in depressive symptoms than non-health-care workers. INTERPRETATION: Compared with previous estimates, the prevalence of maternal depression and anxiety among mothers in a Canadian cohort increased during the COVID-19 pandemic. Financial support, childcare provision, and avoiding the closure of schools, might be key priorities for preventing future increases in maternal psychological distress.

To do so, 513 consecutive adult patients suspected of having COVID-19 from 15 emergency departments from 2020-03-13 to 2020-04-14 were included as long as chest CT-scans and real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) results were available (244 [47.6%] with a positive RT-PCR). Immediately after their acquisition, the chest CTs were prospectively interpreted by on-call teleradiologists (OCTRs) and systematically reviewed within one week by another senior teleradiologist. Each OCTR reading was concluded using a 5-point scale: normal, non-infectious, infectious non-COVID-19, indeterminate and highly suspicious of COVID-19. The senior reading reported the lesions' semiology, distribution, extent and differential diagnoses. After pre-filtering clinical and radiological features through univariate Chi-2, Fisher or Student t-tests (as appropriate), multivariate stepwise logistic regression (Step-LR) and classification tree (CART) models to predict a positive RT-PCR were trained on 412 patients, validated on an independent cohort of 101 patients and compared with the OCTR performances (295 and 71 with available clinical data, respectively) through area under the receiver operating characteristics curves (AUC). Regarding models elaborated on radiological variables alone, best performances were reached with the CART model (i.e., AUC = 0.92 [versus 0.88 for OCTR], sensitivity = 0.77, specificity = 0.94) while step-LR provided the highest AUC with clinical-radiological variables (AUC = 0.93 [versus 0.86 for OCTR], sensitivity = 0.82, specificity = 0.91). Hence, these two simple models, depending on the availability of clinical data, provided high performances to diagnose positive RT-PCR and could be used by any radiologist to support, modulate and communicate their conclusion in case of COVID-19 suspicion. Practically, using clinical and radiological variables (GGO, fever, presence of fibrotic bands, presence of diffuse lesions, predominant peripheral distribution) can accurately predict RT-PCR status.","Schuster, Paul; Crombé, Amandine; Nivet, Hubert; Berger, Alice; Pourriol, Laurent; Favard, Nicolas; Chazot, Alban; Alonzo-Lacroix, Florian; Youssof, Emile; Cheikh, Alexandre Ben; Balique, Julien; Porta, Basile; Petitpierre, François; Bouquet, Grégoire; Mastier, Charles; Bratan, Flavie; Bergerot, Jean-François; Thomson, Vivien; Banaste, Nathan; Gorincour, Guillaume",Sci Rep,202,22

METHODS: Between 2016 and 2018, 49 patients with postoperative symptoms were treated by laparoscopic surgery at our institute. The data from two preoperative examinations were available for 42 patients. The patients were divided into 4 groups: CT-positive (CP, n = 18), barium follow-through-positive (BP, n = 1), both positive (AP [all positive] n = 13), and both negative (AN [all negative], n = 10). RESULTS: Among the 49 patients, 41 received pure laparoscopic surgery, 7 received laparoscopic-assisted surgery with mini-laparotomy, and 1 required conversion. Intra- and postoperative complications occurred in two and seven patients, respectively. Improvement of abdominal symptoms was observed in 40 patients. In terms of the medium-term outcomes, the rate of improvement of symptoms was poorer in the AN group than in the other three groups, but not to a significant degree. CONCLUSION: Laparoscopic surgery was safe and feasible for patients with chronic recurrent abdominal symptoms, including SBO. Furthermore, in patients with negative results on both preoperative examinations, laparoscopic surgery may yield only poor improvement of symptoms.","Yahagi, Masashi; Ishii, Yoshiyuki; Ochiai, Hiroki; Sako, Hiroyuki; Maeda, Hinako; Takemura, Yusuke; Oka, Taishu; Soutome, Keiichi; Kamiya, Noriki; Watanabe, Masahiko",Surg. today,202,6

Data are urgently needed to select assays with optimal sensitivity at acceptable specificity for antibody detection. METHODS: A comparative evaluation was performed of 7 commercial SARS-CoV-2 serology assays on 171 sera from 135 subjects with polymerase chain reaction-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (71 hospitalized patients and 64 paucisymptomatic individuals). Kinetics of IgA/IgM/IgG seroconversion to viral N and S protein epitopes were studied from 0 to 54 days after onset of symptoms. Cross-reactivity was verified on 57 prepandemic samples. RESULTS: Wantai SARS-COV-2 Ab ELISA and Orient Gene COVID-19 IgG/IgM Rapid Test showed superior overall sensitivity for detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 assay and EUROIMMUN Anti-SARS-CoV-2 combined IgG/IgA showed acceptable sensitivity (>95%) vs the consensus result of all assays from 10 days post onset of symptoms. Wantai SARS-COV-2 Ab ELISA, Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 assay, and Innovita 2019-nCoV Ab rapid test showed least cross-reactivity, resulting in an optimal analytical specificity greater than 98%.

RECENT FINDINGS: To address barriers to care created by the COVID-19 pandemic, regulatory agencies and payors waived longstanding restrictions, which enabled rapid expansion of telemedicine across the country. Preliminary data show that providers and persons with HIV (PWH) view telemedicine favorably. Some data suggest telemedicine has facilitated retention in care, but other studies have found increasing numbers of PWH lost to follow-up and worsened virologic suppression rates despite offering video and/or telephone visits. The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated gaps in the HIV care continuum. To help mitigate the impact, most clinics have adopted new virtual care options and are now evaluating usage, impact, and concerns.

From May 2020 a significant decline of the epidemic has been observed (phase 2); National Health Service protocols permitted elective BMS' resumption. A new, more severe COVID-19 surge, the ""second wave"", started on October 2020 (phase 3). AIM: The primary end point was to analyze the outcomes of any Sars-Cov-2 infection and related morbidity/mortality within 30 POD after laparoscopic BMS during phase 2-3; secondary end points were readmission and reoperation rates. METHODS: Study design prospective, multicenter, observational. SETTING: Eight Italian high-volume bariatric centers. All patients undergoing BMS from July 2020 through January 2021 were enrolled according to the following criteria: no Sars-Cov-2 infection; primary procedures; no concomitant procedure; age > 18 < 60 years; compensated comorbidities; informed consent including COVID-19 addendum; adherence to specific admission, in-hospital and follow-up protocols. Data were collected in a prospective database. Patients undergone BMS during July-December 2019 were considered a control group. RESULTS: 1258 patients were enrolled and compared with 1451 operated on in 2019, with no differences for demographics, complications, readmission, and reintervention rates. Eight patients (0·6%) tested positive for Sars-Cov-2 infection after discharge, as well as and 15 healthcare professionals, with no related complications or mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Introduction of strict COVID-19 protocols concerning the protection of patients and health-care professionals guaranteed a safe resumption of elective BMS in Italy. The safety profile was, also, maintained during the second wave of outbreak, thus allowing access to a cure for the obese population.","Silecchia, Gianfranco; Boru, Cristian E; M Marinari, Giuseppe; Gentileschi, Paolo; Morino, Mario; Olmi, Stefano; Foletto, Mirto; Bernante, Paolo; Morganti, Riccardo; Tascini, Carlo; Anselmino, Marco; Bianciardi, Emanuela; Campanelli, Michela; Fiorello, Luigi; Mancini, Rudj; Oldani, Alberto; Rottoli, Matteo; Salzano, Antonio; Trotta, Manuela",Diabetes Res Clin Pract,202,1

Here, we report the isolation of a MERS-related coronavirus, Tylonycteris-bat-CoV-HKU4, from lesser bamboo bats. Tylonycteris-bat-CoV-HKU4 replicates efficiently in human colorectal adenocarcinoma and hepatocarcinoma cells with cytopathic effects, and can utilize human-dipeptidyl-peptidase-4 and dromedary camel-dipeptidyl-peptidase-4 as the receptors for cell entry. Flow cytometry, co-immunoprecipitation and surface plasmon resonance assays show that Tylonycteris-bat-CoV-HKU4-receptor-binding-domain can bind human-dipeptidyl-peptidase-4, dromedary camel-dipeptidyl-peptidase-4, and Tylonycteris pachypus-dipeptidyl-peptidase-4.

To reach the spatiotemporal understanding of epidemics, we have developed Haplotype Explorer. In Haplotype Explorer, users can explore the network interactively with metadata like accession number, locations, and collection dates. Time dependent transition of the network can be exported as continuous sections for making a movie. Here, we introduce features and products of Haplotype Explorer, demonstrating time-dependent snapshots and a movie of haplotype networks inferred from total of 4,282 SARS-CoV-2 genomes. ABSTRACT: The worldwide eruption of COVID-19 that began in Wuhan, China in late 2019 reached 10 million cases by late June 2020. In order to understand the epidemiological landscape of the COVID-19 pandemic, many studies have attempted to elucidate phylogenetic relationships between collected viral genome sequences using haplotype networks. However, currently available applications for network visualization are not suited to understand the COVID-19 epidemic spatiotemporally due to functional limitations, that motivated us to develop Haplotype Explorer, an intuitive tool for visualizing and exploring haplotype networks. Haplotype Explorer enables to dissect epidemiological consequences via interactive node filters and provides the perspective on infectious disease dynamics depend on regions and time, such as introduction, outbreak, expansion, and containment. Here, we demonstrate the effectiveness of Haplotype Explorer by showing features and an example of visualization. The demo using SARS-CoV-2 genomes are available at https://github.com/TKSjp/HaplotypeExplorer/blob/master/Example/. There are several examples using SARS-CoV-2 genomes and Dengue virus serotype 1 E-genes sequence.","Kawano-Sugaya, Tetsuro; Yatsu, Koji; Sekizuka, Tsuyoshi; Itokawa, Kentaro; Hashino, Masanori; Tanaka, Rina; Kuroda, Makoto",G3 (Bethesda Md.),202,1

The growing amount of both human-created waste in seas and oceans and waste reaching marine ecosystems from land is one of today's challenges for the global economy and the European Union. It is predicted that if no decisive steps are taken to limit the amount of this type of waste, there may be more plastic waste than fish in the oceans after 2050. The influence of microplastics and nanoplastics on living organisms remains undiagnosed. Within the international and EU law, solutions are being developed to properly manage waste on board ships and to reduce the impact of processes related to the recycling of the vessels on the environment. Currently, over 80% of ships are dismantled in the countries of South Asia, in conditions that threaten the environment and the safety of workers. After World War 2, large quantities of chemical weapons were deposited in the seas. Steel containers with dangerous substances residing in the sea for over 70 years have begun leaking, thus polluting water. For many years, radioactive waste had also been dumped into marine ecosystems, although since 1993 there has been a total ban on such disposal of radionuclides. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on marine waste generation has also been presented as a significant factor influencing marine waste generation and management.","Dabrowska, Jolanta; Sobota, Marcin; Swiader, Malgorzata; Borowski, Pawel; Moryl, Andrzej; Stodolak, Radoslaw; Kucharczak, Ewa; Zieba, Zofia; Kazak, Jan K",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),202,27

In this study, we investigate whether clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP), a common aging-related process that predisposes various inflammatory responses, may exert COVID-19 severity. We examine the clinical impact of CHIP in 143 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients. Both stratified analyses and logistic regression including the interaction between canonical risk factors and CHIP show that CHIP is an independent risk factor for severe COVID-19, especially in previously healthy patients. Analyses of 60,310 single-cell immune transcriptome profiles identify distinct immunological signatures for CHIP (+) severe COVID-19 patients, particularly in classical monocytes, with a marked increase in pro-inflammatory cytokine responses and potent IFN-{gamma} mediated hyperinflammation signature. We further demonstrate that the enhanced expression of CHIP (+) specific IFN-{gamma} response genes is attributed to the CHIP mutation-dependent epigenetic reprogramming of poised or bivalent cis-regulatory elements. Our results highlight a unique immunopathogenic mechanism of CHIP in the progression of severe COVID-19, which could be extended to elucidate how CHIP contributes to a variety of human infectious diseases.","Kang, Chang Kyung; Choi, Baekgyu; Kim, Sugyeong; Park, Seongwan; Yoon, Soon Ho; Lee, Dohoon; Lee, Andrew; Ko, Yuji; Chang, Euijin; Jung, Jongtak; Choe, Pyoeng Gyun; Park, Wan Beom; Kim, Eu Suk; Kim, Hong Bin; Kim, Nam Joong; Oh, Myoung-don; Kim, Sun; Im, Hogune; Kim, Joohae; Kang, Kyuho; Kang, Suk-Jo; Lee, Yong Hoon; Lee, Jaehee; Lee, Ji Yeon; Moon, Joon Ho; Song, Kyoung-Ho; Koh, Youngil; Jung, Inkyung",,202,21

The manifestations of COVID-19 are widely variable and range from asymptomatic infection to multi-organ failure and death. Like other viral illnesses, acute myocarditis has been reported to be associated with COVID-19 infection. However, guidelines for the diagnosis of COVID-19 myocarditis have not been established. METHODS: Using a combination of search terms in the PubMed/Medline, Ovid Medline and the Cochrane Library databases and manual searches on Google Scholar and the bibliographies of articles identified, we reviewed all cases reported in the English language citing myocarditis associated with COVID-19 infection. RESULTS: Fourteen records comprising a total of fourteen cases that report myocarditis/myopericarditis secondary to COVID-19 infection were identified. There was a male predominance (58%), with the median age of the cases described being 50.4 years. The majority of patients did not have a previously identified comorbid condition (50%), but of those with a past medical history, hypertension was most prevalent (33%). Electrocardiogram findings were variable, and troponin was elevated in 91% of cases. Echocardiography was performed in 83% of cases reduced function was identified in 60%. Endotracheal intubation was performed in the majority of cases. Glucocorticoids were most commonly used in treatment of myocarditis (58%). Majority of patients survived to discharge (81%) and 85% of those that received steroids survived to discharge. CONCLUSION: Guidelines for diagnosis and management of COVID-19 myocarditis have not been established and our knowledge on management is rapidly changing. The use of glucocorticoids and other agents including IL-6 inhibitors, IVIG and colchicine in COVID-19 myocarditis is debatable. In our review, there appears to be favorable outcomes related to myocarditis treated with steroid therapy. However, until larger scale studies are conducted, treatment approaches have to be made on an individualized case-by-case basis.","Sawalha, Khalid; Abozenah, Mohammed; Kadado, Anis John; Battisha, Ayman; Al-Akchar, Mohammad; Salerno, Colby; Hernandez-Montfort, Jaime; Islam, Ashequl M",Cardiovasc. revasc. med,202,16

As there usually is a delay between infection and positive RT-PCR test results, the initial decision was to perform additional testing. However, the patient deteriorated quickly in spite of optimal medical therapy making urgent aortic valve replacement necessary. We decided to perform transcatheter aortic valve replacement to avoid cardiopulmonary bypass with shorter operative times, presumably shorter ventilation times and duration of intensive care unit stay, and thus a lesser risk for pulmonary complications.","Bauernschmitt, Robert; Gabriel, Philip; Gottardi, Roman; Sodian, Ralf",Eur J Cardiothorac Surg,202,21

OBJECTIVE: A quasi-experimental, mixed methods approach was used to examine the rates of visit completion as well as the opinions and experiences of participants enrolled in an ongoing clinical trial of smoking cessation who were required to change from in-person clinic visits to remote visits using video or telephone conferencing due to the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: For quantitative comparisons, we used a quasi-experimental design, comparing a cohort of participants followed during the pandemic (n=23, COVID-19 cohort) to a comparable cohort of participants followed over a similar time period in the calendar years 2018 and 2019 (n=51, pre-COVID-19 cohort) to examine the rates of completion of scheduled visits and biospecimen collection. For the qualitative component, interviews were conducted with participants who experienced the transition from in-person to remote visits. RESULTS: Participants in the COVID-19 cohort completed an average of 83.6% of remote clinic visits (95% CI 73.1%-91.2%), which was not significantly different than the in-person completion rate of 89.8% in the pre-COVID-19 cohort. Participants in the COVID-19 cohort returned an average of 93.2% (95% CI 83.5%-98.1%) of saliva specimens for remote clinic visits completed, which was not significantly different than the in-person saliva specimen completion rate of 100% in the pre-COVID-19 cohort. Two broad themes emerged from the qualitative data: (1) the benefits of remote visits and (2) the challenges of remote counseling compared to in-person counseling. Despite limited experience with telehealth prior to this transition, most participants expressed a willingness to engage in remote visits in the future. CONCLUSIONS: Even in the context of a rapid transition from in-person to remote visits necessitated by the COVID-19 pandemic, rates of visit completion and return of biospecimens remained high. Participants were generally accepting of the transition. Further research is needed to identify the optimal mix of in-person and remote visits beyond the pandemic context and to better understand how these changes may impact study outcomes.

We highlight innovative solutions ophthalmic educators implemented for medical students, residents, and fellows. RECENT FINDINGS: Clinical and surgical ophthalmology volume abruptly decreased in March 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 public health crisis. All didactics, grand rounds, and journal clubs shifted to an online format. Ophthalmic educators collaborated with other institutions in the United States and abroad on shared virtual curricula and seminars, and simulation-based training tools were better emphasized for surgical skill acquisition. We share the latest literature written by ophthalmic educators on successful adaptation of these new instructional strategies.

Besides, we all learned very well that the disposable biochips, to be used in these in vitro diagnostic (IVD) testing systems, supposed to be produced in large amounts in a very short time to be widely available for the use of humanity to save more and more lives. That is why; roll-to-roll (R2R) polymer structuring manners offer such large quantities for the production of in vitro biochips. Our technology, based on R2R UV nanoimprint lithography (UV-NIL), has superior features. Via our pilot line, robust 7500 biochip components per 100 meter of a flexible, polymer foil coated with a UV curable photo-resin (i.e., parts with capillary fluidic channels or optical structures for IVDs) can be generated. This study shows an example of a prototype of a R2R UV-NIL generated chip: a foil, capillary flow-based IVD biochip for multiplexed DNA detection purposes (i.e., a Lab-on-a-Foil device). The biochip performance was further increased dramatically by integrating UV-NIL produced retro-reflective microstructures, which reflects the light back, to its design to enhance optical signal detection in a commercial IVD device, detecting DNA on a chemiluminescent-reaction basis.","Toren, Pelin; Proksch, Andreas; Smolka, Martin; Haase, Anja; Nees, Dieter; Ruttloff, Stephan; Goetz, Johannes; Wolf, Christian; Hierschlager, Bettina; Katzmayr, Ingo; Sonnleitner, Max; Stadlober, Barbara; Hesse, Jan",MRS Adv,202,26

On March 9th, the Italian population was forced to lockdown to prevent the spread of this new virus. This event forced families and cohabitants to spend their entire days and weeks in the same physical space, interacting with partners and children with a very different degree of intimacy than in the earlier situation. The present study investigated the effects of being forced to live together on different family patterns, on various dimensions such as stress, coping strategies, time perception and quality evaluation of cohabitation. METHOD: A total sample consisting of 1750 individuals was recruited through a random sample of probability across the Italian country. Due to the lockdown condition, an online questionnaire was set up; several validated scales were chosen, and some open-ended items were included for the thoughts of the participants. RESULTS: The results showed statistically significant differences between the three family patterns examined. CONCLUSION: During the forced period of living together, a positive effect could be inferred as given by the presence of children and the collaborative coping strategies that have been adopted; the results have been discussed according to the literature on the topic.","Mari, Emanuela; Fraschetti, Angelo; Lausi, Giulia; Pizzo, Alessandra; Baldi, Michela; Paoli, Elena; Giannini, Anna Maria; Avallone, Francesco",,202,24

Silicosis increases their risk of tuberculosis (TB), exacerbated by the HIV epidemic. Work-related factors are likely to increase transmission, severity, and post infection sequelae of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Understanding these relationships is important to control the impact of the epidemic. RECENT FINDINGS: SARS-CoV-2 infection rates among mineworkers exceed the population rates in the provinces in which those mines are located. Migrant work, living in crowded hostels, working in narrow poorly ventilated shafts mainly underground constitute important factors that increase transmission risk. Mineworkers continue to experience high levels of silica exposure. The prevalences of silicosis, HIV and pulmonary TB, remain high. Interstitial lung disease, pulmonary TB, and HIV have all been associated with poorer outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infections. Mineworkers with post infection respiratory sequelae are likely to lose their jobs or lose income, due to the physically demanding nature of underground minework. SUMMARY: Further research into the unique work-related risk factors in mining that influence the COVID-19 epidemic is crucial for optimizing current interventions. Reducing SARS-CoV-2 infection transmission, health monitoring of infected and vulnerable workers, and following up of postinfection outcomes is essential to protect the respiratory health of miners.","Naidoo, Rajen N; Jeebhay, Mohamed F",Curr Opin Pulm Med,202,22

Viral epidemiology of RTIs in adults has been less studied compared to children. FilmArray respiratory panel (FA-RP), a multiplex, real time polymerase chain reaction method can simultaneously detect the nucleic acids of multiple pathogens. The purpose of this study is to analyze the epidemiology and clinical presentations of an RTI cohort. Methods This retrospective cohort study was conducted at China Medical University Hospital (CMUH) and China Medical University Children’s Hospital (CMUCH), from January 2020 to June 2020. The FA-RP results were collected and analyzed according to upper versus lower RTIs. Results Among 253 respiratory samples tested, 135 (53.4%) were from adults and 118 (46.6%) from children. A total positive rate of 33.9% (86/253) was found, with 21.48% (29/135) in adults and 48.31% (57/118) in children. Human rhinovirus/Enterovirus (HRV/EV) was detected in most of the age groups and was more common in URIs. HRV/EV was found as a frequent co-detection virus. Among children, HRV/EV was the most detected pathogen of URIs, while the most predominant pathogen in LRIs was M. pneumoniae. Conclusions FA-RP has the potential to improve the detection rate of respiratory pathogens. The positive rate of FA-RP was higher in children compared to adults, which likely corresponds to the higher incidence of viral RTIs in children. Different pathogens may lead to different types of respiratory infections.","Chiu, Yu-ting Tien Ni Lin Hsiao-Chuan Wei Hsiu-Mei Lai Huan-Cheng Chen Jiun-An Low Yan-Yi Lin Hsiu-Hsien Hsu Yu-Lung Hwang Kao-Pin","Journal of microbiology, immunology, and infection = Wei mian yu gan ran za zhi",202,33

A rapid screening tool using this mutation is important for surveillance during the COVID-19 pandemic. We developed and validated a single nucleotide polymorphism real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction assay using allelic discrimination of the spike gene N501Ymutation to screen for potential variants of concern and differentiate them from wild-type SARS-CoV-2. A total of 160 clinical specimens positive for SARS-CoV-2 were characterized as mutant (N501Y) or wild-type by Sanger sequencing and were subsequently tested with the N501Y single nucleotide polymorphism real time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction assay. Our assay compared to sequencing, the gold standard for SNP detection and lineage identification, demonstrated clinical sensitivity of 100% for all 57 specimens displaying N501Y mutant, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing to be typed as A23063T, including one specimen with mixed signal for wildtype and mutant. Clinical specificity was 100% in all 103 specimens typed as wild-type, with A23063 identified as wild-type by Sanger sequencing. The identification of circulating SARS-CoV-2 lineages carrying an N501Y mutation is critical for surveillance purposes. Current identification methods rely primarily on Sanger sequencing or whole genome sequencing which are time-consuming, labor-intensive and costly.

Patients with COVID-19 from March 1-May 31, 2020 were included; with a follow-up period spanning March-June 30, 2020. Percentages of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 were calculated, and characteristics of COVID-19 patients were summarized as medians or percentage. Baseline characteristics of all patients receiving care at Emory Dialysis (i.e. Emory general dialysis population) were presented as medians and percentages. RESULTS: Of 751 dialysis patients, 23 (3.1%) were diagnosed with COVID-19. The median age was 67.0 years and 13 patients (56.6%) were female. Eleven patients (47.8%) were residents of nursing homes. Nineteen patients (82.6%) required hospitalization and 6 patients (26.1%) died; the average number of days from a positive SARS-CoV-2 (COVID) test to death was 16.8 days (range 1-34). Two patients dialyzing at adjacent dialysis stations and a dialysis staff who cared for them, were diagnosed with COVID-19 in a time frame that may suggest transmission in the dialysis facility. In response, universal masking in the facility was implemented (prior to national guidelines recommending universal masking), infection control audits and re-trainings of PPE were also done to bolster infection control practices. CONCLUSION: We successfully implemented recommended COVID-19 infection control measures aimed at mitigating the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Most of the patients with COVID-19 required hospitalizations. Dialysis facilities should remain vigilant and monitor for possible transmission of COVID-19 in the facility.","Apata, Ibironke W; Cobb, Jason; Navarrete, Jose; Burkart, John; Plantinga, Laura; Lea, Janice P",BMC Nephrol,202,16

A virtual clinic was piloted to deliver preoperative health optimisation and shared decision-making for patients undergoing critical elective surgery. No literature existed on virtual preoperative clinics for older people to support the development. OBJECTIVE: this healthcare improvement study describes the setup and delivery of the virtual clinic as its primary aim. Secondary aims included: assessing older people's access to technology and their digital literacy for virtual consultation; to describe barriers and facilitators for consultations, as well as evaluation of patient and clinician satisfaction with the consultations' mode of delivery and outcomes. METHODS: a mixed methods healthcare improvement study was undertaken through plan-do-study-act cycles, semi-structure interviews, and quantitative service benchmarking. RESULTS: the pilot evaluated 67 preoperative consultations (43.3% video, 56.7% telephone, mean age 75) with a mix of surgical pathology (vascular 88.1%, colorectal 10.4%, urological 1.5%). Patient feedback demonstrated improved understanding of conditions (90.6%), and adequate opportunity to express opinions and questions (96.2%). Clinicians preferred video consultations (adequate to deliver services: 89.7% video; 68.4% telephone). The greatest barriers to engagement, none of which were exclusions to participation, included cognitive impairment, sensory impairment, or needing technical assistance setting up video consultations (52.2%). CONCLUSIONS: delivering a virtual preoperative medical optimisation and shared decision clinic for older people is feasible. This study will aid other units in developing their own virtual preoperative clinics. Future work should evaluate perioperative outcomes of delivering a face-to-face versus virtual clinic.","Joughin, Andrea; Ibitoye, Sarah; Crees, Amy; Shipway, David; Braude, Philip",Age ageing,202,20

Almost all subjects with COVID-19 develop anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin G (IgG) within 3 weeks after infection. No data are available on the seroconversion rates of cancer patients and COVID-19. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a multicenter, observational, prospective study that enrolled (i) patients and oncology health professionals with SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by real-time RT-PCR assays on nasal/pharyngeal swab specimens; (ii) patients and oncology health professionals with clinical or radiological suspicious of infection by SARS-CoV-2; and (iii) patients with cancer who are considered at high risk for infection and eligible for active therapy and/or major surgery. All enrolled subjects were tested with the 2019-nCoV IgG/IgM Rapid Test Cassette, which is a qualitative membrane-based immunoassay for the detection of IgG and IgM antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. The aim of the study was to evaluate anti-SARS-CoV-2 seroconversion rate in patients with cancer and oncology health care professionals with confirmed or clinically suspected COVID-19. RESULTS: From 30 March 2020 to 11 May 2020, 166 subjects were enrolled in the study. Among them, cancer patients and health workers were 61 (36.7%) and 105 (63.3%), respectively. Overall, 86 subjects (51.8%) had confirmed SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis by RT-PCR testing on nasopharyngeal swab specimen, and 60 (36.2%) had a clinical suspicious of COVID-19. Median time from symptom onset (for cases not confirmed by RT-PCR) or RT-PCR confirmation to serum antibody test was 17 days (interquartile range 26). In the population with confirmed RT-PCR, 83.8% of cases were IgG positive. No difference in IgG positivity was observed between cancer patients and health workers (87.9% versus 80.5%; P = 0.39). CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG antibody detection do not differ between cancer patients and healthy subjects.","Marra, A; Generali, D; Zagami, P; Cervoni, V; Gandini, S; Venturini, S; Morganti, S; Passerini, R; Orecchia, R; Curigliano, G",Ann. oncol,202,26

The symptoms included fever, coughing, and breathing difficulties. A few patients with this infection may only have atypical symptoms, which could lead to a misdiagnosis and subsequently further facilitate the spread of the virus. CASE SUMMARY A 74-year-old female patient complained of severe diarrhea. She did not have fever, coughing, or breathing difficulties. A physical examination revealed no obvious positive signs. The patient had been hypertensive for more than 10 years. Her blood pressure was well controlled. On January 9, 2020, the patient's son visited a colleague who was later confirmed positive for SARS-CoV-2 and his first close contact with our patient was on January 17. The patient was first diagnosed with gastrointestinal dysfunction. However, considering her indirect contact with a SARS-CoV-2-infected individual, we suggested that an atypical pneumonia virus infection should be ruled out. A computed tomography scan was performed on January 26, and showed ground-glass nodules scattered along the two lungs, suggestive of viral pneumonia. Given the clinical characteristics, epidemiological history, and examination, the patient was diagnosed with coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). CONCLUSION Our patient had atypical symptoms of COVID-19. Careful acquisition of an epidemiological history is necessary to make a correct diagnosis and strategize a treatment plan.","Li, Rui-Lin; Chu, Shu-Guang; Luo, Yu; Huang, Zhen-Hao; Hao, Ying; Fan, Cheng-Hui",World J.

Adults with PH are at potential risk for severe complications and high mortality due to associated comorbidities. It is difficult to extrapolate the outcomes of COVID-19 in adults to pediatric PH patients. Overall, a small number of COVID-19 cases is reported in patients with preexisting PH. Several factors may be responsible for the low incidence of COVID-19 in children with PH. Pulmonary hypertension is a rare disease, testing is not universal, and patients may have followed more rigorously the Center for Disease Control's guidelines recommended for personal protection with mask-wearing, social distancing, and hand sanitization through ongoing health education. The small number of COVID-19 cases in patients with preexisting PH does not support that PH is protective for COVID-19. However, medications used to treat PH may have some protection against COVID-19. This review discusses the pathophysiology of PH occurring with COVID-19, differences between children and adults with COVID-19, strategies for management of preexisting PH in children during the ongoing pandemic, and its impact within the field of PH.","Das, Bibhuti B",Medicina (Kaunas),202,30

AIM: To explore the impact of remote consultations in general practice, compared to face-to-face consultations, on utilisation and clinical outcomes across socioeconomic and disadvantaged groups. DESIGN & SETTING: Systematic review. METHOD: The authors undertook an electronic search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Web of Science from inception to June 2020. The study included studies that compared remote consultations to face-to-face consultations in primary care and reported outcomes by PROGRESS Plus criteria. Risk of bias was assessed using ROBINS-I. Data were synthesised narratively. RESULTS: Based on 13 studies that explored telephone and internet-based consultations, this review found that telephone consultations were used by younger people of working age, the very old, and non-immigrants, with internet-based consultations more likely to be used by younger people. Women consistently used more remote forms of consulting than men. Socioeconomic and ethnicity findings were mixed, with weak evidence that patients from more affluent areas were more likely to use internet-based communication. Remote consultations appeared to help patients with opioid dependence remain engaged with primary care. No studies reported on the impact on quality of care or clinical outcomes. CONCLUSION: Remote consultations in general practice are likely to be used more by younger, working people, non-immigrants, older patients, and women, with internet-based consultations more by younger, affluent, and educated groups. Widespread use of remote consultations should be treated with caution until the inequalities impact on clinical outcomes and quality of care is known.","Parker, Ruth F; Figures, Emma L; Paddison, Charlotte Am; Matheson, James Idm; Blane, David N; Ford, John A",,202,26

We provide a summary, comparison and discussion of these proposed and actual changes with a particular focus on the impact on adult social care and safeguarding of the rights of citizens. To begin, a summary and comparison of the relevant changes, or potential changes, to mental health, mental capacity and adult social care law across the four jurisdictions is provided. Next, we critique the suggested and actual changes and in so doing consider the immediate and longer term implications for adult social care, including mental health and mental capacity, at the time of publication.several core themes emerged: concerns around process and scrutiny; concerns about possible changes to the workforce and last, the possible threat on the ability to safeguard human rights. It has been shown that, ordinarily, legislative provisions across the jurisdictions of the UK are different, save for Wales (which shares most of its mental health law provisions with England). Such divergence is also mirrored in the way in which the suggested emergency changes could be implemented. Aside from this, there is also a wider concern about a lack of parity of esteem between social care and health care, a concern which is common to all. What is interesting is that the introduction of CVA 2020 forced a comparison to be made between the four UK nations which also shines a spotlight on how citizens can anticipate receipt of services.","Vicary, Sarah; Stone, Kevin; McCusker, Pearse; Davidson, Gavin; Spencer-Lane, Tim",Int J Law Psychiatry,202,24

METHODS: Multicenter, prospective study of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia admitted to Internal Medicine units. All patients were screened for DVT of the lower limbs with serial CUS. Anticoagulation was defined as: low dose (enoxaparin 20-40 mg/day or fondaparinux 1.5-2.5 mg/day); intermediate dose (enoxaparin 60-80 mg/day); high dose (enoxaparin 120-160 mg or fondaparinux 5-10 mg/day or oral anticoagulation). The primary end-point of the study was the diagnosis of DVT by CUS. RESULTS: Over a two-month period, 227 consecutive patients with moderate-severe COVID-19 pneumonia were enrolled. The incidence of DVT was 13.7% (6.2% proximal, 7.5% distal), mostly asymptomatic. All patients received anticoagulation (enoxaparin 95.6%) at the following doses: low 57.3%, intermediate 22.9%, high 19.8%. Patients with and without DVT had similar characteristics, and no difference in anticoagulant regimen was observed.

At ROC analysis peak D-dimer level >2000 ng/mL (AUC 0.703; 95% CI 0.572-0.834; p = 0.004) was the most accurate cut-off value able to predict DVT (RR 3.74; 95%CI 1.27-10, p = 0.016). CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of DVT in acutely ill patients with COVID-19 pneumonia is relevant. A surveillance protocol by serial CUS of the lower limbs is useful to timely identify DVT that would go otherwise largely undetected.","Pieralli, Filippo; Pomero, Fulvio; Giampieri, Margherita; Marcucci, Rossella; Prisco, Domenico; Luise, Fabio; Mancini, Antonio; Milia, Alessandro; Sammicheli, Lucia; Tassinari, Irene; Caldi, Francesca; Innocenti, Francesca; Faraone, Antonio; Beltrame, Chiara; Pini, Riccardo; Ungar, Andrea; Fortini, Alberto",PLoS One,202,12

METHODS: A retrospective survey was performed comparing procedure volumes within March 2019 (pre-COVID-19) with April 2020 (during first wave of COVID-19 pandemic). Sixty-three (63) health care facilities within Oceania that perform cardiac diagnostic procedures were surveyed, including a mixture of metropolitan and regional, hospital and outpatient, public and private sites, and 846 facilities outside of Oceania. The percentage change in procedure volume was measured between March 2019 and April 2020, compared by test type and by facility. RESULTS: In Oceania, the total cardiac diagnostic procedure volume was reduced by 52.2% from March 2019 to April 2020, compared to a reduction of 75.9% seen in the rest of the world (p<0.001). Within Oceania sites, this reduction varied significantly between procedure types, but not between types of health care facility. All procedure types (other than stress cardiac magnetic resonance [CMR] and positron emission tomography [PET]) saw significant reductions in volume over this time period (p<0.001). In Oceania, transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) decreased by 51.6%, transoesophageal echocardiography (TOE) by 74.0%, and stress tests by 65% overall, which was more pronounced for stress electrocardiograph (ECG) (81.8%) and stress echocardiography (76.7%) compared to stress single-photon emission computerised tomography (SPECT) (44.3%). Invasive coronary angiography decreased by 36.7% in Oceania. CONCLUSION: A significant reduction in cardiac diagnostic procedure volume was seen across all facility types in Oceania and was likely a function of recommendations from cardiac societies and directives from government to minimise spread of COVID-19 amongst patients and staff. Longer term evaluation is important to assess for negative patient outcomes which may relate to deferral of usual models of care within cardiology.","O039,; Sullivan, Patricia; Younger, John; Van Pelt, Niels; Malley, Sue; Lenturut-Katal, Dora; Hirschfeld, Cole B; Vitola, Joao V; Cerci, Rodrigo; Williams, Michelle C; Shaw, Leslee J; Raggi, Paolo; Villines, Todd C; Dorbala, Sharmila; Choi, Andrew D; Cohen, Yosef; Goebel, Benjamin; Malkovskiy, Eli; Randazzo, Michael; Pascual, Thomas N B; Pynda, Yaroslav; Dondi, Maurizio; Paez, Diana; Einstein, Andrew J; Better, Nathan",Heart lung circ,202,1

Because of regional differences in natural and urban conditions, rankings of the urgencies of flood drainage rights allocations in different regions are of great practical significance to the realization of optimal allocations and reduction of damages. Based on the ""pressure-state-response"" (PSR) framework, this study designed an index system of flood drainage rights allocations in river basins for the comprehensive consideration of the different attributes of regional societies, environments, and technologies, as well as the differences in the quality of technical management and in the levels of social and economic development. A Pythagoras fuzzy TOPSIS method was used to evaluate the urgencies and determine the management of allocations in different areas. Eight cities in Jiangsu Province in the Huai River Basin were selected as the research objects. The results showed that pressure factors played dominant roles in the degrees of urgency. Among the cities, Nantong had the highest degree, followed by Taizhou, whereas Lianyungang had the lowest. The degrees in the central region of Jiangsu were higher than in the northern region.","Zhang, Dandan; Shen, Juqin; Liu, Pengfei; Sun, Fuhua",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),202,20

A Comparative Review of Educational Technology Programs’ Effects on Mathematics Achievement,15.409035,1.7659053,2020,"BACKGROUND: There is a scarcity of data regarding the effect of hypertension on the clinical presentation and outcome of symptomatic patients with COVID-19 infection in comparison with non-hypertensive patients. AIM OF THE STUDY: To describe the clinical presentation, radiological and hematological data of a cohort of symptomatic COVID-19 positive hypertensive patients (n=50) in comparison with another cohort of normotensive symptomatic COVID-19 positive patients (n=250) diagnosed at the same time and managed in the same health facilities (from Jan 2020 to May 2020). Associated comorbidities were assessed, and the Charlson Comorbidity Index was calculated. The outcomes, including duration of hospitalization, length of ICU stay, duration of mechanical ventilation, and duration of O2 supplementation, were also assessed. RESULTS: The prevalence of hypertension in symptomatic COVID-19 positive patients was 50/300 (16%; the prevalence of hypertension in Qatari adults is ~30%). Hypertensive patients had a higher prevalence of DM, CKD, and cardiac dysfunction compared to normotensive patients (p<0.01).They had a higher Charlson Co-morbidity score (2.3±1.8) compared to the normotensive patients (0.4±0.9) (p<0.01). Clinically and radiologically, hypertensive patients had significantly higher percentage of pneumonia, severe pneumonia, and ARDS versus normotensive patients (p<0.01). CBC and differential WBC did not differ between hypertensive and normotensive patients. Hypertensive patients had significantly higher CRP(58.5±84), compared to normotensive patients (28±59) (p<0.01). Furthermore, a longer duration of hospitalization, intensive care unit (ICU) stay, mechanical ventilation and oxygen therapy versus normotensive patients was also observed. CRP was correlated significantly with the duration of stay in the ICU and the duration for oxygen supplementation (r=0.56 and 0.61, respectively; p<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Hypertensive patients with COVID-19 had a higher inflammatory response (higher CRP levels), a significant increase of comorbidities, and a more aggressive course of the disease necessitating a higher rate of ICU admission, longer requirement for hospitalization and oxygen use compared to normotensive patients.","De Sanctis, Vincenzo",Acta Biomed,202,24

Shelters used for this purpose usually accommodate a large number of flood evacuees for a temporary period. Floods during pandemic result in a compound hazard. Evacuations under such situations are difficult to plan as social distancing is nearly impossible in the highly crowded shelters. This results in a multi-objective problem with conflicting objectives of maximizing the number of evacuees from flood-prone regions and minimizing the number of infections at the end of the shelter's stay. To the best of our knowledge, such a problem is yet to be explored in literature. Here we develop a simulation-optimization framework, where multiple objectives are handled with a max-min approach. The simulation model consists of an extended Susceptible Exposed Infectious Recovered Susceptible (SEIRS) model.We apply the proposed model to the flood-prone Jagatsinghpur district in the state of Odisha, India. We find that the proposed approach can provide an estimate of people required to be evacuated from individual flood-prone villages to reduce flood hazards during the pandemic. At the same time, this does not result in an uncontrolled number of new infections. The proposed approach can generalize to different regions and can provide a framework to stakeholders to manage conflicting objectives in disaster management planning and to handle compound hazards.","Tripathy, Shrabani S.; Bhatia, Udit; Mohanty, Mohit; Karmakar, Subhankar; Ghosh, Subimal",,202,10

We report a series of feasible procedures to selectively recover the four metals (Li, Ni, Mn, and Co) using a combination of hydrometallurgical and pyrometallurgyical processes. Firstly, oxalic acid is used to dissolve Li and precipitate the other three metals in oxalate forms. It is found that under the optimal condition, about 98% of the Li is dissolved, and on average 93% of the other three metals are transformed to precipitated oxalates. The oxalates are then transformed to NiO·Mn2O3·Co3O4 by being calcinated at 723 K under atmospheric environment. The selective recovery of NiO·Mn2O3·Co3O4 can be achieved by using H2SO4 under three different conditions. The first step is to use H2SO4 to selectively dissolve CoO from the Co3O4. Then the combination of H2SO4 and ultrasound is adopted to dissolve NiO, during which the ultrasound destroys the surficial oxide film on the NiO. Afterwards, the Mn2O3 is transformed to MnO2 and Mn2+ in heated H2SO4. The Co, Ni and Mn ions are dissolved in a sequence, which facilitates their separation and recovery. As the main components of the final residual solids, Co2O3 and MnO2 present in distinctly different sizes and shapes, which are beneficial for their separation and direct usage.","He, Hongping; Feng, Junli; Gao, Xiaofeng; Fei, Xunchang",Chemosphere,202,16

METHODS: All adult patients admitted to Montefiore Medical Center from March 1, 2020, to April 10, 2020, and undergoing lower extremity venous duplex for DVT evaluation were included. Patients admitted with suspicion of COVID-19 were divided into severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) positive and SARS-CoV-2 negative groups based on in-hospital test results. Patients without clinical suspicion for COVID-19 were not tested. A retrospective case-control study design was used to identify potential risk factors for DVT in patients with COVID-19. Demographic, radiographic, and laboratory values were abstracted and analyzed. RESULTS: During the study period, 3404 patients with confirmed COVID-19 were admitted to the hospital. Of the 135 SARS-CoV-2 patients who underwent duplex scanning, there were 18 (13.3%) noted to have DVT compared with 72 of the 711 patients (10.1%) who were either SARS-CoV-2 negative or untested. The odds ratio for DVT in COVID-19 was 1.35 (95% confidence interval, 0.78-2.34; P = .289). Baseline characteristics for COVID-19 patients with and without DVT were overall similar. COVID-19 patients with DVT had an elevated median first d-dimer (18.88 µg/mL [interquartile range (IQR), 7.79-20.00] vs 2.55 µg/mL [IQR, 1.45-6.28]; P = .002; reference value, <0.5 µg/mL), average in-hospital d-dimer (median, 11.93 µg/mL [IQR, 8.25-16.97] vs 3.54 µg/mL [IQR, 2.05-8.53]; P < .001) and median fibrinogen level (501.0 [IQR, 440.0-629.0] vs 654.5 [IQR, 535.8-780.0]; P = .002; reference range, 187-502 mg/dL). There was a trend to significance for COVID-19 patients with DVT compared with without DVT in median d-dimer levels at the time of the duplex (13.61 µg/mL [IQR, 4.04-19.97] vs 3.58 µg/mL [IQR, 2.51-9.62]; P = .055) and median ferritin levels (1679.0 ng/mL [IQR, 1168.0-2577.0] vs 1103.0 ng/mL [IQR, 703.5-2076.5]; P = .055; reference range, 25-270 ng/mL). Twelve of the 18 patients with COVID who developed DVT did so despite chemical thromboprophylaxis, and 2 developed DVT despite therapeutic anticoagulation CONCLUSIONS: We found only a modestly increased risk of DVT in patients with COVID-19, likely underestimated owing to limitations in duplex testing early in the epidemic. Elevated d-dimer and a less elevated fibrinogen are associated with DVT in patients with COVID-19 who seem to form thrombus despite conventional chemical thromboprophylaxis. Additionally, an increasing d-dimer over time may be a reflection of the development of DVT in patients with COVID-19.","Koleilat, Issam; Galen, Benjamin; Choinski, Krystina; Hatch, Ayesha Nzeribe; Jones, Davis Brent; Billett, Henny; Indes, Jeff; Lipsitz, Evan",J.

Worldwide academic research on this topic has led to an explosion of scientific literature, never seen before. Bibliometrics provide methods to illustrate this exceptional phenomenon in academic publications. The objective of this paper is to analyze the Covid-19 research from a bibliometric perspective and to study the impact of the publication explosion on bibliometric indicators. The present study shows how an exceptional phenomenon has a disruptive impact on bibliometric indicators, such as the h-index and the Journal Impact Factor. The higher the specialization, the higher the possible impact of a disruptive phenomenon. In applied sciences, more important than the research or the discipline, the specific theme of the research is crucial for citations of articles and for their impact. The salience of the topic, the magnitude of the problem at study and the urgency to find solutions are drivers for citations. The study of the Covid-19 research illustrates the relativity of indicators and the need for context.

For that, in the Design of Experiments (DOE) an arbitrary interface, ""coating efficiency"" (CE) is introduced and scaled the cumulative percentage coating (CPC) to get predictable control over drug release (DR). Subsequently, the granules containing ASP are converted to spherules and then to Ethyl cellulose (EC) Coated spherules (CS) by a novel bed coating during the rolling (BCDR) process. Among spherules, one with 0.35 mm than 0.71 mm shows required properties. The CS has a low 1200 angle by Optical Microscopy (OM), smooth surface without cracks by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and better flow properties (Angle of repose 29.69 ± 0.780, Carr's index 6.73 ± 2.24%, Hausner's Ratio 1.07 ± 0.03) than granules and spherules. Once certain structure-dependent control over release is attained (EC coated spherules shows 10% reduction in burst release (BR) than uncoated spherules showing a release of 80-91%) the predictability is achieved and Design of space (DOS) by DOE (CE-70.14%and CPC-200% and DR-61.54%) is established. The results of DOE to experimentally validated results were within 20% deviation. The aspirin is changing its crystal structure by powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) from Form-I to Form-II showing polymorphism inside the drug reservoir with respect to the process. This CE and CPC approach in DOE can be used for delivery system design of other labile drugs similar to aspirin in emergency situations.","Thrivikraman Nair, Sreejith; Kamalasanan, Kaladhar; Moidu, Ashna; Shyamsundar, Pooja; Nair, Lakshmi J; P, Venkatesan",Int J Biol Macromol,202,1

It has a high transmission rate among humans, and is a threat to global public health. However, there are no effective prophylactics or therapeutics available. It is necessary to identify vulnerable and susceptible groups for adequate protection and care against this disease. Recent studies have reported that COVID-19 has angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a functional receptor, which may lead to the development of severe cerebrovascular diseases (CVD), including strokes, in patients with risk factors for CVD such as diabetes and smoking. Thus, the World Health Organization (WHO) advised caution against COVID-19 for smokers and patients with underlying clinical symptoms, including cardiovascular diseases. Here, we observed ACE2 expression in the brain of rat middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model and evaluated the effects of cigarette smoke extract (CSE) and diabetes on ACE2 expression in vessels. We showed that the levels of ACE2 expression was increased in the cortex penumbra after ischemic injuries. CSE treatment significantly elevated ACE2 expression in human brain vessels. We found that ACE2 expression was upregulated in primary cultured human blood vessels with diabetes compared to healthy controls. This study demonstrates that ACE2 expression is increased in ischemic brains and vessels exposed to diabetes or smoking, makes them vulnerable to COVID-19 infection.","Choi, Ji-Young; Lee, Hye-Kyung; Park, Jung Hyun; Cho, Sun-Jung; Kwon, Munjin; Jo, Chulman; Koh, Young Ho",Biochem Biophys Res Commun,202,20

Given these problems can have significant impacts throughout the lifespan, preventing the negative repercussions of COVID-19 on children's mental health is essential. Philosophy for children (P4C) and mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) show promise in this regard. OBJECTIVE: The goal of the present study was to compare the impact of online MBI and P4C interventions on mental health, within the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. We used a randomized cluster trial to assess and compare the impact of both interventions on elementary school students' (N = 37) anxiety and inattention symptoms as well as on their basic psychological need satisfaction (BPN). RESULTS: ANCOVAs revealed a significant effect of the P4C intervention on mental health difficulties, controlling for baseline levels. Participants in the P4C group showed lower scores on the measured symptoms at post-test than participants in the MBI group. Significant effects of the MBI on levels of BPN were also found. Participants in the MBI intervention reported greater BPN satisfaction at post-test than participants in the P4C intervention. CONCLUSION: Results from this study suggest that, in the current context of the COVID-19 pandemic, a P4C intervention centered around COVID-19 related themes may be helpful to reduce mental health difficulties, that a MBI may be useful to satisfy BPN, and that both interventions were easy to offer online to elementary school students. Future work including a larger sample size and follow-up measures is warranted. PUBLIC SIGNIFICANCE: Practice: Philosophy for children (P4C) and mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) can be used to foster mental health in elementary school students, in the current COVID-19 context. Policy: As we do not anticipate that facilitators will be allowed in schools during the 2020-2021 school year and that children will, most likely, be attending school in the current COVID-19 context, policymakers who want to implement psychological support measures in elementary schools should consider an online modality, which has shown in this study to work well, be feasible, and yield positive results on youth mental health.","Malboeuf-Hurtubise, Catherine; Léger-Goodes, Terra; Mageau, Geneviève A; Joussemet, Mireille; Herba, Catherine; Chadi, Nicholas; Lefrançois, David; Camden, Chantal; Bussières, Ève-Line; Taylor, Geneviève; Éthier, Marc-André; Gagnon, Mathieu",Prog Neuropsychopharmacol Biol Psychiatry,202,20

The severity and mortality of COVID-19 are associated with virus-induced dysfunctional inflammatory responses and cytokine storms. However, the interplay between host inflammatory responses and SARS-CoV-2 infection remains largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) protein, the major structural protein of the virion, promotes the virus-triggered activation of NF-&#954;B signaling. After binding to viral RNA, N protein robustly undergoes liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS), which recruits TAK1 and IKK complex, the key kinases of NF-&#954;B signaling, to enhance NF-&#954;B activation. Moreover, 1,6-hexanediol, the inhibitor of LLPS, can attenuate the phase separation of N protein and restrict its regulatory functions in NF-&#954;B activation. These results suggest that LLPS of N protein provides a platform to induce NF-&#954;B hyper-activation, which could be a potential therapeutic target against COVID-19 severe pneumonia.","Wu, Yaoxing; Ma, Ling; Cai, Sihui; Zhuang, Zhen; Zhao, Zhiyao; Jin, Shouheng; Xie, Weihong; Zhou, Lingli; Zhang, Lei; Zhao, Jincun; Cui, Jun",Signal Transduct Target Ther,202,23

From March 1 to April 25, 2020, New York City, New York (NYC), reported 17â¯118 COVID-19-related deaths. On April 6, 2020, out-of-hospital cardiac arrests peaked at 305 cases, nearly a 10-fold increase from the prior year. Objective: To describe the characteristics (race/ethnicity, comorbidities, and emergency medical services [EMS] response) associated with outpatient cardiac arrests and death during the COVID-19 pandemic in NYC. Design, Setting, and Participants: This population-based, cross-sectional study compared patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest receiving resuscitation by the NYC 911 EMS system from March 1 to April 25, 2020, compared with March 1 to April 25, 2019. The NYC 911 EMS system serves more than 8.4 million people. Exposures: The COVID-19 pandemic. Main Outcomes and Measures: Characteristics associated with out-of-hospital arrests and the outcomes of out-of-hospital cardiac arrests. Results: A total of 5325 patients were included in the main analysis (2935 men [56.2%]; mean [SD] age, 71 [18] years), 3989 in the COVID-19 period and 1336 in the comparison period. The incidence of nontraumatic out-of-hospital cardiac arrests in those who underwent EMS resuscitation in 2020 was 3 times the incidence in 2019 (47.5/100â¯000 vs 15.9/100â¯000). Patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest during 2020 were older (mean [SD] age, 72 [18] vs 68 [19] years), less likely to be white (611 of 2992 [20.4%] vs 382 of 1161 [32.9%]), and more likely to have hypertension (2134 of 3989 [53.5%] vs 611 of 1336 [45.7%]), diabetes (1424 of 3989 [35.7%] vs 348 of 1336 [26.0%]), and physical limitations (2259 of 3989 [56.6%] vs 634 of 1336 [47.5%]).

From March 1 to April 25, 2020, New York City, New York (NYC), reported 17â¯118 COVID-19-related deaths. On April 6, 2020, out-of-hospital cardiac arrests peaked at 305 cases, nearly a 10-fold increase from the prior year. Objective: To describe the characteristics (race/ethnicity, comorbidities, and emergency medical services [EMS] response) associated with outpatient cardiac arrests and death during the COVID-19 pandemic in NYC. Design, Setting, and Participants: This population-based, cross-sectional study compared patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest receiving resuscitation by the NYC 911 EMS system from March 1 to April 25, 2020, compared with March 1 to April 25, 2019. The NYC 911 EMS system serves more than 8.4 million people. Exposures: The COVID-19 pandemic. Main Outcomes and Measures: Characteristics associated with out-of-hospital arrests and the outcomes of out-of-hospital cardiac arrests. Results: A total of 5325 patients were included in the main analysis (2935 men [56.2%]; mean [SD] age, 71 [18] years), 3989 in the COVID-19 period and 1336 in the comparison period.

Such networks also provide a platform to users where they can engage in conversations. However, such micro-blogging platforms like Twitter restricts the length of text. Due to paucity of sufficient word occurrences in such posts, classification of this information is a challenging task using standard tools of natural language processing (NLP). Moreover, high complexity and dynamics of the posts in social media makes text classification a challenging problem. However, considering additional cues in the form of past labels and times associated with the post can be potentially helpful for performing text classification in a better way. To address this problem, we propose models based on the Hawkes process (HP) which can naturally incorporate the temporal features and past labels along with textual features for improving short text classification. In particular, we propose a discriminative approach to model text in HP where the text features parameterize the base intensity and/or the triggering kernel. Another major contribution is to consider kernel to be a function of both time and text, and further use a neural network to model the kernel. This enables modelling and effectively learning the text along with the historical influences for tweet classification. We demonstrate the advantages of the proposed techniques on standard benchmarks for rumour stance classification.","Tondulkar, Rohan; Dubey, Manisha; Srijith, P. K.; Lukasik, Michal",,202,22

The Spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2 attaches to host lung epithelial cells through the cell surface receptor ACE2, a process dependent on host proteases including TMPRSS2. Here, we identified small molecules that can reduce surface expression of TMPRSS2 using a 2,700 FDA-approved or current clinical trial compounds. Among these, homoharringtonine and halofuginone appear the most potent agents, reducing endogenous TMPRSS2 expression at sub-micromolar concentrations. These effects appear to be mediated by a drug-induced alteration in TMPRSS2 protein stability. We further demonstrate that halofuginone modulates TMPRSS2 levels through proteasomal-mediated degradation that involves the E3 ubiquitin ligase component DDB1- and CUL4-associated factor 1 (DCAF1). Finally, cells exposed to homoharringtonine and halofuginone, at concentrations of drug known to be achievable in human plasma, demonstrated marked resistance to SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviral infection. Given the safety and pharmacokinetic data already available for the compounds identified in our screen, these results should help expedite the rational design of human clinical trials designed to combat COVID-19 infection.","Chen, Y.; Lear, T.; Evankovich, J.; Larsen, M.; Lin, B.; Alfaras, I.; Kennerdell, J.; Salminen, L.; Camarco, D.; Lockwood, K.; Liu, J.; Myerburg, M.; McDyer, J.; Liu, Y.; Finkel, T.; Chen, B.",,202,1

Methods and Results In a propensity score-matched outpatient cohort (January-May 2020) of 2263 Medicare Advantage and commercially insured individuals with hypertension and a positive outpatient SARS-CoV-2, we determined the association of ACE inhibitors and ARBs with COVID-19 hospitalization. In a concurrent inpatient cohort of 7933 hospitalized with COVID-19, we tested their association with in-hospital mortality. The robustness of the observations was assessed in a contemporary cohort (May-August). In the outpatient study, neither ACE inhibitors (hazard ratio [HR], 0.77; 0.53-1.13, P=0.18) nor ARBs (HR, 0.88; 0.61-1.26, P=0.48) were associated with hospitalization risk. ACE inhibitors were associated with lower hospitalization risk in the older Medicare group (HR, 0.61; 0.41-0.93, P=0.02), but not the younger commercially insured group (HR, 2.14; 0.82-5.60, P=0.12; P-interaction 0.09). Neither ACE inhibitors nor ARBs were associated with lower hospitalization risk in either population in the validation cohort. In the primary inpatient study cohort, neither ACE inhibitors (HR, 0.97; 0.81-1.16; P=0.74) nor ARBs (HR, 1.15; 0.95-1.38, P=0.15) were associated with in-hospital mortality. These observations were consistent in the validation cohort. Conclusions ACE inhibitors and ARBs were not associated with COVID-19 hospitalization or mortality. Despite early evidence for a potential association between ACE inhibitors and severe COVID-19 prevention in older individuals, the inconsistency of this observation in recent data argues against a role for prophylaxis.","Khera, Rohan; Clark, Callahan; Lu, Yuan; Guo, Yinglong; Ren, Sheng; Truax, Brandon; Spatz, Erica S; Murugiah, Karthik; Lin, Zhenqiu; Omer, Saad B; Vojta, Deneen; Krumholz, Harlan M",J Am Heart Assoc,202,24

We investigate private psychiatrists' uptake of telehealth, and face-to-face consultations for April-September 2020 for the state of Victoria, which experienced two consecutive waves of COVID-19. We compare these to the same 6 months in 2019. METHOD: MBS-item-consultation data were extracted for video, telephone and face-to-face consultations with a psychiatrist for April-September 2020 and compared to face-to-face consultations in the same period of 2019 Victoria-wide, and for all of Australia. RESULTS: Total Victorian psychiatry consultations (telehealth and face-to-face) rose by 19% in April-September 2020 compared to 2019, with telehealth comprising 73% of this total. Victoria's increase in total psychiatry consultations was 5% higher than the all-Australian increase. Face-to-face consultations in April-September 2020 were only 46% of the comparative 2019 consultations. Consultations of less than 15 min duration (87% telephone and 13% video) tripled in April-September 2020, compared to the same period last year. Video consultations comprised 41% of total telehealth provision: these were used mainly for new patient assessments and longer consultations.

In the present study, by using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), we demonstrated that CYP24A1 and hsa_circ_0060927 were only transcribed in 33 and 25 out of 83 CRC tissues, respectively. In these samples, we demonstrated that CYP24A1 was up-regulated in both linear and circular forms (P < 0.05). Furthermore, we showed that CYP24A1and hsa_circ_0060927 transcription were induced after vitamin D treatment in HCT-116 and HT-29 colon cancer cell lines. Importantly, analysis of the ROC curve in expressed samples indicated that CYP24A1 and hsa_circ_0060927 could serve as the potential diagnostic markers of CRC, but due to the fact that these transcripts are not expressed in many samples, the diagnostic role of these transcripts could be rejected.

While at first glance prevention policies seem fairly uncontroversial, they have intricate links concerning the impact on preventive policies to social citizenship and to the notion of the “good” citizen. I argue that prevention is a future‐oriented permanent task that requires constant alertness and the commitment of responsible citizens to being “ahead of time.” Although originally based on the principles of voluntary compliance and self‐responsibility in Germany, preventive policies are likely to become more compulsory in the aftermath of the COVID‐19 pandemic that has, in effect, been a collective crash course on the importance of prevention and its range of policy tools. Under the prevention paradigm, active citizenship requires anticipatory action—that may turn into obedience—due to the imminent danger of assumed health risks.Barrault‐Stella, Lorenzo, and Thomas Douniès. 2021. “Introduction to the Special Issue: Citizenship as a Tool of Government in Europe.” Politics & Policy 49 (4).Haapajärvi, Linda. 2021. “On the Importance of Playing House: Belonging‐Work and the Making of Relational Citizens in Finnish Immigrant Integration Policies.” Politics & Policy 49 (4).Mioni, Michele. 2021. “The ‘Good Citizen’ as ‘Respectable Worker:' State, Unemployment, and Social Policy in the United Kingdom and Italy, 1930 to 1950.” Politics & Policy 49 (4).

Sostengo que la prevención es una tarea permanente orientada al futuro que requiere un estado de alerta constante y el compromiso de ciudadanos responsables de estar “por delante.” Aunque originalmente se basaron en los principios de cumplimiento voluntario y responsabilidad propia en Alemania, es probable que las políticas preventivas se vuelvan más obligatorias a raíz de la pandemia de COVID‐19 que, de hecho, ha formado un curso intensivo colectivo sobre la importancia de la prevención y su gama de herramientas de política.

Here, we retrospectively assess the prevalence of informative COVID trials launched in the first 6 months of the pandemic. MethodsWe created a cohort of SARS-CoV-2 treatment and prevention efficacy trials that were initiated from 2020-01-01 to 2020-06-30 using ClinicalTrials.gov registration records. We evaluated trials on 3 criteria of informativeness: potential redundancy, design quality and feasibility of patient-participant recruitment. The study protocol was prospectively registered with the Open Science Framework (https://osf.io/fp726/). ResultsWe included 500 trials in our cohort, 58% of which were Phase 2 and 84.8% were directed towards the treatment of SARS-CoV-2. Close to one third of trials met all three criteria and were deemed informative (29.0% (95% Confidence Interval 23.7 - 36.9)). The proportion of potentially redundant trials in our cohort was 4.1%. Over half of the trials in our cohort (56.2%) did not meet our criteria for high quality trial design. The proportion of trials with infeasible patient-participant recruitment was 22.6%. ConclusionsLess than one third of COVID-19 trials registered on ClinicalTrials.gov during the first six months met all three criteria for informativeness. Shortcomings in trial design, recruitment feasibility and redundancy reflect longstanding weaknesses in the clinical research enterprise that were likely amplified by the exceptional circumstances of a pandemic.","Hutchinson, Nora; Klas, Katarzyna; Carlisle, Benjamin Gregory; Kimmelman, Jonathan; Waligora, Marcin",,202,1

The pediatric age group comprises only less than 5% of total COVID-19 worldwide, therefore, large studies in this population are unlikely in the immediate future. Hence, we planned to synthesize the current data that will help in a better understanding of COVID-19 in children. METHODS: Four different electronic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, and CENTRAL) were searched for articles related to COVID-19 in the pediatric population. We included studies reporting disease characteristics and outcomes of COVID-19 in patients aged less than 19 years. We performed a random-effect meta-analysis to provide pooled estimates of various disease characteristics. RESULTS: 27 studies (4857 patients) fulfilling the eligibility criteria were included in this systematic review, from a total of 883 records. About half of the patients had each of fever and cough, 11% (6-17%) had fast breathing, and 6-13% had gastrointestinal manifestations. Most of the patients had mild to moderate disease, and only 4% had a severe or critical illness. Leukopenia was the commonest reported laboratory abnormality. CONCLUSION: Even among the symptomatic COVID-19 cases, severe manifestations are seen in very few children. Though fever and respiratory symptoms are most common, many children also have gastrointestinal manifestations.","Meena, Jitendra; Yadav, Jaivinder; Saini, Lokesh; Yadav, Arushi; Kumar, Jogender",Indian pediatr,202,10

Infected hosts exhibit diverse clinical features, ranging from asymptomatic to severe symptoms in their genital organs, respiratory, digestive, and circulatory systems. Considering the high transmissibility (R0: &#8804;6.0) compared to Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV, the quest for the clinical development of suitable antiviral nanotherapeutics (NTPs) is incessant. We are presenting a systematic review of the literature published between 2003 and 2020 to validate the hypothesis that the pharmacokinetics, collateral acute/chronic side effects of nano drugs and spike proteins arrangement of coronaviruses can revolutionize the therapeutic approach to cure COVID-19. Our aim is also to critically assess the slow release kinetics and specific target site chemical synthesis influenced competence of NTPs and nanotoxicity based antiviral actions, which are commonly exploited in the synthesis of modulated nanomedicines. The pathogenesis of novel virulent pathogens at the cellular and molecular levels are also considered, which is of utmost importance to characterize the emerging nano-drug agents as diagnostics or therapeutics or viral entry inhibitors. Such types of approaches trigger the scientists and policymakers in the development of a conceptual framework of nano-biotechnology by linking nanoscience and virology to present a smart molecular diagnosis/treatment for pandemic viral infections.","Mukherjee, Santanu; Mazumder, Payal; Joshi, Madhvi; Joshi, Chaitanya; Dalvi, Sameer V; Kumar, Manish",Environ Res,202,16

METHODS: In this context, a 25-item anonymized e-survey was posted on the Twitter and Facebook e-groups and pages of various scleroderma organizations and patient communities to assess the problems faced by patients with SSc during the pandemic, with a focus on effects on the disease, drug procurance, continuity of medical care, and prevalent fears among patients. RESULTS: Of the 291 participants (median age of 55 [43.5-63] years, 93.8% females), limited systemic sclerosis was the most common diagnosis (42.3%). Many patients experienced problems attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic (119, 40.9%), of which 46 (38.7%) required an increase in medicines, and 12 (10.1%) of these needed hospitalizations for disease-related complications. More than one-third (36.4%) were on glucocorticoids or had underlying cardiovascular risks (39%) that would predispose them to severe COVID-19.A significant proportion (38.1%) faced hurdles in procuring medicines or experienced disruption in physiotherapy sessions (24.7%). One-quarter (24.1%) felt it was difficult to contact their specialist, whereas another 7.2% were unable to do so. Contracting COVID-19 was the most prevalent fear (71.5%), followed by infection in the family (61.9%), and a flare of the disease (45.4%). Most respondents preferred teleconsultations (55.7%) over hospital visits in the pandemic period. CONCLUSION: The results of the patient survey suggest that the COVID-19 pandemic has affected many patients with SSc and may translate to poorer outcomes in this population in the postpandemic period.","Gupta, Latika; Kharbanda, Rajat; Agarwal, Vishwesh; Misra, Durga Prasanna; Agarwal, Vikas",J Clin Rheumatol,202,24

This study aimed to investigate the effects of genetic polymorphisms on the pharmacokinetics of LY03004 compared with those on Risperdal Consta®. METHODS: A total of 100 Chinese patients with stable schizophrenia were randomly assigned to the LY03004 or Risperdal Consta® treatment group. Each patient received five biweekly intramuscular injections of 25 mg risperidone long-acting injection microspheres. A total of 34 blood samples before and after injections from Day 1 to Day 113 were collected from each patient, and polymorphic alleles of cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP2D6 (*4, *10, *14), CYP3A5 (*3), and ABCB1 (C1236 > T, G2677T/A, and C3435T) were analyzed using Sanger sequencing and polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism. RESULTS: The risperidone Cmax,ss, Cmin,ss, AUC0-tau,ss, and the ratio of risperidone to 9-hydroxyrisperidone (9-OH-R) in CYP2D6 intermediate metabolizers (IMs) were significantly different compared with those in normal metabolizers (NMs) in both the LY03004 and Risperdal Consta® groups (P < 0.05). However, 9-OH-R was not significantly different between IMs and NMs (P > 0.05). The AUC0-tau,ss of the active moiety (risperidone plus 9-OH-R) was 6.51 ± 3.34 in NMs and 7.00 ± 1.81 in IMs (P = 0.071) in the LY03004 group and 6.07 ± 2.31 and 7.95 ± 3.42 (P = 0.053) in NMs and IMs, respectively, in the Risperdal Consta® group. In the LY03004 group, the Cmax,ss of risperidone in carriers of the ABCB1-C3435T TT variant was significantly lower than that in CC and CT carriers (TT 7.76 ± 4.23 ng/mL, CT 11.6 ± 8.27 ng/mL, CC 14.3 ± 7.66 ng/ml; P = 0.045), but no significant differences were found in the active moiety. In the Risperdal Consta® group, C3435T TT carriers had significantly lower Cmin,ss of the active moiety (TT 5.09 ± 4.38 ng/mL, CT 11.4 ± 8.42 ng/mL, CC 14.3 ± 6.43 ng/mL; P = 0.007). Furthermore, Cmin,ss of the active moiety was significantly different among all ABCB1-G2677T/A genotypes (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The pharmacokinetics of risperidone and the ratio of risperidone to 9-OH-R were highly dependent on CYP2D6 activity. However, there was no significant effect in 9-OH-R. A future study involving a larger sample is required to verify whether CYP2D6 IMs have lower risperidone active moiety clearance than CYP2D6 NMs for LAI formulations. In addition, the risperidone active moiety was eliminated faster in ABCB1-G2677T/A and C3435T TT carriers receiving Risperdal Consta®.","Ma, Lingyue; Xiang, Qian; Zhao, Nan; Hu, Changqing; Fang, Meng; Tan, Yunlong; Chen, Song; Wang, Zining; Liu, Pinglan; Sun, Kaoxiang; Li, Youxin; Wu, Fuxi; Tian, Hongjun; Fang, Maosheng; Zhao, Xia; Wang, Gang; Cui, Yimin",Prog Neuropsychopharmacol Biol Psychiatry,202,16

This manifests as persistent chronic inflammation, immune activation or exhaustion that can promote the onset of co-morbidities. As the exact function of regulatory T (Treg) cells in HIV remains unclear, this cross-sectional study investigated three expression markers (Forkhead box protein P3 [FOXP3], glycoprotein A repetitions predominant [GARP], special AT-rich sequence binding protein 1 [SATB1]) and compared their expansion between CD4+CD25- and CD4+CD25++ T cells. Age-matched study subjects were recruited (Western Cape, South Africa) and sub-divided: HIV-negative subjects (n = 12), HIV-positive naïve treated (n = 22), HIV-positive treated based on CD4 count cells/µL (CD4 > 500 and CD4 < 500) (n = 34) and HIV-treated based on viral load (VL) copies/mL (VL < 1000 and VL > 1000) (n = 34). Markers of immune activation (CD38) and coagulation (CD142) on T cells (CD8) were assessed by flow cytometry together with FOXP3, GARP and SATB1 expression on CD4+CD25- and CD4+CD25++ T cells.

and an upswing in re‐empowered right‐wing extremism It is not surprising that interventionist measures and policy planning to deal with a “clear and present” crisis will always be broadly reactive in nature Ambitious calls to develop stronger strategic foresight and actively re‐shape the direction of Australia's foreign policy in a more future‐oriented way will tend to be overshadowed by immediate and urgent pressure and time constraints — in this case, namely actions to reduce the overall severity of the pandemic Unquestionably, a vari ty of circumstances did exert a strong gravitational push that disrupted the status quo in the Indo‐Pacific region and, as mentioned, acted to heighten and amplify a number of pre‐existing tensions and security dynamics Yet, as policy‐makers continued to grapple with uncertainty, predictions to understand the longer‐term consequences of the COVID‐19 epidemic, and associated second and third order effects, do remain highly speculative and range from a bleak and grim prognosis to a cautious optimism In this sense, the pandemic is characterised by a multiplicity of ambiguities The longer‐term impacts will be varied and nuanced: the realities of the twenty‐first century will continue to entail channels of contestation and opportunity;fragmentation and integration;conflict and co‐operation all operating along a slippery continuum At the very least, the pandemic underscored the significance of the political and intellectual struggle in which any reconstruction of foreign policy is involved As a starting point, the emerging challenges of COVID‐19 and its fallout did set in motion a series of urgent re‐evaluations on Australia's capacity to mitigate security escalation risks and related resilience perspectives as well as the counter‐productive undercurrents of self‐help instincts in international systems","Baldino, Daniel",Australian Journal of Politics and History,202,26

A COVID-19 foi detectada no Brasil pela primeira vez na 9ª semana epidemiológica de 2020 e o teste para o vírus SARS-CoV-2 foi incluído no protocolo de vigilância a partir da 12ª semana epidemiológica. O objetivo deste estudo foi investigar o padrão de hospitalizações por SRAG no país após a entrada do SARS-CoV-2, comparando o perfil temporal, etário e de resultados laboratoriais com os anos de 2010 a 2019. Em 2020, a hospitalização por SRAG, contabilizada desde a data do primeiro caso de COVID-19 confirmado até a 12ª semana, superou o observado, no mesmo período, em cada um dos 10 anos anteriores. A faixa etária acima de 60 anos foi a mais acometida, em nível acima do histórico. Houve um aumento considerável de testes laboratoriais negativos, sugerindo a circulação de um vírus diferente dos presentes no painel. Concluímos que o aumento das hospitalizações por SRAG, a falta de informação específica sobre o agente etiológico e a predominância de casos entre idosos, no mesmo período de tempo em que cresce o número de casos novos de COVID-19, é coerente com a hipótese de que os casos graves da doença já estejam sendo detectados pela vigilância de SRAG com sobrecarga para o sistema de saúde. A inclusão da testagem para SARS-CoV-2 no protocolo de vigilância de SRAG e sua efetiva implementação são de grande importância para acompanhar a evolução dos casos graves da doença no país.","Bastos, Leonardo Soares; Niquini, Roberta Pereira; Lana, Raquel Martins; Villela, Daniel A.

The mechanism of CVD graphene growth is governed by interactions in both the gas phase and at the surface. Here we present a simulation of the CVD graphene growth mechanism which includes thermodynamics, gas phase kinetics and the surface reaction in a sequential manner. The thermodynamic simulation shows that the deposition driving force is the greatest for high carbon to hydrogen ratios and reaches a maximum at around 850 °C. No graphene growth is observed below this temperature. The surface kinetic model also shows that below this temperature, the carbon surface concentration is less than the solubility limit, thus no film can grow. The effect of the reaction chamber geometry on the product concentrations was clear from the gas phase decomposition reactions. The gas residence times studied here (around 0.07 s) show that the optimum gas phase composition is far from that expected at thermodynamic equilibrium. The surface kinetics of CH4 reactions on Ni, Cu and Cu-Ni surfaces shows good agreement with the experimental results for different growth pressures (0.1 to 0.7 mbar), temperatures (600 to 1200 °C) and different Ni thicknesses (25-500 µm). Also, the model works well when substrates with various C solubilities are used. The thermodynamic and kinetic models described here can be used for the design of improved reactors to optimise the production of graphene with differing qualities, either single or multi-layer and sizes. More importantly, the transfer to a continuous process with a moving substrate should also be possible using the model if it is extended from 2D to 3D.","Al-Hilfi, Samir H; Derby, Brian; Martin, Philip A; Whitehead, J Christopher",Nanoscale (Online),202,1

However, to date none have addressed the impact of infection on severity of illness or the need for oxygen or ventilation. MethodsIn this prospective clinical cohort sub-study of the COG-UK consortium, 1475 samples from hospitalised and community cases collected between the 1st November 2020 and 30th January 2021 were collected. These samples were sequenced in local laboratories and analysed for the presence of B.1.1.7-defining mutations. We prospectively matched sequence data to clinical outcomes as the lineage became dominant in Scotland and modelled the association between B.1.1.7 infection and severe disease using a 4-point scale of maximum severity by 28 days: 1. no support, 2. oxygen, 3. ventilation and 4. death. Additionally, we calculated an estimate of the growth rate of B.1.1.7-associated infections following introduction into Scotland using phylogenetic data. ResultsB.1.1.7 was responsible for a third wave of SARS-CoV-2 in Scotland, and rapidly replaced the previously dominant second wave lineage B.1.177) due to a significantly higher transmission rate ([~]5 fold). Of 1475 patients, 364 were infected with B.1.1.7, 1030 with B.1.177 and 81 with other lineages. Our cumulative generalised linear mixed model analyses found evidence (cumulative odds ratio: 1.40, 95% CI: 1.02, 1.93) of a positive association between increased clinical severity and lineage (B.1.1.7 versus non-B.1.1.7). Viral load was higher in B.1.1.7 samples than in non-B.1.1.7 samples as measured by cycle threshold (Ct) value (mean Ct change: -2.46, 95% CI: -4.22, -0.70). ConclusionsThe B.1.1.7 lineage was associated with more severe clinical disease in Scottish patients than co-circulating lineages.

Given potential adverse financial and psychosocial effects of campus closures, many institutions developed strategies to reopen campuses in the fall 2020 semester despite the ongoing threat of COVID-19. However, many institutions opted to have limited campus reopening to minimize potential risk of spread of SARS-CoV-2. Objective: To analyze how Boston University (BU) fully reopened its campus in the fall of 2020 and controlled COVID-19 transmission despite worsening transmission in Boston, Massachusetts. Design, Setting, and Participants: This multifaceted intervention case series was conducted at a large urban university campus in Boston, Massachusetts, during the fall 2020 semester. The BU response included a high-throughput SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction testing facility with capacity to deliver results in less than 24 hours; routine asymptomatic screening for COVID-19; daily health attestations; adherence monitoring and feedback; robust contact tracing, quarantine, and isolation in on-campus facilities; face mask use; enhanced hand hygiene; social distancing recommendations; dedensification of classrooms and public places; and enhancement of all building air systems. Data were analyzed from December 20, 2020, to January 31, 2021. Main Outcomes and Measures: SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis confirmed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction of anterior nares specimens and sources of transmission, as determined through contact tracing. Results: Between August and December 2020, BU conducted more than 500â¯000 COVID-19 tests and identified 719 individuals with COVID-19, including 496 students (69.0%), 11 faculty (1.5%), and 212 staff (29.5%). Overall, 718 individuals, or 1.8% of the BU community, had test results positive for SARS-CoV-2. Of 837 close contacts traced, 86 individuals (10.3%) had test results positive for COVID-19. BU contact tracers identified a source of transmission for 370 individuals (51.5%), with 206 individuals (55.7%) identifying a non-BU source. Among 5 faculty and 84 staff with SARS-CoV-2 with a known source of infection, most reported a transmission source outside of BU (all 5 faculty members [100%] and 67 staff members [79.8%]). A BU source was identified by 108 of 183 undergraduate students with SARS-CoV-2 (59.0%) and 39 of 98 graduate students with SARS-CoV-2 (39.8%); notably, no transmission was traced to a classroom setting. Conclusions and Relevance: In this case series of COVID-19 transmission, BU used a coordinated strategy of testing, contact tracing, isolation, and quarantine, with robust management and oversight, to control COVID-19 transmission in an urban university setting.","Hamer, Davidson H; White, Laura F; Jenkins, Helen E; Gill, Christopher J; Landsberg, Hannah E; Klapperich, Catherine; Bulekova, Katia; Platt, Judy; Decarie, Linette; Gilmore, Wayne; Pilkington, Megan; MacDowell, Trevor L; Faria, Mark A; Densmore, Douglas; Landaverde, Lena; Li, Wenrui; Rose, Tom; Burgay, Stephen P; Miller, Candice; Doucette-Stamm, Lynn; Lockard, Kelly; Elmore, Kenneth; Schroeder, Tracy; Zaia, Ann M; Kolaczyk, Eric D; Waters, Gloria; Brown, Robert A",JAMA Netw Open,202,16

At the same time, the dissemination of contradictory model predictions has highlighted their limitations. If some parameters and/or state variables of a model cannot be determined from output measurements, its ability to yield correct insights - as well as the possibility of controlling the system - may be compromised. Epidemic dynamics are commonly analysed using compartmental models, and many variations of such models have been used for analysing and predicting the evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic. In this paper we survey the different models proposed in the literature, assembling a list of 36 model structures and assessing their ability to provide reliable information. We address the problem using the control theoretic concepts of structural identifiability and observability. Since some parameters can vary during the course of an epidemic, we consider both the constant and time-varying parameter assumptions. We analyse the structural identifiability and observability of all of the models, considering all plausible choices of outputs and time-varying parameters, which leads us to analyse 255 different model versions. We classify the models according to their structural identifiability and observability under the different assumptions and discuss the implications of the results. We also illustrate with an example several alternative ways of remedying the lack of observability of a model. Our analyses provide guidelines for choosing the most informative model for each purpose, taking into account the available knowledge and measurements.","Massonis, Gemma; Banga, Julio R; Villaverde, Alejandro F",Annual reviews in control,202,16

The number of people with ST- elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) has decreased during the pandemic and delays in the time looking for medical care have been reported. In addition, the diagnosis of ACS may have been difficult due to possible underlying myocarditis or other clinical entities. Regarding management of people with STEMI, although the superiority of primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) over thrombolysis is well established, the notable exposure risks due to absence of negative pressure in catheterization rooms and the increased difficulty in fine manipulation on guidewires under proper protection equipment may contribute to the relatively secondary role of PCI during the COVID-19 pandemic; thus, fibrinolytic therapy or robotic-assisted PCI in early presenting STEMI patients may have an alternative role during this period if prevention measures cannot be taken.

METHODOLOGY: This cross-sectional study was conducted among the health professionals (medical doctors, nurses, pharmacists, physiotherapists, hospital technicians and technologists) providing services at seven hospitals of Punjab province of Pakistan. A self-administered questionnaire was used to evaluate knowledge, attitude and practices regarding COVID-19. RESULTS: All of the participants (N = 429) reported that they were aware of COVID-19 and social media was the major source (65%) of this information. Mean knowledge score was 12 ± 2.1, with 75.5% of participants having satisfactory knowledge. Doctors were found to have significantly better knowledge scores than the other health professionals (p = 0.001). Mean attitude score was 8.0 ± 1.2, with a wide majority of health professionals (86.5%) having positive attitudes. Regarding preventive practices, around 64% reported of always covering nose and mouth with a tissue paper during sneezing or coughing and nearly 65% disposed of the dirty tissue paper in trash bin. Only 40% of the participants reported that 'if they do not have tissue, they cough or sneeze into upper sleeves'. Around 45% reported that they used face mask during their working hours in hospitals nowadays. Mean practice score was 23.3 ± 3.6, with 73.4% of health professionals having satisfactory practices.

In internal medicine, clinical rounds have always played an important role in education; however, the patient safety content taught at the point of care is not well studied. We studied, both quantitatively and qualitatively, the number and nature of patient safety messages delivered by attending physicians to determine what is taught at the point of care and how well this is recognised and recalled by attending physicians, residents and medical students. METHODS: This prospective mixed methods study was conducted on the medicine teaching service. Clinical rounds were audio-recorded. Immediately after rounds, attending physicians, residents and students completed a short survey card identifying the number and type of educational messages they immediately recalled teaching or hearing. Independent t-test was used to compare differences in the number of messages delivered by attendings and recalled by trainees. One-way analysis of variance was used to compare differences in messages delivered by attending physicians compared with trainees. Recordings were transcribed and analysed qualitatively for patient safety content. RESULTS: Trainees recalled more educational messages than attendings recalled teaching in all educational domains. Safety messages comprised 17.5% of educational messages. The average number of patient safety messages recalled per session was 1.08 per attending physicians, 1.84 per resident and 2.50 per student. Residents recalled 56.4% of safety messages delivered; students recalled 76.7% of safety messages. CONCLUSION: Patient safety is a focus of teaching during clinical rounds and provides meaningful opportunities to train students and residents to practice safe patient care.","Levine, Diane; Gadivemula, Jaya; Kutaimy, Raya; Kamatam, Srinivasa; Sarvadevabatla, Nagaratna; Lohia, Prateek",,202,1

Along with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), new and old cardiovascular injuries are important causes of significant morbidity and mortality in COVID-19. Exploring new approaches managing cardiovascular complications is essential in controlling the disease progression and preventing long-term complications. Oxytocin (OXT), an immune-regulating neuropeptide, has recently emerged as a strong candidate for treatment and prevention of COVID-19 pandemic. OXT carries special functions in immunologic defense, homeostasis and surveillance. It suppresses neutrophil infiltration and inflammatory cytokine release, activates T-lymphocytes, and antagonizes negative effects of angiotensin II and other key pathological events of COVID-19. Additionally, OXT can promote Î³-interferon expression to inhibit cathepsin L and increases superoxide dismutase expression to reduce heparin and heparan sulphate fragmentation. Through these mechanisms, OXT can block viral invasion, suppress cytokine storm, reverse lymphocytopenia, and prevent progression to ARDS and multiple organ failures. Importantly, besides prevention of metabolic disorders associated with atherosclerosis and diabetes mellitus, OXT can protect the heart and vasculature through suppressing hypertension and brain-heart syndrome, and promoting regeneration of injured cardiomyocytes. Unlike other therapeutic agents, exogenous OXT can be used safely without the side-effects seen in remdesivir and corticosteroid. Importantly, OXT can be mobilized endogenously to prevent pathogenesis of COVID-19. This article summarizes our current understandings of cardiovascular pathogenesis caused by COVID-19, explores the protective potentials of OXT against COVID-19-associated cardiovascular diseases, and discusses challenges in applying OXT in treatment and prevention of COVID-19.

There has been an attempt to move towards a paperless electronic system in many public healthcare facilities, but owing to lack of funding, this has been a challenge to achieve. During the current COVID-19 pandemic, the virus could be transmitted through the physical manipulation of patient records by various categories of staff who handle the records with or without gloves for protection. We discuss a digital option that has been partially used at Tygerberg Hospital (TBH), Cape Town, to avoid SARS-CoV-2 patient hard-copy record manipulation. It includes assignment of a QR code to every patient admitted as a person under investigation or confirmed COVID-19 case. The QR code is synced to one of the many free online medical notes smartphone applications (apps), which are password-protected with patient information privacy regulations (Trello is used at TBH), for daily medical notes review and editing. Upon discharge, all notes made during the patient's hospital stay, together with the discharge summary, are printed to generate a hard copy of notes for filing to avoid violation of the current national and provincial patient records policy. Doing this means that a patient will have a virtual online file through the designated app until discharge, when a physical file will be made for storage and safekeeping. It will keep physical manipulation of patient records to the minimum, and potentially assist in reducing transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus among healthcare workers.","Ntshalintshali, S; Mnqwazi, C",S Afr Med J,202,16

The online study was carried out during the first wave of the pandemic on a sample of 926 adults. Through cluster analysis, three groups of respondents were isolated: 1. People who fear a Covid-19 infection and follow the isolation rules (FFR), 2. People moderately afraid of the disease and following the rules loosely (MFFR), 3. People who are not afraid of the infection and do not follow the rules of isolation. (NFFR). The clusters were profiled with consideration of different aspects of eating behaviors as well as socio-demographic and economic features. The results of the study show a close relationship between the level of fear of contracting Covid-19 and the degree to which isolation rules are followed. These two factors were found to have a significant impact on eating behaviors, such as food purchases, eating patterns, and levels of consumption. It was stated that the FFR group changed their eating behaviors the most in terms of food purchasing, eating habits (excluding diversity and quality of diet), and food product consumption. The greatest stability in the majority of the analyzed areas of nutritional behaviors was observed in the MFFR cluster. The NFFR group shown the greatest decrease both in regularity and quality of their meals. This group also exhibited a significant increase in the consumption of alcoholic beverages. The results of the study can be useful in the decision making process when introducing restrictions or managing information. They also point to the need for extensive nutritional education focused on explaining the relationship between nutrition and health during a pandemic.","Kowalczuk, Iwona; Gebski, Jerzy",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),202,15

Early studies from Wuhan highlighted COVID-19-associated coagulopathy and a significant association with mortality was soon recognised. As research continues across the world, more evidence is emerging of the cross-talk between the innate immune system, coagulation activation and inflammation. Immunothrombosis has been demonstrated to play a key role in the pathophysiology of severe COVID-19, with extracellular histones and neutrophil extracellular traps detected in the plasma and cardiopulmonary tissues of critically ill patients. Targeting the components of immunothrombosis is becoming an important factor in the treatment of patients with COVID-19 infection. Recent studies report outcomes of intermediate and therapeutic anticoagulation in hospitalised patients with varying severities of COVID-19 disease, including optimal dosing and associated bleeding risks. Immunomodulatory therapies, including corticosteroids and IL-6 receptor antagonists, have been demonstrated to significantly reduce mortality in COVID-19 patients. As the pandemic continues, more studies are required to understand the driving factors and upstream mechanisms for coagulopathy and immunothrombosis in COVID-19, and thus potentially develop more targeted therapies for SARS-CoV-2 infection, both in the acute phase and in those who develop longer-term symptom burden.","Shaw, Rebecca J; Bradbury, Charlotte; Abrams, Simon T; Wang, Guozheng; Toh, Cheng-Hock",Br J Haematol,202,31

SARS-CoV-2 is a novel coronavirus responsible for the 2019 global pandemic of COVID-19 community acquired pneumonia. We have undertaken a randomized controlled trial to assess the efficacy and safety of COVID-19 convalescent plasma (CCP) in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: CONCOR-1 is an open-label, multicentre, randomized trial. Inclusion criteria include the following: patients > 16 years, admitted to hospital with COVID-19 infection, receiving supplemental oxygen for respiratory complications of COVID-19, and availability of blood group compatible CCP. Exclusion criteria are : onset of respiratory symptoms more than 12 days prior to randomization, intubated or imminent plan for intubation, and previous severe reactions to plasma. Consenting patients are randomized 2:1 to receive either approximately 500 mL of CCP or standard of care. CCP is collected from donors who have recovered from COVID-19 and who have detectable anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies quantified serologically. The primary outcome is intubation or death at day 30. Secondary outcomes include ventilator-free days, length of stay in intensive care or hospital, transfusion reactions, serious adverse events, and reduction in SARS-CoV-2 viral load. Exploratory analyses include patients who received CCP containing high titre antibodies. A sample size of 1200 patients gives 80% power to detect a 25% relative risk reduction assuming a 30% baseline risk of intubation or death at 30 days (two-sided test; &#945; = 0.05). An interim analysis and sample size re-estimation will be done by an unblinded independent biostatistician after primary outcome data are available for 50% of the target recruitment (n = 600). DISCUSSION: This trial will determine whether CCP will reduce intubation or death non-intubated adults with COVID-19. The trial will also provide information on the role of and thresholds for SARS-CoV-2 antibody titres and neutralization assays for donor qualification.

This paper builds on the concept of learning poverty and draws on axiomatic properties from social choice literature to propose and motivate a distribution-sensitive measures of learning poverty. Numerical, empirical, and practical reasons for the relevance and usefulness of these complementary inequality sensitive aggregations for simulating the effects of COVID-19 are presented. In a post-COVID-19 scenario of no remediation and low mitigation effectiveness for the effects of school closures, the simulations show that learning poverty increases from 53 to 63 percent. Most of this increase seems to occur in lower-middle-income and upper-middle-income countries, especially in East Asia and the Pacific, Latin America, and South Asia. The countries that had the highest levels of learning poverty before COVID-19 (predominantly in Africa and the low-income country group) might have the smallest absolute and relative increases in learning poverty, reflecting how great the learning crisis was in those countries before the pandemic. Measures of learning poverty and learning deprivation sensitive to changes in distribution, such as gap and severity measures, show differences in learning loss regional rankings. Africa stands to lose the most. Countries with higher inequality among the learning poor, as captured by the proposed learning poverty severity measure, would need far greater adaptability to respond to broader differences in student needs.","Azevedo, J.

Since both Influenza Like Illness (ILI) and COVID-19 case definitions overlap, we re-investigated the ILI cases using PCR for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in 739 nasopharyngeal swabs collected from November 2019 to March 2020. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was found in 37 samples (5%) collected mostly during February 2020. It was followed by confirmation of evolutionary and spatial relationships using next generation sequencing (NGS). We observed that the overall incidence of ILI cases during 2019-2020 influenza season was considerably higher than previous years and was gradually replaced with SARS-CoV-2, which indicated a silent transmission among ambulatory patients. Sequencing of representative isolates confirmed independent introductions and silent transmission earlier than previously thought. Evolutionary and spatial analyses revealed clustering in the GH clade, characterized by three amino acid substitutions in spike gene (D614G), RdRp (P323L) and NS3 (Q57H). P323L causes conformational change near nsp8 binding site that might affect virus replication and transcription. In conclusion, assessment of the community transmission among patients with mild COVID-19 illness, particularly those without epidemiological link for acquiring the virus, is of utmost importance to guide policy makers to optimize public health interventions. The detection of SARS-CoV-2 in ILI cases shows the importance of ILI surveillance systems and warrants its further strengthening to mitigate the ongoing transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The effect of NS3 substitutions on oligomerization or membrane channel function (intra- and extracellular) needs functional validation.","Alosaimi, Bandar; Naeem, Asif; Alghoribi, Majed F; Okdah, Lilian; Hamed, Maaweya E; AlYami, Ahmad S; Alotaibi, Athari; Enani, Mushira",Viruses,202,1

This comparative case study aims to assess whether electrically-induced seizures in electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) show sufficient similarities with spontaneous seizures to serve as a human epilepsy model. METHODS: We compared six EEG recordings, three ECT-induced seizures and three generalized tonic-clonic seizures, using quantitative electroencephalography (EEG) analyses. EEG recordings during and after ECT-sessions (under temporary sedation and muscle paralysis) were collected prospectively, whereas epilepsy data were selected retrospectively. Time-frequency representations, dominant ictal frequencies, and postictal alpha-delta ratios were calculated. RESULTS: In all EEG recordings, a decrease in dominant ictal frequency was observed, as well as postictal suppression. Postictal alpha-delta ratio indicated the same trend for all: a gradual increase from predominantly delta to alpha frequencies on timescales of hours after the seizure. Postictal spectral representation was similar. Muscle artifacts were absent in ECT-induced seizures and present in spontaneous seizures. Ictal amplitude was higher in epileptic than in ECT-induced seizures. Temporospectral ictal dynamics varied slightly between groups. SIGNIFICANCE: We show that ictal and postictal characteristics in ECT and patients with generalized tonic-clonic seizures are essentially similar. ECT-induced seizures may be used to investigate aspects of ictal and postictal states in a highly predictable manner and well-controlled environment. This suggests that clinical and electrophysiological observations during ECT may be extrapolated to epilepsy with generalized tonic-clonic seizures.","Pottkämper, Julia C M; Verdijk, Joey P A J; Hofmeijer, Jeannette; van Waarde, Jeroen A; van Putten, Michel J A M",,202,11

This stems from the heterogeneous response of individuals to disease and is reflected in the inter-individual variability of gene expression responses that obscures differential gene expression analysis. Here, we developed an alternative approach that could be applied to dissect the disease-associated molecular changes. We define gene ensemble noise as a measure that represents a variance for a collection of genes encoding for either members of known biological pathways or subunits of annotated protein complexes and calculated within an individual. The gene ensemble noise allows for the holistic identification and interpretation of gene expression disbalance on the level of gene networks and systems. By comparing gene expression data from COVID-19, H1N1, and sepsis patients we identified common disturbances in a number of pathways and protein complexes relevant to the sepsis pathology. Among others, these include the mitochondrial respiratory chain complex I and peroxisomes. This suggests a Warburg effect and oxidative stress as common hallmarks of the immune host-pathogen response. Finally, we showed that gene ensemble noise could successfully be applied for the prediction of clinical outcome namely, the mortality of patients. Thus, we conclude that gene ensemble noise represents a promising approach for the investigation of molecular mechanisms of pathology through a prism of alterations in the coherent expression of gene circuits.","de Jong, Tristan V; Guryev, Victor; Moshkin, Yuri M",Sci Rep,202,16

Many pregnant women who have symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection may not meet criteria for hospitalization; however, whether and how these women can be managed safely in outpatient setting is not well described. Methods: We sought to describe the time to symptom and viral clearance and to identify predictors of hospitalization to better understand the safety of monitoring pregnant patients with symptomatic COVID-19 in the outpatient setting. We performed a retrospective cohort study of pregnant patients with symptomatic, confirmed COVID-19 illness at a large, academic medical center. Patients had systematic telehealth follow up by a clinician team to assess for symptoms, provide virtual prenatal care, and arrange in-person visits when appropriate in a dedicated outpatient center. Data were collected via chart abstraction. Results: Of 180 pregnant patients presenting with symptoms and undergoing reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing, 67 patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection were identified during the study period. Nineteen (28%) required acute care given worsening of COVID-19 symptoms, and 95% of these were directed to this acute care setting due to symptom severity telehealth evaluation. Nine women (13%) were admitted to the hospital given worsening symptoms, 3 required intensive care unit care, 2 required ventilatory support, and 2 required delivery. Women with the presenting symptoms of fever, cough, shortness of breath, chest pain, or nausea and vomiting were more likely to require admission. The median duration from initial positive test to RT-PCR viral clearance was 26 days. Disease progression, time to viral clearance, and duration of symptoms did not vary significantly by trimester of infection. Conclusions: Management of the majority of pregnant women with symptomatic COVID-19 illness can be accomplished in the outpatient setting with intensive and protocol-driven monitoring for symptom progression.","Soffer, M D; Shook, L L; James, K; Sawyer, M R; Ciaranello, A; Mahrouk, R; Bernstein, S N; Boatin, A A; Edlow, A G; York-Best, C; Kaimal, A J; Goldfarb, I T",Open Forum Infect Dis,202,29

Health care workers are at risk of infection from aerosolisation of respiratory secretions, droplet and contact spread. There are a number of procedures that represent a high risk of aerosol generation during cardiothoracic surgery. It is important that adequate training, equipment and procedures are in place to reduce that risk. RECOMMENDATIONS: We provide a number of key recommendations, which reduce the risk of aerosol generation during cardiothoracic surgery and help protect patients and staff. These include general measures such as patient risk stratification, appropriate use of personal protective equipment, consideration to delay surgery in positive patients, and careful attention to theatre planning and preparation. There are also recommended procedural interventions during airway management, transoesophageal echocardiography, cardiopulmonary bypass, chest drain management and specific cardiothoracic surgical procedures. Controversies exist regarding the management of low risk patients undergoing procedures at high risk of aerosol generation, and recommendations for these patients will change depending on the regional prevalence, risk of community transmission and the potential for asymptomatic patients attending for these procedures. CHANGES IN MANAGEMENT AS A RESULT OF THIS STATEMENT: This statement reflects changes in management based on expert opinion, national guidelines and available evidence. Our knowledge with regard to COVID-19 continues to evolve and with this, guidance may change and develop. Our colleagues are urged to follow national guidelines and institutional recommendations regarding best practices to protect their patients and themselves.

We studied the clinical characteristics and therapies of severe cases in Jiangsu Province. METHODS: A multicenter retrospective cohort study was conducted to analyze clinical, laboratory data and treatment of 60 severe cases with COVID-19 infection in Jiangsu Province between January 24, 2020 and April 20, 2020. The improvement and deterioration subgroups were compared to identify predictors of disease progression. RESULTS: A total of 653 infected cases with COVID-19 were reported in Jiangsu Province, of which 60 severe cases were included in this study. Up until April 20, 2020, the mortality of severe patients was 0%. The median age was 57 years. The average body mass index of these patients was 25 kg/m². White blood cell counts decreased in 45.0% of patients, lymphopenia in 63.3%, thrombocytopenia in 13.3% and procalcitonin levels in 88.3% of the patients were less than 0.5 ng/mL. There were no statistically significant differences in immunoglobulin therapy and GCs therapy between the improvement and deterioration subgroups. Logistic regression analysis identified higher levels of troponin T (odds ratio [OR]: 1.04; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.00-1.08; Pâ¯=â¯0.04), antiviral therapy with aerosol inhalation of interferon (OR: 6.33; 95% CI: 1.18-33.98; Pâ¯=â¯0.03), and the application of non-invasive mechanical ventilation (OR: 1.99; 95%CI: 1.17-3.41; Pâ¯=â¯0.01) as predictors of disease progression, whereas higher lymphocyte count (OR: 0.11; 95% CI: 0.02-0.57; Pâ¯=â¯0.01) and early prone ventilation were associated with improvement (OR: 0.11; 95% CI: 0.01-0.98; Pâ¯=â¯0.04). CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 infection had a low mortality rate in Jiangsu Province, China. The higher levels of troponin T and lower lymphocyte count were predictors of disease progression. Early prone ventilation may be an effective treatment for severe cases.","Huang, Mao; Yang, Yi; Shang, Futai; Zheng, Yishan; Zhao, Wenjing; Luo, Liang; Han, Xudong; Lin, Aihua; Zhao, Hongsheng; Gu, Qing; Shi, Yi; Li, Jun; Xu, Xingxiang; Liu, Kexi; Deng, YiJun; Cao, Quan; Wang, Weiwei",Am J Med Sci,202,1

Cases with refractory pulmonary infiltration were discussed in this study.During hospitalization, chest CT scan and reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test were repeatedly performed. While drawing parallels to RT-PCR, the impact of delayed absorption of lung lesions on length of hospital stay (LOS) and medical expense was investigated. Features for delayed absorption of lung lesions were identified using cox proportional hazard regression model.Cases with delayed absorption of lung lesions had a prolonged LOS (18.00 ± 4.90 vs 9.25 ± 4.20, p &lt; 0.01) and increased medical expense (9124.55 ± 2421.31 vs 4923.88 ± 2218.56, p &lt; 0.01). Time interval from admission to a negative RT-PCR (ATN) was also prolonged (13.29 ± 4.72 vs 9.25 ± 4.20, p = 0.03). The cox proportional hazard regression model indicated that imported cases bore high risk of delayed absorption of lung lesions (hazard ratio = 2.54, 95% confidence interval 1.05, 6.11, p = 0.04). Sensitivity analysis revealed similar pattern (hazard ratio = 6.64, 95% confidence interval 1.62, 27.18, p = 0.01).Imported cases of COVID-19 were more likely to have refractory pulmonary infiltration, which subsequently prolongs LOS and increases medical expense.","Li, BinBin Hu WeiZhen Bao ChunMiao",Open Medicine,202,5

This meta-synthesis of COVID-19 lessons charts sustainable pandemic management in terms of choosing strategies that are situated in their contextual specifications and beginning preparations for future application of such strategies from now. To guide selection of a situated strategy, the paper provides a comprehensive list of epidemiological determinants (e.g. communicativeness, poverty, supply chain, density, wind, remoteness);consolidates knowledge about strategies of elimination, suppression and mitigation;and proposes a quantified SWOT analysis of epidemiological determinants that produces coordinates for strategy identification in a Cartesian plane divided into twelve strategy quarters. To guide prior preparations for future application of pandemic management strategies, the paper consolidates lessons learned in implementation of situated strategies and proposes preparations at the national level for elimination, at the local/community level for suppression, and at the regional level for mitigation.

In this article, we present the role of virtual social networks in shaping people's attitudes toward COVID-19 in Iran. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is an applied descriptive study, in which 1010 users of virtual social networks were surveyed through an electronic questionnaire. Data were analyzed with SPSS, Excel, and Rapid Miner software. The FP-growth technique was used to investigate the concurrence of choices in multiple-choice questions, and the Mann-Whitney and the Kruskal-Wallis tests were used to determine the correlation of the mean of each dimension with demographic data. Moreover, the Wilcoxon signed-rank, the Shapiro-Wilk, and the Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests were used. RESULTS: Virtual social networks use increased significantly (40%) after the COVID-19 outbreak. According to users, the greatest psychological impact of virtual social networks was the induction of anxiety (46.43%) and the most common use was to learn about COVID-19 prevention and treatment (69.3%). Based on the findings, there were no significant differences between the ""awareness,"" ""behavior intention,"" and ""attitude and trust"" and the users' marital status, age group, educational degree, and gender. CONCLUSION: Although social networks have enriched the public knowledge, they increased the individuals' anxiety mostly because of controversial news and disperse of misinformation which in turn misled the users. The social networks play an important role in directing the behavioral inclinations. Accordingly, it is recommended that the authorities in healthcare system establish authentic and formal webpage in these social networks to manage controversial and voluminous information.","Jahanbakhsh, M.; Bagherian, H.; Tavakoli, N.; Ehteshami, A.; Sattari, M.; Isfahani, S.

This work could bring information on its acceptance. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Transversal study with 253 individuals. A questionnaire was performed using Likert scale (1-very unsatisfied, 5-very satisfied) on patients with diabetes, hypertension and in subjects with other pathologies, whose consultations occurred between 01/04/2020 and 01/05/2020. Collected data included sociodemographics, previous telemedicine appointments, satisfaction levels of teleconsultation and doubt clarification, and interest in further telemedicine follow-up. In addition, a comparative analysis was performed between the periods January-February and April-May of 2020 in relation to age, sex, hypertension, diabetes and the type of contact (presential or remote). Statistics were performed using SPSS® and Excel®. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Diabetes follow-up appointments accounted for 34.4% of total consultations. Globally there was a high level of satisfaction and interest in future telemedicine follow-up. However, diabetic and older patients were less interested in this type of follow-up. Statistically significant differences about satisfaction were found in age, sex and presence/absence of diabetes. 70.6% of healthy patients preferred contact by e-mail over telephone. A selection bias is present because no randomization was made. The higher prevalence of diabetes consultations and the lack of adjustment for confounding factors can also affect results. Number of consults between January-February and April-May was compared and the main result was the significant reduction in the number of face-to-face consultations for diabetes (-50.1%) and hypertension (-94.1%). Presential consultations decreased by 72.6% and non-presential consultations increased by 61.9%. There was a selection bias because the sample was not random. The higher prevalence of diabetes consults and the lack of adjustment for confounders could affect results. CONCLUSIONS: This study allowed us to confirm the importance of telemedicine in primary health care, especially during pandemics. Participants recognized the usefulness of telemedicine and allowed future similar consultations.","Gomes-de Almeida, S; Marabujo, T; do Carmo-Gonçalves, M","SEMERGEN, Soc. Esp. Med. Rural Gen. (Ed.

At the same time, the proliferation of IoMT devices increases the potential for malicious activities that can lead to catastrophic results including theft of personal information, data breach, and compromised medical devices, putting human lives at risk. IoMT devices generate tremendous amount of data that reflect user behavior patterns including both personal and day-to-day social activities along with daily routine health monitoring. In this context, there are possibilities of anomalies generated due to various reasons including unexpected user behavior, faulty sensor, or abnormal values from malicious/compromised devices. To address this problem, there is an imminent need to develop a framework for securing the smart health care infrastructure to identify and mitigate anomalies. In this paper, we present an anomaly detection model for RPM utilizing IoMT and smart home devices. We propose Hidden Markov Model (HMM) based anomaly detection that analyzes normal user behavior in the context of RPM comprising both smart home and smart health devices, and identifies anomalous user behavior.

Of the serial pharmacokinetic investigations we designed to facilitate identifying LianhuaQingwen compounds that are likely to be therapeutically important, the current investigation focused on the component Glycyrrhiza uralensis roots (Gancao). Besides its function in COVID-19 treatment, Gancao is able to induce pseudoaldosteronism by inhibiting renal 11ß-HSD2. Systemic and colon-luminal exposure to Gancao compounds were characterized in volunteers receiving LianhuaQingwen and by in vitro metabolism studies. Access of Gancao compounds to 11ß-HSD2 was characterized using human/rat, in vitro transport, and plasma protein binding studies, while 11ß-HSD2 inhibition was assessed using human kidney microsomes. LianhuaQingwen contained a total of 41 Gancao constituents (0.01-8.56 µmol/day). Although glycyrrhizin (1), licorice saponin G2 (2), and liquiritin/liquiritin apioside (21/22) were the major Gancao constituents in LianhuaQingwen, their poor intestinal absorption and access to colonic microbiota resulted in significant levels of their respective deglycosylated metabolites glycyrrhetic acid (8), 24-hydroxyglycyrrhetic acid (M2D; a new Gancao metabolite), and liquiritigenin (27) in human plasma and feces after dosing. These circulating metabolites were glucuronized/sulfated in the liver and then excreted into bile. Hepatic oxidation of 8 also yielded M2D. Circulating 8 and M2D, having good membrane permeability, could access (via passive tubular reabsorption) and inhibit renal 11ß-HSD2. Collectively, 1 and 2 were metabolically activated to the pseudoaldosterogenic compounds 8 and M2D. This investigation, together with such investigations of other components, has implications for precisely defining therapeutic benefit of LianhuaQingwen and conditions for its safe use.","Lan, Xiao-Fang; Olaleye, Olajide E; Lu, Jun-Lan; Yang, Wei; Du, Fei-Fei; Yang, Jun-Ling; Cheng, Chen; Shi, Yan-Hong; Wang, Feng-Qing; Zeng, Xue-Shan; Tian, Nan-Nan; Liao, Pei-Wei; Yu, Xuan; Xu, Fang; Li, Ying-Fei; Wang, Hong-Tao; Zhang, Nai-Xia; Jia, Wei-Wei; Li, Chuan",Acta pharmacol.

In the face of the coronavirus disease-19 pandemic, we do not know whether patients with IBD will be more susceptible to infection or disease. We hypothesized that the viral entry molecules angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) are expressed in the intestine. We further hypothesized that their expression could be affected by inflammation or medication usage. METHODS: We examined the expression of Ace2 and Tmprss2 by quantitative polymerase chain reacion in animal models of IBD. Publicly available data from organoids and mucosal biopsies from patients with IBD were examined for expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2. We conducted RNA sequencing for CD11b-enriched cells and peripheral and lamina propria T-cells from well-annotated patient samples. RESULTS: ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were abundantly expressed in the ileum and colon and had high expression in intestinal epithelial cells. In animal models, inflammation led to downregulation of epithelial Ace2. Expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 was not increased in samples from patients with compared with those of control patients. In CD11b-enriched cells but not T-cells, the level of expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in the mucosa was comparable to other functional mucosal genes and was not affected by inflammation. Anti-tumor necrosis factor drugs, vedolizumab, ustekinumab, and steroids were linked to significantly lower expression of ACE2 in CD11b-enriched cells. CONCLUSIONS: The viral entry molecules ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are expressed in the ileum and colon. Patients with IBD do not have higher expression during inflammation; medical therapy is associated with lower levels of ACE2. These data provide reassurance for patients with IBD.","Burgueño, Juan F; Reich, Adrian; Hazime, Hajar; Quintero, Maria A; Fernandez, Irina; Fritsch, Julia; Santander, Ana M; Brito, Nivis; Damas, Oriana M; Deshpande, Amar; Kerman, David H; Zhang, Lanyu; Gao, Zhen; Ban, Yuguang; Wang, Lily; Pignac-Kobinger, Judith; Abreu, Maria T",Inflamm Bowel Dis,202,21

During the last few decades NMR (Nuclear Magnetic Resonance) spectroscopy has emerged as an intriguing structural biology instrument in the antiviral drug discovery field. OBJECTIVE: The review highlights how a variety of NMR-based tools can be employed to better understand viral machineries, develop anti-viral agents and set-up diagnostic and therapeutic routes. METHODS: Works summarized herein were searched through PubMed database and the Web. RESULTS: The review focuses on a subset of human viruses that have been largely studied through NMR techniques. Indeed, NMR solid- or solution-state methodologies allow to gain structural information on viral proteins and viral genomes either in isolation or bound to diverse binding partners. NMR data can be employed to set up structure-based approaches to design efficient antiviral agents inhibiting crucial steps of viral life cycle. In addition, NMR-based metabolomics analyses of biofluids from virus-infected patients let identify metabolites biomarkers of the disease and follow changes in metabolic profiles associated with antiviral therapy thus paving the way for novel diagnostic and therapeutic approaches.

Separate analyses evaluated changes in duration and dose of new treatment episodes focused on mean quarterly number of patients treated with buprenorphine and proportions of new treatment episodes &#8805;180 days long and with &#8805;16 mg/day. RESULTS: Between preexpansion and postexpansion, the mean quarterly number of patients taking buprenorphine increased by 93,300 in expansion states and by 84,960 in nonexpansion states.

We aimed to identify potential province-level socioeconomic determinants of the virus's dissemination, and explain between-province differences in the speed of its spread, based on data from 36 provinces of Northern Italy. METHODS: This is an ecological study. We included all confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 reported between February 24th and March 30th, 2020. For each province, we calculated the trend of contagion as the relative increase in the number of individuals infected between two time endpoints, assuming an exponential growth. Pearson's test was used to correlate the trend of contagion with a set of healthcare-associated, economic, and demographic parameters by province. The virus's spread was input as a dependent variable in a stepwise OLS regression model to test the association between rate of spread and province-level indicators. RESULTS: Multivariate analysis showed that the spread of COVID-19 was correlated negatively with aging index (p-value = 0.003), and positively with public transportation per capita (p-value = 0.012), the % of private long-term care hospital beds and, to a lesser extent (p-value = 0.070), the % of private acute care hospital beds (p-value = 0.006). CONCLUSION: Demographic and socioeconomic factors, and healthcare organization variables were found associated with a significant difference in the rate of COVID-19 spread in 36 provinces of Northern Italy. An aging population seemed to naturally contain social contacts. The availability of healthcare resources and their coordination could play an important part in spreading infection.","Buja, Alessandra; Paganini, Matteo; Cocchio, Silvia; Scioni, Manuela; Rebba, Vincenzo; Baldo, Vincenzo",PLoS One,202,20

Such major viral outbreaks demand early elucidation of taxonomic classification and origin of the virus genomic sequence, for strategic planning, containment, and treatment. This paper identifies an intrinsic COVID-19 virus genomic signature and uses it together with a machine learning-based alignment-free approach for an ultra-fast, scalable, and highly accurate classification of whole COVID-19 virus genomes. The proposed method combines supervised machine learning with digital signal processing (MLDSP) for genome analyses, augmented by a decision tree approach to the machine learning component, and a Spearman's rank correlation coefficient analysis for result validation. These tools are used to analyze a large dataset of over 5000 unique viral genomic sequences, totalling 61.8 million bp, including the 29 COVID-19 virus sequences available on January 27, 2020. Our results support a hypothesis of a bat origin and classify the COVID-19 virus as Sarbecovirus, within Betacoronavirus. Our method achieves 100% accurate classification of the COVID-19 virus sequences, and discovers the most relevant relationships among over 5000 viral genomes within a few minutes, ab initio, using raw DNA sequence data alone, and without any specialized biological knowledge, training, gene or genome annotations. This suggests that, for novel viral and pathogen genome sequences, this alignment-free whole-genome machine-learning approach can provide a reliable real-time option for taxonomic classification.","Randhawa, Gurjit S; Soltysiak, Maximillian P M; El Roz, Hadi; de Souza, Camila P E; Hill, Kathleen A; Kari, Lila",PLoS One,202,16

They not only cause serious human and animal deaths, but also cause serious public health problems worldwide. Currently, seven species are known to infect humans, namely SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43, and HCoV-HKU1. The coronavirus nonstructural protein 16 (NSP16) structure is similar to the 5'-end capping system of mRNA used by eukaryotic hosts and plays a vital role in evading host immunity response and protects the nascent viral mRNA from degradation. NSP16 is also well-conserved among related coronaviruses and requires its binding partner NSP10 to activate its enzymatic activity. With the continued threat of viral emergence highlighted by human coronaviruses and SARS-CoV-2, mutant strains continue to appear, affecting the highly conserved NSP16: this provides a possible therapeutic approach applicable to any novel coronavirus. To this end, current information on the 2'-O-MTase activity mechanism, the differences between NSP16 and NSP10 in human coronaviruses, and the current potential prevention and treatment strategies related to NSP16 are summarized in this review.","Chang, Li-Jen; Chen, Tsung-Hsien",Viruses,202,16

Each method has advantages and disadvantages but a direct comparison with different viral RNA concentrations has not been performed to assess the performance of these approaches. Here we compare Liverpool amplification, ARTIC amplification, and bait capture using clinical diagnostics samples. All libraries were sequenced using an Illumina MiniSeq with data analyzed using a standardized bioinformatics workflow (SARS-CoV-2 Illumina GeNome Assembly Line; SIGNAL). One sample showed poor SARS-CoV-2 genome coverage and consensus, reflective of low viral RNA concentration. In contrast, the second sample had a higher viral RNA concentration, which yielded good genome coverage and consensus. ARTIC amplification showed the highest depth of coverage results for both samples, suggesting this protocol is effective for low concentrations. Liverpool amplification provided a more even read coverage of the SARS-CoV-2 genome, but at a lower depth of coverage. Bait capture enrichment of SARS-CoV-2 cDNA provided results on par with amplification. While only two clinical samples were examined in this comparative analysis, both the Liverpool and ARTIC amplification methods showed differing efficacy for high and low concentration samples. In addition, amplification-free bait capture enriched sequencing of cDNA is a viable method for generating a SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence and for identification of amplification artifacts.","Nasir, Jalees A; Kozak, Robert A; Aftanas, Patryk; Raphenya, Amogelang R; Smith, Kendrick M; Maguire, Finlay; Maan, Hassaan; Alruwaili, Muhannad; Banerjee, Arinjay; Mbareche, Hamza; Alcock, Brian P; Knox, Natalie C; Mossman, Karen; Wang, Bo; Hiscox, Julian A; McArthur, Andrew G; Mubareka, Samira",Viruses,202,1

Many researchers carried out clinical epidemiological studies on patients with COVID-19 previously, but risk factors for patients with different levels of severity are still unclear. METHODS: 562 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 from 12 hospitals in China were included in this retrospective study. Related clinical information, therapies, and imaging data were extracted from electronic medical records and compared between patients with severe and non-severe status. We explored the risk factors associated with different severity of COVID-19 patients by logistic regression methods. RESULTS: Based on the guideline we cited, 509 patients were classified as non-severe and 53 were severe. The age range of whom was 5-87 years, with a median age of 47 (IQR 35.0-57.0). And the elderly patients (older than 60 years old) in non-severe group were more likely to suffer from fever and asthma, accompanied by higher level of D-dimer, red blood cell distribution width and low-density lipoprotein. Furthermore, we found that the liver and kidney function of male patients was worse than that of female patients in both severe and non-severe groups with different age levels, while the severe females had faster ESR and lower inflammatory markers. Of major laboratory markers in non-severe cases, baseline albumin and the lymphocyte percentage were higher, while the white blood cell and the neutrophil count were lower. In addition, severe patients were more likely to be accompanied by an increase in cystatin C, mean hemoglobin level and a decrease in oxygen saturation. Besides that, advanced age and indicators such as count of white blood cell, glucose were proved to be the most common risk factors preventing COVID-19 patients from aggravating. CONCLUSION: The potential risk factors found in our study have shown great significance to prevent COVID-19 patients from aggravating and turning to critical cases during treatment. Meanwhile, focusing on gender and age factors in groups with different severity of COVID-19, and paying more attention to specific clinical symptoms and characteristics, could improve efficacy of personalized intervention to treat COVID-19 effectively.","Wang, Juan; Guo, Shuzhen; Zhang, Yili; Gao, Kuo; Zuo, Jiacheng; Tan, Nannan; Du, Kangjia; Ma, Yan; Hou, Yong; Li, Quntang; Xu, Hongming; Huang, Jin; Huang, Qiuhua; Na, Hui; Wang, Jingwei; Wang, Xiaoyan; Xiao, Yanhua; Zhu, Junteng; Chen, Hong; Liu, Zhang; Wang, Mingxuan; Zhang, Linsong; Wang, Wei",PLoS One,202,26

The co-occurrence of the Dengue virus (DENV) and Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) has been into existence, but recently the co-infection of DENV and SARS-CoV-2 has been reported. Thus, the possibility of DENV, CHIKV, and SARS-CoV-2 co-infection could be predicted in the future with enhanced vulnerability. It is essential to elucidate the host interactors and the connected pathways to understand the biological insights. The in silico approach using Cytoscape was exploited to elucidate the common human proteins interacting with DENV, CHIKV, and SARS-CoV-2 during their probable co-infection. In total, 17 interacting host proteins were identified showing association with envelope, structural, non-structural, and accessory proteins. Investigating the functional and biological behaviour using PANTHER, UniProtKB, and KEGG databases uncovered their association with several cellular pathways including, signaling pathways, RNA processing and transport, cell cycle, ubiquitination, and protein trafficking. Withal, exploring the DrugBank and Therapeutic Target Database, total seven druggable host proteins were predicted. Among all integrin beta-1, histone deacetylase-2 (HDAC2) and microtubule affinity-regulating kinase-3 were targeted by FDA approved molecules/ drugs. Furthermore, HDAC2 was predicted to be the most significant target, and some approved drugs are available against it. The predicted druggable targets and approved drugs could be investigated to obliterate the identified interactions that could assist in inhibiting viral infection.","Ghildiyal, Ritu; Gabrani, Reema",Virusdisease,202,1

Suboptimal infection control practices have been identified as important risk factors. The objective of this study was to develop and validate a questionnaire to holistically assess the preventive practices of health care workers related to COVID-19 and identify the reasons for shortcomings therein. METHODS: The development of the questionnaire involved item generation through literature review, focus group discussions and in-depth interviews with health care workers and experts, followed by validation through expert opinion, pilot testing and survey. A cross-sectional survey on 147 healthcare workers was done using an online platform and/or interviews in August 2020 in New Delhi, India. Exploratory factor analysis using principal component extraction with varimax rotation was performed to establish construct validity. Internal consistency of the tool was tested using Cronbach's alpha coefficient. RESULTS: The developed questionnaire consists of two sections: Section A contains 29 items rated on a five-point Likert scale to assess preventive practices and Section B contains 27 semi-structured items to assess reasons for suboptimal practices. The first section has good validity (CVRâ¯=â¯0.87, S-CVI/Avâ¯=â¯0.978) and internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha coefficientâ¯=â¯0.85) CONCLUSIONS: This questionnaire is a valid and reliable tool for holistic assessment of preventive practices and barriers to it among health care workers. It will be useful to identify vulnerable practices and sections in health care settings which would assist policymakers in designing appropriate interventions for infection prevention and control. This will also be useful in future pandemics of similar nature.","Agarwal, Ayush; Ranjan, Piyush; Saikaustubh, Yellamraju; Rohilla, Priyanka; Kumari, Archana; Prasad, Indrashekhar; Baitha, Upendra; Dwivedi, Sada Nand",Indian J Med Microbiol,202,5

Based on the structure of the complex of the protein S receptor-binding domain (RBD) and ACE2, the design of chimeric molecules consisting of two 22-23-mer peptides linked to each other by disulfide bonds was carried out. The chimeric molecule X1 was a disulfide dimer, in which edge cysteine residues in the precursor molecules h1 and h2 were connected by the S-S bond. In the chimeric molecule X2, the disulfide bond was located in the middle of the molecule of each of the precursor peptides. The precursors h1 and h2 modelled amino acid sequences of &#945;1- and &#945;2-helices of the extracellular peptidase domain of ACE2, respectively, keeping intact most of the amino acid residues involved in the interaction with RBD. The aim of the work was to evaluate the binding efficiency of chimeric molecules and their RBD-peptides (particularly in dependence of the middle and edge methods of fixing the initial peptides h1 and h2). The proposed polypeptides and chimeric molecules were synthesized by chemical methods, purified (to 95-97% purity), and characterized by HPLC and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. The binding of the peptides to the SARS-CoV-2 RBD was evaluated by microthermophoresis with recombinant domains corresponding in sequence to the original Chinese (GenBank ID NC_045512.2) and the British (B. 1.1.7, GISAID EPI_ISL_683466) variants. Binding to the original RBD of the Chinese variant was detected in three synthesized peptides: linear h2 and both chimeric variants. Chimeric peptides were also bound to the RBD of the British variant with micromolar constants. The antiviral activity of the proposed peptides in Vero cell culture was also evaluated.","Bibilashvili, R Sh; Sidorova, M V; Dudkina, U S; Palkeeva, M E; Molokoedov, A S; Kozlovskaya, L I; Egorov, A M; Ishmukhametov, A A; Parfyonova, Ye V",Biomed Khim,202,30

However, information from United States cohorts is limited. Understanding predictors of admission and critical illness in these patients is essential to guide prevention and risk stratification strategies. METHODS: This was a retrospective, registry-based cohort study including all patients presenting to Rush University Medical Center in Chicago, Illinois, with COVID-19 from March 4, 2020 to June 21, 2020. Demographic, clinical, laboratory, and treatment data were obtained from the registry and compared between hospitalized and nonhospitalized patients as well as those with critical illness. We used logistic regression modeling to explore risk factors associated with hospitalization and critical illness. RESULTS: A total of 8,673 COVID-19 patients were included in the study, of whom 1,483 (17.1%) were admitted to the hospital and 528 (6.1%) were admitted to the intensive care unit. Risk factors for hospital admission included advanced age, male sex (odds ratio [OR] = 1.69, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.44 to 1.98), Hispanic/Latino ethnicity (OR = 1.52, 95% CI = 1.18 to 1.92), hypertension (OR = 1.77, 95% CI = 1.46 to 2.16), diabetes mellitus (OR = 1.84, 95% CI = 1.53 to 2.22), prior CVA (OR = 3.20, 95% CI = 1.99 to 5.14), coronary artery disease (OR = 1.45, 95% CI = 1.03 to 2.06), heart failure (OR = 1.79, 95% CI = 1.23 to 2.61), chronic kidney disease (OR = 2.60, 95% CI = 1.77 to 3.83), end-stage renal disease (OR = 2.22, 95% CI = 1.12 to 4.41), cirrhosis (OR = 2.03, 95% CI = 1.42 to 2.91), fever (OR = 1.43, 95% CI = 1.19 to 1.71), and dyspnea (OR = 4.53, 95% CI = 3.75 to 5.47).

Relevant vulnerabilities to COVID-19 in people who suffer substance use disorders are described in previous communications. The COVID-19 pandemic offers a unique opportunity to reshape and update addiction treatment networks. MAIN BODY: Renewed treatment systems should be based on these seven pillars: (1) telemedicine and digital solutions, (2) hospitalization at home, (3) consultation-liaison psychiatric and addiction services, (4) harm-reduction facilities, (5) person-centered care, (6) promote paid work to improve quality of life in people with substance use disorders, and (7) integrated addiction care. The three ""best buys"" of the World Health Organization (reduce availability, increase prices, and a ban on advertising) are still valid. Additionally, new strategies must be implemented to systematically deal with (a) fake news concerning legal and illegal drugs and (b) controversial scientific information.

On April 2, when 19 cases had been confirmed among facility A employees, enhanced testing for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, was implemented, so that any employee with a COVID-19-compatible sign or symptom (e.g., fever, cough, or shortness of breath) could receive a test from a local health care facility. By April 11, 369 COVID-19 cases had been confirmed among facility A employees; on April 12, facility A began a phased closure* and did not reopen during the period of investigation (March 16-April 25, 2020). At the request of SDDOH, a CDC team arrived on April 15 to assist with the investigation. During March 16-April 25, a total of 929 (25.6%) laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases were diagnosed among 3,635 facility A employees. At the outbreak's peak, an average of 67 cases per day occurred.

Those communities in rural areas, where health and communication infrastructure are often limited, face additional challenges in keeping individuals informed, safe, and healthy. Moreover, the amount of misleading information circulating is making it even more difficult to convey critical and rapidly evolving public health recommendations. Michigan Technological University is located in Michigan's rural Upper Peninsula which accounts for 30% of the State's land mass but only 3% of the total population. Our goal was to increase campus and community awareness about COVID-19 and its impact on health and society. For our rural community, we offered a 1) COVID-19 public town hall series and 2) COVID-19 university wide academic course. The public town hall series was delivered weekly and broadcasted live through a webinar (Zoom), social media, and local radio. Each week a speaker panel consisting of public health officials, clinicians, educators, and/or other local experts discussed a COVID-19 topic theme and answered questions from the community. The academic course was presented as a 1-credit seminar-based online course open to any student. Each week students explored a COVID-19 related topic, participated in the weekly town hall, and engaged in follow-up discussion and reflection. Primary course learning objectives were for students to locate credible COVID-19 information sources and describe what is known about the general health impacts of the disease. Twelve public town halls, that included more than 35 different presenters, were delivered. Number of attendees on the Zoom webinars ranged between 20-75 individuals with many others interacting with content through social media, radio, and the recorded content. Town hall themes included the role of public health to protect community health, impact of disease on physical and mental health, health disparities, mechanisms to interrupt and halt transmission, and strategies for adapting to lifestyle changes. Undergraduate and graduate students (n=37) from a variety of majors (biology, exercise science, chemistry, engineering, business, forestry) enrolled in the course. Nearly all students (96%) reported that the course increased their awareness about COVID-19 and the majority (61%) indicated that the course was the most effective way to obtain COVID-19 related information. All students recommended that other students take this course in the future. The public town hall series provided a robust platform to deliver critical, real-time health information to our campus and broader community during the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, students perceived that the academic course increased their awareness of COVID-19. Increased public health messaging is a critical step to keeping Michigan's rural Upper Peninsula informed, safe, and healthy during the COVID-19 pandemic and may serve as a model for other rural university-community partnerships.","Elmer, Steven Lytle Lydia Kamm Kelly",The FASEB Journal,202,16

We aimed to assess risk factors associated with ICH in this population. We performed a retrospective cohort study of adult patients admitted to NYU Langone Health system between March 1 and April 27 2020 with a positive nasopharyngeal swab polymerase chain reaction test result and presence of primary nontraumatic intracranial hemorrhage or hemorrhagic conversion of ischemic stroke on neuroimaging. Patients with intracranial procedures, malignancy, or vascular malformation were excluded. We used regression models to estimate odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals (OR, 95% CI) of the association between ICH and covariates. We also used regression models to determine association between ICH and mortality. Among 3824 patients admitted with COVID-19, 755 patients had neuroimaging and 416 patients were identified after exclusion criteria were applied.

However, risk factors for COVID-19 disease in patients with kidney transplants remain poorly defined. METHODS: We enrolled patients who underwent kidney transplantation and were actively followed up in two hospitals in Paris on March 1st, 2020. Patients were screened for baseline and transplant characteristics, functional parameters, comorbidities, and immunosuppressive therapies. COVID-19 disease was assessed. Patients were followed up during the pandemic until April 30th, 2020 by the COVID-19 SLS KT survey program, including teleconsulting, at-home monitoring for patients with COVID-19, and a dedicated phone hotline platform. RESULTS: Among 1216 patients with kidney transplants enrolled, 66 (5%) patients were identified with COVID-19 disease, which is higher than the incidence observed in the general population in France (0.3%). Their mean age was 56.4±12.5 years, and 37 (56%) patients were men. The following factors were independently associated with COVID-19 disease: non-White ethnicity (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 2.17; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.23 to 3.78; P=0.007), obesity (OR, 2.19; 95% CI, 1.19 to 4.05; P=0.01), asthma and chronic pulmonary disease (OR, 3.09; 95% CI, 1.49 to 6.41; P=0.002), and diabetes (OR, 3.33; 95% CI, 1.92 to 5.77; P<0.001). The mortality rate related to COVID-19 disease was 1% in the overall study population and 24% in COVID-19-positive patients. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with kidney transplants display a high risk of mortality. Non-White ethnicity and comorbidities such as obesity, diabetes, asthma, and chronic pulmonary disease were associated with higher risk of developing COVID-19 disease.

A model system for understanding these dynamics is the microbial assemblage that inhabits the cup-shaped leaves of the pitcher plant Sarracenia purpurea. With enrichment of organic matter, this system flips within three days from an oxygen-rich state to an oxygen-poor state. In a replicated greenhouse experiment, we enriched pitcher-plant leaves at different rates with bovine serum albumin (BSA), a molecular substitute for detritus. Changes in dissolved oxygen (DO) and undigested BSA concentration were monitored during enrichment and recovery phases. With increasing enrichment rates, the dynamics ranged from clockwise hysteresis (low), to environmental tracking (medium), to novel counter-clockwise hysteresis (high). These experiments demonstrate that detrital enrichment rate can modulate a diversity of hysteretic responses within a single aquatic ecosystem, and suggest different management strategies may be needed to mitigate the effects of high vs. low rates of detrital enrichment.","Northrop, Amanda C; Avalone, Vanessa; Ellison, Aaron M; Ballif, Bryan A; Gotelli, Nicholas J",,202,24

MATERIAL AND METHODS: From January 16, 2020 to March 28, 2020, among the 568 cases of COVID-19 patients diagnosed in Xiaogan Central Hospital, 64 cases of COVID-19 patients with diabetes were selected as the diabetic group, and 64 cases of COVID-19 patients with age and gender matching without diabetes were selected as the non-diabetic group, and their clinical data and pulmonary CT characteristics were retrospectively analysed. RESULTS: Compared with the non-diabetic group, the proportion of patients in the diabetic group with chronic underlying disease was higher, and they were in more a serious condition at admission. Inflammation index and characteristics of glycolipid metabolism results showed that COVID-19 patients with diabetes mellitus were more likely to have elevated inflammatory markers and hypercoagulability, accompanied by hypoproteinaemia and glucose and lipid metabolism disorders. Treatment and clinic outcome results showed that the time of nucleic acid turning negative in the diabetic group was significantly longer than that in the non-diabetic group. Radiological data showed that COVID-19 combined with diabetes prolonged the time of detoxification in patients. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 patients with diabetes mellitus and chronic hypertension are associated with increased inflammatory markers and disorders of glucose and lipid metabolism. These patients tend to develop serious diseases, especially the rapid progression of CT lesions in the lungs of patients with a wide range ofinvolvement, and prolonged absorption and detoxification time.","Yan, Yimin; Yang, Fang; Zhu, Xinxin; Wang, Min; Sun, Zhibing; Zhao, Tao; Yang, Xiaohong; Zou, Yi",Endokrynol Pol,202,29

Hence, there is an urgent need for rapid, simple, and accurate tests to diagnose severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Performance characteristics of the rapid SARS-CoV-2 antigen detection test should be evaluated and compared with the gold standard real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test for diagnosis of COVID-19 cases. METHODS: The rapid SARS-CoV-2 antigen detection test, Standard&#8482; Q COVID-19 Ag kit (SD Biosensor®, Republic of Korea), was compared with the real-time RT-PCR test, Allplex&#8482; 2019-nCoV Assay (Seegene®, Korea) for detection of SARS-CoV-2 in respiratory specimens. Four hundred fifty-four respiratory samples (mainly nasopharyngeal and throat swabs) were obtained from COVID-19 suspected cases and contact individuals, including pre-operative patients at Siriraj Hospital, Bangkok, Thailand during March-May 2020. RESULTS: Of 454 respiratory samples, 60 (13.2%) were positive, and 394 (86.8%) were negative for SARS-CoV-2 RNA by real-time RT-PCR assay. The duration from onset to laboratory test in COVID-19 suspected cases and contact individuals ranged from 0 to 14 days with a median of 3 days. The rapid SARS-CoV-2 antigen detection test's sensitivity and specificity were 98.33% (95% CI, 91.06-99.96%) and 98.73% (95% CI, 97.06-99.59%), respectively. One false negative test result was from a sample with a high real-time RT-PCR cycle threshold (Ct), while five false positive test results were from specimens of pre-operative patients. CONCLUSIONS: The rapid assay for SARS-CoV-2 antigen detection showed comparable sensitivity and specificity with the real-time RT-PCR assay. Thus, there is a potential use of this rapid and simple SARS-CoV-2 antigen detection test as a screening assay.","Chaimayo, Chutikarn; Kaewnaphan, Bualan; Tanlieng, Nattaya; Athipanyasilp, Niracha; Sirijatuphat, Rujipas; Chayakulkeeree, Methee; Angkasekwinai, Nasikarn; Sutthent, Ruengpung; Puangpunngam, Nattawut; Tharmviboonsri, Theerawoot; Pongraweewan, Orawan; Chuthapisith, Suebwong; Sirivatanauksorn, Yongyut; Kantakamalakul, Wannee; Horthongkham, Navin",Virol J,202,18

The lockdown measures during the epidemic may have an impact on the presentation of diabetes and may disturb metabolic control. OBJECTIVES: In order to address the hypothesis that the COVID-19 lockdown affected the incidence rate (IR) of type 1 diabetes (T1D) in the pediatric population of Lower Silesia and the patients' clinical status, the incidence of T1D during the COVID-19 pandemic was analyzed. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Incidence estimates were obtained from the T1D pediatric registry for Lower Silesia which has been maintained since January 1, 2000. The observation was completed on April 30, 2020. RESULTS: A total of 1961 cases were diagnosed (1054 boys, 53.72%). An increase in the T1D IR was observed, from 10.43/100,000/year in 2000 to 22.06/100,000/year in 2019. The seasonality of T1D incidence was also observed, with the highest IR appearing in January and February. There were half as many cases of T1D in March and April 2020 as in the same months in 2019 (p > 0.05). Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) occurred in 31.75% of patients in years 2000-2019, comparably (p > 0.05) to 2020 (36.67% patients), including March and April (50% of patients). The duration of hyperglycemia symptoms was 20.2 ±25.4 days, which was comparable to 2020 (13.1 ±10.96 days; p = 0.1675) and March and April of 2020 (9.67 ±5.63 days; p = 0.0831).

The ideal building material should be (1) versatile and controllable in shape and stoichiometry, (2) spontaneously self-assemble, and (3) thermodynamically, chemically, and enzymatically stable with a long shelf life. RNA building blocks exhibit each of the above. RNA is a polynucleic acid, making it a polymer, and its negative-charge prevents nonspecific binding to negatively charged cell membranes. The thermostability makes it suitable for logic gates, resistive memory, sensor set-ups, and NEM devices. RNA can be designed and manipulated with a level of simplicity of DNA while displaying versatile structure and enzyme activity of proteins. RNA can fold into single-stranded loops or bulges to serve as mounting dovetails for intermolecular or domain interactions without external linking dowels. RNA nanoparticles display rubber- and amoeba-like properties and are stretchable and shrinkable through multiple repeats, leading to enhanced tumor targeting and fast renal excretion to reduce toxicities. It was predicted in 2014 that RNA would be the third milestone in pharmaceutical drug development. The recent approval of several RNA drugs and COVID-19 mRNA vaccines by FDA suggests that this milestone is being realized.

We hypothesized that azithromycin is superior to SXT for UFI treatment, but the drugs are non-inferior to each other for culture-confirmed enteric fever treatment. METHODS: We conducted a double blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of azithromycin (20 mg/kg/day) or SXT (trimethoprim 10 mg/kg/day + sulfamethoxazole 50 mg/kg/day) orally for 7 days for UFI treatment in Nepal. We enrolled patients (aged 3-64 years) presenting to two Kathmandu hospitals with temperature &#8805; 38.0°C for &#8805;4 days without localising signs. The primary endpoint was fever clearance time (FCT); secondary endpoints were treatment failure and adverse events. ClinicalTrials.gov number: NCT02773407. RESULTS: From June 2016 to May 2019, we randomized 326 participants (163 in each arm); 87 (26.7%) had blood culture-confirmed enteric fever. In all participants, the median FCT was 2.7 days (95% CI 2.6-3.3) in the SXT arm and 2.1 days (95% CI 1.6-3.2) in the azithromycin arm 1.25 (95% CI 0.99-1.58, P=0.059). The hazard ratio of treatment failures by 28 days between azithromycin and SXT was 0.62 (95% CI 0.37-1.05, p=0.073). Planned sub-group analysis showed azithromycin resulted in faster FCT in those with sterile blood cultures and less relapses in culture-confirmed enteric fever. Nausea, vomiting, constipation, and headache were more common in the SXT arm. CONCLUSIONS: Despite similar FCT and treatment failure in the two arms, significantly fewer complications and relapses make azithromycin a better choice for empirical treatment of UFI in Nepal.","Giri, Abhishek; Karkey, Abhilasha; Dangol, Sabina; Arjyal, Amit; Pokharel, Sunil; Rijal, Samita; Gajurel, Damodar; Sharma, Rabi; Lamsal, Kamal; Shrestha, Pradip; Prajapati, Gayatri; Pathak, Saruna; Shrestha, Sita Ram; K C, Raj Kumar; Pandey, Sujata; Thapa, Abishkar; Shrestha, Nistha; Thapa, Raj Kumar; Poudyal, Buddhi; Phuong, Dung Nguyen Thi; Baker, Stephen; Kestelyn, Evelyne; Geskus, Ronald; Thwaites, Guy; Basnyat, Buddha",Clin. infect. dis,202,1

Factors associated with nonadherence to PPRF intervention were identified using multivariate logistic regression analysis. Results: In total, 2466 instances of PPRF in 1714 cases between April 2014 and September 2019 were found. The nonadherence rate was 5.9%, and 44 cases were found in which carbapenems or piperacillin/tazobactam continued to be used against PPRF recommendations. Factors associated with nonadherence to PPRF recommendations were a previous history of hospitalization within 90 days (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 2.62; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.18-5.81) and a rapidly fatal McCabe score at the time of PPRF intervention (aOR, 2.87; 95% CI, 1.18-6.98). A review of the narrative comments in the electronic medical records indicated that common reasons for nonadherence were ""the patient was sick"" (nâ =â 12; 27.3%) and ""the antimicrobial seemed to be clinically effective"" (nâ =â 9; 20.5%). Conclusions: Nonadherence to PPRF recommendations was relatively uncommon at the study institution. However, patients with a severe disease condition frequently continued to receive broad-spectrum antimicrobials against PPRF recommendations. Understanding physicians' cognitive process in nonadherence to ASP recommendations and ASP interventions targeting medical subspecialties caring for severely ill patients is needed to improve ASP.","Takamatsu, Akane; Yao, Kenta; Murakami, Shutaro; Tagashira, Yasuaki; Hasegawa, Shinya; Honda, Hitoshi",Open Forum Infect Dis,202,16

Serological antibody testing is an important diagnostic method used increasingly in clinics, although its clinical application is still under investigation. METHODS: A meta-analysis was conducted to compare the diagnostic performance of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 antibody tests in patients with COVID-19. The test results analysed included: (1) IgM-positive but IgG-negative (IgM+IgG-); (2) IgG-positive but IgM-negative (IgG+IgM-); (3) both IgM-positive and IgG-positive (IgM+IgG+); (4) IgM-positive without IgG information (IgM+IgG+/-); (5) IgG-positive without IgM information (IgG+IgM+/-); (6) either IgM-positive or IgG-positive (IgM+ or IgG+); and (7) IgA-positive (IgA+). RESULTS: Sixty-eight studies were included. Pooled sensitivities for IgM+IgG-, IgG+IgM-, IgM+IgG+, IgM+IgG+/-, IgG+IgM+/-, and IgM+ or IgG+ were 6%, 7%, 53%, 68%, 73% and 79% respectively. Pooled specificities ranged from 98% to 100%. IgA+ had a pooled sensitivity of 78% but a relatively low specificity of 88%. Tests conducted 2 weeks after symptom onset showed better diagnostic accuracy than tests conducted earlier. Chemiluminescence immunoassay and detection of S protein as the antigen could offer more accurate diagnostic results. DISCUSSION: These findings support the supplemental role of serological antibody tests in the diagnosis of COVID-19. However, their capacity to diagnose COVID-19 early in the disease course could be limited.","Chen, Mengyu; Qin, Rundong; Jiang, Mei; Yang, Zhaowei; Wen, Weiping; Li, Jing",Int J Infect Dis,202,4

It forms the first line of contact with the human cell. The FDA-approved drugs and phytochemicals from Indian medicinal plants were explored. Molecular docking and simulations of these molecules targeting the ACE2-Spike complex were performed. Rutin DAB10 and Swertiapuniside were obtained as the top-scored drugs as per the docking protocol. The MD simulations of ligand-free, Rutin DAB10-bound, and Swertiapuniside-bound ACE2-Spike complex revealed abrogation of the hydrogen bonding network between the two proteins. The principal component and dynamic cross-correlation analysis pointed out conformational changes in both the proteins unique to the ligand-bound systems. The interface residues, His34, and Lys353 from ACE2 and Arg403, and Tyr495 from the Spike protein formed significant strong interactions with the ligand molecules, inferring the inhibition of ACE2-Spike complex. Few novel interactions specific to Rutin-DAB10 and Swertiapuniside were also identified. The conformational flexibility of the drug-binding pocket was captured using the RMSD-based clustering of the ligand-free simulations. Ensemble docking was performed wherein the FDA-approved database and phytochemical dataset were docked on each of the cluster representatives of the ACE2-Spike. The phytochemicals identified belonged to Withania somnifera, Swertia chirayita, Tinospora cordifolia and Rutin DAB10, fulvestrant, elbasvir from FDA.

METHODS: In this retrospective, nationwide cohort study, we included 5621 patients who had been discharged from isolation or died from COVID-19 by 30 April 2020. The mortality rate and admission rate to intensive care unit (ICU) were compared between initially asymptomatic and symptomatic patients. We established a prediction model for patient mortality through risk factor analysis among initially asymptomatic patients. RESULTS: The prevalence of initially asymptomatic patients upon admission was 25.8%. The mortality rates were not different between groups (3.3% vs. 4.5%, p = .17). However, initially symptomatic patients were more likely to receive ICU care compared to initially asymptomatic patients (4.1% vs. 1.0%, p < .0001). The age-adjusted Charlson comorbidity index score (CCIS) was the most potent predictor for patient mortality in initially asymptomatic patients. CONCLUSIONS: The mortality risk was not determined by the initial presence of symptom among hospitalized COVID-19 patients. The CCIS was the most potent predictors for mortality. The clinicians should predict the risk of death by evaluating age and comorbidities but not the initial presence of symptom. Key messages The mortality rate was not different between initially asymptomatic and symptomatic patients. Symptomatic patients were more likely to admitted to the intensive care unit.

Objective The aims of this study were to determine the prevalence and preventability of hospital admissions to a geriatric ward related to ADEs, to identify medications involved in these ADEs and to describe potential preventability aspects of ADE-related admissions. Setting University Hospital Hradec Králové, Czech Republic. Methods This cross-sectional study evaluated acute hospital admissions to the geriatric ward of University Hospital Hradec Králové over a period of nine months (April-December 2017). Medication reviews were performed in order to identify ADE-related hospital admissions. Causality was assessed using the World Health Organization-Uppsala Monitoring Centre criteria. Modified Schumock-Thornton algorithm was used to assess the preventability of ADEs. Main outcome measure 9-month-prevalence of ADE-related hospital admissions. Results A total of 366 hospital admissions were included. The 9-month-prevalence of ADE-related hospital admissions was 11.75% [95% confidence interval 8.45-15.05]. Antithrombotic agents and diuretics represented the most common medication classes associated with ADEs (30.2% each). Electrolyte disturbances and gastrointestinal haemorrhages and ulcerations were the most frequently observed ADEs associated with hospital admission. Out of 43 ADE-related hospitalisations, 23 (53.5%) were considered potentially preventable. Conclusion The contribution of ADEs to hospital admission to the geriatric ward was not negligible. Our results also suggest that 53.5% of identified ADE-related admissions could be potentially prevented. This finding demonstrates just how important the research on the preventability of medication-related hospitalisations is.

In total, 53 COVID-19 patients admitted to the designated Beijing Xiaotangshan Hospital between March 16 and April 15 of 2020 were included. Based on the percentage of disease aggravation during hospital stay according to CT, the patients were divided into two groups: &#8804;40 years (group A; n = 41) and >40 years (group B; n = 12). The demographic data, epidemiological history, disease courses, potential complications, clinical symptoms, lab indices, chest CT outcomes, treatment protocols and turnovers of the two groups were compared. According to clinical typing, compared with group A, group B had a significantly greater proportion of the common type of COVID-19 (P<0.05) and greater comorbidity of type 2 diabetes (P<0.001). The two groups presented significantly different lab indices. Group B showed significantly more frequent CT abnormalities, with greater proportions of multiple lesions and bilateral lung involvement (P<0.05). During hospitalization, group B had a greater proportion of disease aggravation according to CT (P<0.01). Compared with group A, group B received a significantly greater proportion of antiviral therapy and presented a significantly greater occurrence of adverse drug reactions (P<0.05). The two groups did not significantly differ in time from admission to clinical symptom improvement or from disease onset to negative outcomes according to nucleic acid testing, the appearance of IgG or the appearance of IgM. They also did not significantly differ in length of stay. Older imported COVID-19 patients, particularly those with type 2 diabetes, showed a broader pulmonary extent and faster development of the disease, more severe pathogenetic conditions and a greater risk of developing a critically severe type. Increased attention should be given to this population in clinical practice.","Han, Yujuan; Luo, Zujin; Zhai, Wenliang; Zheng, Yue; Liu, Huan; Wang, Yanran; Wu, Endong; Xiong, Fang; Ma, Yingmin",PLoS One,202,24

These mutations can affect viral properties such as infectivity and immune resistance. Although the sensitivity of naturally occurring SARS-CoV-2 variants to humoral immunity has been investigated, sensitivity to human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-restricted cellular immunity remains largely unexplored. Here, we demonstrate that two recently emerging mutations in the receptor-binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, L452R (in B.1.427/429 and B.1.617) and Y453F (in B.1.1.298), confer escape from HLA-A24-restricted cellular immunity. These mutations reinforce affinity toward the host entry receptor ACE2. Notably, the L452R mutation increases spike stability, viral infectivity, viral fusogenicity, and thereby promotes viral replication. These data suggest that HLA-restricted cellular immunity potentially affects the evolution of viral phenotypes and that a further threat of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is escape from cellular immunity.","Motozono, Chihiro; Toyoda, Mako; Zahradnik, Jiri; Saito, Akatsuki; Nasser, Hesham; Tan, Toong Seng; Ngare, Isaac; Kimura, Izumi; Uriu, Keiya; Kosugi, Yusuke; Yue, Yuan; Shimizu, Ryo; Ito, Jumpei; Torii, Shiho; Yonekawa, Akiko; Shimono, Nobuyuki; Nagasaki, Yoji; Minami, Rumi; Toya, Takashi; Sekiya, Noritaka; Fukuhara, Takasuke; Matsuura, Yoshiharu; Schreiber, Gideon; Ikeda, Terumasa; Nakagawa, So; Ueno, Takamasa; Sato, Kei",Cell Host Microbe,202,16

The emergence of COVID-19 worldwide has had serious consequences for physical and psychological health. Spain is one of the countries that has been most-seriously affected by the pandemic. This study aims to evaluate the psychometric properties of the Spanish version of the COVID-19 fear scale (FCV-19S), assessing its structural validity, differential item functioning, and measurement invariance by gender and age. Methodology. A cross-sectional study was carried out in several stages. Descriptive, exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis, scale reliability, item differential functioning, and measurement invariance tests were carried out. Results. We obtained a single-factor scale with excellent goodness-of-fit indices and high internal consistency (alpha = .90;omega = .93) adapted to the general Spanish population. We also found a significant relationship with depression (r = .72) and anxiety (r = .84). Gender invariance testing indicated that men and women understood the scale items differently, with differences also being found by age group. Conclusions. This is the first study attempting to assess the gender and age invariance of the FCV-19S scale. The scale demonstrates adequate psychometric properties, high internal consistency, and an appropriate relationship with depression and anxiety. Men and women in the general Spanish population have different perceptions of the fear of infection by COVID-19, and the fear affects some age groups more than others.","Sanchez-Teruel, D.; Robles-Bello, M.

Various glucocorticoids regimens have been proposed. METHODS: Retrospective observational study that includes patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia and compares admission to an Intensive Care Unit (ICU) or death during hospitalization in three groups of patients: no glucocorticoids treatment, use of glucocorticoids doses equivalent to less than 250mg of prednisone daily and use of equivalent doses greater than or equal to 250mg of prednisone daily. Multivariate analysis was performed using logistic regression, using the propensity index as a covariant. RESULTS: Of the 259 patients enrolled in the study, 67 (25.9%) had an unfavorable evolution, dying or requiring ICU admission. Comparative analyzes between different glucocorticoids treatments and the association with ICU admission or death were: glucocorticoids treatment (any dose) versus no glucocorticoids treatment (OR: 0.71 [0.30-1.66]), treatment with glucocorticoids (&#8805;250mg prednisone daily) versus no glucocorticoids treatment (OR: 0.35 [0.11-1.08]) and glucocorticoids treatment (&#8805;250mg prednisone daily) versus patients with glucocorticoids doses <250mg prednisone daily or without glucocorticoids treatment (OR: 0.30 [0.10-0.88]). CONCLUSION: The results of this study show that patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia treated with glucocorticoids pulses with equivalent doses of prednisone greater than or equal to 250mg have a more favorable evolution (less mortality and less admission to ICU).","Pascual Pareja, José Francisco; García-Caballero, Rebeca; Soler Rangel, Llanos; Vázquez-Ronda, Miguel Angel; Roa Franco, Silvia; Navarro Jiménez, Gema; Moreno Palanco, Miguel Angel; González-Ruano, Patricia; López-Menchaca, Ramiro; Ruíz-Seco, Pilar; Pagán Muñoz, Bárbara; Gómez Gómez, Alejandro; Pérez-Monte, Beatriz; Fuerte Martínez, Rebeca; Valle López, Jose Luis; Muñoz Blanco, Arturo; Rábago Lorite, Isabel; Martínez Martín, Patricia; Serralta San Martín, Gonzalo; Gómez-Cerezo, Jorge Francisco",Med. clin (Ed. impr.),202,16

Among these, its role in the innate immune system as a first line of defense against pathogens has received less attention. In asthma, levels of exhaled NO have been utilized as a window into airway inflammation caused by allergic processes. However, respiratory infections count among the most important triggers of disease exacerbations. Among the multitude of factors that affect NO levels are psychological processes. In particular, longer lasting states of psychological stress and depression have been shown to attenuate NO production. The novel SARS-CoV-2 virus, which has caused a pandemic, and with that, sustained levels of psychological stress globally, also adversely affects NO signaling. We review evidence on the role of NO in respiratory infection, including COVID-19, and stress, and argue that boosting NO bioavailability may be beneficial in protection from infections, thus benefitting individuals who suffer from stress in asthma or SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Ritz, Thomas; Salsman, Margot L; Young, Danielle A; Lippert, Alexander R; Khan, Dave A; Ginty, Annie T",Brain Behav Immun Health,202,20

Most alarming is that children are especially at risk. Although many studies demonstrate that the majority of trafficked persons surveyed engage with the health-care system during the time in which they are trafficked, health-care practitioners lack the knowledge, tools and resources to assist these patients. The present efforts in training health-care professionals have been fragmented and largely ineffective. While prior training has produced short-term changes in knowledge or attitudes of health professionals, it has not produced sustained changes in knowledge and attitudes nor meaningful changes in screening or intervention. No training has demonstrated changes in patient outcomes. Trafficked persons, particularly children and survivors of labour trafficking, are inadequately served by our present training options for health-care practitioners, and evidence-based protocols are needed to care for this underserved, disenfranchised and traumatised population. To provide optimal care for trafficked youth, health-care practitioners may benefit from: (i) evaluating training for health care providers (HCP) rigorously and meaningfully; (ii) advocating for high-quality training for all HCPs; (iii) fostering partnerships with key stakeholders to inform training and practice; and (iv) designing HCP training that is comprehensive, spanning all forms of human trafficking and including all populations involved.","Coughlin, Catherine G; Greenbaum, Jordan; Titchen, Kanani",J. paediatr. child health,202,20

METHODS: All radioembolization procedures for hepatic malignancies using resin microspheres with MIRD model between November 2015 and February 2019 were included in this IRB-approved study (n = 60). Student's T test was used to compare prescribed activity based on MIRD and BSA models. Adverse events were assessed immediately, 30 days, and 6 months post-treatment. RESULTS: Sixty radioembolizations were performed in 54 patients (age 68 ± 9 years, 48-87 years, 35% female). Mean prescribed activity calculated by the MIRD model (target absorbed dose 120-200 Gy for primary and 80-200 Gy for metastatic liver cancers) was 1.7 GBq (0.3-6.4) compared with 0.6 GBq (0.12-2.1) if BSA had been used (p < 0.0001). The prescribed activity was successfully delivered in 93% (56/60) treatments. Prophylactic embolization and anti-reflux catheters were used in 20% (12/60) and 5% (3/60) treatments, respectively. No immediate post-procedural complications occurred. Abdominal pain was the most common clinical Grade 3 CTCAE in 30 days (10%) and 6 months (12%). Radiation pneumonitis occurred in 3 (5%) patients but no radiation-induced gastric ulcer or radiation-induced liver disease occurred. CONCLUSION: MIRD dosimetry results in higher prescribed activity compared with BSA dosimetry with resin microspheres. MIRD prescribed activity with target absorbed doses up to 200 Gy can be successfully administered without prophylactic embolization in selected patients. KEY POINTS: â¢MIRD dosimetry results in higher prescribed activity compared with BSA dosimetry for radioembolization. â¢MIRD dosimetry can be used for yttrium-90 resin microsphere radioembolization with acceptable safety profile.","Sarwar, Ammar; Kudla, Alexei; Weinstein, Jeffrey L; Ali, Aamir; Malik, Raza; Bullock, Andrea; Khwaja, Khalid O; Curry, Michael; Faintuch, Salomao; Ahmed, Muneeb",Eur. radiol,202,26

This paper investigates respiratory droplet transmission, which is critical to understanding, modeling and controlling epidemics. In the present work, we implemented flow visualization, particle image velocimetry (PIV) and particle shadow tracking velocimetry (PSTV) to measure the velocity of the airflow and droplets involved in coughing and then constructed a physical model considering the evaporation effect to predict the motion of droplets under different weather conditions. The experimental results indicate that the convection velocity of cough airflow presents the relationship $t^{-0.7}$ with time; hence, the distance from the cougher increases by $t^{0.3}$ in the range of our measurement domain. Substituting these experimental results into the physical model reveals that the small droplets (initial diameter $D \leq$ 100 $\mu$m) evaporate to droplet nuclei and that the large droplets with $D \geq$ 500 $\mu$m and initial velocity $u_0 \geq$ 5 m/s travel more than 2 m. Winter conditions of low temperature and high relative humidity can cause more droplets to settle to the ground, which may be a possible driver of a second pandemic wave in the autumn and winter seasons.","Wang, Hongping; Li, Zhaobin; Zhang, Xinlei; Zhu, Lixing; Liu, Yi; Wang, Shizhao",,202,16

This is well established for other coronaviruses. In order to understand why some patients develop such symptoms and others do not, we address herein the infectability of the central nervous system (CNS). Reports that the ACE2 receptor ­ critical for virus entry into lung cells ­ is found in different neurons support this expectation. We employed a human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)- derived BrainSphere model, which we used earlier for Zika, Dengue, HIV and John Cunningham virus infection studies. We detected the expression of the ACE2 receptor, but not TMPRSS2, in the model. Incubating the BrainSpheres for 6 hours with SARS-CoV-2 at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.1 led to infection of a fraction of neural cells with replication of the virus evident at 72 hpi. Virus particles were found in the neuronal cell body extending into apparent neurite structures. PCR measurements corroborated the replication of the virus, suggesting at least a tenfold increase in virus copies per total RNA. Leveraging state-of-the-art 3D organotypic cell culture, which has been shown to allow both virus infection and modeling of (developmental) neurotoxicity but is at the same time simple enough to be transferred and used in a BSL-3 environment, we demonstrate, for the first time, the potential critically important neurotropism of SARS-CoV-2.","Bullen, C Korin; Hogberg, Helena T; Bahadirli-Talbott, Asli; Bishai, William R; Hartung, Thomas; Keuthan, Casey; Looney, Monika M; Pekosz, Andrew; Romero, J Carolina; Sillé, Fenna C M; Um, Peter; Smirnova, Lena",ALTEX,202,16

Methods: An online survey was completed by ophthalmologists and ophthalmology trainees during the lockdown. The information collected included demographics (age, gender), domicile (state, union territory), current professional status (in training or practising), type of practice (solo, group, institutional, governmental, non-governmental), marital status (married, single), impact of COVID-19 on their training or practice, and impact on income and ability to meet living expenses. Psychological distress was assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). Results: In all, 2,355 ophthalmologists responded. Mean age was 42.5 (range, 25-82 years; SD, 12.05) years. Of these, 1,332 (56.7%) were males; 475 (20.2%) were still not in practice; 366 (15.5%) were single; 1,244 (52.8%) felt that COVID-19 would impact on their training or professional work; and 869 (37%) had difficulty in meeting their living expenses. The mean PHQ-9 score was 3.98 (range, 0-27; SD, 4.65). In terms of psychological impact, 768 (32.6%) had some degree of depression; mild in 504 (21.4%), moderate in 163 (6.9%), and severe in 101 (4.3%). Multivariable analysis showed that depression was significantly higher at younger age. The odds of depression decreased by 3% with 1 year increase in age. It was higher in non-practicing ophthalmologists, especially those who were considerably worried about their training or professional growth, and those with difficulty in meeting living expenses. Conclusion: A strikingly high proportion of ophthalmologists are psychologically affected and may require personalized mental health care.","Khanna, Rohit C; Honavar, Santosh G; Metla, Asha Latha; Bhattacharya, Amritendu; Maulik, Pallab K",Indian J Ophthalmol,202,32

Methods: Data of 173 inpatients at Huoshenshan Hospital from February 10 to March 17, 2020, were analyzed retrospectively. Clinical characteristics, partial test results, and the influence of glucocorticoid therapy on the clinical outcomes of nucleic acid negative conversion and changes in lung CT images were compared. The patients were divided at admission into 4 groups according to the course of disease and glucocorticoid treatment. Differences among the groups were analyzed statistically. Results: The median age of 173 patients was 62 years, and 91.3% were over 40 years old. Underlying diseases occurred in 50.3% of patients, 32.6% had family gatherings, and 24.3% had exposure while shopping or at a hospital. Median times of nucleic acid negative conversion in group A+B (course of disease 3 weeks) and group C+D (course of disease 3 weeks) were 23 days and 37 days, respectively (P 0.05). Other group comparisons, i.e., of A+C with B+D, A with B, or C with D, were not statistically different. One week after reexamination, chest CT lesion area had changed by 52% in group C and 50% in group D (P 0.05).

However, currently, there is a lack of systematic study and quantitative information of the aerosol generation during these instruments, which is crucial for offering risk assessment and the corresponding mitigation strategies for the reopening of these activities. Collaborating with 15 musicians from the Minnesota Orchestra, we conduct a systematic study of the aerosol generation from a large variety of wind instruments under different music dynamic levels and articulation patterns. We find that the aerosol concentration from different brass and woodwinds exhibits two orders of magnitude variation. Accordingly, we categorize the instruments into low (tuba), intermediate (bassoon, piccolo, flute, bass clarinet, French horn, and clarinet) and high risk (trumpet, bass trombone, and oboe) levels based on a comparison of their aerosol generation with those from normal breathing and speaking. In addition, we observe that the aerosol generation can be affected by the changing dynamic level, articulation pattern, the normal respiratory behaviors of individuals, and even the usage of some special techniques during the instrument play. However, such effects vary substantially for different types of instrument, depending on specific breathing techniques as well as the tube structure and inlet design of the instrument. Overall, our findings can bring insights into the risk assessment of airborne decrease transmission and the corresponding mitigation strategies for various musical activities involving wind instrument plays, including orchestras, community and worship bands, music classes, etc.","He, Ruichen; Gao, Linyue; Trifonov, Maximilian; Hong, Jiarong",J Aerosol Sci,202,16

This disease frequently features cardiac amyloid fibril deposits that originate from dissociation of the tetrameric protein, transthyretin (TTR). Unlike hereditary TTR (ATTRm) amyloidosis, where amino acid replacements destabilize the native protein, in ATTRwt amyloidosis, amyloid-forming TTR lacks protein sequence alterations. The initiating cause of fibril formation in ATTRwt amyloidosis is unclear, and thus, it seems plausible that other factors are involved in TTR misfolding and unregulated accumulation of wild-type TTR fibrils. We believe that clusterin (CLU, UniProtKB P10909), a plasma circulating glycoprotein, plays a role in the pathobiology of ATTRwt amyloidosis. Previously, we have suggested a role for CLU in ATTRwt amyloidosis based on our studies showing that (1) CLU codeposits with non-native TTR in amyloid fibrils from ATTRwt cardiac tissue, (2) CLU interacts only with non-native (monomeric and aggregated) forms of TTR, and (3) CLU serum levels in patients with ATTRwt are significantly lower compared to healthy controls. In the present study, we provide comprehensive detail of compositional findings from mass spectrometry analyses of amino acid and glycan content of CLU purified from ATTRwt and control sera. The characterization of oligosaccharide content in serum CLU derived from patients with ATTRwt amyloidosis is novel data. Moreover, results comparing CLU oligosaccharide variations between patient and healthy controls are original and provide further evidence for the role of CLU in ATTRwt pathobiology, possibly linked to disease-specific structural features that limit the chaperoning capacity of CLU.","Torres-Arancivia, Celia M; Chang, Deborah; Hackett, William E; Zaia, Joseph; Connors, Lawreen H",Biochemistry,202,33

We recently isolated a large number of monoclonal antibodies from SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals. Here we select the top three most potent yet variable neutralizing antibodies for in-depth structural and functional analyses. Crystal structural comparisons reveal differences in the angles of approach to the receptor binding domain (RBD), the size of the buried surface areas, and the key binding residues on the RBD of the viral spike glycoprotein. One antibody, P2C-1F11, most closely mimics binding of receptor ACE2, displays the most potent neutralizing activity in vitro and conferred strong protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection in Ad5-hACE2-sensitized mice. It also occupies the largest binding surface and demonstrates the highest binding affinity to RBD. More interestingly, P2C-1F11 triggers rapid and extensive shedding of S1 from the cell-surface expressed spike glycoprotein, with only minimal such effect by the remaining two antibodies. These results offer a structural and functional basis for potent neutralization via disruption of the very first and critical steps for SARS-CoV-2 cell entry.","Ge, Jiwan; Wang, Ruoke; Ju, Bin; Zhang, Qi; Sun, Jing; Chen, Peng; Zhang, Senyan; Tian, Yuling; Shan, Sisi; Cheng, Lin; Zhou, Bing; Song, Shuo; Zhao, Juanjuan; Wang, Haiyan; Shi, Xuanling; Ding, Qiang; Liu, Lei; Zhao, Jincun; Zhang, Zheng; Wang, Xinquan; Zhang, Linqi",Nat Commun,202,11

Significant impact of climate change is seen in the form of rise in temperature called as global warming. Carbon dioxide (CO 2), methane (CH 4), and nitrous oxide (N 2O) are the primary greenhouse gases (GHGs) mainly responsible for the global warming and climate change. These GHGs have drawn lot of attention due to their significant role in the global warming potential. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) suggested to stop global warming at 1.5oC above preindustrial levels as warming beyond this level might lead to heat extremes, alter insect and plant phenology (Phenological shifts) and more occurrence of vector borne diseases. Climate change is the topic of interest in all fields of life starting from social science and going to the applied science. Global climate cycles and world food production systems are under threat due to the recent climate extreme events. These events include heat waves and change in the rainfall patterns. Thus, risk reduction intervention in the form of mitigation and adaptation is required to minimize the impacts of climate change. Mitigation option includes understanding the present and future components of the climate system and interaction among them through coupled modeling system i.e. Global Circulation Model (GCM). Finally, global issue of climate change could be addressed by taking worldwide cooperation and action and adopting sustainable measures like use of alternative energy sources. The visible benefit on recovery of climate has been seen recently through global lockdown against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.","Ahmed, Mukhtar",Sci. Total Environ.,202,25

Material and Methods: This prospective cross-sectional study was carried out on the young doctors and nursing staff at KAUH. An online questionnaire addressing all the required fields, i.e., background essential demography, perceptions, acceptance, and knowledge regarding telemedicine's utility, was sent to the targeted population of health care workers. Completed responses were analyzed statistically as per study objectives. Results: The response rate in our study was 85%. A total of 335 participants responded to our questionnaire. One hundred seventy-one (51.1%) were doctors, whereas one hundred sixty-four (48.9%) were the nursing staff. Among doctors, 50 (29.4%) were recent graduates, whereas, in the nursing side, 77 (46.7%) were the senior nursing students. The knowledge and attitude of the young nursing staff were relatively better than the senior staff taking part in the study and the trends were found statistically significant. Conclusion: Our study participants, being young, were enthusiastic, had good knowledge regarding the advantages and limitations of telemedicine in managing the selected groups of patients. Their perception and attitude were quite positive. This is an encouraging trend in the promotion of telemedicine as an established way of managing patients with special requirements in an effective way. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of telemedicine in emergencies to protect both patients and health care workers by reducing chronic patients' avoidable hospital visits.","Ahmed, T J; Baig, M; Bashir, M A; Gazzaz, Z J; Butt, N S; Khan, S A",Niger J Clin Pract,202,16

However, the relationship between ACE2 expression and its clinical implications in SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis remains unknown. Here, we explored the location and expression of ACE2, and its correlation with gender, age, and cigarette smoke (CS), in a CS-exposed mouse model and 224 non-malignant lung tissues (125 non-smokers, 81 current smokers, and 18 ex-smokers) by immunohistochemistry. Moreover, the correlations of ACE2 with CS-induced oxidative stress-related markers, hypoxia-inducible factor-1&#945; (HIF-1&#945;), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) were investigated. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and luciferase reporter assays identified the cause of ACE2 overexpression in human primary lung epithelial cells. We demonstrated that ACE2 was predominantly overexpressed on the apical surface of bronchial epithelium, while reduced in alveolar epithelium, owing to the dramatically decreased abundance of alveolar type II pneumocytes in CS-exposed mouse lungs. Consistent with this, ACE2 was primarily significantly overexpressed in human bronchial and alveolar epithelial cells in smokers regardless of age or gender. Decreased ACE2 expression was observed in bronchial epithelial cells from ex-smokers compared with current smokers, especially in those who had ceased smoking for more than 10 years. Moreover, ACE2 expression was positively correlated with the levels of HIF-1&#945;, iNOS, and 4-HNE in both mouse and human bronchioles. The results were further validated using a publicly available dataset from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and our previous integrated data from Affymetrix U133 Plus 2.0 microarray (AE-meta). Finally, our results showed that HIF-1&#945; transcriptionally upregulates ACE2 expression. Our results indicate that smoking-induced ACE2 overexpression in the apical surface of bronchial epithelial cells provides a route by which SARS-CoV-2 enters host cells, which supports clinical relevance in attenuating the potential transmission risk of COVID-19 in smoking populations by smoking cessation. © 2020 The Pathological Society of Great Britain and Ireland.

The aim of this study was to update the monthly COVID-19 and rehabilitation literature research up to October 31th, 2020. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: Methodology described in the second edition of the rapid living systematic review 2020 conducted by Cochrane Rehabilitation REH-COVER action was applied. PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, Scopus, Web of Science, and PEDro databases were searched, and papers related to COVID-19 and rehabilitation were retrieved and summarized descriptively. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: The database search retrieved 2704 publications. Duplicates were removed, and 1185 unique records were screened for inclusion. After screening titles, abstracts and full-texts, 22 papers were included in the present review. According to OCEBM 2011 Levels of Evidence table, 17 studies (77%) fall within the level of evidence 4 category, while the remainder (23%) are categorized as level of evidence 3. Most studies (N.=19; 86%) provided epidemiological data about the disease natural history/determining factor or the clinical presentation of COVID-19 infection, while only two studies focused on health service organization and intervention efficacy. CONCLUSIONS: The most recent published COVID-19 research relevant to rehabilitation primarily provides data on the clinical course and the clinical presentation of the pathology, rather than on rehabilitation interventions or service delivery. Studies with high levels of evidence regarding the efficacy of interventions, long-term monitoring, or new health service organization models are lacking.","Negrini, Francesco; De Sire, Alessandro; Andrenelli, Elisa; Lazzarini, Stefano G; Patrini, Michele; Ceravolo, Maria G",Eur. j. phys. rehabil. med.

The aim of the current study was to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy and prognostication of monocyte distribution width (MDW) in sepsis for patients admitted to ICU. METHODS: Between January and June 2020, we conducted a prospective observational study during the hospitalization of 506 adult patients admitted to the ICU. MDW was evaluated in 2,367 consecutive samples received for routine complete blood counts (CBC) performed once a day and every day during the study. Sepsis was diagnosed according to Sepsis-3 criteria and patients enrolled were classified in the following groups: no sepsis, sepsis and septic shock. RESULTS: MDW values were significantly higher in patients with sepsis or septic shock in comparison to those within the no sepsis group [median 26.23 (IQR: 23.48-29.83); 28.97 (IQR: 21.27-37.21); 21.99 (IQR: 19.86-24.36) respectively]. ROC analysis demonstrated that AUC is 0.785 with a sensitivity of 66.88% and specificity of 77.79% at a cut-off point of 24.63. In patients that developed an ICU-acquired sepsis MDW showed an increase from 21.33 [median (IQR: 19.47-21.72)] to 29.19 [median (IQR: 27.46-31.47)]. MDW increase is not affected by the aetiology of sepsis, even in patients with COVID-19. In sepsis survivors a decrease of MDW values were found from the first time to the end of their stay [median from 29.14 (IQR: 26.22-32.52) to 25.67 (IQR: 22.93-30.28)]. CONCLUSIONS: In ICU, MDW enhances the sepsis detection and is related to disease severity.","Piva, Elisa; Zuin, Jenny; Pelloso, Michela; Tosato, Francesca; Fogar, Paola; Plebani, Mario",Clin Chem Lab Med,202,32

METHODS: A retrospective study in one center (Lille, France) compared two periods: the COVID-19 lockdown of 18 March 2020 to 7 May 2020 versus the same period during 2019. Glucose targets were defined by a capillary fasting glucose target < 5.1mmol/L and/or a 2-hour postprandial capillary glucose < 6.6 mmol/L. GDM control was defined as: good (< 20% of the glycemic values were not within the target range), acceptable (20 to 40% of the glycemic values were not within the target range) or poor (> 40% of the glycemic values were not within the target range). RESULTS: Two hundred twenty-nine patients were included in 2019 and 222 in 2020. The same mean number of capillary blood sugar tests was performed by the two groups. Postprandial blood sugar was significantly less well controlled in 2020, with a lower rate of good control (61.6% vs 69.4%) and higher rates of acceptable (24.7% vs 21.8%) and poor control (13.7% and 8.7%) (p < 0.05). Use of insulin therapy was significantly higher in 2020 compared with 2019 (47.7% and 36.2%, respectively; p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Diabetes control was lower during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown, even if follow-up was not impacted. This may be explained by reduced physical activity, modified dietary habits and anxiety during this period.","Ghesquière, L; Garabedian, C; Drumez, E; Lemaître, M; Cazaubiel, M; Bengler, C; Vambergue, A",Diabetes metab,202,1

'Green zones'-areas where the virus is under control based on a uniform set of conditions-can progressively return to normal economic and social activity levels, and mobility between them is permitted. By contrast, stricter public health measures are in place in 'red zones', and mobility between red and green zones is restricted. France and Spain were among the first countries to introduce green zoning in April 2020. Subsequently, more and more countries followed suit and the European Commission advocated for the implementation of a European green zoning strategy, which has been supported by the EU member states. While there remain coordination problems, green zoning has proven to be an effective strategy for containing the spread of the virus and limiting its negative economic and social impact. This strategy should provide important lessons and prove useful in future outbreaks. Research in epidemiology indicates that thoroughly implemented and operationalised green zoning can prevent the spread of a transmittable disease that is poorly understood, highly virulent, and potentially highly lethal. Finally, there is strong evidence that green zoning can reduce economic and societal damage as it avoids worst-in-class measures.","Oliu-Barton, Miquel; Pradelski, Bary S R",Health Policy,202,24

This study aimed to propose a clinical staging proposal of the disease course in non-severe patients with COVID-19. In this retrospective study, 108 non-severe patients with COVID-19 were grouped according to the duration from symptoms onset to hospital admission: &#8804; 1 week, > 1 to 2 weeks, > 2 to 3 weeks, > 3 to 5 weeks, respectively. The dynamic changes of clinical signs were profiled across the four groups. A clinical staging proposal of the disease course over time was proposed from the perspective of the interaction between the virus and host. The prodromal phase, characterized by pneumonia, significant lymphopenia, and slightly elevated inflammatory markers, occurred in the first week after symptoms onset. In the second week, all the hematological and inflammatory markers were at the peak or bottom. Meanwhile, progressive pneumonia as well as the secondary damage of other organs (e.g. cardiac damage, coagulopathy, etc.) was significant during this period, making the disease progress into the apparent manifestation phase. In the third week, the improvement of the majority of clinical signs accompanied by a relatively high degree of inflammatory response defined the remission phase. After 3 weeks, patients were in the convalescent phase, in which all the indicators were maintained at a relatively normal level. We concluded that the disease course over time in non-severe patients with COVID-19 could be divided into four phases: the prodromal phase (in the first week), the apparent manifestation phase (in the second week), the remission phase (in the third week), and the convalescent phase (after 3 weeks), respectively. In clinical practice, tailored therapies should be considered seriously in different stages of the disease course.","Lin, Yiting; Wu, Yiqun; Zhong, Ping; Hou, Bingbo; Liu, Jielan; Chen, Yingying; Liu, Jiajun",Sci Rep,202,0

Document analysis of the qualitative research methods was employed to analyze the reports issued by the Turkish Ministry of National Education, the Turkish Statistical Institute (TUIK), and the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA). The results of the research revealed the importance of access to information and communication technologies for both students and teachers: 67.9% of the participating students were found to have Internet connection and 69.1% a computer in their homes, while 80.3% of the students were observed to use a computer outside the school, but 19.7% were not. The results also showed that 64.6% of the students have Internet connection in their classrooms, but 29.2% of these students do not use the Internet in the classroom, whereas 8.9% use it in the classroom all the time. The rate of students using a digital device for reading is 38.1%, while that of those not using one is 61.9%. Some 32.1% of secondary school students were revealed not to have Internet connection at home. Additionally, 77% of teachers were not trained in online teaching prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. Based on the findings, teachers can be suggested to develop projects ? i.e., of TUBITAK, E-twinning, and Erasmus ? which potentially encourage students to use information and communication technologies so that both teachers and students can benefit from them. It is also suggested that the Ministry of National Education should work on improving the information communication technology competencies of teachers and students. Besides, policies should be developed to eliminate regional differences in terms of access to digital resources and technology in terms of equal opportunities and opportunities.","amp,; Iacute,; ra, Nejat Yıldız Mehmet Yıldız Gamze Yalçınkaya-Önder Eylem Aksu Ali",Information Development,202,22

A baseline serological survey of COVID-19 antibodies is essential to accurately evaluate an epidemic outbreak. The primary purpose of this study was to determine pre-epidemic prevalence of COVID-19 antibodies among healthcare workers, using two laboratory-based quantitative tests. In addition, a point-of-care (POC) qualitative test, rapid, simple, and convenient for primary care clinics, was compared with the laboratory-based tests. All antibody tests were performed on serum from 1,000 healthcare workers (mean age, 40 ± 11 years) in Iwate Prefectural Central Hospital, May 29-31, 2020. A COVID-19 case was defined as showing positive results in both laboratory-based quantitative tests. None of 1,000 samples had positive results in both of the laboratory immunoassays. The POC test showed positive results in 33 of 1,000 samples (3.3%) (95% confidence interval:2.19-4.41), but no samples were simultaneously positive in both laboratory-based tests. In conclusion, COVID-19 cases were not serologically confirmed by a baseline control study of healthcare workers at our hospital in late May, 2020. Moreover, the POC qualitative test may offer no advantage in areas with very low prevalence of COVID-19, due to higher false-positive reactions compared with laboratory-based quantitative immunoassays.","Nakamura, Akihiro; Sato, Ryoichi; Ando, Sanae; Oana, Natsuko; Nozaki, Eiji; Endo, Hideaki; Miyate, Yoshiharu; Soma, Jun; Miyata, Go",Fukushima J Med Sci,202,26

Social distancing is critical for patients with cancer, yet this can also reduce access to psychosocial coping resources. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to explore patient experiences to generate a model of how virtual mind-body programs can support the psychosocial well-being of patients with cancer. METHODS: We conducted a qualitative study among patients (ages &#8805;18) who participated in a virtual mind-body program offered by a National Cancer Institute-designated Comprehensive Cancer Center during COVID-19. The program consisted of mind-body group therapy sessions in fitness, yoga, tai chi, dance therapy, music therapy, and meditation. Live integrative medicine clinicians held each session via Zoom video conferencing for 30 to 45 minutes. In semi-structured phone interviews (n=30), patients were asked about overall impressions and perceptions of the session's benefit, including impacts on stress and anxiety. Interviews were analyzed using grounded theory. RESULTS: Among participants [n=30, age 64.5 range 40-80, 96.7% female], three major themes were identified relating to experiences in the virtual mind-body program: (1) Sessions helped in maintaining structured routines, and motivating patients to adhere to healthy behaviors; (2) sessions enhanced coping with COVID-19-related stressors allowing patients to ""refocus"" and ""re-energize""; (3) sessions allowed patients to connect, fostering social relationships during a time of isolation. These themes informed the constructs of a novel Behavioral-Psychological-Social Coping model for patients with cancer. CONCLUSIONS: Virtual Mind-Body programming supported cancer patients during COVID-19 through a Behavioral-Psychological-Social Coping model, by enhancing phycological coping for external stressors, supporting adherence to motivation and health behaviors, and increasing social connection and camaraderie. These programs have potential to address the behavioral, psychological, and social challenges faced by patients with cancer during and beyond COVID-19. The constructs of the conceptual model proposed in this study can inform future interventions to support isolated cancer patients. Further clinical trials are needed to confirm the specific benefit of virtual mind-body programming for cancer patients' psychosocial well-being and healthy behaviors.","Emard, Nicholas; Lynch, Kathleen A; Liou, Kevin T; Atkinson, Thomas; Green, Angela K; Daly, Bobby; Trevino, Kelly; Mao, Jun J",,202,1

While the lungs, heart, and brain are identified as the main targets of SARS-CoV-2-mediated pathogenesis, reports on its testicular infections have been a subject of debate. The brain and testes are physiologically synchronized by the action of gonadotropins and sex steroid hormones. Though the evidence for the presence of the viral particles in the testicular biopsies and semen samples from COVID-19 patients are highly limited, the occurrence of testicular pathology due to abrupt inflammatory responses and hyperthermia has incresingly been evident. The reduced level of testosterone production in COVID-19 is associated with altered secretion of gonadotropins. Moreover, hypothalamic pathology which results from SARS-CoV-2 infection of the brain is also evident in COVID-19 cases. This article revisits and supports the key reports on testicular abnormalities and pathological signatures in the hypothalamus of COVID-19 patients and emphasizes that testicular pathology resulting from inflammation and oxidative stress might lead to infertility in a significant portion of COVID-19 survivors. Further investigations are required to monitor the reproductive health parameters and HPG axis abnormalities related to secondary pathological complications in COVID-19 patients and survivors.","Selvaraj, Kaviya; Ravichandran, Sowbarnika; Krishnan, Sushmita; Radhakrishnan, Risna Kanjirassery; Manickam, Nivethitha; Kandasamy, Mahesh",Reprod. sci,202,31

The AAMC and LCME have supported the efforts for more effective medical education of SUD to address the existing stigma, knowledge, and treatment gaps. The Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and associated social, economic, and behavioral impacts have added to this urgency. The University of South Carolina School of Medicine Greenville (USCSOMG), in collaboration with community organizations, has successfully implemented an integrated SUD education curriculum for medical students. Students learn about SUD in basic sciences, receive case-based education during clinical exercises, and are provided the opportunity to become a recovery coach and participate in the patient and family recovery meetings through this curriculum during preclinical years. During the clinical years, SUD education is enhanced with exposure to Medication for Addition Treatment (MAT). Students also partake in the care coordination of patients with SUD between the hospital and community recovery organizations. All students receive MAT waiver training in their final year and are prepared to prescribe treatment for SUD upon graduation. The experiences in this integrated curriculum integration can perhaps assist other organizations to implement similar components and empower the next generation of physicians to be competent and effective in treating patients with SUD.

We aimed to synthesize all available research on the potential impact of eye protection on transmission of SARS-CoV-2. MethodsWe searched PROSPERO, PubMed, Embase, The Cochrane Library for clinical trials and comparative observational studies in CENTRAL, and Europe PMC for pre-prints. We included studies that reported sufficient data to estimate the effect of any form of eye protection including face shields and variants, goggles, and glasses, on subsequent confirmed infection with SARS-CoV-2. FindingsWe screened 898 articles and included 6 reports of 5 observational studies from 4 countries (USA, India, Columbia, and United Kingdom) that tested face shields, googles and wraparound eyewear on 7567 healthcare workers. The three before-and-after and one retrospective cohort studies showed statistically significant and substantial reductions in SARS-CoV-2 infections favouring eye protection with odds ratios ranging from 0.04 to 0.6, corresponding to relative risk reductions of 96% to 40%. These reductions were not explained by changes in the community rates. However, the one case-control study reported odds ratio favouring no eye protection (OR 1.7, 95% CI 0.99, 3.0). The high heterogeneity between studies precluded any meaningful meta-analysis. None of the studies adjusted for potential confounders such as other protective behaviours, thus increasing the risk of bias, and decreasing the certainty of evidence to very low. InterpretationCurrent studies suggest that eye protection may play a role in prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection in healthcare workers. However, robust comparative trials are needed to clearly determine effectiveness of eye protections and wearability issues in both healthcare and general populations.

We aimed to investigate the knowledge and attitudes of Emergency Medical Service (EMS) employees who fight COVID-19 at the forefront. METHODS: A total of 400 EMS workers (doctors, nurses, emergency medical technicians, paramedics, and ambulance drivers) were included in this study. Knowledge, attitude, and preventive behaviors for COVID-19 were evaluated using an online questionnaire. RESULTS: A total of 275 EMS workers participated in the study with a response rate of 68.8%. The respondents reported that their highest common sources of knowledge about COVID-19 were social media and television (n=240, 88%). Overall, > 96% of the participants had adequate knowledge about the transmission routes of COVID-19. Among the respondents, 36% of them were unaware of the correct hand washing or scrubbing technique. In addition, 78% of the participants had poor knowledge about floor and surface disinfection. The majority of the participants exhibited inaccurate attitudes toward the use of personal preventive equipment. More than half of EMS workers (52%) agreed that a surgical mask is not enough during the procedures that do not generate aerosol. Moreover, a significant proportion of the participants (66%) perceived that a N95 mask is required.

During the first and second waves of the pandemic spread, there have been several reports of COVID-19-associated neurological manifestations, including acute seizures and status epilepticus (SE). In this systematic review, we summarized the available data on clinical features, diagnosis, and therapy of COVID-19-related SE. METHODS: We performed a systematic search of the literature to identify data on demographics, clinical, neurophysiological, and neuroradiological data of patients with COVID-19-related SE. We used regression models (linear or logistic) with a stepwise forward method to identify features associated with mortality or severity of SE. RESULTS: Thirty-nine articles were included with a total of 47 cases of SE associated with COVID-19. Age, time between the acute respiratory phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection and SE onset, and hospitalization correlated with a higher SE severity as assessed by quantitative validated scales. CONCLUSIONS: SE can be a neurological manifestation of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Although a possible association between SE and COVID-19 has been reported, the exact mechanisms are still not fully understood. Systemic inflammatory syndrome due to cytokine release could play a role in COVID-19-related SE.","Dono, Fedele; Nucera, Bruna; Lanzone, Jacopo; Evangelista, Giacomo; Rinaldi, Fabrizio; Speranza, Rino; Troisi, Serena; Tinti, Lorenzo; Russo, Mirella; Di Pietro, Martina; Onofrj, Marco; Bonanni, Laura; Assenza, Giovanni; Vollono, Catello; Anzellotti, Francesca; Brigo, Francesco",Epilepsy Behav,202,16

Methods This study analyzed the results of serologic tests to detect immunoglobulin G antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 and evaluated the demographic and clinical characteristics of the faculty and HCWs at a Tokyo medical institution in August 2020. The demographic and clinical characteristics of participants with antibody-positive results were compared to those of participants with antibody-negative results. Patients or Materials This study recruited 2,341 faculty and HCWs at a Tokyo medical institution, 21 of whom had a COVID-19 history. Results Of the 2,320 participants without a COVID-19 history, 20 (0.862%) had positive serologic test results. A fever and dysgeusia or dysosmia occurred with greater frequency among the participants with positive test results than in those with negative results (odds ratio [OR], 5.475; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.960-15.293 and OR, 24.158; 95% CI, 2.693-216.720, respectively). No significant difference was observed in the positivity rate between HCWs providing medical care for COVID-19 patients using adequate protection and other HCWs (OR, 2.514; 95% CI, 0.959-6.588). Conclusion To reduce the risk of COVID-19 spread in medical institutions, faculty and HCWs should follow standard and necessary transmission-based precautions, and those with a fever and dysgeusia or dysosmia should excuse themselves from work as soon as possible.","Nishimura, Tomoyasu; Uwamino, Yoshifumi; Uno, Shunsuke; Kashimura, Shoko; Shiraki, Toshikimi; Kurafuji, Toshinobu; Morita, Maasa; Noguchi, Masayo; Azegami, Tatsuhiko; Yamada-Goto, Nobuko; Murai-Takeda, Ayano; Yokoyama, Hirokazu; Kuwabara, Kazuyo; Kato, Suzuka; Matsumoto, Minako; Hirata, Aya; Iida, Miho; Harada, Sei; Ishizaka, Tamami; Misawa, Kana; Murata, Mitsuru; Saya, Hideyuki; Amagai, Masayuki; Kitagawa, Yuko; Takeuchi, Tsutomu; Mori, Masaaki; Takebayashi, Toru; Hasegawa, Naoki",Intern. med.

In the current emergency phase, the problem of infections in residential structures for the elderly is taking on considerable importance in relation to the significant prevalence rates of COVID-19. SAFETY IMPROVEMENT STRATEGIES: Prevention and control measures for SARS-CoV-2 infection in nursing homes should be planned before a possible outbreak of COVID-19 occurs and should be intensified during any exacerbation of the same. Each facility should identify a properly trained contact person-also external-for the prevention and control of infections, who can refer to a multidisciplinary support committee and who is in close contact with the local health authorities. The contact person should collaborate with professionals in order to prepare a prevention and intervention plan that considers national provisions and scientific evidence, the requirements for reporting patients with symptoms compatible with COVID-19, the indications for the management of suspected, probable or confirmed cases of COVID-19. DISCUSSION: Adequate risk management in residential structures implies the establishment of a coordination committee with dedicated staff, the implementation of a surveillance program for the rapid recognition of the outbreaks, the identification of suitable premises and equipment, the application of universal precautions, the adaptation of care plans to reduce the possibility of contagion among residents, the protection of operators and staff training initiatives.","Scopetti, Matteo; Santurro, Alessandro; Tartaglia, Riccardo; Frati, Paola; Fineschi, Vittorio",Int. j. qual. health care,202,1

Features of clinical symptoms, laboratory inspections and imaging inspections were analyzed. Statistical analysis used Fisher exact test. If P&lt;0.05, post-hoc test was used for pairwise comparison, and the statistics were corrected by Bonferroni test.@*Results@#Among the 46 patients included in this study, 27 were male and 19 were female. The age range was between 3 - 79 years old, and the mean age was (41.8 ± 16.3) years old. The average incubation period was (4.85 ± 3.00) days. A total of 26 cases (56.5%) were clustered patients, and 12 (26.1%), 23 (50.0%) and 11 patients (23.9%)were assigned to the mild group, common group, and sever group, respectively. Fever (39.8%), cough (27.6%), and fatigue (25.3%) was the main clinical symptom for these patients. The decrease in white blood cell counts occurred in 12 patients, four had the decrease in T lymphocyte counts, 17 had the decrease in CD4 + T lymphocyte counts, seven had the decrease in CD8 + T lymphocyte counts, 21 had the increase level of C-reactive protein (45.7%), and IL-6 level increased in 32 cases (69.6%), erythrocyte sedimentation rate increased in 20 cases(50.0%), serum ferritin level increased in 26 cases (56.5%), and blood lactate level increased in nine cases. There was a statistically significant difference in the number of cases in which the absolute value of T lymphocytes and of CD8 + T lymphocytes decreased among the mild, common and severe groups (all P&lt;0.05). Comparing the number of cases in the three groups with elevated C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, serum ferritin and blood lactate levels, the differences were statistically significant (all P&lt;0.05). The number of cases with elevated C-reactive protein levels was higher in severe group than that in mild and common group. The number of cases with elevated interleukin-6, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and serum ferritin levels were higher in severe group than in mild group. The number of cases with elevated blood lactic acid levels was higher in severe group than in mild group. The differences between the above groups were statistically significant (both adjusted P&lt;0.017). Analysis of chest X-rays showed that 34 patients (73.9%) had inflammation in the lungs.@*Conclusions@#The epidemiological characteristics of cases with COVID-19 in Beijing are mainly imported cases and clustered cases. The clinical manifestations are mainly fever , fatigue and cough. C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, red blood cell sedimentation rate, serum ferritin and blood lactate levels are higher in severe patients.","WEN, Ke; Wengang, LI; ZHANG, Dawei; ZHANG, Aimin; ZHANG, Tao; ZHAO, Peng; QIN, Enqiang",Chinese Journal of Infectious Diseases,202,16

METHODS: We collected detailed information on transmission events and symptom status based on laboratory-confirmed patient data and contact tracing data from four provinces and one municipality in China. We estimated the variation in risk of transmission over time, and the severity of secondary infections, by symptomatic status of the infector. RESULTS: There were 393 symptomatic index cases with 3136 close contacts and 185 asymptomatic index cases with 1078 close contacts included into the study. The secondary attack rate among close contacts of symptomatic and asymptomatic index cases were 4.1% (128/3136) and 1.1% (12/1078), respectively, corresponding to a higher transmission risk from symptomatic cases than from asymptomatic cases (OR: 3.79, 95% CI: 2.06, 6.95). Approximately 25% (32/128) and 50% (6/12) of the infected close contacts were asymptomatic from symptomatic and asymptomatic index cases, respectively, while more than one third (38%) of the infections in the close contacts of symptomatic cases were attributable to exposure to the index cases before symptom onset. Infected contacts of asymptomatic index cases were more likely to be asymptomatic and less likely to be severe. CONCLUSIONS: Asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic transmission play an important role in spreading infection, although asymptomatic cases pose a lower risk of transmission than symptomatic cases.

In June 2019, we issued a call for papers to address the awareness, adoption, and implementation challenges of technologies that can drive businesses of all sizes in the fourth industrial revolution. We intended to identify as critical elements the “must-have” and a “nice to have” technologies for small businesses and innovation. Then the ongoing COVID-19 global health pandemic struck in December 2019, forcing the need for digitization of business activities and remote operations, which was considered a “nice to have” to immediately become a “critical to have” to survive in the ever increasingly uncertain business environment. This paper identifies the technologies, evaluates disruptive software platforms, and strategies needed for creating and managing small business innovation and highlighting the complexity of that process and the context within which this process takes place. We integrate this discussion alongside a summary of the articles included in the Special Issue. The current realities show that technologies that enable social business creation, customer relationship management systems, new communications channels, virtual reality technologies for remote operations, and the Internet of Things (IoT) are crucial to lowering the costs of doing business.

The aims of this study were to explore the impacts of COVID 19 on the students' perceptions of readiness for practice and their preparation for the NCLEX exam and initial clinical practice. METHODS: A cross-sectional descriptive design was used to investigate the impact of COVID-19 on senior BSN students' preparation for NCLEX and future careers. The Casey-Fink Readiness for Practice Survey was used to investigate the perceptions of the BSN students' clinical confidence and readiness for practice. RESULTS: Students reported substantial impacts of COVID-19 on their clinical experiences, their ability to practice skills and procedures, their preparations for NCLEX exam, and their nursing career. The most significant confidence concerns noted from this study seemed to center on handling multiple patient assignments, calling the physician, responding to a change in patient condition, and treating a dying patient. CONCLUSIONS: Healthcare experts expect that the impact of COVID-19 may last until 2022. More research is needed to understand the impact of COVID-19 on nursing education and transition to nursing practice. While clinical confidence and readiness for practice are essential topics, more research is needed to investigate the psychological and physiological impacts of COVID-19 on nurses, nursing students, nursing preceptors, and faculty members.","Musallam, Eyad; A Flinders, Brooke",Int. j. nurs. educ. scholarsh,202,20

When estimating prevalence, a natural missing data problem arises: no test results are generated for non-tested people. In addition, tests are not perfectly predictive for the underlying infection. This is particularly relevant for mass SARS-CoV-2 testing as these are conducted with rapid Antigen tests, which are known to be somewhat imprecise. Using insights from the literature on partial identification, I propose a framework addressing both issues at once. I use the framework to study differing selection assumptions for the Austrian data.

Travel restrictions and emergency regulations have had significant impacts on maternity services, including resource stock-outs, and closure of antenatal clinics during the lockdown period. Estimates of the indirect impact of Covid-19 on maternal and perinatal mortality was expected it to be considerable, but little data was yet available. This study aimed to examine the impact of Covid-19 and lockdown control measures on non-Covid outcomes in a government tertiary level maternity unit in Bulawayo, Zimbabwe, by comparing maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality before, and after the lockdown was implemented. METHODS: This was a retrospective, observational study, using a cross-sectional design to compare routine monthly maternal and perinatal statistics three months before and after Covid-19 emergency measures were implemented at Mpilo Central Hospital. RESULTS: Between January-March and April-June 2020, the mean monthly deliveries reduced from 747.3 (SD ± 61.3) in the first quarter of 2020 to 681.0 (SD ± 17.6) during lockdown, but this was not statistically significant, p = 0.20. The Caesarean section rates fell from a mean of 29.8% (SD ± 1.7) versus 28.0% (SD ± 1.7), which was also not statistically significant, p = 0.18. During lockdown, the percentage of women delivering at Mpilo Central Hospital who were booked at the hospital fell from a mean of 41.6% (SD ± 1.1) to 35.8% (SD ± 4.3) which was statistically significant, p = 0.03. There was no significant change, however, in maternal mortality or severe maternal morbidity (such as post-partum haemorrhage (PPH), uterine rupture, and severe preeclampsia/eclampsia), stillbirth rate or special care baby unit admission. There was an increase in the mean total number of early neonatal deaths (ENND) (mean 18.7 (SD ± 2.9) versus 24.0 (SD ± 4.6), but this was not statistically significant, p = 0.32. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, maternity services at Mpilo showed resilience during the lockdown period, with no significant change in maternal and perinatal adverse outcomes, with the same number of man-hours worked before and during the lockdown Maternal and perinatal outcomes should continue to be monitored to assess the impact of Covid-19 and the lockdown measures as the pandemic in Zimbabwe unfolds. Further studies would be beneficial to explore women's experiences and understand how bookings and deliveries at local clinics changed during this time.","Shakespeare, Clare; Dube, Handsome; Moyo, Sikhangezile; Ngwenya, Solwayo",BMC Pregnancy Childbirth,202,16

The possibility for these persons to enter the job market is limited by stigma. This study explored whether the participation of people with MDs in a job-training course would positively influence employees' opinions about workmates with these disorders. The job-training course was run by company trainers in a megastore 3 times over a 2-year period for a total of 18 participants with MDs. In the training store, employees' views regarding persons with MDs were assessed at pre- and postintervention with the use of matched questionnaires. At postintervention, views among the training store's employees were also compared with those of employees from other stores (controls). Compared with paired preintervention assessment, at postintervention, the training store's employees were more optimistic about recovery; more skeptical about unpredictability, dangerousness, and social distance from persons with MDs; more skeptical about difficulties of these persons in that workplace; more willing to have workmates with MDs; and more confident in the acceptance of workers with MDs by colleagues. Compared with controls, at postintervention, the training store's employees had higher levels of acceptance and lower perception of dangerousness and unpredictability, were more confident in the capacities of persons with MDs to acquire organizational skills and in their acceptance by colleagues, and were surer that having coworkers with MDs would improve the company public image. Providing job-training courses to persons with MDs could be helpful to reduce stigma against such persons in ordinary work contexts.

These models, particularly positive matrix factorization (PMF), have been extensively used for analyzing particle number concentrations (PNCs) datasets. However, the variation of observed PNCs and particle size distribution are driven by both the source emission rates and atmospheric dispersion as well as chemical and physical transformation processes. This variation in the observation data caused by meteorologically induced dilution reduces the ability to obtain accurate source apportionment results. To reduce the influence of dilution on quantitative source estimates, a methodology for improving the accuracy of source apportionment results by incorporating a measure of dispersion, the ventilation coefficient, into the PMF analysis (called dispersion normalized PMF, DN-PMF) was applied to a PNC dataset measured from a field campaign that includes the Spring Festival event and the start of the COVID-19 lockdown in Tianjin, China. The data also included gaseous pollutants and hourly PM2.5 compositional data. Eight factors were resolved and interpreted as municipal incinerator, traffic nucleation, secondary inorganic aerosol (SIA), traffic emissions, photonucleation, coal combustion, residential heating and festival emissions. The DN-PMF enhanced the diel patterns of photonucleation and the two traffic factors by enlarging the differences between daytime peak values and nighttime concentrations. The municipal incinerator plant, traffic emissions, and coal combustion have cleaner and more clearly defined directionalities after dispersion normalization. Thus, dispersion normalized PMF is capable of enhancing the source emission patterns. After the COVID-19 lockdown began, PNC of traffic nucleation and traffic emissions decreased by 41% and 44%, respectively, while photonucleation produced more particles likely due to the reduction in the condensation sink. The significant changes in source emissions indicate a substantially reduced traffic volume after the implement of lockdown measures.","Dai, Qili; Ding, Jing; Song, Congbo; Liu, Baoshuang; Bi, Xiaohui; Wu, Jianhui; Zhang, Yufen; Feng, Yinchang; Hopke, Philip K",Sci Total Environ,202,24

Owing to restrictions in elective surgery and social distancing guidelines, the training curriculum for neurosurgical trainees has been rapidly evolving. This evolution could have significant long-term effects on the training of neurosurgery residents. The objective of the present study was to assess the effects of COVID-19 on neurosurgical training programs and residents. METHODS: A survey consisting of 31 questions assessing changes to resident clinical and educational workload and their sentiment regarding how these changes might affect their careers was distributed electronically to neurosurgery residents in the United States and Canada. RESULTS: The survey respondents were from 29 states and Canada and were relatively evenly spread across all levels of residency. Nearly 82% reported that the inpatient and outpatient volumes had been either greatly (44.0%) or moderately (37.8%) reduced. Greater than 91% reported that their work responsibilities or access to the hospital had been reduced, with a significant reduction in work hours and a significant increase in resident didactics (P < 0.001). Senior residents expressed concern about their educational experience and their future career prospects as a result of the pandemic. CONCLUSION: Universally, residents have experienced reduced work hours and a reduction in their operative case volumes. Programs have adapted by increasing didactic time and using electronic platforms. It is quite possible that this remarkable period will prompt a critical reappraisal of the pre-COVID-19 adequacy of educational content in our training programs and that the enhanced educational efforts driven by this pandemic could be lasting.","Pelargos, Panayiotis E; Chakraborty, Arpan; Zhao, Yan D; Smith, Zachary A; Dunn, Ian F; Bauer, Andrew M",World Neurosurg,202,24

Health regulations indicate a limit up to 160 µg/kg for OA/DTXs, PTXs or AZAs, and 3.75 mg/kg for YTXs.Argopecten purpuratus is one of the most important commercial marine products exploited in Perú. Despite its importance and the periodic reports of the presence of HABs in Peruvian coastal waters, the lack of information regarding potential contamination by LMTs is noteworthy.In this work, we report a study performed with 115 samples of A. purpuratus collected between November 2013 and March 2015 from 18 scallop production areas distributed along the Peruvian coast in search of LMTs. To magnify positive results, the hepatopancreas tissue was analyzed by an LC-MS/MS method implemented to quantify OA, YTX, AZA-1, and PTX-2. Baseline separation was achieved in 19 min. The method showed satisfactory linearity (R 2 > 0.997), precision (coefficient of variation < 15 %), and limit of quantification (0.155-0.479 ng/mL). The study revealed the presence of YTX in 72 samples and of PTX-2 in 17 samples, with both biotoxins found at concentrations below the regulatory limits. Free OA and AZA-1 were not detected in any scallop sample. This atypical profile, presence of PTX-2 in the absence of OA, has been previously reported and may be linked to presence of the dinoflagellate D. acuminata . The production of YTX could be associated to the phytoplankton G. spinifera and P. reticulatum .This is the first systematic assessment of the four groups of LMTs in shellfish from Peruvian coastal waters.

Such a model would be ideal for the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Thus, here, we propose a topological model of an epidemic disease, which can take into account various types of interventions through a time-dependent contact network. Based on this model, we show that there is a maximum allowed number of persons one can see each day for each person so that we can suppress the epidemic spread. Reducing the number of persons to see for the hub persons is a key countermeasure for the current COVID-19 pandemic.","Hirata, Yoshito",Chaos,202,15

METHODS: Cross-sectional study on observational data. In Germany, summer school holidays are coordinated between states and spread out over 13 weeks. Employing a dynamic model with district fixed effects, we analyze the association between these holidays and weekly incidence rates across 401 German districts. RESULTS: We find effects of the holiday period of around 45% of the average district incidence rates in Germany during their respective final week of holidays and the 2 weeks after holidays end. Western states tend to experience stronger effects than Eastern states. We also find statistically significant interaction effects of school holidays with per capita taxable income and the share of foreign residents in a district's population. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that changed behavior during the holiday season accelerated the pandemic and made it considerably more difficult for public health authorities to contain the spread of the virus by means of contact tracing. Germany's public health authorities did not prepare adequately for this acceleration.","Plümper, Thomas; Neumayer, Eric",J. public health (Oxf),202,21

On the other hand, the role of respiratory viruses in the pathogenesis of severe respiratory infections is an issue of great importance. The present literature review was aimed at assessing the potential effects of air pollutants on the transmission and severity of respiratory viral infections. We have reviewed the scientific literature regarding the association of outdoor air pollution and respiratory viruses on respiratory diseases. Evidence supports a clear association between air concentrations of some pollutants and human respiratory viruses interacting to adversely affect the respiratory system. Given the undoubted importance and topicality of the subject, we have paid special attention to the association between air pollutants and the transmission and severity of the effects caused by the coronavirus named SARS-CoV-2, which causes the COVID-19. Although to date, and by obvious reasons, the number of studies on this issue are still scarce, most results indicate that chronic exposure to air pollutants delays/complicates recovery of patients of COVID-19 and leads to more severe and lethal forms of this disease.

Survival prediction is a major concern for NPC patients, as it provides early prognostic information that is needed to guide treatments. Recently, deep learning, which leverages Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) to learn deep representations of image patterns, has been introduced to the survival prediction in various cancers including NPC. It has been reported that image-derived end-to-end deep survival models have the potential to outperform clinical prognostic indicators and traditional radiomics-based survival models in prognostic performance. However, deep survival models, especially 3D models, require large image training data to avoid overfitting. Unfortunately, medical image data is usually scarce, especially for Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography (PET/CT) due to the high cost of PET/CT scanning. Compared to Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) or Computed Tomography (CT) providing only anatomical information of tumors, PET/CT that provides both anatomical (from CT) and metabolic (from PET) information is promising to achieve more accurate survival prediction. However, we have not identified any 3D end-to-end deep survival model that applies to small PET/CT data of NPC patients. In this study, we introduced the concept of multi-task leaning into deep survival models to address the overfitting problem resulted from small data. Tumor segmentation was incorporated as an auxiliary task to enhance the model's efficiency of learning from scarce PET/CT data. Based on this idea, we proposed a 3D end-to-end Deep Multi-Task Survival model (DeepMTS) for joint survival prediction and tumor segmentation. Our DeepMTS can jointly learn survival prediction and tumor segmentation using PET/CT data of only 170 patients with advanced NPC.","Meng, Mingyuan; Gu, Bingxin; Bi, Lei; Song, Shaoli; Feng, David Dagan; Kim, Jinman",,202,16

To this end, we integrate cumulative viral diffusion statistics and local demographic and mobility information of several countries. Our analysis confirms that mobility data have a strong, but delayed, effect on the viral spread. In this context, CoRoNNa has superior performances when compared with other frameworks that incorporate multivariate lagged predictors, and with simple LSTM models.

METHODS: We analyzed data from the 2018 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System to estimate the number of adults who have an elevated risk of serious illness if they are infected with coronavirus in metropolitan, micropolitan, and rural areas for each state. Study data included 430,949 survey responses representing over 255.2 million noninstitutionalized US adults. For data on hospital beds, aggregate survey data were linked to data from the 2017 Area Health Resource Files by state and metropolitan status. FINDINGS: About 50% of rural residents are at high risk for hospitalization and serious illness if they are infected with COVID-19, compared to 46.9% and 40.0% in micropolitan and metropolitan areas, respectively. In 19 states, more than 50% of rural populations are at high risk for serious illness if infected. Rural residents will generate an estimated 10% more hospitalizations for COVID-19 per capita than urban residents given equal infection rates. CONCLUSION: More than half of rural residents are at increased risk of hospitalization and death if infected with COVID-19. Experts expect COVID-19 burden to outpace hospital capacity across the country, and rural areas are no exception. Policy makers need to consider supply chain modifications, regulatory changes, and financial assistance policies to assist rural communities in caring for people affected by COVID-19.","Kaufman, Brystana G; Whitaker, Rebecca; Pink, George; Holmes, G Mark",J Rural Health,202,17

The negative impact of school closures on children and young people is increasingly apparent, however. OBJECTIVE: We aim to evaluate the feasibility of an infection monitoring program in schools to enable targeted quarantining to replace school closures. The program is currently being implemented in two model schools in Magdeburg, Germany, within the framework of the Study of Coronavirus Outbreak Prevention in Magdeburg Schools (Studie zur Ausbruchsvermeidung von Corona an Magdeburger Schulen [STACAMA]). METHODS: Five pupils per class are pseudorandomly selected twice a week and asked to provide a gargle sample over a 16-week evaluation period. RNA is extracted from each sample individually in a laboratory and pooled according to school class for real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) analysis. Immediate individual sample testing will be carried out in the case of a positive pool test. Individual RNA extraction prior to pooling and application of rRT-PCR result in high test sensitivity. Testing will be performed in strict adherence to data protection standards. All participating pupils will receive a 16-digit study code, which they will be able to use to access their test. RESULTS: When the study commenced on December 2, 2020, 520 (52%) pupils and their families or guardians had consented to study participation. The study was suspended after four test rounds due to renewed school closures resulting from rising regional infection incidence. Testing resumed when schools reopened on March 8, 2021, at which time consent to participation was provided for 54% of pupils. We will quantitatively and qualitatively evaluate the logistics and acceptability of the program. CONCLUSIONS: The findings from this study should inform the design of infection surveillance programs in schools based on gargle samples and a PCR-based pool testing procedure, enabling the identification of aspects that may require adaptation before large-scale implementation. Our focus on each step of the logistics and on the experiences of families should enable a robust assessment of the feasibility of such an approach.

Viral entry is dependent on the binding of the viral spike protein to the angiotensin converting enzyme II protein (ACE2) on the host cell surface, followed by proteolytic cleavage by a host serine protease such as TMPRSS2. Infection of alveolar epithelial cells (AEC) in the distal lung is a key feature in progression to the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). We hypothesized that AEC expression of ACE2 is induced by hypoxia. In a murine model of hypoxic stress (12% FiO2), the total lung Ace2 mRNA and protein expression was significantly increased after 24 hours in hypoxia compared to normoxia (21% FiO2). In experiments with primary murine type II AEC, we found that exposure to hypoxia either in vivo (prior to isolation) or in vitro resulted in greatly increased AEC expression of both Ace2 (mRNA and protein) and of Tmprss2. However, when isolated type II AEC were maintained in culture over 5 days, with loss of type II cell characteristics and induction of type I cell features, Ace2 expression was greatly reduced, suggesting that this expression was a feature of only this subset of AEC. Finally, in primary human small airway epithelial cells (SAEC), ACE2 mRNA and protein expression were also induced by hypoxia, as was binding to purified spike protein. Hypoxia-induced increase in ACE2 expression in type II AEC may provide an explanation of the extended temporal course of human patients who develop ARDS in COVID-19.","Sturrock, Anne; Zimmerman, Elizabeth; Helms, My; Liou, Theodore G; Paine, Robert",Physiol Rep,202,26

In the context of the social determinants of health, focusing on health system preparedness is paramount for protecting the health of all of society. Faced with old threats (e.g., re-emergence of measles), disruptive new technologies (e.g., electronic cigarettes), increased challenges (e.g. drug-resistant organisms), and new threats (e.g., the current pandemic, climate change, politicized misinformation), our health systems must be robust and resilient. The response must include those who now suffer disproportionately-the poor and the vulnerable. Current World Health Organization priorities call for infrastructures capable of detecting, monitoring, and responding to health emergencies, such as COVID-19, and the health impacts of climate change in the context of health for all. Health care infrastructure can be better prepared and more equitable if systems are strengthened by building on core competencies and following the recommendations made for leadership, stakeholder involvement, accreditation, data collection, and funding resources.

To investigate the influence of a high local incidence setting, we conducted the SAFE KiDS 2 study. 577 children and 334 staff members of 47 day care centers were tested for respiratory and gastrointestinal shedding of SARS-CoV-2, and three infections with SARS-CoV-2 in the infectious period were detected. We conclude that viral shedding occurred infrequently while the original ""wild-type"" variant was dominant. The more transmissible SARS-CoV-2 variant Alpha (B.1.1.7) became the dominant strain after SAFE KiDS 2 was concluded. The SAFE KiDS 3 study investigated the impact of the Alpha variant of SARS-CoV-2 on inapparent viral shedding in the day care setting. In this study, 756 children and 226 staff members from 46 day care centers provided self-collected saliva swabs, the so-called ""Lollipop"" swabs, which were tested by RT-PCR. In the four-week study period, none of the participants tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA, demonstrating that inapparent shedding of SARS-CoV-2 in the day care setting was also rare during the dominance of the Alpha variant. The influence of the variant of concern Delta on day care centers has yet to be studied.","Schenk, Barbara; Hoehl, Sebastian; Rudych, Olga; Kreutzer, Emilie; Menger, Dominic; Farmand, Samira; Gebert, Daniela; Flohr, Melanie; Berger, Franziska; Wrobel, Franziska; Weigel, Vanessa; Kortenbusch, Marhild; Berger, Annemarie; Ciesek, Sandra",,202,0

Automated detection of lung infections from computed tomography (CT) images offers a great potential to augment the traditional healthcare strategy for tackling COVID-19. However, segmenting infected regions from CT slices faces several challenges, including high variation in infection characteristics, and low intensity contrast between infections and normal tissues. Further, collecting a large amount of data is impractical within a short time period, inhibiting the training of a deep model. To address these challenges, a novel COVID-19 Lung Infection Segmentation Deep Network (Inf-Net) is proposed to automatically identify infected regions from chest CT slices. In our Inf-Net, a parallel partial decoder is used to aggregate the high-level features and generate a global map. Then, the implicit reverse attention and explicit edge-attention are utilized to model the boundaries and enhance the representations. Moreover, to alleviate the shortage of labeled data, we present a semi-supervised segmentation framework based on a randomly selected propagation strategy, which only requires a few labeled images and leverages primarily unlabeled data. Our semi-supervised framework can improve the learning ability and achieve a higher performance. Extensive experiments on our COVID-SemiSeg and real CT volumes demonstrate that the proposed Inf-Net outperforms most cutting-edge segmentation models and advances the state-of-the-art performance.","Fan, Deng-Ping; Zhou, Tao; Ji, Ge-Peng; Zhou, Yi; Chen, Geng; Fu, Huazhu; Shen, Jianbing; Shao, Ling",IEEE Trans Med Imaging,202,29

Lianhuaqingwen capsule (LHQW-C), a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) formula widely used for respiratory diseases, shows therapeutic efficacy in the application of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, the active ingredients, drug targets, and the therapeutic mechanisms of LHQW-C in treating COVID-19 are poorly understood. In this study, an integrating network pharmacology approach including pharmacokinetic screening, target prediction (targets of the host and targets from the SARS-CoV-2), network analysis, GO enrichment analysis, KEGG pathway enrichment analysis, and virtual docking were conducted. Finally, 158 active ingredients in LHQW-C were screen out, and 49 targets were predicted. GO function analysis revealed that these targets were associated with inflammatory response, oxidative stress reaction, and other biological processes. KEGG enrichment analysis indicated that the targets of LHQW-C were highly enriched to several immune response-related and inflammation-related pathways, including the IL-17 signaling pathway, TNF signaling pathway, NF-kappa B signaling pathway, and Th17 cell differentiation. Moreover, four key components (quercetin, luteolin, wogonin, and kaempferol) showed a high binding affinity with SARS-CoV-2 3-chymotrypsin-like protease (3CL pro).

Organizations have long utilized informal structures known as “skunk works”, flexible groups empowered to work rapidly with minimal management constraints, to address technological challenges. In this article, we aim to better understand when and how organizations similarly employ skunk works-like structures to help them deal with rapidly evolving HR-related challenges. We discuss three examples of organizations that have utilized this approach. We then integrate the learning insights from these examples to develop a framework supported by a set of research questions to guide future scholarship into HR skunk works. We emphasize that there are both benefits and drawbacks of innovative organizational structures for addressing HR challenges alongside regular, established ways of working.","Biron, Michal; De Cieri, Helen; Fulmer, Ingrid; Lin, Cai-Hui; Mayrhofer, Wolfgang; Nyfoudi, Margarita; Sanders, Karin; Shipton, Helen; Sun, Jian Min",Hum.

There is a mechanistic relationship between intracellular coronavirus replication and deregulated autophagosome-lysosome system. We performed transcriptome analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from COVID-19 patients and identified the aberrant upregulation of genes in the lysosome pathway. We further determined the capability of two circulating markers, namely microtubule-associated proteins 1A/1B light chain 3B (LC3B) and (p62/SQSTM1) p62, both of which depend on lysosome for degradation, in predicting the emergence of moderate-to-severe disease in COVID-19 patients requiring hospitalization for supplemental oxygen therapy. Logistic regression analyses showed that LC3B was associated with moderate-to-severe COVID-19, independent of age, sex and clinical risk score. A decrease in LC3B concentration <5.5 ng/ml increased the risk of oxygen and ventilatory requirement (adjusted odds ratio: 4.6; 95% CI: 1.1-22.0; P = 0.04). Serum concentrations of p62 in the moderate-to-severe group were significantly lower in patients aged 50 or below. In conclusion, lysosome function is deregulated in PBMCs isolated from COVID-19 patients, and the related biomarker LC3B may serve as a novel tool for stratifying patients with moderate-to-severe COVID-19 from those with asymptomatic or mild disease. COVID-19 patients with a decrease in LC3B concentration <5.5 ng/ml will require early hospital admission for supplemental oxygen therapy and other respiratory support.","Fang, Shisong; Zhang, Lin; Liu, Yingzhi; Xu, Wenye; Wu, Weihua; Huang, Ziheng; Wang, Xin; Liu, Hui; Sun, Ying; Zhang, Renli; Peng, Bo; Liu, Xiaodong; Sun, Xiao; Yu, Jun; Chan, Francis Ka Leung; Ng, Siew Chien; Wong, Sunny Hei; Wang, Maggie Hai Tian; Gin, Tony; Joynt, Gavin Matthew; Hui, David Shu Cheong; Feng, Tiejian; Wu, William Ka Kei; Chan, Matthew Tak Vai; Zou, Xuan; Xia, Junjie",Brief Bioinform,202,16

Inferring the intentional states of our interaction partners is crucial in achieving this, and social neuroscience has begun elucidating the intra- and inter-personal neural processes supporting such inferences. Typically, however, neuroscientific paradigms lack the reciprocal to-and-fro characteristic of social communication, offering little insight into the way these processes operate online during real-world interaction. In the present study, we overcame this by developing a ""hyperscanning"" paradigm in which pairs of interactants could communicate verbally with one another in a joint-action task whilst both undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging simultaneously. Successful performance on this task required both interlocutors to predict their partner's upcoming utterance in order to converge on the same word as each other over recursive exchanges, based only on one another's prior verbal expressions. By applying various levels of analysis to behavioural and neuroimaging data acquired from 20 dyads, three principle findings emerged: First, interlocutors converged frequently within the same semantic space, suggesting that mutual understanding had been established. Second, assessing the brain responses of each interlocutor as they planned their upcoming utterances on the basis of their co-player's previous word revealed the engagement of the temporo-parietal junctional (TPJ), precuneus and dorso-lateral pre-frontal cortex. Moreover, responses in the precuneus were modulated positively by the degree of semantic convergence achieved on each round. Second, effective connectivity among these regions indicates the crucial role of the right TPJ in this process, consistent with the Nexus model. Third, neural signals within certain nodes of this network became aligned between interacting interlocutors. We suggest this reflects an interpersonal neural process through which interactants infer and align to one another's intentional states whilst they establish a common ground.","Salazar, M; Shaw, D J; Gajdos, M; Marecek, R; Czekóová, K; Mikl, M; Brázdil, M",Neuroimage,202,26

Understanding how hospitals can continue providing services in an effective manner under these circumstances is thus important. In this study, we investigate how information technology (IT) helped hospitals in mainland China better respond to the outbreak of the pandemic. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a content analysis of pages published on the websites of the top 50 hospitals in mainland China between January 22 and February 21, 2020. In total, we analyzed 368 pages that the hospitals published during the initial days of the COVID-19 pandemic. The purpose was to identify common themes related to the utilization of IT by these hospitals in response to the pandemic's outbreak. RESULTS: We identified 5 focal themes across the webpages published by the hospitals during our study period, including (1) popular medical science education, (2) digitalized hospital processes, (3) knowledge management for medical professionals, (4) telemedicine, and (5) new IT initiatives for healthcare services. Our analysis revealed that Chinese hospitals spent greater effort in promoting popular medical science education in the initial stages of our study period and more on telemedicine in the latter stages.

The nature and extent of critical issues raised by this ongoing crisis, including challenging ethical dilemmas for the health care profession, is likely to have an indelible impact on the professional identity formation (PIF) of learners and practitioners across the trajectory of the professional lifecycle. The lifelong process of PIF for health care practitioners, from learner through independent practice, is supported in medical education by intentional reflection, relationships within community of practice include guidance from mentoring, as well as resilience, both emotional and moral. We consider how grappling with ethical dilemmas related to the COVID-19 pandemic can challenge, inform, and even potentially transform the PIF process, thereby supporting development of a morally resilient, humanistic professional identity in health care trainees and health care professionals.","Wald, Hedy S; Ruddy, Meaghan",J Contin Educ Health Prof,202,10

Fear and concern over vaccine side-effects is one of the main drivers of hesitancy. Drawing from behavioral science and health communication theory, we conducted a randomized controlled trial among 8998 adults to determine whether the way COVID-19 vaccine side-effects are framed and presented to individuals can influence their willingness to take a vaccine. We presented participants information on a hypothetical future COVID-19 vaccine -- including information on its side-effect rate -- and then examined the effect of three side-effect framing strategies on individuals stated willingness to take this vaccine: adding a qualitative risk label next to the numerical risk, adding comparison risks, and for those presented with comparisons, framing the comparison in relative rather than absolute terms. Based on a pre-registered and published analysis plan, we found that adding a simple descriptive risk label (very low risk) next to the numerical side-effect increased participants' willingness to take the COVID-19 vaccine by 3.0 percentage points (p = 0.003). Providing a comparison to motor vehicle mortality increased COVID-19 vaccine willingness by 2.4 percentage points (p = 0.051). These effects were independent and additive: participants that received both a qualitative risk label and comparison to motor-vehicle mortality were 6.1 percentage points (p < 0.001) more likely to report willingness to take a vaccine compared to those who did not receive a label or comparison. Taken together, our results reveal that despite increasingly strong vaccination hesitancy and exposure to large amounts of vaccine misinformation, low-cost side-effect framing strategies can meaningfully affect vaccination intentions at a population level.","Sudharsanan, Nikkil; Favaretti, Caterina; Hachaturyan, Violetta; Baernighausen, Till; Vandormael, Alain",,202,24

A major underlying cause of COVID-19 mortality is a hyperinflammatory cytokine storm in severe/critically ill patients. Although many clinical trials are testing the efficacy of targeting inflammatory cytokines/chemokines in COVID-19 patients, the critical inflammatory mediator initiating COVID-19 patient death is undefined. Here we suggest that the immunopathological pathway leading to COVID-19 mortality can be divided into three stages with distinct clinical features that can be used to guide therapeutic strategies. Our interpretation of the recently published clinical trials from COVID-19 patients suggests that the clinical efficacy in preventing COVID-19 mortality using IL-1 blockade is subjected to notable caveats, while that for IL-6 blockade is suboptimal. We discuss critical factors in determining appropriate inflammatory cytokine/chemokine targets, timing, and combination of treatments to prevent COVID-19 mortality.","Lu, Ligong; Zhang, Hui; Zhan, Meixiao; Jiang, Jun; Yin, Hua; Dauphars, Danielle J; Li, Shi-You; Li, Yong; He, You-Wen",Front Cell Dev Biol,202,16

The planned roll-out in the UK will involve vaccinating people in high-risk categories with their first dose immediately, and delivering the second dose 12 weeks later. Here, we provide both a further prespecified pooled analysis of trials of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 and exploratory analyses of the impact on immunogenicity and efficacy of extending the interval between priming and booster doses. In addition, we show the immunogenicity and protection afforded by the first dose, before a booster dose has been offered. METHODS: We present data from three single-blind randomised controlled trials-one phase 1/2 study in the UK (COV001), one phase 2/3 study in the UK (COV002), and a phase 3 study in Brazil (COV003)-and one double-blind phase 1/2 study in South Africa (COV005). As previously described, individuals 18 years and older were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive two standard doses of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (5â×â1010 viral particles) or a control vaccine or saline placebo. In the UK trial, a subset of participants received a lower dose (2·2â×â1010 viral particles) of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 for the first dose. The primary outcome was virologically confirmed symptomatic COVID-19 disease, defined as a nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT)-positive swab combined with at least one qualifying symptom (fever &#8805;37·8°C, cough, shortness of breath, or anosmia or ageusia) more than 14 days after the second dose. Secondary efficacy analyses included cases occuring at least 22 days after the first dose. Antibody responses measured by immunoassay and by pseudovirus neutralisation were exploratory outcomes. All cases of COVID-19 with a NAAT-positive swab were adjudicated for inclusion in the analysis by a masked independent endpoint review committee. The primary analysis included all participants who were SARS-CoV-2 N protein seronegative at baseline, had had at least 14 days of follow-up after the second dose, and had no evidence of previous SARS-CoV-2 infection from NAAT swabs. Safety was assessed in all participants who received at least one dose. The four trials are registered at ISRCTN89951424 (COV003) and ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04324606 (COV001), NCT04400838 (COV002), and NCT04444674 (COV005). FINDINGS: Between April 23 and Dec 6, 2020, 24â422 participants were recruited and vaccinated across the four studies, of whom 17â178 were included in the primary analysis (8597 receiving ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 and 8581 receiving control vaccine). The data cutoff for these analyses was Dec 7, 2020. 332 NAAT-positive infections met the primary endpoint of symptomatic infection more than 14 days after the second dose. Overall vaccine efficacy more than 14 days after the second dose was 66·7% (95% CI 57·4-74·0), with 84 (1·0%) cases in the 8597 participants in the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 group and 248 (2·9%) in the 8581 participants in the control group. There were no hospital admissions for COVID-19 in the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 group after the initial 21-day exclusion period, and 15 in the control group. 108 (0·9%) of 12â282 participants in the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 group and 127 (1·1%) of 11â962 participants in the control group had serious adverse events. There were seven deaths considered unrelated to vaccination (two in the ChAdOx1 nCov-19 group and five in the control group), including one COVID-19-related death in one participant in the control group. Exploratory analyses showed that vaccine efficacy after a single standard dose of vaccine from day 22 to day 90 after vaccination was 76·0% (59·3-85·9). Our modelling analysis indicated that protection did not wane during this initial 3-month period. Similarly, antibody levels were maintained during this period with minimal waning by day 90 (geometric mean ratio [GMR] 0·66 [95% CI 0·59-0·74]). In the participants who received two standard doses, after the second dose, efficacy was higher in those with a longer prime-boost interval (vaccine efficacy 81·3% [95% CI 60·3-91·2] at &#8805;12 weeks) than in those with a short interval (vaccine efficacy 55·1% [33·0-69·9] at <6 weeks). These observations are supported by immunogenicity data that showed binding antibody responses more than two-fold higher after an interval of 12 or more weeks compared with an interval of less than 6 weeks in those who were aged 18-55 years (GMR 2·32 [2·01-2·68]). INTERPRETATION: The results of this primary analysis of two doses of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 were consistent with those seen in the interim analysis of the trials and confirm that the vaccine is efficacious, with results varying by dose interval in exploratory analyses. A 3-month dose interval might have advantages over a programme with a short dose interval for roll-out of a pandemic vaccine to protect the largest number of individuals in the population as early as possible when supplies are scarce, while also improving protection after receiving a second dose.

However, the dynamics of virus shedding during the various phases of the clinical course of COVID-19 remains unclear at this stage. METHODS: A total of 18 patients found to be positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection by real-time reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) assay and admitted to Chongqing University Central Hospital between 29 January and 5 February 2020 were enrolled into this study. Medical data, pulmonary computed tomographic (CT) scan images and RT-PCR results were periodically collected during the patients' hospital stay. All participants were actively followed up for 2 weeks after discharge. RESULTS: A total of nine (50%) asymptomatic patients and nine (50%) patients with mild symptoms of COVID-19 were identified at admission. Six patients (66.7%) who were asymptomatic at admission developed subjective symptoms during hospitalization and were recategorized as being presymptomatic. The median duration of virus shedding was 11.5, 28 and 31 days for presymptomatic, asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic patients, separately. Seven patients (38.9%) continued to shed virus after hospital discharge. During the convalescent phase, detectable antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 and RNA were simultaneously observed in five patients (27.8%). CONCLUSIONS: Long-term virus shedding was documented in patients with mild symptoms and in asymptomatic patients. Specific antibody production to SARS-CoV-2 may not guarantee virus clearance after discharge. These observations should be considered when making decisions regarding clinical and public health, and when considering strategies for the prevention and control of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Li, W; Su, Y-Y; Zhi, S-S; Huang, J; Zhuang, C-L; Bai, W-Z; Wan, Y; Meng, X-R; Zhang, L; Zhou, Y-B; Luo, Y-Y; Ge, S-X; Chen, Y-K; Ma, Y",Clin Microbiol Infect,202,20

Characterizing global genomic surveillance, sequencing coverage, the extent of publicly available genomic data coupled with traditional epidemiologic data can provide evidence to inform SARS-CoV-2 surveillance and control strategies. Methods We collected country-specific data on SARS-CoV-2 genomic surveillance, sequencing capabilities, public genomic data, and aggregated publicly available variant data. We divided countries into three levels of genomic surveillance and sequencing availability based on predefined criteria. We downloaded the merged and deduplicated SARS-CoV-2 sequences from multiple public repositories, and used different proxies to estimate the sequencing coverage and public availability extent of genomic data, in addition to describing the global dissemination of variants. Findings Since the start of 2021, the COVID-19 global epidemic clearly featured increasing circulation of Alpha, which was rapidly replaced by the Delta variant starting around May 2021 and reaching a global prevalence of 96.6% at the end of July 2021. SARS-CoV-2 genomic surveillance and sequencing availability varied markedly across countries, with 63 countries performing routine genomic surveillance and 79 countries with high availability of SARS-CoV-2 sequencing. Less than 3.5% of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections were sequenced globally since September 2020, with the lowest sequencing coverage in the WHO regions of Eastern Mediterranean, South East Asia, and Africa. Across different variants, 28-52% of countries with explicit reporting on variants shared less than half of their variant sequences in public repositories.

The questionnaire inquired about the sociodemographic characteristics (e.g., age, gender, education, geographical location), presence of chronic health conditions and the use of prescription medications, awareness of the viral nature of COVID-19 infection and its common symptoms, and the commonly utilized herbal and/or dietary supplements. RESULTS: Sixty-four percent of the 1473 participants reported using herbal and/or dietary supplements for the purpose of boosting their immune system to prevent COVID-19 infection. In addition, 88.2% of the respondents were misinformed about the manifestation of COVID-19 symptoms. Most of the participants were Saudi (91.9%), aged 49 years and younger (83%), female (52%), and healthy (81%). Honey (46%), lemon (45%), ginger (36%), vitamin C (32%), black seed (26%), garlic (26%), and turmeric (19%) were the most commonly used herbal and/or dietary supplements by the participants. Saudi nationals (OR = 1.67, 95% CI: 1.08 to 2.6, p = 0.02), older adults (OR = 1.30, 95% CI:1.10 to 1.55, p = 0.002), and those taking prescription medications had higher odds of using dietary and/or herbal supplements (OR = 3.31, 95% CI: 2.61 to 4.18, p &lt; 0.0001). CONCLUSION: The utilization rate of herbal and dietary supplements among the Saudi public during the COVID-19 pandemic is high. Future studies should examine the impact of different public awareness campaigns aimed at improving the public knowledge of the risk and benefits associated with the use of different commonly utilized herbal and dietary products identified in this study.","AlNajrany, S.

Immunoinformatics approach in vaccine design takes advantage of antigenic and non-allergenic epitopes present on the spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 to elicit immune responses. T cells and B cells epitopes were predicted, and the selected residues were subjected to allergenicity, antigenicity and toxicity screening which were linked by appropriate linkers to form a multi-epitope subunit vaccine. The physiochemical properties of the vaccine construct was analyzed and the molecular weight, molecular formula, theoretical isoelectric point value, half-life, solubility score, instability index, aliphatic index and GRAVY were predicted. The vaccine structure was constructed, refined, validated, and disulfide engineered to get the best model. Molecular binding simulation and molecular dynamics simulation were carried out to predict the stability and binding affinity of the vaccine construct with TLRs. Codon acclimatization and in silico cloning were performed to confirm the vaccine expression and potency. Results obtained indicated that this novel vaccine candidate is non-toxic, capable of initiating the immunogenic response and will not induce an allergic reaction. The highest binding energy was observed in TLR 4 (-1398.1) and the least is TLR 2 (-1479. 6). The steady rise in Th (helper) cell population with memory development was noticed and IFN-g was provoked after simulation. At this point, the vaccine candidate awaits animal trial to validate its efficacy and safety for use in the prevention of the novel COVID-19 infections.","Oladipo, Elijah Kolawole; Ajayi, Ayodeji Folorunsho; Ariyo, Olumuyiwa Elijah; Onile, Samson Olugbenga; Jimah, Esther Moradeyo; Ezediuno, Odinakaose Louis; Adebayo, Oluwadunsin Iyanuoluwa; Adebayo, Emmanuel Tayo; Odeyemi, Aduragbemi Noah; Oyeleke, Marvellous Oluwaseun; Oyewole, Moyosoluwa Precious; Oguntomi, Ayomide Samuel; Akindiya, Olawumi Elizabeth; Olamoyegun, Bunmi Olayemi; Aremu, Victoria Oyetayo; Arowosaye, Abiola O.; Aboderin, Dorcas Olubunmi; Bello, B.

The glutathione S-conjugate is sequentially converted to the cysteinylglycine-, cysteine- and N-acetyl-cysteine S-conjugate (mercapturate). The mercapturate is generally more polar and water soluble than the parent electrophile and is readily excreted. Excretion of the mercapturate represents a detoxication mechanism. Some endogenous compounds, such as leukotrienes, prostaglandin (PG) A2, 15-deoxy-Δ(12,14)-PGJ(2), and hydroxynonenal can also be metabolized to mercapturates and excreted. On occasion, however, formation of glutathione S- and cysteine S-conjugates are bioactivation events as the metabolites are mutagenic and/or cytotoxic. When the cysteine S-conjugate contains a strong electron-withdrawing group attached at the sulfur, it may be converted by cysteine S-conjugate β-lyases to pyruvate, ammonium and the original electrophile modified to contain an –SH group. If this modified electrophile is highly reactive then the enzymes of the mercapturate pathway together with the cysteine S-conjugate β-lyases constitute a bioactivation pathway. Some endogenous halogenated environmental contaminants and drugs are bioactivated by this mechanism. Recent studies suggest that coupling of enzymes of the mercapturate pathway to cysteine S-conjugate β-lyases may be more common in nature and more widespread in the metabolism of electrophilic xenobiotics than previously realized.","Cooper, A.J.L.; Hanigan, M.H.",Comprehensive Toxicology,202,16

This survey study explored primary care physicians’ intentions to use telemedicine by using a newly developed questionnaire: Physician Attitudes and Intentions to use Telemedicine. METHODS: An anonymous web-survey with questions focusing on theory-based predictors of behavioral intentions such as Attitudes, Subjective norms and Perceived behavioral control was designed, validated, and sent to all primary care physicians at 160 primary health care centers in southern Sweden from May to August 2019. The questionnaire had 29 subject items (including 49 multiple-choice sub-items). Main outcome measures were intentions to use three domains of telemedicine and correlation between theory-based predictors and behavioral intentions for using telemedicine. RESULTS: The survey was validated by an expert group, amended, and then tested and retested. A majority of the 198 physicians who returned the web-surveys reported that they did not use e-mails (68%), nor video consultations (78%), chat (81%), or text messages (86%) in their everyday patient work. Yet, most physicians described a positive intention to use telemedicine in patient care for all three studied domains with Attitudes and Perceived behavioral control being significant predictors (p<0.01) for Intentions to use digital contacts (R(2) = 0.54), chronic disease monitoring with digital tools (R(2) = 0.47) and artificial intelligence (R(2) = 0.54). A structural validation of a preliminary instrument – Physician Attitudes and Intention to use Telemedicine (PAIT) – containing 28 sub-items was done by exploratory factor analysis with acceptable explanatory, reliability and sampling adequacy measures. Five factors emerged with Eigenvalues between 1.6 and 11.1 explaining 72% of the variance. Total Cronbach’s alpha was 0.91 and Kaiser-Meyer-Olkirk 0.79. CONCLUSION: Before the covid-19 pandemic, Swedish primary care physicians reported a low use yet high behavioral intention to use telemedicine in a study where we developed the preliminary instrument Physician Attitudes and Intention to use Telemedicine. Perceived behavioral control had the largest predictive value of behavioral intention to use telemedicine. Thus, interventions aiming to increase the use of digital tools in primary care should possibly focus on empowering physicians’ self-efficacy towards using them.","Pikkemaat, Miriam; Thulesius, Hans; Milos Nymberg, Veronica",Int J Gen Med,202,32

In this study, the presence of these viruses in palatine tonsils was comprehensively studied in both children and adults. A cross‐sectional analysis of 181 patients (median age 22 years; range, 2.6‐66) operated for a benign tonsillar disease was conducted. Real‐time polymerase chain reaction was performed to detect 27 distinct viruses in all: eight human herpesviruses, 16 respiratory viruses, parvo B19, and polyoma BK/JC viruses. Clinical characteristics of the patients and underlying conditions were evaluated. In total, 92% of patients had virus detected in tonsils (Epstein‐Barr virus 72%, human herpesvirus 7, and 6B 54% and 16%, respectively, enterovirus 18%, parvovirus B19 7% and the rest <4%). No herpes simplex virus 2, varicella zoster virus, polyoma JC virus, parainfluenza‐, metapneumo‐, or coronaviruses were found. Enterovirus was more common in children and was frequently observed in the presence of HHV6B. None of the viruses showed a positive association to the tonsillar disease. Respiratory symptoms were not associated with the prevalence of viruses. This study comprehensively reports a cross‐sectional view of intratonsillar virus infections in elective tonsillectomy patients in a wide age range cohort.

Understanding smokers’ responses to the pandemic will help assess its public health impact and inform future public health and provider messages to smokers. OBJECTIVE: To assess risk perceptions and change in tobacco use among current and former smokers during the COVID-19 pandemic. DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey conducted in May–July 2020 (55% response rate) PARTICIPANTS: 694 current and former daily smokers (mean age 53, 40% male, 78% white) who had been hospitalized pre-COVID-19 and enrolled into a smoking cessation clinical trial at hospitals in Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, and Tennessee. MAIN MEASURES: Perceived risk of COVID-19 due to tobacco use; changes in tobacco consumption and interest in quitting tobacco use; self-reported quitting and relapse since January 2020. KEY RESULTS: 68% (95% CI, 65–72%) of respondents believed that smoking increases the risk of contracting COVID-19 or having a more severe case. In adjusted analyses, perceived risk was higher in Massachusetts where COVID-19 had already surged than in Pennsylvania and Tennessee which were pre-surge during survey administration (AOR 1.56, 95% CI, 1.07–2.28). Higher perceived COVID-19 risk was associated with increased interest in quitting smoking (AOR 1.72, 95% CI 1.01–2.92). During the pandemic, 32% (95% CI, 27–37%) of smokers increased, 37% (95% CI, 33–42%) decreased, and 31% (95% CI, 26–35%) did not change their cigarette consumption. Increased smoking was associated with higher perceived stress (AOR 1.49, 95% CI 1.16–1.91). Overall, 11% (95% CI, 8–14%) of respondents who smoked in January 2020 (pre-COVID-19) had quit smoking at survey (mean, 6 months later) while 28% (95% CI, 22–34%) of former smokers relapsed. Higher perceived COVID-19 risk was associated with higher odds of quitting and lower odds of relapse. CONCLUSIONS: Most smokers believed that smoking increased COVID-19 risk. Smokers’ responses to the pandemic varied, with increased smoking related to stress and increased quitting associated with perceived COVID-19 vulnerability.

To establish a proper quarantine strategy, it is essential to understand how easily the virus can spread in the communities. METHODS: In this study, we collected detailed information on the circumstances in which human-to-human transmission occurred in the tertiary transmission cases of COVID-19 in the community. RESULTS: On January 26, 2020, an imported case of COVID-19 was confirmed, and by February 10, 2020, one secondary transmission and three tertiary transmissions were identified. Secondary transmission occurred on the first day of illness of the infector, and his symptoms were suggestive of a common cold. The transmission occurred during a 90-minute long meal together in a restaurant. The people were sitting within one meter of each other, and had no direct contact. The tertiary transmission also occurred on the first-day illness of the other infector, and his only symptom was slight chills. The transmission occurred at a church during 2-hour-long worship, and two rows separated them.

Before the pandemic, corporate net lending activities had been increasing for decades due to various factors ranging from the rise in uncertainty after the global financial crisis to the increased reliance on internal funding for research and development expenditures. In Germany, the rise in corporate saving was accompanied by an increase in equity capital and a reduction in the corporate sector’s reliance on bank loans. This article argues that the coronavirus crisis is most likely to interrupt the trend in corporate saving in the short run due to the decline in companies’ revenues. Nonetheless, similar to the pattern observed in the aftermath of the financial crisis, it seems reasonable to conjecture that the COVID-19 shock will strengthen corporate saving in the long run as companies may attempt to restore their liquidity and equity capital buffers to better prepare for future shocks. This will in turn create downward pressure on real interest rates and complicate the conduct of monetary policy.","Demary, Markus; Hasenclever, Stefan; Hüther, Michael",Inter Econ,202,21

To identify trends in SSA preparedness, the World Health Organization (WHO) Joint External Evaluation (JEE) reports were analysed. JEEs are voluntary, collaborative processes to assess country’s capacities to prevent, detect and rapidly respond to public health risks. This report aimed to analyse the JEE zoonotic disease preparedness data as a whole and identify strengths and weaknesses. METHODS: JEE zoonotic disease preparedness scores for 44 SSA countries who had completed JEEs were analysed. An overall zoonotic disease preparedness score was calculated as an average of the sum of all the SSA country zoonotic disease preparedness scores and compared to the overall mean JEE score. Zoonotic disease preparedness indicators were analysed and data were collated into regions to identify key areas of strength. RESULTS: The mean ‘Zoonotic disease’ preparedness score (2.35, range 1.00–4.00) was 7% higher compared to the mean overall JEE preparedness score (2.19, range 1.55–3.30), putting ‘Zoonotic Diseases’ 5th out of 19 JEE sub-areas for preparedness. The average scores for each ‘Zoonotic Disease’ category were 2.45 for ‘Surveillance Systems’, 2.76 for ‘Veterinary Workforce’ and 1.84 for ‘Response Mechanisms’. The Southern African region scored highest across the ‘Zoonotic disease’ categories (2.87). A multisectoral priority zoonotic pathogens list is in place for 43% of SSA countries and 70% reported undertaking national surveillance on 1–5 zoonotic diseases. 70% of SSA countries reported having public health training courses in place for veterinarians and 30% had veterinarians in all districts (reported as sufficient staffing). A multisectoral action plan for zoonotic outbreaks was in place for 14% countries and 32% reported having an established inter-agency response team for zoonotic outbreaks. The zoonotic diseases that appeared most in reported country priority lists were rabies and Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) (both 89%), anthrax (83%), and brucellosis (78%). CONCLUSIONS: With ‘Zoonotic Diseases’ ranking 5th in the JEE sub-areas and a mean SSA score 7% greater than the overall mean JEE score, zoonotic disease preparedness appears to have the attention of most SSA countries. However, the considerable range suggests that some countries have more measures in place than others, which may perhaps reflect the geography and types of pathogens that commonly occur. The category ‘Response Mechanisms’ had the lowest mean score across SSA, suggesting that implementing a multisectoral action plan and response team could provide the greatest gains.","Elton, Linzy; Haider, Najmul; Kock, Richard; Thomason, Margaret J.; Tembo, John; Arruda, Liã Bárbara; Ntoumi, Francine; Zumla, Alimuddin; McHugh, Timothy D.",One Health Outlook,202,27

S protein is highly glycosylated, whereas its O-glycosylation is still poorly understood. Herein, we site-specifically examine the O-glycosylation of S protein through a mass spectrometric approach with HCD-triggered-ETD model. We identify 15 high-confidence O-glycosites and at least 10 distinct O-glycan structures on S protein. Peptide microarray assays prove that human ppGalNAc-T6 actively participates in O-glycosylation of S protein. Importantly, the upregulation of ppGalNAc-T6 expression can profoundly enhance the O-glycosylation level by generating new O-glycosites and increasing both O-glycan heterogeneity and intensities. Further molecular dynamics simulations reveal that the O-glycosylation on the protomer-interface regions, which are mainly modified by ppGalNAc-T6, can potentially stabilize the trimeric S protein structure. Our work provides deep molecular insights of how viral infection harnesses the host O-glycosyltransferases to dynamically regulate the O-glycosylation level of the viral envelope protein responsible for membrane fusion.","Xu, Zhijue; Ku, Xin; Tian, Jiaqi; Zhang, Han; Hou, Jingli; Zhang, Can; Shi, Jingjing; Li, Yang; Kaji, Hiroyuki; Tao, Sheng-Ce; Kuno, Atsushi; Yan, Wei; Da, Lin-Tai; Zhang, Yan",bioRxiv,202,16

Here, we discuss ongoing efforts in bridging the gap between in vivo and in vitro interfaces and identify some of the bioengineering challenges that lie ahead in delivering new generations of human-relevant in vitro pulmonary platforms. Notably, in vitro strategies using foremost lung-on-chips and biocompatible ""soft"" membranes have focused on platforms that emphasize phenotypical endpoints recapitulating key physiological and cellular functions. We review some of the most recent in vitro studies underlining seminal therapeutic screens and translational applications and open our discussion to promising avenues of pulmonary therapeutic exploration focusing on liposomes. Undeniably, there still remains a recognized trade-off between the physiological and biological complexity of these in vitro lung models and their ability to deliver assays with throughput capabilities. The upcoming years are thus anticipated to see further developments in broadening the applicability of such in vitro systems and accelerating therapeutic exploration for drug discovery and translational medicine in treating respiratory disorders.","Artzy-Schnirman, Arbel; Arber Raviv, Sivan; Doppelt Flikshtain, Ofri; Shklover, Jeny; Korin, Netanel; Gross, Adi; Mizrahi, Boaz; Schroeder, Avi; Sznitman, Josué",Adv Drug Deliv Rev,202,9

It is essential to identify those risk factors that lead to a poor prognosis of the disease. A predisposing host genetic background could be one of these factors that explain the interindividual variability to COVID-19 severity. Thus, we have studied whether the rs4341 and rs4343 polymorphisms of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) gene, key regulator of the renin-aldosterone-angiotensin system (RAAS), could explain the different outcomes of 128 COVID-19 patients with diverse degree of severity (33 asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic, 66 hospitalized in the general ward, and 29 admitted to the ICU). We found that G allele of rs4341 and rs4343 was associated with severe COVID-19 in hypertensive patients, independently of gender (p<0.05). G-carrier genotypes of both polymorphisms were also associated with higher mortality (p< 0.05) and higher severity of COVID-19 in dyslipidemic (p<0.05) and type 2 diabetic patients (p< 0.01). The association of G alleles with disease severity was adjusted for age, sex, BMI and number of comorbidities, suggesting that both the metabolic comorbidities and the G allele act synergistically on COVID-19 outcome. Although we did not find a direct association between serum ACE levels and COVID-19 severity, we found higher levels of ACE in the serum of patients with the GG genotype of rs4341 and rs4343 (p<0.05), what could explain the higher susceptibility to develop severe forms of the disease in patients with the GG genotype, in addition to hypertension and dyslipidemia. In conclusion, our preliminary study suggests that the G-containing genotypes of rs4341 and rs4343 confer an additional risk of adverse COVID-19 prognosis. Thus, rs4341 and rs4343 polymorphisms of ACE could be predictive markers of severity of COVID-19 in those patients with hypertension, dyslipidemia or diabetes. The knowledge of these genetic data could contribute to precision management of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients when admitted to hospital.","Íñiguez, María; Pérez-Matute, Patricia; Villoslada-Blanco, Pablo; Recio-Fernandez, Emma; Ezquerro-Pérez, Diana; Alba, Jorge; Ferreira-Laso, M.

Northeastern Oklahoma, home to a number of Native American Tribes, is part of the well‐known Tri‐State Mining District. More than 100 years of mining production in this area has left numerous, large chat piles in the surrounding environment. Despite numerous studies and efforts on the restoration of metal contamination in this area, no studies have attempted to distinguish the contributions of different sources, particularly from the atmospheric deposition, of metals to the aquatic environment. Here, we analyzed the atmospheric deposition of Pb from Picher, a town surrounded by chat piles, and Tulsa, a primary metropolitan area in northeastern Oklahoma, from 2010 to 2016. We found that chat piles in Picher contain ~20% and 6% of fine particles that are subjective to windborne transport and human inhalation, respectively, and these fine particles contain disproportionally high concentrations of Pb. Despite the absence of industrial and human activities, airborne Pb in Picher is 2–5 times higher than that of Tulsa. A conservative estimate showed that airborne Pb may contribute up to 10% of annual Pb mass flux to a lake 18 km away from the chat piles in Picher and probably a much higher contribution for soil and water located adjacent to Picher. Despite known limitations, our study represents the first attempt to evaluate the significance of Pb‐laden airborne particulate matter from a large‐scale abandoned mining area where the humans are particularly vulnerable to metal exposure.","Li, Junran; McDonald‐Gillespie, Julie",Geohealth,202,1

The enveloped, single-stranded RNA virus was first identified in a patient with dry cough, pain, and weakness for the past1 week with unknown etiology in Wuhan. The coronavirus soon spread across the globe in the next few weeks. To curb the spread of coronavirus, stringent measures such as lockdown and social distancing were enforced resulted in a declining of cases in various countries. However, unlocking, relaxation of preventive measures, and changing human behaviors led to a drastic increase in the number of COVID-19 cases resulting in the second wave of transmission. This resulted in reimposing of lockdown measures in countries such as Nepal, Italy, France, Netherland, and Germany. At present, the virus has affected over 110.7 million peoples and over 2.4 million deaths across the world, with India having the second-highest number of COVID-19 cases, following the United States of America. Furthermore, a cross-sectional view of the disease states several new strains being reported across the globe at one end and at another end there is rolling out of vaccine against COVID-19. There is still uncertainty related to curbing of the pandemic as effect of vaccine on new strains is undetermined. Thus, it is important to understand the transforming epidemiology of the virus as it helps in planning necessary steps for physicians and policymakers. The present review summarizes the updated information primarily about the epidemiology of COVID-19, from initiation to the present scenario.","Rastogi, Aayushi; Padhi, Abhishek; Syed, Sabin; Keshan, Pranav; Gupta, Ekta",J Family Med Prim Care,202,1

Although both diseases have a completely different pathogenesis, the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms in systemic inflammation overlap to some extent. Following the recognition that systemic inflammation has an important causative role in cardiovascular disease, anti-inflammatory therapy in both conditions and urate-lowering therapies in gout are expected to lower the cardiovascular burden of patients. Unfortunately, much of the existing data showing that urate-lowering therapy has consistent beneficial effects on cardiovascular outcomes in patients with gout are of low quality and contradictory. We will discuss the latest evidence in this respect. Cardiovascular disease risk management for patients with rheumatoid arthritis and gout is essential.

Smartphone and wearable devices may offer a unique source of data to detect moment by moment changes in risk factors associated with mental disorders that overcome many of the limitations of traditional screening methods. Objective: The current study aimed to explore the extent to which data from smartphone and wearable devices could predict symptoms of depression and anxiety. Methods: A total of N = 60 adults (ages 24–68) who owned an Apple iPhone and Oura Ring were recruited online over a 2-week period. At the beginning of the study, participants installed the Delphi data acquisition app on their smartphone. The app continuously monitored participants' location (using GPS) and smartphone usage behavior (total usage time and frequency of use). The Oura Ring provided measures related to activity (step count and metabolic equivalent for task), sleep (total sleep time, sleep onset latency, wake after sleep onset and time in bed) and heart rate variability (HRV). In addition, participants were prompted to report their daily mood (valence and arousal). Participants completed self-reported assessments of depression, anxiety and stress (DASS-21) at baseline, midpoint and the end of the study. Results: Multilevel models demonstrated a significant negative association between the variability of locations visited and symptoms of depression (beta = −0.21, p = 0.037) and significant positive associations between total sleep time and depression (beta = 0.24, p = 0.023), time in bed and depression (beta = 0.26, p = 0.020), wake after sleep onset and anxiety (beta = 0.23, p = 0.035) and HRV and anxiety (beta = 0.26, p = 0.035). A combined model of smartphone and wearable features and self-reported mood provided the strongest prediction of depression. Conclusion: The current findings demonstrate that wearable devices may provide valuable sources of data in predicting symptoms of depression and anxiety, most notably data related to common measures of sleep.","Moshe, Isaac; Terhorst, Yannik; Opoku Asare, Kennedy; Sander, Lasse Bosse; Ferreira, Denzil; Baumeister, Harald; Mohr, David C.; Pulkki-Råback, Laura",Front Psychiatry,202,6

This case report highlights a rare condition that possibly developed from the novel virus. A 68-year-old Hispanic male with hypertension and gastroesophageal reflux disease, presented with two weeks history of fevers, chills, cough, and progressive shortness of breath. He was found to be positive for the novel SARS-CoV-2 upon admission. He rapidly developed severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) secondary to his coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia requiring intubation and full ventilator support associated with acute anuric renal failure requiring emergent hemodialysis catheter placement and continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT). Two weeks after being on mechanical ventilation and CRRT, he developed episodes of hypotension and tachycardia. A chest radiograph and computed tomography (CT) scan diagnosed pneumopericardium. In the case presented, the patient’s CT of his thorax demonstrated bilateral ground-glass opacities and bilateral reticulations consistent with intraparenchymal injuries, most likely from his ARDS secondary to his initial SARS-CoV-2 infection. To date, there remains an unknown association between COVID-19 and causation of pneumomediastinum and pneumopericardium. There continues to be reports of clinically significant findings of pneumomediastinum and pneumopericardium in COVID-19 patients. It is known that COVID-19 causes dysregulated inflammation leading to diffuse alveolar damage and rupture, as well as myocarditis which may be the precipitant to the development of pneumomediastinum and pneumopericardium. This case highlights the findings of pneumopericardium and pneumomediastinum in the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus. Given the multiple reported cases with similar time frames to the development of spontaneous pneumomediastinum in COVID-19 patients, an association between COVID-19 and spontaneous pneumomediastinum should be further studied.","Li, Shiqian; Chau, Edward; Ghasem, Wesley; Sohn, Jina; Yaghmour, Bassasm",Cureus,202,17

Recent investigations from Sweden and the US have indicated that pregnant and postpartum women are at increased risk of severe complications associated with COVID‐19. This study aims to find out the prevalence of maternal mortality and the clinical course of maternal mortality cases due to COVID-19 pneumonia. METHODOLOGY: A cross-sectional study was conducted from May 1st, 2020, to April 30th, 2021, at Postgraduate Institute and YCM Hospital Pimpri Pune (Maharashtra), a dedicated COVID hospital during COVID pandemic. During study period, all pregnant women who were diagnosed to have COVID-19 infection by RT PCR/Rapid Antigen Test were admitted and were enrolled for the study. AIM: To audit the maternal mortality due to COVID-19 infection. PRIMARY: To estimate the prevalence of maternal mortality due to COVID-19 infection in obstetric patients. SECONDARY: To systematically study and analyze the clinical course of infection in mothers who had mortality due to COVID-19 pneumonia. Data collected in standard format regarding Demography, clinical presentation, need for ICU/HDU, CXR findings, laboratory parameters and cases with maternal mortality were studied in detail to fulfill the study objectives. RESULTS: Among 871 COVID-19 cases diagnosed during pregnancy, nine patients had maternal mortality due to covid pneumonia. There was no obvious obstetric cause for mortality in these cases. The prevalence of maternal mortality was 0.01 (1.03%). Cases with maternal mortality were mostly in 3rd Trimester (5 of 9 cases) and presented with moderate to severe illness with breathlessness and myalgia in all 9 cases, cough and fever in 7 out of 9 cases, Tachypneoa was noted in all patients. Saturation below 90 in 6 cases and below 94 in 3 cases. Chest X-ray showed bilateral lung affection in all 9 cases. Leukocytosis with raised N:L ratio was predominantly seen, thrombocytopenia noted in 5 cases and elevated levels of acute phase reactants and inflammatory markers such as CRP, S. ferritin, ESR, LDH, D-dimer and S. fibrinogen was observed. None of the study participants received vaccine for COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 pneumonia is an additional toll for maternal mortality. Obstetric patients in 2nd and 3rd trimester having COVID-19 infection with late presentation to hospital, moderate to severe disease (RR > 30 min), with raised inflammatory markers (N:L ratio, CRP, Ferritin, d-Dimer, etc.) at presentation, having bilateral lung affection are at risk of poor maternal outcome.","Asalkar, Mahesh; Thakkarwad, Smita; Rumani, Ilaaf; Sharma, Nitika",J Obstet Gynaecol India,202,16

An open issue still to be debated,15.744633,1.9742216,2020-08-21,"BACKGROUND: Bronchiolitis is the commonest lower respiratory tract infection, found worldwide in children < 2 years of age. Over sixty percent of cases are caused by Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV). The disease is known to have significant morbidity, mortality and health care costs. Its seasonal variability, manifestations and complications vary between countries. The aim of this study was to determine the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of infants hospitalized with bronchiolitis in Al Ain City, United Arab Emirates. METHODS: Retrospective observational chart review was made of an unselected cohort of infants ≤ 2 years admitted to the pediatric department of Tawam hospital over a 3-year period and discharged with the diagnosis of bronchiolitis. Epidemiological data and risk factors were analyzed. RESULTS: RSV was the commonest pathogen (51%). Hospitalizations occurred year-round but increased significantly in December and January. The patients’ median age was 5.8 months with a male predominance (male:female ratio of 1.5:1.0). The mean age at admission was 6.6 months and presentation occurred, on average, 2.9 days after the onset of the symptoms. The majority (94%) had respiratory distress on presentation. Chest x-ray was performed in 80% of the patients. Most children received bronchodilator therapy and oxygen therapy was administered to 42%. The mean duration of hospital stay was 3 days. CONCLUSION: Bronchiolitis remains a common reason for hospital admission and carries significant morbidity. RSV is the primarily responsible virus for hospital admissions and morbidity. A better understanding of the burden of bronchiolitis in our setting would enable better planning and use of hospital resources to minimize its short and long-term sequelae.","Al Shibli, Amar; Nouredin, Muhammad B.; Al Amri, Abdulla; Iram, Durdana; Narchi, Hassib",Open Respir Med J,202,16

People with severe mental ill health (SMI, e.g., bipolar or psychosis spectrum disorders) are at greater risk for digital exclusion and it is unknown to what extent they are able to adapt to online service delivery. This study explored use of the Internet and digital devices during the pandemic restrictions and its association with physical and mental health changes. Methods: 367 adults with an SMI diagnosis completed a survey (online or offline) and provided information on access to Internet connection and devices, internet skills, online activities, and barriers to using the Internet. They also self-reported changes in mental and physical health. Results: During the pandemic restrictions 61.6% were limited or non-users of the Internet. The majority had access to the Internet and digital devices but around half reported knowledge deficits. Most common activities were accessing information and entertainment (88.9%), staying in touch with friends and families (84.8%), and purchasing goods (other than food) (84.3%). Most common barriers were finding the Internet 'not interesting' (28.3%) or 'too difficult' (27.9%), as well as 'security concerns' (22.1% to 24.3%). Using the Internet 'a lot' (vs 'just a bit or not at all') during the pandemic was associated with younger age (Adj ORs = 4.76 and 6.39, Ps < .001), having a diagnosis of bipolar disorder (compared to psychosis; Adj OR = 3.88, P < .001), or reporting a decline in mental health (compared to no decline; Adj OR = 1.92, P = .01). Conclusion: Most people with SMI were limited or non-users of the Internet during the pandemic, which seems to be mainly attributable to lack of interest and skills, rather than lack of devices or connectivity. Older adults with psychosis should be the focus of interventions to support digital engagement in people with SMI.","Spanakis, P.; Heron, P.; Walker, L.; Crosland, S.; Wadman, R.; Newbronner, E.; Johnston, G.; Gilbody, S.; Peckham, E.",,202,20

Cognitive therapy for PTSD (CT-PTSD) is a trauma-focused cognitive behavioural therapy that is acceptable to patients, leads to high rates of recovery and is recommended as a first-line treatment for the disorder by international clinical practice guidelines. Here we describe how to deliver CT-PTSD remotely so that patients presenting with PTSD during the COVID-19 pandemic can still benefit from this evidence-based treatment.","Wild, Jennifer; Warnock-Parkes, Emma; Murray, Hannah; Kerr, Alice; Thew, Graham; Grey, Nick; Clark, David M.; Ehlers, Anke",European journal of psychotraumatology,202,24

In our study we determine whether exists differences in cumulative incidence and severity of Covid-19 infection between lung cancer patients visiting our Medical Oncology department and the reference population of our center (320,000 people), in the current epicenter of the pandemic in Europe (Madrid, Spain). We also describe clinical and demographic factors associated with poor prognosis and Covid-19 treatment outcomes. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 1878 medical records of all Covid-19 patients who were admitted at Hospital Universitario Infanta Leonor of Madrid between March 5, 2020 and April 7, 2020, in order to detect cumulative incidence of Covid-19 in lung cancer patients. We also described Covid-19 treatment outcome, mortality and associated risk factors using univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: 17/1878 total diagnosis in our center had lung cancer (0.9%) versus 1878/320,000 of the total reference population (p = 0.09). 9/17 lung cancer patients with Covid-19 diagnosis died (52.3%) versus 192/1878 Covid-19 patients in our center (p<0.0001). Dead lung cancer patients were elderly compared to survivors: 72 versus 64.5 years old (p = 0.12). Combined treatment with hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin improves the outcome of Covid-19 in lung cancer patients, detecting only 1/6 deaths between patients under this treatment versus others treatment, with statistical significance in the univariate and multivariate logistic regression (OR 0.04, p = 0.018). CONCLUSIONS: Lung cancer patients have a higher mortality rate than general population. Combined hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin treatment seems like a good treatment option. It is important to try to minimize visits to hospitals (without removing their active treatments) in order to decrease nosocomial transmission.","Jacobo, Rogado; Pangua, Cristina; Serrano-Montero, Gloria; Obispo, Berta; Marino, Almudena Martín; Pérez-Pérez, Mar; López-Alfonso, Ana; Gullón, Pedro; Lara, Miguel Ángel",Lung Cancer,202,5

There is concern surrounding potential release of patient-derived bioaerosol during nebuliser drug refill, which could impact the health of caregivers. Consequently, mesh nebulisers have been recommended by various clinical practice guidelines. Currently, there is a lack of empirical data describing the potential for release of patient-derived bioaerosol during drug refill. This study examined the release of simulated patient-derived bioaerosol, and the effect on positive end expiratory pressure during nebuliser refill during mechanical ventilation of a simulated patient. During jet nebuliser refill, the positive end expiratory pressure decreased from 4.5 to 0 cm H(2)O. No loss in pressure was noted during vibrating mesh nebuliser refill. A median particle number concentration of 710 particles cm(−3) above ambient was detected when refilling the jet nebuliser in comparison to no increase above ambient detected when using the vibrating mesh nebuliser. The jet nebuliser with the endotracheal tube clamped resulted in 60 particles cm(−3) above ambient levels. This study confirms that choice of nebuliser impacts both the potential for patient-derived bioaerosol release and the ability to maintain ventilator circuit pressures and validates the recommended use of mesh nebulisers during mechanical ventilation.","Joyce, Mary; McGrath, James A.; Mac Giolla Eain, Marc; O’Sullivan, Andrew; Byrne, Miriam; MacLoughlin, Ronan",Pharmaceutics,202,20

One of these variables is fear, present in situations of continuous uncertainty. Fear is a key variable for mental health and tracking it and its correlates might help to develop proper education and prevention programs. Currently, Brazil is one of the epicentres of the COVID-19 pandemic, with its public health system scrapped and not being able to contain the amount of infected people. Therefore, a proper measure to screen the fear of COVID-19 will help to provide improvements in mental health in such contexts. For that, two studies were performed. In Study 1 (N = 230) we assessed the factorial structure of the measure through exploratory factor analysis, and item parameters using item response theory. In Study 2 (N = 302), we assessed whether the structure would replicate in an independent sample and through confirmatory factor analysis, besides assessing convergent validity using Structural Equation Modelling and proposing a shorter version of the measure. Both long and short versions presented a reliable unidimensional structure and similar patterns of correlations with depression, anxiety, and stress. Overall, our results showed that the FCV-19S and its short version are useful measures to the assessment of fear of COVID-19 in Brazil.","de Medeiros, Emerson Diógenes; Reis, Lorena Mota; Guimarães, Clara Lohana Cardoso; da Silva, Paulo Gregório Nascimento; Monteiro, Renan Pereira; Coelho, Gabriel Lins de Holanda; Guimarães, Clarissa Maria Cardoso; Martins, Emanuely Rayane dos Santos; de França, Ludymilla Linéia Almeida",Curr Psychol,202,1

Negative impacts of pandemic measures and economic hardship on psychological well-being are common among the global populations. In Hong Kong, the pandemic not only affects the local populations, but also the migrant Filipina domestic helpers (FDH). Despite the distress, evidence suggests that people still experience positive changes (aka adversarial growth) amid the COVID-19 pandemic. We expect the same applies to FDH in Hong Kong. Studies have shown that coping resources (e.g., resilience, social support, literacy of trauma-related information), cognitive appraisal, and coping strategies are associated with adversarial growth among individuals living with highly stressful events. Relevant studies for migrant populations in the COVID-19 context are limited. This study examined the psychosocial correlates of adversarial growth among FDH in Hong Kong. METHOD: By convenient sampling, FDH (N = 266) recruited from public gathering venues were asked to complete a cross-sectional survey. Their COVID-19-related distress, work-related stress, COVID-19 information literacy, emotional and material support, resilience, cognitive appraisals (harm, threat, challenge), and coping strategies (religious coping, positive reframing, acceptance) were measured. RESULTS: Controlled for covariates, hierarchical regression results showed that higher levels of resilience (ß = .21), emotional support (ß = .16), COVID-19-related information literacy (ß = .15), and religious coping (ß = .16) were associated with higher adversarial growth (ps < .05). CONCLUSIONS: FDH in Hong Kong reported positive changes amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Based on our findings, facilitating those FDH's resilience, emotional support, COVID-19 information literacy, and religious coping might be important strategies to enhance their adversarial growth.

Given the nanomolar high affinity between ACE2 and SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, we investigated how this interaction would affect the enzymatic activity of ACE2. Surprisingly, SARS-CoV-2 trimeric spike protein increased ACE2 proteolytic activity ∼3-10 fold against model peptide substrates, such as caspase-1 substrate and Bradykinin-analog. The enhancement in ACE2 enzymatic function was mediated by the binding of SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD domain.

The ESBL-E.coli rates from clinical samples of patients in primary care and nursing home residents were compared before and after the general lockdown in March 2020, according to demographic and geographical characteristics. Interrupted time series analyses were performed to detect measurable changes in the trend of ESBL-E.coli rates. RESULTS Records covering 793954 E. coli isolates from 1022 clinical laboratories were analyzed. In primary care, 3.1% of E. coli isolates from clinical samples were producing ESBL before March 2020 and 2.9% since May 2020 (p<0.001). The proportion of ESBL-E.coli decreased significantly among urine cultures, females, age categories 5-19, 40-64, >65 year-old, and in the North, West, East and South-East regions.

The aim of the study was to determine whether early individualized titration of PEEP with EIT improved outcomes in patients with ARDS. METHODS: A total of 117 ARDS patients receiving mechanical ventilation were randomly assigned to EIT group (n = 61, PEEP adjusted based on ventilation distribution) or control group (n = 56, low PEEP/FiO(2) table). The primary outcome was 28-day mortality. Secondary and exploratory outcomes were ventilator-free days, length of ICU stay, incidence of pneumothorax and barotrauma, and difference in Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score at day 1 (ΔD1-SOFA) and day 2 (ΔD2-SOFA) compared with baseline. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: There was no statistical difference in the value of PEEP between the EIT group and control group, but the combination of PEEP and FiO(2) was different between groups. In the control group, a significantly positive correlation was found between the PEEP value and the corresponding FiO(2) (r = 0.47, p < 0.00001) since a given matched table was used for PEEP settings. Diverse combinations of PEEP and FiO(2) were found in the EIT group (r = 0.05, p = 0.68). There was no significant difference in mortality rate (21% vs. 27%, EIT vs. control, p = 0.63), ICU length of stay (13.0 (7.0, 25.0) vs 10.0 (7.0, 14.8), median (25th–75th percentile); p = 0.17), and ventilator-free days at day 28 (14.0 (2.0, 23.0) vs 19.0 (0.0, 24.0), p = 0.55) between the two groups. The incidence of new barotrauma was zero. Compared with control group, significantly lower ΔD1-SOFA and ΔD2-SOFA were found in the EIT group (p < 0.001) in a post hoc comparison. Moreover, the EIT group exhibited a significant decrease of SOFA at day 2 compared with baseline (paired t-test, difference by − 1 (− 3.5, 0), p = 0.001). However, the control group did show a similar decrease (difference by 1 (− 2, 2), p = 0.131). CONCLUSION: Our study showed a 6% absolute decrease in mortality in the EIT group: a statistically non-significant, but clinically non-negligible result.

This study was aimed to compare the epidemiological characteristics and outcomes of COVID-19 in diabetic versus non-diabetic individuals. METHODS: In this retrospective observational study, the epidemiological characteristics of the two groups of diabetic (n=1365) and non-diabetic (n=15,026) subjects with definite diagnosis of COVID-19 in the southwestern region of Iran were compared. All clinical signs and comorbidities of the patients were evaluated. Chi-square test was used to examine the differences in qualitative variables between diabetic and non-diabetic groups. RESULTS: Of 16,391 enrolled subjects, 8.3% had diabetes, and 28.3% of COVID-19-related deaths occurred in diabetics. Also, the mortality rate among diabetics was reported as 14.3%. The average age of diabetic patients and non-diabetic patients was 59 and 37 years, respectively. The odds of fever, cough, shortness of breath, headache, and underlying diseases, such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, chronic lung disease, immune deficiency, and hyperlipidemia, were significantly higher in diabetic patients than in non-diabetics. CONCLUSION: Diabetes is associated with increased mortality rate in patients with COVID-19 and is considered as a major risk factor for COVID-19 infection, posing a major public health challenge for health policymakers in managing and controlling the disease. Therefore, development of prevention and treatment strategies aimed at reducing COVID-19 morbidity and mortality in diabetes patients is of significant importance.","Moftakhar, Leila; Moftakhar, Parisa; Piraee, Elahe; Ghaem, Haleh; Valipour, Aliasghar; Azarbakhsh, Habibollah",Int J Diabetes Dev Ctries,202,26

In case of a contagious disease, the virus can survive on any surface over a period of time and can be transferred to the human host through touching those surfaces unknowingly. Cleaning those possible surfaces to which these microorganisms can cling onto is one of the major ways to curb the spread. The aim of this study was to design a sterilizer which can clean such surfaces of daily used items easily within a certain period of time and can assess the cleaning efficacy by estimating the presence of microbes before and after sanitization. METHOD DEVELOPMENT: To achieve this goal, we propose a portable sterilization unit that contains a sterilization chamber fitted with a microbe content detector. The sterilization chamber will cleanse the surfaces off the microbes using ultraviolet radiation. The chamber can be portable and at the same time big enough to accommodate items of daily use, like watch, wallet, clothes, utensils to even foods for single-house application. The microbe content detector will detect the success of the sterilization procedure by examining the time-lapse laser speckle images captured by a high-speed camera by mean of image processing algorithm, such that the user can determine whether further sterilization is required. CONCLUSIONS: Microbe content detection device associated with the conventional sterilization procedure will give an assessment of the effectiveness of the sterilization. Successful implementation of sterilization for a wide variety of items of everyday use aided with microbe content detection technique is first of its kind and should be an effective tool for use in large communities, offices and public places for effective sterilization to help fight against the spread of infectious diseases.","Banerjee, Sreerup; Raghunathan, Shriram; Banerjee, Saubhik; Bandyopadhyay, Boudhayan",Bull Natl Res Cent,202,1

However, the role of other post-translational modifications, such as ADP-ribosylation, in host-virus interactions is less well characterized. ADP-ribosylation is carried out by proteins encoded by the PARP (also called ARTD) gene family. The majority of the 17 human PARP genes are poorly characterized. However, one PARP protein, PARP13/ZAP, has broad antiviral activity and has evolved under positive (diversifying) selection in primates. Such evolution is typical of domains that are locked in antagonistic ‘arms races’ with viral factors. To identify additional PARP genes that may be involved in host-virus interactions, we performed evolutionary analyses on all primate PARP genes to search for signatures of rapid evolution. Contrary to expectations that most PARP genes are involved in ‘housekeeping’ functions, we found that nearly one-third of PARP genes are evolving under strong recurrent positive selection. We identified a >300 amino acid disordered region of PARP4, a component of cytoplasmic vault structures, to be rapidly evolving in several mammalian lineages, suggesting this region serves as an important host-pathogen specificity interface. We also found positive selection of PARP9, 14 and 15, the only three human genes that contain both PARP domains and macrodomains. Macrodomains uniquely recognize, and in some cases can reverse, protein mono-ADP-ribosylation, and we observed strong signatures of recurrent positive selection throughout the macro-PARP macrodomains. Furthermore, PARP14 and PARP15 have undergone repeated rounds of gene birth and loss during vertebrate evolution, consistent with recurrent gene innovation. Together with previous studies that implicated several PARPs in immunity, as well as those that demonstrated a role for virally encoded macrodomains in host immune evasion, our evolutionary analyses suggest that addition, recognition and removal of ADP-ribosylation is a critical, underappreciated currency in host-virus conflicts.","Daugherty, Matthew D.; Young, Janet M.; Kerns, Julie A.; Malik, Harmit S.",PLoS Genet,202,8

However, few robust and comprehensive analyses are available that lay out how US states and regions can most effectively contribute. This paper describes an approach developed for Georgia—a state in the southeastern United States called “Drawdown Georgia”, our research involves (1) understanding Georgia’s baseline carbon footprint and trends, (2) identifying the universe of Georgia-specific carbon-reduction solutions that could be impactful by 2030, (3) estimating the greenhouse gas reduction potential of these high-impact 2030 solutions for Georgia, and (4) estimating associated costs and benefits while also considering how the solutions might impact societal priorities, such as economic development opportunities, public health, environmental benefits, and equity. We began by examining the global solutions identified by Project Drawdown. The resulting 20 high-impact 2030 solutions provide a strategy for reducing Georgia’s carbon footprint in the next decade using market-ready technologies and practices and including negative emission solutions. This paper describes our systematic and replicable process and ends with a discussion of its strengths, weaknesses, and planned future research.","Brown, Marilyn A.; Beasley, Blair; Atalay, Fikret; Cobb, Kim M.; Dwiveldi, Puneet; Hubbs, Jeffrey; Iwaniek, David M.; Mani, Sudhagar; Matisoff, Daniel; Mohan, Jaqueline E.; Mullen, Jeffrey; Oxman, Michael; Rochberg, Daniel; Rodgers, Michael; Shepherd, Marshall; Simmons, Richard; Taylor, Laura; Toktay, L.

About 10 min after synthesis of the E1 protein, N-acetyl-galactosamine was added. This was followed approximately 10 min later by the addition of both galactose and sialic acid to give the mature oligosaccharides. This sequence of additions was confirmed by analyzing the 3H-labeled oligosaccharides bound to each of the E1 forms using gel filtration on P4 columns. The intracellular location of the first step was determined by exploiting the temperature sensitivity of virus release. The virus normally buds first into a smooth membrane compartment lying between the rough endoplasmic reticulum and the cis side of the Golgi stack (Tooze et al., 1984). At 31 degrees C the virus is assembled but does not appear to enter the Golgi stacks. The addition of N-acetyl- galactosamine is unaffected although the addition of galactose and sialic acid is inhibited. These results strongly suggest that addition of N-acetyl-galactosamine occurs in this budding compartment, the morphology of which is similar to that of transitional elements and vesicles.",,J Cell Biol,202,13

The spike (S) glycoprotein is an important determinant for PEDV biological properties. To determine the distribution profile of PEDV outbreak strains, we sequenced the full-length S gene of five samples from two farms where animals exhibited severe diarrhea and high mortality rates. Five new PEDV variants were identified, and the molecular diversity, phylogenetic relationships, and antigenicity analysis of Gansu field samples with other PEDV reference strains were investigated. A series of insertions, deletions, and mutations in the S gene was found in five PEDV variants compared with classical and vaccine strains. These mutations may provide stronger pathogenicity and antigenicity to the new PEDV variants that influenced the effectiveness of the CV777-based vaccine. Our results suggest that these new PEDV variant strains in Gansu Province might be from South Korean or South China, and the effectiveness of the CV777-based vaccine needs to be evaluated.","Tian, Yufei; Yu, Zhijun; Cheng, Kaihui; Liu, Yuxiu; Huang, Jing; Xin, Yue; Li, Yuanguo; Fan, Shengtao; Wang, Tiecheng; Huang, Geng; Feng, Na; Yang, Zhenguo; Yang, Songtao; Gao, Yuwei; Xia, Xianzhu",Viruses,202,32

As the environment dictates the success or failure of remyelination, it is critical to understand the role that the immune system plays in transplant-mediated remyelination. In this study, we evaluated the severity of neuroinflammation following transplantation of glial-committed progenitor cells into the spinal cords of mice chronically infected with mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), a model in which T cells and macrophages are critical in amplifying the severity of demyelination. Transplantation was performed following viral persistence in which inflammation and demyelination are established and clinical disease is evident. Mice were sacrificed 10 and 21 days following progenitor cell transplantation and the effect on neuroinflammation evaluated. Treatment did not alter accumulation of T cells or macrophages within the CNS as compared to control mice. Moreover, progenitor cell implantation did not affect local cytokine/chemokine gene expression in the CNS. Finally, remyelination associated with transplantation did not result in an imbalance of T(H)1-associated cytokine production by virus-specific T cells. These studies demonstrate that progenitor cell-mediated remyelination is not the result of modulating the composition of the cellular infiltrate nor cytokine expression by virus-specific T cells and suggest that remyelination may not depend on amelioration of the inflammatory response or alteration of cytokine secretion by virus-specific T cells.","Hardison, Jenny L.; Nistor, Gabriel; Gonzalez, Rafael; Keirstead, Hans S.; Lane, Thomas E.",Exp Neurol,202,33

Kenya has been at the forefront of embracing a collaborative approach in Africa with the inception of the Zoonotic Disease Unit in 2011. Joint outbreak responses have been coordinated at the national level, yet little is currently documented on cross-sectoral collaboration at the sub-national level. Methods: Key informant interviews were conducted with 28 disease surveillance officers from the human and animal health sectors in three counties in western Kenya. An inductive process of thematic analysis was used to identify themes relating to barriers and drivers for cross-sectoral collaboration. Results: The study identified four interlinking themes related to drivers and barriers for cross-sectoral collaboration. To drive collaboration at the sub-national level there needs to be a clear identification of “common objectives,” as currently exemplified by the response to suspected rabies and anthrax cases and routine meat hygiene activities. The action of collaboration, be it integrated responses to outbreaks or communication and data sharing, require “operational structures” to facilitate them, including the formalisation of reporting lines, supporting legislation and the physical infrastructure, from lab equipment to mobile phones, to facilitate the activities. These structures in turn require “appropriate resources” to support them, which will be allocated based on the “political will” of those who control the resources. Conclusions: Ongoing collaborations between human and animal disease surveillance officers at the sub-national level were identified, driven by common objectives such as routine meat hygiene and response to suspected rabies and anthrax cases. In these areas a suitable operational structure is present, including a supportive legislative framework and clearly designated roles for officers within both sectors. There was support from disease surveillance officers to increase their collaboration, communication and data sharing across sectors, yet this is currently hindered by the lack of these formal operational structures and poor allocation of resources to disease surveillance. It was acknowledged that improving this resource allocation will require political will at the sub-national, national and international levels.","Thomas, Lian Francesca; Rushton, Jonathan; Bukachi, Salome A.; Falzon, Laura C.; Howland, Olivia; Fèvre, Eric M.",Front Vet Sci,202,1
