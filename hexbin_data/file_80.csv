126,126,126,Surfactant therapy for acute respiratory failure in children: a systematic review and meta-analysis,18.216906,10.673712,2007-06-15,"INTRODUCTION: Exogenous surfactant is used to treat acute respiratory failure in children, although the benefits and harms in this setting are not clear. The objective of the present systematic review is to assess the effect of exogenous pulmonary surfactant on all-cause mortality in children mechanically ventilated for acute respiratory failure. METHODS: We searched the MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and Ovid Healthstar databases, the bibliographies of included trials and review articles, conference proceedings and trial registries. We included prospective, randomized, controlled trials of pulmonary surfactant that enrolled intubated and mechanically ventilated children with acute respiratory failure. We excluded trials that exclusively enrolled neonates or patients with asthma. Two reviewers independently rated trials for inclusion, extracted data and assessed the methodologic quality. We quantitatively pooled the results of trials, where suitable, using a random effects model. RESULTS: Six trials randomizing 314 patients were included. Surfactant use reduced mortality (relative risk = 0.7, 95% confidence interval = 0.4 to 0.97, P = 0.04), was associated with increased ventilator-free days (weighted mean difference = 2.5 days, 95% confidence interval = 0.3 to 4.6 days, P = 0.02) and reduced the duration of ventilation (weighted mean difference = 2.3 days, 95% confidence interval = 0.1 to 4.4 days, P = 0.04). CONCLUSION: Surfactant use decreased mortality, was associated with more ventilator-free days and reduced the duration of ventilation. No serious adverse events were reported.","Duffett, Mark; Choong, Karen; Ng, Vivian; Randolph, Adrienne; Cook, Deborah J",Crit Care,80,27
1459,1459,1459,Usefulness of Cellular Analysis of Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid for Predicting the Etiology of Pneumonia in Critically Ill Patients,18.093418,10.56844,2014-05-13,"BACKGROUND: The usefulness of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid cellular analysis in pneumonia has not been adequately evaluated. This study investigated the ability of cellular analysis of BAL fluid to differentially diagnose bacterial pneumonia from viral pneumonia in adult patients who are admitted to intensive care unit. METHODS: BAL fluid cellular analysis was evaluated in 47 adult patients who underwent bronchoscopic BAL following less than 24 hours of antimicrobial agent exposure. The abilities of BAL fluid total white blood cell (WBC) counts and differential cell counts to differentiate between bacterial and viral pneumonia were evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. RESULTS: Bacterial pneumonia (n = 24) and viral pneumonia (n = 23) were frequently associated with neutrophilic pleocytosis in BAL fluid. BAL fluid median total WBC count (2,815/µL vs. 300/µL, P<0.001) and percentage of neutrophils (80.5% vs. 54.0%, P = 0.02) were significantly higher in the bacterial pneumonia group than in the viral pneumonia group. In ROC curve analysis, BAL fluid total WBC count showed the best discrimination, with an area under the curve of 0.855 (95% CI, 0.750–0.960). BAL fluid total WBC count ≥510/µL had a sensitivity of 83.3%, specificity of 78.3%, positive likelihood ratio (PLR) of 3.83, and negative likelihood ratio (NLR) of 0.21. When analyzed in combination with serum procalcitonin or C-reactive protein, sensitivity was 95.8%, specificity was 95.7%, PLR was 8.63, and NLR was 0.07. BAL fluid total WBC count ≥510/µL was an independent predictor of bacterial pneumonia with an adjusted odds ratio of 13.5 in multiple logistic regression analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Cellular analysis of BAL fluid can aid early differential diagnosis of bacterial pneumonia from viral pneumonia in critically ill patients.","Choi, Sang-Ho; Hong, Sang-Bum; Hong, Hyo-Lim; Kim, Sung-Han; Huh, Jin Won; Sung, Heungsup; Lee, Sang-Oh; Kim, Mi-Na; Jeong, Jin-Yong; Lim, Chae-Man; Kim, Yang Soo; Woo, Jun Hee; Koh, Younsuck",PLoS One,80,1
1496,1496,1496,Circulating Levels of Tumor Necrosis Factor-Alpha Receptor 2 Are Increased in Heart Failure with Preserved Ejection Fraction Relative to Heart Failure with Reduced Ejection Fraction: Evidence for a Divergence in Pathophysiology,17.865458,10.54358,2014-06-12,"BACKGROUND: Various pathways have been implicated in the pathogenesis of heart failure (HF) with preserved ejection fraction (HFPEF). Inflammation in response to comorbid conditions, such as hypertension and diabetes, may play a proportionally larger role in HFPEF as compared to HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFREF). METHODS AND RESULTS: This study investigated inflammation mediated by the tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFα) axis in community-based cohorts of HFPEF patients (n = 100), HFREF patients (n = 100) and healthy controls (n = 50). Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays were used to investigate levels of TNFα, its two receptors (TNFR1 and TNFR2), and a non-TNFα cytokine, interleukin-6 (IL-6), in plasma derived from peripheral blood samples. Plasma levels of TNFα and TNFR1 were significantly elevated in HFPEF relative to controls, while levels of TNFR2 were significantly higher in HFPEF than both controls and HFREF. TNFα, TNFR1 and TNFR2 were each significantly associated with at least two of the following: age, estimated glomerular filtration rate, hypertension, diabetes, smoking, peripheral vascular disease or history of atrial fibrillation. TNFR2 levels were also significantly associated with increasing grade of diastolic dysfunction and severity of symptoms in HFPEF. CONCLUSIONS: Inflammation mediated through TNFα and its receptors, TNFR1 and TNFR2, may represent an important component of a comorbidity-induced inflammatory response that partially drives the pathophysiology of HFPEF.","Putko, Brendan N.; Wang, Zuocheng; Lo, Jennifer; Anderson, Todd; Becher, Harald; Dyck, Jason R.

1497,1497,1497,Sustained high serum malondialdehyde levels are associated with severity and mortality in septic patients,18.181767,10.536405,2013-12-11,"INTRODUCTION: There is a hyperoxidative state in sepsis. The objective of this study was to determine serum malondialdehyde (MDA) levels during the first week of follow up, whether such levels are associated with severity during the first week and whether non-surviving patients showed higher MDA levels than survivors during the first week. METHODS: We performed an observational, prospective, multicenter study in six Spanish Intensive Care Units. Serum levels of MDA were measured in 328 patients (215 survivors and 113 non-survivors) with severe sepsis at days one, four and eight of diagnosis, and in 100 healthy controls. The primary endpoint was 30-day mortality and the secondary endpoint was six -month mortality. The association between continuous variables was carried out using Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient. Cox regression analysis was applied to determine the independent contribution of serum MDA levels on the prediction of 30-day and 6-month mortality. Hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated as measures of the clinical impact of the predictor variables. RESULTS: We found higher serum MDA in septic patients at day one (p < 0.001), day four (p < 0.001) and day eight (p < 0.001) of diagnosis than in healthy controls. Serum MDA was lower in surviving than non-surviving septic patients at day one (p < 0.001), day four (p < 0.001) and day eight (p < 0.001). Serum MDA levels were positively correlated with lactic acid and SOFA during the first week. Finally, serum MDA levels were associated with 30-day mortality (HR = 1.05; 95% CI = 1.02-1.09; p = 0.005) and six-month mortality (hazard ratio (HR) = 1.05; 95% CI = 1.02-1.09; p = 0.003) after controlling for lactic acid levels, acute physiology and chronic health evaluation (APACHE)-II, diabetes mellitus, bloodstream infection and chronic renal failure. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the largest series providing data on the oxidative state in septic patients to date. The novel finding is that high serum MDA levels sustained throughout the first week of follow up were associated with severity and mortality in septic patients.","Lorente, Leonardo; Martín, María M; Abreu-González, Pedro; Domínguez-Rodriguez, Alberto; Labarta, Lorenzo; Díaz, César; Solé-Violán, Jordi; Ferreres, José; Cabrera, Judith; Igeño, Jose Carlos; Jiménez, Alejandro",Crit Care,80,12
1731,1731,1731,Do corticosteroids reduce the mortality of influenza A (H1N1) infection? A meta-analysis,18.060762,10.582853,2015-02-20,"INTRODUCTION: Corticosteroids are used empirically in influenza A (H1N1) treatment despite lack of clear evidence for effective treatment. This study aims to assess the efficacy of corticosteroids treatment for H1N1 infection. METHODS: Systematic review and meta-analysis were used to estimate the efficacy of corticosteroids for the prevention of mortality in H1N1 infection. Databases searched included MEDLINE, EMBASE, PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Clinical Trials and so on, and bibliographies of retrieved articles, from April 2009 to October 2014. We included both cohort studies and case-control studies reported in English or Chinese that compared treatment effects between corticosteroids and non-corticosteroids therapy in inpatients with H1N1 virus infection. Cohort studies employed mortality as outcome, and case-control studies employed deaths as cases and survivors as controls; both were assessed in this meta-analysis. RESULTS: In total twenty-three eligible studies were included. Both cohort studies (nine studies, n = 1,405) and case-control studies (14 studies, n = 4,700) showed a similar trend toward increased mortality (cohort studies relative risk was 1.85 with 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.46 to 2.33; case-control studies odds ratio was 4.22 with 95% CI 3.10 to 5.76). The results from both subgroup analyses and sensitive analyses were consistent with each other, showing that steroid treatment is associated with mortality. However, considering the fact that corticosteroids were tend to be used in sickest case-patients and heterogeneity was observed between studies, we cannot make a solid conclusion. CONCLUSIONS: Available evidence did not support the use of corticosteroids as standard care for patients with severe influenza. We conclude that further research is required.

4297,4297,4297,Impact of acyclovir use on survival of patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia and high load herpes simplex virus replication,18.001667,10.778477,2020-01-10,"BACKGROUND: Herpes simplex virus (HSV) replication can be detected in the respiratory secretions of a high proportion of ventilated intensive care unit (ICU) patients. However, the clinical significance remains poorly defined. We investigated whether patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia not responding to antibiotics and in whom high levels of HSV could be detected in respiratory secretions benefit from acyclovir treatment. METHODS: Respiratory secretions (bronchoalveolar lavage fluid or tracheal aspirates) were tested for HSV replication by quantitative real-time PCR. ICU survival times, clinical parameters, and radiographic findings were retrospectively compared between untreated and acyclovir treated patients with high (> 10(5) HSV copies/mL) and low (10(3)–10(5) HSV copies/mL) viral load. RESULTS: Fifty-seven low and 69 high viral load patients were identified. Fewer patients with high viral load responded to antibiotic treatment (12% compared to 40% of low load patients, p = 0.001). Acyclovir improved median ICU survival (8 vs 22 days, p = 0.014) and was associated with a significantly reduced hazard ratio for ICU death (HR = 0.31, 95% CI 0.11–0.92, p = 0.035) in high load patients only. Moreover, circulatory and pulmonary oxygenation function of high load patients improved significantly over the course of acyclovir treatment: mean norepinephrine doses decreased from 0.05 to 0.02 μg/kg body weight/min between days 0 and 6 of treatment (p = 0.049), and median PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio increased from 187 to 241 between day 3 and day 7 of treatment (p = 0.02). Chest radiographic findings also improved significantly (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: In patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia, antibiotic treatment failure, and high levels of HSV replication, acyclovir treatment was associated with a significantly longer time to death in the ICU and improved circulatory and pulmonary function. This suggests a causative role for HSV in this highly selected group of patients.","Schuierer, Lukas; Gebhard, Michael; Ruf, Hans-Georg; Jaschinski, Ulrich; Berghaus, Thomas M.; Wittmann, Michael; Braun, Georg; Busch, Dirk H.; Hoffmann, Reinhard",Crit Care,80,12
4316,4316,4316,New-onset atrial fibrillation and associated outcomes and resource use among critically ill adults—a multicenter retrospective cohort study,18.228575,10.646144,2020-01-13,"BACKGROUND: New-onset atrial fibrillation (NOAF) is commonly encountered in critically ill adults. Evidence evaluating the association between NOAF and patient-important outcomes in this population is conflicting. Furthermore, little is known regarding the association between NOAF and resource use or hospital costs. METHODS: Retrospective analysis (2011–2016) of a prospectively collected registry from two Canadian hospitals of consecutive ICU patients aged ≥ 18 years. We excluded patients with a known history of AF prior to hospital admission. Any occurrence of atrial fibrillation (AF) was prospectively recorded by bedside nurses. The primary outcome was hospital mortality, and we used multivariable logistic regression to adjust for confounders. We used a generalized linear model to evaluate contributors to total cost. RESULTS: We included 15,014 patients, and 1541 (10.3%) had NOAF during their ICU admission. While NOAF was not associated with increased odds of hospital death among the entire cohort (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.02 [95% confidence interval [CI] 0.97–1.08]), an interaction was noted between NOAF and sepsis, and the presence of both was associated with higher odds of hospital mortality (aOR 1.28 [95% CI 1.09–1.36]) than either alone. Patients with NOAF had higher total costs (cost ratio [CR] 1.09 [95% CI 1.02–1.20]). Among patients with NOAF, treatment with a rhythm-control strategy was associated with higher costs (CR 1.24 [95% CI 1.07–1.40]). CONCLUSIONS: While NOAF was not associated with death or requiring discharge to long-term care among critically ill patients, it was associated with increased length of stay in ICU and increased total costs.","Fernando, Shannon M.; Mathew, Rebecca; Hibbert, Benjamin; Rochwerg, Bram; Munshi, Laveena; Walkey, Allan J.; Møller, Morten Hylander; Simard, Trevor; Di Santo, Pietro; Ramirez, F.

4375,4375,4375,Pre-extubation functional residual capacity and risk of extubation failure among patients with hypoxemic respiratory failure,17.95555,10.442598,2020-01-22,"Hypoxemic respiratory failure is usually accompanied with a certain extent of consolidation and alveolar derecruitment, which may still be present even after the patients have achieved the status of readiness to extubate. Functional residual capacity (FRC) is an indicator of lung aeration. This study aimed to evaluate whether pre-extubation FRC is associated with the risk of extubation failure in patients with hypoxemic respiratory failure. We prospectively included 92 patients intubated for hypoxemic respiratory failure. We used a technique based on a nitrogen multiple breath washout method to measure FRC before the planned extubation. The median FRC before extubation was 25 mL/kg (Interquartile range, 20–32 mL/Kg) per predicted body weight (pBW). After extubation, 20 patients (21.7%) were reintubated within 48 hours. The median FRC was higher in the extubation success group than in the extubation failure group (27 versus 21 mL/Kg, p < 0.001). Reduced FRC was associated with higher risk of extubation failure (odds ratio, 1.14 per each decreased of 1 mL/Kg of FRC/pBW, 95% CI, 1.05–1.23, p = 0.002). In conclusion, pre-extubation FRC is associated with the risk of extubation failure. Reduced FRC may be incorporated into the traditional risk factors to identify patients at high risk for extubation failure.","Chen, Hui-Chuan; Ruan, Sheng-Yuan; Huang, Chun-Ta; Huang, Pei-Yu; Chien, Jung-Yien; Kuo, Lu-Cheng; Kuo, Ping-Hung; Wu, Huey-Dong",Sci Rep,80,1

Epidemiological studies have shown that the two hMPV genotypes alternate in predominance worldwide in recent years. Co-circulation of the two genotypes of hMPV was usually observed and there is no study about the interaction between them, such as competitive replication, which maybe the possible mechanisms for alternating prevalence of subtypes. Our present study have used two different genotypes of hMPV (genotype A: NL/1/00; B: NL/1/99) in different proportions in animal model (BALB/c mice) and cell model (Vero-E6) separately. The result showed that the competitive growth does exist in BALB/c mice, genotype B had a strong competitive advantage. However, genotype B did not cause more severe disease than non-predominant (genotype A) or mixed strains in the study, which were evaluated by the body weight, airway hyperresponsiveness and lung pathology of mouse. In cell model, competitive growth and the two genotypes alternately prevalence were observed. In summary, we confirmed that there was a competitive replication between hMPV genotype A and B, and no difference in disease severity caused by the two subtypes. This study shows a new insight to understand the alternation of hMPV genotype prevalence through genotype competition and provide experimental evidence for disease control and vaccine design.","Zhou, Zhen; Zhang, Pan; Cui, Yuxia; Zhang, Yongbo; Qin, Xian; Li, Rongpei; Liu, Ping; Dou, Ying; Wang, Lijia; Zhao, Yao",Sci Rep,80,28

They spent 9.7% of time in close contact, and each student averagely had 4.0 close contacts/h. Students spent long time on close contact in the office which may lead to high infection risk. The average interpersonal distance during close contact was 0.81 m. When sitting, students preferred small relative face orientation angle. Pairs of standing students preferred a face-to-face orientation during close contact which means this pattern had a lower infection risk via close contact. Probability of close contact decreased exponentially with the increasing distance between two students’ cubicles. Data on human behaviour during close contact is helpful for infection risk analysis and infection control and prevention.","Zhang, Nan; Su, Boni; Chan, Pak-To; Miao, Te; Wang, Peihua; Li, Yuguo",Int J Environ Res Public Health,80,1

Yet, many test exhibit undesirable performance or are completely lacking. Given this, we developed serum epitope repertoire analysis (SERA), a method to rapidly discover conserved, pathogen-specific antigens and their epitopes, and applied it to develop an assay for Chagas disease caused by the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi. Antibody binding peptide motifs were identified from 28 Chagas repertoires using a bacterial display random 12-mer peptide library and next-generation sequencing (NGS). Thirty-three motifs were selected and mapped to candidate Chagas antigens. In a blinded validation set (n = 72), 30/30 Chagas were positive, 30/30 non-Chagas were negative, and 1/12 Leishmania sp. was positive. After unblinding, a Leishmania cross-reactive epitope was identified and removed from the panel. The Chagas assay exhibited 100% sensitivity (30/30) and specificity (90/90) in a second blinded validation set including individuals with other parasitic infections. Amongst additional epitope repertoires with unknown Chagas serostatus, assay specificity was 99.8% (998/1000). Thus, the Chagas assay achieved a combined sensitivity and specificity equivalent or superior to diagnostic algorithms that rely on three separate tests to achieve high specificity. NGS-based serology via SERA provides an effective approach to discover antigenic epitopes and develop high performance multiplex serological assays.","Kamath, Kathy; Reifert, Jack; Johnston, Timothy; Gable, Cameron; Pantazes, Robert J.; Rivera, Hilda N.; McAuliffe, Isabel; Handali, Sukwan; Daugherty, Patrick S.",Sci Rep,80,12

The purpose of this study was to compare short-term satisfaction with care and decision making in patients or surrogates between two neurocritical care units [one staffed by a neurocritical care attending and advanced practice providers (APPs) and one staffed by a neurocritical care attending and resident/fellow trainees] using the Family Satisfaction in the ICU (FS-ICU) survey. METHODS: Over a 6-month period, the FS-ICU was administered on a tablet device to patients or surrogates at least 24 h after admission and stored on REDCap database. RESULTS: One hundred and thirty-four patients or surrogates completed the FS-ICU. The response rates were 59.97% and 46.58% in the APP and trainee units, respectively. There were no differences in patient age, sex, ventilator days or ICU length of stay. Overall, there were no differences in satisfaction with care or perceived shared medical making between the units. Respondents who identified their relationship with the patient as “other” (not a spouse, parent, nor a sibling) were less satisfied with care. Additionally, surrogates who identified as parents of the patient were more satisfied with degree of shared medical decision making. CONCLUSION: This study showed that: (1) collecting FS-ICU in a neurocritical care unit is feasible, (2) overall there is no difference in short-term satisfaction with care or shared decision making between a NICU staffed with trainees compared to one staffed with APPs, and (3) parents of patients have a higher short-term satisfaction with degree of shared medical decision making.","Newey, Christopher R.; George, Pravin; Honomichl, Ryan; Gomes, Joao; Maraj, Anita; Kinzy, Tyler; Conley, Sarah; Douglas, Bradley; Stoltz, Michael; Hang, David; Omer, Tarig; Abubakr, Samer; Lynch, Gwen; Dani, Dhimant; Katzan, Irene",Neurocrit Care,80,1

The obesity paradox has been demonstrated in many disease states but has yet to be studied in trauma. The objective of this study is to elucidate the presence of the obesity paradox in trauma patients by evaluating the association between BMI and outcomes. METHODS: Using the 2014–2015 National Trauma Database (NTDB), adults were categorized by WHO BMI category. Logistic regression was used to assess the odds of mortality associated with each category, adjusting for statistically significant covariables. Length of stay (LOS), ICU LOS and ventilator days were also analyzed, adjusting for statistically significant covariables. RESULTS: A total of 415,807 patients were identified. Underweight patients had increased odds of mortality (OR 1.378, p < 0.001 95% CI 1.252–1.514), while being overweight had a protective effect (OR 0.916, p = 0.002 95% CI 0.867–0.968). Class I obesity was not associated with increased mortality compared to normal weight (OR 1.013, p = 0.707 95% CI 0.946–1.085). Class II and Class III obesity were associated with increased mortality risk (Class II OR 1.178, p = 0.001 95% CI 1.069–1.299; Class III OR 1.515, p < 0.001 95% CI 1.368–1.677). Hospital and ICU LOS increased with each successive increase in BMI category above normal weight. Obesity was associated with increased ventilator days; Class I obese patients had a 22% increase in ventilator days (IRR 1.217 95% CI 1.171–1.263), and Class III obese patients had a 54% increase (IRR 1.536 95% CI 1.450–1.627).

Therefore, this study analyzed factors associated with compassion satisfaction among the IPV/SA workforce in one southwestern U.S. state (n = 623). Drawing from the Resilience Portfolio Model (Grych et al. 2015), researchers examined the possible role of coping behaviors in mediating associations between compassion satisfaction and workplace resources / assets, perceived job security, and resilience. Analyses revealed partial mediation in the models that included workload, values, and resilience as independent variables, suggesting that these factors both influence workers’ coping behaviors and have an independent association with compassion satisfaction. Models investigating control, rewards, community, fairness, and perceived job security indicated significant total effects of the independent variables on compassion satisfaction. Overall, IPV/SA workers who engaged more frequently in a range of coping behaviors reported higher levels of compassion satisfaction. The findings point to implications for organizational and employee practice, including building in worktime for key individual coping behaviors, balancing workloads among staff members, and enhancing organizational level coping strategies, such as team supervision and team care planning.","Wachter, Karin; Schrag, Rachel Voth; Wood, Leila",J Fam Violence,80,12

For example, in HIV vaccine development, immune response profiles induced by vaccination are key for selecting vaccine regimens to advance to efficacy evaluation. Motivated by the need to rank and choose a few vaccine regimens based on their immunogenicity in phase I trials, Huang et al. (Biostatistics 18(2):230–243, 2017) proposed a ranking/filtering/selection algorithm that down-selects vaccine regimens to satisfy the superiority and non-redundancy criteria, based on multiple immune response endpoints. In practice, many candidate immune response endpoints can be correlated with each other. An important question that remains to be addressed is how to choose a parsimonious set of the available immune response endpoints to effectively compare regimens. In this paper, we propose novel algorithms for selecting immune response endpoints to be used in regimen down-selection, based on importance weights assigned to individual endpoints and their correlation structure. We show through extensive simulation studies that pre-selection of endpoints can substantially improve performance of the subsequent regimen down-selection process. The application of the proposed method is demonstrated using a real example in HIV vaccine research, although the methods are also applicable in general to clinical research for dimension reduction when comparing regimens based on multiple candidate endpoints.

However, fast genome variation timely results in the insurgence of high pathogenic strains, which when infecting poultry birds may cause a million deaths and strong commercial damage. More importantly, the host shift may concern these viruses and sustained human-to-human transmission may result in a dangerous pandemic outbreak. Therefore, fingerprints specific to either low or high pathogenic strains may represent a very important tool for global surveillance. RESULTS: We combined Normal Modes Analysis and surface electrostatic analysis of a mixed strain dataset of influenza A virus haemagglutinins from high and low pathogenic strains in order to infer specific fingerprints. Normal Modes Analysis sorted the strains in two different, homogeneous clusters; sorting was independent of clades and specific instead to high vs low pathogenicity. A deeper analysis of fluctuations and flexibility regions unveiled a special role for the 110-helix region. Specific sorting was confirmed by surface electrostatics analysis, which further allowed to focus on regions and mechanisms possibly crucial to the low-to-high transition. CONCLUSIONS: Evidence from previous work demonstrated that changes in surface electrostatics are associated with the evolution and spreading of avian influenza A virus clades, and seemingly involved also in the avian to mammalian host shift. This work shows that a combination of electrostatics and Normal Modes Analysis can also identify fingerprints specific to high and low pathogenicity. The possibility to predict which specific mutations may result in a shift to high pathogenicity may help in surveillance and vaccine development.","Righetto, Irene; Filippini, Francesco",BMC Bioinformatics,80,1

An important consideration for the clinical application of metabolomics are the different anticoagulants utilized for sample collection. Most studies that have characterized differences in metabolite levels in various blood collection tubes have focused on single analytes. We define analyte levels on a global metabolomics platform following blood sampling using five different, but commonly used, clinical laboratory blood collection tubes (i.e., plasma anticoagulated with either EDTA, lithium heparin or sodium citrate, along with no additive (serum), and EDTA anticoagulated whole blood). METHODS: Using an untargeted metabolomics platform we analyzed five sample types after all had been collected and stored at -80°C. The biochemical composition was determined and differences between the samples established using matched-pair t-tests. RESULTS: We identified 1,117 biochemicals across all samples and detected a mean of 1,036 in the sample groups. Compared to the levels of metabolites in EDTA plasma, the number of biochemicals present at statistically significant different levels (p<0.05) ranged from 452 (serum) to 917 (whole blood). Several metabolites linked to screening assays for rare diseases including acylcarnitines, bilirubin and heme metabolites, nucleosides, and redox balance metabolites varied significantly across the sample collection types. CONCLUSIONS: Our study highlights the widespread effects and importance of using consistent additives for assessing small molecule levels in clinical metabolomics. The biochemistry that occurs during the blood collection process creates a reproducible signal that can identify specimens collected with different anticoagulants in metabolomic studies. IMPACT STATEMENT: In this manuscript, normal/healthy donors had peripheral blood collected using multiple anticoagulants as well as serum during a fasted blood draw. Global metabolomics is a new technology being utilized to draw clinical conclusions and we interrogated the effects of different anticoagulants on the levels of biochemicals from each of the donors. Characterizing the effects of the anticoagulants on biochemical levels will help researchers leverage the information using global metabolomics in order to make conclusions regarding important disease biomarkers.","Kennedy, Adam D.; Ford, Lisa; Wittmann, Bryan; Conner, Jesse; Wulff, Jacob; Mitchell, Matthew; Evans, Anne M.; Toal, Douglas R.",PLoS One,80,33

The aim of this study was to evaluate whether direct discharge (DD) from the emergency department (ED) of SSIs is non-inferior to ‘traditional care’ regarding treatment satisfaction and functional outcome, and to compare other patient-reported outcomes (PROMs), patient-reported experiences (PREMs), resource utilization, and adverse outcomes before and after DD. METHODS: This trial compared outcomes for 11 SSIs 6 months before and after the implementation of DD protocols. Pre-DD, patients were treated according to local protocols. Post-DD, patients were discharged directly using removable orthoses, discharge leaflets, smartphone application, and telephone helpline. Participants received a 3-month postinjury PROM/PREM survey to assess treatment satisfaction (Visual Analog Scale, VAS), pain (VAS), functional outcome (four validated questionnaires), and health-related quality of life (HR-QoL; EuroQol-5D). Resource utilization included general practitioner (GP) visit (yes/no), physiotherapist visit (yes/no), return to work/school/sports (days), work/school absenteeism to visit hospital (yes/no), number of hospital visits, and follow-up X-rays. Other outcomes included missed injuries (additionally to SSI) and adverse outcomes (delayed union, non-union). Between-group differences were assessed using propensity score-adjusted regression analyses. Non-inferiority was assessed for satisfaction and functional outcome using predefined margins. RESULTS: 348 (pre-DD) and 371 (post-DD) patients participated; 144 (41.4%) and 153 (41.2%) patients completed the survey. Satisfaction and functional outcome post-DD were non-inferior to traditional care. Mean satisfaction was 8.13 pre-DD and 7.95 post-DD (mean difference: −0.16, p=0.408). Pain, HR-QoL, GP/physiotherapist visits, and return to work/school/sports were comparable before and after DD. Work absenteeism was higher pre-DD (OR 0.110, p<0.001), as well as school absenteeism (OR 0.084, p<0.001). Post-DD, the mean number of hospital visits and X-rays reduced: −1.68 (p<0.001) and −0.26 (p<0.001). Missed injuries occurred once pre-DD versus twice post-DD. There were no adverse outcomes. DISCUSSION: The results of this study confirm several SSIs can be discharged directly from the ED without compromising patient outcome/experience. Future injury-specific trials are needed to conclusively assess non-inferiority of DD.

Based on a current review of the scientific literature and interviews with people at risk of orthorexia, 40 items were selected to test orthorexia nervosa (TON-40). A total sample of 767 individuals (M = 26.49, SD = 9.66, 56.98% women) participated in the study. The exploratory factor analysis (EFA), confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), and composite construct analysis (CCA) were performed to find an appropriate model of sufficient reliability and validity and stable construction. Convergent validation was performed regarding the correlation of the TON-17 with another measure of ON (ORTO-15), eating disorders (the EAT-26 and DEAS), healthy behavior (the HBI), quality of life (the Brief WHOQOL), physical health (the GRSH), anxiety (the GAD-7), depression (the PHQ-9), and obsessive-compulsive disorder (the OCI-R). Gender, Body Mass Index (BMI), and the medical reasons for a restrictive diet were also examined. As a result of the structural analyses, the number of items was reduced from 40 to 17. The best fit indices of the TON-17 were found for the hierarchical bi-factor model, with three lower-order factors (Control of food quality, Fixation of health and healthy diet, and Disorder symptoms) and one general higher-order factor (Orthorexia). According to the 95th percentile method of estimation, the prevalence of ON was 5.5% for the TON-17 total score. The TON-17 scale and subscales showed good psychometric properties, stability, reliability, and construct validity. The TON-17 indicated a positive relationship with the ORTO-15, EAT-26, DEAS, HBI, OCI-R, GAD-7, and PHQ-9.

Many adults have experienced one or more episodes of musculoskeletal pain at some time of their lives, regardless of age, gender, or economic status. It affects approximately 47% of the general population. Of those, about 39–45% have long-lasting problems that require medical consultation. Inadequately managed musculoskeletal pain can adversely affect quality of life and impose significant socioeconomic problems. This manuscript presents a comprehensive review of the management of chronic musculoskeletal pain. It briefly explores the background, classifications, patient assessments, and different tools for management according to the recently available evidence. Multimodal analgesia and multidisciplinary approaches are fundamental elements of effective management of musculoskeletal pain. Both pharmacological, non-pharmacological, as well as interventional pain therapy are important to enhance patient’s recovery, well-being, and improve quality of life. Accordingly, recent guidelines recommend the implementation of preventative strategies and physical tools first to minimize the use of medications. In patients who have had an inadequate response to pharmacotherapy, the proper use of interventional pain therapy and the other alternative techniques are vital for safe and effective management of chronic pain patients.","El-Tallawy, Salah N.; Nalamasu, Rohit; Salem, Gehan I.; LeQuang, Jo Ann K.; Pergolizzi, Joseph V.; Christo, Paul J.",Pain Ther,80,22

There is increasing recognition that systemic inflammation is a major driver of this. IL-6 is implicated in cardiovascular disease (CVD) in the general population but its role in CVD in RA is undefined. Of the two modes of IL-6 signalling, trans-signalling is pro-inflammatory whereas classical signalling is linked with inflammation resolution. This study examines the role of IL-6 trans-signalling in CVD in a mouse model and patients with RA. METHODS: Myography determined the effect of IL-6 trans-signalling blockade, using sgp130Fc, on aortic constriction in murine collagen-induced arthritis. Serum CCL2 and sVCAM-1 as soluble biomarkers of sIL-6R trans-signalling were investigated in a human cross-sectional study. An observational longitudinal study investigated the association between these biomarkers and progression of subclinical atherosclerosis in early RA by measuring carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT). RESULTS: sgp130Fc reduced arthritis severity, serum CCL2 and sVCAM-1 and restored vascular function in collagen-induced arthritis (CIA). In established RA, sVCAM-1 correlated with the 28-joint DAS (DAS28) and CV risk. In early RA, baseline DAS28 was associated with CIMT change at 6 months. CIMT ‘rapid progressors’ at 12 months had higher baseline sVCAM-1, haemoglobin A1c, cholesterol:high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio and LDL cholesterol. CONCLUSIONS: IL-6 trans-signalling plays a pivotal role in vascular dysfunction in CIA. In early RA, sVCAM-1 was associated with progression of subclinical atherosclerosis. Inflammation from RA onset in CVD-susceptible individuals may accelerate atherosclerosis. IL-6 trans-signalling blockade may be beneficial to RA patients and perhaps for atherosclerosis in the general population.","Davies, Ruth; Williams, Jessica; Sime, Katie; Jin, Hyun-Sun; Thompson, Charlotte; Jordan, Lauren; Lang, Derek; Halcox, Julian P; Ellins, Elizabeth; Jones, Gareth W; Jones, Simon A; Rose-John, Stefan; Williams, Anwen; Choy, Ernest",Rheumatology (Oxford),80,1

Extracellular vesicles (EVs) possess parental cell properties, circulate in blood, CSF and urine, and provide paracrine and remote cell–cell communication messengers. This study investigated whether senescence‐associated secretory phenotype (SASP) and immune defense factors in EVs of urine could serve as biomarkers in elderly individuals with and without a comorbidity. Urine samples from young adults and elderly individuals with and without Parkinson disease (PD) were collected and stored at − 80 °C until studies. Urine EVs were separated from a drop-through solution and confirmed by verifying CD9, CD63, CD81 and syntenin expression. The EVs and drop-through solution were subjected to measurement of SASP cytokines and defense factors by Milliplex array assays. Many SASP cytokines and defense factors could be detected in urinary EVs but not urinary solutions. Elderly individuals (age > 60) had significantly higher levels of the SASP-associated factors IL-8, IP-10, GRO, and MCP-1 in EVs (p < 0.05). In contrast, some defense factors, IL-4, MDC and IFNα2 in EVs had significantly lower levels in elderly adults than in young adults (age < 30). Patients with and without PD exhibited a similar SASP profile in EVs but significantly lower levels of IL-10 in the EVs from patients with PD. This study used a simple device to separate urinary EVs from solution for comparisons of SASP and defense mediators between young adults and elders with and without PD. Results from this study indicate that aging signature is present in EVs circulating to urine and the signatures include higher inflammatory mediators and lower defense factors in urinary EVs but not solutions, suggesting a simple method to separate urinary EVs from solutions for searching aging mechanistic biomarkers may make prediction of aging and monitoring of anti-senolytic interventions possible.","Yeh, Shu-hui; Lin, Chia-Hsueh; Yang, Yun-Jung; Lin, Li-Wei; Tseng, Chih-Wen; Yang, Kuender D.",Sci Rep,80,27

Each of them can act by itself or in combination with the other two in developing a systemic inflammatory reaction syndrome (SIRS) that is a generalized reaction to the morbid event. The time course of SIRS is variable and influenced by the number and severity of subsequent insults (e.g., reparative surgery, acquired hospital infections). It occurs simultaneously with a complex of counter-regulatory mechanisms (compensatory anti-inflammatory response syndrome, CARS) that limit the aggressive effects of SIRS. In adjunct, a progressive dysfunction of the acquired (lymphocytes) immune system develops with increased risk for immunoparalysis and associated infectious complications. Both humoral and cellular effectors participate to the development of SIRS and CARS. The most important humoral mediators are pro-inflammatory (IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, IL-12) and anti-inflammatory (IL-4, IL-10) cytokines and chemokines, complement, leukotrienes, and PAF. Effector cells include neutrophils, monocytes, macrophages, lymphocytes, and endothelial cells. The endothelium is a key factor for production of remote organ damage as it exerts potent chemo-attracting effects on inflammatory cells, allows for leukocyte trafficking into tissues and organs, and promotes further inflammation by cytokines release. Moreover, the loss of vasoregulatory properties and the increased permeability contribute to the development of hypotension and tissue edema. Finally, the disseminated activation of the coagulation cascade causes the widespread deposition of microthrombi with resulting maldistribution of capillary blood flow and ultimately hypoxic cellular damage. This mechanism together with increased vascular permeability and vasodilation is responsible for the development of the multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS).","Arlati, Sergio",Operative Techniques and Recent Advances in Acute Care and Emergency Surgery,80,1

In the general population, the incidence and mortality associated with ARDS over the last two decades have steadily declined in parallel with optimized approaches to pneumonia and other underlying causes of ARDS as well as increased utilization of multimodal treatment strategies that include lung-protective ventilation. In the cancer settings, significant declines in the incidence and mortality of ARDS over the past two decades have also been reported, although these rates remain significantly higher than those in the general population. Epidemiologic studies identify infection, including disseminated fungal pneumonias, as a major underlying cause of ARDS in the cancer setting. More than half of cancer patients who develop ARDS will not survive to hospital discharge. Those who do survive often face a protracted and often incomplete recovery, resulting in significant long-term physical, psychological, and cognitive sequelae. The residual organ dysfunction and poor functional status after ARDS may delay or preclude subsequent cancer treatments. As such, close collaboration between the critical care physicians and oncology team is essential in identifying and reversing the underlying causes and optimizing treatments for cancer patients with ARDS.

But despite a strong initial bounce, high unemployment and surging corporate debt will limit the scale of the revival in H2 and beyond. And the renewed rise in Covid‐19 cases in parts of the world shows that considerable downside risks remain. ▀ After persistently surprising sharply to the downside, global economic data have exceeded expectations over the past month or so. Retail sales staged a particularly sharp rebound in Europe and North America in May. ▀ The sharp post‐lockdown consumer spending bounce in response to the release of pent‐up demand, along with some evidence of a revival in industrial production and global trade, is clearly encouraging. In response we have raised our mid‐year GDP forecasts for a number of economies, including the US and China, pushing up our 2020 world GDP growth forecast by about 0.5pp to −4.5%. ▀ Nonetheless, the risk of a second Covid‐19 wave, the swathe of negative headlines about job redundancies and the scaling‐back of some government support measures before long in some countries suggest that the sharp rebound in activity seen so far may not persist for too long. ▀ As a result, the upward revision to our forecast for global activity in the shorter‐term is offset by a more cautious assessment of growth prospects next year. We now expect the level of global GDP at end‐2021 to be a touch lower than anticipated a month ago. Overall, we have cut our world GDP growth forecast for 2021 from 6.5% to 5.8%. ▀ Our baseline forecast assumes that a global second wave of Covid‐19 is avoided. But in this respect, the recent resurgence in cases in some countries (and in some US states in particular) is a clear worry. Risks to our baseline forecast remain firmly tilted to the downside.",,,80,12

The most acute concerns have been over the adoption of the common currency: by adopting the euro, countries renounce their ability to meet an asymmetric shock with independent revaluations of their currencies. We systematically test the prediction that regional specialization increases vulnerability to economic downturn using a novel dataset that covers all of the EU’s subnational regions and major sectors of the economy between 2000 and 2013. We find that, contrary to conventional wisdom, the most specialized regions actually fared better during the 2008-09 global financial crisis. Specialized regions performed worse only in states that remained outside the Eurozone. The heightened vulnerability of non-Eurozone states cannot be attributed to fiscal or social policy failures. Rather, our results suggest the common currency may have helped Eurozone members share risk. This bodes well for the resiliency of the EU, even as it navigates another economic downturn from the asymmetric impact of the novel coronavirus.

Previously published literature identified risk factors (advanced age, higher severity of illness and elevated d-dimer) for mortality in a cohort of patients from Wuhan, China and mechanical ventilation in a case series from NYC. Another case series from NYC evaluated clinical outcomes only. There are limited published studies assessing clinical characteristics, outcomes and risk factors for mortality in COVID-19 patients in NYC. The objective of this study was to assess the risk factors for mortality in patients with confirmed COVID-19 infections. METHODS: This study was a single center retrospective case-control at The Brooklyn Hospital Center, a 464-bed community teaching hospital. Adult patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection, who received at least 24 hours of COVID-19 therapy were included. Endpoints assessed were risk factors for mortality in COVID-19 patients, increase in QTc, renal failure or renal replacement therapy, ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia. Baseline characteristics between survivor and non-survivors were analyzed utilizing Mann-Whitney U test/two-tailed t-tests for continuous data and Chi-square/Fisher’s exact test for categorical data. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were conducted to identify the risk factors for in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: Two-hundred and eighty six patients were included in this analysis, of whom 97 (33.9%) were non-survivors and 189 (66.1%) patients were survivors. Diabetes and coronary artery disease were more common in non-survivors compared to survivors (p = 0.003 and p < 0.001, respectively). Multivariable logistic regression showed higher in-hospital mortality in patients with advanced age (odds ratio 5.779, 95 % confidence interval 1.369–24.407), vasopressor initiation (OR 28.301, 95 % CI 3.307–242.176), and development of renal failure (OR 30.927, 95 % CI 1.871–511.201). CONCLUSION: Risk factors associated with mortality for COVID-19 patients in a community teaching hospital include advanced age, vasopressor therapy, and development of renal failure.

Up to now there is a lack of knowledge about the subjective perception of one’s own occupationally associated health and satisfaction as well as the identification of occupational characteristics that are detrimental to health. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Within the framework of a questionnaire-based cross-sectional survey, a cohort of dance teachers in Germany were investigated about dimensions of their own health and general job satisfaction in connection with their profession as a dance teacher. Likert scales were primarily used for these assessments. Additionally, general anthropometric and sociodemographic characteristics were recorded. Beside examining the overall cohort, gender-specific differences were tested. The statistical analysis included n = 232 dance teachers (male 51/female 181) aged 43.1 ± 11.0 years. RESULTS: The general state of health was rated as satisfactory (26.1%) to very good (14.7%) by 85.3% of those surveyed. Of the dance teachers 59.2% even rated their health as good (35.3%) to very good. There was a high degree of satisfaction with their own professional practice for 80% of the participants. Most of the dance teachers felt that they were able to deal with the physical (75.7%) and psychological demands of their profession (70.3%). In addition to fears about the future (51.5%), the main burdensome professional characteristics on dance teachers’ self-perception were organizational aspects of work (lack of time for family and friends in 28.4%) and economic aspects (income insecurity in 61.0% and lack of old age security in 65.7%). CONCLUSION: The profession as a dance teacher is accompanied by a high level of general satisfaction and a positive perception of one’s own state of health. A confirmation of these positive results by injury and illness statistics is still pending. In addition, an improvement in work organization and economic aspects would be desirable.","Schmidt, Mike; Ohlendorf, Daniela; Reer, Rüdiger; Groneberg, David A.; Wanke, Eileen M.",Zentralbl Arbeitsmed Arbeitsschutz Ergon,80,1

Alcohol and opioid use disorders (AUD/OUD) significantly increase risk for suicidal ideation, attempts, and death, and are the two most frequently implicated substances in suicide risk. We provide a brief overview of shared risk factors and pathways in the pathogenesis of AUD/OUD and suicidal thoughts and behaviors. We also review clinical recommendations on inpatient care, pharmacotherapy, and psychotherapeutic interventions for people with AUD/OUD and co-occurring suicidal ideation and behavior. RECENT FINDINGS: Among people with an underlying vulnerability to risk-taking and impulsive behaviors, chronic alcohol intoxication can increase maladaptive coping behaviors and hinder self-regulation, thereby increasing the risk of suicide. Additionally, chronic opioid use can result in neurobiological changes that lead to increases in negative affective states, jointly contributing to suicide risk and continued opioid use. Despite significantly elevated suicide risk in individuals with AUD/OUD, there is a dearth of research on pharmacological and psychosocial interventions for co-occurring AUD/OUD and suicidal ideation and behavior. SUMMARY: Further research is needed to understand the effects of alcohol and opioid use on suicide risk, as well as address notable gaps in the literature on psychosocial and pharmacological interventions to lower risk for suicide among individuals with AUD/OUD.","Rizk, Mina M.; Herzog, Sarah; Dugad, Sanjana; Stanley, Barbara",Curr Addict Rep,80,22

Deficiencies in kinetochore function can lead to chromosomal instability and aneuploidy-a hallmark of cancer cells. Kinetochore function is controlled by recruitment of regulatory proteins, many of which have been documented, however their function often remains uncharacterized and many are yet to be identified. To identify candidates of kinetochore regulation we used a proteome-wide protein association strategy in budding yeast and detected many proteins that are involved in post-translational modifications such as kinases, phosphatases and histone modifiers. We focused on the Polo-like kinase, Cdc5, and interrogated which cellular components were sensitive to constitutive Cdc5 localization. The kinetochore is particularly sensitive to constitutive Cdc5 kinase activity. Targeting Cdc5 to different kinetochore subcomplexes produced diverse phenotypes, consistent with multiple distinct functions at the kinetochore. We show that targeting Cdc5 to the inner kinetochore, the constitutive centromere-associated network (CCAN), increases the levels of centromeric RNA via an SPT4 dependent mechanism.","Ólafsson, Guðjón; Thorpe, Peter H",PLoS genetics,80,17

METHOD The study was prospectively performed between June 2013 and December 2013 using 70 patients. Forty randomly selected patients (group 1) were treated with manual guidance and 30 patients (group 2) were treated using a novel robotic guidance. Parameters evaluated were procedural accuracy, total procedural time, procedural performance, quantitative/qualitative image quality and patient dose. Two-sided Student's t test and Wilcoxon rank-sum test were used to test the significance of the data and p values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. RESULT Accuracy parameters were significantly higher in group 2 (all p < 0.05). Total procedural time showed a mean time difference of 3 min (group 2 > group 1; p = 0.0008). Volume CT dose index and dose-length product were significantly lower for group 2 compared to group 1 (all p < 0.05) for CT fluoroscopy imaging. Total procedural performance score was higher for group 2 compared to group 1 (p = 0.0001). Image quality parameters were insignificant between examined groups. CONCLUSION The novel robotic guided approach improved the accuracy of targeting the target tumour, reduced patient dose and increased procedural performance (which influences the procedural safety) during ablation. KEY POINTS • Few reports are available in the literature regarding robotic-assisted liver microwave ablation. • The robotic guided approach improved accuracy of localizing the target tumour. • Radiation dose on patients was reduced with the robotic guidance. • Numbers of insertions and readjustments were reduced, lowering chances of complications.","Mbalisike, Emmanuel C; Vogl, Thomas J; Zangos, Stefan; Eichler, Katrin; Balakrishnan, Prakash; Paul, Jijo",European radiology,80,20

Anticoagulation in patients with cirrhosis is often a clinical conundrum for providers as the necessary balance between thrombotic and bleeding risk is complicated by end organ damage. Recent meta-analyses have sought to evaluate the safety and efficacy of direct oral anticoagulants in patients with liver disease. These recent analyses are limited by various bleeding definitions, broad inclusion criteria, and few indications for anticoagulation. We sought to conduct a meta-analysis using a validated definition for major bleeding and compare rates between traditional anticoagulation and DOACs in patients with cirrhosis. Articles were eligible for inclusion if the international society on thrombosis and hemostasis (ISTH) definition of a major bleed was the primary safety outcome. Additionally, only articles including patients with cirrhosis and receiving treatment with anticoagulation for an indication for stroke prevention or venous thromboembolism were eligible. Eligible articles needed a DOAC comparator group against traditional anticoagulant medication. Seven studies met inclusion criteria and compiled data for 683 patients in the meta-analysis. Pooled trial analysis demonstrated no statistically significant difference in the primary outcome of ISTH major bleeding (OR 0.55, 95%CI 0.28-1.07, I2 0%). Individual secondary outcomes of all bleeding, intracerebral hemorrhage, or gastrointestinal bleeding also demonstrated no significant difference between DOACs and traditional anticoagulation.

The purpose of these studies was to assess the effects of As(+3) on bone marrow progenitor cell colony formation and the humoral immune response to a T-dependent antigen response (TDAR) in vivo. In a 30 day drinking water study, mice were exposed to 19, 75, or 300 ppb As(+3). There was a decrease in bone marrow cell recovery, but not spleen cell recovery at 300 ppb As(+3). In the bone marrow, As(+3) altered neither the expression of CD34+ and CD38+ cells, markers of early hematopoietic stem cells, nor CD45-/CD105+, markers of mesenchymal stem cells. Spleen cell surface marker CD45 expression on B cells (CD19+), T cells (CD3+), T helper cells (CD4+) and cytotoxic T cells (CD8+), natural killer (NK+), and macrophages (Mac 1+) were not altered by the 30 day in vivo As(+3) exposure. Functional assays of CFU-B colony formation showed significant selective suppression (p<0.05) by 300 ppb As(+3) exposure, whereas CFU-GM formation was not altered. The TDAR of the spleen cells was significantly suppressed at 75 and 300 ppb As(+3). In vitro studies of the bone marrow revealed a selective suppression of CFU-B by 50 nM As(+3) in the absence of apparent cytotoxicity. Monomethylarsonous acid (MMA(+3)) demonstrated a dose-dependent and selective suppression of CFU-B beginning at 5 nM (p<0.05). MMA(+3) suppressed CFU-GM formation at 500 nM, a concentration that proved to be nonspecifically cytotoxic. As(+5) did not suppress CFU-B and/or CFU-GM in vitro at concentrations up to 500 nM. Collectively, these results demonstrate that As(+3) and likely its metabolite (MMA(+3)) target lymphoid progenitor cells in mouse bone marrow and mature B and T cell activity in the spleen.","Ezeh, Peace C; Lauer, Fredine T; MacKenzie, Debra; McClain, Shea; Liu, Ke Jian; Hudson, Laurie G; Gandolfi, A Jay; Burchiel, Scott W",PloS one,80,16

In particular a main interest was hereby the so-called facelift surgery and the first two German pioneers in this field: Eugen Holländer and Erich Lexer. AIM OF THE PAPER The surgeons Eugen Holländer and Erich Lexer contributed to a big part to the development of facelift techniques. The paper aims to highlight in which way both surgeons conducted their research work and the topic of facelift and which findings could be drawn out of their work. METHOD On the basis of old specialist literature and congressional quotations the curriculua vitae of Eugen Holländer and Erich Lexer are portrayed, as well as their professional career and their ground breaking work for facelift surgery and its differences amongst each other. CONCLUSION Both Eugen Holländer and Erich Lexer performed, independently from another, the first facelifts in Germany. Hereby, their operative approach was different. In contrast to Holländer who only performed skin resections for a better tightening of the face, Lexer undermined the skin in an area of multiple centimetres.Even in their suture technique the difference was visible. Lexer for instance conducted a special suture technique by including the fascia temporalis superficialis in his sutures for achieving lasting stability and tension relief. Due to this reason Lexer can be regarded without any doubt as the initial pioneer of modern facelift surgery.","Locher, Wolfgang G; Feinendegen, Dominik L","Handchirurgie, Mikrochirurgie, plastische Chirurgie : Organ der Deutschsprachigen Arbeitsgemeinschaft fur Handchirurgie : Organ der Deutschsprachigen Arbeitsgemeinschaft fur Mikrochirurgie der Peripheren Nerven und Gefasse : Organ der V...",80,11

Weather-related dynamics have an impact on the pattern of human health and disease. The present study aimed to investigate the impact of heat and humidity on daily basis incidence and mortality due to COVID-19 pandemic in ten of the world's hottest countries compared to ten of the coldest ones. MATERIALS AND METHODS Worldwide, we selected 20 countries; 10 hottest countries with the highest temperatures and 10 coldest countries with the lowest temperature. The selection of the countries was based on the daily basis mean temperature from the date of appearance of the initial cases of COVID-19, Dec 29, 2019 to May 12, 2020. In the world's 10 hottest countries, the mean temperature was (26.31±1.51) and humidity (44.67±4.97). However, in the world's 10 coldest countries the mean temperature was (6.19±1.61) and humidity (57.26±2.35). The data on the global outbreak of COVID-19, daily new cases and deaths were recorded from World Health Organization, and daily information on temperature and humidity was obtained from metrological web ""Time and Date"". RESULTS In countries with high temperatures and low humidity, the mean daily cases incidence were (407.12±24.33); cumulative cases (9094.34±708.29); and cumulative deaths (452.84±43.30) were significantly low compared to countries with low temperatures and high humidity: daily cases (1876.72±207.37); cumulative cases (44232.38±5875.11); and cumulative deaths (2008.29±310.13). Moreover, COVID-19 cases and deaths per million population were significantly low in countries with high temperatures (cases 711.23, and deaths 16.27) compared to countries with low temperatures (cases 1685.99; and deaths 86.40). Furthermore, in hottest countries, a 1% increase in humidity reduced number of cases and deaths by (β = -5.40, p<0.001) and (β = -0.187, p=0.004) respectively. A similar trend was seen with a 1°C increase in temperature, reducing the number of deaths by (β = -1.35. p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS The results revealed a significant decrease in incidence of daily cases and deaths in countries with high temperatures and low humidity (warmest countries), compared to those countries with low temperatures and high humidity (coldest countries). The findings could be of interest to the policymakers and the health officials on the epidemiological trends of COVID-19 pandemic and weather changes.","Meo, S A; Abukhalaf, A A; Alomar, A A; Al-Beeshi, I Z; Alhowikan, A; Shafi, K M; Meo, A S; Usmani, A M; Akram, J",European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,80,1

Currently, surgeons evaluate tissue ischemia without any simple routine measurement technique. A new tissue surface probe, T-Stat 303, provides continuous measurement of tissue hemoglobin oxygen saturation (StO(2)) and may have clinical utility for intraoperative assessment of blood flow in areas of surgical anastomosis. This pilot study aimed to determine local StO(2) during gut stapling using various staple sizes for the purpose of assessing the tool's ability to measure changes and the reproducibility of those changes with stapling. METHODS Measurements were made in nine anesthetized adult swine during laparotomy. Various staple heights were used to transect small bowel and colon. Serosal and mucosal surface measurements were obtained at baseline and on each side of the transection using the T-Stat device adjacent to the staple line and 2 cm away from it. RESULTS Both small bowel and colon mucosal StO(2) adjacent to the staple line showed significant ischemia compared with baseline (p < 0.001) and 2 cm away from the staple line (p < 0.001) using all staple heights. The serosa of both small bowel and colon adjacent to the staple line was not significantly different from baseline serosa (p > 0.11) except when the grey stapler was used (baseline, 58 +/- 6.6 vs. staple line, 51 +/- 15.1; p = 0.022). The baseline mucosa of the small bowel and colon did not differ from mucosa 2 cm away from the staple line (p > 0.08). The small bowel serosa 2 cm away from the staple line did not differ from baseline mucosa, whereas the colon serosa 2 cm away significantly increased after stapling compared with baseline mucosa (p < 0.012). No statistically significant StO(2) difference was found between the various staple load sizes. CONCLUSION Mucosal ischemia occurs after gastrointestinal stapling and is not affected by various staple heights. The T-Stat probe provides a real-time method for assessment of gut ischemia by surgeons during surgical procedures.","Myers, Christopher; Mutafyan, Gevorg; Petersen, Rebecca; Pryor, Aurora; Reynolds, James; Demaria, Eric",Surgical endoscopy,80,16

Early recanalisation is the most powerful predictor of favourable outcome in patients with stroke, and may be improved with mechanical thrombectomy using stent retriever devices. However, the benefit in functional outcome and safety of stent retrievers are not yet well known. The aim of this study was to assess efficacy and safety profiles of stent retriever thrombectomy in BAO patients with stroke. METHODS We analysed data retrospectively from our consecutive clinical series and conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of all previous studies of stent retriever thrombectomy in BAO patients with stroke between November 2010 and April 2014. RESULTS From March 2010 to March 2013, 22 patients with acute BAO were treated with a Solitaire stent retriever in our series. Favourable outcome was significantly associated with younger age and distal BAO. The literature search identified 15 previous studies involving a total of 312 subjects. In the meta-analysis, including our series data, the recanalisation rate (Thrombolysis In Cerebral Infarction (TICI) score ≥ 2b) reached 81% (95% CI 73% to 87%). The rate of symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage was 4% (95% CI 2% to 8%), favourable outcome (modified Rankin Scale (mRS) ≤ 2 at 3 months) was found in 42% (95% CI 36% to 48%) and mortality rate was 30% (95% CI 25% to 36%). CONCLUSIONS Stent retriever thrombectomy is a safe treatment modality for patients with stroke presenting with BAO. Although the stent retrievers showed a good recanalisation rate, there are currently no randomised clinical trials to assess its clinical efficacy in comparison with the reference treatment.","Gory, Benjamin; Eldesouky, Islam; Sivan-Hoffmann, Rotem; Rabilloud, Murielle; Ong, Elodie; Riva, Roberto; Gherasim, Dorin Nicolae; Turjman, Alexis; Nighoghossian, Norbert; Turjman, Francis","Journal of neurology, neurosurgery, and psychiatry",80,1

In this experimental study, we were able to replicate earlier findings by demonstrating that listeners (N = 107) showed significantly more willingness to interact with, more social support towards, and a more positive attitude towards coherent than incoherent narrators. Remarkably, these beneficial effects of coherence were observed only for narratives about positive memories. Results are explained in the light of the relevance of positive memories for the social bonding function of autobiographical memory. Furthermore, earlier work was extended and refined by investigating effects of the individual constituting dimensions of coherence (context, chronology, theme) on social responses. In line with our predictions, the dimensions of chronology and theme were most important in impacting social responses of listeners. Possibly a reduction of the attraction effect due to increased effortful processing and reduced credibility due to insufficient emotional elaboration might explain these results respectively. Furthermore, social responses were worse when narratives were incoherent with regard to more than one dimension, in line with the expected additive effect. Overall, fully incoherent narratives, which had had low scores on context, chronology, and theme, had the most adverse effect on listeners' social responses. This study adds significantly to the domain of memory and cognition by showing how cognitive psychological research would benefit from extending a merely intrapersonal perspective to include an interpersonal perspective that considers social implications of memory and cognition as well.","Vanaken, Lauranne; Hermans, Dirk",Memory & cognition,80,16

The aim of this study is to describe the technique of mini-laparoscopic cholecystectomy (MLC) and to report the outcome of this approach when used as a routine procedure. METHODS Since January 2012, all consecutive patients undergoing MLC were included in this study. Operative and perioperative data were prospectively collected. Additionally, cost analysis was performed. RESULTS From 2012 to 2015, 200 MLC were performed (F/M: 132/68, mean age 45±16 years). Mean operative duration was 97±32min for the first 50 patients and 75±25min for the subsequent 150 patients (P<0.0001). Modifications in the number or size of trocars were necessary in nine of the first 50 procedures and in seven of the subsequent 150 procedures (P=0.003). Perioperative morbidity included gallbladder perforation (n=28) or moderate (<50mL) bleeding (n=6). Postoperative morbidity was 4%. The mean global cost for a MLC procedure was 1757±1855 euros. This cost decreased from 2946±3115 euros in the first 50 patients to 1390±1278 euros in the subsequent 150 patients (P=0.001). CONCLUSION Mini-laparoscopy can be used for routine elective cholecystectomy. This approach is associated with low morbidity and good cosmetic results.","Dammaro, C; Tranchart, H; Gaillard, M; Debelmas, A; Ferretti, S; Lainas, P; Dagher, I",Journal of visceral surgery,80,19

RECENT FINDINGS This review focuses on patient-centered outcomes in the ICU, highlighting the latest research to promote brain health and psychological recovery during and after perioperative critical illness. Topics include sedation in the obese patient, delirium severity assessments, the role of the Psychiatry Consultation-Liaison in the ICU, Post-intensive care syndrome, and the importance of family engagement in the COVID era. SUMMARY Highlighting new research, such as novel implementation strategies in addition to a lack of research in certain areas like sleep in the ICU may lead to innovation and establishment of evidence-based practices in critical care. Perioperative brain health is multifaceted, and an increase in multidisciplinary interventions may help improve outcomes and decrease morbidity in ICU survivors.","Ortiz, Damaris",Current opinion in critical care,80,8

METHODS In this systematic review, we searched MEDLINE, Embase, Central, and CINAHL from inception to October 17, 2019. We included studies comparing diagnostic and prognostic prediction of ED patients by ML models to usual care methods (triage-based scores, clinical prediction tools, clinician judgment) using predictor variables readily available to ED clinicians. We extracted commonly reported performance metrics of model discrimination and classification. We used the PROBAST tool for risk of bias assessment. PROSPERO registration: CRD42020158129. RESULTS The search yielded 1,656 unique records, of which 23 studies involving 16,274,647 patients were included. In all seven diagnostic studies, ML models outperformed usual care in all performance metrics. In six studies assessing in-hospital mortality, the best-performing ML models had better discrimination (AUROC 0.74-0.94) than any clinical decision tool (AUROC 0.68-0.81). In four studies assessing hospitalization, ML models had better discrimination (AUROC 0.80-0.83) than triage-based scores (AUROC 0.68-0.82). Clinical heterogeneity precluded meta-analysis. Most studies had high risk of bias due to lack of external validation, low event rates, and insufficient reporting of calibration. CONCLUSIONS Our review suggests that ML may have better prediction performance than usual care for ED patients with a variety of clinical presentations and outcomes. However, prediction model reporting guidelines should be followed to provide clinically applicable data. Interventional trials are needed to assess the impact of ML models on patient-centered outcomes.","Kareemi, Hashim; Vaillancourt, Christian; Rosenberg, Hans; Fournier, Karine; Yadav, Krishan",Academic emergency medicine : official journal of the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine,80,1

In this research, we examine how talking about crises such as COVID-19 at the team level affects team dynamics and behaviors. Drawing upon cultural tightness-looseness theory, we propose that talking about the COVID-19 crisis among team members is positively associated with team cultural tightness, which in turn benefits teams by decreasing team deviance but hurts teams by decreasing team creativity. Furthermore, we suggest that team virtuality moderates and weakens these indirect effects because face-to-face communication about COVID-19 is more powerful in influencing team cultural tightness than virtual communication. Results from a multisource, three-wave field study during the pandemic lend substantial support to these hypotheses. We discuss the theoretical and practical implications of these findings and directions for future research.

Bacteriophage 29 protein p1 is a membrane-associated protein that forms large protofilament sheets that resemble eukaryotic tubulin and bacterial filamenting temperature-sensitive mutant Z protein (FtsZ) polymers. In the absence of protein p1, phage 29 DNA replication is impaired. Here we show that a functional fusion of protein p1 to YFP localizes at the medial region of Bacillus subtilis cells independently of other phage-encoded proteins. We also show that 29 protein p1 colocalizes with the B. subtilis cell division protein FtsZ and provide evidence that FtsZ and protein p1 are associated. Importantly, the midcell localization of YFP-p1 was disrupted in a strain that does not express FtsZ, and the fluorescent signal was distributed all over the cell. Depletion of penicillin-binding protein 2B (PBP2B) in B. subtilis cells did not affect the subcellular localization of YFP-p1, indicating that its distribution does not depend on septal wall synthesis. Interestingly, when 29 protein p1 was expressed, B. subtilis cells were about 1.5-fold longer than control cells, and the accumulation of 29 DNA was higher in mutant B. subtilis cells with increased length. We discuss the biological role of p1 and FtsZ in the 29 growth cycle.","Ballesteros-Plaza, David; Holguera, Isabel; Scheffers, Dirk-Jan; Salas, Margarita; Muñoz-Espín, Daniel",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,80,1

The incidence of pelvic floor symptoms has not been reported in women who have undergone a hysterectomy for early-stage endometrial cancer. OBJECTIVE We sought to evaluate pelvic floor function in women who have had surgical treatment for early-stage endometrial cancer as part of the multinational Laparoscopic Approach to Cancer of the Endometrium trial and to compare patients' outcomes who had total abdominal vs total laparoscopic hysterectomy. STUDY DESIGN A multinational, phase III, randomized noninferiority trial compared disease-free survival of patients who had total abdominal hysterectomy vs total laparoscopic hysterectomy. This substudy analyzes the results from a self-administered validated questionnaire on pelvic floor symptoms (Pelvic Floor Distress Inventory) administered preoperatively, and at follow-up visits 6, 18, 30, 42, and 54 months postoperatively. RESULTS Overall, 381 patients with endometrial cancer were included in the analysis (total abdominal hysterectomy, n = 195; total laparoscopic hysterectomy, n = 186). At 6 months postsurgery both groups experienced an improvement in Pelvic Floor Distress Inventory scores compared to presurgical pelvic floor well-being (total abdominal hysterectomy: mean change -11.17; 95% confidence interval, -17.11 to -5.24; total laparoscopic hysterectomy: mean change -10.25; 95% confidence interval, -16.31 to -4.19). The magnitude of change from baseline in pelvic floor symptoms did not differ between both treatment groups up to 54 months postsurgery. CONCLUSION These findings suggest that pelvic floor function in terms of urinary, bowel, and prolapse symptoms are unlikely to deteriorate following abdominal or laparoscopic hysterectomy and are reassuring for women undergoing hysterectomy for early-stage endometrial cancer.","Higgs, Peta; Janda, Monika; Asher, Rebecca; Gebski, Val; Forder, Peta; Obermair, Andreas",American journal of obstetrics and gynecology,80,17

More research is needed to understand how OHI and online social support may influence illness experiences and patient-practitioner relationships in people with arthritis-related fatigue. The present study aimed to explore how OHI and social media shape these experiences by using an inductive qualitative analysis. METHOD Seven focus groups were conducted with 21 participants aged 28-77 diagnosed with a range of rheumatic diseases. Within the focus groups, participants were asked questions about OHI, online social support and the role of OHI in their health care. The focus groups were recorded, transcribed and analysed using a combination of interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA) and thematic analysis. RESULTS The analysis resulted in three themes: (a) how online social support changes illness experiences, (b) communicating fatigue to health professionals using OHI and (c) health care experiences online. These themes provide insight into the ways people with arthritis-related fatigue benefit from online social support, use OHI to support communication with health professionals and how they share health care for arthritis in online spaces. CONCLUSION This research expanded on previous literature addressing the role of OHI and social media in the illness experience of arthritis-related fatigue. As technology use is increasing, particularly in the current extraordinary environment of social distancing, it is critical to address the role of OHI and social media in health care. In this study, OHI and social media played a prevalent role in the health care of many participants.","Muir, Julia; Hegarty, Roisin S M; Stebbings, Simon; Treharne, Gareth J",Musculoskeletal care,80,1

Assessment of histopathological changes currently requires animal models. We set about developing a viable, resource effective animal model to study these effects and to develop a detailed tissue injury score. Methods Six pigs were anesthetized using a standard regimen. We intubated the tracheas using a standard endotracheal tube modified to include optical sensors. Animals were anesthetized for a duration of two to four hours, and their lungs were ventilated using a normoxic gas mixture. Following euthanasia, the tracheas were removed and underwent histological assessment by two independent veterinary pathologists. The histological lesions, including controls, were described and quantified, and two pathologists classified tissues according to a novel injury score. Results Mean duration of tracheal intubation was 191 minutes (SD ± 41.6). In all except one animal, cuff pressures were maintained in the range of 25-45 cmH20. Histopathological findings in all study animals showed more extensive changes than previously described with short-term intubation. Changes were seen in all mucosal layers consistent with acute, suppurative, and ulcerative tracheitis. The range of scores of the developed composite scoring system among the animals was wider than in earlier descriptions. There was a high percentage of agreement between both pathologists. Conclusions We have described a novel tracheal injury score to assess pathological changes following short term intubation in a viable animal model. The scoring system distinguished between the test animals as well as controls and may be appropriate for continuing study of intubation injury.

In this short communication, we successfully constructed a stable full-length infectious cDNA clone derived from DHAV-3 by solving instability of cloned full-length cDNA in Escherichia coli (E. coli). The cDNA fragments amplified from the genome of DHAV-3 were assembled and inserted into a low-copy-number plasmid. Finally, a full-length cDNA clone containing an engineered SacII site that served as a genetic marker was obtained. The cDNA clone showed stable by serial passages in E. coli when propagated at 25°C under low level of antibiotic selection. BHK-21 cells were transfected with transcribed RNA from the full-length cDNA clone; infectious viral particles were rescued, showing its fatality to 10-day-old duck embryos. The results indicated that the constructed full-length cDNA clone of DHAV-3 is infectious. By various virological assays, our results indicated that the rescued virus exhibited similar biological properties with the parental virus.

However, the correlations of TPPP3 between prognosis and immune infiltrates in different tumors are still unclear. The analysis of TPPP3 expression was performed via Oncomine and Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis (GEPIA) website. We also used GEPIA to assess the impact of TPPPT3 on clinical outcomes. The related pathways involved in TPPP3 were analyzed by gene-set enrichment analysis (GSEA), and the correlation between TPPP3 and immune infiltration was studied by Tumor Immune Estimation Resource2.0 (TIMER 2.0). The TPPP3 expression was significantly reduced in head and neck squamous carcinoma (HNSC) compared to adjacent tissues. In addition, the low expression of TPPP3 in HNSC was significantly associated with prognosis. The pathways closely related to the low expression of TPPP3 are ""Antigen Processing and Presentation,"" ""Primary Immunodeficiency,"" and so on. The TPPP3 expression was negatively correlated with the level of CD8+ T cell, B cell, and myeloid dendritic cell infiltration in HNSC. The TPPP3 expression is closely related to multiple immunomarkers in CD8+ T cell and Myeloid dendritic cells. These data indicate that TPPP3 is associated with multiple cancers and involves multiple immune-related pathways, and TPPP3 is associated with immune infiltration levels. Besides, the TPPP3 expression may help regulate tumor-associated CD8 + T cells, DC cells in HNSC. We conclude TPPP3 can be considered as a biomarker for predicting head and neck squamous cell carcinoma prognosis and immune infiltration.","Yang, Zheng; Li, Xiaohong; Li, Jingyu; Su, Qisheng; Qiu, Yuling; Zhang, Zunni; Zhang, Liqian; Mo, Wuning",BioMed research international,80,17

In the present experimental study, two different devices were investigated regarding tissue ingrowth, adhesion formation and solid mesh placement. METHODS Two devices of 4.3 cm diameter, one ePTFE-containing small pore polypropylene mesh (PP/ePTFE) and a multi-layered large-pore polypropylene patch with an oxidized cellulose anti-adhesive barrier (PP/ORC), both containing a self-deployment system, were placed intraperitoneally at the linea alba of 24 female pigs. A first laparoscopy was performed to evaluate mesh positioning against the abdominal wall. 1 (n = 6), 2 (n = 6), 4 (n = 6) and 12 weeks (n = 6) later, mesh appearance was inspected and adhesion formation was assessed. All meshes were excised for histological evaluation. RESULTS Folding of the patch was more frequently observed at PP/ePTFE, yet no excessive cupping was noticed. Adhesions predominantly presented at short-term evaluation. Overall adhesion formation at all samples was significantly more extensive for PP/ORC (p = 0.048). Massive shrinkage was observed for PP/ORC: after a 12-week period 22% residual surface was preserved, compared to 83% for PP/ePTFE (p < 0.001). While at short-term inflammatory reaction was comparable, at long-term PP/ORC induced a significant more pronounced inflammatory and foreign body reaction. CONCLUSIONS Although a strong deployment system provides adequate initial placement, shrinkage and excessive adhesion formation are much more prominent in the large-pore multi-layered restorbable devices compared to the ePTFE patch. This might influence long-term clinical outcome and caution seems warranted.","Reynvoet, E; Chiers, K; Van Overbeke, I; Troisi, R; Berrevoet, F",Hernia : the journal of hernias and abdominal wall surgery,80,1

Practical hints from the expert panel of the Assembly of Intensive Care and Rehabilitation of the Polish Respiratory Society.,17.728882,10.544272,2020,"PURPOSE Analyse exhaled airflow patterns in a clinical scenario and the impact of infection control practices as well as room air circulation in context of the COVID19 pandemic. SETTING Raghudeep Eye Hospital, India DESIGN:: Experimental study METHODS:: 10 patients attending ophthalmic outpatient clinic(OPD) and operating room(OR) were included. Using Schlieren imaging, exhaled airflow patterns were documented with/without an N95 mask or face shield during respiratory activities. Recordings were performed with and without room air conditioning turned on. Exhaled airflow patterns in OPD and OR when using versus not using these infection control measures, as well as the impact of room air circulation on these were compared. RESULTS There was a forward stream of exhaled air from the patient's mouth/nose during all respiratory activities. An N95 mask dampened its intensity and forward transmission. Taping the mask around the nasal bridge further reduced airflow leakage. A mechanical barrier in front of the patient's face blocked forward propagation of the exhaled airflow. Turning on a forceful and direct draft of air over the surgeon's working area dampened and diverted the exhaled airflow away from the surgeons' breathing area. This effect was particularly pronounced in the OR, with the overhead laminar airflow. CONCLUSIONS Using a high force airflow with the draft facing downwards can dampen and divert the exhaled airflow away from healthcare providers. Using masks /mechanical barriers and taping the mask reduces potential dissemination of aerosols and thereby human and surface contamination.","Srivastava, Samaresh; Vasavada, Vaishali; Vasavada, Abhay R; Sudhalkar, Aditya; Kothari, Abhishek; Vasavada, Shail A",Journal of cataract and refractive surgery,80,8

We aimed to assess the relation between admission BP and clinical outcomes and successful reperfusion after EVT. METHODS We used data from the MR CLEAN (Multicenter Randomized Controlled Trial of Endovascular Treatment for Acute Ischemic Stroke in the Netherlands) Registry, an observational, prospective, nationwide cohort study of patients with ischemic stroke treated with EVT in routine clinical practice in the Netherlands. Baseline systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP) were recorded on admission. The primary outcome was the score on the modified Rankin Scale at 90 days. Secondary outcomes included successful reperfusion (extended Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction score 2B-3), symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage, and 90-day mortality. Multivariable logistic and linear regression were used to assess the associations of SBP and DBP with outcomes. The relations between BPs and outcomes were tested for nonlinearity. Parameter estimates were calculated per 10 mm Hg increase or decrease in BP. RESULTS We included 3180 patients treated with EVT between March 2014 and November 2017. The relations between admission SBP and DBP with 90-day modified Rankin Scale scores and mortality were J-shaped, with inflection points around 150 and 81 mm Hg, respectively. An increase in SBP above 150 mm Hg was associated with poor functional outcome (adjusted common odds ratio, 1.09 [95% CI, 1.04-1.15]) and mortality at 90 days (adjusted odds ratio, 1.09 [95% CI, 1.03-1.16]). Following linear relationships, higher SBP was associated with a lower probability of successful reperfusion (adjusted odds ratio, 0.97 [95% CI, 0.94-0.99]) and with the occurrence of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (adjusted odds ratio, 1.06 [95% CI, 0.99-1.13]). Results for DBP were largely similar. CONCLUSIONS In patients with acute ischemic stroke treated with EVT, higher admission BP is associated with lower probability of successful reperfusion and with poor clinical outcomes. Further research is needed to investigate whether these patients benefit from BP reduction before EVT.","van den Berg, Sophie A; Uniken Venema, Simone M; Mulder, Maxim J H L; Treurniet, Kilian M; Samuels, Noor; Lingsma, Hester F; Goldhoorn, Robert-Jan B; Jansen, Ivo G H; Coutinho, Jonathan M; Roozenbeek, Bob; Dippel, Diederik W J; Roos, Yvo B W E M; van der Worp, H Bart; Nederkoorn, Paul J",Stroke,80,16

METHODS Thirty-five older adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus were assigned to 2 groups according to their frailty status: exercise training group (prefrail or frail; n = 21; 74.7 [4.5] y; 33.3% male) and control group (robust; n = 14; 73.1 [3.9] y; 42.9% male). The exercise training group followed a multicomponent training program focusing on muscle power: supervised (5 wk) and unsupervised (6 wk). The primary outcomes, including PA and sitting time, perceived disability, and HRQoL, were assessed at the baseline and after 11 weeks. RESULTS At the end of confinement, there were significant decreases in PA in both groups (P < .05). Thus, sitting time increased more in the control group than in the exercise training group (P < .05). The HRQoL measures remained unchanged. CONCLUSIONS Muscle power training before and during mandatory COVID-19 self-isolation in type 2 diabetes mellitus older adults (1) attenuates the COVID-19 domiciliary confinement-related increase in sitting time and (2) slightly decreases the self-reported levels of disability and maintains HRQoL.","Brazo-Sayavera, Javier; López-Torres, Olga; Martos-Bermúdez, Álvaro; Rodriguez-Garcia, Lorena; González-Gross, Marcela; Guadalupe-Grau, Amelia",Journal of physical activity & health,80,5

Bacteriophage λ has proven effective in immune challenge models using both immunization methods, but there has never been a direct comparison of efficacy and of the quality of immune response. In the current study, this vector was produced using a combination of cis and trans phage display. When antibody titers were measured from immunized animals together with IL-2, IL-4 and IFNγ production from splenocytes in vitro, we found that proteins displayed on λ were superior at eliciting an immune response in comparison to genetic immunization with λ. We also found that the antibodies produced in response to immunization with λ displayed proteins bound more epitopes than those produced in response to genetic immunization. Finally, the general immune response to λ inoculation, whether peptide or genetic, was dominated by a Th1 response, as determined by IFNγ and IL-4 concentration, or by a higher concentration of IgG2a antibodies.","Thomas, Brad S; Nishikawa, Sandra; Ito, Kenichi; Chopra, Puja; Sharma, Navneet; Evans, David H; Tyrrell, D Lorne J; Bathe, Oliver F; Rancourt, Derrick E",Vaccine,80,31

However, it is time-consuming and costly given that cells or animals are employed for activity confirmation, which leads to a large amount of waste being produced if the result is negative. Stepwise frontal analysis is employed to saturate the affinity stationary phase, by using a series of low- to high-concentration solutions which resultantly form a staircase pattern. In doing so, the waste of samples, caused by the balancing process, can be avoided. In this study, stepwise frontal analysis coupled with a CMC system was performed for screening and characterizing the affinity of an active compound from wuweizi. Schizandrin A was screened and identified by α1A AR /CMC coupled with UHPLC-MS/MS. By comparing the values obtained with those related to the equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) calculated by zonal elution, the accuracy of the stepwise frontal analysis was verified. Subsequently, the type of affinity force between Schizandrin A and α1A AR was studied by thermodynamic parameters. Moreover, schizandrin A showed an antagonistic effect on phenylephrine-induced contractions, which relax prostate muscle strips in a non-competitive antagonism manner. It has already suggested that the active compound, schizandrin A, could be used as a lead compound for the treatment of benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) and should be further studied. Thus, the findings of this study are significant given that they could result in an online screening and affinity analysis method being utilized for the discovery of medicinal compounds as well as clarify the interaction characteristics between a drug and a receptor.","Wei, Fen; He, Xiaoshuang; Xu, Ke; Wang, Sicen","Journal of chromatography.

Objective To document the published programmatic and curricular attempts to decrease the incidence of mistreatment. Data Sources PubMed, Scopus, ERIC, the Cochrane Library, PsycINFO, and MedEdPORTAL were searched. Comprehensive searches were run on ""mistreatment"" and ""abuse of medical trainees"" on all peer-reviewed publications until November 1, 2017. Study Selection Citations were reviewed for descriptions of programs to decrease the incidence of mistreatment in a medical school or hospital with program evaluation data. A mistreatment program was defined as an educational effort to reduce the abuse, mistreatment, harassment, or discrimination of trainees. Studies of the incidence of mistreatment without description of a program, references to a mistreatment program without outcome data, or a program that has never been implemented were excluded. Data Extraction and Synthesis Authors independently reviewed all retrieved citations. Articles that any author found to meet inclusion criteria were included in a full-text review. The data extraction form was developed based on the guidelines for Best Evidence in Medical Education. An assessment of the study quality was conducted using a conceptual framework of 6 elements essential to the reporting of experimental studies in medical education. Main Outcomes and Measures A descriptive review of the interventions and outcomes is presented along with an analysis of the methodological quality of the studies. A separate review of the MedEdPORTAL mistreatment curricula was conducted. Results Of 3347 citations identified, 10 studies met inclusion criteria. Of the programs included in the 10 studies, all were implemented in academic medical centers. Seven programs were in the United States, 1 in Canada, 1 in the United Kingdom, and 1 in Australia. The most common format was a combination of lectures, workshops, and seminars over a variable time period. Overall, quality of included studies was low and only 1 study included a conceptual framework. Outcomes were most often limited to participant survey data. The program outcome evaluations consisted primarily of surveys and reports of mistreatment. All of the included studies evaluated participant satisfaction, which was mostly qualitative. Seven studies also included the frequency of mistreatment reports; either surveys to assess perception of the frequency of mistreatment or the frequency of reports via official reporting channels. Five mistreatment program curricula from MedEdPORTAL were also identified; of these, only 2 presented outcome data. Conclusions and Relevance There are very few published programs attempting to address mistreatment of medical trainees. This review identifies a gap in the literature and provides advice for reporting on mistreatment programs.","Mazer, Laura M; Bereknyei Merrell, Sylvia; Hasty, Brittany N; Stave, Christopher; Lau, James N",JAMA network open,80,15

We assessed the effect of neuromuscular blockade on postoperative sore throat and hoarseness following tracheal intubation in patients undergoing lumbar spinal surgery in the prone position. Altogether, 99 patients were included; 50 patients did not receive neuromuscular blockade, and 49 patients received moderate neuromuscular blockade during the maintenance of anesthesia. Neuromuscular blockade was performed depending on the use of intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring. The number of intubation attempts, time to achieve tracheal intubation, and duration of intubation were recorded accordingly. The incidence and severity of postoperative sore throat and hoarseness was assessed at 1, 6, and 24 h after surgery. The overall cumulative incidence of postoperative sore throat (60% vs. 59%, respectively; P = 1.000) and postoperative hoarseness (68% vs. 61%, respectively; P = 0.532) did not differ between the no neuromuscular blockade and moderate neuromuscular blockade. The incidence and severity of postoperative sore throat and hoarseness was also not different between the moderate and no neuromuscular blockade at each time point after surgery. Nevertheless, the incidences of postoperative sore throat and hoarseness were quite high.

MATERIAL AND METHODS From October 2010 to November 2010, 10 consecutive, left TPLDNs were performed. The SILS Port was inserted through the umbilicus and was used for 5-mm laparoscope and laparoscopic instruments. A 12-mm trocar, for another working channel, was inserted along the midclavicular line at the umbilicus level. No articulating or bent laparoscopic instruments were needed. Two retraction sutures were used; a 3-0 Prolene suture was passed through the pericolic fat and then brought out of the abdominal wall and secured to the skin. Another suture was passed around the lower pole fat of the kidney, which was then fixed on the abdominal wall with a clamp. RESULTS TPLDN was performed successfully in all patients, with no conversions to a conventional laparoscopic procedure or additional trocar insertion needed. The mean operative time was 152 ± 16.3 minutes, and the mean warm ischemia time was 2.9 ± 0.9. The average estimated blood loss was 77.3 ± 70 mL, and the postoperative hospital stay was 3.6 ± 0.6 days. No perioperative or postoperative complications were observed. Cosmesis was excellent, with a mean incision length of 5.6 ± 0.4 cm. All allografts functioned after transplantation. CONCLUSION Our initial experience suggests that TPLDN appears safe and cosmetically effective and a feasible option for donor nephrectomy. The appropriate use of retraction sutures, during TPLDN, helps to overcome the technical problems associated with the inadequate retraction and exposure.","Cho, Hyuk Jin; Choi, Yong Sun; Bae, Woong Jin; Bae, Jang Ho; Hong, Sung-Hoo; Lee, Ji Youl; Kim, Sae Woong; Hwang, Tae-Kon; Cho, Yong-Hyun",Urology,80,31

Because of important clinical consequences of inappropriate treatment, a current review of the potential modifications undergone by S. aureus and adaptation to new treatment options is necessary. RECENT FINDINGS Vancomycin has been considered the treatment of choice for pneumonia due to MRSA. However, detection of a progressive increase in the minimum inhibitory concentration for this antibiotic, its limited access to the lung parenchyma, and its considerable adverse effects have called into question its position. Linezolid has been shown to have a better pharmacokinetic and safety profiles. The prior uncertainty regarding the clinical superiority of linezolid appears to have been resolved with the publication of a recent trial. Linezolid achieved a higher clinical and microbiological response rate (the latter was not statistically significant), together with a lower incidence of all types of renal adverse effects in patients with nosocomial pneumonia, compared with vancomycin. Tigecycline, teicoplanin and quinupristin/dalfopristin were inferior to the compared drug in their respective clinical trials. The clinical efficacy of telavancin was similar to that of vancomycin. The renal adverse effects of telavancin have to be clarified. Other drugs are efficacious against MRSA but their profile should be evaluated in nosocomial pneumonia. SUMMARY Current therapeutic alternatives for nosocomial pneumonia due to MRSA appear to be limited to vancomycin and linezolid. However, vancomycin pitfalls, together with the apparent clinical superiority of linezolid, appear to restrict its indication. Telavancin could be a good alternative in patients without basal renal failure.","Ramirez, Paula; Fernández-Barat, Laia; Torres, Antonio",Current opinion in infectious diseases,80,20

However, sEMG recordings from a target muscle may contain cross-talk originating from nearby muscles, which could lead to erroneous force estimates. Here we used ultrasound imaging to measure in vivo muscle fascicle length (Lf) changes and sEMG to measure muscle activity of the tibialis anterior, medial gastrocnemius, lateral gastrocnemius, and soleus muscles during ramp MVICs in plantar and dorsiflexion directions (n = 8). After correcting longitudinal Lf changes for ankle rotation, the antagonist Lf at peak antagonist root-mean-square (RMS) amplitude were significantly longer than the agonist Lf at this sEMG-matched level. On average, Lf shortened from resting length by 1.29 to 2.90 mm when muscles acted as agonists and lengthened from resting length by 0.43 to 1.16 mm when muscles acted as antagonists (depending on the muscle of interest). The lack of fascicle shortening when muscles acted as antagonists indicates that cocontraction was likely to be negligible, despite cocontraction as determined by sEMG of between 7 and 23% MVIC across all muscles. Different interelectrode distances (IEDs) over the plantar flexors revealed significantly higher antagonist RMS amplitudes for the 4-cm IEDs compared with the 2-cm IEDs, which further indicates that cross-talk was present. Consequently, investigators should be wary about performing agonist torque corrections for isometric plantar flexion and dorsiflexion based on the antagonist sEMG trace and predicted antagonist moment.","Raiteri, Brent J; Cresswell, Andrew G; Lichtwark, Glen A",Journal of applied physiology,80,30

RECENT FINDINGS Patients with asthma are neither at greater risk of becoming infected by SARS-CoV-2 nor they are at risk of complications of COVID-19 but those requiring frequent use of oral corticosteroid may be at greater risk. SUMMARY In general, patients with asthma are not at risk of COVID-19 morbidity or mortality. On the contrary, patients with asthma may be at lower risk of hospitalizations during the COVID-19 pandemic. This may be related to asthma and its treatment, to patient's behavior, to the health system, and to collective changes in activities. It is likely that reduction in respiratory infections because of social distancing, face masks, and hand washing have a role in the reduction in asthma hospitalizations. Management of asthma in times of COVID-19 must be optimized, medication have to be used regularly and exacerbations detected early. Systemic corticosteroids may be used for control of severe asthma or severe exacerbations. Patient education on an action plan is crucial, as well as facilitating communications with the healthcare team.","Franco, Priscila A; Jezler, Sergio; Cruz, Alvaro A",Current opinion in allergy and clinical immunology,80,24

(Hippocastanaceae) seed extract (AH), inhibits NF-κB activation, which plays an important role in HSV-1 replication. The aim was to examine the antiherpetic activity of β-escin and AH, as well as their effect on the activation of NF-κB and AP-1 and cytokine secretion in epithelial cells and macrophages. METHODS Cell viability was evaluated using MTT assay, and antiviral and virucidal activity was determined by plaque assay. The effect on NF-κB and AP-1 signalling pathways activation was determined by a luciferase reporter assay, and cytokine production was measured by ELISA. KEY FINDINGS β-Escin and AH had virucidal and anti-HSV-1 activities, and the antiviral activity was discovered for other enveloped viruses (VSV and Dengue). Moreover, β-escin and AH significantly reduced NF-κB and AP-1 activation and cytokine production in macrophages stimulated with HSV-1 and TLRs ligands. However, an enhanced activation of these pathways and an increase in the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in β-escin and AH-treated HSV-1-infected epithelial cells were found. CONCLUSIONS This study demonstrates virucidal and broad-spectrum antiviral activities for β escin and AH. Besides, β-escin and AH modulate cytokine production depending on the stimuli (viral or non-viral) and the cell type under study.","Michelini, Flavia M; Alché, Laura E; Bueno, Carlos A",The Journal of pharmacy and pharmacology,80,17

Although various reconstruction methods have been reported, a standard technique has not yet been established. In this study, we compared the short-term outcomes of LATG reconstructed by mini-laparotomy and by the newly developed transorally inserted anvil (OrVil). METHODS From April 2006, a series of 45 patients underwent LATG. Of these, 15 were reconstructed by mini-laparotomy and 30 by OrVil. Short-term outcomes were compared between the two groups. RESULTS Operation time was significantly shortened and intraoperative blood loss significantly reduced by the use of OrVil. The postoperative course, including morbidity, did not differ between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS LATG using OrVil for the treatment of early gastric cancer is a technically feasible surgical procedure with sufficient lymph node dissection, satisfactory early recovery, and acceptable morbidity. It will be necessary to perform this novel technique in a large number of patients to confirm its feasibility.","Kunisaki, Chikara; Makino, Hirochika; Oshima, Takashi; Fujii, Shoichi; Kimura, Jun; Takagawa, Ryo; Kosaka, Takashi; Akiyama, Hirotoshi; Morita, Satoshi; Endo, Itaru",Surgical endoscopy,80,5

METHOD Participants were parents of children aged 4 to 13 years (n = 45, mean 7.5, SD: 2.6) who participated in the Baltimore Generations Study before the pandemic. They reported on their child's self-regulation (SR) using the Parent Observation of Child Adaptation. During the pandemic, they were recontacted to report on child SR, disruptions to family life (Coronavirus Impact Scale), and parenting stress (Parenting Stress Index). Prepandemic to pandemic changes in SR were compared with repeated measures analysis of variance. RESULTS There were significant decreases in child SR (poorer concentration, attention, task engagement and persistence, and greater impulsivity) prepandemic to pandemic. During the pandemic, parenting stress was correlated with lower child SR (r range = -0.52 to -0.34, p < 0.05). Pandemic-related family disruptions were associated with changes in children's impulsivity (F [1, 42] = 5.28, p = 0.03); children with 4 or more disruptions (67%) showed less ability to wait their turn during the pandemic compared with prepandemic (M [SD] = 3.34 [0.93] vs. 4.41 [1.21], t [28] = 3.93, p < 0.001). There was no change in SR for children with fewer than 4 disruptions. CONCLUSION Results highlight modest pandemic-associated decreases in child attention, task persistence, and task engagement alongside increases in impulsivity. We did not find evidence of broad or severe impacts; however, children whose families have been disproportionately affected by the pandemic may need focused support in school and at home to avoid widening prepandemic health and educational disparities.","Raghunathan, Radhika S; Musci, Rashelle J; Voegtline, Kristin M; Chambers Thomas, Tracey; Johnson, Sara B",Journal of developmental and behavioral pediatrics : JDBP,80,8

METHODS This research was conducted as part of a larger study on childhood immunisations in Hong Kong. In-depth interviews were conducted with a subsample of parents (n = 15) to further explore general perceptions and health beliefs about childhood immunisations. Interview data were analysed using content analysis techniques. RESULTS Three core themes emerged from the data: individual influences factors, family and social factors, and system factors. [Correction added after online publication 21/8/08: sentence corrected from ""Four core themes emerged from the data: individual influences, family influences and system influences.""] Parents readily admitted knowledge deficits concerning childhood vaccines but believed that the benefits of immunisation outweighed the risks. Family members and peers were a source of pro-immunisation advice and comprehensive public health programmes and mandatory vaccination requirements for school entry ensured that childhood immunisation recommendations were followed. CONCLUSIONS Overall, Hong Kong parents are highly supportive of immunisation programmes and insight gained from this study could prove helpful to providers trying to improve uptake rates among other populations.","Tarrant, Marie; Thomson, Neil",Journal of paediatrics and child health,80,1

This situation offered the opportunity to investigate the occupational COVID-19 risk to dental staff in public non-hospital dental units. METHODS An infection-control protocol was designed for dental healthcare in the Territorial Health and Social Services Authority (ASST) ""Melegnano and Martesana"" (Milan). Since specific guidance from central authorities was lacking, information was gathered from international public health organizations. The probability to visit asymptomatic COVID-19 patients was estimated and the occupational risk to dental staff calculated. RESULTS The probability to visit asymptomatic patients passed from 1.2% (95% confidence interval -95CI, 0.6-2.5%) in the first period (20 February-15 March 2020) to 11.1% (95CI, 5.8-23.6%) in the second period (16 March-30 April). Dentists and dental assistants did not develop COVID-19, while one nurse did, the nature of her occupational risk was unclear, as nurses provided prevalently non-dental healthcare. The probabilities of developing COVID-19 per worked hour per person excluding and including this uncertain situation were 0.0% (95CI, 0.0-3.2%), and 0.9% (95CI, 0.1-4.7%).

Its objective assessment at initial patient contact in primary care can lead to better adjusted and timely care with personalised treatment and recovery. To enable this, we designed the Mindmore self-administrative cognitive screening battery. What is presented here is normative data for the Mindmore battery for the Swedish population. METHOD A total of 720 healthy adults (17 to 93 years) completed the Mindmore screening battery, which consists of 14 individual tests across five cognitive domains: attention and processing speed, memory, language, visuospatial functions and executive functions. Regression-based normative data were established for 42 test result measures, investigating linear, non-linear and interaction effects between age, education and sex. RESULTS The test results were most affected by age and to a lesser extent by education and sex. All but one test displayed either linear or accelerated age-related decline, or a U-shaped association with age. All but two tests showed beneficial effects of education, either linear or subsiding after 12 years of educational attainment. Sex affected tests in the memory and executive domains. In three tests, an interaction between age and education revealed an increased benefit of education later in life. CONCLUSION This study provides normative models for 14 traditional cognitive tests adapted for self-administration through a digital platform. The models will enable more accurate interpretation of test results, hopefully leading to improved clinical decision making and better care for patients with cognitive impairment.","van den Hurk, Wobbie; Bergman, Ingvar; Machado, Alejandra; Bjermo, Jonas; Gustavsson, Anders",Journal of the International Neuropsychological Society : JINS,80,24

AIM The aim of this study was to assess the effect of unintended intraoperative tumor perforation on postoperative mortality and long-term survival. MATERIAL AND METHODS This national cohort study was based on data from a prospectively maintained nationwide colorectal cancer database. We included 16,517 colon cancer patients who were resected with curative intent from 2001 to 2012. RESULTS Intraoperative tumor perforation produced a significantly impaired 5-year survival of 40% compared to 64% in non-perforated colon cancer. Intraoperative tumor perforation was an independent risk factor for death, hazard ratio 1.63 (95% confidence interval: 1.4-1.94), with a significantly increased 90-day postoperative mortality of 17% compared to 7% in non-perforated tumors, p < 0.001. We showed that tumor fixation, emergency operations, and laparotomies were associated with an increased risk of intraoperative tumor perforation. CONCLUSION This nationwide study demonstrates that intraoperative tumor perforation in colon cancer is associated with statistically significant reduced long-term survival and increased postoperative mortality.","Bundgaard, N S; Bendtsen, V O; Ingeholm, P; Seidelin, U H; Jensen, K H",Scandinavian journal of surgery : SJS : official organ for the Finnish Surgical Society and the Scandinavian Surgical Society,80,4

This systematic review evaluates the benefits and harms of early head-up mobilisation versus standard care in patients with severe acquired brain injury. METHODS We searched Medline, CENTRAL, EMBASE, four other databases and 13 selected clinical trial registries until April 2020. Eligible randomised clinical trials compared early head-up mobilisation versus standard care in patients with severe acquired brain injury and were analysed conducting random- and fixed-effects meta-analyses and Trial Sequential Analysis (TSA). Certainty of evidence was assessed by GRADE. MAIN RESULTS We identified four randomised clinical trials (total n = 385 patients) with severe acquired brain injury (stroke 86% and traumatic brain injury 13%). Two trials were at low risk and two at high risk of bias. We found no evidence of a difference between early mobilisation vs. standard care on mortality or poor functional outcome at end of the intervention (relative risk (RR) 1.19, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.53; I2 0%; very low certainty) or at maximal follow-up (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.21; I2 0%; very low certainty). We found evidence against an effect on quality of life at maximal follow-up. The proportion of patients with at least one serious adverse event did not differ at end of intervention or at maximal follow-up. For most comparisons, TSA suggested that further trials are needed. CONCLUSIONS We found no evidence of a difference between early mobilisation versus standard care for patients with severe acquired brain injury. Early mobilisation appeared not to exert a major impact on quality of life. This systematic review highlights the insufficient evidence in patients with severe brain injury, and no firm conclusions can be drawn from these data.

Due to lack of evidence on contamination, pre-set surgical goods are sometimes disposed of or re-sterilized, thus increasing costs, resource use, and environmental effects. AIM To investigate time-dependent bacterial air contamination of covered and uncovered sterile goods in the operating room. METHODS Blood agar plates (n=1584) were used to detect bacterial air contamination of sterile fields on 48 occasions. Each time, three aerobe and three anaerobe plates were used as baseline to model the preparation time, and 60 (30 aerobe, 30 anaerobe) were used to model the time pending before operation; half of these were covered with sterile drapes and half remained uncovered. Plates were collected after 4, 8, 12, 16, and 24 hours. FINDINGS Mean time before contamination was 2.8 hours (95% CI: 2.1-3.4) in the uncovered group and 3.8 hours (95% CI: 3.2-4.4) in the covered group (P=0.005). The uncovered group had 98 colony-forming units (CFUs) versus 20 in the covered group (P=0.0001). Sixteen different microorganisms were isolated, the most common being Cutibacterium acnes followed by Micrococcus luteus. Of 32 Staphylococcus CFUs, 14 were antibiotic-resistant, including one multidrug-resistant S. epidermidis. CONCLUSION Protecting sterile fields from bacterial air contamination with sterile covers enhances the durability of sterile goods up to 24 hours. Prolonged durability of sterile goods might benefit patient safety, since surgical sterile material could be prepared in advance for acute surgery, thereby enhancing quality of care and reducing both climate impact and costs.","Wistrand, Camilla; Söderquist, Bo; Sundqvist, Ann-Sofie",The Journal of hospital infection,80,1

A single 3 cm incision was made caudal to the umbilicus and the SILS Port device was bluntly introduced. Three cannulae were inserted in the SILS Port through the access channels. In the first 20 cases, a transabdominal suspension suture was used to transfix the ovaries. In all cases, ovariectomy was performed using a standard straight non-roticulated laparoscopic grasper and a vessel sealer/divider device. Mean (sd) duration of the ovarian resection was 25.1 (6.1) minutes (range 16 to 39 minutes). In five dogs (with transabdominal suspension suture), minor bleeding in the mesovarium or in the spleen was observed. Since the SILS Port allows simultaneous use of two instruments and a telescope through a single incision, the suspension suture is not mandatory. The lack of a transabdominal suspension suture increased collision between instruments and the telescope, but triangulation capabilities remained sufficient to achieve visualisation, sufficient manoeuvrability and safe vessel sealer/divider device application. The time to perform ovarian resection remained unaltered with or without suspension suture and regardless of the fat score of the ovarian ligament. Complications were less frequent without a suspension suture.","Manassero, M; Leperlier, D; Vallefuoco, R; Viateau, V",The Veterinary record,80,31

In vivo studies were based on Sphk1-/- and matched wild type (WT) neonatal mice exposed to HO while treated with PF543, an inhibitor of SPHK1. In vitro mechanistic studies used human lung microvascular endothelial cells (HLMVECs). RESULTS Both SPHK1 and LOX expressions were increased in lungs of patients with BPD. Tracheal aspirates from patients with BPD had increased LOX, correlating with sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) levels. HO-induced increase of LOX in lungs were attenuated in both Sphk1-/- and PF543-treated WT mice, accompanied by reduced collagen staining (sirius red). PF543 reduced LOX activity in both bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and supernatant of HLMVECs following HO. In silico analysis revealed STAT3 as a potential transcriptional regulator of LOX. In HLMVECs, following HO, ChIP assay confirmed increased STAT3 binding to LOX promoter. SPHK1 inhibition reduced phosphorylation of STAT3. Antibody to S1P and siRNA against SPNS2, S1P receptor 1 (S1P1) and STAT3 reduced LOX expression. CONCLUSION HO-induced SPHK1/S1P signalling axis plays a critical role in transcriptional regulation of LOX expression via SPNS2, S1P1 and STAT3 in lung endothelium.","Ha, Alison W; Bai, Tao; Ebenezer, David L; Sethi, Tanvi; Sudhadevi, Tara; Mangio, Lizar Ace; Garzon, Steven; Pryhuber, Gloria S; Natarajan, Viswanathan; Harijith, Anantha",Thorax,80,1

The titration displacement of fluorescein was used to calculate the apparent complexation constant (KF) between CD-NS and OXY. Moreover, PDE4 was expressed in E.coli, purified and refolded in presence of cyclodextrins (CDs) to study its possible inhibition as pharmacological target of OXY. The apparent activity was characterized and the inhibitory effect of OXY on PDE4 displayed a competitive in vitro inhibition corroborated in silico. A maximum increase of the in vivo life expectancy of about 9.6% of using OXY/CD-NS complexes in comparison with the control was obtained, in contrast to the 6.5 % obtained with free OXY. No effect on lifespan or toxicity with CD-NS alone was found. These results as a whole represent new opportunities to use OXY and CD-NS in lifespan products.","Matencio, Adrián; Alejandra Guerrero-Rubio, M; Caldera, Fabrizio; Cecone, Claudio; Trotta, Francesco; García-Carmona, Francisco; Manuel López-Nicolás, José",International journal of pharmaceutics,80,1

METHODS One hundred sixty-six single-port video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (SP-VATS) lobectomy and 162 two-port video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (TP-VATS) lobectomy had been successfully completed between August 2015 and September 2016. A single incision of ∼3 cm was made in an intercostal space along the anterior axillary line. Perioperative outcomes and the safety between SP-VATS and TP-VATS lobectomy for NSCLC was compared. RESULTS In the SP-VATS group, incision size was kept to a minimum, with a median of 3 cm; mediastinal lymph node dissection was performed in all patients with malignancy. Overall, median operative time was 89 minutes, and median chest tube duration was 3.1 days. The VAS on postoperative days 3, 7, and 14 was less in the SP-VATS group than that in the TP-VATS group. The VAS on days 1, 30, 60, 90, 180, and 360 did not differ significantly between the two groups. The number of days of use of analgesic agents after surgery was less in the SP-VATS group. The pathological symptoms of wound pain were significantly less in the SP-VATS group. CONCLUSIONS Compared with the multiport approach, SP VATS lobectomy might reduce postoperative pain and lead to faster recovery.","Liu, Zhengcheng; Yang, Rusong; Shao, Feng",The Thoracic and cardiovascular surgeon,80,1

These amplicons represent highly variable regions with information-rich sequences, which are flanked by broad-range primers designed based on highly conserved loci. This technology was first introduced in 2005 for microbial identification and subtyping, and was later applied to influenza virus detection and identification. The influenza RT-PCR/ESI-MS assay allows analysis of approximately 300 samples per 24 h, and aids in the characterization of influenza viruses based on their 'core' gene signatures. Notably, this assay was used to identify one of the first cases of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic viruses. One of the main advantages of the RT-PCR/ESI-MS technology is its universality and adaptability for pathogen characterization. Efforts are being made to customize the currently used influenza surveillance assay for use in the diagnosis of the H1N1 pandemic virus. In this article, we provide a summary of known applications of the RT-PCR/ESI-MS assay in the field of influenza.","Deyde, Varough M; Sampath, Rangarajan; Gubareva, Larisa V",Expert review of molecular diagnostics,80,17

However, BMI does not predict diabetes remission, and thus, predictors need to be identified. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Seven hundred twenty-seven patients were included in a database merged from the Swedish Obese Subjects (SOS) study and two randomized controlled studies, with 415 surgical and 312 medical patients in total. Bariatric operations were divided into gastric only (GO) and gastric plus diversion (GD). RESULTS Sixty-four percent of patients in the surgical arm and 15.0% in the medical arm experienced diabetes remission (P < 0.001). GO yielded 60% remission, and GD yielded 76% remission. The best predictors of diabetes remission were lower baseline glycemia and shorter diabetes duration. However, when operation type was considered, GD predicted a higher likelihood of remission and greater weight loss. Patients in remission (responders) lost more weight (25% vs. 17%) and waist circumference (18% vs. 13%) and experienced better insulin sensitivity than nonresponders. CONCLUSIONS Surgery is more effective than medical treatment in achieving diabetes remission and tighter glycemic control. Shorter diabetes duration, lower fasting glycemia before surgery, and GD versus GO procedures independently predict higher rates of remission, whereas baseline HbA1c and waist circumference predict improved glycemic control. The results show the advantage of an early operation together with better controlled glycemia on diabetes remission independently of BMI.","Panunzi, Simona; Carlsson, Lena; De Gaetano, Andrea; Peltonen, Markku; Rice, Toni; Sjöström, Lars; Mingrone, Geltrude; Dixon, John B",Diabetes care,80,7

They are particularly important for crisis-affected populations that typically reside in settings characterised by overcrowding, inadequate access to healthcare and resource limitations. To describe the landscape of research and identify evidence gaps concerning the acceptability, feasibility, and effectiveness of NPIs among crisis-affected populations and informal settings, we conducted a systematic scoping review of the published evidence. Methods We systematically reviewed peer-reviewed articles published between 1970 and 2020 to collate available evidence on the feasibility, acceptability, and effectiveness of NPIs in crisis-affected populations and informal settlements. We performed quality assessments of each study using a standardised questionnaire. Results Our review included 158 studies published in 85 peer-reviewed articles. Most research used low quality study designs. The acceptability, feasibility, and effectiveness of NPIs was highly context dependent. In general, simple and cost-effective interventions such as community-level environmental cleaning and provision of water, sanitation and hygiene services, and distribution of items for personal protection such as insecticide-treated nets, were both highly feasible and acceptable. Logistical, financial, and human resource constraints affected both the implementation and sustainability of measures. Community engagement emerged as a strong factor contributing to the effectiveness of NPIs. Conversely, measures that involve potential restriction on personal liberty such as case isolation were found to be less acceptable to the community. Conclusion Overall, the evidence base was patchy, with substantial knowledge gaps between differing between settings and pathogens. Although implementation of NPIs presents unique practical challenges, it is critical that the lessons learned are shared with the wider community to build a robust evidence base.","Polonsky, J.

The entire curriculum can be run as a single block or can be spread out over multiple days. Introduction: The Accreditation Council of Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) and the Liaison Committee on Medical Education (LCME) both require residents to receive training in teaching medical students and junior residents. They also require opportunities for residents to participate in teaching and be assessed on their effectiveness in this role.1,2 However, the ACGME does not provide guidance or require formal curricula on molding residents into effective teachers. Many programs and institutions have incorporated RAT curricula as a solution to provide residents with the skills necessary to create an excellent educational environment for junior learners. These curricula have been embraced by many specialties, including Emergency Medicine (EM).3-6 The effectiveness of the teaching received during the clinical rotations has important long-term effects on medical students, and may impact their future career choices in medicine.6The COVID-19 pandemic has also required education institutions to vastly alter the delivery of their didactics, including moving to a virtual platform. A completely online format has many benefits that extend beyond the pandemic, such as easier access to participants (including those off-service or at remote sites), no requirement for a physical space, and easier recording of sessions.Educational Goals: To provide residents with an introduction to teaching techniques that can be utilized on shift to facilitate an excellent educational experience for junior learners while balancing the resident’s patient care responsibilities.Educational Methods: The educational strategies used in this curriculum include PowerPoint (Redmond, WA) slideshows given by a live presenter via the telecommunications platform Zoom (San Jose, CA), viewing of videos demonstrating curriculum topics, simulation-based learning through role-play, and small-group discussions including simulation debriefing.Research Methods: A survey was distributed to residents before and following the completion of the three training sessions to assess resident satisfaction with the delivery of the content and comfort with the teaching tools discussed. Suggestions on potential improvements were also assessed to inform changes to future iterations of the curriculum. Comfort regarding the included teaching tools was assessed using a five-point Likert scale. After completion of the curriculum, rotating medical students were provided with an evaluation form to assess if residents were teaching using the techniques from the course.Results: Both the pre-curriculum and post-curriculum surveys had a response rate of 61.1%. Student’s t-test showed a statistically significant increase in mean resident comfort level with the teaching strategies postcurriculum (3.05 to 3.83, p < 0.01). Medical student evaluations have shown, overall, that the majority of residents are utilizing the education techniques on-shift. There were no significant differences found in medical student perception of resident use of taught skills between those who had and had not attended the sessions. However, all but one assessed skill showed higher utilization in those who had attended the correlating session.Discussion: The educational content was effective in improving the residents’ comfort with the teaching strategies presented, and residents are utilizing these techniques on-shift. Through implementation, we discovered that presenting a curriculum over video conferencing required additional administrative support to help ensure efficacy of break-out groups. Based on resident feedback after the first session, multiple changes were made, including providing residents with hand-out references for use during the role-playing sessions. The success of this curriculum demonstrated th feasibility and utility of running a RAT curriculum entirely in a virtual format.","Burke, Shannon Schmitt Thaddeus Jewell Corlin Schnapp Benjamin",Journal of Education & Teaching in Emergency Medicine,80,16

METHODS All clinical records of probable SARS patients in Beijing were collected and input into an Epi6 database, in which 1 291 patients had entire information and met the clinical criteria of SARS. The usage of GCS and GCS associated side effects were analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS Patients accepted GCS therapy were 83.96% (n=1 084), whereas 16.04%(n=207) did not take GCS. The average dosage of GCS was 160 mg/d in the first week, and then reduced to 80 mg/d and 40 mg/d in the second and the third weeks, respectively. Initial blood glucose, systolic pressure (SBP), and diastolic pressure (DBP) were no significant difference between GCS group and non-GCS group. The highest blood glucose during the treatment in GCS group was markedly higher than that in non-GCS group [(8.68+/-4.80) mmol/L vs (6.39+/-3.71) mmol/L, P<0.05)]. The highest blood glucose and average blood glucose after initiation of GCS therapy were elevated in GCS group. The levels of blood glucose were correlated with the initial, maximum, and cumulative GCS dosages. Average blood glucose was increased markedly in groups with MP(Initial) > or =80 mg/d (Methyprednisonlone), MP(Maximal) > or =160 mg/d, or MP(Cumulative) > or = 3000 mg. The blood glucose grew up significantly in the first and the second weeks in the treatment with GCS, and then returned to normal level gradually. Hyperglycemia duration in the group with MP(Cumulative) > or =3000 mg persisted longer than that in the other groups (P< 0.05). The lowest serum potassium during the treatment and the duration of hypokalemia in GCS group were significantly different from that in non-GCS group [(3.66+/-0.50) mmol/L vs (4.01+/-0.51) mmol/L, P< 0.001 ;1(1, 75) days vs 1(1, 9) days, P<0.05, respectively]. Average serum potassium and the duration of hypokalemia were related to the dosages of GCS. Serum potassium reached its nadir in the first week of GCS treatment and then grew up in the second week. In groups with MP(Initial) > or =320 mg/d, MP(Maximal) > or =320 mg/d, and MP(Cumulative) > or =3000 mg, the level of serum potassium was lower and the duration of hypokalemia was longer than that in other groups. They began to returned to normal level in the third week. Administration of GCS prolonged the time of hypocalcemia[19 (1, 74) days in GCS group vs 8 (1, 32) days in non-GCS group, P< 0.05]. The duration of hypocalcemia was prolonged according to the increasing of the maximal or the cumulative dosage of GCS. However, the duration of hypocalcemia in group with MP(Cumulative) <999 mg was similar to that in non-GCS group (P > 0.05). After GCS administration, SBP and DBP were increased gradually, and reached their peaks in the fourth week [SBP(117.2+/-14.0) mm Hg and DBP (72.5+/-9.1) mm Hg vs SBP (120.0+/-12.5) mm Hg and DBP (74.5+/-8.7) mm Hg, P< 0.05, 1 mm Hg=0.133 kPa]. CONCLUSION Hyperglycemia and hypokalemia are correlated with GCS dosage and duration. Administration with GCS influences SBP, DBP, and duration of hypocalcemia. Appropriate low dosage of GCS (MP(Initial) and MP(Maximal) < 159 mg/d, MP(Cumulative)< 2999 mg) causes few changes of blood glucose, serum potassium, and blood calcium. It is important to monitor laboratory findings during the treatment with GCS.","Li, Nan; Wang, Guang-fa; Wu, Yang-feng; Xie, Gao-qiang; Xiao, Feng; Chen, Bo-wen; Wang, Yue-xiang; Han, De-min",Beijing da xue xue bao.

We show here that monocyte-derived DCs form syncytia and are infected upon coculture with HTLV-1-infected lymphocytes. We examined the role of DC-specific ICAM-3-grabbing nonintegrin (DC-SIGN), a C-type lectin expressed in DCs, in HTLV-1-induced syncytium formation. DC-SIGN is known to bind with high affinity to various viral envelope glycoproteins, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus, as well as to the cellular receptors ICAM-2 and ICAM-3. After cocultivating DCs and HTLV-1-infected cells, we found that anti-DC-SIGN monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) were able to decrease the number and size of HTLV-1-induced syncytia. Moreover, expression of the lectin in epithelial-cell lines dramatically enhanced the ability to fuse with HTLV-1-positive cells. Interestingly, in contrast to the envelope (Env) glycoproteins of HIV and other viruses, that of HTLV-1 does not bind directly to DC-SIGN. The facilitating role of the lectin in HTLV-1 syncytium formation is mediated by its interaction with ICAM-2 and ICAM-3, as demonstrated by use of MAbs directed against these adhesion molecules. Altogether, our results indicate that DC-SIGN facilitates HTLV-1 infection and fusion of DCs through an ICAM-dependent mechanism.","Ceccaldi, Pierre-Emmanuel; Delebecque, Frédéric; Prevost, Marie-Christine; Moris, Arnaud; Abastado, Jean-Pierre; Gessain, Antoine; Schwartz, Olivier; Ozden, Simona",Journal of virology,80,20

Here we review recent accomplishments in vaccine research using recombinant modified vaccinia virus ankara (MVA). MVA is a highly attenuated vaccinia virus strain that originated from serial tissue culture passage in chicken embryo fibroblasts more than 40 years ago. Growth adaptation to avian host cells caused deletions and mutations in the viral genome affecting about 15% of the original genetic information. In consequence, MVA is replication-deficient in cells of mammalian origin and fails to produce many of the virulence factors encoded by conventional vaccinia virus. Because of its safety for the general environment MVA can be handled under conditions of biosafety level one. Non-replicating MVA can enter any target cell and activate its molecular life cycle to express all classes of viral and recombinant genes. Therefore, recombinant MVA have been established as an extremely safe and efficient vector system for vaccine development in medical research. By now, various recombinant MVA vaccines have been found safe and immunogenic when used for phase I/II clinical testing in humans, and suitable for industrial scale production following good practice of manufacturing. Thus, there is an obvious usefulness of recombinant MVA vaccines for novel prophylactic and therapeutic approaches also in veterinary medicine. Results from first studies in companion and farm animals are highly promising.","Volz, Asisa; Fux, Robert; Langenmayer, Martin C; Sutter, Gerd",Berliner und Munchener tierarztliche Wochenschrift,80,24

In felids, two different hemoplasma species have been recognized: Mycoplasma haemofelis (formerly Haemobartonella felis) and ""Candidatus Mycoplasma haemominutum."" Recently developed molecular methods have allowed sensitive and specific identification and quantification of these agents in feline blood samples. In applying these methods to an epidemiological study surveying the Swiss pet cat population for hemoplasma infection, we discovered a third novel and unique feline hemoplasma isolate in a blood sample collected from a cat that had exhibited clinical signs of severe hemolytic anemia. This agent was readily transmitted via intravenous inoculation to two specific-pathogen-free cats. One of these cats was immunocompromised by the administration of methylprednisolone acetate prior to inoculation, and this cat developed severe anemia. The other immunocompetent cat showed a moderate decrease in packed cell volume. Additionally, an increase in red blood cell osmotic fragility was observed. Sequencing of the entire 16S rRNA gene of the new hemoplasma isolate and phylogenetic analysis showed that the isolate was most closely related to two rodent hemotropic mycoplasmal species, M. coccoides and M. haemomuris. A quantitative real-time PCR assay specific for this newly discovered agent was developed, which will be a prerequisite for the diagnosis of infections with the new hemoplasma isolate.","Willi, Barbara; Boretti, Felicitas S; Cattori, Valentino; Tasker, Séverine; Meli, Marina L; Reusch, Claudia; Lutz, Hans; Hofmann-Lehmann, Regina",Journal of clinical microbiology,80,1

Intussusception, a condition in which the intestine acutely invaginates upon itself, is the most common cause of intestinal obstruction in children. We report here the development of a mouse model to study rotavirus-induced intussusception. In this model, both homologous murine and heterologous simian rotavirus strains significantly enhanced the rate of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced intussusception, and this enhancement was replication dependent, requiring rotavirus doses of greater than one 50% infectious dose. Rotavirus-induced intussusceptions did not have observable lymphoid lead points, despite the induction of intestinal lymphoid hyperplasia after rotavirus infection. Intussusceptions are also postulated to result from altered intestinal motility, but rotavirus infection had no effect on gastrointestinal transit. LPS-induced intussusception is associated with the induction of inflammatory mediators, and intussusception rates can be modified by inflammatory antagonists. We show that rotavirus infection significantly enhanced serum tumor necrosis factor alpha and gamma interferon cytokine levels after LPS treatment compared to uninfected mice. Together, these data suggest that rotavirus infection sensitized mice to the inflammatory effects of subsequent LPS treatment to enhance intussusception rates.","Warfield, Kelly L; Blutt, Sarah E; Crawford, Sue E; Kang, Gagandeep; Conner, Margaret E",Journal of virology,80,16

For coronaviruses, regulation of transcription is a major contributor to these differences, but regulation of translation may also be important. Here, we examine the possibility that the 5' untranslated regions (UTRs), unique for each of the nine species of mRNA in the bovine coronavirus and ranging in length from 70 nucleotides (nt) to 210 nt (inclusive of the common 5'-terminal 65-nt leader), can differentially affect the rate of protein accumulation. When the natural 77-nt 5' UTR on synthetic transcripts of mRNA 7 (mRNA for N and I proteins) was replaced with the 210-nt 5' UTR from mRNA 1 (genomic RNA, mRNA for viral polymerase), approximately twofold-less N, or (N) CAT fusion reporter protein, was made in vitro. Twofold less was also made in vivo in uninfected cells when a T7 RNA polymerase-driven transient-transfection system was used. In coronavirus-infected cells, this difference surprisingly became 12-fold as the result of both a stimulated translation from the 77-nt 5' UTR and a repression of translation from the 210-nt 5' UTR. These results reveal that a differential 5' UTR-directed regulation of translation can occur in coronavirus-infected cells and lead us to postulate that the direction and degree of regulation is carried out by viral or virally induced cellular factors acting in trans on cis-acting elements within the 5' UTR.","Senanayake, S D; Brian, D A",Journal of virology,80,16

During the last three decades, statistical phylogenetics has increasingly been applied to the study of microbial pathogens. The new field of phylodynamics was formally introduced in 2004 and encompasses the interaction between evolutionary and ecological processes that shape the spatiotemporal and phylogenetic patterns of infectious disease dynamics. This novel framework has significantly enhanced the study of measurable evolving pathogen populations, in particular RNA viruses and retroviruses. One of the major challenges in phylodynamic studies, however, is the generation of data in the form of dense coverage in sequence sampling coupled with high quality epidemiological and/or accurate clinical information. This review focuses specifically on experimental and data assembling strategies that are required to test multi-level phylodynamic hypotheses, ranging from intra-host viral evolution to population dynamics of infectious disease pandemics. Ultimately, bridging the gap between rational experimental design and phylodynamic inference will prove to be essential to take full advantage of this new exciting area of research.","Norström, Melissa M; Karlsson, Annika C; Salemi, Marco",The new microbiologica,80,14

DESIGN: Retrospective, comparative cohort study METHODS: . SETTING: Single-center STUDY POPULATION: Eyes receiving intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor injections from 7/1/2013 to 9/1/2019. INTERVENTION: Cases were divided into ""face mask group"" if face masks were worn by the physician during intravitreal injections or ""no talking group"" if no face mask was worn but a no talking policy was observed during intravitreal injections. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Rate of endophthalmitis, visual acuity, and microbial spectrum. RESULTS: Of 483,622 intravitreal injections administered, 168 out of 453,460 (0.0371%) cases of endophthalmitis occurred in the ""no talking"" group, and 9 out of 30,162 (0.0298%) cases occurred in the face mask group (odds ratio, 0.81; 95%CI, 0.41-1.57; p=0.527). Sixteen cases of oral flora-associated endophthalmitis were found in the ""no talking"" group (1 in 28,341 injections) compared to none in the face mask group (p=0.302). Mean logMAR visual acuity at presentation in cases that developed culture-positive endophthalmitis was significantly worse in the ""no talking"" group compared to the face mask group (17.1 lines lost from baseline acuity vs 13.4 lines lost; p=0.031), though no difference was observed at six months following treatment (p=0.479). CONCLUSION: Physician face mask use did not influence the risk of post-injection endophthalmitis compared to a no talking policy. However, no cases of oral flora-associated endophthalmitis occurred in the face mask group. Future studies are warranted to assess the role of face mask use to reduce endophthalmitis risk, particularly due to oral flora.","Patel, Samir N; Hsu, Jason; Sivalingam, Meera D; Chiang, Allen; Kaiser, Richard S; Mehta, Sonia; Park, Carl H; Regillo, Carl D; Sivalingam, Arunan; Vander, James F; Ho, Allen C; Garg, Sunir J",Am. j. ophthalmol,80,29

It is critical to dissect the pathogenetic mechanisms in order to reach a targeted therapeutic approach. METHODS: In the present investigation, we evaluated the effects of SARS-CoV2 on human bronchial epithelial cells (HBEC). We used RNA-seq datasets available online for identifying SARS-CoV2 potential genes target on human bronchial epithelial cells. RNA expression levels and potential cellular gene pathways have been analyzed. In order to identify possible common strategies among the main pandemic viruses, such as SARS-CoV2, SARS-CoV1, MERS-CoV, and H1N1, we carried out a hypergeometric test of the main genes transcribed in the cells of the respiratory tract exposed to these viruses. RESULTS: The analysis showed that two mechanisms are highly regulated in HBEC: the innate immunity recruitment and the disassembly of cilia and cytoskeletal structure. The granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (CSF3) and dynein heavy chain 7, axonemal (DNAH7) represented respectively the most upregulated and downregulated genes belonging to the two mechanisms highlighted above. Furthermore, the carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 7 (CEACAM7) that codifies for a surface protein is highly specific of SARS-CoV2 and not for SARS-CoV1, MERS-CoV, and H1N1, suggesting a potential role in viral entry. In order to identify potential new drugs, using a machine learning approach, we highlighted Flunisolide, Thalidomide, Lenalidomide, Desoximetasone, xylazine, and salmeterol as potential drugs against SARS-CoV2 infection. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, lung involvement and RDS could be generated by the activation and down regulation of diverse gene pathway involving respiratory cilia and muscle contraction, apoptotic phenomena, matrix destructuration, collagen deposition, neutrophil and macrophages recruitment.","Nunnari, Giuseppe; Sanfilippo, Cristina; Castrogiovanni, Paola; Imbesi, Rosa; Li Volti, Giovanni; Barbagallo, Ignazio; Musumeci, Giuseppe; Di Rosa, Michelino",Exp Cell Res,80,16

AIM OF THE ARTICLE: The aim was to present the actions, instructions and procedures introduced at the A-BSM to provide information how to deal with pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus in institutions taking care of cultural heritage before and after closure of the Museum for visitors and after reopening. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The described activities were developed at the Museum by a specially established Expert Team. RESULTS: Groups of employees and places in which they were most exposed to contact with visitors and, as a consequence, at the highest risk of getting infected, were characterised. The employees were provided with personal protective equipment, and at the Museum site, devices essential for maintaining the microbiological cleanliness of the rooms, were placed. In the next stage, instructions and procedures for particular groups of employees were prepared. Visitors were educated about the need of taking precautions and were allowed to disinfect in several places at the Memorial Site. Steps to reduce attendance at this time has also been taken. Procedures for employees of the A-BSM were developed in such way that they can also be used after reopening of the Museum for visitors. CONCLUSIONS: The actions which ensured the microbiological safety of the A-BSM employees, brought satisfying results. In more than 21 days after closing of the Museum for visitors, no cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection or COVID-19 were found among employees, despite a very high threat.","Wawrzyk, Anna; Rybitwa, Dorota; Cywinski, Piotr; Pióro, Rafal; Lobacz, Michal",Przegl Epidemiol,80,16

This study aimed to investigate the effect of foods and nutrients as complementary approaches on the recovery from COVID-19 in 170 countries, especially considering the complexity of the disease and the current scarcity of active treatments. METHODS: A retrospective study was performed using the Kaggle database, which links the consumption of various foods with recovery from COVID-19 in 170 countries, using multivariate analysis based on a generalized linear model. RESULTS: The results showed that certain foods had a positive effect on recovery from COVID-19: eggs, fish and seafood, fruits, meat, milk, starchy roots, stimulants, vegetable products, nuts, vegetable oil and vegetables. In general, consumption of higher levels of proteins and lipids had a positive effect on COVID-19 recovery, whereas high consumption of alcoholic beverages had a negative effect. In developed countries, where hunger had been eradicated, the effect of food on recovery from COVID-19 had a greater magnitude than in countries with a higher global hunger index (GHI), where there was almost no identifiable effect. CONCLUSION: Several foods had a positive effect on COVID-19 recovery in developed countries, especially food groups with a higher content of lipids, proteins, antioxidants and micronutrients (e.g., selenium and zinc). In countries with extreme poverty (high GHI), foods presented little effect on recovery from COVID-19.","Cobre, Alexandre F; Surek, Monica; Vilhena, Raquel O; Böger, Beatriz; Fachi, Mariana M; Momade, Danilo R; Tonin, Fernanda S; Sarti, Flavia M; Pontarolo, Roberto",Clin. nutr.

Not only does this vaccination effort represent an unprecedented scientific and technological breakthrough, moving us from the rapid analysis of viral genomes to design, manufacture, clinical trial testing, and use authorization within the time frame of less than a year, but it also highlights rapid progress in the implementation of nanotechnology to assist vaccine development. These advances enable us to deliver nucleic acid and conformation-stabilized subunit vaccines to regional lymph nodes, with the ability to trigger effective humoral and cellular immunity that prevents viral infection or controls disease severity. In addition to a brief description of the design features of unique cationic lipid and virus-mimicking nanoparticles for accomplishing spike protein delivery and presentation by the cognate immune system, we also discuss the importance of adjuvancy and design features to promote cooperative B- and T-cell interactions in lymph node germinal centers, including the use of epitope-based vaccines. Although current vaccine efforts have demonstrated short-term efficacy and vaccine safety, key issues are now vaccine durability and adaptability against viral variants. We present a forward-looking perspective of how vaccine design can be adapted to improve durability of the immune response and vaccine adaptation to overcome immune escape by viral variants. Finally, we consider the impact of nano-enabled approaches in the development of COVID-19 vaccines for improved vaccine design against other infectious agents, including pathogens that may lead to future pandemics.","Nel, André E; Miller, Jeff F",ACS Nano,80,25

OBJECTIVE: To describe a patient with subacute parkinsonism and cognitive dysfunction and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) evidence of bilateral deep white matter and basal ganglia damage. CASE PRESENTATION: A 56-year-old female presented with a 4-week history of insomnia, cognitive decline, and parkinsonism. Brain MRI revealed a bilateral lesion of both globus pallidus, deep white matter, and cerebellar hemispheres. Her son reported that, for the previous month, she had been cleaning her facial mask three times a day with a pure methanol solution as a disinfectant due to an intense fear of acquiring COVID-19. Previously, she had used 97% isopropyl alcohol and had inadvertently switched to methanol. After the exposure ended, she slowly improved but 4 months later she remains severely disabled. CONCLUSIONS: The repeated exposure to methanol vapor, the MRI findings, and the absence of other etiologies for her cognitive and parkinsonian features led to the diagnosis of chronic methanol intoxication with severe central nervous system damage. Misinformation is a likely contributory factor to such scenario. Efforts should be made by the scientific community to educate the general public on avoiding self-damaging behaviors as a result of coronaphobia.","Erburu-Iriarte, Markel; Rodrigo-Armenteros, Patricia; Oyarzun-Irazu, Iñigo; Aranzabal-Alustiza, Ines; Silvarrey-Rodriguez, Saul; Antón-Méndez, Lander; García-Moncó, Juan Carlos",Eur. j. neurol,80,30

Evidence of respirator cleaning and disinfection behaviors and practices by health care workers may inform guidance on reusable respirator use. METHODS: Medical system elastomeric respirator users were surveyed about respirator cleaning and disinfection practices and perceptions via an electronic survey. Respondents were subsequently classified based on reported compliance with their assigned respirator use. To explore whether respirator cleaning and disinfection issues affected compliance with assigned device use, responses were compared between user groups and adjusted for covariates. RESULTS: A total of 432 of 2,024 (21%) eligible elastomeric respirator users completed the survey. Most (>90%) reported that their respirator was clean, but only 52% reported that they always disinfect their respirators after use according to the hospital's expected practice. Only 40 respondents (9%) reported regularly cleaning the respirator with soap and water, in accordance with manufacturer recommendations. Reporting of suboptimal decontamination practice was not associated with assigned device compliance, however, except among providers and respiratory therapists. CONCLUSION/APPLICATION TO PRACTICE: Although perceptions of cleanliness and adherence to expected decontamination practices during routine use did not appear to influence compliance with assigned respirator use overall, this did predict compliance among providers and respiratory therapists, both of whom have nonfixed workstations. Practical and effective strategies to assure easy access to and availability of clean reusable respiratory protective devices are needed to facilitate their use in health care respiratory protection programs.","Hines, Stella E; Brown, Clayton H; Oliver, Marc; Gucer, Patricia; Frisch, Melissa; Hogan, Regina; Roth, Tracy; Chang, James; McDiarmid, Melissa",Workplace Health Saf,80,3

Firstly, the rough dataset is used to reduce the dimension of the indices. Secondly, the number of neurons in the multilayer of BPNN is optimized by QSIA, QSFOA, QPSO, and QGA, respectively. Finally, the deep learning models are then used to establish prediction models with the best number of neurons under these three algorithms for the non-linear real stock returns.

Current pathogenic event models focus on past, and largely direct, trauma exposure to certain kinds of life-threatening events. Yet, traumatic stress reactions to future, indirect trauma exposure, and non-Criterion A events exist, suggesting COVID-19 is also a traumatic stressor which could lead to PTSD symptomology. To examine this idea, we asked a sample of online participants (N = 1,040), in five western countries, to indicate the COVID-19 events they had been directly exposed to, events they anticipated would happen in the future, and other forms of indirect exposure such as through media coverage. We then asked participants to complete the Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist-5, adapted to measure pre/peri/post-traumatic reactions in relation to COVID-19. We also measured general emotional reactions (e.g., angry, anxious, helpless), well-being, psychosocial functioning, and depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms. We found participants had PTSD-like symptoms for events that had not happened and when participants had been directly (e.g., contact with virus) or indirectly exposed to COVID-19 (e.g., via media). Moreover, 13.2% of our sample were likely PTSD-positive, despite types of COVID-19 ""exposure"" (e.g., lockdown) not fitting DSM-5 criteria.

MethodsWe assessed peripheral blood gene expression in 53 adults with confirmed SARS-CoV-2-infection clinically adjudicated as having mild, moderate or severe disease. Supervised principal components analysis was used to build a weighted gene expression risk score (WGERS) to discriminate between severe and non-severe COVID. ResultsGene expression patterns in participants with mild and moderate illness were similar, but significantly different from severe illness. When comparing severe versus non-severe illness, we identified >4000 genes differentially expressed (FDR<0.05). Biological pathways increased in severe COVID-19 were associated with platelet activation and coagulation, and those significantly decreased with T cell signaling and differentiation. A WGERS based on 18 genes distinguished severe illness in our training cohort (cross-validated ROC-AUC=0.98), and need for intensive care in an independent cohort (ROC-AUC=0.85). Dichotomizing the WGERS yielded 100% sensitivity and 85% specificity for classifying severe illness in our training cohort, and 84% sensitivity and 74% specificity for defining the need for intensive care in the validation cohort. ConclusionThese data suggest that gene expression classifiers may provide clinical utility as predictors of COVID-19 illness severity.","Peterson, Derick R; Baran, Andrea M; Bhattacharya, Soumyaroop; Branche, Angela Ramona; Croft, Daniel P; Corbett, Anthony M; Walsh, Edward E; Falsey, Ann R; Mariani, Thomas J",,80,1

However, the emergence of unusual thrombotic presentations in COVID-19 patients is the real concern. Interaction of the spike glycoprotein with ACE2 receptor present in the host cell surface mediates the entry of SARS-CoV-2 causing COVID-19 infection. New clinical findings of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis are coming out every day, and one such mystery is the formation of mysterious blood clots in the various tissues and organs of COVID-19 patients, which needs critical attention. To address this issue, we hypothesis that, high ACE2 expression in the endothelium of blood vessels facilitates the high-affinity binding of SARS-CoV-2 using spike protein, causing infection and internal injury inside the vascular wall of blood vessels. This viral associated injury may directly/indirectly initiate activation of coagulation and clotting cascades forming internal blood clots. However, the presence of these clots is undesirable as they are responsible for thrombosis and need to be treated with anti-thrombotic intervention.","Biswas, Sourav; Thakur, Vikram; Kaur, Parneet; Khan, Azhar; Kulshrestha, Saurabh; Kumar, Pradeep",Med Hypotheses,80,2

Instead of quantifying the full-length HbA1c glycated protein, in the present study, we proposed the peptide-based strategy to quantify the depletion of the tryptic peptides of hemoglobin for the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The peptides were discovered and validated as T2DM biomarkers by label-free LC-ESI-DMRM method without reference material. The glucose could react with hemoglobin's free amino group of N-terminus and Ïµ-amino group of lysine residues and leave the modification on the hemoglobin tryptic peptides. Thus, there are two types of peptides in the hemoglobin: sensitive peptides and insensitive peptides to glucose due to the differential sensitivity of lysine residues to glycation. To discover two types of peptides of hemoglobin, we first developed the assay of liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization mass spectrometry coupled with dynamic multiple reaction monitoring. The protein coverage reaches 94.2%. Moreover, the hemoglobin was incubated with the 500 mmol/L glucose for 20 days, 40 days and 60 days in vitro to screen the sensitive peptides and insensitive peptides to glucose. A total of 14 sensitive peptides and 4 insensitive peptides were discovered. Furthermore, the LC-ESI-DMRM method was also utilized to validated the glucose-sensitive peptides by 40 clinical samples with healthy control individuals (n = 20) and type 2 diabetes mellitus patients (n = 20). Three putative sensitive peptides (LLGNVLVCVLAHHFGK, VVAGVANALAHKYH, LRVDPVNFK) from the hemoglobin showed excellent sensitivity and specificity based on receiver operating characteristic analysis and were verified as the promising biomarkers for the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus. And one peptide (LLVVYPWTQR) was found as glucose-insensitive peptide. Taken together, the findings of this study suggest that quantification of hemoglobin tryptic peptides using label-free and standard-free LC-ESI-DMRM is an alternative method for the diagnosis of T2DM, which could be combined with other MS-based blood biomarkers for diagnosis of multiple diseases in MS single shot.","Hong, Jie; Xin, Shuchen; Min, Rui; Zhang, Yongqian; Deng, Yulin",Redox Biol,80,1

We calculated the; seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in HCW at Eastern Health, a tertiary healthcare network in Victoria, and assessed associations with demographics, work location and role. METHODS: A cross-sectional cohort study of HCW at Eastern Health was conducted. Serum was analysed for the presence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, and all participants completed; an online survey collecting information on demographics, place of work, role, and exposures; to COVID-19. Seroprevalence was calculated as the proportion participants with SARS-CoV-2; antibodies out of all tested individuals. RESULTS: The crude seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in this study was 2.17% (16/736). Thirteen of the 16 (81.2%) positive cases had previously been diagnosed with COVID-19 by PCR: the seroprevalence in the group not previously diagnosed with COVID by PCR was 0.42% (3/720). Having direct contact with COVID-19 patients did not increase the likelihood of having positive serology. A prior history of symptoms consistent with COVID-19 was associated with a higher likelihood of having positive serology (OR 17.2, p = 0.006, 95%CI: 2.25-131.55). CONCLUSION: Our calculated seroprevalence of 2.17% is higher than estimated in the general Australian population, but lower than that reported in HCW internationally. The; majority of those with positive serology in our study had previously been diagnosed with COVID-19 by PCR based testing. Seropositivity was not associated with interaction with COVID-19 positive patients, highlighting effective infection prevention and control practices within the workplace.","Lau, Jillian Sy; Buntine, Paul; Price, Melanie; Darzins, Peteris; Newnham, Evan; Connell, Ailie; Chean, Roy; Edwards, Glenn; Guy, Stephen",Infect.

Analyzing the available literature, there is very scarce evidence regarding the use of MIS and robotics for treatment of pediatric surgical and urological pathologies during this pandemic. However, we found some useful information that we would like to share with other pediatric surgeons and urologists through this journal. Based upon the available data, we believe that surgery should only be performed in pediatric patients with emergent/urgent and oncological indications until resolution of the COVID-19 outbreak. Robotics and MIS may be safely performed in such selected children by adopting specific technical precautions such as prevention of aerosol dispersion using filters/suction or adapted systems and appropriate use of electrocautery and other sealing devices for reduction of surgical smoke, as reported in our recent experience. Another key point to manage this pandemic emergency is that all hospitals should provide health care professionals with adequate individual protections and perform universal screening in all patients undergoing surgery. Considering that this pandemic is a rapidly evolving situation with new information available daily, these data resulting from the analysis of literature focused on pediatric robotics and MIS may be further revised and updated.","Esposito, Ciro; Masieri, Lorenzo; Castagnetti, Marco; Crocetto, Felice; Escolino, Maria","J. laparoendosc. adv. surg. tech., Part A",80,16

In this study, we report findings from a survey conducted among attending physician (AP) members of the American Society for Apheresis (ASFA) to elucidate the status of their well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic as well as resources provided or actions taken by their institutions and themselves personally to maintain or improve their well-being. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A 17-question, voluntary, IRB-approved survey regarding well-being was distributed to the ASFA AP members between August 26, 2020 and September 16, 2020. The descriptive analyses were reported as number and frequency of respondents for each question. Non-parametric chi-square tests, ANOVA, and paired t-tests were performed to determine differences in categorical variables, changes in well-being scores, and compare time points, respectively. RESULTS: Based on the responses of 70 attending level physicians representing the United States (U.S., 53, 75.7%) and outside the U.S. (17, 24.3%), the following were observed: (1) COVID-19 negatively affects the well-being of a sub-population of APs, (2) neither institutional nor individual measures to improve well-being completely resolved the problem of decreased AP well-being during the pandemic, and (3) personal actions may be superior to institutional resources. CONCLUSION: There is a widespread decline in AP well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic that was not adequately improved by institutional or personal resources/actions taken. Institutions and physicians must work together to implement strategies including resources and actions that could further improve AP physician well-being during a public health crisis.","Tanhehco, Yvette C; Li, Yanhua; Zantek, Nicole D; Becker, Joanne; Alsammak, Mohamed; Mikesell, Kael; Wu, Ding Wen; Foster, Tisha; Chhibber, Vishesh; Martin, Marisa Saint; Wehrli, Gay",Transfusion,80,26

METHODS: Data for this study were from a nationally representative sample of 1472 Canadian parents (Meanageâ¯=â¯45.12, SDâ¯=â¯7.55) of children (5-11 years old) or youth (12-17 years old). Data were collected in April 2020 via an online survey. Survey items assessed demographic, behavioral, social, micro-environmental, and macro-environmental characteristics. Four decision trees of adherence and non-adherence to all movement recommendations combined and each individual movement recommendation (physical activity [PA], screen time, and sleep) were generated. RESULTS: Results revealed specific combinations of adherence and non-adherence characteristics. Characteristics associated with adherence to the recommendation(s) included high parental perceived capability to restrict screen time, annual household income of &#8805; $100,000, increases in children's and youth's outdoor PA/sport since the COVID-19 outbreak began, being a boy, having parents younger than 43 years old, and small increases in children's and youth's sleep duration since the COVID-19 outbreak began. Characteristics associated with non-adherence to the recommendation(s) included low parental perceived capability to restrict screen time, youth aged 12-17 years, decreases in children's and youth's outdoor PA/sport since the COVID-19 outbreak began, primary residences located in all provinces except Quebec, low parental perceived capability to support children's and youth's sleep and PA, and annual household income of &#8804; $99,999. CONCLUSION: Our results show that specific characteristics interact to contribute to (non)adherence to the movement behavior recommendations. Results highlight the importance of targeting parents' perceived capability for the promotion of children's and youth's movement behaviors during challenging times of the COVID-19 pandemic, paying particular attention to enhancing parental perceived capability to restrict screen time.","Guerrero, Michelle D; Vanderloo, Leigh M; Rhodes, Ryan E; Faulkner, Guy; Moore, Sarah A; Tremblay, Mark S",J Sport Health Sci,80,26

The first cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection occurred in November-19 in Wuhan, China. The preventive measures taken did not prevent the rapid spread of the virus to all countries around the world. To date, there are about 2.54 million deaths, effective vaccines are in clinical trials. SARS-CoV-2 uses the ACE-2 protein as an intracellular gateway. ACE-2 is a key component of the Renin Angiotensin (RAS) system, a key regulator of cardiovascular function. Considering the key role of ACE-2 in COVID-19 infection, both as an entry receptor and as a protective role, especially for the respiratory tract, and considering the variations of ACE-2 and ACE during the stages of viral infection, it is clear the important role that the pharmacological regulation of RAS and ACE-2 can assume.

To solve the presented problem effectively and efficiently, a multi-objective genetic algorithm is proposed to achieve high-quality schedules for various factors such as contact rate and transition rate of symptomatic infected individuals to the quarantined infected class. By changing the contact rate and the transition rate of symptomatic infected individuals to the quarantined infected class, two optimal policies are designed. This study has two main scientific contributions that are: (1) This is pioneer research that proposes policies regarding COVID-19, (2) This is also the first research that addresses COVID-19 and considers its economic consequences through a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm.

In this study, sediment cores were sampled from the most eutrophic Meiliang Bay of Lake Taihu, and three treatments were set up in a laboratory incubation experiment, involving (a) the non-treated sediment cores, (b) inoculation, and (c) sterilization. The dissolved and labile iron (Fe) and P were obtained by high-resolution dialysis and the diffusive gradients in thin films (DGT) technique, respectively. AgI-based DGT was used for measuring the 2D distribution of labile sulfide. The bacterial community was investigated using a scanning electron microscope and 16S rRNA high throughput sequencing technique. The results showed that sterilization reduced the capacity of sediment to immobilize P, and that the critical sediment depth layer for microbial P sequestration was 0-10 mm. In addition, sterilization or inoculation significantly changes the structure of bacterial communities. Fe or S oxidation under micro-aerobic or anaerobic conditions played an important role in bacterial retention of P in the sediments. Nitrate-reducing coupling Fe(II)-oxidizing bacteria (Acidovorax) in the inoculated sediment and electrogenic sulfur-oxidizing bacteria (Candidatus Electronema) in the non-treated sediment were identified as the key bacterial genera responsible for the retention of P in sediments. This implies that bacterial communities could quickly establish the ability for negative feedback regulation by inoculation once the function and structure of indigenous sediment bacteria are seriously impaired, although this needs further validation in the field.","Fan, Xianfang; Xing, Xigang; Ding, Shiming",Sci Total Environ,80,28

Extrahepatic manifestations of NAFLD such as cardiovascular disease, polycystic ovarian syndrome, chronic kidney disease, and hypothyroidism have been well described in the literature. In recent years, it has become evident that patients suffering from NAFLD might be at higher risk of developing various infections. The proposed mechanism for this association includes links through hyperglycemia, insulin resistance, alterations in innate immunity, obesity, and vitamin D deficiency. Additionally, a risk independent of these factors mediated by alterations in gut microbiota might contribute to a higher burden of infections in these individuals. In this narrative review, we synthetize current knowledge on several infections including urinary tract infection, pneumonia, Helicobacter pylori, coronavirus disease 2019, and Clostridioides difficile as they relate to NAFLD. Additionally, we explore NAFLD's association with hidradenitis suppurativa.","Adenote, Abimbola; Dumic, Igor; Madrid, Cristian; Barusya, Christopher; Nordstrom, Charles W; Rueda Prada, Libardo",Can J Gastroenterol Hepatol,80,1

One of the striking targets amongst all the proteins in coronavirus is the main protease (Mpro), as it plays vital biological roles in replication and maturation of the virus, and hence the potential target. The aim of this study is to repurpose the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved molecules via computer-aided drug designing against Mpro (PDB ID: 6Y2F) of SARS CoV-2 due to its high x-ray resolution of 1.95 Å as compared to other published Mprostructures. High Through Virtual Screening (HTVS) of 2456 FDA approved drugs using structure-based docking were analyzed. Molecular Dynamics simulations were performed to check the overall structural stability (RMSD), C&#945; fluctuations (RMSF) and protein-ligand interactions. Further, trajectory analysis was performed to assess the binding quality by exploiting the protein-residue motion cross correlation (DCCM) and binding free energy (MM/GBSA). Tenofovir, an antiretroviral for HIV-proteases and Terlipressin, a vasoconstrictor show stable RMSD, RMSF, better MM/GBSA with good cross correlation as compared to the Apo and O6K. Moreover, the results show concurrence with Nelfinavir, Lopinavir and Ritonavir which have shown significant inhibition in in vitro studies. Therefore, we conclude that Tenofovir and Terlipresssin might also show protease inhibition but are still open to clinical validation in case of SARS-CoV 2 treatment.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

It is estimated that in the US, 35,000-100,000 contact tracers will be hired (and trained) to talk to recently-infected individuals, understand who they have exposed to the virus, and encourage those exposed to self-quarantine. The Center for Disease Control recommends the use of motivational interviewing (MI) by contact tracers to encourage compliance with contact tracing/quarantine. Contact tracers need to sensitively communicate with COVID-19-exposed individuals who may also be experiencing other issues caused by the pandemic, such as anxiety, depression, grief, anger, intimate partner violence, health problems, food insecurity, and/or unemployment. Social workers are particularly prepared to address the mental health and other psychosocial problems that may be encountered in the tracing process. This article describes contact tracing, its use in other diseases, the role of MI, psychosocial issues that contact tracers may encounter, and how social work can respond to these needs.

We aimed to investigate the adverse events following immunization (AEFIs) for COVID-19 among healthcare workers (HCWs). METHODS: This was a retrospective study of the AEFIs associated with the first dose of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine at the Kosin University Gospel Hospital from March 3 to March 22, 2021. We investigated the systemic and local adverse events during the 7 days following the vaccination using the Mobile Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (MVAERS) developed by our hospital. RESULTS: A total of 1,503 HCWs were vaccinated, and the data of 994 HCWs were reported in the MVAERS. The most commonly reported AEFIs were tenderness at the injection site (94.5%), fatigue (92.9%), pain at the injection site (88.0%), and malaise (83.8%). The severity of most AEFIs was mild-to-moderate, and the severity and number of AEFIs were less in the older age group. There were no serious events requiring hospitalization, and most AEFIs improved within a few days. CONCLUSION: The AEFIs associated with the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine were tolerable, and the use of the MVAERS was helpful in monitoring the AEFIs. The use of MVAERS will help in sharing accurate and ample information about vaccination against COVID-19.","Jeon, Minji; Kim, Jehun; Oh, Chi Eun; Lee, Jin Young",J Korean Med Sci,80,13

We projected that recurrent wintertime outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2 will probably occur after the initial, most severe pandemic wave. Absent other interventions, a key metric for the success of social distancing is whether critical care capacities are exceeded. To avoid this, prolonged or intermittent social distancing may be necessary into 2022. Additional interventions, including expanded critical care capacity and an effective therapeutic, would improve the success of intermittent distancing and hasten the acquisition of herd immunity. Longitudinal serological studies are urgently needed to determine the extent and duration of immunity to SARS-CoV-2.

Proposed as a tool to support ‘traditional’ forms of contact-tracing carried out to monitor contagion, these apps have triggered an intense debate with respect to their legal and ethical permissibility, social desirability and general feasibility. Based on a large-scale study including qualitative data from 349 interviews conducted in nine European countries (Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, German-speaking Switzerland, the United Kingdom), this paper shows that the binary framing often found in surveys and polls, which contrasts privacy concerns with the usefulness of these interventions for public health, does not capture the depth, breadth, and nuances of people’s positions towards COVID-19 contact-tracing apps. The paper provides a detailed account of how people arrive at certain normative positions by analysing the argumentative patterns, tropes and (moral) repertoires underpinning people’s perspectives on digital contact-tracing. Specifically, we identified a spectrum comprising five normative positions towards the use of COVID-19 contact-tracing apps: opposition, scepticism of feasibility, pondered deliberation, resignation, and support. We describe these stances and analyse the diversity of assumptions and values that underlie the normative orientations of our interviewees. We conclude by arguing that policy attempts to develop and implement these and other digital responses to the pandemic should move beyond the reiteration of binary framings, and instead cater to the variety of values, concerns and expectations that citizens voice in discussions about these types of public health interventions.

The anatomical name of the joint is the radio-carpal joint[1-5].It presents a sinuous opposing. The concave proximal articular surface is formed by the lower end of the radius and the articular disc of the inferior radio-ulnar joint. The reciprocally convex distal articular surface is formed by the scaphoid, lunate and triquetral bones from lateral to the medial side. The joint capsule surrounds the wrist and is attached to the distal ends of the radius and ulna and proximal rows of carpals excluding the pisiform. Strong ligaments strengthen and stabilize the joint from the sides, and on the ventral and dorsal surfaces. Repeated episodes of mechanical stress can cause the event of repetitive motion injuries or overuse injuries, which when including poor posture and biomechanics put much strain on the joints. They usually develop slowly over an extended period of your time. Wrists are one of the foremost common sites of repetitive motion injury. Therefore this research was designed to study the effect of laptop usage among physiotherapists(students and teachers). This study may give awareness to the individual to avoid or minimize the overuse of laptops and therefore the complications by breaking bad habits, practicing recommended/approved posture while using the laptop, and modulating the planning of the keyboards. Due to covid 19 era, the use of laptops and computer has significantly increased among students and teachers of different universities for teaching purposes.

The study aimed to investigate for a relationship in bicycle related injuries in the paediatric population during the time of COVID-19 restrictions. METHODS: A retrospective study of the incident of motorized and non-motorized bicycle related injuries and trauma presentations during the COVID-19 'shutdown' period from March to June 2020. Data were collected from the Emergency Department Information System, discharge summaries, operation and radiology reports. The data presented is from Perth Children's Hospital, the only tertiary paediatric hospital and the only referral centre for childhood trauma in the state of Western Australia. Participants were children aged 15 years and younger attending the emergency department (ED) at Perth Children's Hospital during the designated time period. The primary outcomes included total ED presentations, bicycle related presentations and bicycle related admissions during the COVID-19 period. RESULTS: Bicycle related presentations to the ED increased by 42.7% over the COVID-19 period from 1.4% to 3.0% of all children attending the ED. Children admitted to the hospital with bicycle related injuries or trauma increased by 48.7% from 76 to 113 children in comparison to the same period in 2019. CONCLUSION: During the period of COVID-19 restrictions, paediatric ED presentations decreased dramatically, but bicycle related injuries and trauma increased substantially. Safety equipment including helmets and protective gear should be worn for all children riding bicycles, and social distancing should be maintained.","van Oudtshoorn, Sarah; Chiu, Kei Y C; Khosa, Japinder",ANZ J Surg,80,33

The aim of this prospective cohort study was to assess the feasibility of resuming elective operations during the current and possible future peaks of this coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. METHODS: We collected data during the peak of the current pandemic in the United Kingdom on adult patients who underwent elective surgery in a ""COVID-19-free"" hospital from April 8 to May 29, 2020. The study included patients from various surgical specialties. Nonelective and pediatric cases were excluded. The primary outcome was 30-day mortality postoperatively. Secondary outcomes were the rate of coronavirus disease 2019 infections, new onset of pulmonary symptoms after hospitalization, and requirement for admission to the intensive care unit. RESULTS: A total of 309 consecutive adult patients were included in this study. No patients died nor required intensive care unit admission. Operations graded ""Intermediate"" were the most performed procedure representing 91% of the total number. One patient was diagnosed with a coronavirus disease 2019 infection after being transferred to the nearest local emergency hospital for management of postoperative pain secondary to common bile duct stone and was successfully treated conservatively on the ward. No patient developed pulmonary complications. Three patients were admitted for greater than 23 hours. Twenty-seven patients (8.7%) developed complications. Complications graded as 2 and 3 according to the Clavien-Dindo classification occurred in 14 and 2 patients, respectively.

The relationship between severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infection and psychiatric diseases is of great concern, with an evident link between corona virus infections and various central and peripheral nervous system manifestations. Unmitigated neuro-inflammation has been noted to underlie not only the severe respiratory complications of the disease but is also present in a range of neuro-psychiatric illnesses. Several neurological and psychiatric disorders are characterized by immune-inflammatory states, while treatments for these disorders have distinct anti-inflammatory properties and effects. With inflammation being a common contributing factor in SARS-CoV-2, as well as psychiatric disorders, treatment of either condition may affect disease progression of the other or alter response to pharmacological treatment. In this review, we elucidate how viral infections could affect pre-existing psychiatric conditions and how pharmacological treatments of these conditions may affect overall progress and outcome in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2. We address whether any treatment-induced benefits and potential adverse effects may ultimately affect the overall treatment approach, considering the underlying dysregulated neuro-inflammatory processes and potential drug interactions. Finally, we suggest adjunctive treatment options for SARS-CoV-2-associated neuro-psychiatric symptoms.","Jansen van Vuren, Esmé; Steyn, Stephan F; Brink, Christiaan B; Möller, Marisa; Viljoen, Francois P; Harvey, Brian H",Biomed Pharmacother,80,3

Therefore, this study explored the temporal and spatiotemporal dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic in Kuwait using daily confirmed case data collected between the 23 February and 07 May 2020. METHODS: The pandemic progression was quantified using the time-dependent reproductive number (R(t)). The spatiotemporal scan statistic model was used to identify local clustering events. Variability in transmission dynamics was accounted for within and between two socioeconomic classes: citizens-residents and migrant workers. RESULTS: The pandemic size in Kuwait continues to grow (R(t)s &#8805;2), indicating significant ongoing spread. Significant spreading and clustering events were detected among migrant workers, due to their densely populated areas and poor living conditions. However, the government's aggressive intervention measures have substantially lowered pandemic growth in migrant worker areas. However, at a later stage of the study period, active spreading and clustering events among both socioeconomic classes were found.

The ML models have long been used in many application domains which needed the identification and prioritization of adverse factors for a threat. Several prediction methods are being popularly used to handle forecasting problems. This study demonstrates the capability of ML models to forecast the number of upcoming patients affected by COVID-19 which is presently considered as a potential threat to mankind. In particular, four standard forecasting models, such as linear regression (LR), least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), support vector machine (SVM), and exponential smoothing (ES) have been used in this study to forecast the threatening factors of COVID-19. Three types of predictions are made by each of the models, such as the number of newly infected cases, the number of deaths, and the number of recoveries in the next 10 days. The results produced by the study proves it a promising mechanism to use these methods for the current scenario of the COVID-19 pandemic. The results prove that the ES performs best among all the used models followed by LR and LASSO which performs well in forecasting the new confirmed cases, death rate as well as recovery rate, while SVM performs poorly in all the prediction scenarios given the available dataset.","Rustam, Furqan; Reshi, Aijaz Ahmad; Mehmood, Arif; Ullah, Saleem; On, Byung-Won; Aslam, Waqar; Choi, Gyu Sang",IEEE Access,80,20

The aim of this study was to see whether or not this may affect overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS). METHOD: A systematic review was carried out according to PRISMA guidelines (PROSPERO ID: CRD42020189158). Medline, EMBASE and Scopus were interrogated. Patients aged over 18 years with a diagnosis of colon or rectal cancer who received elective surgery as their primary treatment were included. Delay to elective surgery was defined as the period between CRC diagnosis and the day of surgery. Meta-analysis of the outcomes OS and DFS were conducted. Forest plots, funnel plots and tests of heterogeneity were produced. An estimated number needed to harm (NNH) was calculated for statistically significant pooled hazard ratios (HRs). RESULTS: Of 3753 articles identified, seven met the inclusion criteria. Encompassing 314 560 patients, three of the seven studies showed that a delay to elective resection is associated with poorer OS or DFS. OS was assessed at a 1 month delay, the HR for six datasets was 1.13 (95% CI 1.02-1.26, p = 0.020) and at 3 months the pooled HR for three datasets was 1.57 (95% CI 1.16-2.12, p = 0.004). The estimated NNH for a delay at 1 month and 3 months was 35 and 10 respectively. Delay was nonsignificantly negatively associated with DFS on meta-analysis. CONCLUSION: This review recommends that elective surgery for CRC patients is not postponed longer than 4 weeks, as available evidence suggests extended delays from diagnosis are associated with poorer outcomes. Focused research is essential so patient groups can be prioritized based on risk factors in future delays or pandemics.","Whittaker, Thomas M; Abdelrazek, Mohamed E G; Fitzpatrick, Aran J; Froud, Joseph L J; Kelly, Jack R; Williamson, Jeremy S; Williams, Gethin L",Colorectal Dis,80,30

Utilization of the internet has increased dramatically over the last 10 years and in 2016, we added an online seminar. With the emergence of COVID-19 and new rules regarding social distancing, we are currently relying exclusively on web-based orientation. Research suggests there are racial and socioeconomic disparities in the utilization of internet health resources in the general population. To our knowledge this has not been studied in regard to the bariatric population. METHODS: A retrospective chart review was performed on patients who attended online (OS) and in-person seminars (IPS). Our primary endpoint was to compare the percentage of patients who underwent surgery. Secondary outcomes included differences in demographic and clinical characteristics between the patients who attended the OS versus the IPS. RESULTS: Of the 1152 patients who attended a bariatric orientation, 71.2% scheduled an office visit.

Of patients eligible for surgery, there was a higher percentage of Caucasians in the OS group while the IPS group had higher rates of Hispanic and African Americans. Patients from the OS group had higher rates of marriage and employment, and lower rates of medical co-morbidities. When controlling for age, sex, race/ethnicity, marital status, employment status and medical co-morbidities, there was no significant impact of type of orientation on progression to surgery. CONCLUSION: We found that there was no difference in progression to surgery between the two orientation groups. Importantly, however, we detected marked demographic and clinical differences between the two patient populations. There is an urgent need to address these disparities as we are now heavily relying on patient outreach and education via the internet.","Shapiro, Mia; Leenen, David; Ryder, Beth; Stafford, Todd; Roye, G Dean; Vithiananthan, Siva",Surg. endosc,80,24

The National Early Warning Score 2 (NEWS2) is widely used in emergency medicine, but so far, no studies have evaluated its use in patients with covid-19. We aimed to study the performance of NEWS2 and compare commonly used clinical risk stratification tools at admission to predict risk of severe disease and in-hospital mortality in patients with covid-19. METHODS: This was a prospective cohort study in a public non-university general hospital in the Oslo area, Norway, including a cohort of all 66 patients hospitalised with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection from the start of the pandemic; 13 who died during hospital stay and 53 who were discharged alive. Data were collected consecutively from March 9th to April 27th 2020. The main outcome was the ability of the NEWS2 score and other clinical risk scores at emergency department admission to predict severe disease and in-hospital mortality in covid-19 patients. We calculated sensitivity and specificity with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for NEWS2 scores &#8805;5 and &#8805; 6, quick Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA) score &#8805; 2, &#8805;2 Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS) criteria, and CRB-65 score &#8805; 2. Areas under the curve (AUCs) for the clinical risk scores were compared using DeLong's test. RESULTS: In total, 66 patients (mean age 67.9 years) were included. Of these, 23% developed severe disease. In-hospital mortality was 20%. Tachypnoea, hypoxemia and confusion at admission were more common in patients developing severe disease. A NEWS2 score &#8805; 6 at admission predicted severe disease with 80.0% sensitivity and 84.3% specificity (Area Under the Curve (AUC) 0.822, 95% CI 0.690-0.953). NEWS2 was superior to qSOFA score &#8805; 2 (AUC 0.624, 95% CI 0.446-0.810, p < 0.05) and other clinical risk scores for this purpose. CONCLUSION: NEWS2 score at hospital admission predicted severe disease and in-hospital mortality, and was superior to other widely used clinical risk scores in patients with covid-19.","Myrstad, Marius; Ihle-Hansen, Håkon; Tveita, Anders Aune; Andersen, Elizabeth Lyster; Nygård, Ståle; Tveit, Arnljot; Berge, Trygve",Scand J Trauma Resusc Emerg Med,80,16

The Swedish Public Health Agency emphasized individual responsibility and pushed for behavioral changes. With strict lockdown a 77% decrease in ankle fracture incidence has been reported. We investigated whether there was a change in the incidence of ankle fractures seen at 7 selected hospitals during the Covid-19 pandemic 2020.Patients and methods - Data on all ankle fractures treated at 7 selected departments during March 15 through June 15, 2020, and for the same period in the preceding 3 years (2017-2019), was retrieved from the Swedish Fracture Register. The number of fractures during the whole period and subsequent 30-day periods were compared between 2020 and 2017-2019, including subgroup analyses of age and sex.Results - The monthly rate of ankle fractures was reduced by 14% in 2020 (139 fractures) compared with 2017-2019 (161 fractures). Women had a 16% decrease and patients aged > 70 years had a 29% decrease. During the 1st 30-day period, a 26% decrease in fractures was seen.Interpretation - During the 1st wave of the Covid-19 pandemic, a moderate decline in the number of ankle fractures was seen. Women and patients aged > 70 years displayed the greatest reduction. The greatest reduction in incidence of fractures was seen during the 1st 30-day period. This indicates greater adherence to government recommendations regarding social distancing in these subgroups and during the 1st month of the pandemic.

A crucial challenge in studying MV infection is to understand the so-called 'measles paradox'-the progression of the infection to severe immunosuppression before clearance of acute viremia, which is also observed in canine distemper virus (CDV) infection. However, a lack of models that match in vivo data has restricted our understanding of this complex and counter-intuitive phenomenon. Recently, progress was made in the development of a model that fits data from acute measles infection in rhesus macaques. This progress motivates our investigations to gain additional insights from this model into the control mechanisms underlying the paradox. In this paper, we investigated analytical conditions determining the control and robustness of viral clearance for MV and CDV, to untangle complex feedback mechanisms underlying the dynamics of acute infections in their natural hosts. We applied control theory to this model to help resolve the measles paradox. We showed that immunosuppression is important to control and clear the virus. We also showed under which conditions T-cell killing becomes the primary mechanism for immunosuppression and viral clearance. Furthermore, we characterized robustness properties of T-cell immunity to explain similarities and differences in the control of MV and CDV. Together, our results are consistent with experimental data, advance understanding of control mechanisms of viral clearance across morbilliviruses, and will help inform the development of effective treatments. Further the analysis methods and results have the potential to advance understanding of immune system responses to a range of viral infections such as COVID-19.","Anelone, A. J. N.; Hancock, E.

Materials and Methods: The study includes 386 consecutive patients recruited from 10 March to 30 June 2020 among those being treated at the Institute of Psychopathology in Rome (Italy) with an age &#8805;18 years and meeting DSM-5 criteria for major depressive disorder (MDD) (35.2%), bipolar I (BD-I) (21.5%) or II (BD-II) (28.8%) disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) (7.5%), panic disorder (PD) (7.0%) or social anxiety (SA). A total of 34.2% had lifetime comorbid Axis I disorders and 15.3% had alcohol/drug abuse disorders. Using a semi-structured interview, we investigated if the impact of COVID-19 stress for patients has been similar, higher or lower than that of their family and friends and, for patients with relapse/symptoms worsening, if there was a relationship between the clinical condition worsening and the pandemic stress. Results: Compared with that experienced by their family members and friends, the psychological impact of pandemic stress was similar in 52.1% of the sample, better in 37.1% and worse in 10.8%. In 21 patients (5.4%), the stress triggered a recurrence or worsened the symptoms.

Based on our literature review, there has been a relative increase in the number of such cases being treated by hysterotomy and/or local uterine lesion resection and repair. In the present study, a retrospective analysis was conducted to compare the clinical outcomes when different management strategies were used to terminate pregnancy in the patients with placenta previa and PAS. METHODS: A total of 51 patients who underwent pregnancy termination in the second trimester in Beijing Obstetrics and Gynecology Hospital between June 2013 and December 2018 were retrospectively analyzed in this study. All patients having previous caesarean delivery (CD) were diagnosed with placenta previa status and PAS. RESULTS: â Among the 51 patients, 16 cases received mifepristone and misoprostol medical termination, 15 cases received mifepristone and Rivanol medical termination, but 1 of them was transferred to hysterotomy due to failed labor induction, another 20 cases were performed planned hysterotomy. There was no placenta percreta cases and uterine artery embolization (UAE) was all performed before surgery.â¡ There were 31 cases who underwent medical termination and 30 cases were vaginal delivery. Dilation and evacuation (D&E) were used in 20 cases of medical abortion failure and in all 30 cases of difficult manual removal of placental tissue. â¢ A statistically significant difference was found among the three different strategies in terms of gestational weeks, the type of placenta previa status, main operative success rate and ß-HCG regression time (P < 0.05). â£ There were 4(7.8%) cases who were taken up for hysterectomy because of life-threatening bleeding or severe bacteremia during or after delivery and hysterotomy. The uterus was preserved with the implanted placenta partly or completely left in situ in 47(92.2%) cases. Combined medical and/or surgical management were used for the residual placenta and the time of menstrual recovery was 52(range: 33 to 86) days after pregnancy termination. CONCLUSIONS: Terminating a pregnancy by vaginal delivery through medical induction of labor may be feasible if clinicians have an overall understanding of gestational age, the type of placenta previa status, the type of placenta accreta, and patients concerns about preserving fertility. A collaborative team effort in tertiary medical centers with a very experience MDT and combined application of multiple methods is required to optimize patient outcomes.","Hu, Qiaofei; Li, Changdong; Luo, Lanrong; Li, Jian; Zhang, Xiaofeng; Chen, Suwen; Yang, Xiaokui",BMC Pregnancy Childbirth,80,16

The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus responsible for COVID-19, binds to its receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), and replicates within the cells of the nasal cavity, then spreads along the airway tracts, causing mild clinical manifestations, and, in a majority of patients, a persisting loss of smell. In some individuals, SARS-CoV-2 reaches and infects several organs, including the lung, leading to severe pulmonary disease. SARS-CoV-2 induces neurological symptoms, likely contributing to morbidity and mortality through unknown mechanisms. Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) is a bioactive sphingolipid with pleiotropic properties and functions in many tissues, including the nervous system. S1P regulates neurogenesis and inflammation and it is implicated in multiple sclerosis (MS). Notably, Fingolimod (FTY720), a modulator of S1P receptors, has been approved for the treatment of MS and is being tested for COVID-19. Here, we discuss the putative role of S1P on viral infection and in the modulation of inflammation and survival in the stem cell niche of the olfactory epithelium. This could help to design therapeutic strategies based on S1P-mediated signaling to limit or overcome the host-virus interaction, virus propagation and the pathogenesis and complications involving the nervous system.","Meacci, Elisabetta; Garcia-Gil, Mercedes; Pierucci, Federica",Int. j. mol. sci.

The gradual dumping of plastic wastes, inadequate standard detection methods with specific removal techniques, and slow disposal rate of microplastics make it ubiquitous in the environment. Evidence shows that microplastics act as a potential vector by adsorbing different heavy metals, pathogens, and other chemical additives widely used in different raw plastic production. Microplastics are ingested by aquatic creatures such as fish and different crustaceans, and finally, people ingest them at the tertiary level of the food chain. This phenomenon is responsible for blocking the digestion tracts, disturbing the digestive behavior, finally decreasing the reproductive growth of entire living organisms. Because of these consequences, microplastics have become an increasing concern as a newly emerging potential threat, and therefore, the control of microplastics in aquatic media is required. This paper provides a critical analysis of existing and newly developed methods for detecting and separating microplastics from discharged wastewater, which are the ultimate challenges in the microplastic treatment systems. A critical study on the effect of microplastics on aquatic organisms and human health is also discussed. Thus, this analysis provides a complete understanding of entire strategies for detecting and removing microplastics and their associated issues to ensure a waste discharge standard to minimize the ultimate potential impact in aquatic environments.","Dey, Thuhin K; Uddin, Md Elias; Jamal, Mamun",Environ Sci Pollut Res Int,80,2

La pandémie de COVID-19 pourrait affecter leur santé et leur parcours de soin. Cette étude vise à évaluer l’impact de l’épidémie de COVID-19 sur les patients atteints de MC vivant en Europe. Matériels et méthodes Cette étude observationnelle et transversale a été menée sous forme d’un questionnaire en ligne accessible sur un réseau social pour patients du 3 juin 2020 au 7 octobre 2020. Elle concernait des patients adultes d’Allemagne, d’Espagne, de France, d’Italie et du Royaume-Uni vivant avec n’importe quelle MC. Résultats Deux mille huit cent soixante et un patients (n=2861) atteints de MC ont été inclus dans l’étude, dont 75 % (n=2136) de femmes, avec un âge moyen de 54 ans, et le plus souvent atteints d’asthme (22 %, n=619), de diabète de type 2 (16 %, n=467), de maladie pulmonaire obstructive chronique (12 %, n=332) ou de sclérose en plaques (11 %, n=328). Quatre-vingt-neuf pour cent (89 %, n=2538) des patients suivaient un traitement de longue durée. Dix-sept pour cent (17 %, n=433) ont modifié la prise de leur traitement, 30 % (n=132) d’entre eux sans en informer leur médecin. Les consultations médicales ont été fortement impactées : depuis le début de l’épidémie, 30 % (n=872) des patients ont eu des difficultés à trouver un médecin disponible, et depuis la fin du confinement 28 % (n=794) ont consulté leur médecin moins fréquemment (45 %, n=1287, pendant le confinement). Soixante-quinze pour cent (75 %, n=2135) des patients ont vu des consultations ou interventions médicales prévues depuis longtemps annulées en raison de l’épidémie. Parmi ceux-ci, 63 % (n=1343) n’ont pas pu toutes les reprogrammer. Trente-neuf pour cent (39 %, n=1109) considèrent que leur état de santé s’est détérioré en raison de la modification de la gestion de leur maladie pendant le confinement. Trente-quatre pour cent (34 %, n=973) des patients ont eu recours à la téléconsultation : 80 % (n=782) d’entre eux l’ont jugée satisfaisante et 59 % (n=570) étaient prêts à l’utiliser pour le suivi de leur MC à l’avenir. Les patients ont également déclaré manquer d’informations, principalement en ce qui concerne les risques liés aux traitements, et les précautions à prendre lors de leur retour au travail. Quarante-six pour cent (46 %, n=1316) n’étaient pas satisfaits des informations reçues. Conclusion Les changements liés au COVID dans le comportement et les soins médicaux apportés aux patients atteints de MC peuvent avoir des conséquences potentielles sur la santé. Celle-ci doivent être surveillées au mieux afin de s’assurer que les patients atteints de MC ne soient pas les victimes collatérales de l’épidémie.","Astruc, A.; Halioua, B.; Zetlaoui, J.; Harrizi, M.; Bombezin-Domino, A.; Radoszycki, L.",Infectious Diseases Now,80,27

Lateral flow assays (LFAs) have been employed for nucleic acid detection, but they have limited sensitivity and specificity. Here, we used a fusion of catalytically inactive SpCas9 endonuclease and VirD2 relaxase for sensitive, specific nucleic acid detection by LFA. In this assay, the target nucleic acid is amplified with biotinylated oligos. VirD2-dCas9 specifically binds the target sequence via dCas9 and covalently binds to a FAM-tagged oligonucleotide via VirD2. The biotin label and FAM tag are detected by a commercially available LFA. We coupled this system, named Vigilant (VirD2-dCas9 guided and LFA-coupled nucleic acid test), to reverse transcription-recombinase polymerase amplification to detect SARS-CoV2 in clinical samples. Vigilant exhibited a limit of detection of 2.5 copies/µL, comparable to CRISPR-based systems, and showed no cross-reactivity with SARS-CoV1 or MERS. Vigilant offers an easy-to-use, rapid, cost-effective, and robust detection platform for SARS-CoV2.","Marsic, Tin; Ali, Zahir; Tehseen, Muhammad; Mahas, Ahmed; Hamdan, Samir; Mahfouz, Magdy",Nano Lett,80,21

METHODS: An ultra-widefield (UWF) retinal imaging device was installed in the internal medicine department specializing in diabetes to obtain fundus images of patients with diabetes. Remote interpretation was conducted at Nagoya City University using a cloud server. The medical data, severity of retinopathy, and frequency of ophthalmologic visits were analyzed. RESULTS: Four hundred ninety-nine patients (mean age, 62.5 ± 13.4 years) were included. The duration of diabetes in 240 (48.1%) patients was less than 10 years and 433 (86.7%) patients had a hemoglobin (Hb) A1c below 8%. Regarding the retinopathy severity, 360 (72.1%) patients had no diabetic retinopathy (NDR), 63 (12.6%) mild nonproliferative retinopathy (NPDR), 38 (7.64%) moderate NPDR, 13 (2.6%) severe NPDR, and 25 (5.0%) PDR. Two hundred forty-one (48.3%) patients had an ophthalmologic consultation within 1 year, 104 (20.8%) had no history of an ophthalmologic consultation. DR was not present in 86 (82.7%) patients who had never had an ophthalmologic examination, 30 (78.9%) patients with severe NPDR or PDR had had an ophthalmologic visit within 1 year. The frequency of ophthalmic visits was correlated negatively with age, diabetes duration, HbA1c, and severity of retinopathy. CONCLUSION: Remote interpretation of DR using UWF retinal imaging was useful for retinopathy screening. During the COVID-19 pandemic, a remote screening system that can ensure compulsory social distancing and reduce the number of ophthalmic visits can be a safe system for patients and clinicians.","Kato, Aki; Fujishima, Keiichiro; Takami, Kazuhisa; Inoue, Naomi; Takase, Noriaki; Suzuki, Norihiro; Suzuki, Katsuya; Kuwayama, Soichiro; Yamada, Akiko; Sakai, Katsuhisa; Horita, Ryosuke; Nozaki, Miho; Yoshida, Munenori; Hirano, Yoshio; Yasukawa, Tsutomu; Ogura, Yuichiro",Diabetes Res Clin Pract,80,24

Government requirements to stay at home and avoid social and school settings may impact psychological well-being by modifying various behaviors such as problematic phone and Internet use, yet there is a paucity of research on this issue. This study examined whether the COVID-19 outbreak may have impacted problematic smartphone use (PSU), problematic gaming (PG), and psychological distress, specifically the pattern of relationships between PSU, PG, and psychological distress in schoolchildren. METHODS: Longitudinal data on psychological distress, PSU, and PG were collected from 575 children in primary schools in 3 waves: Waves 1 and 2 were conducted before the COVID-19 outbreak and Wave 3 during the outbreak. Cross-lagged panel models were used to examine relationships between factors across the 3 waves. RESULTS: Cross-lagged models found that higher levels of PSU were not significantly related prospectively to greater psychological distress before the COVID-19 outbreak, but this prospective relationship became significant during the COVID-19 outbreak. Whereas PG was associated prospectively with psychological distress before the COVID-19 outbreak (ie, between Waves 1 and 2), this association became nonsignificant during the COVID-19 lockdown (ie, between Waves 2 and 3). CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 outbreak has seemed to change prospective relationships between PSU and psychological distress and PG and psychological distress in schoolchildren. Future research should examine whether restrictions on or information provided to schoolchildren may exacerbate PSUs effects on psychological distress.","Chen, Chao-Ying; Chen, I-Hua; Hou, Wen-Li; Potenza, Marc N; O039,; Brien, Kerry S; Lin, Chung-Ying; Latner, Janet D",Journal of addiction medicine (Online),80,16

Viral pneumonia is a severe complication of COVID-19. AIM: Due to the high prevalence of this disease globally, especially in Iran, the aim of this study was to determine the clinical features of seven patients with probable COVID-19 infected pneumonia in Rasht, North Iran. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this retrospective case series study, we described the clinical, laboratory, and radiological features of seven patients with probable COVID-19 infected pneumonia at Razi Hospital, Rasht, north of Iran, from February 27 to March 16, 2020. RESULTS: In this study, the most common clinical symptoms during hospitalization in patients with COVID-19 were poor appetite (seven cases), dehydration (seven cases), cough (six cases), dyspnea (six cases), fatigue (six cases), fever above 38°C (five cases), myalgia (five cases), Chills (five cases), feeling fever (five cases), sore throat (five cases), and nausea (five cases), respectively. The average body temperature in these patients was 39.32°C. In laboratory findings, erythrocyte sedimentation rate was elevated in three patients. Contrary to most of the evidence, C-reactive protein was not elevated in five patients. All patients received antibiotic and antiviral medications and received symptomatic treatment. Finally, four patients responded to the treatments and were discharged from the hospital; two patients were still hospitalized and only one patient died.

We analyzed the blood serum levels in 30 apparently healthy individuals and in 30 patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection in the southern part of India. The patients showed significantly lower selenium levels of 69.2 ± 8.7 ng/mL than controls 79.1 ± 10.9 ng/mL. The difference was statistically significant (P = 0.0003). Interestingly, the control group showed a borderline level of selenium, suggesting that the level of this micronutrient is not optimum in the population studied. The results of this exploratory study pave the way for further research in a larger population and suggest that selenium supplementation may be helpful in reducing the effects of the virus.","Majeed, Muhammed; Nagabhushanam, Kalyanam; Gowda, Sujay; Mundkur, Lakshmi",Nutrition,80,26

Time-dependent studies showed that the GNVs with a closely packed surface derived from the incomplete and irregular GNVs, but not through the fusion of the GNV precursors. After dialysis in water, the assemblies retained vesicular structures in water, even though GNVs aggregated together, which was initiated by the hydrophobic interactions between the FTEG heads of the surface ligands on GNVs.

The primary target of the SARS-CoV-2 virus is the human lungs governed by the ACE-2 receptor of epithelial type II cells/endothelial cells, which promote modulation of the immune response of host cells through generating cytokine storm, inflammation, severe pneumonia symptoms, and secondary complications such as acute respiratory distress syndrome. Although numerous antiviral and anti-parasitic drugs are under clinical trials to combat this pandemic, to date, neither a specific treatment nor any successful vaccine has been established, urging researchers to identify any potential candidate for combating the disease. Mesenchymal stem cells own self-renewal, differentiation, homing, immunomodulation and remains unaffected by the coronavirus on the virtue of the absence of ACE-2 receptors, indicating that MSC's could be used an ameliorative approach for COVID-19. MSCs have shown to combat the disease via various pathways such as repairing the lung epithelial and endothelial cells, reducing hyperimmune response, maintaining the renin-angiotensin system. Although MSCs-based treatment approaches for COVID-19 is still under consideration with limited data, many human clinical trials of MSC's has been initiated to explore their potential for COVID 19 treatment. The current review summarizes and emphasizes on how MSC's modulate the immune response, can repair the lungs from the impact of the virus, and various aspects of MSC's as a remedial source for COVID-19, to provide better insight for biomedical researchers and for those who are fascinated by stem cells as a therapeutic approach.","Yadav, Pooja; Vats, Ravina; Bano, Afsareen; Bhardwaj, Rashmi",Life Sci,80,26

Because medical treatments for the virus are still emerging and a vaccine is not yet available, state and local governments have sought to limit its spread by enacting various social distancing interventions such as school closures and lockdown, but the effectiveness of these interventions is unknown. We applied an established, semi-mechanistic Bayesian hierarchical model of these interventions on SARS-CoV-2 spread in Europe to the United States, using case fatalities from February 29, 2020 up to April 25, 2020, when some states began reversing their interventions. We estimated the effect of interventions across all states, contrasted the estimated reproduction number, Rt, for each state before and after lockdown, and contrasted predicted future fatalities with actual fatalities as a check on the model's validity. Overall, school closures and lockdown are the only interventions modeled that have a reliable impact on Rt, and lockdown appears to have played a key role in reducing Rt below 1.0. We conclude that reversal of lockdown, without implementation of additional, equally effective interventions, will enable continued, sustained transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in the United States.","Olney, Andrew M; Smith, Jesse; Sen, Saunak; Thomas, Fridtjof; Unwin, H Juliette T",Am. j. epidemiol,80,20

Holding the election in pandemic times caused turnout to drop significantly, but unevenly so across the electorate. We use both aggregate electoral results at the polling station level and individual-level data drawn from a survey we conducted between June and July 2020. If fear of contagion partly explains voters' abstention, this article highlights the contradictory effects of the pandemic on the socioeconomic determinants of voter turnout. On the one hand, the variation in turnout levels by age, which usually is quite significant in France, has considerably decreased in 2020. On the other hand, the differences in turnout levels according to the voters' economic and social status have been reinforced during the pandemic. This analysis of local individual data shows that the health crisis has generated important consequences also on the patterns of social inequalities in political representation.

Further research is needed to determine which mHealth features are required to potentially enhance COPD self-management. AIM: The aim of this study was to explore the potential features of an mHealth intervention for COPD management with healthcare providers (HCPs) and patients with COPD. It could inform the development and successful implementation of mHealth interventions for COPD management. METHODS: This was a qualitative study. We conducted semi-structured individual interviews with HCPs, including nurses, pharmacists and physicians who work directly with patients with COPD. Interviews were also conducted with a diverse sample of patients with COPD. Interview topics included demographics, mHealth usage, the potential use of medical devices and recommendations for features that would enhance an mHealth intervention for COPD management. RESULTS: A total of 40 people, including nurses, physicians and pharmacists, participated. The main recommendations for the proposed mHealth intervention were categorised into two categories: patient interface and HCP interface. The prevalent features suggested for the patient interface include educating patients, collecting baseline data, collecting subjective data, collecting objective data via compatible medical devices, providing a digital action plan, allowing patients to track their progress, enabling family members to access the mHealth intervention, tailoring the features based on the patient's unique needs, reminding patients about critical management tasks and rewarding patients for their positive behaviours. The most common features of the HCP interface include allowing HCPs to track their patients' progress, allowing HCPs to communicate with their patients, educating HCPs and rewarding HCPs. CONCLUSION: This study identifies important potential features so that the most effective, efficient and feasible mHealth intervention can be developed to improve the management of COPD.The reviews of this paper are available via the supplemental material section.","Alwashmi, Meshari F; Fitzpatrick, Beverly; Davis, Erin; Farrell, Jamie; Gamble, John-Michael; Hawboldt, John",Ther Adv Respir Dis,80,24

More than 21 million adults were residing in the study area (42% of the population). We included 115,945 COVID-19 cases diagnosed during the first wave of the pandemic (February-May, 2020); 34.6% of these had been vaccinated against influenza. Three outcomes were considered: hospitalization, death, and intensive care unit (ICU) admission/death. The adjusted relative risk (RR) of being hospitalized in the vaccinated group when compared with the non-vaccinated group was 0.87 (95% CI: 0.86-0.88). This reduction in risk was not confirmed for death (RR = 1.04; 95% CI: 1.01-1.06), or for the combined outcome of ICU admission or death. In conclusion, our study, conducted on the vast majority of the population during the first wave of the pandemic in Italy, showed a 13% statistically significant reduction in the risk of hospitalization in some geographical areas and in the younger population. No impact of seasonal influenza vaccination on COVID-19 prognosis in terms of death and death or ICU admission was estimated.","Massari, Marco; Spila-Alegiani, Stefania; Fabiani, Massimo; Belleudi, Valeria; Trifirò, Gianluca; Kirchmayer, Ursula; Poggi, Francesca Romana; Mancuso, Pamela; Menniti-Ippolito, Francesca; Gini, Rosa; Bartolini, Claudia; Leoni, Olivia; Ercolanoni, Michele; Da-Re, Filippo; Guzzinati, Stefano; Luxi, Nicoletta; Riccardo, Flavia; Giorgi-Rossi, Paolo",,80,20

In this study, a fundamental knowledge gap question is to be resolved by evaluating the differences in biological and pathogenic aspects of SARS-CoV-2 and the changes in SARS-CoV-2 in comparison with the two prior major COV epidemics, SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronaviruses. METHODS: The genome composition, nucleotide analysis, codon usage indices, relative synonymous codons usage, and effective number of codons (ENc) were analyzed in the four structural genes; Spike (S), Envelope (E), membrane (M), and Nucleocapsid (N) genes, and two of the most important nonstructural genes comprising RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and main protease (Mpro) of SARS-CoV-2, Beta-CoV from pangolins, bat SARS, MERS, and SARS CoVs. RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 prefers pyrimidine rich codons to purines. Most high-frequency codons were ending with A or T, while the low frequency and rare codons were ending with G or C. SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins showed 5 to 20 lower ENc values, compared with SARS, bat SARS, and MERS CoVs. This implies higher codon bias and higher gene expression efficiency of SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins. SARS-CoV-2 encoded the highest number of over-biased and negatively biased codons. Pangolin Beta-CoV showed little differences with SARS-CoV-2 ENc values, compared with SARS, bat SARS, and MERS CoV. CONCLUSION: Extreme bias and lower ENc values of SARS-CoV-2, especially in Spike, Envelope, and Mpro genes, are suggestive for higher gene expression efficiency, compared with SARS, bat SARS, and MERS CoVs.","Kandeel, Mahmoud; Ibrahim, Abdelazim; Fayez, Mahmoud; Al-Nazawi, Mohammed",J Med Virol,80,16

It is an immediate priority to develop and test a computer-aided detection (CAD) scheme based on deep learning (DL) to automatically localize and differentiate COVID-19 from community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) on chest X-rays. Therefore, this study aims to develop and test an efficient and accurate deep learning scheme that assists radiologists in automatically recognizing and localizing COVID-19. A retrospective chest X-ray image dataset was collected from open image data and the Xiangya Hospital, which was divided into a training group and a testing group. The proposed CAD framework is composed of two steps with DLs: the Discrimination-DL and the Localization-DL. The first DL was developed to extract lung features from chest X-ray radiographs for COVID-19 discrimination and trained using 3548 chest X-ray radiographs. The second DL was trained with 406-pixel patches and applied to the recognized X-ray radiographs to localize and assign them into the left lung, right lung or bipulmonary. X-ray radiographs of CAP and healthy controls were enrolled to evaluate the robustness of the model. Compared to the radiologists' discrimination and localization results, the accuracy of COVID-19 discrimination using the Discrimination-DL yielded 98.71%, while the accuracy of localization using the Localization-DL was 93.03%. This work represents the feasibility of using a novel deep learning-based CAD scheme to efficiently and accurately distinguish COVID-19 from CAP and detect localization with high accuracy and agreement with radiologists.","Wang, Zheng; Xiao, Ying; Li, Yong; Zhang, Jie; Lu, Fanggen; Hou, Muzhou; Liu, Xiaowei",Pattern Recognit,80,24

There were countries where the COVID-19 peak occurred during extremely low temperatures, such as Norway, Canada and on the other hand there were countries with high-temperature ranges such as Brazil, India, UAE. Most of the high-latitude countries received their outbreak in winter and most of the countries near the equator mark the outbreak during the summer. Most of the biological organisms have their growth dependant on the temperature, and hence we explored that if there is any relation of temperature versus COVID-19 outbreak in the particular country. It was also seen that people are not behaving differently during the peak of the COVID-19 wave, hence it was important to know whether the COVID-19 virus has evolved or the global temperature variation caused these multiple peaks. This work focuses on finding the effect of temperature variation on the COVID-19 outbreak. We used Levenberg-Marquardt technique to find the correlation between the temperature at which COVID-19 outbreak peaks and the latitude of the particular country. We found that between the temperature range of 14 {degrees}C to 20 {degrees}C spread of the COVID-19 is minimal. Based on our results we can also say that the COVID-19 outbreak is seen in lower temperature (0 {degrees}C to 13 {degrees}C) ranges as well as in the higher temperature ranges (21 {degrees}C to 35 {degrees}C). The current data analysis will help the authorities to manage their resources in advance to prepare for any further outbreaks that might occur in the COVID-19 or even in the next pandemic.","Jain, Mayuri; Aloni, Sukhada; Adivarekar, Pravin",,80,7

In a context of restrictions on movement outside the home in both countries, and where alcohol providers are trying to find new ways to reach their customers, this may lead to an intensification of the social and health harms associated with home drinking. By examining the current situation in both Australia and the UK, we argue that heightened risks from home drinking amid COVID-19 bring into sharp focus long-standing weaknesses within licensing systems in both countries: the regulation of off-premise outlets to minimise harms from drinking at home. We call for critical conversations on how licensing systems should be revised to take more responsibility for protecting people from the health and social harms associated with home drinking, both under COVID-19 and in the future.","Reynolds, Joanna; Wilkinson, Claire",Drug Alcohol Rev,80,32

COVID-19 pandemic generated an opportunity to study the impact of face masks and confinement on droplet transmission diseases, usually implicated in acute exacerbations of COPD (AECOPD). We aimed to evaluate the variation on severe AECOPD (sAECOPD) rate in a Portuguese COPD cohort during the first COVID-19 lockdown and following months. This retrospective self-controlled study enrolled 322 adult patients followed at COPD-specialized consultation in a tertiary hospital from February 2016 to July 2020, of whom 286 met inclusion criteria. Severe AECOPD events were registered from March 2020 (beginning of state of emergency) until July 2020. From 2016 to 2019 there was a mean of 38 patients per year with sAECOPD. During 2020, 11 patients experienced sAECOPD. Over the course of 2020 there was a 73.4% (p < 0.001) decrease in sAECOPD events comparing with previous years' average. After the end of State of Emergency, the rate of sAECOPD events also declined by 74.6% (p < 0.001) comparing with the same timeline of previous years. Results were consistent and statistically significant when comparing 2020 with each of previous years for every period of analysis. Our findings suggest a sustained decrease in the rate of sAECOPD during confinement and in the following months. The widespread use of face mask and social distancing during COVID-19 pandemic may play an important role in preventing the transmission of respiratory infections and consequently reducing sAECOPD.","Faria, Nuno; Costa, Maria Inês; Gomes, Joana; Sucena, Maria",COPD,80,6

During the COVID-19 pandemic the question arises if laparoscopy, as an aerosol forming procedure, poses a potential risk for viral transmission of SARS-CoV-2 to healthcare workers. Methods. A literature search was conducted using PubMed, Embase and MEDLINE. Articles reporting information regarding COVID-19 or other relevant viruses and laparoscopy, surgical smoke, aerosols and viral transmission were included. Results. Although aerosols produced during laparoscopy do not originate from the respiratory tract, the main transmission route of SARS-CoV-2, research did show SARS-CoV-2 to be present in other body fluids. The transmission risk via this route is however considered very low. As previous research showed potential viral transmission during laparoscopy for viruses that spread through contaminated body fluids, there might be a potential risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission during laparoscopy, albeit considered very small. Conclusion. Due to the small risk compared to widely known benefits of laparoscopy, there is no reason to replace laparoscopy by laparotomy due to COVID-19 infection. To avoid the potential small risk of viral transmission, additional safety measures are advised.","Tummers, Fokkedien Hmp; Draaisma, Werner A; Demirkiran, Ahmet; Brouwer, Tammo A; Lagerveld, Brunolf W; van Schrojenstein Lantman, Esther S; Spijkers, Klaartje; Coppus, Sjors Fpj; Jansen, Frank Willem",Surg Innov,80,16

The emerging clinical reality is that methanol poisoning around the globe has claimed increasingly large numbers of deaths largely due to the press of poverty and the delay in suspecting and diagnosing methanol toxicity. With the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, false beliefs about methanol's preventive potential vs viral infection of have arisen. In March of this year, more than 300 Iranians died and 1000 became ill after consuming methanol in the hope that it would protect them against the novel coronavirus. We review the context and magnitude of methanol toxicity, pathophysiology, principal medical issues, and human variability in metabolism. While toxicologists and clinicians may need to be especially attentive to this problem, it is becoming clear that the social and economic underpinnings of the methanol poisoning crisis must be actively and urgently explored and managed as vigorously as its toxicologic and pathophysiologic components.","Pressman, Peter; Clemens, Roger; Sahu, Saura; Hayes, A Wallace",Cutan Ocul Toxicol,80,16

This algorithm can obtain new and relevant information from extremely limited and poor datasets. In a world dominated by the concept of big (fat?) data we want to show that it is possible, by necessity or choice, to work profitably even on small data. This peculiarity of the algorithm means that even in the early stages of an epidemic process, when the data are too few to have sufficient statistics, it is possible to obtain important information. To prove our theory, we addressed one of the most central issues at the moment: the COVID-19 epidemic. In particular, the cases recorded in Italy have been selected. Italy seems to have a central role in this epidemic because of the high number of measured infections. Through this innovative artificial intelligence algorithm, we have tried to analyze the evolution of the phenomenon and to predict its future steps using a dataset that contained only geospatial coordinates (longitude and latitude) of the first recorded cases. Once the coordinates of the places where at least one case of contagion had been officially diagnosed until February 26th, 2020 had been collected, research and analysis was carried out on: outbreak point and related heat map (TWC alpha); probability distribution of the contagion on February 26th (TWC beta); possible spread of the phenomenon in the immediate future and then in the future of the future (TWC gamma and TWC theta); how this passage occurred in terms of paths and mutual influence (Theta paths and Markov Machine). Finally, a heat map of the possible situation towards the end of the epidemic in terms of infectiousness of the areas was drawn up. The analyses with TWC confirm the assumptions made at the beginning.","Buscema, Paolo Massimo; Della Torre, Francesca; Breda, Marco; Massini, Giulia; Grossi, Enzo",Phys A Stat Mech Appl,80,24

Older people, who already experience higher rates of social isolation and loneliness, are more susceptible to adverse effects as a result of the social distancing protocols enacted to slow the spread of COVID-19. Based on prior outbreaks, we speculate the detrimental outcomes and offer solutions. METHODS: Reviewing the literature on the detrimental effects of social isolation and loneliness and higher mortality in the older population. Utilizing psychological study outcomes from prior major outbreaks such as in SARS, Ebola, H1N1 influenza, and Middle East respiratory syndrome offer predictions and the susceptibility in the geriatric age group. RESULTS: Organizations such as the WHO, Centers for Disease Control, and American Association of Retired Persons have put measures in place to provide networking on a local, regional, and national level. These efforts are designed to start mitigating such detrimental effects. A necessary follow-up to this pandemic will be gathering data on unique populations such as the geriatric community, to better mitigate adverse outcomes given the certainty that COVID-19 will not be the last global viral outbreak. CONCLUSIONS: The results of worsened social isolation and loneliness is associated with significantly increased morbidity and mortality in the geriatric population. Various solutions including virtual interactions with loved ones, engaging in physical activity, continuing any spiritual or religious prayers remotely, and community services to provide aid for the older population are all efforts to minimize social isolation and loneliness.","Roy, Justin; Jain, Rohit; Golamari, Reshma; Vunnam, Rama; Sahu, Nitasa",Int. j. geriatr. psychiatry,80,25

It is possible that the housing conditions in which children and their families experienced the confinement, and the adoption of healthy behaviors, may have followed unequal patterns. The aim was to describe social inequalities in housing conditions and in health-related behaviors among children during the lockdown in Spain. This cross-sectional study was based on data from an online survey collecting information on the child population (3-12 years) living in Spain (n = 10,765). The outcome variables used were several housing conditions and health-related behaviors. The socioeconomic variables used were financial difficulties and parents' educational level. Crude prevalence and prevalence ratios estimated using Poisson models were calculated. During lockdown, children from families with low educational levels and financial difficulties not only tended to live in poor housing conditions, but were also exposed to negative health determinants such as noise and tobacco smoke;they took less physical exercise, had a poorer diet, spent more time in front of screens and had less social contact. A notable social gradient was found in most of the variables analyzed. The results point to the need to incorporate the perspective of equity in the adoption of policies in order to avoid the increase of pre-existing social inequalities in the context of a pandemic.","Gonzalez-Rabago, Y.; Cabezas-Rodriguez, A.; Martin, U.",International Journal of Environmental Research &amp; Public Health [Electronic Resource],80,1

It was already shown to inhibit growth and pathogenic mechanisms of a variety of enveloped RNA viruses and it was now found that circulating H2S is higher in Covid 19 survivors compared to fatal cases. H2S release is triggered by carbon monoxide (CO) from the catabolism of heme by inducible heme oxygenase (HO-1) and heme proteins possess catalytic activity necessary for the H2S signalling by protein persulfidation. Subjects with a long promoter for the HMOX1 gene, coding for HO-1, are predicted for lower efficiency of this mechanism. SARS-cov-2 exerts ability to attack the heme of hemoglobin and other heme-proteins thus hampering both release and signalling of H2S. Lack of H2S-induced persulfidation of the KATP channels of leucocytes causes adhesion and release of the inflammatory cytokines, lung infiltration and systemic endothelial damage with hyper-coagulability. These events largely explain the sex and age distribution, clinical manifestations and co-morbidities of Covid-19. The understanding of this mechanism may be of guidance in re-evaluating the ongoing therapeutic strategies, with special attention to the interaction with mechanical ventilation, paracetamol and chloroquine use, and in the individuation of genetic traits causing increased susceptibility to the disruption of these physiologic processes and to a critical Covid 19. Finally, an array of therapeutic interventions with the potential to clinically modulate the HO-1/CO/H2S axis is already available or under development. These include CO donors and H2S donors and a boost to the endogenous production of H2S is also possible.","Dattilo, Maurizio",Mol Med,80,1

However, review of recent literature shows this association to be debatable. The 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels in the initial phase of critical illness have been reported to drop rapidly and hence consideration of the time of measurement from symptom onset would have enhanced the clinical relevance of these findings. Inferred association between vitamin D levels and disease severity based on SOFA score in COVID-19 patients, needs to be further explored in the light of the recent literature which casts doubt on using SOFA score at admission to predict mortality in COVID-19.","Lohia, Prateek; Kapur, Shweta; Patel, Pragnesh; Seyoum, Berhane",Respir Res,80,30

Using a mouse model closely recapitulating key alterations of chronic human MTLE with hippocampal sclerosis, here we asked whether death of astrocytes contributes to the initiation of the disease and investigated potential underlying molecular mechanisms. METHODS: Antibody staining was combined with confocal imaging and semiquantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis to identify markers of different cellular death mechanisms between 4 h and 3 days after epilepsy induction. RESULTS: Four hours after kainate-mediated induction of status epilepticus (SE), we found a significant reduction in the density of astrocytes in the CA1 stratum radiatum (SR) of the ipsilateral hippocampus. This reduction was transient, as within the next 3 days, astrocyte cell numbers recovered to the initial values, which was accompanied by enhanced proliferation. Four hours after SE induction, a small proportion of astrocytes in the ipsilateral CA1 SR expressed autophagy-related genes and proteins, whereas we did not find astrocytes positive for cleaved caspase 3 or terminal deoxynucleotide transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate nick-end labeling, ruling out apoptosis-related astrocytic death. Importantly, at the same early time point post-SE, many astrocytes in the ipsilateral CA1 SR showed strong expression of genes encoding pro-necroptosis factors, including receptor-interacting protein kinase 3 (RIPK3) and mixed lineage kinase domain-like protein (MLKL). Phosphorylation of MLKL (pMLKL), formation of necrosome complexes composed of RIPK3 and pMLKL, and translocation of pMLKL to the nucleus and to the plasma membrane were often observed in astrocytes of the ipsilateral hippocampus 4 h post-SE. SIGNIFICANCE: The present study revealed that astrocytes die shortly after induction of SE. Our expression data and immunohistochemistry suggest that necroptosis and autophagy contribute to astrocytic death. These findings help to better understand how dysfunctional and pathological remodeling of astrocytes contributes to the initiation of temporal lobe epilepsy.","Wu, Zhou; Deshpande, Tushar; Henning, Lukas; Bedner, Peter; Seifert, Gerald; Steinhäuser, Christian",Epilepsia,80,24

Specifically, we systematically reviewed 68 peer-reviewed articles extracted based on rigorous selection criteria from Scopus, PubMed and ISI Web of Science databases and published between December 2019 and February 2021. Our results reveal that livestock supply chains presented an important ‘intermediary’ pathway through which the pandemic affected various dimensions of food security in developing countries. Although the research response has been rapid in terms of both quantity and temporal succession, we find a highly suggestive disjunction in studies analyzing the interconnections between COVID-19 pandemic, livestock systems and food security in developing countries. With respect to the livestock supply chain, the bulk of the reviewed evidence focuses on production and consumption, whereas considerably less focus is given to the pandemic’s impact on intermediaries within livestock chains, including traders, intermediaries and processors. The analysis of livestock supply chain resilience revolves predominantly around the ‘absorbance’ and ‘recovery’ phases of resilience, whereas only a small subset of the literature investigates actions taken by supply chain actors to ‘plan’ or to ‘adapt’ livestock systems in order to reduce their vulnerability and enhance their overall resilience. Furthermore, food security has often been narrowly defined, with the majority of articles focusing on ‘availability’ and ‘accessibility’ to food due to the pandemic, and other dimensions of food security, including utilization, stability and sustainability, have been widely neglected. Based on our findings, we recommend future research to examine the dynamics of propagation of COVID-19 impact through livestock supply chains in order to develop more targeted interventions that enhance the capacity of developing countries to cope with this and future disruptions and mitigate their food insecurity outcomes. To this end, more holistic, integrated and resilience-based approaches are much recommended to recognize the complex nature of livestock systems in developing countries and to address the multifaceted and widespread effects of COVID-19 on food security channeled through livestock chains.","Abu Hatab, Assem Krautscheid Lena Boqvist Sofia",Pathogens,80,29

Vaccine acceptance among the general public and healthcare workers appears to have a decisive role in the successful control of the pandemic. The aim of this review was to provide an up-to-date assessment of COVID-19 vaccination acceptance rates worldwide. A systematic search of the peer-reviewed English survey literature indexed in PubMed was done on 25 December 2020. Results from 31 peer-reviewed published studies met the inclusion criteria and formed the basis for the final COVID-19 vaccine acceptance estimates. Survey studies on COVID-19 vaccine acceptance rates were found from 33 different countries. Among adults representing the general public, the highest COVID-19 vaccine acceptance rates were found in Ecuador (97.0%), Malaysia (94.3%), Indonesia (93.3%) and China (91.3%). However, the lowest COVID-19 vaccine acceptance rates were found in Kuwait (23.6%), Jordan (28.4%), Italy (53.7), Russia (54.9%), Poland (56.3%), US (56.9%), and France (58.9%). Only eight surveys among healthcare workers (doctors and nurses) were found, with vaccine acceptance rates ranging from 27.7% in the Democratic Republic of the Congo to 78.1% in Israel. In the majority of survey studies among the general public stratified per country (29/47, 62%), the acceptance of COVID-19 vaccination showed a level of &#8805;70%. Low rates of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance were reported in the Middle East, Russia, Africa and several European countries. This could represent a major problem in the global efforts to control the current COVID-19 pandemic. More studies are recommended to address the scope of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. Such studies are particularly needed in the Middle East and North Africa, Sub-Saharan Africa, Eastern Europe, Central Asia, Middle and South America. Addressing the scope of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy in various countries is recommended as an initial step for building trust in COVID-19 vaccination efforts.","Sallam, Malik",,80,22

METHODS: Systematic literature search from several electronic databases were performed. The outcome was mortality (non-survivor) in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. NT-proBNP data were in continuous variable (pg/mL), dichotomous data (elevated/non-elevated) and effect estimate adjusted to cardiac injury/elevated biomarkers of cardiac injury. RESULTS: A total of 967 patients from six studies were included in this analysis. NT-proBNP was higher in non-survivor group (standardised mean difference 0.75 (0.44, 1.07), p<0.001; I2: 61%). Elevated NT-proBNP was associated with increased mortality (RR 3.63 (92.21, 5.95), p<0.001; I2: 60%). Sensitivity analysis by removing a study reduces heterogeneity (risk ratio 3.47 (2.36, 5.11), p<0.001; I2: 49%). Pooled adjusted HR (adjusted to cardiac injury/elevated biomarkers of cardiac injury) showed that elevated NT-proBNP was independently associated with mortality (HR 1.37 (1.19, 1.57), p<0.001; I2: 0%, p=0.77). Pooled analysis of multiple cut-off point resulted in a sensitivity of 76% (46%-92%) and specificity of 88% (71%-96%). Summary receiver operating characteristic curve analysis demonstrates an area under curve of 0.90 (0.87-0.93). Elevated NT-proBNP has a likelihood ratio (LR) +6.4 and LR -0.3. CONCLUSION: Elevated NT-proBNP level was associated with increased mortality in COVID-19 pneumonia.","Pranata, Raymond; Huang, Ian; Lukito, Antonia Anna; Raharjo, Sunu Budhi",Postgrad Med J,80,26

At present, the diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is made through a nasopharyngeal swab based on reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) technique. However, some recent studies suggested the possible role of oral fluids and saliva in the detection of SARS-CoV-2. The purpose of this scoping review is evaluating the available evidence regarding the efficacy of saliva as a diagnostic specimen in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: A systematic literature review of six databases (PubMed, Scopus, The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials [CENTRAL], Science Direct, Web of Science and Google scholar) was carried out without any restrictions on date of publication to identify the reliability of saliva as a diagnostic specimen for detection of SARS-CoV-2 in suspected patients. RESULTS: Nine eligible articles were included in this review based on our described method. All the included studies are based on clinical surveys among patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Most of studies included in this review, reported that there is no statistically significant difference between nasopharyngeal or sputum specimens and saliva samples regarding viral load. CONCLUSIONS: Despite limitations of this study, the findings of this review suggest that the use of self-collected saliva as a non-invasive specimen has proper accuracy and reliability regarding detection of SARS-CoV-2 based on RT-PCR technique.","Fakheran, Omid; Dehghannejad, Mandana; Khademi, Abbasali",Infect Dis Poverty,80,1

Development of a wider range of vaccines, with different mechanisms of action, could help control the spread of SARS-CoV-2 globally. We developed a protein subunit vaccine against COVID-19 using a dimeric form of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein as the antigen. We aimed to assess the safety and immunogenicity of this vaccine, ZF2001, and determine the appropriate dose and schedule for an efficacy study. METHODS: We did two randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 1 and phase 2 trials. Phase 1 was done at two university hospitals in Chongqing and Beijing, China, and phase 2 was done at the Hunan Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention in Xiangtan, China. Healthy adults aged 18-59 years, without a history of SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 infection, an RT-PCR-positive test result for SARS-CoV-2, a history of contact with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 cases, and severe allergies to any component of the vaccine were eligible for enrolment. In phase 1, participants were randomly assigned (2:2:1) to receive three doses of the vaccine (25 µg or 50 µg) or placebo intramuscularly, 30 days apart. In phase 2, participants were randomly assigned (1:1:1:1:1:1) to receive the vaccine (25 µg or 50 µg) or placebo intramuscularly, 30 days apart, in either a two-dose schedule or a three-dose schedule. Investigators, participants, and the laboratory team were masked to group allocation. For phase 1, the primary outcome was safety, measured by the occurrence of adverse events and serious adverse events. For phase 2, the primary outcome was safety and immunogenicity (the seroconversion rate and the magnitude, in geometric mean titres [GMTs], of SARS-CoV-2-neutralising antibodies). Analyses were done on an intention-to-treat and per-protocol basis. These trials are registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04445194 and NCT04466085) and participant follow-up is ongoing. FINDINGS: Between June 22 and July 3, 2020, 50 participants were enrolled into the phase 1 trial and randomly assigned to receive three doses of placebo (n=10), the 25 µg vaccine (n=20), or the 50 µg vaccine (n=20). The mean age of participants was 32·6 (SD 9·4) years. Between July 12 and July 17, 2020, 900 participants were enrolled into the phase 2 trial and randomly assigned to receive two doses of placebo (n=150), 25 µg vaccine (n=150), or 50 µg vaccine (n=150), or three doses of placebo (n=150), 25 µg vaccine (n=150), or 50 µg vaccine (n=150). The mean age of participants was 43·5 (SD 9·2) years. In both phase 1 and phase 2, adverse events reported within 30 days after vaccination were mild or moderate (grade 1 or 2) in most cases (phase 1: six [60%] of ten participants in the placebo group, 14 [70%] of 20 in the 25 µg group, and 18 [90%] of 20 in the 50 µg group; phase 2: 37 [25%] of 150 in the two-dose placebo group, 43 [29%] of 150 in the two-dose 25 µg group, 50 [33%] of 150 in the two-dose 50 µg group, 47 [31%] of 150 in the three-dose placebo group, 72 [48%] of 150 in the three-dose 25 µg group, and 65 [43%] of 150 in the three-dose 50 µg group). In phase 1, two (10%) grade 3 or worse adverse events were reported in the 50 µg group. In phase 2, grade 3 or worse adverse events were reported by 18 participants (four [3%] in the two-dose 25 µg vaccine group, two [1%] in the two-dose 50 µg vaccine group, two [1%] in the three-dose placebo group, four [3%] in the three-dose 25 µg vaccine group, and six [4%] in the three-dose 50 µg vaccine group), and 11 were considered vaccine related (two [1%] in the two-dose 25 µg vaccine group, one [1%] in the two-dose 50 µg vaccine group, one [1%] in the three-dose placebo group, two [1%] in the three-dose 25 µg vaccine group, and five [3%] in the three-dose 50 µg vaccine group); seven participants reported serious adverse events (one [1%] in the two-dose 25 µg vaccine group, one [1%] in the two-dose 50 µg vaccine group, two [1%] in the three-dose placebo group, one [1%] in the three-dose 25 µg vaccine group, and two [1%] in the three-dose 50 µg vaccine group), but none was considered vaccine related. In phase 2, on the two-dose schedule, seroconversion rates of neutralising antibodies 14 days after the second dose were 76% (114 of 150 participants) in the 25 µg group and 72% (108 of 150) in the 50 µg group; on the three-dose schedule, seroconversion rates of neutralising antibodies 14 days after the third dose were 97% (143 of 148 participants) in the 25 µg group and 93% (138 of 148) in the 50 µg group. In the two-dose groups in phase 2, the SARS-CoV-2-neutralising GMTs 14 days after the second dose were 17·7 (95% CI 13·6-23·1) in the 25 µg group and 14·1 (10·8-18·3) in the 50 µg group. In the three-dose groups in phase 2, the SARS-CoV-2-neutralising GMTs 14 days after the third dose were 102·5 (95% CI 81·8-128·5) in the 25 µg group and 69·1 (53·0-90·0) in the 50 µg group. INTERPRETATION: The protein subunit vaccine ZF2001 appears to be well tolerated and immunogenic. The safety and immunogenicity data from the phase 1 and 2 trials support the use of the 25 µg dose in a three-dose schedule in an ongoing phase 3 trial for large-scale evaluation of ZF2001's safety and efficacy.

However, excessive intake may lead to adverse effects in the body. Since F is absorbed mostly from the gastrointestinal tract (GIT), gastrointestinal symptoms are the first signs following acute F exposure. Nevertheless, little is known about the mechanistic events that lead to these symptoms. Therefore, the present study evaluated changes in the proteomic profile as well as morphological changes in the jejunum and ileum of rats upon acute exposure to F. Male rats received, by gastric gavage, a single dose of F containing 0 (control) or 25 mg/Kg for 30 days. Upon exposure to F, there was a decrease in the thickness of the tunic muscularis for both segments and a decrease in the thickness of the wall only for the ileum. In addition, a decrease in the density of HuC/D-IR neurons and nNOS-IR neurons was found for the jejunum, but for the ileum only nNOS-IR neurons were decreased upon F exposure. Moreover, SP-IR varicosities were increased in both segments, while VIP-IR varicosities were increased in the jejunum and decreased in the ileum. As for the proteomic analysis, the proteins with altered expression were mostly negatively regulated and associated mainly with protein synthesis and energy metabolism. Proteomics also revealed alterations in proteins involved in oxidative/antioxidant defense, apoptosis and as well as in cytoskeletal proteins. Our results, when analyzed together, suggest that the gastrointestinal symptoms found in cases of acute F exposure might be related to the morphological alterations in the gut (decrease in the thickness of the tunica muscularis) that, at the molecular level, can be explained by alterations in the gut vipergic innervation and in proteins that regulate the cytoskeleton.","Dionizio, Aline; Melo, Carina Guimarães Souza; Sabino-Arias, Isabela Tomazini; Araujo, Tamara Teodoro; Ventura, Talita Mendes Oliveira; Leite, Aline Lima; Souza, Sara Raquel Garcia; Santos, Erika Xavier; Heubel, Alessandro Domingues; Souza, Juliana Gadelha; Perles, Juliana Vanessa Colombo Martins; Zanoni, Jacqueline Nelisis; Buzalaf, Marília Afonso Rabelo",Sci Total Environ,80,1

It is thus necessary to ensure that it is well-connected, efficient, and robust. Despite extensive research on its topology, the temporal evolution of the network's robustness and tolerance remains largely unexplored. In the present paper, a temporal study of the domestic U.S. ATN was performed based on annual flight data from 1996 to 2016 and network analytics were used to examine the effects of restructuring that followed the 9/11 events along with the current state of the system. Centrality measures were computed to assess the system's topology and its global robustness. A node deletion method was applied to assess the network's tolerance by simulating a targeted attack scenario. The study showed that the 9/11 terrorist attacks triggered vast restructuring of the network, in terms of efficiency and security. Air traffic expanded, as new airports and air routes were introduced. Airlines reconsidered their strategy and optimized their operations, thus allowing the network to recover rapidly and become even more efficient. Security concerns resulted in significant improvement of the network's robustness. Since 2001, the global traffic and topological properties of the U.S. ATN have displayed continuous growth, due to the network's expansion. On the other hand, the robustness of the system has not shown an improving tendency. Findings suggest that although the system's ability to sustain its operational level under extreme circumstances has lately improved, its tolerance to targeted attacks has deteriorated. The presented methodology may be applied on different network levels or different transportation networks, to provide a general perspective of the system's vulnerabilities.","Siozos-Rousoulis, Leonidas; Robert, Dimitri; Verbeke, Wouter",,80,1

Here, we determined the viral dynamics and antibody responses among 143 asymptomatic individuals identified in a massive screening of more than 5 million people in eight districts of Wuhan in May 2020. Asymptomatic individuals were admitted to the government-designated centralized sites in accordance with policy. The incidence rate of asymptomatic infection is ~2.92/100,000. These individuals had low viral copy numbers (peaked at 315 copies/mL) and short-lived antibody responses with the estimated diminish time of 69 days. The antibody responses in individuals with persistent SARS-CoV-2 infection is much longer with the estimated diminish time of 257 days. These results imply that the immune responses in the asymptomatic individuals are not potent enough for preventing SARS-CoV-2 re-infection, which has recently been reported in recovered COVID-19 patients. This casts doubt on the efficacy of forming ""herd-immunity"" through natural SARS-CoV-2 infection and urges for the development of safe and effective vaccines.","Sui, Zhiwei; Dai, Xinhua; Lu, Qingbin; Zhang, Yulan; Huang, Min; Li, Shufen; Peng, Tao; Xie, Jie; Zhang, Yongzhuo; Wu, Chunchen; Xia, Jianbo; Dong, Lianhua; Yang, Jiayi; Huang, Wenfeng; Liu, Siyuan; Wang, Ziquan; Li, Ke; Yang, Qingfang; Zhou, Xi; Wu, Ying; Liu, Wei; Fang, Xiang; Peng, Ke",Signal Transduct Target Ther,80,26

These new problems further compound the already existing problem of limited medical student exposure to the field of physical medicine and rehabilitation, particularly for students in medical schools lacking a department of physical medicine and rehabilitation, approximately 50% of medical schools. A virtual medical student physical medicine and rehabilitation rotation was created to mitigate coronavirus 2019-related limitations and impact on medical education. Using audiovisual technology, students had the opportunity to participate in clinical inpatient and outpatient care, live-streamed procedures, and virtual didactics, develop and showcase their clinical knowledge and reasoning skills, and become familiar with the culture of the physical medicine and rehabilitation residency program. Adaptive educational approaches, including integration of the flipped classroom model, success, pitfalls, and areas for improvement will be described and discussed. Providing nontraditional methods for physical medicine and rehabilitation education and exposure to medical students is crucial to maintain and promote growth of the field in this unprecedented and increasingly virtual era.","Huang, Laura Y; McKenty, Nathan; Alvarez, Armando; Gober, Joslyn; Irwin, Robert; Molinares, Diana; Price, Chane; Sherman, Andrew; Tiu, Timothy; Gater, David R",Am J Phys Med Rehabil,80,16

A feline coronavirus antiviral drug, GC376, has been shown to be effective in inhibiting the SARS-CoV-2 main protease and live virus growth. As this drug moves into clinical trials, further characterization of GC376 with the main protease of coronaviruses is required to gain insight into the drug's properties, such as reversibility and broad specificity. Reversibility is an important factor for therapeutic proteolytic inhibitors to prevent toxicity due to off-target effects. Here we demonstrate that GC376 has nanomolar Ki values with the Mpro from both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV strains. Restoring enzymatic activity after inhibition by GC376 demonstrates reversible binding with both proteases. In addition, the stability and thermodynamic parameters of both proteases were studied to shed light on physical chemical properties of these viral enzymes, revealing higher stability for SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. The comparison of a new X-ray crystal structure of Mpro from SARS-CoV complexed with GC376 reveals similar molecular mechanism of inhibition compared to SARS-CoV-2 Mpro, and gives insight into the broad specificity properties of this drug. In both structures, we observe domain swapping of the N-termini in the dimer of the Mpro, which facilitates coordination of the drug's P1 position. These results validate that GC376 is a drug with an off-rate suitable for clinical trials.","Arutyunova, Elena; Khan, Muhammad Bashir; Fischer, Conrad; Lu, Jimmy; Lamer, Tess; Vuong, Wayne; van Belkum, Marco J; McKay, Ryan T; Tyrrell, D Lorne; Vederas, John C; Young, Howard S; Lemieux, M Joanne",J Mol Biol,80,24

MAFLD encompasses different disease stadia ranging from isolated liver steatosis to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), fibrosis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Although MAFLD is considered as the hepatic manifestation of the metabolic syndrome, multiple concomitant disease-potentiating factors can accelerate disease progression. Among these risk factors are diet, lifestyle, genetic traits, intake of steatogenic drugs, male gender and particular infections. Although infections often outweigh the development of fatty liver disease, pre-existing MAFLD could be triggered to progress towards more severe disease stadia. These combined disease cases might be underreported because of the high prevalence of both MAFLD and infectious diseases that can promote or exacerbate fatty liver disease development. In this review, we portray the molecular and cellular mechanisms by which the most relevant viral, bacterial and parasitic infections influence the progression of fatty liver disease and steatohepatitis. We focus in particular on how infectious diseases, including coronavirus disease-19, hepatitis C, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, peptic ulcer and periodontitis, exacerbate MAFLD.

Several COVID-19 guidelines included age as an explicit factor and practices of both triage and 'anticipatory triage' likely limited access to hospital care for elderly patients, especially those in care homes. To ensure the legitimacy of triage guidelines, which affect the public, it is important to engage the public's moral intuitions. Our study aimed to explore general public views in the UK on the role of age, and related factors like frailty and quality of life, in triage during the COVID-19 pandemic. We held online deliberative workshops with members of the general public (n=22). Participants were guided through a deliberative process to maximise eliciting informed and considered preferences. Participants generally accepted the need for triage but strongly rejected 'fair innings' and 'life projects' principles as justifications for age-based allocation. They were also wary of the 'maximise life-years' principle, preferring to maximise the number of lives rather than life years saved. Although they did not arrive at a unified recommendation of one principle, a concern for three core principles and values eventually emerged: equality, efficiency and vulnerability. While these remain difficult to fully respect at once, they captured a considered, multifaceted consensus: utilitarian considerations of efficiency should be tempered with a concern for equality and vulnerability. This 'triad' of ethical principles may be a useful structure to guide ethical deliberation as societies negotiate the conflicting ethical demands of triage.","Kuylen, Margot N I; Kim, Scott Y; Ruck Keene, Alexander; Owen, Gareth S",J. med. ethics,80,6

METHODS: The markers of liver injury, severity of disease and prognosis among 495 COVID-19 patients in Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University from 1st January 2019 to 11th March 2019 were retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS: The levels of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (50.1 ± 38.4 vs. 31.4 ± 39.1, P < 0.001), gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) (70.3 ± 70.2 vs. 34.1 ± 34.7, P < 0.001) and fibrinogen-to-albumin-ratio (FAR) (13.4 ± 4.0 vs. 10.4 ± 3.4, P < 0.001) were greater than mild COVID-19 patients, whereas the levels of albumin(35.0 ± 6.2 vs. 39.9 ± 3.7, P < 0.001) and albumin/globulin (A/G) ratio (1.21 ± 0.24 vs. 1.50 ± 0.31, P < 0.001) were lower in severe COVID-19 patients. By comparing the changes of liver injury markers 7-10 days after hospitalization, the level of albumin deteriorated from 35.0 ± 6.2 to 30.20 ± 5.5 (P < 0.001), A/G ratio from 1.21 ± 0.24 to 1.06 ± 0.25 (P < 0.001), and FAR from 13.4 ± 4.0 to 15.4 ± 2.9(P < 0.001) in severe COVID-19 patients, while the changes of albumin, A/G ratio and FAR showed opposite patterns in mild COVID-19 patients. FAR > 12 [2.566 (1.410-4.670), P = 0.012) on admission and changes of albumin >5g/l [22.489 (6.422-78.757), P = 0.001] were two risk factors for death, and the sensitivity and specificity for the poor prognosis were 80.8% and 64.0%, 82.6% and 76.3%, respectively. CONCLUSION: The levels of AST, GGT, albumin and FAR are correlated with disease severity after severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 infection. FAR > 12 on admission and changes of albumin > 5 g/l were good predictors for the prognosis of COVID-19 patients.","Yang, Rongrong; Gui, Xien; Ke, Hengning; Gao, Shicheng; Luo, Mingqi; Xiong, Yong",Eur. j. gastroenterol. hepatol,80,20

Participants of this retrospective cohort study were obstetrics patients with suspected COVID-19 who underwent an RT-PCR test in a tertiary hospital in Madrid, Spain. Maternal-perinatal features were analysed according to the results of this test. Clinical, radiological and analytical characteristics that could be associated with a negative result were also explored. In a final subgroup analysis, patients were included if they had pneumonia and a negative test result for the virus. Out of the 111 obstetric patients with suspected COVID-19 that were enrolled, 38.7% returned a negative result. In this RT-PCR-negative group, we recorded lower rates of pneumonia (21.4% vs. 45.6%, p = 0.009), severe or critical clinical features (4.7% vs. 11.8% and 0.0% vs. 5.9%, p = 0.02, respectively), lower lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels (168 UI/L vs. 224.5 UI/L, p = 0.003), a greater need for maternal treatment (60.3% vs 24.4%, p < 0.001), a reduced need for oxygen therapy (2.4% vs 28.8%, p < 0.001) and a lower rate of intensive care unit admission (0.0% vs. 3.7%, p = 0.046) than the RT-PCR-positive group. While no differences were found in other variables, the monocyte count was higher (946.2/µL vs. 518.8/µL, p = 0.022) in this group. The predictive model for a negative test result included the monocyte count, LDH level and no need for oxygen therapy. This model was able to identify 73.5% of patients with a negative RT-PCR result. Only 11% of the patients with pneumonia testing negative for the virus had IgG antibodies against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The proportion of pregnant women with suspected COVID-19 and a negative RT-PCR result was nearly 39%. In these patients, the symptoms were mild and the systemic severity of the disease was lower. The monocyte count, LDH level and no need for oxygen therapy were the factors that were more related to a negative test result in this group. These variables could be used to guide the management of patients with suspected COVID-19, mainly while waiting for RT-PCR results or in settings where this test is not available.","Cuñarro-López, Yolanda; Cano-Valderrama, Óscar; Pintado-Recarte, Pilar; Cueto-Hernández, Ignacio; González-Garzón, Blanca; García-Tizón, Santiago; Bujan, Julia; Asúnsolo, Ángel; Ortega, Miguel A; De León-Luis, Juan Antonio",,80,20

We evaluated mortality predictors of COVID-19 in a large cohort of hospitalized patients in the United States. DESIGN: Retrospective, multicenter cohort of inpatients diagnosed with COVID-19 by RT-PCR from 1 March to 17 April 2020 was performed, and outcome data evaluated from 1 March to 17 April 2020. Measures included demographics, comorbidities, clinical presentation, laboratory values and imaging on admission. Primary outcome was mortality. Secondary outcomes included length of stay, time to death and development of acute kidney injury in the first 48-h. RESULTS: The 1305 patients were hospitalized during the evaluation period. Mean age was 61.0 ± 16.3, 53.8% were male and 66.1% African American. Mean BMI was 33.2 ± 8.8 kg m-2 . Median Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) was 2 (1-4), and 72.6% of patients had at least one comorbidity, with hypertension (56.2%) and diabetes mellitus (30.1%) being the most prevalent. ACE-I/ARB use and NSAIDs use were widely prevalent (43.3% and 35.7%, respectively). Mortality occurred in 200 (15.3%) of patients with median time of 10 (6-14) days. Age > 60 (aOR: 1.93, 95% CI: 1.26-2.94) and CCI > 3 (aOR: 2.71, 95% CI: 1.85-3.97) were independently associated with mortality by multivariate analyses. NSAIDs and ACE-I/ARB use had no significant effects on renal failure in the first 48 h. CONCLUSION: Advanced age and an increasing number of comorbidities are independent predictors of in-hospital mortality for COVID-19 patients. NSAIDs and ACE-I/ARB use prior to admission is not associated with renal failure or increased mortality.","Imam, Z; Odish, F; Gill, I; O039,; Connor, D; Armstrong, J; Vanood, A; Ibironke, O; Hanna, A; Ranski, A; Halalau, A",J Intern Med,80,6

However, during the injection of oxic and organic carbon-containing water to the underground aquifers, severe phenomena such as clogging and groundwater deterioration have been reported. To prevent these severe phenomena, assimilable organic carbon (AOC) concentration has been controlled in the ASR applications by supporting bacteria growth potential. In this study, the AOC removal strategy was investigated in a simulated ASR system using an indigenous bacterium, Pseudomonas jinjuensis. AOC removal was evaluated under three different experimental conditions: (i) 30 °C and aerobic, (ii) 15 °C and aerobic, and (iii) 15 °C and anoxic. The effects of contact media such as sand and granular activated carbon on AOC removal efficiency were also investigated. Results show that under the 30 °C aerobic condition, P. jinjuensis could remove 99.8% (13 µg L-1) of AOC with soil. The variations in the organic fractions determined by liquid chromatography with organic carbon detector analysis were observed and showed trends similar to those of AOC determined by the flow cytometry method. The indirect injection method in ASR application was recommended due to the AOC removal benefit by soil indigenous bacterium.","Nguyen, Hien Thi; Kim, Youngjae; Choi, Jae-Woo; Cho, Kyungjin; Jeong, Seongpil",Environ Res,80,16

METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of a case series of a broad-spectrum of oral surgeries in a COVID-19 pandemic area. Data collection included patient age, type of procedure performed, and COVID-19 status of staff and patients. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics. RESULTS: Between February 21 and April 23, 2020, 1471 patients were treated in the outpatient clinic (n=1404) and under general anesthesia (n=67). All procedures were carried out under a strict empiric protective protocol that included patient screening, personal protective equipment allocation protocol, frequent staff testing, and patient testing before general anesthesia. Treatments included emergency and urgent elective procedures. Only one staff member was confirmed positive for COVID-19 during routine weekly testing, and an independent epidemiologic investigation suggested he was likely infected outside of hospital facilities. CONCLUSIONS: Our empiric protective protocol was found to be effective in preventing staff cross-infection with COVID-19 in an oral and maxillofacial surgery setting. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report that provides data regarding oral surgical activity in a COVID-19 pandemic area. Our suggested protective protocol may assist oral surgeons in continuing dental services in a safe manner.","Alterman, Michael; Nassar, Maria; Rushinek, Heli; Cohen, Adir; Shapira, Lior; Casap, Nardy",Clin. oral investig,80,15

DESCRIPTION: The Welcome Baby (WB) Program is a voluntary, universal home visiting program for expectant women and women with infants in Los Angeles County implemented in 14 hospitals in Los Angeles County. Oversight of the program is managed by LA Best Babies Network (LABBN) and funded by First 5 LA. The COVID-19 pandemic forced Welcome Baby Home visitors to shift from in-person home visits to virtual visits, which had an impact on programmatic outcomes. ASSESSMENT: LABBN manages a database utilized by WB sites. In assessing data trends before and during the pandemic, shifting to virtual visits resulted in an increase in both missed visits and completed visits, and a decrease in overall visit length. Completion of required assessments and overall client program completion were not affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSION: The Welcome Baby sites across Los Angeles County were able to successfully migrate in-person visits to a virtual platform, proving that virtual visits are possible and do provide some programmatic benefits. However, the long-term efficacy of virtual visits remains to be seen, and further research is warranted.","Bock, Martha J; Kakavand, Kayla; Careaga, Diana; Gozalians, Sharlene",Matern Child Health J,80,23

Chest X-ray (CXR) is often useful because it is cheap, fast, widespread, and uses less radiation. Here, we demonstrate the impact of lung segmentation in COVID-19 identification using CXR images and evaluate which contents of the image influenced the most. Semantic segmentation was performed using a U-Net CNN architecture, and the classification using three CNN architectures (VGG, ResNet, and Inception). Explainable Artificial Intelligence techniques were employed to estimate the impact of segmentation. A three-classes database was composed: lung opacity (pneumonia), COVID-19, and normal. We assessed the impact of creating a CXR image database from different sources, and the COVID-19 generalization from one source to another. The segmentation achieved a Jaccard distance of 0.034 and a Dice coefficient of 0.982. The classification using segmented images achieved an F1-Score of 0.88 for the multi-class setup, and 0.83 for COVID-19 identification. In the cross-dataset scenario, we obtained an F1-Score of 0.74 and an area under the ROC curve of 0.9 for COVID-19 identification using segmented images. Experiments support the conclusion that even after segmentation, there is a strong bias introduced by underlying factors from different sources.","Teixeira, Lucas O.; Pereira, Rodolfo M.; Bertolini, Diego; Oliveira, Luiz S.; Nanni, Loris; Cavalcanti, George D.

Endoscopic endonasal skull base surgery is thought to be among the highest-risk aerosol-generating procedures for surgeons and operating room personnel. OBJECTIVE: To validate the efficacy and clinical feasibility of a novel surgical device. METHODS: A low-cost, modifiable, and easily producible negative pressure, face-mounted antechamber was developed utilizing 3D printing and silicone molding. Efficacy was evaluated using an optical particle sizer to quantify aerosols generated during both cadaver and intraoperative human use with high-speed drilling. RESULTS: Particle counts in the cadaver showed that drilling led to a 2.49-fold increase in particles 0.3 to 5 µm (P = .001) and that the chamber was effective at reducing particles to levels not significantly different than baseline. In humans, drilling led to a 37-fold increase in particles 0.3 to 5 µm (P < .001), and the chamber was effective at reducing particles to a level not significantly different than baseline. Use of the antechamber in 6 complex cases did not interfere with the ability to perform surgery. Patients did not report any facial discomfort after surgery related to antechamber use. CONCLUSION: The use of a negative pressure facial antechamber can effectively reduce aerosolization from endoscopic drilling without disturbing the flow of the operation. The antechamber, in conjunction with appropriate PPE, will be useful during the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as during flu season and any future viral outbreaks.","Kim, Matthew; Lee, Mark; Schwarz, Justin; Kacker, Ashutosh; Schwartz, Theodore H",Oper. neurosurg.

Natural language processing, textual processing, computational linguists, and biometrics are applied to perform sentiment analysis to identify and extract the emotions. In this work, sentiment analysis is carried out on a large Twitter dataset of English tweets. Ten emotional themes are investigated. Experimental results show that COVID-19 has spread fear/anxiety, gratitude, happiness and hope, and other mixed emotions among people for different reasons. Specifically, it is observed that positive news from top officials like Trump of chloroquine as cure to COVID-19 has suddenly lowered fear in sentiment, and happiness, gratitude, and hope started to rise.

The European Union requested the H2020 HERA project which aims at setting priorities in research on environment, climate and health, to identify relevant research needs regarding Covid-19. The emergence and spread of SARS-CoV-2 appears to be related to urbanization, habitat destruction, live animal trade, intensive livestock farming and global travel. The contribution of climate and air pollution requires additional studies. Importantly, the severity of COVID-19 depends on the interactions between the viral infection, ageing and chronic diseases such as metabolic, respiratory and cardiovascular diseases and obesity which are themselves influenced by environmental stressors. The mechanisms of these interactions deserve additional scrutiny. Both the pandemic and the social response to the disease have elicited an array of behavioural and societal changes that may remain long after the pandemic and that may have long term health effects including on mental health.

MethodsThe performance of a whole blood interferon-gamma (IFN-{gamma}) release assay (IGRA) for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 antigen-specific CD4 and CD8 T cells was evaluated in COVID-19 convalescents tested serially up to 10 months post-infection and in healthy blood donors. SARS-CoV-2 IGRA was applied in contacts of households with index cases. Freshly collected blood in the lithium heparin tube was left unstimulated, stimulated with a SARS-CoV-2 peptide pool, and stimulated with mitogen. ResultsThe overall sensitivity and specificity of IGRA were 84.5% (153/181; 95% confidence interval [CI] 79.0-89.0) and 86.6% (123/142; 95% CI;80.0-91.2), respectively. The sensitivity declined from 100% (16/16; 95% CI 80.6-100) at 0.5-month post-infection to 79.5% (31/39; 95% CI 64.4-89.2) at 10 months post-infection (P<0.01). The IFN-{gamma} response remained relatively robust at 10 months post-infection (3.8 vs. 1.3 IU/mL, respectively). In 14 households, IGRA showed a positivity rate of 100% (12/12) and 65.2% (15/23), and IgG of 50.0% (6/12) and 43.5% (10/23) in index cases and contacts, respectively, exhibiting a difference of +50% (95% CI +25.4-+74.6) and +21.7% (95% CI, +9.23-+42.3), respectively. Either IGRA or IgG was positive in 100% (12/12) of index cases and 73.9% (17/23) of contacts. ConclusionsThe SARS-CoV-2 IGRA is a useful clinical diagnostic tool for assessing cell-mediated immune response to SARS-CoV-2. Key pointsSARS-CoV-2 immunodiagnostics are needed to identify infected individuals in order to understand the transmission dynamics of emerging variants and to assess vaccine response. Interferon-gamma release assay maintains sensitivity 10 months post-infection in convalescents and detects more household contacts than IgG.","Murugesan, Kanagavel; Jagannathan, Prasanna; Altamirano, Jonathan; Maldonado, Yvonne A; Bonilla, Hector F; Jacobson, Karen B; Parsonnet, Julie; Andrews, Jason R; Shi, Run-Zhang; Boyd, Scott; Pinsky, Benjamin A; Singh, Upinder; Banaei, Niaz",,80,24

Here, we characterized polyclonal immunoglobulin Gs (IgGs) and Fabs from COVID-19 convalescent individuals for recognition of coronavirus spikes. Plasma IgGs differed in their focus on RBD epitopes, recognition of alpha- and beta-coronaviruses, and contributions of avidity to increased binding/neutralization of IgGs over Fabs. Using electron microscopy, we examined specificities of polyclonal plasma Fabs, revealing recognition of both S1A and RBD epitopes on SARS-CoV-2 spike. Moreover, a 3.4 Å cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of a neutralizing monoclonal Fab-spike complex revealed an epitope that blocks ACE2 receptor binding. Modeling based on these structures suggested different potentials for inter-spike crosslinking by IgGs on viruses, and characterized IgGs would not be affected by identified SARS-CoV-2 spike mutations. Overall, our studies structurally define a recurrent anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody class derived from VH3-53/VH3-66 and similarity to a SARS-CoV VH3-30 antibody, providing criteria for evaluating vaccine-elicited antibodies.","Barnes, Christopher O; West, Anthony P; Huey-Tubman, Kathryn E; Hoffmann, Magnus A G; Sharaf, Naima G; Hoffman, Pauline R; Koranda, Nicholas; Gristick, Harry B; Gaebler, Christian; Muecksch, Frauke; Lorenzi, Julio C Cetrulo; Finkin, Shlomo; Hägglöf, Thomas; Hurley, Arlene; Millard, Katrina G; Weisblum, Yiska; Schmidt, Fabian; Hatziioannou, Theodora; Bieniasz, Paul D; Caskey, Marina; Robbiani, Davide F; Nussenzweig, Michel C; Bjorkman, Pamela J",Cell,80,26

Unlike most such frameworks, the one offered here is finitary: continuum theories are defined by reducing large but finite quantum systems to subsystems with conserved entanglement patterns at short distances. This makes it possible to start from a lattice theory and use rather elementary mathematics to isolate the entire algebraic structure of the corresponding low-energy continuum theory. The first half of this paper illustrates this approach through a persnickety study of (1 + 1)D continuum theories that emerge from the $\mathbb{Z}_K$ clock model at large $K$. This leads to a direct lattice derivation of many known continuum results, such as the operator product expansion of vertex operators in the free scalar CFT. Many new results are obtained too. For example, self-consistency of the lattice-continuum correspondence leads to a rich, novel proposal for the symmetry breaking structure of the clock model at weak coupling, deep in the BKT regime. This also makes precise what one means by""continuous""when saying that continuous symmetries cannot be broken in (1+1)D. The second half of this paper is devoted to path integrals for continuum theories of bosons and fermions defined in this finitary formalism. The path integrals constructed here have both nonperturbative lattice definitions and manifest continuum properties, such as symmetries under infinitesimal rotations or dilatations. Remarkably, this setup also makes it possible to generalize Noether's theorem to discrete symmetries.","Radicevic, Djordje",,80,7

A Randomized Double-Blind Trial,18.036335,10.336113,2020,"The COVID-19 pandemic is an emerging threat to global public health. While our current understanding of COVID-19 pathogenesis is limited, a better understanding will help us develop efficacious treatment and prevention strategies for COVID-19. One potential therapeutic target is angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). ACE2 primarily catalyzes the conversion of angiotensin I (Ang I) to a nonapeptide angiotensin or the conversion of angiotensin II (Ang II) to angiotensin 1-7 (Ang 1-7) and has direct effects on cardiac function and multiple organs via counter-regulation of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). Significant to COVID-19, ACE2 is postulated to serve as a major entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2 in human cells, as it does for SARS-CoV. Many infected individuals develop COVID-19 with fever, cough, and shortness of breath that can progress to pneumonia. Disease progression promotes the activation of immune cells, platelets, and coagulation pathways that can lead to multiple organ failure and death. ACE2 is expressed by epithelial cells of the lungs at high level, a major target of the disease, as seen in post-mortem lung tissue of patients who died with COVID-19, which reveals diffuse alveolar damage with cellular fibromyxoid exudates bilaterally. Comparatively, ACE2 is expressed at low level by vascular endothelial cells of the heart and kidney but may also be targeted by the virus in severe COVID-19 cases. Interestingly, SARS-CoV-2 infection downregulates ACE2 expression, which may also play a critical pathogenic role in COVID-19. Importantly, targeting ACE2/Ang 1-7 axis and blocking ACE2 interaction with the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 to curtail SARS-CoV-2 infection are becoming very attractive therapeutics potential for treatment and prevention of COVID-19. Here, we will discuss the following subtopics: 1) ACE2 as a receptor of SARS-CoV-2; 2) clinical and pathological features of COVID-19; 3) role of ACE2 in the infection and pathogenesis of SARS; 4) potential pathogenic role of ACE2 in COVID-19; 5) animal models for pathological studies and therapeutics; and 6) therapeutics development for COVID-19.","Datta, Prasun K; Liu, Fengming; Fischer, Tracy; Rappaport, Jay; Qin, Xuebin",Theranostics,80,16

Twice daily irrigation of J&J in hypertonic saline, hypertonic saline alone, or no intervention were compared (n = 24/group). Despite demonstrated safety and robust efficacy in in vitro virucidal assays, J&J irrigations had no impact on viral titers or symptom scores in treated subjects relative to controls. Similar findings were observed administering J&J to infected cultured human airway epithelia using protocols mimicking the clinical trial regimen. Additional studies of cultured human nasal epithelia demonstrated that lack of efficacy reflected pharmacokinetic failure, with the most virucidal J&J detergent components rapidly absorbed from nasal surfaces.

However, there are few antiviral drugs that can effectively treat these infections. The standard approach in the development of antiviral drugs involves the identification of a unique viral target, followed by the design of an agent that addresses that target. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) represent a novel source of potential antiviral drugs. AMPs have been shown to inactivate numerous different enveloped viruses through the disruption of their viral envelopes. However, the clinical development of AMPs as antimicrobial therapeutics has been hampered by a number of factors, especially their enzymatically labile structure as peptides. We have examined the antiviral potential of peptoid mimics of AMPs (sequence-specific N-substituted glycine oligomers). These peptoids have the distinct advantage of being insensitive to proteases, and also exhibit increased bioavailability and stability. Our results demonstrate that several peptoids exhibit potent in vitro antiviral activity against both HSV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 when incubated prior to infection. In other words, they have a direct effect on the viral structure, which appears to render the viral particles non-infective. Visualization by cryo-EM shows viral envelope disruption similar to what has been observed with AMP activity against other viruses. Furthermore, we observed no cytotoxicity against primary cultures of oral epithelial cells. These results suggest a common or biomimetic mechanism, possibly due to the differences between the phospholipid head group makeup of viral envelopes and host cell membranes, thus underscoring the potential of this class of molecules as safe and effective broad-spectrum antiviral agents. We discuss how and why differing molecular features between 10 peptoid candidates may affect both antiviral activity and selectivity.","Diamond, Gill; Molchanova, Natalia; Herlan, Claudine; Fortkort, John A; Lin, Jennifer S; Figgins, Erika; Bopp, Nathen; Ryan, Lisa K; Chung, Donghoon; Adcock, Robert Scott; Sherman, Michael; Barron, Annelise E",,80,16

METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated 64 patients who underwent surgery for TOF and 60 normal children. The angle between the left pulmonary artery and main pulmonary artery was measured using echocardiography and computed tomography angiography (CTA). Furthermore, STI was used to record the global longitudinal strain of the four-chamber view (GLS4), the global longitudinal strain of the two-chamber view (GLS2), and the global longitudinal strain of the right ventricle (RVGLS). RESULTS: The GLS4, GLS2, and RVGLS values in the TOF groups with different pulmonary artery branch angles were significantly lower than those in the control group. Furthermore, the GLS2 and RVGLS values were significantly lower for angles of 90-100° and <90° (vs >100°). Multivariate linear regression analyses revealed that pulmonary regurgitation and the angle between the left and main pulmonary arteries were two important factors affecting RVGLS. The Bland-Altman consistency test revealed good agreement regarding the pulmonary artery branch angles measured using echocardiography and CTA. CONCLUSION: In patients with TOF, the RVGLS was lower for acute left pulmonary artery angulation than for round and blunt left pulmonary artery angulation. The angle of the pulmonary artery branches was an important factor affecting RVGLS. Echocardiography can be used to measure the angle of the pulmonary artery branches, which provides valuable information for surgical correction of pulmonary artery morphology.","Zhang, Shuai; He, Xinjian; Liu, Lei; Fan, Yanhui; Chen, Jiaoyang; Yang, Lu; Cui, Yun; Fan, Di",Echocardiography,80,16

We designed this randomised-double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the effect of intravenous lignocaine on the bispectral index (BIS) during caesarean section under spinal anaesthesia. Methods: 80 patients scheduled for elective caesarean section under spinal anaesthesia were randomly allocated to 2 study groups. Group L received intravenous 1.5 mg/kg of lignocaine bolus, 15 minutes before spinal anaesthesia followed by an intravenous infusion 1.5 mg/kg/h for 60 minutes intravenously. The patients in the control group (C group) were given 0.9% sodium chloride in a double-blind fashion. Spinal anaesthesia was performed with 10 mg of 0.5% bupivacaine. The changes of Sao2, BIS and hemodynamic variables during caesarean section, Apgar score of neonate and the incidence of adverse effects were recorded. Results: BIS values were lower in the L group compared to C group (P &#8804; 0.001). Comparison of mean arterial pressure (MAP) changes during spinal anaesthesia and surgery reveal statistically significant difference between two groups through repeated measure analysis (P &#8804; 0.001), but comparision of heart rate (HR) changes during spinal anaesthesia and surgery failed to reveal any statistically significant difference between two groups. (P = 0.261). The Apgar scores did not reveal a significant difference between the two groups at first and five minutes after delivery (P = 0.99). Conclusion: Intravenous lignocaine infusion given with spinal anaesthesia in women undergoing elective caesarean delivery providing lower BIS values without respiratory depression, in the absence of foetal compromise.","Khezri, Marzieh Beigom; Rajabi, Maryam; Yaghoobi, Siamak; Barikani, Ameneh",Indian J Anaesth,80,24

OBJECTIVES: We investigated whether the association between symptoms (or cluster of symptoms) and positive SARS-CoV-2 nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) was different according to patients' age and presence of multimorbidity. METHODS: The study included 6680 participants in the EPICOVID19 web-based survey, who reported information about symptoms from February to June 2020 and who underwent at least one NPS. Symptom clusters were identified through hierarchical cluster analysis. The associations between symptoms (and clusters of symptoms) and positive NPS were investigated through multivariable binary logistic regression in the sample stratified by age (<65 vs &#8805;65 years) and number of chronic diseases (0 vs 1 vs &#8805;2). RESULTS: The direct association between taste/smell disorders and positive NPS was weaker in older and multimorbid patients than in their younger and healthier counterparts. Having reported no symptoms reduced the chance of positive NPS by 86% in younger (95%CI: 0.11-0.18), and by 46% in older participants (95%CI: 0.37-0.79). Of the four symptom clusters identified (asymptomatic, generic, flu-like, and combined generic and flu-like symptoms), those associated with a higher probability of SARS-CoV-2 infection were the flu-like for older people, and the combined generic and flu-like for the younger ones. CONCLUSIONS: Older age and pre-existing chronic diseases may influence the clinical presentation of Covid-19. Symptoms at disease onset tend to aggregate differently by age. New diagnostic algorithms considering age and chronic conditions may ease Covid-19 diagnosis and optimize health resources allocation.

Understanding the basis for severity remains crucial for better management and therapy development. So far, older age, associated-comorbidities, and IL-6 have been associated with severity/mortality. MATERIALS AND METHODOLOGY: As a primary step, we analyzed the frequency and functional profile of innate immune cells (NK cells/dendritic cells/monocytes) and adaptive immunity-driving lymphocytes (B cells/T cells/follicular T helper cells) by flow cytometry. Sixty cases of SARS CoV-2 infection (25 severe, 35 mild) and ten healthy subjects without SARS CoV-2 IgG were included. Disease-duration based analysis of immune profile was explored for early events differentiating the two disease forms. Neutralizing antibody titers were determined by PRNT. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Disease severity was found to be associated with impaired maturation of mDCs and hyperactivation of NK, follicular T helper cells, and CD8 T cells. Lower IL-21 receptor expression on memory B cells indicated an imbalance in IL-21/IL-21 R ratio. Lower BCMA positive plasmablast cells in severe cases did suggest a probable absence of long-term humoral immunity. Multivariate analysis revealed a progressive association of PD-1+CD4 T cells with PRNT50 titers. Thus, in addition to identifying probable prognostic markers for severity, our study emphasizes the definite need for in-depth viral antigen-specific functional analyses in a larger patient cohort and with multiple sampling.","Kulkarni-Munje, Archana; Palkar, Sonali; Shrivastava, Shubham; Lalwani, Sanjay; Mishra, Akhilesh C; Arankalle, Vidya A",Immun.

To that regard, deep learning approaches have proven as effective solutions for pneumonia classification, especially when considering chest-x-rays images. However, this lung infection can also be caused by other viral, bacterial or fungi pathogens. Consequently, efforts are being poured toward distinguishing the infection source to help clinicians to diagnose the correct disease origin. Following this tendency, this study further explores the effectiveness of established neural network architectures on the pneumonia classification task through the transfer learning paradigm. To present a comprehensive comparison, 12 well-known ImageNet pre-trained models were fine-tuned and used to discriminate among chest-x-rays of healthy people, and those showing pneumonia symptoms derived from either a viral (i.e., generic or SARS-CoV-2) or bacterial source. Furthermore, since a common public collection distinguishing between such categories is currently not available, two distinct datasets of chest-x-rays images, describing the aforementioned sources, were combined and employed to evaluate the various architectures. The experiments were performed using a total of 6330 images split between train, validation and test sets. For all models, common classification metrics were computed (e.g., precision, f1-score) and most architectures obtained significant performances, reaching, among the others, up to 84.46% average f1-score when discriminating the 4 identified classes. Moreover, confusion matrices and activation maps computed via the Grad-CAM algorithm were also reported to present an informed discussion on the networks classifications.","Avola, Danilo; Bacciu, Andrea; Cinque, Luigi; Fagioli, Alessio; Marini, Marco Raoul; Taiello, Riccardo",,80,22

Here we report a 13-year-old child with multiple comorbidities who acquired COVID-19 5 years post-RT in the United States. Maintenance immunosuppression (IS) consisted of sirolimus and mycophenolate. There was no history of travel or exposure to sick contacts. The presenting features were fever, cough, rhinorrhea, and hypoxemia. Diarrhea was the only extrapulmonary manifestation. Chest X-ray was normal. He did not require intensive care unit care or ventilation. There was a transient rise in his serum creatinine without change in urine output; dialysis was not required. Slight reduction in IS was done. He had an excellent clinical recovery within 4 days and was able to be discharged home. His respiratory symptoms resolved but the diarrhea persisted during a 4-week follow-up period.

Epidemiological studies have identified air pollutants, including particulate matter (PM), as a risk factor for COVID-19 infection and severity of illness, in addition to numerous factors such as pre-existing conditions, aging and smoking. However, the mechanisms by which air pollution is involved in the manifestation and/or progression of COVID-19 is still unknown. In this study, we used a mouse model exposed to crude PM, collected by the cyclone method, to evaluate the pulmonary expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transmembrane protease serine type 2 (TMPRSS2), the two molecules required for the entry of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) into host cells. Multiplex immunohistochemical analysis revealed that exposure to PM increased the expression of these two molecules at the same site. Furthermore, image cytometry analysis revealed increased expression of these proteins, particularly, in the alveolar type 2 cells and macrophages, which are potential targets for SARS-CoV-2. Our findings provide an experimental evidence that exposure to PM may adversely affect the manifestation and progression of COVID-19, mediated by the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on the site of entry. The study results suggest that examining these effects might help to advance our understanding of COVID-19 and aid the development of appropriate social interventions.","Sagawa, Tomoya; Tsujikawa, Takahiro; Honda, Akiko; Miyasaka, Natsuko; Tanaka, Michitaka; Kida, Takashi; Hasegawa, Koichi; Okuda, Tomoaki; Kawahito, Yutaka; Takano, Hirohisa",Environ Res,80,21

However, Bluetooth Low Energy tokens similar to those broadcast by existing apps can still be picked up far away from the transmitting device. In this paper, we present a new class of methods for detecting whether or not two Wi-Fi-enabled devices are in immediate physical proximity, i.e. 2 or fewer meters apart, as established by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Our goal is to enhance the accuracy of smartphone-based exposure notification and contact tracing systems. We present a set of binary machine learning classifiers that take as input pairs of Wi-Fi RSSI fingerprints. We empirically verify that a single classifier cannot generalize well to a range of different environments with vastly different numbers of detectable Wi-Fi Access Points (APs). However, specialized classifiers, tailored to situations where the number of detectable APs falls within a certain range, are able to detect immediate physical proximity significantly more accurately. As such, we design three classifiers for situations with low, medium, and high numbers of detectable APs. These classifiers distinguish between pairs of RSSI fingerprints recorded 2 or fewer meters apart and pairs recorded further apart but still in Bluetooth range. We characterize their balanced accuracy for this task to be between 66.8% and 77.8%.","Hyfte, Zach Van; Zakhor, Avideh",,80,16

Through the real-data of COVID-19 from January 23 to March 18, 2020, this paper proposes a fractional SEIHDR model based on the coupling effect of inter-city networks. At the same time, the proposed model considers the mortality rates (exposure, infection and hospitalization) and the infectivity of individuals during the incubation period. By applying the least squares method and prediction-correction method, the proposed system is fitted and predicted based on the real-data from January 23 to March 18 - m where m represents predict days. Compared with the integer system, the non-network fractional model has been verified and can better fit the data of Beijing, Shanghai, Wuhan and Huanggang. Compared with the no-network case, results show that the proposed system with inter-city network may not be able to better describe the spread of disease in China due to the lock and isolation measures, but this may have a significant impact on countries that has no closure measures. Meanwhile, the proposed model is more suitable for the data of Japan, the USA from January 22 and February 1 to April 16 and Italy from February 24 to March 31. Then, the proposed fractional model can also predict the peak of diagnosis. Furthermore, the existence, uniqueness and boundedness of a nonnegative solution are considered in the proposed system.

The primary components of vaping products, vitamin E acetate (VEA) and medium-chain triglycerides (MCT), may be responsible for acute lung toxicity. Currently, little information is available on the physiological and biological effects of exposure to these products. We hypothesized that these e-cig vape cartridges and their constituents (VEA and MCT) induce pulmonary toxicity, mediated by oxidative damage and inflammatory responses, leading to acute lung injury. We studied the potential mechanisms of e-cig vape cartridge aerosol induced inflammatory response by evaluating the generation of reactive oxygen species by MCT, VEA, and cartridges and their effects on the inflammatory state of pulmonary epithelium and immune cells both in vitro and in vivo. Cells exposed to these aerosols generated reactive oxygen species, caused cytotoxicity, induced epithelial barrier dysfunction, and elicited an inflammatory response. Using a murine model, the parameters of acute toxicity to aerosol inhalation were assessed. Infiltration of neutrophils and lymphocytes was accompanied by significant increases in IL-6, eotaxin, and G-CSF in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). In mouse plasma, eicosanoid inflammatory mediators, leukotrienes, were significantly increased. Plasma from e-cig users also showed increased levels of hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (HETEs) and various eicosanoids. Exposure to e-cig vape cartridge aerosols showed the most significant effects and toxicity compared to MCT and VEA. In addition, we determined SARS-CoV-2 related proteins and found no impact associated with aerosol exposures from these tested cartridges. Overall, this study demonstrates acute exposure to specific e-cig vape cartridges induces in vitro cytotoxicity, barrier dysfunction, and inflammation and in vivo mouse exposure induces acute inflammation with elevated proinflammatory markers in the pathogenesis of EVALI.","Muthumalage, Thivanka; Lucas, Joseph H.; Wang, Qixin; Lamb, Thomas; McGraw, Matthew D.; Rahman, Irfan",Toxics,80,28

All of these demands generate the need to ration equipment and interventions. Faced with this imbalance, how, when, and who decides, there is the impact of the stressful systems of professionals who are at the front line of care and, in the background, issues inherent to human subjectivity. Along this path, the idea of using artificial intelligence algorithms to replace health professionals in the decision-making process also arises. In this context, there is the ethical question of how to manage the demands produced by the pandemic. The objective of this work is to reflect, from the point of view of medical ethics, on the basic principles of the choices made by the health teams, during the COVID-19 pandemic, whose resources are scarce and decisions cause anguish and restlessness. The ethical values for the rationing of health resources in an epidemic must converge to some proposals based on fundamental values such as maximizing the benefits produced by scarce resources, treating people equally, promoting and recommending instrumental values, giving priority to critical situations. Naturally, different judgments will occur in different circumstances, but transparency is essential to ensure public trust. In this way, it is possible to develop prioritization guidelines using well-defined values and ethical recommendations to achieve fair resource allocation.","Neves, Nedy M. B.

Sequencing of the SARS-CoV-2 genome might allow identification of variants with increased contagiousness, different clinical patterns and/or different response to vaccines. A highly automated next generation sequencing (NGS)-based method might facilitate an active genomic surveillance of the virus. METHODS: RNA was extracted from 27 nasopharyngeal swabs obtained from citizens of the Italian Campania region in March-April 2020 who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Following viral RNA quantification, sequencing was performed using the Ion AmpliSeq SARS-CoV-2 Research Panel on the Genexus Integrated Sequencer, an automated technology for library preparation and sequencing. The SARS-CoV-2 complete genomes were built using the pipeline SARS-CoV-2 RECoVERY (REconstruction of COronaVirus gEnomes & Rapid analYsis) and analysed by IQ-TREE software. RESULTS: The complete genome (100%) of SARS-CoV-2 was successfully obtained for 21/27 samples. In particular, the complete genome was fully sequenced for all 15 samples with high viral titer (> 200 copies/µl), for the two samples with a viral genome copy number < 200 but greater than 20, and for 4/10 samples with a viral load < 20 viral copies. The complete genome sequences classified into the B.1 and B.1.1 SARS-CoV-2 lineages. In comparison to the reference strain Wuhan-Hu-1, 48 total nucleotide variants were observed with 26 non-synonymous substitutions, 18 synonymous and 4 reported in untranslated regions (UTRs). Ten of the 26 non-synonymous variants were observed in ORF1ab, 7 in S, 1 in ORF3a, 2 in M and 6 in N genes. CONCLUSIONS: The Genexus system resulted successful for SARS-CoV-2 complete genome sequencing, also in cases with low viral copies. The use of this highly automated system might facilitate the standardization of SARS-CoV-2 sequencing protocols and make faster the identification of novel variants during the pandemic.","Rachiglio, Anna Maria; De Sabato, Luca; Roma, Cristin; Cennamo, Michele; Fiorenza, Mariano; Terracciano, Daniela; Pasquale, Raffaella; Bergantino, Francesca; Cavalcanti, Ernesta; Botti, Gerardo; Vaccari, Gabriele; Portella, Giuseppe; Normanno, Nicola",J Transl Med,80,16

The transformation from internal combustion engines to new electrical technologies requires enormous investment, and hence the IC engines are likely to serve as a means of transportation for the coming decades. The search for sustainable green alternative fuel and operating parameter optimization is a current feasible solution and is a critical issue among the scientific community. Engine experiments are complicated, costly, and time-consuming, especially when the global economy is drastically down due to the COVID-19 pandemic and putting the limitation of social distancing. Industries are looking for proven computational solutions to address these issues. Recently, artificial neural network has been proven beneficial in several areas of engineering to reduce the time and experimentation cost. The IC engine is one of them. ANN has been used to predict and analyze different characteristics such as performance, combustion, and emissions of the IC engine to save time and energy. The complex nature of ANN may lead to computation time, energy, and space. Recent studies are centered on changing the network topology, deep learning, and design of ANN to get the highest performance. The present study summarizes the application of ANN to predict and optimize the complicated characteristics of various types of engines with different fuels. The study aims to investigate the network topologies adopted to design the model and thereafter statistical evaluation of the developed ANN models.

OBJECTIVE: To determine ED volumes and triage acuity prior to and after COVID-19. METHODS: We determined the volume of patients presenting to four large EDs affiliated with general, cardiac, cancer, and obstetrics hospitals, and the acuity of presenting illness (using the Canadian Triage Acuity Scale [CTAS]) for March and April 2020 and compared them with the same months in 2019 and January 2020. Together, these facilities see over 80% of the ED visits in Qatar. The first COVID-19 patient in Qatar was diagnosed on February 29, 2020. RESULTS: A total of 192,157 ED visits were recorded during the study period. There was a 20-43% overall drop in number of ED visits, with significant variability across hospitals. The Heart Hospital experienced the sharpest decline (33-89%), and the National Center for Cancer Care and Research experienced the least decline in volumes. The decline was observed across all CTAS levels, with the largest decline observed in individuals presenting with CTAS 1 and 2 (26-69% decline month by month). No increase in overall number of deaths or crude mortality rate was observed in the COVID-19 era, according to national statistics. CONCLUSIONS: Sharp declines in ED visits and the triage acuity seen in both general and specialty hospitals raise the concern that severely ill patients may not be seeking timely care, and a surge may be expected once current restrictions on movement are lifted.","Butt, Adeel A; Azad, Aftab M; Kartha, Anand B; Masoodi, Naseer A; Bertollini, Roberto; Abou-Samra, Abdul-Badi",J. emerg. med,80,16

There is ongoing research to address the unmet need and develop more effective antitussive treatment options. This is the first part of a series of two reviews of new antitussive medications. Medical databases (Medline, Embase and SCOPUS) and trial registries (ClinicalTrials.gov and EudraCT) were searched for studies on antitussive drugs targeting peripheral sensory nerves. AREAS COVERED: This review presents current knowledge of peripheral receptors that are not only involved in evoking the cough reflex, but are also potentially responsible for more sustained neural alterations. Blockage of the receptors and ion channels is discussed in terms of its potential antitussive effect. EXPERT OPINION: Although better understanding of CC mechanisms has facilitated the development of novel treatments including P2X2/3 receptor inhibitors (e.g. gefapixant), there remain several gaps in the knowledge about the mechanisms and treatment of CC. These include the lack of tests to diagnose cough hypersensitivity syndrome and predictors of response to specific treatments. Further research into cough phenotypes and endotypes will yield important insights and a personalized approach to cough management.","Grabczak, Elzbieta M; Dabrowska, Marta; Birring, Surinder S; Krenke, Rafal",Expert Rev Respir Med,80,11

Methods: A cross-sectional study using an online survey was conducted between the 19th of March and the 6th of April 2020 in three Middle Eastern countries (Jordan, Saudi Arabia, and Kuwait) to explore the knowledge and practices of the Middle Eastern population regarding COVID-19. A previously developed questionnaire was adapted and used for this study. Multiple linear regression analysis was used to identify predictors of COVID-19 knowledge. Results: A total of 1208 participants (members of the public) participated from the three countries (Jordan = 389, Saudi Arabia = 433, and Kuwait = 386). The majority of participants (n = 810, 67.2%) were females aged 30 to 49 years (n = 501, 41.5%).

Research into the production of relevant vaccines is progressively being advanced with the development of the Pfizer and BioNTech, AstraZeneca, Moderna, Sputnik V, Janssen, Sinopharm, Valneva, Novavax and Sanofi Pasteur vaccines. There is, however, a need for a computational intelligence solution approach to mediate the process of facilitating quick detection of the disease. Different computational intelligence methods, which comprise natural language processing, knowledge engineering, and deep learning, have been proposed in the literature to tackle the spread of coronavirus disease. More so, the application of deep learning models have demonstrated an impressive performance compared to other methods. This paper aims to advance the application of deep learning and image pre-processing techniques to characterise and detect novel coronavirus infection. Furthermore, the study proposes a framework named CovFrameNet., which consist of a pipelined image pre-processing method and a deep learning model for feature extraction, classification, and performance measurement. The novelty of this study lies in the design of a CNN architecture that incorporates an enhanced image pre-processing mechanism. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) Chest X-Ray dataset and COVID-19 Radiography database were used to evaluate and validate the effectiveness of the proposed deep learning model. Results obtained revealed that the proposed model achieved an accuracy of 0.1, recall/precision of 0.85, F-measure of 0.9, and specificity of 1.0. Thus, the study&#x2019;s outcome showed that a CNN-based method with image pre-processing capability could be adopted for the pre-screening of suspected COVID-19 cases, and the confirmation of RT-PCR-based detected cases of COVID-19.

We assessed immunogenicity to a first mRNA- or vector-based SARS-CoV-2-vaccination dose in dialysis patients. METHODS: In a multicenter observational pilot study, 2 weeks after a first vaccination (BNT162b2/Pfizer-BioNTech [Comirnaty] or ChAdOx1 nCoV-19/Oxford-Astra-Zeneca [Vaxzevria]), hemodialysis patients (N = 23), peritoneal dialysis patients (N = 4) and healthy staff (N = 14) were tested for SARS-CoV-2-spike IgG/IgM, Nucleocapsid-protein-IgG-antibodies and plasma ACE2-receptor-binding-inhibition capacity. Hemodialysis patients who had had prior COVID-19 infection (N = 18) served as controls. Both response to first SARS-CoV-2 vaccination and IgG spike-positivity following prior COVID-19 infection were defined as SARS-CoV-2 spike IgG levels &#8805; 50 AU/mL. RESULTS: Vaccination responder rates were 17.4% (4/23) in hemodialysis patients, 100% (4/4) in peritoneal dialysis patients and 57.1% (8/14) in staff (HD vs. PD: p = 0.004, HD vs. staff: p = 0.027). Among hemodialysis patients, type of vaccine (Comirnaty N = 11, Vaxzevria N = 12, 2 responders each) did not appear to influence antibody levels (IgG spike: Comirnaty median 0.0 [1.-3. quartile 0.0-3.8] versus Vaxzevria 4.3 [1.6-20.1] AU/mL, p = 0.079). Of responders to the first dose of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination among hemodialysis patients (N = 4/23), median IgG spike levels and ACE2-receptor-binding-inhibition capacity were lower than that of IgG spike-positive hemodialysis patients with prior COVID-19 infection (13/18, 72.2%): IgG spike: median 222.0, 1.-3. quartile 104.1-721.9 versus median 3794.6, 1.-3. quartile 793.4-9357.9 AU/mL, p = 0.015; ACE2-receptor-binding-inhibition capacity: median 11.5%, 1.-3. quartile 5.0-27.3 versus median 74.8%, 1.-3. quartile 44.9-98.1, p = 0.002.

The questionnaire assessed the type of school (primary or middle school), sex, age, and factors contributing to infection-related anxiety and educational anxiety that arose from the pandemic. The levels of anxiety and the factors contributing to anxiety were assessed using a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (not at all) to 5 (very anxious). RESULTS: In an analysis of the data of 237 participants excluding the missing data, many teachers reported feeling infection- and education-related anxiety.

A stepwise multiple regression analysis identified six factors for infection-related anxiety as significant (R2 = 0.61, p < 0.001). Among these variables, the largest partial regression coefficient value was reported for the following reason: ""I feel anxious because we cannot ensure the safety of teachers themselves or of their families"" (ß = 0.37, p < 0.001). For educational anxiety, four of six reasons were identified as significant (R2 = 0.64, p < 0.001). Among these, ""anxiety about the students' home situations"" (ß = 0.41, p < 0.001) and ""delay in education (students' side)"" (ß = 0.27, p < 0.001) had stronger associations with anxiety compared to the others. CONCLUSION: In-person education during the COVID-19 pandemic has caused teachers to experience anxiety. This report provides useful information by highlighting the reasons for infection-related anxiety and educational anxiety that teachers experience in face-to-face classes during a pandemic. Even if the coverage of a COVID-19 vaccine becomes widespread worldwide, we will still be combating COVID-19 infections for at least a few years. Given concerns regarding such infections, to ensure students' right to education, it is essential to understand why teachers feel anxious and to determine appropriate measures to decrease such anxiety.","Wakui, Nobuyuki; Abe, Shinichiro; Shirozu, Shunsuke; Yamamoto, Yuuki; Yamamura, Miho; Abe, Yasuyo; Murata, Souichi; Ozawa, Mizue; Igarashi, Takahiro; Yanagiya, Takahiro; Machida, Yoshiaki; Kikuchi, Mayumi",BMC Public Health,80,16
523286,523286,523286,Exercise considerations during coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) Outbreak: A narrative review,17.80192,10.418181,2020,"Over the last few decades, there has been a shift in the classroom from lecture-based to active learning settings with the argument that students retain more information when they are involved in the learning process. This correlation is even stronger when the active learning setting incorporates a real-world or personal connection. Using active learning activities that develop students' ability to comprehend primary scientific literature is particularly important in the field of immunology, due to the rapid expansion of information in the field, which has been further accelerated due to the COVID-19 pandemic. By nature, immunology is interdisciplinary, requiring an integrated knowledge of concepts from several scientific disciplines to understand complex immune processes. Engaging undergraduate students through the use of primary literature can improve scientific literacy, develop critical thinking, and enhance understanding of complex topics. To explore this, we utilized a group learning activity in an introductory immunology course that incorporated both a coronavirus-related review and COVID-19 clinical research article. We found that this learning activity significantly enhanced student confidence in key scientific literacy skills: reading scientific literature, clearly explaining relevant points, and describing conclusions generated from the data. Moreover, all students reported that they enjoyed the activity and that it helped them understand more about the current COVID-19 pandemic in the context of the immune response.","Anderson, Ashlyn E; Justement, Louis B; Bruns, Heather A",Biochem Mol Biol Educ,80,16

This meta-analysis examined the association of prescription of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) with the outcome from COVID-19. METHODS: A systematic search was conducted to find published studies that reported the outcome of COVID-19 in relation to prescription of ACEI or ARB. Two authors (MF and AD) independently screened and extracted data and assessed study quality and strength of association using standardised tools. The endpoints for the meta-analyses were severe or critical disease outcome and mortality based on standardised criteria. RESULTS: Twenty-six studies including 8389 people prescribed ACEI or ARB and 20,989 people not prescribed these medications were included. The quality of studies varied, and the overall strength of association was poor with a high risk of confounding bias. Patients prescribed ACEI or ARB had a greater prevalence of risk factors. Meta-analysis found an association between prescription of ACEI or ARB with severe or critical disease outcome (risk ratio, RR, 1.23, 95% confidence interval, CI, 1.06 to 1.42, p = 0.006, I(2) = 88%) but this association was lost in sensitivity analyses. There was no association between ACEI or ARB prescription and mortality (RR 1.18, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.50, p = 0.19, I(2) = 82%). CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis suggests that people prescribed ACEI or ARB more commonly had severe or critical disease outcome, but not mortality, in published cohorts of patients diagnosed with COVID-19. This finding is most likely due to a greater prevalence of risk factors in these patients rather than due to exposure to angiotensin pathway inhibitors.

To meet this challenge, we reevaluated the effectiveness of our physical therapy protocols for respiratory conditions. Protocols of interest were categorized as decongestive, neurogenic, mechanical, and immune modulating. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to evaluate which of our existing treatment protocols or protocol combinations produce the best outcome. To do so, we analyzed which ones can meet the following criteria when compared to all other treatments: test statistic (> 2.0) in parametric and non-parametric tests, [statistical significance (p < 0.05)], effect size larger than 0.2, difference in the Patient Identified Problem Scale (PIP) score above Minimal Clinically Important Difference (MCID), and sample size minimum 15 treatments. DESIGN: Retrospective multivariate analysis using a modified adaptive platform design. METHODS: A computerized sampling using respiratory related key words from a blinded dataset yielded 178 patients with respiratory complaints or pain in the chest area. Additional statistical analysis using parametric and non-parametric tests evaluated the difference between each treatment protocol and the rest of the treatments provided. RESULTS: Several protocol combinations and one individual protocol passed the study criteria. Cardiac vascular venous thoracic (CVVT) protocol was used most frequently within these combinations (7), followed by Urinary Drainage (UD) (4). Other protocols in this group were Cardiac Cervical Cranial Vascular (CCCV), Venous Thoracic Cardiopulmonary (VTCP), and Diaphragm Cranial Sinus (DCS). Among the respiratory specific protocols, CVVT was significantly better than VTCP (0.40, p < 0.001). DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: For the patient population studied, CVVT appears to be the primary protocol to consider, followed by UD, CCCV, VTCP, and DCS. Combining CVVT with Barral Abdominal Motility protocol (Barral) or VTCP with Lower Abdominal Urogenital (LAUG) on the same day might be required with acute patients.","Halili, Adi",J Bodyw Mov Ther,80,33

This has resulted in serious delays in resuscitation response. ILCOR has recently modified its guidelines to separate defibrillation from other interventions, recognizing that shock success is extremely time-dependent and that defibrillation poses relatively little risk of Covid-19 transmission. The new recommendation calls for sending one caregiver into the isolation room in order to initiate bedside monitoring and defibrillate if indicated, while the code team is donning their personal protective equipment. Implementing this change requires focused training in that specific role. This can be accomplished by intensively training a subset of clinical staff to assume the responsibility and act without hesitation when a code occurs. Focused defibrillation training promises to avoid compromising the care of patients experiencing tachyarrhythmic arrests in the setting of Covid-19. Such a training program might even result in better survival than before the pandemic for this subset of patients.","Stewart, John A.",Scand J Trauma Resusc Emerg Med,80,28

The means by which dental schools achieve this may differ and may undergo modification in response to changes in the expectations of governing bodies and challenges within the teaching environment. It is therefore important to identify which of these approaches works well and to disseminate good practice described in the literature. Objectives To use a scoping review to identify from the published literature the methods used to teach clinical dental skills, including innovations, motivations for changes, and factors affecting the delivery and quality of teaching. Method Scoping review methodology was used to select and analyse 57 articles published between 2008 and 2018. Results Innovations in didactic teaching were facilitated by advances in IT and development of virtual learning environments, which promoted independent, self-directed learning. Pre-clinical practical teaching took place in clinical techniques laboratories utilising mannequin heads, with a minority of dental schools using virtual reality simulators in addition. Clinical experience was gained mainly in multi-disciplinary clinics and offsite outreach teaching centres. Insufficient numbers of suitable patients, increasing student numbers and a fall in teaching staff contributed to a reported reduction in clinical experience of certain treatments. Conclusions Contemporary clinical dental skills teaching produces new graduates who possess excellent theoretical knowledge, are prepared and confident in basic clinical skills, but are lacking in experience of complex treatments which may result in a reduced preparedness for independent practice.

Efficient decontamination of contaminated surfaces could lead to decreased disease transmission, if optimized methods for detecting contaminated surfaces can be developed. Here we describe such a method whereby thermal tracking technology is utilized to detect thermal signatures incurred by surfaces through direct contact. This is applicable in public places to assist with targeted sanitation and cleaning efforts to potentially reduce chance of disease transmission. In this study, we refer to the touched region of the surface as a “touch-point” and examine how the touch-point regions can be automatically localized with a computer vision pipeline of a thermal image sequence. The pipeline mainly comprises two components: a single-frame and a multi-frame analysis. The single-frame analysis consists of a Background subtraction method for image pre-processing and a U-net deep learning model for segmenting the touch-point regions. The multi-frame analysis performs a summation of the outputs from the single-frame analysis and creates a cumulative map of touch-points. Results show that the touch-point detection pipeline can achieve 75.0% precision and 81.5% F1-score for the testing experiments of predicting the touch-point regions.

However, we observed some COVID-19 patients with existing SARS-CoV-2 for more than 50 days PIS. This study aimed to investigate the cause of viral clearance delay and the infectivity in these patients. Demographic data and clinical characteristics of 22 long-term COVID-19 patients were collected. The median age of the studied cohort was 59.83 ± 12.94 years. All patients were clinically cured after long-term SARS-CoV-2 infection ranging from 53 to 112 days PIS. Peripheral lymphocytes counts were normal. The ratios of interferon gamma (IFN-γ)-secreting cells to total CD4(+) and CD8(+) cells were normal as 24.68% ± 9.60% and 66.41% ± 14.87% respectively. However, the number of IFN-γ-secreting NK cells diminished (58.03% ± 11.78%). All patients presented detectable IgG, which positively correlated with mild neutralizing activity (Mean value neutralisation antibodies titers = 157.2, P = 0.05). No SARS-CoV-2 virus was isolated in Vero E6 cells inoculated with nasopharyngeal swab samples from all patients 50 days PIS, and the cytopathic effect was lacking. But one sample was positive for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid test in cell supernatants after two passages. Genome sequencing revealed that only three synonymous variants were identified in spike protein coding regions. In conclusion, decreased IFN-γ production by NK cells and low neutralizing antibodies might favor SARS-CoV-2 long-term existence. Further, low viral load and weak viral pathogenicity were observed in COVID-19 patients with long-term SARS-CoV-2 infection.

This study aimed to calculate the transmissibility of COVID-19 to predict trends and evaluate the effects of interventions. METHODS: The data of reported COVID-19 cases was collected from April 20 to May 26, 2021, which included daily reported data (Scenario I) and reported data after adjustment (Scenario II). A susceptible-exposed-symptomatic-asymptomatic-recovered model was developed to fit the data. The effective reproductive number (R(eff)) was used to estimate the transmissibility of COVID-19. RESULTS: A total of 4,854 cases were collected for the modelling. In Scenario I, the intervention has already taken some effects from May 17 to May 26 (the R(eff) reduced to 2.1). When the R(eff) was set as 0.1, the epidemic was projected to end on July 4, and a total of 1,997 cases and 855 asymptomatic individuals would have been reported. In Scenario II, the interventions were projected as having been effective from May 24 to May 26 (the R(eff) reduced to 0.4).

Hilton’s analysis of the findings of these studies indicated two major findings: (1) when students use OER, they obtain the same learning outcomes as with traditional textbooks while saving money; and (2) both students and teachers find OER comparable to traditional learning resources in terms of quality. Several advantages of OER were also revealed. These included low or no cost of OER, perceived ease of reading and access, their ability to provide the same learning outcomes as traditional materials, and students’ and instructors’ positive perceptions.

As recent variants have shown decreased reactivity to previously determined monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) or sera, monitoring the antigenicity change of circulating mutants is urgently needed for vaccine effectiveness. Currently, antigenic comparison is mainly carried out by immuno-binding assays. Yet, an online predicting system is highly desirable to complement the targeted experimental tests from the perspective of time and cost. Here, we provided a platform of SAS (Spike protein Antigenicity for SARS-CoV-2), enabling predicting the resistant effect of emerging variants and the dynamic coverage of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies among circulating strains. When being compared to experimental results, SAS prediction obtained the consistency of 100% on 8 mAb-binding tests with detailed epitope covering mutational sites, and 80.3% on 223 anti-serum tests. Moreover, on the latest South Africa escaping strain (B.1.351), SAS predicted a significant resistance to reference strain at multiple mutated epitopes, agreeing well with the vaccine evaluation results. SAS enables auto-updating from GISAID, and the current version collects 867K GISAID strains, 15.4K unique spike (S) variants, and 28 validated and predicted epitope regions that include 339 antigenic sites. Together with the targeted immune-binding experiments, SAS may be helpful to reduce the experimental searching space, indicate the emergence and expansion of antigenic variants, and suggest the dynamic coverage of representative mAbs/vaccines among the latest circulating strains.

PURPOSE: to provide an updated view regarding the early experience obtained from the management of KTRs with COVID-19. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A narrative review was conducted using PubMed database to identify relevant articles written in English/Spanish, and published through May 15, 2020. Search terms included: “coronavirus”, “severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2”, “SARS-CoV-2”, “COVID-19”, “COVID”, “renal transplantation”, and “kidney transplantation”. Case series were considered eligible, and case reports excluded. Thirty-four articles were included in the review. RESULTS: KTRs should be considered immunocompromised hosts: potential risk for infection, non-negligible comorbidity, and exposure to long-term immunosuppression. Only single center small retrospective experiences are still available regarding KTRs with COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 symptoms in KTRs are similar to that observed for the general population, being fever and cough the most frequently observed. Mild-to-moderate symptomatic KTRs can be managed in an outpatient setting, while patients exhibiting severe symptoms must be addmited to hospital. More rapid clinical progression, and higher complication and death rates have been observed for hospitalized KTRs, requiring hemodyalisis or ventilatory support. Lymphopenia, elevated serum markers (C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, IL-6, D-dimer), and chest-X-ray findings consistent with pneumonia are linked to worse prognosis.

A total of 61 (grief: n = 44; HC: n = 17) adults completed cross-sectional clinical assessments and a fasting blood draw. Assessments included the Inventory of Complicated Grief scale; the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale; and the Hamilton Anxiety scale. Serum eCB concentrations (i.e., N-arachidonoylethanolamine [AEA] and 2-arachidonoylglycerol [2-AG]) were quantified using isotope dilution, liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Relative to HC participants, grievers had significantly elevated serum AEA but similar 2-AG concentrations. In grievers, serum AEA concentrations were positively associated with depressive and anxiety symptoms, but only in those with low grief symptoms. These novel findings indicate that elevated circulating eCB concentrations are found following bereavement. The eCB signaling response varies based on the degree of grief severity. Circulating eCB measures may have the potential to serve as biomarkers of prolonged grief disorder.","Harfmann, Elisabeth J.; McAuliffe, Timothy L.; Larson, Eric R.; Claesges, Stacy A.; Sauber, Garrett; Hillard, Cecilia J.; Goveas, Joseph S.",Psychoneuroendocrinology,80,1

Recent literature has shown that the effects of COVID-19 mitigation measures may increase disease burden of common illnesses including HIV, Tuberculosis, Malaria and other key public health outcomes such as maternal mortality. A research program was undertaken to locate disengaged HIV positive women on option B+ and supported them to reengage in care. A 1 year follow up done following the tracing revealed that some women still disengaged from care. We aimed to establish the barriers to and facilitators for reengagement in care among previously traced women on option B+, and how these could have been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: This was a cross sectional qualitative study using individual interviews conducted in June and July, 2020, a period when the COVID-19 response measures such as lockdown and restrictions on transport were being observed in Uganda. Study participants were drawn from nine peri-urban and rural public healthcare facilities. Purposive sampling was used to select women still engaged in and those who disengaged from care approximately after 1 year since they were last contacted. Seventeen participants were included. Data was analysed using the content analysis approach. RESULTS: Women reported various barriers that affected their reengagement and retention in care during the COVID-19 pandemic. These included structural barriers such as transport difficulties and financial constraints; clinical barriers which included unsupportive healthcare workers, short supply of drugs, clinic delays, lack of privacy and medicine side effects; and psychosocial barriers such as perceived or experienced stigma and non-disclosure of HIV sero-status. Supportive structures such as family, community-based medicine distribution models, and a friendly healthcare environment were key facilitators to retention in care among this group. The COVID-19 pandemic was reported to exacerbate the barriers to retention in care. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 may exacerbate barriers to retention in HIV care among those who have experienced previous disengagement. We recommend community-based models such as drop out centres, peer facilitated distribution and community outreaches as alternative measures for access to ART during the COVID-19 pandemic.

A total of 169 patients with acute respiratory infections were included, viruses and bacteria in respiratory samples were detected using molecular methods. Among all samples, 73.3% and 59.7% were positive for viruses and bacteria, respectively; 45% contained both virus and bacteria. Bacterial coinfection was more frequent in patients infected by community respiratory viruses than influenza A H1N1pdm (83.3% vs. 40.6%). The most frequently bacteria detected were Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae. Both species were co‐detected in 54 patients and identified alone in 22 and 21 patients, respectively. Overall, there were no significant differences in the period of hospitalization, severity, or mortality rate between patients infected with respiratory viruses alone and those coinfected by viruses and bacteria. The detection of mixed respiratory pathogens is frequent in hospitalized patients with acute respiratory infections, but its impact on the clinical outcome does not appear substantial. However, it should be noted that most of the patients received broad‐spectrum antibiotic therapy, which may have contributed to this favorable outcome. J. Med.

It is based on the use of two antibodies directed one against a typical exosomal housekeeping protein and the second against either another exosomal housekeeping protein or a potential disease marker: the first antibody is used for the capture of exosomes, the second for the quantification and characterization of the captured vesicles. In fact, with this method it is possible both to characterize and count exosomes and to detect the presence of disease, including tumor, biomarkers. This needs of course to preliminary obtain an EVs purification from the clinical sample; the most agreed method to get to an EVs purification is the repeated rounds of ultracentrifugation, that, while far to be perfect, is the methodological approach allowing to not exclude EVs subpopulation from the separation procedure and to analyze a full range of EVs from both qualitative and quantitative point of view. The immunocapture-based approach has proven to be highly useful in screening, diagnosis and prognosis of tumors, in plasma samples. One amazing information provided by this method is that cancer patients have always significantly higher levels of EVs, in particular of exosomes, independently from the histological nature of the tumor. One microenvironmental factor that is fully involved in the increased exosome release by tumors is the extracellular acidity. However, few pre-clinical data suggest that plasmatic levels of exosomes may correlate with the tumor mass. Some recent clinical reports suggest also that circulating exosomes represent the real delivery system for some known tumor markers that are presently on trial (e.g., PSA). Here we review the pros and cons of the immunocapture-based technique in quantitative and qualitative evaluation of EVs in both health and disease.","Logozzi, Mariantonia; Di Raimo, Rossella; Mizzoni, Davide; Fais, Stefano",Methods Enzymol,80,19

Methods: We used data from a single large UK Cancer Centre to assess demographic/clinical characteristics of 156 cancer patients with a confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis between 29 February-12 May 2020. Logistic/Cox proportional hazards models were used to identify which demographic and/or clinical characteristics were associated with COVID-19 severity/death. Results: 128 (82%) presented with mild/moderate COVID-19 and 28 (18%) with severe disease. Initial diagnosis of cancer >24m before COVID-19 (OR:1.74 (95%CI: 0.71-4.26)), presenting with fever (6.21 (1.76-21.99)), dyspnoea (2.60 (1.00-6.76)), gastro-intestinal symptoms (7.38 (2.71-20.16)), or higher levels of CRP (9.43 (0.73-121.12)) were linked with greater COVID-19 severity.

These variable clinical manifestations suggest differences in influential factors, such as innate and adaptive host immunity, existing or underlying health conditions, comorbidities, genetics and other factors—compounding the complexity of COVID-19 pathobiology and potential biomarkers associated with the disease, as they become available. The heterogeneous data pose challenges for efficient extrapolation of information into clinical applications. We have curated 145 COVID-19 biomarkers by developing a novel cross-cutting disease biomarker data model that allows integration and evaluation of biomarkers in patients with comorbidities. Most biomarkers are related to the immune (SAA, TNF-∝ and IP-10) or coagulation (D-dimer, antithrombin and VWF) cascades, suggesting complex vascular pathobiology of the disease. Furthermore, we observe commonality with established cancer biomarkers (ACE2, IL-6, IL-4 and IL-2) as well as biomarkers for metabolic syndrome and diabetes (CRP, NLR and LDL).

This study identifies variability in prices of products acquired through government-driven contracts in Ecuador during the early pandemic response, when the highest mortality rates were registered in a single day. Data were obtained from the National Public Procurement Service (SERCOP) database between March 1 and July 31, 2020. A statistical descriptive analysis was conducted to extract relevant measures for commonly purchased products, medical devices, pharmaceutical drugs, and other goods. Among the most frequently purchased products, the greatest amounts were spent on face masks (US$4.5 million), acetaminophen (US$2.2 million), and reverse transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay kits (US$1.8 million). Prices varied greatly, depending on each individual contract and on the number of units purchased; some were exceptionally higher than their market value. Compared with 2019, the mean price of medical examination gloves increased up to 1,307%, acetaminophen 500 mg pills, up to 796%, and oxygen flasks, 30.8%. In a context of budgetary constraints that actually required an effective use of available funds, speculative price hikes may have limited patient access to health care and the protection of the general population and health care workers. COVID-19 vaccine allocations to privileged individuals have also been widely reported. Price caps and other forms of regulation, as well as greater scrutiny and transparency of government-driven purchases, and investment in local production, are warranted in Ecuador for improved infectious disease prevention.","Ortiz-Prado, Esteban; Fernandez-Naranjo, Raul; Torres-Berru, Yeferson; Lowe, Rachel; Torres, Irene",Am J Trop Med Hyg,80,24

METHODS: We conducted a prospective cohort study of children and adolescents (<21 years of age) with a SARS-CoV-2-infected close contact. We collected nasopharyngeal or nasal swabs at enrollment and tested for SARS-CoV-2 using a real-time PCR assay. RESULTS: Of 382 children, 293 (77%) were SARS-CoV-2-infected. SARS-CoV-2-infected children were more likely to be Hispanic (p<0.0001), less likely to have asthma (p=0.005), and more likely to have an infected sibling contact (p=0.001) than uninfected children. Children ages 6-13 years were frequently asymptomatic (39%) and had respiratory symptoms less often than younger children (29% vs. 48%; p=0.01) or adolescents (29% vs. 60%; p<0.0001). Compared to children ages 6-13 years, adolescents more frequently reported influenza-like (61% vs. 39%; p<0.0001), gastrointestinal (27% vs. 9%; p=0.002), and sensory symptoms (42% vs. 9%; p<0.0001), and had more prolonged illnesses [median (IQR) duration: 7 (4, 12) vs. 4 (3, 8) days; p=0.01]. Despite the age-related variability in symptoms, we found no differences in nasopharyngeal viral load by age or between symptomatic and asymptomatic children. CONCLUSIONS: Hispanic ethnicity and an infected sibling close contact are associated with increased SARS-CoV-2 infection risk among children, while asthma is associated with decreased risk. Age-related differences in the clinical manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection must be considered when evaluating children for COVID-19 and in developing screening strategies for schools and childcare settings.","Hurst, Jillian H; Heston, Sarah M; Chambers, Hailey N; Cunningham, Hannah M; Price, Meghan J; Suarez, Lilianna; Crew, Carter G; Bose, Shree; Aquino, Jhoanna N; Carr, Stuart T; Griffin, S Michelle; Smith, Stephanie H; Jenkins, Kirsten; Pfeiffer, Trevor S; Rodriguez, Javier; DeMarco, C Todd; De Naeyer, Nicole A; Gurley, Thaddeus C; Louzao, Raul; Zhao, Congwen; Cunningham, Coleen K; Steinbach, William J; Denny, Thomas N; Lugo, Debra J; Moody, M Anthony; Permar, Sallie R; Rotta, Alexandre T; Turner, Nicholas A; Walter, Emmanuel B; Woods, Christopher W; Kelly, Matthew S",Clin Infect Dis,80,22

Personal exposure (PE) of adults to BC has been widely studied, but little is known about the exposure of young children (toddlers) to BC in cities. We carried out a pilot study to investigate the integrated daily PE of toddlers to BC in a city-state with a high population density (Singapore). We studied the impact of urban traffic on the PE of toddlers to BC by comparing and contrasting on-road traffic flow (i.e., volume and composition) in Singapore in 2019 (before the COVID-19 pandemic) and in 2020 (during the COVID-19 pandemic). Our observations indicate that the daily BC exposure levels and inhaled doses increased by about 25% in 2020 (2.9 ± 0.3 μg m-3 and 35.5 μg day-1) compared to that in 2019 (2.3 ± 0.4 μg m-3 and 28.5 μg day-1 for exposure concentration and inhaled dose, respectively). The increased BC levels were associated with the increased traffic volume on both weekdays and weekends in 2020 compared to the same time period in 2019. Specifically, we observed an increase in the number of trucks as well as cars/taxis and motorcycles (private transport) and a decline in the number of buses (public transport) in 2020. The implementation of lockdown measures in 2020 resulted in significant changes in the time, place and duration of PE of toddlers to BC. The recorded daily time-activity patterns indicated that toddlers spent almost all the time in indoor environments during the measurement period in 2020. When we compared different ventilation options (natural ventilation (NV), air conditioning (AC), and portable air cleaner (PAC)) for mitigation of PE to BC in the home environment, we found a significant decrease (>30%) in daily BC exposure levels while using the PAC compared to the NV scenario. Our case study shows that the PE of toddlers to BC is of health concern in indoor environments in 2020 because of the migration of the increased TRAP into naturally ventilated residential homes and more time spent indoors than outdoors. Since toddlers' immune system is weak, technological intervention is necessary to protect their health against inhalation exposure to air pollutants.","Tran, Phuong T M; Adam, Max G; Balasubramanian, Rajasekhar",Environmental research,80,28

METHOD: We conducted a retrospective cohort study among moderate-to-severe COVID-19 pneumonia to assess the influence of tocilizumab (with or without corticosteroids) on: 1) primary composite outcome: risk for death/invasive mechanical ventilation/ICU-transfer at 14 days from hospital admission; 2) secondary outcome: COVID-related death only. Both outcomes were also assessed at 28 days and restricted to baseline more severe cases. We also evaluated the safety of tocilizumab. RESULTS: Overall, 412 patients were recruited, being affected by mild (6.8%), moderate (66.3%) or severe (26.9%) COVID-19 at baseline. The median participant’ age was 63 years, 56.5% were men, the sum of comorbidities was 1.34 (±1.44), and the median time from symptom onset to hospital admission was 7 [3–10] days. Patients were subdivided in 4 treatment groups: standard of care (SoC) only (n = 172), SoC plus corticosteroid (n = 65), SoC plus tocilizumab (n = 50), SoC plus tocilizumab and corticosteroid (n = 125). Twenty-six (6.3%) patients underwent intubation, and 37 (9%) COVID-related deaths were recorded. After adjusting for several factors, multivariate analysis showed that tocilizumab (with or without corticosteroids) was associated to improved primary and secondary outcomes at 14 days, and at 28-days only when tocilizumab administered without corticosteroid. Among more severe cases the protective effect of tocilizumab (± corticosteroids) was observed at both time-points. No safety concerns were recorded. CONCLUSION: Although contrasting results from randomized clinical trials to date, in our experience tocilizumab was a safe and efficacious therapeutic option for patients with moderate-to-severe COVID-19 pneumonia.

Here, we analysed variations in the fine particulate matter (PM(2.5)) over the Delhi-National Capital Region. Measurements revealed large reductions (by 40–70%) in PM(2.5) during the first week of lockdown (25–31 March 2020) as compared to the pre-lockdown conditions. However, O(3) pollution remained high during the lockdown due to non-linear chemistry and dynamics under low aerosol loading. Notably, events of enhanced PM(2.5) levels (300–400 µg m(−3)) were observed during night and early morning hours in the first week of April after air temperatures fell close to the dew-point (~ 15–17 °C). A haze formation mechanism is suggested through uplifting of fine particles, which is reinforced by condensation of moisture following the sunrise.

Pharmacy-related services, including prescription drugs, however, are not universally publicly insured. Although this system underpins the Canadian identity, primary health care reform has long been desired by Canadians wanting better access to high quality, effective, patient-centred, and safe primary care services. A nationally coordinated approach to remodel the primary health care system was incited at the turn of the 21(st) century yet, twenty years later, evidence of widespread meaningful improvement remains underwhelming. As a provincial/territorial responsibility, the organization and provision of primary care remains discordant across the country. Canadian pharmacists are, now more than ever, poised and primed to provide care integrated with the rest of the primary health care system. However, the self-regulation of the profession of pharmacy is also a provincial/territorial mandate, making progress toward integration of pharmacists into the primary care system incongruent across jurisdictions. Among 11,000 pharmacies, Canada’s 28,000 community pharmacists possess varying authority to prescribe, administer, and monitor drug therapies as an extension to their traditional dispensing role. Expanded professional services offered at most community pharmacies include medication reviews, minor/common ailment management, pharmacist prescribing for existing prescriptions, smoking cessation counselling, and administration of injectable drugs and vaccinations. Barriers to widely offering these services include uncertainties around remuneration, perceived skepticism from other providers about pharmacists’ skills, and slow digital modernization including limited access by pharmacists to patient health records held by other professionals. Each province/territory enables pharmacists to offer these services under specific legislation, practice standards, and remuneration models unique to their jurisdiction. There is also a small, but growing, number of pharmacists across the country working within interdisciplinary primary care teams. To achieve meaningful, consistent, and seamless integration into the interdisciplinary model of Canadian primary health care reform, pharmacy advocacy groups across the country must coordinate and collaborate on a harmonized vision for innovation in primary care integration, and move toward implementing that vision with ongoing collaboration on primary health care initiatives, strategic plans, and policies. Canadians deserve to receive timely, equitable, and safe interdisciplinary care within a coordinated primary health care system, including from their pharmacy team.","Raiche, Taylor; Pammett, Robert; Dattani, Shelita; Dolovich, Lisa; Hamilton, Kevin; Kennie-Kaulbach, Natalie; Mccarthy, Lisa; Jorgenson., Derek",Pharm Pract (Granada),80,1

However, health proposal repetition and its perceived efficacy also influence the behavior intention toward the proposal, which has not yet been confirmed in the COVID-19 context. The present study aims to examine whether the extended parallel process model (EPPM) can be generalized to a naturalistic context like the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, we will explore how repetition of a health proposal is involved with the EPPM. In this study, two groups of participants are exposed to the same health proposal related to COVID-19, where one group is exposed once and another group twice. They then fill out a questionnaire consisting of items concerning behavior intention and adapted from the Risk Behavior Diagnosis Scale. Structural equation modeling will be used to determine the multivariate associations between the variables. We predict that repetition of the health proposal will associate with response efficacy (i.e., a belief about the effectiveness of the health proposal in deterring the threat) and perceived susceptibility (i.e., a belief about the risk of experiencing the threat). It is also predicted that following the EPPM, behavior intention will associate with both perceived efficacy of the health proposal, which will underlie response efficacy, and perceived threat of COVID-19, which will underlie perceived susceptibility. We will discuss the process, based on the model, where health message repetition affects behavior intention during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Yang, Jingwen; Wu, Xue; Sasaki, Kyoshiro; Yamada, Yuki",PeerJ,80,28

Most SARS-CoV-2 exposed individuals experience mild to moderate symptoms, including fever, cough, fatigue, and loss of smell and taste. However, many individuals develop pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, septic shock, and multiorgan dysfunction. In addition to these primarily respiratory symptoms, SARS-CoV-2 can also infiltrate the central nervous system, which may damage the blood-brain barrier and the neuron's synapses. Resultant inflammation and neurodegeneration in the brain stem can further prevent efferent signaling to cranial nerves, leading to the loss of anti-inflammatory signaling and normal respiratory and gastrointestinal functions. Additionally, SARS-CoV-2 can infect enterocytes resulting in gut damage followed by microbial dysbiosis and translocation of bacteria and their byproducts across the damaged epithelial barrier. As a result, this exacerbates pro-inflammatory responses both locally and systemically, resulting in impaired clinical outcomes. Recent evidence has highlighted the complex interactions that mutually modulate respiratory, neurological, and gastrointestinal function. In this review, we discuss the ways SARS-CoV-2 potentially disrupts the gut-brain-lung axis. We further highlight targeting specific responses to SARS-CoV-2 for the development of novel, urgently needed therapeutic interventions.

Thirty-eight strains of ORF3 were obtained, and these were composed of five strains of ORF3 named Guangxi naturally truncated strains that were 293 bp in length, with continuous deletions from 172 to 554 bp. The Guangxi naturally truncated strains encoded a truncated protein of 89 amino acids, which had clustered into a new group referred to as Group 3, and these might be involved in the variations of virulence. Three genotypes (G1-1 subgroup, G1-3 subgroup, and Group 3) existed simultaneously in Guangxi based on the genetic and evolutionary analysis of the ORF3 gene. The sequence information in the current study will hopefully facilitate the establishment of a diagnostic method that can differentiate the PEDV field stains. Continued surveillance will be useful for monitoring PEDV transmission. Differentiation of the ORF3 genes in PEDV field strains can help us to choose an appropriate PEDV vaccine candidate in the future and prevent outbreaks of PED more effectively.","Lu, Ying; Su, Xueli; Du, Chen; Mo, Liyuan; Ke, Purui; Wang, Ruomu; Zhong, Lian; Yang, Cui; Chen, Ying; Wei, Zuzhang; Huang, Weijian; Liao, Yuying; Ouyang, Kang",Front Vet Sci,80,28

We form 16,384 models on these 14 determinants to test the appropriateness of each of these determinants. Unlike previous studies, we use both Bayesian averaging of classical estimates (BACE) and the weighted average least square (WALS) in our analyses to ensure the robustness of the findings. Two key criteria are used to select relevant models with appropriate determinants. When all criteria and techniques are jointly considered, three fundamental determinants are identified for the Asia-Pacific region: (i) freedom to trade internationally; (ii) higher education and training; and (iii) market size.","Vo, Duc Hong; Nguyen, Nhan Thien",,80,0

In 2012, the World Health Organisation (WHO) estimated that global deaths due to non-communicable diseases (NCDs) as about 38 million (68%). Most of these conditions are preventable through public health initiatives involving community pharmacists. This study aims to explore strategies enhancing the public health role of community pharmacists. METHODS: Data was collected through telephone interviews, supported by Skype (audio), and recorded using the 'HD Call Recorder for Skype'. The qualitative data software package NVivo (version 10) was used for the storage, retrieval and analysis of data. The constant comparative method of data analysis was used. In addition, the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF) was used to underpin the research throughout. RESULTS: This study identified a number of strategies that could enhance the public health role of community pharmacists, some of which include: integrating undergraduate healthcare programmes; broadening the public health knowledge of students and pharmacists; pharmacists working alongside other healthcare professionals; teaching communication methods to students and pharmacists; teaching the use of new technologies and social media; etc. In addition, most of the 14 domains of TDF and several of their constructs were captured in the interview. CONCLUSIONS: To enhance the public health role of community pharmacists, it is necessary to develop pharmacists’ capacity in several areas, particularly as it relates to, the use new technologies and social media in public health; enhancing training of pharmacists/students in public health; empowering pharmacists in public health; as well as teaching communication methods to students and pharmacists. Part of the strategy will also be, to integrate healthcare programmes through interdisciplinary initiatives, and changing the undergraduate pharmacy curriculum to increase its public health content.","Agomo, Chijioke O.; Ogunleye, James; Portlock, Jane",Innov Pharm,80,1

Because an unknown proportion of reported symptoms among SARS-CoV-2 positives will be attributable to another infection or affliction, the observed, or 'crude' proportion without symptoms may underestimate the proportion of persons without symptoms that are caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: Based on two rounds of a large population-based serological study comprising test results on seropositivity and self-reported symptom history conducted in April/May and June/July 2020 in the Netherlands (n = 7517), we estimated the proportion of reported symptoms among those persons infected with SARS-CoV-2 that is attributable to this infection, where the set of relevant symptoms fulfills the ECDC case definition of COVID-19, using inferential methods for the attributable risk (AR). Generalised additive regression modelling was used to estimate the age-dependent relative risk (RR) of reported symptoms, and the AR and asymptomatic proportion (AP) were calculated from the fitted RR. RESULTS: Using age-aggregated data, the 'crude' AP was 37% but the model-estimated AP was 65% (95% CI 63–68%). The estimated AP varied with age, from 74% (95% CI 65–90%) for < 20 years, to 61% (95% CI 57–65%) for the 50–59 years age-group. CONCLUSION: Whereas the 'crude' AP represents a lower bound for the proportion of persons infected with SARS-CoV-2 without COVID-19 symptoms, the AP as estimated via an attributable risk approach represents an upper bound. Age-specific AP estimates can inform the implementation of public health actions such as targetted virological testing and therefore enhance containment strategies.

In 2007, in the first reported outbreak in Australia, the virus spread through the horse populations of two states within 4 months. Most of the geographic spread occurred within the first 10 days and was associated with the movement of infected horses prior to the implementation of movement controls. This study applies social network analysis to describe spread of equine influenza between horse premises infected in the early outbreak period, identifying spread occurring through a contact network and secondary local spatial spread. Social networks were constructed by combining contact-tracing data on horse movements with a distance matrix between all premises holding horses infected within the first 10 days of the outbreak. These networks were analysed to provide a description of the epidemic, identify premises that were central to disease spread and to estimate the relative proportion of premises infected through infected horse movements and through local spatial spread. We then explored the effect of distance on disease spread by estimating the range of local spread (through direct contact, transmission on fomites and windborne transmission) based on the level of fragmentation in the network and also by directly estimating the shape of the outbreak's spatial transmission kernel. During the first 10 days of this epidemic, 197 horse premises were infected; 70 of these were included in the contact-traced network. Most local spread occurred within 5 km. Local spread was estimated to have occurred up to a distance of 15.3 km – based on the contact-and-proximity network – and at a very low incidence beyond this distance based on the transmission kernel estimate. Of the 70 premises in the contact network, spread to 14 premises (95% CI: 9, 20 premises) was likely to have occurred through local spatial spread from nearby infected premises, suggesting that 28.3% of spread in the early epidemic period was ‘network-associated’ (95% CI: 25.6, 31.0%). By constructing a ‘maximal network’ of contact and proximity (based on a distance cut-off of 15.3 km), 44 spatial clusters were described, and the horse movements that initiated infection in these locations were identified. Characteristics of the combined network, incorporating both spatial and underlying contact relationships between infected premises, explained the high rate of spread, the sequence of cluster formation and the widespread dispersal experienced in the early phase of this epidemic. These results can inform outbreak control planning by guiding the imposition of appropriate control zone diameters around infected premises and the targeting of surveillance and interventions.","Firestone, Simon M.; Christley, Robert M.; Ward, Michael P.; Dhand, Navneet K.",Prev Vet Med,80,20

Data were extracted from official websites of the WHO and health authorities of relevant countries. A total of 1346 confirmed cases of COVID-19, with 217 recoveries and 18 deaths, were reported in Southeast Asia as of 16 March 2020. The basic reproductive number (R(0)) of COVID-19 in the region was estimated as 2.51 (95% CI:2.31 to 2.73), and there were significant geographical variations at the subregional level. Early transmission dynamics were examined with an exponential regression model: y = 0.30e(0.13x) (p < 0.01, R(2) = 0.96), which could help predict short-term incidence. Country-level disease burden was positively correlated with Human Development Index (r = 0.86, p < 0.01). A potential early shift in spatial diffusion patterns and a spatiotemporal cluster occurring in Malaysia and Singapore were detected.

To validate the protective efficacy of the vaccination campaign and effectively control the pandemic, it is necessary to quantify the induction of neutralizing antibodies by vaccination, as they have been established to be a correlate of protection. In this work, a SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus neutralization assay, based on a replication-incompetent lentivirus expressing an adapted form of CoV-2 S protein and an ACE2/TMPRSS2 stably expressing cell line, has been minimized in terms of protocol steps without loss of accuracy. The goal of the present simplified neutralization system is to improve SARS-CoV-2 vaccination campaign by means of an easy and accessible approach to be performed in any medical laboratory, maintaining the sensitivity and quantitative reliability of classical serum neutralization assays. Further, this assay can be easily adapted to different coronavirus variants by simply modifying the pseudotyping vector.","Donofrio, Gaetano; Franceschi, Valentina; Macchi, Francesca; Russo, Luca; Rocci, Anna; Marchica, Valentina; Costa, Federica; Giuliani, Nicola; Ferrari, Carlo; Missale, Gabriele",Vaccines (Basel),80,1

To this end, uncertainty is assumed in the demand and production data. During the Pandemic COVID-19 period, uncertainty has increased and the food supply chain system has changed. Thus, a new configuration of the food supply network requires analysis. In this paper, the concept of RFH is introduced to connect producers in rural areas and customers in urban areas. This paper determines the location and capacity of RFHs, the food supply network, the sum of maximum food supplies, and minimum logistics cost. This is done via a Multi-Objective Many-to-Many Location-Routing Problem model. Furthermore, since the conditions of the COVID-19 pandemic is uncertain, robust optimization is employed to handle uncertainties. During the current pandemic, red zones are defined to indicate the severity of the pandemic in a region. In this paper, the numerical experiment is considered for three scenarios: when a region is in large-scale social distancing, partial social distancing, or normal conditions. This social distancing situation is based on the defined red zones. The optimal food supply network is obtained for the three scenarios and the best scenario among the three is identified.","Perdana, Tomy; Chaerani, Diah; Achmad, Audi Luqmanul Hakim; Hermiatin, Fernianda Rahayu",Heliyon,80,6

SARS-CoV-2 antibodies are higher in severely or critically ill COVID-19 patients, but studies have not focused on levels in convalescent patients with MetS, which this study aimed to assess. METHODS: This retrospective study focused on adult convalescent outpatients with SARS-CoV-2 positive serology during the COVID-19 pandemic at NewYork Presbyterian/Weill Cornell. Data collected for descriptive and correlative analysis included SARS-COV-2 immunoglobin G (IgG) levels and history of MetS comorbidities from April 17, 2020 to May 20, 2020. Additional data, including SARS-CoV-2 IgG levels, body mass index (BMI), hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and lipid levels were collected and analyzed for a second cohort from May 21, 2020 to June 21, 2020. SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies were measured in a subset of the study cohort. RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 IgG levels were significantly higher in convalescent individuals with MetS comorbidities. When adjusted for age, sex, race, and time duration from symptom onset to testing, increased SARS-CoV-2 IgG levels remained significantly associated with obesity (P < 0.0001). SARS-CoV-2 IgG levels were significantly higher in patients with HbA1c ≥6.5% compared to those with HbA1c <5.7% (P = 0.0197) and remained significant on multivariable analysis (P = 0.0104). A positive correlation was noted between BMI and antibody levels [95% confidence interval: 0.37 (0.20-0.52) P < 0.0001]. Neutralizing antibody titers were higher in COVID-19 individuals with BMI ≥ 30 (P = 0.0055).

We use a stochastic model to investigate containment and elimination scenarios for COVID-19 in New Zealand, as the country considers the exit from its four week period of strong Level 4 population-wide control measures. In particular we consider how the effectiveness of its case isolation operations influence the outcome of lifting these strong population-wide controls. The model is parameterised for New Zealand and is initialised using current case data, although we do not make use of information concerning the geographic dispersion of cases and the model is not stratified for age or co-morbidities. We find that fast tracing and case isolation (i.e. operations that are sustained at rates comparable to that at the early stages of New Zealand's response) can lead to containment or elimination, as long as strong population-wide controls remain in place. Slow case isolation can lead to containment (but not elimination) as long as strong Level 4 population-wide controls remain in place. However, we find that relaxing strong population-wide controls after four weeks will most likely lead to a further outbreak, although the speed of growth of this outbreak can be reduced by fast case isolation, by tracing, testing, or otherwise. We find that elimination is only likely if case isolation is combined with strong population-wide controls that are maintained for longer than four weeks. Further versions of this model will include an age-structured population as well as considering the effects of geographic dispersion and contact network structure, the possibility of regional containment combined with inter-regional travel restrictions, and the potential for harm to at risk communities and essential workers.","Plank, Michael J; Binny, Rachelle N; Hendy, Shaun C; Lustig, Audrey; James, Alex; Steyn, Nicholas",,80,24

The present study aimed to examine severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) co-infection with influenza A virus (IAV) in an attempt to provide clues for the antiviral interventions of co-infected patients. We described two patients who were co-infected with SARS-CoV-2 and IAV treated at Wuhan Union Hospital, China. In addition, we performed a review in PubMed, Web of Science and CNKI (from January 1 up to November 1, 2020) with combinations of the following key words: “COVID-19, SARS-COV-2, influenza A and co-infection”. A total of 28 co-infected patients were enrolled in the analysis. Of the 28 patients, the median age was 54.5 years (IQR, 34.25–67.5) and 14 cases (50.0%) were classified as severe types. The most common symptoms were fever (85.71%), cough (82.14%) and dyspnea (60.71%). Sixteen patients had lymphocytopenia on admission and 23 patients exhibited abnormal radiological changes. The median time from symptom onset to hospital admission was 4 days (IQR, 3–6), and the median time of hospital stay was 14 days (IQR, 8.5–16.75). In conclusion, patients with SARS-COV-2 and IAV co-infection were similar to those infected with SARS-COV-2 alone in symptoms and radiological images. SARS-COV-2 co-infection with IAV could lead to more severe clinical condition but did not experience longer hospital stay compared with patients infected with SARS-COV-2 alone.","Xiang, Xuan; Wang, Zi-hao; Ye, Lin-lin; He, Xin-liang; Wei, Xiao-shan; Ma, Yan-ling; Li, Hui; Chen, Long; Wang, Xiao-rong; Zhou, Qiong",Curr Med Sci,80,16

What explains which of these options voters prefer? We study how personal exposure and policy knowledge affect mass support for long-term disaster preparedness, a type of long-term investment meant to cope with an increasingly destructive and frequent class of events. We first assess whether support for preparedness reflects personal affectedness and find that neither subjective nor geo-coded measures of disaster exposure predict policy preferences. Second, we explore whether this finding can be explained by misperceptions about the features of the available policy options. We find that revealing the damage reductions associated with preparedness systematically reduces opposition to long-term investment. These results suggest that opposition to preparing for collective threats may depend more on informational deficiencies than on personal experience with realized risks.

Most of these social robots have provided timely stimuli to the elderly at home and in care centres, including keeping them active and boosting their mood. However, previous investigations have registered shortcomings in these robots, particularly in their ability to satisfy an essential human need: the need for companionship. Reports show that the elderly tend to lose interests in these social robots after the initial excitement as the novelty wears out and the monotonous familiarity becomes all too familiar. This paper presents our research facilitating conversations between a social humanoid robot, Nadine, and cognitively impaired elderly at a nursing home. We analysed the effectiveness of human–humanoid interactions between our robot and 14 elderly over 29 sessions. We used both objective tools (based on computer vision methods) and subjective tools (based on observational scales) to evaluate the recorded videos. Our findings showed that our subjects engaged positively with Nadine, suggesting that their interaction with the robot could improve their well-being by compensating for some of their emotional, cognitive, and psychosocial deficiencies. We detected emotions associated with cognitively impaired elderly during these interactions. This study could help understand the expectations of the elderly and the current limitations of Social Assistive Robots.

Techniques from the field have the potential to increase quality of cardiovascular care given suboptimal rates of guideline-directed care delivery and patient adherence to optimal health behaviors across the spectrum of cardiovascular care delivery. RECENT FINDINGS: Cardiovascular health-promoting interventions have demonstrated success in using a wide array of principles from behavioral economics, including loss framing, social norms, and gamification. Such approaches are becoming increasingly sophisticated and focused on clinical cardiovascular outcomes in addition to health behaviors as a primary endpoint. Many approaches can be used to improve patient decisions remotely, which is particularly useful given the shift to virtual care in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.

One way to prevent such a pandemic is through interventions at the human-animal-environment interface by using an integrated One Health (OH) approach. This systematic literature review documented the three coronavirus outbreaks, i.e. SARS, MERS, COVID-19, to evaluate the evolution of the OH approach, including the identification of key OH actions taken for prevention, response, and control. The OH understandings identified were categorized into three distinct patterns: institutional coordination and collaboration, OH in action/implementation, and extended OH (i.e. a clear involvement of the environmental domain). Across all studies, OH was most often framed as OH in action/implementation and least often in its extended meaning. Utilizing OH as institutional coordination and collaboration and the extended OH both increased over time. OH actions were classified into twelve sub-groups and further categorized as classical OH actions (i.e. at the human-animal interface), classical OH actions with outcomes to the environment, and extended OH actions. The majority of studies focused on human-animal interaction, giving less attention to the natural and built environment. Different understandings of the OH approach in practice and several practical limitations might hinder current efforts to achieve the operationalization of OH by combining institutional coordination and collaboration with specific OH actions. The actions identified here are a valuable starting point for evaluating the stage of OH development in different settings. This study showed that by moving beyond the classical OH approach and its actions towards a more extended understanding, OH can unfold its entire capacity thereby improving preparedness and mitigating the impacts of the next outbreak.","Schmiege, Dennis; Arredondo, Ana Maria Perez; Ntajal, Joshua; Paris, Juliana Minetto Gellert; Savi, Merveille Koissi; Patel, Krupali; Yasobant, Sandul; Falkenberg, Timo",One Health,80,21

The impact of these measures on non-COVID-19 patients remains largely unexplored. AIM: This study aimed to investigate diagnostic and treatment delays related to isolation precautions, the associated patient outcome, and the predisposing risk factors for delays. METHODS: This observational study was conducted in seven Helsinki region hospitals during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Finland. The study used data on all non-COVID-19 inpatients, who were initially isolated due to suspected COVID-19, to estimate whether isolation precautions resulted in diagnostic or treatment delays. RESULTS: Out of 683 non-COVID-19 patients, 33 (4.8%) had delays related to isolation precautions. Clinical condition deteriorated non-fatally in seven (1.0%) patients. The following events were associated with an increased risk of treatment or a diagnostic delay: more than three ward transfers (P = 0.025); referral to an incorrect speciality in the emergency department (P = 0.004); more than three SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR tests performed (P = 0.022); and where cancer was the final diagnosis (P = 0.018).

The induction of apoptosis in cancerous cells seems a promising procedure to use as a cancer treatment. In the family of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) proteins, there are some ligands with the capability to induce apoptosis. Several recombinant TNF apoptosis-inducing ligands have been designed over the years, and their characteristics have been improved. This review provides an overview of the studies done in different stages of the TNF apoptosis-inducing ligands as cancer treatments and the strategies to surpass their natural limitations to improve their effectiveness. ABSTRACT: Cancer is a complex disease with apoptosis evasion as one of its hallmarks; therefore, apoptosis induction in transformed cells seems a promising approach as a cancer treatment. TNF apoptosis-inducing ligands, which are naturally present in the body and possess tumoricidal activity, are attractive candidates. The most studied proteins are TNF-α, FasL, and TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL). Over the years, different recombinant TNF family-derived apoptosis-inducing ligands and agonists have been designed. Their stability, specificity, and half-life have been improved because most of the TNF ligands have the disadvantages of having a short half-life and affinity to more than one receptor. Here, we review the outlook on apoptosis-inducing ligands as cancer treatments in diverse preclinical and clinical stages and summarize strategies of overcoming their natural limitations to improve their effectiveness.","Diaz Arguello, Olivia A.; Haisma, Hidde J.",Cancers (Basel),80,1

C1INH belongs to a superfamily of serine proteinase inhibitor (serpins) and exhibits its inhibitory activities towards several target proteases of plasmatic cascades, operating as a major anti-inflammatory protein in the circulation. In addition to its inhibitory activities, C1INH is also involved in non-inhibitory interactions with some endogenous proteins, polyanions, cells and infectious agents. While C1INH is essential for multiple physiological processes, it is better known for its deficiency with regards to Hereditary Angioedema (HAE), a rare autosomal dominant disease clinically manifested by recurrent acute attacks of increased vascular permeability and edema. Since the link was first established between functional C1INH deficiency in plasma and HAE in the 1960s, tremendous progress has been made in the biochemical characterization of C1INH and its therapeutic development for replacement therapies in patients with C1INH-dependent HAE. Various C1INH biological activities, recent advances in the HAE-targeted therapies, and availability of C1INH commercial products have prompted intensive investigation of the C1INH potential for treatment of clinical conditions other than HAE.

A county health ranking and roadmaps program has been established to identify factors associated with disparity in mobility and mortality of COVID-19 in all counties in the United States. Objective: To find out the risk factors associated with mortality of COVID-19 with various levels of prevalence. Design: A negative binomial design was applied to the county-level mortality counts of COVID-19 on April 15, 2020 in the United States. In this design, the infected counties were categorized into three levels of infections using clustering analysis based on time-variant cumulative confirmed cases from March 1 to April 15, 2020. Setting: United States Participants: COVID-19 patients in various counties of the United States from March 1 to April 15, 2020. Measurements: The county-level cumulative confirmed cases and mortality of COVID-19. Results. 2692 infected counties were assigned into three classes where the mild, moderate, and severe prevalence of infections were identified, respectively. Several risk factors are significantly associated with the mortality of COVID-19, where Hispanic (0.024, P=0.002), female (0.253, P=0.027), elder (0.218, P=0.017) and Native Hawaiian or other Pacific islander (2.032, P=0.027) individuals are more vulnerable to the mortality of COVID-19. More locations open to exercise (0.030, P=0.004), higher levels of air pollution (0.184, P=0.044), and segregation between non-White and White increased the mortality rate. Limitation: The study relied on mortality data on April 15, 2020. Conclusion. The mortality of COVID-19 depends on sex, ethnicity, and outdoor environment.

It is responsible for the death of over two million people and posed an economic recession. This paper studies the spread pattern of COVID-19, aiming to establish a prediction model for this event. We harness Data Mining and Machine Learning methodologies to train regression models to predict the number of confirmed cases in a spatial-temporal space. We introduce an innovative concept ‒ the Center of Infection Mass (CoIM) ‒ adapted from the field of physics. We empirically evaluated our model on western European countries, based on the CoIM index and other features, and showed that a relatively high accurate prediction of the spread can be obtained. Our contribution is twofold: first, we introduced a prediction methodology and proved empirically that a prediction can be made even to the range of over a month; second, we showed promise in adopting the CoIM index to prediction models, when models that adopt the CoIM yield significantly better results than those that discard it. By applying our model, and better controlling the inherent tradeoff between life-saving and economy, we believe that decision-makers can take close to optimal measures. Thus, this methodology may contribute to public welfare.","Hirschprung, Ron S.; Hajaj, Chen",Heliyon,80,10

The advent of molecular assays has improved the identification of viruses in patients with CAP and according to published studies, viruses account for 11-55% of adult CAP cases. OBJECTIVES AND STUDY DESIGN: In the present study, the frequency of respiratory viruses was evaluated in respiratory samples collected from 414 patients with CAP admitted to 26 ICUs in the Lombardy Region (10 million inhabitants) during seven winter-spring seasons (2009–2016). RESULTS: In 226 (54.6%) patients one or more respiratory viruses were identified, while 188 (45.4%) patients were negative. A single virus infection was observed in 214/226 (94.7%) patients; while, in 12/226 (5.3%) at least two respiratory viruses were detected. Influenza A was the most common virus in 140/226 patients (61.9%) followed by rhinoviruses (33/226, 14.6%), respiratory syncytial virus (13/226, 5.8%), influenza B virus (9/226, 4.0%), human coronaviruses (9/226, 4.0%), cytomegalovirus (9/226, 4.0%) and human metapneumovirus (1/226, 0.4%). CONCLUSIONS: Viral infections are present in a consistent proportion of patients admitted to the ICU for CAP. Influenza A and rhinovirus accounted for three-quarters of all CAP in ICU patients. The use of lower respiratory instead of upper respiratory samples might be useful in the diagnosis of viral CAP.","Piralla, Antonio; Mariani, Bianca; Rovida, Francesca; Baldanti, Fausto",J Clin Virol,80,13

Social capital is a measure of social trust, belonging, and participation. This study aimed to investigate the effects of social capital on sleep quality and the mechanisms involved in people who self-isolated at home for 14 days in January 2020 during the COVID-19 epidemic in central China. METHODS: Individuals (n=170) who self-isolated at home for 14 days in central China, completed self-reported questionnaires on the third day of isolation. Individual social capital was assessed using the Personal Social Capital Scale 16 (PSCI-16) questionnaire. Anxiety was assessed using the Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) questionnaire, stress was assessed using the Stanford Acute Stress Reaction (SASR) questionnaire, and sleep was assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) questionnaire. Path analysis was performed to evaluate the relationships between a dependent variable (social capital) and two or more independent variables, using Pearson’s correlation analysis and structural equation modeling (SEM). RESULTS: Low levels of social capital were associated with increased levels of anxiety and stress, but increased levels of social capital were positively associated with increased quality of sleep. Anxiety was associated with stress and reduced sleep quality, and the combination of anxiety and stress reduced the positive effects of social capital on sleep quality. CONCLUSION: During a period of individual self-isolation during the COVID-19 virus epidemic in central China, increased social capital improved sleep quality by reducing anxiety and stress.","Xiao, Han; Zhang, Yan; Kong, Desheng; Li, Shiyue; Yang, Ningxi",Med Sci Monit,80,16

Design A retrospective cohort study between 3.2011-4.2020. Setting Tertiary medical center. Patients or Participants All women who underwent surgical diagnostic procedure due to suspected adnexal torsion in pregnancy. Overall, 156 women were included. Interventions Operative laparoscopy. Measurements and Main Results We collected demographic and clinical characteristics. The presence or absence of adnexal torsion during the surgical procedure was recorded. Adnexal torsion was identified in 131 (83.9%) of the surgical procedures. The rate of previous ovarian torsion was lower in the torsion group [OR(95%CI) 0.29(0.11-0.79), p=0.01]. Pregnancy following assisted reproductive technology (ART) was more common in the torsion group [OR(95%CI) 7.0(1.99-24.54), p<0.001]. Reported left sided pain was lower in the torsion group [OR(95%CI) 0.41(0.17-0.97), p=0.04], while duration of symptoms <8 hours was higher [OR(95%CI) 7.31(1.65-32.43), p=0.002], as was pain score (0-10) (mean 8.5 vs. 7.2, p=0.007). On physical examination, women appeared in more pain in the torsion group, had more peritoneal irritation, and less left adnexal tenderness [OR(95%CI) 4.34(1.74-10.8), p=0.001; 4.59(1.67-23.23), p=0.02; 0.27(0.11-0.66), p=0.003, respectively]. In blood analysis, white blood cells concentration was higher in the torsion group (11.3 vs. 9.9 K/microL, p=0.01), as was the neutrophils to lymphocytes ratio (3.4 vs. 2.5, p=0.01) and the maximal diameter of the affected ovary (70 vs. 55 mm, p=0.02). After multivariate analysis, three risk factors remained significantly independently associated with ovarian torsion; previous ovarian torsion was negatively associated [aOR(95%CI) 0.24(0.04-0.80), p=0.03], while ART and women that appeared in pain were positively associated [aOR(95%CI) 9.8(2.22-43.6), p=0.003; 3.8 (1.23-12.18), p=0.02, respectively]. Calculated risk for adnexal torsion was 0%, 68.2%, 90.4% and 100% in the presence of 0, 1, 2 and 3 risk factors respectively. Conclusion Our risk score calculator may assist clinicians in the prediction of adnexal torsion during pregnancy.","Meyer, R.; Meller, N.; Komem, D.; Cohen, A.; Abu-Bandora, E.; Mohr-Sasson, A.; Cohen, S.; Mashiach, R.; Levin, G.",Journal of Minimally Invasive Gynecology,80,16

The aim of this study was to discover and identify potential biomarkers specific for TB. METHODS: The surface-enhanced laser desorption ionization time of flight mass spectrometry (SELDI-TOF MS) combined with weak cation exchange (WCX) magnetic beads was used to screen serum samples from 180 cases of TB and 211 control subjects. A classification model was established by Biomarker Pattern Software (BPS). Candidate protein biomarkers were purified by reverse phase-high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC), identified by MALDI-TOF MS, LC-MS/MS and validated using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). RESULTS: A total of 35 discriminating m/z peaks were detected that were related to TB (P < 0.01). The model of biomarkers based on the four biomarkers (2554.6, 4824.4, 5325.7, and 8606.8 Da) was established which could distinguish TB from controls with the sensitivity of 83.3% and the specificity of 84.2%. The candidate biomarker with m/z of 2554.6 Da was found to be up-regulated in TB patients, and was identified as a fragment of fibrinogen, alpha polypeptide isoform alpha-E preproprotein.

The variant may have emerged in late September 2020 and carries some 17 mutations. Whether a single or a combination of different mutations would change the viral transmissibility, virulence, clinical and epidemiological presentations, or vaccine efficiency is unknown. Transmission by asymptomatic carriers of the new variant is also unknown. Mutation pressure by antiviral agents or vaccines have not yet been induced; however, additional mutations are expected following global vaccination and, later, after administration of validated treatments. Thus, preparedness for fast emergence of new variants is prudent. One can also expect less virulent but highly transmissible variants, which could facilitate herd immunity. Development of clinical and rapid laboratory tests is required to follow up the vaccinated individuals for a secondary infection potentially by the new variant.

In order to treat patients at an early stage and prevent the diffusion of an outbreak, early diagnosis, and therefore fast and adequate detection, is needed. To this end, a multiplex reverse transcription real-time polymerase chain reaction TaqMan method was designed to detect Zika (ZIKV) and chikungunya (CHIKV) viruses simultaneously. METHODS: Two methods targeting different genome segments were selected from the literature for each virus. These were adapted for high genome coverage and combined in a four-plex assay that was thoroughly validated in-house. The SCREENED tool was used to evaluate the sequence coverage of the method. RESULTS: The full validation approach showed that the new four-plex method allows the specific and sensitive identification and discrimination of ZIKV and CHIKV in routine samples. The combination of two targets per virus allowing almost 100% coverage of about 500 genomes is shown for the first time. CONCLUSIONS: PCR is a reliable user-friendly technique that can be applied in remote areas. Such multiplex methods enable early and efficient diagnosis, leading to rapid treatment and effective confinement in outbreak cases. They may also serve as an aid for surveillance, and the full validation permits easy method-transfer allowing worldwide harmonization.","Broeders, Sylvia; Garlant, Linda; Fraiture, Marie-Alice; Vandermassen, Els; Suin, Vanessa; Vanhomwegen, Jessica; Dupont-Rouzeyrol, Myrielle; Rousset, Dominique; Van Gucht, Steven; Roosens, Nancy",Int J Infect Dis,80,22

The data were collected in Norway from a sample of 405 participants during the first wave of COVID-19 in April 2020. We focused on three kinds of belief: the belief that the threat is overrated (COVID-threat skepticism), the belief that the threat is underrated (COVID-threat belief) and belief in misinformation about COVID-19. We studied sociodemographic factors associated with these beliefs and the interplay between attitudes to COVID-19, media consumption and prevention behavior. All three types of belief were associated with distrust in information about COVID-19 provided by traditional media and distrust in the authorities' approach to the pandemic. COVID-threat skepticism was associated with male gender, reduced news consumption since the start of the pandemic and lower levels of precautionary measures. Belief that the COVID-19 threat is underrated was associated with younger age, left-wing political orientation, increased news consumption during the pandemic and increased precautionary behavior. Consistent with the assumptions of the theory of planned behavior, individual beliefs about the seriousness of the COVID-19 threat predicted the extent to which individual participants adopted precautionary health measures. Both COVID-threat skepticism and COVID-threat belief were associated with endorsement of misinformation on COVID-19. Participants who endorsed misinformation tended to: have lower levels of education; be male; show decreased news consumption; have high Internet use and high trust in information provided by social media. Additionally, they tended to endorse multiple misinformation stories simultaneously, even when they were mutually contradictory. The strongest predictor for low compliance with precautionary measures was endorsement of a belief that the COVID-19 threat is overrated which at the time of the data collection was held also by some experts and featured in traditional media. The findings stress the importance of consistency of communication in situations of a public health threat.","Filkuková, Petra; Ayton, Peter; Rand, Kim; Langguth, Johannes",Front Psychol,80,23

We sought to identify the factors that influenced the initiation and provision of medical abortion from the perspectives of Canadian pharmacists, bridging two frameworks — Diffusion of Innovation in Health Service Organizations and integrated knowledge translation. METHODS: We conducted one-on-one semi-structured interviews with pharmacists residing in Canada who intended to stock and dispense mifepristone within the first year of availability. Our data collection, analysis, and interpretation were guided by reflexive thematic analysis and supported by an integrated knowledge translation partnership with pharmacy stakeholders. RESULTS: We completed interviews with 24 participants from across Canada: 33% had stocked and 21% had dispensed mifepristone. We found that pharmacists were willing and able to integrate medical abortion care into their practice and that those who had initiated practice were satisfied with their dispensing experience. Our analysis indicated that several key Diffusion of Innovation constructs impacted the uptake of mifepristone, including: innovation (relative advantage, complexity and compatibility, technical support), system readiness (innovation-system fit, dedicated time, resources), diffusion and dissemination (expert opinion, boundary spanners, champions, social networks, peer opinions), implementation (external collaboration), and linkage. Participants’ experiences suggest that integrated knowledge translation facilitated evidence-based changes to mifepristone dispensing restrictions, and communication of those changes to front line pharmacists. CONCLUSIONS: We illustrate how Diffusion of Innovation and integrated knowledge translation may work together as complimentary frameworks for implementation science research. Unlike in the USA, UK, and other highly regulated settings globally, pharmacists in Canada are permitted to dispense mifepristone for medical abortion. We contribute to literature that shows that mifepristone dispensed outside of hospitals, clinics, and medical offices is safe and acceptable to both patients and prescribers. This finding is of particular importance to the current COVID-19 pandemic response and calls for continued and equitable access to abortion care in primary practice.

The glycosaminoglycan hyaluronan (HA) is a major component of the glycocalyx, a protective layer of glycoconjugates that lines the vascular lumen and regulates key endothelial cell functions. During critical illness, as in the case of sepsis, enzymes degrade the glycocalyx, releasing fragments with pathologic activities into circulation and thereby exacerbating disease. Here, we analyzed levels of circulating glycosaminoglycans in 46 patients with COVID-19 ranging from moderate to severe clinical severity and measured activities of corresponding degradative enzymes. This report provides evidence that the glycocalyx becomes significantly damaged in patients with COVID-19 and corresponds with severity of disease. Circulating HA fragments and hyaluronidase, 2 signatures of glycocalyx injury, strongly associate with sequential organ failure assessment scores and with increased inflammatory cytokine levels in patients with COVID-19. Pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells exposed to COVID-19 milieu show dysregulated HA biosynthesis and degradation, leading to production of pathological HA fragments that are released into circulation. Finally, we show that HA fragments present at high levels in COVID-19 patient plasma can directly induce endothelial barrier dysfunction in a ROCK- and CD44-dependent manner, indicating a role for HA in the vascular pathology of COVID-19.","Queisser, Kimberly A.; Mellema, Rebecca A.; Middleton, Elizabeth A.; Portier, Irina; Manne, Bhanu Kanth; Denorme, Frederik; Beswick, Ellen J.; Rondina, Matthew T.; Campbell, Robert A.; Petrey, Aaron C.",JCI insight,80,26

Although many countries have followed WHO guidance, others have implemented infection prevention and control policies (IPC) that impose varying levels of postpartum separation and discourage or prohibit breastfeeding or provision of expressed breastmilk. These policies aim to protect infants from the potential harm of infection from their mothers, yet they may fail to fully account for the impact of separation. Global COVID‐19 data are suggestive of potentially lower susceptibility and a typically milder course of disease among children, although the potential for severe disease in infancy remains. Separation causes cumulative harms, including disrupting breastfeeding and limiting its protection against infectious disease, which has disproportionate impacts on vulnerable infants. Separation also presumes the replaceability of breastfeeding – a risk that is magnified in emergencies. Moreover, separation does not ensure lower viral exposure during hospitalizations and post‐discharge, and contributes to the burden on overwhelmed health systems. Finally, separation magnifies maternal health consequences of insufficient breastfeeding and compounds trauma in communities who have experienced long‐standing inequities and violence, including family separation. Taken together, separating PUI/confirmed SARS‐CoV‐2 positive mothers and their infants may lead to excess preventable illnesses and deaths among infants and women around the world. Health services must consider the short‐and‐long‐term impacts of separating mothers and infants in their policies.","Tomori, Cecília; Gribble, Karleen; Palmquist, Aunchalee E.L.; Ververs, Mija‐Tesse; Gross, Marielle S.",Matern Child Nutr,80,1

This paper empirically examines the asymmetric inter-linkages between transportation mobility and COVID-19. METHODS: Using daily data from 1st March 2020 to 15th July 2020, this study draws the dynamic and causal relationships between transportation mobility and COVID-19 in ten selected countries (i.e., USA, Brazil, Mexico, UK, Spain, Italy, France, Germany, Canada, and Belgium). To systematically analyze how the quantiles of COVID-19 (transportation mobility) affect the quantiles of transportation mobility (COVID-19), a complete set of non-linear modeling including the quantile-on-quantile (QQ) regression and quantile Granger causality in mean is applied. RESULTS: Our preliminary findings strictly reject the preposition of data normality and highlight that the observed relationship is highly correlated and quantile-dependent. The empirical results demonstrate the heterogeneous dependence between COVID-19 and transportation mobility across quantiles. The findings acclaim the presence of a significant positive association between COVID-19 and transportation mobility in the USA, UK, Spain, Italy, Canada, France, Germany and Belgium, predominantly at upper quantiles, but results are contrasting in the case of Brazil and Mexico. In addition, either lower or upper quantiles of both variables indicate a declining negative effect of transportation mobility on COVID-19. Furthermore, the outcomes of quantile Granger causality in mean conclude a bidirectional causal link between COVID-19 and transportation mobility for almost all sample countries. Unlike them, France has found unidirectional causality that extends from COVID-19 to transportation mobility. CONCLUSIONS: We may conclude that COVID-19 leads to a reduction in transportation mobility. On the other hand, the empirical results quantify that excessive transportation mobility levels stimulate pandemic cases, and social distancing is one of the primary measures to encounter infection transmission. Imperative country-specific policy implications pertaining to public health, potential virus spread, transportation, and the environment may be drawn from these findings.","Habib, Yasir; Xia, Enjun; Hashmi, Shujahat Haider; Fareed, Zeeshan",J Infect Public Health,80,18

The aim of the work was to compare the antioxidant properties of a by-product from an ancient Tuscan tomato variety, Rosso di Pitigliano (RED), obtained by growing plants in normal conditions (-Ctr) or in drought stress conditions (-Ds) for their beneficial effects on vascular related dysfunction. Methods: The antioxidant activity and total polyphenol content (TPC) were measured. The identification of bioactive compounds of tomato peel was performed by HPLC. HUVEC were pre-treated with different TPC of RED-Ctr or RED-Ds, then stressed with H(2)O(2). Cell viability, ROS production and CAT, SOD and GPx activities were evaluated. Permeation of antioxidant molecules contained in RED across excised rat intestine was also studied. Results: RED-Ds tomato peel extract possessed higher TPC than compared to RED-Ctr (361.32 ± 7.204 mg vs. 152.46 ± 1.568 mg GAE/100 g fresh weight). All extracts were non-cytotoxic. Two hour pre-treatment with 5 µg GAE/mL from RED-Ctr or RED-Ds showed protection from H(2)O(2)-induced oxidative stress and significantly reduced ROS production raising SOD and CAT activity (* p < 0.05 and ** p < 0.005 vs. H(2)O(2), respectively). The permeation of antioxidant molecules contained in RED-Ctr or RED-Ds across excised rat intestine was high with non-significant difference between the two RED types (41.9 ± 9.6% vs. 26.6 ± 7.8%). Conclusions: RED-Ds tomato peel extract represents a good source of bioactive molecules, which protects HUVECs from oxidative stress at low concentration.","Cesare, Maria Michela; Felice, Francesca; Conti, Veronica; Cerri, Luca; Zambito, Ylenia; Romi, Marco; Cai, Giampiero; Cantini, Claudio; Di Stefano, Rossella",Molecules,80,26

Even though some microorganisms represent no threat to healthy people, hospitals harbor different levels of immunocompetent individuals, namely patients receiving immunosuppressors, with previous infections, or those with extremes of age (young children and elderly), requiring the implementation of effective control measures. Public spaces have also been found an important source of infectious disease outbreaks due to poor or none infection control measures applied. In both places, surfaces play a major role on microorganisms’ propagation, yet they are very often neglected, with very few guidelines about efficient cleaning measures and microbiological assessment available. To overcome surface contamination problems, new strategies are being designed to limit the microorganisms’ ability to survive over surfaces and materials. Surface modification and/or functionalization to prevent contamination is a hot-topic of research and several different approaches have been developed lately. Surfaces with anti-adhesive properties, with incorporated antimicrobial substances or modified with biological active metals are some of the strategies recently proposed. This review intends to summarize the problems associated with contaminated surfaces and their importance on infection spreading, and to present some of the strategies developed to prevent this public health problem, namely some already being commercialized.","Querido, Micaela Machado; Aguiar, Lívia; Neves, Paula; Pereira, Cristiana Costa; Teixeira, João Paulo",Colloids Surf B Biointerfaces,80,26

Furthermore, there have been extensive debates over antiviral candidates for their effectiveness and safety against severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV 2 (SARS-CoV-2), suggesting that rapid preclinical animal studies are required to identify potential antiviral candidates for human trials. To this end, the antiviral efficacies of lopinavir-ritonavir, hydroxychloroquine sulfate, and emtricitabine-tenofovir for SARS-CoV-2 infection were assessed in the ferret infection model. While the lopinavir-ritonavir-, hydroxychloroquine sulfate-, or emtricitabine-tenofovir-treated group exhibited lower overall clinical scores than the phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)-treated control group, the virus titers in nasal washes, stool specimens, and respiratory tissues were similar between all three antiviral-candidate-treated groups and the PBS-treated control group. Only the emtricitabine-tenofovir-treated group showed lower virus titers in nasal washes at 8 days postinfection (dpi) than the PBS-treated control group. To further explore the effect of immune suppression on viral infection and clinical outcome, ferrets were treated with azathioprine, an immunosuppressive drug. Compared to the PBS-treated control group, azathioprine-immunosuppressed ferrets exhibited a longer period of clinical illness, higher virus titers in nasal turbinate, delayed virus clearance, and significantly lower serum neutralization (SN) antibody titers. Taken together, all antiviral drugs tested marginally reduced the overall clinical scores of infected ferrets but did not significantly affect in vivo virus titers. Despite the potential discrepancy of drug efficacies between animals and humans, these preclinical ferret data should be highly informative to future therapeutic treatment of COVID-19 patients.","Park, Su-Jin; Yu, Kwang-Min; Kim, Young-Il; Kim, Se-Mi; Kim, Eun-Ha; Kim, Seong-Gyu; Kim, Eun Ji; Casel, Mark Anthony B.; Rollon, Rare; Jang, Seung-Gyu; Lee, Min-Hyeok; Chang, Jae-Hyung; Song, Min-Suk; Jeong, Hye Won; Choi, Younho; Chen, Weiqiang; Shin, Woo-Jin; Jung, Jae U.; Choi, Young Ki",mBio,80,32

A greater understanding of citizens' perceptions of these measures can help government agencies adapt their strategies to boost compliance. We examined citizens' perceptions of government's measures to contain the COVID-19 pandemic and its implications on compliance using data from Onitsha city, Anambra State Nigeria. METHODS: data was obtained through in-person interviews of 140 consenting adults in March 2020. Descriptive and inferential statistics were used to summarize the data. RESULTS: most participants (84.7%) doubted government's ability to manage the COVID-19 outbreak, raising concerns about ineffective governance (25.7%) and inadequate health facilities (20.7%). However, participants expressed a favorable perception of school closures (92.3%) and a ban on large gatherings (83.9%), driven mostly by the need to contain the COVID-19 and avoid its spread. But, they were generally indifferent about the closure of the markets and workplaces due to concerns for food insecurity and lack of government's relief programs. Participants who had a positive perception of the ban on large gatherings were more likely to have high knowledge and to adopt good COVID-19 preventive practices. CONCLUSION: the study showed a lack of public's confidence in the government's ability to manage the pandemic. This provides an opportunity for the city government and the public to reflect on the existing relationships, build mutual trust, and devise collaborative engagement that will boost compliance and help contain the devastating impact of COVID-19 pandemic.","Yunusa, Ismaeel; Iloanusi, Sorochi; Mgbere, Osaro; Iloanusi, Nchebe-Jah Raymond; Ajayi, Anthony Idowu; Essien, Ekere James",Pan Afr Med J,80,1

All previous studies conducted in Africa were based on partial VP2 gene sequences. The aim of this study was to provide a genome analysis to characterize the CPV strains collected in Nigeria, Africa. Rectal swab samples (n = 320) were collected in 2018 and tested by means of an immunochromatographic assay. Among the 144 positive samples, 59 were selected for further analyses using different molecular assays. The results revealed a high prevalence of CPV‐2c (91.5%) compared to the CPV‐2a variant (8.5%). The VP2 gene sequences showed a divergence from the strains analysed in 2010 in Nigeria and a closer connection with CPV strains of Asian origin. The non‐structural gene analysis evidenced amino acid changes never previously reported. The molecular analysis based on genomic sequences evidenced a geographical pattern of distribution of the analysed strains, suggesting a potential common evolutionary origin with CPV of Asian origin.

The timely decisions taken by the government helped in decelerating the spread of COVID-19 to a large extent. Despite these decisions, the pandemic continues to spread. Future predictions about the spread can be helpful for future policy-making, i.e., to plan and control the COVID-19 spread. Further, it is observed throughout the world that asymptomatic corona cases play a major role in the spread of the disease. This motivated us to include such cases for accurate trend prediction. India was chosen for the study as the population and population density is very high for India, resulting in the spread of the disease at high speed. In this paper, the modified SEIRD (susceptible–exposed–infected–recovered–deceased) model is proposed for predicting the trend and peak of COVID-19 in India and its four worst-affected states. The modified SEIRD model is based on the SEIRD model, which also uses an asymptomatic exposed population that is asymptomatic but infectious for the predictions. Further, a deep learning-based long short-term memory (LSTM) model is also used for trend prediction in this paper.

Consequently, innovative antiviral therapies are urgently needed. In the past few years, research on G-quadruplexes (G4s) in viruses has boomed, providing powerful evidence for the regulatory role of G4s in key viral steps. Comprehensive bioinformatics analyses have traced putative G4-forming sequences in the genome of almost all human viruses, showing that their distribution is statistically significant and their presence highly conserved. Since the genomes of viruses are remarkably variable, high conservation rates strongly suggest a crucial role of G4s in the viral replication cycle and evolution, emphasizing the possibility of targeting viral G4s as a new pharmacological approach in antiviral therapy. Recent studies have demonstrated the formation and function of G4s in pathogens responsible for serious diseases, such as HIV-1, Hepatitis B and C, Ebola viruses, to cite a few. In this chapter, we present the state of the art on the structural and functional characterization of viral G4s in RNA viruses, DNA viruses and retroviruses. We also present the G4 ligands that provide further details on the viral G4 role and which, showing promising antiviral activity, which could be exploited for the development of innovative antiviral agents.","Ruggiero, Emanuela; Richter, Sara N.",Annu Rep Med Chem,80,32

In this case report, we present a COVID-19 infected patient who had developed abdominal discomfort. The patient underwent magnetic resonance imaging, which showed signs of thrombosis formation in the superior mesenteric vein (SVM). After conservative treatment failed, the patient was considered for vascular intervention. The SMV clot underwent thrombolysis via the infusion of reteplase (dose 6 mg stat, followed by 1mg every hour) through a 5F perfusion Cather (Cragg-McNamara, 20 Cm). Control venography showed near-complete recanalization. The patient was discharged with oral anticoagulants. Our case report is one of the first incidents of successful vascular intervention in SMV thrombosis in the setting of COVID-19.","Ebrahiminik, Hojat; nikpour, Shahriar; Yazdi, Hadi Rokni; Mohammadi, Afshin; Mirza-Aghazadeh-Attari, Mohammad",Radiol Case Rep,80,1

Based on the expectation that it can go out of recession more easily than China's air passenger sector, this paper analyzes four aspects that are favorable and unfavorable for its further development: (1) strengths (China's sustainable economic basis and proliferating cargo suppliers), (2) weaknesses (insufficient cargo capacity and less business internationalization), (3) opportunities (top authority support, rising e-commerce demand, and new technological momentum), and (4) challenges (uncertain trade environment and increasing profitability pressure). Then this paper suggests strategies for China's air cargo suppliers to adapt to the pandemic.","Li, Tao",J Air Transp Manag,80,33

Convalescent plasma for coronavirus disease-2019 patients with severe or critical illness,18.122862,10.71796,2021-03-27,"Despite the conventional view that a truly random V(D)J recombination process should generate a highly diverse immune repertoire, emerging reports suggest that there is a certain bias toward the generation of shared/public immune receptor chains. These studies were performed in viral diseases where public T cell receptors (TCR) appear to confer better protective responses. Selective pressures generating common TCR clonotypes are currently not well understood, but it is believed that they confer a growth advantage. As very little is known about public TCR clonotypes in cancer, here we set out to determine the extent of shared TCR clonotypes in the intra-tumor microenvironments of virus- and non-virus-driven head and neck cancers using TCR sequencing. We report that tumor-infiltrating T cell clonotypes were indeed shared across individuals with the same cancer type, where the majority of shared sequences were specific to the cancer type (i.e., viral versus non-viral). These shared clonotypes were not particularly enriched in EBV-associated nasopharynx cancer but, in both cancers, exhibited distinct characteristics, namely shorter CDR3 lengths, restricted V- and J-gene usages, and also demonstrated convergent V(D)J recombination. Many of these shared TCRs were expressed in patients with a shared HLA background. Pattern recognition of CDR3 amino acid sequences revealed strong convergence to specific pattern motifs, and these motifs were uniquely found to each cancer type. This suggests that they may be enriched for specificity to common antigens found in the tumor microenvironment of different cancers. The identification of shared TCRs in infiltrating tumor T cells not only adds to our understanding of the tumor-adaptive immune recognition but could also serve as disease-specific biomarkers and guide the development of future immunotherapies.
